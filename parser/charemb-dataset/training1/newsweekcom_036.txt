<div> My Turn Tornado <a>Kentucky</a> <a>Deaths</a></div>
<p>My husband and I are sound asleep when the alarms begin at one o'clock on the morning of December 11. We've only been in bed two hours.</p>
<p>At 1.20am, the rain starts for real. It comes on fast. It's the loudest rain we've ever heard. It sounds like a thousand tiny hammers. Then something else starts hitting the roof. Something even louder.</p>
<p>"This is it," I say to my husband.</p>
<p>"It's just hail," he says. "It's not a tornado." I look at him with disbelief.</p>
<p>I look into his eyes and say: "I think we're in trouble."</p>
<p>But then it all stops. Everything goes completely quiet.</p>
<p>We wait in the hallway another half-hour, peeking out every few minutes. At two o'clock the blue lights of a police cruiser flood the inside of our house. Everything else is darkness and an eerie quiet.</p>
<p>But we are alive. We are okay.</p>
<p>"Have you seen your street?" she asks when I climb into the cab of her truck.</p>
<p>We go several blocks out of our way. Half the streets are unpassable, and we have to reverse course more than once.</p>
<p>But in my mother's neighborhood, there is not one tree down, not one branch in the road. It's only a mile from the devastation on our street, but the lights still burn brightly. It's like nothing ever happened.</p>
<p>A neighbor stands in his yard and asks me what is going on. I look into his face and see only confusion. "Do you really not know what happened?"</p>
<p>I tell him that the tornado hit Bowling Green.</p>
<p>"People have died," I tell him. "Houses have been leveled. You're lucky you have power."</p>
<p>This scene repeats itself all day. Another friend who lives in the county tells us she didn't know what happened until her ex-husband banged on her door at two in the afternoon because she wasn't answering her phone.</p>
<p>Back at home, I pull my husband close. I know we are lucky to be alive.</p>

<div> My Turn <a>Christmas</a></div>
<p>One side of the house is very "Texas"; we have cows the size of St. Bernard dogs leading up to a child's playhouse that I turned into a barnyard. It's decked out to look like a real barn with Texas flags and all types of animals around it.</p>
<p>Visitors can walk through light arches on our lawn and inside our garage we have the Christmas village and train. My dad started that collection for me and he's still with me as I build on it. It has gone from 250 pieces to more than 450 this year.</p>
<p>Eventually we might have to have someone help us on the ladders and the roof but we do plan to keep going with our Christmas display. People laugh and say I'm running out of room. I am, but I keep adding platforms so I can build higher on my house!</p>
