<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>China Space Station First Step in Country's Plans to Colonize Space</h1><div> By John Feng <time>On 6/17/21 at 8:42 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>China's far-reaching ambition for a permanent presence in outer space began in earnest on Thursday with the <a>launch of its first crew</a> bound for a new space station.</p>
<p>It signals a great leap forward for the country's burgeoning space program, which took its first step beyond Earth's atmosphere when it launched the satellite Dongfanghong 1, or China 1 in the West, in April 1970.</p>
<p>Fast-forward half a century, the People's Republic of China finds itself among the world's history-making space powers.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it has already articulated plans for prolonged missions in low Earth orbit, then on the <a>moon</a> and <a>Mars</a>.</p>
<p>In January 2019, China became the first nation to put a rover on the far side of the moon, landing Chang'e 4—named for the mythological Chinese goddess who resides there—in the permanent shadow facing away from Earth due to tidal locking.</p>
<p>Last December, its Chang'e 5 probe returned to Earth bearing the first lunar samples in 44 years.</p>
<p>Like the U.S., China's plans also extend further into the solar system. It became only the second country to put a working rover on Mars when Zhurong—named after the god of fire—<a>touched down on the red planet</a> on May 14.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Zhurong was celebrated by the public when it <a>beamed back a symbolic selfie</a> showing the Chinese flag on the Martian surface.</p>
<p>Following the success of its Tianwen-1 ("Questions to Heaven") mission to Mars, CNSA wants unmanned missions to begin returning Martian rock samples to Earth within the next two decades—its next rover is scheduled for 2028.</p>
<p>Between 2040 and 2060, China's space agency plans to send crewed missions with the goal of establishing a sustained human presence on the planet after that.</p>
<a>NASA</a> and the European Space Agency (ESA) have already revealed mission designs that include bringing back samples collected by the rover
<a>Perseverance</a> in the 2030s. Meanwhile,
<a>Elon Musk</a> says he is selling all his belongings in order to fund a 1-million-strong Mars colony by 2050.
<p>China's plans to colonize space will inevitably begin closer to home. Thursday's <a>launch of Shenzhou-12</a> ("Devine Vessel") atop a Long March-2F Y12 rocket in the Gobi Desert was its first manned mission in five years.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan, astronauts Nie Haisheng, 56, Liu Boming, 54, and Tang Hongbo, 45, will embark on the country's longest-ever space mission, lasting three months, and take part in two planned spacewalks.</p>
<p>The crew will be the first to occupy and test the living quarters and life-support systems onboard Tianhe ("Harmony of the Heavens"), the core module of the Chinese space station that was <a>sent into space on April 29</a>.</p>
<p>When fully assembled at the end of next year, China's <a>Tiangong</a> ("Heavenly Palace") is <a>expected to outlast</a> the <a>International Space Station—</a>which is due to retire as early as 2024 after a quarter century in service.</p>
<p>There will be a total of 11 launches in the intense program to build Tiangong: four manned missions, four cargo launches and three module launches, after which China will be able to maintain a permanent presence starting in late 2022.</p>
<p>When the ISS is decommissioned, Tiangong will be the only laboratory in space for many years. To complement its studies of deep space, China also intends to launch a telescope module Xuntian ("Touring the Heavens") in 2024.</p>
<p>Before that, however, NASA, ESA and the Canadian Space Agency will first put the James Webb Space Telescope in orbit this November. It will succeed the Hubble Space Telescope, launched 31 years ago.</p>
<p>Tiangong will be a landmark achievement for Bejing's larger space ambitions. Due to U.S. political objections, Chinese taikonauts have never participated in the ISS.</p>
<p>Some observers have warned of China's goal of one day dominating space and becoming its sole arbiter by wielding technological superiority.</p>
<p>Concerns have also been raised about the lack of transparency beyond its stated ambitions, and the likelihood of space exploration being linked to efforts to modernize its military by 2049.</p>
<p>Ye Peijian, the chief designer of China's lunar program, is most often cited when wary analysts describe the country's darker motives.</p>
<a>Senkaku Islands</a> and the Philippine-claimed Scarborough Shoal—known by the Chinese government as the islands Diaoyu and Huangyan, respectively.
<p>Current comparisons show China's space program is still a distance away from U.S. technical and innovative standards. America also has a far greater budget, but that may not last forever.</p>
<p>In a January paper for the French Institute of International Relations, researcher Marc Julienne concluded that China's space ambitions were built on the pillars of national development, military empowerment and great-power competition.</p>
<p>"Besides building national pride and international prestige, space is a strategic field where Beijing needs to fill the technological gap with the US, and where it is searching for US vulnerabilities," he wrote.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted CNSA for comment on its upcoming missions.</p>
<p>Police in South Africa have arrested a 46-year-old man accused of attempting to transport rhinoceros horn to China inside boxes of chocolate, police said.</p>
<p>The suspect hasn't been publicly named by police.</p>

<p>Newsweek contacted the World Wildlife Fund for comment.</p>
<p>On Monday, President Joe Biden signed a $768.2 billion defense bill into law that keeps women from the military draft and alters the military justice system.</p>
<p>The National Defense Authorization Act has measures in it that change how the military justice system manages sexual assault and other related crimes, essentially removing military commanders' prosecutorial jurisdiction over those cases.</p>
<p>Republicans were able to prevent attempts to include women in the draft and added a measure that prohibits dishonorable discharge for service members who refuse to take the COVID vaccine.</p>
<p>"The Act provides vital benefits and enhances access to justice for military personnel and their families, and includes critical authorities to support our country's national defense," the president said in a statement.</p>
<a>Congress</a> in a prior proposal that was rejected by members of both parties out of concerns it would undermine U.S. efforts to keep pace militarily with China and Russia.
<p>The bill includes $7.1 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and a statement of congressional support for the defense of Taiwan, measures intended to counteract China's influence in the region.</p>
<p>It also includes $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a show of support in the face of Russian aggression, as well as $4 billion for the European Defense Initiative.</p>
<p>In his statement, the president also outlined a number of provisions his administration opposes over what he characterized as "constitutional concerns or questions of construction."</p>

<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>Xi Jinping Says China to Become Dominant World Power Within 30 Years</h1><div> By John Feng <time>On 7/1/21 at 3:27 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>Chinese President <a>Xi Jinping</a> hailed the achievements of the <a>Communist Party</a> of China (CPC) and confidently declared its future goals on Thursday as tens of thousands gathered in Beijing to celebrate its 100th anniversary.</p>
<p>The paramount leader, who donned a Mao suit while other officials arrived in formal attire, told attendees at Tiananmen Square that the party had accomplished its centennial goal of creating a "moderately prosperous society."</p>
<p>"[W]e now march in confident strides toward the second 100-year goal of building China into a great modern socialist country in all respects," he declared, referring to the People's Republic of China centennial in 2049.</p>
<p>"We have never bullied, oppressed or subjugated the people of any other country, and we never will," he told the nation, before warning of the party's "unshakeable commitment" to resolving the "<a>Taiwan</a> question."</p>
<p>"China has caught up with the times," he added.</p>
<p>In his hour-long address, Xi said the CPC had helped China overcome "subversion, sabotage and armed provocation by imperialist and hegemonic powers."</p>
<p>The party was central in dismantling the "old world" and building a new one, he added. It was a callback to the famous Mao Zedong-era slogan that he would later also repeat: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China."</p>
<p>"Only socialism could save China. Only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China," Xi declared.</p>
<p>China's Communist Party chairman referenced the contributions of notable former leaders, including Mao, Deng, Jiang Zemin and his immediate predecessor Hu Jintao.</p>
<p>As large crowds watched on, many without masks, the central section of Xi's speech reinforced the centrality of the CPC in the country.</p>
<p>"The leadership of the party is the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the greatest strength of the system," he said. It is the crux upon which "all Chinese people depend," the president noted.</p>
<p>"We must uphold the party's overall leadership and continue to enhance its leadership," Xi said, noting: "Marxism works."</p>
<p>The CPC's vision of a "great modern socialist country in all respects" inevitably involves a world-beating military, which some China watchers say seeks to outcompete the United States in the region, perhaps globally.</p>
<p>Xi stressed the importance of military strength and military strategy as China embarks on its next phase of development. The party's "absolute leadership over the armed forces" is paramount, he said, as is the loyalty of its troops.</p>
<p>A defiant Xi, who was overseeing the most significant event of his leadership thus far, said the country would "never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress or subjugate us," drawing a loud applause.</p>
<p>"Anyone who attempts to do so will find themselves on a collision course with a great wall of steel, forged by the flesh and blood of over 1.4 billion Chinese people," he said to some of the loudest cheers of the morning.</p>
<p>With <a>Carrie Lam</a> in attendance, Xi remarked on the central government's authority over <a>Hong Kong</a> and <a>Macau</a>, as well as China's "one country, two systems" model, which is meant to grant each city a "high degree of autonomy."</p>
<p>In some of his most bellicose sentences of the day, Xi turned to the topic Taiwan, which he has hinted at capturing in his lifetime.</p>
<p>"Resolving the Taiwan question and realizing China's complete unification is a historic mission and an unshakable commitment of the Communist Party of China," he told the crowd from atop Tiananmen.</p>
<p>"All the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation, including compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, must come together, move forward and resolutely oppose any attempt at Taiwan independence," the Chinese president said.</p>
<p>"No one should underestimate the great resolve, the strong will and the extraordinary capability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity," he concluded, drawing more loud cheers.</p>
<p>In his address, Xi did not abandon the phrase "peaceful national unification," but Beijing had already formalized its policy of never renouncing the use of force against Taiwan with the passing of its Anti-Secession Law 16 years earlier.</p>
<p>In his closing, the Chinese leader, who is expected to be re-elected for a third term next year, called backed his "Chinese Dream" and the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."</p>
<p>Professor <a>Steve Tsang</a>, director of the SOAS China Institute at SOAS University of London, identifies the CPC's post-Deng political system as that of consultative Leninism.</p>
<p>With Xi's replacement of the standardized succession process, the party now works as a "Leninist instrument of control" under one core leader, he said.</p>
<p>"But this core leader (Xi) thinks that whatever he (and by implication, the Party) does is good for China as a whole, and allows no scope for challenging such a view," he said.</p>
<p>"Chinese nationalism and Chinese supremacy"—not only material benefits but also the chance to partake in "China's glory"—are how the CPC seeks to appeal to Chinese abroad, including in <a>Singapore</a> and Taiwan, Hofstede added.</p>

<p>China's deep-space ambitions took another meaningful step forward early Thursday when the country <a>launched the first crewed mission</a> to its own space station in low Earth orbit.</p>
<p><a>Weibo</a>, China's largest social media website, was awash with celebrations as state broadcaster CCTV aired images of the Shenzhou-12 liftoff atop the Long March-2F Y12 rocket at 9:22:27 a.m. Beijing time.</p>
<p>The launch from China's Jiuquan site in the Gobi Desert is the country's <a>first manned mission in five years</a>. The crew of three onboard Shenzhen-12 ("Divine Vessel") will embark on China's longest space mission to date, lasting 90 days.</p>
<a>sent into space on April 29</a>.
<p>Party newspaper Global Times is among the publications to have noted the significant timing of the Shenzhou-12 mission, which will coincide with the centennial.</p>
<a>Tiangong</a> ("Heavenly Palace").
<p>While all three crew are members of the Communist Part of China, Nie, the most experienced of the three taikonauts and already recognized by the title of "space hero," could be given the historic honor of waving the flag.</p>
<p>The crew will also conduct maintenance and scientific operations onboard, with the main aim of verifying existing technology on Tianhe.</p>
<p>China's space station Tiangong is scheduled for completion by the end of 2022. It is <a>designed to last 10 years</a> but could be operational for up to 15.</p>
<p>Before that, China has already scheduled a Tianzhou-3 ("Heavenly Ship") cargo launch for this September and the Shenzhou-13 mission for October.</p>
<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>Why Is China Banned From ISS? Beijing Launches First Part of Its Own Station</h1><div> By Ed Browne <time>On 4/30/21 at 4:32 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>China successfully launched the first module of its own space station on Thursday, prompting curiosity about why the country does not simply use the International Space Station (ISS), according to <a>Google</a> Search data.</p>
<p>The core module of China's station, which will eventually be known as Tiangong, or the China Space Station (CSS), is the largest spacecraft China has ever developed and is 54.4 feet long, 13.7 feet in diameter, and weighs nearly 25 tons</p>
<p>Once complete, Tiangong will form a T-shape with the core Tianhe module in the middle and laboratory modules docked around it.</p>
<p>In 2019, the U.N. confirmed that six experiments were going to be conducted on the CSS involving institutions from Germany, Switzerland, India, Russia and others.</p>
<p>Gu Yidong, chief scientist of the China Manned Space program, told Scientific American: "We do not intend to compete with the ISS in terms of scale." But the elephant in the room remains: China has never been to the ISS.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, the International Space Station is a global project, even though the vast majority of its inhabitants have come from the U.S. and Russia.</p>
<p>Other countries that have sent astronauts to the ISS include Canada, Brazil, the U.K., the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, South Korea, Malaysia, Japan and others.</p>
<p>China is conspicuous by its absence from this list, and the reason lies simply in the fact that the U.S. does not want it to be there.</p>
<a>NASA</a> may not use funds from that division to collaborate in any way with China unless a law specifically authorizes it.
<p>Reuters reported in 2015 that the ban was due to human rights issues and national security concerns.</p>
<a>CNN</a> the idea of the U.S. collaborating with China "gets shut down immediately" whenever it is brought up near
<a>Congress</a>, adding that the Chinese Communist Party is "viewed as a government that seeks to take our intellectual property."
<p>"The Chinese government has always advocated the peaceful use of outer space," Wang Jin, a spokesman for Beijing's Ministry of Defense, said at the time.</p>
<p>The future of the ISS is currently uncertain. Partnerships and funding are due to run out in 2024. NASA told the Financial Times this month: "From a technical standpoint, we have cleared ISS to fly until the end of 2028."</p>
<p>But Russia—one of the station's most crucial partners—has already said it would withdraw from the program in 2025, marking the end of a significant period of international cooperation.</p>
<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>What SpaceX Starlink Satellites Do and How Many Have Been Launched Into Space</h1><div> By Aristos Georgiou <time>On 3/15/21 at 8:04 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>On Sunday, Elon Musk's <a>SpaceX</a> launched <a>another 60 Starlink</a> satellites into orbit around the Earth. But what is the aim of the Starlink project and how many satellites has the company sent into space so far?</p>
<p>The goal of Starlink is to provide superfast global internet coverage with very low latency, even in rural or remote areas that may normally lack reliable connectivity.</p>
<p>In order to do this, the company is planning to deploy tens of thousands of mass-produced broadband satellites in low Earth orbit, creating a "mega-constellation" that will communicate with receivers on the ground.</p>
<p>Starlink satellites are being deployed around 60 times closer to Earth than traditional satellites. SpaceX says this results in lower latency and the "the ability to support services typically not possible with traditional satellite internet."</p>
<p>SpaceX has received regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission to deploy up to 12,000 satellites, and is planning to launch around 30,000 more.</p>
<p>The company's initial constellation will consist of 1,440 satellites, which they hope will provide "near-global coverage of the populated world in 2021."</p>
<p>SpaceX has successfully conducted more than 20 <a>Starlink launches</a> to date, sending satellites into space mostly in batches of 60, with the vast majority being deployed at an orbital altitude of around 340 miles.</p>
<p>So far, the company has launched 1,325 Starlink satellites, although 64 of these have reentered the Earth's atmosphere leaving 1,261 in orbit. SpaceX now owns around one-third of all the active satellites in orbit above the Earth.</p>
<p>Each satellite weighs around 570 pounds, according to the company. They measure about the same size as a table, Sky Telescope magazine reported.</p>
<p>The company said data speed and latency will "improve dramatically" as more satellites are launched and more ground stations are installed.</p>
<p>The project has received criticism from some in the astronomical community who say that the satellites could have a negative impact on <a>scientific observations</a>, while adding more objects to the already crammed orbital environment.</p>
