<a>NHL</a> is nominally set to resume play on Monday, December 27, but it is difficult to see what could change on the ground between now and then. The NHL also

<p>As the popular anti-woke sports pundit Clay Travis <a>tweeted</a>, "Welcome to the party, pal." Kudos to the normally virtue-signaling <a>Black Lives Matter</a> apologist Silver, and shame on NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman.</p>

<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>Private Pain, Shared Grief: A Day For Those Left Behind After Suicide</h1><div> By Stav Ziv <time>On 11/22/14 at 11:05 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Thirty eight years later, in 2008, after Marcus had written a book on dealing with and preventing suicide, he suffered a second blow when his partner's sister took her own life.</p>
<p>"It was traumatic and retriggered, or rather triggered, all kinds of things that came back for me," Marcus tells Newsweek. "I remember thinking that I couldn't do this alone again."</p>
<p>Two weeks later, he attended his first International Survivors of Suicide Loss Day event.</p>
<a>American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP)</a>. "There was something powerful in discovering that I was one of many."
<p>On Saturday, survivors of suicide loss from Anchorage to Atlanta, from Kathmandu to Santiago, will gather at roughly different 275 events to mark the 16th International Survivors of Suicide Loss Day.</p>
<p>The day's events are frequently an entry point to the survivor community for those who have lost someone to suicide and who, like Marcus, will connect with others who have experienced a similar loss for the first time.</p>
<p>The range of emotions people grieving the suicide of a loved one experience can run the gamut, from denial to anger to guilt and sometimes even relief.</p>
<p>"A loss from any death is a painful experience," Marcus tells Newsweek. But "when you lose someone to suicide… you're left with additional challenges. [One's] instinct is to try to make sense of something that is by definition an irrational act."</p>
<p>"The important thing to recognize [is that] everyone grieves differently and we have to respect each other and each other's grief journey," says Marcus.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of Survivor Day is to provide hope for those who have lost someone to suicide, to see how others in similar situations are healing and trust that they can do the same.</p>
<p>"I am committed to working toward the day when no one has to experience this tragedy. Until that time, on this Survivor Day, I hope all those gathered across the world find comfort and gain understanding so they can continue to heal."</p>
<p>Its maker, Jeff Gersh, is all too familiar with his subject matter. He lost his wife, Heather Hartley, to suicide in October 2008.</p>
<a>Dougy Center, The National Center for Grieving Children and Families</a>, every other week for the last six years.
<p>Those who live in large swaths of the world without a local support group or Survivor Day event can join <a>"Survivor Day Live,"</a> an online event hosted by Marcus on Saturday at 1 p.m. EST.</p>
<p>"But anyone in their right mind wouldn't choose" to end their own lives, she says. "They're just trying to escape pain, [a] sense of hopelessness that you may never experience."</p>
<p>A revolt over controversial financial provisions by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, long a staunch Obama ally, led to a day of tension on Capitol Hill on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Since 2011 we have lurched from crisis to crisis with the country constantly under the threat of shutdown or financial catastrophe," he said on the Senate floor. "It's a very bad habit and the American people are very, very tired of it."</p>
<p>Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is also anxious to avoid another unpopular government shutdown as the Republicans head toward taking control of the Senate after the November elections that also gave them a larger majority in the House.</p>
<p>The 1,603-page bill, negotiated by Republican and Democratic appropriators and leaders, blindsided some Democrats and drew their ire when they discovered it would roll back a provision of the Dodd-Frank law due to go into effect next year.</p>
<p>That provision would kill planned restrictions on derivatives trading by large banks, allowing them to continue trading swaps and futures in units that benefit from federal deposit insurance and Federal Reserve loans.</p>
<p>Democrats seeking to play down the Pelosi-Obama divide noted that the two actually were in agreement that the Dodd-Frank measure and some other Republican add-ons were objectionable, but differed on whether to stop the bill because of them.</p>
<p>And while Pelosi put up a spirited fight to kill the add-ons, she stopped short of trying to slay the spending bill late Thursday by demanding "no" votes by her Democrats.</p>
<p>The battle was a warning to Republicans against further "eroding Dodd-Frank or ACA," said a House Democratic leadership aide, referring to Obamacare, the president's landmark healthcare law.</p>
<p>If Senate Republicans manage to lure the support of enough Democrats in that chamber to advance objectionable legislation, "Should the president threaten a veto, the votes will be here in the House to sustain it," Pelosi said.</p>
<p>Democratic fervor against the Dodd-Frank provision was stirred up in part by Senator Elizabeth Warren, long critical of Wall Street and viewed as a possible 2016 presidential candidate.</p>
<p>She repeatedly railed against it this week in Senate floor speeches that talked of Wall Street being allowed to "gamble with taxpayer money" and that caught fire with many House Democrats.</p>
<p>"A piece of equipment Senator Reid was using to exercise broke, causing him to fall and break a number of ribs and bones in his face," an earlier statement from Reid's office said.</p>
<p>Orthman told the Las Vegas Sun the senator was using a resistance band, an elastic band used for strength training, that snapped and hit him in the face.</p>
<p>Another aide, Adam Jentleson, told the newspaper Reid broke bones near his right eye and several ribs when he fell. Jentleson said Reid probably will have severe facial bruises.</p>
<p>Orthman said Reid spent Friday with his wife and spoke with fellow senators in preparation for the Senate's return.</p>
<p>"The president's national security advisor says it's destructive for the prime minister of Israel to address the United States Congress. I couldn't disagree more," Boehner said at his weekly news conference.</p>
<p>"The American people and both parties in Congress have always stood with Israel and nothing, and no one, could get in the way," the Republican leader said.</p>
<p>Tuesday's speech will be the third by Netanyahu to a joint meeting of the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. Britain's World War Two prime minister, Winston Churchill, is the only other international leader to have done so three times.</p>
<p>U.S. lawmakers could have an impact on the course of the nuclear talks. The Senate is due to vote within weeks on whether to impose extra sanctions on Iran. The White House has said this could harm the talks.</p>
<p>Several senators said Kerry told them to make up their own minds about whether to attend Netanyahu's speech.</p>
<p>As partisan rancor over the speech rose this week, Obama's national security adviser Susan Rice said in a television interview that it would be destructive to reduce the U.S.-Israeli relationship to a partisan political issue.</p>
<p>There was one sign of bipartisanship on Thursday when Republican Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnell announced that Netanyahu would meet with him and Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid after the speech next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The White House said Rice and U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power would address the annual convention next week of the AIPAC pro-Israel lobby group, where Netanyahu is also speaking.</p>
<p>Boehner expressed doubts about the nuclear talks as he defended the invitation to Netanyahu. "What is destructive in my view is making a bad deal that paves the way for a nuclear Iran. That's destructive," he said.</p>
<p>Boehner said it was important for the U.S. public to hear Netanyahu talk about the "grave threats" facing Israel. "I'm glad that most of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, will be there to hear what he has to say," he said.</p>
<p>Neither gave any ground ahead of Netanyahu's speech to Congress on Tuesday when he plans to detail his objections to ongoing talks between Iran and world powers that he says will inevitably allow Tehran to become a nuclear-armed state.</p>
<p>He insisted he meant no disrespect for Obama, with whom he has a history of testy encounters, and appreciated U.S. military and diplomatic support for Israel.</p>
<p>The Reuters interview gave Obama a chance to try to preemptively blunt the impact of Netanyahu's closely watched address to Congress.</p>
<p>At the same time, Netanyahu said the relationship between his country and the United Stateswas "stronger than ever" and not in crisis.</p>
<p>Obama also sought to lower the temperature by describing Netanyahu's planned speech toCongress as a distraction that would not be "permanently destructive" to U.S.-Israeli ties and by saying the rift was not personal.</p>
<p>The invitation to Netanyahu was orchestrated by Republican congressional leaders with the Israeli ambassador without advance word to the White House, a breach of protocol that infuriated the Obama administration and the president's fellow Democrats.</p>
<p>The partisan nature of this dispute has turned it into the worst rift in decades between theUnited States and Israel, which normally navigates carefully between Republicans and Democrats in Washington.</p>
<p>Netanyahu wants Iran to be completely barred from enriching uranium, which puts him at odds with Obama's view that a deal should allow Tehran to engage in limited enrichment for peaceful purposes but under close international inspection.</p>
<p>Obama said a final deal must create a one-year "breakout period" for Iran, which means it would take at least a year for Tehran to get a nuclear weapon if it decides to develop one, thereby giving time for military action to prevent it.</p>
<div> U.S. Chuck Schumer <a>Harry Reid</a></div>
<a>challenge</a> from the party's left by the likes of Elizabeth Warren, Schumer's ascension seems a foregone conclusion.
<p>But he's known as a fierce fighter, too—among his favored opponents are the gun and alcohol lobbies. And he will need to fight if the Democrats are to regain the Senate, as Reid said they needed to do.</p>
<p>"If it winds up resulting in the loss of American lives to terrorism on our own soil, Congress will have to answer as to why it did nothing about it," Gross added.</p>
<p>The Brady Campaign confirmed that Gross sent his letter to McConnell and Reid around 10:30 a.m. ET Wednesday—a few hours before the deadly San Bernardino incident.</p>
<a> tweet</a> on his Twitter account. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California has sponsored a proposal under consideration that would prevent known or suspected terrorists from buying guns at federally licensed dealers.
<p>Speaking from the Oval Office Thursday, President Barack Obama said the shooters in San Bernardino perhaps had "<a>mixed motives</a>." He also said gun safety can't be left solely to the professionals.</p>
<p>"We are going to have to search ourselves as a society," he added, "to make sure we can take the basic steps that would make it harder—not impossible—but harder for individuals to get access to weapons."</p>
<div> U.S. Harry Reid <a>Gun Control</a> <a>Obamacare</a></div>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said he plans to force a vote on gun control legislation in the Senate on Thursday. Reid's announcement comes less than a day after two shooters killed 14 and injured 17 in San Bernardino, California.</p>
<p>Reid's legislation is unlikely to become law since it would require approval by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.</p>
<a> three dead and nine wounded</a>. But Reid's legislation would not have prevented Robert Dear, the alleged attacker in that shooting, from obtaining a gun, since criminal records show Dear was never prosecuted under the 1994 law.
<p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Democrats on Wednesday unveiled a plan to defeat Islamic State abroad and enhance security at home with intensified air strikes, sanctions to deter bank transactions and a new "czar" to take charge of the effort.</p>
<p>It also includes some bipartisan legislation already in the works to reform the visa waiver program to require participating countries to universally require machine-readable, electronic passports.</p>
<p>The Senate Democrats also called for improved Transportation Security Agency screening at airports and a new strategy for locking down radiological material at hospitals and industrial sites that could be made into a "dirty bomb."</p>
<p>The new anti-Islamic State "czar" would be "fully empowered and in charge of the United States' efforts to defeat" the organization, according to the Democrats' statement.</p>
<p>The plan would create a new stabilization fund for Jordan and Lebanon to help Syrian refugees remain closer to their homelands, as well as a new Department of Homeland Security office dedicated to stopping "homegrown extremism."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, was not immediately available to comment on the proposals.</p>
<p>The appointment of a new anti-Islamic state czar would follow word in September that General John Allen, the U.S. special envoy appointed by President Barack Obama to counter Islamic State, planned to step down.</p>
<p>Updated | In the wake of the unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia on Saturday, many of the presidential candidates and top Republicans were quick to weigh in on whether President Obama should make a nomination for the now-vacant seat.</p>
<p>Scalia's death came amid an already competitive election season in which control of both the White House and Congress are at stake. Now, the judicial branch of government is in play as well.</p>
<p>"The American people‎ should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president," McConnell said.</p>
<p>"Would be unprecedented in recent history for [Supreme Court] to go year with vacancy. And shameful abdication of our constitutional responsibility," Reid <a>said in a tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Obama briefly addressed the country just before 9 p.m. ET. Ahead of a summit with Asian countries next week, the president is on a golf vacation in Rancho Mirage, California.</p>
<p>Obama called the conservative justice a "larger than life" presence on the bench and one of the "towering legal figures of our time," who influenced a generation of judges, lawyers and students.</p>
<p>Confirmation of Scalia's death came through just hours before a presidential debate between the six remaining Republican presidential candidates.</p>
<p>Other Republican candidates also issued statements following Scalia's death. Donald Trump <a>said in a tweet</a> the loss of Scalia on the Supreme Court "is a massive setback for the conservative movement and our COUNTRY!"</p>
<p>Florida Senator Marco Rubio also said a nominee shouldn't be confirmed until the new president has taken control of the White House.</p>
<p>"The next president must nominate a justice who will continue Justice Scalia's unwavering belief in the founding principles that we hold dear," Rubio said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Now it is up to all of us to fight for the principles Justice Scalia espoused and carry forth his legacy," Bush said in a statement.</p>
<p>Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton criticized Republicans who have spoken out against filling Scalia's seat soon.</p>
<p>And her challenger, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, praised Scalia's legacy: "While I differed with Justice Scalia's views and jurisprudence, he was a brilliant, colorful and outspoken member of the Supreme Court."</p>
<p>This story has been updated to include remarks from Obama and Clinton.</p>
<p>This article first appeared on The Daily Signal.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made his position clear just hours after the news broke. The Kentucky Republican wants Scalia's seat to remain open until after the 2016 election.</p>
<p>"The American people should have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court justice," McConnell wrote in a statement. "Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president."</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat of Nevada, fired back a counterstatement: "Failing to fill this vacancy would be a shameful abdication of one of the Senate's most essential constitutional responsibilities."</p>
<p>McConnell's Democratic counterpart also urged the president to "send the Senate a nominee right away" and said that leaving the seat open "would be unprecedented in recent history."</p>
<p>Obama laid the groundwork for the fight to fill Scalia's seat Saturday night. In a press conference from California, he said there was plenty of time for him to nominate a justice and for the Senate to consider his nominee.</p>
<blockquote><p>These are responsibilities that I take seriously as should everyone. They're bigger than any one party. They're about our democracy. They're about the institution that Scalia dedicated his professional life.</p></blockquote>
<p>The eventual nominee will be the third Supreme Court justice advanced by Obama. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan won confirmation when Democrats held a majority in the Senate.</p>
<p>Following Scalia's death, lawmakers from both parties were quick to close ranks around their leaders. The ensuing fight could dominate the chamber's agenda in the coming months.</p>
<p>Senator Chuck Grassley will do much to turn the tide of that coming conflict while serving as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. And the Iowa Republican has already signaled he won't move any nominees out of committee.</p>
<p>"It's been standard practice over the last 80 years to not confirm Supreme Court nominees during a presidential election year," Grassley wrote in a statement. He continued:</p>
<p>The traditional but unofficial <a> Thurmond-Leahy rule</a> dictates that the Senate halt all judicial confirmations in the last six months of a president's time in office.</p>
<p>With Grassley in opposition, it will be difficult, but not completely impossible, for Democrats to advance a nominee out of committee and to a Senate floor vote.</p>
<p>With 268 days left in office, Obama hasn't run up against that cutoff date yet. However, pressure was already mounting on Senate Republicans to close the tap on the nominee pipeline before Scalia's death.</p>
<p>So far in 2016, the Senate has <a> confirmed five Obama-nominated judges</a>, including two this past week. There are <a> 11 others</a> who have been approved by the Judiciary Committee and await floor votes.</p>
<a> Alliance Defending Freedom</a> noted that "it is unlikely that a new justice will be installed prior to the election of our next president."
<p>The liberal group <a> MoveOn.org</a> attacked McConnell, calling on the majority leader to "retract his shameful, partisan suggestion that the Senate abdicate its responsibility."</p>
<p><a>Philip Wegmann</a> is the congressional correspondent for the <a> Daily Signal</a>. </p>
<p>In a move that seems to signal the readiness of Democratic leaders to end their party's contentious rivalry on the campaign trail, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid has endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the November general election.</p>
<p>"I think that my work with her over the years has been something that I have looked upon with awe," Reid told CNN in an interview released on Wednesday afternoon. "She is a person who is a very quick learner."</p>
<p>In a <a> live Democratic town hall</a> on Tuesday night, Clinton said: "I believe every election or caucus has to be taken seriously. You have to work hard for every vote."</p>
<p>She added: "I'm taking no vote, no place for granted."</p>
<p>Reid reportedly shared his decision with Sanders on Tuesday, but didn't call for him to suspend his campaign.</p>
<p>The Democrats are focused on South Carolina, where in three days voters will cast their ballots in the state's primary.</p>
<p> U.S. Republicans have only themselves to blame for Donald Trump, a "monster" spawned by their constant partisan opposition to all major Obama administration initiatives, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The reality is that Republican leaders are reaping what they've sown," Reid said, recounting seven years' worth of staunch Republican opposition to Obama's initiatives.</p>
<p>Republicans had decided from the start of Obama's presidency in 2009 that he was an "illegitimate" president, said Reid, who is retiring at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Republicans have controlled the House of Representatives since 2011. And while they took control of the Senate in 2015, they previously used their minority status deftly to challenge Obama.</p>
<p>Some Republicans, such as Senator Lindsey Graham, have been outspoken in their opposition to Trump as the prospective party nominee, saying the New York billionaire' s inflammatory rhetoric will lead to defeat in the general election.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Trump, 69, now looks near unstoppable to be the Republican running against the eventual Democratic presidential candidate - most likely Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>Among Trump's more controversial proposals have been his call for a wall along the entire southwestern U.S. border to keep out Mexican immigrants.</p>
<p>When Congress was attempting to pass a comprehensive immigration bill in 2013 and 2014, many Republican lawmakers put the brakes on the measure, instead calling for tough border enforcement only.</p>
<p>"Now it's time for Republicans to undo what they've done by denouncing Donald Trump," Reid said. "Trump is the GOP's Frankenstein monster. If the Republicans fail to stop Donald Trump, he'll tear the party apart even more than it is now."</p>
<p>Updated | Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid criticized the U.S. government on Thursday for not doing enough to end female genital mutilation (FGM) around the world or to spread awareness of the practice within the U.S.</p>
<p>"I don't know how some agency hasn't focused on mutilation of these girls," said Reid. "With more money we could do a better job of outreach."</p>
<p>"It always seems like there's a lot going on to keep us away from certain issues," Reid said. "If there were ever a human rights violation, this is it."</p>
<a> European countries</a>, including Russia and the U.K.
<a> Equality Now</a>, a global human rights organization, and

<p>"We spend lots of money and lots of things…but we've basically spent nothing, nothing on this," said Reid. "Every time it's done to a girl their lives are changed forever."</p>
<p>This article has been updated with the name of the high-level event mentioned by Reid, the U.S. End FGM/C Summit.</p>
<p>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump pressed his attack on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton's integrity as she struggled to get past a new firestorm over her emails with just eight days to go until Election Day.</p>
<p>Friday's announcement by FBI Director James Comey that his agency is investigating more emails as part of a probe into Clinton's use of a private email server gave new hope to Trump that he can make an improbable comeback and win on November 8.</p>
<p>But the issue resurfaced unexpectedly on Friday when Comey sent a brief letter to members of Congress to tell them the agency was looking at new emails.</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, accused Comey on Sunday of "a disturbing double standard for the treatment of sensitive information, with what appears to be a clear intent to aid one political party over another."</p>
<p>He said, without providing evidence, that the FBI was keeping "explosive information" under wraps about ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.</p>
<p>Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings hammered this accusation on Monday, urging the FBI to release information on Trump and his advisers' dealings with Russia.</p>
<p>An FBI spokeswoman said late on Sunday: "When we receive the letter it will be handled through our usual process in responding to members of Congress," referring to Reid's accusation.</p>
<p>Democrats have demanded that Comey and the FBI rapidly work to make public what they know about the new email trove. A source familiar with the matter said on Sunday that the FBI had secured a warrant to examine the emails.</p>
<p>Daily tracking polls should reflect soon whether the controversy is having an impact on the race. Early voting means that millions of Americans have already cast their ballots.</p>
<p>Trump had already narrowed Clinton's lead in national opinion polls and gone into the lead in a small number of the battleground states where the election is likely to be decided.</p>
<p>The FBI is investigating illicit text messages Weiner is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported that federal agents are preparing to spend weeks examining about 650,000 emails contained on Weiner's laptop for possible links to Clinton's email use.</p>
<p>If Clinton wins the election, the controversy could cast a cloud over her White House transition.</p>
<p>Trump said the new email cache could represent a "motherlode" of emails.</p>
<p>Cummings said on Monday that the FBI's vague statement on new emails related to the Clinton investigation made it impossible for Clinton to defend herself and "basically gave Donald Trump a softball to hit over the fence."</p>
<p>On Sunday, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook questioned the FBI head's decision to notify Congress of the email review before he even knew whether they were significant or relevant.</p>
<p>Comey was appointed FBI director by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.</p>
<div> U.S. Harry Reid <a>Nevada</a> <a>Democrats</a></div>
<p>Most Democratic lawmakers returned to Washington this week in a state of mourning, still reeling from the gut punch they took in last week's election. One delegation of Democrats, however, had reason for a (restrained) victory lap.</p>
<p>What made Nevada different: How did it successfully buck a voting wave that swept Trump into the White House and solidified the GOP's hold on Congress?</p>
<a>according to CNN's poll</a>. Compare that to Florida, where Democrats trailed Republicans 32 percent to 33 percent, and North Carolina, where Democrats led by a narrower 36 percent to 31 percent margin.
<h4>Tough to Adopt Nevada's Model</h4>

<div> U.S. Harry Reid <a>Pentagon</a></div>
<p>Between 2007 and 2012, the Defense Department ran the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program at the cost of about $22 million with the backing of former U.S. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, The New York Times reported Saturday.</p>
<p>The since-retired Reid stated he was proud of the program, despite the fact many around the world view the search for aliens and UFOs to be the product of overly stimulated imaginations and conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>"I'm not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going," Reid told The Times. "I think it's one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I've done something that no one has done before."</p>
<p>The Defense Department claimed the program ended five years ago and so did its funding. However, it still exists and probes "episodes" reported by current service members, according to The Times. Parts of the program also remain classified.</p>
<p>The funding mostly went to Bigelow Aerospace, a Las Vegas-based company run by billionaire Robert Bigelow, a long-time friend of Reid's.</p>
<p>Among the program's reported discoveries and investigations of "encounters" was a 2004 incident off the coast of San Diego. Two Navy F/A-18F fighter jets chasing down a "whitish oval object" the size of a commercial airplane.</p>
<p>Though, the date and location of the incident remains unknown.</p>
<p>Bigelow believes the U.S., unlike rivals like China and Russia, are missing out on opportunities due to potential "stigma" involved with funding alien and UFO research.</p>
<p>If any such stigma exists, Bigelow does not care. <a>He explained to 60 Minutes in May</a> that he thoroughly believes alien life exists.</p>
<p>A secretive Pentagon program investigating unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and evidence of alien life has been uncovered, revealing several sightings of peculiar aircraft by members of the U.S. military.</p>
<p>The Pentagon claims that the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program was terminated in 2012 after five years in order to focus time and resources on other issues.</p>
<a> The New York Times</a> on Saturday—ended with the termination of its funding, its backers claim it is still in existence. Below are some of the most bizarre sightings laid out in the declassified reports.
<p>Pentagon UFO Sightings: Las Vegas Research Facility</p>
<p>In order to investigate reports of UFO sightings, a building in Las Vegas was modified to house any materials that were suspected to have come from an unidentified flying object.</p>
<p>This reportedly included metal alloys and plastics, while a section of the facility was also used to study people who claimed to have had contact with the objects that resulted in physical and physiological changes.</p>
<p>The Las Vegas–based facility also described sightings of flying objects that remained airborne despite no visible signs of propulsion or lift.</p>
<p>Pentagon UFO Sightings: "Whole fleet" of Glowing Auras</p>
<p>An audio recording from the Navy pilots who witnessed the peculiar aerial phenomena suggests there was more than one of the UFOs. "There's a whole fleet of them," one pilot is heard saying.</p>
<p>Another pilot responds: "My gosh. They are all going against the wind, the wind is 120 miles to the west… look at that thing, dude."</p>
<p>Pentagon UFO Sightings: Oval object in San Diego</p>
<p>Program officials also investigated events that took place prior to the program coming into existence, studying videos captured by cameras aboard military aircraft.</p>
<p>This included a 2004 video of a bright oval-shaped object off the coast of San Diego, which was determined by the pilots of the fighter jets pursuing it to be the size of a commercial aircraft.</p>
<p>Pentagon UFO Sightings: "Black Money" Funding</p>
<p>The Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program was funded with less than 0.004 percent of the Defense Department's annual budget, which is partly why it has gone unreported for more than a decade.</p>
<p>The $22 million funding came thanks to Nevada Democrat and UFO enthusiast Harry Reid, who passed the majority of the money to his friend Robert Bigelow's aerospace research firm Bigelow Aerospace.</p>
<p>Reid referred to these funds as "black money," as only himself and two other senators—Alaska Republican Ted Stevens and Hawaii Democrat Daniel K. Inouye—knew of the program.</p>
<p>Sen. Rand Paul (R–Kentucky) took to Twitter to burn President Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Ted Cruz (R–Texas), and aliens in his annual "airing of the grievances" social media Festivus celebration on Saturday.</p>
<p>Each year since 2013, Paul has paid homage to the fictional Seinfeld holiday Festivus on Dec. 23 by adhering to a strong tradition of calling out everything and everyone who has bugged him over the last 12 months.</p>
<p>This year, the politician first took aim at Fox News and the so-called war on Christmas.</p>
<p>"Before we get started, I need to alert @FoxNews and someone in DC that this is NOT a war on Christmas. It's a war on everything else," he wrote.</p>
<p>Speaking of Fox News, I'm going to begin the day they usually do, with a thought about @HillaryClinton," Paul tweeted next.</p>
<p>He then moved onto Clinton's book, What Happened, which chronicled the 2016 election.</p>
<p>"I hear that many people are saying great things about Hillary's book and It won some major awards. That's great for her, seriously," he wrote.</p>
<p>Paul took the opportunity to mock Trump, who once said that his book The Art of the Deal is his second favorite book after the Bible.</p>
<p>"I hear even @realDonaldTrump loved It. He said It was the 'third best book ever written.'"</p>
<p>"That's high praise considering he thinks the first two were both inspired by God," the senator added.</p>
<p>He didn't let up on Trump, making light of his go-to social media platform for complaining, Twitter.</p>
<p>"I want to pause to wish @realDonaldTrump a Happy Festivus. We told him to take today off, since he airs his grievances on here every day," Paul tweeted.</p>
<p>"There are how many million Americans who've wanted to force-choke Ted, and he picked on the one who could do It. Brave, he is," Paul continued, throwing in a Drake GIF.</p>
<p>Finally, Paul went after former Sen. Harry Reid (D–Nevada) for not telling him that he was working on a secret Pentagon program investigating the existence of UFOs.</p>
<p>"We argued about taxes. Fought about spending. Worked on repatriation together. I helped treat your eye injury…," he started.</p>
<p>"HOW IS IT YOU NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THE ALIENS, HARRY??!!"</p>
<p>"You can definitely do it with an act of Congress," Trump said in an Axios interview, an excerpt of which was released before its Sunday debut on HBO. "But now they're saying I can just do it with an executive order."</p>
<p>The American Civil Liberties Union told Newsweek by phone on Tuesday it does not "preannounce" lawsuits, but strongly indicated that it would sue the Trump administration should the president move forward with his proposed executive order.</p>
<p>Trump said his proposal would end automatic citizenship for newborns of any non-U.S. citizens, whether or not the parents had U.S. legal status.</p>
<p>"Therefore," Reid's bill continued, the newborn would "not be a citizen of the United States or of any State solely by reason of physical presence within the United States at the moment of birth."</p>
<p>Reid's proposal sought to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act and not the 14th Amendment, as was King's.</p>
<p>Thirteen years later in 2006, Reid offered an apology on the Senate floor, saying introducing such a law was the "low point" of his long career in government.</p>
<p>Reid added that he was later "confronted" by his wife over his move to curb birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>"She, in effect, said: 'I can't believe that you have done it,'" Reid said. "But I had done it."</p>
<p>Reid's legislation never made it out of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Refugee Affairs, while King's died in the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.</p>
<p>Tuesday was also not the first time Trump proposed the idea either. On the campaign trail in 2015, in addition to an immigration reform plan posted on his website at the time, then-candidate Trump stated his stance on ending birthright citizenship.</p>
<p>"You have people on the border and in one day, they walk over and have a baby and now all of the sudden, we're supposed to pay the baby," said Trump in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo in August 2015. "I believe you can win it legally."</p>
<p>Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a fierce supporter of the president, praised Trump in a tweet for being "willing to take on this absurd policy of birthright citizenship."</p>
<p>Jadwat said the reason these past proposals have likely failed is that they're "flatly unconstitutional and because it's incredibly bad policy."</p>
<p>"The whole point of the 14th Amendment is to never again be in the situation in this country where we have a permanent multigenerational underclass of people who are inferior, under the law, to other folks in this country," Jadwat said.</p>
<a>told Newsweek </a>that "another 7,000" troops would be "on standby on 24-hour notice."
<p>The total number of troops deployed to secure the southern border, which is about 7,000, roughly equals the number of troops <a>deployed to Syria and Iraq</a> to fight the Islamic State militant group.</p>
<p>The veteran Democrat and former Senate leader Harry Reid said President Donald Trump was "amoral" and had "no conscience."</p>
<p>"Trump is an interesting person," Reid, who was Nevada senator for 20 years until 2017 and was both Democrat minority and majority leader during that time, told The New York Times in an interview published today.</p>
<p>"He is not immoral but is amoral. Amoral is when you shoot someone in the head, it doesn't make a difference. No conscience.</p>
<p>"I think he is without question the worst president we've ever had. We've had some bad ones, and there's not even a close second to him... He'll lie. He'll cheat. You can't reason with him."</p>
<p>The former senator, who is currently being treated for pancreatic cancer, reportedly had brushes with the Mafia while he was Nevada's gaming chairman overseeing casinos in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Asked what he made of comparisons between Trump and a mob boss, Reid told The Times : "Organized crime is a business and they are really good with what they do.</p>
<p>"But they are better off when things are predictable. In my opinion, they do not do well with chaos. And that's what we have going with Trump."</p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to Newsweek's request for comment.</p>
<p>Reid's Trump comments were published the same day that Utah Senator-elect and 2012 Republican presidential nominee <a> Mitt Romney wrote a scathing critique of the president</a>.</p>
<p>Romney, 71, a potential challenger to Trump in 2020, wrote in The Washington Post that the presidency had made a "deep descent" in December.</p>
<p>Romney also called the president "thoughtless" and said he "has not risen to the mantle of the office."</p>
<p>"To a great degree, a presidency shapes the public character of the nation," Romney wrote in The Post.</p>
<p>"A president should unite us and inspire us to follow our better angels. A president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect.</p>
<p>"As a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit. With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable.</p>
<p>"And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring."</p>
<p>"Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player WIN!"</p>
<p>Former Democratic Senate Majority Leader and Nevada Senator Harry Reid argued for continued study into UFO phenomena in an interview with CBS affiliate KLAS 8 in Las Vegas, citing competition from Russia and China—a UFO race, of sorts.</p>
<p>"I'll bet you anything that China is spending some money checking this out. I'll bet you anything KGB Putin is spending some money checking this out," Reid told George Knapp of Las Vegas Now's I-Team.</p>
<p>"I've just heard rumors," Reid said.</p>
<div> U.S. Donald Trump <a>2020 Election</a> <a>Harry Reid</a></div>
<p>Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warned an audience at the University of Nevada Las Vegas this week not to underestimate President Donald Trump's chances of winning reelection.</p>
<p>The stern words from the former Democratic leader who retired in 2017 come as multiple polls show nearly every Democratic 2020 candidate coming in ahead of Trump in a general election.</p>
<p>"If anyone thinks Trump can't be reelected, they better get another thing coming. He can be reelected," said Reid, before adding, "hope to hell he isn't."</p>
<p>Reid joined former Republican Senator Dean Heller on Thursday to launch the Boyd Law School's Law and Leadership Program, led by former Republican Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval.</p>
<p>Reid responded that he'd rather "go with socialism."</p>
<a>he Daily Beast</a> that he was "pretty damn worried" Trump would win another term in office. "Anybody that thinks he's going to be beaten easily is wrong. As sad as it is. As hard as it is for me to say this: Don't count that man out."
<p>Former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is also expected to give Biden his support after dropping out of the presidential race after the South Carolina primaries on Saturday.</p>
<p>Both Klobuchar and Buttigieg are expected to appear at a rally in Houston, Texas Monday to announce their endorsements.</p>
<p>National Democratic front runner Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has also been garnering support for his campaign, receiving an endorsement from progressive political action committee Democracy for America [DFA].</p>
<p>Rice also called Biden "the strongest candidate to take on and defeat [President Donald] Trump" in a Twitter thread.</p>
<p>DFA's endorsement of Sanders came after its membership gave him the majority vote.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to both the Biden and Sanders campaigns but did not receive a response in time for publication.</p>
<p>Biden has been endorsed by a number of familiar politicians that voters may recognize while many of Sanders' endorsements come from labor and political organizations whose endorsements carry weight with millions of American voters.</p>
<p>Biden has also been endorsed by some Democratic members of Congress such as California Representative Dianne Feinstein, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia and Florida Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz.</p>
<p>Sanders' more progressive policies have garnered him the endorsements of New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib and Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.</p>
<p>Omar is expected to join Sanders onstage at a campaign rally Monday in St. Paul, Minnesota.</p>
<p>Sanders has also gained the support of a number of celebrities including actor Mark Ruffalo, musician Miley Cyrus and filmmaker Michael Moore.</p>
<p>Biden's celebrity supporters include actor Tom Hanks, director Rob Reiner and singer Cher.</p>

<p>Former GOP Speaker of the House John Boehner took aim at Senator Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, for "stirring up some of the crazies" in the House Republican caucus while Boehner led the legislative chamber under former President <a>Barack Obama</a>.</p>
<a>Boehner's new book</a>, On the House: A Washington Memoir, will be released on Tuesday and has already drawn controversy due to the former Republican leader's criticism of fellow GOP politicians and
<a>Democrats</a> alike. In particular, Boehner's book left some of its most stinging criticism for Cruz. The former GOP House Speaker commented on his disapproval of Cruz further during an interview with CBS This Morning on Monday.
<a>Senate</a>, stirring up some of the crazies of my own caucus to cause all kinds of problems," Boehner said. "And that's probably why I zeroed in on him, probably the only person in this book in the way that I did."
<p>"As I say in the book, there's nothing worse than a reckless jackass who thinks he's smarter than everybody else," he added.</p>
<p>In his new book, Boehner describes Cruz as a "reckless a**hole." In a previous interview with CBS Sunday Morning, Boehner described Cruz and GOP Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio as "political terrorists."</p>
<p>"Perfect symbol, you know, of getting elected, making a lot of noise, draw a lot of attention to yourself, raise a lot of money, which means you're gonna go make more noise, raise more money," Boehner added in his previous <a>CBS</a> interview.</p>
<p>In a tweet last week, Cruz wrote in response to Boehner: "The Swamp is unhappy. I wear with pride his drunken, bloviated scorn. Please don't cry."</p>
<a>strongly criticized</a> former President
<p>Reid responded to Boehner's remarks in a <a>CNN</a> interview on Saturday. "The deal is this: John Boehner and I got a lot done, but we didn't mince words," the former Democratic lawmaker said.</p>
<p>Boehner represented Ohio's 8th Congressional District from 1991 to 2015. He served as Speaker of the House from 2011 to 2015.</p>
<p>Lawmakers in Nevada passed legislation on Monday that would position the state to be the first to hold a presidential primary in the 2024 election season.</p>
<p>So far the move to change the first presidential test from Iowa to Nevada seems to come from a backstage lobbying campaign driven by former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Nevada Democrats are also arguing that Nevada's diversity is a better representation of the country's population than Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
<p>"It's time for Nevada to take its rightful place, not just first in the West but in the nation, as a diverse state, a state with diverse issues," said Nevada Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation.</p>
<p>There is no word yet on whether or not the Democratic National Committee will back Nevada's change should Sisolak sign the bill into law. Without DNC backing, Nevada will have to amend its legislation or risk losing delegates.</p>
<p>Nevada Republican Party Chairman Michael McDonald does not back the bill. He argued in a statement of opposition that changing the caucus would "diminish" Nevada's "large influence" on the nominating process.</p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to Gov. Sisolak for comment.</p>

<div> News Democrats <a>Republicans</a> <a>Gerrymandering</a></div>
<p>Ohio state Supreme Court justices on Tuesday asked if <a>Democrats</a> can prove that the state's congressional districts were gerrymandered by <a>Republicans</a> as they heard oral arguments in two lawsuits challenging the new four-year map.</p>
<p>Democratic groups and lawyers for voting rights said that the map "'unduly' favors the Republican Party" is irrefutable, which would make it unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Phillip Strach, an attorney for Republican legislative leaders, said the people wanted less partisan districts "and that's absolutely what they got."</p>
<p>"The districts are a win for the people of Ohio," he said. "They got more competitive districts. Seven out of 15—that's a plurality of the districts—are now legit competitive districts, even the experts agree."</p>
<p>Strach said Republicans' expert found that Democratic U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown would have won eight or nine of them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NDRC's constitutional challenge contends the map leans 12-3 in favor of Republicans, although the GOP describes it as 6-2, with the remaining seven districts being competitive.</p>
<p>Ohio and other states were required to redraw their congressional maps to reflect results of the 2020 census, under which Ohio lost one of its current 16 districts due to lagging population.</p>
<p>Ben Stafford, representing the NDRC, pointed to the new map's "efficiency gap," a measure of votes wasted because lines strongly favor one party or the other. A Democrat's vote in a slam-dunk Republican district, for example, or vice versa.</p>
<p>"The 2011 plan was struck down by a federal district court as a partisan gerrymander," he said. "The efficiency gap of that plan was 11 percent. The efficiency gap of this plan is about 23 percent. It's worse."</p>
