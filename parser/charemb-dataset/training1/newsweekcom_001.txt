<p>While Democratic House Speaker <a>Nancy Pelosi</a> <a>has voiced opposition</a> to measures that would prohibit <a>Congress</a> members from owning or selling stocks while in office, numerous elected officials have profited immensely from trading.</p>
<p>"We are a free-market economy," Pelosi told reporters on Wednesday when asked about the practice. "(Congress members) should be able to participate in that."</p>
<a>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> recently voiced support for a ban on congressional stock trading. She called it "absolutely ludicrous" that Congress members can trade stock with the information, access and influence that they have.
<p>Democratic Senators <a>Elizabeth Warren</a> of Massachusetts and Jeff Merkley of Oregon have both introduced legislation that would ban Congress members from making such trades.</p>
<p>Merkley's bill gained bipartisan support, and the law forbids Congress members from using the knowledge they gain from their elected positions to conduct "insider trading" of stocks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, lawmakers have made millions from the buying and selling of stocks.</p>
<p>While Pelosi doesn't own any stock, her husband Paul Pelosi reportedly made $5 million after obtaining 4,000 shares of <a>Google</a>'s parent company <a>Alphabet</a>.</p>
<p>Democratic New York Representative Tom Suozzi made about 300 stock transactions from 2017 to 2020. The trades represented somewhere between $3.2 million and $11 million in value, according to the Campaign Legal Center.</p>
<p>Republican Tennessee Representative Diana Harshbarger reportedly made 700 stock trades worth as much as $10.9 million.</p>
<p>Democratic Nevada Representative Susie Lee made over 200 stock trades between early 2020 and mid-2021 collectively worth as much as $3.3 million.</p>
<p>Republican Oklahoma Representative Kevin Hern made about $2.7 million in nearly two dozen stock trades.</p>
<p>Republican North Carolina Senator Richard Burr sold off between $628,000 and $1.72 million in stock holdings in mid-February. He made the trades a week before the COVID-19 pandemic sent the U.S. stock market downward.</p>
<p>Burr, who is a member of the House Health Committee, said he decided to sell based on public information and not the closed-door pandemic briefings he received in Congress.</p>
<p>Republican Texas Representative Blake Moore made as much as $1.1 million in dozens of stock trades from early to mid-2021.</p>

<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Mayfield Candle Factory Employees Sue Company for 'Flagrant Indifference' About Severe Weather</h1><div> By Zoe Strozewski <time>On 12/16/21 at 11:51 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Workers who survived the deadly collapse of a Kentucky candle factory during an outbreak of tornadoes are suing their employer for "flagrant indifference" in allegedly refusing to let them leave early.</p>
<p>Eight employees at the Mayfield Consumer Products factory in Kentucky were killed in the collapse nearly a week ago, and some have accused the company of threatening to fire them if they left.</p>
<p>When the tornado leveled the factory in Mayfield and left nothing but rubble, officials initially thought the death toll could be as high as 70.</p>
<p>Supervisors also took a roll call to see who had left, Johnson said, though a company spokesman denied the accusation.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed in state court accuses the company of violating Kentucky occupational safety and health workplace standards by keeping its staff at work. It seeks compensatory and punitive damages from Mayfield Consumer Products.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the company has previously insisted that employees were free to leave anytime. The spokesman did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment Thursday.</p>
<p>Conder, one of the employees, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that a supervisor threatened her with written disciplinary action if she went home early because storms were approaching.</p>
<p>Conder also questioned why the company did not encourage workers to go home—or at least give them a better understanding of the danger—between a first tornado siren around 6 p.m. Friday and another one around 9 p.m., shortly before the tornado hit.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed less than a week after the storms that began Friday night destroyed lives and property from Arkansas to Illinois and in parts of neighboring states, carving a more than 200-mile (320-kilometer) path through Kentucky alone.</p>
<p>Since then, all workers have been accounted for, according to state and local officials who have spoken to the company.</p>

<p>Retailers mailed more than 300 million catalogs last month, according to the U.S. Postal Service, even after postal rates were given a hefty 9 percent boost in August.</p>
<p>Officials also said that the total number of catalogs has increased 12 percent over last year, signaling that the shopping publications might still have a place in an increasingly digital world.</p>
<p>"The industry is not dying. There are plenty of companies that are still aggressively mailing catalogs," said Paul Miller, vice president and deputy director at the American Catalog Mailers Association.</p>
<p>Lipsman said that digital advertising on e-commerce sites increased up to 20 or 40 percent this year.</p>
<p>Jonathan Zhang, a professor of marketing at Colorado State University, said another important factor is that catalog and store shoppers are more loyal to brands than people who shop online only.</p>
<p>His research found a higher return on investment from catalogs because those shoppers buy more than online-only shoppers.</p>
<p>The internet's clutter tends to produce shoppers who search for specific things, preventing the "serendipitous discoveries" that shoppers make while browsing in a store or catalog, he said.</p>
<p>"Catalogs do seem a bit old-fashioned. They're so analog. But I think it may be their only way of getting visuals in front of you," said Kaplow, who hasn't set foot in a store in years.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, catalogs remain expensive to print and mail.</p>
<p>Catalog numbers dropped about 40 percent between 2006 to 2018, when an estimated 11.5 billion were mailed to homes, but they've stabilized and are showing signs of an uptick in volume, according to Miller at the ACMA.</p>
<p>Miller said catalogs won't be going away anytime soon, partly because they have staying power compared to the fleeting impact of email, online advertisements and other digital communication.</p>
<p>"People are used to clicking and moving on, but the catalog is still sitting there on your coffee table. It's going to continue to entice you to shop," he said.</p>

<p>Fishermen in Maine face further hardship for the cold-water shrimp season as the fishery remains shut down because of concerns with warming waters affecting the health of the shrimp population.</p>
<p>The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission board voted on Friday to keep the shrimp fishery shut down for another three years. It initially closed in 2013.</p>
<p>An increase in water temperature sped up the rate at which a particular species of squid preys on the shrimp, decreasing their population, according to scientists.</p>
<p>The board last voted to extend the existing moratorium on commercial fishing of the shrimp in 2018. The board could have decided to reopen the fishing industry on Friday, but chose not to in the face of discouraging news from scientists.</p>
<p>"Temperature data continues to show unfavorable conditions for northern shrimp," Hunter said. "The status of the stock continues to be poor."</p>
<p>The domestic cold-water shrimping industry was based almost entirely in Maine, though some shrimp came to the docks in Massachusetts and New Hampshire.</p>

<p>The aerospace company Boeing announced Friday it's no longer requiring a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination for its United States employees after some workers objected.</p>

<p>About 8 percent, or roughly 10,000, U.S. employees could have lost their jobs if the mandate wasn't removed.</p>
<p>Companies including Amtrak and some health care systems have followed suit in suspending their COVID-19 vaccine requirements.</p>
<p>Amtrak announced Tuesday to suspend their mandate allowing the company to run as normal instead of having to cut back on their services, the rail service said.</p>
