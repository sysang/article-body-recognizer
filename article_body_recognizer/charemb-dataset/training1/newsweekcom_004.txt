<h3>U.S. should consider a vaccine mandate for domestic flights, Fauci says</h3>
<p>Chief White House medical adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said the United States should "seriously" consider a vaccine mandate for domestic air travel.</p>
<p>"There's requirements whether you want to get into college or a university, if you want to work in certain places, and if you make vaccinations a requirement that's another incentive to get more people vaccinated," Fauci told MSNBC Monday.</p>
<p>"If you want to do that with domestic flights, I think that's something that seriously should be considered," he added.</p>
<p>The U.S. requires foreign nationals to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before traveling to the U.S. There is currently no vaccine mandate for domestic travel.</p>
<p>Over the holiday weekend,<a> hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed</a> due to COVID outbreaks among flight crews.</p>
<h3>Thousands of New York residents received booster shot since start of city's incentive</h3>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday, approximately 180,000 COVID-19 booster shots had been administered since the start of the city's latest vaccine incentive.</p>
<p>Along with its latest incentive, the city's new mandate for private employers to check their employees' proof of vaccination goes into effect Monday.</p>
<p>The New York mayor stated, "It's the holidays. We want to protect each other". "The number one way to keep everyone safe is to get vaccinated."</p>
<h3>Cruise cancels two stops amid Covid outbreak</h3>
<p>A COVID-19 outbreak hit another Florida-based cruise ship.</p>
<p>Carnival Freedom departed from Miami on December 18 for an eight-day trip.</p>
<p>"A small number on board were isolated due to a positive COVID test," Carnival said in a statement to Newsweek.</p>
<p>The total number of people infected was not released, but the ship was denied entry to Bonaire and Aruba because of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Carnival called Freedom a ''vaccinated cruise'' and all guests were tested before boarding.</p>
<p>The ship returned to Miami on December 26, as scheduled.</p>
<p>It marked the <a>third outbreak</a> last week, impacting cruise ships departing out of South Florida.</p>
<h3>NBA expands testing, encourages players to get boosted</h3>
<p>New testing protocol for players in the National Basketball Association (NBA) went into effect Sunday as COVID cases continue to rise in the league.</p>
<p>The new testing plan for players yet to get their booster shots will remain in place through Jan. 8. The league is encouraging players to get their extra vaccine dose.</p>
<p>There are at least 116 players known to be in testing protocols, but that number could be higher as teams update their injury reports.</p>
<p>Several teams have at least one active COVID case. This has impacted team rosters and game schedules.</p>
<p>"This is the reality of this association right now," Miami coach Erik Spoelstra told the Associated Press.</p>
<h3>Flight to Shanghai turned back under new COVID rules</h3>
<p>A Delta Air Lines flight headed from Seattle to Shanghai was forced to turn around midair because of new pandemic-related cleaning procedures at a Shanghai airport, Delta said Monday.</p>
<p>The new requirements implemented at Shanghai Pudong International Airport, "require significantly extended ground time and are not operationally viable for Delta," Delta said in a statement.</p>
<p>The flight returned to Seattle last week. According to Chinese media, the move left passengers with expired COVID-19 test results and U.S. visas.</p>
<p>Restrictions have been tightened in some areas of China amid the recent outbreak of cases due to the Omicron variant. The Winter Olympics are set to begin in Beijing February 4.</p>
<h3>New York's pediatric hospital admissions increased since Omicron surged</h3>
<p>Health Commissioner Dr. Mary Bassett addressed vaccination and hospitalizations rates for children and teens ages 5-11 alongside New York Govenor Kathy Hochul at a press conference Monday.</p>
<p>Bassett stated that there has been an increase in pediatric admissions since Dec.5.</p>
<p>As Omicron is rapidly spreading through New York, Governor Hochul is encouraging the FDA to approve vaccines for kids under 5.</p>
<h3>Biden on COVID testing availability: 'It's clearly not enough'</h3>
<p>President Joe Biden joined the White House COVID-19 Response Team's call with the National Governor's Association Monday.</p>
<p>During the call, Biden said the COVID response is a state issue.</p>
<p>"There is no federal solution," he said. "This gets solved on the state level."</p>
<p>Biden reiterated the main points of his <a>COVID response plan that he outlined in a speech last week.</a> He offered White House support to the governors and told them that "if you need something, say something."</p>
<p>He also noted that testing capabilities have expanded significantly since he took office, including the increased availability of at-home test. But Biden recognized that amid the Omicron surge, "it's clearly not enough."</p>
<p>"Seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do and we're doing it," he said.</p>
<p>"If we had known, we would have gone harder and quicker if we could have," he added.</p>
<h3>NYC vaccine mandate goes into effect Monday</h3>
<p>New York City's vaccine mandate for private-sector businesses goes into effect Monday.</p>
<p>The sweeping mandate will require employees to show proof of at least one does of the COVID-19 vaccine and ban unvaccinated employees from the workplace.</p>
<p>This affects about 184,000 workers, according to the Associated Press. Businesses that do not comply with these new requirements could face fines starting at $1,000.</p>
<h3>Around 2 million travelers at U.S. airports Sunday</h3>
<p>Air travel volume returned closer to pre-pandemic levels Sunday, as airlines battle employee shortages due to Omicron.</p>
<p>Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers screened just over 2 million travelers at U.S. airports December 26.</p>
<p>In 2020, about 1.3 million people were screened on December 26.</p>
<p>Around 2.58 million travelers were screened on December 26, 2019, according to the TSA.</p>
<h3>Hundreds of flights canceled, delayed due to COVID</h3>
<p>Hundreds of flights were canceled across the country this weekend as COVID-19 cases surge among flight crews and airport workers.</p>
<p>As of Sunday morning, some 633 flights within, into or outside the U.S. were canceled, according to the data tracking website FlightAware. The website also noted that 531 flights were delayed.</p>
<p>These disruptions comes as airline staff call in sick. Delta said it expected more than 300 of its flights would be canceled on Sunday, December 26 as a result due to a surge in Omicron cases as well as poor winter weather.</p>
<p>FULL STORY: <a>Hundreds of Flights Canceled After Christmas Day As Omicron Misery Continues</a></p>
<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>NYC Faces Lowest Nursing Staff Numbers in Almost 2 Years, 1 in 60 Tests Positive for Virus</h1><div> By Katherine Fung <time>On 12/27/21 at 11:03 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>New York state reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on March 1. Six days later, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency on March 7.</p>
<p>Two Mount Sinai Health System hospitals in Manhattan have seen nursing figures fall from 4,654 in February 2020 to 4,483 nurses this month. New York-Presbyterian Hospital saw the number of nurses drop from 3,718 to 3,348 in the same period.</p>
<p>This comes at a time when the city's most densely populous borough is reporting that 1 in 60 people tested positive for the virus last week, raising the city's seven-day positivity rate to 15.5 percent.</p>
<p>Figures are particularly high on Manhattan's West Side, where the positivity rate for the Hudson Square/Meatpacking District/West Village area was 16.4 percent between December 14 and 20.</p>
<p>Figures are expected to continue to rise after residents gathered to celebrate the holidays over the weekend.</p>
<p>Hochul's announcement follows new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a>CDC</a>), which shortens the amount of time health care workers need to self-isolate in "crisis conditions."</p>
<p>Under such conditions, personnel can return to their health care facilities after five days—half of the previous 10-day standard set by the CDC—if the infected employee is asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.</p>
<p>Under "conventional" conditions, infected health care workers can return to work after seven days if they produce a negative test.</p>
<p>The shortened isolation times aim to get health care workers back to hospitals that may be overwhelmed by the highly transmissible Omicron variant, while also mitigating further staffing shortages.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the New York State Nursing Association for further comment but did not hear back before publication.</p>

<div><div>Newsletter</div><div><div><div>Best of Newsweek via email</div><p> Daily news headlines detailed briefings enjoyed by half a million readers.</p></div></div></div>
<p>A TikTok star has been criticized online after posting a video of her performing a viral dance in a hospital alongside her unwell baby.</p>
<a>YouTube</a> and co-hosts her very own podcast, The Monday Mama, which according to the
<a>Apple</a> Podcasts official description offers listeners insight on the "realness of motherhood."
<p>However, Leavitt's <a>parenting</a> credentials have come under intense scrutiny after she posted and then deleted a video of herself <a>dancing</a> energetically alongside her hospitalized son.</p>
<a>CDC</a>. While most adults will experience "mild, cold-like symptoms" the respiratory virus "can be serious, especially for infants."
<p>Leavitt posted the dance video explaining they were "waiting for him to breathe better on his own." The video generated enough of a backlash on TikTok for Leavitt to remove it from the platform.</p>
<p>However, by then the clip had already appeared on <a>Reddit</a>, where it has drawn a similarly enraged reaction along with over 60,000 upvotes. The video has also appeared on <a>Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>Most people commenting on Reddit appeared stunned at the clip and the manner in which Leavitt chose to convey what is very serious news.</p>
<p>Pa2phx commented, sarcastically: "I bet her funeral announcements are fire." Other users like ShotCheeze, were more directly writing: "Stop it, get some help."</p>
<p>Middle_Message8081 branded Leavitt one of those "parents teachers are afraid of" while OneCelery01604 said: "The kid is doomed."</p>
<p>Another user, posting as -Wizeguy- said: "this really triggers me."</p>
<p>"Can't believe she's dancing and smiling for clout while her son is struggling for oxygen," they said. "Her priorities are all f***ed up, and it's going to be her son that suffers from it growing up. Hopefully she grows up quickly."</p>
<p>Moranth-Munitions added: "It's crazy that the addiction to social media is so strong that it can take center stage over the health of her baby."</p>
<p>In a follow-up video, a tearful Leavitt attempted to address the controversy in a clip filmed in what appears to be a hospital room.</p>
<p>"I understand that people are upset with the video that I made," she said. "I just want to be clear and communicate that that was just me trying to be positive."</p>
<p>Leavitt added: "I think it's important to not just assume what someone's going through.</p>
<p>"I took the video down because I could see, you know, where somebody could get the wrong idea but that honestly was just me trying to be positive in this situation."</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted Leavitt for comment.</p>
<div> Business Apple <a>Labor</a></div>
<p>A group of shareholders from Apple Inc. submitted a proposal asking the tech conglomerate to perform a civil rights audit of its business, it was revealed Tuesday.</p>
<p>The proposal was primarily filed by a trio of large investment groups that together own at least 23 million shares of Apple.</p>
<p>The company also reportedly bans surveys related to company diversity. Multiple labor lawyers have said that these combined actions could be violating workers' protections.</p>
<p>The proposal called for a look into the hiring practices at Apple, in addition to calling out the culture seen at the top levels of the company.</p>
<p>"It is unclear how Apple plans to address racial inequality in its workforce," the proposal reportedly stated. "Apple currently has no Hispanics and only one Black member on its executive team."</p>
<p>Indeed, Apple's 2020 self-published diversity report listed the company's leadership as being only 4 percent Black and 8 percent Hispanic. Across the board, the company showed only 9 percent Black employment and 4 percent Hispanic employment.</p>
<p>At 47 percent, the largest portion of workers for Apple remained white.</p>
<p>This is despite that same report also stating that "in the last year, we made progress toward more inclusive leadership by bringing people into Apple and hiring from within."</p>
<p>"Whatever the company's doing, it seems like there's a gap."</p>
<p>Waizenegger pointed out the recent unionization of a <a>Starbucks</a> store in Buffalo, New York, to show that "things can happen quickly sometimes. Even very successful, well-regarded companies have to be mindful of that."</p>
<p>The proposal is expected to be one of several similar issues that Apple will reportedly face during its 2022 shareholders meeting.</p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to Apple for comment.</p>

<header><div> <a>Business</a></div><h1>'They Were Spying On Us': Amazon, Walmart, Use Surveillance Technology to Bust Unions</h1><div> By Jo Constantz <time>On 12/13/21 at 6:00 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>This story is co-published with Capital Main</p>
<a>Amazon</a>'s Whole Foods utilized heat maps that were based on predictive analytics to track store locations considered at high risk of union activity, and
<a>Google</a> reportedly has a system to alert managers to any internal meetings scheduled with 100 or more employees, "partially to weed out employee organizing," according to the human resources newsletter HR Brew.
<p>There are few restrictions on how these tools are used. "Employers do have surprising freedom to monitor what their employees do on their own systems," said V. John Ella, an employment and business lawyer based in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>These practices became even more invasive as the shift to remote work dissolved boundaries between home and work for many.</p>
<p>Today's technology drastically reduces the amount of work you need to do to keep tabs on workers, making comprehensive surveillance financially viable for the first time.</p>
<p>Some elements of surveillance have become so commonplace that they're easy to overlook. ID badges, for example, can be used to monitor employees' movement within a workplace, tracking whom they meet with and when.</p>
<p>While technology has changed, labor law has not.</p>
<p>Amazon, in particular, will continue to find "ever more imaginative means to surveil workers," Hanley said. "There's really nothing that they're not going to figure out."</p>
<a>Facebook</a> groups by contract drivers to plan strikes. The company has insisted that those programs were not intended to clamp down on organizing efforts by workers.
<p>Such monitoring can create the monotone hum in your mind that you are constantly being watched. It'll get you to question: "Should I talk to other people? How can I talk to them? How do I know Amazon doesn't know?"</p>
<p>If an employer came across evidence of organizing while collecting data for other purposes, they would essentially have to ignore some of that information and compartmentalize it in a way that protects the employees from retaliation, per labor law.</p>
<p>But under "at will" employment agreements, employers can fire workers for any reason or no reason at all.</p>
<p>Organizers say that in this context, maintaining secrecy is crucial. The process can be painstaking as organizers try to keep everything under wraps.</p>
<p>Calvin Skinner, an organizer at the SEIU-UHW, said that during one recent two-year campaign, "We had to be so covert until we filed for the election."</p>
<p>Most organizers are well versed in using secure, private means of communication like Signal, an encrypted messaging app, and avoiding company devices that can be monitored.</p>
<p>But acting in such secrecy fosters a feeling of wrongdoing. "If it's too secret, too confidential, then it starts to feel illicit," said Bodie. "It's like, oh, we shouldn't be doing this."</p>
