<p>Complicating the situation even further for this year’s PSLE cohort is the fact that they are the first to experience the revised PSLE scoring system. </p>
<p>Touted by the MOE as easing the pressure brought about by peer competition, this reform has yet to allay the apprehension felt by some students and parents, and teachers had to play a major role as ambassadors in explaining the scoring system.</p>
<h2>WHAT TEACHERS ARE REALLY WORRIED ABOUT</h2>
<p>Among teachers’ concerns will be how students will react to their examination results. A key focus will be dealing with students whose results fall short of their own, or their parents’, expectations. </p>
<p>Another will be how to celebrate with students who have done well without upsetting those who have not. In addition, teachers will be thinking of how to respond to parents’ varied emotions.</p>
<p>It is tricky for teachers to navigate these complex emotions with a degree of sensitivity, bearing in mind, for instance, that examination results that appear commendable to them might be viewed disappointingly by students and parents.</p>
<p>After students have received their results, some may approach their teachers for advice on the choice of a secondary school. </p>
<p>As significant adults in their students’ lives for the better part of this year, and even longer in some instances, teachers are well-placed to offer suggestions to both parents and students on how to make well-informed decisions.</p>
<p>However, as in the case of examination results, teachers need a similar degree of tact in respecting parents’ and students’ choices.</p>
<p>Teachers’ little gestures, such as words of comfort or encouragement at these sorts of significant moments in students’ lives, may make all the difference in the world to students, and may stay in students’ memories long after they have graduated.</p>
<h2>UNDERSTANDABLE ANXIETIES</h2>
<p>Their hopes and dreams for their students’ futures have to finally face the reality of the examination results and this national sorting exercise.</p>
<p>If there is one thing that the past two years has taught us, it is the vital importance of teachers in students’ lives and the need to support their overall well-being.</p>
<p>Teachers have been an integral part of their students’ lives. The arduous task of examination preparation has been made all the more challenging because of the numerous disruptions to school life. </p>
<p>Yet teachers have had to soldier on in order to maintain some semblance of normality for themselves and for their students amid abnormal times. </p>
<p>The issue of teachers’ mental well-being and the danger of burnout has been the subject of recent media coverage. The MOE has pledged its commitment to supporting teachers’ well-being.</p>
<p>But just as crucial today as PSLE results go out is how much students and parents extend understanding and appreciation towards teachers, which will undoubtedly be welcomed. </p>

<h1> Commentary: The biggest test on PSLE results day is one for parents </h1>
<div> <p>While the anxiety is real, the way we respond to the grades our children get makes a huge difference to a child, says June Yong.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> June Yong </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: If you are a parent of a Primary 6 student, you may start feeling increasingly tense as PSLE results day draws near. </p>
<p>On that day, it will be our turn to take a test and it will be exceptionally difficult to pass if our child’s results turn out lower than expected. </p>
<p>Our performance will have little to do with textbook knowledge, and everything to do with practising what we preach – in showing empathy, supporting our children, and loving them unconditionally.</p>
<p>In recent years, the spotlight has been on parents’ unique role in protecting their children’s mental wellbeing – one key aspect being their ability to manage academic pressure. </p>
<p>We know we have to resist comparing our children’s achievements to others, to focus on the process of learning and not the outcome, and not to react to poor grades with a do-or-die attitude. </p>
<p>I’ve been doing my best to put these into practice with my 12-year-old. Especially when I saw her putting a lot of pressure on herself, we tried to shift her focus away from grades to the small but concrete steps forward she’s made. </p>
<p>For example, she used to get overwhelmed whenever she had to write a Chinese composition from scratch. But soon she was able to craft a piece covering all the details shown in the picture, with some beautifying phrases here and there. </p>
<p>Before I wrote this piece, I asked my daughter if she felt anxious about her results. And I was surprised when she replied coolly: “What’s there to be anxious about? The results won’t change!”</p>
<p>I am sure she worries about it but I hope all the conversations we’ve had this year – about how the PSLE does not measure her worth as a person – have been worthwhile.</p>
<p>Yet this doesn’t absolve me from thinking about how I will respond on results day.</p>
<h2>WHERE DOES FEAR OF EXAMS COME FROM?</h2>
<p>Most children start off their academic journey with an exam-neutral attitude. It is how parents respond to the first unsavoury grade that sets the tone. </p>
<p>When the mother showed a fearful face, the baby does not cross the visual cliff. If the mother shows an encouraging expression, the child is more likely to overcome the challenge.</p>
<p>Similarly, a young child only learns how much his performance on a test matters when he brings home his first poor grade. Of course, by this time they are also referencing the reactions of their teachers and friends in school.</p>
<p>But as parents, we can control how intentional we are in expressing our feelings about education and learning, because children are masters of non-verbal cues, whether we are aware or not. </p>
<p>One indicator of how badly parents react to test scores is the level of fear the child experiences when he gets a test back. </p>
<p>Such stories make me think, when children as young as 10 conceal information from their parents, it is a sign that perhaps they have come to see failure as shameful. </p>
<p>Are society’s high expectations and often singular definition of success to blame?</p>
<p>To be clear, there is nothing wrong with setting high standards. The opposite – where we hold a nonchalant attitude towards studies or punctuate every single performance with effusive praise and accolade – isn’t ideal either. </p>
<p>Parents should also be careful in how we respond to children who do very well and encourage them to be humble and modest about their results.</p>
<p>While there is nothing wrong with having high expectations, we do have to be realistic. And a lot of this depends on what your child is like.</p>
<p>My middle child would argue (rather convincingly too) that there is nothing wrong with being average. He puts in a reasonable amount of effort on his studies (with lots of time for play leftover) and obtains respectable results. </p>
<p>Despite my initial chagrin, I’ve come to accept that if these are the goals he has set for himself, then perhaps I shouldn’t breathe down his neck to push him for that few extra marks. </p>
<p>Seeing his own efforts bear fruit should be motivation enough to keep him going in the right direction.</p>
<p>But it is not easy to let go. After all, haven’t we been brought up to value excellence? Which may be why it is so hard to take failure or a low score in stride.</p>
<p>Perhaps the key is to look inward and examine our own emotions and fears about grades. How did our parents react to our failures, were we ashamed of our own results? </p>
<p>While MOE has removed a chunk of exams in the lower primary and lower secondary years, exams are still a big part of assessing a child’s learning and in the absence of other things, there is a tendency to hyper focus on it. </p>
<p>The truth is, there are many dreams and fears embroiled in a single PSLE score. </p>
<p>We fear that the child will end up in less desirable school, or worst, mix with the wrong crowd. We dream of the day they would earn a scholarship or can say with pride they got into a top school.</p>
<p>The emotions we tie to PSLE often stem from our own unmet needs or unexpressed fears, but it’s important to know they can cause even the most well-intentioned parent to trip up.</p>
<p>I often remind myself that every child is special – one may not be inclined towards math, another may not be great at languages. But they can sing, write, or fix things. They are loving and kind and all of these should be celebrated. </p>
<h2>THE KEY TO A COMPASSIONATE RESPONSE</h2>
<p>Despite my daughter’s cool attitude, I do catch myself taking short breaths as the day looms near. If she gets an unexpectedly poor result, will my face match the words I’ve preached?</p>
<p>To prepare for different scenarios, we drew up a list of possible schools to apply for, covering a wide range of cut-off points. The last thing I want her to feel in the event of disappointing results is that she has no options.</p>
<p>“Regardless of where you land, I believe you’ll be able to thrive there,” I told her, and my end of the bargain is to mean every word of it.</p>
<p>The tough part is therefore, separating the person from the performance. </p>
<p>We can acknowledge our own fears and allow ourselves to feel disappointed and yet still convey our unconditional love for the child. This keeps their sense of self intact, unscathed and unshaken by poor grades. </p>
<p>Only by holding space for our children to fall and supporting them as they pick themselves up again will we be able to ace this test.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Not brushing your teeth may increase your risk of severe COVID-19 </h1>
<div> <p>Bad oral hygiene has been associated with making many other diseases worse, and COVID-19 might be one of them, says two UK dental researchers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sim K. Singhrao </a> <a> Alice Harding </a> </div> </div>
<p>PRESTON, United Kingdom: Not brushing your teeth will get you in trouble with the dentist – but since the arrival of the pandemic, it could lead to bigger problems too. </p>
<p>There’s growing evidence that poor oral health raises the risk posed by COVID-19. Research shows that people with poor oral health can end up with more severe symptoms if they catch the coronavirus.</p>
<p>COVID-19 patients who also have gum disease are 3.5 times as likely to be admitted to intensive care compared to those without. They’re also 4.5 times as likely to need to be put on a ventilator and nine times as likely to die from COVID-19.</p>
<p>This may seem shocking, but the fact that there’s a link between oral health and COVID-19 is less surprising when considering the link between oral hygiene and other diseases.</p>
<p>Bad oral hygiene has been associated with making many other diseases worse.</p>
<p>Principally this happens when bad hygiene is sustained for long periods, leading to dysbiosis – where the bacteria in the mouth change from a peaceful state into an aggressive one.</p>
<p>Once the mouth’s bacteria become aggravated, they can cause gum disease, chewing away at the tissues of the mouth and entering the blood stream.</p>
<p>And once there, the bacteria can then flow around the body and settle in various organs, raising levels of inflammation and over time contributing to various specific and chronic conditions.</p>
<p>Indeed, if this happens, there’s barely a part of the body that can’t potentially be affected. Poor oral health can have an impact on the heart, raise blood pressure and make diabetes worse by raising blood sugar levels.</p>
<p>It’s been linked to premature births, arthritis, kidney diseases, respiratory disease and even some neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s.</p>
<h2>SO IS THE SAME THING HAPPENING WITH COVID-19?</h2>
<p>Possibly. Compared to those with mild or moderate symptoms, people with severe COVID-19 have elevated levels of a specific inflammatory marker called CRP.</p>
<p>Some people with severe COVID-19 also suffer what’s called a “cytokine storm”, where the immune system goes into overdrive fighting off the virus and harms the body’s own tissues at the same time.</p>
<p>Research shows that people with poor oral health also sometimes have elevated levels of CRP and cytokines – which suggests that gum disease can trigger the same sort of zealous immune response as COVID-19, though to a lesser degree.</p>
<h2>BACTERIAL SUPERINFECTIONS</h2>
<p>However, we currently understand little about how exactly oral hygiene and COVID-19 interact, and it could be that they are combining in other ways to make the disease worse too.</p>
<p>For instance, a big problem with COVID-19 and other respiratory viral illnesses are bacterial superinfections. These are where areas directly infected by the virus – such as the lungs and airways – are simultaneously infected with bacteria.</p>
<p>Bacterial superinfections are common in people who have COVID-19, and they’re significantly more common in people with severe disease.</p>
<p>It’s not known precisely what impact they have, but it’s reasonable to assume that these concurrent infections raise the risk of severe disease and death.</p>
<p>Throughout the pandemic, studies have found that a large proportion of people dying from COVID-19 – in some cases, 50 per cent – were also infected with bacteria at the same time.</p>
<p>If someone’s oral hygiene is poor, this could raise the risk of a superinfection. Poor oral hygiene means more aggressive bacteria in the mouth, which could then easily be breathed into the airway and lungs to launch a superinfection.</p>
<p>On top of this, poor oral health may also help the coronavirus infect the body.</p>
<p>Enzymes from the bacteria that cause gum disease can alter the surface of the mouth and respiratory tract, making it easier for other microbes – such as the coronavirus – to adhere to these surfaces and grow there.</p>
<p>As time passes it will become clearer exactly how oral health affects the progress of COVID-19. It may be that for some people, all of these mechanisms are at play at the same time.</p>
<p>It’s therefore more important than ever to maintain proper oral hygiene. This means brushing twice a day for at least two minutes with a fluoride-containing toothpaste and visiting the dentist on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Hopefully you won’t catch the coronavirus, but if you do, having good oral health and caring for your mouth could significantly reduce your risk of developing severe symptoms.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Holidays should be relaxing, so are overseas trips really worth the hassle right now? </h1>
<div> <p>Fears about changing protocols and catching COVID-19 are real concerns despite the great desire to travel but there are ways to mitigate these, says Expedia’s Lavinia Rajaram.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lavinia Rajaram </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore’s first vaccinated travel lane (VTL) scheme to Germany and Brunei in August was the nation’s first major step forward to reopening its borders to international travel, in a safe, calibrated way. And boy was it welcomed.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the first VTL, search demand data showed travel to Munich and Frankfurt grew 10 times in the first week, compared to the week before the announcement. </p>
<p>This trend continued following the additional VTL announcements for South Korea and other destinations. </p>
<p>In our annual Vacation Deprivation study for 2020, Singapore ranked number one in the world as the most vacation deprived market in the world, sharing the spot with Italy.</p>
<p>More than 71 per cent expressed feelings of being vacation deprived, with those aged between of 18 to 35 feel most/very vacation deprived. </p>
<p>Another study conducted in April, to understand how travellers were reacting to planning travel once again, however, showed why that push to venture overseas might not materialise.</p>
<p>More than half of holidaymakers from Singapore felt stressed at the thought of booking an overseas trip in the next 12 months and indicated that they would need a helping hand when planning for their next holiday. </p>
<p>Of those planning leisure travel in the next 12 months, 63 per cent agree it’s important for them to have all their travel planning needs on a single platform. </p>
<h2>TRAVEL ANXIETY IS REAL</h2>
<p>Feelings of travel planning anxiety mixed with a high need to travel immediately are a sign that the travel environment today has become complex. </p>
<p>Restrictions can change, depending on how the COVID-19 situation in specific countries pan out. For instance, just last week, Germany classified Singapore as a “high risk area” and adjusted its protocols. </p>
<p>Quarantines are clearly the undisputed travel killer. From Expedia’s search data trends, people are now choosing their travel destination based on the absence of quarantine, and high local vaccination rates.</p>
<p>Our data shows travellers in Asia are extremely fearful at the thought of being stuck abroad and the possibility of contracting COVID-19 when travelling overseas. </p>
<p>What then may make travel more of a possibility for greater numbers of people?</p>
<h2>NO MORE BOOK-ON-THE-GO DAYS</h2>
<p>Gone are the days we had the benefit of booking a flight, packing and departing all on the same day. The new world of travelling is all about thorough planning to eliminate feelings of travel anxiety and hesitancy.</p>
<p>Tour companies, dormant for nearly 20 months, are now gearing up to offer travellers tour packages which take into account these exigencies. </p>
<p>Major players like Chan Brothers and Dynasty have to cater to tour groups in smaller numbers, with bigger buses for safe distancing and ART test kits available for anyone who doesn’t feel well. </p>
<p>There is safety in numbers. Consumers who normally don’t use group tours are considering them just to have someone help sort out emergencies in case they happen.</p>
<p>Apart from the checklist, the travel guide also includes up to date government advisories for any destination you may be planning travel for. This is useful, in the event local situation changes, you have access to that information easily. </p>
<h2>THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN BOOKING YOUR TRIP</h2>
<p>Deciding to go is just half the challenge. We know COVID-19 has made knowing how to deal with changing circumstances a critical travel skill. So once you’re ready to book – just keep in mind these few crucial items. </p>
<p>Be flexible: Look out for options with flexible booking policies – to save yourself from the stress should plans change or travel have to be cancelled.</p>
<p>Purchase travel insurance: Ensure your plan covers COVID-related disruptions such as cancellations and delays, as well as hospitalisation in the worst-case scenario. </p>
<p>Travel insurance, where before was a good to have is now a must-have, because there may be times your booking policy may not cover your loss in unforeseen circumstances. </p>
<p>Understand what testing is required pre-boarding. Some countries or airlines require travellers to produce a negative COVID-19 test 48 hours prior to departure, others 72 hours. </p>
<p>Check to see if the country of destination will require you to download a local tracing app – and equally important to know if the app is available on your phone. There may be a local equivalent version which you may need to purchase.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Can you be denied a kidney because you’re not vaccinated against COVID-19? </h1>
<div> <p>Vaccination improves clinical outcomes of organ donation, but vaccine requirements for transplants might lead us down a slippery slope of inequality, says bioethicist Michael Wee.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Michael Wee </a> </div> </div>
<p>DURHAM, United Kingdom: Last month, a health system in Colorado, United States, told a woman she’d be removed from the kidney transplant waitlist, if she refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine, according to a New York Times story.</p>
<p>The news provoked strong reactions: Is this a legitimate way to decide who gets an organ? </p>
<p>Or unjust discrimination, since vaccination should be a free choice? Would more medical services be made conditional on COVID-19 vaccination status?</p>
<h2>HEALTHCARE RESOURCES: ALWAYS SCARCE?</h2>
<p>The idea that we must pick and choose who receives a kidney may seem unpalatable at first. But this isn’t the first time the pandemic has made us face up to the difficulties of allocating finite healthcare resources. </p>
<p>Not too long ago, the idea of countries running out of intensive care unit (ICU) beds and ventilators, and doctors having to decide who gets treated, seemed unthinkable.</p>
<p>That changed when COVID-19 first hit Italy. The surge in infections put unprecedented pressure on healthcare resources, shining a global spotlight on triage: How should doctors decide who to save in the event ICUs could not cope?</p>
<p>Ordinarily, hospitals prioritise patients based on urgency and need. This is equitable, respectful of everyone’s equal worth and allows medicine to do its job of saving lives without favour or discrimination. </p>
<p>This is why going to accident and emergency department with a sprained foot will keep you in the waiting room longer than someone wheeled in unconscious with a stroke.</p>
<p>When we cannot save everyone, we have to find a way to maximise clinical outcomes with scarce resources. </p>
<p>We can draw an analogy with the kidney transplant case. Donor organs are probably one of the scarcest medical resources in the developed world, relative to need. </p>
<p>Waiting lists are often long – in Singapore, the average waiting time for a kidney transplant is nine years, according to the Ministry of Health. </p>
<p>The US and the UK practise “longevity matching”, for example. Younger patients, who generally live longer with better clinical outcomes, are prioritised for younger donor organs, which usually last longer.</p>
<p>Seen in this light, COVID-19 vaccination status would be a legitimate aspect of assessing the ability to benefit, since transplant patients have a significantly higher mortality rate if infected with coronavirus.</p>
<p>It’s also consistent if other vaccinations have already been required for receiving donor organs, as is the case in the Colorado health system in question.</p>
<p>Maximising clinical outcomes with scarce resources therefore presents a compelling case for making transplants conditional on COVID-19 vaccination, among other health requirements.</p>
<h2>FAIR TREATMENT OF UNVACCINATED INDIVIUALS</h2>
<p>But there is another side to the story which shouldn’t be forgotten: Equality. If we think primarily in terms of efficiency and outcomes in a crisis, will certain vulnerable groups in our community be left behind?</p>
<p>While many were sympathetic towards Italian doctors when they had to make some hard choices, some thought things went too far when an Italian medical institute suggested imposing an age limit on ICU admission.</p>
<p>This would be a blunt approach, reducing patients to just one characteristic, without individual assessment of their ability to benefit.</p>
<p>Is vaccination status a similarly blunt criterion for triage, with the unvaccinated deemed “not worth saving”?</p>
<p>In theory, transplants can be deemed a special case because of scarcity, where we demand stricter requirements for triage. </p>
<p>Transplants might well lead us down a slippery slope where other medical services are also denied to unvaccinated citizens.</p>
<p>For instance, there is already discussion among US doctors about refusing to treat unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, because it is their own fault for not protecting themselves.</p>
<p>This, of course, is overly simplistic. A vaccinated person may also behave irresponsibly, by flouting restrictions and taking liberties in socialising in large groups, and even end up with COVID-19. </p>
<p>But once we start evaluating patients’ moral choices, where do we draw the line?</p>
<p>We need, therefore, to maintain the prevailing principle that in healthcare we do not deprioritise patients based on moral choices. This is important for any society striving for justice and equity. </p>
<p>Further differentiation in how unvaccinated citizens are treated may cause further intolerance and neglect. It would, arguably, be a disproportionate penalty for what is still a free choice.</p>
<h2>DE-ESCALATING VACCINE TENSION</h2>
<p>Hence, the question of making organ transplants conditional on COVID-19 vaccination status is a matter requiring prudent judgement and careful weighing of both sides.</p>
<p>While the desire to maximise clinical outcomes with limited donor organs is good, we cannot escape the wider societal context that COVID-19 vaccines are still a highly politically-charged matter. </p>
<p>Vaccination status is taking a toll on our families and friendships.</p>
<p>The move to make certain civic freedoms dependent on an individual’s healthcare choice can breed resentment among the unvaccinated and generate false expectations among others regarding the purpose of vaccines.</p>
<p>This means mass vaccination, though still an indispensable public health tool, will not snuff out the virus completely. Many of us, even if vaccinated, will still have a good chance of catching COVID-19 over time.</p>
<p>In such a case, it might then be reasonable to introduce COVID-19 vaccines as a requirement in specific medical scenarios with scarce medical resources, like donor organs. </p>
<p>But to do so now may lead to unintended effects of increasing inequality. Amid the damage COVID-19 has already had to mental health and livelihoods, that is something we should be wary of. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Stress can make you stronger if you learn to identify when extra attention is needed </h1>
<div> <p>We may feel our stress levels rising during this pandemic but remembering it’s a normal biological reaction to challenging situations can give us perspective, says the Institute for Mental Health's CEO Daniel Fung.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Daniel Fung </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The last few weeks have seen growing apprehension as the cases of serious COVID-19 infections and deaths rise nationally. </p>
<p>At our hospital, the national institution for the mentally unwell, we have faced our own coronavirus outbreak. </p>
<p>The anxiety over whether we could cope with the numbers, which rose rapidly for patients and the staff around them, had my heart pounding every time I thought of the situation. </p>
<p>This is stress. Stress is the internal reaction to threats to the status quo. </p>
<h2>WHEN STRESS BECOMES TOXIC</h2>
<p>While stress has been thought of as something destructive that we struggle with and makes us ill, it plays a critical, even healthy, role in preparing our minds and bodies for a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Yes, toxic stress can take a toll on our minds and bodies when extreme emotions and symptoms take over, continue for a long time and begin to extend beyond an individual’s control. </p>
<p>It’s the same way your body strives to regulate body temperature when you catch a fever or how your stomach maintains its acidic juices.</p>
<p>But like suffering from a long bout of a pernicious virus, longstanding chronic stress can change your biological response. Overloading of your system can lead to a nervous breakdown and physical illness.</p>
<h2>WHEN STRESS IS NORMAL AND WHEN IT ISN’T</h2>
<p>The reality is that most stress is neither good nor bad. These feelings merely set up a physiological response in our bodies to cope with it.</p>
<p>The study of stress started with a medical researcher Hans Selye in the 1930s tinkering with rats and observing their hormonal changes when “stressed” with unpleasant environmental manipulation such as drastic changes to temperatures. </p>
<p>His discovery led the application of this understanding to humans and that the body’s physiological responses after exposure to a variety of stressors can make a person sick if they remain in a persistent state of heightened stress. </p>
<p>However, the body and the brain try to return to the status quo first by using internal body-wide mechanisms to establish control. </p>
<p>When there is a sensing of danger, we breathe faster, allowing more oxygen to get into our blood stream. Our heart pumps harder to get this oxygen delivered to all vital organs. </p>
<p>On the other hand, humans, tend to subject themselves to long-term stress, by over worrying and continuing to subject the body and mind to the stress response. </p>
<p>The immediate dangers are often prolonged in constant worrying and looking out for signs of trouble. This normal physiological response to acute stress becomes prolonged andcan result in peptic ulcer disease. </p>
<p>For example, in a rating scale of student stress, the stress of an increased workload and having a new boyfriend or girlfriend had the same weightage. Yet, young people don’t shy away from relationships just because they are stressful. </p>
<div>When does work cross the line? And do office workers have a "right to disconnect"? HR experts explain how Singapore's soul-searching on work has thrown up both curveballs and surprising compromises on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:</div>
<h2>HOW STRESS HELPS BUILD RESILIENCE</h2>
<p>What distinguishes good stress from bad ones is how it affects people. Good, tolerable stress tends to motivate us and keep us alert to things around us, reaping positive outcomes such as motivating students to study for exams.</p>
<p>Such forms of stress help develop resilience. A well-known study of Romanian children adopted from neglectful and abusive situations go on to have a variety of outcomes. </p>
<p>Some do badly while others do well despite having similar stressful childhoods. Resilience is the result of recovering from stress and becoming stronger. </p>
<p>This overwhelms our natural coping mechanisms and we can succumb to its severe effects. </p>
<h2>WE NEED TO PROTECT OURSELVES FROM STRESS</h2>
<p>Like the COVID-19 vaccine which protects us from SARS-COV-2, we need a type of inoculation to protect us from novel but toxic stress. </p>
<p>Studies around mental resilience show three main ways we can build our defences against the detrimental effects of stress to bounce back from difficult experiences.</p>
<p>First, understanding ourselves better, knowing what our strengths and weaknesses are as well as how we feel about ourselves. </p>
<p>The introduction of social emotional learning into the curriculum in schools so that every child has the necessary skills to negotiate social situations and relationships beyond the family is underway and will evolve further in 2022. </p>
<p>Second, focusing on our relationships with others, starting with the family and then extending to our friends and colleagues, helps us build stronger connections to people around us who we can seek help from. </p>
<p>In a study of family resilience, we were able to show that family resilience results in individual resilience. </p>
<p>Third, we should encourage our personal development, and establish interests, hobbies and ways we achieve a personal sense of meaning and purpose. </p>
<p>This is in fact one of the sustainable development goals of the United Nations, that of “ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all ages”.</p>
<p>Creating supportive community ecosystems that encourage the social compact, neighbourliness, and love for one another can be facilitated by the teaching of emotional literacy in schools and workplaces.</p>
<p>Emotion regulation, problem solving, mindfulness, interpersonal skills and even stress management training are competencies that can be built on the foundational values of care and concern for one another. </p>
<p>We can take small steps to remind ourselves of our incredible fortitude and fortunes. </p>
<p>In my regular chats with staff, I ask them who they go to for help and invariably, they point to the colleagues around them. </p>
<p>And then I realise, what doesn’t kill you will indeed make you stronger. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Having a pet is not all sunshine and rainbows, it’s hard work </h1>
<div> <p>Recent stories of pets being sold or abandoned for behavioural reasons are puzzling to anyone who understands animal behaviour, says SPCA’s Jaipal Singh Gill.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jaipal Singh Gill </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: You don’t need to have a pet to know that chewing, barking or meowing, jumping and digging, pooing and peeing are all perfectly natural animal behaviours.</p>
<p>The animals were ditched very soon after they were obtained. The purported reason? Their behaviour – the kittens were “hyperactive” and made noises that “stressed out” the woman, while the dog had scratched the man’s sofa and barked non-stop.</p>
<p>Why should anyone be surprised kittens are active and love to play or that dogs chew items around the house? </p>
<p>Yet every day, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) Singapore receives requests to take in pets who are no longer wanted.</p>
<h2>DOGS THAT DON’T BARK, SHED OR BITE?</h2>
<p>Believe it or not, potential adopters have asked us for a fully-trained dog that doesn’t bark, shed fur or bite.</p>
<p>Short of getting a virtual pet, there appears to be a huge mismatch between the expectations and realities of keeping one in the flesh.</p>
<p>But why should we blame the animals when we humans have taken them into an artificial environment and speak to them in a language they cannot understand? </p>
<p>A big part of the problem is a lack of understanding and knowledge about the animal’s biology, perhaps reinforced by social media. It’s common to see many more cute pet videos, pictures and memes than depictions of harsher realities. </p>
<p>Some people forget our responsibility of training animals in a way they understand and tending to their health. Others start off trying their best, but lose patience when training takes longer than expected. </p>
<p>There are no quick fixes. Each animal learns and develops at a different pace - one dog may toilet train within days, another might take weeks.</p>
<h2>REALITY OF KEEPING PETS NOT ALWAYS FUN</h2>
<p>A pet relies fully on us for almost everything and are at our mercy. This is a heavy responsibility that should never be taken lightly or underestimated. </p>
<p>Some get certain dog breeds without realising they were historically bred as high-energy working dogs and need a lot of exercise. You’re going to have to walk a sheepdog much longer and farther than a pug.</p>
<p>You can expect a host of behavioural problems if there is no suitable outlet for the animal to expend physical and mental energy.</p>
<p>If a “problem” behaviour like excessive barking develops, the amount of time and energy required increases significantly. Months of hard work may help resolve it, sometimes it must be managed for life.</p>
<p>Some may try to short-cut the process, perhaps by beating the animal every time it barked. But this doesn’t teach the animal what it’s expected to do and can lead to side effects like aggressive behaviour.</p>
<p>Financial cost, specifically medical costs, is the largest and often overlooked expense in our experience. </p>
<p>Sudden and large vet bills have been known to shock many after an unexpected illness or accident - surgery to repair a broken leg can cost between S$3,000 to S$5,000 - and few people consider pet insurance. </p>
<p>And then there is the emotional toll of caring for a sick or ageing pet, when they no longer have the energy or ability to interact with us and provide the level of companionship we’re used to.</p>
<h2>THINGS CAN GO TERRIBLY WRONG</h2>
<p>It’s almost always the animal that suffers because of this mismatch of expectations and realities of us humans.</p>
<p>Many approach SPCA to take in pets they no longer want. Such separation can cause emotional distress to an animal.</p>
<p>Abandonment, where animals are released and left to fend for themselves, occurs more often than we might imagine. Some die or may suffer before being rescued by kind folks.</p>
<p>It’s sad to think that relinquishing a pet might not even be the worst outcome. </p>
<p>And then there is outright cruelty and abuse, usually when someone is too frustrated with something the animal is doing. </p>
<h2>PETS AREN’T FOR EVERYONE </h2>
<p>Of course, there are many incredible people who provide loving homes for their pets. But the realities of having a pet need to be spoken about so that we discourage those not ready to face them.</p>
<p>Animals have complex physical and psychological needs. We humans must fully commit to the tremendous responsibility when we decide to bring a pet into our care - one that must last for the animal’s lifetime. </p>
<p>We must start to share not only the ups but also the downs of our lives with pets. It would also help to have a community to support people facing specific problems as we can learn from someone who has gone through a similar situation.</p>
<p>Our companion animals give us so much of unconditional love. It is only right we do our very best for them in return.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Angsty and irritable? It could be your poor diet </h1>
<div> <p>The increasing "emotional, non-rational, even explosive remarks" may be linked to modern unhealthy diets, say researchers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Bonnie Kaplan </a> <a> Julia J Rucklidge </a> </div> </div>
<p>What's going on? This escalation in angry rhetoric is sometimes attributed to social media. But are there other influences altering communication styles?</p>
<p>As researchers in the field of nutrition and mental health, and authors of The Better Brain, we recognise that many in our society experience brain hunger, impairing their cognitive function and emotion regulation.</p>
<h2>ULTRA-PROCESSED PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>Obviously, we are not deficient in macronutrients: North Americans tend to get sufficient protein, fats (though usually not the best fats) and carbohydrates (usually not the good complex carbs).</p>
<p>But we are being cheated of micronutrients (minerals and vitamins), particularly in those whose food choices are dominated by ultra-processed products.</p>
<p>Ultra-processed products include things like soft drinks, packaged snacks, sweetened breakfast cereal and chicken nuggets.</p>
<p>They generally contain only trivial amounts of a few micronutrients unless they are fortified, but even then, only a few at higher amounts.</p>
<p>Three published analyses from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey and the 2018 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey revealed these sobering statistics:</p>
<h2>MICRONUTRIENTS AND MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS</h2>
<p>The scientific evidence base for this statement is now vast, though it is so rarely mentioned in the media that few in the public are familiar with it.</p>
<p>A dozen studies from countries like Canada, Spain, Japan and Australia have shown that people who eat a healthy, whole foods diet have fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than people who eat a poor diet (mostly ultra-processed products).</p>
<p>Correlational studies cannot prove that nutritional choices are the cause of mental health problems.</p>
<p>For that we turn to some compelling prospective longitudinal studies in which people with no apparent mental health problems enter the study, are evaluated for their health and dietary patterns, and are then followed over time.</p>
<p>Some of the results have been astonishing.</p>
<p>It follows that nutrition education ought to be one of the first lines of treatment for children in this situation.</p>
<p>A Mediterranean-style diet is typically high in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, seafood and unsaturated fats such as olive oil.</p>
<p>In one such study, about one-third of the people who changed to a whole foods diet in addition to their regular treatment found their depression to be in remission after 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The remission rate in the control group using regular treatment but no diet changes was fewer than one in 10. The whole foods diet group also reported a cost savings of about 20 per cent in their weekly food budget.</p>
<p>This final point helps to dispel the myth that eating a diet of ultra-processed products is a way to save money.</p>
<p>Important evidence that irritability, explosive rage and unstable mood can be resolved with improved micronutrient intake comes from studies evaluating micronutrient supplements to treat mental health problems.</p>
<p>Most public awareness is restricted to the ill-fated search for magic bullets: Studies of a single nutrient at a time. That is a common way to think about causality (for problem X, you need medication Y), but that is not how our brains work.</p>
<p>To support brain metabolism, our brains require at least 30 micronutrients to ensure the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, as well as breaking down and removing metabolic byproducts.</p>
<p>The evidence is clear: A well-nourished population is better able to withstand stress. Hidden brain hunger is one modifiable factor contributing to emotional outbursts, aggression and even the loss of civility in public discourse.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why you should moderate your coffee intake </h1>
<div> <p>Contrary to popular belief, consuming coffee in large quantities in certain ways can damage your health, according to UK nutritionists.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Charlotte Mills </a> <a> Ashley Hookings </a> </div> </div>
<p>READING, England: You’ve probably heard it before: Drinking coffee is good for your health.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that drinking a moderate amount of coffee is associated with many health benefits, including a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>But while these associations have been demonstrated many times, they don’t actually prove that coffee reduces disease risk. In fact, proving that coffee is good for your health is complicated.</p>
<h2>MORE TO COFFEE THAN CAFFEINE</h2>
<p>While caffeine is the most well-known compound in coffee, there is more to coffee than caffeine. Here are a few of the other compounds found in coffee that might affect your health.</p>
<p>Alkaloids. Aside from caffeine, trigonelline is another important alkaloid found in coffee. Trigonelline is less researched than caffeine, but research suggests that it may have health benefits, such as reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Polyphenols. Some research shows that these compounds, which are found in many plants, including cocoa and blueberries, are good for your heart and blood vessels, and may help to prevent neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s.</p>
<p>Coffee predominantly contains a class of polyphenols called chlorogenic acids.</p>
<p>Diterpenes. Coffee contains two types of diterpenes – cafestol and kahweol – that make up coffee oil, the natural fatty substance released from coffee during brewing. Diterpenes may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Melanoidins. These compounds, which are produced at high temperatures during the roasting process, give roasted coffee its colour and provide the characteristic flavour and aroma of coffee.</p>
<p>They may also have a prebiotic effect, meaning they increase the amount of beneficial bacteria in your gut, which is important for overall health.</p>
<h2>HEALTH BENEFITS DEPEND ON HOW COFFEE IS GROWN, MADE</h2>
<p>The way your coffee is grown, brewed and served can all affect the compounds your coffee contains and hence the health benefits you might see.</p>
<p>First, growing conditions can affect the levels of caffeine and chlorogenic acids the coffee contains. For example, coffee grown at high altitudes will have both lower caffeine and chlorogenic acid content.</p>
<p>The two types of coffee beans, arabica and robusta, have also been shown to have different caffeine, chlorogenic acid and trigonelline levels, although neither type has been shown to be more beneficial to health.</p>
<p>Processing will also affect the coffee’s chemical composition. For example, some coffee is decaffeinated. This is typically done before roasting, and depending on the decaffeination method, it may further affect other compounds.</p>
<p>For example, small levels of chlorogenic acids are lost during the decaffeination process.</p>
<p>The extent that coffee is roasted is also key. The more severe the roasting, the more melanoidins formed (and the more intense the flavour). But this lowers chlorogenic acids and trigonelline content.</p>
<p>In the UK, instant coffee is the most commonly consumed type of coffee. This is typically freeze-dried. Research shows that instant coffee contains higher levels of melanoidins per serving compared with filter coffee and espresso.</p>
<p>How you prepare your coffee will also affect its chemical composition. For example, boiled coffee contains a higher level of diterpenes compared with filter coffee.</p>
<p>Other factors – such as the amount of coffee used, how finely it was ground, water temperature and cup size – will also affect the coffee’s chemical composition.</p>
<p>Every compound has different effects on your health, which is why the way coffee is produced and brewed can be important.</p>
<p>Chlorogenic acids, for example, are thought to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by improving the function of your arteries.</p>
<p>There’s also evidence they may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by controlling blood sugar spikes after eating.</p>
<p>On the other hand, diterpenes have been shown to increase levels of low-density lipoprotein, a type of cholesterol associated with cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>While less research has focused on trigonelline and melanoidins, some evidence suggests both may be good for your health.</p>
<p>Adding cream, sugar and syrup will change the nutritional content of your cup. Not only will they increase the calorie content, they may also increase your intake of saturated fats and sugars.</p>
<p>Both of these are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease and may counter the beneficial effects of the other compounds your cup of coffee contains.</p>
<p>There’s also evidence that people may respond differently to some of these compounds. Regularly drinking three to four cups of coffee daily has been shown to build tolerance to the blood pressure raising effects of caffeine.</p>
<p>Genetics may also play a role in how your body handles caffeine and other compounds.</p>
<p>Increasing evidence also points to the gut microbiome as an important factor in determining what health effects coffee may have.</p>
<p>For example, some research suggests the gut microbes play an important role in chlorogenic acid metabolism, and hence may determine if they will benefit your health or not.</p>
<p>Researchers need to conduct large studies to confirm the findings of these smaller studies, which seem to show that coffee is good for your health. But in the meantime, minimise the sugar and cream you use in your coffee.</p>
<p>And if you’re in good health and aren’t pregnant, continue to take a moderate approach to coffee consumption, choosing filter coffee where possible.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why everyone is talking about Squid Game and identifying with it </h1>
<div> <p>The global hit Netflix series taps into the anxieties and attitudes many of us have experienced during the COVID-19 crisis, says Christian Barker.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Christian Barker </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Imagine if Quentin Tarantino devised a deadly competition to be played on sets from a classic Stanley Kubrick film in costumes designed by a demented Teletubby given free rein in an Adidas factory — and you have Squid Game. </p>
<p>Speaking at a conference in late September, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed Squid Game was “number one in the world, like, everywhere in the world”. </p>
<p>There’s “a very good chance (Squid Game) is going to be our biggest show ever,” he added of the show, which at the time of this commentary’s writing, had been watched by more than 111 million households worldwide, according to Netflix’s claims.</p>
<h2>SQUID GAME REFLECTS OUR COVID-19 GAME OF LIFE</h2>
<p>That a Korean television series has ascended swiftly as one of the “must watch” shows across the globe should hardly come as a shock.</p>
<p>Considering Bong Joon-ho’s Best Picture win for Parasite at the Oscars last year, and with the likes of BTS and Blackpink dominating music charts internationally, it’s clear: This is the era of Asian soft power.</p>
<p>With the silver screen and radio waves conquered, it was only a matter of time before the Korean influence arrived on our televisions. Yet it’s too simplistic to think this was a lucky stroke, riding on viewers’ superficial awareness of K-culture.</p>
<p>There is something about Squid Game’s theme of personal struggles and unlikely friendships against the backdrop of massive uncertainty and impossible tasks that is striking a chord in these pandemic times. </p>
<p>It’s certainly not the kind of show you would watch to indulge in escapism from our COVID-19 reality.</p>
<p>Maybe we see our omnipresent COVID-related worries about what tomorrow will bring reflected in the idea that players in Squid Game have no clue what game they will play next or what fate will befall them. </p>
<p>But the message of hope the show offers in moments when some players choose to be kind and selfless, setting aside their fears to work together and are rewarded is welcomed. </p>
<p>Comforting stuff, for a world wearied by the pandemic and yearning for human connection. </p>
<h2>POWERFUL, TIMELESS NARRATIVE OF THE PURSUIT OF MATERIAL WEALTH</h2>
<p>These themes of downward mobility and inequality were also at the heart of Parasite and Bong’s earlier movie Snowpiercer, depicting the pain of poverty and loss. </p>
<p>As the organiser puts it in the final episode: “Do you know what someone with no money has in common with someone with too much money? Living is no fun for them.”</p>
<p>Perhaps like contestants in the show, this pursuit of success can feel like a technicolour joke, with all of us walking around in brightly coloured, endless Penrose staircases to the tune of the Blue Danube after every round.</p>
<h4> <div>How far can passion go for Singapore filmmakers when cinema showings have plummeted and filming greatly challenged by COVID-19? Veteran filmmakers tell us on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:</div> </h4>
<h2>WE ALL FEEL LIKE PLAYERS IN SQUID GAME</h2>
<p>Then again, the dystopic competition category of movies is something we’re already well acquainted with, after watching the Hunger Games and Westworld. </p>
<p>So what sets Squid Game apart? Doesn’t it feel similar to recent Asian survival genre films like Alice in Borderland?</p>
<p>Indeed, Hwang readily admitted to Variety he was inspired by Kinji Fukasaku’s 2000 cult classic movie Battle Royale and its source manga material, where a group of school-uniformed Japanese teens are forced to viciously fight to the death. </p>
<p>But he wanted Squid Game to be more character-driven and focused on their journey.</p>
<p>Does he make it? If you haven’t managed to catch the show thus far, we won’t spoil the ending for you. Suffice to say, despite their newfound wealth, the “winner” is left an empty, traumatised shell of their former self after the games conclude.</p>
<p>As the game organiser points out in the final episode, highlighting the role of self-determination in the game of life: “I never forced you to play. It was your choice.”</p>

<h1> Commentary: Buy Now Pay Later - can we buy it all with instalment plans without worry? </h1>
<div> <p>Installment payment may appear more manageable to some younger consumers, but it takes little for debt to add up and spiral out of control, says Credit Counselling Singapore’s Tan Huey Min.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tan Huey Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>Mdm Lim’s story is familiar to us at Credit Counselling Singapore (CCS). The top reasons for indebtedness we commonly hear from borrowers is overspending, supporting a family and a drop in household income.</p>
<p>And with good deals hawked in the perpetual cycle of online sales events, like 10.10 and 11.11, it’s easy to overspend if we aren’t mindful. </p>
<p>After all, isn’t buying on credit or instalments – with credit cards or Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) schemes - a convenient and socially accepted way to buy stuff we can’t pay in full upfront? </p>
<p>Especially when BNPL services are increasingly popular and available at many well-established retailers?</p>
<p>Some numbers appear to suggest that younger people are borrowing too much. </p>
<p>According to Credit Bureau Singapore’s second quarter 2021 report, personal loans have risen almost 20 per cent and credit card delinquency by 4.4 per cent, most significantly among those aged 21 to 29.</p>
<p>But while these may not indicate rising indebtedness among the young now, they may reflect reduced spending during the pandemic amid restrictions on businesses, weddings and travel instead of consumer prudence. </p>
<p>CCS has also not seen an increase in demand for our credit counselling services – or at least not yet. </p>
<h2>DEBT BURDEN CAN BALLOON AND SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL</h2>
<p>It’s easy to overlook the need to plan and manage our money when we assume using credit cards and other products that make our spending more manageable should do the trick.</p>
<p>Unpaid credit card balances will also attract high interest charges of about 25 per cent. Miss a payment or repay only the minimum sum and we attract late fee or interest charges that we didn’t consider when making our purchase.</p>
<p>And did we consider when buying a new computer on instalment, that we already have several ongoing instalment payments from earlier purchases staking their claim on our salary?</p>
<p>Worse, imagine having to juggle all these and suddenly running into cashflow problems, if you’re in a sector still reeling from the effects of COVID-19 rules, like FB and tourism.</p>
<h2>THE ATTRACTION OF BUY NOW, PAY LATER</h2>
<p>How about new interest-free BNPL plans that allow instalment payments for small-value consumer goods?</p>
<p>For many new to the workforce wielding their first salaries, BNPL may amplify a newfound sense of purchasing power. </p>
<p>An October 2020 survey by Singapore-based consumer research firm Milieu Insights found that 38 per cent of Singaporeans had used a BNPL service. </p>
<p>But 27 per cent also felt they were worse off financially due to a BNPL mistake, which includes making impulse purchases, buying more expensive items than they otherwise would have bought and overstretching one’s finances.</p>
<p>BNPL schemes currently fall outside MAS regulations, though the regulatory agency has said it is looking at the need to do so as they could lead to excessive consumer borrowing, especially among youth and impulsive buyers.</p>
<p>But it won’t be surprising to see more BNPL offerings come our way, given the benefits that retailers have observed in terms of increased sales and decreased online cart abandonment, according to fintech and payment news sites.</p>
<h2>NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PROPER PLANNING AND CONSUMER EDUCATION</h2>
<p>Ultimately, new credit products will continually change the way consumers spend, just as credit cards have done. </p>
<p>But buying today and paying many days later may further dissociate the immediate gratification from the cost one needs to pay in some distant future.</p>
<p>So no matter if it’s BNPL or any other delayed payment mode, consumers – young and old – must carefully weigh the perceived benefits against the potential costs.</p>
<p>Take the first step to consider whether we really need the item, whether we have budgeted for it, and how we can limit impulsive unbudgeted purchase - lowering existing credit limits or holding fewer credit cards.</p>
<p>Then, assess our financial capacity to take on new commitment, especially if it requires a new instalment plan on top of existing ones. </p>
<p>And if we do buy on instalment, remember to make prompt payment to avoid late charges. It can be as simple as setting phones reminders before scheduled payment dates.</p>
<p>There is no free lunch when it comes to buying anything via instalment and no better way to avoid the angst of debt problems by being an informed and prudent consumer.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Online grocery shopping cannot beat the pleasure of visiting supermarkets </h1>
<div> <p>Online food and grocery delivery has been nothing short of a godsend during the pandemic. But they cannot replicate the sheer joy of traversing down the aisle of a supermarket or wet market, says cookbook author Pamelia Chia.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Pamelia Chia </a> </div> </div>
<p>The book was published in 2004. How much has changed since then. </p>
<p>This transformation in the way that we shop looks like it is here to stay with all major supermarkets ramping up their online delivery systems and manpower.</p>
<p>Even now, the company is looking to continue increasing its capacity through automation and a new warehouse to keep up with the influx in consumer demand. The same scenario is playing out at the other big supermarket names too.</p>
<p>Like so many, I had never ordered groceries online. But the lockdown in April last year compelled my husband and me to try. </p>
<p>While certainly convenient, it was not without its glitches. Some items we ordered were unavailable and swapped out for another item at the store, something I can foresee a picky eater or cook being unhappy about. </p>
<p>Another downside was the sheer amount of packaging involved – on top of the original packaging of each individual ingredient were the plastic bags they were placed in. There was no way to opt out of this from what we saw on the website. </p>
<p>And based on anecdotal evidence, you may not get the times you want for delivery slots. So a lot of forward planning is required to ensure you have what you need, when you need it.</p>
<p>But beyond these factors, there was a simple reason why that was the last time we ordered our groceries online - I missed the experience and little luxuries that going to markets and supermarkets afforded.</p>
<h2>THE JOY OF SUPERMARKET SHOPPING</h2>
<p>Friends sometimes ask if I shop with a list and the answer is both "yes" and "no". Most of the time, I step into a market with a list in hand, but this is not a list set in stone; it is one that is amenable to what I see and to what is available. </p>
<p>Sometimes I walk by screamingly fresh seafood that just begs to be taken home and cooked. Or fragrant mangoes with sweet sap beading on their skin. These are certainly more inspiring and evocative than sterile images on a screen. </p>
<p>With online shopping, we lose the opportunity to rely on our senses and to respond to what we find. </p>
<p>We never know if the prawns arriving on our doorstep would be plump and smelling of the sea or drab with droopy heads. We leave it all to chance and the food in our kitchen suffers for it.</p>
<p>There is also something to say about the human connections at the market or supermarket. I grew up at Upper Thomson Road, in an estate located right across Lakeview market. My family, like many others in our neighbourhood, had a ritual. </p>
<p>Unlike the hip farmers’ markets of Europe, Singapore’s wet markets are much more hyperlocal, because there is always one or two in each neighbourhood. In a sense, it is a true depiction of what our community is. </p>
<p>You inevitably catch wind of an auntie’s gossip, the croon of old singers coming out of the radio, or the sound of an uncle’s guffaw as he cracks the occasional joke. </p>
<p>The markets are the raw, beating heart of the community where you get a brush of everyday Singaporean culture, beyond the polished grandness of Jewel and Marina Bay Sands. </p>
<p>Many years later, when I wrote my first cookbook, Wet Market to Table, centered around the weird and wonderful produce of the wet market, I learnt to seek the advice of fishmongers and vegetable sellers. </p>
<p>And what unexpected little pleasures we would discover if we would make a visit to our markets. </p>

<div> <p>After two months navigating around just two household guests, reconnecting in larger groups of five is a relief but throws up a new set of challenges, says Karen Tee.</p> </div>

<p>So, when the multi-ministry task force announced on Saturday (Nov 20) that the number of household visitors would be raised once again to five people, our WhatsApp group chat immediately sprung back to life. </p>
<p>After working around everyone’s availabilities – including enviable vaccinated travel lane vacation schedules we haven’t had to contend with for many months - we finally locked a date for this long-awaited feast into our calendars.</p>
<p>This juggling of circles of friends never really ends, does it? </p>
<p>Honestly, I never imagined I’d have to scrutinise a guestlist for a small gathering at home as closely as I would for a grand wedding banquet. </p>
<h2>HEADACHE OF HOSTING PAIRS OF GUESTS</h2>
<p>Since Singapore entered the “Stabilisation Phase” on Sep 27, my other half and I have hosted some friends and family at home in pairs, since socialising at restaurants was out of the question with a two-per-table only regulation.</p>
<p>Still, even though I treasure this government-sanctioned opportunity for quality time, it has certainly been challenging.</p>
<p>Many of us likely only have a limited number of people we feel close enough to invite into our homes for an intimate gathering. </p>
<p>These have to be guests I am fairly confident of sustaining in-depth and meaningful conversations with over the span of a few hours. Such “inner circle” friends are few and far between.</p>
<p>Then, there are long-time close-knit groups of friends such as university mates. Our best diplomatic strategy was needed: Which two do we invite first? How do we ensure the subsequent pairs we host later do not feel slighted? </p>
<p>As much as we think our friendships are immune to such trivial sensitivities, we have all felt the need to navigate carefully during these stressful and uncertain times.</p>
<p>Then there is also the logistical nightmare of having to organise many more gatherings to rotate through different pairs of friends. </p>
<p>The cost of buying food and drink for each gathering has added up quite quickly, without the economies of scale of buying food in bulk for larger groups. </p>
<p>It was tempting at times to stop creating more exhaustion and expense for ourselves. But yearning for human connection has been strong at a time when Zoom meetings and endless work days have created isolation and loneliness. </p>
<h2>COULD FIVE PAX GATHERINGS THROW UP NEW CHALLENGES?</h2>
<p>There’s been this nagging suspicion at the back of my mind that I could be friend number three, four, five – or more to other people, because I haven’t been invited to my friends’ homes these past two months.</p>
<p>So, the relaxation of group sizes is certainly a welcome move for many of us who have missed the easy camaraderie of hanging out with more than one or two friends at once. </p>
<p>I was delighted that practically overnight, my social circle has revived, with my various group chats finally buzzing again.</p>
<p>Of course, there are new issues to navigate now that social sizes have been increased. </p>
<p>That said, I would very much rather count my blessings so I am going to do my best to look forward to the upcoming festivities with those near and dear to me.</p>
<p>After all, there are turkeys to roast, hams to enjoy and mulled wine to brew - all of which are best shared with slightly larger groups of (up to) five guests at a time.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why are people on dating apps so boring and conversations so poor? </h1>
<div> <p>Talking about school life and careers on dating apps is safe, but there are only that few questions you can ask before it resembles a job interview, says writer Natalie Tan.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Natalie Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: “Hey, what’s up?”</p>
<p>“Hi, nothing much, how’s your day?”</p>
<p>That’s right, this is your typical dating-app conversation, and yes, it’s my real experience. And it’s not the only one. </p>
<p>In the pandemic-stricken era of increasing dating app usage, stale conversations and uninspiring interactions seem to be the trend. </p>
<p>It’s 2021 and the realm of dating apps has evolved from an enticing Pandora’s box into a well-trodden plateau.</p>
<p>Cue cookie-cutter profiles, bland biographies, chats that don’t make past (repeated) “how’s your day”, and career or education-related questions. </p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong – there’s nothing wrong with any of them. But when the app is your blank canvas, why are users always painting similar pictures of gym pics, Instagram-filtered selfies, bubble-tea loving and RBF personalities?</p>
<p>As a formerly frequent user of Tinder and OKCupid, with friends still in the dating app game, I’ve had my fair share of experiences and stories.</p>
<h2>CREATURES OF CONFORMITY</h2>
<p>There’s a nexus of reasons, from social features unique to Singapore to individual, dating fatigue – all of them coming together to spur the cog of monotony in the dating arena.</p>
<p>We may apply this rather rigid way of thinking to our approach to meeting new people, even through technology – despite possibilities being endless. </p>
<p>With the lack of explicit rules, we tend to fall back on supposedly fool-proof, formulaic methods. Textbook introductions and conversations revolving around school life and careers are safe and unoffensive, which gently eases us into motion.</p>
<p>But these methods don’t steer the conversational wheels for you. There are only that few questions you can ask before it resembles a job interview.</p>
<p>While talking about one’s education and work is perfectly fine, there’s more to close-ended and short answers. Segueing into the other party’s experiences and passions can help you gain a deeper understanding of the person you’re talking to. </p>
<p>If I had a dollar from every conversation that faded off into silence, like ellipses that trail off into the depths of the wild, I’ll be very rich.</p>
<p>A close friend also shared her eyeroll-worthy conversation, essentially a week’s worth of job complaints, rants, and ... the weather.</p>
<p>But maybe we only remember the poor experiences. Maybe we can cut our potential dates some slack. Some of us are bad at texting or are simply nervous. Others fear revealing more personal (and interesting) information too early on.</p>
<p>Now that restrictions on dining have been lifted again, maybe it’s time to let that conversation come to a head and go for that date. </p>
<h2>COMMITMENT-PHOBES APLENTY</h2>
<p>However, not everyone manages to reach the date stage, when signs of faltering connection can show early. </p>
<p>Late replies, draggy conversations and ghosting are unfortunately par for the course on dating apps. Out-of-sync replies define mobile communication – a boon for those not looking to commit, but a bane for those searching for something serious.</p>
<p>According to a September 2020 Rakuten survey on the reasons Singaporeans use mobile dating apps, about half cited convenience, as conversations are easy to start and stop as and when they please.</p>
<p>Boredom is another factor for 35 per cent of users – which may explain why so many seem uninterested in taking things further.</p>
<p>It’s a pity when you seem to hit it off, only to have such riveting conversations come to an anti-climactic end. </p>
<p>I guess no matter how wide the overlaps of interests – in drinking, Netflix shows and even in each other’s jobs – the glow won’t endure when the bigger pieces don’t gel. </p>
<p>Even the sweet memory of evening talks by the Singapore River and foosball games at a date’s co-working space can feel like that time you had this wonderful bowl of Swensen’s Earthquake all by yourself.</p>
<p>It makes a heck of a good story but it’s not something you’ll do again. There might have been a spark but that’s all it’ll be when intentions and goals aren’t aligned. </p>
<p>Singles are all too familiar with the pressure to get into relationships, fuelled by social norms, impatient families and #relationshipgoals posts on social media.</p>
<p>We hinge on the efficiency of swiping to find The One, but after going through so many profiles, it just gets too much.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to commit to knowing each match and giving them all your attention. Evaluating someone’s romantic compatibility over a few texts and dates facilitates shallow interactions – the reason for your boring experiences.</p>
<p>And putting yourself out there is exhausting, because it is work: Curating your profile, the selection process in the swiping, the effort to keep chats going.</p>
<p>Eventually, we burn out. The more selfish of us leave wisps of smoke in ghosting others. </p>
<p>I myself fell prey to this paradox of choice, and went through the vicious cycle of deleting and reinstalling dating apps, before I decided I needed a thorough break.</p>

<h1> Commentary: How many shoppers can Orchard Road’s Christmas light-up lure back? </h1>
<div> <p>Festive lights along Orchard Road are a great way to bring on the holiday spirit. But Singapore’s premier shopping strip must continue offering unique retail experiences to attract shoppers, says Karen Tee.</p> </div>
