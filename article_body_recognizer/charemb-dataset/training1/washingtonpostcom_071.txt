<header><div/><div><div><a>Politics</a></div></div><div><h1>Ashli Babbitt a martyr? Her past tells a more complex story</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Michael Biesecker | AP</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 11:54 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>WASHINGTON — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Terrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.</p></div></div>
<a>taped a posthumous birthday</a> greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.
<div><div><p>But the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included <a>videos</a> of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Among Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Key to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That is not how Norris felt about her.</p></div></div>
<p>“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”</p>
<div><div><p>When she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Norris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.</p></div></div>
<div><p>When the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.</p></div>
<div><p>After Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Norris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Court records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.</p></div></div>
<a>public testimony</a> of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.
<p>Aaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”</p>
<div><div><p>“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.</p></div></div>
<a>televised interview</a> in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.
<a>cleared Byrd of wrongdoing</a> in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.

<p>“That choice doesn’t seem so tough to me,” Kimmel said. “Vaccinated person having a heart attack? Yes, come right in, we’ll take care of you. Unvaccinated guy who gobbled horse goo? Rest in peace, wheezy.”</p>

<div><p>“But I came here from California,” Hanks continued. “And if you think I’m going to fly 3,000 miles and not be on TV, well, you got another thing coming. And I am not alone! Isn’t that right, Tina?”</p></div>
<div><p>With that, former SNL star and head writer Tina Fey joined him. “Yes, I am here,” she announced. “And this is not the smallest audience I have ever performed before, because I have done improv in a Macy’s.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Hanks noted that Fey was<i> also</i> a five-timer. “Thank you for joining me,” he said. “As you know, I started the five-timers club.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Oh, like you <a>started covid</a>!” Fey shot back.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>They enlisted Kenan Thompson, <a>the longest-tenured</a> cast member, to honor Rudd with his five-timer jacket. Steve Martin and Martin Short were beamed in with a simultaneous congratulatory and insulting message.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Thompson assured viewers that they were still going to air a great show, though it would be composed of pretaped sketches, while Fey added that they would show their personal favorites from earlier episodes.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s going to be a little bit like that new <a>Beatles documentary</a>,” Rudd explained. “A lot of old footage but enough new stuff that you’re like, ‘Okay, I’ll watch that.’”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Hanks, Fey, Thompson, Che and Rudd gathered at the end, all wearing masks, to bid viewers farewell. Rudd also gave a shout-out to Charli XCX for rehearsing so much for a performance that never happened.</p></div></div>
