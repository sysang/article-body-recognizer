<h1>Real estate websites don't include crime data from property listings due to 'racial bias'</h1>
<h2>Redfin claims that consumers are more interested in 'safety' and not 'crime'</h2>
<h2>Real estate market impacted by supply chain issues and labor shortages</h2>
<p>National Association of Home Builders CEO Jerry Howard weighs in on the supply chain and labor shortages in the real estate market and how it impacts consumers.</p>
<p><a>Real estate</a> websites will not include crime data on property listings, claiming that they include "racial bias."</p>
<p>Redfin and Realtor.com both made the announcement on Dec. 13 that they would steer away from including data on crime in the neighborhoods of property listings on their websites.</p>
<a>Redfin</a>, said that a data source that the company considered using for crime data was the National Crime Victimization Survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, but said that such surveys risked including "racial bias."

<p>Taubman added that crime data doesn't "speak accurately" to the question that buyers have about safety in a given neighborhood, and said that there's "too great a risk of this inaccuracy reinforcing racial bias."</p>
<p>In addition, Taubman claimed that people are interested in "safety" and not "crime."</p>
<p>He said that people define safety in different ways, and claimed it "doesn’t line up very well with purely crime-based data."</p>

<p>BETTER.COM CEO TELLS ABOUT 900 EMPLOYEES THEY’VE BEEN LET GO DURING PRE-HOLIDAY ZOOM CALL: REPORT</p>
<p>David Doctorow, the chief executive officer for Realtor.com said that the move was made as an effort to "rethink" safety information that is shared on the website.</p>
<p>He added that Realtor.com would be working to "examine closely" what neighborhood safety means to consumers so the website can "reimagine how we integrate safety data on Realtor.com."</p>

<p>Doctorow also encouraged the real estate industry as a whole to rethink how neighborhoods are characterized, stating that the industry uses metrics that penalize communities of color.</p>
<p>"Historically, our industry has rated neighborhoods using metrics that unfairly penalize communities of color. We can all do a better job explaining the facts in a way that does not unfairly penalize neighborhoods, towns and cities," he said.</p>

<div> <div><div> <p>Home prices are surging, rising nearly 20% in September. But experts say the pace of increase is slowing. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>Home sales prices continue to surge, rising 19.5% annually in September, according to the latest <a><u>SP CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index report</u></a>. But despite this increase, some experts say home price growth is beginning to slow.</p>
<p>George Ratiu, Realtor.com's manager of economic research, added that the slowdown was aided by fewer homebuyers searching for new homes. He said that competition among buyers lessened, and mortgage rates rose.</p>
<a>Freddie Mac’s 30-year fixed loan</a> moving from 2.87% at the start of September to 3.01% by the end of the month, curbing buyers’ ability to bid up prices," Ratiu said.
<p>Current homeowners can take advantage of increased home values by taking out a cash-out refinance while interest rates are at historic lows. <a>Visit Credible to find your personalized mortgage interest rate</a> and see how much you could save.</p>

<p>The pro-bono clinic provides legal support to former service members seeking an upgrade or correction to their military discharge status. After hearing Spencer's story, the students decided to take on his case. </p>
<p>In 1969, Spencer was just 20 years old when he was sent overseas to South Vietnam where he served as an Army armored reconnaissance specialist in the infantry for over a year, according to the UNC School of Law. </p>
<p>During that time, the African American serviceman faced both physical and emotional distress from getting stuck in the neck by shrapnel and battling racism and discrimination from his own command, according to the university. </p>

<p>"I was given civilian clothes and sent to the airport and waited for a standby flight," the veteran told UNC. "When I had gotten to Washington, I began to feel like I was some kind of criminal." </p>
<p>He was denied veterans benefits and was never awarded a Combat Infantryman Badge, Vietnam War Cross and Purple Heart, honors to which he was entitled, according to the school. </p>
<p>Spencer hadn't spoken about his other than honorable discharge ever since. However, for the last three years, the UNC law students were determined to help. </p>
<p>John Brooker, a clinical associate professor of law and the director of the program since 2018, said Spencer's story wasn't uncommon.</p>
<p>"We try to get those former service members veteran status," Brooker told the school. </p>
<p>In doing so, "it restores the honor that they felt was taken from them. They were separated with a type of discharge that literally says they don’t have honor," he continued. </p>
<p>The good news finally came earlier this year when they were notified that Spencer will have federal veteran status and full health care benefits. All of his honors were also restored. </p>
<p>It "opens the door to life-saving veteran’s benefits that many should have had all along," Brooker added. </p>

<h4><a>Army-Navy football game celebrates US soldiers, veterans</a></h4>
<p>Singer Lee Greenwood, Warrior Rising co-founder Jason Van Camp and War Metal Forge founder Justin Clapsaddle on the important of patriotism ahead of the Army-Navy matchup.</p>
<p>American <a>veterans</a> took center stage on Saturday morning ahead of the <a>Army-Navy football game</a>, which is happening on Saturday, Dec. 11, in the Meadowlands at Met Life stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Game time is 3 p.m. ET. </p>
<a>Johnny "Joey" Jones</a> spoke to two leaders of veteran-based groups, as well as to
<a>country singer Lee Greenwood</a>, who is performing during the halftime show at the Army-Navy game and is well known for his patriotic hit song, "God Bless the USA."

<p>It provides vets with "opportunities to create sustainable businesses" and more, the group notes on its website.</p>
<p>One example of that is the business run by veteran Justin Clapsaddle, founder of War Metal Forge, a North Carolina-based company that makes custom knives by using metal from vehicles that were involved in battle. </p>
<p><a>VIETNAM VET WANTS OTHERS TO KNOW: ‘YOU ARE NOT ALONE’</a></p>
<p>"These knives are made through various techniques and incorporate metal from vehicles, shrapnel, and rifle barrels that saw actual combat from the Battle of the Bulge to Afghanistan," he notes on the company's website. </p>
<p>"War Metal Forge takes pride is producing knives that are not only functional but timeless historical heirlooms," he adds. </p>

<h1>Want to help our military veterans? Here’s how</h1>
<div> <div><div><p> (John Metz)</p></div></div></div>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>The transition from actively serving in the military to returning to civilian life as a veteran can be challenging.</p>
<p>Active duty provides a sense of consistency and stability by reinforcing routine, working as a team and operating under the motivation of a common goal. Returning home from <a>service</a> typically is a stark contrast.</p>
<p><a>MARINE VETERAN REVEALS SECRETS TO MENTAL TOUGHNESS</a></p>
<p>Veterans struggle with how to continue to be a part of something bigger than themselves. They desire the same sense of purpose and community they have grown so accustomed to. When this shift in lifestyle occurs, some are not sure how to adjust.</p>
<p>This recent development has allowed for the start of a conversation and an opportunity to reflect. It is time that we ask ourselves: How can we collectively help those who have dedicated their lives to help and serve us?</p>
<blockquote><p>Veterans have spent years of their lives putting others before themselves.</p> </blockquote>
<p>I have worked with the Veteran Golfers Association, a strong network of 4,000 veterans and their families who share a common interest. In over four years, the Veteran Golfers Association has not seen one case of suicide.</p>
<p>Communal spaces and physical activities such as this association provides help to bring veterans together, to build relationships and keep them active and connected.</p>
<p>This why it is so important to consider hiring a veteran. The transition into a new career is a common source of unease for veterans who are often unfairly discredited due to employer misconceptions.</p>
<p>Hiring a veteran is a mutually beneficial move for both employers and veterans. The employer gains a structured, motivated, team-oriented worker. The veterans find a new team, a new challenge and a new sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Every first Saturday of the month in Columbus, Ohio we host an event called Rally Point at the National Veterans Memorial and Museum. Most recently, we featured a discussion on navigating veteran’s benefits and employment resources.</p>
<p>There is strength in reaching out to others. Veterans are helpers and strong-willed winners. When they need to be reminded, remind them. When they are qualified for a position, hire them. When they need a space to connect with others, create it.</p>
<p>Veterans have spent years of their lives putting others before themselves. Each day in basic training, each deployment, each moment spent away from their own families has been a testament to how much they value the lives of everyone in this country.</p>
<p>Join us in showing how much we value veterans. The time to act is now.</p>

<h1>At Christmas and all year long, Code of Vets gives back to veterans in need</h1>
<p><a>Christmas</a> is a time when people give thanks and help their fellow neighbors. <a>Military families</a> are no exception.</p>
<p>Some American <a>veterans</a> are in need of a helping hand as the COVID-19 pandemic continues and inflation on household staples takes a chunk out of wallets. That’s where Code of Vets comes in. </p>
<p>The Tennessee-based 501(c)(3) <a>nonprofit</a> has been assisting veterans throughout the country since 2018, according to Code of Vets’ founder Gretchen Smith.</p>
<p><a>WANT TO HELP OUR MILITARY VETERANS? HERE’S HOW</a></p>
<div> <div><p> Code of Vets is a Tennessee-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit that has been assisting veterans throughout the country since October 2018. (Code of Vets)</p></div></div>
<p>In 2020, Code of Vets provided assistance to nearly 2,000 veterans. This year, the organization has received more than 3,500 applications.</p>
<p>Smith and her charity partner Dr. Cindy Walter have a vetting process that helps them narrow down the applications that should take priority, though Smith said she wishes the organization could help every single applicant.</p>
<p>VETERANS MAKING A DIFFERENCE ARE SPOTLIGHTED AHEAD OF ARMY-NAVY FOOTBALL GAME</p>
<p>"We’ve raised well over $5 million with 2% operating costs. Cindy and I do not take paychecks. We have a couple of other people working with us, and we do not pay them. We're an all-volunteer organization," Smith told Fox. </p>
<p>"The money goes to the veterans when they need it," she added. "There are times when we will pay bills directly, but there are times when we send them the funds, and then they screenshot the receipts and send them to us."</p>
<p>Smith and her team keep the public updated about quarterly reports and fundraising missions through the Code of Vets website and social media accounts.</p>

<a>holiday season</a>, the organization is accepting cash donations that will cover basic needs, including groceries, prescription copays, car repairs and preventative evictions or utility disconnections.
<p>"We can alleviate the financial stress our veterans are under for the holidays," Smith said. "We can ensure they have a roof, heat, lights, and food for Christmas."</p>

<p><a>TUCKER CARLSON: BIDEN'S SOUTHERN BORDER POLICY MAY BE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE THING ANY ADMINISTRATION HAS DONE</a></p>
<p>So, is the sheriff doing everything he can to reduce crime in Los Angeles County? He is quick to blame others, but his own policies have also added to the rise in crime. </p>
<blockquote><p>How is releasing a child predator or someone convicted of assault back into the community protecting that community?</p> </blockquote>
<p>There are a number of reasons for rising crime rates. Bail reform laws, no-cash bail, progressive Soros-funded district attorneys, the defunding of police. But sanctuary city policies are also a factor that can’t be ignored. </p>
<p>Politicians and open borders groups claim that sanctuary city policies protect immigrant communities and will help victims and witnesses of crime report such crimes and not be afraid of the police. This is a false narrative. </p>

<p>There have been varying studies about the potential health impacts of cellphone radiation, from the earliest models to the latest 5G handsets, with mixed results.</p>

<h1>Fox News Poll: Fewer believe in COVID vaccine, mandates</h1>
<h2>Voters are split over schools requiring students to be vaccinated</h2>
<p>Most voters continue to believe coronavirus is at least somewhat under control, as support for mandates declines and confidence in the vaccine also falls.</p>
<p>That’s according to the latest Fox News national survey released Thursday.</p>
<a>Democrats</a> and independents and 5 points among Republicans.
<p>Still, far more Democrats (76 percent) than independents (49 percent) or <a>Republicans</a> (45 percent) have faith in the shot.</p>
<p>Compared to the vaccine in general, a smaller 45 percent consider the vaccine safe for children ages 5 to 11. Thirty-eight percent say it is unsafe and 16 percent are unsure.</p>
<p><a>SEVERAL CALIFORNIA CHILDREN SICK AFTER CLINIC ADMINISTERS WRONG COVID VACCINE DOSES</a></p>
<p>Voters are split 48-46 percent over <a>schools</a> requiring students to be vaccinated. This is the first time the Fox News survey asked about vaccinating younger children and requiring it of students.</p>
<p>Fifty-five percent favor vaccine mandates when it comes to teachers, down from 61 percent in September.</p>
<p>On the other hand, 24 percent say the virus is "not at all" under control. That number has been as high as 51 percent in July 2020 and as low as 10 percent in May 2021. </p>
<a>inflation</a> (64 percent concerned) and
<a>supply chain issues</a> (62 percent concerned).
<p><a><u>COVID-19 VACCINATION AND YOUNG CHILDREN: WHAT TO KNOW</u></a></p>
<p>Some 16 percent of Republicans approve of Biden on coronavirus -- down from 37 percent in May. Even so, this is the best rating he gets from the GOP on any issue tested. </p>
<p>The pandemic is also Biden’s best issue among Democrats: 84 percent approve, down from 90 percent six months ago. </p>
<p>Currently, 44 percent of voters approve of Biden’s overall job performance and 54 percent disapprove.</p>
<p>Fifty-one percent of parents believe the COVID vaccine is safe and effective. That’s down from 56 percent in September. </p>
<p>However, by a 7-point margin, they don’t think it’s safe to give the shot to children ages 5 to 11 (38-45 percent). There’s more resistance, by 11 points, among parents with children in that age group. </p>
<p>Parents want the vaccine required for teachers (55 favor-41 oppose), but oppose it for students (43 favor-51 oppose). </p>
