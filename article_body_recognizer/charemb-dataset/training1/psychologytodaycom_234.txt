<p>“Mind over matter” is not simply a catchphrase. It is a truth based on what we know to be fact: that the brain, given the right set of directions, the right environment, and the proper stimuli, will always choose healing over disease.</p>
<a>meditation</a> and guided imagery. By making them a normal part of our lives, they become a buffer that guards against the breakdown of organ systems.

<a>anxiety</a>, hostility, and other negative states affect the immune system.

<h1> The Physical Dangers of Stress </h1>
<h2> Is being stressed out more harmful than you realize? </h2>
<a>lead to anxiety</a>. Stress and
<a>anxiety</a> not only negatively affect your emotional and mental health, but they can also weak havoc on your physical body. Here are some of the most common physical symptoms of stress:
<p>Your heart. Stress causes the heart to speed up. Often, blood pressure increases and your heart seems to be ready to burst out of your chest. This increased demand on the heart can also produce an irregular heartbeat called an arrhythmia.</p>
<a>strains your respiratory system.</a>
<p>Your skin. Stress has a way of returning your skin to a state of <a>adolescence</a>–<a>skin prone to breakouts</a> of rashes, acne, and psoriasis.</p>
<p>Your reproductive system. Chronic stress can result in painful periods and fertility issues. It’s as if your body recognizes “now is not a good time” and reduces your chances for reproduction.</p>
<a>Cortisol causes people to put on excess weight</a>, leading to hypertension and cardiovascular problems.
<p>Your head. Stress is painful, especially when it is manifested in chronic headaches and <a>migraines</a>. Females are almost <a>twice as susceptible</a> to tension headaches than men.</p>
<li>Getting adequate sleep</li>
<li>Spending time with people you enjoy</li>
<li>Scheduling time to focus on your favorite hobbies</li>

<li>Sadness, confusion, irritability, <a>anger</a>, uneasiness, and <a>suicidal</a> thoughts</li>
<li>Reduced <a>concentration</a>, efficiency, and <a>productivity</a></li>
<li>Social withdrawal and isolation</li>
<li>Interpersonal problems (e.g., lies, defensiveness, communication concerns)</li>
<li>Tension (e.g., headaches, jaw clenching, teeth grinding)</li>
<li>Body pain (e.g., headaches, muscle spasms)</li>
<li>Reduced energy (e.g., tiredness, weakness, fatigue)</li>
<li><a>Sleeping</a> problems (e.g., <a>insomnia</a>, nightmares)</li>
<a>Emotional Intelligence</a>, the ability to recognize your emotional state is essential in order to understand and manage your emotions. Therefore, if you skip the phase of acknowledging that you are

<p>Manage what you can; release what you cannot.</p>

<h1> 7 Healthy, Non-Destructive Ways to Cope With Stress </h1>
<h2> Simple ways to manage stress that will make your life better. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: JESHOOTS - com/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Stress brings out the worst in us. Not just the worst behavior (such as being more irritable with others), but also the worst choices.</p>
<p>This “method” of coping with stress is not a very effective one.</p>
<a>Stress eating</a> doesn’t solve anything and typically makes things worse. Other unhealthy responses to stress include shopping, drinking
<p>What are they, for you? And what are the negative consequences, for you?</p>
<p>How about practicing some new responses? Healthier responses that have been proven to help you manage stress, decrease your overall perception of stress, and make your life better (instead of worse)?</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite constructive ways to deal with stress. Have a look through and pick one or two to start using:</p>
<p>1. Do a breathing <a>meditation</a> to induce the "Relaxation Response."</p>
<a>anxious</a> and stressed. I practice this as a daily foundation to keep me calm, grounded, and better able to cope with whatever may come. You can use it at any time when you feel really stressed. For example, if I get some
<a>stressful</a> news, I’ll find a place to sit quietly and do this.
<a>hormones</a> is decreased. Even if you just do this for a few minutes, the calming effects last for up to 24 hours.
<p>2. Go for a brisk walk (or some form of physical activity).</p>
<p>When you’re really upset or stressed, take a time out and go for a walk. Walking off your negative emotions can prevent you from saying or doing something destructive in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be a fancy or formal walk. One night, when I was particularly worried and upset about something, I just walked back and forth along one safe, brightly lit block about twenty times. It helped enormously.</p>
<p>3. Process your stress in a journal.</p>
<p>Stress can take over your mind. Worries run in circles. Free-floating anxieties float around uncontrollably.</p>
<p>When you put a pen to paper and start detailing what’s going on, things really come into perspective. Worries become concrete and perhaps even solvable. I often find that as I write about my stressors, solutions or next steps become clear.</p>
<div> <h2>Stress Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>The Psychology of Stress</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>The Biology of Stress</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>I always feel better after writing things out, even if I haven’t come up with solutions. The process of writing is so grounding and cathartic.</p>
<p>Not everyone can afford or access <a>therapy</a>, but if you have access to counseling—for example, as part of your workplace benefits—I strongly encourage you to get that support.</p>
<p>5. Use food as fuel, not as comfort.</p>
<p>6. Change what you can; let go of what you can’t.</p>
<p>Learn to play a strong mental game. If something is stressing you out, first figure out what you can do about it. Make a simple plan and then implement it, one step at a time.</p>
<p>7. Practice <a>gratitude</a>, especially if stressed.</p>
<a>right brain</a> and back into your practical, list-making left brain.
<p>Focusing on things that you’re grateful for, or making a list of things that are going well in your life (however small or basic), will also improve your sense of well-being and decrease levels of perceived stress.</p>
<p>I encourage you to come up with a customized “stress toolkit” for yourself. Have a look through this list of suggestions, and pick the things that appeal to you most, or those that would be easiest for you to implement.</p>
<p>Think again of the unhelpful stress-relievers you commonly turn to, and decide how you might exchange them for a healthier habit (for example, making a cup of your favorite herbal tea after a tough day, instead of pouring yourself a glass of wine).</p>
<p>Life goes so much better when your coping strategies make things better, instead of making things worse.</p>

<div> <h3> Are there benefits to being a pessimist? </h3> </div>
<a>distrust</a> of others can be a
<a> red flag of burnout</a> at work. Being aware of these problem areas in life makes it possible to change harmful behaviors and adopt a healthier, less cynical attitude.
<div> <h3> Do negative or depressed people see the world more realistically? </h3> </div>
<a>a more realistic perception of their own abilities and limitations.</a> This phenomenon is referred to as depressive realism. This is observed both among people in a state of
<a>depression</a> and among longer-term “trait” pessimists.
<div> <h3> Does thinking like a pessimist make people more or less successful? </h3> </div>
<a> indulge in their natural pessimism.</a> For example, picturing a negative outcome right before a test or performance can motivate them to do their best work. Embracing
<a>anxiety</a> and spending time imagining the worst-case scenario can give that extra boost to succeed.

<div> Optimism may be pessimism’s antonym, but the remedy for becoming less pessimistic may be increasing passion and desire—not just trying to see the proverbial glass as “half full.” </div>
<div> Pessimism can decrease motivation by making the brain less likely to pursue goals that involve some short-term discomfort but also result in feel-good rewards, a new study reports. </div>

<h1> 3 Critical Signs of Burnout </h1>
<h2> The three key signs that will tell you when you're burning out. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Burnout? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<p>Years ago, I was diagnosed with <a>depression</a> during my Emergency Medicine residency. Given that I was experiencing increasing levels of despair and hopelessness, I believe that diagnosis was partially correct.</p>
<p>When I look back, though, I can also see that severe burnout was part of the picture. (Researchers <a>have pointed out that</a> the two conditions can overlap.) At the time, unfortunately, no one saw or addressed the burnout.</p>
<a>stressful</a> practice and a more balanced life. I committed to taking care of myself properly and sought positive activities outside of work, such as dancing and writing. I felt dramatically better—shockingly better, actually—within weeks.
<p>So how do you know whether the challenges you are experiencing are simply everyday work stress or the signs of burnout? </p>
<p>For a person to be diagnosed with burnout, these three components need to be present:</p>
<p>1. Emotional exhaustion.</p>
<p>2. <a>Cynicism</a>/Depersonalization.</p>
<p>Imagine my shock when the very same doctor called me the next day from the airport on his way back home. He told me that while listening to me, he had been stunned to realize that he was suffering from severe burnout:</p>
<a>burned out</a>, and that I need to get help to make some changes. Thank you."
<a>personality change</a> and chronic bad moods; given his profession, though, it is quite probable that burnout played a role.)
<p>3. Reduced personal efficacy.</p>
<a>confidence</a> in your ability to do your job, even though you used to be quite good at it. You work harder and harder, but seem to accomplish less. Your
<a>productivity</a> has dropped significantly, and your belief in yourself has fallen along with it.
<a>attention</a>. As leading burnout researchers Christina Maslach and Michael Leiter describe in the article,
<a>"There is More to the Job Experience Than Just Burnout,"</a> you may initially experience just one of the above profiles, as you head down the road from healthy work engagement to full-fledged burnout.

<a>root cause of insomnia</a>, if it’s not immediately obvious, can help an individual manage and treat it.
<div> <h3> Can certain behaviors cause or worsen insomnia? </h3> </div>
<a>Other, subtler behaviors</a>—such as
<a>lying</a> awake in bed for hours—can also worsen insomnia-related
<a>anxiety</a> and train the brain to associate the bed with sleeplessness. Experts recommend getting up and doing a quiet activity rather than lying awake in bed.

<h2> How to Deal With Insomnia </h2>
<p>A short-term bout of insomnia is best handled by doing nothing. It's important not to compensate by staying in bed longer or napping during the day.</p>

<p>But if you’re feeling stress and anxiety, there are simple ways to start reclaiming agency in your life. Consider doing one or two of the following, starting today:</p>
<li>Reduce your <a>screen time</a>. Remove time-sucking social media apps from your phone, for example, and designate screen-free zones like mealtime and the bedroom.</li>
<li>Move more. Stand up and walk around for a couple of minutes once or twice an hour. Even a little bit of movement is better than being completely sedentary for hours on end.</li>

<li>Give yourself a break. Constant productivity doesn’t end up being very productive, as your energy and enthusiasm drop. Set aside work-free times and focus on other things, like loved ones and favorite hobbies.</li>
