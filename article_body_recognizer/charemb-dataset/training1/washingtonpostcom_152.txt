<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Michael Loria</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The development has already driven up housing prices, according to Henderson. He first noticed the market impact of the development two years ago. Since 2019, the median home price has increased from $610,000 to $689,000.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s hard pressed to have a bad sale in [Brightwood] and that’s directly a result of the development,” Henderson said. “Values are really picking up.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Homes now sell for more than $1 million regularly. In 2019, only one home sold for more than $1 million. In 2021, 14 homes sold for more than $1 million.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Wessynton has serene places, tranquil spaces surrounded by history</p></div>
<div><div><p>Henderson and his family moved to Brightwood in 2012. For the kids it was “perfection,” Henderson said. “We’re literally in between two playgrounds.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some worry the Walter Reed development will make Brightwood too expensive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For me, that’s going to be an issue,” Tesfaye Lencho said. “I’m not young. I’m 68. I’m on Social Security now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Who doesn’t want to live here?” Lencho said. “It’s an ideal place to be honest with you.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Budding families and camaraderie in North Bethesda’s Old Georgetown Village</p></div>
<p>Brightwood is more diverse than nearby Manor Park or Shepherd Park. Amharic and Spanish can often be heard. Brightwood Community Association president Monica Goletiani attributes the diversity to the neighborhood’s broad housing options.</p>
<div><div><p>“Because there is a housing type that you can afford,” Goletiani said, “anyone could live here.”</p></div></div>
<a>Jackson</a> who moved to the neighborhood in 1989.
<div><div><p>Goletiani, who has lived in Brightwood for 20 years, understands the concerns about the Walter Reed development but trusts Brightwood can stand up for itself.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Small pieces of preservation have made a big difference,” Goletiani said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We managed to preserve this for so many,” Goletiani said. “Little kids, elderly people, everybody uses the triangle.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The plot proved a boon when city parks, like the adjacent Fort Stevens, closed during the <a>coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But homes selling for more than $1 million can change the character of a neighborhood. Henderson, like others, hopes they can meet Brightwood on its own terms.</p></div></div>
<p>“It’ll be interesting to see how we transition once everything is completely walkable,” he said. “You want people who want to integrate into a neighborhood and be there, and not be there waiting for it to change.”</p>
<div><p><b>Living there:</b> According to the Brightwood Community Association, the neighborhood is bounded by Aspen Street to the north, Georgia Avenue to the east, Missouri Avenue and Military Road to the south, and Rock Creek Park to the west.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Schools: </b>Brightwood Elementary; Ida B. Wells Middle; Coolidge High.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>SYDNEY — When tennis star Novak Djokovic arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, he stepped off the plane into a different country than the one where he’d won the Australian Open a year earlier.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Rules are rules’: Australia cancels Novak Djokovic’s visa amid vaccine exemption uproar</p></div>
<div><p>After initially distancing himself from the saga, Prime Minister Scott Morrison seemed to embrace his government’s decision to turn away the tennis player, who he said lacked a medical exemption required of unvaccinated visitors.</p></div>
<a>bungled vaccine rollout</a> to a diplomatic
<a>spat with France</a> to its latest handling of an omicron surge, ahead of what is expected to be a tight electoral contest between Morrison’s conservative coalition and the opposition Labor party.
<div><p>Novak Djokovic’s vaccine exemption for Australian Open is met with skepticism</p></div>
<a>Indian cricketers</a> were able to visit last year. Djokovic was one of several dozen overseas tennis players allowed in a year ago for the Australian Open, which he won for the third year in a row.
<div><div><p>But a lot has changed in the past 12 months, said Steve Georgakis, an expert in the history and sociology of sport at the University of Sydney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With relatively few cases and a sports-mad populace, Australia carved out exceptions early in the pandemic to keep the games going even as most industries ground to a halt, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our sport in many ways continued uninterrupted,” he said. “It’s this great unifier of who we are, it brings people together, and it has brought our nation together.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Allowing big business to break the rules is not what Australian sport is all about,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other big change is that after a slow start, roughly 94 percent of eligible Australians are vaccinated, leaving little popular sympathy for Djokovic, who has said he <a>opposes vaccination</a> and vaccine mandates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That Djokovic was arriving in Melbourne, which has endured more time in lockdown than any other city on earth and seen the most deaths in Australia, added to the outrage.</p></div></div>
<a>movie posters</a> about people trapped at airports. One satirical website
<a>quipped</a> that Djokovic had instead decided to enter a tournament on Manus Island, where Australia detained asylum seekers.
<div><div><p>The initial decision to grant the tennis star a visa “didn’t pass the pub test,” meaning the average Australian wouldn’t agree with it, said Georgakis.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘A search for villains’: As Australia’s outbreak grows, so does covid shaming</p></div>
<div><div><p>The government “really misunderstood the Djokovic situation,” he said. “They look really silly now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While unvaccinated Australians are allowed to return to the country (with two weeks in hotel quarantine), visa holders must be vaccinated or have a medical exemption.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Morrison said Thursday that Djokovic did not have a “valid” medical exemption, suggesting that authorities in Victoria state, where Melbourne is located, and Tennis Australia were responsible for the mix-up.</p></div></div>
<p>“All I can say is that the evidence [for] medical exemption that was provided was found to be insufficient,” the prime minister said. But Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley shot back, saying his state wasn’t to blame.</p>
<div><div><p>“Someone issued Novak a visa, and it wasn’t the Victorian government,” Foley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government is now taking heat from Serbia, Djokovic’s home country, a few months after an embarrassing fallout with France over a canceled submarine deal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic is reportedly being held at a Melbourne hotel where detained asylum seekers have complained of maggots, though Minister for Home Affairs Karen Andrews refused to say where he was on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<p>The tennis star’s attorneys on Thursday won a last-minute bid to prevent his deportation, with a judge approving a temporary injunction that allows Djokovic to stay in Australia until at least Monday, when a further hearing will take place.</p>
<div><div><p>Djokovic has won the Australian Open nine times, more than any other player, and is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most Grand Slam titles. At the moment, his bid to break that record has been slammed shut.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The first <a>in-depth laboratory study</a> of the omicron variant of the <a>coronavirus</a> offers a mixed bag of bad news and good news.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, previous infection followed by vaccination or a booster is likely to “confer protection from severe disease in Omicron infection,” the study said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The study is one of the first clues that will help inform pharmaceutical companies and policymakers trying to decide whether the global vaccination strategy needs to be updated with an omicron-specific shot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Multiple scientists said the results are not a reason to panic.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hanage noted that people with previous infections and vaccinations showed protection, which supports the argument from public health officials that people should not rely solely on the immunity conferred by recovery from an infection.</p></div>
<div><p>David R. Martinez, a viral immunologist at the University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, said it is important to realize that other parts of the immune system protect people against severe disease.</p></div>
<div><div><p>What happens next will depend in large part on the real-world data.</p></div></div>

<h1>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope launches, will open a new window on the cosmos — if everything goes just right</h1>
<h2>The successor to the Hubble must evade 344 potential ‘single point failures’ to achieve its ambitious mission</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joel Achenbach</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Updated Dec. 25 at 1:28 p.m.Originally published Dec. 22, 2021</div></div></div>
<div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope will ascend to orbit in the payload section of an Ariane 5 rocket and unfold to its full size once it reaches orbit.</p></div>
<div><p>The centerpiece of the telescope is a 21-foot-diameter mirror assembly, nearly three times the size of the mirror aboard the Hubble Space Telescope it’s meant to replace.</p></div>
<div><p>Hubble was designed to be delivered to orbit, fully assembled, in the cargo bay of a space shuttle. The assembled Webb telescope would be far too large to be carried by any existing launcher and so must reach space folded.</p></div>
<div><p>The Webb telescope’s sensitive instruments must be kept super-cold to function. The telescope is therefore equipped with a large sun shield.</p></div>
<div><p>Made of silicon and insulating Kapton foil, it shades the telescope not just from the sun’s heat but from the reflected warmth of the Earth and the moon as well.</p></div>
<div><p>The light from distant galaxies will collect in the Webb’s main mirror and then focus on the secondary mirror. The concentrated light will then stream to the telescope’s instrument module to be interpreted.</p></div>
<div><p>The processed images will then stream to Earth via the telescope’s Earth-pointed antenna.</p></div>
<p>NASA actually has an answer to that question: This mission is vulnerable to, and therefore must avoid, 344 potential “single-point failures,” according to an independent review board.</p>
<p>“If I’m not nervous, I’m not realistic,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, head of science at NASA. “This is a complex mission. There is no way of making this simple.”</p>
<p>If something causes a further delay, there will be launch windows every morning, lasting 30 minutes, until Jan. 6, when the moon will cruise into the picture and create a gravitational disruption for a week.</p>
<p>Beyond the shimmying and twirling, the observatory is not fixable. There is nothing that can be yanked out and replaced with something new.</p>
<p>The only exception is fuel. The observatory uses fuel to maneuver and to point at interesting targets. It has enough fuel to operate for roughly 10 years. In theory, it could be refueled with a robotic spacecraft, which would extend the mission.</p>
<p>There is no spaceship that can send astronauts to such a distant place and bring them safely home. To dream up such a mission would be prohibitively costly and risky. It would make more sense to build and launch a new telescope.</p>
<h3>‘As good as it gets’</h3>
<p>But telescopes traditionally have been named after scientists like Hubble. NASA is developing another space telescope named for the pioneering astronomer Nancy Grace Roman, the first female executive at NASA and first chief of astronomy.</p>
<p>But after a review by the agency’s history office, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the agency found no evidence warranting a name change for the telescope.</p>
<h3>Weddings, funerals and a telescope</h3>
<p>“Arguably, it’s one of the most complex missions NASA’s ever done,” Menzel said.</p>
<p>It’s also one of the most protracted. Menzel has been working on the Webb for 24 years. There’s a whole community of people who have put in that kind of generational labor on this telescope.</p>
<p>“We’ve watched our kids grow up, we’ve gone to weddings, we’ve gone to funerals. After 24 years, it would not be incorrect to say we’re an extended family,” Menzel said.</p>
<p>How does a NASA engineer, or scientist, or administrator, or even some astronomer on the far side of the world who is invested in this mission get through the gut-churning anxieties of launch and deployment? By trusting the process.</p>
<p>Everyone has been asking Mather, the senior project scientist, if he’s worried in advance of the launch, according to a NASA blog devoted to the Webb.</p>
<p>But deploying the Webb and making it operational is perhaps a greater challenge.</p>
<p>“We have two months of terror, not seven minutes,” said Grunsfeld,<b> </b>the former NASA science administrator.</p>
<p>Hammel, the astronomer, compares this moment to being in an orchestra in the seconds before a performance.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paulina Firozi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 11:48 a.m. EST|Updated today at 12:45 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>No spectators will be able to watch a U.S. Olympic team trials event scheduled for this week, a change that comes as the hyper-contagious omicron variant of the coronavirus continues to spread across the nation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement, US Speedskating Executive Director Ted Morris said the decision was made as a precaution for athletes just weeks before the Games.</p></div></div>
<a>Olympics</a> are set to begin with the Opening Ceremonies on Feb. 4. The Winter Games will operate in a bubble, meaning individuals involved will not be able to exit the network of Olympics venues once they have arrived. Those entering the bubble
<a>will need to be fully vaccinated</a>, and Olympic organizers are allowing medical exemptions for athletes who will need to quarantine before entering the bubble.
<div><p>The Beijing Olympics begin Feb. 4. Here’s what you need to know.</p></div>
<a>according to data tracked by The Post</a>. In Milwaukee County, there has been a 6 percent rise in daily cases in the last week.
<div><div><p>In the state, nearly 66 percent of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated, and more than 44 percent of fully vaccinated people have received a booster shot.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Pettit Center said ticket purchasers will be able to get a refund, but also asked people to consider making “your ticket purchase a charitable donation to Pettit Center to help offset the costs we have incurred.”</p></div>
<div><p>Olympic skier Mikaela Shiffrin tests positive for coronavirus amid World Cup competition</p></div>
<div><div><p>Dean said the move to prohibit fans is “the most difficult action I have had to take in my thirteen years as Executive Director.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There were 4,200 tickets sold for the trials event as of Sunday morning, according to the Pettit Center. Three of the five trials days were already sold out, Butler said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All six days of the 2018 Olympic trails in Milwaukee were sold out, and “that was our goal this time around,” he added.</p></div></div>
<h3>What to read about sports and the pandemic</h3>
<p>The <a>NFL, NBA and NHL have all updated their coronavirus protocols</a> amid an uptick in coronavirus cases among players and team officials.</p>
<p>NHL players <a>will not participate in the Beijing Winter Olympics</a>, following a spike in cases among players and the rise of the omicron variant.</p>
<p>NBA commissioner Adam Silver <a>dismissed the notion</a> that the NBA would temporarily suspend play in response to omicron.</p>
<p>Should healthy, vaccinated pro athletes who test positive play on?<a> Not yet, experts say</a>.</p>

<div><div><a>Lifestyle</a></div><div><h1>Thinking about how dogs think</h1></div></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Kim Kavin</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>August 12, 2021 at 9:04 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<p>Back in 2002, when Alexandra Horowitz was working toward her PhD at the University of California at San Diego, she believed that dogs were a worthy thing to study. But her dissertation committee, which favored apes and monkeys, needed convincing.</p>
<div><div><p>“This field, and animal cognition, really, is all within our lifetimes,” Horowitz said. “It’s not as if nobody ever looked at dogs, but they weren’t looking at their minds.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>An evolving area of research</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But researchers at universities doing studies on dogs? There are now many dozens of those, and there’s no lack of students wanting to at least dabble in the work.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Every semester, on the first day, she asks students if their dogs are happy. It’s her way of helping them understand why the study of dog cognition is important.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>How the research is done</div></h4></div></div>
<p><mark>Horowitz and her team showed the dogs three buckets and taught them that one of the buckets always had a treat under it, and one did not. Then she measured how quickly the dogs went to the “ambiguous bucket” in the middle.</mark></p>
<div><div><p><mark>After a few weeks of nose-work classes, Horowitz repeated the bucket test.</mark></p></div></div>
<i>types</i> of thinking. The finding opens up the idea of studying dogs in ways that could make deep-pocketed entities like the U.S. government want to fund more dog-cognition research, Hare said.

<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the health-care policy debate in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Roubein</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>December 8, 2021 at 8:17 a.m. EST</div></div>
<p>🚨 An initial laboratory study indicates a booster of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine offers significant protection against the omicron variant, but the two-dose regimen was less effective, the companies announced this morning. But first:</p>
<div><div><h4><div>Lost your job over vaccine requirements? You might qualify for unemployment</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s a new trend in the fight against coronavirus vaccine mandates. </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>“It seems to be part and parcel of an opposition to the mandate,” said Helen Rella, an employment attorney at Wilk Auslander.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>This comes as anti-mandate sentiment among Republicans has reached new heights. </p></div></div>
<li>Last week, several conservative senators threatened to hold up passage of a bill to fund the government. </li>
<li>As soon as this week, GOP senators — joined by at least two Democrats — will attempt to overturn Biden’s vaccine or test mandate for private businesses (more on that below).</li>
<div><div><h5><div>The details</div></h5></div></div>
<li>Kansas is the lone state to do so with a Democratic governor. Gov. Laura Kelly, who’s up for reelection next year, has opposed Biden’s recent moves to implement a federal vaccine mandate.</li>
<li>“I have been clear that I believe it is too late to impose a federal standard,” Kelly said in a statement after signing a bill making it easier to get coronavirus vaccine exemptions and unemployment insurance.</li>
<div><div><h5><div>Meanwhile</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>The vaccine war continues in Congress.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the Senate, the measure is likely to pass. It only needs a simple majority, and has the backing of every Senate Republican, as well as Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin (W.Va.) and Jon Tester (Mont.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As for the White House, the administration last night said Biden would veto such a measure if it got to his desk.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>On the Hill</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Hospitals notch a win</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The bill staves off several cuts to Medicare, such as…</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Delaying until April a 2 percent cut on all Medicare payments</li><li>Reducing it to 1 percent from April to the end of June</li><li>Halting until next year a roughly 4 percent cut due to pay-as-you-go requirements</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>How we got here: Congressional leaders linked avoiding the Medicare cuts to legislation opening the door for Democrats to raise the debt ceiling. </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>The lawmakers detailed the asks today in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, which was led by Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Cori Bush (D-Mo.).</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h3><div>In the courts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>A federal judge blocked Biden’s vaccine mandate for federal contractors</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>A third dose of the Pfizer vaccine appears effective against omicron</div></h4></div></div>
<li>The early data has not yet been peer reviewed or published, our colleague Carolyn Y. Johnson notes.</li>
<li>The companies are still retooling their vaccine to create a version focusing the immune system against omicron, though it’s still unclear if that will be needed.</li>
<div><div><p>Yesterday, there was both good and bad news from the first in-depth laboratory study of the omicron variant, Carolyn and Joel Achenbach report.</p></div></div>
<li>Some positive news: Omicron did not escape the antibodies completely. The vaccines still give some protection, even if it winds up being diminished, and booster shots could be key to bolstering it.</li>
<div><div><h4><div>About that Psaki comment on coronavirus testing…</div></h4></div></div>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki responded sarcastically to a question about sending rapid tests to every American. But several countries are already doing that. The Post’s Aaron Blake drills down into Monday’s testy exchange: </p>
<div><div><p>What happened: Psaki appeared dismissive of an idea to send at-home tests to all Americans when questioned about the tests by NPR’s Mara Liasson about at-home tests. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reality check: The idea isn’t unthinkable, as Aaron and others noted after the exchange. </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>The United Kingdom allows people to get seven mail-order tests at a time. Singapore has sent six free rapid tests to every household. And other countries have made the tests cheaper and more accessible.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>Here's what else you need to know:</p></div></div>
<li>Unvaccinated hospital patients in Illinois would be forced to pay their own coronavirus medical costs out of pocket under a bill proposed by a Democratic state lawmaker in Illinois, The Post’s Timothy Bella reports.</li>
<li>People who test positive on rapid, at-home coronavirus tests are often not counted by public health agencies, meaning that health officials are increasingly relying on incomplete data and educated guesses, Kathleen McLaughlin reports for Stat.</li>
<li>A late-stage trial of a plant-derived coronavirus vaccine from Medicago and GlaxoSmithKline found the overall efficacy rate was 71 percent, The Post's Adela Suliman reports.</li>

<a>news release</a> Wednesday. Families Together said one of the members “sustained serious injuries and was sent to the hospital in an ambulance” but that both workers “are expected to make a full recovery within a few days.”
<a>Orange County Register</a>. Jahanbani recounted to the
<a>Los Angeles Times</a> that it took multiple people at the clinic to pry Apollo away from a medical assistant he was beating up and that seven police officers were needed to restrain the man over about 15 minutes.
<div><div><p>Apollo, of Poway, Calif., was arrested and booked into the Orange County jail Thursday on suspicion of battery and resisting arrest, according to police. He was released on bail Friday, records show.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We know the case is now in the hands of the District Attorney’s office and we hope it proceeds in enforcing the full extent of the law,” Rossel said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Apollo did not respond to a request for comment. It’s unclear whether he has an attorney.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>After Apollo walked into the clinic without a mask before 10 a.m., workers asked him to put a mask on, according to police. When Apollo refused, he was asked to leave.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“He said, ‘I don’t need a mask, I don’t have the virus, and you are the ones making people sick,’ ” Jahanbani, 37, told the Register. “And just every type of profanity you can imagine.”</p></div>
<div><p>At one point, Apollo pinned down the medical assistant, who declined to be publicly identified in local media, and landed “a few pretty strong punches” to the official’s head, chest and back, Jahanbani told the Times.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It was one of my biggest fears coming true,” Jahanbani said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He was shouting, ‘You’re a part of this, too!’ at the officers,” Jahanbani told the outlet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Families Together said it was “extremely saddened” by the attack but that nothing would stop its workers from administering vaccine doses to people who want them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re proud of the strength and bravery of our team, and while this incident has shaken us, we will not be deterred from our mission to keep our community safe and healthy,” the group wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jahanbani told the Register that he was ready to forgive Apollo for the attack — and hopes he understands why vaccination is necessary to help stop the spread of the virus.</p></div></div>
<p>“This isn’t a man-made problem,” Jahanbani said. “It’s happening to humanity, and we all have to unite together against it. We all want things to go back to normal, and that’s why we’re doing this.”</p>
