<h1> Don’t Look Up: Are Some Critics Suffering From Denial? </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective: There's more than one kind of climate change denial. </h2>
<a>have suggested</a> that some such critics are engaged in
<a>denial</a>. As Adam McKay, the film’s director summarized their argument
<a>anxiety</a> about the climate collapsing (or the US teetering), I’m not sure Don’t Look Up makes any sense. It’s like a robot viewing a love story. “Why ArE their FacEs so cLoSe ToGether?”
<p>In defense of themselves, the film's critics say that they are not climate change deniers. They believe it's real and happening. They just also believe the movie is bad art. </p>
<a>psychologists define it</a>: A
<a>how hot it was this Christmas</a>. But acknowledging that warming is happening is not the same as acknowledging the severity of climate change's threat.
<a>Global warming</a> is what causes climate change, but the consequences of climate change go far beyond "the days being hotter" or even certain regions becoming uninhabitable because they are too hot.
<a>displacement</a>. By six degrees, most species (including humans) will likely go extinct. Equating "noticing hotter days" with "appreciating climate change's threat" can only happen if one minimizes the severity of that threat.
<a>shame</a>—yet it accomplishes exactly nothing. (Even the film’s Russian, Indian, Chinese last-minute failed mission to divert the comet was in response to the US
<a>cutting</a> them out of the comet’s mineral rights—not Kate and Randell’s efforts.)
<a>Climate Anxiety</a> is a phenomenon recognized in the Journal of Anxiety Disorders, and one of the most common (but not healthy) ways to deal with anxiety is denial.
<a>to have a conversation about climate change</a>), engages in exactly the kind of head-in-the-sand denialism that Don’t Look Up is criticizing—the kind that threatens to end the species.

<h1> Facilitating Productive Conversations about Abortion </h1>
<h2> How to address intractable polarization. </h2>
<li>Conflict between opposing positions today makes conversation about many issues largely impossible. </li>
<li>The debate around abortion provides an example, as it involves competing moral goods. </li>
<li>This debate challenges people to confront the need for a new maturity in our relationship with death. </li>
<h3>Applying a “Parts Work” Approach</h3>
<p>Consulting work I did a few years back with a social services organization provides a way in. Abortion had become a hot-button issue in the organization, and contentious feelings were getting in the way of people working together effectively.</p>

<h1> Antiracist Is Distinct From Nonracist </h1>
<h2> Kendian antiracism says you're either racist or antiracist, but is that true? </h2>
<li>According to Ibram X. Kendi, people can be described as either "racist" or "antiracist."</li>
<li>Kendian antiracism is characterized by active attempts to redress current and historical racial injustice, rather than being "not racist."</li>
<li>Antiracism and nonracism both exist and have different correlates from a psychological perspective.</li>

<a> how antiracism expresses itself from a psychological perspective.</a>
<a>that individual would be classified as racist</a> in the absence of any explicitly discriminatory views, and even when they expressly find racial
<a>discrimination</a> repugnant. The importance of activism is central to the claim that "
<a>white silence is violence</a>," which also became a mainstay of discussions surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement in 2020.
<a>How To Be an Antiracist</a> he says:
<blockquote> <p>The only remedy to racist discrimination is antiracist discrimination. The only remedy to past discrimination is present discrimination. The only remedy to present discrimination is future discrimination.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Despite the nature of these ideas, Kendian antiracism has become the language of contemporary policies related to equity, diversity, and inclusion within most organizations.</p>
<h3>Does Nonracism Actually Exist?</h3>
<p>LaCrosse and colleagues developed a measure of antiracism that explicitly found two dimensions:</p>
<li>Nonracism, as measured by items such as "I would never discriminate against a Black person based on race" and "I think White people and Black people should be treated equally in academic and employment settings."</li>
<p>Despite seeming to provide data that transcend Kendi's dichotomy, LaCrosse and colleagues appear to endorse the antiracist doctrine in their conclusion, stating:</p>
<a>decision-making</a> processes, attitudes, and behaviors of these individuals to explicitly antiracist people. In doing so, a more direct test of the Kendian dichotomy of "racist or antiracist" might be possible.

<h1> Want to Improve Mental Health? Reducing Poverty is Key </h1>
<h2> Poverty reduction is a powerful strategy for improving mental health. </h2>
<li>Poverty is a major cause of psychological distress around the world.</li>
<li>Poverty exposes people to a host of stressful conditions, from unsafe and overcrowded housing to poor healthcare and food.insecurity.</li>
<li>Poverty-related stress not only causes anxiety and depression in adults, it compromises parenting, which endangers children's mental health.</li>
<li>Poverty-reduction programs have a demonstrated effect on improving mental health. Their impact, if brought to scale, could be far-reaching.</li>

<a>traumatic</a> Stress Disorder (
<a>PTSD</a>) related to the violence in whatever country people had escaped from. I assumed that trauma related to the genocide would be the primary mental health concern in the refugee camps.
<a>shame</a> at being unable to provide for their families; women felt despair at being unable to feed their children adequately, or afford
<a>medication</a> to treat their illnesses.
<p>Here’s Catarina, a 48 year old refugee, describing her experience of poverty:</p>
<p>A focus on war trauma wasn’t wrong, it was simply way too narrow. It overlooked the most powerful source of psychological suffering in the camps.</p>
<p>Years later, I recalled Catarina's words as I listened to a Syrian man express his despair about the impact of falling deeper into poverty as a result of Lebanon's economic collapse, and the reduction of financial support to the refugees:</p>
<p>The financial situation is very hard. My wife and kids are sick. I can't afford the medication. We used to get medical aid for six months, now it's only one month. A person who has a sick wife and children, what can he do? I wish death. </p>
<a>suicide</a> and severe mental illness. According to
<p>We can treat these disorders with <a>psychotherapy</a> and medication, but if we limit our response to treating the effects of deprivation without targeting poverty itself, we’ll have an unending wellspring of distress.</p>
<h3>Why is poverty so toxic to mental health?</h3>
<a>crime</a> and community violence, and greater exposure to environmental hazards such as toxic waste and lead paint (Ridley et al., 2020).
<a>COVID-19</a> pandemic. Job loss, in turn, is strongly linked to anxiety, depression, and
<a>substance abuse</a>. Areas in the US heavily affected by job loss due to technology changes and globalization have seen heavy job losses and
<a>a concurrent rise in opioid addiction and overdoses.</a>
<a>intimate partner violence</a> (“domestic violence”), lower parental warmth, harsh
<a>stressful</a> and depressing to be sick.
<h3>Poverty reduction is good for mental health</h3>
<a>one study</a>, just a one dollar increase was associated with a 3-5% drop in suicide. Imagine what the impact on mental health might be of increasing the US federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15, as many have proposed.
<a>loneliness</a>. They also had a more positive perception of their cognitive abilities, i.e.
<a>memory</a>, learning and ability to concentrate.” Interestingly, people receiving the basic income actually worked more days annually than those in the control group, suggesting that a basic income did not discourage people from working.
<a>fear</a> of a health-related financial crisis.
<a>happiness</a> and lowered their distress (Ridley et al., 2020).
<li>There is <a>evidence</a> that poverty reduction programs may reduce intimate partner violence, which is generally more prevalent in low-income families.</li>
<a>Head Start and other early childhood education programs</a> give kids an educational boost, and have also shown powerful long-term benefits in greater educational achievement, lower criminality, and lower
<a>pregnancy</a>, all factors linked to greater economic wellbeing, which in turn is strongly related to better mental health.
<h3>Does poor mental health lead to poverty?</h3>
<a>genes</a>, our thoughts, our behavior, our early
<a>childhood</a> traumas and conflicts. These are all real and important causes of poor mental health, but such a view ignores the elephant in the room: the stressful conditions of everyday life in poverty and the suffering to which it gives rise.

<p>A blunt social media post, a slip on the family text thread, a careless remark during a holiday celebration.</p>
<p>The slightest offense can shatter a <a>sibling</a> bond made brittle by partisan opinions in these intensely political times. Beliefs are built on values, and family foundations often crack around political fissures. </p>
<p>Stacy Washington, host of Stacy on the Right on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125, said many of her listeners are suffering from estrangement due to divergent political views within the family.</p>
<p>She interviewed me on a recent program and asked, “What should they do?”</p>
<h3>Divergent Political Views as a Risk Factor for Estrangement</h3>
<p>For decades, I endured a bitter cutoff from my only brother. During that time, estrangement felt like a chronic rejection and a deep betrayal.</p>
<p>Remarkably, a chance to reconcile arose seven years ago, and, at that time, I read everything I could on how to move forward in our tenuous relationship. However, I grew frustrated that there weren't many books on this under-investigated topic.</p>
<p>Here are a few survey comments: </p>
<blockquote> <p>The <a>politics</a> of the times – to vax or not to vax, to mask or not to mask, to educate at school or home – are strangling the relationships in our family.</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>I couldn’t be my authentic self around my brother because we disagree politically on masks, vaccines, and guns. I was always avoiding topics, and eventually, we avoided each other.</p> </blockquote>
<a>childhood</a>, brothers and sisters cultivate necessary social qualities in one another — tolerance,
<a>generosity</a>, loyalty — that eventually shape adult relationships.
<a>friendship</a>, shared interests, or
<a>intimacy</a> — ranks just after the essentials: food and water, shelter and sleep, physical safety. Like these fundamentals, the human need to belong is lifelong.
<a>self-esteem</a> — who you are and how you see yourself — your friendships and other social relationships, your well-being and ability to trust, and your family members as they choose sides.
<h3>How to Stay Connected When Family Members Find Each Other's Politics Repugnant</h3>
<li>Seek common ground in shared experiences and memories to rise above political differences. </li>
<li>Avoid contentious topics. If you find your sibling’s politics offensive, restrict or block social media accounts. </li>
<li> Have an exit strategy when conversations become tense.</li>
<li>Place a priority on children. For example, to protect children, a family might agree to wear masks at an indoor gathering because that’s what’s best for the little ones.</li>
<li> Request a matriarch or patriarch enforce a moratorium on politics at family events. The enforcer should immediately shut down raised voices, profanity, and personal insults.</li>

<p>For improved relations, understanding, and even reconciliation, siblings must: </p>
<li>Sit down together, face to face. </li>
<li>Listen without interrupting, without challenging each other’s stories. Seek understanding. Experts agree that reconciliation is impossible without authentic, genuine listening. </li>
<li>Acknowledge, with <a>empathy</a>, the other person’s hurt, <a>anger</a>, or alienation. Assume they have sincere, trustworthy intentions. When each party accepts both parties’ experiences, neither feel devalued or shut out.</li>
<a>wisdom</a> won after a separation that cost our family dearly. Now, years into our reconciliation, the
<a>gratitude</a> and connection my brother and I share is a treasure for our elderly mother and our children.
<p>For us, as for many siblings who have overcome estrangement — whether rooted in old, cold slights or today’s red-hot politics — the loving presence of a brother or sister is its reward.</p>

<h1> 9 Tips to Save Your Politically Divided Friendships </h1>
<h2> Techniques from couples’ therapy could save friendships that cross party lines. </h2>
<li>The deeper the relationship, the more worthwhile it is to have meaningful conversations about core values.</li>
<li>Be willing to temporarily set aside political identifications and the desire to change someone's mind.</li>
<li>Challenge your assumptions and try your best to understand the other person's views. But remember that you're allowed to draw boundaries and stick to your morals.</li>
<p>The past few years, and perhaps especially the last one, have likely seen peak levels of family conflicts and friendship breakups over <a>politics</a>.</p>

<h3>1. Determine your overarching goal for the relationship.</h3>
<p>Is this a close family member with whom you hope to have a relationship for decades to come? Is this a college acquaintance you’ll only interact with at your 10-year reunion?</p>
<a>climate change</a> with your waiter.
<h3>2. "Take off your jersey."</h3>
<p>Once you’ve decided that having a political conversation is worthwhile for your relationship, you can mentally prepare before it starts.</p>
<a>I Think You’re Wrong (But I’m Listening)</a>. They suggest beginning a conversation about politics with a loved one by “taking off your jersey” and stepping away from identifying with a side.
<p>Neither of you is here as a Democrat or Republican. You’re both here as a genuinely curious friend or child or neighbor to discuss a specific issue, not debate party ideologies. </p>
<h3>3. Reimagine your goal.</h3>
<p>Let go of the idea that you’re going to change someone’s mind. It will immediately make you (and your conversation partner) a much easier person to talk to.</p>
<p>Instead, make your goal to understand why the other person feels the way they do. Don’t cheat by sneaking in an addendum goal, such as, “Once I understand how they feel, I can talk them out of it by debunking their myths.”</p>
<h3>4. Don't use "why" as an accusation; use "tell me more" as an open-ended invitation.</h3>
<p>A crucial part of wanting to understand someone else is knowing how to ask open-ended questions. Sometimes, people think they’re doing this when they ask “why” and “how.”</p>
<p>A real open-ended question is a simple invitation: “Tell me more,” or “That’s an interesting point. Could you elaborate?” </p>
<h3>5. Assume that you’re making some assumptions.</h3>
<p>We shouldn’t assume we know someone else’s thoughts and feelings, but we often don’t realize that we’re making assumptions!</p>
<h3>6. Allow emotions; don’t only focus on facts.</h3>
<p>People are not perfectly rational. To expect people to be rational is, in itself, irrational.</p>
<h3>7. Show that you understand, even if you disagree.</h3>
<h3>8. Forego closing arguments.</h3>
<h3>9. You’re allowed to draw lines on certain issues. You’re also allowed to draw boundaries in relationships.</h3>
<a>empathy</a> and curiosity to communicate can help you clarify this.
<a>marriage</a> equality to be sacred, while your friend may hold traditional religious definitions of marriage to be sacred. And there may be no way around this disagreement.
<h3>When to end a relationship over political disagreements</h3>
<a>attention</a> to their moral principles. We’re allowed to draw boundaries and focus on relationships that feed our souls, open our minds, and make us better people.
