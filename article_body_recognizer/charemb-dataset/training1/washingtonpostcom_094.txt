<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Nicki Jhabvala</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 5:27 p.m. EST|Updated today at 8:54 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>A frantic nine-minute 911 call provided some details about the December car crash in Loudoun County that killed 29-year-old Olivia S. Peters and left Washington Football Team safety Deshazor Everett seriously injured.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The first witness told the dispatcher that he “just saw a car flip over” and confirmed the location of the crash. “I think some of his friends are coming to assist him,” he told the dispatcher.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after, the other male witness was heard in the background saying, “He’s like all the way in the ditch,” before pleading: “Just get somebody. Just get some help.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The car is, ma’am, the car is — it’s trapped. It’s trapped in the trees,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the dispatcher checked the location of emergency responders, he repeatedly begged her: “Please hurry. Please hurry.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He later told her, “I don’t even know what happened.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After hearing the conversation in the background, the dispatcher asked how many people were in the vehicle, and the second witness said, “It was him and his girlfriend.” He added that one person was trapped inside.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Moments later, sirens could be heard in the background, and he told the dispatcher: “They see me. They see me.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokesperson for the Loudoun County Sheriff’s Office said the investigation of the crash is ongoing and no charges have been filed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Peters, the longtime girlfriend of Everett and an occupational therapist from Montgomery County, Md., was taken to StoneSprings Hospital Center, where she was pronounced dead.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a>. The extent of his injuries from the crash is unclear.
<div><div><p>On Thursday afternoon, Everett issued his first public comments since the crash, tweeting: “Thank you for all of your prayers, continue to pray for Olivia’s family and me. Thank you all #Live4Liv”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Everett, a seven-year NFL veteran, is a core special-teamer and captain for Washington.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Everett’s attorney, Kaveh Noorishad of Northern Virginia-based firm Noorishad Law, P.C., released a statement Wednesday regarding the crash:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There are no words to convey our collective sadness over the tragic accident that took the life of Olivia Peters, a loving daughter, friend, and longtime girlfriend of Mr. Everett,” Noorishad wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The family detailed her work as an occupational therapist, with practices in Las Vegas and New York City, and later launched the Olivia S. Peters Pediatric Therapy Foundation.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Washington Capitals</a></div></div><div><h1>Evgeny Kuznetsov heard the critiques, so he got to work</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Samantha Pell</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 31, 2021 at 1:41 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<p>Evgeny Kuznetsov knew something needed to change. He had just gone through another inconsistent season — this one marred by two stints on the NHL’s coronavirus protocols list — and his name was ever-present in trade rumors.</p>
<div><div><p>So the flashy Washington Capitals center put his head down this offseason and started training. He worked out two to three times per day, staying home in Virginia as he skated on his own.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He let critiques of his game fuel his training. Once training camp started, he knew what he had to do. He needed to change details in his game to work better with the coaching staff and get the on-ice results both sides wanted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The biggest reason why I am here is my commitment: the things I’ve done, the things I want to do. I changed a lot of things. I had to change those things, right?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kuznetsov has <a>seen the results </a>early this season. He has five goals and seven assists in the first eight games. Last season, he had nine goals and 20 assists in 41 games.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Evgeny Kuznetsov is off to a promising start for the Capitals. Can it last?</p></div>
<div><p>He still makes mistakes and his game isn’t at its peak, but he thinks he is taking steps to be the player he has the potential to be. The 29-year-old is in the fifth year of an eight-year, $62.4 million contract he signed in 2017.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“One day I am going to be old, and I want to be the guy that the young guys can look up to,” Kuznetsov said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Much of Kuznetsov’s drive to succeed is internal. Criticism of his game last season revolved around questions about his commitment and discipline. Kuznetsov heard them all, and he doesn’t think they’re fair.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He lost the joy that fuels his game. Now it’s back.</p></div></div>
<a>player who needs and craves ice time.</a> Last year, mentally and physically, he could never get where he needed or wanted to be.
<a>first bout with the coronavirus</a> early in the season, Kuznetsov said, was worse than outsiders knew. He had trouble breathing and had to use an inhaler three times per day until the end of the postseason.
<a>Washington’s double-overtime loss to Boston in Game 3</a> of the first round of the playoffs.
<div><div><p>This season, Kuznetsov is looking to keep the past in the past. He will take the lessons he learned last year and apply them to the future. For now, he’s happy with his start and knows there is more room to grow.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Barry Svrluga</div></div>Sports columnist </span></div></span></div><div>December 4, 2021|Updated December 7, 2021 at 3:23 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Good thing we have 50-something games to sort this out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s always points throughout the year where Ovi just plays at a different level that a lot of us can’t get to,” said T.J. Oshie, a teammate for seven years, an off-and-on linemate that whole time.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Alex Ovechkin is closing in on another NHL record and finding new ways to get there</p></div>
<a>as he tries to work his way back from a hip injury</a>.
<div><p>Tom Wilson takes on mentorship role with Capitals’ young players</p></div>
<a>work in a slew of rookies</a>, including 20-year-old Aliaksei Protas on Ovechkin’s line at times — has required not only Ovechkin’s goals. It has required his generosity.
<div><p>“He’s been making great offensive plays — not just scoring goals,” Coach Peter Laviolette said. “When it’s time to pass to somebody, when everybody gravitates to him, he makes the right pass.”</p></div>
<div><p>To the point where, heading into Friday’s game against Pittsburgh, he is averaging 0.81 assists per game — an average he has exceeded just once in his career, 2009-10, the season after he won the second of his three Harts.</p></div>
<div><p>In those productive seasons, those players ranged in age from 21 to 26. Ovechkin has averaged two-thirds of a goal per game <i>five</i> times, including once when he was 34. Keep up this pace, and it would be six, at 36. He never stops.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s just hungry to score,” Wilson said. “He’s hungry to keep bettering himself. I’ve never seen anything like it.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Barry Svrluga</div></div>Sports columnist </span></div></span></div><div>December 11, 2021 at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet under the stands, in a weight room just off the home locker room, Nicklas Backstrom merely caught glimpses on TV.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a little different,” he said. “But …”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And he paused. There are no “buts.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Obviously, it sucks,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Alex Ovechkin is improving at age 36, and teammates have ‘never seen anything like it’</p></div>
<div><div><p>The weight room, in the middle of a home game against the Penguins? It’s where he <i>needs</i> to be. It’s not where he <i>wants</i> to be.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“But I made a decision early, and I was committed to it.”</p></div></div>
<a>their 4-2 loss to the Penguins</a> and a victory by the New York Rangers over Buffalo on Friday — is a testament to the
<a>young base of talent</a> the organization has built. But there is no long-term plan for success that doesn’t include the franchise’s all-time leader in assists.
<div><div><p>“Just out here dominating,” veteran winger T.J. Oshie said, “like he always does.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But a step removed. A protracted injury not only removes the hockey from a hockey player’s life. It removes all the elements that surround the game — practices, flights, meals, jokes — as well.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To that end, Backstrom has tried to not to be absent even if he’s not in the lineup. “I love the locker room,” he said, and that makes sense because the Capitals have a locker room culture he helped create.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From his host family to his Caps coaches, Aliaksei Protas makes a strong impression</p></div>
<div><div><p>“You want to get in the locker room, make sure there’s a good vibe,” Backstrom said, “make sure you pat guys on the back, especially the younger guys.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That allows him to matter — to be present — even if he can’t yet play.</p></div></div>
<p>He is getting better. But with an injury that is measured not in days but in months, there is a natural question that follows: At 34 and with a hip that has hampered him, can he be the version of Nicklas Backstrom that Capitals fans know and expect?</p>
<div><div><p>For 14 years, that’s what Nicklas Backstrom has done: help the team. As he lifts weights in the middle of the Caps’ games, that’s the goal again. When? No one’s quite sure. Patience.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I can’t wait to be back out there,” he said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>He has played with confidence and swagger, which has eyes gravitating toward him.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Depleted Capitals can’t hold a two-goal lead and suffer a 3-2 loss to the visiting Kings</p></div>
<div><div><p>But instead, the coaches decided they wanted to keep him around. Craig Ramsay, Slovakia’s head coach, said there was just “something about him” that made Ramsay keep the dynamic, young player on the roster.</p></div></div>
<p>Ramsay remembers Fehervary’s attentiveness the most. Even though there was often a language barrier, Ramsay said Fehervary would look back at him, nod and say, “Okay, yeah, I can do that.” Then, he would go out and deliver.</p>
<div><div><p>There was no questioning or complaining, no wondering why something should be done differently than he anticipated. Fehervary accepted the challenge, no matter what it was.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Fehervary’s journey to the NHL has helped his development. Beyond the world championships, he also was able to spend time in the Swedish league and the American Hockey League after he was drafted in the second round in 2018.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Washington assistant general manager Ross Mahoney said Fehervary’s “character, effort, attitude [and] competitiveness” jumped out in the early stages of scouting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I can’t recall watching a game where I thought Martin’s effort wasn’t where it should be — it was always unbelievable,” Mahoney said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bruce Boudreau, now the head coach of the Vancouver Canucks, coached both Dmitry Orlov and Carlson, defensemen who were high draft picks and then made an immediate impact with the Capitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When you get a rookie that doesn’t play like a rookie,” he said, “that is how organizations stay up at the top.”</p></div></div>

<a>evidence collected by federal investigators</a> in which those involved in storming the Capitol linked their actions to Trump’s desires. Others had
<a>said as much</a> to media outlets before their arrests. But what the existing evidentiary record shows is that attention turned to the 6th only
<i>after</i> Trump highlighted it. It wasn’t just that people came that day because of Trump, it’s that the day didn’t become a focus of attention
<i>until</i> Trump highlighted it.

<div><div><p>Over the next few weeks, he kept up the drumbeat: Big rally Jan. 6, up to the people to stop the finalization of the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Dec. 26, he lashed out at the Justice Department for not reinforcing his false claims about voter fraud.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A number of others arrested in connection with their alleged involvement in the storming of the Capitol similarly announced plans to attend only after Trump had emphasized the date.</p></div></div>
<li>Kenneth Grayson allegedly wrote Dec. 23 that he would be “there for the greatest celebration of all time after Pence leads the Senate flip!!”</li>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Laura Vozzella</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 28, 2021 at 7:44 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>RICHMOND — The Supreme Court of Virginia on Tuesday unanimously approved new congressional and General Assembly maps, ending a contentious redistricting process that for the first time gave no say to the state’s elected officials.</p>
<div><p>Proposed Virginia redistricting maps leave Spanberger miles away from her congressional seat</p></div>
<div><p>“[H]earing from residents from all walks of life and from all corners of the Commonwealth gave us a much deeper understanding of the issues involved and brought to our attention things that we had honestly missed,” they wrote.</p></div>
<div><div><p>While it’s possible that some of those pairings have changed by other tweaks made to the maps, the special masters said they did not consider “incumbency protection” in the new version.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In consultation with the Court, we have rejected calls to actively educate ourselves further on the residences of incumbents,” they wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The maps drew praise from Liz White, executive director of the anti-gerrymandering group OneVirginia2021.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spokespeople for members of Congress and the state legislative caucuses either did not respond to requests for comment or declined, saying they had not yet analyzed the maps.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One exception was H. Morgan Griffith (R), <a>who took to Twitter</a> to declare he would seek reelection to the 9th District in the state’s rural Southwest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was not immediately clear how much the final maps approved Tuesday vary from the proposal rolled out earlier this month. White said that at first glance, the bigger changes appeared to be to the congressional map.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the final map, the 7th shifts southward but still does not include Henrico County, where Spanberger lives, White said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The new 1st District picks up a big portion of Henrico and Chesterfield counties, two communities that had been separated in the first version and had sought to be united.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>It’s understandable, given the strains and frustrations we’ve experienced since March 2020, that we would seize upon that possibility with alacrity. But before we do, two things are worth bearing in mind.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Lower risk of hospitalization plus far more cases equals increased hospitalizations.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s the risk. Far more cases means more hospitalizations, even at lower hospitalization rates.</p></div></div>

<b>Delusion.</b> Less understandable is simple delusion. This overlaps with misinformation, certainly, but involves simple rejection of the obvious facts at hand. Such as that the riot was caused by antifa, a claim that emerged hours after the riot, was
<a>re-rationalized</a>. Deluded assessments of what occurred on that day are myriad and, in all cases, driven not by observed fact but desired outcome.
<div><div><p>None of us is perfectly clear-eyed about anything. But on some things, objective reality is not particularly obscured.</p></div></div>
<p>If Trump had held a news conference on Nov. 7, 2020, and announced that he recognized Biden’s win, there is no riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. It is fundamentally Donald Trump’s fault, and there is no rational way to dispute that point.</p>

<div><h1>America’s living presidents — save one — warn about the danger our democracy faces</h1></div>

<div><div><p>With one exception.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Writing for the New York Times, former president Jimmy Carter <a>echoed</a> Biden’s concerns.</p></div></div>
<a>wrote</a> that he was “appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement.”
<div><p>“Insurrection could do grave damage to our Nation and reputation,” he continued. “In the United States of America, it is the fundamental responsibility of every patriotic citizen to support the rule of law.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>On Sept. 11, he went further. Speaking at a memorial to those killed in the 2001 terrorist attacks on that day, Bush tied that attack to the current threat.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday morning, former president Barack Obama, too, <a>raised this concern</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As of writing, former president Bill Clinton had not released a statement marking the anniversary of the riot. But he, too, is on record expressing concern about the state of American democracy.</p></div></div>
<a>said</a> during a virtual event in March. “We’re in a dogfight.” At another point, he used language similar to Biden and Obama: “It’s hard to keep a democracy going. We can do this, but it’s a job.”

<a>Trump’s role</a> in the riot at the U.S. Capitol was precisely as you might expect. Or, I should say, each of the three separate reactions Trump offered was precisely as you might expect: rambling, furious, accusatory, dishonest.
<p>A remarkable allegation, centered on the idea that something new had been “revealed.” And, if you are immersed in the pro-Trump — or anti-anti-Trump — media world, you’ve probably already come across the claim.</p>
<a>a fundraising campaign</a> on providing just this sort of evidence. (A lawsuit
<a>filed</a> against True the Vote by a donor frustrated at the organization’s failure to prove fraud was dismissed in April.)
<a>Stephen K. Bannon</a> as its 2021 “Patriot of the Year”)
<a>picked up</a> the Just the News story, prompting a spate of enthusiastic “now-we-got-’em” style

<div><h1>George W. Bush’s unmistakable takedown of Trumpism — and Trump</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>October 19, 2017</div></div>
<div><div>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</div></div>
<div><div><p>That changed in a big way Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Speaking at a George W. Bush Institute event in New York, Bush didn't use Trump's name, but his target became clearer as the speech progressed. Here's a sampling:</p></div></div>
<li>“Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication.”</li>
<li>“We’ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism.”</li>
<li>“We’ve seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty. . . . Argument turns too easily into animosity.”</li>
<li>“It means that bigotry and white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed, and it means the very identity of our nation depends on passing along civic ideals.”</li>
<li>“Bullying and prejudice in our public life … provides permission for cruelty and bigotry.”</li>
<li>“The only way to pass along civic values is to live up to them.”</li>
<div><p>Any one of these quotes in isolation could be dismissed as highflying rhetoric aimed at the general coarsening of our political culture — or the rise of forms of nationalism and extremism that clearly exist outside the Oval Office.</p></div>
<li>The founders of the Munich conference “would be alarmed by an increasing turn away from universal values and toward old ties of blood and race and sectarianism.”</li>
<li>“They would be alarmed by the hardening resentment we see toward immigrants and refugees and minority groups — especially Muslims.”</li>
<li>“They would be alarmed by the growing inability — and even unwillingness — to separate truth from lies.”</li>
<li>“They would be alarmed that more and more of our fellow citizens seem to be flirting with authoritarianism and romanticizing it as our moral equivalent.”</li>
<div><div><p>Sound familiar?</p></div></div>
<div><p>It's possible Bush would argue that Trump is more a symptom of all of these unhealthy trends in American democracy than the root of them. But in drafting a prepared speech like that, he had to know how those words would be perceived.</p></div>
<a>blaming him for 9/11</a> and
<a>for the Iraq War</a>. More recently, he has favorably
<a>compared his own hurricane response with the response to Hurricane Katrina</a>, which many view as the worst moment of Bush's tenure.
<div><div><p>On Thursday, Bush clearly decided that silence was no longer tenable.</p></div></div>
