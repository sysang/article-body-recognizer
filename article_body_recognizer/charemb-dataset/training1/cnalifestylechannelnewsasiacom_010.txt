<p>Still, the country is an exception in that it has no intention of undoing a long and arduous process of welcoming tourists back safely. It simply cannot afford another year of a collapse in tourism.</p>
<p>Even so, bookings have slowed “considerably”, said Mr Roemer. “We have only about a third of the daily booking volume we had in mid-November. At the end of last week (Dec 3), we even received some cancellations,” he said.</p>
<p>Manpower in his Thailand operation was back to 30 per cent of 2019 levels last month. Plans to raise this to 50 per cent from this month onwards are now on the backburner thanks to the slowdown in bookings.</p>
<p>Another Thailand-based inbound travel company, Asian Trails, also saw a slowdown in new bookings for the kingdom. “I hope the Thai government will persevere and keep borders open,” said group CEO Laurent Kuenzle.</p>
<p>“Most travellers will accept a PCR test before departure and a rapid test on arrival. Complicated paperwork should be abolished.”</p>
<h2>CROWDS NOT A WORRY, NEW RULES ARE</h2>
<p>It was sad to see both Changi and Suvarnabhumi airports largely empty. Even my Singapore Airlines flight to Bangkok was only 30 per cent full. In downtown Bangkok and in malls, tourists were few and far in between.</p>
<p>Governments overreacting to Omicron seem to forget that arrival numbers such as 20, 30 or 40 million visitors are in the glorious past and that it will take time to rebuild tourism. </p>
<p>The limiting factor may be travellers’ confidence that travel can remain a certainty and that the risk of getting caught somewhere is miniscule.</p>
<p>While pent-up demand for leisure travel is real, knee-jerk reactions freak people out. Only essential business travel and trips to see family will take place if this open-shut dynamic persists each time a new variant rear its head.</p>
<p>Andreas Birnik, the Singapore-based founder of the Modern Wine Group, had not seen his ageing parents in Sweden for two and a half years. When he finally could, he went ahead as booked on Dec 2.</p>
<p>With the huge costs to the tourism sector, jobs and so much more, perhaps it’s time countries commit to quit changing travel rules at the drop of a hat.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Italy ban on tourists from Singapore on COVID-19 concerns possibly 'clerical mistake', says ambassador </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Yasmin Begum </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The Italian Ambassador to Singapore said on Thursday (Dec 16) that a ban that his country has imposed on tourists from Singapore is possibly an "error". </p>
<p>On Nov 9, Singapore was removed from a <a>European Union list</a> of countries for which travel restrictions should be lifted. </p>
<p>The EU list, which is reviewed every two weeks, states that the criteria for being listed takes into account the country's "epidemiological situation and overall response to COVID-19".</p>
<p>Mr Vattani told CNA he thinks that this list is not reflective of Singapore's current situation. </p>
<p>"In Singapore, the number of COVID-19 cases now are much lower, almost 100 per cent of the population is vaccinated. The Omicron variant is almost absent," said the ambassador. </p>
<h2>SINGAPORE IN LIST OF HIGH-RISK COUNTRIES: ITALIAN HEALTH MINISTRY</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, the Italian embassy in Singapore released an <a>update</a> on its website, saying that its health ministry had on Tuesday classified Singapore and Brunei as “List E” countries. </p>
<p>The countries in this list are deemed to be of high risk of COVID-19 infections.</p>
<p>This means that Singapore residents will not be able to travel to Italy for leisure from Thursday. The ban will stay in place until Jan 31.</p>
<p>Travellers from Singapore and other List E countries may enter Italy only for work, health, study reasons; out of "absolute urgency" or if they are returning to their homes in Italy.</p>
<p>Mr Vattani added that this decision will affect not only Singaporeans but also Italians travelling back for the holidays as they would now have to serve quarantine. </p>
<p>Travellers to Italy will be required to produce a negative pre-departure polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test taken within the last 24 hours. They will also need to self-isolate upon arrival for ten days at a declared address.</p>
<p>They will need to produce another PCR test at the end of the 10-day self-isolation. </p>
<p>Transiting in Italy’s airports is allowed, provided that the traveller does not exit designated areas within the airport.</p>
<p>Singapore launched a vaccinated travel lane (VTL) with Italy on Oct 19. </p>
<p>The move, which is a unilateral one, allows all fully vaccinated travellers from Italy to enter Singapore. With the recent move, travellers from Italy can continue to travel to Singapore via the VTL without quarantine.</p>

<h1> IN FOCUS: After signs of recovery, how much damage is Omicron doing to the battered travel and tourism industry? </h1>
<p>Just as they were beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel, the travel and tourism industry now faces a new challenge in the potentially more infectious Omicron variant. CNA looks at how the industry is clawing its way back to a revival.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Vanessa Lim </a> </div> </div>
<p>For travel agency director Jahabar Sadiq, this meant returning to his office at Serangoon Road for the first time in almost two years.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old, who had to rely on odd jobs such as food delivery and part-time security for income, decided to switch back to working full-time at his centre, Rangoon Air Travel, earlier this month.</p>
<p>As Mr Sadiq stepped into the office, emotions welled up inside him.</p>
<p>His almost-brand new travel agency and visa processing centre, which had been forced to close its doors just a month after it was set up due to the introduction of the "circuit breaker", was coated with a thick layer of dust.</p>
<p>In the corner of the office were cardboard boxes still to be unpacked after nearly two years.</p>
<p>Sitting in his black swivel chair, a small smile spread across his face as he told CNA how it felt to be back.</p>
<p>"It's an indescribable feeling and so emotional for me to be here again, to sit in my own chair," said Mr Sadiq, who runs Rangoon Air Travel with three other partners.</p>
<p>Recalling the struggles he has faced, the father of two said his family had to watch their spending closely and cut back on unnecessary expenses.</p>
<p>"This (travel) business is our rice bowl and when flights stopped, we suddenly had no more rice – and life as we knew it was gone," said Mr Sadiq, who is the sole breadwinner.</p>
<p>"Whatever odd jobs I could find, I would do it," said Mr Sadiq, adding that he typically earned between S$50 and S$60 a day as a food delivery rider as well as a security officer.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a good feeling but what choice did I have?" he said. "I had to do whatever I could to help my family survive."</p>
<p>Figures released last month in Parliament showed that travel agents were <a>among the hardest hit by the pandemic</a>, with 157 – or 8 per cent of all licensed travel agents – ceasing operations since January 2020. </p>
<p>But the country's VTL scheme, which first kicked off in August, appears to have unleashed pent-up demand for travel. To date, Singapore has announced 27 air VTLs and one land VTL with Malaysia.</p>
<p>Online travel giant Expedia said searches for international VTL destinations on its website have tripled since August.</p>
<p>The pent-up demand for travel has resulted in a clear increase in demand for outbound travel for the year-end period, said the group's head of public relations for Asia, Ms Lavinia Rajaram.</p>
<p>Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, and Sydney were among the top five destinations for year-end travel among Singapore travellers, she said.</p>
<p>At Mr Sadiq's agency, which specialises in tour packages to India, phone lines have been ringing continuously since the Singapore-India VTL was announced last month.</p>
<p>"Once the news was out, people started calling us, messaging or even coming down to the office to ask us about the possibilities of getting a flight," he said, adding that the office was closed at the time.</p>
<p>"It got to a point where we were getting so many calls that we thought it would be better to open the centre up and have the customers come down instead," he said.</p>
<p>"By then, most of the other travel agencies had already reopened too, so it was time for us to let our regular customers know that we were still in the market and ready for business."</p>
<p>Things have also been looking up for Monster Day Tours founder and CEO Suen Tat Yam over the past few months.</p>
<p>Since expanding his business to include virtual and game tours, revenue has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>But a breakthrough came when he noticed one or two foreign-sounding names on his booking list a few months ago.</p>
<p>Having been through a nearly two-year tourism drought brought on by the pandemic, the 35-year-old was careful not to get his hopes up.</p>
<p>Then came the emails from people living overseas, who were enquiring about his company's tours and asking for booking details.</p>
<p>That was when he realised that the moment he had been waiting for – like so many others in the travel and tourism industry – had finally arrived: The return of overseas travellers.</p>
<p>"We were so happy because it felt reminiscent of the pre-COVID days, where we would receive tourist enquiries every day," he said. "So the tourists are starting to come back already and it's a good sign for us."</p>
<h2>A SHADOW OVER RECOVERY HOPES</h2>
<p>But while recovery appears to be on the cards for the travel and tourism sector, the industry isn't out of the woods yet.</p>
<p>The emergence of the Omicron variant has cast a shadow on the industry's plans for a revival, with health experts and governments concerned about its potentially higher transmissibility.</p>
<p>First identified in South Africa in November, Omicron was declared to be a <a>"variant of concern"</a> by the World Health Organization and has been detected in more than 60 countries, including Singapore.</p>
<p>The fifth such variant to be given the designation, it reflects a high number of mutations that could increase virus transmissibility and reduce the effectiveness of vaccines.</p>
<a>stricter testing requirements for travellers</a>. The country also held off on easing social restrictions.
<p>While scientists are still gathering data on the variant, travel companies CNA spoke to expressed concerns that new border restrictions could lead to a spike in cancellations.</p>
<p>"People are worried that we might go back into lockdown and they'll get stuck overseas, or new restrictions will be implemented and affect their plans, so out of fear, they would rather cancel or delay their trip," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, local firm Pegasus Travel said it is still receiving new enquiries for trips to Hong Kong and Australia, despite changes in quarantine rules.</p>
<p>"Some of these places that are tightening up travel restrictions already had longer quarantine periods, so we didn't really see much of a demand for them," he said.</p>
<p>"But for Europe, where we're seeing an upward trend in the number of COVID-19 cases, we might see changes in travel restrictions, so we may see a change (in demand)," he added.</p>
<p>As of Friday (Dec 17), Singapore had confirmed 24 Omicron cases, out of which, 21 were imported cases and three were local. </p>
<p>During a press conference on Tuesday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said it was not realistic to stop the variant from entering Singapore, when asked if the country would shut its borders to curb the spread of Omicron.</p>
<p>"We can't say ... for Delta variant, let's live with COVID (and then) for Omicron variant, let's have a zero-COVID policy. It is not coherent, it doesn't work that way."</p>
<p>The country's high vaccination rates could also help to limit the economic fallout of Omicron.</p>
<p>As of Dec 15, 87 per cent of Singapore's total population has completed their vaccination, according to figures from MOH's website. Out of those who are eligible for the national vaccination programme, 96 per cent have taken both shots.</p>
<p>Last week, the country's Health Sciences Authority (HSA) also approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine in children aged five to 11, with a plan to progressively open up bookings for the shots from next week.</p>
<p>Mr Christopher Khoo, managing director for international tourism consultancy Masterconsult Services, said while the new variant is concerning, it may not completely derail the industry's recovery plans.</p>
<p>"We're more aware of the transmissibility of the virus, and we've ingrained that into our old behaviours, following certain protocols like safe distancing and avoiding of crowds," he said.</p>
<p>"It's not going to be plain sailing and we might see one or two more surprises, but we are a lot more prepared this time around."</p>
<p>His sentiments were echoed by Pegasus Travel's Mr Tan, who is also the secretary-general of the National Association of Travel Agents Singapore (NATAS).</p>
<p>Having gone through nearly two years of disruptions, Mr Tan said travel firms have learnt how to adjust and adapt better to changes, making them more resilient.</p>
<p>"Omicron will definitely have an effect on us, but it will not be a devastating one which takes us back to square one, perhaps just one or two steps back," he said. "We should be able to conquer it and move on."</p>
<p>In the meantime, he said his company will take the opportunity to press on with its expansion plans. Earlier this year, it launched a S$1 million sister company to cater to a growing demand for private and customisable holidays.</p>
<p>It is now currently in the process of applying for grants from STB to improve its online booking system and reduce administrative work for its employees.</p>
<p>"We decided that the best way forward would be to offer a full spectrum of travel services and so, we invested more money to build up the new company, and brought in new talents who have the knowledge and skills we lacked before," he said.</p>
<p>"We want to come out stronger from the pandemic, and if we go back to doing things the same way we did before, definitely, we would not be able to survive."</p>
<p>But even as the industry looks ahead to a post-COVID future, it is unlikely that it will return to its original form due to major changes in the travel and tourism landscape, said experts.</p>
<p>Growing awareness over the importance of health and safety means large travel groups may become a thing of the past, said Ngee Ann Polytechnic senior tourism lecturer Michael Chiam.</p>
<p>"In terms of destinations, we might also see more people choosing places that are away from the hustle and bustle of the city, instead of those that tend to be more crowded with tourists," he said.</p>
<p>It's a pattern that some are already seeing, with travel companies observing an uptick in enquiries for more private and customised trips. That is despite higher prices, which could be as much as double that of large group tours.</p>
<p>With the COVID-19 situation still evolving, travellers have to grapple with ever-changing safety protocols imposed by different countries as well as the possibility of last-minute changes or unplanned scenarios.</p>
<p>Recalling the early days of travel arrangements such as the Reciprocal Green Lane and travel bubbles, Mr Tan said it was a struggle to keep up with all the changes and attend to affected travellers.</p>
<p>"The Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble, in particular, was a headache. It was delayed at least twice and never actually happened," he said.</p>
<p>"But the amount of work we had to do, whether it was cancelling existing flight bookings and getting refunds, or managing the credits for customers who wanted to change their flights to another destination, was significant."</p>
<p>"It took extra work to get all this done, for a trip that didn't materialise and one that we actually didn't get anything out of it because we didn't impose a service fee," he added.</p>
<p>"But what we got instead, was a certain amount of goodwill from our customers. And now that travel is restarting again, these customers are coming back to us."</p>
<p>This is where COVID-19 has presented an opportunity for travel agents to attract more customers, said Dr Chiam.</p>
<p>"So we will probably see more people opting for travel agents when planning their trip."</p>
<h2>SURVIVING THE TEST OF TIME</h2>
<p>Despite the uncertainties, travel and tour operators CNA spoke to say they are determined to ride out the storm until the industry eventually recovers.</p>
<p>A recent report by global consultancy firm McKinsey Company predicted that global tourism will return to pre-pandemic levels only by 2024.</p>
<p>But Dr Chiam said it might take even longer than that.</p>
<p>In Southeast Asia, only Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Bali have adjusted border measures to make leisure travel possible for tourism such as scrapping quarantine requirements for vaccinated travellers.</p>
<p>Masterconsult Services' Mr Khoo said he doesn't expect visitor numbers to get back to pre-COVID levels within this decade.</p>
<p>"2019 was actually the high point of travel and tourism for Singapore in terms of number of visitors and all other metrics," he said. "So we now have to start again from zero."</p>
<p>International visitor arrivals and tourism receipts soared to record highs in 2019. In that year, Singapore saw more than 19 million visitors, with tourism receipts hitting S$27.7 billion. </p>
<p>"A lot of the industry players themselves are badly battered, many low-cost carriers have ceased to exist and many national carriers are currently on skeletal staff, so that in itself will take time to recover," he said.</p>
<p>In addition, the current pent-up demand for travel may not be as strong as people think.</p>
<p>"We've all gone through about two years of economic hardship and that has reduced our savings that has diminished our job prospects, many people are struggling," he said.</p>
<p>"We may see the same demand that was present in 2019, where people want to go travelling but their bank accounts tell them differently, and it's likely that we'll see a lot less discretionary travel," he added.</p>
<p>But while it's a long road to recovery, experts remain confident that the travel and tourism industry's resilience will prove itself again and help it to bounce back.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades, the industry has demonstrated its ability to recover time after time, with crises such as Sars, ZIKA, Ebola, as well as the Sep 11 attacks, said Masterconsult Services' Mr Khoo.</p>
<p>"The industry has been pretty good in reacting to lower demand (such as) adjusting prices, or coming up with innovative packages or even promoting staycations," he said.</p>
<p>"So the tourism sector has not been slow in adapting and adopting new practices when need be."</p>
<p>Some, who managed to pull through the worst of the storm, have even carved out a niche for themselves in the market.</p>
<p>Monster Day Tours, which launched its first virtual tour last year, now has 15 local and overseas remote tours.</p>
<p>The firm also worked with a Singaporean game design company to create puzzle tours, in order to attract the locals.</p>
<p>"We have always believed that small, niche tours will be the future and I think COVID has only accelerated this," he said.</p>
<p>As for Mr Sadiq, he's hoping the new year will bring more luck and good fortune, even though he knows it will be a long road to recovery.</p>
<p>"Now that we're back and we're getting calls and enquiries, we're hoping that this time we can continue business and have more sales too," he said.</p>
<p>At that moment, the phones suddenly stop ringing and a silence descends upon the office. Minutes go by with Mr Sadiq and his business partner Nandakumar Ramanathaan just staring blankly at their screens.</p>
<p>It's an uncomfortable moment, a sign of troubling times, but one that Mr Sadiq has grown used to.</p>
<p>"When we first returned to the office, there were no customers here so it was just my partner and me. We were the only faces we saw for a while," he said, with a laugh.</p>
<p>"But we are going to continue because this is my passion, to serve my customers and also being in the travel industry, so I'm going to try and do whatever I can for my business to survive."</p>
<p>Unfazed, he looks back at his screen while chatting casually with Mr Ramanathaan.</p>
<p>Then, a man walks in. "Hi, I want to ask about flights to India."</p>

<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Travellers with a confirmed booking on a vaccinated travel lane (VTL) flight will not be affected after Singapore authorities announced <a>a freeze in new VTL ticket sales</a> from Thursday (Dec 23).</p>
<p>Those with confirmed bookings may proceed with their travel, Singapore Airlines (SIA) said on Wednesday, adding that transit passengers are also not affected by the new directive.</p>
<p>"Customers who wish to transit via Singapore on VTL flights during this period may continue to book their flights," said the airline in response to CNA's queries.</p>
<p>From 11.59pm on Wednesday, SIA will stop accepting new bookings for all VTL flights into Singapore that are scheduled between Thursday and Jan 20, 2022.</p>
<p>There is no change to existing VTL or test requirements, and travellers with existing bookings may enter Singapore without quarantine as long as they meet all VTL requirements, it added.</p>
<p>SIA and its sister airline Scoot operate VTL flights from more than 20 countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, India, South Korea, the US, Australia and a number of European countries.</p>
<p>Jetstar has VTL services from five destinations to Singapore, namely Kuala Lumpur, Bangkok, Phnom Penh, Darwin and Melbourne.</p>
<p>Malaysia Airlines said no new VTL flight tickets will be sold from midnight on Dec 23, and that it will continue to honour pre-existing VTL tickets that have been purchased.</p>
<p>It advised passengers who wished to travel via the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore VTL flight to "do so immediately", adding that sales of tickets will close by 11.59 pm on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Travellers must ensure they fulfil the conditions and requirements under the VTL by air programme, failing which they may be denied entry to board," said Malaysia Airlines. </p>
<p>"Customers will still be able to book flights on non-VTL flights, subject to the travel and health requirements at the arriving destination."</p>
<h2>TRAVELLERS MAY "WAIT AND SEE" </h2>
<p>Travel agency Chan Brothers said that existing customers booked on confirmed tours will not be affected as the freeze does not apply to those who already hold tickets for a VTL flight.</p>
<p>He added that they "remain optimistic" and will continue to monitor the evolving situation closely.</p>
<p>A spokesperson from SA Tours said that the agency had anticipated that the VTL flights would be suspended and did not accept any bookings for December and January.</p>
<p>"Our plans have been to start our tours in March and so far, we are not changing that but will monitor the situation closely," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>Ms Stella Chow, a senior manager of marketing at Hong Thai Travel, said that the news came as a surprise.</p>
<p>"However, we understand the overall COVID-19 situation is still very fluid and we will need to adapt to changes quickly," she said.</p>
<p>"We believe that customers’ mood will be affected by this news and many may choose to wait and see before making bookings," she said.</p>
<p>"(Although) we still expect the road to recovery to be a bumpy one, we know that leisure travel will come back as it’s already part of Singaporeans' lifestyle."</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday that Singapore will freeze all new ticket sales for VTL flights and buses between Dec 23 and Jan 20 next year, amid a "rapid spread" of Omicron cases in many countries.</p>
<p>MOH said on Monday that there have been 71 confirmed Omicron cases detected in Singapore, comprising 65 imported cases and six local infections.</p>
<p>There has been an increase in the daily number of imported COVID-19 cases in December, with 54 imported infections reported on Tuesday.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: All new ticket sales for vaccinated travel lane (VTL) flights and bus journeys will be frozen from Thursday (Dec 23) until Jan 20 next year, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>This comes amid a "rapid spread" of Omicron COVID-19 cases in many countries, the ministry said.</p>
<p>This is what you need to know about the freeze in new VTL ticket sales.</p>
<h2>WHAT CHANGES ARE BEING ANNOUNCED?</h2>
<p>Singapore will freeze all new ticket sales for VTL flights and buses between Dec 23 and Jan 20 next year. </p>
<p><a>No new VTL bus tickets </a>will be sold for travel into Singapore or Malaysia between 11.59pm on Dec 22 and 11.59pm on Jan 20, 2022, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) also said there will be no new ticket sales on designated VTL flights for entry into Singapore from all VTL countries from 11.59pm on Dec 22 to 11.59pm on Jan 20, 2022.</p>
<h2>WHO WILL NOT BE AFFECTED? </h2>
<p>All travellers who already hold a ticket for a VTL flight or bus journey can continue to travel under the VTL if they meet all other VTL requirements, said MOH.</p>
<p>Those who are not Singaporeans nor permanent residents can also continue to <a>apply</a> for their vaccinated travel pass (VTP).</p>
<p>Singaporeans, permanent residents and children aged 12 and below in the calendar year do not need to apply for a VTP to enter Singapore, said CAAS.</p>
<p>All VTL travellers have to take a pre-departure polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test or an antigen rapid test (ART) two days before departure.</p>
<p>On arrival, they will undergo a PCR test when they arrive at Changi Airport, or an ART if they arrive via the Causeway.</p>
<p>Travellers will also have to test themselves daily using ARTs. On days 2, 4, 5 and 6, travellers are required to submit their self-administered ART online using a link that will be sent to them.</p>
<p>On days 3 and 7, tests must be done under supervision at a combined test centre or a quick test centre.</p>
<h2>WHAT HAPPENS AFTER JAN 20, 2022? </h2>
<p>From Jan 21 next year, VTL quotas and ticket sales for travel will be temporarily reduced, said MOH.</p>
<p>From that date, the capacity and ticket sales for VTL land travel will be temporarily reduced by half – the equivalent of 24 bus rides per day one way, said MTI. </p>
<p>MTI added that it will monitor the situation closely and adjust the VTL land capacity, taking into account the public health situation in Singapore and Malaysia, as well as the global situation.</p>
<p>For entry into Singapore on VTL flights, total ticket sales will be capped at 50 per cent of the allocated quota, said CAAS. </p>
<h2>WHY ARE THESE CHANGES BEING INTRODUCED? </h2>
<p>More cases of the Omicron variant are being picked up in Singapore because of the rapid spread of the variant across many countries or regions, said MOH.</p>
<p>The Health Ministry said on Monday that there have been <a>71 confirmed Omicron cases </a>detected in Singapore, with 65 imported and six local.</p>
<p>"Our border measures will help to buy us time to study and understand the Omicron variant, and to strengthen our defences, including enhancing our healthcare capacity, and getting more people vaccinated and boosted," MOH said on Wednesday.</p>

<div> <div> <a> Natasha Ganesan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The <a>freezing of new ticket sales</a> for vaccinated travel lane (VTL) flights and buses is an “essential and prudent measure” to protect Singapore’s public health, said Transport Minister S Iswaran on Wednesday (Dec 22).</p>
<p>In a Facebook post, Mr Iswaran said that he understands that people might be “disappointed” by the changes to the scheme, which currently allows fully vaccinated travellers from 24 countries to enter Singapore without having to serve quarantine.</p>
<p>Mr Iswaran’s post comes after the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Wednesday that Singapore will pause ticket sales for VTL flights and buses between Dec 23 and Jan 20 next year.</p>
<p>He said that the Government had been “closely watching” the global development of the Omicron COVID-19 situation and decided to temporarily pause all new ticket sales, given the “rise” in Omicron cases.</p>
<p>Singapore has reported 71 confirmed Omicron cases, comprising 65 imported and six local infections.</p>
<p>The freeze, however, does not apply to passengers who already hold a VTL flight or bus ticket and meet all other requirements under the programme.</p>
<p>“I would like to assure those who already hold VTL flight tickets and meet all requirements under the VTLs: You can still continue to travel to Singapore without quarantine under the VTL scheme,” Mr Iswaran said in his Facebook post.</p>
<p>The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore also said on Wednesday that it will <a>enhance safety measures for airport workers</a>.</p>
<p>“We are adopting these measures to do our best to protect our frontline aviation workers,” Mr Iswaran said.</p>
<p>He added that Singapore must focus on ramping up its vaccination and booster programme as protection against the new variant.</p>
<p>“For those who are travelling, I wish you a safe journey. Let us all stay vigilant and stay safe,” said Mr Iswaran.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Singapore travellers who postponed their Seoul VTL holiday made a sound decision </h1>
<div> <p>The Singapore-South Korea VTL did not last long, with the Omicron variant being a key reason why travelling to South Korea would have been less pleasant in any case, Steven Borowiec says.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Steven Borowiec </a> </div> </div>
<p>SEOUL: The South Korea-Singapore Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) was a cause for guarded optimism when it launched in November. </p>
<p>The governments of the two countries agreed that vaccinated visitors could travel between the two countries without having to quarantine, provided that they test negative for COVID-19. </p>
<p>The VTL was highly anticipated. It was not only a chance for people from both counties to take a sorely needed holiday but also an experiment other countries were watching for replicable steps on how to safely crack open the travel envelop.</p>
<h2>SINGAPORE-SOUTH KOREA VACCINATED TRAVEL LANE HIGHLY ANTICIPATED </h2>
<p>Before 2020, travel between South Korea and Singapore was uncomplicated, with major airlines from both countries operating daily flights. </p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, South Korea was the ninth biggest source of incoming tourists to Singapore, with 646,000 tourists in 2019.</p>
<p>In the other direction, visitors from Singapore form a relatively small portion of inbound tourism to South Korea, which is dominated by travellers from China and Japan.</p>
<p>More than 80 per cent of South Koreans were vaccinated, and the country was finally transitioning out of the pandemic, albeit while maintaining the practices of contact-tracing and mask-wearing. It was “all systems go”.</p>
<h2>OMICRON IS KILLING TRAVEL</h2>
<p>That optimism didn’t last long. In early December, South Korea reported cases of the Omicron variant, which sent policymakers scrambling to contain a potentially dangerous new wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The first confirmed Omicron cases were reported on Dec 1, found in a South Korean couple who had returned from Nigeria. </p>
<p>Then, on Wednesday (Dec 22), Singapore’s Health Ministry announced that new ticket sales for all of the country’s VTLs would be frozen from Dec 23 to Jan 20 to limit exposure to Omicron.</p>
<p>The VTL will not be frozen entirely, as passengers who already have tickets will still be permitted to travel. </p>
<p>The Omicron scare might not be solely responsible for this pullback. Tensions have been escalating in South Korea even before the emergence of Omicron, as cases were rising following the loosening of social distancing restrictions.</p>
<p>Despite a high vaccination rate, this month, South Korea’s number of daily coronavirus cases have hit an unprecedented high of more than 7,000.</p>
<p>Bed occupancy for intensive care have soared to 88 per cent, far higher than the 75 per cent health authorities said would trigger emergency measures.</p>
<p>The South Korean government responded to the worsening situation by calling off plans to open up, and reinstated curfews on businesses and caps on how many people can gather.</p>
<p>President Moon Jae-in has also urged private hospitals to expand capacities and public hospitals to prioritise serious cases.</p>
<h2>RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESSES ARE TAKING A TOLL</h2>
<p>Fatigue over the virus is increasing. Like people in many countries around the world, South Koreans are frustrated that every time things seem to be turning the corner, a new variant emerges. </p>
<p>Small merchants associations are organising protests to call on the government to lift the restrictions. One cafe in the coastal city of Incheon won national media attention and some kudos, for openly pledging to defy the government’s orders.</p>
<p>In a notice pasted to the front door, the operator said the company has run up around a million dollars in debt and couldn’t afford to cut its hours of operations.</p>
<p>As the story of the cafe circulated online, the overwhelming response was not concern that this cafe was endangering public health, but commendation of the business’s decision to put their own livelihood ahead of government orders.</p>
<h2>VTL AN EMBODIMENT OF DISAPPOINTMENT</h2>
<p>The pandemic’s tug of war between optimism and pessimism continues, with the hope being that Omicron is less deadly than other variants, and vaccinations will mean fewer infections lead to serious symptoms or hospitalisation. </p>
<p>And so the VTL, which started as a hopeful symbol, now seems more an embodiment of disappointment, of trips not taken, memories not created, friends not visited. </p>
<p>Given the current climate – an evolving set of measures governing entrance and exit, and the risk that regulations could change at any moment, potentially stranding travellers abroad – now is probably not the best time to visit South Korea. </p>
<p>Singapore visitors longing to take a break from this pandemic and holiday in Seoul are better off at home for now. They should wait for things to improve – even if this seems like something we’ve been doing for a second year.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Badminton player Loh Kean Yew will become the first Singaporean to ever win a medal at the BWF World Championships after he beat India’s HS Prannoy on Friday (Dec 17).</p>
<p>The Singaporean’s 21-14, 21-12 over Prannoy in the men’s singles quarter-finals means that the world number 22 has progressed to the final four of the tournament in Huelva, Spain.</p>
<p>Loh will next face Denmark’s world number 3 Anders Antonsen in the semi-finals on Saturday.</p>
<p>Regardless of the result, Loh is now at least guaranteed a shared bronze.</p>
<p>While his previous two matches were relatively straightforward affairs for the Singaporean, this one was anything but, as Prannoy’s patient approach forced a number of long rallies and posed some issues.</p>
<p>However, Loh would go into the interval 11-8 ahead after a few mistakes by his opponent. While Prannoy did his best to stay within touching distance, the Singaporean would stretch his lead and take the first game.</p>
<p>Prannoy wasn’t out of it however, and took a 6-4 lead in the second game. However, Loh would keep focused and grind out a 11-8 interval lead. The 24-year-old continued in that vein to take the win in just over 40 minutes.</p>

<p>The victory marks the best ever finish for a Singaporean in any edition of the World Championships.</p>
<p>Yeo Jia Min had reached the women’s singles quarter-finals in the previous edition of the World Championships, while Ronald Susilo was also eliminated in the same stage in 2007.</p>
<p>The mixed doubles pair of Chayut Triyachart and Yao Lei also reached the quarters in 2011, while Jiang Yanmei and Li Yujia also achieved the same feat in 2007 for the women’s doubles.</p>
<p>The win is Loh’s first career victory over the Indian, having faced the world number 32 twice and losing on both occasions.</p>
<p>Earlier in the tournament, Loh <a>upset world number one Viktor Axelsen</a> in the first round, before going on to cruise past Austria's Luka Wraber in 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Loh then <a>thrashed Thailand’s Kantaphon Wangcharoen</a> in their round of 16 clash on Thursday, taking the match in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>In the previous edition of the World Championships, Loh made the last 16 before being knocked out by Chou Tien-Chen.</p>
<p>Loh won his <a>first career BWF World Tour Super 500 title</a> at the Hylo Open last month. He also took the <a>Dutch Open crown</a> in October.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Badminton player Loh Kean Yew beat world number 3 Anders Antonsen on Saturday (Dec 18) to book his place in the BWF World Championships final.</p>
<p>The Singaporean world number 22 overcame the Dane 23-21, 21-14 in the men’s singles semi-finals at the tournament in Huelva, Spain.</p>
<p>The match was the first career meeting between both players. Loh will face India’s Kidambi Srikanth in the final on Sunday.</p>
<p>Arguably the form player of the tournament, Loh has had it his way for most of the World Championships. However, Antonsen seemed to have an answer for the Singaporean early on as he edged to an early lead.</p>
<p>However, Loh would rattle off five consecutive points to take an 11-8 lead going into the interval.</p>
<p>And just when Loh looked to have the first game in the bag, Antonsen would save five game points. But Loh kept his composure and took the first game.</p>
<p>While Antonsen and Loh were once again neck and neck early in the second game, a combination of excellent defence from the Singaporean and errors from the Dane would see Loh take an 11-7 interval lead.</p>
<p>The Dane attempted to mount a stirring comeback, but Loh pressed on to claim a historic victory.</p>
<p>Loh’s victory comes a day after the 24-year-old beat India’s HS Prannoy in straight games to guarantee himself of at least a joint-bronze.</p>
<p>In doing so, Loh wrote his name into the history books as the first Singaporean to ever win a medal at the BWF World Championships.</p>
<p>The victory marks the best finish for a Singaporean in any edition of the World Championships.</p>
<p>Earlier in the tournament, Loh <a>upset world number one Viktor Axelsen</a> in the first round, before going on to cruise past Austria's Luka Wraber in 25 minutes.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Badminton player Loh Kean Yew has sealed his place in the history books by becoming the first Singaporean to win a BWF World Championships title.</p>
<p>The world number 22 beat India’s Kidambi Srikanth 21-15, 22-20 in the men’s singles final in Huelva, Spain, on Sunday (Dec 19) to cap off a fairytale run.</p>
<p>Unseeded in the tournament, Loh stunned the likes of world number one Viktor Axelsen and world number three Anders Antonsen en route to taking the crown.</p>
<p>The match was the second career meeting between both players. Loh had not beaten world no 14 Srikanth prior to this clash.</p>
<p>And it was his opponent who took the initiative in the first, as he raced to a 9-3 lead. While a series of nifty net returns help Loh claw his way back, he would trail 7-11 going into the interval.</p>
<p>Yet the Singaporean remained mentally unflappable and he roared back to life with a 13-12 lead. Loh would hold firm and then go on to take the first.</p>
<p>However, the Indian was far from done and his powerful smashes caused problems for Loh as he took a 9-6 lead. Yet the Singaporean would strike back and go ahead 11-9.</p>
<p>And Srikanth came back with a vengeance, edging ahead 17-15. But Loh showed his mettle and would go on to seal the victory.</p>
<p>Earlier in the tournament, Loh <a>upset world number one Axelsen</a> in the first round, before going on to cruise past Austria's Luka Wraber in 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Loh then <a>thrashed Thailand’s Kantaphon Wangcharoen</a> in their round of 16 clash on Thursday, taking the match in just 30 minutes.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: In the days leading up to the biggest victory of his life, Loh Kean Yew was silent on social media.</p>
<p>"That was something I needed to do so as to focus, and not have any expectations (placed on me), not have any distractions," he told CNA.</p>
<p>"It was an intentional decision."</p>
<p>Instead, the bubbly 24-year-old did all his talking on the court.</p>
<p>Drawn against possibly the worst opponent he could have hoped for in the first round of the badminton World Championships, the apprentice beat the master as the Singaporean upset world number one Viktor Axelsen in a win for the ages.</p>
<p>After cruising past Austria's Luka Wraber in the second round, Loh then <a>thrashed Thailand’s Kantaphon Wangcharoen</a> in their round of 16 clash on Thursday, taking the match in just 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The commentators were flabbergasted, Kantaphon was shellshocked, and Loh marched on.</p>
<a>first Singaporean to win a BWF World Championship title</a>. The world number 22 beat India’s Kidambi Srikanth 21-15, 22-20 in the men’s singles final in Huelva, Spain, on Sunday (Dec 18) to cap off a fairytale run.
<p>"He did play well and I also was nervous," admitted Loh. "His shots are quite deceptive, so it was not easy."</p>
<p>"I can finally tell the world how happy I am because I have been holding back (how I feel) and I needed to stay focused," he said with a laugh. "Now I can finally tell (everybody) that I'm really happy."</p>
<p>Loh also made it a point to thank those behind him for their unwavering support.</p>
<p>But the Singaporean is determined not to rest on his laurels.</p>
<p>"This was my goal all along, I've always dreamt of it, but I never thought it would happen so soon," he said.</p>
<p>"There's still a long way to go."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Five things to know about Singapore's new badminton world champion Loh Kean Yew </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Matthew Mohan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Local badminton player Loh Kean Yew made history on Sunday (Dec 19) by becoming the <a>first Singaporean to win</a> a BWF World Championships title.</p>
<p>The world No 22 beat India’s Srikanth Kidambi 21-15, 22-20 in the men’s singles final in Huelva, Spain to cap off a stunning run which saw him knock out several top names en route to the crown.</p>
<p>Here's what you should know about the newly minted men's singles world champion:</p>
<p>Loh shot to prominence when he beat badminton superstar Lin Dan at the 2019 Thailand Open final and has since shown a penchant for giant-killings.</p>
<p>In the last two months, he has beaten world No 1 Axelsen (World Championships), world No 2 Kento Momota (Indonesia Open), world No 3 Anders Antonsen (World Championships) and world No 4 Chou Tien Chen (Hylo Open).</p>
<p>Outside the world's top five, he has also beaten world No 10 Rasmus Gemke twice (Hylo Open and Indonesia Open) and world No 7 Lee Zii Jia (French and Hylo Open).</p>
<p>Loh's World Championships win comes on the back of a scintillating run of form since the Tokyo Olympics in July.</p>
<p>Prior to this historic win, Loh finished second at the Indonesia Open, won the Hylo Open in Germany and the Yonex Dutch Open in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>2. Training stint with Axelsen </p>
<p>In September, Loh was in Dubai on a month-long training stint with Axelsen and four other players – Englishman Toby Penty, Canadian Brian Yang, Swede Felix Burestedt and India’s Sen Lakshya.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, he (Axelsen) is an Olympic champion ... like how many times can you train with an Olympic champion?"</p>
<p>After his Hylo Open win, Loh said that training with the Dane had helped to sharpen his defensive skills.</p>
<p>“When you play with Axelsen, you’ll need to work on your defence. His attacks are so strong that if you want to play with him, you’ve got to take his attacks," he said.</p>
<p>3. Born in Malaysia, but spent much of his life in Singapore</p>
<p>The 24-year-old was born in Penang, Malaysia. His love for the sport began at the age of four when Loh would use the gate outside his home as a net for playing badminton.</p>
<p>At 13, Loh received a scholarship in Singapore. Along with his elder brother Kean Hean, who also represented Singapore, Loh would become a citizen several years later.</p>
<p>"It wasn't easy making the decision as I would be away from my parents, but for our education and career, coming to Singapore was necessary," said Loh previously. </p>
<p>"I have no regrets coming here, becoming a Singaporean and serving National Service. I have spent many years here and I feel like a Singaporean. And I’m proud to wear the Singapore flag on my chest."</p>
<p>4. Overcoming inconsistency</p>
<p>Loh said on a number of occasions that he hopes to be more consistent in his performances.</p>
<p>“This is only one tournament, it is important to do this every tournament,” Loh said after his Hylo Open win.</p>
<p>“To be consistent means to perform at every match to a certain level,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s like a bowler trying to hit a strike every time – they have trained so many years to do so. It’s only at that point of time how they think and all that affects their play ... It is mostly mental.”</p>
<p>5. Paris 2024 on his mind</p>
<p>At this year's Olympic Games, Loh was one of Singapore's flag bearers. He performed admirably, winning two of his three group-stage games.</p>
<p>However, an agonising three-game loss to Indonesia's Jonatan Christie ended his participation.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media following his exit, Loh said that he would like a shot at another Games."That's another goal of mine. This time I didn't get a medal, so hopefully (in) the next one," he said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> From 'cheeky' child to world champion: Loh Kean Yew's parents proud of their youngest son's meteoric rise </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Matthew Mohan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: There were times where their heart ached.</p>
<p>It was an ache of pain, of longing, of parents missing their teenage son.</p>
<p>And even till this day, Mdm Grace Gan and Mr Loh Pin Keat choke up when they think of their youngest child being away from home.</p>
<p>"It’s never easy. You miss your son growing up, you’re always worried if he is sick, so worried," Mr Loh told CNA over the phone from their family home in Penang. </p>
<p>"We were not (able to be) there, we couldn't see him grow up 24/7," added Mdm Gan.</p>
<p>At just 13 years old, Kean Yew moved away from his family and took up a scholarship from the Singapore Sports School. </p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of his older brother Kean Hean, who had secured a scholarship at Monfort Secondary, Kean Yew went to Singapore, where he continued his education, honed his craft and became a citizen.</p>
<p>Kean Hean is today also a national badminton player and has represented Singapore at several Southeast Asian Games.</p>
<p>"We were not rich enough to send our children overseas to study (without the scholarships). In fact, we always told them, everything you have to depend on yourself," said Mdm Gan.</p>
<p>"Opportunity only comes once. If you don't grab it, it will be gone."</p>
<p>While the separation was difficult for his parents, they took comfort in their network of friends and family members such as Mdm Gan's brother, who looked out for Kean Yew and his brother in Singapore.</p>
<p>There was also a former classmate of Mr Loh's, who was Kean Yew's guarantor for his stay at the Sports School.</p>
<p>There was the family of Kean Hean's doubles partner Terry Hee, who among others occasionally provided a place for Kean Yew to stay during the weekends.</p>
<p>There were also the coaches at the Sports School, who kept an eye out for the precocious Kean Yew.</p>
<p>And as Mdm Gan reflected, both she and Mr Loh are "thankful and blessed".</p>
<h2>'MY BOYS ARE GOOD BOYS'</h2>
<p>Growing up, Mdm Gan recalled how Kean Yew, the youngest of four boys, was a cheeky child.</p>
<p>"But to be frank, we are blessed. My boys are very good boys, very disciplined, obedient."</p>
<p>Kean Yew's love for badminton began at the age of four when he would use the gate outside his home as a net.</p>
<p>"I remember that around the age of four, I would play at the front gate with my brothers," he told CNA previously. "My neighbour would play with us. When I was young he would let us win and gave one of his medals. </p>
<p>"It was actually a swimming medal but I was young and didn’t know what it was. I was just happy to get a medal."</p>
<p>But it wasn't long before he was winning competitions for real.</p>
<p>After completing his studies at Singapore Sports School, Kean Yew went on to further his education at Republic Polytechnic.</p>
<p>But it was then he decided that he would need to quit school to focus on badminton full-time.</p>
<p>"Initially we were shocked that he came to this decision, but after he explained to us (we understood) that he was mature enough and believed and trusted that he could do it," said Mdm Gan.</p>
<p>"He was such a good boy who was disciplined and knew what he wanted to do, so we just trusted him and supported him all the way.”</p>
<p>It was a decision that paid dividends as Kean Yew climbed the rankings year after year.</p>
<p>After completing his National Service, Kean Yew went on to rise to prominence when he beat badminton superstar Lin Dan at the <a>2019 Thailand Open final</a>.</p>
<p>The spotlight continued to shine on Kean Yew when the 24-year-old represented Singapore at this year's <a>Olympic Games</a>. Kean Yew was also the flag bearer for the country.</p>
<p>"We were proud that he manage to qualify for the Olympics because he had been looking forward to that and finally he qualified," reflected Mdm Gan.</p>
<p>Ever since Tokyo, Kean Yew has been on a sensational run of form.</p>
<p>Prior to this historic win, Kean Yew finished second at the Indonesia Open, won the Hylo Open in Germany and the Yonex Dutch Open in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>But drawn against world number one Viktor Axelsen in the first round of the World Championships, Mdm Gan and Mr Loh could only hope and pray for the best.</p>
<p>"At the back of our minds, we hoped and prayed that he will upset him. There’s a bit of chance and that’s why we always ask him to believe in himself that he can do it," Mdm Gan recalled.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what their son did.</p>
<p>After wins against Austria's Luka Wraber, <a>Thailand’s Kantaphon Wangcharoen</a> and India's HS Prannoy, Kean Yew beat world number three Anders Antonsen to book his spot in the men's singles final and seal his place in the history books.</p>
<p>With bated breath, his parents watched on from their home in Penang.</p>
<p>“We were kan cheong of course, very scared!” Mdm Gan said with a laugh. “The opponent is a very good player, he played very very well and is a very experienced player.”</p>
<p>“We were worried (when he was behind at the first interval) … We were scared that he would lose the first set or go to a rubber set because it was quite a big lead. But luckily, he managed to overturn it.”</p>
<p>The world number 22 would go on to beat India’s Kidambi Srikanth 21-15, 22-20 and <a>win the men's singles crown</a>.</p>
<p>‘When he was on the podium receiving the prize, it was very emotional (for us)," said Mdm Gan.</p>
<p>It has been almost two years since Mdm Gan and Mr Loh have seen Kean Yew in person.</p>
<p>They miss him, but note that restrictions have made a reunion challenging.</p>
<p>"I want to hug him but didn't get to hug him. Luckily, one of his brothers is here so I hugged the brother instead," said Mdm Gan, roaring with laughter.</p>
<p>"Of course, we would love for him to be back but then cannot come back so (we) asked him to focus on his training."</p>
<p>While his parents look forward to reuniting with him, his neighbours are also excited to see the newly minted world champion, said Mdm Gan.</p>
<p>"They (our neighbours) are very happy and proud ... Everybody is saying that when he comes back, (they) want him to sign autographs, sign on their shirt and their bag," she said.</p>
<p>"We are so proud ... It is all due to him, he knows what he wants to do. His discipline, his hard work and sacrifice allowed him to get to this day."</p>
<p>But despite Mdm Gan and Mr Loh's modesty, it is clear Kean Yew's success is theirs as well.</p>
<p>After all the trials and tribulations, their cheeky son is now a world champion.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Loh Kean Yew’s smashing World Championships win is no fluke </h1>
<div> <p>Loh Kean Yew’s unique expeditions post-national service might have made the sum difference in him getting to the top of the badminton world, says Jan Lin Lee.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jan Lin Lee </a> </div> </div>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO, California: The speed, the precision, the badminton IQ. Those watching Loh Kean Yew at the 2021 BWF World Championships in Spain have witnessed one of the biggest sporting moments in badminton history. </p>
<p>The 24-year-old has smashed his way to a historic victory, defeating several top seeded players methodically, one mad match at a time.</p>
<p>This fairy tale run rounds up nearly 20 years since a Singaporean male shuttler stood on the podium of a badminton world championship. </p>
<p>Even as it did take a while for our youth to become truly competitive beyond the junior stage.</p>
<h2>FOCUSING ON GROOMING TALENT AT A YOUNG AGE BETTER STRATEGY</h2>
<p>Lee retired in 2008 and Susilo followed several years later. Lee never got past the second round at the World’s, while Susilo’s best result was a quarter final finish at the 2007 edition, which was also the last time he competed in the event.</p>
<p>Now, Loh was 13 when he arrived in Singapore from Penang in 2010 after receiving a scholarship from the Singapore Sports School to study and train as a student-athlete. </p>
<p>Like many promising Malaysian shuttlers, he was also offered a spot at the Bukit Jalil Sports School in Kuala Lumpur that has groomed numerous world class athletes for the nation.</p>
<h2>SQUARING AWAY NATIONAL SERVICE</h2>
<p>Kean Yew is certainly not the first promising national shuttler to defer his post-secondary education in order to first complete NS at the prime of his youth in having a shot at succeeding as a full-time badminton player.</p>
<p>While Wong neither scaled high on the world rankings, he did bag a historic men’s singles silver medal for Singapore at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p>Loh too candidly shared on social media that while he enjoyed NS, the two years in service did affect his badminton career.</p>
<p>What made a difference was a remarkable “plot twist” immediately after his ORD when he was 21.</p>
<h2>NON-STOP ACTION SINCE ORD-ING</h2>
<p>Just weeks after completing his NS in 2018, determined to make up for “lost time”, he signed with Langhoj Badminton Club of the Danish Badminton League based out of the small Danish city of Struer for three months. </p>
<p>In his three months based in Denmark, Loh maximised his time in Europe travelling to Germany and Scotland where he dove right back into international tournaments, as rusty as he was.</p>
<p>He shocked top seed and the once indomitable Lin Dan in two straight games to claim his maiden BWF World Tour title.</p>
<h2>FROM OUT OF HIS LEAGUE TO OUT OF HIS COMFORT ZONE</h2>
<p>This once unthinkable move orchestrated by Axelsen speaks of the emergence of a new, highly globalised generation of shuttlers breaking down national borders even – or especially – in a time of COVID-19.</p>
<p>A film producer based in California, Jan is a former school badminton player and has fond memories working on the professional badminton circuit and for the Olympics as a media professional.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Newly crowned <a>BWF men’s singles world champion</a> Loh Kean Yew has returned home, arriving at Changi Airport on Tuesday (Dec 21) afternoon.</p>
<p>Along with national singles coach Kelvin Ho and physiotherapist Ho Jia Ying, Loh’s flight touched down at Terminal 1 at about 4pm.</p>
<p>There was no public reception for Loh due to COVID-19 safe management measures at the airport.</p>
<p>However, his KLM flight was given a water salute on arrival, similar to the one 2016 Olympics swimming gold medalist Joseph Schooling had received upon his arrival in Changi.</p>
<p>After clearing his polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, Loh and his team emerged to cheers and applause close to two hours later, waving to the media and bystanders.</p>
<p>He was received by Singapore Badminton Association (SBA) President Lawrence Leow and Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Edwin Tong.</p>
<p>“I'm just glad to be back,” said Loh, who posed with his medal before heading for a press conference.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old <a>sealed his place in the history books</a> on Sunday by becoming the first Singaporean to win a BWF World Championships title.</p>
<p>Loh beat India’s Kidambi Srikanth 21-15, 22-20 in the men’s singles final in Huelva, Spain to cap off a fairytale run.</p>
<p>Based on the latest BWF rankings, Loh has risen to 15th in the world.</p>
<p>Speaking to the media later in the day, Loh said that the result was "a new beginning" but there remains room for improvement.</p>
<p>"I am now the world champion but I still think there's still a long way to go, there's still many things I have to improve on compared to those top players like Viktor (Axelsen) and Kento (Momota)," he said.</p>
<p>"Their shots are much more consistent and there's a lot more that I need to work on - like court fitness, mental (strength), how they handle all the pressure."</p>
<p>Loh pointed out that a "different mindset" will be needed from here on, something he will learn as he plays in more tournaments.</p>
<p>"I've been the underdog but now I am going to be one of those that people want to beat ... very badly ... It's very different from how I played all along, it's going to be a different mindset so it's going to be a very big challenge for me."</p>
<p>He also singled out his coach Kelvin Ho for particular praise.</p>
<p>"I have a lot of people supporting me throughout my whole career so I am very thankful ... especially coach Kelvin. He has been helping me (for) ten years ... (through) every up and down," shared Loh.</p>
<p>"Without Kelvin here, I wouldn't have won this medal for sure. And of course, hopefully we can continue to work on this together until Paris 2024."</p>
<p>During his time back home, Loh said that he would be taking a break from badminton and spending time with his family.</p>
<p>"After that, I will continue my training with Viktor in Dubai and play a few competitions," he said. </p>
<p>Singapore Badminton Association president Lawrence Leow described the occasion as a "truly historic and happy" one.</p>
<p>"This year I think Christmas has come early, this is made possible by this man (Loh) here," added Mr Leow.</p>
<p>The BWF World Championships does not come with an accompanying cash prize and there are no local monetary incentives for winning a medal there. But Mr Leow said that there are plans to get more sponsors on board.</p>
<p>"We have started some work already and there will be some announcement in due course."</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Four Singapore athletes who made their mark in 2021 will be honoured with an open-top bus parade on Sunday (Dec 26).</p>
<p>The four athletes are Aloysius Yapp, Loh Kean Yew, Shayna Ng and Yip Pin Xiu. </p>
<p>"Four athletes have done extraordinarily well this year, by coming in top positions at global competitions in their respective sport," said Sport Singapore (SportSG) on Friday. </p>
<p>Members of the public who are in town can expect to catch a glimpse of the champions on an open-top bus on Sunday afternoon, which will be held in the city area between 1pm and 3pm. </p>
<p>"In view of the COVID-19 situation, specific locations and route details will not be shared prior to the parade to avoid congregation," said SportSG. There will also be no pit stops in between. </p>
<p>The parade is held in recognition of their achievements and to "celebrate their successes with fellow Singaporeans", it added. </p>
<p><a>Aloysius Yapp</a> was the first Singaporean to reach world number 1 in the World Pool-Billiard Association rankings. </p>
<p>Loh Kean Yew, who won a gold medal at the Badminton World Federation (BWF) World Championships, was the <a>first Singaporean to clinch the prestigious world title</a>. </p>

<p>Yip Pin Xiu added to her Paralympic haul with <a>two gold medals</a> at the Tokyo Games in September, taking her total to five gold and one silver, dating back to the 2008 Beijing Paralympics.</p>
<p>The parade is held by the Singapore Sport Institute, in collaboration with Cuesports Singapore, Singapore Badminton Association, Singapore Bowling Federation and the Singapore Disability Sports Council. </p>
<p>In a Facebook post on Friday, Team Singapore (Team SG) reminded members of the public not to gather in crowds and to maintain safe distancing. </p>
<p>"As the year comes to an end, we would like to celebrate our national athletes’ achievement with Singaporeans, and thank everyone for your support as One Team Singapore," said Team SG. </p>
