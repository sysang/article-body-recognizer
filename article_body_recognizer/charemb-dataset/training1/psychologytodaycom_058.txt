<h1> Gender Inequality, the Real Driver of Sex Trafficking </h1>
<h2> Sex trafficking is a highly-gendered crime. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> The Fundamentals of Sex </li> <li> <a>Find a sex counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Combatting gender inequality is needed for combatting sex trafficking.</li>
<li>Women and girls in prostitution need to be seen as victims, not criminals.</li>
<li>A range of legal protections can decrease the vulnerability of women.</li>
<li>Attacking misogyny and sexism could shrink the commercial sex trade. </li>
<p>It is a stark fact of life: Most <a>sex</a> traffickers and their clients are men, while the vast majority of those who are sex trafficked are women and girls.</p>
<h3>A Highly-Gendered Crime</h3>
<a>crime</a>. Much of its prevalence can be laid at the door of
<a>gender</a> inequality, says Yasmeen Hassan, founder of Equality Now. It’s women and girls who are more vulnerable, economically and socially, and it’s men who have increasingly normalized the buying of female bodies for sex.
<a>discrimination</a>, including sex trafficking.
<p>The organization has had its share of success. Equality Now has played an important role in changing more than 50 sex discriminatory laws – including those allowing rape, child <a>marriage</a>, and so-called “honor” killings. </p>
<h3>A Highly Lucrative Crime</h3>
<p>Hassan has a list of ways in which women and girls end up in the sex trade. A constant in all the situations is the exploitation of women that comes about from their unequal status. These include:</p>
<p>● Sold into prostitution because of poverty</p>
<p>● <a>Deceived</a> into signing contracts for jobs and ending up in sex trade</p>
<p>● Tricked by “boyfriends” and trapped in prostitution</p>
<p>● Trafficked into temporary marriages for sex</p>
<p>● Sold into child marriages or trafficked as sex slaves during times of conflicts or natural disasters</p>
<p>● Advertised and sold on the internet</p>
<p>● Trafficked in organized virginity sales.</p>
<h3>Criminalization versus Decriminalization </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Adobe Stock Image</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Hassan notes that traffickers look for opportunities in places where the sex trade is legal. In these cases, it’s much easier for the market to flourish. </p>
<p>Sweden, Norway, Iceland, France, Canada, Northern Ireland, and Ireland have decriminalized women and criminalized traffickers. The result? Sex trafficking has been reduced, says Hassan.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in countries that have legalized commercial sex, such as the Netherlands and Germany, sex trafficking has increased. The result? There’s also an increase in international sex tourism and local demand.</p>
<p>Hassan notes that in addition to criminalizing traffickers, pimps and brothel owners, it is essential to address the underlying misogyny and sexism of the “johns” who normalize the purchase of women’s bodies. </p>
<p>Equality Now is working with a diverse range of advocacy groups focusing on poverty, <a>addiction</a>, homelessness, <a>foster care</a>, LGBTQI youth, to take this agenda forward.</p>
<p>Equality Now is also calling for urgent and collective action to address new threats posed by the misuse of the internet and digital technology. Hassan contends that governments must regulate the digital space to protect against abuse. </p>
<p>The experiences of women who have survived sex trafficking are instructive. Hassan cites the words of a survivor of sex trafficking from India: </p>

<h1> "I Think Someone Drugged Me" </h1>
<h2> Advice for people who believe someone has slipped them a drug. </h2>
<li>Getting drugged without your knowledge can be terrifying and traumatic. The drugs may cloud your memory for events.</li>
<li>If you suspect someone has drugged you, immediately get emergency medical help.</li>
<li>At the hospital, ask for a forensic nurse examiner or victim advocate to support you.</li>
<li>Request a “tox panel,” which includes testing you for medications and common “date rape drugs.” </li>
<p>Often, it takes a drugging victim a while to get a clear head and figure out what might have happened. This confusion is portrayed movingly in Michaela Cole’s hit HBO series, I May Destroy You.</p>

<h1> Behind-the-Scenes Look into "Ken and Barbie" Killing Spree </h1>
<h2> The former friend and co-worker of a killer speaks out after three decades. </h2>
<li>A former friend of one of the killers offers a behind-the-scenes perspective into what has been called Canada's biggest trial.</li>
<li>Why one brutal killer remains in prison and the other is free</li>
<li>The trial, which included a series of torture videos, has been called Canada's trial of the century.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Ken Barbie killers Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka</div> <div>Source: Discovery, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>“Karla should still be in jail too,” Black said in a telephone interview. “She was caught red-handed.”</p>
<p>Jennifer Black first met Karla Homolka in 1985 when Homolka applied for a job at a pet store in St. Catharines, where Black worked. Because of that job, Homolka met Paul Bernardo while working at a pet convention in Toronto.</p>
<p>Black blames Bernardo’s defense attorney Murray for not turning over the tapes earlier, which would have meant Homolka would not have gotten a plea bargain and might still be in custody.</p>
<p>Murray, for his part, told CBS News, "I'm just as relieved for everyone involved that it's now over. Now, hopefully, everyone can get on with their lives."</p>
<p>For Black, it is not over. The effect of the murder spree has been profound. “My heart aches for the victims,” she said. “I've been diagnosed with <a>PTSD</a>.”</p>
<p>Three decades later, Black hopes that discussing the murders and first-hand knowledge of the killers now will provide a new perspective and possibly be cathartic for others.</p>
<p>Then, once Black learned of Homolka’s involvement, the truth sunk in. “How could I know someone evil like that?” Black asked. “I think this is something that's made me who I am.”</p>

<h1> Is Criminality a Result of "the Lottery of Birth?" </h1>
<h2> Determinism re-examined. </h2>
<li>The environment is not all-determining with respect to criminal behavior. Everyone chooses to how to deal with the "lottery" of their birth.</li>
<li>While some view poverty, inequality, and addiction as root causes of crime, others simply view them as risk factors.</li>
<li>Asserting that crime is the inevitable result of circumstances insults those with challenging backgrounds who do not become criminals.</li>
<p>Even the judge who sentenced Mr. Y to a half-century of incarceration referred to the “lottery of birth” by which the perpetrator was “born into a family of many many challenges.”</p>
<a>anger management</a>” problems, and ended up in various detention centers and
<a>psychiatric</a> facilities. Ostensibly because he did not have a father involved in his life, Mr. Y gravitated to the “older men of a street gang” that sold drugs, including heroin and fentanyl. The gang also trafficked in firearms.
<a>childhood</a> troubles” were what “set him on a path to prison.” The inference is that this man was a victim of his environment and, just as a needle on a compass points north, Mr. Y was pointed toward the penitentiary.
<p>Did <a>the environment</a> mold Mr. Y as though he were an unformed lump of clay and turn him into a criminal?</p>
<h3>Risk factors vs. "root causes" of crime</h3>
<p>We do not choose the environment into which they are born, nor do we choose our parents. However, from the time we are quite young, we constantly are making choices as to how we deal with whatever arises from our “lottery of birth.” </p>
<a>sibling</a> would wind up in prison or dead. He wanted to make something of himself and saw more attractive possibilities in going to school and staying away from gangs.
