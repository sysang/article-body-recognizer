<header><div> <a>Culture</a></div><h1>The 25 Most-Watched Movies on Netflix in 2021</h1><div> By Samuel Spencer <time>On 12/28/21 at 7:00 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> Culture Netflix <a>Movies</a></div>
<p>However, it was the action movies that dominated the Netflix charts, with films like Red Notice and Army of the Dead among the most-watched of the year.</p>
<p>Here's the films that most dominated the Netflix top 10 charts across the world according to analytics website FlixPatrol.</p>
<h2>Netflix's 25 most-watched movies of 2021</h2>
<h2>24. To All the Boys: Always and Forever</h2>
<p>Lara Jean (played by Lana Condor) was probably the first breakout character from any of Netflix's original movies, and in 2021 the streamer sent her off to college – but not before she charmed her way out of one last love triangle.</p>
<h2>23. The Kissing Booth 3</h2>
<p>Just beating out Lara Jean was Elle (Joey King). She is, of course, the star of the Kissing Booth movies which, it has to be admitted, get further and further from being about a kissing booth with every installment the streamer puts out.</p>
<h2>22. The Forgotten Battle</h2>
<h2>21. My Little Pony: A New Generation</h2>
<a>Fox News</a> upset. The outlet fans a story that the franchise had "
<a>gone woke</a>" when it tried to "send a message to kids about empowerment, unity and reform" with its progressive-leaning ponies.
<h2>20. Major Grom: Plague Doctor</h2>
<p>Major Grom is a police detective from a series of comic books released in Russia in 2012. Netflix, however, brought the story of Grom and his hunt for a serial killer in a plague mask to worldwide attention in 2021.</p>
<p>Another Netflix movie that mashes up two genres, Blood Red Sky combines the tropes of the plane hijack movie with vampires. And now, the world will never take another flight without a few bulbs of garlic and holy water just in case.</p>
<p>Sandra Bullock was one of the first a-listers to jump ship to Netflix, with her Bird Box one of the early hits for the service. Now, she returns with the story of a woman rebuilding her life after coming out of prison.</p>
<p>Jason Momoa has become known for the fun, breezy energy he has brought to films like Dune and Aquaman. With Sweet Girl, he uses his star power to play a different sort of character – a grieving father out for revenge from Big Pharma.</p>
<p>Not happy just to give their money to the big studios to get animated kid's films, 2021 was the year in which Netflix started to release their own. One of the most hyped was Vivo, thanks to the involvement of Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>
<p>Movies about female assassins with first-name titles are becoming a micro-genre of their own. First we had Lucy and Hanna, then Ava in 2020 and now finally Kate, a revenge thriller starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead taking on the Tokyo underground.</p>
<p>Post-apocalyptic thrillers starring teens may seem a bit of a throwback to the 2010s at this point, but Hollywood keeps churning them out. The latest is Love and Monsters, with Dylan O'Brien heading in the barren wastes to find his girlfriend.</p>
<a>Kanye West</a> song "Through the Wire." Instead, it sees Anthony Mackie (months before he became the new Captain America) as an android trying to avert a global catastrophe in the year 2036.
<p>Film <a>Twitter</a> loves to make jokes about the problematic elements of '90s romantic comedies, so Netflix gave them an early Christmas present: A new movie in which a woman falls in love with the man who catfished her. Happy discourse!</p>
<p>Yes Day makes a film out of what sounds like a nightmare to most parents: A day when they have to say yes to whatever mad and irrational demands their kids make. Amazingly, this Jennifer Garner movie does not result in a lengthy visit to the ER.</p>
<p>Jake Gyllenhaal joins the Netflix stable of a-listers with The Guilty, his remake about an emergency services call handler on the call of his life. As usual, the critical consensus was that he should not have bothered: The original was better.</p>
<p>In cinemas, Kevin Hart may be a small and screechy but bankable comedian, but Netflix has allowed him to explore his dramatic side. He currently stars alongside Wesley Snipes in True Story, but before that he tackled the topic of Fatherhood.</p>
<h2>6. The Mitchells vs. The Machines</h2>
<p>A story about how internet content is ruining our lives is a little disingenuous coming from Netflix, but there was still plenty for animation fans to love in the surprisingly sweet film about a family on a road trip battling a robot invasion.</p>
<p>In the heated battle to win the Chinese market, animators have been looking more and more to the country's folk tales for ideas. Over the Moon was a big Netflix hit last year, and the streamer followed it up in 2021 with their Wish Dragon.</p>
<a>Army of the Dead </a>for Netflix, his Dave Bautista-starring zombie heist film which was the only 2021 film to star an undead tiger.
<p>The Rock and <a>Ryan Reynolds</a> both had pretty good pandemics in terms of box office, with Free Guy and Jungle Cruise both doing OK. So how could their first team up since Hobbes and Shaw lose? Turns out it couldn't.</p>
<p>Red Notice may have had the stars and the press, but per FlixPatrol it was beaten to the top spot by a quite unlikely film – We Could Be Heroes, a 15-years-late sequel to the fairly forgotten kid's film The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl.</p>

<p>In a lengthy Instagram post on Monday, the 40-year-old pop star offered more details about her embattled family life, noting that she was often "screaming inside" while fighting for control over her career.</p>
<p>"From every angle I was being hurt for no reason and my family was hurting me. I went into a state of shock and the way I coped was being [in] fake denial. It was too much to really face," Spears wrote.</p>
<p>She added that she "screamed alone a lot and kept all that pain to myself."</p>
<p>"I chose the fake denial 'everything's totally fine' approach because I didn't want to cause conflict. I was NICE, FAKE, and I was absolutely screaming inside. I wanted to be nice but what they did to my heart was unforgivable!" she said.</p>

<p>The Book of Boba Fett has arrived on Disney+ and continues the story of one of the most admired Star Wars characters.</p>
<p>The new series, which follows the legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett, is a spin-off of sorts of the recent Disney+ series The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>New Zealander Temuera Morrison plays the titular bounty hunter in the new Disney+ series The Book of Boba Fett.</p>
<p>Morrison has a long history with the role of Boba Fett and he most recently appeared in episodes of The Mandalorian. Prior to this, he also played the character's father Jango Fett in other Star Wars properties.</p>
<p>Ming-Na Wen (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) co-stars throughout the series as Fennec Shand. The first episode also features actors Matt Berry, David Pasquesi and Jennifer Beals.</p>
<h2>Temuera Morrison's history with Star Wars</h2>
<p>When the original Star Wars trilogy was re-released in 2004, Morrison provided new voiceovers for the character of Boba Fett, and he's been pretty much synonymous with the role ever since.</p>
<p>Morrison has since played both Jango and Boba Fett in a number of Star Wars video games but only physically played Boba for the first time in the second season of The Mandalorian.</p>
<p>The role of Boba Fett was originally played by Jeremy Bulloch in the original trilogy, and a young version of Boba Fett was played by Daniel Logan in Episode II and in Star Wars: The Clone Wars.</p>
<h2>What else have I seen Temuera Morrison in?</h2>
<p>Morrison, 61, has on screen acting credits dating back to the 1970s but has started to appear in more big budget movies over the last ten years.</p>
<p>The Book of Boba Fett is available to watch on Disney+ now.</p>

<div> News Meghan Markle <a>Prince Harry</a> <a>Royal Family</a></div>
<p>Archie Mountbatten-Windsor stole the show in Meghan Markle and <a>Prince Harry</a>'s 2021 Christmas card—with flaming red hair just like his father's.</p>
<p>The two-year-old looks all grown up in blue jeans and a white shirt as he sits on Harry's lap in the family portrait, taken by the couple's wedding photographer, Alexi Lubomirski,</p>
<p>The image shows baby Lilibet for the first time and was taken over the summer, shortly after she was born on June 4.</p>
<p>U.K. political commentator Dominique Samuels wrote: "I cannot get over Archie's hair.</p>
<p>"Say what you want about these two but this picture is so adorable!"</p>
<p>Writer Meecham Whitson Meriweather joked: "Archie better cherish that hair while he can. They look cute tho."</p>
<p>Laura Payton wrote: "OMG Archie's hair is making my day."</p>
<p>Journalist Laura Hampson wrote: "Our first glimpse of Lilibet! Also Archie's red hair may just be the cutest thing ever."</p>
<p>Meghan and Harry included a message on their card, which read: "This year, 2021, we welcomed our daughter, Lilibet, to the world. Archie made us a 'Mama' and a 'Papa', and Lili made us a family.</p>
<p>"As we look forward to 2022, we have made donations on your behalf to several organizations that honor and protect families—from those being relocated from Afghanistan, to American families in need of paid parental leave."</p>
<p>They added: "Wishing you a happy holiday season and a prosperous New Year, from our family to yours!</p>
<p>"As ever, Harry, Meghan, Archie Lili."</p>
<p>It's not the first time Lubomirski has captured a special moment for the couple, after he took their engagement photo shoot and went on to be the official photographer during their wedding at Windsor Castle in May 2018.</p>
<p>After Lilibet was born, the couple's press secretary said in a statement: "Lili is named after her great-grandmother, Her Majesty The Queen, whose family nickname is Lilibet.</p>
<p>"Her middle name, Diana, was chosen to honor her beloved late grandmother, The Princess of Wales."</p>
