<h1> Coping With the Fear of COVID-19 </h1>
<h2> The news has petrified us about the possibilities. Here's how to cope. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Upsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Most of us cling to our fears, which often causes us to give away our power and makes us feel more vulnerable. All the news surrounding the risks, challenges, and deaths associated with the current coronavirus, COVID-19, has definitely weakened us.</p>
<a>loneliness</a> can lead to the stress response, so try not to isolate yourself. With the most recent orders for "Safety in Place," and lockdown, connecting via email, phone and letter writing is very important to minimize the chance of loneliness.
<a>meditation</a> practice, practicing yoga, and incorporating proper breathing techniques into your daily routine.
<li>Use <a>humor</a>, which is an excellent way to temper fear. It also helps keep things light and not so intense.</li>
<a>gratitude</a>. When you’re feeling fearful, try replacing that emotion with an appreciation for all the good in your life. Even when under lockdown, it's important to be grateful for having a roof over your head and some food in your refrigerator.
<li>Consider <a>hypnosis</a>. This can help eliminate negative thought patterns and beliefs. (It’s more successful for some than for others.)</li>

<h2> Reflective writing can help us manage fear. </h2>

<p>Some ways in which reflective writing can help us heal include the following:</p>
<p>1. It encourages us to pay <a>attention</a> to the now.</p>
<p>2. It helps us be more aware of our feelings.</p>
<p>3. It helps cultivate an understanding of where we are, where we were, and where we’re going.</p>
<p>4. It helps us recognize the importance of living in the moment without judgment.</p>
<p>5. It encourages our awareness of our present emotions—that is, whether we’re scared, happy, uncertain, <a>depressed</a>, and so on.</p>
<p>6. By stepping back from yourself and finding a new perspective, it’s easier to let go of old patterns of thinking and behaving.</p>
<p>Reflective Writing Prompts</p>
<ul><li>Describe the effect of <a>COVID-19</a> on your present life.</li> <li>Write about someone else’s current situation.</li> <li>Write about the first time in your life you were fearful and what it felt like.</li> </ul>
<p>In summary, reflective writing cannot replace <a>therapy</a>, but it partners well with this practice and also helps people connect with others as a way to combat feelings of isolation and <a>loneliness</a>.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, loneliness would be something we have some degree of control over, but the <a>COVID-19</a> pandemic is making us feel as if we have little control over our lives and our feelings of isolation.</p>
<a>psychotherapy</a>, he claimed that seeing a therapist was in no way a substitute for having friends and forming human bonds. “Loneliness, which compels us to bond with others, gives us what we call humanity,” he once said.

<a>gratitude</a>, which means reflecting on the positive things in your life. You never know what challenges will arise, but acknowledging everyday miracles, such as the sunrise and sunset, can be very nurturing.
<p>Here are some other ways to help thwart feelings of loneliness during this uncertain time of isolation:</p>
<li>Schedule regular contact with others, either by phone or video chat. The best gift you can give someone you love is to connect with them in some way.</li>
<li>Keep in touch with supportive friends and loved ones. Think about those who care about you, and reach out to them. This helps strengthen bonds and also makes you feel more connected.</li>
<li>Give yourself permission to experience a range of emotions from sadness to joy.</li>
<li>Make sure to eat and sleep well, which affects your overall well-being. Eating a healthy balance of foods during regular mealtimes is very important.</li>
<li>Spend time in nature, which can make you feel less alone and more connected.</li>
<li>Enjoy life’s simple pleasures, such as cooking, reading, and walking.</li>
<li>Listen to music, and take remote exercise and other types of classes.</li>
<li>Write a letter or poem to loved ones who have impacted your life. This is an excellent way to connect with others, even if you don’t actually send the writings.</li>

<h1> How to Deal With Grief Using Poetry </h1>
<h2> April is National Poetry Month and a good time to start writing poetry. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Understanding Grief </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from grief</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<a>stress</a>. Humans are social creatures, so the idea of isolation—especially for a long period of time—can be daunting, but there are ways to help us navigate this journey. Poetry is one of them.
<a>Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief,</a> author David Kessler claims that we are now experiencing different types of grief because of how the world has recently changed. Not only might we be dealing with the loss of loved ones to
<a>COVID-19</a>, but we’re also facing the loss of connection and the
<a>philosophy</a>, such as the idea of uncertainty and what that means?
<p>Here are some suggestions for writing a poem about grief:</p>
<li>Begin by collecting your thoughts.</li>
<li>Make a list of ideas that pop into your mind.</li>
<li>Use imagery and your senses to paint a picture with words.</li>
<li>Begin the poem with a strong image or feeling to get the reader’s <a>attention</a>,</li>
<li>Write down the main idea of your poem, and try to stick to it.</li>
<li>Decide how you want to organize the poem.</li>
<li>Avoid using clichés.</li>
<li>When revising or editing, try reading your poem out loud.</li>
<p>For inspiration, consider reading these poems:</p>
<li>“When Great Trees Fall” by Maya Angelou</li>
<li>“The Peace of Wild Things” by Wendell Berry</li>
<li>“The <a>Laughing</a> Heart” by Charles Bukowski</li>
<li>“Won’t You Celebrate with Me” by Lucille Clifton</li>
<li>“Perhaps the World Ends Here” by Joy Harjo</li>
<li> “The Layers” by Stanley Kunitz</li>
<li> “Kindness” by Naomi Shihab Nye</li>
<li>“I Worried” by Mary Oliver</li>
<li> “Election Years” by Donald Revell</li>
<li>“Do Not Go Gentle into the Good Night” by Dylan Thomas</li>
<p>As David Kessler says, “Emotions need motion.” Our feelings need to be acknowledged. Feeling and expressing our emotions tends to empower us, so “feel the grief and get going.”</p>

<h1> The Pandemic and Dark Moments </h1>
<h2> Transformation and growth emerges from difficult times. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>"It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.” — Aristotle</p>
<a>spiritual</a> transformation and growth stems from pain, discomfort, and
<a>trauma</a>. Whether it’s coping with our new way of life that's related to COVID-19 or something else, most adults have, at one time or another, experienced a sadness that is deep and tenacious.
<a>depression</a> when you thought that no one understood what you were going through. Maybe you felt an intense sense of despair and disconnection, as well as a monumental sense of hopelessness. Perhaps you even had
<a>suicidal</a> thoughts associated with apocalyptic feelings. The uncertainty associated with COVID-19 can create all these feelings.
<p>If you’re going through a time of darkness as a result of the pandemic, here are some ways to cope:</p>
<li>Self-care. Nurture your mind, body, and spirit through regular exercise, relaxation techniques, <a>meditation</a>, and prayer. It’s also about reminding yourself, “I’ve got this. Everything is temporary.”</li>
<li>Creative <a>visualization</a>. Think of the images that emerge in the darkness. These may be a clue to what you need to examine on a deeper level. </li>
<li>Journaling. This process can help you tap into what’s happening in your <a>subconscious</a> mind. </li>
<li>Connecting with others. When possible, use phone calls, texting, video chats, the internet, or personal letters to stay connected with friends and family.</li>
<li>Wholesome eating. Make a point of eating lots of fruits and vegetables, and avoid animal products.</li>
<p>In summary, when you come out of the darkness, you’ll be stronger and more grounded. Trust the journey. Remind yourself that you’re doing everything right and if you’re not... make a concerted effort to change your frame of mind.</p>

<h2> The Serenity Prayer can help provide solace and optimism during these times. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>by Anastasia Borisova</div> <div>Source: Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>loneliness</a>, loss of income, and
<p>The first step in nurturing a sense of optimism is to surrender to the numerous possibilities that abound. In our quest to do so, the <a>Serenity Prayer </a>below is an ideal daily mantra:</p>
<p>God, grant me the serenity</p>
<p>To accept the things I cannot change,</p>
<p>Courage to change the things I can,</p>
<p>And <a>wisdom</a> to know the difference.</p>
<p>Let’s break down the prayer in segments:</p>
<a>meditation</a> practice, a walk, a cup of tea, yoga poses, reading a good book, or journaling. Maybe this is the time to figure out what nurtures you and to go after it.
<a>No mud, no lotus.” </a>In other words, the challenge is to cultivate our inner selves during these challenging times. If we do so, we will reap the benefits.

<h1> 5 Secrets to Gaining Perspective During Trying Times </h1>
<h2> Words of wisdom can help put our lives into perspective. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pixaby</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>suicide</a> in my childhood home. In those days,
<a>therapy</a> wasn’t as commonplace as it is now, so people either suppressed their emotions or shared them with close friends or loved ones. I was a quiet 10-year-old, and my mother was dealing with her own
<a>grief</a>, so I needed an outlet for my feelings.
<p>Quotations can be powerful ways to comfort us and bring perspective into our lives. Here are some that I’ve always resonated with: </p>
<p>1. Take control of your mind. </p>
<p>“The energy of the mind is the essence of life.” —Aristotle</p>
<a>Instant Calm</a>, Paul Wilson says, “By being able to control your breathing, by harnessing this incredibly powerful life force, you can control the way you feel. You can find calm in moments of
<p>“Great acts are made up of small deeds.” —Lao Tzu</p>
<p>Studies have shown that acts of kindness can be a path to better psychological health and can also strengthen the immune system. Being kind also takes the focus off our own immediate problems.</p>
<a>lonely</a> to donating to, or volunteering at, local food banks. When we’re

<a>self-talk</a> can do wonders in dealing with scary or unknown situations, and negative thoughts can easily activate the brains’

<a>optimism</a>, they are most likely able to regulate their emotions. Some studies have shows that resilience might be inherited, but it’s not all nature—early
<a>childhood</a> experiences and environments play a role in how resilient we become. Many of those who have had severe childhood
