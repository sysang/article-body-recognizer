<p>So what’s the bottom line? <a>What prevents a child from developing impostor feelings?</a> Dr. Clance believes, “Overall it’s the feeling the child gets that I’m loved and cared for that makes the difference.”</p>

<a>impostor syndrome</a>." It describes a pattern of doubting your own successes and harboring the chronic
<a>fear</a> of being found out to be a total fraud because you think you're not as competent as you seem.

<a>optimistic</a> about the future.
<p>It’s not always easy to pin down what causes IP or the <a>perfectionistic</a> tendencies it can inspire. Sufferers have difficulty internalizing their own accomplishments—but why? </p>
<a>Discrimination</a> against such groups makes some people feel as though they are separate from those around them, and that those others may even harbor negative, stereotypical beliefs about their competence.

<h1> Why So Many Celebrities Cheat on Their Partners </h1>
<h2> Lessons on how to handle temptation. </h2>
<li>Celebrities are generally highly desirable and therefore have many options for potential partners.</li>
<li>Thinking there are other high quality partners you could be with undermines commitment and increases the chances of infidelity.</li>
<li>Those in higher quality relationships with more commitment and satisfaction find flaws in potential new partners to make them less tempting.</li>

<h1> 10 Underappreciated Sources of Relationship Strength </h1>
<h2> Key pillars of relationship strength that you shouldn't take for granted. </h2>
<li>Research explains why people are likely to focus on what's wrong in their relationships, even minor issues, while ignoring what's going well.</li>
<li>Research suggests that partners may even manufacture problems when none exist.</li>
<li>Most healthy relationships rely on sources of strength liked similarities, friendship, feelings of comfort, and feeling able to be yourself.</li>

<p>Your performance evaluation at work comes in, and it’s glowing. However, there’s one area that “needs improvement.” Days later, which part do you think about? </p>
<p>The negative, of course. Part of you knows it’s ridiculous to let that one thing bother you. After all, there’s a lot more good in there than bad, but you can’t seem to help it. </p>
<a>study published in Science</a> suggests that if our relationship doesn’t have any major issues, we’re more likely to take what once would have been considered a small issue and feel it’s more problematic.
<h4>The Pillars of Healthy Relationships</h4>
<p>To shift your perspective, start by paying more attention to the facets of your relationship that are stable, consistent, and comfortable. Those peaceful, drama-free, status-quo elements are easy to forget, but they’re sources of strength. </p>
<p>Following are 10 pillars of healthy relationships that research suggests are key to a satisfying, lasting bond. Many of these are likely present in your own relationship; you just need to pause and take notice. </p>

<a>research shows that partners who accept each other tend to be more satisfied with their relationships</a>.

<a>friendship</a> emphasize emotional support, intimacy, affection, and maintaining a strong bond. They also focus on meeting needs related to
<a>caregiving</a>, security, and companionship.
<a>which provides a sense of stability</a>.
<a>Research suggests that couples who are interconnected like this tend to be more satisfied and committed</a>.

<a>reliable, warm, kind, fair, trustworthy, and intelligent</a>. Though these traits aren’t flashy and may not immediately come to mind when creating your relationship wish list, they provide the foundation for a
<a>resilient</a> connection. Research suggests that when partners have agreeable and emotionally stable personalities, they tend to be
<a>more satisfied in their relationship</a>.
<a>Research suggests that this is a positive cycle</a>: Trust encourages greater commitment, which encourages greater trust.

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Dunning-Kruger Effect</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which people wrongly overestimate their knowledge or ability in a specific area. This tends to occur because a lack of self-awareness prevents them from accurately assessing their own skills.</p>
<h2> Understanding the Dunning-Kruger Effect </h2>
<a>1999 paper</a> by Cornell University psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger. The pair tested participants on their logic, grammar, and
<a>sense of humor</a>, and found that those who performed in the bottom quartile rated their skills far above average. For example, those in the 12th percentile self-rated their expertise to be, on average, in the 62nd percentile.
<div> <h3> What causes the Dunning-Kruger effect? </h3> </div>
<a>Confidence</a> is so highly prized that many people would rather pretend to be smart or skilled than risk looking inadequate and losing face.
<a> Even smart people</a> can be affected by the Dunning-Kruger effect because having
<a>intelligence</a> isn’t the same thing as learning and developing a specific skill. Many individuals mistakenly believe that their experience and skills in one particular area are transferable to another.
<div> <h3> Why do people fail to recognize their own incompetence? </h3> </div>
<a> examine oneself objectively</a>. In fact, those who are the least skilled are also the most likely to overestimate their abilities.
<div> <h3> What is the double curse of the Dunning-Kruger effect? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>The Dunning-Kruger effect results in what’s known as a "double curse:" Not only do people perform poorly, but they are not self-aware enough to judge themselves accurately—and are thus unlikely to learn and grow.</p> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the opposite of the Dunning-Kruger effect? </h3> </div>
<a> its polar opposite is imposter syndrome</a> or the feeling that one is undeserving of success. People who have
<a>imposter syndrome</a> are plagued by self-doubts and constantly feel like frauds who will be unmasked any second.
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Who Is Impacted by the Dunning-Kruger Effect </h2>
<a>emotional intelligence</a>, financial knowledge, and firearm safety. And the effect isn't spotted only among incompetent individuals; most people have weak points where the
<a>bias</a> can take hold. It also applies to people with a seemingly solid knowledge base: Individuals rating as high as the 80th percentile for a skill have still been found to overestimate their ability to some degree.
<div> <h3> Why do people think they know more than they do? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do people overestimate their competence? </h3> </div>
<a>athlete</a> pushing themselves to the point of injury.
<div> <h3> Why do some people believe they are better than others? </h3> </div>
<h2> How to Avoid the Dunning-Kruger Effect </h2>
<a>proposes,</a> people can be their own devil’s advocates, by challenging themselves to probe how they might possibly be wrong.
<div> <h3> Do I have the Dunning-Kruger effect? </h3> </div>
<a> might not always be right</a>, and you might need to acquire knowledge or practice more.
<div> <h3> How do you fix the Dunning-Kruger effect? </h3> </div>
<a>Question what you know</a> and pay
<a>attention</a> to those who have different viewpoints. Seek feedback from people you can trust who you know are highly skilled in your area of interest.
<a> Be open to constructive criticism</a> and resist the impulse to become defensive. Don’t pretend to know something you don’t. Make it a priority to continue learning and growing.
<div> <h3> Do smart people underestimate themselves? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Does Googling Perpetuate the Dunning-Kruger Effect? </a> </div> <div> Search engines can cause people to overestimate how much they actually know about something they’ve just Googled, a new study reports. </div> </div>

<a>stress</a>, but it may also have powerful negative consequences for
<a>romantic relationships</a>, such as increased conflict and reduced relationship quality. However, one quality displayed by your partner could help to prevent damage to your relationship from the stressors associated with the virus.
<a>bisexual</a>, and gay and lesbian respondents were included in the analysis. The survey assessed feelings of
<a>loneliness</a>, financial stressors, as well as perceived relationship satisfaction, commitment, and conflict. (Note: For now, the results have been published online as a pre-print; they have not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.)

<h1> How Vacations Can Help or Harm Your Relationship </h1>
<h2> Research-backed tips for how to make the most of a couple's vacation. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: geralt via pixaby | CC0 License</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>So what are the potential pros and cons of traveling with your significant other, and how can you make the most out of those two weeks' vacation?</p>
<p>1. Novel and exciting activities increase passion.</p>
<p>Relationships enable us to expand ourselves – to increase our skills, our perspectives, and our sense of who we are. And we are more satisfied with our relationships when they help us do this.</p>
<p>When relationships are new, they are best able to help us expand ourselves.<sup>1</sup> But self-expansion can happen at any point in a relationship if we engage in self-expanding activities with our partners.</p>
<p>Travel provides many opportunities for excitement and adventure, such as visiting new cities, going water-skiing, or trying out a cuisine you've never eaten before.</p>
<p>2. Travel creates memories.</p>
<sup>2</sup> Recalling warm memories with a partner can increase feelings of intimacy, as can looking back on and
<p>3. You may learn something about your partner.</p>
<sup>5</sup> We develop intimacy with others by learning new things about each other.
<p>1. Travel increases opportunities for conflict due to increased interdependence.</p>
<sup>7</sup> But this tension between a desire for independence and a desire to be linked with one's partner creates problems throughout the entire span of our relationships.
<p>2. Spending a lot of time together can magnify existing tensions.</p>
<p>Traveling together usually involves constant contact — spending whole days, even weeks, together with little separation. If there are already problems or tensions in a relationship, extra time together can make them more obvious.</p>
<p>3. Travel may be <a>stressful</a> and exhausting.</p>
<sup>11</sup> This can even create a cycle where poor sleep leads to more negative interactions with partners which fuels more poor sleep the next night, leading to more conflict.
<p>What should you to do ensure that your vacation benefits your relationship and doesn't run into those possible pitfalls?</p>
<p>1. Try something new and exciting.</p>
<p>2. If there are already tensions in your relationship, choose a relaxing vacation that will run fewer risks of conflict – but make sure to intersperse some novel, exciting activities.</p>
<p>3. Make sure that both partners get a say in what they want to do and you're not dragging the other person along.</p>
<p>4. Don't exhaust yourselves.</p>
<p>5. Plan some quiet time or independent activities if you're getting frustrated.</p>
<p>6. Plan and reminisce together to create shared anticipation beforehand and shared memories after.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no one-size-fits-all recipe for a vacation that will improve your relationship. But if you keep these pros and cons in mind, it can help you cope with the ups and downs and make the most of your trip. </p>
