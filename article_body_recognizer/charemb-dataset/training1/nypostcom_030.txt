<p>Especially now with the Omicron variant, it’s time to double down on mask-wearingand possibly quadruple up on protection with a new form of face mask, too. </p>
<a>Stephen Morse</a>, an epidemiology professor at Columbia University,
<a>said to NPR</a>. “KF94 is actually intended for public use. In Korea, they are often worn by ordinary citizens to filter out dust or pollution.”
<p>If you can’t hop on a plane to South Korea, don’t fear, as many Korean-made masks are sold on Amazon for U.S. consumers. See below for a few options that vary in color, quantity and size, available to order now. </p>

<h1> Aerial images show destruction of Tonga’s volcanic eruption, tsunami</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 10:09am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 10:44am </div> </div> </div>
<p>In its first statement since the Hunga Tonga Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted three days ago and triggered 49-foot tsunami waves, the Tongan government said the kingdom of islands had suffered an “unprecedented disaster.”</p>
<p>At least three people have been confirmed dead, including British charity worker Angela Glover, 50, and two Tongans — a 65-year-old woman and 49-year-old man — who lived on separate low-lying islands. </p>
<p>As the damage assessment continued in the wake of the natural disaster, harrowing aerial images taken by a New Zealand military surveillance flight showed several islands entirely blanketed in volcanic ash.</p>
<p>The government said all homes on Mango Island, which is close to the volcano, were completely destroyed. </p>
<p>Only two houses were still standing on Fonoifua Island, while Nomuka Island suffered extensive damage, the government said. </p>
<p>“Water supplies have been seriously affected by the volcanic ash,” the government said in its statement.</p>
<p>The recovery and aid efforts<a> have so far been hampered by falling ash</a> and the fact that Tonga’s single underwater communication cable was severed in the eruption.</p>
<p>Internet was still down on the islands but some local phone lines have since been restored, according to the government. </p>
<p>First contact with some of the outer islands was only made on Monday when the government was able to deploy patrol boats. </p>
<p><a>Active distress signals had been detected</a> near the islands of Fonoi and Mango earlier on Monday. </p>
<p>Evacuations were still underway for some islands on Tuesday, the government said. </p>
<p>New Zealand’s military was sending fresh water and other much-needed supplies, but said Tuesday that the ash covering Tonga’s main runway would delay the flight at least another day.</p>
<p>Australia had also sent a navy ship from Sydney to Brisbane to prepare for a support mission if needed.</p>

<h1> Jen Psaki defends non-release of Biden’s Delaware visitor logs</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 3:13pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 3:21pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Post asked Psaki at her regular press briefing if the White House’s decision not to make the Delaware logs public still stands after Biden spent long stretches of time at his Wilmington and Rehoboth Beach residences.</p>
<p>“Will the White House be reconsidering the decision not to release visitor log information from his Delaware residences?” The Post asked.</p>
<p>Psaki defended the trips before denying the reporter a third question about a different topic.</p>
<p>“Well, the president goes to Delaware because it’s his home. It’s also where his son and his former wife are buried. And it’s a place that is obviously close to his heart,” she said.</p>
<p>Biden spent all or part of 101 days of his first year in office in Delaware. Psaki told The Post in August that there would be no visitor logs released from Biden’s residences in the First State.</p>
<a>fewer interviews</a> and press conferences than his predecessors. He will give just
<a>his second solo White House press conference</a> on Wednesday, the final day of his first year in office.
<p>Tom Fitton, president of conservative legal group Judicial Watch — which has for years battled for White House visitor log transparency — says the White House should release the Delaware visitor logs as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fitton says he’s concerned about who may be seeking to influence public policy while <a>paying Biden or his family a visit</a>.</p>
<p>“[Joe Biden] is the one who had [son] Hunter at the vice president’s office meeting with his business partners,” he noted.</p>
<p>The links between the elder Biden and his son’s business ventures often are murky.</p>
<a>at least $375,000</a> last year for five prints at a Hollywood art show attended by one of his father’s ambassador nominees,
<a>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti</a>.
<a>provided no further details</a>.
<p>That firm, BHR Partners, was registered 12 days after Hunter joined Vice President Biden aboard Air Force Two for a 2013 trip to Beijing.</p>
<p>Trump attorney Pam Bondi argued that Trump should not have been impeached for pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens because the elder Biden may have had his own hand in the deal.</p>
<p>“I have brought every single person you have ever asked me to bring to the F’ing White House and the Vice President’s house and the inauguration,” he griped.</p>

<h1> Rudy Giuliani vows to continue Trump’s election challenge in Pennsylvania</h1>
<div> November 7, 2020 12:56pm <div> Updated <div> November 7, 2020 1:46pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>President Trump’s legal team in Pennsylvania, led by Rudy Giuliani, said that they intend to press on with Trump’s election challenge — even though the state, and the White House, have already been called for Joe Biden.</p>
<p>“He’s not going to concede when at least 600,000 ballots are in question,” Giuliani said Saturday at a Philadelphia press conference shortly after the Keystone State put Biden over the top.</p>
<p>“Courts set aside elections when they’re illegal,” Giuliani claimed. “There certainly is enough evidence to disqualify a certain number of ballots.”</p>
<p>Trump’s campaign has lodged multiple complaints about the vote tallying in Pennsylvania, whose 20 electoral votes made Biden the 46th president of the United States.</p>
<p>Biden had a 0.5 percent lead in the Keystone State — 28,800 votes out of more than 6.5 million cast — with straggling provisional and mail-in ballots still being examined.</p>
<p>At that margin, the race could be headed for a recount, which state law requires in elections that are decided by 0.5 percent of the vote or less.</p>
<p>And a lawsuit filed by the Pennsylvania Republican Party, based on a state court’s ruling on the validity of late mail-in ballots, is likely headed to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>“This is not anecdotal,” claimed Lewandowski. “This is hard evidence and if you do your jobs from the media and you will find additional examples.”</p>
<p>Giuliani was joined at the podium by poll watchers, several of whom provided on record statements accusing Democratic officials in Philadelphia of now allowing them to properly observe ballots.</p>
<div> <div> <h4>Related Video</h4> </div> <div> <div> <h2>Trump campaign insists ‘election is not over’</h2> </div> </div> </div>
<p>“It’s such a shame. This is a democracy,” said GOP poll watcher Daryl Brooks. “They would not allow us to see anything. Was it corrupt or not? Give us an opportunity as poll watchers to view all the ballots.”</p>
<p>So far Team Trump has produced scant evidence to back up their claims of widespread systemic fraud. Biden also leads Trump in the popular vote by more than 4 million votes.</p>
<p>“I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!,” <a>Trump tweeted</a> Saturday</p>

<h1> McCarthy slams Capitol riot committee info request as ‘pure politics’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 13, 2022 4:23pm <div> Updated <div> January 13, 2022 4:23pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy defended his decision Thursday to decline a request for information from the select committee investigating last year’s Capitol riot. </p>
<p>“There is nothing that I can provide the Jan. 6 committee for legislation .. moving forward,” McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters. “There is nothing in that realm. It is pure politics, what they’re playing.”</p>
<p>McCarthy’s remarks came one day after the panel invited him to discuss a phone conversation with former President Donald Trump during the riot, during which McCarthy reportedly urged the 45th president to quell the violence.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday night, McCarthy decried the select committee as an “illegitimate” body whose “only objective is to attempt to damage its political opponents.”</p>
<p>During his weekly press availability Thursday, McCarthy bristled when CNN reporter Manu Raju asked him: “Why should the public not conclude that you’re trying to hide something here and hide the facts from getting out?”</p>
<p>“Never did I think a Speaker would play such politics and then appoint a chairman who starts the committee by saying, ‘The only person out of bounds is the Speaker,'” McCarthy raged. </p>
<p>The Republican leader also sought to deflect attention to the security failures that allowed the pro-Trump mob to breach the building and interrupt the certification of the 2020 election results. </p>
<p>“Why was the Capitol so ill-prepared that day?” he asked. “And how do we make sure it will never be ill-prepared again?”</p>
<p>However, multiple GOP lawmakers who were on the call have confirmed McCarthy’s reported statements to The Post.</p>
<p>McCarthy also would not say whether he would comply with a subpoena from the committee. </p>
<a>Scott Perry of Pennsylvania</a>.
<p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) stopped short of supporting a subpoena of McCarthy on Thursday, telling reporters the decision should be left to the committee.</p>
<h1> Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio released from jail early after torching BLM banner</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 4:42pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 4:42pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Enrique Tarrio, the leader of the far-right Proud Boys group, was released Friday after serving just over four months in jail for burning a Black Lives Matter banner stolen from a historic black church in Washington late in 2020. </p>
<p>The 37-year-old was also carrying a white plastic bag that appeared to contain his belongings. </p>
<p>After greeting his family, Tarrio told reporters he was feeling “great” about his release, but noted that he was still worried for several Capitol riot defendants who are being held at the jail.</p>
<p>Last August, Tarrio was sentenced to more than five months in jail after pleading guilty in July to torching the BLM banner. It was not immediately clear why Tarrio was released before the end of his sentence. </p>
<p>Not long after, the Proud Boys leader admitted his guilt to the Washington Post. </p>
<p>“Let me make this simple. I did it,” he said. </p>
<p>In addition to the property damage, Tarrio was also charged with carrying two high-capacity firearm magazines to Washington ahead of last year’s riot. Authorities found the magazines upon his <a>arrest for burning the banner</a>. </p>
<p>Tarrio walked out of jail just two months after he requested an early release, citing inhumane living conditions, <a>according to The Hill.</a></p>
<p>The request was denied at the time, with DC Superior Court Judge Jonathan Pittman saying Tarrio failed to present “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to be released early. </p>
<p>It is unclear what role Tarrio holds in the Proud Boys upon his release.</p>
<p>Shortly before Tarrio started his jail term in September, <a>he posed for pictures</a> pretending to hold a flame to the US Capitol building. </p>
<p>In his final hours of freedom, he posted the photos to Telegram and urged his supporters to “keep protesting.” </p>
<p>“While it may be me today who is bearing the brunt of an over-politicized Biden Justice Department that caters to the Marxist mob, tomorrow it will be everyday Americans who they will set their sights on,” he said.</p>
<h1> Biden keeps twisting facts about American history to serve his agenda</h1>

<p>“Certain dates echo throughout history,” <a>she proclaimed</a>. “Dates that occupy not only a place on our calendars but a place in our collective memory: December 7, 1941, September 11, 2001, and January 6, 2021.” </p>
<p>And from his speech, Biden clearly hoped there would emerge momentum for <a>Democrats’ pending voting legislation </a>— the apparent, underlying, political purpose of the whole Biden-Harris January 6 remembrance.</p>
<a> died of natural causes</a>, though the examiner did state that the events of Jan. 6 “played a role in his condition.”
<a>Officer Evans was killed</a> months later, in April 2021, in a completely unrelated attack. The only individual killed at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, was an
<a>unarmed woman named Ashli Babbitt</a>, who was shot by a Capitol police officer.
<a>Directing his historical commentary </a>to “every elected official in America,” he declared that those who do not vote his way are siding with racism and the Confederacy.

<h1> Nick Saban co-signs letter to Manchin backing election bill — but not killing filibuster</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 3:50pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:03pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“We strongly support urgently needed legislation that will protect both the rights of voters and the integrity of outcomes in all Federal elections,” the letter reads.</p>
<p>“[D]emocracy is best when voting is open to everyone on a level playing field; the referees are neutral; and at the end of the game the final score is respected and accepted,” the missive added.</p>
<p>“The others signing this letter take no position on this aspect of Senate policies,” the footnote concluded. </p>
<p>The letter comes as Senate Democrats <a>force a debate</a> over two sweeping federal election bills ahead of a vote on whether to change the chamber’s rules and allow the bills to be passed by a simple majority.</p>
<a>Krysten Sinema</a> (D-Ariz.) have repeatedly voiced opposition to such a move, pointing out that it could lead to further national division. With the Senate split 50-50, any rule change vote is destined to fail without their support.
<p>Saban, who was born and raised in West Virginia, <a>appeared in a political ad</a> for Manchin during the senator’s 2018 Senate re-election campaign.</p>
<p>Two years later, <a>Saban took part in a Black Lives Matter march</a> that included hundreds of the University of Alabama’s athletes, coaches and staff. </p>
<p>However, he took a step back from politics that same year, <a>saying he would not endorse any candidate</a> in the 2020 presidential election. </p>
<p>“We’ve have — had several voter registration education programs here recently,” Saban said during a news conference.</p>

<h1> Warnock slams Sinema, Manchin for failing their ‘1965 moment’ with filibuster stance</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 4:59pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 4:59pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Sen. Raphael Warnock on Monday slammed fellow Democrats who have vowed to vote against altering or eliminating this filibuster this week in order to pass two pieces of voting rights legislation.</p>
<p>“Is there any convincing these holdouts? What are these people protecting?” Behar said, asking how Democrats can ensure the passage of the voting rights bills. </p>
<p>While Sinema has argued that changing the Senate rules would cause further division among the two parties, Warnock accused similar “arguments around procedure” of being the reason segregation and slavery lasted so long. </p>
<p>Warnock emphasized that the voting rights legislation must pass “no matter what,” adding that “our country is on the brink of peril.” </p>
<p>The Georgia lawmaker’s stern warning comes one week after <a>President Biden delivered a harsh </a>address promoting filibuster reform in a failed effort to convince the disagreeing Democrats. </p>
<p>The speech was met with much criticism from Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who equated the “unpresidential” address to a “rant.” </p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer originally planned to hold a vote on the rules change by Jan. 17, but <a>pushed it back after Sinema’s speech</a>.</p>
<h1> Schumer to push doomed filibuster vote after debate Tuesday on voting reforms</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 5:49pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 5:49pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Senate Democrats plan to make a point about election reform legislation this week — even if it is a moot one.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of support, Schumer has vowed to bring the rules change up for a vote. The specifics of the rules changes have not yet been released. </p>
<p>Schumer had initially aimed to hold the vote by Jan. 17, but Sen. Brian Schatz’s (D-Hawaii) COVID-19 diagnosis last week delayed his plans. </p>
<p>Voting rights has become a central priority for the administration after Democrats pivoted to the issues after a sweeping social spending bill hit a wall in December, with Manchin voicing objections to key provisions. </p>
<p>Republicans have countered that stricter laws have not disenfranchised voters, arguing they are necessary moves to protect against voter fraud. </p>
<p>The John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act aims to undo court rulings that weakened the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by requiring certain states to receive federal preclearance before enacting redistricting plans or new voting laws. </p>
<h1> Sanders calls out Manchin, Sinema ahead of Senate election bill debate</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 10:18am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 10:51am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Debate over the Freedom to Vote Act and John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act is set to begin around noon Tuesday and will be followed by a Senate Democratic Caucus meeting at 5 p.m.,<a> according to The Hill</a>.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is expected to call for a vote to end debate on the legislation sometime Wednesday. The so-called cloture motion requires 60 votes to succeed and will be defeated by united Republican opposition. </p>
<a>Sinema announced</a> last week that they would not support that move, infuriating several of their colleagues.
<p>On Monday, <a>Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) compared</a> Manchin and Sinema’s support of the filibuster to “arguments around procedure,” which he claimed allowed segregation to last for decades after the Civil War. </p>
<p>Senate Democratic leadership and President Biden have pushed for the party to alter or eliminate the filibuster in order to pass the election reform measure, and Schumer announced last week that he would force a vote on weakening the 60-vote rule. </p>

<p>One of the options being discussed is a return to the so-called “talking filibuster,” which would require Republican opponents of the bills to physically hold the floor to prevent the Senate from taking a vote.</p>
<a>with the Richmond Times-Dispatch</a>.
<p>Wallner was referring to Senate Rule XIX, which stipulates that “no senator shall speak more than twice upon any one question in debate on the same legislative day without leave of the Senate.”</p>
<p>However, a Senate Democratic aide noted to The Hill that the two-speech rule is rarely enforced and Republicans can circumvent the process by introducing a series of debatable motions that would allow each senator to speak two more times. </p>
<p>“Right now, there are two Democrats who don’t want to make that happen,” Schumer added. “But the fight is not over, far from it.” </p>
<p>In statements last week, <a>Manchin</a> (D-WV) and <a>Sinema</a> (D-Ariz.) argued that passing significant legislation along party lines and by narrow margins will only worsen already deep political divisions in the US. </p>

<h1> Senate votes down Ukraine-supported Cruz bill slapping sanctions on Russia</h1>
<div> January 13, 2022 6:30pm <div> Updated <div> January 13, 2022 10:37pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Senate rejected a Republican bill Thursday that would have imposed new sanctions on the Russian-owned company behind the construction of a controversial natural gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The bill, which was introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last year, received 55 votes, but failed to reach the necessary 60 “ayes” required to pass. The vote was held open for nearly seven hours.</p>
<p>Six Democratic senators – Mark Kelly of Arizona, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, and Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Mastro of Nevada – voted to support the legislation.</p>
<p>Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) and Ben Ray Lujan (D-NM) switched their votes from “aye” to “no” while the roll call was in progress. </p>
<p>Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) was the only Republican to vote “no.” Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) was not present to vote due to a recent COVID-19 diagnosis.</p>
<p>“Only immediately imposing sanctions can change Putin’s calculation, stop a Ukrainian invasion, and lift the existential threat posed by Nord Stream 2,” Cruz added. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, roughly 100,000 Russian forces have amassed at the border with Ukraine, leading many to fear an invasion.</p>
<p>While President Biden has vowed to impose “severe” economic sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin if Moscow goes ahead with military action, the White House and Senate Democrats have repeatedly criticized Cruz’s bill.</p>
<p>“Senator Cruz wants to stop the pipeline. So do I,” Menendez added. “But it is far from clear that sanctions at this point, when the pipeline is already built, will do just that.”</p>
<p>The White House supports Menendez’s bill, according to a spokesperson for the National Security Council who said it would “trigger severe costs to Russia’s economy” if Moscow chooses to attack.</p>
<h1> US warns of Russia plotting ‘false flag’ operation to provoke Ukraine invasion</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 1:16pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 1:16pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The US has intelligence suggesting Russian operatives have been deployed to conduct a “false flag” attack in eastern Ukraine that will act as a signal for Moscow to invade its western neighbor, the White House said Friday. </p>
<p>The Kremlin has kept thousands of troops in the area of the border between Russia and Ukraine for months in what the US and its western allies fear is a prelude to an invasion and annexation of additional territory. </p>
<p>On Thursday, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told White House reporters that Russia was “laying the groundwork” for a possible invasion using the same “playbook” as for the 2014 annexation of Crimea. </p>
<p>Late Thursday, a <a>massive cyber attack</a> hit Ukrainian government websites, displaying a message warning users to “be afraid and expect the worst,” Reuters reported. </p>
<p>The attack hit Ukraine’s foreign ministry, the cabinet of ministers and the security and defense council, according to the report. </p>
<p>The hack attacks bore a resemblance to other cyber-incursions by Russia-backed actors, but Psaki said Friday that she was “not going to speculate” about who was responsible.</p>
<p>“We will take necessary and proper steps, of course, to defend our allies, support our partners and support the Ukrainian people,” she said. “But we’re still assessing that at this point.”</p>
<p>However, Washington has said it’s willing to negotiate with Moscow about possible future deployments of offensive missiles in Ukraine and putting limits on US and NATO military exercises in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov warned Friday that Moscow wouldn’t wait indefinitely for the Western response, saying he expects a written answer next week.</p>
<p>“We have run out of patience,” Lavrov said at a news conference. “The West has been driven by hubris and has exacerbated tensions in violation of its obligations and common sense.”</p>

<div> November 15, 2021 7:27pm <div> Updated <div> November 15, 2021 7:33pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko has weaponized migration and stands poised to do the same with energy. Will Europe’s leaders finally get serious about slapping him down?</p>
<p>Thousands of migrants, largely from the Middle East, are stranded in dire and freezing conditions on Belarus’ border with Poland, which won’t let them in, even if they intend to spread to the rest of the European Union. </p>
<p>And Belarus won’t take them, either — though it encouraged them to come. In recent months, it loosened its visa requirements and increased flights by state-owned airline Belavia from the Middle East.</p>
<p>More, The New York Times reports that Belarusian security forces are helping migrants move from the capital to the frontiers of Poland, Latvia and Lithuania — even handing out wire cutters and axes to cut through border fences.</p>
<p>Why? Lukashenko seems to be trying to create a refugee crisis so that the EU will reward him for ending it: He wants the end of sanctions imposed over the fraudulent election that gave him a sixth term.</p>
<a>before </a>that Lukashenko’s antics will only get worse unless and until he’s made to pay a bitter price for his thuggish violations of international norms. Clearly, Western leaders haven’t yet sent a loud enough message.

<a>Ukraine and Belarus’ border.</a> Washington issued private and then public warnings to Moscow and reassurances to Kiev that it will work with European partners to impose punishing sanctions if the Kremlin substantially

<a>Antony Blinken met with</a> Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.
<a>Germany on Nord Stream 2</a> since January — when construction on the project, stalled by 2019 and 2020 congressional sanctions, resumed.
<p>Since that statement was issued, Moscow began to do the inevitable: use gas as a political weapon.</p>

<h1> US looks to step up Iran sanctions compliance as nuclear talks drag</h1>
<div> December 9, 2021 5:04pm <div> Updated <div> December 9, 2021 5:04pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Biden administration is sending a high-level delegation to the United Arab Emirates next week in a bid to tighten compliance with sanctions against Iran as talks about the US re-entering the 2015 nuclear deal stall.</p>
<p>The White House confirmed Thursday that the head of the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control will lead the delegation to meet with UAE government officials as well as private firms and banks doing business with Tehran.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Thursday that the effort was “part of our extended outreach to our partners around the world to ensure that we are preparing for a range of contingencies.”</p>
<p>The Journal added that the Treasury visit could be followed by sanctions against UAE individuals or firms. </p>
<p>“We continue to believe that a mutual return to compliance with the JCPOA is possible,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said Wednesday, referring to the 2015 agreement by its official acronym.</p>
<p>Price added: “We certainly hope that Iran returns to Vienna recognizing the — recognizing what a mutual return to compliance would bring, would convey for the Iranian people as well.”</p>
<p>The negotiations, which started back up Thursday, were halted last week after the US and European officials accused Iran of walking back on compromises initially floated in the spring. </p>
<p>As the negotiations continue, some observers have estimated that Iran is “very close” to producing enough enriched <a>uranium to create a nuclear weapon</a>.</p>
<p><a>Late last month</a>, Gen. Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie, head of US Central Command, warned that Iran likes “the idea of being able to breakout.” </p>
<a>McKenzie told Time magazine</a>. “The diplomats are in the lead on this, but Central Command always has a variety of plans that we could execute, if directed.”
<p>If there is no progress in the nuclear talks, the US delegation to the UAE could be the first of many outreaches to several countries in order ratchet up economic pressure on Iran, the US officials told the Journal. </p>
<h1> Senate to debate dueling Russia sanctions in case of Ukraine invasion</h1>
<div> January 12, 2022 1:03pm <div> Updated <div> January 12, 2022 1:34pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Senate Democrats have unveiled a new set of White House-backed sanctions against Russia to be implemented if Moscow decides to invade Ukraine.</p>
<p>The bill, which comes on the heels of a similar proposal drafted by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last month, is sponsored by Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Robert Menendez (D-NJ).</p>
<p>The sanctions would target Russia over Nord Stream 2, a completed but not yet operational natural gas pipeline that connects Russia and Germany under the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The legislation would also impose sanctions on top Russian military and government leaders, including President Vladimir Putin, as well as financial institutions. Companies that provide secure messaging systems would also be hit. </p>
<a>Menendez said in a statement</a>, adding that the “most effective sanction on Russia is a strong and unified Ukraine.”
<p>The White House supports Menendez’s bill, according to a spokesperson for the National Security Council, who said it would “trigger severe costs to Russia’s economy” if Moscow chooses to invade.</p>
<p>The main difference between the Menendez legislation and the bill proposed by Cruz is the speed with which its provisions take effect. </p>
<p>Democrats who oppose the Cruz proposal have called for a more strategic response to potential Russian aggression. </p>
<a>Politico</a> Monday, adding that the White House “has to do a better job of messaging what the flaws are” in Cruz’s bill.
<p>The aide added that the Democratic bill does include mandatory sanctions on the pipeline, “so the ground is ripe for cooperation.” Any legislation must receive 60 votes to pass, a steep climb in the 50-50 Senate.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, more than 100,000 Russian troops have gathered at the border with Ukraine. </p>
<p>Russia has pressed the US and NATO to not allow Ukraine to become a member of the Atlantic alliance, citing national security concerns. The country has also warned the US and NATO against deploying forces or military systems in Ukraine. </p>
<p>While the US and its allies have declined to promise such a move, talks are taking place this week between Russia, the US and other European allies to discuss the concerns. </p>
<p>Many fear that Moscow’s growing troop presence along the border indicates an invasion similar to Russia’s annexation of Crimea eight years ago. </p>
<p>If Russia does invade, <a>President Biden has promised severe</a> economic sanctions in response.</p>
<p>“I made it clear to President Putin that we will have severe sanctions, we will increase our presence in Europe, with NATO allies,” Biden told reporters following a call with Putin Dec. 30. </p>
<p>While he declined to provide further details, the president noted that “we made it clear he cannot, I’ll emphasize, cannot, invade Ukraine.”</p>
<p>Talks <a>between Russia and the US hit a stalemate</a> after security discussions began Monday, with Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman calling some of Moscow’s demands “non-starters.”</p>
<p>“We will not allow anyone to slam closed NATO’s open door policy, which has always been central to the NATO alliance,” Sherman said following nearly six hours of talks. </p>
<p>Russia has continuously denied that it is planning to invade Ukraine, with Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov saying this week: “There is no reason to fear some kind of escalatory scenario.” </p>

<p>The brother of the man who took hostages at a Texas synagogue is stunned his sibling was allowed to fly from England to the United States — because he was known to counterterrorism officials in Britain.</p>
<p>“He’s known to police. Got a criminal record. How was he allowed to get a visa and acquire a gun?” Malik Faisal Akram’s brother Gulbar Akram told Sky News on Monday.</p>
<p>The brother later told The New York Times that Akram, 44, was known to anti-terror cops in the UK but it wasn’t immediately clear why, and the detail couldn’t be independently confirmed.</p>
<p>Law-enforcement sources told The Post Akram was not named on any “no-fly lists” and The Guardian reported he had no known terrorism convictions.</p>
<p>He listed a hotel on Queens Boulevard as his destination on his travel documents, but only stayed in the Big Apple for two days before boarding another flight to Texas on Dec. 31, a law-enforcement source said.</p>
<p>Law-enforcement sources in New York said Akram couldn’t have purchased the gun in the Big Apple because he boarded a flight two days later to Texas and said it’s more likely he procured the weapon after he arrived in the Dallas area.</p>
<p>“Nobody has any idea where he got the gun and our number one substantive witness is dead, but it seems more likely that he got it in Texas,” a police official explained.</p>
<p>Gulbar Akram told the Times his brother was deeply troubled, had grown apart from his relatives in recent years and had long struggled with mental-health issues.</p>
<p>“It’s well known, everybody in the town knows, he has mental health issues,” he said.</p>
<p>“How had he gotten into America?” he questioned.</p>
<p>“Why was he granted a visa? How did he land at JFK Airport and not get stopped for one second?”</p>
<p>Akram said his brother’s mental-health issues worsened when another sibling died from COVID-19 about three months ago, but the terrorist had long struggled with behavioral issues. </p>
<p>It emerged Monday that a UK courthouse gave Akram a rare “Exclusion Order” that banned him from entering the facility because he berated staff on the day after the Sept. 11 attacks, The Telegraph reported.</p>

<h1> ‘Prayers answered’ after synagogue hostages rescued, suspect dead in Colleyville, Texas</h1>
<div> January 15, 2022 3:22pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 3:22am </div> </div> </div>
<p>The hostage-taker demanded the release of Pakistani neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, who was convicted in Manhattan Federal Court in 2010 of trying to kill US authorities in Afghanistan, and claimed to be her brother.</p>
<p>He also phoned a New York City rabbi in a bizarre bid for help, according to sources – but was “singularly focused on one issue and it was not specifically related to the Jewish community,” according to DeSarno.</p>
<p>Police were in “constant communication” with the suspect, Colleyville Police Chief Micheal Miller said, and were encouraged when he released a male hostage from the synagogue in good condition around 5 p.m.</p>
<p>“It’s very likely this situation would have ended very badly early in the day if we did not have professional consistent contact with the subject,” DeSarno said.</p>
<p>The man demanded to speak to Rabbi Angela Buchdahl, and asked her to use her “influence” to help get Siddiqui released before claiming to have a bomb, the source said.</p>
<p>Buchdahl called 911, the source said. It’s unclear what connection, if any, the 49-year-old Buchdahl has to the Siddiqui case. </p>
<p>A rep for Central Synagogue called the situation in Texas “a very sad and scary situation,” but declined to comment on the call. The NYPD said the Texas event “had no nexus to New York City.”</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 3</div> </div> </div>
<p>A rep for Muhammad Siddiqui, the terrorist’s brother, said he has nothing to do with the incident. A lawyer who once represented him confirmed her client was not the person holding hostages in Texas.</p>
<p>“Whoever it is, they’re not the biological brother of Aafia Siddiqui,” Annette Lamoreaux told The Post, noting it’s common practice in Islam to refer to people as one’s “brother” or “sister.” </p>
<p>Aafia Siddiqui also has no connection to the hostage incident, her own attorney insisted to CNN. </p>
<p>“She does not want any violence perpetrated against any human being, especially in her name,” lawyer Marwa Elbially told the network. “It obviously has nothing to do with Dr. Siddiqui or her family.”</p>
<p>The incident began just after 10:30 a.m. Texas time, according to the Colleyville Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>The Texas synagogue siege Saturday highlights the risk to Americans of the Biden administration’s singular obsession with targeting Trump supporters as domestic terrorists.</p>
<p>It is a shame that their great work was immediately overshadowed by the absurd, PC pronouncement of senior FBI officials and President Biden that no one knew the motive of the terrorist, Malik Faisal Akram.</p>
<p>But the attack is a reminder of times in the not-so-distant past, when Islamist terrorism was considered a threat greater than a MAGA supporter, and the national security apparatus was deployed to protect American citizens, not attack them.</p>
<p>Now the Biden administration has flipped it all around to target the Democratic Party’s political opponents, or anyone who displays anti-authority tendencies.</p>
<a>“enemies of the state.”</a> The DOJ’s new domestic terrorism unit, which was revealed last week during a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, targets people who are anti-authority.
<p>In other words, the Jan. 6 Capitol riot is being used as a pretext to weaponize the national security apparatus against conservatives in what investigative journalist Julie Kelly describes as a new “domestic war on terror.”</p>
<p>This dangerously cynical strategy is the <a>premise of Kelly’s powerful new book</a> “January 6: How Democrats Used the Capitol Protest to Launch a War on Terror Against the Political Right.”</p>
<p>She lays out the federal government’s extraordinary repression of American citizens, dozens of whom remain behind bars in DC without trial for Jan. 6 activity, despite not being charged with violent offenses.</p>
<p>In dozens of interviews with Jan. 6 prisoners and their families, she reports the pressure placed on them by judges and court-appointed lawyers to recant their support for Trump.</p>
<p>Their trials are scheduled for later this year, in the heat of the midterm elections.</p>
<p>Kelly has uncovered a “shocking dual system of justice based on political differences and a thirst for power.”</p>
<p>“Nor did the protesters intend or seek to overthrow the US government; to the contrary, Trump supporters later expressed sincere disappointment that the pockets of violence halted attempts to pursue an audit of the election.”</p>
<p>This is how the Democrats plan to win the midterms, by demonizing and intimidating their political opponents with government power while attempting to mess with voting rules.</p>
<p>The polls suggest their plan is falling flat.</p>

<h1> Hero Texas rabbi threw chair at crazed terrorist to end 10-hour hostage ordeal</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 8:11am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 3:53pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The hero rabbi held hostage in his Texas synagogue has credited active-shooter training for helping him save his congregants — revealing Monday that he threw a chair at the terrorist so they could finally escape.</p>
<p>Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker said the training he got from police and the FBI kicked in toward the end of the terrifying 10-hour standoff Saturday at his Congregation Beth Israel in Colleyville.</p>
<a>British terrorist Malik Faisal Akram</a>, who “wasn’t getting what he wanted.”
<p>“It didn’t look good. It didn’t sound good. We were terrified,” <a>he told “CBS Mornings” Monday</a>.</p>
<p>He said he remembered the security training warning that “when your life is threatened, you need to do whatever you can to get to safety.”</p>
<p>That came when Akram “wasn’t in a good position” and Cytron-Walker and the two congregants with him were close to an exit, he told CBS, saying he made sure they “were ready to go.”</p>
<p>“I told them to go,” he said. “I threw a chair at the gunman, and I headed for the door. And all three of us were able to get out without even a shot being fired,” he told CBS of the “terrifying” ordeal.</p>
<p>Instead, Cohen said, he reared up in his chair, slowly moving his head and mouthing “no” — with the group fleeing as Akram moved to return to his own chair.</p>
<p>“We escaped. We weren’t released or freed,” Cohen wrote.</p>
<p>Akram, 44, was shot and killed after the hostages ran out. Authorities have declined to say who shot Akram, saying it was still under investigation.</p>
<p>Although Cytron-Walker and his congregants had been “threatened the entire time,” the rabbi said that “fortunately, none of us were physically injured.”</p>
<p>He was convinced that the “multiple security courses” his synagogue had held with police, the FBI and other groups were crucial to their survival.</p>
<p>“We are alive today because of that education,” he insisted in a statement.</p>
<p>“Without the instruction we received, we would not have been prepared to act and flee when the situation presented itself,” he insisted. </p>
<p>“We are grateful for the outcome,” he said, encouraging “all Jewish congregations, religious groups, schools, and others to participate in active-shooter and security courses.”</p>
<p>The caring rabbi revealed how he initially welcomed Akram into his synagogue because he assumed he needed shelter, and he “didn’t hear anything suspicious” as they chatted while he made him tea.</p>
<p>“It was during prayer, while we were praying and my back was turned … I heard a click,” he recalled. “And it turned out that it was his gun.”</p>
<p>Thanking people for “all the love, prayers and support,” he readily acknowledged that “there is no question that this was a traumatic experience.”</p>
<p>Still, he insisted, “We are resilient and we will recover.”</p>
<p>The FBI on Sunday night issued a statement calling the ordeal “a terrorism-related matter, in which the Jewish community was targeted” and said the Joint Terrorism Task Force is investigating. </p>
<a>Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist </a>suspected of having ties to al Qaeda who was convicted of trying to kill US Army officers in Afghanistan. Dubbed “Lady al Qaeda,” she is serving an 86-year sentence.
<p>The Colleyville synagogue is in suburban Fort Worth, where Siddiqui is serving her sentence.</p>
<p>The synagogue’s president, Michael Finfer, tried to reassure the Jewish community that the attack “was a random act of violence.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, there was a one-in-a-million chance that the gunman picked our congregation,” he said.</p>
<p>The statements came as British police confirmed that<a> two teenagers had been detained </a>by anti-terrorism officers in Manchester.</p>
<p>“They remain in custody for questioning,” Greater <a>Manchester Police said </a>late Sunday.</p>
<p>UK Home Secretary Priti Patel told the House of Commons on Monday that she had spoken to her US counterpart, Alejandro Mayorkas, and offered “the full support” of the British police and security services.</p>
