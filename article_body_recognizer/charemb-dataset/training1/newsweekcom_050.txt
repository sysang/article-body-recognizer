<p>China's former ambassador to the United States said Washington's policy toward Beijing is influenced by racism and that Americans would never embrace a superpower from a different culture.</p>
<p>Cui Tiankai, 69, was the longest-serving Chinese envoy in the U.S. capital, holding the crucial post from April 2013 to June 2021. He was China's ambassador to <a>Japan</a> before that.</p>
<p>"China-U.S. relations are at a historic stage that will last for quite some time," said Cui. "The United States will not willingly accept the rise of a great power with a very different social system, ideology, cultural traditions and even race."</p>
<p>"We must be clear-headed about this and fully prepare to deal with twists and turns and even roller-coaster scenarios in China-U.S. relations in the future," Cui said.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a>. He also witnessed the hardening of American views toward China at the start of the U.S.-China trade war and later the COVID pandemic.
<p>In addition to his pessimistic forecast, he appeared to urge caution and warned against overreach at a time of heightened military tensions and unpredictable supply chain restructuring.</p>
<a>Communist Party</a> leader Mao Zedong, he continued: "In principle, we should fight no battle unprepared and fight no battle we are not sure of winning; fight no war of anger or war of attrition."
<p>"Every bit of the people's interest is hard-won. We must not allow it to be plundered by anyone or lose it through our own carelessness, negligence and incompetence," Cui said.</p>

<a>Taiwan</a>'s air defense buffer zone this year and continues to conduct air and naval exercises targeting the island as well as other foreign military forces in the region, the Taiwanese Defense Ministry said in its year-end report.
<a>People's Liberation Army</a> (PLA) was approaching the capability to impose a full blockade of Taiwan, a scenario that would pose "a serious challenge and threat" to Taiwan's defenses.
<a>Communist Party</a>'s overt "military threats and provocations" are continuing at an unprecedented level, he told the Taiwanese legislature's Foreign and National Defense Committee.
<a>South Korea</a> all operate their own ADIZs.
<p>Taiwan began publishing details about the near-daily ADIZ intrusions in September 2020. The frequent operations, mostly off to the southwest, take place in the international airspace about 100 to 150 miles from Taipei.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said Taiwan's air force had scrambled interceptors against two PLA fighters and a pair of support aircraft. The latest flights brought the number of sorties to 950 as of December 22.</p>
<p>Taiwan considers the frequent military maneuvers a form of "gray-zone" warfare, an activity, short of war, that can exhaust the island's vastly outnumbered pilots and limited resources while also causing psychological strain on its public.</p>

<p>Health officials in northwestern China have ordered 13 million residents into another full lockdown amid a surge in the Delta variant of <a>COVID</a>.</p>
<p>A notice by the Xi'an city government said the stay-at-home order would come into effect at midnight local time on Thursday. The mandatory quarantine period is indefinite, with an end date to be announced at a later time, according to the statement.</p>
<p>Shaanxi's seven-day average has more than doubled over the past week, with 149 residents having been infected as part of the Delta cluster first discovered on December 9. Some 143 of the 149 cases were in province capital Xi'an, the NHC said.</p>
<p>The lockdown, which is expected to affect around 90 residential neighborhoods, is being accompanied by a citywide nucleic acid test drive. As of Wednesday afternoon, health workers had tested more than 10 million Xi'an residents—twice.</p>
<p>Xi'an was last put under full lockdown in February 2020 amid the first wave of COVID.</p>

<p>The opposition camp criticized the elections, with the largest pro-democracy party, the <a>Democratic Party</a>, fielding no candidates for the first time since the 1997 handover.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Monday there were "multiple reasons" for the decline in voter turnout.</p>

<p>After Harvard professor Charles Lieber was found guilty Tuesday of lying about his involvement with a Chinese government program, a Chinese official said the U.S. should not be quick to judge China's international scientific exchange initiatives.</p>
<p><a>According to CNN</a>, Lieber's Harvard research group, which received more than $15 million in federal funding, required the disclosure of any foreign financial conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>Lieber was found guilty of two counts of filing false tax returns, two counts of making false statements, and two counts of not filing reports for his Chinese bank account.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the U.S. should not "stigmatize" China's scientific exchange programs, adding that the country's programs follow similar guidelines to U.S. programs.</p>
<p>He said that the U.S. should "instead do something conducive to China-U.S. scientific and people-to-people exchanges and cooperation."</p>
<p>Lieber had pleaded not guilty to the charges. Lieber's defense attorney, Marc Mukasey, had argued that prosecutors lacked proof of the charges, maintaining that investigators kept no records of their interviews with Lieber prior to his arrest.</p>
<p>Lieber denied his involvement during inquiries from U.S. authorities, including the National Institutes of Health, which had provided him with millions of dollars in research funding, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>The case is among the highest profile to come from the U.S. <a>Department of Justice</a>'s "China Initiative."</p>
<p>The effort, launched in 2018 to curb economic espionage from China, has faced criticism that it harms academic research and amounts to racial profiling of Chinese researchers.</p>
<p>Hundreds of faculty members at Stanford, Yale, Berkeley, Princeton, Temple and other prominent colleges have signed letters to U.S. Attorney General <a>Merrick Garland</a> calling on him to end the initiative.</p>
<p>Lieber has been on paid administrative leave from Harvard since being arrested in January 2020.</p>

<p>Zhao recommended the creation of special coordinator posts for Native Americans, U.S. ethnic minorities and pandemic response instead.</p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, Zeya said dialogue between Beijing and the Tibetan government in exile "is essential to resolve differences and to achieve meaningful autonomy for Tibetans."</p>

<div> World Hong Kong <a>China</a> <a>Tiananmen Square</a></div>
<p>The Danish creator of Hong Kong's Pillar of Shame, once a prominent memorial to the Tiananmen Square massacre, has threatened to sue for the sculpture's safe return after it was demolished by the city's public university on Thursday.</p>
<p>Galschiøt told the <a>BBC</a> it would have been impossible to remove the 2-ton Pillar of Shame without destroying it. He said the statue—depicting 50 anguished figures atop one another—was likely pulled down "in pieces."</p>
<p>"This is the reason I offered to come there and take it down, and help them to do that, because it's not possible for people who don't know anything about sculptures to do that," he said.</p>
<p>"This is my sculpture; this is private property. This belongs to an artist in Denmark," he said. "It's their duty to take care of that. And now they destroy it.</p>
<p>"I believe the law about private property is still intact in Hong Kong," Galschiøt said.</p>
<p>He told the Associated Press he would sue the university if necessary.</p>
<p>In a statement on Thursday, the University of Hong Kong said it had removed the sculpture "based on external legal advice and risk assessment."</p>
<p>It added: "No party has ever obtained any approval from the university to display the statue on campus, and the university has the right to take appropriate actions to handle it at any time."</p>
<p>The university said the pillar had been placed in storage and it would seek legal advice on subsequent action.</p>

<p>A patriotic Chinese film about the defeat of American-led forces at the start of the Korean War is about to end the year as the most successful movie of 2021—but it could yet be beaten by Spider-Man.</p>
<a>The Battle at Lake Changjin</a>, a $200 million project commissioned by the Chinese

<a>centennial</a> this summer—has made more than 99 percent of its revenue from China's own moviegoers, according to IMDb's tracker, Box Office Mojo. It wasn't released in the United States until November 19.
<p>The war epic is an unabashed Chinese retelling of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, which took place in the winter of 1950 between Chinese soldiers of the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) and U.S.-led <a>United Nations</a> forces.</p>
<p>UN troops pushed Soviet-backed <a>North Korean</a> troops back up the Korean Peninsula after they had crossed the border into <a>South Korea</a> that summer, sparking the conflict.</p>
<p>This part of the Korean War—known in Mao Zedong's legend as "the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea"—is now celebrated for the PVA forcing the better-equipped American forces away from the North's border with China.</p>
<p>The bloody Battle of Chosin Reservoir resulted in heavy losses on both sides, with the UN forces making a tactical withdrawal. PVA casualties were estimated at just under 50,000, while the U.S. is said to have lost nearly 18,000 men.</p>

<p>Thirteen million people in the northeastern Chinese city of Xi'an were put on lockdown as of midnight Wednesday, trapping some guests in hotels and requiring frequent testing after an increase of COVID-19 infections.</p>
<p>Xi'an on Thursday reported 63 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases, bringing the total cases to over 211 in the past week. The increase in infection caused the city to be put on lockdown as part of China's "zero tolerance" policy.</p>
<p>People staying at nearby hotels were stuck after the lockdown was enforced.</p>
<p>"We are not receiving any new guests, and no present guests are allowed to leave the hotel," said Li, a receptionist at the Hanting Hotel.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Hanting hotel requires guests to be tested for COVID-19 every two days.</p>
<p>For residents of Xi'an, everyone must stay at home. Only one person from each household will be allowed to leave every two days to go shopping for necessary items, according to the government order.</p>
<p>However, social media posts suggest that the restrictions on people leaving their homes aren't being strictly enforced.</p>
<p>It is unknown when the lockdown will end or if the new infections were from the Omicron variant. China reported seven Omicron cases but none in Xi'an.</p>
<p>The owner of a local bookshop said he had closed 10 days before, "fearing the worsening of the epidemic situation."</p>
<p>"I am now staying at home watching television." said the owner, who gave only his surname, Xiao.</p>
<p>"There will be an impact on our business, and we have no idea how long it will last," said Li.</p>
<p>Movement outside his compound requires permission from the local neighborhood committee, he said. "I think the situation will get better eventually, and I don't worry at all because we have the government behind us," Xiao said.</p>
<p>On the one hand, there is a tremendous amount of national pride and investment riding on the Olympics and few would want a cancellation, postponement or dramatic reimagining at this late stage.</p>
<p>On the other, Chinese authorities have adopted draconian measures throughout the pandemic under their policy of seeking to stamp out every last case—and it's hard to see how welcoming so many people from abroad will square with that strategy.</p>
<p>China has also been dealing with a substantial coronavirus outbreak in several cities in the eastern province of Zhejiang near Shanghai, although isolation measures there have been more narrowly targeted.</p>

<p>A statue at the University of Hong Kong memorializing those who lost their lives in the Tiananmen Square massacre was removed from the campus and put into storage Thursday.</p>
<p>The 26-foot red statue, called the Pillar of Shame, was sculpted in remembrance of when China's military opened fire on pro-Democracy protestors on June 4, 1989. The statue depicts bodies piled up on each other.</p>
<p>While Chinese officials said about 200 died in the massacre, other estimates put the number of victims in the hundreds or thousands, according to BBC. In 2017, British documents revealed that the death total was closer to 10,000.</p>
<p>The university said they removed the statue due to fears of its "legal risks."</p>
<p>Jens Galschioet, the sculptor who created the Pillar of Shame, told the Associated Press this was a message to students that Hong Kong is cracking down on dissent.</p>
<p>Galschioet has offered to take the statue back to Denmark. He also has gotten an offer to put the statue in a Washington, D.C., park across from the Chinese embassy. Canada, Norway and Taiwan have also offered him spots.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chinese authorities banned candlelight vigils for the past two years and shut down a museum dedicated to the incident. Some of the museum's key members are now behind bars.</p>
<p>"No party has ever obtained any approval from the university to display the statue on campus, and the university has the right to take appropriate actions to handle it at any time," the university said in a statement after its removal.</p>
<p>Galshioet compared the removal of the sculpture to "driving a tank through Arlington Cemetery," a burial ground for American war veterans.</p>
<p>"Grave desecration is also very frowned upon in China, but that's really what it is. It is almost a sacred monument," he told the Associated Press. "It is a sculpture for those who died."</p>
<p>Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said its removal was another worrying development in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Billy Kwok, a University of Hong Kong student, said the Pillar of Shame has been treated as part of the university by many who studied there.</p>
<p>"It's the symbol of whether (there is still) ... freedom of speech in Hong Kong," he said.</p>
<p>An employee at the university, Morgan Chan, said its removal "doesn't mean that history will be erased, and removing the pillar doesn't mean people won't learn about the history."</p>
<p>Wang Luyao, a student, had a more mixed reaction.</p>
<p>"To me, because I am from mainland China, perhaps my understanding of the Pillar of Shame is not as deep as the locals or students from Hong Kong and it is not that significant to me," Wang said.</p>
<p>"For me, it's like a landmark which provides an approach to understanding. For the University of Hong Kong, it should also be considered a landmark."</p>
