<p>Memory deficits, especially those acquired from brain injuries, are another potential cause of Pica.</p>
<sup>4, 5, 6</sup> Importantly, none of these individuals had Pica symptoms prior to brain injury. This suggests that memory deficits might contribute to Pica development.

<a>dementia</a>, where memory loss changes a person’s knowledge of flavors and alters their food preferences.
<p>Consequently, memory loss could cause sensory dysfunction, which could cause Pica. </p>
<h3>Anxiety and Compulsivity</h3>
<p>Relationships between obsessive/<a>compulsive behavior</a> and Pica are a more recent finding. In these cases, eating non-edibles becomes a way to reduce <a>anxiety</a>. </p>

<sup>7</sup> Her thoughts about eating the mud were significantly intrusive, sometimes lasting two hours daily. Notably, she also had no other major psychological diagnoses, as well as no family history and/or bodily predispositions to anxiety.
<sup>8</sup> This woman began compulsively eating pencil nibs to ease her anxiety; her habit lasted four years. Like other case studies, the woman showed no family history of
<a>obsessive-compulsive</a> disorder (OCD); she did, however, have iron and vitamin B12 deficiency.

<h1> Why We Need the Eating Disorders Prevention Act 2020 </h1>
<h2> It's time to shift focus from childhood obesity to eating disorder prevention. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Are Eating Disorders? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from an eating disorder</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>The foundations for eating disorder development begin before adolescence.</li>
<li>Childhood obesity prevention gets more funding than eating disorder prevention.</li>
<li>If implemented, the Eating Disorders Prevention Act would educate children about eating disorders and offer screeners.</li>
<p>While eating disorders (EDs) are most often diagnosed in <a>adolescence</a>, and young adulthood, the foundations for their development begin in <a>childhood</a>, which makes early life ED prevention important.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, few policies have been designed and implemented with the purpose of ED prevention in children.</p>
<sup>5</sup> This is because childhood obesity is perceived as a bigger, more dangerous problem than childhood eating disorders.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Education about EDs is lacking.</div> <div>Source: Annie Spratt/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Early Life Foundations for Disordered Eating</h3>
<p>We need ED prevention in childhood because the groundwork for <a>disordered eating</a> development begins during this time. Our early life environments help establish our relationships with food and how we think about our bodies.</p>

<a>neural</a> pathways become less flexible as we age. Consequently, pathways that are repeatedly shaped a specific way during childhood might stay that way in adulthood.

<h3>Obstacles to Eating Disorder Prevention</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Funding and public misconceptions hinder ED preventions.</div> <div>Source: Velizar Ivanov/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Unfortunately, because public misconceptions about EDs are widespread, most interactions children have will be with people (e.g., parents; teachers) who aren’t familiar with ED symptoms, risk factors, or treatment.</p>
<p>This becomes problematic when we consider obesity discussions in the public sphere. Specifically, the way we talk about healthy eating for obesity prevention differs from how we talk about healthy eating for ED prevention.</p>

<h1> What Animals Can Teach Us About Anorexia </h1>
<h2> Animal models of anorexia are vital for eating disorders research. </h2>
<li>Anorexia research with human participants has limitations.</li>
<li>Animal models of anorexia can't recreate every symptom of the disorder.</li>
<li>Animal models have helped researchers explore and understand causes and consequences of, as well as possible treatments for, anorexia.</li>
<p>Human research poses several limitations that make studying anorexia nervosa (AN) from a neurobiological approach difficult.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Anna Shvets/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>First, because people clinically diagnosed with AN make up less than 1 percent of the population, finding enough human participants for a research study is challenging.<sup>9</sup></p>
<p>Considering these research limitations, as well as the low recovery rate of AN, it becomes necessary to develop animal models that allow researchers to further explore the brain’s role in AN.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Alexas Fotos/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>A major challenge of creating rodent models for research is making sure that they accurately mimic the symptoms of an illness in ways that are translatable to humans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, animal models can't perfectly replicate every feature of a clinical disorder. This is due to biological differences between animals and humans, variations within disorders between humans, and ethical concerns.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Taken/pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Therefore, while food restriction models can help researchers explore how food restriction impacts the brain and body, they can't be used to explore relationships between the brain and motivations for self-starvation.</p>
<p>The anx/anx mouse model of AN relies on a genetic mutation that causes early life self-starvation.<sup>4</sup> Because it induces self-starvation, the anx/anx model is slightly more translatable to humans than the food restriction model.</p>
<p>One benefit of the anx/anx model is that it allows researchers to explore the genetic underpinnings contributing to self-starvation.</p>
<h3>Dehydration-induced AN</h3>
<sup>5</sup> This causes voluntary food restriction at any age, making dehydration-induced AN more robust than the anx/anx mouse.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Snapwire/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Activity-based anorexia (ABA)</h3>
<h3>What drives these behaviors in ABA?</h3>
<sup>6</sup> Consequently, in addition to body dissatisfaction, hyperactivity is another known contributor to excessive exercise in AN.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pixabay/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Explanations for why hyperactivity manifests in ABA, and why it's accompanied with self-starvation, however, remain unclear.</p>
<sup>1</sup> This has been supported by brain analyses of ABA rats, which show reward processing dysfunctions.
<sup>6</sup> Nonetheless, some studies have countered this hypothesis by showing that warming ABA rodents for 12 hours doesn’t reduce ABA symptoms (e.g., hyperactivity).
<sup>2</sup> Rather, it takes continuous warming for at least 24 hours for ABA symptoms to subside.
<a>sex</a> differences have been demonstrated in ABA rodents, with male and female mice showing different food intake, hyperactivity, and weight loss patterns.
<sup>8</sup> Given that AN likely manifests differently in men and women, having a model that could account for these sex differences becomes vital when developing AN treatments (e.g., pharmaceuticals).
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Priscilla Du Preez/unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Given the overwhelming ineffectiveness of treatments for AN and the disorder's high fatality rate, animal models have the potential to improve these statistics. </p>

<h1> COVID-19, Social Isolation, and Eating Disorder Increases </h1>
<h2> COVID-19 lockdowns have contributed to a rise in eating disorders. But why? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Are Eating Disorders? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from an eating disorder</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>COVID-19 isolation has contributed to an increase in eating disorder symptoms. </li>
<li>Social isolation during COVID-19 confinement can contribute to increased anxiety and depression. </li>
<li>Some eating disorder behaviors could become unhealthy coping strategies for temporarily reducing anxiety and depression during this time. </li>
<p><a>COVID-19</a> repercussions (e.g., <a>social isolation</a>) have contributed to several additional crises, including a global rise in <a>eating disorder</a> (ED) symptoms.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Polina Tankilevitch/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<sup>2</sup> These adults also felt more preoccupied with food, exercise, and their appearance than prior to the pandemic. Those with a previous or current ED diagnosis were most likely to experience these increases.
<p>Each of these factors deserves a full explanation and, therefore, I will solely focus on social isolation for this post. Specifically, how it might impact the brain in ways that contribute to current increases in ED symptoms during the pandemic.</p>
<h3>COVID-19, Social Isolation, and Eating Disorders</h3>
<p>The current pandemic has upended how, how often, and with whom we socialize. While this creates new challenges for many, these changes might be especially difficult for those with an ED.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Alexander Krivitskiy/unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<sup>7 </sup>Socializing, however, is an important ED prevention measure, with research showing that good social skills can reduce an individual’s risk of developing an ED.
<p>Socializing also gives individuals with an ED a support system and minimizes opportunities for them to devote time to their ED behaviors (e.g., exercise).</p>
<p>Recognizing the importance of relationships between socializing and ED development, Fernández-Aranda et al. (2020) recently constructed the COVID Isolation Eating Scale (CIES) for research. The aims of the CIES are to<sup>4</sup>:</p>
<li>Measure how confinement during COVID-19 lockdown impacts EDs (and obesity).</li>
<li>Measure changes to ED behaviors (e.g., eating symptoms) and relevant mental health factors (e.g., dysfunctional emotions) during confinement.</li>
<li>Explore <a>telemedicine</a> difficulties during confinement.</li>
<a>depression</a> compared to people diagnosed with an ED. This suggests that people with an undiagnosed ED might be particularly vulnerable during lockdown, possibly because of fewer available treatment opportunities.
<h3>Social Isolation and Health</h3>
<p>It's unclear why chronic social isolation increases the risk for illness development.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Mart Production/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>neuroscience</a> offers a more nuanced perspective.
<sup>5</sup> Nuance is important here because social experiences and our perceptions of them vary. For example, having a spouse might be comforting for one person, but
<a>stressful</a> for another, especially if the relationship is abusive.
<p>Therefore, how individuals perceive their isolation during COVID-19 confinement is important to consider.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those with an ED are often oriented to perceive themselves and the world negatively; this makes these individuals susceptible to loneliness during COVID-19 lockdowns.<sup>8</sup></p>
<h3>Perceived Loneliness the Brain</h3>

<p>Threats to our well-being don't have to be deadly (e.g., illness). They can also be psychological (e.g., <a>public speaking</a>). The HPA regulates the body regardless, keeping us from becoming overstressed.</p>
<p>The problem with a chronic threat (e.g., social isolation), however, is that it makes the HPA axis work tirelessly to protect us from our perceived threat. This causes chronic stress.</p>
<p>In this way, social isolation can increase ED susceptibility. </p>
<h3>From Perceived Loneliness to Eating Disorder</h3>
<sup>9</sup> Our brain cells are what regulate our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Consequently, these changes can result in increased stress, anxiety, and depression.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Annie Spratt/unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<sup>10</sup> Both of these consequences alter how our brain cells regulate our behaviors, which, again, can lead to increased anxiety, as well as decreased sociability.
<sup>12</sup>, two implications of social isolation, have been shown to contribute to ED symptoms. This is because certain ED behaviors, including food restriction
<sup>15</sup> have been shown to reduce anxiety and alleviate stress for some individuals. Simply put, ED behaviors can serve as unhealthy coping mechanisms for psychological ailments (e.g., anxiety).
<p>Putting this together, perceived loneliness during COVID-19 confinement can cause chronic stress. This can lead to bodily changes that impact our brain in ways that could increase anxiety and depression for some individuals. </p>

<h1> 1 Minute Mindfulness Exercise to Calm Down When Overwhelmed </h1>
<h2> Take a minute to prioritize the chaos. </h2>
<li>Overwhelm happens when you think you have to figure out everything all at once. </li>
<li>To quash overwhelm, you have to permit yourself to figure things out in time. </li>
<li>By completing a mindfulness exercise, you can establish if most of your thoughts are past or future-based and bring your mind to the present.</li>

<p>The never-ending saga that is COVID-19, new variants, canceled holiday plans, kids, health, work, school, money, <a>loneliness</a>, relationships, etc., the list goes on, for all of us, every single day.</p>
<a>stressful</a> life events. It’s more difficult than ever to get grounded, prioritize, and think clearly while we’re being bombarded with ever-evolving news, media, and change.
<a>magical thinking</a>. It is an impossible and unrealistic expectation that you will solve all of your problems in one day.
<p>We can argue about that another time; for now, I’d like to show you a simple exercise created by Gina M. Biegel, LMFT psychotherapist and author, which will bring you to the present moment, focus on the now, and coordinate the mental chaos.</p>
<p>As the famous Thich Nhat Hanh quote goes,</p>
<p>This exercise will serve to get you in touch with your peace. </p>
<li>Please make three columns on the paper labeled “Past,” “Present,” and "Future.”</li>
<p>The Good News and Your Results: </p>
<p>Yes, taking the lessons and <a>wisdom</a> from past experiences is meaningful and essential, but <a>depression</a>, resentment, and sadness will become your dominant emotional experience if most of your thoughts are focused there. </p>
<a>projection</a>, trying to keep you safe and protected, but it does not change the fact that it does not exist.
<p>Yes, planning for the future is important and can help prevent conflict, but if most of your thoughts are future-based, <a>anxiety</a>, angst, and apprehension are not trailing far behind.</p>
<a>happiness</a>, peace, and satisfaction. It is here that you can be okay while not knowing all the answers right now.
<p>I’ll sign off with a quote from Timber Hawkeye and a wish for 2022 from myself, “You can’t calm the storm, so stop trying. What you can do is calm yourself. The storm will pass.” </p>

<a>burned out</a>, and exhausted. Just like our clients, therapists can be struggling as we enter the second winter of this pandemic and the constant influx of information we have to process.
<a>Shonda Rhimes</a> style. I can say now in hindsight, even some small “yesses” lead to some very positive changes in my life over the course of time like building new friendships, hobbies, and business opportunities.
<a>perfectionist</a>. However, 20 months into a global pandemic, as a therapist working during a global mental health crisis, and as a mother with three young children at home, I’ve decided the time is now for “No.”
<a>grateful</a> to carry with me the benefits of my own personal
<a>psychoanalysis</a>, which helps me to identify my overwhelm before it grows into resentment,
<a>anxiety</a>. Knowing myself, and identifying these feelings, and understanding them led me to plan my “Year of No!”
<p>What does a “Year of No” entail?</p>
<p>1) Setting boundaries that work for me.</p>
<p>2) Staying in touch with my core values.</p>
<p>And there are “No’s” that won’t change, even with time. “No, that is just not something I feel comfortable with.” Knowing who you are and what you stand for helps tremendously with this one.</p>
<p>3) Understanding my limits.</p>
<p>What to expect when you say no</p>
<p>1) Disappointment or disdain</p>
<a>stress</a> are worth it. Here’s to 2022, a year of “No.” Will you join me? Even if your answer is a resounding “No,” I’m still planning to do it anyway.

<h1> The Thing We Call SARS-CoV-2 Is Not Alive </h1>
<h2> Contrary to popular belief, most viruses are not living things. </h2>
<li>Having a purpose suggests having a consciousness or a hardwired instinct. SARS-CoV-2 has no purpose because it is not alive. </li>
<li>The SARS-CoV-2 virus does have the capacity to adapt to new environments.</li>
<li>With a billion replications, accidents will inevitably happen, and those accidents translate into the mutations that SARS-CoV-2 now has.</li>

<p>The differences are astoundingly many.</p>
<h3>Why is SARS-CoV-2 not alive? </h3>
<a>mimivirus</a> is one. Not SARS-CoV-2. I don’t know much about it, except that that is what confuses the opinions among biologists on whether or not viruses are alive.
<p>In and of itself, SARS-CoV-2 moves along a chemical trail. In other words, the question of whether or not the virus is living comes down to this: is it capable of yielding protein molecules by itself?</p>
<p>For a virus to be considered alive, it must:</p>
<ul><li>Have a cell containing a nucleus.</li> <li>Be able to use its energy to replicate itself or its genetic material.</li> <li>Respond to its environment.</li> </ul>
<p>1. The virions of SARS-CoV-2 don’t use any energy. When they reach a host cell, they use that host's energy and tools to make more virions.</p>
<p>3. The virions react to <a>the environment</a>, but only because the host does. </p>
