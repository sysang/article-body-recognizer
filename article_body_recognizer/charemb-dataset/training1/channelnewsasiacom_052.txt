<p>SINGAPORE: The Government is not against taxing wealth, but such policies should be practical and effective in a way that the rich cannot avoid them easily, Second Minister for Finance Indranee Rajah told Parliament on Monday (Nov 1).</p>
<p>Ms Indranee was responding to an adjournment motion raised by Member of Parliament Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) on the need for Singapore to consider more types of wealth taxes.</p>
<p>“The question has never been one of whether we want to tax wealth, but a practical one of how to do so effectively such that it cannot be avoided easily,” she said.</p>
<p>“So, at the end of the day, I think we don't have any issue with wealth taxes per se. We just want to make sure that whatever we put in place actually works.”</p>
<p>This comes after Finance Minister Lawrence Wong said on Oct 15 that <a>Singapore continues to study how it can expand its wealth tax system</a> in the face of key challenges such as inequality and climate change.</p>
<p>Singapore currently imposes property tax but not other types like a property gains or inheritance tax. These are different from a general wealth tax, which involves trying to value different assets.</p>
<h2>DIVERSIFY REVENUE, FIGHT INEQUALITY</h2>
<p>In his adjournment motion, Associate Professor Lim said wealth taxes could improve the diversity of the Government’s revenue sources, and help manage societal problems that result from rising inequality.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Lim listed a few options Singapore could explore to remedy this, including reintroducing the inheritance tax, although he noted there are concerns this could weaken the country's value proposition as a wealth centre.</p>
<p>Another option would be to make estate duties more progressive, such as by imposing another tier for higher-value properties, he said.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Lim also proposed introducing a general tax of 0.5 per cent on net wealth in excess of S$10 million, 1 per cent above S$50 million and 2 per cent above S$1 billion.</p>
<p>He added that this tax could be designated to a special-purpose foundation, mandated to exhaust its entire endowment, with payouts allocated towards government-approved uses that are “consistent with national priorities”.</p>
<p>Taxation could also be restricted to instances when net wealth gains are positive, suggested Assoc Prof Lim.</p>
<p>Noting that Singapore has had experience with other forms of wealth taxes in the past, he added that it should not fear risking its competitive position, as other jurisdictions have already moved ahead with similar taxes on capital.</p>
<p>“More generally, we need to disabuse ourselves from the mistaken notion that low taxes offer the most competitive advantage for our status as a global financial centre.”</p>
<h2>TAXING IN A “COMPETITIVE WAY”</h2>
<p>In her response, Ms Indranee disagreed with Assoc Prof Lim’s suggestion that companies might no longer look at tax rates, stating that this cannot be discounted completely.</p>
<p>“And it must be remembered that wealth can move. Talent, both Singaporean as well as foreign, can move. Companies can move,” she said.</p>
<p>“So we have to tax in a way that is competitive, and allows people and companies to generate revenue in order to encourage them to stay here, and that revenue then can be used and reallocated and redistributed.”</p>
<p>Ms Indranee also spoke on Assoc Prof Lim’s comments about how the <a>goods and services tax (GST)</a> affects lower- and middle-income groups disproportionately more, calling it a line that the Workers’ Party repeats “very often”.</p>
<p>Ms Indranee said that the GST system was designed to be tilted towards helping the middle- and lower-income, pointing to schemes such as <a>GST vouchers</a> and the <a>S$6 billion Assurance Package</a> to see these groups through the tax hike.</p>
<h2>STRIKING THE RIGHT BALANCE</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, Ms Indranee said the Government “is not in disagreement” with Assoc Prof Lim in that it is constantly looking for ways to supplement its revenue, but noted that this has to be done in a way that “strikes the right balance”.</p>
<p>“So on wealth taxes, it is not about having more types of wealth taxes per se. Rather, what matters is having wealth tax policies that work in the context of each jurisdiction,” she said.</p>
<p>For instance Ms Indranee pointed out that Switzerland, another wealth management hub with a net wealth tax, estate duty and property-related tax, has a wealth tax revenue of about 1.9 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>This is comparable to Singapore's wealth tax revenue, which is at about 1.8 per cent of its GDP, she said, adding that Singapore will continue to review wealth tax.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Ms Indranee said Singapore has a tax system that is fair, with those who have more contributing more.</p>
<p>“It is dynamic as it places a low tax burden on workers in businesses and allows them to retain the fruits of their labour,” she added.</p>
<p>“We care about competitiveness not for the sake of competitiveness, but to promote growth for the benefit of all, and it is sustainable, both fiscally and environmentally.</p>
<p>“This is what a well-designed 21st century tax system should look like, and we will continue to refine it to make it even better.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> More than 400 students missed PSLE paper due to COVID-19: Chan Chun Sing </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Emil Chan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: About 430 students, or 1.1 per cent of those registered for the 2021 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), missed at least one paper due to reasons related to COVID-19, Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing said on Monday (Nov 1).</p>
<p>In a written reply to questions raised by Members of Parliament Darryl David (PAP-Ang Mo Kio) and Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied), the Education Minister said 39,281 students registered for the 2021 PSLE written examinations.</p>
<p>Of the 840 students, about 690 students managed to sit for all written papers.</p>
<p>“All special consideration applications are assessed on each case’s merit, to ensure that the grades awarded are as accurate and fair as possible.”</p>
<h2>IMPACT OF NEW PSLE SCORING SYSTEM</h2>
<p>This year also saw a new PSLE Scoring System being used for the first time.</p>
<p>The Education Minister said that the new scoring system does not affect the syllabuses nor the standards of the PSLE.</p>
<p>Mr Chan noted that MOE and SEAB removed Common Last Topics from the 2021 PSLE after recognising that Primary 6 students may encounter disruptions to their learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“In addition, SEAB has processes in place to take the disruptions caused by COVID-19 into consideration to ensure that this cohort of students will not be disadvantaged by the exceptional circumstances,” he added.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Workload for teachers ‘more than doubled’ during COVID-19 pandemic: Chan Chun Sing </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ang Hwee Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The workload of teachers has “more than doubled” to keep the school system going during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing on Tuesday (Nov 2). </p>
<p>“I think we should all thank our teachers and educators, because over the last two years, it has really been very tough on them,” said the Education MInister. </p>
<p>“Not many of us realise that in order to keep our school system going, the workload for teachers has more than doubled.” </p>
<p>To switch seamlessly from in-person lessons to home-based learning, teachers need to spend “a lot of time” preparing more than two sets of lesson plans, he noted. </p>
<p>They also need to take care of students with higher needs, including those who need to return to school during home-based learning. </p>
<p>“On top of all this, the school leaders and teachers also have to perform the role of contact tracing teams in case there are cases in the school. And we have to do this without additional manpower support,” he added. </p>
<p>If teachers are “not well taken care of” and “not in the best of conditions”, it is “very difficult” to expect them to take good care of the students, said Mr Chan. </p>
<p>About 80 school staff sought support from MOE’s in-house counsellors in 2020, an increase from the annual average of 50 before the COVID-19 pandemic, he added. </p>
<p>The number of teaching staff from institutes of higher learning seeking counselling support has also increased, said Mr Chan. </p>
<p>MOE does not have “more detailed data” as information from the counselling sessions are kept confidential, and staff are not required to report mental distress or psychiatric issues, he added. </p>
<h2>MOE MEASURES TO REDUCE WORKLOAD </h2>
<p>The Education Ministry has adjusted various programmes in the short term to lighten the workload of teachers, said Mr Chan. </p>
<p>For example, MOE has “re-prioritised initiatives” and reduced schools’ involvement in the work from its headquarters and pilot programmes, said the Education Minister. </p>
<p>“Schools have also been given greater flexibility to pace the implementation of selected initiatives, including deferring implementation if this helps to spread out staff workload,” he added. </p>
<p>This includes allowing secondary schools and JCs the option to defer the implementation of blended learning to 2022, instead of Term 3 of 2021 as originally planned, said Mr Chan. </p>
<p>School leaders have been “providing guidance” to teachers on avoiding parent-staff communication after school operating hours except for urgent matters like student safety and well-being, he noted. </p>
<p>“This can minimise the blurring of lines between work and personal time,” said Mr Chan. </p>
<p>“In line with the streamlined health protocols, ringfencing policies and contact tracing processes in schools have now also been significantly simplified and teachers’ workload related to COVID-19 management is being reduced.” </p>
<p>In the longer term, MOE needs to “do much more” to help teachers cope. This could include using technology to scale up teaching resources so that teachers can apply their time more strategically to students who need the most help, said Mr Chan. </p>
<p>“That is my wish over the long term. And we will progressively roll this out.” </p>
<h2>SUPPORTING TEACHERS AS A SOCIETY</h2>
<p>Mr Chan urged parents and the rest of society to partner teachers to support students. </p>
<p>“Let me say this, I think our teachers work very hard. They care a lot for our students, and I don’t think our teachers are afraid to work hard,” said the Education Minister. </p>
<p>“But in working hard, they must be given a sense of agency, that they are in control, that they are doing things with conviction, and that it is important.” </p>
<p>“It is one thing for a child to call up the teacher at midnight to say that he’s in trouble. It is another thing for the parent to call up the teacher at midnight to ask whether the child has spelling, and should wear a red or blue t-shirt.” </p>
<p>If the child forgets about these things, it is part of their learning experience, Mr Chan stressed. </p>
<p>“As parents, don’t need to overly protect our child and children and deprive them of the learning experience.</p>
<p>“I think we need to establish this clear understanding of expectations of parents and society,” he said, adding that a lot of these expectations are also projected on teachers.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Almost 50,000 Singapore residents received mental health treatment every year from 2016 to 2019: MOH </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ang Hwee Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: About 49,800 Singapore residents received treatment for mental health issues every year on average from 2016 to 2019, said Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Health (MOH) Rahayu Mahzam on Tuesday (Nov 2). </p>
<p>This number includes those seen at public and private hospitals, polyclinics and general practitioner clinics, she added. </p>
<p>Data for 2020 is not available yet, said Ms Rahayu, responding to a parliamentary question from Member of Parliament Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied).</p>
<p>Mr Faisal had asked for the number of people receiving treatment for mental health issues every year from 2016 to 2020, those treated for depression and anxiety, and the demographics and causes of these cases. </p>
<p>The average number of residents seeking care for depression and anxiety every year was 33,700 and 34,000 respectively in the same period, though this includes repeat attendances and are “not unique headcounts”, said Ms Rahayu in her response. </p>
<p>About 60 per cent of patients with anxiety or depression are under 60 years old, 70 per cent of them are Chinese, and about 30 per cent live in three-room or smaller public flats, she added. </p>
<p>“Breakdown by patients’ education level is not available,” she added. </p>
<p>The 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study (SMHS) found that unemployment, as well as divorced or separated marital status are “significantly associated” with depression, said Ms Rahayu. </p>
<p>“The same study postulated that stress may be a risk factor for development of anxiety disorder. The 2010 SMHS found that nearly half of those with depression and anxiety also had a chronic physical illness.” </p>
<h2>ANNUAL SUICIDE NUMBERS</h2>
<p>Mr Faisal also asked about the annual number of suicides and attempted suicides, as well as the demographics and causes of these cases. </p>
<p>Younger people aged 19 and below account for “disproportionately fewer” suicides, said Ms Rahayu in her response. </p>
<p>The converse is true for people aged 60 and above, she said, noting that the number of suicide cases is public information, released by the Immigration and Checkpoint Authority (ICA) in its annual report on the registration of births and deaths. </p>
<p>According to the <a>2020 report</a> published in June this year, there were 452 deaths by suicide in 2020, up from 400 in 2019.</p>
<p>Of the 452 cases in 2020, 320 were male and 132 were female.</p>
<p>Regarding the demographics of suicide cases, Ms Rayayu said: “By race, Malays account for disproportionately fewer suicides, while converse is true for Indians. Breakdown by education level and economic background (is) not available,” </p>
<p>“There are usually multiple factors that may lead a person to commit and attempt suicide. These factors include relationship, family, social, financial, mental and physical health issues.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Nearly 100 work permit holders admitted to IMH between Jan and Sep this year: MOM </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: A total of 98 work permit holders were admitted to the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) between January and September this year, said Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng in Parliament on Tuesday (Nov 2). </p>
<p>This is lower than the number in the same period in 2020, but higher compared to that of 2019, he added. </p>
<p>The minister noted a study by Yale-NUS from June to October 2020, which showed "no notable difference” in stress, anxiety and depression levels among locals and migrant workers.</p>
<p>However, there were indications of higher stress levels among migrant workers with movement restrictions, said Dr Tan. </p>
<p>“Nonetheless, any easing of movement restrictions will need to be done in a careful and calibrated manner, so as not to trade one stress for another - in particular the stress of overwhelming our healthcare system,” he added. </p>
<p>Since August, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has allowed some dormitory residents to visit recreation centres, and recently increased the frequency of these visits from once to three times a week.</p>
<h2>COMMUNITY VISITS PROGRAMME</h2>
<p>Apart from visits to recreation centres, there is also the <a>community visit programme</a> for vaccinated migrant workers, which was recently expanded from an initial 500 workers to 3,000 workers per week, Dr Tan noted. </p>
<p>Beyond Little India, the programme was expanded to include areas like Geylang Serai and Joo Chiat, and the visit duration was increased to eight hours, he added. </p>
<p>In a supplementary question, Workers’ Party chief and Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh asked what were the considerations in determining the number of workers allowed to take part in the programme. </p>
<p>Dr Tan said migrant workers were asked what would be important for them when they were allowed visits to the community, and many of them wanted to go to places of worship.</p>
<p>MOM’s Assurance, Care and Engagement group (ACE) team approached these sites as well as other shopkeepers to work with them to accommodate the workers and fulfil these needs. </p>
<p>“At some point we were also concerned about that given the space that they are living in, to ensure that infection, if it comes into the dorms, doesn't spread,” said the Manpower Minister. </p>
<p>“So we took all the necessary precautions in terms of pre-event testing before they left, and after coming back, we also tested them.” </p>
<p>MOM ascertained that the “entire visit” was safe, and was able to “adequately address” their physical, mental and social needs on top of keeping the workers “medically well-protected”, leading to the expansion of the scheme. </p>
<p>At the start of the pilot, MOM also had to get employers on board, he added. </p>
<p>“Because even though we opened up 500 a week, we found that for a while we were only getting about 50, 60 per cent of them coming on board,” he said, adding that there were also workers who signed up and cancelled at the last minute. </p>
<p>After planning for all these “logistic issues”, MOM increased the number of workers in the scheme to 3,000. </p>
<p>“Now the plan, hopefully in the ensuing weeks and months ahead, is that as we move to this new normal, the plan is not to restrict but to open up even more,” said Dr Tan. </p>
<p>“But at this particular point in time because we just started the 3,000, I think last weekend just about three days ago, we will maintain and watch it for a while.”</p>
<h2>SUPPORT ECOSYSTEM FOR MIGRANT WORKERS</h2>
<p>Since November 2020, the Project DAWN task force has worked with non-government organisations, healthcare partners, employers and dormitory operators to develop a “support ecosystem approach”.</p>
<p>This means looking out for migrant workers, listening to their concerns, identifying those that need more support and linking them up with the appropriate care channels, said Dr Tan. </p>
<p>“MOM is committed to support the mental well-being of our migrant workers and is sparing no efforts to strengthen the mental health support ecosystem for them," he added.</p>
<p>The Manpower Ministry is raising awareness of mental health issues and broadening its training outreach for basic mental health and psychological first aid, he said.</p>
<p>The ministry is also working with non-government organisation partners to make counselling and paracounselling more accessible, said Dr Tan. </p>
<p>Adding that mental healthcare has been made “even more” accessible, he noted that any migrant workers identified to benefit from mental healthcare will be linked up with “appropriate services” including counselling hotlines.</p>
<p>“In particular, an escalation pathway with IMH has also been developed to ensure timely care for more severe cases, when necessary.” </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Parliament passes Bill to safeguard Singapore’s energy security and reliability in the long term </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Vanessa Lim </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Parliament passed a Bill on Tuesday (Nov 2) to provide the Energy Market Authority (EMA) with more powers to secure Singapore’s electricity supply, as the country transits to cleaner sources of energy.</p>
<p>EMA will now be able to acquire, build, own and operate critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>These include energy storage solutions, transmission infrastructure and open cycle gas turbines (OCGT), which refer to generation units that can be brought online quickly to augment any shortfall in power capacity.</p>
<p>The existing OCGTs in Singapore are more than 30 years old and are “long overdue” for replacement, said Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng in Parliament. </p>
<p>Where needed, EMA will also be able to directly operate the critical infrastructure or set up a subsidiary to do so.</p>
<p>He added that EMA will put safeguards in place to ensure that it does not compete unfairly against private generation companies.</p>
<p>For example, EMA may set up a separate subsidiary to own and operate a generating unit, and will put in place proper procedures and governance structures to mitigate any conflict of interests, Dr Tan said.</p>
<p>Other amendments include enhancing the protection of critical electricity and gas infrastructure by making it an offence to damage protective infrastructure housing cables or pipelines such as cable tunnels.</p>
<h2>ENERGY SECURITY AND RESILIENCE</h2>
<p>During the debate on the Bill, several Members of Parliament, including Mr Melvin Yong (PAP-Radin Mas) and Mr Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied), raised concerns about the Open Electricity Market, following the recent exit of several energy retailers.</p>
<p>Over the past three weeks, <a>iSwitch</a>, <a>Ohm Energy</a>, <a>Best Electricity</a>, UGS Energy and SilverCloud Energy have pulled out of the market, citing volatile market conditions after a spike in wholesale energy prices.</p>
<p>According to Dr Tan, these five retailers had supplied electricity to about 9 per cent of all consumers, including both residential households and commercial users.</p>
<p>He reiterated that the <a>Open Electricity Market remains viable</a>, adding that the Government is “very, very mindful” of the higher electricity bills that households and businesses will face.</p>
<p>The Government has been providing targeted assistance, he said, including U-Save rebates to help lower- and middle-income families with utility expenses, as well as programmes to raise awareness of electricity conservation.</p>
<p>Dr Tan said his ministry, together with the Ministry of Finance, is monitoring electricity prices in Singapore and looking into whether further assistance is needed for affected households and businesses.</p>
<p>In the long term, Singapore has taken measures such as diversifying its energy sources and developing low-carbon alternative to ensure its energy security, he said.</p>
<p>Last month, the country said it intends to <a>import up to 30 per cent of its electricity supply</a> from low-carbon sources by 2035, and announced a slew of trials with other countries to prepare for electricity imports.</p>
<p>Singapore has also pledged to quadruple its solar capacity to at least 2 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2030, as it looks to cleaner sources of energy.</p>
<p>Dr Tan said that as Singapore starts to import electricity and harness more solar energy, it needs to have sufficient amounts of other types of backups, including energy storage systems and generators, to ensure energy security.</p>
<p>Currently, power generation companies are required to stockpile at least 60 days of fuel reserves, in the event of disruptions to Singapore’s natural gas supply.</p>
<p>He said the Government will work with the private sector to build the necessary infrastructure to diversify and to secure the country’s energy supply.</p>
<p>In the event that the private sector fails to do so, the updated law will allow EMA to step in and provide the adequate infrastructure.</p>
<a>developing a “digital twin”</a> or a computer replica of its power grid assets and network, to improve the reliability of its electricity supply and support the deployment of cleaner energy sources.
<h2>REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS</h2>
<p>MPs also highlighted the need for the power sector to decarbonise, with the sector currently accounting for about 40 per cent of the country's carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Under the new law, EMA will be able to <a>implement standards and policies</a> which could require the companies to reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions they produce and spur the use of more energy and carbon-efficient technologies.</p>
<p>Mr Liang Eng Hwa (PAP-Bukit Panjang) suggested that EMA can look at more targeted measures to move the sector towards lower emissions, instead of using the powers derived from the Bill to institute more broad-based measures.</p>
<p>He added that with the progressive build-up of the four supply “switches” and diversification of the various energy sources, the regulations and the development of the sector would also need a more differentiated approach.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr Louis Ng (PAP-Nee Soon) asked if MTI would commit to setting an aggressive timeline for releasing EMA’s policies, given that power generators will need time to adapt to any new regulations.</p>
<p>In response, Dr Tan said the first iteration of the proposed measures may be released for public consultation as early as next year.</p>
<p>In developing greenhouse gas emission standards, Dr Tan said EMA will ensure that they are reasonable and realistic but also ambitious.</p>
<p>“Companies will be given time to transition and the public can monitor our progress in decarbonising the power grid via the grid emissions factor report which EMA publishes on its website every year,” he added.</p>
<h2>IMPACT OF ENERGY TRANSITION ON ELECTRICITY PRICES</h2>
<p>Mr Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) and Mr Desmond Choo (PAP-Tampines) raised concerns over the impact of Singapore’s energy transition on electricity prices.</p>
<p>Dr Tan said while the cost of generation will be lower, infrastructure enhancements in the form of additional landing sites, subsea interconnections as well as backup and grid enhancements will add to overall costs.</p>
<p>“At the same time, the Government will continue to provide targeted support for vulnerable to help them cope with higher electricity costs,” he added.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Almost one year on, what has livestreaming of Parliament achieved? </h1>
<div> <p>The success of the livestreaming of Parliament is not about how many people tune in but how it strengthens our democracy, says Institute of Policy Studies’ Dr Gillian Koh.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Gillian Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Since Jan 4, the public has been able to watch the proceedings in Singapore’s Parliament as they unfold, even if few might have lasted through the 10-hour marathon sessions in September and October.</p>
<p>This has raised the level of public engagement in the governance process and improved the quality of data and argumentation in our legislature.</p>
<p>Surely, it has also chastened our politicians to maintain integrity and dignity in their approach to the thrust and parry of parliamentary debate. </p>
<p>Unfiltered, the livestream hosted by the Ministry of Communications and Information was originally thought to be a bad idea - for fear it would feed the grandstanding, seeking to provoke rather than persuade with rigorous, rational deliberation. </p>
<p>Far better, it was thought, to leave it to professional journalists. They would spotlight key debates and decisions, disciplined by the constraints of time and conciseness, and be guided by a “nation-building” ethos expected of them. </p>
<p>Of course, this has long been overtaken by netizens and citizen journalists crafting what they think people should really be reading and thinking. </p>
<p>Audiovisual recordings and transcripts of parliamentary proceedings remain available for record-keeping and deep analysis.</p>
<p>So, what difference has the livestreaming of parliamentary sessions made on national discourse?</p>
<h2>CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN REAL TIME</h2>
<p>First, the live medium has lent immediacy to the reactions and responses of the public to parliamentary business. This is a lesser evil than the apathy or cynicism of citizens. </p>
<p>Ordinarily, a few hundred viewers tune in to Parliament at any time, but more do so when they are made aware ahead of time that hot-button issues would be debated. </p>
<p>Viewers also invite contacts to join in through social media feeds but there is no doubt both supporters and opponents of parliamentarians do the same. Reactions can emerge swiftly. </p>
<p>Social media lit up asking why Mr Leong could not be more persuasive about his specific issue with the FTA with India with its obligations on flows of workers to Singapore. </p>
<p>Others asked if the Government bench was trying to obfuscate the issue by alleging that Mr Leong was racist for picking on this particular agreement.</p>
<p>On Nov 1, word of her mea culpa circulated as she delivered it and netizens reacted contemporaneously.</p>
<p>Second, livestreaming has thrown up these ground-up reminders to parliamentarians that they are held to higher standards of ethics and decorum.</p>
<p>The virality of circulation through social media means parliamentarians can be held accountable for their conduct in ways that can be unexpected and more severe than might have been a year ago.</p>
<h2>MORE EVIDENCE-DRIVEN DEBATES AND DETAILED EXPLANATIONS </h2>
<p>Third, the development has spurred more evidence-driven debates on and detailed explanations of public policy and its implementation. </p>
<p>Hard numbers on workers entering through FTA provisions helped some members of public to recognise there were other reasons for the sense of insecurity Singaporean workers are feeling.</p>
<p>Those other factors are now being addressed through measures announced in Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s National Day Rally (NDR).</p>
<p>We see the same with the complexities of the Government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
<p>Facing complaints on the ground, it was possible to assess not just the validity, but also the sincerity, of the leaders’ explanation of the challenges in implementing the Home Recovery Programme.</p>
<h2>EVALUATING SUCCESS OF PARLIAMENTARY LIVESTREAMING</h2>
<p>The success of the livestreaming is not a question of whether vast numbers of people tune in as they might on Budget Day or the NDR. </p>
<p>These boil down to why our votes matter. </p>
<p>With 104 parliamentarians including the nominated ones, no other media can do justice in terms of coverage.</p>
<p>Making the livestream available as a default provides the political and psychological countermeasure to an age of rising cynicism about mainstream media and ruling elites.</p>
<p>Those who worry they are being fed selective parts of the situation know where and how they can view things uncut and in real time. This is also a deterrent against misinformation.</p>
<p>The open contestation of ideas on the live broadcast is far better than any civics or political theory lessons can deliver on how our parliament works. </p>
<p>This direct process of communication can motivate a higher level of well-informed and even real-time citizen involvement in the enterprise of achieving progress for our nation.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Allowing two adults to divorce in mutual agreement is hardly radical or revolutionary </h1>
<div> <p>No-fault divorce is a welcome change amid changing ideas of marriage and gender roles, says SUSS sociologist Hu Shu.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Hu Shu </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Divorce by mutual consent was proposed as an amendment to the Women’s Charter for the first time in Singapore in 1979 but was removed before it could become law.</p>
<p>One reason cited then was “not (to) make it easy” to terminate marriage, such that there is “no incentive” to save it.</p>
<p>More than 40 years later, a no-fault option that allows couples to divorce by mutual agreement resurfaced in Parliament earlier this month. </p>
<p>It is a long-awaited and welcome change. No-fault divorce will reduce bitterness, pain and litigation costs on divorcing couples. </p>
<h2>RECOGNITION THAT REASONS FOR DIVORCE ARE DIVERSE</h2>
<p>Contrary to perceptions that the decision to divorce is ill-thought-out or that divorcees have not tried hard enough to make their marriage work, it often takes years - sometimes decades - for people to make up their minds to end the marriage. </p>
<p>A profile analysis of divorcing couples conducted by the Family and Juvenile Justice Centre of the Subordinate Courts in 2002 found that the 50 couples in the sample were married for an average length of 14.3 years.</p>
<p>Yet, half the sample noted problems in their marriage within the first four years. Wives recognised the existence of a marriage problem earlier than their husbands.</p>
<p>This speaks to the high regard for marriage in society, the remnant stigma attached to divorce and divorcees, and the fact that divorce is life-changing and requires long and careful consideration.</p>
<p>In her 2015 book Perspectives on Marital Dissolution, local sociologist Sharon Ee Ling Quah wrote about the experiences of 35 divorced Singaporeans.</p>
<p>These findings shed some light on the diverse reasons why people leave a marriage – and it’s worth mentioning they’re not always fault-based.</p>
<h2>STOP SAYING IT’LL MAKE DIVORCE TOO EASY</h2>
<p>Opponents continue to claim no-fault divorce will increase divorce rates by making it too easy to part ways. </p>
<p>But is this true? A look at the history of no-fault divorce in other countries may provide some answers. The best-researched divorce law reforms happened in the United States between the 1960s and 1980s.</p>
<p>The US saw a rapid increase in the divorce rate in the 1970s after a spate of reforms implementing mutual consent or unilateral no-fault divorce – that is, without the consent of their spouse.</p>
<p>But research showed less than 10 per cent of the rise in divorce was due to these legal changes and more specifically, to unilateral no-fault divorce. And this small effect is short-lived and can no longer be discerned after six to eight years.</p>
<p>Even without major changes to Singapore divorce laws in recent years, the number of divorces has been increasing since 1980 and then stabilising around 7,000 each year in the last 10 years.</p>
<p>In the short run, we may see an increase in the number of divorces. But as the pent-up demand for divorce is met, this trend will return to its normal level.</p>
<p>Another insight from research on the US divorce law reforms is that neither mutual consent nor unilateral no-fault divorce has had any effect on marriage rates.</p>
<h2>WOMEN INITIATE DIVORCE MORE THAN MEN</h2>
<p>Conventional thinking might hold that women, more than men, do not want to leave an unhappy marriage, since historically many women became full-time homemakers and therefore were less financially independent than their husbands. </p>
<p>Research has shown that, among women who are unhappy with their marriage, employed women are more able to leave.</p>
<p>Women initiate about two-thirds of divorces in Singapore. In fact, most divorces are wanted by wives not only in Singapore, but in many countries such as the US, United Kingdom, France, Australia, and China.</p>
<h2>TOWARDS AN EGALITARIAN PARTNERSHIP</h2>
<p>As modern ideals of love, marriage and individual fulfillment became widely accepted, couples typically enter a marriage with the expectation that it will bring happiness, emotional satisfaction, and personal growth. </p>
<p>With changing gender roles resulting from rising educational attainment and female labour force participation, women also increasingly expect an egalitarian partnership in financial contribution, emotional engagement, and household labour. </p>
<p>When a marriage ceases to satisfy these needs and expectations or even becomes harmful to one’s physical and mental health, divorce becomes rational and necessary. </p>
<p>No-fault divorce will not encourage divorce or discourage marriage, but it will make the divorce process less acrimonious for those who are already determined to end a counterproductive marriage. </p>
<p>If divorcing couples could part on more amicable terms, it would help them and their children to adapt and move on in life more quickly.</p>
<p>It benefits no one to drag out an unhappy marriage in a lengthy and agonising process of divorce. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> WP leadership knew about Raeesah Khan's 'untruth' a week after her original speech in August: Pritam Singh </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Cheryl Lin </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The Workers’ Party's (WP) leadership was made aware of the fact that Ms Raeesah Khan had lied about a sexual assault case a week after her original <a>speech in August</a>, said party chief Pritam Singh on Thursday (Dec 2).</p>
<p>Ms Khan also repeated the untruth in Parliament in October, despite being asked to clarify the matter, said Mr Singh.</p>
<p>Ms Khan <a>resigned from the party and as an MP</a> on Tuesday night, following her parliamentary admission on Nov 1 about lying in Parliament about accompanying a sexual assault victim to the police station.</p>
<p>The claim arose during her speech on a WP motion on empowering women on Aug 3, in which she alleged that the <a>case had been mishandled by the police</a>.</p>
<h2>TRUTH REVEALED A WEEK AFTER SPEECH</h2>
<p>In a press conference on Thursday, Mr Singh explained that after she first made her speech in August, he asked her to “make her best efforts to contact the victim or to contact the individuals” involved as authorities sought more details.</p>
<p>“Initially, Raeesah stuck to her untruth in her communication with me,” said Mr Singh.</p>
<p>She admitted this to party leadership about a week after she had delivered her speech, said Mr Singh, adding that she said these personal traumas explained why she had not been truthful about her account.</p>
<p>Specifically, himself, chair Sylvia Lim and vice-chair Faisal Manap had been informed about the lie.</p>
<p>Of “immediate concern” to Mr Singh was that Ms Khan had not previously informed her family members of her sexual assault, he said.</p>
<p>“In my judgment, it was important that she did so before she could fully address the reasons behind her untruthful conduct in Parliament, and to correct the record.</p>
<p>"In view of a sexual assault and my assessment of her state of mind, I was prepared to give her the space necessary to address the matter with her loved ones.”</p>
<p>After that, Ms Khan came down with shingles in September and did not attend Parliament.</p>
<p>“It was nonetheless made known to her before the parliamentary sitting in October, that any parliamentary clarification on this matter was hers to make in her capacity as an elected Member of Parliament.”</p>
<h2>MS KHAN REPEATED UNTRUTH</h2>
<p>“Almost immediately after Parliament adjourned in October, Raeesah agreed with the party leadership that she had to set the record right forthwith. I shared with her that it was the correct thing to do.</p>
<p>"The next earliest opportunity to do so in Parliament was on Nov 1, when the member made the personal explanation under the Standing Order 25."</p>
<p>He added that Ms Khan then sent her resignation letter to him on Nov 30.</p>
<p>When asked why the claim was allowed to remain uncorrected, Mr Singh said: “Each Workers’ Party MP is a leader in his or her own right. And if you have done something wrong, it is your responsibility to set the record right."</p>
<p>He added there was indeed a risk "the issue would be exacerbated" in not having it corrected sooner.</p>
<p>"But only Raeesah knew the truth of what she had said and what she had experienced, and it was for her to clarify that on the record. And I think that would have been only adequately communicated through her personally.”</p>
<p>He also added that he did not give her a “direct timeline” to correct herself.</p>
<p>“I suppose one could make an argument that it could have been faster but in my judgment, given where she was emotionally, I took the decision that she had to close that loop with her parents.”</p>
<p>But he added that as she was an MP of WP, the party had to take responsibility, and account to the public about what happened.</p>
<h2>SELECTING PARTY CANDIDATES</h2>
<p>When asked if there is a need to review the selection process for party candidates, Mr Singh said no process was "fail-proof".</p>
<p>The party makes its best efforts to select people who are committed to caring for residents, and who represent a wide spectrum of society, he said.</p>
<p>And in view of the "increasing diversity of the electorate, particularly the younger generation", the party must continue to consider people from all walks of life, said Mr Singh.</p>
<p>While the process has generally shown success, there will be some whose conduct is "inexplicable".</p>
<p>"The WP will undertake our best efforts to lower this prospect as best we can, while at the same time working to ensure that there's a diversity of candidates."</p>
<h2>TRUST IS FUNDAMENTAL TO PARTY ETHOS</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, he thanked Ms Khan for her contributions to the party, adding that correcting her error was "an honourable thing to do".</p>
<p>Mr Singh also apologised to the residents of Sengkang for the turn of events. "I also apologise to all victims of sexual assault, who’ve been hurt by this matter.”</p>
<p>He added that public trust and confidence in the WP is “fundamental” to the ethos of the party as “a rational, responsible and respectable institution in Singapore politics”.</p>
<p>“Singaporeans have the right to expect the best efforts from Workers' Party MPs, and we should never take their faith, trust and confidence in us for granted.”</p>
<p>Editor's note: This article was corrected on Dec 4 to accurately reflect the question which Mr Singh was responding to when he spoke about why Ms Khan didn't take heed of instructions. We apologise for the error.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Teen drug suspect who died after fall from height could have had 'far better future': Faishal Ibrahim </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aqil Haziq Mahmud </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The 17-year-old drug suspect who died from a fall from height three months after he was charged in court could have had a "far better future", Minister of State for Home Affairs Faishal Ibrahim told Parliament on Tuesday (Nov 2).</p>
<p>He was responding to questions by several Members of Parliament (MP) on law enforcement agencies' protocols when dealing with young suspects.</p>
<p>The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) said on Oct 22 that its investigations show the suspect was treated "professionally and fairly" during investigations, with "no mistreatment" during his time in lock-up.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Faishal said authorities have been putting out this message "quite a lot" and will have to continue doing so.</p>
<p>"So that parents, and persons who are arrested, understand the process. You have done wrong, but that does not have to be the final word," he said. "Our system is designed to give second chances, to help you rehabilitate. And many have succeeded."</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Faishal said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has <a>changed its laws on dealing with pure drug abusers</a> to not treat them as criminals. Instead, the focus is on getting them to change their drug habit.</p>
<p>"We bring in the family, into these efforts as well. Because without adequate family support, it is difficult to help the young person."</p>
<h2>DECISION ON EXPANDING APPROPRIATE ADULT SCHEME SOON</h2>
<p>One point that Ms Ow brought up was why Justin was not accompanied by a "trusted adult" during the interviews.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Faishal reiterated that the Appropriate Adult Scheme for Young Suspects (AAYS), where a trained adult accompanies young suspects during law enforcement interviews, applies to suspects below the age of 16.</p>
<p>However, he noted that some MPs have asked if the scheme could be extended to suspects who are 16 and 17 years old. This will be reviewed, he said.</p>
<p>"We will announce our decision in the next few months, as to whether we can extend the AAYS to persons who are 16 and 17 years old."</p>
<p>MP Sylvia Lim (WP-Aljunied), who said Justin was her resident, then pointed out that the Children and Young Persons Act was amended in 2019 to <a>raise the age of a young person</a> from 16 to 18.</p>
<p>She asked if the MHA would agree to align its legal or procedural protections as such.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Faishal replied that the ministry would first need to double its pool of volunteers to cover additional young suspects aged 16 and 17, and listed several constraints in doing this. The AAYS currently has 331 volunteers.</p>
<p>"And during this current pandemic, they are constrained on conducting face-to-face training due to the safe distancing measures, hence it's not easy to ramp up the pool of the appropriate adults quickly."</p>
<p>If the scheme was expanded without enough volunteers, the minister said interviews could be delayed until an appropriate adult was available, adding "more strain" on the suspect being investigated.</p>
<h2>YOUNG SUSPECTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS</h2>
<p>Assoc Prof Faishal also touched on CNB's protocols when conducting drug-related investigations involving young persons with a history of medical or mental health conditions.</p>
<p>If officers know that the suspect has medical or mental health conditions and would require special attention, they contact the parents or school first, if operationally feasible, before bringing the suspect in for investigations, he said.</p>
<p>"If the person is observed to be capable of being interviewed, the officers will carry on with the interview. The point is that they will use their discretion, based on their observations," Assoc Prof Faishal said.</p>
<p>The minister said the Home Team has worked with Agency for Integrated Care to increase officers’ awareness of mental health conditions and help them identify and respond to persons observed to have mental health issues.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Faishal said CNB officers also undergo refresher training with case studies involving recorded interviews on how to handle young suspects and those with mental disabilities, and are required to pass an annual proficiency test.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the minister pointed to a separate Appropriate Adults Scheme for Persons with Mental Disabilities, which currently has 320 volunteers.</p>
<p>"Even if the person doesn't ask (for the scheme), and we feel that it helps in an investigation process, we will activate it and we want to make sure that the person has a fair process as part of the investigation," he said.</p>
<h2>16 PER CENT OF ARRESTED PERSONS BELOW 18 PROSECUTED</h2>
<p>Ultimately, Assoc Prof Faishal said that out of 9,485 persons under 18 years old arrested from 2016 to 2020, only 16 per cent were prosecuted. Justin's case falls in this minority as he was "openly trafficking", he said.</p>
<p>"The general approach when dealing with young suspects is to, where possible, avoid criminalising their conduct, give them a second chance, and help them in their rehabilitation," he said.</p>
<p>Suitable youths who have been arrested for minor offences can be referred to diversionary programmes that have a strong focus on counselling and rehabilitation, the minister said.</p>
<p>"Placing youth offenders on diversionary programmes allows them to be accountable for their actions and prevents disruption in other areas of development, such as education," he added.</p>
<p>"Justin will also have been placed on such processes after sentencing if he had been found guilty."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Changes to CPF Act passed to streamline retirement payouts, simplify top-ups </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: A Central Provident Fund (Amendment) Bill was passed in Parliament on Tuesday (Nov 2) to simplify some procedures for receiving retirement payouts and for topping up CPF accounts.</p>
<p>With the change, the CPF Board will automatically disburse OA and SA savings to members when they have used up their RA savings “to ensure no disruption to their payouts”. </p>
<p>This will affect 83,000 members when it starts in the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>Separately, for about 75,000 CPF members who are currently receiving CPF LIFE payouts, they need to apply to add any inflows to their Retirement Account to their LIFE payouts. This will be automated this month.</p>
<p>Dr Tan emphasised in Parliament on Monday that there are no changes to the rules for lump sum withdrawals of CPF savings.</p>
<p>The CPF Board said it will also simplify rules to top up the Retirement Sum and MediSave Accounts, with changes to apply from Jan 1 next year.</p>
<p>Two main changes are to the tax reliefs provided and to voluntary contributions to MediSave.</p>
<p>Currently, tax reliefs for voluntary top-ups to the retirement sum are given to the person who tops up while tax reliefs for top-ups to MediSave are given to the recipient.</p>
<p>To “align the rules” for both schemes, tax relief will be provided to the giver who tops up the account, for MediSave as well, from next year.</p>
