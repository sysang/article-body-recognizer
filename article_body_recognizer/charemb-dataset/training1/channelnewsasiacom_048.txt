<div> <section> <div> <p> Entertainment </p> <h1> Korean actors Park Shin-hye and Choi Tae-joon to marry after 4 years of dating </h1> <div> <p>Both stars also shared the news that they are expecting a baby. </p> </div> </div> </section> </div>
<p>South Korean TV stars Park Shin-hye and Choi Tae-joon, who have been dating since 2017, are getting married.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old Park, best known for her roles in dramas like Doctors, The Heirs, Memories Of The Alhambra and You're Beautiful, is also pregnant, according to local news reports.</p>
<p>"I'm getting married with the person I've been in a relationship with for a long time. He has been a source of support to me and embraced all of my shortcomings, and I would like to begin life as a married couple with him.</p>
<p>"Although I am very cautious to say this as it is still early, I was blessed with a baby. I wanted to tell you before everyone else," she wrote.</p>
<p>Choi, who is 30 years old, also wrote to his fans to confirm the union and the pregnancy.</p>
<p>The wedding is reportedly taking place in Seoul in January next year. </p>

<h1> Three celebrity weddings to take place in the coming weeks </h1>
<div> <div> <a> May Seah </a> </div> </div>
<p>There has been a lot of celebrity wedding news lately, and whether that has anything to do with the pandemic causing people to take stock of their lives is something we can't comment on.</p>
<p>What we can do, though, is give our heartiest congratulations to James Seah and Kayly.</p>
<p>Yes, the two actors will be officially walking down the aisle, although not with each other, in case you were wondering.</p>
<div> <div><p>Kayly – the artiste formerly known as Kayly Loh – who got engaged last year, will be getting married this month. She connected with her fiance, a commercial director, through their common love of off-road vehicles.</p></div> </div>
<div><p>The wedding will be an intimate affair with just their closest friends and family.</p> <p>The 33-year-old winner of Channel 5's The 5 Search happens to also run a bridal flower studio, so we guess the wedding flowers are settled.</p></div>
<div> <div> <div><p>As for Seah, 30, he's set to wed influencer Nicole Chang Min, 28, on Jan 15 after a two-year engagement (they got their BTO flat in mid-2019, so we guess it was a done deal).</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>In more celebrity wedding news, singers Suthasini and Vishnu registered their marriage on Dec 5 in the presence of close friends and family.</p>
<p>The two Vasantham personalities, who made the surprise reveal earlier this year that they had been dating in secret, even shot their own playful music video to celebrate the occasion.</p>
<p>There'll be a traditional wedding ceremony to come, which means more beautiful outfits and happy celebrations. </p>
<p>We look forward to lots of lovely wedding photos in the weeks to come. Who else is putting their money on Kayly's golden retriever being the ring bearer?</p>

<h1> Actor Desmond Tan shares more details about his wedding and proposal </h1>
<div> <p>He wrote his bride a song and serenaded her at a private ceremony in Southern France. Now that's what we call a destination wedding. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Serene Seow </a> </div> </div>
<p>Well wishes from the celebrity set have been pouring in since.</p>
<p>Actress Zoe Tay responded to the good news with a heartfelt congratulatory post, in which she wrote, “Our Prince is married. Congratulations. Wishing you marital bliss, and hope you have kids soon.”</p>
<p>Sharon Au, who knows the bride, wrote: “You know what I am going to do when I see you! Scream! @thedesmondtan yesh yesh yesh! I love her since 2015!”</p>
<p>Michelle Chong also chimed in: “Congrats! That’s one super eligible bachelor off the shelf!”</p>
<p>In a WhatsApp interview with 8 Days, the 35-year-old actor shared details on how this “surprise” wedding wasn’t exactly a surprise. </p>
<p>“I proposed to her five years ago in a National Park in the USA. It was a quiet winter morning. With the snowy mountains as our backdrop, I got down on one knee and popped the question. I was so nervous. Thankfully, she said, 'Yes!'"</p>
<p>So when the Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) to France opened up in October, Tan took the opportunity to plan their dream wedding there. </p>
<p>Tan planned “an intimate and simple” wedding at a French chateau in Southern France in the presence of 15 of their closest friends. After exchanging their vows, Tan surprised his bride with a wedding song he wrote for her.</p>
<p>“It has been a long wait for us to finally fulfil this dream. We are both immensely happy and felt so blessed during the wedding, we had tears of joy many times.”</p>
<p>The actor also shared that there are no plans to hold a wedding banquet in Singapore given the uncertainties of COVID-19 and that the couple already held a reception with their families in November.</p>
<p>The question that is hot on everyone’s lips: Who exactly is Mrs Tan? “I kept it private because I respect my partner’s privacy. I am very thankful for her patience and after a long engagement, I’m so blessed to call her my wife.”</p>

<h1> Mediacorp actor Desmond Tan marries his university sweetheart of 12 years </h1>
<div> <p>Surprise! The couple held an intimate wedding reception in Singapore last month, before heading to France for their fairytale castle wedding and honeymoon.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Serene Seow </a> </div> </div>
<p>As it turns out, France was just the second part. “We held an intimate wedding reception in Singapore with our families last month to share the precious moments they have been waiting for a long time.” Tan told CNA Lifestyle. </p>
<p> “We just got married a few days back in the presence of some very close friends in France,” he said, adding that the ceremony was held “in a beautiful chateau in Southern France.”</p>
<p>As for their honeymoon, “over the weekend we have been on a road trip… to visit beautiful, historical (places). We will be travelling around France for one more week.”</p>
<p>This comes at the heels of another high-profile celebrity announcement, when fellow Mediacorp actress Rebecca Lim announced her engagement in November, after less than a year of dating.</p>
<p>On the family front, it’s an open secret that the actor wants a big family. “I really love kids. Ideally, (I’d like to have) three kids. I've always thought it's a good number. It's a big family but not too big.” </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>It sounds like it won’t be long before the actor’s paw children, Hoshi and Udon, can expect some siblings?</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p> <a> Entertainment </a> </p> <h5> Rebecca Lim's mystery fiancé revealed </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> Entertainment </p> <h1> Rebecca Lim's mystery fiancé revealed </h1> <div> <p>Other than his future bride, Matthew Webster is also passionate about cars and music.</p> </div> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>In a post on Sunday (Nov 21) evening, Lim wrote: "We are humbled and grateful for the overwhelming love and support shown towards us, and for your heartfelt well wishes. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts."</p>
<p>The post was accompanied by a photo of a teary-eyed Lim and her husband-to-be, Matthew Webster, at their engagement event. His identity was confirmed via independent checks by CNA Lifestyle.</p>
<p>Previous photos of the event offered only obscure shots of 35-year-old Webster, but the latest post showed his side profile, after Lim told CNA Lifestyle she "definitely would want" to reveal who he was to the world. </p>
<p>"I said to him: 'I would really want everyone to know who you are because I'm proud to have you as my other half and really want to share my joy with everyone who's been so happy for me'," she told CNA Lifestyle last week.</p>
<p>Lim, who is also 35, first uploaded photos of her proposal to Instagram on Nov 15. The proposal, which happened three days earlier, was a lively event complete with white and silver balloons, and marquee lights spelling out the phrase "Marry me". </p>
<p>The couple first met at a friend's place earlier this year.</p>
<p>Not much is publicly known about Webster, who is described by Lim as "very private". But his LinkedIn page shows he is an Assistant Vice President at PSA Singapore and is a Monash University journalism graduate.</p>
<p>He also has two Instagram accounts. One is dedicated to his music – Webster is a drummer and guitarist – and another is dedicated to his Porsche 911.</p>

<h1> Rebecca Lim reveals more about her fiance, proposal and wedding plans, including how he got along with grandma </h1>
<div> <div> <a> May Seah </a> </div> </div>
<p>In the two days since actress Rebecca Lim officially announced her engagement to a mystery man, she’s been inundated with well wishes.</p>
<p>Even her secondary school principal called her “crying, saying she’s very happy for me”, she told CNA Lifestyle.</p>
<p>“Over the past few days, I’ve been so touched by the love and congratulatory messages from everyone that I’ve teared up a couple of times. And it’s difficult to make me tear!”</p>
<p>Lim, 35, previously kept all her romantic relationships strictly under wraps – until Nov 15, when she posted a photo of the big proposal.</p>
<p>Her husband-to-be, also 35, isn’t in entertainment – in fact, when they met, he had no idea she was a celebrity – and instead has a career in corporate branding. </p>
<p>Lim, a self-professed homebody, had often remarked in interviews that in her line of work, it was difficult to meet people.</p>
<p>“I was actually resigned to the fact that I would most probably be a spinster, just living with my grandma forever,” she said, with a chuckle.</p>
<p>She moved in with her grandmother late last year when her grandfather became ill, was hospitalised and subsequently died – even sleeping in the same bed for company.</p>
<p>“That was my plan – to just spend time with her," Lim said. “So, when he came along, my relatives joked, ‘Now grandma needs a bigger bed!’”</p>
<p>“To be honest, we didn’t have a honeymoon period because it was just honesty from the start, and if it didn’t work, it didn’t work, and we’d have to move on. But, thankfully, it did.”</p>
<p>The elaborate proposal was “not exactly out-of-character, but unexpected”, because the two of them are usually quite low-key.</p>
<p>“I called my sister immediately. I said, ‘I think he’s going to propose.’ She was like, ‘Oh, wow. But he hasn’t asked mum yet.’ I was like, ‘Okay, I guess the restaurant's just very formal.’”</p>
<p>It turned out that her sister – and her entire family – had been conspiring with him to surprise her for over two weeks. “Everyone knew he was going to propose except me,” she laughed.</p>
<p>Both she and her fiance have been touched and overwhelmed by the outpouring of congratulations and love, she said, “not just from close friends and family but Singaporeans who have also grown up with me”. It has been “extremely surreal”.</p>
<p>But some of his friends, she thinks, still have no idea who she is (even if it’s all over the news).</p>
<p>Did he really not know who she was when her face is plastered all over billboards and buses, not to mention in television and movies? we questioned.</p>
<p>“Initially, when he said that, I did not really believe him, but then after getting to know him, he’s not really acquainted with local entertainment. Nor are his friends and parents,” she said.</p>
<p>Their first meeting was at a restaurant over dinner with some of his friends. “None of them knew who I was until the waitress wanted to take pictures,” she recounted. “Then they were like, ‘What’s going on?'”</p>
<p>For now, the couple have agreed that his identity should remain unknown since he’s not a public figure like she is – at least until he’s “slowly assimilated” into her world.</p>
<p>“I said to him, ‘I would really want everyone to know who you are because I’m proud to have you as my other half and really want to share my joy with everyone who’s been so happy for me,’” she told us.</p>
<p>“But as I’ve been so overwhelmed the past couple of days, and so is he, I’m just slowly introducing him into my world. I definitely would want to (reveal who he is) but, one step at a time.”</p>
<p>One thing she did reveal to us is that he loves dogs, just like she does, and has three of his own.</p>
<p>And, yes, they have had the talk about how she has to do intimate scenes with other actors in her line of work. “I guess I’m thankful that he doesn’t watch my shows!” she quipped.</p>
<p>And what about the reports that her rumoured ex, actor Ian Fang, made some now-deleted, <a>cryptic, emo posts on social media</a>? (Lim and Fang always denied the rumours, saying they were just good friends.)</p>
<p>Although there’s uncertainty about when and where, the wedding will “definitely” take place next year, she said.</p>
<p>In fact, “I was the one who said, ‘Why don’t we just get married ASAP?’ He was the one who said, ‘There are a lot of things to plan.’ I’m not a planner. I’m just go-with-the-flow”, she said.</p>
<p>And finally, the “auntie” question: Does she think she might want to have kids?</p>
<p>For now, “I just feel so blessed and overjoyed”.</p>

<h1> IN FOCUS: From determined teen to badminton world champion - Loh Kean Yew's journey to the top </h1>
<p>While Loh Kean Yew's victory in badminton's World Championships took some people by surprise, those close to him say his talent and determination have always shone through. CNA spoke to his family and coaches about his path to sporting glory.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Matthew Mohan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: While his exhausted peers were stretching after a long, hard training session, a shy, skinny, sweaty teenager wasn’t done just yet.</p>
<p>Instead, Loh Kean Yew would cajole a teammate or two back on to the badminton court as he ironed out aspects of his game.</p>
<p>Whatever his coach had pointed out previously, he would work on. Rest could wait, improvement could not.</p>
<p>“He would call a friend along and say: ‘Hey, help me. After that I will also help you.’ After every training session, he will do it. That’s where you could see that the desire to want to improve was there," he said.</p>
<p>“When he makes the extra effort, he knows what he is doing through the extra effort.”</p>
<p>It is this spirit of dedication and determination that those who know Kean Yew, Singapore's <a>newly-crowned world champion</a>, say sets him apart from others.</p>
<p>“Talent is not enough. You have to go the distance,” said Tan. “He has the talent, but the difference between him and others is the commitment he has.”</p>
<p>At the age of 13, Kean Yew moved away from his family in Malaysia and took up a scholarship from the Singapore Sports School. </p>
<p>"The first two weeks were very fun because there were no parents," he told CNA in 2019. "But I missed home - I cried by myself for a few nights before calling my mum and crying some more.</p>
<p>"But after that night where I let my emotions out, I stopped crying and calling - until my mum had to call me!"</p>
<p>Part of Tan’s role was to help foreign students at the academy assimilate and he was aware of Kean Yew’s struggles through the transition.</p>
<p>“He didn’t have any friends (at first), he was lonely and didn’t know a single person in the school and the rigour of the education system would get to him,” explained Tan. “He had it very tough.”</p>
<p>But Kean Yew would eventually settle down and make friends, said Tan, as his easy going personality meant that he would get along well with teammates, who were also student athletes.</p>
<p>“All of them (at the academy) had a common goal, which was to chase their sporting dreams,” said Tan. “That bonded all of them together because they were all chasing for the same thing.”</p>
<p>And in particular, there was one thing that always seemed to bring a smile to Kean Yew’s face - playing badminton.</p>
<p>“When he first came (to Singapore Sports School), his happiest times would be at the badminton hall, because that was something that he was most comfortable with … Every time he holds the racquet, he is always happy,” said Tan.</p>
<p>“It was very obvious. And after a while when he settled down, you could always see his desire to improve.”</p>
<p>And even in his teenage years, Kean Yew always relished a challenge, noted Tan. </p>
<p>In the spirit of friendly competition, there were always those who wanted to take him on and Kean Yew always was up for it.</p>
<p>“The older boys would want to play with him … they would always be challenging him like (short games of) five points, seven points,” said Tan. “He knew that he would lose for sure, but he took it in his stride … He just took it as a challenge.”</p>
<p>And very early on, it was clear to Kean Hean that his brother had the skills needed to play at the highest level.</p>
<p>“He has the quality, not just physically but in terms of skill … He is different from me. He knows what he wants and he is more disciplined in his attitude and his lifestyle,” he explained.</p>
<p>“For him to be mature in an environment where our parents were not with us most of the time was not easy. It requires a lot of mature thinking and decision making.”</p>
<p>Kean Yew always had his own way of thinking, said Kean Hean, who is also a national badminton player for Singapore, with several SEA Games medals to his name.</p>
<p>After completing his studies at Singapore Sports School, Kean Yew went on to further his education at Republic Polytechnic. But it was then he decided that he would need to quit school to focus on badminton full-time.</p>
<p>"Initially, we were shocked that he came to this decision, but after he explained to us (we understood) that he was mature enough and believed and trusted that he could do it," Kean Yew’s mother Mdm Grace Gan told CNA in an interview this week.</p>
<p>"He was such a good boy who was disciplined and knew what he wanted to do, so we just trusted him and supported him all the way.”</p>
<p>National singles coach Kelvin Ho first met Kean Yew when he was a national youth coach about ten years ago. Then, the youngster was still a Singapore Sports School student but training with the national youth team.</p>
<p>“His training attitude was marvelous … he was quite special,” recalled Ho. “The hunger to win (was there).”</p>
<p>And while many youngsters shared the competitive fervour, Kean Yew pushed harder. </p>
<p>“Others wanted to win but he wanted to win even more. He would dare to challenge the seniors and would ask the seniors for sparring while some of the other kids might have seen seniors and been scared.”</p>
<p>Having been a part of Kean Yew’s journey for almost ten years, Ho has had a front-row seat to witness his growth as a player.</p>
<p>“He has become more stable … in his thinking. And when you are clearer on the court, you become better,” he added.</p>
<p>This change was observable after Kean Yew clinched a bronze medal in his debut 2015 SEA Games.</p>
<p>“He played the senior players there while he was still quite young. You could see that … he was daring to challenge them and execute his game well," Ho explained.</p>
<p>"He wouldn’t be scared by the situation, in fact he would challenge it.”</p>
<p>And his gung-ho spirit was clearly clear when he trained, said Ho.</p>
<p>"For example, (for a drill involving) 20 shuttlecocks, others might be tired after 14 and slow down. But the more tired he is, he would push."</p>
<p>For Singapore Badminton Association (SBA) technical director Martin Andrew, there has been no question that Kean Yew has the ability to play with the world’s best.</p>
<p>This was showcased at this year’s Tokyo Olympics where the Singaporean stretched then world number 7 Jonatan Christie, he said. Kean Yew, who was then 42nd in the world, went down 20-22, 21-13, 18-21 in a closely fought match.</p>
<p>“There were parts ... of that match which were absolutely high level from Kean Yew. So the challenge was how we could get that on a more consistent basis,” Andrew explained.</p>
<p>With a training stint with world number one Victor Axelsen under his belt, time spent competing in various competitions, and guidance from SBA coaches, Kean Yew began to sustain consistent performances in matches after the Olympics.</p>
<p>Next up, he needed to be consistent - not just in one tournament, but across many competitions.</p>
<p>This was displayed in his win at the Hylo Open in October, a top 16 finish in the Indonesia Masters in November, and a second-place spot at the Indonesia Open in the same month.</p>
<p>Going into the World Championships, the pressure was off for Kean Yew, his brother said.</p>
<p>“I had the expectation of him going on (an early holiday) instead of being champion. After all, it was still Viktor and his standard is there,” said Kean Hean, with a laugh.</p>
<p>However, he knew that Kean Yew had a chance and would give it his all.</p>
<p>“(But while) we didn’t know if he (Kean Yew) was going to win or lose, we knew he was going to put up a good fight.”</p>
<p>And his brother upset the odds and the Olympic champion.</p>
<p>After wins against Austria's Luka Wraber, Thailand's Kantaphon Wangcharoen and India's HS Prannoy, Kean Yew beat world number three Anders Antonsen to book his spot in the men's singles final and seal his place in the history books.</p>
<p>Then came the thrilling triumph in the final where he overcame the experienced veteran Srikanth Kidambi.</p>
<p>“The two benchmark players for men’s singles … are Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei. If you look at Kean Yew, he’s got a lot of the strengths of both put in together,” said Martin Andrew.</p>
<p>He also pointed out that Kean Yew’s confidence has soared since the Olympics.</p>
<p>“He’s walking onto the court with a real belief that he can play badminton at a high level … He believes that he can challenge anybody else.”</p>
<p>However, Kean Yew is far from the finished product, Andrew emphasised.</p>
<p>“He’s still got some development to do. (But) I personally have him in my mind, right up there with the very best in the world at the present time,” said the SBA technical director.</p>
<p>“He has the weapons, and he has the development within him still to absolutely make a massive impact on the game.”</p>
<p>Ho's belief in Kean Yew is evident. Along with coach Mulyo Handoyo, Ho is an integral part of Kean Yew's coaching set-up.</p>
<p>In a 2019 interview with CNA, Ho noted that Kean Yew along with Singapore's top women's singles player Yeo Jia Min had the potential to be "world class".</p>
<p>"In terms of his ability, his fighting spirit, his never-give-up attitude, you can see that he can match the top players," Ho explained. </p>
<p>BRINGING OTHERS ON THE JOURNEY</p>
<p>While the journey to the top is lonely, Kean Yew is and has always been a team player, said Tan.</p>
<p>“He really brought positive energy to people when he was at the academy," he explained. “He not only wants to win but to bring people along in the journey with him and to show this is what it takes.”</p>
<p>This was no better exemplified through a text message which Kean Yew sent to Tan the night before the victory over Chinese badminton legend Lin Dan that first catapulted his name into Singapore's collective consciousness.</p>
<p>Before that 2019 Thailand Open final match, Kean Yew wanted to encourage those in the SBA’s National Intermediate Squad.</p>
<p>He wanted them to dream bigger.</p>
<p>“Set a goal, big enough for people to laugh at. They laugh because it’s impossible for them. They’re the weakling, not you. Work hard towards it,” he said.</p>
<p>“I really must add that the key word is discipline. It is a word that should be applied in everything you do, be it training, studies, time management etc. </p>
<p>“Discipline is not something that should be reflected only in badminton. Discipline should be applied in every aspect of your life. This truly reflects the character of a true champion.”</p>
<p>Fast forward two years, and Kean Yew has followed his own advice and has become just that. </p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Four Team Singapore athletes circled around the city aboard an <a>open-top bus</a> on Sunday (Dec 26) to celebrate their victories in 2021.</p>
<p>Pool player Aloysius Yap, badminton player Loh Kean Yew, bowler Shayna Ng and para-swimmer Yip Pin Xiu could be seen waving to the festive weekend crowds.</p>
<div><p>Their bus departed from the Singapore Sports Hub and drove through Marina Bay Sands, Chinatown, Clarke Quay, Orchard Road and Dhoby Ghaut.</p> <p>It then continued to Bugis Junction and Suntec City, before returning to Sports Hub.</p></div>
<p>The parade was held to "celebrate their successes with fellow Singaporeans", said Sport Singapore, capping off a "challenging year for many athletes" who had to train and compete amid the COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>Aloysius Yapp was the first Singaporean to reach world number 1 in the World Pool-Billiard Association rankings. </p>
<p>Loh Kean Yew, who won a gold medal at the Badminton World Federation (BWF) World Championships, was the <a>first Singaporean to clinch the prestigious world title</a>. </p>
<p>Shayna Ng won a gold medal at the <a>women's singles event</a> at the International Bowling Federation Super World Championships in November, defeating compatriot Cherie Tan in the final.</p>
<p>Yip Pin Xiu added to her Paralympic haul with <a>two gold medals</a> at the Tokyo Games in September, taking her total to five gold and one silver, dating back to the 2008 Beijing Paralympics.</p>
<p>The parade was held by the Singapore Sport Institute, in collaboration with Cuesports Singapore, Singapore Badminton Association, Singapore Bowling Federation and the Singapore Disability Sports Council. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> China plans for Beijing Olympic bubble with no holes or hugs </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BEIJING: February's Beijing Winter Olympics look set to be the strictest mass sporting event since the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>AFP Sport looks at what measures athletes and others can expect to face in the "bubble" and how that compares to last summer's virus-delayed Tokyo Games.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS THE 'CLOSED LOOP'?</h2>
<p>China, where the virus emerged towards the end of 2019, has pursued a "zero-COVID" strategy and is taking the same no-nonsense approach to the Feb 4 to 20 Olympics.</p>
<p>Organisers hope to limit the spread of infections and keep the Games running smoothly by cocooning almost every person involved in a "closed loop", effectively a big bubble containing thousands of people.</p>
<p>They will be in there from the moment that they land in the Chinese capital to the time they leave.</p>
<p>Unlike Tokyo, where for example media were able to leave the bubble after two weeks and venture into public, nobody will be able to leave the "closed loop" for the duration of the Beijing Games.</p>
<p>That includes for sleeping, eating and travel between the three Games areas, which are as far as 180km apart.</p>
<p>For example, people in the "closed loop" using high-speed railway between the Olympic zones will be kept in a separate train carriage.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone. In Tokyo, athletes remained in a bubble but there was more flexibility for others involved in the Games, such as the army of volunteers who are central to any Olympics.</p>
<p>Tokyo was a bubble - but it had holes in it.</p>
<p>But in Beijing, athletes, media, volunteers, cleaners, cooks and coach drivers will all be in the bubble. Organisers have not said how many people that will be, but there will be nearly 3,000 athletes for starters.</p>
<p>Whereas the Tokyo Olympics took place in front of mostly empty arenas, there will be crowds in Beijing, but spectator numbers look likely to be limited.</p>
<p>Fans will not be in the "closed loop" so organisers will somehow need to ensure that they do not mingle with athletes and others inside the bubble.</p>
<p>For people living in China, they will need to quarantine after they exit the bubble.</p>
<p>Unlike Tokyo, everyone must be fully vaccinated or they will have to do 21 days' quarantine when they touch down in China.</p>
<p>Organisers are not insisting that people have booster shots, but the International Olympic Committee says it is "strongly encouraged".</p>
<p>People have also been told to minimise social interactions "such as hugs, high-fives and handshakes", the IOC says.</p>
<p>Beijing organisers have made clear that people who do not follow the rules could be kicked out of the Games.</p>
<p>Diplomats in the Chinese capital have told AFP that the bubble looks like it could be so impregnable that they worry they will not be offer to offer proper help to people inside.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h5> Intel apologises over letter addressing US sanctions on Xinjiang </h5> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Intel apologises over letter addressing US sanctions on Xinjiang </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>NEW YORK: Intel found itself on the back foot in Washington and Beijing on Thursday (Dec 23) after issuing a public apology over a letter to its suppliers referencing United States sanctions targeting human rights abuses in China's Xinjiang region.</p>
<p>The conflict follows <a>passage of a US law</a> that bans virtually all imports from Xinjiang in response to concerns over the use of forced labour and other human rights abuses against an ethnic minority.</p>
<p>The semiconductor giant told suppliers earlier this month to avoid any products from the region in order to comply with the restrictions.</p>
<p>But following <a>public outcry in China</a>, the chipmaker on Thursday expressed regret for the comments in a statement posted on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform.</p>
<p>"Our original intention was to ensure compliance with American laws," Intel said. "We apologise for the trouble caused to our respected Chinese customers, partners and the public."</p>
<p>President Joe Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law on Thursday, and Intel's apology drew a sceptical response from the White House.</p>
<p>"We believe the private sector and the international community should oppose the PRC's weaponising of its markets to stifle support for human rights," said White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki.</p>
<p>"We also think that American companies should never feel the need to apologise for standing up for fundamental human rights or opposing repression."</p>
<p>A statement from Intel's US staff made clear that the company would follow US law.</p>
<p>"On Dec 23 we issued a statement in China to address concerns raised by our stakeholders there regarding how we communicated certain legal requirements and policies with our global supplier network," Intel said.</p>
<p>"We will continue to ensure that our global sourcing complies with applicable laws and regulations in the US and in other jurisdictions where we operate."</p>
<p>The pressure on Intel comes as US companies grapple with the new sanctions, which ban the import of all goods from the region unless companies offer verifiable proof that production did not involve forced labour.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h5> China's offshore listing rules should reduce market uncertainty </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> China's offshore listing rules should reduce market uncertainty </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>HONG KONG: China's plan to tighten scrutiny over mainland companies' offshore share sales should help reduce the regulatory uncertainty that roiled financial markets this year and stalled offshore listings, according to bankers and analysts.</p>
<p>The China Securities and Regulatory Commission (CSRC) published draft rules late on Friday (Dec 24) requiring filings by companies seeking offshore listings under a framework to ensure they comply with Chinese laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Companies using a so-called variable interest entity (VIE) structure will still be allowed to seek offshore listings as long as they are compliant.</p>
<p>The rules remove uncertainty for investors who had feared that authorities would block offshore listings of VIE-structured companies to plug a regulatory loophole.</p>
<p>VIE is a structure adopted by most overseas-listed Chinese tech companies, such as Alibaba and JD.com, to skirt Chinese restrictions on foreign investment in certain sectors.</p>
<p>Companies and investors should feel reassured that the filing-based system will also involve close coordination between CSRC and various industry regulators, such as the cyberspace watchdog.</p>
<p>"The issuance of the draft rules shows that major communication obstacles have been removed between different regulatory bodies," said Ming Jin, managing partner at Chinese boutique investment bank Cygnus Equity.</p>
<p>"Now we will see how regulators are going to execute it and how US regulators will react."</p>
<p>Reaction to the new rules will be seen on Monday when the US stock market resumes trading after the Christmas holiday, which included Friday. Hong Kong stocks will resume trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Overall, it is a good sign that more clarity has been given," said a banker at a Wall Street firm in Hong Kong who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to media.</p>
<p>The success of the rules would depend on their implementation, he said.</p>
<p>Winston Ma, adjunct professor at NYU Law School, said that the issue of cross-border data security had become critical in the global digital economy and was a main driver for the new rules.</p>
<p>"As such, under the proposed new rule, cybersecurity review must be completed before the CSRC clearance process," Ma said.</p>
<p>Uncertainty over the future of VIE structures coupled with regulatory crackdowns in a number of major sectors in China had dampened the value of listings of mainland firms in offshore markets.</p>
<p>Chinese firms raised US$12.8 billion in the United States but the value of deals ground to a halt after Didi Global's listing in July that prompted a major regulatory backlash from officials.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, the value of IPOs in 2021 fell from US$32.1 billion to US$26.7 billion, according to Refinitiv data.</p>
<p>A public consultation on the draft rules will remain open until Jan 23. </p>

<p>COP26, net zero, carbon neutrality – these are catchphrases often associated with the climate change movement. </p>
<a>floods in Bangalore</a> to the
<a>sinking of Indonesia’s small islands</a>, one can’t help but wonder when Singapore, a low-lying island, will likewise experience the worst of climate change.
<p>As global leaders race to resolve climate issues while keeping pace with progress, they are presented with a catch-22 – often times, the quickest and easiest means to economic development is also the most detrimental to our environment. </p>
<a>Climate Trailblazers</a>, tells the stories of awe-inspiring efforts to create innovative products and solutions that are good for business, and even better for the planet.
<p>MAKING MEALS OUT OF THIN AIR</p>
<p>Whether you live to eat or eat to live, we all need food to survive. </p>
<p>While alternative proteins like plant-based or cell-based meat with a lower environmental footprint are taking off, the idea of food with a negative carbon footprint sounds like a concept right out of a sci-fi novel. </p>
<p>The production of Solein is not merely carbon-lite – it is carbon-negative. By freeing up lands earmarked for agriculture, these areas can continue to serve as carbon sinks to slow down the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. </p>
<p>Even the electricity used to power the process comes from renewable sources such as wind and solar power, while carbon dioxide can be obtained entirely from the air in an occupied room. </p>
<p>With its technology, co-founder and chief executive officer of Solar Foods Pasi Vainikka believes that food can be produced just about anywhere. </p>
<p>“It doesn’t end there,” he said. “We can eventually produce Solein in urban settings because each one of us breathes out about 1kg of carbon dioxide every day, which can be captured from buildings and put back into food.”</p>
<p>The production of Solein is just a breath away from reality. With Solar Foods’ first test facility due to be completed in 2023, that free lunch might just be around the corner, after all.</p>
<p>POWERING AIRPLANES, ONE LEFTOVER AT A TIME</p>
<p>While food fuels the human body, energy sustains the heartbeat of modern society.</p>
<p>The energy challenge we face today is two-fold: We need to meet the energy needs of a growing global population while minimising the environmental impact of its production. </p>
<p>Looking ahead in 2022, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, Temasek and SIA will begin <a>a year-long pilot programme for SAF</a> at Changi Airport. </p>
<p>ONE MAN’S TRASH IS ANOTHER MAN’S TREASURE </p>
<a>A growth in affluence</a> has resulted in an increase in material consumption, while the prevalence of
<a>ultra-fast fashion</a> has exacerbated the problem, with 80 per cent of clothes ending up in landfills.
<p>In the wake of such trends, enterprises such as LanzaTech are advocating a circular economy approach to clothing manufacturing, using waste carbon as a resource. </p>
<p>Indeed, the shift from using fresh fossil fuel to waste materials is a climate-forward solution that has huge potential to reshape the way clothes are produced. </p>
<p>“That’s what we’re trying to show, that there is a future where we can decouple our fossil life from our everyday life,” said Ms Holmgren. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> Japan's greenhouse gas emissions drop to record low in year to March 2021 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TOKYO: Japan's greenhouse gas emissions dropped 5.1 per cent to a record low in the 2020 financial year that ended March 2021, government figures showed on Friday (Dec 10), as energy demand and industry activities slowed amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>It marked Japan's seventh straight annual drop, but comes as a report by the United Nations weather agency showed global greenhouse gas concentrations <a>hit new highs last year</a>.</p>
<p>"We can hardly say the drop in 2020 was all the result of our initiatives against global warming as it reflected weaker economic activities hit by the COVID-19 pandemic," Yoshiteru Sakaguchi, a director at environment ministry, told reporters.</p>
<p>"We need to move forward with various measures at a much faster pace to achieve 46 per cent," he said.</p>
<p>Japan's emissions had surged after the 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima led to the closure of atomic power plants and boosted reliance on fossil fuels, but have turned lower since a peak of 1.408 billion tonnes hit in the 2013 year.</p>
<p>Only eight reactors are operating now while many others are still going through a re-licencing process under the stricter safety standards imposed after the Fukushima disaster.</p>
<p>In the 2020 year, renewable accounted for 19.8 per cent of electric power generation of 1.001 trillion kilowatt hour (kWh), up 1.7 percentage points on the year.</p>
<p>Nuclear energy came in at 3.9 per cent, down 2.3 percentage points, while thermal power fuelled by oil, coal and liquefied natural gas formed 76.3 per cent, up 0.7 percentage points, industry ministry data showed.</p>
<p>Under Japan's latest 2030 energy mix target, renewables should <a>contribute 36 to 38 per cent</a>, nuclear 20 to 22 per cent, fossil fuels 41 per cent while new hydrogen and ammonia make up 1 per cent.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> Vulnerable to climate change, New York constructs seawall </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>NEW YORK: After major storms highlighted New York's weaknesses in the face of climate change, the city is erecting a US$1.45 billion system of walls and floodgates to protect it from rising sea levels.</p>
<p>Superstorm Sandy in 2012 was the trigger for establishing the East Coast Resiliency Project (ESCR), running 4km along the shoreline of Lower Manhattan. Hurricane Ida, which ravaged parts of the city this year, added further urgency.</p>
<p>During Sandy, which killed 44 city residents while impacting 110,000 more and leaving US$19 billion in damages, water levels rose upwards of 2.4m, according to Tom Foley, New York's acting Design and Construction Commissioner.</p>
<p>The completed wall will reach as high as 5m, Foley said. The project will also include gates to prevent water from seeping into Manhattan, home of the densest population in the United States.</p>
<p>The wall between 23rd and 20th streets is already constructed, an area where the East River and residential housing are at their most narrow.</p>
<p>Further down, where terrain allows, the project will include a hilly park that will serve as a protective wall, as well as a dock, an esplanade, bike lanes, benches and garden areas.</p>
<p>And a new underground drainage system will improve the sewage network's evacuation capacity, while the construction of a power substation should help prevent a days-long power loss that happened during Sandy.</p>
<p>That major 2012 superstorm proved one of the worst to hit the United States this century, along with 2005's Katrina, which devastated New Orleans, and Harvey, which lashed Houston in 2017.</p>
<p>But the project is far from enough: New York's 402km of coastline faces forecasts of more than 60cm rise in sea levels by 2050 and nearly 1.8m by the end of the century.</p>
<p>According to Jainey Bavishi, who directs the Mayor's Office of Climate Resilience, the city is investing in a "multi-layered strategy". </p>
<p>"We are building coastal protections where possible to keep the water out - but we also recognise that we're not going to be able to keep the water out in all places," Bavishi told AFP.</p>
<p>She explained that the protections now under construction are "built to be adaptable".</p>
<p>"So if the projections for sea level rise and storm surge get worse than what we believe they are now, we can actually add elevation to the wall to add further protection."</p>
<p>Some citizens are unhappy with the project and local associations have lodged appeals against it. Barring delays from those hurdles, the project is meant to be finished by 2026.</p>
<p>The hope is that Lower Manhattan will be able to breathe easier.</p>
<p>"I think it's a good idea but things move slowly, so I don't know how ... effective it's going to be," said one resident named Terry.</p>
<p>The ESCR is just one component of a larger project announced in 2013, when the city revealed a nearly US$20 billion plan aimed at "climate resilience". </p>
<p>But that price tag is just a "down payment", Bavishi says. "Resiliency is a process, not an outcome."</p>
<p>The US Congress recently approved a massive social spending plan of US$1.2 trillion, which will allocate roughly US$550 billion to climate and clean energy tax incentives.</p>
<p>"I do believe that our entire climate resiliency strategy is one of the most ambitious in the United States and potentially in the world," Bavishi said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Mediacorp unveils CNA Green Plan campaign focusing on sustainability issues </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Gabrielle Andres </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Mediacorp on Thursday (Dec 16) launched an islandwide campaign to spread awareness of sustainability issues, aiming to “inspire individuals in our communities to take the first step towards going green”.</p>
<p>The first phase of the CNA Green Plan will include a series of public engagement activities both on the ground and online, Mediacorp said in a news release.</p>
<p>These are centred around the five pillars of the Singapore Green Plan 2030: City in Nature, Resilient Future, Energy Reset, Green Economy and Sustainable Living.</p>
<p>“These challenges will help participants better understand sustainability issues and encourage them to take action to reduce their carbon footprint,” Mediacorp said.</p>
<p>These issues include the impact of climate change on Singapore, energy consumption and securing a sustainable future for the country.</p>
<p>“Each of the five themes will be tackled by three towns for a total of 15 towns, with all residents of any town invited to partake in an assortment of activities associated with the five Singapore Green Plan 2030 pillars,” the company added.</p>
<div> <div> <div> Collapse Expand </div> </div> </div>
<p>The on-ground challenges are slated to begin from Jan 6. The public can register their interest on the CNA Green Plan website before the event date.</p>
<p>These activities “incorporate friendly competitive elements, such as pitting participants against each other in nature trails to track down specific species of flora and fauna”, Mediacorp said.</p>
<p>“Other fun activities for the family include a half-day farming bootcamp, with mini challenges on how to grow your own vegetables at home and educating the public on local produce.”</p>
<p>For the online challenges, the public can create and post video and visual content on their social media platforms.</p>
<p>Forty-five individuals with the best entries will each stand a chance to win an EZ-link card containing S$500 worth of credit. The online competition is currently open and will end on Feb 20, 2022.</p>
<p>The on-ground challenges will also be filmed and packaged into a five-part series, Mediacorp said.</p>
<p>Scheduled for an April 2022 release, the series will also include selected entries from the online challenges.</p>
<p>“Other exciting engagement activities for subsequent phases of the CNA Green Plan will be announced in due course,” Mediacorp said.</p>
<p>Editor-in-chief and chief sustainability officer Walter Fernandez said: "This islandwide initiative is one of Mediacorp’s long-term efforts to raise awareness about sustainability as well as the related challenges and issues.</p>
<p>"I hope our audiences can join us on our climate action mission, and that our efforts will motivate all of us to be more thoughtful about going green in our daily lives."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> Former Danone CEO to chair global climate disclosures body </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: A new global standard setter for company climate disclosures will be chaired by Emmanuel Faber, the former head of French yoghurt maker Danone and long-time advocate of sustainable business.</p>
<p>It plans to launch its first global "baseline" company climate disclosure standards in the second half of 2022, though it will be up to each country to decide if and how they are applied.</p>
<p>Regulators want more rigour and coherence in disclosures to stamp out greenwashing, or companies exaggerating their climate-friendly credentials as trillions of dollars pour into sustainable investments.</p>
<p>The "alphabet soup" of disclosure practices currently in place is impairing the ability of markets to channel capital into sustainable investments, Faber said.</p>
<p>"Greenwashing is basically paralysing everyone," Faber told Reuters.</p>
<p>"One of the reasons I was excited about joining this initiative is we will significantly reduce the greenwashing noise."</p>
<p>Faber, 57, has been appointed for an initial three-year term and will be based in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>In March he was ousted as chairman and chief executive of Danone after coming under pressure over margins and sales.</p>
<p>He will enter history for promoting core business units around environmental, social and governance (ESG) objectives in the food sector, which triggers one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, Forbes magazine wrote on the boardroom turmoil in March.</p>
<p>"I worked 20 years to start the food revolution that is one of the two pathways to a transition. I want to act now at its next frontier," Faber later tweeted in October.</p>
<p>More than 40 jurisdictions, including the United States, Japan, China and Britain have welcomed the ISSB, and likely endorsement of its standards by the world's securities regulators will also help the new body gain traction.</p>
<p>The ISSB is part of the IFRS Foundation, whose International Accounting Standards Board writes accounting rules used in about 140 countries.</p>
<p>Although the European Union's executive European Commission has announced support for the ISSB, the bloc has already moved ahead with its own, more ambitious climate disclosures for companies.</p>

<p>As the world embraces decarbonisation in the bid to tackle climate change, innovations such as electric transport and energy-efficient technologies are more important than ever.</p>
<p>THE ELECTRIC TRANSPORT REVOLUTION</p>
<p>One of the global trends that is set to have a major impact on decarbonisation is the rise of EVs, which includes plug-in hybrid or wholly battery-powered vehicles.</p>
<a>committed to having a 100 per cent clean energy bus fleet by 2040</a>, starting with 60 electric buses that will decrease the carbon tailpipe emissions from buses by approximately 7,840 tonnes annually.
<p>In addition to their usage in EVs, batteries are one of the technologies that – along with wind and solar – BHP anticipates may be needed to sustainably power the world’s energy grid while still meeting rising energy needs.</p>
<p>A SUSTAINABLE MANIFESTO FOR THE FUTURE</p>
<a> Climate Transition Action Plan 2021</a>. This plan includes targets and a goal aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the company’s operations.
<p>BHP is also partnering other organisations to promote the development of carbon market mechanisms, particularly for natural climate solutions. Furthermore, it recognises the necessity of supporting efforts to reduce emissions in its value chain.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> One remote Scottish distillery is now carbon net zero, and it’s showing the whisky world the way </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jack Board </a> </div> </div>
<p>DRIMNIN, UK: This is wild country, raw and exposed to nature’s force. In these late autumn months, the landscape is a rich ochre. </p>
<p>After a few dozen miles on a single track road that contorts through rugged highland valleys, a distillery looms, overlooking the Sound of Mull. The Drimnin Estate isn’t at the end of the Earth, but it feels something close to it.</p>
<p>This is one of Scotland’s most isolated places. Only a few hundred people live on this land in the Hebridean Islands. A small group of them are doing something quite remarkable with whisky.</p>
<p>This year, Nc’nean Distillery became the UK’s first and only net zero carbon emissions distillery. It runs on 100 per cent renewable energy and offsets its small footprint using forestry resources.</p>
<p>The distillery’s operations are designed around using biomass as a fuel. It also recycles 99.97 per cent of the water used in the whisky-making process, is a zero waste operation and is certified organic.</p>
<p>In ways, this is emblematic of a new Scottish whisky story. </p>
<p>As the world now attempts to wean off dirty energy in the face of worsening climate change, so too is Scotland’s whisky industry.</p>
<p>Reaching net zero certification has been a journey for Nc’nean, one that many other distilleries around Scotland are also starting to undertake as the scotch whisky industry aims to completely decarbonise by 2040.</p>
<p>“We've managed to hit net zero 20 years ahead of industry targets and 25 years ahead of government targets. But that's because we were thinking about this 10 years ago,” said Amy Stammers, who runs the sustainability portfolio at Nc’nean. </p>
<p>“This is classed as carbon neutral because the CO2 that's being emitted when we combust, that timber has already been absorbed from the atmosphere while the tree grows,” Stammers explained.</p>
<p>“We have enough trees to close a 40-year loop in terms of cyclical energy - trees growing and energy generation.”</p>
<p>Installing a boiler that could function using biomass was an engineering challenge and a serious investment. </p>
<p>Stammers estimates it initially cost five times that of a conventional boiler. Meantime, hand selecting organic barley producers and shifting towards recycled glass in their bottles were also extra expenses to consider for a fledgling business. </p>
<p>The next step for Nc’nean is to tackle its supply chain and influence changes that will positively affect its wider emissions output and the environmental impact of its products.</p>
<p>The only sources of emissions now left on site are the distillery’s forklift and tractor, which are separately offset elsewhere. “The cost implications were more at the time. But the savings that that's brought us now is worth every penny.” </p>
