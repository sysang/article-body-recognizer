<h1> New Year’s Resolutions Are Notoriously Hard to Keep </h1>
<h2> ...but there are ways to take the mystery out of behavior change. </h2>
<li>By the end of 2021, 55% of Americans said they were not able to keep their New Year's resolutions.</li>
<li>It is important to assess the factors that are influencing one's current actions if a behavioral change is desired.</li>
<li>Determining the Who, What, Where, When and Why of a change makes one more likely to succeed when trying the How.</li>
<p>In 2021, 2 out of 5 Americans made New Year’s resolutions, but by the end of the year, 55% said they were not able to keep their resolutions. So why do so many of us struggle to make changes in our own lives that we know would be beneficial?</p>
<p>Yet, despite our willingness to put time into solving mysteries as a form of entertainment, we don’t always focus the same amount of energy on understanding our own lives and behavior.</p>
<h3>Creating a behavior-change plan using the "five Ws"</h3>
<p>Fortunately, psychologists have developed strategies for systematically exploring clues about our current behavior patterns and using that information to develop and implement change.</p>
<p>False alibis based on broken clocks, faulty travel schedules, and incorrect assumptions often lie at the heart of traditional “whodunits.” But it turns out that accurate perceptions of time are key to behavior change as well. </p>
<a>the environment</a> signal that certain behaviors are acceptable and others are not and the consequences of our following those cues influences how closely we pay
<a>smoking</a> habit by chewing gum after you drink your coffee? Simply making a behavior easier or harder to do can change the frequency with which we do it.
<p>Understanding why someone behaved the way they did is often the crux of solving a murder mystery. Until we understand their <a>motivation</a>, we may have trouble finding a pattern to their behavior.</p>
<p>The same is true when it comes to behavior change. We typically pick goals that are easy to justify in the long run (eating healthier, studying more) but that are difficult to achieve because the required behaviors are aversive in the short run.</p>
<p>In general, it is better to reward the behavior you want than to think that you will punish yourself for failure. While <a>punishment</a> can work in the short run, the ultimate goal is to create a new, rewarding set of behaviors. </p>

<h1> Tuning Up Your Listening </h1>
<h2> Six ways to sharpen your listening skills </h2>
<p> Posted August 26, 2017 </p>

<p>We all want to be heard. We want to be seen and understood. But how skilled are we at extending listening to others?</p>
<p>Here are six ways to sharpen your listening skills.</p>
<p>Notice if you’re distracted by one of the following:</p>
<p>Are you in your head preparing a response? Are you eager to show that they’re wrong or that you disagree? Are you emotionally activated by what they’re saying, which makes it more difficult to listen openly?</p>
<p>These distractions are a natural part of being human. But we can practice being more <a>mindful</a> about when our <a>attention</a> gets hijacked. This gentle awareness can lead us back to being present for a person’s cares and concerns.</p>
<p>Caring for others rests upon taking care of ourselves emotionally. Noticing and communicating our important feelings enables us to clear the air, which keeps our caring alive.</p>
<p>Listening is easier as we hear each other’s feelings before an emotional build-up disrupts trust and connection. Felt caring erodes when accumulated resentment and hurt have created a wall of distance.</p>
<a>stressed</a>. Breathing often calms our
<a>nervous system</a> so that we become more present — and better able to listen. Let your breathing be easy and relaxed when listening.
<p>When we’re calm and quiet inside, we have more space to hear each other — we have a greater capacity to care. Breathing is one way to soothe ourselves. Another way is to attend to what we’re feeling as we listen.</p>
<p>Convey Your Understanding</p>
<p>More than our words, people register our presence. People can often sense when we’re listening with an authentic, caring, non-shaming heart.</p>
<p>Listen to Yourself </p>

<p>As a psychotherapist, I often hear how lonely and isolated people feel. Even if married or successful in their careers, many people carry a painful sense of disconnection and alienation.</p>

<a> Lyon describes shame</a> as a hot potato. We want to pass it on to the one who shamed us or transfer it to another person. This shame-

<a>restore sexual self-confidence</a>.
<div> <h3> How does negative self-talk affect body image? </h3> </div>
<a>reframing negative self-talk</a> can be especially valuable when those thoughts focus on people's bodies or appearance. When such thoughts arise, one can remind themself, “Everyone feels like this sometimes, but
<a>how I feel about my appearance does not determine my worth</a>,” for example, or “These are the legs that move me around in the world and the arms that hug the people I love.”

<h1> Brain Aging Might Soon Be Reversible </h1>
<h2> How regenerative medicine promises to slow, or even reverse cognitive decline. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> How Do We Age? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist specialized in aging concerns</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Advances in regenerative medicine may be able to add decades to our lives.</li>
<li>The upper limit for human lifespan extension is thought to be around 122 years, the current record for human longevity.</li>
<li>The "120 year limit" for lifespan is primarily set by the inability of brain tissue to regenerate and the infeasibility of brain transplants.</li>
<li>But three new strategies for rejuvenating aging human brains may be able to work around the unique challenges of reversing aging in the brain.</li>
<p>Last week I asked my brother Bill, a molecular biologist and a founder of the field of regenerative medicine, whether radical life extension, out to 120 years or beyond, might be possible.</p>
<p>But a few audacious neuroscientists are exploring ways to not only slow but actually reverse the aging of the brain, raising the prospect that some of us might celebrate our 120th birthdays with all of our mental faculties intact. </p>
<p>This exciting work falls into roughly three categories: stopping aging brains from suppressing themselves, reactivating neuron growth, and injecting new cells to replace lost neurons.</p>
<h3>Stop the Brain From Suppressing Itself</h3>
<a>neural</a> function. Walter and collaborator, Dr. Susanna Rosi recently found that inhibiting ISR activity (that itself inhibits brain function), can reverse
<h3>Reactivate Neuron Growth and Development</h3>
<h3>Injecting New Cells to Restore of Replace Lost Neurons</h3>
<a>traumatic brain injury</a>. It's not yet clear how much lost function this new technique can restore, but neuroscientists are hopeful it may one day help lessen cognitive and motor deficits in neurodegenerative diseases such as
<a>Dementia</a> and Parkinson's disease.
