<a>imagination</a>, in which the content is false and known to be so. Sexual imagination offers an effective way of coping with personal limitations, normative boundaries, and external constraints. One is free to
<a>fantasize</a> outrageous encounters, done in exactly the way one desires. Given the effectiveness of imagination, many women say they can achieve
<a>orgasm</a> through fantasy alone, with no physical stimulation at all. In one study on lovers, about 70% said that they fantasize while making love (Fisher, 2005; Ben-Ze’ev Goussinsky, 2008).

<p>In the same manner that robots cannot experience sexual desire, they cannot experience romantic love. However, can robots enhance <a>romantic relationships</a> in the way they enhance sexual encounters?</p>

<p>Adolescents today have greater access to <a>pornography</a> than any previous generation. So how is it affecting them? </p>
<a>This is Life</a> titled “Porn Ed,” which premieres September 29. Ling wanted to better understand how accessibility to porn is changing the way adolescents and young adults think about sex and approach relationships.

<p>Below is a lightly edited transcript of my conversation with Ling that focuses on the areas where we agree, but also the areas where science and medicine diverge from some of the things claimed by those who were interviewed in the episode. </p>
<p>My big concern is just the abundance of material that's out there—some of which is really extreme—and how easy kids can access it.</p>

<p>Lisa Ling: There's the funding we need to do the research. And most of our insurance will not pay for the therapeutic services that people might need to even figure out what may have spurred someone to seek out porn.</p>

<h1> Our 7 Most Common Sexual Fantasies </h1>
<h2> Research uncovers the most popular fantasy themes. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Peter Hershey on Unsplash </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>What is your favorite sexual fantasy?</p>
<p>1. Multipartner sex. Most often, this included things like threesomes, orgies, and gangbangs.</p>
<p>2. Power, control, and rough sex—anything falling under the umbrella of <a>bondage</a>, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism (BDSM). </p>
<p>3. Novelty, adventure, and variety. This refers to doing something that is new and different for you, such as having sex in a new position or setting.</p>
<p>5. Passion, romance, and <a>intimacy</a>. These fantasies involved meeting emotional needs through sex, such as connecting with a partner, or feeling loved, appreciated, and desired.</p>
<p>6. Being in a nonmonogamous relationship. These fantasies involved practicing some form of non-<a>monogamy</a>, such as swinging, <a>polyamory</a>, cuckolding, or having an open relationship. </p>
<a>Gender</a>-bending and homoeroticism. This final category was all about pushing the boundaries of your gender
<a>identity</a>/role/expression (such as cross-dressing) and/or your
<a>sexual orientation</a> (such as being heterosexual but having a same-sex fantasy).
<div> <div> <div> <div>The 7 most common sex fantasies</div> <div>Source: Justin Lehmiller</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>As you can see, most people reported having had several different types of fantasies. In other words, it’s perfectly normal to fantasize about a lot of different things.</p>
<p>A couple of additional notes about the data above:</p>
<a>DSM</a> other than BDSM, given that BDSM was considered separately. This category focused on things like exhibitionism, voyeurism, frotteurism, and fetishism.
<li>For the passion/romance/intimacy category, I looked at fantasies about romance, feeling loved or appreciated, feeling desired, pleasing a partner, and emotionally connecting with a partner.</li>
<p>Lastly, remember that just become someone fantasizes about something doesn't necessarily mean that they desire it or want to do it. While there is definitely some overlap between fantasy and desire, these terms are not synonymous.</p>

<a>climate change</a> to tooth decay to mental health; however, the part of the book that interested me the most—as a sex researcher and educator—was how civilization has changed sex and reproduction.
<p>I recently interviewed Ryan (who also happens to be a co-author of <a>Sex at Dawn</a>) about his latest book and the subject of civilized sex in particular. In a two-part series, I’ll be sharing the highlights of our discussion.</p>

<p>Lehmiller: How has civilization changed sex? Has it changed the way we think about sex? The way we have sex? </p>
<a>cooperation</a> are the central organizing principles of a hunter-gatherer society.
<a>sexuality</a>. As a prime example of this, you talk about this guy John Harvey Kellogg. He was kind of a quack because he was this doctor who held the belief that
<a>masturbation</a> was bad for you, and that sex was bad for you, too.

<a>denial</a> and the grotesque forms that these essentially beautiful and life-giving energies can take when they're pushed underground. I think you could argue that the Catholic church is essentially a result of the
<a>repression</a> of sexuality in general and specifically of gay male sexuality. The church was a place where gay men could go and sort of be protected in a sense by an institution that was built upon denial.

<a>sexuality</a> is complicated, and it’s a heck of a lot more to it than penis-in-vagina intercourse. Your kid wants (and needs) to know more than simply how babies are made, how to avoid STIs, and how to prevent unwanted
<a>pregnancy</a>. For example, topics such as
<a>masturbation</a>, oral sex, and
<a>sexual assault</a> need to be addressed, too.

<p>We aren’t experiencing as much <a>sexual</a> pleasure as we used to. What can we do to fix that?</p>
<a>Wise</a>, Ph.D., a certified sex therapist and cognitive
<a>neuroscientist</a> who studies the science of
<a>orgasm</a>, has the answers. Wise just published a fabulous new book titled
<p>I recently interviewed Wise about her book for the <a>Sex and Psychology podcast</a>. Below is an excerpt from our discussion that has been lightly edited for clarity. </p>
<a>attention</a> is so divided. Our attention is so hijacked across so many different things that we're not able to be present. And when we're not able to be present, we're not regulating emotions as well. The short answer is that we're overstimulated.
<p>Lehmiller: What can we do to fix that? How do we become less stimulated so that we can experience more pleasure? What kind of advice or recommendations do you give to people in this regard? </p>
<a>dopamine</a> bumps from our social media pings and all of that, that affects our capacity to really feel satisfying pleasure. If we understand how that gets hijacked, we can be a little more intentional.
<a>mindful</a> consumer of your social media, a mindful consumer of your recreational drugs, your foodstuffs, all of that. Whatever you do, be mindful and prioritize pleasure.
<p>And when I say prioritize your pleasure, it’s really learning how to be attuned to the sensations in your body.</p>

<h1> Why Are "Rape Fantasies" So Common? </h1>
<h2> New research sheds light on the psychology behind fantasies about forced sex. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: iStockphoto/adl21</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But just how many people report having had them? And why?</p>
<li>61% of self-identified women had fantasized about this before, while 24% said they fantasized about it often.</li>
<li>54% of self-identified men had fantasized about this before, while 11.5% said they fantasized about it often.</li>
<li>68% of <a>non-binary</a> participants had fantasized about this before, while 31% said they fantasized about it often.</li>
<a>sexual assault</a>—rather, they’re picturing a scenario that unfolds on their own terms, which means the sex isn’t truly forced.
<p>So where do these fantasies come from? And what’s the deeper psychological meaning behind them? </p>
<li>People with <a>sensation-seeking</a> personalities had more of these fantasies. In other words, forced sex fantasies seem to have more appeal to persons who have a heightened need for <a>sexual</a> excitement and thrills. </li>
<li>Persons with forced sex fantasies were highly likely to report having <a>BDSM</a> fantasies more generally. Thus, in many cases, forced sex fantasies may signify nothing more than a broader interest in BDSM activities. </li>

<a>some have proposed explanations</a> rooted in
<a>evolutionary psychology</a>, as well as in sociocultural factors, such as avoidance of sexual blame for sexual double standards.
<p><a>Sexual fantasies</a> are thus perhaps best viewed through a biopsychosocial lens, in which a blend of biological, evolutionary, psychological, and socio-cultural factors contribute. </p>

<h1> How the Pandemic Is Changing Pornography </h1>
<h2> COVID-19 is affecting porn production and porn searches on popular sites. </h2>

<p>Coronavirus is permeating every aspect of our lives, including our sex lives.</p>
<a>porn</a>. The coronavirus pandemic is affecting not just the amount and type of porn being produced, but also how much porn people are consuming and what they're searching for on major sites.
<a>traffic to the site was up 11.6 percent</a>.
<a>fear</a> of disease and death.
<a>The Psychology of Human Sexuality</a>, the key idea behind
<a>Terror Management Theory</a> is that “when we are reminded of our own mortality, we subconsciously alter our attitudes and behaviors to help us cope with the ‘terrifying’ prospect of our eventual death.”
<a>more than 9 million coronavirus searches</a> have appeared on Pornhub. There are also now more than 1,000 videos that pop up on the site when you search for "coronavirus."
<p>What does coronavirus porn look like? It involves a lot of people having sex while wearing masks, surgical gloves, and hazmat suits. </p>
<a>our constant need for sexual novelty</a> and humans’ ability to fetishize virtually everything.
<a>Christmas</a>, porn searches become more festive—people start looking for porn with holiday flair.
<a>strong emotions are often mistaken for sexual attraction</a>. For example, when people engage in activities that produce high-arousal states—like riding a roller coaster—and then encounter an attractive stranger,
<a>attraction</a> to that person increases. High-fear states have the potential to amplify sexual arousal and attraction.
<a>Rolling Stone</a>, many porn performers are worried about how their work could potentially expose them to the virus.
<a>Just being in close contact with someone else</a> (being less than 6 feet apart) poses a potential transmission risk, so it stands to reason that porn performers would be at substantially elevated risk due to the very intimate nature of their job.

<h1> Why the Lockdown Is Turning Some People On, but Others Off </h1>
<h2> Some people use sex as a coping mechanism for stress and anxiety. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Photo by Toa Heftiba on Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>anxiety</a> is putting a damper on desire, whereas others are saying that everyone is super horny. Which one is it?
<a>sexual</a> desire in some can drive it down in others.
<p>As a result, a lot of us are dealing with a certain amount of death anxiety. Terror <a>Management</a> research suggests that different people are probably coping with this in very different ways.</p>
<a>body image</a>, as well as those who were more comfortable with physical
<p>In other words, the way we feel about our bodies and the way we feel about sex in general seem to be key factors that predict whether people rely on sex as a coping mechanism for reducing anxiety. </p>
<p>This can potentially help to explain why some people are hornier and more sexually active right now, <a>as evidenced by increases in rates of porn consumption on major tube sites</a>.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, it also helps to explain why not everyone is more interested in sex, and why others may be using non-sexual means of relieving anxiety instead.</p>
<a>fear</a> and anxiety sometimes have the effect of amplifying sexual arousal rather than suppressing it. Indeed,
<p>If you’re someone who’s easily excited to begin with, I suspect you’re probably more susceptible to these effects, where stress might paradoxically push the gas pedal rather than the brake.</p>

<p>Social distancing and stay-at-home orders stemming from the COVID-19 <a>coronavirus</a> pandemic have prompted a slew of social media posts and popular media articles talking about the challenges these orders pose for our intimate lives. </p>
<p>For example, it’s easy to find articles talking about how couples are getting <a>sick of each other</a> and how there’s going to be a <a>post-COVID divorce boom</a>.</p>
<a>Kinsey Institute</a> are in the midst of conducting a long-term study on how this pandemic is affecting our sex lives and relationships.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Promescent, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In our first wave of data collection, we surveyed thousands of adults about the impacts they’ve experienced, and we did indeed find that a lot of people said their intimate lives had taken a hit since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>Specifically, 44% of participants said their sex life had declined recently, while 30% said the same of their romantic life.</p>
<p>However, it’s not all doom and gloom in the bedroom. At the same time, we found that 14% said their sex life had actually improved, and that 23% reported that their relationship was in a better place, too.</p>
<p>What this tells us is that, while this situation is certainly challenging and many are struggling, it’s also creating new opportunities to change our intimate lives for the better. </p>
<p>So how can you take advantage of the current situation to give your sex and love life a boost?</p>
<p>Here are four suggestions for getting the spark back in your relationship—and keeping it going through the pandemic and beyond.</p>
<p>1. Try New Things in the Bedroom</p>
<p>Human beings are <a>inherently turned on by novelty and newness</a> when it comes to sex. We grow <a>bored</a> of <a>sexual</a> routines easily—and it’s easier than ever to feel like you’re in a rut right now.</p>
<p>We can’t even leave our homes except to go grab some essentials, so it’s natural to feel some pent-up demand for something fresh, new, interesting, and exciting.</p>
<p>You can channel this need for novelty by trying new bedroom activities with your partner that you’ve always wanted to explore.</p>
<p>In our study, we found that 1 in 5 adults said they’ve made a new addition to their sex life since the pandemic began. Among the many things people reported trying were:</p>
<ul><li>Having sex in a new position or location at home</li> <li>Filming themselves having sex</li> <li>Trying a remote-controlled sex toy</li> <li>Sharing and/or acting on a sexual fantasy that they’ve never explored before </li> </ul>
<p>The people who made new additions were more likely to say that both their sex life and their relationship had improved.</p>
<p>In fact, those who tried new things were three times more likely to report improvements in the bedroom than those who didn’t make any new additions.</p>
<a>fantasies</a> you’ve never shared before.
<p>What you do doesn't matter as much as finding something that’s new and comfortable for both of you.</p>
<p>2. Find Ways to Manage Stress and Cultivate Desire</p>
<p>It’s normal to feel <a>stressed</a>, <a>anxious</a>, and on edge right now. There’s a lot of uncertainty in the world, and the news is far more depressing than uplifting.</p>
<p>If your mind (or your partner’s mind) is preoccupied with pandemic-related thoughts, that’s going to make it harder to not only get in the mood for sex but also to enjoy sexual activity. And our data supports this.</p>
<p>The more worried and stressed out participants reported feeling, the less sexually active they were and the more they said the pandemic had taken a toll on their intimate life.</p>
<p>This points to the importance of finding ways to cope with stress effectively so that you and your partner can cultivate desire—and open the door to trying those new things we talked about above.</p>
<p>Some might find it helpful to:</p>
<ul><li>Incorporate <a>meditation</a> or <a>mindfulness</a> techniques into daily life</li> <li>Disconnect from news, email, and social media to clear the mind</li> <li>Exercise, take a long bath, or give each other massages</li> </ul>
<div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>What to Do When Partners Want Different Amounts of Sex</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>10 Reasons Why Some Couples Stop Having Sex</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div>
<p>Figure out forms of self-care that work for both of you so that you have some opportunities to be relaxed, in the moment, and focused on each other rather than on the pandemic.</p>
<p>3. Have a Romantic Date Night at Home</p>
<p>With restaurants, bars, movie theaters, and other popular date night destinations temporarily closed, it might seem like the idea of having a romantic evening together is far-fetched.</p>
<p>However, there’s no reason that you can’t still have a satisfying date night at home. It just takes a little effort and creativity.</p>
<p>Putting in some effort to look good will help to enhance your sexual appeal to your partner, while also showing them that you care.</p>
<p>The options are endless, and with a little <a>creative thinking</a>, you can craft a relaxing—or exciting—evening (depending on what you’re looking for) to fit any budget.</p>
<p>Making It Successful. Take care to minimize distractions during your date night so that you can be focused on each other, which probably means putting the phones and laptops away temporarily and making sure the kids are off to bed.</p>
<p>Whatever you opt to do, the key is to use this as an opportunity to disconnect from stress and reconnect with your partner.</p>
<p>4. Remember...What Comes After Sex Matters Too</p>
<p><a>Research finds that</a> couples who engage in more after-sex affection — think spooning, cuddling, and intimate conversation — tend to be more satisfied with their sex lives and relationships.</p>
<p>With rates of sexual activity down right now, these post-sex activities might be more important than ever for helping to sustain an intimate connection.</p>
<p>This kind of intimate touch releases the <a>hormone</a> <a>oxytocin</a>, which promotes feelings of bondedness and connection. </p>
<p>So, touching each other after sex can quite literally help you to stay in touch and could potentially be helpful in terms of cultivating more sexual desire and satisfaction during a challenging time.</p>
<p>In this time of social distancing and isolation, our intimate lives are facing unprecedented tests, and many people feel as though their sex lives and relationships are in decline.</p>
<a>intimacy</a> that has the potential to not only help us get through this pandemic, but also to strengthen our relationships for the long haul.

<p>When you fantasize about sex, do you appear in your own fantasies? If so, do you appear as you do in real life, or do you change yourself in some way?</p>
<a>Tell Me What You Want</a>, and one of the many things I looked at was the way that we see ourselves. What I found was that many people change some aspect of themselves, such as their body, their genitals, or their
<p>When I asked people whether or not they appear in their own fantasies at least some of the time, almost everyone (97.1 percent) said yes. Further, most people said they appear in their own fantasies most of the time.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <div>How people change themselves in their sexual fantasies. Data from Tell Me What You Want.</div> <div>Source: Justin Lehmiller</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>For example, self-identified women (regardless of <a>sexual orientation</a>) were more likely to change their bodies than were self-identified men. However, gay and bisexual men were more likely than heterosexual men to change their bodies.</p>
<p>By contrast, men (regardless of sexual orientation) were more likely than women to change their genital appearance—but gay and bisexual men were even more likely than heterosexual men to do so.</p>
<a>Tell Me What You Want</a>, they may say something about our personalities. For example, while introverted people fantasized more about changing their personality and becoming more dominant,
<a>extraverts</a> were less likely to change themselves in any way. Neurotic individuals (those who don’t deal well with
<a>stress</a> and who have more emotional instability) fantasized more about changing both their bodies and personalities. Interestingly,
<a>conscientious</a> people (those who are more detail-oriented and organized) were the least likely to fantasize about changing any aspect of the self—their

<a>our overall sexual and relationship quality</a>, so it only seems reasonable to assume that there may have also been some shifts in our fantasies.
<a>sexual</a> fantasies (to learn more about other new things people tried, check out our first publication from the study
<p>In subsequent waves of data collection, we added further questions on a variety of topics, including more specific questions about sexual fantasies, the results of which I’ll be exploring in this article.</p>
<li>8% said they are fantasizing a lot more </li>
<li>27% said they are fantasizing a little more</li>
<li>40% said they are fantasizing at about the same rate as before</li>
<li>17% said they are fantasizing a little less</li>
<li>9% said they are fantasizing a lot less</li>
<a>here</a>. In our pandemic study, we asked people whether they had fantasized for each of these reasons (along with a few additional reasons that we thought might be relevant), and here’s what they said:
<li>49% said they had fantasized to enhance sexual arousal </li>
<li>39% said they had fantasized to temporarily escape reality</li>
<li>34% said they had fantasized to meet unmet sexual needs</li>
<li>33% said they had fantasized to relax or reduce <a>anxiety</a></li>
<li>31% said they had fantasized to compensate for the lack of or absence of a partner</li>
<li>29% said they had fantasized to plan out a future sexual encounter</li>
<li>29% said they had fantasized because they were <a>bored</a> and had nothing else to do</li>
<li>18% said they had fantasized to meet unmet emotional needs</li>
<li>17% said they had fantasized to feel more sexually confident</li>
<li>15% said they had fantasized to block out distractions during sex</li>
<li>14% said they had fantasized because they were curious about different sexual experiences or sensations</li>
<li>13% said they had fantasized to express a taboo sexual desire</li>
<li>3% said they had fantasized to compensate for an unattractive partner</li>
<li>3% said they had fantasized for reasons other than those mentioned above, such as getting ideas for writing erotic fiction, escaping <a>chronic pain</a>, and help falling asleep.</li>

<h1> Talk Dirty To Me: The Psychology of Dirty Talk </h1>
<h2> New research explores how many people are into dirty talk and why it's arousing. </h2>

<a>sexual fantasies</a> helps to shed light on it. I surveyed 4,175 Americans about their sex fantasies for my book
<a>Tell Me What You Want</a>, and one of the many things I asked participants to report on was whether they had ever fantasized about a partner talking dirty to them.
<p>Overall, 91% of participants said this was something they had fantasized about—and 49% said they fantasize about it often.</p>
<p>Dirty talk fantasies were common across gender—but women were actually the most likely to fantasize about it—and fantasize about it often: </p>
<li>93% of self-identified women had fantasized about dirty talk, and 56% said they fantasize about it often.</li>
<li>90% of self-identified men had fantasized about dirty talk, and 43% said they fantasize about it often.</li>
<li>86% of <a>non-binary</a> participants had fantasized about dirty talk, and 42% said they fantasize about it often.</li>
<p>So what do people find so appealing about dirty talk? And why do women tend to fantasize about it the most? Here are some insights based on my survey:</p>
<a>bondage</a>, discipline, dominance, submission, sadism, and masochism. Dirty talk often plays a role in BDSM scenarios (e.g., to create a dominant-submissive dynamic, as a form of sexual
<a>extraverted</a> had more fantasies about dirty talk—and more fantasies about a partner moaning and screaming. In other words, those who are more sociable and outgoing seem to find sounds during sex to be more erotically appealing, whereas
<a>introverts</a> seem to find quiet sex more arousing.
<p>As you can see, dirty talk fantasies are quite common—and there is a rich psychology behind them. It is also very likely that different people are drawn to dirty talk for very different reasons.</p>

<p>Some people tend to fall in love fast, easily, and often. This tendency is known as emophilia, formerly known as “emotional promiscuity.” It is measured with items such as:</p>
<p>"I fall in love easily.”</p>
<p>"I feel romantic connections right away.”</p>
<p>“I love the feeling of falling in love.”</p>
<p>“I fall in love frequently.”</p>
<p>"I tend to jump into relationships.” </p>
<a>attachment</a> styles often jump into relationships quickly as well, but not because of a reward
<a>motivation</a>—they’re motivated by inhibition or avoidance of a negative emotional state (specifically,
<a>narcissism</a>. Each of these traits means something a little different, but they’re all tied together by a tendency to engage in antisocial behaviors, such as being callous and manipulative.
<p>What the researchers found was that people who scored high in emophilia (compared to those who were low) reported that their ideal partner would be higher in all three of the Dark Triad traits.</p>

<h1> Women’s Experiences with Multiple Orgasms Are Highly Diverse </h1>
<h2> New research finds that there are at least four types of multiorgasmic women. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: 123RF/Piotr Marcinski</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>A recent study published in the Journal of Sex Research attempted to get a better understanding of this subject through a survey of 419 women ages 18-69. </p>
<a>orgasm</a>, on average, at age 14, with their first multiple orgasm occurring around age 19.
<p>When asked whether they felt they had control over multiorgasmic experiences, participants were roughly evenly divided: 47.5% felt they had complete control, while the rest felt their control was incomplete. </p>
<p>In terms of how many orgasms they had in a single session, the numbers varied considerably, ranging from 2 to 101. However, the modal (most common) numbers reported were 5 and 10 (reported by about 12% of women each).</p>
<a>masturbation</a>, and they said they were more likely to have multiple orgasms when they were in a positive mood, felt close to their partner, and felt relaxed.
<p>The second orgasm was reported to occur, on average, 3-4 minutes after the first one; however, women who continued stimulation reported that their next orgasm occurred faster than those who took any kind of break. </p>
<a>bias</a> is another potential issue.
<p>Second, there seems to be a lot of variability in multiorgasmic capacity. There’s a pretty big difference between having 2 orgasms and having 100-plus orgasms. There was also a lot of variation in time between orgasms.</p>
