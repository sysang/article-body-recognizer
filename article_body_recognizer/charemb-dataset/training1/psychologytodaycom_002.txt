<h1> Why Sexual Desire Is So Important to a Relationship </h1>
<h2> The less-known functions of the desire to have sex. </h2>
<li>Sexual desire serves as a gauge of a partner’s value as a mate.</li>
<li>Desire may either foster a relationship with a valued partner or reduce investment in a relationship with one who no longer seems suitable.</li>
<li>Such dynamics may vary over the course of relationships, as the future may carry with it unwanted changes in the way partners are perceived.</li>
<li>Sexual desire functions as a mechanism that encourages investment in partners who are perceived to be worth retaining. </li>
<sup>1</sup>. They also act accordingly. For example, when experiencing intense passion for a partner and satisfying sex, people are likely to express affection for this partner and to have positive feelings about their relationship
<sup>2,3</sup>. Even merely fantasizing about having sex with current partners predicts actual engagement in behaviors that improve the relationship, such as expressing love for the partners or complimenting them

<a>Sexual</a> desire, however, tends to decline over time, with many couples failing to maintain sexual fulfillment in their long-term relationships

<p>Does having a quality relationship make a married couple's sex life better? Is it possible to stay married and be sexually satisfied? Read to the end of the article for links on how to improve sex life and <a>intimacy</a>.</p>
<h3>Studying Sexual and Relationship Satisfaction Over Time</h3>
<a>Christopher Quinn-Nilas (2019)</a> from the University of Guelph, Canada analyzed data collected over two decades from over 700 couples in stable marriages, drawing upon the
<a>Midlife</a> in the United States (MIDUS) study.
<p>The MIDUS measures included demographic variables, such as relationship status, <a>sexual orientation</a>, <a>gender</a>, age, and so on. Individuals were asked if they were in "marriage" or "marriage-like" relationships.</p>
<p>The data were analyzed by testing several models to find which fit, based on a variety of statistical considerations. The best fitting models were chosen, and relevant data were correlated over time.</p>
<h3>How Do Sexual and Relationship Satisfaction Connect Over the Course of a Life Together?</h3>
<p>The following graph shows how relationship and sexual satisfaction scores trended:</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Average scores: Relationship and sexual satisfaction</div> <div>Source: Quinn-Nilas, 2019</div> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Sexual satisfaction declined over time while relationship satisfaction rose. Older participants had lower sexual satisfaction compared with younger ones, but had greater relationship satisfaction.</li>
<li>Sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction were correlated at the start of the study. Individuals who rated their relationship satisfaction high also rated sexual satisfaction high.</li>
<li>As marriages progressed, sexual satisfaction and relationship satisfaction changed in the same direction. On average, sexual and relationship satisfaction rose or fell together.</li>
<li>Sexual satisfaction at the start of the relationship had a protective effect on the relationship. Couples who started with a better sex life maintained relationship satisfaction compared with those who started off less sexually satisfied. </li>
<li>Lower sexual satisfaction at the start placed couples at risk for more steeply declining relationship quality.</li>
<li>Couples who started off with greater relationship satisfaction maintained that level longer, showing slower decline in relationship satisfaction over time.</li>
<li>Women's relationship satisfaction declined more slowly than men's. That was the only significant finding related to gender.</li>

<h1> The Real Sex Lives of Men Over 65 </h1>
<h2> By 65, most erections are history, but men can still enjoy great, orgasmic sex. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> The Fundamentals of Sex </li> <li> <a>Find a sex therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Surprise: Few Elder Men Take Erection Drugs</p>
<p>If elder men can raise erections, they usually owe them to Viagra, Cialis, or Levitra. However, for many (most?) men over 65, the drugs turn out to be a disappointment:</p>
<li>The drugs improve blood flow into the penis but do nothing for libido and arousal, which become increasingly problematic for men over 65.</li>
<a>post-menopausal</a> dryness and vaginal tissue thinning (atrophy) that can make intercourse uncomfortable or painful even with plenty of lubricant.
<p>Bottom line: Most men over 65 bid farewell to erections and penis-in-vagina intercourse and opt for other pleasures; mutual genital hand massage, oral sex, and toys.</p>
<p>Healthy Lifestyle Helps—Until It Doesn’t</p>
<a>sexuality</a>. Studies abound showing that later-life sexual function decline can be delayed with a healthy lifestyle: daily exercise, no tobacco, a plant-based
<a>sleeping</a> eight hours a night, and no more than two
<a>alcoholic</a> drinks a day. I’ve done my best to live that way, and thought (naively) that I was immunized against the sexual ravages of Time. Alas, no.
<a>smoking</a>, alcohol use, single vs. partnered, etc.—differed a bit from the U.S. but not by much, so the findings can be reasonably extrapolated to Americans:
<p>Problem Whole Group (3,274) Partnered (857)</p>
<p>Lack of interest 48% 24%</p>
<p>Erectile dysfunction (ED) 49% 66%</p>
<p>Premature ejaculation 15% 26%</p>
<p>Difficulty ejaculating 39% 43%</p>
<p>Performance <a>anxiety</a> 20% 37%</p>
<p>Low <a>testosterone</a> 7% not determined </p>
<a>masturbation</a> than partner sex. In solo sex, you only have yourself to please. In partner sex, the man’s needs and desires must mesh with the woman’s, and things get complicated and erections suffer.
<p>The same was true for both premature ejaculation and difficulty ejaculating. Men having only solo sex have better ejaculatory control than those who have partner sex.</p>
<p>Despite general awareness than men’s sexual function declines with age, a considerable proportion of these men were still upset about it.</p>
<a>advertising</a> pitches older men on testosterone supplementation and many physicians are happy to prescribe it. But in this sample, only 7 percent actually had “low T,” and among those who did, the
<a>hormone</a> deficiency was associated with only one sex problem, lack of libido. Testosterone level had nothing to do with erection,
<a>orgasm</a>, or ejaculatory control.
<div> <h2>Sex Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Why Are Americans Having Less Sex?</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>How Feeling Like a "We" Boosts Sexual Satisfaction</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>The main causes of this sample’s sex problems were not psychological problems or relationship issues but rather chronic health conditions: obesity, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, sleep disorders, and high blood pressure.</p>
<p>As part of the Adelaide Male Aging Study (Martin, 2012), a different group of Australian researchers asked 271 men, age 65 to 80, about their health, libido, and erections.</p>
<li>Low desire was a major problem, reported by 89 percent of single older men, and 33 percent of those with partners.</li>
<li>ED was a major problem, reported by 91 percent of the men—mild-to-moderate ED, 54 percent, moderate-to-severe ED, 37 percent.</li>
<p>Risk factors for low libido included: anxiety, <a>depression</a>, <a>insomnia</a>, sedentary lifestyle, and more than two alcoholic drinks a day.</p>
<p>Risk factors for ED included: anxiety, depression, diabetes, insomnia, cancer, smoking, obesity (especially pot belly), high blood pressure medication, more than two alcoholic drinks a day, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).</p>
<p>Together, the two studies show:</p>
<li>Testosterone deficiency is not common in older men. Like many physicians and public health officials, I would argue that low T is over-diagnosed and over-treated.</li>
<li>Exemplary lifestyle habits extend sexual function up to several years, but ultimately, they don’t protect elderly men from libido decline and erection loss.</li>
<p>You’re Never Too Old to Enjoy Great Sex</p>
<p>So somewhere between half and 90 percent of men over 65 suffer some level of ED. That's depressing. However, elderly couples who wish to remain sexual can still enjoy great sex and orgasms—if they make a few simple erotic adjustments:</p>
<li>Don’t take it personally. In the vast majority of older men, libido, and erection function decline. That’s life.</li>
<li>Instead of intercourse, orchestrate your lovemaking around leisurely, playful, whole-body touch: kissing, cuddling, mutual total-body massage, genital hand massage, oral sex, and sex toys (with plenty of lubricant).</li>
<p>I would love to hear from older men and women involved with them. What can you add about the real sex lives of men over 65?</p>
<p>Surprisingly few older men use erection drugs</p>

<p>Here are some of the things I hear from my menopausal clients about sex at <a>midlife</a>:</p>
<a>hormones</a> that keep the vagina supple and moist. This drop in hormones also means that the body isn’t prompting for sex like it used to. But a woman still needs to have regular
<a>marriage</a> counselors can also help. With a little support, couples can resolve painful sex and relational problems to have joyful
<a>intimacy</a> for the rest of their lives.
<a>divorced</a> or widowed women report a resurgence of desire as their new partners find them sexy and fascinating.
<a>orgasm</a> is still a powerful experience at midlife. And beyond that, they may relish the pleasure of arousal even as a stand-alone—sensual pleasure like hair-brushing, stroking, holding hands, and
<a>lying</a> together. More importantly, at midlife women are often unapologetic for insisting on that sexual satisfaction is mutual.

<h1> 5 Issues That May Contribute to Low Sexual Desire </h1>
<h2> You know what you like; you're just not asking for it. </h2>

<a>low sexual desire</a> at some point in their lives. In fact, low sexual desire is one of the most commonly presented sexual issues that women bring to
<sup>3</sup> Treating women with low sexual desire can be a complex undertaking, as a myriad of potential elements can impact desire, from personal experiences to social factors, cultural messages to relationship dynamics, and everything in between.
<p>The following is far from a complete list of what could contribute to low sexual desire, but it represents five of the most common reasons why women might experience a reduced interest in sex, and what to do to address them:</p>
<p>1. Your partner wants more sex than you do. </p>
<sup>5</sup> Although this term could apply to all couples at least some of the time, there are some couples that have more obvious and consistent differences in their levels of sexual desire.
<p>2. You don't give yourself enough time to get "in the mood." </p>
<sup>6</sup> In other words, many women don’t feel a sudden urge to have sex as they run from work to yoga class or while watching a true-
<a>crime</a> documentary on Netflix. Instead they respond to sexual cues in their environment and often take some time to "warm up" to the idea of sex.

<a>pregnancy</a> test to weaning an infant typically takes up to two years, and involves major relationship changes, some wonderful, others challenging. Unfortunately, most pregnancy guides don't have much to say about the
<a>sexual</a> issues of pregnancy and new
<a>parenthood</a>. That's why sex educators Anne Semans and Cathy Winks interviewed 700 women about sex during and after pregnancy for their book Sexy Mamas. Their book makes no claim to be representative, but it demonstrates that the conventional
<a>wisdom</a> is far from the whole story.
<p>But Semans and Winks found that pregnant women's feelings about sex vary tremendously. "Some experienced a sexual awakening," Semans says, "others felt turned off.</p>
<p>Men may also experience libido changes during the wife's pregnancy. Swedish researchers studied 112 pregnant couples. Some of the men loved sex with a pregnant wife, while others lost interest, especially during the third trimester.</p>
<p>One commonly reported benefit of pregnancy was better orgasms. Many pregnant women reported the most intense orgasms of their lives. Some women who had never had orgasms had them. And many said it was easier to come while pregnant.</p>
<p>Some people avoid sex during pregnancy for <a>fear</a> of harming the fetus. Relax. Authorities agree that even enthusiastic intercourse does not harm the baby.</p>
<p>However, some pregnancy complications warrant abstinence: placenta previa, multiple fetuses, serious uterine irritability, and high risk of prematurity.</p>
<a>Postpartum</a>, levels of two
<a>hormones</a> rise, prolactin and
<a>oxytocin</a>. "Both dampen libido," Winks explains. "Some women don't regain their pre-pregnancy libidos until they wean."
<p>Couples must also come to terms with breastfeeding. Some women fear their partners will be turned off by huge breasts dripping milk. Meanwhile, some men consider breast milk a turn-on.</p>
<p>Even if you're not having genital sex for a while, work to maintain a sensual connection. Kiss, hug, cuddle, and trade massages. Sex may be on hold, but most new parents find nonsexual affection reassuring as they adjust to being parents.</p>

<p> “Desire creates havoc when it is the</p>

<p> or when it is what’s missing.” </p>

<h1> When Partners Can't Agree on How Much Sex to Have </h1>
<h2> Rather than "compromising" or deciding who's "normal," there's a better way. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> The Fundamentals of Sex </li> <li> <a>Find a sex therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>As a sex therapist, I work with couples every week in which one partner wants more sex than the other. In heterosexual couples, about half of the higher-desire partners are female, and about half are male.</p>
<p>When it’s a small disparity, people generally work it out. But when one person wants sex twice a week and the other wants it twice a year, many couples simply can’t cope. And indeed, this is a difficult problem.</p>
<p>Ideally, couples would struggle over this together: What are we going to do about our problem?</p>
<p>Each one feels the other’s <a>sexuality</a> is problematic. And each person looks at the other and says what are you going to do about my pain that you've created?</p>
<p>I see how couples collapse over this. Sometimes the higher-desire person attacks the lower-desire one. Believe it or not, that doesn’t put the lower-desire one in a sexy mood.</p>
<p>People are also eager to tell me what they don’t want: to feel used, coerced, demeaned, guilty, awkward, or physically uncomfortable.</p>
<a>lonely</a>. Both the higher- and lower-desire partner typically agree. Helping people realize that both they and their partner feel similarly is an important part of the work.
<p>But what about sex? The higher-desire invariably asks how we’re going to arrange for more sex. That is going to be one of our goals, right? More sex, right?</p>

<p>Practically every higher-desire eagerly signs up for that. And that helps us get away from the simplistic goal of more-sex-that-neither-partner-enjoys.</p>
<p>At this point in the <a>therapy</a>, the lower-desire has started to have a little hope—maybe the entire focus of sessions won’t be on ramping up their desire for sex they don’t especially enjoy.</p>
<a>authenticity</a>, and a bunch of other stuff that may feel burdensome: “It’s not enough that I do it once in a while, now I have to smile and chat, too? Or initiate sex I don’t really want?”
<a>miscarriage</a>, a sister-in-law issue,
<a>parenting</a> conflicts, weight gain, where the dog sleeps, etc.), it has become more complicated than that.
<p>What certainly does not work is making your partner feel bad about themselves: criticizing, shaming, diagnosing, manipulating, avoiding, or punishing.</p>
<p>This may sound obvious, but every week I see couples in which people are doing exactly these things, hoping they will resolve the struggles over sex.</p>

<a>gender</a>, and what are other important factors that influence sexual desire in women. I hope to provide some clarity to these issues in this brief article.
<p>Defining Desire Disorder Contextually</p>
<a>low sexual desire</a> can feel
<a>shame</a> and feelings of inadequacy. Conflict can be ignited between partners as the result of infrequent sex and lack of female initiation. Men will complain that they "always" have to be the one that initiates and this get to be laborious. Men often
<a>fantasize</a>, possibly fed by ample images and scenarios from readily available
<a>intimacy</a>. Sorry men. However, the good news is that once conditions are favorable it appears that most women can become aroused and orgasm just fine. This fact calls for better
<a>attention</a> in the sexual dance to "fore-fore play," the relationship dynamics, lowering
