<h1> Four Things to Know About Psychiatry </h1>
<h2> Factors you may not see that impact rapport. </h2>
<p>Or at least that’s the <a>fear</a>.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Craig Sunter/Flickr</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>However, putting things into perspective can help clarify why your psychiatrist plays the role that he or she does, and what gets in the way of rapport-building. Here are four things about psychiatry I wish all patients could know:</p>
<p>1. Psychiatry is a frontier, and there are still many unknowns.</p>
<a>neuroscience</a> and related fields.
<p>This is why different psychiatrists might give the same person different diagnoses. This is why each patient’s treatment is highly individualized and often cannot be accurately cross-compared.</p>
<p>Psychiatry is still finding its way. But that need not be a reason to lose hope. Rather, it is an invitation for each psychiatrist-patient team to join together to optimize each patient’s treatment using their own experience as a guide.</p>
<p>2. Psychiatry is often asked to fix social ills—but that is beyond its scope.</p>
<a>politics</a> and the media. Although raising informed awareness of both issues is laudable, it would be a mistake to firmly connect the one with the other when
<a>evidence shows a much weaker link</a>. Doing so both further stigmatizes an already stigmatized population, and puts up psychological blinders that prevent us from asking deeper questions about the problem of violence in our society.
<p>Keeping that in mind can help to explain and lessen the frustration that both psychiatrists and patients experience when they are asked, as individuals, to cope with issues that are bigger than themselves.</p>
<p>3. Psychiatrists can do more than just prescribe medications.</p>
<a>psychotherapy</a>, among other things.
<p>But if that’s the case, why do patients sometimes get the impression that psychiatrists are only interested in prescribing medications?</p>
<p>There are many ways of approaching this question, but perhaps the most complete answer comes from the systems perspective. Consider the following factors of today’s mental health care system:</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Michael Chen/Flickr</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>1) With few exceptions, psychiatrists are the only mental health care providers who can prescribe medications.</p>
<p>2) There is a national shortage of psychiatrists.</p>
<p>3) As a general rule, psychiatrists are reimbursed by insurance at higher rates for <a>medication</a> visits than for therapy visits.</p>
<p>4) Medication visits are allotted a much shorter time than therapy visits.</p>
<p>4. The broken mental health care system frustrates psychiatrists, too.</p>
<a>burnout</a> is an epidemic problem, and it has the potential to
<a>compromise patient safety and care</a>.
<p>Nothing substitutes for a warm, caring, mutually respectful doctor-patient relationship. This is especially true for mental health, when the establishment of trust and rapport is so crucial to effective diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>But during the times when these are difficult to achieve, it may help to understand why—from a perspective that extends beyond the individual patient and psychiatrist, to the state of the field and the state of the system.</p>

<h1> Major Depressive Disorder Can Include Psychotic Features </h1>
<h2> Part 2: Identifying and understanding major depression subtypes. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Psychosis? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist to treat psychosis</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Psychotic features are present in approximately 20% of major depressive episodes. </li>
<li>These psychotic symptoms only occur while the person is depressed. </li>
<li>Common psychotic symptoms in depression include voices saying negative things or delusions of not being sure if they are alive or dead. </li>
<a>previous post</a>, readers were reacquainted with the basics of major depressive disorder (MDD). Today, we will start looking at the subtypes, beginning with major
<a>depression</a> with psychotic features. This means that, while depressed, the person experiences hallucinations/delusions.
<a>psychosis</a> means "abnormal condition of the soul (the essence of one's being)." This is most associated with schizophrenia, but psychotic symptoms occur across numerous disorders, as written about in The Many Faces of Psychosis.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Beatriz/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>PTSD</a>, and even some severe
<a>OCD</a> presentations can have delusional material. Psychosis is also present in
<ul><li>Voices saying demeaning things like, "You're no good and no one likes you!"</li> <li>Commands to hurt/kill themselves. </li> <li>Seeing demons or dark characters. </li> <li>Seeing/smelling rotting flesh on their body. </li> </ul>
<a>subconscious</a>'s way of trying to correct the depressed mood.
<p>Diagnostic protocol dictates that we not only note if psychotic features are present, but also if they are mood-congruent or incongruent.</p>
<h3>Assessing for hallucinations</h3>

<p>This is important because, if hallucinations (and/or delusions) are reported as occurring regularly regardless of mood, then it could be more indicative of a schizophrenia-spectrum condition called schizoaffective disorder.</p>
<p>In the end, there is no need to panic if someone says they hear voices. Many people do and have learned to manage them well, even sans medications. Exploring that further is part of our job as treatment providers.</p>
<p>A delusion is a fixed, false belief that is held with conviction. In other words, even if everyone else knows the belief is not true, the patient is convinced of it. Some examples of mood-congruent delusions include:</p>
<li>The patient is not sure if they are alive or dead. This is called a nihilistic delusion.</li>
<li>They feel they are such a bad person that they deserve <a>punishment</a> and people are plotting to destroy them; a sort of <a>paranoia</a>.</li>
<li>They come to believe they're an evil entity or are possessed.</li>

<h2> How We Control Our Emotions </h2>
<div> <h3> What are some basic ways of controlling emotions? </h3> </div>
<a>categories of emotion regulation</a> are reappraisal—changing how one thinks about something that prompted an emotion in order to change one’s response—and suppression, which has been linked to
<a>Other strategies</a> include selecting or changing a situation to influence one’s emotional experience, shifting what one pays
<a>attention</a> to, and trying to accept emotions.
<div> <h3> How can I learn to control emotional outbursts? </h3> </div>
<a>Practicing habits</a> such as
<a>mindful</a> acceptance of emotions, shifting attention away from the source of negative emotions, or reframing emotional situations (such as thinking about a setback or mistake as an opportunity to learn) may be helpful, and
<a>a trained therapist</a> could be
<a>a valuable partner</a> in enhancing emotional control. 
<div> <h3> How much can you really control your emotions? </h3> </div>
<a>it likely depends</a> on which aspect of emotional experience one tries to control: One may quickly experience an intense initial negative feeling but choose to
<a>reappraise</a> the cause of the feeling, or accept it and let it pass, averting further distress and negative behavior.

<a>be an “emotion coach,”</a> talking with children about their emotions and teaching them how to label their feelings, respond to them, and express them appropriately. 
<div> <h3> What is alexithymia? </h3> </div>
<a>studied as a trait</a> that differs between people. Researchers have reported that alexithymia is associated with distress and difficulty with emotion regulation.

<h2> Why Emotion Regulation Is Important </h2>
<div> <h3> What are the hardest emotions to control? </h3> </div>
<a>may be a sign</a> of a mental health condition such as borderline
<div> <h3> What are some consequences of poor emotional regulation? </h3> </div>
<a>fear</a>: harm to relationships from overreaction, unnecessary suffering, foregone opportunities that seemed too daunting. Certain ways of regulating emotion regulation, such as regularly
<a>bottling them in</a>, may also be associated with lower well-being and satisfaction with relationships.
<div> <h3> What makes controlling your emotions more difficult? </h3> </div>
<a>beliefs about negative emotions</a> (that they are bad, or that we’re not able to control them), a lack of emotion-regulation skills, or situations that evoke especially powerful emotions (which is why
<a>situation selection</a> is considered an emotion-regulation strategy). Uncertain or threatening conditions may make
<a>emotional "flooding"</a> and diminished control more likely.

<a>quit smoking</a>, we have to rewire all kinds of daily connections and impulses that trigger the craving for a cigarette. Although we don’t (yet) have tools to cure certain mental illnesses, such as
<a>depression</a> and anxiety, we can work to build stronger
<a>neural</a> connections that bypass or disrupt depressive or
<a>anxious</a> neural circuitry, which took weeks, months, or years to develop.
<p>Taking a Step-by-Step Approach</p>
<p>Consciously changing deeply wired-in responses is difficult, but it generally involves a clear step-by-step process:</p>
<li>Label the response we want to change.</li>
<li>Identify new responses we want to build.</li>
<li>Explore what quiets the undesirable signals and what amplifies neural signals in the desired circuits.</li>
<li>Find the energy and focus to repeatedly fire those new circuits so that they become hard-wired in our brain.</li>
<p>For example, suppose I become anxious at a restaurant when a server asks whether I’m ready to order. My step-by-step process for rewiring my brain to reduce anxiety in these situations may look like this:</p>

<li>The desired response is to review my choices and place my order calmly and confidently.</li>

<a>post</a>) is that one of the things the human brain is genetically programmed to respond more strongly to than just about anything else are social environmental cues. Particularly, we are highly programmed to be highly responsive to our primary
<a>attachment</a> figures. Another of the ongoing themes of this blog is the nonsensical practice of some researchers in
<a>psychiatry</a> of routinely labeling differences between various diagnostic groups and control subjects in size and activity levels of parts of the brain—as seen on brain scans such as fMRI scans—as abnormalities (See this

<p>LTP is associated with enhanced recycling of a part of the structure of the synapse, and this process could eventually result in the formation of a new, immature spine.</p>

<h1> Elements of a Good Psychiatric Evaluation </h1>
<h2> Here is what good psychiatrists should cover in an initial evaluation. </h2>

<p>If you think you might need <a>psychiatric</a> medications, here's the minimum of what the doctors should cover in a good evaluation. If they do not, it may be best to find another psychiatrist.</p>
<p>1. They should spend at least 45 minutes to an hour in the initial interview.</p>
<a>mood disorder</a> episode, your reactions to everyday
<a>stress</a> should also be completely different from your usual, baseline reactions (how you react to your environment when you are not in a mood episode). They should also be out of character for you—Jeckyl and Hyde territory.
<p>Mood and <a>anxiety</a> disorder diagnoses can not be made definitively if you are actively using psychoactive substances. Intoxication with drugs like cocaine can, for instance, mimic mania.</p>
<a>substance abuse</a>, panic attacks,
<a>OCD</a>, and self-injurious behavior.
<p>They should ask you about whether there is a family history (among blood relatives, not adoptive relatives) of psychiatric problems or substance abuse.</p>
<p>In particular, panic attack symptoms are often ignored or falsely classified as symptoms of a mood disorder.</p>
<p>This part of the history has almost disappeared from psychiatry, blurring the distinction between psychological reactions to trauma, stress or relationship problems, and major mental illnesses.</p>
<a>adverse childhood experiences</a> such as abuse, neglect, violence, substance abuse, or
<a>infidelity</a> by parents can put you at risk for personality problems, low moods, anxiety problems, or many other psychological symptoms. They can also make major psychiatric disorders worse without actually being the cause of them. Again, a
<a>traumatic</a> environment can trigger chronic problems that
<a>medication</a> can help, but
<a>boredom</a>, preoccupation with something, or a wide variety of other reasons. A good doctor will ask questions to rule out these causes rather than just throw dangerous and widely-abused stimulants like
<a>Adderall</a> (a methamphetamine clone) at you. (Stimulants [schedule II], unlike much less problematic drugs like valium [schedule IV], are classified by the DEA in the same "schedule" of abused drugs as opioids.)
