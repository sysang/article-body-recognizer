<h2> What does depression look like in children? </h2>
<h2> Do children get depressed if a parent is depressed? </h2>
<h2> Why do children get depressed? </h2>
<a>Abuse or neglect </a>are notable adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that can
<a>reset children’s stress response</a> so that even minor upsets can trigger depression. The loss of a parent or beloved caregiver is another source of depression in children, just as is the loss of a significant relationship among adolescents.
<a>Bullying is a form of abuse </a>that can give rise to depression in victims. Developmental and learning problems can severely affect children’s sense of self and pave the way for depression. The
<a>decline of free play</a> in childhood is another contributor to depression, and it deprives children of an important source of joy. Among teenagers, there is mounting evidence that
<a>social media can have profoundly negative effects on mental health, </a> especially among girls. Teens increasingly report they feel lonely; they spend more time communicating electronically, less time face-to-face interacting with friends.
<h2> How is depression best treated in children? </h2>
<a>some form of psychotherapy</a>, with or without medication. The younger children are, the more important it is for them to be treated in conjunction with a parent—dyadic therapy. There is evidence that therapy specifically focused on
<h2> Are antidepressant drugs safe for children? </h2>
<a>benefits of antidepressants </a>outweigh the risks. Antidepressants work best when their use is regularly monitored by a psychiatrist and the treated child is carefully observed by parents.
<h2> Do children ever outgrow depression? </h2>
<h2> What's the best way to help a child with depression? </h2>
<a>nurturing the parent-child bond</a>, but outdoor activity is itself beneficial and involves exposure to sunlight, a natural antidepressant.

<div> <div> <h1>Theories of Autism</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the diametric mind theory? </h3> </div>
<p>In this theory, there is a spectrum between hypomentalism, which manifests as autism, and hypermentalism, which manifests as psychosis. Between these poles are more common thinking styles that range from mechanistic to mentalistic. </p>
<p>The theory has its roots in how one’s genes are expressed: Autism results from greater paternal gene expression, and psychosis results from greater maternal gene expression.</p>
<div> <h3> What is the imprinted brain theory? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does the diametric mind theory explain savant syndrome? </h3> </div>
<a>savant syndrome.</a> By contrast, people prone to psychosis may also exhibit remarkable abilities, as increased mentalism may allow verbal and social skills to flourish.
<div> <h3> What evidence supports the diametric mind theory? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Who developed the diametric mind theory? </h3> </div>
<h2> The Extreme Male Brain </h2>
<p>Research from Baron-Cohen’s team suggests that people with autism may be exposed to more testosterone in utero, which could affect brain development. Other research, however, calls that hypothesis into question.</p>
<div> <h3> What do “systemizing” and “empathizing” mean? </h3> </div>
<p>Systemizing is the tendency to <a>organize the world into systems</a> or develop rules or principles to understand complex systems. Empathizing refers to social skills, understanding others’ emotions, and feeling sympathy and empathy.</p>
<div> <h3> Who developed the extreme male brain theory? </h3> </div>
<p>Previously Baron-Cohen had focused on <a>theory of mind</a> as it related to autism and published the book Mindblindness: An Essay on Autism and Theory of Mind in 1995.</p>
<div> <h3> What are critiques of the extreme male brain theory? </h3> </div>
<a>sex differences may not exist or be as substantial as needed</a> to support the theory—they may be very small. Assessment tools may also center around topics that boys are socialized to use, such as machines.
<div> <h3> How does the extreme male brain theory relate to the imprinted brain theory? </h3> </div>
