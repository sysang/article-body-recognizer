<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amanda Loudin</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 2:44 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The brainchild of team leader Philip Henderson, 58, the project is about “summiting Everest first,” and “everything else second.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But with 30 years of climbing, mountaineering and working in the outdoors industry, often as the only Black person in any group, Henderson sees the Everest expedition as a way to bring diversity and change to his chosen field.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>"The analogy I like to use is that there's a cruise ship that has been headed in one direction," he says. "It's time to turn it around."</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Racism of the Great Outdoors</p></div>
<div><p>Like others in the group, growing up, Saal was often the only Black rock climber. “I was exposed to climbing at age 12 through a local REI store. It was the first time I discovered this was something people did,” she says.</p></div>

<div><div><h3><div>The team</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Each team member has the experience to say that Everest is a challenge,” Henderson says, “but they all have the skills.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Scott will provide tech and logistics support at base camp.</p></div></div>
<div><p>It’s official: Mount Everest just got a little bit higher</p></div>
<div><div><p>Saal, on the other hand, is headed to the summit. While climbing Everest has not been a long-held personal goal, she says that the mountain is usually in the back of every climber’s mind.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Even people who don’t know much about the sport know Everest, and so I’m always asked if I plan to climb it,” she says. “When Phil called, I said yes immediately.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No matter who’s climbing or what their experience level is, Everest brings with it a unique set of risks — on average, about five climbers lose their lives there annually.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Complex plans</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Having the desire, skill and determination to climb Everest is just one part of the equation. Funding is another big piece of the puzzle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A standard supported climb can range from about $30,000 to $85,000 per person. For custom climbs, where you choose your teammates, guides and guide ratio, the price tag can run well over $100,000 per person.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To help defray those costs, Full Circle has lined up the support of several mountaineering brands although the group is still seeking donations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Among the brands supporting Full Circle are Perkins Coie, Hestra, North Face, Osprey Packs, Smartwool, MSR and the Greening Youth Foundation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Taylor says that as more people hear about the effort, interest and financial support has picked up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A month or so ago, things were kind of quiet,” he says. “But now we know we’re going to Everest. I’m happy to be part of a story that hasn’t been shared before.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Marisa Iati</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022|Updated January 3, 2022 at 6:10 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The last time anyone reported seeing 7-year-old Harmony Montgomery was Oct. 1, 2019 — more than two years before police say they learned she had disappeared from a home in southern New Hampshire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Manchester is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to Harmony’s recovery, and police are accepting tips at 603-203-6060. Local business executives are offering an additional $10,000 reward.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Police over the weekend visited a home on the city’s west side, where Aldenberg said Harmony was once seen. The current homeowner is unrelated to the case, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sorey often seemed worried about her daughter and frequently said she could not reach her, Miller said. He said he and his husband recently made their own effort to reach Harmony’s father through social media but did not hear back.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Miller said his family had not given up on reuniting Jamison and his sister.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We even still get Christmas gifts for her and stuff,” Miller said. “We’re holding on to the ones that we have right now because it’s that important for us to have that relationship.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>A 3-year-old disappeared from a playground a week ago. She’s still missing.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Manchester police have discussed the case with the FBI, which is not investigating, Aldenberg said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the division for children and families, declined to answer questions about the case.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harmony is described as White, about 4 feet tall and 50 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and glasses. She is blind in her right eye.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although more than two years has passed since Harmony disappeared, Aldenberg said, his department is operating under the assumption that she is alive.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I’m in rescue mode right now. This is not a recovery,” he said Monday. “All efforts are focused on that Harmony is alive, and we are going to do everything that we can to find her in that condition.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>The U.S. Navy combat ship that was sidelined by a coronavirus outbreak among its crew last month has returned to sea, even as some sailors on board remain positive for the virus, officials said on Monday.</p></div></div>
<a>reported</a> that about 25 percent of the ship’s sailors had tested positive.
<div><div><p>Officials said Monday that “all affected sailors exhibited mild or no symptoms.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Leadership decisions are informed by fleet medical and public health experts,” Meadows said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The ship was less than a week into its months-long <a>counternarcotics mission</a> in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific when virus infections forced the crew to pause.</p></div></div>
<p>“It is great to be heading back out to sea,” Cmdr. Brian Forster, the USS Milwaukee’s commanding officer, said in a statement. “The crew worked together as a team to ensure we are ready to conduct the mission.”</p>
<a>said they would offer coronavirus vaccine booster shots</a> to the crew. Even though the Navy has said it strongly recommends boosters and expects them to be required soon, they are not yet mandatory for the Milwaukee crew.

<header><div><h1>NASA hopes to hit an asteroid now in case we really need to knock one away later</h1></div></header>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div>By Bonnie Berkowitz</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Artur Galocha</div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Nov. 21, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>If all goes well, the spacecraft that NASA plans to launch Tuesday will smash itself to bits against an asteroid.</p>
<p>If all goes absolutely <i>perfectly</i>, that impact will jostle the asteroid into a slightly different orbit, meaning that for the first time, humans will have changed the trajectory of a celestial object.</p>
<p>Making history, however, is incidental. The real mission is to defend the planet.</p>
<p>Here’s how the $330 million Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) is supposed to work:</p>
<div><p>The spacecraft will be launched on a Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California as early as 10:20 p.m. Tuesday local time.</p></div>
<div><p>It will orbit the sun on a collision course that should reach the asteroids next fall, when they’ll be relatively close to Earth.</p></div>
<div><p>In the final hours, the craft will take over navigation and will steer itself.</p></div>
<div><p>With an hour to go, the 1,200-pound spacecraft will spot the moonlet and attempt to hit it head-on at 15,000 mph.</p></div>
<div><p>Just making contact with such a relatively small asteroid will be a scientific triumph.</p></div>
<div><p>NASA models indicate a solid whack should be enough to shorten the moonlet’s orbit time by about 1 percent, enough for telescopes on Earth to detect the change.</p></div>
<h2>The asteroids in our neighborhood</h2>
<p>Thousands of asteroids are large enough and come close enough to Earth’s orbit that researchers need to keep an eye on them.</p>
<p>[The chances of this asteroid hitting Earth are tiny, NASA says — but not zero]</p>
<p>Most of these known asteroids were identified by ground-based optical telescopes, and some were located by an infrared space telescope named NEOWISE that detected their heat signatures from its perch in low Earth orbit.</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of those are so small that they would burn up in Earth’s atmosphere if they came our way. But, of course, some asteroids are huge and dangerous — just ask any dinosaur.</p>
<p>The <i>unknown</i> ones are the wild cards.</p>
<p>“Some asteroids are sneaky, and they have orbits that make an asteroid very hard to find,” Chodas said.</p>
<p>The truck-size rock that caused a fireball and shock wave over Russia in 2013 arrived with no warning because it came from the direction of the sun, a huge blind spot for existing telescopes.</p>
<p>[Don’t panic: Scientists are practicing for a killer asteroid impact]</p>
<p>Fortunately, more high-powered eyes are on the way.</p>
<p>Amy Mainzer, principle investigator on the Surveyor team, said it should be able to spot a 460-foot asteroid from at least 50 million miles away.</p>
<p>Around the same time, a new ground telescope in Chile is expected to become operational with a massive 28-foot mirror that will be able to detect objects that are much fainter and farther away than any current ground telescope.</p>
<p>“The two together will get us to 90 percent very quickly,” Chodas said.</p>
<h2>Why NASA picked this asteroid</h2>
<p>The moonlet Dimorphos is an ideal target because of how ordinary it is and how extraordinary its location will be.</p>
<p>If the craft misses, the asteroid won’t be nearby again for decades.</p>
<h2>The tech that will be tested</h2>
<p>The DART spacecraft carries quite a bit of sophisticated equipment, including some that NASA is testing for future missions.</p>
<div><p><b>Rolled-up solar panels </b><i>Begin to unfurl about 1 hour 45 minutes after launch </i>Lightweight, flexible panels will unroll to power a next-generation thruster.</p></div>
<i>Takes first photos eight days after launch </i>Images will be sent to Earth and also will inform the craft’s navigation system. In the mission’s last few hours, the camera will shoot and transmit an image every second.
<div><p><b>Ion thruster </b><i>Fires up within a month after launch </i>DART mostly will be maneuvered by 12 hydrazine thrusters, which have guided spacecraft for decades. But it will flight-test a more efficient ion thruster as well.</p></div>
<i>Pops out 10 days before impact </i>A briefcase-size satellite provided by the Italian Space Agency will trail the spacecraft by about three minutes and photograph the crash and its aftermath with cameras named LUKE and LEIA.
<b>Autonomous navigation system </b>
<i>Kicks in about four hours before impact </i>Once the craft gets within about 50,000 miles of the target, object-tracking algorithms that evolved from missile defense will analyze camera images and take over the driving.
<h2>What’s next? We’ll see.</h2>
<p>Future techniques might include using gravity to tug asteroids out of orbit, zapping them with lasers, or even moving them with tractor beams, said NASA planetary defense officer Lindley Johnson said in a pre-mission news conference.</p>
<p>“This,” he said, “is just a start.”</p>
<p>Additional fact: Every person named in this story has an asteroid named for them, but none poses even a tiny threat to Earth.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joel Achenbach</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 25, 2021|Updated December 25, 2021 at 12:30 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>BALTIMORE — NASA’s revolutionary James Webb Space Telescope is hurtling away from Earth and toward deep space on a long-awaited, high-risk mission that, if successful, will look deeper into the cosmic past than any telescope before.</p>
<div><div><p>The Webb blasted off Christmas morning from the European Space Agency’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, on South America’s northeast coast, and early reports from NASA suggest the mission is going swimmingly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Though relieved by the successful launch, NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy acknowledged what everyone involved with the Webb knows: “We have some scary days ahead.”</p></div></div>
<a>long-delayed</a> successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. Officials had challenging discussions about launching on a holiday, and amid the rapid spread of the omicron variant of the
<a>coronavirus</a>, but decided to go on the first possible day. After two technical problems and one weather delay, that turned out to be Dec. 25.
<div><div><p>Melroy put a positive spin on it: “It’s not bad that it’s happening on Christmas Day, which should be a day of hope and inspiration.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Early reports indicated that everything was “nominal” — precisely the space-jargon term that the thousands of people who have worked on the mission were hoping to hear on launch day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was a perfect ride to orbit,” announced Rob Navias, NASA’s launch commentator.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There it is. There is your critical call. James Webb not only has legs, it has power,” Navias said. “Quite a Christmas present for the world’s astronomers.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At a news conference in Kourou after the successful launch, NASA science chief Thomas Zurbuchen highlighted that image of the telescope receding into space: “For me that picture will be burned into my mind forever.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More drama is coming, though.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The secondary mirror has to deploy, otherwise there’s nothing,” Hammel said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Carolyn Y. Johnson</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Joel Achenbach</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 8, 2021|Updated December 8, 2021 at 6:05 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>omicron variant</a> is emerging from the first burst of laboratory studies on the
<a>coronavirus</a>’s latest incarnation, showing that the mutated virus can
<a>slip past a shield of protection</a> provided by the standard two-shot vaccine regimen.
<a>Pfizer and its vaccine partner BioNTech</a>, point to a potential path for slowing omicron’s march:
<a> Booster shots</a> could help
<b> </b>control the variant by raising virus-fighting antibodies high enough to block the pathogen.
<a>people who have been infected with the coronavirus</a> and then get the two-shot regimen generate sufficient antibodies to keep omicron at bay.
<p>Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser for the pandemic, <a>said at a Washington Post Live event</a> that “the booster shot could be the answer to the challenge that we’re facing with the omicron.”</p>
<div><div><p>“So, if ever there was a clarion call for people who are not vaccinated to get vaccinated, and those who are vaccinated fully to get boosted, the new challenge with the omicron variant clearly is that,” Fauci said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For now, the laboratory studies outline a potential strategy with existing vaccines: Rely heavily on boosters.</p></div></div>
<a>Murrell did Tuesday afternoon</a>.
<div><div><p>Differences in the experiments and the blood samples being tested mean the public is on the cusp of being deluged with a host of confusing data points.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While scientists try to parse the factors that could account for differences, the general takeaway is that antibodies are definitely less adept at blocking omicron than other variants in a laboratory dish.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Özlem Türeci, chief medical officer of BioNTech, said the next steps in controlling the virus would involve expanding use of boosters globally.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Broad booster campaigns with the current version of our vaccine around the world could help to better protect people and get through the winter season,” Türeci said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One thing is clear: South African scientists’ decision to share their data openly, including the genetic sequence of omicron, helped researchers move at lightning speed in their quest to understand this latest threat.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Typically, scientists seeking to construct pseudoviruses — harmless replicas of the coronavirus — to perform their tests would have to wait for the blueprint of the new spike protein to be synthesized by companies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But many expected to see something similar to delta. Omicron was a whole new beast, surprising even the experts: It had dozens of mutations, not just a handful or two.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The more depressing part is the virus showing it can have a lot of changes, and so it does look like it’s more flexible than many of us expected,” Crotty said. “This isn’t over with omicron.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Another possibility is that omicron simply evolved in remote areas that have limited testing and genomic surveillance.</p></div></div>
<a>zoonosis</a>. In such a scenario, the coronavirus jumps from humans into an animal population, mutates over the course of many months, and then jumps back into humans in a form radically different from any variant previously identified.
<div><div><p>It probably won’t be the last time the genetic code of the coronavirus gets a rewrite.</p></div></div>

<a>restaurants</a> and grocery stores struggle to find workers — or, in the

<p>The one virtue of the extraordinarily rapid spread of omicron — infections from which are doubling every 2.1 days, according to data from the Houston Methodist hospital system — is that this winter surge may end quickly as well.</p>
<a>so transmissible</a> isn’t fully established, but
<a>immune evasion</a> is clearly a factor. Omicron has
<a>30 mutations</a> in the spike protein, the target of antibodies, whether generated through vaccination or prior infection. That makes omicron hard to neutralize with the front-line immune system defenses.

<div><div><p>“With omicron I suddenly feel like we aren’t going to escape it,” said Paola Kindred, 59, who lives in Minnesota and also contacted The Post seeking guidance.</p></div></div>

<div><p>“This is not a transient threat. SARS-CoV-2 will be with us 20 years from now,” Adalja said. “That’s what omicron represents — it’s the speeding up of what was inevitably going to happen.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>But while an explosion in mild omicron cases may not <a>fill up hospital beds</a>, it could render hospital employees unable to staff them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tracking the coronavirus vaccine</p></div>
<a>CDC analyzed modeling data</a> showing that omicron cases, in the agency’s words, “are likely to lead to a national surge in the coming weeks with peak daily numbers of new infections that could exceed previous peaks.”

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joel Achenbach</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 25, 2021|Updated December 25, 2021 at 12:30 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>BALTIMORE — NASA’s revolutionary James Webb Space Telescope is hurtling away from Earth and toward deep space on a long-awaited, high-risk mission that, if successful, will look deeper into the cosmic past than any telescope before.</p>
<div><div><p>The Webb blasted off Christmas morning from the European Space Agency’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, on South America’s northeast coast, and early reports from NASA suggest the mission is going swimmingly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Though relieved by the successful launch, NASA Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy acknowledged what everyone involved with the Webb knows: “We have some scary days ahead.”</p></div></div>
<a>long-delayed</a> successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. Officials had challenging discussions about launching on a holiday, and amid the rapid spread of the omicron variant of the
<a>coronavirus</a>, but decided to go on the first possible day. After two technical problems and one weather delay, that turned out to be Dec. 25.
<div><div><p>Melroy put a positive spin on it: “It’s not bad that it’s happening on Christmas Day, which should be a day of hope and inspiration.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Early reports indicated that everything was “nominal” — precisely the space-jargon term that the thousands of people who have worked on the mission were hoping to hear on launch day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was a perfect ride to orbit,” announced Rob Navias, NASA’s launch commentator.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There it is. There is your critical call. James Webb not only has legs, it has power,” Navias said. “Quite a Christmas present for the world’s astronomers.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At a news conference in Kourou after the successful launch, NASA science chief Thomas Zurbuchen highlighted that image of the telescope receding into space: “For me that picture will be burned into my mind forever.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More drama is coming, though.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The secondary mirror has to deploy, otherwise there’s nothing,” Hammel said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Melroy echoed that: “When we see things with a new lens, we gain new knowledge and new perspectives that can change fundamentally how we see the universe and how we see ourselves.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The journey to L2 will take about 29 days. Along the way, the Webb will undergo course corrections and critically important deployments of its hardware, including a sun shield the size of a tennis court.</p></div></div>
<div><p>After the sun shield opens up, NASA will send a command from Earth to unfold 18 gold-plated, hexagonal mirrors, which together will function as a 21-foot light bucket, nearly three times the diameter of the Hubble’s mirror.</p></div>
<div><div><p>This is a novel design, driven by ambitious scientific objectives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>NASA and its partners must overcome 344 potential single-point failures, according to an independent review board. That list began with launch, although the Ariane 5 has an excellent track record.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Zurbuchen, who was in French Guiana for the launch, said last month that the agency has tested the telescope and its instruments thoroughly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve gone through every systematic analysis that we can think of,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is designed to see the oldest stars in the universe and scrutinize the formation of the earliest galaxies. It will also study the atmospheres of exoplanets that orbit stars in our galaxy.</p></div></div>
<a>Europa </a>and Saturn’s moon
<a>Enceladus</a>, both of which have geysers believed to signal the presence of subsurface oceans.
<div><div><p>“If we can put our beam there and detect organics in this plume material, that may give us clues to the habitability of subsurface oceans,” Hammel said.</p></div></div>

<h1>NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope launches, will open a new window on the cosmos — if everything goes just right</h1>
<h2>The successor to the Hubble must evade 344 potential ‘single point failures’ to achieve its ambitious mission</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joel Achenbach</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Updated Dec. 25 at 1:28 p.m.Originally published Dec. 22, 2021</div></div></div>
<div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope will ascend to orbit in the payload section of an Ariane 5 rocket and unfold to its full size once it reaches orbit.</p></div>
<div><p>The centerpiece of the telescope is a 21-foot-diameter mirror assembly, nearly three times the size of the mirror aboard the Hubble Space Telescope it’s meant to replace.</p></div>
<div><p>Hubble was designed to be delivered to orbit, fully assembled, in the cargo bay of a space shuttle. The assembled Webb telescope would be far too large to be carried by any existing launcher and so must reach space folded.</p></div>
<div><p>The Webb telescope’s sensitive instruments must be kept super-cold to function. The telescope is therefore equipped with a large sun shield.</p></div>
<div><p>Made of silicon and insulating Kapton foil, it shades the telescope not just from the sun’s heat but from the reflected warmth of the Earth and the moon as well.</p></div>
<div><p>The light from distant galaxies will collect in the Webb’s main mirror and then focus on the secondary mirror. The concentrated light will then stream to the telescope’s instrument module to be interpreted.</p></div>
<div><p>The processed images will then stream to Earth via the telescope’s Earth-pointed antenna.</p></div>
<p>NASA actually has an answer to that question: This mission is vulnerable to, and therefore must avoid, 344 potential “single-point failures,” according to an independent review board.</p>
<p>“If I’m not nervous, I’m not realistic,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, head of science at NASA. “This is a complex mission. There is no way of making this simple.”</p>
<p>If something causes a further delay, there will be launch windows every morning, lasting 30 minutes, until Jan. 6, when the moon will cruise into the picture and create a gravitational disruption for a week.</p>
<p>Beyond the shimmying and twirling, the observatory is not fixable. There is nothing that can be yanked out and replaced with something new.</p>
<p>The only exception is fuel. The observatory uses fuel to maneuver and to point at interesting targets. It has enough fuel to operate for roughly 10 years. In theory, it could be refueled with a robotic spacecraft, which would extend the mission.</p>
<p>There is no spaceship that can send astronauts to such a distant place and bring them safely home. To dream up such a mission would be prohibitively costly and risky. It would make more sense to build and launch a new telescope.</p>
<h3>‘As good as it gets’</h3>
<p>But telescopes traditionally have been named after scientists like Hubble. NASA is developing another space telescope named for the pioneering astronomer Nancy Grace Roman, the first female executive at NASA and first chief of astronomy.</p>
<p>But after a review by the agency’s history office, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the agency found no evidence warranting a name change for the telescope.</p>
<h3>Weddings, funerals and a telescope</h3>
<p>“Arguably, it’s one of the most complex missions NASA’s ever done,” Menzel said.</p>
<p>It’s also one of the most protracted. Menzel has been working on the Webb for 24 years. There’s a whole community of people who have put in that kind of generational labor on this telescope.</p>
<p>“We’ve watched our kids grow up, we’ve gone to weddings, we’ve gone to funerals. After 24 years, it would not be incorrect to say we’re an extended family,” Menzel said.</p>
<p>How does a NASA engineer, or scientist, or administrator, or even some astronomer on the far side of the world who is invested in this mission get through the gut-churning anxieties of launch and deployment? By trusting the process.</p>
<p>Everyone has been asking Mather, the senior project scientist, if he’s worried in advance of the launch, according to a NASA blog devoted to the Webb.</p>
<p>But deploying the Webb and making it operational is perhaps a greater challenge.</p>
<p>“We have two months of terror, not seven minutes,” said Grunsfeld,<b> </b>the former NASA science administrator.</p>
<p>Hammel, the astronomer, compares this moment to being in an orchestra in the seconds before a performance.</p>

<div><h1>Coronavirus risk calculations get harder as a study suggests rapid tests may be less effective at detecting omicron</h1></div>
<h2>Fauci draws a line on New Year’s Eve parties — no big crowds, and moderate the ‘hugging and kissing’ </h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Joel Achenbach</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Yasmeen Abutaleb</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 29, 2021 at 7:25 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>As the coronavirus spawns a record-breaking wave of infections, new research suggests that rapid tests widely used to identify potential covid-19 cases might be less effective at identifying illness caused by the swiftly spreading omicron variant.</p>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>The finding is the latest complication for anyone trying to strike a common-sense balance between being vigilant and <a>returning to normalcy</a> as the country approaches the third year of the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<a>new guidance</a> that lowered the isolation recommendations for people infected with the coronavirus, and who are asymptomatic or showing improvement in symptoms, from 10 days to five.
<a>less likely to cause severe illness</a>, Anthony S. Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser for the pandemic, said Wednesday in an interview with The Post.
<div><div><p>But for people who are unvaccinated and have not been infected previously, he cautioned, “It is not going to be just a common cold.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So what about New Year’s Eve? Party? No party? Fauci’s guidance is to keep it small, ideally with family and close friends known to be vaccinated and prudent in their behavior.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You can’t ask the American public to lock themselves in their closet alone for New Year’s Eve. Because that’s the only way you’re going to be completely without risk,” he said.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>the decision was based on a growing body of science, as well as internal agency modeling, showing that people are most infectious over a five-day period that starts about two days before symptoms. Transmissibility drops dramatically after that.
<div><div><p>Some outside experts also have questioned why the CDC is not calling for people to have a negative test — a rapid test or a PCR test — before exiting isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We actually don’t know how well it works and its predictive value when we use it as an individual test for the purposes of transmissibility later in disease,” Walensky said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We haven’t used all the tools we have to allow people to adjust the measures they should be taking based on their individual risk,” Gottlieb said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>‘Crazy’ omicron surge could peak soon, but the virus is unpredictable as the pandemic enters its third year</h1></div>
<h2>Columbia University researchers estimate infections could top out during the week of Jan. 9 </h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joel Achenbach</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 30, 2021 at 7:03 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> variant’s spread — and who are hoping this wave ebbs just as quickly.
<div><div><p>Some forecasts suggest coronavirus infections could peak by mid-January.</p></div></div>
<div><p>No one on that day could have known that this pathogen, initially called the “novel coronavirus” and later named SARS-CoV-2, would trigger the most brutal pandemic in a century. And no one today knows when it will be over.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Forecasts of how the pandemic will play out have repeatedly been incorrect, to the point that some modelers have stopped trying to make caseload projections four weeks out, instead limiting their forecasts to one week ahead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because beyond a week, who knows?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Shaman estimates the number of infections is four to five times the official count. Given that people remain infected for many days, that translates to many millions of active infections across the United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re talking somewhere up to maybe 10 million people,” Shaman said. “Maybe not all of them are contagious yet. Crazy numbers. Crazy, crazy numbers.”</p></div></div>
<a>Forecasts</a> posted Monday by the CDC show national hospitalization rates rising steadily in the weeks ahead, with daily new hospital admissions topping 15,000 by mid-January — although the projections from different research teams varied widely.
<div><div><p>The predictions of a short omicron surge are reflected in hopes expressed at the highest level of the federal medical bureaucracy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Fauci and other experts have consistently been surprised by the mutability of the virus. Some scientists did not think a variant with the number of mutations evident in omicron could be an effective transmitter.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“We are dealing with a virus that has a completely unanticipated level of transmissibility,” Fauci said. “We thought delta was very transmissible. This thing is like something we’ve never seen before.”</p></div>
<p>In the United States, vaccinations — including boosters — have blunted much of the impact of the latest wave of infections from the omicron variant, which appears to be innately less capable of<b> </b>generating severe disease.</p>
<div><div><p>But a more spontaneous shutdown has been underway since just before Christmas.</p></div></div>
<a>new phase of the pandemic</a>, one with sweeping disruptions but probably not the same level of fear and anxiety as earlier periods.
<p>Scientists don’t know precisely why omicron tends to cause less severe illnesses than delta or other variants of the coronavirus. It is likely that immunity plays a role, as so many people have been infected previously or have been vaccinated.</p>
<div><div><p>That appears to have been the case in South Africa, hard hit by the virus in advance of the omicron wave.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The dam has broken with a milder variant. Most people who made the correct choice to get vaccinated are protected from severe disease,” said David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“By the second week of January, we’re going to see the national declines, but there will be some areas struggling for sure,” Rubin said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A model from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington puts the peak of this winter wave at Feb. 6, with 408,000 confirmed new daily infections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pandemic models are hampered by the difficulty of amassing reliable data. Testing is disrupted during the holidays. There are only rough estimates of how many people have already been infected.</p></div></div>
<a> looser rather than tighter guidelines</a> on the isolation time for people infected with the virus, reducing the recommendation from 10 days to five.
<div><div><p>That covers people who are asymptomatic or are seeing their symptoms improve. The CDC’s guidance does not advise that people get a negative test before leaving isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The virus has never been a static agent, nor is society a monolith, and so any forecast of what will happen in the coming weeks needs to be written with a pencil — not a pen.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Shaman, the Columbia epidemiologist, acknowledges that the model he and his colleagues have developed is based on incomplete data and must take into account a new variant that remains somewhat enigmatic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And the virus itself may have new moves not yet anticipated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m not a betting person on this thing, ever,” Shaman said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>NASA thrilled: Webb Space Telescope deploys sun shield, evades many potential ‘single-point failures’</h1></div>
<h2>So far, so good for revolutionary telescope heading toward deep space, but challenges remain</h2>

<a>344 potential single-point failures </a>on this complex mission.
<div><div><p>The mission has had a couple of hiccups.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All the major deployments to date — including that of the solar arrays needed to power the observatory — have gone splendidly, Durning said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am thrilled,” he said. “I’ve been on the job 15 years. To see it unfurl in space, it’s awe-inspiring.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the sun shield deployment was complete Tuesday, he texted a postscript: “15 years of anticipation of this moment and it did not disappoint.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Webb, and the Webb Team, is doing great on deployments!” Garth Illingworth, an astronomer at the University of California at Santa Cruz, said by email early Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are not out of the woods yet for JWST, but we have made wonderful progress. Kudos to the amazing engineers!” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Keith Parrish, observatory manager for the telescope at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said: “We’ll take each of our deployments as a touchdown. But the game is still going.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The delta variant of the coronavirus has been overtaken by omicron — now the dominant strain in the United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>However, that does not mean delta will not continue to circulate.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</p></div>
<a>had believed</a> that any future “variant of concern” was likely to be a descendant of the delta variant.
<b> </b>But the newest variant,
<a>known by the Greek letter omicron</a>, is not a delta offspring, coming from a different portion of the virus’s family tree. It was identified in November in southern Africa and cases have since been confirmed in dozens of countries —
<a>including the United States</a>.
<div><div><p>“The delta variant is showing every day its willingness to outsmart us and to be an opportunist in areas where we have not shown a fortified response against it,” Walensky said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are answers to common questions about the delta variant and how people can help protect themselves during the pandemic.</p></div></div>
