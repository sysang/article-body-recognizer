<div><div><p>Johnson also said that from Jan. 11, England will scrap the requirement for asymptomatic people who test positive with a lateral flow test to follow up with a PCR test.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>SYDNEY — When tennis star Novak Djokovic arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, he stepped off the plane into a different country than the one where he’d won the Australian Open a year earlier.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Rules are rules’: Australia cancels Novak Djokovic’s visa amid vaccine exemption uproar</p></div>
<div><p>After initially distancing himself from the saga, Prime Minister Scott Morrison seemed to embrace his government’s decision to turn away the tennis player, who he said lacked a medical exemption required of unvaccinated visitors.</p></div>
<a>bungled vaccine rollout</a> to a diplomatic
<a>spat with France</a> to its latest handling of an omicron surge, ahead of what is expected to be a tight electoral contest between Morrison’s conservative coalition and the opposition Labor party.
<div><p>Novak Djokovic’s vaccine exemption for Australian Open is met with skepticism</p></div>
<a>Indian cricketers</a> were able to visit last year. Djokovic was one of several dozen overseas tennis players allowed in a year ago for the Australian Open, which he won for the third year in a row.
<div><div><p>But a lot has changed in the past 12 months, said Steve Georgakis, an expert in the history and sociology of sport at the University of Sydney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With relatively few cases and a sports-mad populace, Australia carved out exceptions early in the pandemic to keep the games going even as most industries ground to a halt, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our sport in many ways continued uninterrupted,” he said. “It’s this great unifier of who we are, it brings people together, and it has brought our nation together.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Allowing big business to break the rules is not what Australian sport is all about,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other big change is that after a slow start, roughly 94 percent of eligible Australians are vaccinated, leaving little popular sympathy for Djokovic, who has said he <a>opposes vaccination</a> and vaccine mandates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That Djokovic was arriving in Melbourne, which has endured more time in lockdown than any other city on earth and seen the most deaths in Australia, added to the outrage.</p></div></div>
<a>movie posters</a> about people trapped at airports. One satirical website
<a>quipped</a> that Djokovic had instead decided to enter a tournament on Manus Island, where Australia detained asylum seekers.
<div><div><p>The initial decision to grant the tennis star a visa “didn’t pass the pub test,” meaning the average Australian wouldn’t agree with it, said Georgakis.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘A search for villains’: As Australia’s outbreak grows, so does covid shaming</p></div>
<div><div><p>The government “really misunderstood the Djokovic situation,” he said. “They look really silly now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While unvaccinated Australians are allowed to return to the country (with two weeks in hotel quarantine), visa holders must be vaccinated or have a medical exemption.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Morrison said Thursday that Djokovic did not have a “valid” medical exemption, suggesting that authorities in Victoria state, where Melbourne is located, and Tennis Australia were responsible for the mix-up.</p></div></div>
<p>“All I can say is that the evidence [for] medical exemption that was provided was found to be insufficient,” the prime minister said. But Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley shot back, saying his state wasn’t to blame.</p>
<div><div><p>“Someone issued Novak a visa, and it wasn’t the Victorian government,” Foley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government is now taking heat from Serbia, Djokovic’s home country, a few months after an embarrassing fallout with France over a canceled submarine deal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic is reportedly being held at a Melbourne hotel where detained asylum seekers have complained of maggots, though Minister for Home Affairs Karen Andrews refused to say where he was on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<p>The tennis star’s attorneys on Thursday won a last-minute bid to prevent his deportation, with a judge approving a temporary injunction that allows Djokovic to stay in Australia until at least Monday, when a further hearing will take place.</p>
<div><div><p>Djokovic has won the Australian Open nine times, more than any other player, and is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most Grand Slam titles. At the moment, his bid to break that record has been slammed shut.</p></div></div>

<div><p>The race to untangle the secrets of rare, severe blood clots after Johnson Johnson vaccination</p></div>
<div><p>Another option, according to a federal official familiar with the situation, would be to recommend the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines over the Johnson Johnson product, making what is known as a preferential recommendation.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Any changes in the vaccine’s use would likely apply to both the initial single shots and boosters, said a second clinician knowledgeable about Thursday’s meeting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Such a recommendation would have to be endorsed by CDC Director Rochelle Walensky to become an official recommendation of the agency.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>FDA and the CDC added language to fact sheets and guidance for physicians to make women younger than 50 aware of the rare risk and the availability of other coronavirus vaccines.
<div><p>By far the greatest number of vaccine doses administered in the United States have been the Pfizer and Moderna products, totaling about 468 million doses, according to the CDC. About 17 million doses of Johnson Johnson have been given.</p></div>

<b> </b>to reassess its guidance about what people should do to avoid spreading the virus to others, and to safely return to school and work to keep society functioning.
<div><div><h3><div>What did the CDC recommend?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>well-fitting masks for an additional five days.
<div><p>With omicron, many vaccinated Americans will at some point test positive. Here’s what to do.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What does it mean to go into isolation?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How long should someone with a coronavirus infection stay isolated?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months and should not delay the end of isolation. People still need to wear a well-fitting mask around others at home and in public for five days after ending isolation.
<div><div><h3><div>Why did the guidance change from 10 days to five days?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>they experience their first symptoms and declining within several days. Some reports suggest omicron has a shorter incubation period — that is, the time between someone becoming infected and showing
<b> </b>symptoms — than previous variants.
<div><div><h3><div>Why isn’t the CDC requiring a test to end isolation?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Asked at a briefing why the CDC updated its guidance on Jan. 4 to say that people with access to rapid tests could use them before coming out of isolation, Walensky said the agency was simply responding to questions from the general public.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>What has been the reaction to the guidance?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>In particular, the group strongly endorsed requiring a negative test before someone who has previously tested positive can end isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Shortly after the guidance was posted online, Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, said he agreed with it, except that he would recommend that people get a negative test before ending isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Why are the isolation recommendations the same for those who are unvaccinated, vaccinated and boosted?</div></h3></div></div>

<p>Much of the debate Wednesday by CDC panel members centered on whether to give a full-throated endorsement to booster shots for adolescents by recommending that they <i>should</i> get them, as opposed to recommending they <i>may </i>get them.</p>
<div><div><p>Several panel members supported a strong recommendation for the shots because of the omicron surge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I believe in the vaccine, I believe that it has been safe, I believe that we can prevent serious infection,” said Pablo Sanchez, a pediatrics professor at Ohio State University.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I think we need to highlight that children are not okay,” said Kathy Poehling, a professor of pediatrics at Wake Forest School of Medicine. “Covid is overwhelming our hospitals and our children’s hospitals.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>But as more information emerges on the potential impact of omicron in children, parents’ attitudes toward vaccinating their teenagers and younger children may change, CDC official Sara Oliver said.</p></div></div>
<p>FDA officials have said the agency broadened access to boosters this week because real-world data and laboratory tests indicate the shots significantly strengthen protection, especially against the omicron variant, while posing minimal risk.</p>
<div><div><p>Officials cited data from Israel that found no new safety concerns when more than 6,000 youngsters ages 12 to 15 got a Pfizer booster five months after their second dose. There were no new cases of heart-related complications.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div>By Hannah Sampson2:40 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<div><div><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that all travelers — even those who are vaccinated — should avoid cruises.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement, the agency said cruise lines reported 5,013 cases of coronavirus infection on ships operating in U.S. waters between Dec. 15 and 29, a massive increase from the 162 cases reported over the previous two weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The CDC escalated the travel health notice for cruising from Level 3 to 4, its highest. Previously, the advice was that people who were not fully vaccinated or those at increased risk of severe illness should not cruise.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This reflects increases in cases onboard cruise ships since identification of the Omicron variant,” the CDC said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The update comes as 91 ships carrying passengers from U.S. waters have reported cases over the past seven days and met the threshold for CDC investigation.</p></div></div>
<h2>New York’s mayor-elect to keep city’s first-in-nation vaccine mandate for private sector</h2>Return to menu
<div><div><div>By Kim Bellware2:10 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<div><div><p>New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams said he will keep in place the city’s recent vaccine mandate for private employers, extending a plan that has rankled some in the business community.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At a news conference Thursday, Adams (D) announced his intent to continue the mandate that was imposed by outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) and took effect Dec. 27.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Covid is a formidable opponent … but we’re going to have a formidable response,” Adams said, leaving New York City Health Commissioner Dave A. Chokshi to make the actual announcement about the mandate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The private-sector employer mandate will stay in effect in the new year, with a focus on compliance, not punishment,” Chokshi said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>De Blasio announced the first-in-the-nation private-sector vaccine mandate just as cases of the omicron variant were starting to surge, expanding on an October mandate that applied to all employees of New York City.</p></div></div>
<p>The private-sector rule requires every business in New York with more than one employee to verify that all on-site workers have been vaccinated; the mandate does not apply to people working remotely or those with religious or medical exemptions.</p>
