<h1> Groundhog Day Relationships </h1>
<h2> Has your partnership lost its sparkle? </h2>

<a>therapy</a>, hoping still that they can make it work, or, at least, part without acrimony. Sometimes with
<a>anger</a> or, at other times, in
<a>grief</a>, they turn to me to help them make that decision. Would it be worth it to invest the time, energy, and money to try to thrive again, are or the patterns too set, their hearts too broken, or too much damage done?
<p>If you are suffering from a Groundhog Day stuck relationship, this is the way to begin.</p>
<p>Go over the next eight descriptions of your relationship and score each 1 to 10, 1 being the best score, and 10 being the worst. Then add up your total score and find the category that best describes where your relationship stands.</p>
<li>8-20 = You’re in pretty good shape, but probably need to recommit to who you once were and want to be again.</li>
<li>21-35 = You’re not likely investing much energy or prime time in each other and letting other priorities take precedence.</li>
<li>36-50 = You’re in potential trouble, living more parallel rather than intertwined and being your most successful self elsewhere.</li>
<li>51-65 = You’re sharing only the logistics of maintaining your partnership, responding to each other with worn-out phrases and behaviors that take almost no thought or emotion.</li>
<li>66-80 = You are on a dangerous trajectory of becoming totally unimportant to one another and need an emotional and physical transfusion to avoid lasting damage.</li>
<p>1. Repeated Unsuccessful Phrases and Behaviors</p>
<a>body language</a>, voice intonations, facial expressions, and rhythms so predictable that you’ve ceased to even notice or react to them?
<p>When words and behaviors are endlessly repeated and unaltered, many partners are no longer able to authentically connect. Now, instead of reaching to talk to each other, they talk at each other, uninterested and unchallenged by the responses.</p>
<p>Are either of you noticeably animated around other people in dramatic contrast to your <a>boredom</a> with each other? Given the hypothetical question, would you date each other again if you had the opportunity today?</p>
<p>When interest, excitement, and energy fades in a relationship, some couples increase the drama between them to substitute for their lost <a>intimacy</a>. At a trigger point of bored desperation, they are easily set off.</p>

<p>How do you react to each other when you are frustrated, in pain, or feeling abandoned when you need the other? When you do respond negatively to each other, is there any resolution?</p>
<p>Checking out the intensity, duration, and frequency of the negative reactions happening to you, would you say they are getting worse? Do you feel so allergic to each other that even the slightest irritations are now causing major reactions?</p>
<p>The partners in stuck relationships rarely touch each other, either by kind words or physical connection.</p>
<a>sexual</a> connection? Are you still making love, or just interacting to get the job done?
<p>When affection is gone, so is <a>empathy</a>. It is common to see one partner ignoring the other’s expressions of vulnerability or need as if waiting for the emotion to dispel without the need to respond anymore.</p>
<p>5. Evaporated <a>Dreams</a></p>
<a>ethics</a> they have chosen to mutually honor.
<p>When crises strike, couples who are deeply connected help each other shore each other up and reach to go beyond the sorrows they are encountering.</p>
<p>There are many ways that couples show their trust in each other, but there is one special way that is crucial to the relationship’s success, especially when times are hard and resources are scant.</p>
<p>That core of trust is the criss-cross relationship of mutual symbolic parent/child havens. Each partner can count on the other partner to care, protect, and nurture him or her when maturity defies and needs feel they come from a young place.</p>
<p>They are fully aware that they cannot make up for lost nurturing in each other’s childhoods, but they recognize that a need for a non-judgmental haven must be met when needed, and there is no hesitation to provide it.</p>
<p>Score: ­­­___</p>
<a> reach out to a qualified professional</a>. Very often, just the re-infusion of a new perspective will be enough to help you regain the
<a>motivation</a> and commitment you’ve lost.

<h2> Here's how to cope with re-entry dating anxiety. </h2>
<li>Isolation during the COVID pandemic has increased people's anxiety about socializing in general—let alone while dating.</li>
<li>Reflecting on what you learned about yourself during this time can help you put your best foot forward when you start dating again.</li>
<li>Understanding that others may also be experiencing anxiety and fear can help reduce your stress and forge more genuine connections.</li>
<p>Dating in the era of multimedia technology is a challenge in and of itself. But navigating the limitations that the pandemic has forced upon relationship-seekers has not been easy.</p>
<p>Many of my patients have told me how nervous they are about moving out into the dating world again. Virtual reality, no matter how accurate it is in representing the real world, cannot fully prepare people for what they will experience. </p>
<a>risk-taking</a>. Where the availability of multiple possibilities helps accurate discernment, the lack of those opportunities can lead to more dangerous choices.
<a>fantasies</a>. Transitioning from self-to-self to self-in-the-presence-of-others is both a challenging and anxiety-producing process.
<p>As a result of this unnatural situation, this re-entry dating anxiety is totally understandable and shared by many others. Without the continuity they have depended upon, they must now start over without knowing what new skills they will need.</p>
<h3>Navigating successful re-entry into the dating pool</h3>
<p>There are five steps to this process:</p>
<li>Honestly and non-judgmentally assess who you used to be before you were cut off from the natural exploration of relationships.</li>
<li>Fully understand how you feel about who you’ve become during your dating isolation.</li>
<li>Thoroughly re-educate yourself as to how the dating world has actually changed while you’ve been absent.</li>
<li>Prepare to re-emerge as your best self.</li>
<li>Re-enter with a cautious spirit of adventure and the courage to be a novice again</li>
<h3>Step 1: Who were you before you left the dating scene?</h3>
<a>forgiving</a> of your past errors and can present yourself as more desirable than you were before.
<h3>Step 2: Who have you become during your isolation?</h3>
<a>distrust</a> and decreased comfort with others.
<a>openness</a> to welcoming others’ experiences.
<a>depressed</a>. Those disparaging feelings destroy
<a>fear</a> taking the chance of that happening.
<h3>Step 3: Reeducating yourself about the current dating world</h3>
<p>Not having the opportunity to mix with others in real-time, many people re-entering the dating world have only virtual experience to compare who they are from what is currently available and successful behaviors in the dating world.</p>
<p>Many also have not had the courage to share their negative experiences with others for fear of being seen as less successful in adapting. They often don’t realize that so many are feeling the same way, similarly fearful of being vulnerable.</p>
<h3>Step 4: Getting yourself ready to emerge</h3>
<a>sexual</a> interactions when they have lost touch of the difference between
<a>self-pleasuring</a> and love-making with a partner. I often hear the same question: “What will it feel like to be intimate again, to talk with another without distrust or fear of being uninteresting?”
<h3>Step 5: Stepping courageously into the unfamiliar</h3>
<p>What is important is to not let those fears stop you. Courage is acting in the face of fear. It is the willingness to take risks, to reach out for help, to authentically share, and to take pride in your newly emerging self.</p>

<p>What makes people continue to be drawn to these heartbreaking, futile relationships? What is it about their partners' agonizing struggles that repeatedly pull them back for hopeless outcomes? What drives them to keep trying?</p>
<p>There are many reasons, but the following six are some of the most common. If you recognize yourself in any or many of them, you can learn to stay away from these painful and frustrating relationships.</p>

<li>Loneliness is best conceived as an unmet social need, which humans are fundamentally driven to correct through relationships.</li>
<li>Business opportunities are opened when this social need is not met through organic interactions and friendships.</li>

<h1> Loneliness Is a Killer. Why Don't We Talk About It? </h1>
<h2> Ignoring loneliness is self-defeating and hazardous to our health. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Understanding Loneliness </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>“<a>Loneliness</a> is a killer,” a friend recently wrote to me. We’ve all felt it, but we don't like to admit it.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pexel</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>grief</a>, and like several others, I cried throughout the entire service.
<a>shame</a> is often not only the explanation for our loneliness but also the reason we do nothing about it. We isolate ourselves because we also are ashamed of being lonely.
<a>Denial</a> of loneliness can be horribly self-defeating.
<p>Loneliness comes when our relationships with others are not meeting our expectations. Having a lot of friends, as I did, did not protect me from loneliness. You need a special friend or friends with whom you can share your darkest secrets.</p>
<p>The internet is a blessing and a curse in this regard; it can be used as a tool to engage with others, or it can become a way to avoid intimate connection with others. Online relationships are not a substitute for face-to-face ones.</p>
<p>The keys to fighting loneliness are:</p>
<ol><li>Identifying with a larger social group.</li> <li>Having frequent and unplanned interactions with others.</li> <li>Having a chum with whom one can share the most painful of our conflicts.</li> </ol>
<p>Being married or partnered is not a protection against loneliness, and not being married isn’t a life sentence of loneliness. Not being paired with someone doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. But we do need others in our lives.</p>

<h1> The Psychology Behind Our Attachment to Robots </h1>

<li>The rise in loneliness provides a new form of consumer demand which businesses have begun to capitalize on. </li>
<li>Loneliness doesn’t just increase the drive for human connection but fundamentally alters the way people connect. </li>
<li>Crucially for the loneliness economy, loneliness makes inanimate objects seem human-like and sentient. </li>

<p>In the context of the <a>loneliness</a> economy, we can add another similarity to the list: both become easily attached to toy animals.</p>
<p>However, as we’ll see, the older demographic is just the tip of the iceberg. Increasingly, people of all ages are developing relationships with robots.</p>

<h1> How to Overcome FOMO </h1>
<h2> Research examines individual differences in fear of missing out. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Fear? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to combat fear and anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Gracinistudios/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</a>, and written by Barry and Wong of Washington State University, provides some answers to these questions.
<p>The sample consisted of 419 individuals (98 males) between the ages of 14 and 47 years. The majority (73 percent) were White.</p>
<p>Measures included the following (sample items are in parentheses):</p>
<li>Self-compassion scale: Measuring self-kindness, <a>mindfulness</a>, self-judgment, etc.</li>
<li>Sleep condition indicator: Measuring sleep quality and sleep problems.</li>
<li>Social media engagement: Determined by use frequency, number of accounts, etc.</li>
<li>UCLA <a>Loneliness</a> Scale-3: (“How often do you feel left out?”)</li>
<li>Rosenberg <a>Self-Esteem</a> Scale: (“At times I think I am no good at all.”)</li>
<li>Satisfaction With Life Scale: (“I am satisfied with my life.”)</li>
<p>Also included was the Fear of Missing Out Survey (FOMOS)—the standard version, plus two versions modified to emphasize the fear of missing out concerning relationships either with friends or with family.</p>
<p>The data showed fear of missing out was associated with loneliness, lower self-esteem, and lower self-compassion. Fear of missing out was not related to age. </p>
<p>So, compared to average people, those who had a greater fear of missing out were often more lonely and isolated, had a more negative view of themselves, and showed less self-acceptance and self-kindness.</p>
<h3>How Do We Overcome the Fear of Missing Out?</h3>
<p>So, how do we cope with the fear of missing out? One approach is <a>cultivating self-compassion</a>. Cultivating self-compassion means learning how to relate to ourselves with an attitude of care, kindness, and acceptance.</p>
<p>Self-compassion can help us counteract our preoccupation with what others are doing—such as constant upward social comparisons with those who have a strong social media presence.</p>
<p>To overcome the fear of missing out, consider the following suggestions:</p>
<li>Make a note of the type of social media you regularly use (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Reddit, Pinterest, YouTube), and length and frequency of use. Do you see a pattern?</li>
<li>Be mindful of your <a>goals</a>. Ask yourself, “Why am I on social media right now?”</li>
<li>Be aware of how social media affects you emotionally. Do you feel better or worse after using social media?</li>
<li>Limit your time on social media, especially during daily activities (e.g., while eating, getting ready to sleep).</li>
<li>Try to meet people face-to-face on a regular basis and work on building richer real-life relationships. This will likely reduce your feelings of loneliness and isolation.</li>
<li>Practice self-compassion regularly.</li>

<a>cognitive-behavioral</a> approach to depression, Ypsilanti and her fellow researchers note that your own feelings of loneliness trigger a self-perpetuating cycle in which “self-blame, low self-worth, dysphoria, and lower
<a>self-esteem</a> . . . then feed into greater loneliness,
<a>social isolation</a>, and mental health problems including depression” (p. 109). In other words, the thoughts that you are unworthy become the breeding ground for the negative thoughts that are at the core of depression.
<a>obsessive-compulsive</a> disorder, the
<a>guilt</a>, as shown in longitudinal studies, self-disgust plays a more prominent role in the evolution of depressive symptoms. They propose: Could loneliness lead to depression via a pathway involving self-disgust?
<p>If you feel that you rate highly on the quality of self-disgust, the Ypsilanti et al. findings provide these five suggestions for feeling better about yourself and improving your feelings of <a>happiness</a>:</p>
<p>3. Have a little self-compassion. You might not like the way you look, or even feel good about the things you do, but instead of becoming overwhelmed with disgust, recognize that no one is perfect and that you're allowed to have some flaws.</p>

<a>happiness</a> and your relationships stand to suffer. It’s okay for toddlers to become instantly enraged when a
<a>sibling</a> takes a toy away from them, or for
<a>teenagers</a> to get a case of the giggles at a friend's faux pas. As adults, we’re expected to hold our emotions in check, or at least cover them up, so they don’t make us look foolish, immature, or unreliable.
<p>For the SERI, then, once participants identify the target emotion, the interviewer proceeds to ask them about these 9 possible emotional-regulation strategies. See which ones you tend to use:</p>
<p> 1. Social support seeking: Turning to others for reassurance and ideas.</p>
<p> 3. Deliberate <a>self-harm</a>: Inducing harm onto oneself.</p>
<p> 4. Acceptance: Taking a situation in stride.</p>
<p> 5. Positive reappraisal: Looking at the bright side of a troubling situation.</p>
<p> 6. Expressive suppression: Trying to contain one’s emotions.</p>
<p> 7. Rumination: Going over and over in one’s mind the situation that provoked the emotion.</p>
<p> 8. Behavioral avoidance: Staying away from the emotion-laden situation.</p>
<p> 9. Cognitive avoidance: Staying away from thoughts about the emotion-laden situation.</p>
<p> For each strategy regarding one of your target emotions, indicate whether you've used it while experiencing the emotion, how often, and whether the strategy seemed to work for that situation. </p>

<h1> Who’s to Blame? Handling Stress and the Blame Game in 2019 </h1>
<h2> Are you a Self- or Other-Blamer? Find out, and learn about self-compassion. </h2>
<p> Posted December 27, 2018 </p>

<a>guilt</a> and self-disgust, and over time, low
<a>depression</a>. Self-blame reflects a tendency to internalize, to attribute problems to our own shortcomings, often to the exclusion of considering legitimate other factors that contribute to stress in our lives.
<p>So which are you, a self-blamer, or other blamer? Answer these 6 questions and find out:</p>
<p>1. When stressful situations occur, I tend to criticize myself for my role in allowing it to happen. Yes or No.</p>
<p>3. When I fail at something important, I become consumed by feelings of inadequacy. Yes or No.</p>
<p>4. People who get in my way cause the stress and frustration in my life. Yes or No. </p>
<p>5. In the past week, I felt that I was treated unfairly by someone, or not given something that I deserved. Yes or No</p>
<p>6. In the past week, I was certain that people were blocking or sabotaging my <a>goals</a> or efforts. Yes or No. </p>
<p>Assign yourself a point for each “Yes” answer. For questions 1-3, two or three yes answers means you have a strong tendency toward self-blame. For questions 4-6, two or three yes answers indicate you strongly tend to other-blame. </p>
<p>1. When I’m going through a very hard time, I give myself the caring and tenderness I need. Yes or No.</p>
<p>2. I try to be loving towards myself when I’m feeling very stressed. Yes or No.</p>
<p>3. I’m kind to myself when I’m experiencing stress or suffering. Yes or No.</p>
