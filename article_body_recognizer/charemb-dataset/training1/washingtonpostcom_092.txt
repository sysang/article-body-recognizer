<div><div><p><i>A look at the good (Hail!) and bad (Fail!) from the Washington Football Team’s </i><a><i>56-14 loss</i></a><i> to the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hail: Rodney Harrison’s frankness</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I feel bad for Terry McLaurin,” Harrison said of Washington’s No. 1 wideout, “because he’s always had to play with garbage quarterbacks and he’s a top-10 receiver and talent.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Brewer: In one half of football and fighting, Ron Rivera’s rebuild descended into chaos</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Fail: Getting humiliated in prime time</b></p></div></div>
<a>Seattle Seahawks</a> this season, but Sunday night’s beatdown brought back awful memories of the franchise’s
<a>59-28 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles</a> on “Monday Night Football” in 2010. Washington trailed that game 35-0 early in the second quarter and 45-14 at halftime.
<div><div><p><b>Hail: Big-man touchdowns</b></p></div></div>
<a>on a similar play earlier in the day</a>, Washington should make it a point to get a big man in the end zone over the next two weeks, because copying the Cowboys when it came to
<a>having custom benches on the sideline</a> worked out so well. Speaking of …
<div><div><p><b>Fail: Cooler heads and cooling benches</b></p></div></div>
<a>second-quarter altercation</a> between Washington defensive linemen and former Alabama teammates Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne.
<div><div><p>“S--- happens,” Allen, who threw a punch at Payne, said afterward. “Brothers fight.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During NBC Sports Washington’s postgame show, Brian Mitchell <a>offered an impassioned take</a> on the benches, which Washington should really have left behind as a late Christmas present for Jerry Jones.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hail: Randy Gregory</b></p></div></div>
<a>similar scene on the grass at FedEx Field</a> two weeks ago, when Gregory gave Heinicke a huge smile after the quarterback was knocked down on another incompletion. It’s a wonder that Gregory wasn’t penalized for taunting Sunday night.
<div><div><p><b>Fail: Defending Dak Prescott</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>How Washington went from playoff contender to big mess in five days</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hail: John Bates</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Fail: Washington’s tackling</b></p></div></div>
<a>52-yard touchdown run</a> earlier in the day, which is not a look anyone should aspire to replicate.

<p>Michael also adamantly denied the allegation.</p>
<p>“Nothing can be further from the truth. I was never asked to nor did I ask someone to compile videos as you described,” Michael said in an interview.</p>
<p>Baker recalls otherwise.</p>
<a>that detailed allegations from another 17 women</a>, which they read as an attempt to distance himself from the workplace culture described.

<p>Many women also said gender-based official policies and informal practices limited their ability to do their jobs and denied them opportunities for career advancement.</p>
<div> Alicia Klein was an intern with the team in 2010. </div>
<p>“It was pervasive,” said Klein, now a sports executive and professor in Brazil. “I didn’t tell anyone because it was embarrassing and demeaning, and I wanted to tell everyone that I had worked in the NFL.”</p>
<p> <i>[Sally Jenkins: Daniel Snyder has now embarrassed — and exposed — the entire NFL]</i> </p>
<p>Pareti and Scourby are among 12 former team employees who have retained attorney Lisa J. Banks, partner in the D.C. firm Katz, Marshall and Banks, which specializes in civil rights, employment and sexual harassment law.</p>
<p>Some former team employees were referred to Banks by the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, an initiative that connects women who are sexually harassed at work with legal and public relations professionals.</p>
<a>recently dropped the team’s name under pressure</a> from sponsors and critics who said it was racist. He also faces the possible exodus of his three co-owners, who
<a>are trying to sell their collective 40 percent stake in the franchise</a>.
<p>Snyder has gone to court twice in recent weeks to defend his reputation. He <a>sued an online media company for publishing what he said were defamatory stories about him</a>.</p>
<div>Snyder last week made Jason Wright the NFL's first Black team president. (Alex Brandon/AP)</div>
<a>named Jason Wright, a former NFL player and partner at the consulting firm McKinsey Company, as</a>
<a> team president</a>; Wright is the first Black person to hold that title in the NFL. Last month, Snyder hired sports broadcaster
<a>Julie Donaldson to replace Michael as senior vice president of media</a>, making her the team’s highest-ranking woman.
<p>“An independent investigation is needed,” Pareti said. “We cannot trust a report from this organization to be unbiased.”</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the event, which raised money for children’s charities, was a boxing ring where young fighters competed and Washington’s cheerleaders performed.</p>
<p>Snyder wasn’t a Fight Night regular, attendees said, but a photographer <a>captured him in his tuxedo that night with his arm around Schar</a>. Snyder won an auction for a limited edition Harley-Davidson motorcycle, <a>spending $80,000</a>.</p>
<p>“Tiffany!” Scourby recalled Snyder calling to her. Then 26, she had never spoken to Snyder before, she said, and was surprised he knew her name.</p>
<p>Scourby recalled a brief, awkward conversation before Snyder said, “You know, Tony is here,” and gestured to Anthony Roberts, his longtime friend, who was 40 years old at the time.</p>
<a>he and Roberts bought Porsches together</a>.
<p>“We have a hotel room,” Snyder said that 2004 night, according to Scourby. “Why don’t you and Tony go upstairs and get to know each other better?”</p>
<p>Scourby said she laughed sheepishly and waited for a laugh from Snyder that would indicate he was joking. He didn’t laugh, she said.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m working. Have a great time,” Scourby said she told him before quickly walking back into the crowd. Later that night, she confided in Donald Wells, the cheerleader director, about the conversation.</p>
<p>Two other people supported Scourby’s recollection of that evening: her boyfriend at the time, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and a longtime friend, who said Scourby told her about the incident a few days later.</p>
<p> <i>[<a>Barry Svrluga: The walls are closing in on Daniel Snyder, and his tone-deaf response made things worse</a>]</i> </p>
<p>Years later, Scourby said, she is still unsure whether Roberts knew about Snyder’s remark. Roberts did not respond to repeated requests for comment from The Post.</p>
<a>accused actor Jeremy Piven of sexually assaulting her in 2003 during a brief encounter in New York</a>. Piven denied the allegation, along with
<a>similar claims of sexual misconduct by seven other women</a>. CBS canceled the drama he was starring in at the time.
<p>“Powerful men in powerful positions need to realize that they can’t do this,” she said.</p>
<h2>‘For Executive Meeting’</h2>
<p>Baker said Michael excused two female colleagues and asked him to stay, along with two male colleagues: Tim DeLaney, then vice president of production, and Marc Dress, a videographer.</p>
<p>After Michael asked for the video of “the good bits,” there was an awkward pause, said Baker, who was unsure what they were being asked to do.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ll take care of it,’ ” DeLaney said, according to Baker.</p>
<p>“Nobody said anything; it was just palpable tension,” said Baker, who was among those laid off in 2009 and now lives in Nashville. </p>
<p>The door, which typically would be open, was shut, Baker said. His co-workers spoke in hushed tones, he said, and when he left the room, DeLaney told him to close the door.</p>
<p>DeLaney and Dress disputed Baker’s account.</p>
<p>“I’ve never seen anything like that,” said Dress, now an independent videographer in Maryland. “I was a shooter; I shot it. What happened after I turned it in, I can’t tell you.” </p>
<p>“I thought: ‘That’s a really weird place for a shot to be stopped. … I hope that’s never used for anything,’ ” Imbert said.</p>
<p>The Post showed the videos to Banks, Scourby’s attorney, who also represents Baker.</p>
<p>In interviews with The Post, as they learned about the unofficial videos for the first time, several former cheerleaders said they felt exploited by an organization that, at the time, paid them each about $1,000 per year.</p>

<p>Heather Tran, who posed for the 2008 calendar, said she asked for a “closed shoot,” in which only essential staff, the photographer and the videographer were allowed to attend.</p>
<p>“I feel betrayed and violated,” said Tran, who was 29 when she posed topless. In the authorized version of the video, several beaded necklaces covered parts of her breasts; in the unauthorized version, her nipples are briefly exposed.</p>
<p>Scourby was involved in both shoots: in 2008 as a cheerleader and in 2010 as a volunteer helping to coordinate the shoot. She also viewed the videos and said she was certain the footage came from the team’s videographers.</p>
<p>“I’m horrified. I’m nauseous,” Scourby said. “The video was a huge violation of my sisters and I.”</p>
<p>Wells, the longtime cheerleader director, was so taken aback by the news of the videos that he cried.</p>
<p>“I worked so hard to protect them,” he said. “They are daughters and wives and mothers. This is disgusting.”</p>
<h2>‘Led by fear’</h2>
<p>“The fear is instilled in employees from Day One,” said Imbert, who worked for the team from 2008 until 2011. “The organization is led by fear.”</p>
<p>Susan Miller, a retired former president of a Virginia employee referral agency, said she stopped sending people to work for the team in the early 2000s after growing appalled by how Snyder treated his employees.</p>
<p>“He’d just passed her in the hall once … and then just said, ‘Get rid of her,’ ” Miller said. The executive assistant did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
<div> <div>He denigrated people. He treated women like servants.</div> <div>Susan Miller, a retired former president of a Virginia employee referral agency, about Daniel Snyder</div> </div>
<h2>A lack of human resources</h2>
<p>Choi, who has worked for the team since 2009, declined an interview request through a team spokesman.</p>
<p>In early 2016, Shannon Slate, a 22-year-old college intern at the time, said she met with Choi to try to file a complaint against Santos, then 40.</p>
<p>In a phone interview, Slate described her increasing level of discomfort as Santos pursued her throughout her internship. It started with daily visits to her desk and unwanted gifts such as a team visor or a water bottle.</p>
<div>It was like fresh meat to a pack of wolves every time a new pack of interns would come in.</div>
<div>Brittany Pareti, a D.C.-area marketing executive who worked in Washington’s community and charitable programs from 2007 to 2012</div>
<p>Counseled by two female supervisors, Slate said, she went to Choi. His reaction marked an end to Slate’s career in professional sports.</p>
<p>Slate’s account was supported by a college roommate she told at the time as well as by Slate’s older sister.</p>
<p>“I guess they kind of wanted to sweep it under the rug,” said Ashley Slate, a nanny in Monmouth Beach, N.J. “I wanted to call them and ask them what the hell was wrong with them.” </p>
<p>Santos declined to comment.</p>
<p>Under Choi, an email sent to all employees in 2017 sparked outrage among women. The Post obtained a copy of the email.</p>
<p>The implication, made clear in follow-up instructions by team executives, according to four women, was that they were “a distraction” to players.</p>
<p>Kalmanides, who now works in human resources for D.C. United, Washington’s Major League Soccer club, said in a statement to The Post that the email was written by senior executives she declined to name. Kalmanides reported directly to Choi.</p>
<p>“At their request, I distributed the email to all staff. … I had no involvement in the creation of this instruction,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“We are adults in a workplace,” one female former marketing employee said. “Women were professionally dressed. … That’s on the men for not being able to keep it professional.”</p>
<h2>‘Big ideas’ ignored</h2>
<p>Lafemina, whom Snyder publicly praised for “fresh thinking and big ideas,” got to work.</p>
<a>offered discounted tickets</a> to government employees, scouts and service members. And he pledged to “treat [fans] the way they ought to be treated.”
<p>Rachel Engleson was the messenger. A 2010 Maryland graduate, she said she endured years of sexual harassment from Michael during her ascent from unpaid intern to senior director of marketing and client services.</p>
<p>It started with comments about her hair and outfits, she said, and it escalated to kisses on the cheek, a suggestive email and unwelcome hugs. Nearly all of those overtures were in front of others, she said, making her humiliation worse.</p>
<p>In an interview with the The Post, Michael denied repeated instances of harassment and any improper touching but acknowledged making one inappropriate remark in her presence, which he declined to detail.</p>
<p>“There were things that were said and done in public involving Rachel that I have apologized for,” Michael said.</p>
<p>Friedman did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p>
<p>Several years later, after Lafemina’s arrival, Engleson requested a meeting with his new deputies, Steven Ziff and Jake Bye, to tell them how the team treated women.</p>
<p>“They needed to know what they were getting into,” said Engleson, now 31. “And I needed to know, for my own future, if the place was going to change.”</p>
<p>Engleson said she told Ziff and Bye about Michael’s harassment. She also told them about the team’s inadequate process for reporting harassment and her wariness of confiding in any executive close to Snyder.</p>
<p>Lafemina and Ziff declined to comment for this story. Bye could not be reached to comment.</p>
<a>fired him and two of his deputies </a>Dec. 26, 2018, after less than eight months on the job. Bye had resigned Dec. 21.
<p>Employees were informed that afternoon in a hastily called meeting led by Terry Bateman, a former team executive whom Snyder had recently rehired. The team declined to make Bateman available for an interview.</p>
<p>According to Engleson and several others who attended the meeting, Bateman sought to allay concerns, explaining that the organization would be “going back to how things were.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘Back to how things were?’ ” Engleson recalled asking.</p>
<p>Within six months, Engleson was <a>among more than 40 employees — one-fourth of the team’s non-football staff — who left the team</a>, convinced the culture change they had been counting on would never come.</p>

<div><div><p>Staring at a stack of note cards, emcee Richard Ryan told Snyder many questions concerned the team’s name. Did he have any thoughts about changing it, and did he find it derogatory toward Native Americans?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Never has arrived. Snyder announced Monday that his franchise will “retire” the name. He said a new name will be decided after completion of the team’s internal review.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The name has lingered over Snyder’s franchise for the entirety of his stewardship and decades before, at some moments a latent topic and at others a hotly debated issue, always present.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A timeline of the Redskins' name-change debate</p></div>
<div><p>In the span of six weeks, nationwide racial reckoning and widespread protests spurred major corporate sponsors of the team to publicly pressure Snyder to change the name, which many consider to be offensive and a slur to Native Americans.</p></div>
<div><div><p>While the discussion intensified in recent years, it was not a new debate. The desire among advocates to change the name had bubbled for nearly five decades, a majority of the name’s life span.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The movement quickly trickled up to the NFL and created <a>a controversy for Washington</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In January 1972, an Indian Legal Information Development Service leader sent team president and part-owner Edward Bennett Williams a letter explaining how the name perpetuated negative stereotypes of Native Americans.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the meeting, according to the Washington Daily News, Williams told the group changing the name would require “thousands of dollars” paid to NFL Properties and NFL Films.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We left Williams with a pure moral issue,” Ron Aguilar, head of the National Youth Indian Council, said at the time. “We know we are right and that we will win.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Months later, Williams made a minor concession: While pledging to keep the name with an “open mind,” he changed lyrics in the team’s fight song that referenced scalping.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Warriors? Red Tails? Next step for team is securing trademark rights.</p></div>
<div><div><p>As would often happen, the name debate receded from public discussion, only to resurface.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We say to Jack Kent Cooke, this is 1992,” Vernon Bellecourt, the director of the American Indian Movement, said. “The name of your football team has got to be changed.”</p></div></div>
<a>ran an editorial</a> in agreement.
<div><div><p>“We'll never change the name,” Snyder said. “It's that simple. NEVER — you can use caps.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Activists, politicians, players react to team's decision</p></div>
<a>Rivera said</a> in a July 4 interview, around the time politicians, tribal leaders and other advocates started a new push to change it. On June 12, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said it was “past time” to change the name.
<div><div><p>Having resisted for two decades, Snyder changed course in a matter of weeks.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Washington Football Team</a></div></div><div><h1>For Jason Wright, WFT’s outsider president, the future is all about change</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Nicki Jhabvala</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>July 10, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<p>Jason Wright sometimes forgets he played professional football. Such as a few years ago, when a doctor asked him whether he left out anything in his past because his injury history didn’t correspond with his profession — as a consultant.</p>
<div><div><p>“I was like: ‘Oh. Yeah,’ ” Wright recalled with a laugh.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Or the time recently when a coach saw him running sprints across the Washington Football Team’s practice fields and asked, “Did we just sign another dude?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t come from inside sports,” Wright said, “even though I played the game. It’s very different.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sally Jenkins: The NFL's probe was just like Daniel Snyder's workplace culture: Rotten</p></div>
<div><p>“We want to be writing the playbook for others,” he said. “Not so we can beat our chests or to pat ourselves on the back but because we have a unique team that has been intentionally assembled to do that.”</p></div>
<p>But his task is fraught with challenges. Any vision Wright has for the team’s future is complicated by its past — a past fueling doubt that owner Daniel Snyder will allow Wright<b> </b>to fully realize his ambitions for the franchise.</p>
<a>dozens of allegations</a> of sexual misconduct by former employees, the NFL concluded this month that Snyder presided over a culture of fear, bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment. The league
<a>fined the team $10 million</a>, and Beth Wilkinson, the attorney who led the investigation, issued recommendations to improve its workplace conditions.
<div><div><p>Snyder was not suspended. Rather, the NFL said he will voluntarily cede control of the team’s day-to-day operations to his wife, Tanya, who was <a>appointed co-CEO</a> two days before the announcement.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The NFL fines Washington Football Team $10 million; Tanya Snyder will run operations for now</p></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s a credit to the team we built here, for seeing what needed to happen and starting to create the type of culture we need to proactively,” he said.</p></div></div>
<a>when it jettisoned its controversial old name</a>, and the team’s new venue.
<div><div><h3><div>A team of outsiders</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Julie Donaldson</a>, who was named senior vice president of media and content last summer to oversee the team’s broadcast operations. Before Tanya Snyder’s appointment as co-CEO, Donaldson was the team’s highest-ranking woman.
<div><div><p>As the only woman to be a full-time member of an NFL team’s radio booth, Donaldson is the team’s primary link to its fan base.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The only new executive member with prior NFL experience is David Baldwin, the chief ticketing officer who worked for the Miami Dolphins.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The staff, intentionally diverse and inclusive, didn’t come cheap. To some, the investment is indicative of the freedom Daniel Snyder has provided Wright to change the organization.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Among <a>the allegations</a> reported by The Post last year, female former employees said Washington’s previous HR department had <a>only one staff member</a> and lacked accountability.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s such a priority for us across multiple dimensions that it just required a full-time role,” Wright said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wright has sought more communication with employees, fans and stakeholders, a sharp contrast to the style of the previous regime, led by former team president Bruce Allen.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We want to flatten the hierarchy and be accessible so that people understand the decisions that are being made,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A future vision</div></h3></div></div>
<p>“That model franchise of the future is where we want to be, and it’s much more expansive than just selling tickets and playing games,” Wright said. “Everything that we want to do takes our brand much further.”</p>
<div><div><p>The new name and logo will be revealed in early 2022, Wright said, and will retain the traditional burgundy and gold colors that are entrenched in the team’s history.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Damon Jones, the team’s chief legal officer who helped develop Nationals Park during his 13 years with the local MLB team, has taken the lead, alongside Daniel Snyder, in developing plans for a new venue.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Basically: a stadium that is more than just a stadium.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the challenges there are lengthy, too, especially for a team that, according to ESPN, ranked at or near the bottom of the NFL in home attendance for nine of the 10 seasons before Rivera and Wright arrived.</p></div></div>
<p>For the past 11 months, Washington’s business operations — and its football team — have shown signs of change. But whether Wright and his team of outsiders can create a new product or merely a new facade will depend on the top.</p>
<div><div><p>“Time will tell.”</p></div></div>

<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic cut the season short, he had moved in with Lauren and her husband, Justin.
<div><div><p>“Covid and the NFL season, you never know what's going to happen,” Heinicke recalled Turner saying. “We might need you later in the year.”</p></div></div>
<p>But hope was hard to muster. Most days, Heinicke found clarity by strapping on a 50-pound vest and speed-walking for two hours. He would return home feeling accomplished and ready to tackle his to-do list, but the NFL felt as far away as ever.</p>
<a>the most of any NFL team</a> — the title feels different on Heinicke. The 28-year-old has made the most of his improbable second chance, going toe-to-toe with Tom Brady in

<a>his second</a>, but what he could turn out to be remains a mystery.
<div><div><p>Ask Heinicke or Turner how far he can go, how good he can be, and they’ll demur. Earl Williams, the quarterback’s skills trainer since he was 15, is not as shy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘I want you to be ready’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I hate to say I was hoping for an injury, but every NFL team has injuries,” Heinicke said. “I was kind of just waiting to see if a team would bring me in for a workout.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He kind of just vibes with everybody,” Ta’amu said, a high compliment from someone of Gen Z.</p></div></div>
<p>Hesitant, Heinicke recommitted to training five days per week. Williams encouraged him by passing along rumors that Washington was unhappy with Dwayne Haskins, its young quarterback. Maybe Turner would get the team to give him another shot.</p>
<div><div><p>In early December, Heinicke was in bed, studying for finals, when his phone finally rang. It was his agent, Chris Cabott. He wanted to know if Heinicke was ready to play some football.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘Don’t force it’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the loss, as Heinicke became a topic of national conversation and an obvious candidate to stick in the NFL, he privately worried that the separated shoulder he had suffered on the play had caused irreparable damage.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was almost a blessing in disguise,” Seedman said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s been a pattern in Taylor’s career of success with Scott Turner,” Cabott said, “and he wanted to continue that success.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s going to be ups and downs,” Turner said. “[But] the skill set he has, with the accuracy, with the decision-making, the vision and then his athleticism, [he can] continue to be successful.”</p></div></div>

<a>placed on administrative leave</a> by the team amid the criminal investigation.
<div><p>Vermillion’s attorney, Barry Coburn of law firm Coburn Greenbaum in Washington, declined to comment Thursday. <a>NBC Sports Washington</a> was the first to report the federal investigation is connected to prescription drugs.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The DEA’s investigation isn’t the first involving an NFL team or its medical staff and the unauthorized distribution of prescription drugs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Wednesday, Washington safety Landon Collins, who is the team’s player representative for the NFL Players Association, was asked by reporters about his experience with Vermillion.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>As she shared her story that day in 2019, Tracy’s recollections made a particularly strong impression on one football player seated in the front row.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s a huge issue that is really not addressed as much as it should be,” Smith-Williams said in a recent interview. “The more I learn, the more I’m around it, you see how prevalent it really is.”</p></div>
<p>“I think about the ripple effect from James, and it’s overwhelming for me because I realize someone — and we may never know who it was — but someone will be changed because of him. Someone may be saved because of him.”</p>
<div><div><h3><div>‘You have a voice’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The game was the second NFL start for Smith-Williams and the culmination of a six-year transformation that began with him playing defensive back as a 196-pound freshman for the Wolfpack.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Svrluga: Washington has waited 30 years for a receiver like Terry McLaurin</p></div>
<div><div><p>Tracy has long felt the same way about her story, which is why she has visited more than 100 college campuses and spoken to some 50,000 athletes since 2016.</p></div></div>
<p>“I really sat and reflected with that,” Smith-Williams said. “I think it’s kind of led me forward as I’ve been here, in the NFL and in D.C., trying to do more things, trying to be that good man, that good person.”</p>
<div><div><p>For Smith-Williams, the action started with spearheading a donation drive for InterAct, an organization in Raleigh that provides services to domestic violence and sexual assault victims and their families.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s not afraid to speak what he feels is right and to do what he knows is right,” Williams said. “And that’s just the way he’s always been since he was a little boy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘That’s the end goal’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>That willingness to speak up didn’t change when Smith-Williams went pro.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Smith-Williams was named Tracy’s first NFL ambassador a month after he was drafted, and their work together has only increased.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Weeks later, Smith-Williams and Sullivan partnered with the D.C. Coalition Against Domestic Violence to buy more than $3,000 worth of gifts for children whose families have been affected by domestic violence.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What Brenda always says is very true: The goal is for me or her to no longer have a space doing this work because it’s not a problem. That’s the end goal.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Terry McLaurin paused to ponder the question. In a locker room with close to 70 NFL players, plucking out the most competitive of the bunch requires thought.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The example elicited some laughs, but not because it was difficult to imagine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jonathan Allen, Washington’s veteran defensive tackle, is a 6-foot-3, 300-pound hulk who once said he hates losing more than he likes winning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m tired of losing. We’re tired of losing. Everybody here is tired of losing,” he said last year. “We want to win, and if it’s not about winning, I really don’t care about it.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>We want Dallas? Washington eyes first three-game winning streak against Cowboys since 1988.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But after four years of being a staple on the defensive line and its hard-nosed leader, Allen, 26, has evolved into even more in his fifth season: a game-wrecker and a cornerstone of Washington’s rebuilding franchise.</p></div></div>
