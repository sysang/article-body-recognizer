<h1> Coaches and Counselors: Helping Hands in Turbulent Times </h1>
<h2> Part 1 of 2: How practitioners describe their similarities and differences. </h2>
<li>Coaches and counselors share the same broad aspirations but differ in their background, licensure requirements, and general focus areas.</li>
<li>Counselors assess, diagnose, and treat mental health issues; coaches help clients with work-related goals, skills, or challenges.</li>
<li>Coaches focus on the future, unlocking potential, and growth; counselors also address the past, and focus on healing and solving problems.</li>
<a>anxious</a> or depressed in the last year, and that’s just the tip of the overall problem. Another swath of us is
<a>“languishing”</a>—experiencing the feeling of emptiness, fogginess, and stagnation that lies between
<a>depression</a> and flourishing.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: cottonbro/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But what, exactly, does a coach or a counselor do? How are they similar and different? When might one be a good fit for the challenges you’re facing? Probably not the right fit?</p>
<p>Those are the questions I asked a set of 15 professionals—seven counselors and eight executive coaches—earlier this year.</p>
<p>I start, below, with what these experts shared about the basics of <a>coaching</a> and counseling. Then, in a subsequent post, I’ll dig deeper into when each might be a better choice for someone facing specific challenges and opportunities.</p>
<h3>What is a coach? A counselor?</h3>
<h3>Similarities and differences between counselors and coaches</h3>
<li>Coaches focus more on the future; counselors focus more on helping clients understand their pasts.</li>
<li>Coaches focus on goal setting and action planning that facilitate future growth or thriving; counselors focus on healing pain or injury. </li>
<li>Coaches focus on unlocking potential; counselors focus on solving problems.</li>
<li>Coaches focus on growth without the assumption that anything with the client is wrong or in need of treatment; counselors focus on diagnosing and treating identified problems.</li>
<h3>Should I get a coach or a counselor?</h3>
<a>stress</a>. Adding trusted professionals to one’s support team seems unlikely to make anything worse, and it might do a whole lot of good.

<p><a>John Bowlby</a> and ethological models of attachment</p>
<p>World War II produced a glut of studies of infants raised in harsh and inhumane conditions. The rise of social psychology, combined with work by ethologists such as Conrad Lorenz, came together in work by John Bowlby, Ethologists:</p>
<li>Focus on species-specific behavior</li>
<li>Take an evolutionary perspective, interpreting behavior in the context of survival and reproduction</li>
<li>Assume species-specific learning dispositions</li>
<li>Attend to behavior rather than internal states</li>

<p>The Development of Attachment in Infancy</p>
<ul><li>Wanting to be close to caregivers</li> <li>Distress when separated</li> <li><a>Happiness</a> and ability to comforted by caregivers after reunion</li> </ul>
<p>Attachment keeps us close so we can explore on our own</p>
<p>Different types of attachment</p>

<a>shame</a>. Every few days a prompt comes through your feed: Are you still in?
<p>It's fun and "mostly harmless," and I "won" the challenge by not hearing the song six or seven years in a row. </p>
<a>anxious</a> about at all. It's a silly game. It's supposed to be fun. And nobody even cares that I'm playing it or certainly not that I win, except for me. This is me monitoring me.

<a>Bing Crosby and David Bowie</a>, a great techno version that took me out this year, to a
<a>funkified guitar solo</a> by Kirk Douglas I just heard on the New Yorker radio hour. There are schmaltzy versions. One that always brings me to tears is the
<a>solemn rendition on The West Wing</a>, where it movingly accompanies a military funeral of a homeless veteran (that one got me last year). Like most songs, it's in the music, the musician, and the listener.

<h1> Most Gamers Are Adults. Why Do We Worry When Kids Play? </h1>
<h2> Only 30% of gamers are under 18. How can we maximize fun and minimize harm? </h2>
<p>A recent survey by the Entertainment Software Association (2018) found that at least one person in most households played video games (64 percent). More surprisingly, it found that 70 percent of those players were over 18. </p>
<p>When surveyed, almost two of three parents played video games with their kids, and most parents thought that games were beneficial. </p>
<p>Why Does Every Article on Video Gaming and Kids Sound Like It Should Have Scary Music Playing in the Background?</p>
<p>Despite the ubiquity of gaming in our lives, we know very little about the "beneficial or harmful aspects of video games for school‐age children's cognition or learning." What we do seem to know about video games is that they worry us.</p>
<p>There are a few things we do know about video games and young children:</p>
<ul><li>Patterns of video game use seem to be established early: Heavy child users become heavy teen and adult users.</li> <li>Time spent gaming increases with age.</li> </ul>
<p>According to the 2017 <a>Common Sense Media Survey</a> of 0-8 year-olds in the U.S.:</p>
<ul><li>Children under 2 are not gamers.</li> <li>2-4-year-olds played about 21 minutes a day.</li> <li>5-8-year-olds played about 42 minutes a day.</li> </ul>
<a>Twenty-seven percent of boys and 2 percent of girls</a> said that gaming was their favorite activity.
<p>Teachers often use games and "educational apps" (games) in school. More than 80 percent of teachers reported using them as far back as 2015, and computers, tablets, and phones have become more common in classrooms now than they were then.</p>
<p>As found in research on television, the answer is: "It depends."</p>
<p>I quote directly from the Society for Research on <a>Child Development's report</a>:</p>
<p>As a parent, this tells me three things. </p>
<li>I need to know what my child is playing. There are creative and exciting games out there. That's why we like them—they're fun. But just like frightening or overly sexualized movies, adult fare is not appropriate for children.</li>
<li>The best way to know is to do it with them. If I'm playing along with them, we can talk about it, I can watch how they react, and I don't feel intrusive.</li>
<a>Very young toddlers should be interacting with the real world</a>, not with screens. Screens provide a visually exciting environment, but they are a
<p>So should we let younger kids play with video games? </p>
<p>If they're over 5, the games are age appropriate, and we play with them, sure! We might even enjoy it.</p>
<p>If they're younger than 5, probably not. There are other things that they'll probably enjoy more and that are better for them.</p>

<h1> How the Desktop Metaphor Helped Windows Take Over the World </h1>
<h2> The desktop metaphor made it easier for people to learn complex computer tasks. </h2>
<p> Posted August 19, 2019 </p>
<p>Most people reading this post will have used computers most of their lives. This is not just true of so-called digital natives born in the post smartphone era. It's also true of people like me.</p>
<p>Computers were not user-friendly then. You programmed them on cards with 80 character limits. No backspace. No delete. No memory. Just 80 perfect characters. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>80 column IBM punched card</div> <div>Source: Binary Ape, used by permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Instructions were opaque. A misplaced comma or period or extra space could waste hours of debugging. </p>
<p>I was reminded of that this morning when helping an 89-year-old try to save a Word file with a new name. Many older adults are fluent with computers. (Hi Mom!) Others struggle. This was the latter. </p>
<a>Paul Thibodeau</a> has done work showing that when we think about
<a>crime</a> as a virus rather than a beast, we think about different solutions to solving the problem. People who use different metaphors for considering
<a>chronic pain</a> react to it differently.
<p>Microsoft Windows and the Metaphor of the Desk</p>
<a>Disk Operating System</a>). It was a line by line interface, an interactive screen-based version of the old punch-card commands I used as a little kid. (You can still see and use parts of it when you're working in obscure parts of Windows.)
<p>And there we have all the basic icons on old Windows (and Apple) machines. </p>

<h1> Pain and Emotion: The Role of the Amygdala </h1>
<h2> The amygdala processes emotions and gives meaning to pain. </h2>
<p>My previous post, "Is Pain All In Your Head?" discussed how the same sensation can be interpreted as excitement, pain, or pressure, depending on how you interpret it. How does that work? The amygdala.</p>
<a>anger</a>. It also processes punishments and rewards. Burning your hand quickly teaches you not to touch fire. Rewarding experiences make it more likely we do something again.
<p>The amygdala’s response differs by context</p>
<a>teenagers</a>—have much more fun doing risky things when they’re with friends. That’s because being with others activates the amygdala and enhances feelings of reward.
<a>"Hey Guys, Watch This!"</a> and
<a>"Teens Respond to Pleasure, Not Pain"</a> for a more detailed discussion of this.) The same is true of pain. We experience sensations very differently depending on what emotions go along with them. When we are depressed, scared, or
<a>anxious</a>, the amygdala interprets injury and sensation as threatening. What happens?
<p>Everything hurts more. The effects of negative emotions on pain are incredibly powerful. One reason that disassociatives can work as painkillers is by turning down the fear receptors in the amygdala. They don't damp down the sensation of pain.</p>
<p>Is That Why Distraction Helps Relieve Pain?</p>
<p>That’s not faking it. It’s <a>neuroscience</a>.</p>
<a>stress</a> levels, and get treatment for
<p>When you feel the world is a safer and less threatening place and that you are more powerful and capable, the same sensation is interpreted differently.</p>
<p>When you’re having fun, the anxiety and danger centers of the brain ratchet the experience of pain way down. The pain is still there, but it’s much easier to deal with.</p>
<p>In other words, when you feel happy and strong, pain hurts less.</p>

<h1> Parenting Style: Balancing Demandingness and Support </h1>
<h2> All parents want to control their children. They differ in how they do it. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> A Parent's Role </li> <li> <a>Find a family counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Metropolitan Museum of Art/Wikimedia Commons Public Domain</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>It's our job. We're tasked with keeping our kids safe, guiding them towards healthy adulthood, and helping them fit into society.</p>
<p>Often that means reigning in their behavior.</p>
<ul><li>Don’t hit</li> <li>No running with sticks</li> <li>Do your homework</li> <li>Be home by 10:00</li> </ul>
<p>Pick any age; it seems like there’s always something that kids want to do that parents want to stop.</p>
<ul><li>Adjust rules and expectations to meet the needs and individual characteristics of the child</li> <li>Ask the child to adjust their behavior to meet the needs and expectations of others</li> </ul>
<p>Crossing these two dimensions, we get four types of typical parenting (abusive parenting is considered separately):</p>
<li>Authoritarian parents are high in control/demandingness, but low in warmth.</li>
<li>Indulgent or permissive parents are high in supportiveness/warmth and low in control.</li>
<li>Authoritative parents balance both high demandingness and high warmth.</li>
<li>Uninvolved parents are low on both demandingness and warmth.</li>
<p>Children of authoritarian parents don’t rebel</p>
<a>conformity</a>, permissive parenting can give children a safety zone where they can express themselves.
<p>Authoritative parents are both warmest and strictest.</p>

<h1> What's Working? A 5-Minute Exercise for a Better Life </h1>
<h2> This short reflection helps clarify your values and priorities. </h2>
<p>“Watch your thoughts, they become your words; watch your words, they become your actions; watch your actions, they become your habits; watch your habits, they become your character; watch your character, it becomes your destiny.”*</p>
<p>Life is composed of time and attention. </p>
<p>Begin this exercise with a piece of paper or an open journal page. Divide the page into four quadrants. In each quadrant, write one of four phrases:</p>
<ul><li>What's working?</li> <li>What's not working?</li> <li>Do more of... </li> <li>Do less of...</li> </ul>
<p>What's working? I use this section to reflect on things in my life I'm happy with. More importantly, I think about why those things are making me happy. Notice this whole list is about making change. </p>
<p>What's not working? One of the things I've learned is that small irritants steal joy and attention. Let your mind dwell on them here. </p>
<p>Do more of... Now we're taking action. Where do you want to spend your time and your attention? </p>
<p>This can be different from what's working. I really like having soup for Wednesday dinners and family tea on Sundays, but I don't want to do more of that. But I do want to go to the movies more often and spend more time writing up my research. </p>
<p>I love this quadrant because it asks me to think about what things make me happier and how I can put more of them into my life.</p>
<p>Do less of... Identifying time sinks and attention sucks can be just what we need to make time for what makes us happy. I'm not going to have time to play more ukulele if I don't spend less time scanning Facebook. </p>
<p>Why I love this exercise</p>
<a>pretty good organizing system</a>). It is a standard spread in the
<a>social life</a>. It is a fantastic exercise for job seekers.
<p>And then... I find this exercise helps me reflect on where I want my attention to be, and where my time is most profitably spent. As a developmentalist, I know that many small changes over time are what create our lives.</p>
<p>The next step is an action plan. Having spent five or ten minutes planning, I can identify one or two things I want to change immediately, a few more for the near future, and some to think about for the future.</p>

<h1> How Can I Get My Teenager to Talk to Me? 4 Tips </h1>
<h2> 4 steps towards a better relationship with your teen. </h2>
<p>Teenagers spend their lives in constant communication. They text. They chat. They live on social media. </p>
<p>Why then, do so many parents complain that their teens never talk to them? </p>
<p>1. Everyday conversations are money in the bank. Invest in them.</p>
<p>Videogames, <a>memes</a>, and YouTube videos are the teenage equivalent of Legos, Disney princesses, and dinosaurs.</p>
<p>Share their emotions. Show them that you take what they think is cool seriously. It’s a place to start. You’re building trust and showing you’re a safe and reliable ally. </p>
<p>2. Model everyday sharing.</p>
<a>intimacy</a>. I tell you mine, and you tell me yours.
<p>3. Listen, don’t lecture.</p>
<p>Nothing kills a conversation faster than someone telling you that you're wrong and they know better. Don’t be that person.</p>
<p>Research suggests that listening and being accepting encourages teens to talk much more openly than asking pointed questions, criticizing, or pulling them up short because they’re worried about your next reaction.</p>
<p>4. If they have a problem they want help with, don’t be afraid to share an opinion!</p>
<p>Telling them they should know better and you have the one correct solution is never welcome and rarely listened to. Even if you do know better and do have a good idea.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Relationships with teens are relationships.</p>
<p>Everyday, accepting conversations between people who like each other, share jokes and stories, and show each other respect are money in the bank as far as relationships are concerned.</p>
<p>This is particularly true for relationships between parents and teens.</p>
<p>Strong relations between parents and teens are also the basis of a strong adult bond that can last a lifetime.</p>

<h1> Children COVID-19: What Parents Should Know </h1>
<h2> Basic hygiene and turning off screens should be your go to moves </h2>
<p>As parents, our first thoughts when we hear heightened reports of a new and potentially lethal virus is for our children. </p>
<a>Center for Disease Control</a> suggest kids are doing better than adults in coping with the novel
<a>coronavirus</a> associated with Covid-19.
<p>I am not a medical doctor and refer you to experts – like the <a>CDC</a> or the <a>World Health Organization</a> for updates on how to best protect yourself from the virus. </p>
<a>parenting</a>. What we know about parenting during times of heightened anxiety and crisis is that children look to their parents for stability and security. For young children, their sense of security – or their sense of
<a>fear</a> – will come from you. So how you respond is critical.
<p>Project calm, safety, and let them know you're there for them. Studies going back to World War II show that during times of uncertainty, kids look to parents for cues about how to feel.</p>
<p>Let’s Talk Common Sense</p>
<p>One important role of parents is to teach children to protect themselves. In this case, the message from healthcare experts and epidemiologists is clear: employ <a>best practices for hygiene</a>:</p>
<li>Wash your hands frequently, especially before eating or touching your face</li>
<li>Avoid close contact with others – and yes, their hands are probably the germiest part too, so avoid shaking hands</li>
<li>Avoid touching your face</li>
<li>Stay home if you’re sick</li>
<p>These are things we parents should always be teaching. This is also a great time to double down on basic habits like washing hands after using the bathroom and before eating. </p>
<p>This is also a good time to enforce some lifetime good habits:</p>
<ul><li>Wash hands after blowing noses</li> <li>Immediately toss those tissues</li> <li><a>Use your elbow</a> to cover your nose while coughing or sneezing like a vampire</li> </ul>

<p>Little Pitchers Have Big Ears</p>
<p>One of my very first blogs for Psychology Today was called <a>Little Pitchers Have Big Ears</a>. </p>
<p>It makes one basic point: Kids listen to the news too. When you watch a video or run the TV or radio in the background, you may be able to tune it out and put the news in context, but your kids can’t. </p>
<p>This came front and center to me when my eldest was just a toddler. We were driving in the car. The first Iraq war had just started. We were concerned for many reasons, and the radio was on constantly. </p>
<a>mindful</a> of little ones who might be listening in the background. Even if they don’t know the words, they understand the emotional tone. Frankly, it's good for my emotional health too.The Bottom Line?
<p>Just three big points for protecting your kids from this novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19</p>
<li>Your kids trust you. If you stay calm and teach them to protect themselves, they'll feel okay. Your reactions are how they interpret the world.</li>

<h1> Campus Closed? Structuring Your Day Will Foster Success </h1>
<h2> Building routines that foster wellness and reduce stress </h2>
<p>With many schools canceling classes through the end of the month or the end of the semester, thousands of college students are faced with new challenges:</p>
<li>Online courses with new pedagogies, new technologies, and new kinds of tests and assessments</li>
<li>The need to develop new ways of listening and taking notes </li>
<li>A sudden premium placed on reading textbooks deeply and well</li>
<li>Disruption to routine activities and daily life – everything from meals to exercise to social lives.</li>
<p>One huge challenge for people suddenly home for college is the lack of temporal structure to your day. That’s problematic because rituals and routines are one of the best ways to reduce stress.</p>
<p>Build Healthy Routines That Schedule Wellness Into Your Day</p>
<a>Getting Things Done</a> system, or the
<a>Pretty Good Organizing System for Non-Linear Thinkers</a> can help you set
<a>goals</a>, build a 'to do' list, prioritize what's important, and remind you of what you've accomplished.
<p>Structure Your Day: If you were living on campus, your roommate, cafeteria schedules, class times, and activities probably kept you moving through the day. Now, you'll need to schedule basic activities.</p>
<li>Establish a regular wake/sleep schedule. It's really easy to sleep until noon and stay up way too late. Don't do it. It will put you out of synch with the rest of your household and minimize the daylight you see.</li>
<a>anxiety</a>. It bolsters your immune system too!
<li>Assign different tasks to different days. Scheduling different chores for different days may seem quaint, but it can be helpful. Integrate your school and work. It helps remind you what day it is and makes sure less pressing tasks get done. </li>
<p>This is a great time to learn that exercise doesn’t require a gym. How?</p>
<li>Bike! Social distance is guaranteed if you're pedaling a vehicle that requires space to operate.</li>
<li>The 7 Minute Workout. If you can't leave home, the NY Times has a truly challenging <a>Scientific 7 minute workout</a> that will get your heart pumping and your muscles in tune. And yes, there's an app for that. </li>
<li>Yoga and Tai Chi. Both yoga and tai chi can be practiced in any space, without fancy clothing, and without a teacher. Both also reduce stress. There are many on-line resources that start with simple routines. </li>
<li>Chair Aerobics. <a>Chair aerobic</a>s can get your heart pumping and your muscles in shape without even leaving your desk. They are also surprisingly challenging, especially exercises that require you to keep your arms or legs above your head. </li>
<p>Schedule Your <a>Social Life</a>. You are going to have to work at maintaining - or even strengthening! - relationships when you're apart. </p>
<p>Bottom Line: It's going to take work.</p>
<a>stressful</a> situation is something you will use to build new skills and
<a>resilience</a>. Those are great skills to have even when this crazy semester is over.

<h1> Why Are Puppies So Cute? </h1>
<h2> Puppies 101: What puppies can teach us about psychology. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Loki: 10 weeks</div> <div>Source: Nancy Darling</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Everyone responds differently to stress. Our family adopted a puppy. </p>
<p>It wasn't a casual decision. We had been talking about it for 18 months. I'd been lurking on PetFinder for over a year and making inquiries with friends and family since last summer. </p>
<p>But this week, it happened. Meet Loki.</p>
<p>Apparently, I'm not alone. Shelters have been <a>flooded with volunteers</a> to foster animals in the past few weeks. </p>
<a>attention</a> to be well trained and socialized. We have the time! Shelters need as much help as they can, as animals keep coming in, and strict hygiene measures make it especially challenging to arrange for
<a>pets</a> and new families to meet right now.
<p>So this is the first in a series on what puppies can teach us about psychology. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Loki: 6 Weeks</div> <div>Source: Nancy Darling</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>caregiving</a> response in humans. Kittens, anime characters, and infants typically evoke an "Aww..." As a developmental psychologist, I know that as soon as I flash a baby—any kind of baby—up on a screen, the whole class will melt.
<p>The qualities that do that are well established:</p>
<ul><li>Small size (it's so cute!)</li> <li>Large head relative to the body</li> <li>Large eyes relative to the head</li> <li>Eyes low in the face</li> <li>Round cheeks and bulbous forehead</li> <li>Small nose and chin</li> </ul>
<a>villains</a> do not. They are thinner, have smaller heads and eyes, longer noses, sharper chins, and (of course) bigger teeth. Interestingly, the "harmers" (sidekicks of the bad guys often added for
<a>humor</a>) have a mix of qualities that include both babyish features and those of villains.
<a>John Bowlby</a>—following Darwin and others—hypothesized that "babyness" was part of the human

<a>whining</a> or crying, and by other evoking stimuli, which the small being in need of care emits. Most people immediately respond to these characteristics by a release of
<a>oxytocin</a>—the "cuddle"
<a>hormone</a>—and a flush of warm feeling and the desire to soothe and snuggle whoever or whatever is emitting the stimuli. Even very young children respond that way. In an experimental manipulation of "cuteness,"
<p>Baby animals are even cuter than baby humans.</p>
<p>Both adults and young children preferred looking at animals to human faces. The <a>authors write</a>:</p>
<p>As I said, puppies (and kittens) are cute. Interestingly, people's responses were independent of pet ownership. </p>
<p>Younger is not more babyish.</p>
<p>Many dogs bred to be <a>lap dogs</a> retain their "puppiness" into adulthood. Almost all have very short noses, small mouths, bulbous foreheads, and large heads. They retain their cuteness for a lifetime.</p>
<p>And that makes them all the easier to love.</p>

<li>Other workplaces remain open, but government actions prevent schools, daycare centers, and informal caregivers from providing the supervision needed for parents to work. </li>
<li>Still, other workplaces take advantage of internet technology to allow parents to work from home. Although parents can continue to work and are available to supervise children, they can’t do both at the same time.</li>
