<div> <div> <h1>Autism and Related Conditions</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Autism is often accompanied by a range of medical or psychiatric conditions, such as anxiety, ADHD, epilepsy, sleep problems, and gastrointestinal problems. The scientific understanding of this overlap is often elusive.</p>
<p>Addressing co-occurring problems won't eliminate the core features of autism. Yet treating specific symptoms that people are struggling with can tremendously improve daily life for those on the spectrum.</p>
<a>30 to 80 percent</a> of children with autism meet the criteria for ADHD, and 20 to 50 percent of children with ADHD meet the criteria for autism. Clinicians can now provide a dual diagnosis for children with both conditions, per the DSM-5.
<p><a>Autism and ADHD</a> can look very similar, as both involve struggles with communication, social cues, attention, and impulsivity. Scientists are currently investigating the biological and genetic roots that the conditions may share.</p>
<a>40 percent</a> of children with
<p>Parents of children struggling with anxiety can aim to identify what specifically triggers anxiety in their child, and then plan for or modify those triggers. They may explore treatment options such as medication or cognitive-behavioral therapy.</p>
<h2> Autism and Depression </h2>
<p>People with autism are <a>four times more likely</a> to suffer from depression than neurotypical individuals. This trend may be due to genetics as well as the <a>loneliness,</a> bullying, or rumination that some with autism face.</p>
<h2> Autism and Sleep Problems </h2>
<a>twice as common</a> for children with autism than for neurotypical children. People with autism can have
<a>trouble falling asleep or staying asleep</a> throughout the night. Even worse, a poor night of sleep may exacerbate symptoms of autism, like social impairments and repetitive behaviors.
<p>Sleep problems may be due symptoms of autism such as sensory sensitivity or the conditions that often co-occur with autism, such as ADHD, anxiety, and digestive problems. The genetic underpinnings of autism may also play a role.</p>
<a>Good sleep hygiene,</a> especially keeping a consistent bedtime routine, can help people with autism get a good night’s rest
<h2> Autism and Gastrointestinal Problems </h2>
<a>fuel digestive problems.</a>
<p>Parents or individuals with autism should consult their doctor about which diets or programs they can explore. Anecdotally, some parents have reported that cutting out wheat, gluten or dairy has been helpful.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>How Is Autism Treated?</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Programs that make use of applied behavior analysis (ABA) have become widely accepted as the standard of treatment. In the most effective programs, parents are encouraged to be highly involved in their children's care.</p>
<p>While no medication can eliminate the impairments common to autism, psychoactive drugs including antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are often prescribed to help control specific symptoms.</p>
<h2> Is there a cure for autism? </h2>
<p>Autism cannot be cured with a treatment, intervention, or medication. But various therapies can help many children <a>improve social and communication skills,</a> reduce repetitive behaviors, and function well in daily life.</p>
<a>leverage their passion into a career.</a> Others may have an intellectual disability or
<a>struggle with violent outbursts.</a> Most fall somewhere in between. The success of treatment can vary with the condition.
<h2> How is autism treated? </h2>
<p>Autism is often treated with <a>behavioral therapies.</a> The most widely used is called Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), which helps children develop concrete skills to communicate, form relationships, and navigate daily life.</p>
<h2> What is applied behavior analysis? </h2>
<p>ABA centers around understanding the components of a specific behavior—the trigger, the behavior, and the consequence—and <a>rewarding and reinforcing the desired behavior</a> at each step.</p>
<h2> How much ABA therapy is recommended? </h2>
<h2> Does everyone in the autism community support ABA? </h2>
<h2> Why are early interventions so important? </h2>
<p>An early diagnosis and treatment plan also provides parents with support earlier, which can alleviate their stress and strengthen their relationship with their child.</p>
<h2> Which medications treat autism? </h2>
<p>There are no medications that treat the underlying symptoms of autism. However, <a>many medications target related problems</a> and can improve daily life for those on the spectrum.</p>
<p>For example, antipsychotics might be prescribed to treat tantrums, aggression, and self-injury. Stimulants might be prescribed to treat difficulties with attention and hyperactivity. An anticonvulsant may be critical for treating seizures. </p>
<h2> Should I medicate my autistic child? </h2>
<h2> Can autism be treated in adulthood? </h2>

<div> <div> <h1>What Causes Autism?</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>The unsatisfying answer to this question is that scientists still don’t fully grasp what leads to autism. Rather than a single gene or lifestyle trend, autism is the result of complex interactions between many different factors.</p>
<p>The number of children diagnosed with the disorder has risen dramatically since the 1960s. Experts believe that much of the change can be attributed to changes in diagnostic criteria and greater awareness among clinicians and the general public.</p>
<h2> What are genetic risk factors for autism? </h2>
<p>It is important to understand that having genetic risk factors for autism does not mean that a person will necessarily go on to develop the condition.</p>
<h2> Do environmental factors cause autism? </h2>
<a>diabetes,</a> high blood pressure, and infection during pregnancy. Having an older father is also a risk factor, likely because the chance of spontaneous genetic mutations increases with age.
<h2> Do vaccines cause autism? </h2>
<p>No. There is no connection between vaccines and autism. Vaccines are powerful tools that doctors and parents rely on to protect children from dangerous illnesses.</p>
<a>deeply flawed and later retracted</a> by the journal that published it. Rigorous research has continued to find no connection between the two.
<h2> What prenatal factors increase the risk of autism? </h2>
<a> thalidomide or valproic acid</a> during pregnancy can raise the risk of autism, according to the CDC. There is some research that antidepressant use during pregnancy increases the risk of autism, but that research is not yet definitive.
<a>diabetes,</a> or high blood pressure during pregnancy. This may be due to the manner in which
<a>inflammation and the immune response</a> influence the developing fetus. There also seem to be correlations between autism risk and pregnancies that are less than a year apart.
<p>Some evidence indicates taking prenatal vitamins containing folic acid, vitamin B-9, and vitamin D may offer some protection and reduce the likelihood of autism.</p>
<h2> What is causing rates of autism to increase? </h2>
<a>prevalence of autism has continued to rise</a> over the past few decades. Today,
<a>1 in 54 children</a> are estimated to have autism, according to the CDC. Research suggests that this surge is not due to changes in the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the condition. The rising prevalence is instead likely due to
<a>changes in the diagnostic criteria and greater awareness of autism and its symptoms.</a>
<h2> Are boys more likely than girls to have autism? </h2>
<p>Autism occurs <a>4 times more often</a> in boys than in girls. This asymmetry may be due to a combination of biological and diagnostic forces. </p>
<h2> Why are boys more likely to have autism? </h2>
<a>extreme form of the male brain,</a> the theory goes, as men tend to be drawn to systems and efficiency while women excel at empathy and reading emotions. Others have
<a>pushed back</a> that underlying biological differences between the sexes could not be large enough to account for the condition and the idea hasn’t been replicated by other scholars.
<p>From a diagnostic perspective, clinicians may be more aware of the condition in boys and therefore identify it more readily. Additionally, the instruments to screen and diagnose the conditions were created and validated on males.</p>
<a>symptoms may present differently,</a> and they may learn to camouflage the condition. Women may be overlooked or misdiagnosed as a result, but finally receiving a diagnosis has the
<a>potential to be life-changing.</a>
