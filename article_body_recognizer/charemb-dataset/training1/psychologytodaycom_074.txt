<a>cheating occurs even in happy relationships</a>. The partner being betrayed, however, may feel confusion,
<a>anger</a>, doubt, pain, and heartbreak.
<div> <h3> What are the main reasons why people cheat? </h3> </div>
<a>marriage</a>. Betrayal can lead to
<a>divorce</a> and parental disruption, and infidelity is a predictor of
<a>domestic violence</a>. Yet many stray anyway, prompting the question: Why? In surveys of individuals who have cheated,
<a>falling out of love, seeking variety, and feeling neglected</a> were the most commonly cited reasons, followed by situational forces, a desire to raise
<a>self-esteem</a>, and anger with a partner.
<div> <h3> Do men stray more than women? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do most people stay faithful? </h3> </div>
<a>fear that their own partner would retaliate</a> by cheating on them.
<div> <h3> Why do some partners wrongly accuse each other of cheating? </h3> </div>
<a>projecting their own wandering eye</a> onto their partner.
<div> <h3> Are there couples that embrace infidelity? </h3> </div>
<a>committed but open relationships</a>, a cohort that demographic research finds to be growing. But
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> What People Consider Infidelity </h2>
<a>flirtation</a> and romantic betrayal is often elastic, and many couples face conflict because partners do not share the same definition of cheating. For some, anything short of
<a>sexual</a> contact with someone else is acceptable; for others,
<a>any attention to a potential rival</a> is unforgivable.
<div> <h3> Is fantasizing about others bad for a relationship? </h3> </div>
<a>Sexual fantasies</a> are another matter. While many experts believe sexual fantasies about other people, if they are not acted on and do not become a fixation,
<a>are not necessarily unhealthy for a relationship</a> and may help maintain sexual energy and interest. But researchers emphasize that sexual fantasies about one’s own partner contribute more to a relationship.
<div> <h3> Is pornography a form of cheating? </h3> </div>
<a>be as open as possible</a> with each other, and discuss if one partner’s consistent use of porn points to signs of trouble in the couple’s own sexual connection.
<div> <h3> What is emotional infidelity? </h3> </div>
<h2> Surviving Infidelity </h2>
<a>attachment</a> as well as sex. In one survey, 44 percent of men who’d had affairs said it was only about sex, but only 11 percent of women reported the same.
<div> <h3> How does someone decide whether to stay with a partner who cheated? </h3> </div>
<a>parenting</a> of young children. But research also finds that one of the strongest indicators of whether a couple will remain together is the opinions and advice of
<a>the wronged partner’s social network</a> of friends and family.
<div> <h3> Can you trust a partner who has cheated before? </h3> </div>
<a>three times more likely to stray in a future relationship</a>, as compared to people who had not been unfaithful before. Individuals who have cheated have also been found likely to
<a>express hypocrisy about infidelity</a>: They blame their partner’s actions for their own straying, but take no responsibility for their partner’s unfaithful acts.

<h2> Unfortunately, most organizations are not pivoting effectively to meet Omicron. </h2>

<p>Leaders are sticking their heads into the sand of reality on Omicron. Unless they take the needed steps, the results may be catastrophic for their companies.</p>
<p>Omicron took over from Delta in the U.S. in late December. That’s because Omicron is 4.2 times more infectious than Delta, according to a recent study. </p>
<p>A Pfizer booster vaccine does raise protection to about 75%. Still, surveys show that Omicron has had very little impact on the willingness of Americans to get a booster, or even get a first vaccine dose.</p>
<p>The government is not taking any meaningful actions. That means companies need to take charge. Yet there’s a fundamental lack of vision about the future of work that may cause companies to lose their competitive advantage.</p>
<h3>Lack of Meaningful Action</h3>
<p>But it’s not taking the real game-changing steps.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most companies are not pivoting effectively to meet Omicron.</p>
<h3>Mental Blindspots Obscuring Leadership Vision</h3>
<p>Leaders—and all of us—are prone to falling for dangerous judgment errors called cognitive biases. Rooted in wishful thinking, these mental blindspots lead to poor strategic and financial decisions when evaluating choices.</p>
<a>fear</a> danger. Delta illustrated the high likelihood of additional dangerous variants, yet the
<a>leadership</a> at trillion-dollar companies—and the federal government—denied the reality of this risk.
<p>In our desperation to get back to pre-pandemic times, we greatly underestimate the probability and impact of major disruptors, like new COVID variants. This cognitive bias is called the normalcy bias.</p>
<p>When we stick to our preconceived ways of functioning, this syndrome is called functional fixedness. This cognitive bias causes leaders used to office-centric culture and ways of collaborating to reject any alternatives.</p>
<a>collaboration</a>, and accountability for hybrid and remote teams. In short, instead of trying to turn back the clock to the lost world of January 2020, consider how you might create competitive advantage in the post-COVID future of work.

<div> <p>How can you change someone’s mind? And how are you swayed by others? Persuasion refers to the influence people have on one another—changing someone’s beliefs, decisions, or actions through reasoning or request.</p> </div>

<h2> The Principles of Persuasion </h2>
<div> <h3> What are the principles of persuasion? </h3> </div>
<p>The psychologist Robert Cialdini developed <a>six principles of persuasion</a> which have been used in business schools as well as in boardrooms. They are: </p>
<p>• Reciprocity: People feel the need to give back to someone who provided a product, service, or information.</p>
<p>• Scarcity: People want items that they believe are in short supply.</p>
<p>• Authority: People are swayed by a credible expert on a particular topic.</p>
<p>• Consistency: People strive to be consistent in their beliefs and behaviors.</p>
<p>• Likability: People are influenced by those who are similar, complimentary, and cooperative.</p>
<p>• Consensus: People tend to make choices that seem popular among others.</p>

<h2> How to Be Persuasive </h2>
<div> <h3> How can I be more persuasive? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I be more assertive? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I deter someone from their current belief? </h3> </div>
<a>Attempting to persuade someone</a> involves “threatening their freedom” to some degree. Reminding people of their freedom in choosing how to act or what to believe can help overcome this reaction.
<div> <h3> How can I avoid being persuaded by other people? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I promote myself and my work, including on social media? </h3> </div>
<a>brand yourself the right way.</a> In addition to promoting your achievements, share how hard you work, express
<a>gratitude</a> for those who supported you, or mention an area in which you still need to improve. This can prevent you from coming across as too self-centered or arrogant.
<div> <h3> Can I convince someone to seek mental health care? </h3> </div>
<a>To encourage someone to seek therapy,</a> help them become aware that they need support, because they may not connect the dots between physical or psychological symptoms and a condition such as
<a>stress</a> reduction. If you are still concerned, you can point out that combining other changes with
<a>therapy</a> could lead to a faster recovery.
<p>Be sure to help with the concrete steps of finding a therapist, calling to make an appointment, and following through over time.</p>

<div> <h3> Can I convince myself of something I want to believe? </h3> </div>
<a>cognitive-behavioral therapy</a> and
<a>positive self-talk.</a> You can also shift your perspective with straightforward reasoning. One trick is to pretend that you’re convincing someone else, because you may work to generate stronger arguments and thereby 
<a>change your own mind in the process</a>.
<h2> Persuasion in Marketing </h2>
<div> <h3> How do marketers persuade customers to purchase their products? </h3> </div>
<a>Robert Cialdini calls pre-suasion.</a> What the person sees, hears, or feels before getting a message about a product or service can influence how they receive it, and companies can aim to make sure their audience is primed correctly.
<div> <h3> What online advertising tactics are persuasive to consumers? </h3> </div>
<a>humor</a>, or anger, also make the
<a>user experience more salient and persuasive,</a> as is also the case offline.
<div> <h3> How should companies promote their products in advertisements? </h3> </div>
<a>advertising</a> a product’s strengths and overpromising what it can deliver. Some research has found that the
<h2> Persuasion in Politics </h2>
<div> <h3> What makes a political message persuasive? </h3> </div>
<a>anxiety</a>, anger, and disgust on the other, move people to vote. The third is to tell a coherent memorable story rather than state a policy platform; the brain is wired to understand, remember, and pass along information presented as narrative.
<div> <h3> Why is misinformation so effective? </h3> </div>
<a>folding of hearsay and conviction into memory networks</a>, are not flaws—they're efficiencies in building a cohesive cosmology. But they leave us vulnerable to predatory rumormongers.
<div> <h3> How can leaders incentivize change? </h3> </div>
<a>economic incentives often fail to achieve community goals.</a>
<div> <h3> What kinds of protests are most persuasive? </h3> </div>
<a>aggression</a> sometimes necessary in order to generate pressure for change? Research suggests that a combination of these approaches may garner the most support.
<a>Protests that are both nonviolent and nonnormative</a> (outside the bounds of normal behavior)—such as boycotting, striking, sit-ins, or refusing to pay fines or taxes—create pressure for change while maintaining broad public support.
