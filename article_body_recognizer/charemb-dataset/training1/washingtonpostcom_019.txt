<div><div><p>“Due to the victim being assaulted,” Nashville police stated, “the defendant is being charged with assault-fear of bodily injury.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>A spokesman for the police told the <a>Tennessean</a> that the employee was using his phone to film the scene. He was treated for a cut on his forehead, the spokesman added, and a female employee was treated for a cut on her hand.</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Des Bieler</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 9:08 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Aaron Rodgers had strong words Wednesday for a member of the Associated Press’s NFL MVP award voting panel who had called the Green Bay Packers quarterback a “jerk” and a “bad guy.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I think he’s a bum,” Rodgers said to reporters of Hub Arkush, a reporter for Westwood One and a Chicago Bears-focused writer, editor and analyst on other platforms. “I think he’s an absolute bum.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Arkush made his comments Tuesday in an appearance on Chicago’s 670 the Score in which he was asked about having previously indicated he would not vote for Rodgers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Arkush added that there were “no guidelines” issued to MVP voters.</p></div></div>
<a>fined by the NFL</a> for violating league
<a>making misleading statements</a> about vaccines and homeopathic remedies and
<a>lashed out at what he called a “woke mob”</a> as well as media members he said were “trying to shame and out and cancel all us unvaccinated people.”
<a>reaffirmed his vaccine skepticism</a> last month, returned to the lineup after the Packers lost that game to the Chiefs and has since guided his team to six wins in its past seven games. The Packers are 13-3 and have clinched
<a>the top seed in the NFC playoffs</a>.
<a>seeming ambivalence</a> last summer about
<a>playing for Green Bay</a> this season. Claiming that Rodgers’s public uncertainty then “ruined the entire offseason” for the Packers, Arkush said, “He tortured their fan base, and he’s already
<a>started doing it again</a>.”
<div><div><p>With Arkush’s comments having gained widespread notice and spurring <a>criticism</a>, he returned to Chicago’s airwaves Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I made a big mistake last night,” he <a>told</a> 670 the Score.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Arkush explained that his regrets were not based on how Rodgers might perceive his comments but on having put the other 49 MVP voters in “an unfortunate position.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s just wrong,” he continued, “and I feel awful about it and wish it hadn’t happened.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Portis is expected to report to prison in March.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ben Golliver</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 16, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Nearly three years into retirement, Dwyane Wade seems fully at peace with his place in the NBA’s pantheon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In contrast to Scottie Pippen, who spent a recent book tour rehashing old grudges with Michael Jordan, the Miami Heat legend and three-time champion sounds fulfilled and future-focused, with a clear-eyed self-perception.</p></div></div>
<a>purchasing a stake in the Utah Jazz in April</a>. Meanwhile, he has made a smooth transition to life as a commentator for TNT and maintains an entertaining social media presence with his wife, actress Gabrielle Union, and children.
<div><p>After teaming up for two titles, Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry are thriving apart</p></div>
<div><p><b>Q: You write in the book, “I earned every single last one of those free throws in that 2006 Finals.” Does the perception of the officiating in that series — which capped your first title run — bother you?</b></p></div>
<div><div><p>A: It bothered me when I was young. It doesn’t bother me today. When you talk about the 2006 Finals, it’s obviously a part of the conversation.</p></div></div>
<b>Q: This season the NBA has </b>
<a><b>instructed referees to stop calling fouls on “non-basketball moves”</b></a>
<b> such as arm hooking and pump-faking and jumping into a defender. A couple of stars have complained. Do you like the game better with these rule changes?</b>
<div><div><p><b>Q: Maybe the most famous foul of your career came when you broke Kobe Bryant’s nose during the 2012 All-Star Game. What do you remember about that play and your conversation with him afterward?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As Kobe Bryant would do, he was like: “I love it. Don’t worry about it. I’ll see you in a couple days.” The conversation was very short. [laughs]</p></div></div>
<b>Q: You played with LeBron James during his athletic prime. He’s 36 now and has dealt with a few minor injuries to start this season. Are you sensing that he has reached the point where he has to adjust his game like you did as you got older?</b>
<div><p>How the NBA popped its scoring bubble (and why the league is so thrilled about it)</p></div>
<div><p>A: That process took until we got back to the Finals again. It was that long. You carry that thing. You don’t let it go. Do you get into the season and try to put it behind you? Yeah, but it burns inside you 1,000 percent.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: You clearly relished matchups with stars like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. But who did you hate playing against?</b></p></div></div>
<div><p><b>Q: You purchased an ownership stake in the Jazz, and your family went viral recently for celebrating when your son, Zaire, was drafted by Utah’s G League affiliate. What was it like to share that experience with him?</b></p></div>
<p>I’m thankful that the Salt Lake City Stars wanted to see this young player who they felt had an opportunity to grow and develop in our system. He’s my son. There’s a little DNA in there. Maybe something comes out of it, right?</p>

<h1>Shawn Kemp is lighting up Seattle again</h1>
<div>As the legal weed boom shuts out Black Americans, the former SuperSonics star is vowing to diversify the industry. So why are cannabis activists mad at their hometown hero?</div>
<div> <div> By Kent Babb </div> <div>December 31, 2020</div> </div>
<p>“I’ll tell you what it was, man. It was, the name of it was …” he says. “What was it called?”</p>
<p>He shakes his head before taking another drag off his Freddy’s Fuego Animal Gas pre-roll. But it’s not the marijuana that has dulled Kemp’s memory. It’s the years.</p>
<p>“Well anyways,” he says.</p>
<p>“The Box!” Kemp says, remembering at last. “For years that kept me away from having a lot of trouble.”</p>
<p>“They’ve propped one of our local heroes up as a puppet,” says Aaron Barfield, a member of Black Excellence in Cannabis and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. “He’s definitely being used.”</p>
<p>“What’s up, Shawn?” he says.</p>
<p>Kemp greets him with a smile. He makes no effort to hide his pre-roll.</p>
<p>“Could I get a picture?”</p>
<p>Kemp nods, walks toward the sidewalk and drapes a long arm around the skinny jogger.</p>
<p>“How’s the shop doing?” the jogger says.</p>
<p>“It’s working, man,” Kemp says.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to stop by.”</p>
<p>“Just one block,” Kemp says, sounding like a salesman. “Straight down and to the right.”</p>
<p>It feels, at times, like a bizarre dream that takes place entirely in the ’90s. Two “NBA Jam” arcade machines sit near a window, and Erykah Badu’s caressing voice floats through the speakers.</p>
<p><i>I'm feeling high.</i></p>
<p>Kemp smiles, greets customers, signs autographs. Especially for Seattleites of a certain age, this is like meeting Santa Claus, if Santa wore green studs in his ears and had a sneaker deal with Reebok.</p>
<p>Looking back, Ament says, “It was just like being around magic.”</p>
<p>“The worst 31 days ever,” he says with a laugh. “But you go through it.”</p>
<p>“There are so many of these guys that have been arrested. What did they do to them?” he says. “I realized, down south, s--- can change fast.”</p>
<p>“We smoke it, but we don’t own it,” Kemp says. “Let’s see if we can change that.”</p>
<p>A few months ago, it was time to make his move. But even with name recognition, connections and capital, Kemp says, the process of opening a cannabis shop at times felt “undoable.” He nearly gave up.</p>
<p>“They make it so tough for people, man, that it drives some people away,” he says. “The state has just put up walls, if you see what I’m saying.”</p>
<p>In case you don’t, he just says it: “It’s definitely discrimination.”</p>
<p>Back in the ’90s, Peter Manning lived in a rundown stretch on Seattle’s south end. Police raids and drug busts were common, he says, and Manning knew neighbors and uncles and cousins who disappeared into prison sentences.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always bad, such as when Kemp showed up to play catch with kids or strike up conversations with grown-ups. He shot baskets and paid for groceries and made everyone feel important.</p>
<p>“The Black Robin Hood,” Manning says now. “We all love him, man.”</p>
<p>In 2014, two years after Washington and Colorado legalized recreational weed, Manning heard early-morning rapping on his front door in a rural part of the state. The cops were outside with a search warrant.</p>
<p>Manning says his wife nonetheless lost her job and they spent $12,000 fighting the charges. They lost their house, he says, and their marriage fell apart. He traces it all back to that morning in 2014.</p>
<p>“They made us look like just terrible people,” Manning says. “I was growing weed, and they knew I was Black. That was illegal in Washington, even though that was legal.”</p>
<p>Kemp was not involved in the licensing process, Hamide says, and he received a 5 percent ownership stake. Of the six owners of Shawn Kemp’s Cannabis, Shawn Kemp has the second-smallest stake.</p>
<p>“Obviously they wouldn’t let no Blacks in this business, so I had to go around the corner to get in this joint,” Kemp says. “I found a way.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been fighting for inclusion for years,” Barfield says. “And we see one of our heroes being manipulated to exploit a situation that’s exploiting us.”</p>
<p>Manning puts it more plainly. He says the big man got played by savvy cannabis barons who knew Kemp’s name and face on the building would draw in customers, especially those privileged enough to remember the past fondly.</p>
<p>“I looked at him different,” he continues. “I’ve looked at him as a hero, but I don’t look at him like that anymore. I think he sold us out.”</p>
<p>Kemp is in the basement of his cannabis shop, lounging on a sofa as employees check inventory and construction workers prepare the store’s second phase. Talking over the clang and shuffle, he says not everything is how it appears.</p>
<p>“It’s none of their business,” Kemp says. “They didn’t deserve to know, because they never asked me.”</p>
<p>For the moment, he’s not talking about the present. His mind is back in the ’90s.</p>
<p>In the years after Sports Illustrated’s fatherhood story, Kemp became private and more suspicious. He became increasingly sensitive to racist stereotypes, he says, even refusing to do “the mean face” during photo shoots.</p>
<p>“The perception of a guy on the basketball court dunking and yelling and screaming and having fun is that he’s probably a pretty mean guy,” he says. “But it’s just the opposite.”</p>
<p>Kemp knows he has made plenty of mistakes. But fatherhood, he says, isn’t one of them.</p>
<p>He has been married for 20 years to the mother of his three youngest sons, he says. His nine kids are now grown, and Kemp points out that he put each of them through college. All but one, a college student in Louisiana, live in the Seattle area.</p>
<p>“My kids is what made me accountable for every damn day I had to get up,” he says. “Because they look at you.”</p>
<p>“Not cool,” he writes in a text message. “Not sure what your trying to do, but thats enough.”</p>
<p>Again, he says, outside critics are making assumptions about him and his intentions. Only this time, they’re Seattleites.</p>
<div> After announcing the shop as Seattle's first Black-owned dispensary, Kemp and his partners retracted that claim. (Ted S. Warren/AP) </div>
<p>“What they’re saying is not necessarily wrong,” Kemp says, referring to the activists associated with Black Excellence in Cannabis. “What they’re saying is — they don’t know everything.”</p>
<p>Mvududu, 23 and thin, has the invisible ball and is charging through the phantom lane. Kemp sets his feet as Mvududu goes up for a fadeaway shot, then swats it away.</p>
<p>“I block his shots all the time!” Kemp says with pride, though the young man smiles and protests. Kemp shrugs because that’s what happens in the big leagues, when you go up against an opponent this powerful.</p>
<p>“They kind of looked on weed like crack almost,” Mvududu says. “It’s just weed.”</p>
<p>Garza says 34 licenses have been returned to the state and that regulators have set those aside for social equity applicants. He says he expects those to be assigned and the task force to deliver its recommendations sometime in 2021.</p>
<p>“We want to do everything we can at the state level,” Garza says, “to make this right.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Kemp has insisted on staff diversity. Mvududu is one of several Black employees, and when Kemp opens his second location next year, he plans to bring Mvududu along to run the office.</p>
<p>“Come on in,” Kemp says with a smile, and the eyes look up and recognize him as the line starts to move.</p>

<p>Stephen Curry began his journey to the top of the NBA’s all-time three-pointers list Oct. 30, 2009, as a 21-year-old rookie playing in his second career game.</p>
<p>Television broadcaster Gary Bender greeted the shot by calling Curry, the son of former NBA sharpshooter Dell Curry, “one of the pure shooters you’re ever going to see coming out of college.” Indeed.</p>
<p>“I obviously know I’m closing in, but I try not to let it creep into how you play,” Curry said last week. “You just enjoy the journey to get there. It does mean a lot to me.”</p>

<div><p>While Curry seemingly has plenty of high-level basketball ahead of him, he has reached summit in just his 13th season at age 33.</p></div>
<div><p>His rapid ascent is even more remarkable because he got a late start, compared with some of his peers, because he spent three seasons in college at Davidson.</p></div>
<div><p>Curry is five years younger than Allen was when he set the record.</p></div>
<div><p>Despite significant injuries in his third season and in 2019-20, he broke the record having played fewer than 800 games.</p></div>

<p>One of the best things about Stephen Curry is the buildup. You can’t simply watch a game he plays in as it unfolds. If you stick to the normal way, following where the ball goes and who it will find, you will miss it. The fun of it all.</p>

<a>he wiggles his shoulders with teammate Juan Toscano-Anderson</a> and pretends to sink a putt with brother-in-law Damion Lee. This is what makes Curry, the performer, so great. Because after all the giggles and goofy dances, he turns deadly.
<div><div><p>His threes have been soul-crushing. Notice the timeouts they compel rival coaches to call or how slowly opposing teams respond in taking the ball out of bounds to reset after he pulls up from far away.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“He’s Steph Curry,” Warriors Coach Steve Kerr told reporters, “so anything’s possible.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When he left the court that night with (only) six made three-pointers, the anticipation continued to build.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Similarly, the anticipation had New Yorkers behaving like turncoats Tuesday night. The fans abandoned their seats every time the Warriors got the ball, and about a minute into the game, Curry commanded the stage.</p></div></div>
<p>The three-pointer ripped the net, and Madison Square Garden — the arena known as basketball mecca — and the rest of the sport could stop standing still in anticipation. It was time to celebrate the greatest showman in the game.</p>

<div><div><p>Becky Hammon finally will be a head coach. The Las Vegas Aces, an organization in the WNBA, gave her an overdue opportunity, and she will have the control and the support needed to build a championship contender.</p></div></div>
<a>hit the right notes</a> during her introductory news conference. Yet beyond the genuine warmth and happiness for Hammon achieving a career goal, there was a conflicting emotion: an unshakable feeling of disappointment.

<div><p>As Curry rose to prominence in the mid-2010s, leading the Warriors to three titles and five straight NBA Finals appearances while winning two MVP awards, he became known as the most devastating three-point shooter in league history.</p></div>

<div><div><p>When Morant returned to Staples Center on Sunday with a game-high 40 points and 10 assists in a narrow loss to the Los Angeles Lakers, Carmelo Anthony said simply, “He is the future of this NBA.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re going to war with Ja,” Grizzlies guard Desmond Bane said. “That’s our leader. That’s our guy. He’s going to be an all-star, probably an all-NBA player.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Morant launched seven three-pointers against both the Clippers and the Lakers, and he made five to take LeBron James and company to the wire.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Unfortunately, Morant’s masterpiece against the Lakers was spoiled in the closing seconds when he drew a foul on a potential game-tying three-pointer but missed his third free throw, denying the Grizzlies a chance to force overtime.</p></div>
<div><div><p>That response — familiar to any perfectionist — exemplifies why the Grizzlies are quick to point out that Morant’s shape-shifting game is only part of what makes him their franchise cornerstone.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“A lot of gratitude to just be present tonight with everyone,” Irving said after shooting 9 for 17 in 32 minutes, “to go out there and have fun doing what we love to do.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the afterglow of Wednesday’s comeback, the Nets understandably focused on the benefits of Irving’s return rather than these potential complications.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“We have that target on our back,” Irving acknowledged. “We have aspirations to be playing later in the postseason.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>It was easy to miss during a busy holiday weekend that included entertaining Christmas matchups and a continuous parade of call-ups for omicron-ravaged rosters, but the NBA’s 2022 all-star voting process opened Saturday.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>To start the culling process in earnest, here’s an overview of which 2021 all-stars could be on their way out and which aspiring first-timers might replace them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>East backcourt</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Kyrie Irving is attempting a part-time return</a> with the Brooklyn Nets, media and coach voters should not reward him for what will amount to less than one month of action before voting closes Jan. 22.

<div><div><p>DeMar DeRozan doubled the fireworks over the New Year’s weekend, lifting the Chicago Bulls to the top of the Eastern Conference with a pair of buzzer-beating game-winners.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I don’t know if I’m dreaming [or] if it’s real right now,” DeRozan said after the win over Washington, which moved the Bulls (24-10) past the Brooklyn Nets (23-11) and into the East’s No. 1 spot.</p></div>
