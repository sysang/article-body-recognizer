<div><div><p>“I think around 90 percent or more of our officers signed the agreement,” the chief said. “So we’re going to have a lot less people leave this next year.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Officers who were with the department on Jan. 6 also got a $2,000 “hazard pay” bonus, Manger said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. Capitol Police inspector general says only a small number of recommendations after Jan. 6 attack have been adopted</p></div>
<div><div><p>Manger disputed a claim by the Capitol Police inspector general, Michael A. Bolton, that only 30 of 104 recommendations made by Bolton after the attack had been implemented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have addressed or are in the process of addressing over 90 of them,” Manger said, “and the inspector general has acknowledged that to me” with many classified as “resolved but open.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A year later, the House of Representatives can still look like a crime scene some days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the detectors aren’t there to deter armed insurrectionists. Instead, those detectors are there to prevent lawmakers or their staff from trying to commit violence against each other.</p></div></div>
<p>Trust in one another, whether to clinch a critical legislative deal or to protect each other from violence, seems to be at an all-time low one year after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol with both Democrats and Republicans in their crosshairs.</p>
<div><div><p>“This is — it’s kind of scary.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans, rather than reining in their most controversial members, have dug in with their support for them and now accuse Democrats of a massive overreaction to the threats against the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Interviews with more than 20 members, including Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate, revealed a Congress that remains on edge and where worries about more violence are front of mind for many — and for good reason.</p></div>
<b> </b>In 2017, there were fewer than 4,000 threats against lawmakers, a number that rose to more than 8,600 threats in 2020.
<div><div><p>The tension is less palpable in the Senate, a traditionally more chummy place, where Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), one of the highest-profile objectors to Biden’s election, believes he just had his most bipartisan year ever.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some lawmakers sense the tensions easing a bit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the days following the Jan. 6 attack, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) questioned whether the rioters had inside information because they found his somewhat hidden office on the third floor of the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I have seen that in the last four, six to eight weeks, while at the same time you see Kevin McCarthy acting like a dunce,” he added, referring to the House minority leader.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some Democrats are less worried about the state of current tensions than the future, viewing last January’s attack as an opening salvo by Trump and his supporters that laid the groundwork for bigger clashes to come.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s a great alarm about how they will behave after the 2024 presidential election,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Democrats’ anger</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>That move radicalized some of the most centrist Democrats, the type who usually brag about their bipartisan credentials, and hardened them toward their Republican colleagues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) expressed disbelief that some of the Republicans who faced the greatest threats on Jan. 6 still fall in line behind Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Dec. 8, for instance, those five joined with 15 of the most conservative, pro-Trump Republicans to vote against the Improving the Health of Children Act that would help prevent childhood birth defects.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The bill’s author, Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-Ga.), voted against Biden on both Jan. 6 votes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the other side of the Capitol, the Senate stayed in session — even calling in Vice President Harris to cast a tiebreaking vote for Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Obviously, Davis said, the threat wasn’t that dangerous; otherwise, Harris would not have been allowed anywhere near the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Davis summed up his views of House Democrats in a few words: “We can’t live in fear.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A handful of Democrats, to advance policies they say will help the country, have put aside their anger to work with Republicans who are most supportive of Trump and dismissive of the attack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of the leading liberals, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), has not let Jan. 6 get in the way of his strange-bedfellows coalition, working with Trump’s biggest backers in the House on reining in the Pentagon’s powers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It sometimes means he is working hand in hand with Republicans who were more than passive supporters of the effort to overturn the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A less tense Senate</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Coons also had a John Lewis moment, back in the summer, as he prepared remarks for one of the bipartisan prayer breakfasts he co-chairs, thinking about how Lewis forgave people who assaulted him during his days as a civil rights activist.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The next morning, as he looked into the audience, Coons saw several senators he had not spoken to since they cast votes against Biden’s election, and he thought he needed to find a way to deal with his anger toward them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>One of his best friends in the Senate, James Lankford (R-Okla.), is the other co-chairman of the prayer breakfast, and the duo run the Ethics Committee, a highly sensitive job traditionally given to two of the most trusted senators.</p></div>
<div><div><p>During the five-hour delay to secure the Capitol, Lankford and a few other Republicans withdrew their support for challenging the election, while the others agreed to limit the objections to just Arizona and Pennsylvania.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“At the end of the day all 100 senators all certified the election. Every one of them. Because you have to challenge enough states that day to be able to challenge the election,” Lankford said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>That approach infuriates many Democrats, who view any vote against those two states as supporting Trump and his insurrectionists. “Whatever you need to tell yourself to sleep at night,” Casten said of Lankford’s logic.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But Klobuchar found the actions by Lankford and those few other Republicans to be courageous, switching sides when they realized how out of control things got in the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They could not stomach being on the side of an insurrection. And that actually brings me great solace,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s been a pretty productive year that way, bipartisan,” Hawley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans who completely turned on Trump — 10 voted to impeach in the House, seven voted to convict in the Senate trial — have faced the most isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There is one issue related to Jan. 6 on which lawmakers in both parties have recently found common ground: beefing up their own security in the event of another attack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Delays in getting Guard troops to the Capitol surfaced quickly as a key lapse that helped lead to that day turning more deadly, including confusion about the Capitol Police Board’s process for requesting help.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The measure passed the Senate on Dec. 13 by unanimous consent, sending it to the House for consideration the next day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No one even asked for a recorded vote, and it won unanimous approval.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Every minute counts during an emergency,” Klobuchar said in a statement.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Local</a></div></div><div><h1>How Ashli Babbitt went from Capitol rioter to Trump-embraced ‘martyr’</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Paul Schwartzman</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Josh Dawsey</div></span></div></span></div><div>July 30, 2021 at 7:25 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><p>Her phone rang on that day in early July, nearly six months after a police officer’s bullet killed her daughter as she and a mob of rioters seeking to overturn the election stormed a barricaded door deep inside the U.S. Capitol.</p></div>
<p>Micki Witthoeft answered the call and listened as former president Donald Trump expressed condolences over Ashli Babbitt’s violent death and acknowledged, she said, that her daughter had died Jan. 6 trying to salvage his lost presidency.</p>
<div><div><p>Witthoeft took the opportunity during the 30-minute call to ask Trump for help getting information about Babbitt’s death and to fight for those still imprisoned because of the riot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After their call, the circumstances of Babbitt’s death — once a focus of right-wing extremists and white supremacists — became a talking point for the nation’s most dominant Republican.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Who shot Ashli Babbitt?” Trump asked over and over in the ensuing days, suggesting that the 35-year-old Air Force veteran was the victim of an overzealous Capitol Police officer whose identity was being covered up.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside the Capitol siege: How barricaded lawmakers and aides sounded urgent pleas for help as police lost control</p></div>
<div><div><p>Yet, instead of marauders invading the Capitol, Trump and his acolytes describe a largely peaceful crowd of protesters unfairly maligned and persecuted by prosecutors, Democrats and mainstream journalists.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At the center of their revisionism is Babbitt, their martyr, whose fatal attempt to leap through a door that led to the House chamber — captured in graphic detail on video — they describe as a heroic act of patriotism.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Just before she was shot, Babbitt was among a group of rioters bashing in the glass-paneled doors that led to the Speaker’s Lobby, down the hall from the House chamber, where lawmakers were being evacuated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s a gun! There’s a gun!” someone shouted when an officer, on the other side of the doors, aimed his weapon in the direction of the mob.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the warning, someone appeared to hoist Babbitt up so she could step through an opening in the door created after its glass panels were shattered. A bullet struck her and she fell back on the floor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors determined it was reasonable for the officer to believe he was firing in self-defense or to protect members evacuating the House chamber.</p></div></div>
<a>four police officers </a>catalogued the emotional and physical abuse they suffered defending the Capitol and how betrayed they feel by Republican lawmakers.
<div><p>Trump has complained to aides that his supporters were treated far worse than Black Lives Matter protesters charged last summer, and that the Justice Department and others want to use prosecutions of Jan. 6 crimes to damage him.</p></div>
<p>The former president, according to three advisers, often talks about the “good people” who traveled to Washington that day, and the crowd’s large size, despite encouragement from some confidants to avoid the subject altogether.</p>
<div><div><p>In a statement, Trump confirmed talking to Babbitt’s family and said: “I want to know why is the person who shot Ashli Babbitt getting away with murder?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Vigils, rallies, rap lyrics</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Fox News host Tucker Carlson</a>.
<div><div><p>When Trump invoked Babbitt’s name, right-wing organizers said it became easier to generate public interest for those arrested in the Jan. 6 riot.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It didn’t make me feel more emboldened, but it made other people feel emboldened, which helps me,” said Cara Castronuova of Citizens Against Political Persecution, a New York-based group that has hosted rallies.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“He gives people a voice,” Castronuova said. “They feel if Trump said it, he’s the leader of the United States, so it’s okay to say it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If you believe that,” he said, “you’ll probably respond to a fundraising appeal that comes with it and you’re more likely to show up at a Trump rally. It’s about intensity and money.”</p></div></div>
<p>Stevens, who grew up in Mississippi, compared the Republican campaign to the Lost Cause of the post-Civil War era, in which Southern sympathizers sought to recast defenders of slavery such as Gen. Robert E. Lee as a “benevolent guy.”</p>
<div><p>‘The storm is here’: Ashli Babbitt’s journey from capital ‘guardian’ to invader</p></div>
<p>Until her death, Babbitt had lived the anonymous life of an ordinary American, serving in the military for 14 years. Her tenure included a stint protecting the Washington region with an Air National Guard unit known as the Capital Guardians.</p>
<div><div><p>In recent weeks, Witthoeft said she noticed Babbitt’s name mentioned more frequently on Fox News, Newsmax and OAN, an uptick she attributes to Trump and House Republicans such as Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think everyone should know her name,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘Protecting America’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Say her name!” a speaker shouted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Ashli Babbitt! Ashli Babbitt!” the crowd chanted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“American hero!” a woman yelled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“She was protecting America from the enemies of the people,” Anglin wrote. “There was absolutely no reason to shoot her, and the cop should be charged with murder.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Three months later, federal prosecutors cleared the Capitol Police officer who shot Babbitt of any wrongdoing, saying he had not violated her civil rights.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. Capitol Police officer cleared of wrongdoing in fatal shooting of Ashli Babbitt during Capitol attack</p></div>
<div><div><p>The officer, a lieutenant, was not identified, an omission seized on by House Republicans.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gosar’s statements about Babbitt’s death, as well as those arrested, have been echoed by Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), Louis Gohmert (R-Tex.), and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If this country can demand justice for someone like George Floyd,” Greene told a Newsmax host, “then we can certainly demand justice for Ashli Babbitt.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, she, Gaetz, Gosar and Gohmert showed up at the D.C. jail, demanding to inspect the treatment of those detained in connection with Jan. 6. They were turned away.</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C. jail officials turn away GOP members of Congress who showed up to check on Jan. 6 suspects</p></div>
<div><div><p>Michael Edison Hayden, a spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the narrative suggested by such assertions allows Trump and his allies to “flip what happened and present the attackers as victims.”</p></div></div>
<p>“The only word that comes to mind is the amplification of a fringe narrative,” he said. “It’s not as though the narrative has changed. It’s spread and taken hold in larger portions of Trump’s base.”</p>
<div><div><p>But he said he has had an easier time more recently — a Phoenix rally in mid-July drew 250 people — “because the issue is being taken seriously.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Until those son-of-a-b----es took her out of it, she was in her moment,” Witthoeft said. “They tried to silence Ashli’s voice but all they did was make it louder because America was watching.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Stand tall, stand proud, stand together,” she told the crowd.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the call ended, Castronuova promised the audience that “insurrectionist is no longer going to come up” when they “Google Ashli Babbitt’s name in five years.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They will not rewrite history,” Castronuova shouted. “She’s a martyr, okay?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘A bigger cause’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Not long after, her family boarded a boat and scattered her ashes in the waters off Dog Beach. A bagpiper played “Amazing Grace.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Witthoeft, during the hour-long telephone interview, said she has avoided watching footage of Jan. 6, including “the video of my daughter being murdered.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just won’t do it,” she said, beginning to cry. “They carried my daughter out like a dying animal.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since her daughter’s death, she has become politically active. On Saturday, she attended a Trump rally in Phoenix, where she received a standing ovation when Gosar introduced her.</p></div></div>
<p>Asked about Trump, whose call to her occurred six months after her daughter’s death, Witthoeft laughed nervously and said, “It’s a tricky question. This is such a roller coaster. I feel different things depending on the day.</p>
<p>“Like every other rally, people would’ve cheered them on, and there might have been some little bit of stuff going on,” he said. “Everyone was just pumped up, and the word selection wasn’t the greatest.”</p>
<div><div><p>These days, Michelle Wittheoft said, she writes letters to Jan. 6 arrestees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I plan on writing them all — not because I’m Ashli’s mom — I love and support what they did,” she said. “They’re in jail because they are Trump supporters.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Referring to her daughter, she said, “She made the ultimate sacrifice to bring attention to a stolen election.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Half the country loves her and half the country hates her,” she said. “It’s weird to have your child belong to the world.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>The Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol was neither a spontaneous act nor an isolated event</p></div>
<a>said 140 police officers,</a> including Capitol officers and members of the D.C. police department, were victimized during the attack.
<div><div><p>The office said about 10 individuals were charged with assaulting members of the media or destroying their equipment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some 640 people were charged with entering a restricted federal building or its grounds. And another 75 were charged with entering a restricted area with a deadly weapon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors in the office have been working with the FBI as well as prosecutors in various locations around the nation. The office said the individuals arrested come from nearly all 50 states.</p></div></div>
<a>Ashli Babbitt</a> of California, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to breach a set of doors deep in the Capitol during the riot. Federal prosecutors later cleared the officer of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death.

<div><div><p>According to a May estimate by the Architect of the Capitol, the attack caused about $1.5 million worth of damage to the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About 165 individuals, the office said, have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges, from misdemeanors to felony obstruction.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So far, 70 defendants have received some kind of sentence from a judge. Of those, 31 people were ordered jailed, and 18 were sentenced to home detention. The remaining 21 defendants were placed on probation.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Weiner</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>March 10, 2021 at 12:42 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Two months after the insurrection, many of the charges involving attacks against police officers have focused on the Capitol’s West Terrace, a ceremonial doorway that was being prepared for the presidential inauguration of Joe Biden.</p>
<p>More than a third of the 40 people charged with assaulting law enforcement officers were allegedly involved in clashes on the West Terrace of the Capitol, according to a review of charging documents and a Washington Post analysis of arrest data.</p>
<div><div><p>“This was one of the most dangerous areas,” U.S. Magistrate Judge Zia M. Faruqui said in ordering Klein held on Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C. police officers have said they were determined to hold the rioters back from that path to the Rotunda, not knowing that other entrances already had been breached.</p></div></div>
<p>“It was us 30 or 60 officers against, like, thousands and thousands of people that were trying to get in,” Cmdr. Ramey Kyle told The Post in January. “We were going to be the cork in this hole that kept them from entering.”</p>
<div><div><p>The officers repeatedly managed to push the rioters out of the tunnel only to be overrun again, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jocelyn Bond said in court Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They ended up spending about 2 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2 </sub>hours that day battling back the mob over and over,” Bond said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Klein, she said, breached the tunnel early and then called for fresh recruits. </p></div></div>
<div><p>Capitol riot defendants facing jail say they have regrets. Judges aren’t buying it.</p></div>
<div><p>Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes was in direct contact with rioters before and during Capitol breach, U.S. alleges</p></div>
<div><div><p>As the officers were being dragged down, prosecutors said, Luke Coffee, 41, an actor from Dallas, used a crutch to push into the line of police guarding the tunnel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During a detention hearing last week for Mullins, U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell called his behavior “terribly troubling and dangerous” and footage of the scene “frightening.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Mullins was released because Howell found that prosecutors had not properly argued that he committed a crime of violence, an issue the government has faced in several cases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors said that some in the crowd tried to protect the police from violence, and through attorneys, several defendants said that that was their intention.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sabol’s attorney called the video evidence “ambiguous” and said his client’s voice can be heard in the din, telling people not to attack the police.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Patrick McCaughey, 23, of Connecticut is accused of helping pin D.C. police officer Daniel Hodges in a door with a riot shield; attorney Lindy Urso said his client called for help and tried to put the officer’s gas mask back on.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Patrick categorically denies that he used or intended to use the plastic shield as a dangerous or deadly weapon, as charged,” Urso added in an email.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stanley Woodward, who represents Klein, notes that prosecutors describe his client as helping one of the officers who was dragged down the stairs, after blocking another officer from offering aid.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was chaos,” Woodward said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Faruqui gave a hint Tuesday of how judges might view those arguments.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said that although it is helpful to prosecutors that “everyone and their mother was tape recording this thing,” they “don’t just have the videotape in a vacuum.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Katie Mettler</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 30, 2020</div></div>
<div><div><p>Nadine Seiler stood before the memorial fence at Black Lives Matter Plaza feeling defeated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But this week, just days before the bitterly contested Nov. 3 presidential election, her museum was gone.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Seiler and the strangers around her tried to block the signs with their bodies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But by Tuesday night, the wall was nearly empty.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The religious activists promised they’d be back.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Take down</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>‘This is what he lived for’: John Lewis remembered at Black Lives Matter Plaza</p></div>
<div><div><p>They briefly argued with Seiler about the mission of Black Lives Matter. Then they left.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But just after Barrett was officially confirmed around 9 p.m., Whitt and the women returned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The trio, not wearing masks, said they were upset that the view of the White House was blocked by signs. They started snatching, they told The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Seiler started recording on her cellphone while others around her desperately tried to stop the destruction.</p></div></div>
<p>Valarie Walker and Laurie Arbeiter, friends from New York who traveled to D.C. to protest, used their hands and feet and a tambourine to protect the signs. Walker said she lost a lock of hair in the bedlam, and Arbeiter said she lost her phone.</p>
<div><div><p>A sign of Trayvon Martin’s face fell. A floral arrangement that said “VOTE” came down. Laminated pages of Black women who had died were thrown to the ground.</p></div></div>
<div><p>One large sign remained. Made of thick white material and spanning the entire height of the fence, it was decorated with bright colors and intricate flowers. “Black lives matter everywhere, every day, all the time,” it read.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The groups clashed again over the final sign, with Hernández and another man imploring D.C. police to stop the teardown.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The trio left at around 11 p.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Beatty said their efforts were a “nice little community cleanup.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Seiler and others started salvaging and picking through the trash for signs that were not destroyed to start rebuilding.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But before they could start to hang them again, Beatty and Chavannes returned. They grabbed the rescued signs and tossed them in the street, shredding them with their hands.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One man sprawled his body across the ground and tucked the signs beneath him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still unable to tear down the tall white sign, the women left, returning a final time — with scissors.</p></div></div>
<div><p>On Black Lives Matter Plaza, quieter crowds — and yoga — as D.C. starts to reclaim the street</p></div>
<div><div><p>Beatty and Chavannes sliced through the word “lives,” and the last large sign fell.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This was the scene Caterina Sesana walked into when she and a friend showed up to help.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Seiler did not want to leave the signs unattended, but did not have room in her car because it was filled with her curator supplies — tape, zip ties, posters, paint.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sesana opened her trunk to store the surviving signs for safekeeping.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They agreed to meet back at Black Lives Matter Plaza the next day and said goodbye around 3 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before Seiler went to sleep, she contacted several social justice organizations with a message: Please help.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Restoration and repair</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Seiler got to the fence first. Then two others. But for more than an hour, hardly anyone else came.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I felt very defeated,” Seiler said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then the people started trickling in — from Black Lives Matter DC and from They/Them Collective. Sesana, who kept the salvaged signs overnight, pulled up and popped her trunk. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Breonna Taylor’s face and George Floyd’s memory were back. Working as a team, they pieced the large white sign together so it once again read: “Black Lives Matter everywhere, every day, all the time.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About a dozen people lingered, ready to defend the wall if anyone returned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just before 11 p.m., Whitt did. This time, he was alone. For more than an hour, he paced along the fence, shouting back and forth with the docents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am a patriot of this country,” he said. “This is my capital. This is my White House.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Whitt left empty-handed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Seiler has spent every night since continuing to repair what was broken.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She has wrapped the new signs in clear tape to keep them dry and fortified the old ones with extra zip ties.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Seiler said she is prepared for the conflict that might play out at the fence on election night. And she is committed to maintaining this time capsule of 2020’s racial reckoning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We call tell the story on the fence,” she said. “I’m going to keep the story alive as long as the fence is up.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Correction: An earlier version of this story said President Trump swore in Amy Coney Barrett as a Supreme Court justice. It was Justice Clarence Thomas who swore her in.</p></div></div>

<h2>Key findings of The Post’s Jan. 6 investigation</h2>
<h6><b>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</b></h6>
<li>Alerts were raised by local officials, FBI informants, social media companies, former national security officials, researchers, lawmakers and tipsters.</li>
<li>One of the biggest efforts to come out of Sept. 11, 2001 — a national network of multi-agency intelligence centers — spotted a flood of Jan. 6 warnings, but federal agencies did not show much interest in its information.</li>
<li>The FBI limited its own understanding of how extremists were mobilizing when it switched over its social media monitoring service on the last weekend of 2020.</li>
<h6><b>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</b></h6>
<li>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was left rattled by Trump’s firing of senior Pentagon officials just after the election and sought to put guardrails on deployment of the National Guard.</li>
<h6><b>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</b></h6>
<li>The U.S. Capitol Police had been tracking threatening social media posts for weeks but was hampered by poor communication and planning.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</b></h6>
<h6><b>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</b></h6>
<li>Hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with police at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the morning of Jan. 6, some with shields and gas masks, presaging the violence to come.</li>
<li>D.C. homeland security employees spotted piles of backpacks left by rallygoers outside the area where the president would speak — a phenomenon the agency had warned a week earlier could be a sign of concealed weapons.</li>
<h6><b>Trump had direct warnings of the risks but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</b></h6>
<b> </b>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, other Republican lawmakers and numerous White House advisers to urge the mob to disperse, a delay that contributed to harrowing acts of violence.
<h6><b>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</b></h6>
<li>John C. Eastman, an attorney advising Trump, emailed Pence’s lawyer as a shaken Congress was reconvening to argue that the vice president should still reject electors from Arizona and other states.</li>
<li>Earlier in the day, while the vice president, his family and aides were hiding from the rioters, Eastman emailed Pence’s lawyer to blame the violence on Pence’s refusal to block certification of Biden’s victory.</li>
<h6><b>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to help take back control of the Capitol</b></h6>
<li>After the breach,<b> </b>the bureau deployed three tactical teams that were positioned nearby, but they were small, specialized teams and did not bring overwhelming manpower.</li>
<li>As the riot escalated, acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen scrambled to keep up with the deluge of calls from senior government officials and desperate lawmakers.</li>
<h6><b>Republican efforts to undermine the 2020 election restarted immediately after the Capitol attack</b></h6>
<b> </b>setting in motion a chaotic process that further sowed doubt in the results and a wave of similar partisan investigations in other states.
<h6><b>False election claims by Trump that spurred the Capitol attack have become a driving force in the Republican Party</b></h6>
<li>They include 10 candidates running for secretary of state, a position with sway over elections in many states.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s attacks have led to escalating threats of violence</b></h6>
<li>Election officials in at least 17 states have collectively received hundreds of threats to their personal safety or their lives since Jan. 6, with a concentration in the six states where Trump has focused his attacks on the election results.</li>
<li>Ominous emails and calls have spiked immediately after the former president and his allies raised new claims.</li>
<h6><b>First responders are struggling with deep trauma</b></h6>
<ul><li>Those who tried to protect the Capitol are contending with serious physical injuries, nightmares and intense anxiety. “Normal is gone,” said one Capitol Police commander.</li></ul>

<div><h1>House readies Friday vote on spending package after GOP’s McCarthy delays process late into the night</h1></div>
<h2>Democrats worked to secure a final vote on the bill, which would expand social programs and provide billions to fight climate change</h2>

<div><p>With infrastructure victory in hand, Democrats brace for battle over $2 trillion spending bill</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re going to recess, and we’ll come in at 8 a.m.” Friday, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) told reporters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He wants to do it in the middle of the night,” Hoyer said of McCarthy’s motivations for speaking for so late. “We’re going to do it in the light of day.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Back on the House floor, meanwhile, McCarthy sounded an even more emboldened note. “I don’t know if they think because they left I’m going to stop,” he said. “I’m not.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think we were all united around the desire to have complete information,” Murphy later told reporters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-N.J.), another party centrist, similarly expressed optimism about the package as he told reporters he continued to review the spending data.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The second biggest program in the Democrats' spending bill gives billions to the rich</p></div>
<div><div><p>Opening debate earlier Thursday in the House, top Democrats took to the floor to stress the popularity of the president’s vast spending agenda.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Rep. Jayapal has emerged as a forceful leader of the House liberals</p></div>
<div><div><p>Even as Democrats unified in support of the package, Republicans readied an onslaught of opposition — led by McCarthy, whose winding speech attacked Biden and slammed Democrats for border security.</p></div></div>
<p>“Why don’t we pass a bill to honor our Border Patrol agents?” McCarthy mused at one point as the speech approached the start of its third hour. “You know what you’re spending money on? Not to build the wall!”</p>
<div><div><p>The dispute drew in the White House on Thursday, when press secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged some of the concerns with the proposal to boost state and local tax breaks, a provision known as SALT.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is a component that wasn’t initially proposed” by the White House, she said. “This is a part of compromise.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amid the squabbling, Democratic leaders on Thursday also maintained that the bill is fully financed — a contention that some cost-conscious centrists continued to evaluate Thursday night.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Biden sees gains in supply chain battle, but the fight isn’t over</p></div>
<p>Biden and Democratic leaders have charged that Republicans are exaggerating the problems for political gain, arguing inflation is due, in part, to the economy recovering from the pandemic and that wages are on the rise as unemployment levels drop.</p>
<p>In a speech Wednesday, Biden said that supply chain issues contributing to delayed deliveries would remain a short-term problem, placing the blame on news reports for overhyping the lack of stocked up shelves in toy stores ahead of the holidays.</p>

<p>A brief argument between Vice President Cheney and a senior Democratic senator led Cheney to utter a big-time obscenity on the Senate floor this week.</p>
<p>"Fuck yourself," said the man who is a heartbeat from the presidency.</p>
<p>As it happens, the exchange occurred on the same day the Senate passed legislation described as the "Defense of Decency Act" by 99 to 1.</p>
<p>"That's beneath John Kerry," Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. said. "I'm very disappointed that he would use that kind of language. I'm hoping that he's apologizing at least to himself, because that's not the John Kerry that I know."</p>
<p>Then there was that famous Talk magazine interview of Bush by Tucker Carlson in 1999, in which the future president repeatedly used the F-word.</p>
<p>The Democratic National Committee has declared this to be "Halliburton Week" to portray administration ties to the controversial company. "Sounds like it's making somebody a little testy," Kerry spokesman Chad Clanton said.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Michael Scherer</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Mike DeBonis</div></span></div></span></div><div>November 14, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<p>The national environment could hardly look more favorable to Republicans one year before the midterm elections, with declining approval for President Biden, growing pessimism in the country and spiking prices for essentials like gasoline and milk.</p>
<div><div><p>But Republican struggles to settle on candidates have left some wondering whether the party will blow its big chance to retake the U.S. Senate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The great misperception in politics is that these things just work themselves out,” said one Republican strategist. “When you do that you end up with witches.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other Republicans have argued that the national environment is so bad for Democrats that the primary fights and personal baggage of Republicans will fade into the background by next November.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t think it is a question of, ‘Oh this person has a blemished record,’ ” Carney said. “There is a frustration and anger that is worse than the tea party in 2010.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans need only a one-seat net gain to win control of the chamber, which is currently split 50-50, with Vice President Harris delivering tiebreaking votes to Democrats.</p></div></div>

<a>Glenn Youngkin won narrowly</a> over former Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe. In New Jersey, where Biden won by 16 points, incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy

<div><div><p>Scott has said he will not involve himself in GOP primaries, despite his push to get Sununu to run. He maintained his confidence last week, even after Sununu bowed out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The grass roots energy is on our side. The map and the data are on our side. Most importantly, the American people are on our side,” Scott said in a widely circulated memo.</p></div></div>
<a>declined to indulge Trump’s election fantasies</a>. Similar GOP divisions over the 2020 result proved disastrous earlier this year, when Democrats won two Senate runoff elections in Georgia amid depressed Republican turnout.
<div><div><p>Democrats, meanwhile, need to deliver on their domestic policy promises — and fast — to draw an effective contrast with Republicans in the coming months.</p></div></div>

<div><p>The Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol was neither a spontaneous act nor an isolated event</p></div>
<a>said 140 police officers,</a> including Capitol officers and members of the D.C. police department, were victimized during the attack.
<div><div><p>The office said about 10 individuals were charged with assaulting members of the media or destroying their equipment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some 640 people were charged with entering a restricted federal building or its grounds. And another 75 were charged with entering a restricted area with a deadly weapon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors in the office have been working with the FBI as well as prosecutors in various locations around the nation. The office said the individuals arrested come from nearly all 50 states.</p></div></div>
<a>Ashli Babbitt</a> of California, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to breach a set of doors deep in the Capitol during the riot. Federal prosecutors later cleared the officer of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death.

<div><div><p>According to a May estimate by the Architect of the Capitol, the attack caused about $1.5 million worth of damage to the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About 165 individuals, the office said, have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges, from misdemeanors to felony obstruction.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So far, 70 defendants have received some kind of sentence from a judge. Of those, 31 people were ordered jailed, and 18 were sentenced to home detention. The remaining 21 defendants were placed on probation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In early December, <a>Robert Scott Palmer, 54, </a>of Largo, Fla., received the longest prison sentence to date among those convicted in the attack. A U.S. District Court judge sentenced him to more than five years in prison.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“He was enamored with [how] ‘all these people are coming to fight for me,’ ” said a senior Republican close to him. “I don’t think he appreciated what was going on.”</p><div>3</div></div></div>
<p>In a statement, Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich disputed The Post’s findings as “fake news” and falsely cast people who entered the Capitol that day as “agitators not associated with President Trump.”</p>
<li>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack, but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</li>
<li>Trump had direct warnings of the risks, but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</li>
<li>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</li>
<li>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to take back control of the Capitol</li>

<p>“Not very good, Mr. President,” Tuberville responded. “As a matter of fact, they’re about to evacuate us.”</p>
<p>“I know we’ve got problems,” Trump responded.</p>
<div><p>Amid the mayhem, Tuberville abruptly ended the call. “Mr. President, they just took our vice president out,” the senator said. “They’re getting ready to drag me out of here. I got to go.”</p><div>5</div></div>
<p>“You know what I see, Kevin? I see people who are more upset about the election than you are. They like Trump more than you do,” the president replied.</p>
<p>Trump responded, “Kevin, they’re not my people.”</p>
<div><div><p>McCarthy told the president, “Yes they are, they just came through my windows and my staff is running for cover. Yeah, they’re your people. Call them off.”</p><div>7</div></div></div>
<h3><div>Seven hours to go</div></h3>
<p>Cheney took to Twitter at 7:11 a.m. to denounce the effort by a growing number of her Republican colleagues to try to give Trump a second term by rejecting the electoral college results.</p>
<div><div><p>A few blocks away, at the Washington Monument, a mob of Trump supporters overran police at 9 a.m. One U.S. Park Police officer radioed:</p><div>11</div></div></div>
<p>Within minutes, the dispatches from officers on the scene worsened.</p>
<p>Then, at 9:46 a.m., an even more frightening report came in from the Lincoln Memorial. Park Police officers radioed in to say there were 500 to 800 people gathered, some with giant banner flags.</p>
<p>Just then, another officer at the Washington Monument radioed in:</p>
<p>Instructions came over the radio to all Park Police officers:</p>
<p>An officer explained the strategy of restraint: “We’re not going to agitate them.”</p>
<p>At the White House, Trump issued an unambiguous instruction at 8:17 a.m. to Pence, who was preparing to preside over the joint session of Congress at 1 p.m.</p>
<h3><div>Five hours to go</div></h3>
<p>Around the city, there was a carnival atmosphere at the various gatherings of protesters who believed they were not just witnessing history, but helping create it, with Biden’s victory about to be undone.</p>
<div><p>Guilfoyle argued to Trump that the swelling crowd outside represented a national consensus. “They’re just reflecting the will of the people,” she told him. “This is the will of the people.”</p><div>13</div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump was unforgiving. “You don’t have the courage to make a hard decision,” he told Pence.</p><div>14</div></div></div>
<p>As they arrived on the scene, murmurs of “the Proud Boys are here” went through the crowd, and people moved to make a clearing. “Praise God!” one woman said.</p>
<p>At 11:39 a.m., Trump departed the White House by motorcade for the quick drive to the Ellipse, where he gathered with aides, allies and family members beneath a white tent before taking the rally stage.</p>
<b> </b>At the same time, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported that the vehicle near L’Enfant Plaza contained two handguns as well as the rifle and scope.

<p>“Should it affect what you’re going to do?” her father asked.</p>
<p>After some discussion, they agreed she should press on.</p>
<div><div><p>“You can’t let that sort of threat stop you from doing what’s right,” he told his daughter.</p><div>17</div></div></div>
<p>At 12:36 p.m., Pence arrived at the Capitol. As the motorcade drew near, one of his staffers was struck by the scale of the crowd.</p>
<div><div><p>Pence’s team did not imagine the scene would turn violent; none of the relevant agencies had briefed the vice president or his team about what to expect.</p><div>18</div></div></div>
<p>As Pence entered the Capitol, his office released the letter to Congress. The finality of its conclusions sent shock waves through Trump’s orbit and beyond.</p>
<p>A city official pointed to CNN, which was displaying images of Pence and Congress meeting inside. “That’s not what’s on television,” the official said.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be,” Harvin fired back.</p>
<p>At 1:03 p.m., Capitol Police found an unoccupied red pickup truck with Alabama tags containing a trove of weapons, including an M4 carbine assault rifle, loaded magazines of ammunition, and components to make 11 molotov cocktails.</p>
<p>Back at the Ellipse, Trump was finishing his speech, and the leader’s edict rang through the city like a call to arms.</p>
<p>“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said. “We are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue — I love Pennsylvania Avenue — and we are going to the Capitol.”</p>
<p>And then, at 1:10 p.m., he told the crowd to march to “try and give [lawmakers] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”</p>
<h3><div>60 minutes to go</div></h3>
<p>“1776!” one man called out.</p>
<p>“1776!” fellow marchers responded.</p>
<p>“Whose Capitol? Our Capitol!” they chanted.</p>
<div><div><p>By 1 p.m., Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund realized things weren’t going well: “I’m watching my people getting slammed.”</p><div>20</div></div></div>
<p>“Break open the gate!” one man yelled, his voice bellowing over the crowd. “We're not going to be scared! We're not backing down! You mess with American people, this is what you get!”</p>
<p>This was a full-blown riot.</p>
<p>At 1:50 p.m., the D.C. police commander declared a riot at the Capitol.</p>
<p>“Get ’em!” people shouted, charging into battle. “Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump! Trump!”</p>
<h3><div>The Capitol is breached</div></h3>
<p>At a landing, Goodman turned around and made as if he was going to hit Jensen with the baton. “Back up!” Goodman shouted.</p>
<p>“Hit me, I’ll take it,” Jensen said. “I will take it for my country.”</p>
<p>Goodman turned again to run. “Second floor!” he shouted into his radio as he took the stairs two at a time, warning fellow officers that the crowd was on the move. Jensen ran after him, his arms pumping.</p>
<b> </b>office where Pence was hiding.
<p>Goodman looked to his left, toward that office. Then he pushed Jensen in the chest and started walking toward the right, where a line of police officers was waiting. Jensen followed, and so did the rioters behind him.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of stopping us at this point?” Jensen said to one officer, in an exchange captured on video obtained by The Post, as rioters’ yells echoed off the marble walls.</p>
<p>“That's as far as it's going to go,” the officer declared.</p>
<p>“Then go arrest the vice president!” Jensen said.</p>
<p>At 2:19 p.m., Capitol Police emailed an urgent bulletin to all congressional staff:</p>
<p>On the House side, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had been presiding when her security detail pulled her from the rostrum, and the House suddenly adjourned at 2:20 p.m.</p>
<p>At the White House, Trump was watching the spectacle play out on television. He was pleased by thousands of his supporters storming the Capitol. Trump tweeted at 2:24 p.m.:</p>
<p>“I’m not leaving the Capitol,” Pence had told Giebels. He feared the image of his departing motorcade might provide vindication to the insurrectionists.</p>
<p>The vice president and his family and aides were led on a safe path down a staircase to a secured subterranean area that rioters couldn’t reach. Pence’s armored limousine was parked there, and Giebels asked him to get inside.</p>
<div><p>“I’m not getting in the car, Tim,” Pence said. “I trust you, Tim, but you’re not driving the car. If I get in that vehicle, you guys are taking off. I’m not getting in the car.”</p><div>26</div></div>
<p>The vice president and his entourage found safety in a secured underground area of the Capitol, where they would wait out the rioters.</p>
<div><div><p>Eastman said his message was a response to an email in which Jacob told him that his “bull----” legal advice was why Pence’s team was “under siege.”</p><div>27</div></div></div>
<h3><div>30 minutes in</div></h3>
<p>“It seemed like they knew less about what was happening than we did,” Jayapal said. “Everyone felt unprotected, but we were stuck there.”</p>
<p>At 2:44 p.m., a shot echoed in the halls. A Capitol Police officer killed Ashli Babbitt as she attempted to force entry into the Speaker’s Lobby adjacent to the House chamber.</p>
<p>Inside the chamber, lawmakers assumed the worst and realized they could soon be overrun by violent intruders. Jayapal thought the rioters were shooting into the chamber.</p>
<p>Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) comforted her friend Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) in prayer.</p>
<p>Rep. Terri A. Sewell (D-Ala.) called her mother.</p>
<p>Rep. Daniel Kildee (D-Mich.), who has since disclosed lasting mental trauma sparked by his experience, called his family and began to say goodbye after understanding the gravity of the situation; there was a chance he would not make it out alive.</p>
<p>Soon Wild was lying on the ground. Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.) held her hand.</p>
<p>Members discussed how they would position themselves if the mob were to burst through the doors. Crow suggested that members take their pins off so that the rioters could not identify them as the elected officials they wanted to kill.</p>
<p>Just removing a pin was not a solution for every lawmaker, however. While all were under threat, the danger was particularly acute for lawmakers of color, whose identity made them a visible target for the overwhelmingly White throng.</p>
<p>As rioters pushed their way into the Speaker’s Lobby, their hatred and zeal was evident. When Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn ordered them to leave the Capitol, some yelled back:</p>
<p>“President Trump invited us here!”</p>
<p>“Nobody voted for Joe Biden!”</p>
<p>In a rare instance of injecting politics into his job, Dunn replied: “I voted for Joe Biden. Does my vote not count? Am I nobody?”</p>
<p>Rioters then hurled racial epithets at Dunn, who is Black.</p>
