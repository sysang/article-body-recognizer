<h1> Robert Kimball memoir recalls bygone era of (gasp!) bipartisanship</h1>
<div> January 8, 2022 8:02am <div> Updated <div> January 8, 2022 9:39am </div> </div> </div>
<p>In the spring of 2015, my friend and former Post colleague Robert Kimball made what I thought was a zany prediction: that Donald Trump, who had just announced his candidacy, would become the nation’s next president. </p>
<p>I was vaguely aware that Bob once had been a lawyer for Republican legislators who helped to craft the 1964 Civil Rights Act. But I never guessed at his political acumen. </p>
<p>At age 24, fresh out of Yale law school, Kimball witnessed and participated in the congressional scrimmage during the tumultuous months when black southern churches were burned and Southern governors turned police dogs onto demonstrators. </p>
<p>Until I read his memoir “Crisis and Compromise: The Rescue of the 1964 Civil Rights Act” (RiverGrove Books), out now, I had no idea that Republicans in the House of Representatives played a critical role in writing the law. </p>
<p>As a legislative aide to Rep. John V. Lindsay (later mayor of New York City), my longtime friend was in the thick of the action — which the book brings vividly to life. </p>
<p>It followed Machiavellian machinations by warring House factions, President John F. Kennedy and his attorney general brother Robert F. Kennedy, and duplicitous newspaper columnists. </p>
<p>(Lifelong Republican Kimball switched his party registration to Democratic when Trump was nominated in 2016, one year after he told me that Trump would win the presidency.)</p>

<h1> This is how Mayor Adams can put the swagger back in New York City</h1>

<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 8, 2022 8:06am <div> Updated <div> January 8, 2022 8:07am </div> </div> </div>
<p>“When a mayor has swagger, the city has swagger.”</p>
<p>So declared Mayor Eric Adams on Jan. 3, signifying that he would be an energetic, larger-than-life, Big Apple-boosting leader in contrast to his lazy, New York-defiling predecessor.</p>
<p>His public rounds and smiling photos with bankers and real estate executives are a fine opening move.</p>
<p>There’s a parallel of sorts in today’s mostly still-empty office buildings. Adams has scolded Wall Street bank heads to bring their people back — “You can’t run New York City from home,” <a>he said</a>.</p>
<p>Turn the clips into commercials. Suburbanites fearful of returning to Manhattan might be swayed by Adams’ persuasive voice and smile to remind them of what they’re missing.</p>
<p>Crime? Adams can’t immediately undo bail rules. But the NYPD answers only to him. As every New Yorker out for a stroll or a subway ride can see, too many demoralized cops are slacking at their jobs except in cases of life-or-death. </p>
<p>It might not be pretty. But the police will know he means business. So will muggers and looters accustomed to cops standing by during their sprees.</p>
<p>For all his later failings, when Rudy Giuliani was mayor, he halted the crime explosion and restored confidence in the city, not with sweet talk, but by scaring the hell out of the people who worked for him.</p>
<p>Adams needs to exercise the same bully-pulpit mentality, pushing for improvements one street at a time, every day of the year. That’s how the city gets its swagger back.</p>
<h1> Three Times Square inks ginormous deal with university</h1>
<div> January 2, 2022 6:54pm <div> Updated <div> January 2, 2022 6:54pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Epitomizing the Times Square office market’s unpredictable evolution, the bowtie’s next user wave won’t be of bankers, lawyers or media wizards – but college students.</p>
<p>Touro College and University System has signed a long-term lease for 243,305 square feet at the Rudin Family’s Three Times Square. Touro will move seven of its schools into floors three through nine and parts of the ground and second floors.</p>
<p>All the floors will be connected by attractive new internal staircases.</p>
<p>“Fire stairs won’t do it,” said Touro Senior VP of Operations Jeffrey Rosengarten of the need to create a community feel.</p>
<sup>th</sup> and 125th streets.
<p>Touro leases or owns about one million square feet in Manhattan and the outer boroughs. Its total enrollment of 19,000 is spread over 35 locations in the US, Berlin, Jerusalem and Moscow.</p>
<p>Rudin Management Company CEO William Rudin said that a university inside an ultra-modern Times Square tower that opened in 2001 might seem “definitely out of the box, but in this world we live in, we’re all calling audibles.”</p>
<p>He noted that Touro students “have been riding subways for their whole lives, and it’s a very easy way to get to school.”</p>
<p>Even so, “I wasn’t sure at first they would want to bring a university in,” Rosengarten said.</p>
<p>Rudin recalled, “They started looking [seriously] at Times Square in late 2020, at the height of the pandemic. They continued their conversations with us through 2021 and we consummated the deal at the end of the year.”</p>
<p>Neither Rudin nor Rosengarten would discuss lease terms. Rudin said last April that asking rents were in the low-$70s per square foot on lower floors and in the mid-$80s higher up.</p>
<p>Asked whether the deal was market-rate, Rosengarten said, “I don’t want to call it a buyers’ market but it certainly helped us put together a financial deal that we felt was affordable and the Rudins thought was fair.”</p>
<p>Touro was repped by Rosengarten and a Cushman Wakefield team led by Richard Bernstein. Rudin was repped by Tom Keating in-house and a Cushman team led by John Cefaly.</p>
<a>cartoon characters on the street</a>, “We can negotiate for our students to take pictures with them,” he laughed.
<h1> Schrödinger’s Times Square lease a good sign for Midtown office market</h1>
<div> April 25, 2021 6:54pm <div> Updated <div> April 26, 2021 11:41am </div> </div> </div>
<p>The tower will soon have available floors 27-35, previously occupied by Viacom, with asking rent of $85 per square foot across the block.</p>
<p>Even with the rent-abatement period, Schrödinger’s lease and expansion are unalloyed good news for the market — as was Beam Suntory’s just-under 100,000 square-foot lease at 11 Madison Ave. earlier this year.</p>
<p>That transaction went largely unacknowledged after we first reported it in February. We’ll see if the doom-mongers will remain silent as well over Schrödinger’s impressive Times Square commitment.</p>
<p>Dynamic Star will still be in control of most of the rest of Fordham Landing. But the offering came as something of a surprise, as Dynamic’s plans for the larger site have been widely reported for two years.</p>
<p>“After the sale, we’ll still have about 14 acres,” Dynamic Star development director Brad Zackson said. The city owns certain parts of the site as well.</p>
<p>Dynamic Star, which also has several projects in Long Island City, bought a 2-acre concrete plant site at Fordham Landing in December. It also owns an 11-acre CSX rail site to the north.</p>
<p>The industrial sites need rezoning to be fully developed, which means a slog through the city’s Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.</p>

<p>Myers said it was too early to tell what effect the new Omicron variant would have on office leasing, but said he was “hopeful” it “will be even smaller than the minimal effect from the Delta variant.”</p>
<p>“We see strong demand and leasing activity across our portfolio, including at Dock 72 [at the Brooklyn Navy Yard]. I think this report will validate what we’ve been seeing.”</p>
<p>Prospective tenants have been enthusiastically touring 80 Pine St. and <a>Three Times Square</a>, two Rudin properties that are vacant, and deals are likely to be inked soon, Rudin said.</p>
<p>CBRE previously reported that third-quarter leasing was the strongest since the pandemic’s onset. The 3Q total of 5.88 million square feet jumped 70 percent over 2Q, chipping into still-high availability.</p>
<p>Helping to offset contractions by companies such as <a>Advance, which owns Condé Nast</a>, were expansions by Facebook and Blackstone.</p>
<p>“Not exactly a market on its last legs, is it?” mused one famously press-shy landlord.</p>
<p>Average asking rents trickled downward to $76.89 percent, off 4.4 percent since the end of 2019, CBRE said. But, “The market is so nuanced that average asking rents don’t really tell the story,” Myers said.</p>
<p>Myers was confident that the trend would hold up even as companies and employees continue to delay their office returns.</p>
<p>“I’m Zoom-fatigued myself,” he said. “More companies will come to realize that they need their senior and mid-level staff in the office.”</p>
<p>The CBRE report also noted that even if workers spend 25 percent less time in offices than they did before the pandemic, “This still means that most office workers will be in the office most of the time.”</p>
<p>Major JLL dealmaker Mitchell Konsker, who like Rudin hadn’t yet read the CBRE report, noted that the “full brunt” of WFH isn’t known yet — but both landlords and tenants are adapting to the uncertainty.</p>
<p>Konsker said, “The true sizing of corporate America can’t yet be fully evaluated” while large numbers of people continue to work from home.</p>
<p>But he said landlords have played a helpful role in “providing tenants with flexibility [in new leases] for expansion or contraction” depending on where the dust settles in the next few years.</p>
<p>“The short-term expansion and contraction options creates flexibility to accommodate whatever the situation is when everyone gets back.”</p>
<h1> Remote job postings for NYC firms nearly quadruple in seismic shift</h1>
<div> January 16, 2022 6:34pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 6:34pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>New York City firms offered nearly quadruple the number of remote jobs to new applicants in the past year, according to data obtained by The Post.</p>
<p>“And this is just the beginning,” said NYC Partnership CEO Kathryn Wylde, whose business group analyzed figures compiled by the numbers firm Emsi Burning Glass.</p>
<p>The key industries with the highest jump in virtual-work offers amid the coronavirus pandemic included administrative, information and financial services.</p>
<p>In early 2020, there were 6,700 out of 163,000 postings for city jobs that could be filled by remote workers, or 4 percent of the total.</p>
<p>By this past December, there were 25,800 out of 243,000 jobs postings for the same work, or 10.6 percent.</p>
<p>Wylde noted that the virtual jobs “allow the employee to work from anywhere in the world” — leading to a seismic impact on the city’s business district and culture and society as a whole.</p>
<p>Fewer in-person workers in the Manhattan Downtown and Midtown business districts mean less foot traffic for eateries and pubs in the area, potentially leading to other job losses and firm closures.</p>
<p>Fewer people would take transit to Manhattan, too, and remote workers living elsewhere could cost the city and state treasuries hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues, a city audit has estimated. </p>
<p>The shift in the current workforce has already been severe because of the lingering pandemic. </p>
<p>A<a> poll conducted</a> by the partnership in November found just 28 percent of Manhattan workers were back at their desks on an average workday and that a majority were still working remotely 18 months into the pandemic.</p>
<p>And employees are not in a hurry to return to their cubicles.</p>
<a>survey by Morning Consult found that 55 percent</a> of respondents tele-working from home said they would considering
<a>quitting their jobs </a>if they were forced to return to their office desks before they felt it was safe.
<p>On the bright side, one study found COVID-induced at-home set-ups <a>saved New Yorkers </a> thousands of dollars by eliminating commuting and other daily expenses.</p>
<p>“This is a big cultural shift, and I don’t see it reversing,’’ Wylde said of the work-from-home phenomenon.</p>
<p>“It will require repurposing retail and <a>older office space </a>for housing and other purposes. It also will require rethinking transit and city services, since long-standing commuter patterns will change.”</p>
<p>National studies mirror the Big Apple trend, with large tech firms leading the charge in hiring stay-at-home workers.</p>
<p>Surveys and studies by job-tracking firms predict 36 million to 41 million Americans will be working remotely by 2025, more than double the 16.8 million at-home workers employed before COVID-19 hit.</p>
<p>One of six people working remotely are managers.</p>
<p>“COVID forced the world to become more remote-friendly. Turns out — hiring was no exception,” says an Epsi analysis of the workforce from April 2018 to January 2021.</p>
<p>A <a>report from Indeed Hiring Lab called</a> the popularity of remote work “one of the most dramatic effects of the pandemic — and might be one of its most long-lasting.”</p>
<p>Job postings on Indeed are now more than twice as likely to mention remote work as before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“While remote work remains unfeasible in many areas, like food service and beauty wellness, it has increased dramatically in sectors where it had been rare, like therapy, finance, and law,” the job-posting site said.</p>
<p>Indeed said remote-job postings have surged for positions in IT/Help, software development, banking and finance, arts and entertainment and education and instruction.</p>
<p>Goodhire, which conducts background checks for firms, said lockdowns during the pandemic that forced people to work from home have <a>substantially shifted</a> Americans’ view of remote employment as an option.</p>
<p>“Remote work is definitely preferred — and it’s not even close,” found a Goodhire survey of 3,500 American workers last year.</p>
<p>According to the survey, an astounding 85 percent of Americans said they prefer to apply for jobs that definitively offer remote working or hybrid options, versus jobs that require full-time, in-office work.</p>
<p>Six in 10 respondents said they would take a pay cut to work remotely full-time or move to a new city to work remotely in any capacity.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of respondents said companies that did not offer remote-working arrangements will lose major talent and struggle to attract new hires.</p>
<p>More troubling for those resisting change, nearly 30 percent respondents said they would “absolutely” not consider applying for a job that requires them to be in-office five days per week.</p>
<p>“We now know that by not offering remote working opportunities, companies are clearly eliminating nearly one-third of the available applicant pool. Astonishing, yes,” the report said.</p>
<p>But there is a silver lining for the Big Apple.</p>
<p>When asked where they would prefer to move, individuals cited New York City as one of the destinations for remote-job options, along with Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>“One thing is clear: if workers are willing to take pay cuts or even quit their jobs to maintain a remote lifestyle, employers will absolutely have to adjust quickly,” Goodhire said.</p>

<h1> Don’t believe the hype: Grace Kelly never lived in this NYC townhouse</h1>

<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> August 3, 2021 9:14am <div> Updated <div> August 4, 2021 6:26pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>There’s one born every minute. </p>
<p>That’s a lot of house and a lot of history for a starting bid of just $15 million.</p>
<a>broker braggadocio</a> touting the home as “Grace Kelly’s townhouse” in order to drum up the price — there is no evidence that the princess of Monaco, or any of her famous friends ever owned or even lived at 51-53 E. 73rd St.
<p>That means some yet-to-be-identified buyer is about to have their “George Washington slept here” moment.</p>
<a>then-broker Sergei Millian</a> told the Daily News about the home’s celebrity pedigree. Millian, a former president of the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, is better known as “Person 1,” the alleged source for
<a> the anti-Trump Steele dossier</a>, which heaped a hot load of scandal onto the 2016 presidential election.
<p>While it is not uncommon for brokers to fabricate a home’s provenance, reached via social media, Millian told The Post that he did not invent the Kelly story but simply repeated claims made by the owner, late real estate manager Paul Ender.</p>
<p>At the time, Ender was deep in debt and seeking some $48 million for the deteriorating townhouse (today it contains 13 unoccupied units and 5 offices).</p>
<p>Since purchasing the townhouse in 1973, Ender had treated the building like a piggybank, and by the end of 2016, the mortgage stood at $15.25 million, according to public records.</p>
<a>Monique Ender Silberman</a> defaulted on its mortgage, and quickly racked up liens, fines of $10,100 per day and expenses of around $28 million. A bankruptcy filing had stalled the sale for the last year.
<p>“We were taken advantage because we are women, period,” Ender Silberman told The Post.</p>
<p>All the while, the mansion’s dubious celebrity lore went unchecked, and was at times actively promoted.</p>
<p>The real history of the home tells another story.</p>
<a>the Barbizon Hotel for Women</a> for the next three years.
<a> Landmarks Preservation Commission</a>. While performing on stage and screen, Kelly was notice by legendary director John Ford, whose studio gave her a seven-year contract in 1952, which
<a>allowed her to keep her Manhattan address.</a> Now, a movie star (she appeared in her first Hitchcock picture “Dial M for Murder” in 1954), her next stop in the neighborhood was to an even more
<a>fashionable address at 988 Fifth Ave.</a> In 1955, she traveled to Monaco and married the prince the following year — after which it’s hard to imagine that the royal couple slummed it in a one-bedroom apartment.
<p>Rumors of other celeb occupants of 51-53 E. 73rd St. also add up to nuts.</p>
<p>Belafonte complained bitterly that no landlord on the Upper East Side would rent to him in the 1950s and he subsequently tricked the owners of 300 West End Ave. into selling him a home by using a company name.</p>
<p>Likewise, Soros is more apt to stash lovers in modest Upper East Side apartments than to live in them. In 2014, his ex claimed that he’d <a>promised to buy her a $1.9 million Upper East Side home </a>but that he gave it to his wife instead. </p>
<p>Asked if any of these boldfaced names might have rented love nests in the building, Ender Silberman shrugged: “Do you think whores sign leases? I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>The Princess Grace Foundation, the Rockefeller archivist and the Soros foundation did not return requests for comment.</p>
<p>“As a mansion it really stands out, and it’s on the Gold Coast of Manhattan,” said one broker familiar with the property who asked to remain anonymous. “It is amazing how many people have that kind of money.”</p>

<h1> Prince Rainer eyed Marilyn Monroe to be wife before Grace Kelly, doc claims</h1>
<div> October 20, 2021 7:02pm <div> Updated <div> October 20, 2021 7:03pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The monarchy of the tiny principality of Monaco would have looked very different if Marilyn Monroe was on the throne.</p>
<p>The new Curiosity Stream docuseries “Royals: Keeping the Crown,” dives into how the Hollywood starlet was reportedly eyed by Prince Rainer to be his wife and princess before Grace Kelly took her place.</p>
<p>University of St. Andrews historian Chandrika Kaul explained that the prince was 32-years-old and “the idea that he might lose his principality if he doesn’t marry well and produce a male heir is uppermost in his mind.”</p>
<p>“The stakes couldn’t be higher — Monaco is under threat. It could collapse, and Rainier has to save it,” royal historian Kate Williams added.</p>
<p>Instead, the crown’s advisers came up with an almost devilish plan to seal Monaco’s fate: Rainer should consolidate his House of Grimaldi nobility with America’s “new royalty” by courting a Hollywood celebrity.</p>
<p>The “Rear Window” actress attended the 1955 Cannes Film Festival on the French Riviera and she was later invited to visit Monaco for a <a>photoshoot for “Paris Match” magazine</a> at the royal palace.</p>
<p>“During this photoshoot, you really see how Rainier is entranced by Grace, and really, I think, he falls in love with her on a personal level — but he also sees her as the answer to so many of his problems,” Williams added.</p>
<p>Kelly got her fairytale ending and the pair married in April 1956 and had three children — Princess Caroline, Prince Albert and Princess Stephanie.</p>
<p>But <a>becoming royalty has a price</a>. Kelly decided to give up her career when she was just 26 to marry Rainier and she even paid a $2 million dowry to become a princess.</p>

<h1> Princess Charlene and Princess Grace’s shared tragic Monaco ‘misery’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 4, 2021 1:59pm <div> Updated <div> December 4, 2021 3:40pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Real-life princesses don’t always get a fairy-tale ending. But in Monaco, tragedy has a tendency to repeat itself.</p>
<p>A Monaco resident who has known the reigning Grimaldi family for almost 30 years said Charlene has never seemed to fit in with Prince Albert and his siblings.</p>
<p>But multiple Monaco sources told The Post that Charlene’s issues are more complicated than anything that’s been reported in the media so far.</p>
<p>“The gossip in Monte Carlo is gossip on a whole other level,” said one expat who has lived on the Riviera for decades. “Only the strong survive.”</p>
<p>Charlene returned to Monaco with her Rhodesian Ridgeback, Khan, posed with Albert and her children outside the palace and posted the photo of the family saying, “Thank you all for keeping me strong!”</p>
<p>But she abruptly left again on Nov. 15 and reportedly checked into a luxe, $400,000-per-month rehab center for treatment of physical and emotional “exhaustion” that Albert said could take weeks. </p>
<a>Voici published a story </a>quoting a palace source who claimed that Charlene had starting taking painkillers about nine years ago for an old injury and it became an addiction, fed by her increasing unhappiness with the Grimaldi family.
<p>“She could no longer bear the bullying of certain members of the family who have made her suffer in silence for 10 years,” the source told Voici.</p>
<p>Prince Albert’s lawyer, Thierry Lacoste, did not respond to e-mails from The Post about the allegations. A woman in the palace press office who did not give her name said the allegations were untrue.</p>
<a>“almost died” </a>in South Africa after undergoing multiple sinus surgeries over a period of six months. They added that she had not been been able to eat solid food and had lost a serious amount of weight.
<p>“It is unfair that she is being portrayed as having some kind of mental or emotional issue,” a source told Page Six. “We don’t know why the palace is downplaying that she almost died in South Africa.” </p>
<a>Villa iZulu </a>at Thanda Safari, deep in KwaZulu-Natal north of Durban. The high-end resort offers a private helicopter pad and views of game animals around a watering hole.
<a>Institut de Français</a> language school on the Riviera.
<p>Princess Grace’s influence is still widely felt all over Monaco. Boulevards, buildings, libraries and balls are named after her. Her legacy remains that of an actress who brought elegance and beauty to a longtime gambling and tax haven.</p>
<p>But her personal problems were glossed over and all but unknown to the public.</p>
<a>Nadia Lacoste, her shrewd Parisian-born confidante and spokeswoman, </a>who died in February 2021 at age 99.
<a>had fled to Nice International Airport to avoid getting married. </a>
<p>Sources told The Post that Princess Grace struggled with life in Monaco, just like Charlene.</p>
<p>“She was very unhappy,” Stratte-McClure said of Grace. “I remember seeing her in the mid-70s with [Prince] Rainier at Georges V looking bloated and drunk.”</p>
<p>Frédéric Mitterrand, France’s onetime minister of culture and the nephew of former French President François Mitterrand, told this reporter in 2007 that Grace was a lovely person who also seemed very sad.</p>
<p>“She had a real streak of melancholy,” said Mitterrand, who knew Grace well and wrote a book about her</p>
<a>TV documentary </a>on her that aired in March cited early interviews in which she was asked prior to her wedding if she would continue acting after her marriage. “That decision will be made by the prince.,” she said.
<a>the Times of London reported. </a>
<p>Grace also struggled with weight gain, reportedly visiting clinics in her late 40s after her once slim figure had became matronly. </p>
<a>in one of the last photos she posted</a> from South Africa that many commenters expressed concern.
<p>After what he saw his mother go through, Albert apparently understood that his future wife might face tribulations.</p>
<a>debunked longstanding rumors </a>that daughter Princess Stephanie, 16 at the time and also in the car, was at the wheel.)
<p>While Grace was the daughter of a rich Philadelphia businessman, Princess Charlene comes from more humble roots.</p>
<a>helps run Charlene’s influential foundation</a>. Her sister-in-law
<a>Chantelle</a>, wife of her brother Sean, is on the board of directors of the foundation. Mike is often seen at palace events with the prince.
<p>“The Wittstocks like life in Monaco,” said someone who knows them. “They don’t want to give it up, which makes people wonder if they’re looking out for Charlene’s best interests.”</p>
<p>Like Grace before her — who stayed close to Hollywood friends like David Niven, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck and Frank Sinatra — Charlene has maintained a support system in her home country.</p>
<a>Bridgette Motsepe Radebe</a>, the country’s first female black billionaire
<p>The princess is also very close to the Zulu royal family — more so, it appears, than to the Grimaldis. King Goodwill Zwelithini said he considered Charlene a “daughter.” </p>
<p>Charlene reportedly mediated in the messy succession conflicts after the death of Goodwill last spring despite her ill health.</p>
<p>The new Zulu king, Misuzulu kaZwelithini, one of Goodwill’s 28 children from six wives, escorted Charlene to Durban’s King Shaka International Airport on Nov. 8 when she returned to Monaco on Prince Albert’s Falcon 7X private jet.</p>
<p>In a new Tatler article about Charlene, unnamed friends from her swimming days remembered her as ambitious and laser-focused and no one’s fool — not unlike her late mother-in-law.</p>

<p>It’s time to row yourself to better health.</p>
<p>As an engaging and cardio-and-strength-combining piece of equipment, rowing machines are immaculate for total-body fitness.</p>
<a>home gym</a> — much like
<h2>What are the benefits of using a rowing machine?</h2>
<a>Annie Mulgrew</a>, VP founding instructor of
<a>CityRow</a>, told the Post. “Using a rowing machine allows you to get a total body, high-intensity workout (major calorie burn!) that is also low impact, reducing the risk of injury.”
<p>What’s more, rowing eliminates the force that other cardio exercises put on joints, making it one of, if not the best piece of cardio equipment, according to Mulgrew.</p>
<h2>What muscles does a rowing machine work?</h2>
<h2>How to use a rowing machine correctly</h2>
<a>UCanRow2</a> Instructor Nancy Saylor, who has 19 years of professional rowing experience, told the Post.
<p>Below, she highlights exactly an easy-to-follow guide on how to use a rowing machine:</p>
<li>Catch: This is where the seat is all the way forward with the knees bent, arms straight. If you were in a scull, your blades would be “catching” (dropped into) the water to take a stroke.</li>
<li>Drive: This is the only phase of the stroke where energy is expended. From the catch position, the legs are engaged by pushing through the heels as the legs straighten and the arms bend.</li>
<li>Recovery: This is the phase where you let the drive phase do it’s work; it’s a rest period. Your body gets set with straight arms and the knees start to bend as the seat moves toward the flywheel in preparation for the next stroke.</li>
<p>Ahead, find the top rowing machines our experts recommend, paired with top-rated rowing machines that fit the bill. And, be sure to check out <a>our expanded, expert-backed FAQ</a> at the end of this guide for more advice and information on rowing.</p>
<h2>1. <a>Concept2 Model D Indoor Rowing Machine</a>, $1,046.99</h2>
<p>“If you want to be competitive, Concept2’s monitor can’t be beat for recording and tracking your times and is the industry standard,” Saylor said. </p>
<p>This highly acclaimed rower boasts incredible performance tracking with its monitor, has adjustable footrests and an ergonomic handle for an easy-to-use equipment that’s just over $1,000.</p>

<h2>2. <a>WaterRower Performance Ergometer with SmartRow</a>, $1,695</h2>
<p>“The WaterRower is a beautiful piece of equipment because it’s made of wood, and stands upright when not in use,” Saylor said. </p>
<p>Be sure to keep in mind that the monitor is a bit slower to respond than the Concept2, though the water tank will add more resistance to your workout.</p>

<h2>All your rowing questions, explained by professional rowers</h2>
<h3>Is rowing considered a strength workout?</h3>
<h3>What’s the best way to row while preventing injury?</h3>
<p>According to Saylor, “good form and technique” coupled with “knowing your limitations” is important for preventing injury.</p>
<h3>What are the best rowing exercises for beginners?</h3>
<h3>What are the best rowing exercises for advanced-level athletes?</h3>
<h3>What should I look for in a rowing machine?</h3>
<p>“If your goal is to be competitive, the monitor is key,” Saylor advises. </p>
<h3>How often should I row? Should I row every day?</h3>
<p>Plus, consistently committing to two times a week for months at a time is better than burning out after doing seven times a week for only a few weeks, Mulgrew explained. </p>
<h3>Can I lose weight by rowing?</h3>

<p>After two years and counting of fending for ourselves in the kitchen during the pandemic, it’s about time to start thinking outside of the box — and into the meal kit box.</p>
