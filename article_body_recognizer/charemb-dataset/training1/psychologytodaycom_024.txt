<p>Do you know any children like this?</p>
<li>They “act really shy around other kids. They seem to be nervous or afraid to be around other kids and they don’t talk much. They often play alone at recess.”</li>
<li>They “watch what other kids are doing but don’t join in. At recess, they watch other kids playing but then play by themselves.”</li>
<li>They “are very quiet. They don’t have much to say to other kids.”</li>
<a>anxious</a>, solitary children.” These children want to interact with their peers, but their
<a>shyness</a> holds them back.
<p>When they’re around other kids, shy children feel like outsiders looking in. Even among familiar faces, they often end up playing alone or just silently watching others having fun, without joining in. </p>

<h1> Shyness: The New Solution </h1>
<h2> The results of a recent survey are shaking up our ideas about shyness and pointing to a surprising new approach for dealing with it. </h2>
<p> By Bernardo Carducci published January 1, 2000 - last reviewed on May 6, 2020 </p>
<a>divorced</a>, even though she was
<a>cheating on</a> me, because I would be back out there trying to socialize. [But] I have a computer job now, and one of my strengths is that I work well alone."
<a>self-esteem</a> and anticipation of rejection. The survey responses have shown, however, that shyness is also promoted by outside forces at work in our culture, and perhaps around the globe.
<a>social life</a>. I have a strong hate for most people. I also have quite a superiority complex. I see so much stupidity and ignorance in the world that I feel superior to virtually everyone out there. I'm trying [not to], but it's hard."
<a>empathy</a>, and this leads them to dehumanize others and take
<a>revenge</a> against them. This process is the same one used by the military to train young boys to kill. The difference is, the military is now in your house, on your TV, in your video games.
<p>"As we talked, I felt uneasy. I worried about how I looked, what I said, how I said what I said, and so forth. Her compliments made me uncomfortable."</p>
<a>stressful</a> situations, including even everyday conversations and social gatherings.
<p>They also need more time to master the developmental hurdles of life. The good news is that shy people eventually achieve everything that everyone else does -- they date, marry, have children. The bad news is, it takes them a little longer.</p>
<a>intimacy</a>. If you get into an intimate relationship, shyness no longer seems to be a problem. Unfortunately, it's hard to get there.
<p>The New Cultural Climate</p>
<a>identity</a> intensity. Our society is not only getting faster, it is getting louder and brighter. It takes an increasingly powerful
<a>antidepressant</a> Paxil as a treatment for social
<a>phobia</a>. Paxil is touted as a cure for being "allergic to people." One of the effects of hyperculture is to make people impatient for anything but a pill that instantly reduces their anxiety level.
<p>"I have tried to overcome my shyness by being around people as much as possible and getting involved in the conversation; however, after a few seconds, I become quiet. I have a problem keeping conversation flowing."</p>
<a>perfectionism</a>. The shy believe that anything they say has to come out perfect, sterling, supremely witty, as if everyday life is some kind of sitcom. They believe that everybody is watching and judging them -- a special kind of
<p>Fifteen percent of the shy turn to <a>self-help</a> books and seminars, which is great. But not enough people do it.</p>
<a>adolescence</a>, ingest drugs or
<p>Liquid extroversion poses the great danger of overconsumption of alcohol. Indeed, we have found in separate studies that a significant proportion of problem drinkers in the general population are shy.</p>
<p>But shy alcoholics tell us they do not like having to drink to perform better; they feel uneasy and lack confidence in their true selves. They begin to believe that people will like them only if they are outgoing, not the way they really are.</p>
<a>leader</a> speak for the first 45 minutes while people get comfortable, followed by a break in which the leader is available to answer questions. That then paves the way for a general question-and-answer period.
<p>"I can be anyone I want to be on the Internet and yet mostly be myself, because I know I will never meet these people I'm talking with and can close out if I get uncomfortable."</p>
<p>"I think the Internet hinders people in overcoming their shyness. You can talk to someone but you don't have to actually interact with them. You can sit in your room and not REALLY socialize. "</p>
<a>deceive</a> others, violating the trust that is the foundation of social life.
<p>Like most cultural influences, the Internet is neither devil nor angel. It's a social tool that works in different ways, depending on how it's used.</p>
<p>The successfully shy don't change who they are. They change the way they think and the actions they make. There is nothing wrong with being shy. In fact, I have come to believe that what out society needs is not less shyness but a little more.</p>
<p>The Eight Habits of Highly Popular People</p>
<a>hormones</a> directly, which in turn affect almost every part of our body, including the immune system. They also improve mental health. Having large social networks can help lower stress in times of crisis, alleviate
<a>depression</a> and provide emotional support.
<p>1. Schedule Your Social Life</p>
<p>You need to do the same. Stop turning down party invitations and start inviting people to visit you at home. Plan outings with close friends or acquaintances you'd like to know better.</p>
<p>3. Engage in Social Reconnaissance</p>
<p>Like detectives, the socially competent are highly skilled at information gathering, always scanning the scene for important details to guide their actions. They direct their focus outward, observing others and listening actively.</p>
<p>To infer correctly what others must be feeling, the socially confident are also able to identify and label their own experience accurately. That is where many people, particularly men, fall short.</p>
<p>"You don't have to be interesting. You have to be interested," explains John Gottman, Ph.D., professor of psychology at the University of Washington. "That's how you have conversations."</p>
<p>4. Enter Conversations Gracefully</p>
<p>Timing is everything. After listening and observing on the perimeter of a group they want to join, the socially competent look for an opportunity to step in, knowing it doesn't just happen. It usually appears as a lull in the conversation.</p>
<p>5. Learn to Handle Failure</p>
<p>It is a fact of life that everyone will sometimes be rejected. Rebuffs happen even to popular people, What distinguishes the socially confident from mere mortals is their reaction to rejection.</p>
<p>And should they reject others' bids to join with them, they do it in a polite and positive way. They invariably offer a reason or counter with an alternative idea: "I would love to talk with you later."</p>
<p>6. Take Hold of Your Emotions</p>
<a>sense of humor</a>. But even in your darkest moments, try to see the lighter side of a situation.
<li>64% of shy individuals view their shyness as a result of external factors beyond their control, such as early family experiences, over protective parents or peer victimization.</li>
<li>24% attribute shyness to internal factors within their control, such as intrapersonal difficulties, like low self-esteem and high self-consciousness, or interpersonal difficulties, like poor social skills and dating difficulties.</li>
<li>62% experience feelings of shyness daily.</li>
<li>82% report shyness as an undesirable experience.</li>
<p>Types of Individuals who make the shy feel shy:</p>
<li>71% persons of the opposite <a>sex</a>, in a group</li>
<li>65% persons of the opposite sex, one-on-one</li>
<li>56% persons of the same sex, in a group</li>
<li>45% relatives, other than immediate family</li>
<li>38% persons of the same sex, one-on-one</li>
<ul><li>46% believe their shyness can be overcome.</li> <li>7.2% do not believe their shyness can be overcome.</li> <li>85% are willing to work seriously at overcoming shyness.</li> </ul>

<h2> Shyness is an overgeneralized response to fear; and it's easy to beat once you understand this. </h2>
<p> By Bernardo Carducci and Philip G. Zimbardo published November 1, 1995 - last reviewed on May 6, 2020 </p>
<p>If you're shy you have lots of company. Nearly one of two Americans claims to be shy. What's more, the incidence is rising, and technology may be turning ours into a culture of shyness.</p>
<li>Research in my laboratory and elsewhere suggests that, courtesy of changing cultural conditions, the incidence of shyness in the U.S. may now be as high as 48 percent--and rising.</li>
<li>Most shyness is hidden. Only a small percentage of the shy appear to be obviously ill at ease. But all suffer internally.</li>
<li>Some people are born with a temperamental tilt to shyness. But even that inheritance doesn't doom one to a life of averting others' eyes. A lot depends on <a>parenting</a>.</li>
<li>Most shyness is acquired through life experiences.</li>
<li>There is a neurobiology of shyness. At least three brain centers that mediate fear and anxiety orchestrate the whole-body response we recognize as shyness. Think of it as an over-generalized fear response.</li>
<li>The incidence of shyness varies among countries. Israelis seem to be the least shy inhabitants of the world. A major contributing factor: cultural styles of assigning praise and blame to kids.</li>
<li>Shyness has huge costs to individuals at all ages, especially in Western cultures.</li>
<li>Shyness does have survival value.</li>
<li>Despite the biological hold of shyness, there are now specific and well-documented ways to overcome its crippling effects.</li>
<p>"There are a lot of people who have private aspects of shyness who are willing to say they are shy but don't quite gibe with the people we can see trembling or blushing; notes Pilkonis.</p>
<a>introverts</a>, a term often confused with shyness. Introverts have the conversational skills and
<a>self esteem</a> necessary for interacting successfully with others but prefer to be alone. Shy people want very much to be with others but lack the social skills and self-esteem.
<a>anxious</a> and shy. Those whose parents do not shield them from
<a>stressful</a> situations overcome their inhibition.
<p>If only 15 to 20 percent of infants are born shy and nearly 50 percent of us are shy in adulthood, where do all the shy adults come from? The only logical answer is that shyness is acquired along the way.</p>
<a>attachment</a> are more likely to end up shy. Children form attachments to their care givers from the routine experiences of care, feeding, and caressing. When
<a>intimacy</a> into a world of relationships that used to be defined only by
<a>friendship</a> and relatives. A complicated task!
<a>mid-life</a> might be one. "A whole new set of problems kick in with a failure of a relationship, especially if you are interested in establishing new relationships," says Pilkonis. For highly successful,
<a>career</a>-defined people, being fired from a long-held job can be similarly debilitating, especially in the interviewing process.
<a>assertiveness</a>, dominance, independence, and
<a>risk-taking</a>. Hence a stigma surrounding shyness.
<p>The costs of shyness cut deeper than material success, and they take on different forms over a lifetime.</p>
<p>o Shy kids also have to endure teasing and peer rejection. Because of their general disposition for high reactivity, shy children make prime targets for bullies. Who better to tease and taunt than someone who gets scared easily and cries?</p>
<a>peer pressure</a> to drink or use drugs than do less shy adolescents. They also confide that they use drugs and alcohol to feel less self-conscious and to achieve a greater sense of acceptance.
<p>Performance anxiety may also make the prospect of sex overwhelming. And because shy people avoid seeking help, any problems created by <a>embarrassment</a> or self-doubt will likely go untreated.</p>
<p>If the costs of shyness are paid by shy people, the benefits of shyness are reaped by others--parents, teachers, friends, and society as a whole.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, the future of shyness is bleak. My studies have documented that since 1975 its prevalence has risen from 40 percent to 48 percent. There are many reasons to expect the numbers to climb in the decades ahead.</p>
<p>The electronic age was supposed to give us more time, but ironically it has stolen it from us. Technology has made us time-efficient and redefined our sense of time and its value. It is not to be wasted, but to be used quickly and with a purpose.</p>
<p>Technology is not the only culprit. The rise of organized sports for kids and the fall of informal sidewalk games robs kids of the chance to learn to work out their own relationship problems. Instead, the coach and the referee do it.</p>

<p>Bill Gates is quiet and bookish, but apparently unfazed by others’ opinions of him: He’s an introvert, but not shy.</p>
<a>introversion</a> are not the same thing. Shyness is the
<a>anxious</a>-stable spectrum on the vertical. With this model, you end up with four quadrants of personality types: calm extroverts, anxious (or impulsive) extroverts, calm introverts, and anxious introverts.
<a>extroverted</a>), yellow bile made them choleric (impulsively extroverted), phlegm made them phlegmatic (calmly introverted), and black bile made them melancholic (anxiously introverted.)
<p>But if shyness and introversion are so different, why do we often link them, especially in the popular media?</p>
<p>Galen aside, poets and philosophers throughout history, like John Milton and Arthur Schopenhauer, have associated shyness with introversion. As the anthropologist C.A. Valentine once wrote,</p>
<a>social life</a> is painful, she is motivated to discover the pleasures of solitude and other minimally social environments. And an introvert may become shy after continually receiving the message that there’s something wrong with him.

<p>Also, shyness implies submissiveness. And in a competitive culture that reveres alpha dogs, one-downsmanship is probably the most damning trait of all.</p>

<h1> Adolescence and Shyness </h1>
<h2> With courage and practice, adolescent shyness can be overcome. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Shyness? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>It's hard to enter <a>adolescence</a> and not feel shy more of the time.</p>
<a>education</a> at school. Shyness often arises from painful self-consciousness.
<a>sense of humor</a> the way older people do."
<a>outgoing</a> to survive the evening, hopefully without harmful incident. Over the course of adolescence, shyness is everywhere.
<a>self-confidence</a>, limited conversational skills, and
<a>social anxiety</a>, all of which result in the avoidance of social interaction that the young person actually desires. Shyness can become its own worst enemy when feeling shy causes the teenager to act shy, which makes feeling shy worse.
<p>In encouraging this growth, parents need to be respectful of four common fears that often contribute to adolescent shyness.</p>
<p>There is the fear of being known. "I don't like drawing <a>attention</a> to myself. I'd rather just observe what's going on."</p>
<p>There is the fear of being embarrassed. "I don't want to do or say anything other people might consider stupid. I'd rather not participate."</p>

<p>There is the fear of being rejected. "I don't want to reach out and get ignored or be turned away. I'd rather keep to myself."</p>
<p>There is the fear of being speechless. "I don't want to start talking and become tongue-tied. I'd rather just say nothing."</p>
<p>To recover from shyness requires the courage of counterintuitive <a>decision-making</a>. Although feeling frightened, we must choose to act in non-fearful, confident, and outgoing ways.</p>
<p>Parents need to honor the ambivalence of the adolescent who wants to escape the prison of shyness but fears leaving the protection of that refuge. Then they can give some simple instructions.</p>
<p>For the shy adolescent that doesn't know what to say or doesn't have anything to say, encourage joining a common-interest group where everyone already shares something they like to do, and when they get together the focus is on doing that.</p>
<a>fantasy</a> gaming group, movie making group, volunteer group, theatre group, among others.
<p>The curse is that this practice only takes you so far. There is no substitute for in-person, eye to eye, spoken communication where knowing each other is additionally informed by all the non-verbal cues each person is sending and picking up.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, a young man described shyness with a descriptor that really struck me: "When you're shy, you're there but you're really not there."</p>
<p>"Like this, you mean?" and I recited that old childhood rhyme: "Yesterday upon a stair, I met a man who wasn't there. I met him there again today. I wish that man would go away!"</p>
<p>"Yes," he said. "Shyness is the man everyone would like to go away."</p>

<p>Whether it's at a party or on a plane, when people find out that I study <a>shyness</a>, the first question they invariably ask me is: "Are we born shy?" The answer to that question is absolutely not! There is no way that we can be born shy.</p>
<p>The Role of Self: A Necessary Component</p>
<a>attention</a> of some of the world's greatest thinkers, including Charles Darwin. In the late 1870s, Darwin proposed that the origin of the self begins when a child is able to recognize himself or herself in the mirror.
<p>The Role of Inhibited Temperament: All Shook Up!</p>
<p>The notion that people are born shy is simply a belief about shyness, not a fact, about shyness. There are many things shy individuals can do to control their shyness instead of letting their shyness control them--biology is not destiny.</p>
<p>In future entries on this blog, I will discuss what shy individuals can do to take control of their shyness and be "successfully shy." But more on that later.</p>

<a>motivation</a> and commitment.
<p>To find a good solution, you have to identify what gets in your way. Figure out your obstacles and then categorize them – what can you control, what can you influence, and what’s out of your control?</p>
<p>Focus on those things you can control and influence, and forget about the rest. For example, there is no access to good food: Can you influence this by buying online, asking someone else to shop for you, or joining a co-op?</p>
<p>Many obstacles have workarounds, but some don’t. Focus on those you can do something about, and don’t put energy toward those you cannot.</p>
<p>In addition to general obstacles, figure out what is important to you and do what works only for you, not for others. </p>
<p>This is your year. It can be done – commit to taking the important steps for yourself, and just put one foot in front of the other as you travel toward a healthier you. </p>
