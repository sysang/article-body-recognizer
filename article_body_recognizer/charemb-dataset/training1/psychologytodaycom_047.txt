<div> <div> <h1>What Causes Autism?</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>The unsatisfying answer to this question is that scientists still don’t fully grasp what leads to autism. Rather than a single gene or lifestyle trend, autism is the result of complex interactions between many different factors.</p>
<p>The number of children diagnosed with the disorder has risen dramatically since the 1960s. Experts believe that much of the change can be attributed to changes in diagnostic criteria and greater awareness among clinicians and the general public.</p>
<h2> What are genetic risk factors for autism? </h2>
<p>It is important to understand that having genetic risk factors for autism does not mean that a person will necessarily go on to develop the condition.</p>
<h2> Do environmental factors cause autism? </h2>
<a>diabetes,</a> high blood pressure, and infection during pregnancy. Having an older father is also a risk factor, likely because the chance of spontaneous genetic mutations increases with age.
<h2> Do vaccines cause autism? </h2>
<p>No. There is no connection between vaccines and autism. Vaccines are powerful tools that doctors and parents rely on to protect children from dangerous illnesses.</p>
<a>deeply flawed and later retracted</a> by the journal that published it. Rigorous research has continued to find no connection between the two.
<h2> What prenatal factors increase the risk of autism? </h2>
<a> thalidomide or valproic acid</a> during pregnancy can raise the risk of autism, according to the CDC. There is some research that antidepressant use during pregnancy increases the risk of autism, but that research is not yet definitive.
<a>diabetes,</a> or high blood pressure during pregnancy. This may be due to the manner in which
<a>inflammation and the immune response</a> influence the developing fetus. There also seem to be correlations between autism risk and pregnancies that are less than a year apart.
<p>Some evidence indicates taking prenatal vitamins containing folic acid, vitamin B-9, and vitamin D may offer some protection and reduce the likelihood of autism.</p>
<h2> What is causing rates of autism to increase? </h2>
<a>prevalence of autism has continued to rise</a> over the past few decades. Today,
<a>1 in 54 children</a> are estimated to have autism, according to the CDC. Research suggests that this surge is not due to changes in the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the condition. The rising prevalence is instead likely due to
<a>changes in the diagnostic criteria and greater awareness of autism and its symptoms.</a>
<h2> Are boys more likely than girls to have autism? </h2>
<p>Autism occurs <a>4 times more often</a> in boys than in girls. This asymmetry may be due to a combination of biological and diagnostic forces. </p>
<h2> Why are boys more likely to have autism? </h2>
<a>extreme form of the male brain,</a> the theory goes, as men tend to be drawn to systems and efficiency while women excel at empathy and reading emotions. Others have
<a>pushed back</a> that underlying biological differences between the sexes could not be large enough to account for the condition and the idea hasn’t been replicated by other scholars.
<p>From a diagnostic perspective, clinicians may be more aware of the condition in boys and therefore identify it more readily. Additionally, the instruments to screen and diagnose the conditions were created and validated on males.</p>
<a>symptoms may present differently,</a> and they may learn to camouflage the condition. Women may be overlooked or misdiagnosed as a result, but finally receiving a diagnosis has the
<a>potential to be life-changing.</a>

<h2> How is autism diagnosed? </h2>
<a>clinicians rely on children’s behavior</a> for screening and diagnostic assessments.
<h2> At what age is autism typically diagnosed? </h2>
<p>Most children can be reliably diagnosed with autism at age 2. Some kids may be diagnosed earlier if they have more severe symptoms, but most children in the U.S are diagnosed at age 4 or later.</p>

<h2> What are the early signs of autism? </h2>
<p>Early signs of autism include avoiding eye contact, not showing interest in other children or parents, talking less than other children, and feeling distressed by small changes to the daily routine, <a>according to the CDC.</a></p>
<a>reaching developmental milestones</a>. But it’s important to keep in mind that autism

<li>Major Depression with mixed features means manic/hypomanic symptoms are superimposed on the depressive episode.</li>
<li>Mixed features means manic/hypomanic symptoms are present, but it doesn't mean the person will develop a bipolar disorder.</li>
<li>Due to similarities to bipolar disorder, mixed features usually require psychiatry, along with psychotherapy, to stabilize.</li>

<li>Significantly less sleep required to feel rested</li>
<li>Inflation of <a>self-esteem</a></li>
<li>Pressure to keep talking/more talkative than normal</li>

<a>manic episodes</a> and enter full Bipolar territory. Thus, developing a skilled eye for emerging Mixed Features is key. At first, it may be difficult to differentiate Mixed Features from someone with the agitation and intense trouble focusing due to
<a>Melancholic Features</a>. There are some key points to help differentiate these and to identify superimposed hy/manic symptoms in general:
<li>Most people with depression have slowed thinking and thus their trouble focusing. If the patient's thought process and speech are pressured/tangential (just can't stop talking) despite being depressed, that is a good indicator of a Mixed Feature.</li>
<li>Another matter of thought process is flights of ideas where the person is jumping from topic to topic, as someone with ADHD might do.</li>
<a>hyperactive</a>, "flavor" about them, this is indicative of a Mixed Feature. Another tip-off is, despite not
<a>sleeping</a>, they don't seem tired.
<a>sexual</a> activity, gambling, substance use, etc. is also quite different from the average depressed patient, and another sign of a Mixed Feature.
<li>If the person's demeanor shifts from poor self-esteem to thinking highly of themselves in some capacity, or develop grand ideas of things they plan to work on.</li>

<h1> Nikyra McCann Is "Still Standing" With Bipolar </h1>
<h2> A NAMI board member shines a light on mental health of underserved persons. </h2>
<p>ML: Hello, Nikyra [Ni-KYE-rah], and welcome. We had our first conversation last year and you’ve taken Still Standing Enterprise to a whole other level.<sup>1</sup> Tell me about the mission for Still Standing.</p>
<p>NM: The mission for Still Standing is to inspire and uplift those who are down and those who are in need of encouragement through mental health — to be the backbone to help others.</p>
<p>ML: Do you serve a specific age group?</p>
<a>teenagers</a> aged 13 and up. I’ve mainly been speaking through NAMI,
<sup>2</sup> speaking with and training police officers,
<sup>3</sup> ... and things like that. We have some contracts I’m working on to go more into the mental health field.
<a>trauma</a>. It’s not de-escalating the situation or recognizing the person as a patient versus a prisoner. That’s really strong stuff.
<p>ML: Now I did see somewhere online that Still Standing is presenting workshops and seminars. Do they focus on <a>bipolar</a>, or is it general mental illness, or do you have different seminars for different things?</p>
<h3>Art and Music Therapy for Mental Health</h3>
<p>ML: Tell me about the art and music therapy.</p>
<p>ML: You’re really pulling people together.</p>
<p>NM: It’s like when life breaks you, you can let it break you in a good way to motivate you and put you back together so you can help others. That’s just what I’ve learned.</p>
<p>ML: I agree. You either wind up breaking down or breaking through. What’s next with NAMI in Dane County?</p>
<p>ML: Tell me about the underserved communities. Who is underserved, and who are you reaching out to?</p>
<p>NM: African-Americans. That’s what I’ve seen and experienced. I’m speaking from my personal life and people around me going through similar issues.</p>
<p>ML: In what ways are they underserved? Is it <a>medication</a>? Therapy? Basic needs?</p>
<h3>The Underserved Get Served</h3>
<p>ML: Is there enough financial support and guidance coming from legal or community authorities to help fill in those gaps?</p>
<sup>4</sup> to help fill in the gap for people dealing with mental health. Now it’s coming more into the light, and people are being adapted more to help in these circumstances; hopefully we’re pushing forward to help things get better.
<p>ML: Good. We need that. ... I thank you so much for your time. I’m sure your story and efforts will help lots and lots of people.</p>
<p>NM: You’re welcome.</p>

<h1> Rediscovering the Hypomanic Personality </h1>
<h2> Modern acceptance of a historical condition is warranted. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Personality? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>People with hypomanic personality types tend to be driven, impulsive, cocksure, intrusive, and, though often cheerful, can be moody.</li>
<li>Hypomanic personality is correlated with the risk of developing bipolar disorders.</li>
<li>Hypomanic personality can be mistaken for severe ADHD at first glance.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Timothy Dyes/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>personality disorders</a>, like the
<a>passive-aggressive</a>, have come and gone from the
<a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM) for various reasons. These include what was called the cyclothymic
<a>hypomanic</a> (or hyperthymic) personality.
<a>psychoanalytic</a> world (McWilliams, 2011), no spotlight ever returned on the condition.
<p>The case of Davie (composite <a>identity</a>) begins to illustrate the hypomanic personality:</p>
<a>therapy</a>, as if they were old friends. Chattering about the beautiful painting on the wall and nice weather, he quickly changed topics to being
<a>grateful</a> Dr. H could meet with him and “get this all behind me.”
<a>ADHD</a>. As Dr. H got to know him, his tendency for a zealous disposition, slightly more than tasteful
<a>confidence</a>, and, at times, expansive affect, made it seem he was in a chronic hypomanicc episode.
<p>A challenge for even the seasoned Dr. H, Davie fit the profile of someone with what has been called a hypomanic/hyperthymic, or, as personality theorist Theodore Millon called them, exuberant personality disorder.</p>
<h3>Defining the Condition</h3>
<p>Interestingly, while many diagnoses have morphed in definition since Victorian times, Akiskal et al. (1998) noted that their modern research supported the existence of this hypomanic personality as defined by the aforementioned historical figures.</p>
<p>More objectively, Millon (2011) explained that people with this personality exhibit a profile that is:</p>
<li>Mercurial in mood. They’re often emotionally overzealous, though their exuberant and cheery mood often gives way to turbulence/dysphoria (unpleasant moods). <div> <div> <div> <div>Source: AbsolutVision/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div> </li>
<li>Needlessly intrusive, vivacious, and socially buoyant.</li>
<li>Cognitively disarrayed with scrambled thoughts and minimal ability to focus.</li>
<li>See the self as a dynamic force, both tireless and enterprising.</li>
<li>Suggest their own importance through hyperbole and magnification of events.</li>
<li>Frequently unable to achieve purposeful <a>goals</a> due to their always-surging impulses.</li>

<h1> Navigating Information During an Age of Mental Health Consumerism </h1>
<h2> The potential for education during an era of online health consumerism. </h2>
<li>Society has placed a higher value on mental health over the last decade, in part as a result of the internet. </li>
<li>Online dissemination of information about mental health brings about opportunity and also potential harm. </li>
<li>Clarification of mental health terms for symptoms, signs, diagnoses, and treatments should be a high priority for mental health experts. </li>
<a>teenager</a> reaching stages of pubertal development, we’re taking risks, we’re often boastful and self-centered, we’re highly aware and sensitive to others who pose as
<a>competition</a>, we’re “experts” at nearly everything, we’re often reckless and irresponsible with what we say and share, we find difficulty in learning from experience, and sadly, it’s all impacting our mental health.
<h3>Misunderstandings and misuses of complex mental health terms</h3>
<p>“Mood swings” = <a>Bipolar disorder</a></p>
<a>manic episode</a> is so destructive, the person may need to be hospitalized to receive medications to bring them back into a period of normality (called euthymia). While it is true that

<p>“I am bipolar”</p>
<p>“My depression…”</p>
<p>“My OCD…”</p>
<a>obsessive compulsive</a> disorder (OCD) can worry about things that can be related or even unrelated to a stressor and can develop unproductive behaviors that solve the worry but not the stressor. For example, a person with OCD can
<p>“My <a>PTSD</a>…”</p>
<p>“I just need to process and/or work through all of this…”</p>
<p>“I’m being triggered…”</p>
<p>“I did my research…”</p>

<h1> Why We Don’t Notice Mental Illness Discrimination </h1>
<h2> Microaggressions often go unnoticed. Here's how to be more aware of them. </h2>
<li>Microaggressions against mental illness might include assumptions that a person may be dangerous, inferior, helpless, or other negative messages.</li>
<li>Microagressions can be harmful but they don't always amount to lawful discrimination. </li>
<li>Many of us fail to realize mental illness stigma is a problem because it is often normalized in our society. </li>
<p>When I first told a colleague about my bipolar disorder, he turned to me and said, in a lilting voice, “Oh wow, you’re doing so well.” Meant as a compliment, this was actually a microaggression. </p>
<a>discrimination</a> without being linked to some other kind of inappropriate action. According to the
<a>because of</a> its prevalence in our society and the existence of structural discrimination across many institutions
<a>A study</a> of mental illness microaggressions found that there was more blatant discrimination than expected, revealing that many people are not yet careful to avoid singling out individuals with mental illness for different treatment
<p>How can we get more people to take a deeper look and notice the inadvertent stigmas embedded in their actions, words, and publications? </p>
<p>Whenever the topic of mental health comes up, do a gut check as to whether something inappropriate may be happening: </p>
<li> <p>Are explicit or implicit messages assuming dangerousness, inferiority, helplessness, or other negative themes being connected to people believed to have a mental illness?</p> </li>
<li>Is screening, questioning, or other different treatment being suggested based on someone having a known or suspected mental health diagnosis?</li>
<li> <p>Even if the content is well-meaning and from a spirit of helping, does it nonetheless single out people with mental health problems for special treatment they did not seek out or consent to?</p> </li>
<p>Create opportunities for people to share feedback about the policies, practices, and published material from your organization: </p>
<li>Listen to someone’s concerns when they share them. </li>
<li>Try to understand why they are upset rather than avoiding communication, defending your position, or dismissing the criticism. </li>
