<div> January 18, 2022 5:00pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 9:06pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Iowa State Cyclones scored a 51-47 victory over Texas Tech when these two faced off in Ames earlier in January, and Texas Tech will be at home in a revenge spot on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The first time these two clashed, Texas Tech was without two of its top three scorers in Terrence Shannon Jr. and Kevin McCullar, both of whom were back on the floor in the team’s most recent game against Kansas State.</p>
<p>Both teams rank in the top eight in points allowed on a per-possession basis on defense, but Iowa State is allowing 14.7 more points per 100 possessions on the road compared to at home.</p>
<p>The Red Raiders are back at full strength and with Iowa State 147th in points scored on a per-possession basis on offense, Texas Tech will get revenge in Iowa State for the loss they took earlier this season.</p>
<p>The play: Texas Tech, -7.5.</p>

<div> January 5, 2022 3:43pm Updated </div>
<p>Nothing quite compares to the feeling of shopping for a new eyeshadow palette. After all, swatching the shades and experimenting with a sparkly nude or subtle smokey eye is any beauty lover’s favorite pastime.</p>
<p>We don’t have to tell you that playing dress-up as an adult can get pricey, and there’s nothing worse than hitting pan on your favorite eyeshadow leaving the rest for the unused cosmetics graveyard.</p>
<p>From affordable drugstore sets to vibrant matte or shimmery palettes alike, you’ll surely find your next go-to.</p>
<ul><li>Alana Wright: A NYC-turned-LA makeup artist with experience in print, television and red carpet events. Her clients have ranged from bestselling authors and the former editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue, Elaine Welteroth, to Frank Ocean.</li></ul>
<h3>What is a go-to eyeshadow tip everyone should know?</h3>
<p>“My go-to eyeshadow tip is to always use an emollient shadow base (concealer or shadow primer) before applying eyeshadow so that it can have long wearability,” Wright said.</p>
<p>As a personal recommendation, <a>Too Faced’s Shadow Insurance</a> is unbeatable.</p>
<h3>How can I create an everyday eyeshadow look?</h3>
<h3>How can I experiment with colorful eyeshadow as a beginner?</h3>
<p>Wright says to “ease into it” or “dive right in.”</p>
<p>Plus, If more color is desired, she recommends blending the shadow onto the lid with a flat shadow placement brush.</p>
<h3>How long should I keep an eyeshadow palette before it ‘expires?’</h3>
<h3>How can I make my eye color pop?</h3>
<p>“Color theory is helpful to make eye color pop in their own unique way,” Wright explains. She provides an overview of which colors look best and complement each eye color:</p>
<ul><li>Brown eyes: Different times of blue like navy and teal, along with deep plums.</li><li>Green and hazel eyes: Purples and hues of green.</li><li>Blue and gray eyes: Violet, red, orange and warm gold tones.</li></ul>
<p>Click below to jump to specialized palette categories:</p>
<h2>Best neutral eyeshadow palettes</h2>
<h3>1. <a>Natasha Denona Bronze Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $65</h3>
<p>Sometimes, sparkly shadows with a hint of shimmer make a world of difference. Natasha Denona’s <a>Bronze Eyeshadow Palette</a> is one of my favorites, especially for its rich pigmentation and ability to last for more than 12 hours. </p>
<p>Specifically, the “true copper,” “bliss” and “silk” shades are too good to pass up.</p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now from sephora</a> </div> </div>
<h3>2. <a>Natasha Denona Retro Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $65</h3>
<a>Retro Eyeshadow Palette</a> made the cut. When I’m aiming for a dreamy date night look, I whip out this palette instantly for its pretty peony-toned shades.
<h3>3. <a>KVD Beauty Lolita Por Vida Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $49.50</h3>
<p>Let’s cut right to the chase — this palette is stunning. It provides a little bit of everything (purples, orange-tones and burnt cranberry) while still reigning true to the neutrals.</p>
<a>Lolita Por Vida Eyeshadow Palette</a> is unique because shades “reina” and “luna” are larger than usual and, conveniently, both are two of the most applicable for everyday wear. Plus, each shade fittingly complements the next.
<div> <div> <a> buy now from kvd beauty</a> </div> </div>
<h3>4. <a>ILIA The Necessary Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $38</h3>
<p>As its name suggests, ILIA’s <a>The Necessary Eyeshadow Palette</a> is just what you need if you want a quick swipe of a sparkly lid color, a good crease color and some options for your outer corner.</p>
<p>I love how sleek the packaging is, how pigmented and balanced the tones look on the skin and how it’s simple to toss in your mini bag for a night out. For less than $40, it’s one of my most recommended palettes.</p>
<h3>5. <a>Glossier “Bluff” Monochromes</a>, $22</h3>
<p>It’s 2022 — if you haven’t ridden the Glossier wave, you’re missing out.</p>
<a>Monochromes</a> eyeshadow trios, with “Bluff” being my favorite three-pack. The colors are deliciously pigmented and look iconic with a great liquid liner, mascara-coated lashes and a creamy lip color.
<p>Not to mention, if you’re looking for an inexpensive, everyday wear option, this easy-to-travel-with mini is just shy of $25.</p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now from glossier</a> </div> </div>
<h3>6. <a>Too Faced Natural Eyes Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $39</h3>
<a>Too Faced Natural Eyes Eyeshadow Palette</a> is the ultimate buy. What’s great about it is its three large lid shades (that you can use as a face highlight, too) and rich gold, plum, and espresso crease colors.
<div> <div> <a> buy now</a> </div> </div>
<h3>7. <a>Natasha Denona Glam Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $65</h3>
<a>Natasha Denona’s Glam Eyeshadow Palette</a> is one of the dreamiest palettes on this list. The shades are extremely blendable, exquisitely luxe and stand out in terms of their rosy champagne and shimmery shades. It’s also one of
<a>RHONJ star Melissa Gorga’s favorite beauty products</a>.
<p>Since the colors blend so well, the natural glam look is effortless to achieve. I enjoy the subtle smokiness it provides, too.</p>
<h3>8. <a>Urban Decay Naked3 Palette</a>, $54</h3>
<a>Naked3 Palette</a>, unique for its warm-toned shades that still offer a good amount of neutral browns. It’s one to shop, for sure.
<h3>9. <a>Violet Voss Mini Crème Brûlée Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $18</h3>
<p><a>Violet Voss’ Mini Crème Brûlée Eyeshadow Palette</a> is, undoubtedly, the perfect purchase to prepare for autumn. Not to mention, the bottom row satisfies all our sparkly dreams.</p>
<h3>10. <a>Sephora Collection Eye Love Bloom Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $14</h3>
<p>What’s more, the colors are incredibly blend-able for the palette priced at less than $15. It’s also a miniature dupe for Tarte’s <a>In Bloom Clay Eyeshadow Palette</a>.</p>
<h3>11. <a>Tarte Tartelette In Bloom Clay Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $42</h3>
<p>I swear by <a>Tarte’s Tartelette In Bloom Clay Eyeshadow Palette</a>. This was one of the first palettes I used in high school — so, perfect for beginners — and all the shades smoothly transition into one another. </p>
<h3>12. <a>Huda Beauty Nude Obsessions Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $29</h3>
<p>The selection of shimmery and matte shades adds even more value to this less-than-$30 product.</p>
<h2>Best matte eyeshadow palettes</h2>
<h3>1. <a>Too Faced Born This Way The Natural Nudes Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $49</h3>
<p>This eyeshadow palette is simply beautiful. It gives you the most gorgeous shimmer and sparkle and is perfect for mature, evening looks and captivating daytime glam alike.</p>
<p>Designed with every shade — shimmery and matte — that you’ll ever need, you can create dynamic daytime looks and smokey shimmered looks with just one <a>Too Faced Born This Way Palette</a>.</p>
<div> <div> buy now </div> </div>
<h3>2. <a>Makeup by Mario Master Mattes Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $48</h3>
<a>Master Mattes Eyeshadow Palette</a> is a clear-cut reason why. Versatile for filling in sparse spots on your brows or acting as a precise contour, you’ll find yourself reaching for this palette again and again.
<h3>3. <a>Tarte Tartelette Amazonian Clay Matte Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $42</h3>
<p>I’ve had this palette for the better part of a decade, and compared to the In Bloom Palette, it’s almost neck-and-neck. But, I reach for this palette when I want the “no makeup” makeup look.</p>
<h3>4. <a>Anastasia Beverly Hills Soft Glam Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $45</h3>
<a>Soft Glam Eyeshadow Palette</a> is absolutely divine. I’ve been loving the “sultry” and “dusty rose” shades, along with “glistening” and “mulberry” shades for holiday date night looks.
<p>The shade range from champagne to rose-pink to darker reds and gold makes it one of my favorite palettes on this list, notably because it’s perfect for each season.</p>
<h3>5. <a>Morphe 35O Supernatural Glow Artistry Palette</a>, $26</h3>
<p>If you purchase only one eyeshadow kit from this roundup, I highly suggest <a>Morphe’s 35O Supernatural Glow Artistry Palette</a>.</p>
<h3>6. <a>Urban Decay Naked2 Basics Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $29</h3>
<a>Urban Decay’s Naked2 Basics Eyeshadow Palette</a>, so I’m just going to list three reasons why you should buy it: it’s unbeatable for traveling, absolutely stunning on hazel and brown eyes and less than $30.
<p>I’ve had this palette for about three years and it was always my ol’ reliable for going to class or on a weekend day trip.</p>
<h3>7. <a>Charlotte Tilbury Luxury Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $53</h3>
<p>Charlotte Tilbury is known for the bronzed and beautiful makeup look — and its <a>‘Pillow Talk’ lipstick</a>, which I can talk all day about — and its <a>Luxury Eyeshadow Palette </a>aligns with the brand’s artistry. </p>
<p>With four essential shades, including light champagne, warm brown, chocolate brown, and dark taupe, you’ll be equipped to create a striking yet natural finish.</p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now</a> </div> </div>
<h3>8. <a>Violet Voss Matte Vibes Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $30</h3>
<p>Perfect if you’re into burnt oranges and darker shadows, <a>Violet Voss’ Matte Vibes Eyeshadow Palette</a> brings 10 shadows together for a dynamite look. Plus, its “Boo-yah” shade is ideal for filling in dark eyebrows.</p>
<h3>9. <a>Urban Decay Naked Petite Heat Palette</a>, $29</h3>
<p>The <a>Urban Decay Naked Petite Heat Palette</a> gives you a variety: soft champagnes, darker browns, and a vibrant, fiery “wild thing” shade. That said, it’s great for summer vacations and bolder winter looks alike.</p>
<h2>Best colorful eyeshadow palettes</h2>
<h3>1. <a>Huda Beauty Rose Quartz Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $67</h3>
<p>Enter one of Huda Beauty’s more recent launches, the <a>Rose Quartz Eyeshadow Palette</a>. I was intrigued to try this palette, as each shade has something unique to offer. </p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now from sephora</a> </div> </div>
<h3>2. <a>Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance Eye Shadow Palette</a>, $45</h3>
<a>blending brush</a> to ensure the colors transition to your liking.
<h3>3. <a>Anastasia Beverly Hills Norvina Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $45</h3>
<a>Anastasia Beverly Hills Norvina Eyeshadow Palette</a>, above all others I’ve tried, stands out for its dazzling golds (literally one of the shadow names), deep plums, and fun pinks.
<h3>4. <a>Violet Voss Like a Boss — PRO Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $31 (originally $45)</h3>
<p><a>Violet Voss’ Like a Boss Eyeshadow Palette</a> not only has a cute rhyming name, but is one of the most — if not, the most — versatile palettes in this roundup. </p>
<h3>5. <a>Morphe x Jaclyn Hill Palette Volume II</a>, $39</h3>
<p><a>Jaclyn Hill</a> is one of the biggest makeup artists online, and her <a>second edition palette</a>, in collaboration with Morphe, is showstopping. It’s another neutral and colorful hybrid you’ll find plenty of uses for.</p>
<h3>6. Natasha Denona Lila Eyeshadow Palette, $129</h3>
<p>If fall and spring had a baby, it would be <a>Natasha Denona’s Lila Eyeshadow Palette</a>. That said, aside from the palette’s shades being ultra shimmery, flattering and highly pigmented, it’s also universal for any season.</p>
<p>Fit for all occasions and makeup preferences, the shades are stunning, and striking — a top buy, for sure.</p>
<h3>7. <a>Too Faced Mini That’s My Jam Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $27</h3>
<p>Think PBJ — but on your eyes.</p>
<a>Too Faced’s Mini That’s My Jam Eyeshadow Palette</a> has one of the most glittery color selections in this roundup, including hot pink and a purple pop. It’s a great first palette for experimenting with bolder, different looks, too.
<h3>8. <a>One/Size by Patrick Starrr Visionary Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $21 (originally $42)</h3>
<p>One/Size by Patrick Starrr is one of Sephora’s bestselling brands, and for a good reason — the <a>Visionary Eyeshadow Palette</a> is great for all makeup fans.</p>
<p>For starters, the left side of the palette is warm, the right side is cool, and the middle is great for all eye colors. It’s a specially curated palette to simply apply and enjoy your eye look.</p>
<h2>Best drugstore eyeshadow palettes</h2>
<h3>1. <a>Maybelline The Blushed Nudes Eyeshadow Makeup Palette</a>, $9.12 (originally $11.99)</h3>
<p>As one of Amazon’s bestsellers in the beauty department, Maybelline’s <a>The Blushed Nudes Eyeshadow Makeup Palette</a> is comparable to many high-end products with warm rosy shades and neutral staples.</p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now from amazon</a> </div> </div>
<h3>2. <a>NYX ‘Warm Neutrals’ Ultimate Shadow Palette</a>, $11.56 (originally $18)</h3>
<p>I’ll be honest, I’m a devout Sephora shopper, but NYX is a brand I’ll keep repurchasing.</p>
<a>liquid liner</a> — and its
<a>Ultimate ‘Warm Neturals’ Shadow Palette</a> is the perfect variety pack for anyone interested in warm tones that will pop on the eye.
<h3>3. <a>L’Oreal Paris Paradise Enchanted Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $9.44 (originally $11.99)</h3>
<p>Well, L’Oreal Paris’ <a>Paradise Enchanted Eyeshadow Palette</a> is just peachy.</p>
<p>Not only would the gold shades look stunning in golden hour light but the palette is affordable and offers rich browns for a more complete bundle.</p>
<h3>4. <a>Revlon So Fierce! Prismatic Eyeshadow Palette</a>, $8.40 (originally $10.99)</h3>
<p>With four shades that are rich in color and beautiful on any eye color, <a>the aqua-and-neutral quad</a> by Revlon is a great staple for your makeup bag (and to bring on summer vacations).</p>
<h3>5. <a>Prism Makeup Highly Pigmented Eye Makeup Palette</a>, $9.99</h3>
<a>Highly Pigmented Eye Makeup Palette</a> has brought me back to my middle school days. Optimal for experimentation, you’ll find every color of the rainbow to brush, blend, and beautify your eyes.
<p>Though it’s not my most used palette, it’s unmatched for bolder looks or refining your makeup applying technique.</p>

<h1> We tested 30 shampoos to find the best for many hair concerns in 2022</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 12, 2022 4:28pm Updated </div>
<p>Much like finding the perfect full-coverage foundation or creamy concealer, choosing the best shampoo for your hair type can easily turn into a wild goose chase.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the subject of in-shower hair care can be pretty dividing. How often should I use shampoo each week? What’s the best shampoo for oily hair? Dry scalp? Do I really have to rinse and repeat?</p>
<p>These questions are all valid, especially if your No. 1 goal is to achieve salon-worthy hair at home (with or without the TikTok-famous <a>Dyson Airwrap</a>, but that’s an article for another day).</p>
<p>That said, we consulted two hairstylists who provided the 411 on all things shampoo, from ingredients to how to apply it to your scalp.</p>
<a>Amy Abramite</a>, hairstylist, salon educator and creative director at Maxine Ltd. in Chicago, told the Post. “Having a few different shampoos in the shower to rotate is an effective way to treat multiple concerns simultaneously.”
<p>Plus, for more hair advice, check out <a>our expert-backed FAQ</a> for the answers to your burning questions.</p>
<h2>An overview of my hair type</h2>
<p>I like to say my hair type is a little bit of everything, which made testing a unique experience for touching on different hair types and textures. My hair is the Goldilocks of texture (not too thick or too thin) and is a hybrid of curly and wavy. </p>
<p>But, when blown out, I can lean to almost straight — as long as slight frizz is tame (which, can rely heavily on choosing the right shampoo).</p>
<p>What’s more, after visiting a dermatologist, I realized I have a dry scalp (which is pure genetics) and find that dandruff shampoos help mitigate severe dryness. However, my hair tends to become oily if I don’t wash it every other day.</p>
<p>Plainly stated, I’m a mut of hair types, which is why I wanted to get to the bottom of which shampoo makes my hair the least oily, the least dry and how I can avoid formulas that simply won’t work well.</p>
<h2>How to choose the right shampoo for your hair type, per experts</h2>
<a>Andrew Fitzsimons</a>, celebrity hairstylist for Kim Kardashian, Megan Fox, Jennifer Lopez and more, told the Post. “It’s critical to check ingredients for harmful chemicals to avoid exacerbating your hair problems further.”
<p>Click to jump to a specific shampoo:</p>
<h2>Best shampoos for dandruff</h2>
<h3>1. <a>Oribe Serene Scalp Anti-Dandruff Shampoo</a>, $46</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Oribe Serene Scalp Balancing Conditioner</a>, $48</li></ul>
<p>Not to mention, this formula is vegan, recommended for all hair types and textures and will hydrate your hair from root to tip.</p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now from sephora</a> </div> </div>
<h3>2. <a>OUAI Detox Shampoo</a>, $30</h3>
<p>Pairs well with: <a>OUAI Detangling and Frizz-Fighting Leave-In Conditioner</a>, $26</p>
<p>Truthfully, OUAI’s Detox Shampoo is a breath of fresh air on my strands. It’s best on oily hair but deeply cleansed product buildup on my scalp and diminished the effects of dandruff. </p>
<p>Plus, it’s formulated with apple cider vinegar and keratin that visibly worked in tandem to strengthen my hair strands. Oh, and the smell is like a salon in a bottle!</p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now from ouai</a> </div> </div>
<h3>3. <a>Fekkai Apple Cider Detox Shampoo</a>, $25</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Fekkai Apple Cider Detox Scrub</a>, $30 (applied before shampooing); <a>Fekkai Apple Cider Detox Rinse Conditioning Detangler</a>, $25 (applied after shampooing)</li></ul>
<p>When first introduced to Fekkai’s Apple Cider Detox Shampoo, I didn’t have high hopes. A three-step washing process? Who has the time for that? But, I was proven wrong. </p>
<p>This entire line not only refreshed the natural bounce and body of my hair but it gently removed flaky buildup near my roots. And, it’s one of those shampoos that leaves your hair squeaky clean (which I love).</p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now from ulta beauty</a> </div> </div>
<h3>4. <a>First Aid Beauty Anti-Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Pyrithone Zinc (ZPT)</a>, $30</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>First Aid Beauty Anti-Dandruff Scalp Serum with 2% Salicylic Acid</a>, $32 (applied after shampoo)</li></ul>
<p>Including pyrithone zinc to combat dandruff, First Aid Beauty’s recently launched Anti-Dandruff Shampoo that fights flakes and soothes the scalp. Personally, it worked for me and impressively didn’t dry out my scalp.</p>
<p>Plus, the lather generated is rich and frothy, which helped to replenish my dry hair. If you’re looking for a well-formulated product that doesn’t cost upwards of $100, this one’s your best bet.</p>
<div> <div> <a> buy now from first aid beauty</a> </div> </div>
<h2>Best shampoos for oily hair</h2>
<p>It’s also a good idea to find a shampoo that targets excessive sebum at the scalp. “Sebum is the body’s natural oil and, when there is too much, the hair gets greasy and weighed down,” Fitzsimons added. </p>
<h3>1. <a>Dae Daily Shampoo</a>, $24</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Dae Daily Conditioner (Mini Size)</a>, $12</li></ul>
<p>Ideal to capture oils and wonderful on straight and curly hair alike, this clean-formulated shampoo detoxifies impurities without stripping your hair of its natural oils.</p>
<h3>2. <a>Biosilk Silk Therapy Shampoo</a>, $15.50</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Biosilk Silk Therapy Conditioner</a>, $16</li></ul>
<a>Silk Therapy Shine On Spray</a> ($18).
<p>Plus, after washing, my hair lasts a good three to four days without another wash. Typically, I wash my hair every other day so the fact Biosilk combats against unwanted oiliness is an amazing feat.</p>
<h2>Best shampoos for thinning or fine hair</h2>
<p>First things first — fine hair is when the stands are slender in diameter compared to coarse hair where the diameter is larger, according to Abramite. </p>
<h3>1. <a>Alterna Caviar Anti-Aging Multiplying Volume Shampoo</a>, $34</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Alterna Caviar Anti-Aging Multiplying Volume Conditioner</a>, $35</li></ul>
<h3>2. <a>Alterna Caviar Anti-Aging Clinical Densifying Shampoo</a>, $38</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Alterna Caviar Anti-Aging Clinical Densifying Foam Conditioner</a>, $38</li></ul>
<p>Meet Alterna’s sister formula, the Clinical Densifying Shampoo. Per Abramite’s recommendation, densifying shampoos “plump individual strands for thicker-looking hair with more substance.”</p>

<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Briogeo Blossom Bloom Ginseng + Biotin Hair Volumizing Conditioner</a>, $26</li></ul>

<h2>Best drugstore shampoos</h2>
<p>Though both Abramite and Fitzsimons recommend splurging on a high-end shampoo because the ingredients are higher-quality, drugstore shampoos are still an on-the-fly option that’s sure to meet anyone’s budget.</p>
<h3>1. <a>Kristin Ess The One Signature Shampoo</a>, $20</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Kristin Ess The One Signature Conditioner</a>, $20</li></ul>
<p>But, more specifically, this sulfate-free shampoo is a great drugstore score. However, I find it’s best to switch this up with other shampoos, as using this formula too frequently can sometimes make my hair appear flat.</p>

<h3>2. <a>Herbal Essences Sulfate-Free Potent Aloe + Hemp Shampoo Conditioner</a>, $15.60 (originally $19.99)</h3>
<p>Perfect to grab from your drugstore if you’re in a pinch and want a shampoo and conditioner combo that freshly washes your hair, Herbal Essences’ Sulfate-Free Potent Aloe + Hemp line is a great add-to-cart duo.</p>
<p>For one, it’s a trusty reliable I’ve been using for months and doesn’t dry out my hair or leave it super greasy. It’s the Goldilocks of formulas (especially if Goldilocks is on a budget).</p>

<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Not Your Mother’s Naturals Honey Kalahari Desert Melon Repair Protect Conditioner</a>, $8.99</li></ul>
<p>Though there aren’t extreme frills and deep cleans, it didn’t strip my hair which, unfortunately, has been the case with other drugstore shampoos I’ve tried in the past. There isn’t a bad thing to say about this sweet scent.</p>

<h2>Best shampoos for curly hair</h2>
<h3>1. <a>Adwoa Beauty Baomint Moisturizing Shampoo</a>, $22</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Adwoa Beauty Baomint Deep Conditioning Treatment</a>, $36</li></ul>
<p>No lie, I once had a conversation with a Sephora beauty director who told me “everyone should experience this shampoo at least once.” And, its extremely fresh peppermint scent makes it all worth it.</p>
<a>gels</a>, this shampoo is likely more effective on super curly or coily hair.
<h3>2. <a>AG Hair Curl Fresh Shampoo</a>, $32</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>AG Hair Curl Fresh Conditioner</a>, $32</li></ul>
<p>That said, this vegan formula would earn a six out of five stars if possible. Containing peptides, quinoa, keratin and rice extract, you won’t find more of a superfood blend for your luscious locks.</p>
<h3>3. <a>Briogeo Farewell Frizz Smoothing Shampoo</a>, $26</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Briogeo Farewell Frizz Smoothing Conditioner</a>, $26</li></ul>
<p>Briogeo’s Farewell Frizz Smoothing Shampoo is a dreamboat for curly hair that’s prone to frizz. It’s designed for all hair types and textures, is vegan and even gave my hair more fullness.</p>
<p>So, the mixture of a fresh scent, a lessening of the frizz and a strong bounce make this one of the best I’ve tried.</p>
<h3>4. <a>Olaplex No. 4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo</a>, $28</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector</a>, $28 (applied before shampooing); <a>Olaplex No. 5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner</a>, $28</li></ul>
<p>It’s unmatched and wonderful on curly hair, namely because it’s incredibly moisturizing, which Abramite explains is best to soften the curls, add bounce and define the shape.</p>
<h2>Best clarifying shampoos</h2>
<p>This shampoo type is ideal to purify, exfoliate and detoxify the scalp and hair for overall good health, too, according to Abramite.</p>
<h3>1. <a>Adwoa Beauty Blue Tansy Clarifying Gel Shampoo</a>, $22</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Adwoa Beauty Blue Tansy Reparative Conditioner</a>, $22</li></ul>
<p>The first of each month, I’ve been using Adwoa Beauty’s Blue Tansy Clarifying Gel Shampoo and, let me tell you, my hair is cleansed. </p>
<p>But, equally as good as its detox capabilities is how much shine it provides. It’s almost like I used a hair mask, but instead I just went through my normal shampoo and conditioner cycle in the shower.</p>

<h3>2. <a>Chi Keratin Reconstructing Shampoo</a>, $16.50</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Chi Keratin Reconstructing Conditioner</a>, $17.50</li></ul>
<h3>3. <a>Drybar Cure Liqueur Strengthening Shampoo</a>, $32</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Drybar Cure Liqueur Strengthening Conditioner</a>, $32</li></ul>
<p>I decided to pay homage to the talked-about-everywhere blowout salon, Drybar. With its line of products for sale, I was impressed with how purifying — and sweet-smelling — its Cure Liqueur Strengthening Shampoo is.</p>
<p>Recommended on all hair types, it’s especially great for damaged hair. I enjoy using this about a month or two after I trim my hair, to ensure that once split ends may start to rear their ugly head, my hair is still fresh and clean.</p>
<h2>Best shampoos for dry scalp</h2>
<p>“A moisturizing shampoo locks in hydration, nourishes the scalp and boosts hair shine,” Abramite said. “Plant and seed oils will replenish and restore by sealing in moisture and smoothing the cuticle from scalp to ends.”</p>
<h3>1. <a>Acure Ultra Hydrating Shampoo</a>, $9.99</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Acure Ultra Hydrating Conditioner</a>, $9.99</li></ul>
<p>Plus, it’s a shampoo I most frequently use in my hair-washing routine. You simply can’t beat the price and it contains a rich amount of replenishing oils, which our experts approve of.</p>

<h3>2. <a>Aveda Nutriplenish Light-Moisture Shampoo</a>, $35</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Aveda Nutriplenish Light-Moisture Conditioner</a>, $37</li></ul>
<p>If you suffer from the irritation of a dry scalp, Aveda’s Nutriplenish Light-Moisture Shampoo is one of the best you can use. It’s a sulfate-free, invigorating shampoo that I’ve gotten everyone hooked on in the past few months. </p>
<p>Specifically, my roots looked cleaner and more voluminous after several months of using this product. For salon-quality, it’s a good one.</p>

<h3>3. <a>Gisou Honey-Infused Hair Wash Shampoo</a>, $37</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Gisou Honey-Infused Conditioner</a>, $34</li></ul>
<p>One of the trendiest Instagram brands has one of the most impressive formulations for shampoo I’ve tried. It’s one of the most hydrating, too, if that’s what you’re after.</p>
<p>The pretty bottle aside, it truthfully is a compliment-worthy scent that leaves a powerful clean. I’ve been impressed and love using this on special occasions (though you can use it every day, of course).</p>
<h3>4. <a>Moroccanoil Hydrating Shampoo</a>, $24</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>Moroccanoil Hydrating Conditioner</a>, $24</li></ul>
<p>From the makers of one of the best leave-in oils the haircare industry has to offer, Moroccanoil’s Hydrating Shampoo is exactly what it sounds like — a blessing for dry hair.</p>
<a>Moroccanoil Treatment</a> ($44) and
<a>Luminous Hairspray</a> ($24) when I’m styling my hair. Plus, the scent is driven by paradise and it’s an exceptional formula to try for your dry hair.
<h3>5. <a>OUAI Medium Hair Shampoo</a>, $28</h3>
<ul><li>Pairs well with: <a>OUAI Thick Hair Conditioner</a>, $28</li></ul>
<p>Holy salon. OUAI’s Shampoo has to be the best-scented shampoo in this entire edit. It’s a shampoo that deserves even more hype than it already boasts, too, especially for its smooth shine and anti-frizz properties I notice upon styling.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a full-bodied routine, OUAI has an incredible <a>leave-in conditioner</a> ($26) and <a>treatment mask</a> ($38) that makes me feel like a queen. It’s a must-buy, to say the least.</p>
