<p>The current discussion about whether and when to reopen schools glosses over the particular needs of children aged 2 to 5 who would typically be enrolled in daycare, preschool, or pre-k.</p>
<h3>Kids Learn Social Skills Together</h3>
<p>During these early years, youngsters learn basic social skills—how to read others, empathize, take turns, convey their needs, settle conflicts, and persuade.</p>
<p>Infants start learning to read others before they learn to speak. Hands-on learning relies on physical interaction with people and things. It pays off manyfold over the years, and missing out may set young students back.</p>

<h1> Supporting Student Parents' Success in College </h1>
<h2> Student parents face many challenges, not least of which is feelings of guilt. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Coping With Guilt </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: U.S. Federal Government/Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>At least one-fifth of U.S. undergraduates are parents</a>, and make no mistake, they are rock stars: student parents earn higher average GPAs than all other student groups. But despite their success in the classroom,
<a>student parents take longer to earn their degrees</a>, if they finish at all. By some estimates, parents are up to 40% less likely to earn a degree compared to their classmates without children,
<a>a gap that will surely widen amidst the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.
<a>parents spend over 10 hours more ­per day than their peers</a> on tasks like child care, paid work, and housework. On top of time debt, parents carry more than twice the financial debt of students without children. These debts create
<a>stress</a>, force parents to work full-time, and increase the risk that parents and their families will experience economic poverty. In fact,
<a>over half of student parents dealt with food insecurity in the past month </a>and over two-thirds have experienced housing insecurity in the past year.
<p>Student parent <a>guilt</a></p>
<a>Persistence Plus</a> to support college students, parents quite often mention guilt when giving advice to other student parents:
<li>"Your children come first and finding time to study can be difficult. My advice is to study when they're in bed. That way you don't feel guilty for taking time away from them."</li>
<li>"I find that I also schedule specific times and activities with the kids (no phones or distractions) so I can also feel less 'mum guilt' when I need to spend an hour here and there to focus on study."</li>
<li>"Don’t feel guilty for trying to do something for yourself. If a parent does a degree, the whole family does a degree."</li>
<li>"I too was feeling guilty about putting things on the back burner with my kids but they came to understand that what I'm doing is good and it's for all of us."</li>
<li>"Struggling with the guilt of studying during my only free time btw work family instead of being with my family ..."</li>
<li>"Spending time with my family and feeling guilty that I should be studying."</li>
<p>Alleviating achievement guilt</p>
<a>expressive writing</a> can help to subdue those emotions. At Persistence Plus, we’ve delivered this writing intervention via text message, and the stories we hear about how students support their families while continuing their
<a>education</a> are nothing short of remarkable:
<div> <h2>Guilt Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Stop Letting Your Adult Child Guilt You</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>When Guilt Is Dished Out at Family Gatherings</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<li>"I was in high school and one of my parents was not working. They needed help financially, thus I knew I wanted to help alleviate some of the stress. I was able to get a part time job and help them out until they both were working."</li>
<li>"My mother lost her job my dad was barely making ends meet and I had just started my job at 16, I helped them pay bills and their car until they were able to get back on their feet."</li>
<li>"When my brother enrolled in the Navy, my mom was very upset about him moving far away. I was able to comfort her, listen to her feelings, and remind her that … this is a good opportunity for my brother."</li>
<p><a>Parenthood</a> as a resource</p>
<p>Parents’ conversations with Persistence Plus often reveal how central their children are to their reasons for attending college:</p>
<li>"You're doing this for you!! You're doing this for the kids!! You're doing this for a better life!! So ... do it, and do it well!!!"</li>
<li>"You are doing this for your kids to provide them with a better life. Stay focused."</li>
<li>"My 2 kids! They are my cheer squad and my <a>motivation</a> to complete the degree!!"</li>

<p>When I arrived as a freshman at Albion College in the summer of ‘02, I remember being inundated with advice about how to survive this new environment:</p>
<p>If you’re confused in class, go to your professor’s or TA’s office hours (dutifully followed).</p>
<p>Be selective about going out to eat with friends or your money will run out quickly (probably adhered to this one too much).</p>
<p>Visit the Writing Center before turning in every one of your papers (regretfully ignored).</p>
<p>Never jaywalk on Michigan Ave or You Will get a ticket (very true).</p>
<p>Giving Advice Is Motivational</p>
<p>“Do not pay with a credit card if you do not have to.”</p>
<p>“Take a slow deep breath in and out….Go for a walk outside to get fresh air.”</p>

<h1> A Culture of Caring for Faculty and Staff </h1>
<h2> Colleges need the tools to support the mental health of everyone on campus. </h2>

<a>Persistence Plus</a> have collaborated with to increase students’ awareness of campus mental health resources and destigmatize seeking help from those services.
<a>depression and anxiety on the rise</a>, and an increasing need for
<a>colleges to provide mental health resources</a> to ensure their students’ success, there couldn’t be a more immediate need for the
<a>wisdom</a> and strategies shared during these conferences.
<p>Unfortunately, Dave’s story is becoming all too familiar on college campuses:</p>
<li>Dr. Alan Krueger, professor of political economy at Princeton, March 2019</li>
<li>Dr. Gregory Eells, Director of Counseling and Psychological Services at Penn, September 2019</li>
<li>Dr. Katherine McWain, professor of English at Texas Women’s University, September 2019</li>
<li>Nathan Westbrook, lecturer in psychology at Cal State Fullerton, October 2019</li>
<a>over a third of Ph.D. students had sought help for anxiety or depression</a>. And their challenges will surely persist:
<a>a free resource guide</a> in which they provide strategies for creating a “culture of access…that considers disability a source of knowledge and diversity, and that encourages collective accountability and cooperative action.”
<a>Mental Health First Aid</a> teach individuals how to respond to mental health and
<a>addiction</a> challenges, lessons that can be applied to students and colleagues alike (many thanks to Christine Mangino and Cara Crowley for informing me about these programs). Services like
<a>suicidal</a> thoughts or ideations, please reach out to someone you know or text HOME to 741741. If you would like to make a donation to support mental health research in honor of Dave or anyone you’ve lost to suicide, please visit

<p>“I don’t know very many other universities where you can jump into research your second month in school, and because I had two years under my belt, I was able to go do an internship in Italy.”</p>
<p>Videos like this one are meant, in part, to create aspirations among students. Their intended message is “This is the kind of person you can become at [insert university name here].” But does this kind of messaging work?</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that using exemplary students as aspirational targets may backfire due to a process called discouragement by peer excellence.</p>

<a>Happiness</a>, identified perhaps the most powerful and reliable nudge: changing the default. People are more likely to save for
<p>Defaults are so powerful because they influence behavior through at least four unique channels:</p>
<li>Defaults make it easier to choose a particular option by no longer requiring any action (known as reducing friction).</li>
<li>When people are inattentive, defaults direct them toward a particular option.</li>
<li>When people are unsure of what to do, defaults suggest a normative option.</li>
<li>When defaults suggest a normative option, it activates people’s inherent desire to <a>conform</a> or fit in.</li>
<p>Researchers have long questioned, however, whether defaults could affect arenas in which people have strong opinions, like food choices. Two recent studies demonstrate that what we decide to eat is not as intrinsic as we might believe.</p>
