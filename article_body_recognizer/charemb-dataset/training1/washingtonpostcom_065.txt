<div><p>The Jan. 6 siege of the U.S. Capitol was neither a spontaneous act nor an isolated event</p></div>
<a>said 140 police officers,</a> including Capitol officers and members of the D.C. police department, were victimized during the attack.
<div><div><p>The office said about 10 individuals were charged with assaulting members of the media or destroying their equipment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some 640 people were charged with entering a restricted federal building or its grounds. And another 75 were charged with entering a restricted area with a deadly weapon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors in the office have been working with the FBI as well as prosecutors in various locations around the nation. The office said the individuals arrested come from nearly all 50 states.</p></div></div>
<a>Ashli Babbitt</a> of California, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as she tried to breach a set of doors deep in the Capitol during the riot. Federal prosecutors later cleared the officer of any wrongdoing in Babbitt’s death.

<div><div><p>According to a May estimate by the Architect of the Capitol, the attack caused about $1.5 million worth of damage to the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About 165 individuals, the office said, have pleaded guilty to a variety of federal charges, from misdemeanors to felony obstruction.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So far, 70 defendants have received some kind of sentence from a judge. Of those, 31 people were ordered jailed, and 18 were sentenced to home detention. The remaining 21 defendants were placed on probation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In early December, <a>Robert Scott Palmer, 54, </a>of Largo, Fla., received the longest prison sentence to date among those convicted in the attack. A U.S. District Court judge sentenced him to more than five years in prison.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A growing chorus of public officials, former military leaders and others has suggested Trump may have committed a crime by encouraging the rioters or pushing efforts to overturn the results of the election.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Whenever Betty White was asked if she was afraid of dying, the legendary comic actress pointed to the teachings of her mother and the comfort she had in finding out “the secret.”</p></div></div>
<a>People </a>magazine before she passed.
<div><div><p>“Even though Betty was about to be 100, I thought she would live forever,” Witjas said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Betty White, one of the most endearing and enduring faces on television, dies at 99</p></div>
<a>a cultural icon</a>.” Amid the New Year’s Eve celebrations, CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Bravo’s Andy Cohen drank
<a>shots of tequila</a> in Times Square in her honor.
<div><div><p>“Please let this be a hoax,” one fan tweeted.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Live with it’: Betty White defied racist demands in 1954</p></div>
<b> </b>was dying, a topic, she wrote, that was handled gracefully by her parents. The way her parents first handled the loss of White’s pet made the death of her grandmother “a little easier to comprehend,” she wrote in “
<a>Betty White in Person</a>.”
<i>how</i>, not the when of it,” she wrote. “Getting there is not half the fun, and the fear of doing it badly could be of concern if I wanted to waste time thinking about it. I don’t.”
<div><div><p>She added: “I figure I will improvise when the time comes … some things are better without rehearsal.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>In a 2012 interview with
<a>the Guardian</a>, White was asked about an Internet rumor a couple of years
<b> </b>earlier that she had died. She urged fans not to believe everything they see online and brushed off the rumor in her comedic way.
<div><div><p>“Tell them that at 90 there’s no need to get impatient,” she told the outlet. “I’m hurrying as best as I can.”</p></div></div>
<a>Times event</a> if she felt anything was difficult about getting older, she smiled and assured the crowd she felt no dread about what awaited her at the end of life.
<div><div><p>“I’m happy as a lark to stay around as long as I can,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>White told <a>King </a>in 2014 that she had grown even more curious as she got older about what awaited her when she died.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What if it’s nothing?” asked King, who <a>died </a>in 2021 at 87.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I won’t know that,” she replied. “It’s a win-win situation.”</p></div></div>
<a>viral death hoax</a>. In 2014, the satirical website Empire News ran a fake story with the headline, “
<div><div><p>“Betty White is not dead — and if she had a dollar for every time someone falsely tweeted that she was, she’d be a wealthy even wealthier woman by now,” <a>wrote </a>reporter Caitlin Dewey.</p></div></div>
<a>Help protect Betty White from 2016</a>.” The fundraiser raised more than $9,000, not for White’s protection but for a theater in Spartanburg, S.C.
<div><div><p>“They spoil me rotten,” she told Couric. “Really, it’s terrible, and I enjoy every minute of it and make the most of it.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>As the news of her death broke before the new year, fans on social media thanked White for being a friend. She had told People before her death that she was “so lucky to be in such good health and feel so good at this age.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I wish this was a hoax, but unfortunately it’s not,” one fan <a>tweeted</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Despite all the questions she would be asked about death throughout her life, White emphasized in her autobiography decades earlier that she “enjoyed exploring a path I rarely travel, and have no idea where it leads.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ll be dying to find out,” she wrote.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Claire Parker</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 1:49 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>In France, advertisements urging people to buy the latest Peugeots or Renaults will soon come with a caveat urging viewers or listeners to walk or bike instead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Under a new regulation slated to take effect in March, French automakers will be required to include messages on car advertisements that encourage viewers to seek more environmentally friendly travel alternatives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The requirement is to apply to ads distributed on radio, television, in theaters, on the Internet and on big screens as well as to print ads. If advertisers fail to include the message, they can be fined up to about $56,000.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Similar measures are already in place in France for food advertisements, which instruct French consumers to cut back on junk food and eat more fruits and vegetables.</p></div></div>
<a>French newspaper Le Monde reported</a>. Ads for the highest-polluting vehicles will be banned beginning in 2028.
<div><div><p>Transportation-related emissions <a>make up a quarter</a> of the European Union’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to the European Environment Agency.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Carmakers aired mixed reactions in French media to the upcoming advertising requirements. Volkswagen <a>told French media</a> it would follow the regulations, as did Hyundai’s French division.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am taking note, we will adapt,” Lionel French Keogh, chief executive of Hyundai in France, told Agence France-Presse. “Zero-emission transportation is the future.”</p></div></div>
<p>But he complained that the measure “stigmatized the automobile” and was “a bit counterproductive” since it does not distinguish between types of cars, even as the government tries to incentivize the use of electric vehicles.</p>
<div><div><p>Major automakers Renault and Stellantis, which sells the Peugeot brand, and U.S. carmaker Ford, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h4><div>Experts are warning of rampant climate misinformation online</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>One year after a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol, experts are sounding the alarm about a new threat not only to democracy, but to the planet: The spread of misinformation about climate change online.</p></div>

<a>climate misinformation can cancel out accurate information</a>.
<div><div><p>“I think there's a misconception that climate misinformation is not as dangerous as covid or election misinformation,” he said. “But it's an existential threat.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Twitter and Facebook's approaches</div></h5></div></div>

<div><div><p>Reached by phone yesterday, Milloy said he thinks that Twitter and other social media companies have no business fact-checking users' posts about climate change.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am totally opposed to Big Tech censoring people from discussing issues,” Milloy told The Climate 202. “If people can show I'm wrong, they should shame me off Twitter.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Busby did not respond to a follow-up question about Milloy.</p></div></div>
