<p>Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Gently add the eggs; cover and cook for 6 minutes (it’s best to set a timer). </p>
<p>Once the time’s up, use a slotted spoon to transfer the eggs to a colander and rinse them under cool tap water to stop them from cooking. Tap the eggs on a work surface and peel them.</p>
<p>Divide the cooked grains among individual bowls. Evenly divide the avocado and kimchi among them, then place one egg on each portion. Break it open or allow your guests to break their own.</p>
<p>Whisk together the juice from the kimchi jar and the mayonnaise in a small bowl. Season lightly with salt. Drizzle over the bowls and sprinkle each one with some cilantro. Serve right away.</p>

<p><b>Active time:</b> 30 mins</p>
<p>Storage Notes: The leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. If you do not plan to eat this all at once, you can store the pork separately and reheat it before serving it over the cold noodles.</p>
<p>Where to Buy: Sweet chili sauce and fish sauce can be found in well-stocked supermarkets or Asian markets. </p>
<select> <option> 2 - 3 </option> <option> 4 - 6 </option> <option> 8 - 12 </option> <option> 12 - 18 </option> </select>
<div> <p>When you scale a recipe, keep in mind that cooking times and temperatures, pan sizes and seasonings may be affected, so adjust accordingly. Also, amounts listed in the directions will not reflect the changes made to ingredient amounts.</p> </div>
<p>Tested size: 4-6 servings; makes about 10 cups</p>
<li><div>1/4 cup sweet chili sauce, such as Ka-Me brand</div></li>
<li><div>3 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 1 lime)</div></li>
<li><div>2 1/2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce, plus more as needed</div></li>
<li><div>1 1/2 tablespoons fish sauce, plus more as needed</div></li>
<li><div>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</div></li>
<li>For the pork and noodles</li>
<li><div>9 ounces soba noodles (see NOTES)</div></li>
<li><div>4 boneless pork chops (about 5 to 6 ounces each) (see NOTES)</div></li>
<li><div>Finely ground black pepper</div></li>
<li><div>1 tablespoon neutral oil, such as canola</div></li>
<li><div>4 scallions, sliced</div></li>
<li><div>1/2 cucumber (about 7 ounces), cut into matchsticks or bite-size pieces</div></li>
<li><div>1 red, yellow or orange bell pepper (about 4 ounces), cut into matchsticks or bite-size pieces</div></li>
<li><div>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh cilantro leaves, plus whole leaves for serving</div></li>
<li><div>1/4 cup coarsely chopped fresh mint leaves, plus whole leaves for serving</div></li>
<li><div>1/2 cup (about 2 1/2 ounces) salted peanuts, roughly chopped</div></li>
<li><div>1 lime, quartered</div></li>
<p>Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the chili sauce, lime, soy sauce, fish sauce and crushed red pepper. Taste, and season with a little more soy or fish sauce, if needed.</p>
<p>Add the scallions, cucumber, bell pepper and the chopped cilantro and mint to the noodles and toss with the remaining dressing to combine.</p>
<p>Thinly slice the pork against the grain and arrange the meat on top of the noodles. Drizzle any juices or dressing from the plate onto the dish as well. </p>
<p>Scatter the peanuts and a few cilantro and mint leaves on top, tuck the lime wedges onto the side of the dish, and serve family-style.</p>
<p>Remove the pork chops from the refrigerator 20 to 30 minutes before cooking to take the chill off the meat. This will allow them to cook more quickly and evenly.</p>
<p>If you don’t have soba noodles, try another thin noodle, such as 7 ounces of instant vermicelli rice noodles or 1 pound of angel hair pasta.</p>
