<div><h1>Millions plan to travel for Christmas, New Year’s as omicron spreads</h1></div>
<h2>So far, the variant isn’t expected to significantly dampen holiday travel, as pandemic fatigue and confidence in vaccines remain strong, experts say.</h2>

<div><p>A few weeks after millions of Americans traveled for Thanksgiving, the omicron variant is emerging as many more people begin to set out for Christmas and New Year’s, worrying public health officials and complicating travel plans.</p></div>
<p>The end-of-year rush — typically the busiest holiday travel period of the year — will occur as researchers scramble to fully understand the new coronavirus variant’s transmissibility, severity and defenses against vaccines.</p>
<div><p>But travel watchers say they expect confidence in vaccines and booster shots, coupled with mounting pandemic fatigue after almost two years, will keep millions traveling over the winter holidays despite the increased uncertainty.</p></div>
<a>public risk perception and behavior</a> during the pandemic, said early reports of the variant appearing to be more transmissible but less dangerous probably will leave most holiday travel plans intact.
<div><div><p>With many travel plans still a week away, and medical research findings emerging daily, Chauhan and other experts say it’s difficult to forecast the variant’s effects on pent-up demand for holiday travel.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Americans are eager for air travel this holiday season, but is the industry ready for them?</p></div>
<div><p>Airline industry passes holiday travel test during Thanksgiving surge</p></div>
<div><div><p>A <a>more recent Axios/Ipsos poll</a> that ended Dec. 13 found a growing sense of unease, with 68 percent saying they believed air travel would pose a large or moderate health risk — a 10-percent jump from early November.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Abhinav Sharma, a Florida State University assistant hospitality professor studying travel decision-making during the pandemic, said he doesn’t expect omicron to cause more than a “mild to moderate blip.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve become more experienced as a society in coming to grips with variant-related news,” Sharma said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Poll: Most Americans, regardless of party, are worn out by pandemic changes</p></div>
<div><div><p>Travelers also have gained more confidence in their ability to reduce their risks, experts say.</p></div></div>
<p>Potomac resident Nora Yang recently rebooked a business trip to France after canceling it because of omicron. Yang, who is fully vaccinated with a booster shot, said she changed her mind after early reports of it causing milder infections.</p>
<div><p>“We reevaluated the situation,” said Yang, 59, a biotech executive. “Nothing is 100 percent safe, but [the business meeting] is a small group of executives, and we’re all going to get tested before.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ll be careful,” Yang said. “I feel like I know how to protect myself.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Travel plans that involve visits with older and medically vulnerable relatives entail a different risk calculation — one that public health experts say still warrants extra caution.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Omicron, spreading rapidly in U.S., could bring punishing wave by January, CDC warns</p></div>
<div><div><p>Mahmood Khan, a professor and director in the Department of Hospitality and Tourism Management at Virginia Tech’s Arlington campus, said people have grown more comfortable traveling as the pandemic has worn on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Many travelers are used to mask-wearing and keeping a safe distance,” Khan said. “Travelers are much more attuned to how to face this kind of situation.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hotel industry leaders say they believe high gas prices, more than the omicron variant, might keep some holiday travelers home, while some airline executives said they believe any effect from omicron will be short-lived.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“If the return in demand is delayed, so be it,” said Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines. “That’s a short-term issue. It’s not a long-term issue. That’s how we view omicron.”</p></div>
<div><p>Taxpayers spent billions to bail out airlines. Did the industry hold up its end of the deal?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Transportation Security Administrator David Pekoske said the agency expects airport crowds to approach pre-pandemic levels, as they did over Thanksgiving.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are seeing a pretty robust recovery,” Pekoske said at a news conference this week.</p></div></div>
<p>For some, flying still feels too risky. District resident Saba Ahmed, 37, said she and her husband will skip another holiday visit with family in California because they don’t plan to fly until their 3-year-old son can get vaccinated.</p>
<div><div><p>“People are feeling less worried,” Chauhan said. “They feel the risk is lower. People are getting more relaxed.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>FAQ: 9 questions about the omicron variant and travel, answered</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re more comfortable with family than in huge gatherings where we don’t know how people have been behaving,” Nicolau said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How omicron is changing the rules of the Covid-19 pandemic</p></div>
<div><div><p>At the same time, visiting far-flung family members increases the sense of benefit, and people have learned they can lower their risk by visiting outside or taking home coronavirus tests before gathering, Hammitt said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Guido Adelfio, owner of Bethesda Travel Center, said none of his clients with European holiday trips have canceled, even as the omicron variant takes hold there.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The “great deal of worry” he does hear from customers, he said, is more about being inconvenienced by potential government restrictions, such as finding restaurants at their destinations closed. All are vaccinated, he said.</p></div>
<div><p>Omicron is upending the holidays for international travelers</p></div>

<div><h1>BWI executive director says airport on a path to recovery amid pandemic</h1></div>
<h2>Passengers are returning to the region’s busiest airport, which is expanding and adding services to make travel easier</h2>

<p>A previous version of this article incorrectly credited the photo of Ricky Smith to the Maryland Aviation Authority. It should have been credited to the Maryland Aviation Administration. The article has been corrected.</p>
<div><div><p><b>Q: How are things at BWI? We’re still in the pandemic, but how has the recovery been?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: Can you talk about how the BWI experience has changed during the pandemic?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: Where are you in terms of your recovery? Do you know when you might get back to 2019 levels?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: Do you think maybe 2022 could be the year you fully recover?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: When did things start to turn around?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: How much of your traffic is leisure versus business?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A: It’s about 60 percent leisure, 40 percent business, under normal conditions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: As you mentioned, the holidays are coming up. It’s been a while since some people may have traveled, so this may be their first time. What should people expect?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A: If they have the time they may want to come a little earlier than two hours because you will have people traveling that haven’t traveled in a while, and that only adds to some inefficiencies.</p></div></div>
<div><p>With lower fares and more amenities, BWI lures D.C. region’s travelers</p></div>
<div><div><p>Parking can be an issue because our parking facility began to fill up pretty quickly. And so that’s part of the reason you should arrive as early as possible just to make sure that you are able to make adjustments.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: The Board of Public Works recently approved a contract to improve restrooms at the airport. People might giggle about that, but can you tell us what projects like this mean for the customer experience?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: When was the last time those restrooms had a makeover?</b></p></div></div>
<b> </b>imagine a restroom that was designed to accommodate passenger traffic 20 years ago? It certainly cannot meet the same demand, and so we’ve got to expand.
<div><div><p><b>Q: I understand that BWI now has a new urgent-care clinic on-site?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: Can you talk about some of the projects happening at BWI, including the expanded Concourse A that opened in May and the Concourse A and B connector project?</b></p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Even as flight disruptions eased slightly Wednesday, airlines warned that cancellations and delays could continue as they struggle to rebound from coronavirus-related staffing shortages and wintry weather.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The modest decline in Wednesday’s cancellations, however, may provide little solace to travelers nearly a week into a holiday meltdown that has resulted in the cancellation of more than 6,400 flights.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Low-cost carrier Allegiant Air canceled 41 flights Wednesday, according to FlightAware, about 9 percent of its schedule. Spokeswoman Hilarie Grey said more cancellations were likely, blaming a mix of bad weather and coronavirus cases.</p></div>

<div><div><p>Delta said it expected to cancel about 250 of more than 4,000 Delta and Delta Connection flights Thursday. The airline said cancellations will probably continue through the weekend with 200 to 300 daily cancellations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Delta people are continuing to work together around the clock to reroute and substitute aircraft and crews to get customers where they need to be as quickly and safely as possible,” the airline said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<p>Delta issued travel waivers for customers whose itineraries include Chicago, Detroit, Salt Lake City and Seattle — where storms are expected to complicate travel — and urged travelers whose plans include those cities to reschedule.</p>
<p>Kerry Tan, an associate professor of economics and an air travel expert at Maryland’s Loyola University, said that while weather is often a factor at this time of year, staffing issues have proved to be a greater challenge for carriers.</p>
<div><p>“The weather aspect is out of their hands,” Tan said. “What they can control is staffing, but like many companies out there, there are huge staffing issues. There are just not enough workers to meet the demand.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Outside of the period following the Sept. 11 attacks, few in the industry could recall a time when so many flights had been affected for such a long duration.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s the perfect storm,” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, which represents crews at American Airlines.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harteveldt noted that disruptions are not unique to the United States. According to FlightAware, more than 2,800 flights worldwide were canceled Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re seeing airlines affected in Europe, Africa, Asia and elsewhere, so this is truly a global airline industry challenge,” he said.</p></div></div>

<p>A light glaze of ice was all it took to turn roadways into ice rinks Wednesday morning across parts of the New York City Tri-State area and New England, bringing numerous car accidents and treacherous travel that snarled the morning commute.</p>
<div><div><p>Traffic on lengthy stretches of Interstates 95 and 84 slowed to a crawl, with dozens of accidents and spinouts reported in a travel scene reminiscent of what transpired two days earlier in the Mid-Atlantic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A stretch of Interstate 84 between approximately Waterbury and Danville, Conn., was shut down because of the dangerous conditions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A 19-vehicle pileup was reported on the Passyunk Avenue Bridge in Southwest Philadelphia, which involved at least two buses, including a school bus. No students were onboard at the time.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Justin George</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 6:39 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>When word began to travel up the aisles that toilets on their long-stalled Amtrak train were stopped up, Malcolm Kenton and his aunt took their lone opportunity to disembark in Lynchburg, Va., still hundreds of miles from their homes.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We didn’t want to risk staying on a train with no food and no toilets,” said Kenton, 36, who lives near Union Station in D.C.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Passengers such as Kenton said Amtrak was unprepared and provided them with little direction or information about the delays.</p></div></div>
<p>Amtrak spokeswoman Kimberly Woods said delays were caused by downed trees from winter weather. A service alert sent out Wednesday said customers whose trips have been changed are being accommodated on other trains and change fees are being waived.</p>
<div><div><p>They won’t soon forget their ordeal, especially standing in a long line at the cafe and buying up what food they could just before the train ran out, leaving many passengers hungry.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Amtrak cancels trains because of weather, coronavirus cases among workers</p></div>
<div><p>Drivers were stuck on I-95 when one saw a bakery truck. Soon, stranded motorists were breaking bread together.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Eventually we just sort of let whatever was going to happen, happen,” Anna, 30, said. “We tried to keep the peace as much as we could because we had neighbors.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Timeline: How a winter storm brought I-95 to a standstill</p></div>
<div><div><p>Kip said he paid $1,700 for the trip, money he wants refunded. He has tried to call Amtrak customer service 54 times, to no avail, he said just a few hours after the family had arrived back home.</p></div></div>
<p>The delay on the Auto Train line extended well into Wednesday. A train that left Lorton on Tuesday arrived at Sanford at about 1:30 p.m., four-and-a-half hours late, said passenger Hampden H. Smith III., a snowbird who lives in Lexington, Va.</p>
<div><div><p>All around the station parking lot in Sanford were cars waiting to be loaded for the return trip back north to Virginia.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There were hundreds of cars all over the place waiting to be loaded,” Smith said in an email. “At this rate it will take 4 more days to clear out the delays caused by Monday’s storm.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Matthew Cappucci</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Emily Schwing</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 28, 2021|Updated December 28, 2021 at 4:17 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Matthew Cappucci</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Emily Schwing</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 28, 2021|Updated December 28, 2021 at 4:17 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Imagine running a 5K and winning the race by 10 minutes. That’s analogous to what is transpiring in Alaska at the moment. An exceptional slew of records has tumbled in the wake of extreme warmth, with highs up to 45 degrees above average.</p>
<div><div><p>The anomalous warmth has also brought record moisture, with top-tier rainfall totals thanks to the air’s capacity to transport more humidity.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Historic U.S. weather events in 2021, by the numbers</p></div>
<div><div><p>This latest bout of record-shattering warmth caps off a year that has brought a number of high-end climate extremes to North America, including a withering late <a>June heat wave</a> that heated Seattle up to 108 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Record warmth</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Sunday, the <a>Kodiak tide gauge station</a> hit 67 degrees at 2:17 p.m. In addition to being a local record, it set a monthly record for the entire state for December.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nearby, Kodiak Airport recorded 65 degrees and beat its previous daily record by 20 degrees, surpassing the 45-degree record reading last set on Dec. 26, 1984, by leaps and bounds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sunday also brought records in Cold Bay, Alaska, where the community hit a high of 62 degrees. The previous record, set in 1990, was 44. St. Paul tied its record at 42 degrees.</p></div></div>
<a>According to Rick Thoman</a>, an Alaska-based climatologist, that morning low was warmer than the average low at any point in the year — even the heart of summer.
<div><div><h3><div>Record rain</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>For every degree the air warms, it can hold about 4 percent more water. That is also lending to high-end rainfall extremes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fairbanks saw its wettest December on record, too. The city, which has seen a substantial uptick in development and boom in population, has experienced about nine degrees of warming during December since record-keeping began.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Arctic could become dominated by rain rather than snow</p></div>
<div><div><p>Winter rain in the Interior region of Alaska is becoming increasingly commonplace, but that doesn’t mean it’s welcome.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’d rather have coal,” Brue Miller wrote on social media, a day after Christmas.</p></div></div>
<p>The largest electric utility in the Interior region, Golden Valley Electric Association, reported widespread outages affecting more than 13,000 homes in the Fairbanks area on Sunday. By Tuesday, roughly 2,000 customers were still without power.</p>
<div><p>Winter is the fastest warming season in the United States</p></div>
<div><div><p>With temperatures forecast to dip to 30 degrees below zero by the end of the week, the race is on for the utility to restore power so that residents can reheat their homes and keep their pipes from freezing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nome, on the Seward Peninsula, picked up 0.43 inches of rain on Sunday, which was also a daily record.</p></div></div>
<a>dumped nearly 30 inches of rain on the Portage Glacier </a>in late October and early November. The historic storm yielded one of the heaviest four-day rainfall totals observed in the state.

<div><div><p>On Monday, the jet stream was oriented west-southwest to east-northeast, reaching speeds of close to 200 mph at 34,000 feet. That’s the altitude at which many commercial jet airliners fly.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>For those going against the jet stream, it has been a fiasco. JetBlue Flight 1387 took 6 hours 59 minutes to go from Boston to LAX, and a number of flights have seen their progress slowed to below 450 mph over the ground.</p></div></div>

<div><p>December tornado record crushed by historic onslaught of storms in U.S.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Severe storms strike Alabama and Georgia</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, the National Weather Service reported a possible brief tornado in Bainbridge, Ga., on Wednesday afternoon. The service will <a>survey damage</a> from the event Thursday, potentially reporting details that afternoon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Isolated severe weather Thursday</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The remnants of Wednesday’s weather were trailing along a stalled boundary Thursday morning, leaving a strip of heavy rain that had prompted a flash flood warning in Atlanta. A few heavier thunderstorm cores also were embedded within the line.</p>
<div><div><p>That boundary won’t move much, wobbling back and forth as it is steered by opposing features — rain-cooled air wants to surge it south, while warm southwesterly winds jutting against it aim to shove it back north.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Next round of storms Friday into Saturday</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>All told, a risk of damaging winds and a couple of tornadoes will exist, but pinpointing any specific areas that have a greater threat is impossible at present.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Storms may move into the Southeastern United States in a weakened state on Sunday ahead of a strong cold front that will cause temperatures to crash 20 degrees or more.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>North of the severe weather zone will stretch a corridor susceptible to scattered or widespread flash flooding and excessive rainfall. Flooding is typically deadlier than tornadoes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We begin 2022 ominously,” wrote the Weather Service office in Huntsville.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the cold side of the system, accumulating snowfall is likely to plaster cities such as Denver, Kansas City and Chicago.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The setup</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The severe storm forecast</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Storms will shift into the Southeast on Sunday, posing a marginal risk for severe weather.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A ‘conditional’ tornado threat</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>There also isn’t a robust trigger to generate supercells ahead of the main squall line, making predicting if and where they’ll form extra difficult.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Heavy rain</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Areas from eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas all the way to the panhandle of Maryland are included in flash flood and flood watches, with rainfall amounts of 2 to 3 inches likely in the next 24 to 36 hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Those living in areas prone to flooding should be prepared to take action should flooding develop,” wrote the National Weather Service.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Winter wallop on the backside</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Temperatures will crash 30 degrees or more behind the front as a blast of cool air spills south and east from Canada. On the backside of low pressure, that’s translating to a full-fledged winter storm.</p></div></div>

<p>A light glaze of ice was all it took to turn roadways into ice rinks Wednesday morning across parts of the New York City Tri-State area and New England, bringing numerous car accidents and treacherous travel that snarled the morning commute.</p>
<div><div><p>Traffic on lengthy stretches of Interstates 95 and 84 slowed to a crawl, with dozens of accidents and spinouts reported in a travel scene reminiscent of what transpired two days earlier in the Mid-Atlantic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A stretch of Interstate 84 between approximately Waterbury and Danville, Conn., was shut down because of the dangerous conditions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A 19-vehicle pileup was reported on the Passyunk Avenue Bridge in Southwest Philadelphia, which involved at least two buses, including a school bus. No students were onboard at the time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The greatest density of incidents was concentrated around Hartford, where there were virtually too many accidents to list.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Were officials unprepared?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Department of Transportation again denied culpability, tweeting that wind made pretreatment possible. Hanrahan noted that winds were largely calm overnight, with numerous observations of 0 mph.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Matthew Cappucci</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 11:48 a.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Meteorologists are tracking a new snowstorm that could deposit a burst of moderate to heavy snow. While totals will be modest and a blockbuster snowstorm is unlikely, the rapidity with which the snow falls will pose a challenge in some areas.</p>
<div><p>D.C.-area forecast: A burst of snow tonight then a blast of cold Friday</p></div>
<div><div><p>The National Weather Service in New York warned of an imminent “significant disruption” to the Friday morning commute.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The setup</div></h3></div></div>
<a>frontogenesis</a> — essentially the formation of a cold front in the middle levels of the atmosphere.
<div><p>Long Island, Rhode Island and Southeastern Massachusetts will probably see a few hours of heavy snow, with the Cape and Islands under the heaviest band for at least three or four hours while it pivots offshore on Friday afternoon.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Timing</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Interstate 68 corridor in the Panhandle of Maryland could see snow as early as 8 p.m. Thursday. The snow will reach the D.C. to Baltimore stretch shortly after midnight.</p></div></div>
<p>Philadelphia should see snow around 2 or 3 a.m. Friday, reaching New York City and overspreading the Long Island Expressway around 5 a.m. From there it expands into southern New England, the heaviest coinciding with the time of the morning commute.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Totals</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The storm will continue out to sea over the weekend, explosively intensifying southeast of Greenland with an air pressure rivaling that of Hurricane Sandy in 2012.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Novak Djokovic is desperate to be taken seriously. Now he’s becoming a punchline.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 10:42 a.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 4:19 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Novak Djokovic is the No. 1 men’s tennis player in the world and may end up the greatest male player of all time. There are some who think he’s already there.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a>, and Antonio Brown
<a>took it a step further</a> when he submitted a fake vaccination card.
<div><div><p>But neither of them were detained by border officials in Australia and <a>held in a hotel</a> as a court weighs deportation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like Rodgers and Brown, Djokovic <a>got himself into an embarrassing mess</a> because he thought he was above the rules of covid decency and refused to get a vaccination that most people understand they need.</p></div></div>
<a>had announced Djokovic was being granted a medical exemption,</a> allowing him to compete in the tournament even though he is apparently unvaccinated.
<div><p>Nadal says Djokovic knew the risks in Australia: ‘If you are vaccinated, you can play’</p></div>
<a>still recovering from knee surgery</a>. Whether he will play again — much less contend for another major title — is in doubt. Nadal is 35 and will play in Australia, but Djokovic
<a>beat him in Paris last spring</a>, an almost unthinkable upset given that Nadal has won the French Open 13 times.
<a>at Wimbledon</a> and came within a whisker of being the third man in history to win a calendar Grand Slam when he reached the U.S. Open final,
<a>only to lose to Daniil Medvedev</a>.
<div><div><p>Still, it felt as if the ­34-year-old’s coronation was little more than a formality, especially with Australia — his “home court” — next up. But Djokovic found a way to mess it up.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>NEW YORK — Over the past decade, Novak Djokovic has set about transforming himself into an athlete with virtually no tactical, physical or psychological weakness.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His endgame was audacious: to not only insert himself into the two-way conversation of tennis greatness being waged by Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal but to stake his claim as the greatest man ever to play the game.</p></div></div>
<p>With Medvedev’s victory, achieved in a ruthlessly efficient 2 hours 15 minutes before a capacity crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium that had come to witness history, the debate over the greatest man to play the game will no doubt continue.</p>
<div><div><p>Gracious in victory, Medvedev offered his opinion during his post-match remarks. Speaking directly to Djokovic, he said, “To me, you are the greatest tennis player in history.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Perspective: Novak Djokovic was after tennis history. Then he collided with the sport’s future.</p></div>
<div><div><p>With neither Federer, 40, nor Nadal, 35, competing at the U.S. Open, Djokovic’s final hurdle was second-ranked Medvedev — a 25-year-old, lean, lanky 6-foot-6 Russian with a massive serve and forehand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Medvedev came out blazing, strafing the court with forehand blasts and a barrage of aces. He broke Djokovic’s serve in the opening game and never eased off.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Russian waged an all-out attack at lightning tempo, pummeling the top-ranked Djokovic, who seemed uncharacteristically tentative and a step slow at the outset, as if he were a dazed prizefighter on the ropes.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Less than seven months earlier, Djokovic had routed Medvedev in straight sets to claim the Australian Open title and his 18th major, setting in motion this quest for the Grand Slam. That victory in Melbourne took less than two hours.</p></div>
<div><p>From qualifier to champ, Emma Raducanu tops fellow teen Leylah Fernandez in U.S. Open final</p></div>
<div><div><p>Medvedev blasted 16 aces and fended off five of six break points against the game’s best returner.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He set the no-mercy tone at the outset, closing the first set in 36 minutes. The second set flew by much the same, with Djokovic’s frustration mounting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In short order, Djokovic was two sets in arrears.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But his ability to fight back wasn’t there against Medvedev, who scarcely gave Djokovic a chance to breathe as he blasted ball after ball past him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Medvedev’s only hiccup came when he twice served for the match and double-faulted both times. For Djokovic, the reprieve was brief. Upon clinching the victory, Medvedev fell on his side on the court.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the two shared an embrace at the net, Djokovic retreated to his courtside chair, buried his head under a towel and wept.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In the end, it wasn’t hubris that felled Djokovic. Physical and mental fatigue did it — not to a debilitating extent but just enough to leave him a step slow, which represented chum in the water to the attack-minded Medvedev.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I was just below par with my game,” Djokovic said. “My legs were not there.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then he thanked the New York crowd, which has rooted against him often over the years.</p></div></div>

<p>Though he doesn’t appear to have much fight left at this point, Djokovic won at least one game in the third set while Medvedev continues his all-out rampage. It looks as though the 20-time Grand Slam trophy winner has nearly run out of gas.</p>
