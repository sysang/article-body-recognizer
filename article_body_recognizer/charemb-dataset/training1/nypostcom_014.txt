<h1> Big movies were back at the 2021 Toronto Film Fest, but not big crowds</h1>
<div> September 16, 2021 3:39pm <div> Updated <div> September 16, 2021 3:39pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>TORONTO — On Tuesday, my second-to-last night at the Toronto International Film Festival, I finally saw them: crowds!</p>
<p>King Street, the fest’s main drag, was teeming with life and exuberant patrons were pouring out of restaurants and bars around the Princess of Wales Theatre.</p>
<p>My dystopian nightmare had ended. I was no longer a shirtless Charlton Heston shouting at the Statue of Liberty on an ape beach. TIFF was back.</p>
<p>Excited to see … humans, I tried to snag a seat at a very full Mexican joint Tuesday to perhaps score some industry gossip. Then the hostess told me, “Don’t worry. The baseball game is almost over.”</p>
<p>Ugh. These schlubs weren’t film buffs — they were Toronto Blue Jays fans. The era of the pandemic festival ain’t over yet, guys, not in Canada anyway.</p>
<p>Few Americans made the trek this year, preferring more free-wheeling Venice. Seating was socially-distanced and patrons were masked. Awfully hard to generate buzz when everyone’s afraid to talk.</p>
<a>Nomadland</a>” on a 27-inch TV in my bedroom. The glamour! Thank God that this year, you could actually see every film in brick-and-mortar theaters with other people and, although the slate was slimmer than the past, many were sensational.
<p>“Dune” also had the rare showbiz party at this year’s TIFF. A hilarious one. Picture it: An Oscar-nominated director and about 30 randos celebrating a $165 million movie by nibbling on manchego.</p>
<a>probes Di’s psychological state</a> rather than present the Wikipedia page on how she got there. 
<p>At the moment, Stewart, doing the best work of her career, is the hands-on favorite to win Best Actress.</p>
<a>gives a meticulous performance</a> that nails every mannerism — that giggle will haunt my dreams for months. Behind it all, however, is a captivating repressed darkness. 
<a>The Humans</a>.” I found that film adaptation of Stephen Karam’s Broadway play to be sublimely acted, but pretentious in style.
<p>I didn’t hate “<a>Dear Evan Hansen</a>.” So sue me.</p>
<p>Next stop on the festival circuit is in our own backyard, the New York Film Festival, starting Friday. It’ll thankfully look a little different than my trip up north. No digital screenings, no capacity restrictions and parties galore. </p>
<p>And, please, no Mets fans.</p>

<div> September 20, 2021 8:23pm <div> Updated <div> September 20, 2021 8:24pm </div> </div> </div>
<h2>Will they cut royal heirs?</h2>
<p>What’s in Prince Andrew’s diary, we don’t yet know. To know what’s in Prince Philip’s will, London Bridge will have to fall down first.</p>
<h2>Pray tell it on-screen</h2>
<p>Comes a Jessica Chastain movie about televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker whose career consisted of being wife and then ex of prisoner Rev. Jim Bakker. Boyohboy, did I know Tammy.</p>
<p>In ’87 she told me she wanted Sally Field to someday play her.</p>
<p>Nervous, and maybe facing jail due to her own faulty arithmetic, she told me — and with her face under congealed cosmetics: People made fun of all my eye makeup but freak is chic. Michael Jackson wore more eye makeup than I did.</p>
<p>And one day: I’m sick of apologizing. Next day: I’m looking for a press agent.”</p>
<p>Forget Who’s Who. When it comes to Tammy Faye, she’s more Who’s Goo. And the new biofilm is entitled “The Eyes of Tammy Faye.”</p>
<a>liked the Emmys</a>. They were that cheese-y. Three of us watched in a friend’s home. Two left midway. The third stayed. The TV was in her home.
<p>At the Majestic Theatre Frank DiLella, NY1’s Emmy-winning theater guy, hosted a Broadway’s Back thing.</p>
<p>So give your regards — and credit cards to Broadway.</p>
<p>And more to come: New York Film Festival. Wednesday, Sept. 29, it’s “The Lost Daughter” directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, starring Dakota Johnson.</p>
<p>Tammy Faye Bakker gives televangelists a bad rap. Besides bringing joy and prosperity to sinners, a main interest is the hereafter. Like Jim Bakker and Tammy Faye who were here after our money.</p>
<p>Only in New York, kids, only in New York.</p>

<h1> Narrow-minded Hollywood has gone overboard on starry female biopics</h1>
<div> November 18, 2021 6:12pm <div> Updated <div> November 18, 2021 7:15pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The 2022 Oscars season is starting to feel like we’re taking a stroll through Madame Tussauds in Times Square.</p>
<p>Oh my God, she’s so lifelike! They’ve captured every line and lash. Her posture is perfect, the hair is just as I remembered it and she’s wearing that iconic dress. They must have done so much research.</p>
<p>Whether I’m talking about a wax figure of Marilyn Monroe or Lady Gaga in “House of Gucci” is anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>But just about every major Best Actress contender next year is acclaimed for playing a real, very famous person in a movie based on history. Yawn!</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, there is nothing more prestigious and impressive than resembling and talking like a famous person. Think of all the poor Elvis impersonators over the years who’ve been cheated out of their rightful Oscars.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that Kidman isn’t a laugh riot, those who’ve seen it say. The film is about Lucy and Desi Arnaz’s crumbling marriage. Not as many yuks there as in the Vitameatavegamin commercial. </p>
<p>But it’s Kristen Stewart who’s the solid front-runner for <a>playing Princess Diana in “Spencer,”</a> kind of like Emma Corrin who won a Golden Globe for playing Princess Diana on “The Crown.” </p>
<p>Jessica Chastain is giving her a run for her sterling by<a> playing rouged-up televangelist Tammy Faye Bakker</a> in “The Eyes of Tammy Faye.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lady Gaga is trying to top her “A Star Is Born” Best Actress loss with her turn as Patrizia Reggiani in “House of Gucci” (she won’t win). </p>
<p>And, oh, the arduous preparation!</p>
<p>How exhausting. These women are like hyped-up high school students trying to outdo each other with extracurricular activities to get into Yale. </p>
<p>Just act. Leave the impressions to “Saturday Night Live.”</p>

<h1> Liza Minnelli shades Renée Zellweger, won’t see ‘Judy’ biopic about her mom</h1>

<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> February 4, 2020 2:34pm <div> Updated <div> February 4, 2020 7:20pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Liza Minnelli has zero interest in seeing “Judy,” the Renée Zellweger-starring biopic about her late mother, legend Judy Garland.</p>
<p>“I do not approve nor sanction the upcoming film about Judy Garland in any way,” <a>wrote Minnelli</a>, whose father was director Vincente Minnelli.</p>
<p>Minnelli isn’t the only family member vowing to avoid “Judy.”</p>
<a>she would not see “Judy,”</a> saying she is “really protective” of her mother’s legacy and career.
<p>“I feel that if you really want to know about my mom, go see her movies, go listen to her recordings and go watch her television shows, and that’s how you’ll know about her,” she told “Great Britain Today.”</p>
<p><a>In an interview with UK talk-show personality Lorraine Kelly</a>, Zellweger, 50, said she was aware that Luft and Minnelli weren’t planning on seeing the film.</p>
<p>Zellweger has already nabbed <a>Golden Globe</a>, <a>BAFTA</a> and <a>Screen Actors Guild</a> awards for her portrayal of Garland and is considered a shoo-in for Best Actress when the Academy Awards take place on Sunday, Feb. 9.</p>
<p>ABC will broadcast the ceremony live from the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, starting at 8 p.m.</p>

<h1> ‘Versailles of Manhattan’ house now half off after 17 years on market</h1>
<div> July 15, 2020 5:39pm </div>
<p>Maybe this time Ken Laub is serious.</p>
<p>An over-the-top Upper East Side townhouse at 163 E. 64th St., casually known as the Versailles of Manhattan, is back on the market for $17.5 million.</p>
<p>He has tried offloading this property since 2003, and real-estate insiders told The Post in 2018 that no other Manhattan townhouse has spent so long on the market. Laub’s true love, however, is music and theater.</p>
<p>He has produced Broadway and off-Broadway plays and counted choreographer and dancer Bob Fosse, Bob Hope, Liza Minnelli and Mayor Ed Koch among his friends.</p>
<p>The home was built in 1872 and designed by architect John Prague. The exterior features limestone and red brick and was designed by those who restored St. John the Divine, the listing notes.</p>
<p>At 8,000 square feet, the 20-foot-wide home comes with six bedrooms, five bathrooms, 3½ bathrooms — and the option of adding an additional floor.</p>
<p>There’s also lots of inlaid marble and wood flooring, carved-wood moldings and paneling, mahogany doors, hand-painted Chinese panels, a staircase and an elevator with mirror panels and painted trompe l’oeil walls.</p>
<p>The second floor has a special sound system for recitals and guest speakers, along with a green marble fireplace, French doors and a 400-pound 18th-century chandelier.</p>
<p>The master bedroom on the fourth floor includes two skylights, automated shades, mahogany cabinets and a woodburning fireplace. There’s also an office and a private terrace, along with a rooftop deck.</p>
<p>The listing brokers are Elizabeth Sample and Brenda Powers of Sotheby’s International Realty.</p>

<h1> ‘Halston’ highlights his iconic bond with Liza — and other daring muses</h1>
<div> May 14, 2021 2:45pm <div> Updated <div> May 14, 2021 3:21pm </div> </div> </div>
<a>Liza Minnelli </a>(Krysta Rodriguez). 
<p>“Halston understood Liza in a way that nobody else had,” Halston biographer Steven Gaines told The Post. “He benefited greatly from her starlight, but he also just loved Liza.” </p>
<a>“Simply Halston,” </a>added. “He was also a very clever fellow who loved his friends and could be really supportive and wise.”
<p>Yet their connection was immediate.</p>
<p>“We got along instantly, and he became my fashion mate,” Minnelli <a>told Harper’s Bazaar</a> in 2011. “I did what he said. He really took care of me … Halston told me what to wear every second.”</p>
<a>notorious nightclub Studio 54</a>.
<a> the legendary 1973 “Battle of Versailles” extravaganza</a> that pitted Paris couturiers against American designers — Minnelli ran after him to calm him down and rally his spirits.
<p>“She was the one who sat down with Halston,” model and “Halstonette” Chris Royer later told an interviewer about the event. “She unified everybody.” </p>
<p>Minnelli wasn’t the only unconventional beauty who inspired and hung out with Halston. The designer had an entire coterie of fabulous friends who traveled everywhere with him, always in his original designs. </p>
<p>And they were more than just walking billboards; they actually inspired and influenced his designs, too.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of direct communication between him and these models, especially in the earlier years,” said Mears. “It was not like working with a client. They were really friends.”</p>
<p>“Halston designs things that are specially made for me,” the 200-pound Ast proudly told a TV reporter as seen in the <a>2019 Amazon doc “Halston.”</a> “Which is the most incredible thing.” </p>
<a>Elsa Peretti</a> designed the tear-dropped glass bottle for Halston’s perfume, as well as the chunky silver pendants and bangles his models wore. He later helped her get a gig designing trinkets for Tiffany.
<a>Cleveland</a> traveled everywhere with Halston and his crew, from Studio 54 all the way to China. The former dancer’s grace and elegance seemed to have influenced Halston’s sinuous shapes, which were ideal for the movements of a ballerina.
<p>“He took away the cage and he made things as though you didn’t really need the structure as much as you needed the woman,” Cleveland once said.</p>
<p>“And he lined us girls up — we were all perfectly dressed — and he would go to the first girl and he’d whisper something into their ear. And he’d say, ‘Now don’t forget, you’re the best.'” </p>

<h1> ‘Respect’ review: Jennifer Hudson stars in bland Aretha Franklin film</h1>
<div> August 13, 2021 6:00am <div> Updated <div> August 13, 2021 5:38pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>You’ve seen “Respect” before.</p>
<p>Slivers of this sleepy biopic about the life of singer Aretha Franklin can be found all over the place, from “Ray” to “Jersey Boys.”</p>
<p>There are the early scenes of little “Re” wailing gospel music in church in 1952, just like those of “Tina — The Tina Turner Musical” on Broadway.</p>
<a>Bohemian Rhapsody</a>,” which I continue to hate despite your angry emails.
<p>Running time: 145 minutes. Rated PG-13 (mature thematic content, strong language including racial epithets, violence, suggestive material, and smoking.) In theaters.</p>
<p>Franklin’s self-destructive alcoholism, fueled by the competing pressures of fame and family, was most recently seen as experienced by Judy Garland in “<a>Judy</a>.”</p>
<a>The United States vs. Billie Holiday</a>” was adequate, to be sure, but it wisely focused on Holiday’s struggles with the law and the controversial song “Strange Fruit.” That movie had a point of view.
<p>“Respect’s” point of view is that Franklin was a legend. We already knew that. You can’t excitingly fill two and a half hours with the obvious.</p>
<p>Oddly enough for the big-voiced Hudson, those sections are more gripping than the music sequences.</p>
<p>“Respect” settles for being respectable.</p>

<h1> ‘King Richard’ review: Will Smith finally makes a good movie again</h1>
<div> November 18, 2021 5:01pm <div> Updated <div> November 18, 2021 12:42pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Running time: 138 minutes. Rated PG-13 (some violence, strong language, a sexual reference and brief drug references.) In theaters and on HBO Max.</p>
<p>The “Fresh Prince” is dead! Long live the “King!” </p>
<p>Will Smith resuscitates his sagging acting career with “King Richard,” an engrossing and unusual (in a good way) new biopic about Richard Williams, the controversial father of tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams.</p>
<p>Not this one. “King Richard” is about how the Williams sisters got their start, absolutely, but it’s their tenacious, quick-tempered, eccentric dad who is at the center. </p>
<p>The intense pop lives in Compton, Calif., in the early 1990s with his wife Oracene (Aunjanue Ellis), his daughters Venus (Saniyya Sidney) and Serena (Demi Singleton), and three daughters from Oracene’s previous marriage.</p>
<p>He writes a 78-page plan — yes, this really happened — to skyrocket the girls to tennis success. </p>
<a>revelation of an abandoned former family</a> she never told him about. He’s no saint — but he might just be a genius.
<p>Kudos to the Williams sisters for being so (US) open.</p>

<h1> Michelle Obama’s next gig is a ‘thrill’ acting opposite Tracee Ellis Ross</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 4, 2022 2:58pm <div> Updated <div> January 4, 2022 3:18pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Being first lady was great, but Michelle Obama might have a second act in acting.</p>
<p>In tonight’s eighth and final season premiere of “black-ish,” Obama, 57, will appear as herself on the ABC show.</p>
<p>Tracee Ellis Ross, who plays Rainbow “Bow” Johnson, revealed in a WSJ magazine interview that she personally called Obama to invite her on the series.</p>
<p>“She and I are friends. It was a phone call I made,” Ross, 49, said of Obama. “We got to do really important subject matter that’s mixed in with fun, so it’s receivable.” </p>
<p>The former FLOTUS will use her screen time to promote her voter registration campaign, When We All Vote. In the episode, she takes the Johnsons to a voting fundraiser.</p>
<p>“It felt really fun to welcome someone so special who’s been so important in our world, in our culture, in the kinds of stories we told on ‘black-ish,'” Ross added.</p>
<p>“You do not want to miss this,” Obama says in the video. “This is going to be a good one.”</p>
<p>But this isn’t the first time Obama had the opportunity to act.</p>
<p>She appeared as herself on a two-part episode of the NBC series “Parks and Recreation” in 2014.</p>
<p>The season premiere of “black-ish” will air on Tuesday, Jan. 4, at 9:30 p.m. EST on ABC. </p>
<h1> ‘Girls Trip’ Tracy Oliver: ‘The studio didn’t know if it would succeed’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 1, 2021 4:39pm <div> Updated <div> December 1, 2021 4:40pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Creator/executive producer Tracy Oliver said her new Amazon comedy series “Harlem” likely wouldn’t have been able to happen without the success of her movie “Girls Trip.”</p>
<p>“It was a pretty astronomical change [to my life]. After ‘Girls Trip’ came out. Suddenly I could take out this show and sell it,” Oliver told The Post.</p>
<p>The 2017 comedy, starring Tiffany Haddish, Queen Latifah, and Jada Pinkett Smith, marked the first time that a film written by an African-American woman grossed over by $100 million at the box office.</p>
<p>“The change has been incredible to watch,” said Oliver, who got her start on “Awkward Black Girl,” Issa Rae’s Web series precursor to “Insecure.” </p>
<p>Oliver, who grew up in South Carolina, said that she wove characteristics from herself and her own friends into the “Harlem” characters. </p>
<p>Of the central characters, she’s most similar to Camille, she said. </p>

<h1> Bradley Cooper is turning into awards seasons’ biggest flop after Globes shutout</h1>
<div> January 10, 2022 9:11am <div> Updated <div> January 10, 2022 12:50pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Somewhere in Bradley Cooper’s $13.5 million West Village townhouse is a sad drawer full of crumpled-up acceptance speeches that he’s never gotten to deliver. </p>
<p>But we’ve never had the pleasure of witnessing such moments.</p>
<p>Even worse, this year the Globes — which, despite their controversies, <a>have become a decent prognosticator for the Oscars</a> — snubbed Cooper entirely. </p>
<a>golden boy image was obliterated</a> during press for “A Star Is Born,” when he grew a beard and cranked up his Hollywood pretentiousness to Joaquin Phoenix-on-David Letterman levels. But he is undeniably very talented.
<p>“Nightmare Alley,”<a> a captivating noir thriller</a> that’s set in a sinister circus, is somewhat divisive, though most agree that Cooper is phenomenal in it and is giving a very awards-y performance. </p>
<p>His unhinged portrayal of Barbra Streisand’s ex Jon Peters in “Licorice Pizza” is a laugh riot.</p>
<p>He’s certainly <a>way better than Kate Hudson</a> was last year in that <a>piece of garbage</a> “Music” — and she got a Globes nomination.</p>
<p>The late legend Peter O’Toole was also nominated eight times for an Oscar and never won. </p>
<p>Frances McDormand, Meryl Streep and Gary Oldman, on the other hand, could snag a Golden Globe or Oscar for a TikTok of them ordering a chalupa at Taco Bell.</p>
<p>Cooper, I’m afraid, could be destined to remain in the flop camp for all eternity. Though, as any Cubs fan knows, the impossible can happen. It just might take 108 years.</p>
<h1> Hollywood hypocrites cancel Golden Globes – but put Armie Hammer in new film</h1>
<div> January 10, 2022 3:07pm </div>
<p>On Sunday, Hollywood put on a big show about not putting on a big show.</p>
<p>The Golden Globe Awards were held — sort of — at the Beverly Hilton hotel as usual, but because of COVID and a diversity controversy they were not televised on NBC and there was no audience, red carpet or star presenters. </p>
<p>In fact, there was no possible way to watch the show honoring <a>the best of what we’ve watched all year</a>. </p>
<p>What’s all the fuss about? Last February, a damning report in the Los Angeles Times revealed that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the tiny group that votes for the prizes, <a>had no black members</a>. </p>
<p><a>Outrage ensued</a> (harmless awards shows have annoyingly become reliable lightning rods for for scandal and anger) and NBC axed the 2022 edition.</p>
<p>The problem has since been remedied: The HFPA <a>added 21 diverse journalists to their ranks</a>, including six black voters, and forged a partnership with the NAACP.</p>
<p>The Globes — <a>a silly show where A-listers get drunk </a>while Ricky Gervais insults them — have become Hollywood’s No. 1 Pariah.</p>
<p>But Tinseltown is full of hypocrites.</p>
<p>(Hammer denies the allegations.)</p>
<a>a la Kevin Spacey in “All the Money in the World.”</a> He’s displayed prominently on the poster and the film’s various delays were mostly due to COVID — not saintliness.
<p>Nor am I saying they should, but virtue-signaling Hollywood’s selective outrage is so pathetically transparent, NBC nixed the Globes because it was easy.</p>
<a>was seen by just 6.9 million viewers</a> — the Globes’ worst numbers since the ceremony was aired on TBS in the ‘90s. All awards shows are taking their final dying breaths.
<p>The HFPA membership controversy gave NBC an easy out for a year of a logistically challenging, money-losing endeavor. What do you do when the boyfriend you’ve started to hate anyway crashes your car? You break up with him.</p>
<p>That’s the way it goes in screwy ballyhooey Hollywood.</p>

<h1> The left politicized COVID from the start</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 5:28pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 5:28pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>From the moment COVID-19 appeared, the pandemic became inseparable from politics.</p>
<p>Political frenzy was inevitable since the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have escaped from a level-4-security virology lab in Wuhan, China.</p>
<p>The rapid-fire spread soon threatened to indict the Chinese Communist government for nearly destroying the world economy and killing millions.</p>
<p>Western elites, in response, feared that their own lucrative investments in China would be jeopardized by such disclosures — and so acted accordingly in defending Beijing.</p>
<a>the lab was given subsidies by US health authorities</a>, routed through third parties. Hiding all that damaging information warped government policy and media coverage.
<p>Belatedly, a panicked China shut down all domestic travel in and out of Wuhan — but not flights abroad to Western Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>From the outset, the World Health Organization simply spread false talking points about the outbreak from the Chinese government, delaying a robust global response.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump’s political opponents initially told Americans to shop and travel as usual — only to pivot as cases mounted and they blamed the president.</p>
<p>The US 2020 ban on travel from China was met with charges of racism and xenophobia from presidential candidates. Ironically, many were simply channeling racist and xenophobic China’s propaganda.</p>
<a>was widely ridiculed</a>, despite continuing studies from abroad attesting to their usefulness.
<p>Then they claimed credit for the initial success of the Trump vaccinations.</p>
<p>The Pfizer corporation had promised a major pre-election announcement about its likely rollout of a vaccine in October, just days before the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Then, mysteriously, Pfizer claimed the vaccine, in fact, would not be ready before Nov. 3. A few days after the election of Joe Biden, the company reversed course and announced the vaccinations would soon be available.</p>
<p>Then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo obstructed most all federal help with Trump’s fingerprints on it. That way Cuomo became a media, Emmy-winning darling — <a>before resigning in disgrace.</a></p>
<p>Cuomo’s policies of steering infected patients into long-term-care facilities doomed more than 10,000 of the elderly. New York is now illegally <a>using race to grant preferences</a> in the allotments of tests and new drugs.</p>
<p>In the waning days of the 2022 campaign, Biden went so far as to blame Trump personally for all the deaths from the virus.</p>
<p>Then Nemesis answered such hubris.</p>
<p>The unforeseen Delta and Omicron variants hit. A new phrase, “breakthrough case,” revealed that the vaccinations often <a>could only prevent serious illness</a> but not infection or infectiousness.</p>
<p>Suddenly the best and brightest people with three shots, who had blasted the red-state rubes as the ignorant un-vaxxed, got sick. More have now died from the virus on Biden’s than on Trump’s watch.</p>
<p>A warped economy amid renewed COVID-19 outbreaks helped to further destroy Biden’s waning popularity.</p>
<p>In reaction, the left now calls for realism, emphasis on treatments and acknowledgment of the value of natural immunities. It is even newly curious about the origins of the virus and the need to “get back to normal.”</p>
<p>We are suddenly told that thousands had died “with” rather than “because” of COVID — the exact opposite of what we heard in the Trump era.</p>
<p>A skeptic might suggest terror over the impending midterms finally made the left face reality.</p>

<h1> Once again, Albany fiddles while NY festers</h1>
<div> June 28, 2015 8:00pm </div>
<p>Albany has been described as an alternate universe, a place totally disconnected from the concerns and realities of everyday New Yorkers. The just-ended 2015 legislative session looked like an exaggerated parody of that characterization.</p>
<p>Except it was all too real.</p>
<p>The problems confronting New York are simple and clear: We spend too much; we tax too much; we regulate too much.</p>
<p>Sure, some important issues — like mayoral control of schools, for example — were temporarily hashed out.</p>
<p>But they were perennial housekeeping matters. What good is dusting the top of the refrigerator when there’s rotting food inside?</p>
<p>What were missing were the bold, brave, forward-thinking chess moves to make New York economically relevant again. We got pawn play — a crackdown on nail salons? Really? — instead.</p>
<p>If Albany is an alternate universe, Gov. Cuomo is master of its galaxy. The language he’s using to describe the 2015 session is downright delusional.</p>
<p>The session was “fantastic,” he says. The routine extension of rent regulations, “the best law in the history of the state of New York.”</p>
<p>When I ran for governor last year, I tried to point out the objective truth about New York’s standing as a state. We lead the nation — but in all the wrong categories.</p>
<p>We’re at the bottom of the barrel in “business climate,” and we have the worst economic outlook in the country, according to one key survey.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, given all that, we’re rated as the worst state in the nation in which to retire, and we lead the nation in people moving out.</p>
<p>Virtually nothing Albany did this year will address any of those liabilities.</p>
<p>Without a Republican Senate, they would’ve been made even worse. Even the property-tax-cap renewal came without promised mandate relief, meaning that school districts and municipalities will be forced to charge taxpayers more.</p>
<p>Albany funded Cuomo’s START-UP NY ad campaign for another year, so we’ll be able to see more feel-good commercials.</p>
<p>I knew that running against a first-term incumbent would be an uphill task last year, but I had hoped that the conversation I had with the state would help frame the debate about our future. It did not under this governor.</p>
<p>I proposed cutting the corporate tax rate from 6.5 percent to 5.9 percent to spur investment and job growth.</p>
<p>And I called for natural-gas extraction in New York, something the EPA just declared safe. That alone would put tens of thousands back to work and create billions in revenue. Cuomo banned it.</p>
<p>I also called for state term limits, but it almost goes unsaid that nothing happened there.</p>

<h1> Omicron is milder than Delta, leaked UK government study finds</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 22, 2021 8:35am <div> Updated <div> December 22, 2021 8:36am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Omicron appears to be a more mild version of COVID-19 than the Delta variant, a leaked study from the British government shows. </p>
<p>The early real-world data, which is expected to be released before Christmas, found that Omicron is likely to bring on a mild illness with less serious symptoms in most people.</p>
<p>It is likely down to the large number of people that have been vaccinated and previously infected, as well as Omicron just being naturally milder than other coronavirus variants. </p>
<p>However, the UK health agency warned that the data showed that the mildness of Omicron wasn’t enough to prevent large numbers of hospitalizations. </p>
<p>Those that do become severely ill with Omicron are still at risk of hospitalization and death, the data found.</p>
<p>But scientists also found that a booster dose of the vaccine significantly reduced the chance of developing symptoms and being hospitalized with Omicron, according to the data. </p>
<p>The UK health agency would not comment on the study prior to it being released. </p>
<p>It came as the British government revealed it was reducing the COVID-19 self-isolation period from 10 days to seven days for people who get a negative rapid test two days in a row. </p>
<p>The health agency said its analysis suggested a seven-day isolation period alongside two negative tests had nearly the same protective effect as a 10-day isolation period without testing.</p>
<p>“We want to reduce the disruption from COVID-19 to people’s everyday lives,” health secretary Sajid Javid said.</p>
<p>US federal health officials are considering easing the CDC’s current 10-day isolation guideline for fully vaccinated people who test positive for COVID-19 but no longer have symptoms, Dr Anthony Fauci said Tuesday.</p>
<p>This “one-size-fits-all 10 day period” is unnecessary for many people and “extremely disruptive,” Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told The Post.</p>
<p>“A realistic isolation period is one which lasts so long as contagiousness lasts. It may be as short as a few days in some people and longer in others,” he said.</p>
<p>The CDC revealed earlier this week that Omicron now accounts for 73 percent of new infections across the US. </p>

<h1> The ruling against Biden’s private-sector vax mandate shows it’s indefensible</h1>
<div> November 15, 2021 7:48pm <div> Updated <div> November 16, 2021 9:44am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Under Biden’s order, to take effect Jan. 4, employees who refuse the jabs must submit to <a>weekly testing</a> at their own expense or lose their jobs.</p>
<p>Vaccinations are not required to collect welfare or food stamps or to come across the southern border and apply for asylum. Just to work. Go figure.</p>
<p>Justifying the mandate, Biden said his “patience is wearing thin” and “too many people remain unvaccinated for us to get out of this pandemic.”</p>
<p>But a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals slammed Biden’s end-justifies-the-means approach. The Constitution limits what the federal government can make people do, even in emergencies. </p>
<a>“notoriously conservative</a>.” Vox dismissed it as a “
<a>right-wing panel</a>.” Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus slammed the judges’ “
<a>stingy version of the federal government’s powers</a>” and threw up her hands: “
<a>Maintaining our constitutional structure? How about saving lives?</a>”
<a>bulldoze ahead, disregarding legal challenges</a>.
<p>That shows how little the Biden administration and Democrats care about the rule of law and individual freedom. </p>
<p>At the same time, said the judges, the mandate is inexplicably “underinclusive,” not affecting anyone in smaller workplaces. As if the virus passes over them.</p>
<p>And how about people who don’t work? The judges didn’t raise the issue, but the public keeps asking about it.</p>
<a>Engelhardt noted Klain’s “endorsement” in blasting</a> the unjustifiable mandate.
<a>civil liberties face grave risks when governments proclaim indefinite states of emergency</a>.”
<p>In the meantime, Republicans in Congress are seizing the opportunity to highlight how the mandate makes working people into suckers, while no one else is being forced to choose between their personal freedom and putting food on the table.</p>
<p>It’s the typical Washington hypocrisy: rules good enough for thee but not for me.</p>

<h1> ‘Social and emotional learning’ is often just cover for progressive indoctrination of kids</h1>

<p>Social and emotional learning is the latest trend in your child’s classroom. SEL sounds beneficial, but that’s a disguise. In truth, it often indoctrinates kids with extremist ideas many parents don’t condone.</p>
<p>Most Americans think parents should have the final say on what children are taught. From Treasure Valley, Idaho, to Greenwich, Conn., school-board candidates made SEL an issue in elections earlier this month.</p>
<p>Also Monday, Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita encouraged parents to speak up and cautioned that SEL programs shift “the role of teachers from educators to therapists.”</p>
<a>The SEL ecosystem today is flush with dollars</a>,” reports industry consultant Tyton Partners.
<a>are being used to buy SEL programs</a> and fund SEL instructors. Advocates and companies that produce the materials
<a>lobby Congress and the federal Education Department</a> to ensure legislative language precisely matches what they’re selling.
<p>Nationwide, sales of SEL materials <a>shot up 45 percent</a> in a year and a half, to $765 million in 2021.</p>
<p>Are kids reading that many books about the US Constitution?</p>
<a>CASEL advocates “transformative SEL”</a> to promote “justice-oriented civic engagement.” Translation: make your kids into activists.
<p><a>A South Bend, Ind., school district adopted SEL</a> two years ago to curb substance abuse and bullying. Now parents, recognizing the radical messaging, are demanding more oversight.</p>
<p>Who’s in charge of what your child learns? Parents need to take control. It’s not an easy fight against the combined forces of educational profiteers and left-wing activists. But the stakes are too high to accept defeat.</p>

<h1> ‘My body, my choice’? Only for abortion as the left pushes vaccine mandates</h1>
<div> December 7, 2021 7:25pm <div> Updated <div> December 7, 2021 7:25pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The left wants liberty for pregnant women but tells the rest of us to pound salt.</p>
<p>The mandate also applies to children as young as 5: They’ll need a jab to participate in school activities such as band and sports and to be taken to a restaurant, movie theater or Broadway show.</p>
<p>Kids 5 to 11 just became eligible for COVID shots last month. Not even 20 percent of them have received a dose, the city’s health department reports. Yet de Blasio’s mandate for them goes into effect Dec. 14.</p>
<p>There is no testing alternative, though the city says it will offer exemptions for valid religious or medical reasons, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Well, it can, as long as you’re something other than a child-bearing female. Across the country, Democratic governors and mayors are imposing vaccine mandates. </p>
<a>she says</a>, “How dare you?”
<a>sees</a> “no civil liberties problem with requiring COVID-19 vaccines,” calling mandates a “justifiable intrusion” because bodily autonomy “does not include the right to hurt others.”
<a>Lancet</a> Infectious Diseases.
<p>This week the Supreme Court will vote on hearing a challenge to Maine’s mandate that all health-care workers get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Mandate advocates claim there’s precedent: In 1905, the court upheld Massachusetts’ mandatory smallpox vaccine.</p>
<p><a>Top executives at vaccine-maker Moderna</a> predict their vaccine will not do well against Omicron, and the company is already starting on a new formulation. </p>
<p>Expect that pattern — a new variant followed by new shots — to be repeated. National Institutes of Health head <a>Francis Collins predicts</a> Omicron won’t be the last variant we face.</p>
<p>If Americans capitulate, how many times will they be forced to bare their arms and take whatever an ambitious politician requires? I am pro-vaccine, and I’ve had three jabs. But it has to be voluntary.</p>

<h1> Biden vowed to raise taxes only for the rich — but inflation for the elderly is the cruelest tax of all</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>

<p>Most pols are clueless about the pain inflation is causing.</p>
<p>The result: too many dollars chasing too few goods.</p>
<p>Everywhere, retirees are being forced to replan how they live out their final years because their savings pay for less.</p>
<p>Social Security is raising benefits with a 5.9 percent cost-of-living adjustment — the highest in decades but not enough to offset price hikes.</p>
<p>Inflation’s other victims are wage earners. Wages went up over the last year but less than inflation for most workers. Wages will buy less this Christmas. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden campaigned on a promise never to raise taxes except on the rich. But the Bidenflation raging now is the cruelest tax of all.</p>
<a>point out that single family rental costs are up 17 percent</a> nationwide this year. It’s worse in Manhattan, 
<a>where median rents are up 20 percent</a>.
<p>Even so, Biden and Senate Democrats are trying to ram through the Build Back Better Act before Christmas, ignoring warnings that it will make prices soar higher still because that’s what deficit spending does.</p>
<p>Inflation pain be damned.</p>
<p>Manchin repeated his concerns Monday when asked if he would capitulate to pressure from his party to support Build Back Better. In a 50-50 divided Senate, the bill can’t pass without his vote.</p>
<p>Manchin responded, “Inflation is real. <a>It’s not transitory</a>. It’s alarming. It’s going up, not down. And I think that’s something we should be concerned about.”</p>
<p>Americans agree. Hold the line, Senator.</p>
<p>As long as prices keep going up, count on Democrats to go down in defeat in the midterm elections.</p>
