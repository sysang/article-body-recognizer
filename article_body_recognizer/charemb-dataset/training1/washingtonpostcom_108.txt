<p>Just one week after Michigan's redistricting commission approved new congressional maps, a group of Black legislators went to court to block them — and Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D) became the 25th House Democrat to retire in this cycle. </p>
<a>consisted </a>of 13 people mandated to draw fair maps without partisan favor. The way that it did so worried some Black voter advocacy organizations, and even, eventually, the
<a>released</a> a study that explained what the commissioners had done. A few weeks later, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights
<a>condemned</a> the maps, warning that the plan would violate the Voting Rights Act's guidance on creating districts where racial minorities were the voting majority.
<div><p>Lawrence said in her Tuesday resignation announcement that her decision was not related to redistricting, but other Black legislators, in Lansing, had already been attacking the commission's work and laying out a case against it. </p></div>

<p>Harris, then the vice president-elect, was visiting the DNC offices on Jan. 6 to use the group’s recording studio.</p>

<a><h2>Biden goes after Trump for lies and self-aggrandizement in Jan. 6 insurrection anniversary speech</h2></a>
<p>The president has rarely criticized Trump explicitly during his first year in office. But many Democrats have urged him to take on the former president more forcefully.</p>
<a><h2>Biden to squarely blame Trump for Jan. 6 assault</h2></a>
<p>Biden has often avoided mentioning the former president, wary of elevating him or his falsehoods. But some Democrats say the president needs to take on his predecessor more directly.</p>
<a><h2>Inside the administration’s failure to avert a covid testing shortfall</h2></a>
<p>The administration focused on testing early on as a key element in returning the country to normal. But over time, its emphasis shifted sharply to vaccines.</p>
<a><h2>Biden decries ‘unrelenting assault’ on voting rights in S.C. graduation address at Clyburn alma mater</h2></a>
<p>“This new sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion, it’s un-American, it’s undemocratic and, sadly, it is unprecedented since Reconstruction,” Biden said at South Carolina State University.</p>
<a><h2>Biden pledges ‘whatever it takes as long as it takes’ in tornado-battered Kentucky</h2></a>
<p>From the air and on the ground, the president observed the destruction that has claimed at least 74 lives in Kentucky and said the scope of the devastation was “almost beyond belief.”</p>
<a><h2>Biden walks a careful line on climate after tornadoes</h2></a>
<p>The president stopped short of blaming global warming for the deadly storms that ripped through four states. But he emphasized the tornadoes’ extreme violence and ordered his team to get more definitive answers.</p>

<a><h2>Trump tested positive for coronavirus before first debate with Biden, three former aides say</h2></a>
<p>The timing of the result, revealed by former chief of staff Mark Meadows, means Trump would have had reason to believe he was infected three days before the presidential debate and six days before he was hospitalized for covid-19.</p>
<a><h2>If Biden’s political fortunes are tied to the pandemic, omicron could signal trouble</h2></a>
<p>Biden aides have long said ending the pandemic is key to reviving his political revival. The new variant raises the prospect that might not happen anytime soon.</p>

<div><p>Vice President-elect Kamala D. Harris was evacuated from the Democratic National Committee offices by her Secret Service unit on Jan. 6 last year after a pipe bomb was discovered nearby, according to a person familiar with the incident.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The pipe bomb, which never detonated, was discovered on the same day that a mob attacked the U.S. Capitol, not far from the DNC. The incident was first reported by Politico.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the time, the televisions on display in the DNC showed that Congress was preparing to certify Biden’s election, the person said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harris was taken to an undisclosed location, while the accompanying staffers headed home.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I was here at the Capitol that morning, at a classified hearing with fellow members of the Senate Intelligence Committee,” Harris said in her remarks. “Hours later, the gates of the Capitol were breached.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>She added, “I had left. But my thoughts immediately turned not only to my colleagues, but to my staff, who had been forced to seek refuge in our office, converting filing cabinets into barricades.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harris’s office had previously said that she was not at the Capitol during the insurrection but declined to say exactly where she was.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The FBI has said previously that the person is believed to have placed the pipe bombs between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. on Jan. 5, 2021.</p></div></div>

<p>In the weeks and months ahead, investigators will continue to collect new information but parallel efforts will commence to orchestrate public hearings to tell the story of Jan. 6 from start to finish and to craft a final report.</p>
<a><h2>Thompson says Jan. 6 committee focused on Trump’s hours of silence during attack, weighing criminal referrals</h2></a>

<h2>Key findings of The Post’s Jan. 6 investigation</h2>
<h6><b>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</b></h6>
<li>Alerts were raised by local officials, FBI informants, social media companies, former national security officials, researchers, lawmakers and tipsters.</li>
<li>One of the biggest efforts to come out of Sept. 11, 2001 — a national network of multi-agency intelligence centers — spotted a flood of Jan. 6 warnings, but federal agencies did not show much interest in its information.</li>
<li>The FBI limited its own understanding of how extremists were mobilizing when it switched over its social media monitoring service on the last weekend of 2020.</li>
<h6><b>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</b></h6>
<li>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was left rattled by Trump’s firing of senior Pentagon officials just after the election and sought to put guardrails on deployment of the National Guard.</li>
<h6><b>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</b></h6>
<li>The U.S. Capitol Police had been tracking threatening social media posts for weeks but was hampered by poor communication and planning.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</b></h6>
<h6><b>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</b></h6>
<li>Hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with police at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the morning of Jan. 6, some with shields and gas masks, presaging the violence to come.</li>
<li>D.C. homeland security employees spotted piles of backpacks left by rallygoers outside the area where the president would speak — a phenomenon the agency had warned a week earlier could be a sign of concealed weapons.</li>
<h6><b>Trump had direct warnings of the risks but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</b></h6>
<b> </b>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, other Republican lawmakers and numerous White House advisers to urge the mob to disperse, a delay that contributed to harrowing acts of violence.
<h6><b>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</b></h6>
<li>John C. Eastman, an attorney advising Trump, emailed Pence’s lawyer as a shaken Congress was reconvening to argue that the vice president should still reject electors from Arizona and other states.</li>
<li>Earlier in the day, while the vice president, his family and aides were hiding from the rioters, Eastman emailed Pence’s lawyer to blame the violence on Pence’s refusal to block certification of Biden’s victory.</li>
<h6><b>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to help take back control of the Capitol</b></h6>
<li>After the breach,<b> </b>the bureau deployed three tactical teams that were positioned nearby, but they were small, specialized teams and did not bring overwhelming manpower.</li>
<li>As the riot escalated, acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen scrambled to keep up with the deluge of calls from senior government officials and desperate lawmakers.</li>
<h6><b>Republican efforts to undermine the 2020 election restarted immediately after the Capitol attack</b></h6>
<b> </b>setting in motion a chaotic process that further sowed doubt in the results and a wave of similar partisan investigations in other states.
<h6><b>False election claims by Trump that spurred the Capitol attack have become a driving force in the Republican Party</b></h6>
<li>They include 10 candidates running for secretary of state, a position with sway over elections in many states.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s attacks have led to escalating threats of violence</b></h6>
<li>Election officials in at least 17 states have collectively received hundreds of threats to their personal safety or their lives since Jan. 6, with a concentration in the six states where Trump has focused his attacks on the election results.</li>
<li>Ominous emails and calls have spiked immediately after the former president and his allies raised new claims.</li>
<h6><b>First responders are struggling with deep trauma</b></h6>

<div><div><p>Trump dismissed their arguments.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry,” he said. “And there’s nothing wrong with saying, you know, that you’ve recalculated.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Raffensperger responded: “Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Read the full transcript of the Trump-Raffensperger call</p></div>
<div><div><p>At another point, Trump said: “So look. All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He later added: “So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s no way I lost Georgia,” Trump said, a phrase he repeated again and again on the call. “There’s no way. We won by hundreds of thousands of votes.”</p></div></div>
<p>Several of his allies were on the line as he spoke, including White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and conservative lawyer Cleta Mitchell, a prominent GOP attorney whose involvement with Trump’s efforts had not been previously known.</p>
<div><div><p>The White House, the Trump campaign and Meadows did not respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Raffensperger’s office declined to comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Raffensperger responded with his own tweet: “Respectfully, President Trump: What you’re saying is not true.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans, however, were largely silent. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), when asked about the call while campaigning in Georgia on Sunday for the two GOP senators who face a runoff Tuesday, dodged the question completely.</p></div></div>
<a>invited</a> Michigan Republican state leaders to the White House,
<a>pressured</a> Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) in a call to try to replace that state’s electors and
<a>asked</a> the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives to help reverse his loss in that state.
<div><p>Growing number of Trump loyalists in the Senate vow to challenge Biden’s victory</p></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s a criminal offense,” he said. “And you can’t let that happen. That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump said he plans to talk about the alleged fraud Monday, when he is scheduled to lead an election eve rally in Dalton, Ga. — a message that could further muddle the efforts of Republicans to draw their voters out.</p></div></div>
<p>Additionally, Trump’s apparent threat of criminal consequences if Raffensperger failed to act could be seen as an attempt at extortion and a suggestion that he might deploy the Justice Department to launch an investigation, they said.</p>
<div><div><p>“He was already tripping the emergency meter,” Foley said. “So we were at 12 on a scale of 1 to 10, and now we’re at 15.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Election results under attack: Here are the facts</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I can’t imagine he’s ever getting elected again, I’ll tell you that much right now,” he said of the governor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The secretary of state repeatedly sought to correct Trump, saying at one point, “Mr. President, the problem you have with social media, they — people can say anything.”</p></div></div>
<p>“Oh this isn’t social media,” Trump retorted. “This is Trump media. It’s not social media. It’s really not. It’s not social media. I don’t care about social media. I couldn’t care less.”</p>
<div><div><p>At another point, Trump claimed that votes were scanned three times: “Brad, why did they put the votes in three times? You know, they put ’em in three times.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Raffensperger responded: “Mr. President, they did not. We did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His desperation was perhaps most pronounced during an exchange with Germany, Raffensperger’s general counsel, in which he openly begged for validation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Germany responded: “No, Dominion has not moved any machinery out of Fulton County.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump: “But have they moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Germany: “No.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump: “Are you sure, Ryan?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Germany: “I’m sure. I’m sure, Mr. President.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Despite Trump’s intense hunt for voter fraud, officials in key states have so far identified just a small number of possible cases</p></div>
<div><div><p>But later, Meadows said, “I can promise you there are more than that.”</p></div></div>
<p>Another Trump lawyer on the call, Kurt Hilbert, accused Raffensperger’s office of refusing to turn over data to assess evidence of fraud, and he claimed awareness of at least 24,000 illegally cast ballots that would flip the result to Trump.</p>
<div><div><p>“It stands to reason that if the information is not forthcoming, there’s something to hide,” Hilbert said. “That’s the problem that we have.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Reached by phone Sunday, Hilbert declined to comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We never had the records that you have,” she said. Germany noted that the office is barred under law from sharing certain voter information.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the end, Trump asked Germany to sit down with one of his attorneys to go over the allegations. Germany agreed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet Trump also recognized that he was failing to persuade Raffensperger or Germany of anything, saying toward the end, “I know this phone call is going nowhere.”</p></div></div>
<p>“Why don’t you want to find this, Ryan?” he asked of Germany. “What’s wrong with you? I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I’m sure you’re a good lawyer. You have a nice last name.”</p>
<div><div><p>But he continued to make his case in repetitive fashion, until finally, after roughly an hour, Raffensperger put an end to the conversation: “Thank you, President Trump, for your time.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>‘The last wall’: How dozens of judges across the political spectrum rejected Trump’s efforts to overturn the election</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Rosalind S. Helderman</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Elise Viebeck</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 12, 2020</div></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Rosalind S. Helderman</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Elise Viebeck</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 12, 2020</div></div>
<div><div><p>They are both elected and appointed, selected by Democrats and Republicans alike.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some have served for decades — while others took the bench only months ago.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One is a former high school teacher, another the first Native American woman appointed to a federal judgeship. A third worked for years for a Republican governor who has been a vocal supporter of President Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since the November election, they have all ruled in court against Trump or one of his allies seeking to challenge or overturn the presidential vote.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The string of losses was punctuated Friday by the brief and blunt order of the Supreme Court, which dismissed an attempt by the state of Texas to thwart the electoral votes of four states that went for President-elect Joe Biden.</p></div>
<div><p>Trump and his GOP allies vow to ‘fight on’ after Supreme Court rejects legal challenge to overturn election results</p></div>
<div><p>In an era when so many institutions of American life have bowed to partisan tribalism, the dozens of opinions serve as a resounding reaffirmation of the judiciary’s nonpartisan commitment to basic principles of reason, fact and law.</p></div>
<a>declared</a> U.S. Circuit Court Judge Stephanos Bibas, a former prosecutor and law professor appointed in 2017 by Trump, as he rejected an attempt to throw out Pennsylvania’s votes for Biden.
<a>wrote</a> U.S. District Court Judge Pamela Pepper, who was nominated by President Barack Obama. “One wonders why the plaintiffs came to federal court and asked a federal judge to do so.”
<div><p><b/>Before Election Day, federal judges nominated by Trump largely ruled against efforts to loosen voting rules in the 2020 campaign, <a>siding</a> with Republicans seeking to enforce restrictions, a previous Post analysis found.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Post found that 38 judges appointed by Republicans dealt blows to such suits, with some writing searing opinions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump asked for the rule of law to be followed, Ludwig noted, adding: “It has been.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>After appointing more than 200 judges during his administration, including three Supreme Court justices, Trump made clear that he believed the courts would side with his unprecedented attempts to reverse the election results.<b> </b></p></div>
<div><p>Judges nominated by President Trump play key role in upholding voting limits ahead of Election Day</p></div>
<div><div><p>“The Supreme Court has a chance to save our Country from the greatest Election abuse in the history of the United States. 78% of the people feel (know!) the Election was RIGGED,” the president tweeted Thursday.</p></div></div>
<a>tweeted </a>Saturday: “This is a great and disgraceful miscarriage of justice. The people of the United States were cheated, and our Country disgraced. Never even given our day in Court!”
<div><div><p>In fact, Trump wasgiven his day in dozens of courts. The refusal of so many judges to rule as he wished speaks to the limits on his ability to shape the judicial branch.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added: “These are the people who are committed to the rule of law — and they’re the only ones who are right now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since the Nov. 3 vote,<b> </b>Trump’s supporters insisted he be given a chance to challenge the results in court.</p></div></div>
<a>joined </a>125 other House Republicans in asking the Supreme Court to consider throwing out the results in four states.
<a>outlandish claims </a>about vote-rigging and fraud that he has asserted accounted for Biden’s more than 81 million votes.
<div><p>Election results under attack: Here are the facts</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a blizzard of lawsuits across the country, Trump’s campaign and allied groups argued there were widespread problems with both the administration of the election and ballot security.</p></div></div>
<div><p>As of Friday, more than 50 of their cases had failed or been tossed out of court. Just one minor suit — which shortened the period of time in which Pennsylvania voters could fix errors on certain mail ballots — was successful.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b/>Judges consistently found there was no substantive evidence to support claims of fraud and irregularities — that Biden’s votes were, in fact, legal votes.</p></div></div>
<a>wrote</a> state District Court Judge James T. Russell, a former lieutenant in the U.S. Army. A fourth-generation Nevadan,
<a>Russell’s grandfather was also a judge</a>, assuming the bench after injuring his leg working on the railroad.
<div><div><p>In Pennsylvania, Bibas — who sits on a federal circuit court, just below the U.S. Supreme Court — <a>wrote</a>: “Charges of unfairness are serious. But calling an election unfair does not make it so.”</p></div></div>
<b/>conservative attorney Sidney Powell, federal District Court Judge Diane J. Humetewa
<a>wrote</a>: “Allegations that find favor in the public sphere of gossip and innuendo cannot be a substitute for earnest pleadings and procedure in federal court.”
<div><div><p>A handful of judges appeared more open to Trump’s arguments, but such views came in dissents to majority opinions that carried the day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unlike politics and the media, courtrooms are run by certain rules, applied over and over in matters small and large.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And, finally, if lawyers say a fact is a fact, they must be able to prove it is a fact — with credible, firsthand evidence.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Over and over again, Trump and his allies failed to convince judges that their complaints overcame some of these hurdles. In many cases, they failed to demonstrate that they cleared any of them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Courts view GOP fraud claims skeptically as Democrats score key legal victories over mail voting</p></div>
<div><div><p>Instead, judges repeatedly found that plaintiffs without standing filed cases that, per past precedent, were lodged too late, sometimes in the wrong courts, asking for disproportionate relief based on unsubstantiated claims.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Once the door is opened to judicial invalidation of presidential election results, it will be awfully hard to close that door again. This is a dangerous path we are being asked to tread,” Hagedorn added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Post review found striking diversity in the political orientation and experience among the judges who ruled against Trump or his allies. Fifty-four were men, 32 were women. They ranged in age from 42 to 82.</p></div></div>
<a>wrote</a> that “the right to vote is among the most sacred rights of our democracy and, in turn, uniquely defines us as Americans.”
<div><div><p>A suit from a Trump ally trying to throw out the state’s election results was “stunning in its scope and breathtaking in its reach,” she continued.</p></div></div>
<a>compared</a> the Trump campaign’s stitched-together legal theories to “Frankenstein’s monster.”
<a>wrote</a> Brann, days after he heard Trump’s attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani
<a>personally argue</a> the case.
<div><p>“In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state. Our people, laws, and institutions demand more,” he concluded.</p></div>
<div><div><p>What the judges have in common, Geyh said, is education and experience that have “acculturated them to take the law seriously.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The judges made it clear, he said, that they do not wish to be dragged into political battles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Instead, as Parker wrote in Michigan, the task of selecting political leaders — and especially the president of the United States — should fall to voters, not judges.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The people,” she wrote, “have spoken.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A year later, the House of Representatives can still look like a crime scene some days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the detectors aren’t there to deter armed insurrectionists. Instead, those detectors are there to prevent lawmakers or their staff from trying to commit violence against each other.</p></div></div>
<p>Trust in one another, whether to clinch a critical legislative deal or to protect each other from violence, seems to be at an all-time low one year after the pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol with both Democrats and Republicans in their crosshairs.</p>
<div><div><p>“This is — it’s kind of scary.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans, rather than reining in their most controversial members, have dug in with their support for them and now accuse Democrats of a massive overreaction to the threats against the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Interviews with more than 20 members, including Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate, revealed a Congress that remains on edge and where worries about more violence are front of mind for many — and for good reason.</p></div>
<b> </b>In 2017, there were fewer than 4,000 threats against lawmakers, a number that rose to more than 8,600 threats in 2020.
<div><div><p>The tension is less palpable in the Senate, a traditionally more chummy place, where Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), one of the highest-profile objectors to Biden’s election, believes he just had his most bipartisan year ever.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some lawmakers sense the tensions easing a bit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the days following the Jan. 6 attack, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) questioned whether the rioters had inside information because they found his somewhat hidden office on the third floor of the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I have seen that in the last four, six to eight weeks, while at the same time you see Kevin McCarthy acting like a dunce,” he added, referring to the House minority leader.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some Democrats are less worried about the state of current tensions than the future, viewing last January’s attack as an opening salvo by Trump and his supporters that laid the groundwork for bigger clashes to come.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s a great alarm about how they will behave after the 2024 presidential election,” Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Democrats’ anger</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>That move radicalized some of the most centrist Democrats, the type who usually brag about their bipartisan credentials, and hardened them toward their Republican colleagues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) expressed disbelief that some of the Republicans who faced the greatest threats on Jan. 6 still fall in line behind Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Dec. 8, for instance, those five joined with 15 of the most conservative, pro-Trump Republicans to vote against the Improving the Health of Children Act that would help prevent childhood birth defects.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The bill’s author, Rep. Earl L. “Buddy” Carter (R-Ga.), voted against Biden on both Jan. 6 votes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the other side of the Capitol, the Senate stayed in session — even calling in Vice President Harris to cast a tiebreaking vote for Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Obviously, Davis said, the threat wasn’t that dangerous; otherwise, Harris would not have been allowed anywhere near the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Davis summed up his views of House Democrats in a few words: “We can’t live in fear.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A handful of Democrats, to advance policies they say will help the country, have put aside their anger to work with Republicans who are most supportive of Trump and dismissive of the attack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of the leading liberals, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), has not let Jan. 6 get in the way of his strange-bedfellows coalition, working with Trump’s biggest backers in the House on reining in the Pentagon’s powers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It sometimes means he is working hand in hand with Republicans who were more than passive supporters of the effort to overturn the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A less tense Senate</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Coons also had a John Lewis moment, back in the summer, as he prepared remarks for one of the bipartisan prayer breakfasts he co-chairs, thinking about how Lewis forgave people who assaulted him during his days as a civil rights activist.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The next morning, as he looked into the audience, Coons saw several senators he had not spoken to since they cast votes against Biden’s election, and he thought he needed to find a way to deal with his anger toward them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>One of his best friends in the Senate, James Lankford (R-Okla.), is the other co-chairman of the prayer breakfast, and the duo run the Ethics Committee, a highly sensitive job traditionally given to two of the most trusted senators.</p></div>
<div><div><p>During the five-hour delay to secure the Capitol, Lankford and a few other Republicans withdrew their support for challenging the election, while the others agreed to limit the objections to just Arizona and Pennsylvania.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“At the end of the day all 100 senators all certified the election. Every one of them. Because you have to challenge enough states that day to be able to challenge the election,” Lankford said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>That approach infuriates many Democrats, who view any vote against those two states as supporting Trump and his insurrectionists. “Whatever you need to tell yourself to sleep at night,” Casten said of Lankford’s logic.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But Klobuchar found the actions by Lankford and those few other Republicans to be courageous, switching sides when they realized how out of control things got in the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They could not stomach being on the side of an insurrection. And that actually brings me great solace,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s been a pretty productive year that way, bipartisan,” Hawley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans who completely turned on Trump — 10 voted to impeach in the House, seven voted to convict in the Senate trial — have faced the most isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There is one issue related to Jan. 6 on which lawmakers in both parties have recently found common ground: beefing up their own security in the event of another attack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Delays in getting Guard troops to the Capitol surfaced quickly as a key lapse that helped lead to that day turning more deadly, including confusion about the Capitol Police Board’s process for requesting help.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The measure passed the Senate on Dec. 13 by unanimous consent, sending it to the House for consideration the next day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No one even asked for a recorded vote, and it won unanimous approval.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Every minute counts during an emergency,” Klobuchar said in a statement.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Abortion wars have raged for decades. They could soon get worse.</h1></div>

<p>A decision to overturn <i>Roe </i>would forever etch the court of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in the history books and trigger a political earthquake, potentially redrawing the balance between the supporters and opponents of abortion rights.</p>
<div><p>Trump’s Supreme Court nominees are pivotal to the future of abortion rights</p></div>
<i>Webster v. Reproductive Health Services </i>might be an imperfect guide ­to what could be on the horizon, given the scale of a decision to overturn
<i>Roe</i> compared with the decision to allow states to restrict abortions. But it provides some clues as to how a charged decision over a volatile issue might resonate politically.
<div><p>Abortion battles intensify ahead of court ruling in Roe v. Wade</p></div>
<i>Webster</i> marked the beginning of a process of ever-more-restrictive legislation that could culminate in the court’s decision in the Mississippi case.
<i>Webster</i> decision obviously pale in comparison to what could happen after a decision about the Mississippi law — and not just because of the enormousness of what is at stake. It’s also the timing of the decision.
<i>Webster</i> came more than a year before the 1990 midterm elections. The court’s decision in the Mississippi case will come only a matter of months before the 2022 elections.
<div><p>After what happened in the past few years, Senate races, too, will take on new significance because of abortion. Over the past five years, a Republican majority in the Senate showed what could be done to shape the Supreme Court.</p></div>
<i>Roe</i> would motivate younger Democratic women, many of whom are infrequent voters. Lake said baby boom women are another constituency that could be fired up by a decision to overturn
<i>Roe</i>. Unlike younger women, she said, they remember when abortion was not legal and have been skeptical that

<p>The Supreme Court is in danger of being seen as reflective of the country’s political divisions rather than independent of them, to the point that there is more talk than ever on the left about whether changes should be made to its structure.</p>

<p>On New Year’s Eve,<b> </b>deputies in St. Lucie County, located along the state’s Atlantic coast north of Palm Beach, responded to a call reporting an attempted suicide. When they arrived they learned it involved one of their own.</p>
<div><div><p>Deputy Clayton Osteen was hospitalized and taken off life support on Jan. 2, St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken J. Mascara said in a <a>statement</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the devastating news did not end there. On Tuesday, Mascara said Deputy Victoria Pacheco, who shared a 1-month-old son with Osteen, had died by suicide.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The deaths of the deputies, who Mascara described as “young, ambitious,” sent shock waves<b> </b>through the law enforcement agency.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Words cannot express the tremendous loss we all feel,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a request for more details Thursday, but Mascara said earlier this week he hoped the deaths bring attention to the many challenges officers face while on duty.</p></div></div>
<a>report</a> found that first responders experience several barriers to access mental health treatment, such as stigma, a culture of not seeking help and a general lack of knowledge about mental health and treatment.
<b> </b>stressful work conditions first responders often experience “can contribute to the development of new mental health conditions or exacerbate preexisting mental health conditions.”
<div><div><p>The report also noted a lack of comprehensive national data on first responder mental health.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although the circumstances of the Florida deputy deaths remain unknown, the events have prompted broader discussions among current and former police officers about the impact the hardships of the job have on mental health.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“People don’t understand what we take home with us,” retired police officer Dana Bennett told WPTV, a local TV station. “When one of us hurts, we all hurt.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last week, a <a>Hillsborough County</a> deputy who had been with the agency for over two decades, also died by suicide, the sheriff of the Tampa-area county announced.</p></div></div>
