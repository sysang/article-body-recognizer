<p>Faced with dozens of positive coronavirus tests that have forced the postponement of seven games over the past week, Commissioner Adam Silver said Tuesday that the NBA will continue its 2021-22 season as its Christmas Day showcase games approach.</p>
<a>suspend play in response to the omicron variant</a>, with its shutdown scheduled to last from Wednesday to Sunday. The NHL, which earlier this week moved to
<a>eliminate team travel between the United States and Canada</a>, has dealt with outbreaks among teams that have landed approximately 15 percent of players in the coronavirus protocols and prompted 50 game postponements.
<div><p>Covid could turn NBA’s Christmas showcase into a dud</p></div>
<a>uncertain availability of key players threatens to spoil</a> the most important date on the league’s regular season calendar.
<a>reinstituted enhanced coronavirus health and safety protocols</a> and altered its roster rules to allow teams to cope with outbreaks by signing replacement players without impacting their salary cap or luxury tax payments.
<div><p>”Today, we committed to facilitating the delivery of booster shots to all eligible players," the union said in a statement. “The NBPA is strongly encouraging all of our members to receive a booster as soon as possible.”</p></div>
<a>could lead to increased spread</a> of the virus.

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Kevin B. Blackistone</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>June 7, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Until Saturday, when his old college teammates, his coach, his blood relatives and various alumni and admirers brought him back.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Baron traveled to salute Carter from Florida, where he retired a few years ago after a 29-year college basketball coaching career that ended at rival Canisius in 2016.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Carter’s brother Chuck came east from Jamestown, N.Y. He said he hadn’t seen his older brother since 1976, when Carter got an opportunity to continue his professional playing career in Europe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I hadn’t found out until … I got a call,” Chuck Carter said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From 2019: For one season 50 years ago, an ABA team called Northeast D.C. home</p></div>
<a>three years of college eligibility</a>, in the eighth round of the 1967 NBA draft. The New Orleans Buccaneers chose him in the seventh round of the ABA’s draft that year. And the same year, the New York Mets selected him in the 52nd round of
<a>baseball’s draft</a> as an outfielder, while the NFL’s Buffalo Bills used
<a>a 13th-round pick</a> on Carter as a halfback.
<div><div><p>“He was one of our celebrities,” said Nancy Roberts, who graduated from St. Bonaventure in 1969 and came to Carter’s ceremony from Rochester. “We’re a small school, you know.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jennifer Stauffer said she never knew of her colleague’s fame when the two met in the late 1990s as limousine drivers in Las Vegas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He had a sense of humor,” she explained. “That’s why I liked him.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stauffer said Carter never talked about starring in football and baseball at St. Bonaventure, about playing against Julius Erving in the ABA or ending with a brief career in France.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In seven ABA seasons, Carter <a>averaged 18.2 points and 6.8 rebounds</a>. In 1971, he was named an all-star. He was better in subsequent seasons, but honors eluded him.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In my search for Carter I eventually called Randy Anderson, president of the board of directors at the Chautauqua Sports Hall of Fame in Jamestown. It <a>inducted Carter in 1984</a>. He didn’t make that event in his honor, either.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Fate didn’t help George,” said his Bonnies coach, Larry Weise.</p></div></div>
<div><p>After Carter graduated to the pros, Bob Lanier joined the St. Bonaventure varsity with Butler and put the team on the map with a 23-2 record, a No. 3 AP poll ranking and an NCAA tournament region semifinal loss <a>to North Carolina</a>.</p></div>
<a>Dropping Dimes</a> that was trying to buoy the lives of ABA players such as Carter who contributed to the success of the NBA but missed out on its riches.
<div><p>From Mikan to LeBron, how the NBA has evolved</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Helping out someone in need,” Abrams said, “made sense.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve probably raised $500,000 since we started,” Tarter said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“But we keep losing guys,” Abrams said. “Three in the past year.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve been a pallbearer at two of them,” Tarter said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Daniels died in 2015.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“But this particular story,” Abrams said of Carter, shaking his head.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He was all by himself,” Tarter said, completing the thought.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The names change every decade, but iconic NBA stars are always reincarnations of Elgin Baylor</p></div>
<div><div><p>Dropping Dimes couldn’t keep him in his house, but it did find an apartment for him and channeled him enough funds to rent it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The current basketball coach, Mark Schmidt, mentioned how alums often talk about “The Bonaventure Way,” a frequent refrain heard by alums of schools just about anywhere.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This isn’t shallow,” Schmidt said, looking at the assembled. “This is fact. I didn’t know George until about two weeks ago.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Carter’s ashes rested in a rectangular pearl white urn. It was nestled in a bed of white flowers and angel’s breath atop a pedestal draped in green turf.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Behind it sat George Carter’s dark gray marble head stone.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Forever in the hearts of the Bonnies,” it read.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>George Carter was back, for good.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield on Thursday downplayed death threats his wife said they had received in the wake of his struggles in last week’s loss to the Green Bay Packers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Indicating that he and his wife had received such treatment in the past, Mayfield said he did not bring the matter to team or law enforcement officials.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The No. 1 overall pick in the 2018 draft, was asked about comments made by his wife in an <a>Instagram</a> story she shared Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The death threats, lies being told about my husband, and blatant DISRESPECT never ceases to amaze me.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She shared those remarks several days after her husband threw a career-high four interceptions in the <a>24-22</a> Christmas Day loss in Green Bay that dropped the Browns’ record to 7-8 and damaged their playoff hopes.</p></div></div>
<a>getting activated</a> off the league’s covid-19 reserve list, and had not been able to practice with his team since being placed on the list Dec. 15.
<div><div><p>Mayfield said that while he had “quite a bit of experience of hearing a lot of opinions on the outside coming in, it’s hard when it comes down to somebody that you love and you care about.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s just one of those things that it has blown up to be a much bigger deal on the outside. It’s not like it’s anything new for us.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Browns Coach Kevin Stefanski suggested Thursday that those kinds of comments directed at the Mayfields were not overly unusual, adding that the organization stood ready to assist if needed.</p></div></div>
<a>said</a>. “If it rises to the level of that, certainly, we can help address those type of things. Short of that, just in general and not specific to that, but in general there is a lot of noise out there.”
<p>In the Instagram story, Emily Mayfield added, “For the record — I pray for those of you who even think those thoughts, let alone type them out. I hope you can find some happiness so you stop trying to steal it from others.”</p>

<div> <div> By Richard Johnson </div> <div>November 11, 2020</div> </div>
<p><i>Part of an occasional series</i></p>
<a>looked at the picture the offense attempts to paint in the passing game</a>. But what about the one the
<i>defense</i> is sketching all over the field?
<p><b>Could you explain this in three sentences or less? </b></p>
<p><b>So, what about cover-one, -two, -three, et al.? </b></p>
<p>We’ll get there, but that’s the wrong initial question. Before we get to individual coverage types, use the power of observation to determine what coverage type it <i>isn’t</i> before figuring out what it is.</p>
<p>Before every play, ask yourself: MOFO, MOFC or MOFE?</p>
<p><b>Are you calling me a …</b></p>
<p>Don’t be silly! Those letters stand for something.</p>
<p>MOFO: Middle of the field open</p>
<p>MOFC: Middle of the field closed</p>
<p>MOFE: Middle of the field empty</p>
<p><b>Is this some deep philosophical introspection? </b></p>
<p>Nah, fam, it’s all about the safeties. They usually line up about 11 yards from the line of scrimmage. They’ll tell you what you need to know.</p>
<p>Are there two safeties deep? Then the middle is open. One? Closed. None? Empty.</p>
<p>So if you’re able to identify that, you’re halfway to thinking like an NFL quarterback pre-snap!</p>
<p><b>Okay, but what does that tell me exactly? </b></p>
<p>From here, we can use the process of elimination to approximate coverages.</p>
<p>MOFE is pretty simple. A team <i>can</i> play zone behind it, but it’s pretty much always man because this setup really signals the intention to blitz <a><i>a bunch</i> of players</a>.</p>
<p>As for the others …</p>
<div> <ul> <li>Zone: Cover-two, cover-four, cover-six</li> <li>Match: Looks like man pretty much, but with exceptions</li> <li>Man: Cover-two man</li> </ul> </div>
<div> <ul> <li>Zone: Cover-three</li> <li>Match: Three-match (looks a lot like regular cover-three)</li> <li>Man: Cover-one</li> </ul> </div>
<p><b>Whoa, big guy, that’s pretty confusing! </b></p>
<p>I know. It certainly can be, but stay with me. We’ll start with the man coverages.</p>
<p>Okay, now let’s go to cover-two man. Two safeties deep, and everyone mans up underneath. Simple.</p>
<p><b>Okay, so what about the zone stuff? </b></p>
<p>As you may have been able to gather by now, the numbers that delineate coverages will <i>almost</i> always tell you how many DBs are deep.</p>
<p>So we’ll start with cover-three. It’s simply three DBs deep and everyone else underneath behind the defensive line. Here are the zone responsibilities for the back seven players:</p>
<p>In cover-two, the safeties effectively split the field into two deep halves. Everyone else underneath plays zone coverage. These zones have fancy names, but they don’t really matter. It’s two deep, five underneath.</p>
<p>For cover-four, when the ball gets snapped, it’s four guys deep, and three guys underneath:</p>
<p><b>So defenses just keep things this simple? That doesn’t seem smart. </b></p>
<p>We’re just scratching the surface. The modern evolution of coverages is about blending them. That is done by manipulating those safeties pre- and post-snap. One way to do that is to “spin” the safeties.</p>
<p>This might look like it’s about to be cover-four.</p>
<p>But guess what? After the snap, the safety on the right rotates down, and the one on the left moves to the middle of the field. Now it’s cover-three, specifically a variation called cover-three buzz:</p>
<a>we know the coverage as Tampa Two</a>.
<p>It’s doable, but it gets tough if you don’t have a player such as Brooks or Brian Urlacher who can read run or pass effectively and shoot deep if he sees it’s going to be a pass.</p>
<i>way</i> complicated, and I’ll touch on it in a bit, but for now the most straightforward way to mix coverages is …
<p>Cover-six: That does not mean six defenders deep (although that’d be pretty funny). It means a mixture of cover-four and cover-two. (Four plus two equals six — football coaches are basically Isaac Newton with headsets.)</p>
<p><b>You talked about man and zone, but what’s match? </b></p>
<p>In a nutshell, match coverage lets a defense play <i>this </i>if the offense does <i>that </i>after the snap, which <a>you can see an example of here</a>.</p>
<a>by splitting his defense up into three units</a> (the front six players in the box, then three DBs on one side and two DBs on the other).
<p>The Horned Frogs play a sort of matchup zone that functionally plays out like man coverage but not until the receivers are into their routes, and it starts out looking similar to regular zone.</p>
<p>The topic for the next installment? What defenses are trying to do up front.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Gaps of understanding: Why football plays work, or don’t</a></div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Protecting the QB: How and how many</a></div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Pass routes are science. Running them is an art.</a></div> </div>

<div><h1>What makes the Veterans Classic so special? The U.S. Naval Academy — and Navy’s players.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>November 13, 2021 at 3:08 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Ed DeChellis relaxed in the Navy coaches’ locker room about 90 minutes before the Midshipmen tipped off against Virginia Tech on Friday evening in the eighth annual Veterans Classic at Alumni Hall.</p></div></div>
<div><p>It was DeChellis who came up with the idea to play a doubleheader either on or right around Veterans Day every year and to bring three good teams to the academy <a>to spend a day as tourists</a> and then an evening playing basketball.</p></div>
<a>and beat 25th-ranked Virginia, 66-58</a>, to open their season.
<a>beating Georgetown last year</a>, but we were surrounded by cardboard cutouts, not real fans. This was different.”
<div><p>College basketball is actually back — with pep bands, fans, upsets and chills</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Mids made eight of 12 three-pointers in the first half and led by seven in the second. Back came Virginia to tie the game at 55 with 8:45 to go.</p></div></div>
<a>that won a national championship three seasons ago</a> picks up the pace against a Patriot League team that last beat a ranked team in 1986.
<div><div><p>David Robinson did not walk in the door to the Navy locker room Tuesday. The Mids won anyway.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They <i>won</i> the game,” said Spiders Coach Chris Mooney, starting his 17th season at Richmond even though he’s not yet 50. “They made big-time plays, and we just didn’t have answers.”</p></div></div>
<a>their 2018 victory as a No. 16 seed over top-seeded Virginia</a>.
<p>One thing that will make his job much easier is the presence of 6-foot-7-inch forward Justin Bean, one of five players on the team who has been on a two-year Mormon mission — which he did right after graduating from high school in 2015.</p>
<div><p>Virginia Tech men’s basketball gets glimpse into military life as part of Veterans Classic</p></div>
<div><div><p>Unlike the other visiting players who toured the Yard on Thursday, Horvath had been there before. As a high school senior in West River, Md., he was recruited by Navy and took an official visit before deciding on UMBC.</p></div></div>

<a>studying for a master’s degree in ocean technology. At MIT</a>. That’s the place where the students chant “safety school” at Harvard’s starters when the schools play every November.

<div><div><p>PHILADELPHIA — Home sweet home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In my house, the Palestra is known as the place where my wife, Christine, would send the police to look for me if I ever disappeared. I love it that much.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There are plenty of wonderful places that host college basketball — there’s no point trying to list them all here — but there’s only one Palestra.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Palestra isn’t about numbers. It’s about <i>feel</i>. Nothing feels quite like the Palestra for anyone who loves basketball and has spent any time here — as a player, a coach, a fan or a sportswriter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That would make O’Hanlon 88, but what the heck; he looks considerably younger than 73. </p></div></div>
<div><p>“Now that’s a day I’d like to work,” Gladden said with a laugh. “But I’ll be 68. I don’t know if I can hang on for that long.” He laughed again. “Might be worth a try.”</p></div>
<div><p>After a historic layoff, Ivy League basketball is back. Did its shutdown go too far?</p></div>
<a>the Philadelphia Inquirer’s Mike Jensen</a>, who is now the dean of Philadelphia sportswriters and writes about college hoops as well as anyone.
<div><div><p>“I’ll give up the Final Four after next year because that will make 50,” Hoops said. “But I’ll never give up coming to this place.”</p></div></div>
<a>agreed to let Penn State move its home game with the Spartans here</a>. He knew his team would play in a roaring, packed, 8,722-capacity gym instead of a half-full (maybe) Bryce Jordan Center on Penn State’s campus.

<div><p>From 2020: Philadelphia says goodbye to an icon, and the Palestra will never feel the same</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Was it tough without Jack?” Donahue asked me afterward, knowing how I felt about him. Like everyone else from Philadelphia, Donahue knew exactly how much Scheuer meant to the city — and to the Palestra.</p></div></div>
<i>was</i> tough, but nothing — not an accident on I-95 that cost me an hour going north, not stopped traffic on I-676 when I could
<i>see</i> the South Street exit — was going to stop me from being there. I stopped at
<a>the Sign</a>, walked down the ramp and felt the same chill that everyone else felt walking into the arena.
<div><div><p>Charles was hurt as a freshman, then lost his sophomore season to the pandemic. Now he’s finally getting to play.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That meant the place was sold out and the seats in the corners were filled. There were no corners Tuesday and no Scheuer. But it was still the Palestra.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Home sweet home.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>‘Raise a Fist, Take a Knee’ excerpt: Race and the illusion of progress</h1></div>

<div><div><p><i>The following is an excerpt from “Raise a Fist, Take a Knee,” a book by Washington Post columnist John Feinstein, </i><a><i>published this month by Little, Brown</i></a><i>.</i></p></div></div>
<div><p>Eldridge Dickey, the first Black quarterback drafted in the first round, never got his shot</p></div>
<div><div><p>Most nights, after a game at Madison Square Garden, Tapscott could make it home in 15 to 20 minutes since the traffic was minimal at that hour. But not always.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Tapscott’s crime? Speeding? No. Drinking and driving? Absolutely not. Broken taillight? Expired license plates?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No, Tapscott was pulled over for the catchall that most African-American men — especially those who drive a high-priced car — experience at some point: DWB. Driving While Black.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Believe me when I tell you: I wasn’t just careful; I was extra careful,” Tapscott said. “But if a cop caught a glimpse of me, there was a decent chance I was going to get stopped.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“But if you’re Black, it goes beyond that. You’re worried that you might die. When a White person tells me they don’t believe that, I say, ‘That’s because you’ve never been Black.’ ”</p></div>

<div><h1>Cincinnati needed a perfect storm to make the CFP. The clouds are gathering.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>November 25, 2021 at 8:15 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Mark your calendars. Synchronize your watches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is very possible that, shortly after noon on Dec. 5 — whenever the ESPN talking heads mercifully stop talking — hell will freeze over. The apocalypse might arrive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Or both.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s because it is now entirely possible that when the four College Football Playoff teams are “unveiled” at that hour, the University of Cincinnati will be among the chosen four.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, how did we get to the point where the members of the G-13 must feel as if they are strapped into a dentist’s chair, having a root canal without Novocain?</p></div></div>
<div><p>Cincinnati makes history by joining Ohio State in the CFP’s top four</p></div>
<div><div><p>It started when Cincinnati went to Notre Dame Stadium, where the Irish had won 26 straight games, <a>and handily beat them, 24-13</a>, never trailing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Meep, meep. Here come the UTSA Roadrunners, college football’s other unbeaten team.</p></div>
<i>zero</i> wins against currently ranked teams, and they struggled, for crying out loud, against
<i>Kansas</i>. The Cowboys have one win against a ranked opponent — Baylor at home — and were lucky to beat Tulsa, which is a gaudy 5-6.
<div><div><p>Nope, no help there.</p></div></div>
<a>routed a good SMU team</a>, 48-14, on Saturday and appear to have put their midseason malaise, which led to a couple of close games, behind them.
<div><div><p>At least that might numb their pain.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There are still games to be played. And a Cincinnati loss would take all the fun out of this. But if the Fightin’ Fickells can win twice more, Dec. 5 should be a historic day.</p></div></div>
<p>Heck, G-13 committee chairman Gary Barta might even say something worth hearing. Hang on, that’s <i>really</i> too much to hope for. Let’s settle for an unbeaten Cincinnati getting in the playoff — or a successful landing on Mars.</p>

<div><h1>For Lee Elder, the first Black golfer to play the Masters, import is not measured in wins</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>November 30, 2021|Updated November 30, 2021 at 1:45 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Nothing ever came easily or quickly for Lee Elder.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Elder died Sunday at 87, and the tributes poured in. Finally.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amen to that.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Obituary: Lee Elder, barrier-breaking golfer, dies at 87</p></div>
<div><p>Svrluga: Lee Elder made history at the Masters. He made an impact in Washington.</p></div>
<div><p><span>Tiger Woods admits his days as a full-time part of PGA Tour likely over after car crash</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Woods turned down the invitation, saying he was going on vacation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Almost a year later, I asked him how he could possibly say no.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They didn’t invite me until after I won the Masters,” he said. “Why didn’t they invite me before that?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Because,” I answered, “until you won, the person they should have invited was Lee Elder. He broke the color line at Augusta, not you.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Woods stared at me for a second and then said, “You might be right.”</p></div></div>
<i>46 years</i> to get around to inviting Elder to participate along with Player and Nicklaus as an honorary starter at the Masters last April.
<p>In truth, the members should have been grateful to Elder for not saying: “Now you invite me? Where were you in 1998, the year after Woods won the Masters and said the road had been paved for him by Ted Rhodes, Charlie Sifford and me?”</p>
<div><div><p>But that was never Elder’s style. He spoke softly but always carried a very efficient driver. Like his friend Robinson, he refused to be baited by racist fans or by a largely racist sport.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If and when the selection committee gets around to electing him, it will — again — be much later than it should have been. But it sure as heck should happen.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Maryland fans will celebrate Mark Turgeon’s departure. So will Mark Turgeon.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>December 3, 2021 at 5:13 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Maryland fans finally got what they wanted Friday: Mark Turgeon’s tenure as the school’s basketball coach ended suddenly — if not necessarily shockingly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Turgeon <a>was 226-116 in 10-plus years coaching in College Park</a>. If there had been an NCAA postseason in 2020, he would have entered this season having been to six NCAA tournaments in the past seven seasons.</p></div></div>
<a>was forced to leave the ACC</a> to grab the money dangled by the Big Ten. When he was offered the job
<a>in the spring of 2011</a>, he had told then-athletic director Kevin Anderson that he wanted to coach in the ACC. He got the chance to do that — for three years.
<div><p>Mark Turgeon steps down as Maryland men’s basketball coach</p></div>
<div><div><p>During Williams’s last seven seasons, Maryland reached the NCAAs only three times and didn’t make it out of the first weekend of the tournament.</p></div></div>
<a>never got to find out how good it might have been</a> because the
<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic shut down the postseason before it got started.
<div><div><p>And he did.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Terrapins turned things around after that, and Williams is now an iconic figure in Maryland’s pantheon.</p></div></div>
<a>his near-fight with Michigan Coach Juwan Howard last season</a>.
<i>That</i> was a moment Maryland fans loved.
<a>a contract extension through the 2026 season</a>, but that was a smokescreen. To get extended, Turgeon had to accept a reduction in buyout money, meaning it would be easier for the school to move on from him.
<a>lost at home to George Mason</a>. Power schools often lose to mid-majors in this day and age —
<a>Navy over Virginia</a>, Colgate over Syracuse and Liberty over Missouri are only a few of this season’s examples — but Turgeon was already on thin ice with many Maryland people before that game. Then came a defeat to Louisville and
<a>Wednesday’s loss to Virginia Tech</a>, a game the Terrapins led by seven in the second half at home.
<div><p>Mark Turgeon’s Maryland career, by the numbers</p></div>
<div><div><p>Did I think he had just coached his last game at Maryland? No. But having known him since his playing days under Larry Brown at Kansas, I felt like I was listening to someone who was very unhappy.</p></div></div>
<a>suddenly resigned Thursday</a>, and now Turgeon is gone from Maryland.
<div><div><p>In the meantime, Maryland fans will be celebrating Turgeon’s departure. The only one who might be celebrating more is Turgeon.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>College Football</a></div></div><div><h1>In the Army-Navy rivalry, where records don’t matter, 4-8 ends up so much sweeter than 8-4</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 11, 2021 at 9:10 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Every once in a while a coach gets a feeling about a game. The smart ones— unlike the Dallas Cowboys’ Mike McCarthy — don’t voice them publicly until after they’ve actually played.</p>
<div><div><p>Army came into Saturday’s game 8-3, with a bowl bid locked up and the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy already retained because it had beaten Air Force and Navy had lost to the Falcons.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Navy was 3-8, a markedly different record. But the Midshipmen were playing their 11th game against a bowl team. Army had played eight bowl teams, but no one like Cincinnati, Notre Dame or Houston— a combined 35-3.</p></div></div>
<a>the Mids stopped them twice late to win, 17-13</a>.
<div><div><p>Sometimes, 4-8 can feel better than 8-4. A lot better.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Everybody be quiet,” he scolded some of his players who had not yet come to attention.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When the last notes of “Navy Blue-and-Gold,” died out a few minutes later, he stood stock-still for a moment, drinking it all in, completely soaked in sweat, clearly drained.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Was this his best win in 14 seasons as Navy’s coach?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve had a lot of good ones over the years,” he said. “But, yes, this one was the best.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There were a lot of reasons he would think that. The season could not possibly have started more disastrously: a 49-7 loss to Marshall and a 23-3 loss to Air Force in which the Mids produced 68 yards of total offense.</p></div></div>
<a>fired longtime offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper</a> in the locker room. A day later, after a long sit-down with Niumatalolo, he relented and
<a>allowed Jasper to continue as quarterbacks coach</a>.
<div><div><p>Nonetheless, it was a demoralizing start to what had promised to be a difficult season even if everything went right.</p></div></div>
<a>had a chance to beat Houston</a> and then came from behind in the fourth quarter
<a>to beat Central Florida</a>. There was a
<a>close loss to Cincinnati</a> and, finally, in November a
<a>heartbreaking loss to East Carolina</a> and a
<div><div><p>“I feel like I’m seeing Navy out there again,” Niumatalolo said after the East Carolina game. “We’re running the ball, taking time off the clock and not making mistakes.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the East Carolina game, freshman Maquel Haywood returned a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. That was impressive. More impressive: Haywood was one of eight freshmen on the field at the time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Which is why Niumatalolo believed his team could beat Army, even though the numbers said Army was likely to win for the fifth time in six years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was former Army coach Bob Sutton who told his players years ago, “The most desperate team wins the Army-Navy game.” There was no doubt Saturday which was the more desperate — or daring — team.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fagot had just called a protection and didn’t expect the ball. But he corralled it and picked up four yards for the first down on the first and last carry of his college career.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>From there, the Mids ran 10 more plays before Bijan Nichols kicked a 43-yard field goal to make it 17-13.</p></div></div>
<p>Army finally creased Navy territory again on its final offensive play, when quarterback Christian Anderson came up inches short on fourth down at the Navy 48 with 1:31 remaining. Three kneel-downs later, the hysteria and the hugging began.</p>
<a>who died Monday after a training accident</a>. The family was cheered, and Bourgeois’s widow, Megan, spoke briefly to the team. The tears of joy changed to tears of sadness almost instantly.
<div><div><p>There was no joy on the Army side Saturday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The more desperate team wins,” Williams, a former Army football player, said as he congratulated Navy’s players after the alma maters. “They were a little more desperate than us today. They deserved to win.”</p></div>
<div><div><p><a>Brewer: Is the Washington Football Team serious? We’re about to find out.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Svrluga: Nicklas Backstrom’s ‘up and down, emotional’ road to recovery</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Who are the real Wizards? The upcoming road stretch might reveal the answer</a></p></div></div>

<div><h1>Don’t underestimate Deion Sanders — and don’t take your eyes off him</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>December 23, 2021 at 6:55 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>I rarely watch early bowl games that don’t involve Army, Navy or Air Force.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A top recruit passing on a Power Five school to play for a Football Championship Subdivision school? Unheard-of — unless the FCS school is led by Coach Prime.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In signing day shocker, top recruit Travis Hunter goes with Deion Sanders and Jackson State</p></div>
<a>after not running out a popup in Yankee Stadium</a>,
<a>dumping ice water on broadcaster Tim McCarver</a> during the celebration after the Braves won the 1992 National League pennant.
<div><div><p>I never said he didn’t have an ego.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the Braves won Game 5, he came after me — TV crew trailing him — in the clubhouse. “I gave you all that time, and you turned on me like that?” he yelled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I looked at the camera over his shoulder and said, “Deion, I’ll gladly talk to you about this but not as part of your TV special.”</p></div></div>
<i>had</i> made a mistake, if only because I had shared a great quote with someone else. He calmed down. “I gave you a lot of time,” he said quietly.
<div><div><p>I knew he had, and I felt badly, although I pointed out that the quote was funny.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Damn funny,” he said, laughing. “But I gave you a lot more than that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I agreed, and we shook hands.</p></div></div>
<div><p>As HBCU football deals with realignment, the Celebration Bowl still holds its appeal</p></div>
<a>talked Sanders out of retirement</a>. He joined the team the night of the last exhibition game. I was nervous about how he would react to me: Would his memory of me be an angry one? Perhaps he wouldn’t remember me at all.
<div><div><p>In the locker room before the game, Fuller said, “Deion, I don’t know if you know John Feinstein.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Absolutely I do,” Sanders said, shaking hands. “Atlanta in ’92, right?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I nodded. “Good to see you again,” he said. I breathed a sigh of relief.</p></div></div>
<div><p>As it turned out, I learned much about football that season standing with Sanders on the sideline while he was injured for seven games. The Ravens’ misfortune was my good fortune, and I saw the game differently through his eyes.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Sanders is 54 now, and as always he is impossible not to notice. Even though his team lost to South Carolina State on Saturday, there’s little doubt that if he stays at Jackson State, he will create an FCS dynasty.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And as always with “Prime Time,” it will be a sight to see.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Sam Jones, a core member of the great 1960s Celtics, was a great shooter. And a lot more.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:35 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>If you read Sam Jones’s Wikipedia page, you will learn that his nickname during his 12-year career with the Boston Celtics was “The Shooter.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s no question the Hall of Famer was one of the best jump shooters in NBA history. But among those who knew him — his teammates, his coach, Boston media and fans — his nickname was “Banksie.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sam Jones died Thursday night in Boca Raton, Fla., at age 88. He’d been in poor health this year, finally being forced to give up golf, a game he loved playing — and playing well — into his mid-80s.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colombia's first NBA players, Jaime Echenique, brings some joy to a bleak covid month</p></div>
<div><div><p>Wake Forest Coach Bones McKinney, who had played for Auerbach when Auerbach coached the Washington Caps of the Basketball Association of America, told Auerbach about Jones, whom he’d seen play during his college career.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Celtics had the last pick of the first round. Sight unseen — as had been the case a year earlier with Russell — Auerbach drafted Jones.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Buckner: Bradley Beal's greatest act of leadership came from a syringe</p></div>
<div><div><p>Jones was the only rookie on that team, beating out three-year veteran Dickie Hemric for the last spot on the roster. Hemric had played at Wake Forest — for McKinney.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Jones played limited minutes as a rookie but blossomed in his second season. It was then that Johnny Most, the Celtics’ legendary radio voice, began routinely referring to him as “Banksie” whenever he made a bank shot.</p></div>
<div><div><p>When Jones and roommate Satch Sanders went downstairs to the hotel restaurant to eat, they were told, “Sorry, no Blacks eat in here.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We told them we were guests in the hotel,” Jones remembered. “They said it didn’t matter.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jones and Sanders found Russell, K.C. Jones and Willie Naulls and went to Auerbach’s room. Auerbach called the hotel manager, who backed down and said the players could eat in the restaurant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not good enough,” Jones told his coach. “We’ve been insulted. And tomorrow, after we’re gone, they won’t serve Blacks in that restaurant.”</p></div></div>
<p>Auerbach understood. He drove the five of them back to the airport and they flew home without staying in the hotel or playing in the game. A little more than a year later, those five players became the first all-Black starting lineup in NBA history.</p>
<div><div><p>Jones was just about the only one in the lunch group who dared engage Auerbach in a basketball argument. Or, more accurately, he was the only one in the group <i>allowed </i>to engage Auerbach in a basketball argument.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But when I introduced him to Jones, Cowan, who grew up in New England, lost it. <i>“Sam!”</i> he screamed. “My God, it really is you! This is an honor. You just made my whole day — my whole month!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jones smiled, turned to me and said, “I just wish Red was here to see this.” He did <i>not</i> tell Fluff he was “too late.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Novak Djokovic is desperate to be taken seriously. Now he’s becoming a punchline.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:42 a.m. EST|Updated today at 4:19 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Novak Djokovic is the No. 1 men’s tennis player in the world and may end up the greatest male player of all time. There are some who think he’s already there.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a>, and Antonio Brown
<a>took it a step further</a> when he submitted a fake vaccination card.
<div><div><p>But neither of them were detained by border officials in Australia and <a>held in a hotel</a> as a court weighs deportation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like Rodgers and Brown, Djokovic <a>got himself into an embarrassing mess</a> because he thought he was above the rules of covid decency and refused to get a vaccination that most people understand they need.</p></div></div>
<a>had announced Djokovic was being granted a medical exemption,</a> allowing him to compete in the tournament even though he is apparently unvaccinated.
<div><p>Nadal says Djokovic knew the risks in Australia: ‘If you are vaccinated, you can play’</p></div>
<a>still recovering from knee surgery</a>. Whether he will play again — much less contend for another major title — is in doubt. Nadal is 35 and will play in Australia, but Djokovic
<a>beat him in Paris last spring</a>, an almost unthinkable upset given that Nadal has won the French Open 13 times.
<a>at Wimbledon</a> and came within a whisker of being the third man in history to win a calendar Grand Slam when he reached the U.S. Open final,
<a>only to lose to Daniil Medvedev</a>.
<div><div><p>Still, it felt as if the ­34-year-old’s coronation was little more than a formality, especially with Australia — his “home court” — next up. But Djokovic found a way to mess it up.</p></div></div>
<a>was gone before the end of the first week</a>.
<div><div><p>In short, if you believe Djokovic wasn’t granted a special privilege, Tiley has some oceanfront land in the Outback he would like to sell you.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison clearly didn’t believe Tiley.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No hedging there.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From 2015: How great does Novak Djokovic have to be to be fully appreciated?</p></div>
<div><div><p>At his best, Djokovic is smart and thoughtful and — in my opinion — likable. At his worst, he is bafflingly stupid for someone who is clearly bright.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sadly, this is not unusual for tennis, which has about a dozen ruling bodies, all of which manage to do a lousy job of running the sport. When everyone claims to be in charge, no one is.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No one has worked harder than Djokovic to be taken seriously as a great champion. Now he has become a sad joke.</p></div></div>
<p>Tennis star <a>Novak Djokovic is facing deportation</a> after his travel visa for Australia was canceled.</p>
<p>Djokovic, whose vaccination status is unknown, arrived in Melbourne with a medical exemption to the <a>mandatory coronavirus vaccination</a> to compete in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>News of Djokovic’s vaccine exemption was <a>met with skepticism and pushback</a> from other quarters in the sport.</p>
<p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier that Djokovic would be “on the next plane home” if the tennis star could not prove why he needed an <a>exemption from getting vaccinated</a>.</p>
<p>The world No. 1 men’s tennis star is now <a>reportedly being held at a hotel</a> used to house asylum seekers as his lawyers lodge an appeal.</p>

<p><i>Part of an occasional series</i></p>
<a>about pass routes and how they work</a>. Running routes correctly is undoubtedly important, but each individual route is just a component. To understanding how entire passing schemes work, you take
<a>what we know about pass blocking</a> and combine that with how different routes work together. Because here’s the secret: It often takes more than one receiver to become “open.”
<p><b>So how many “concepts” are we talkin’ about here? </b></p>
<p>There are dozens, if not hundreds, of passing concepts out there at different levels of football. There’s a family of concepts, for instance, that are just meant <a>to get triangles</a> in the secondary to stress defenses.</p>
