<h1> Have You Ever Been Told You Were Needy? </h1>
<h2> Were you really needy or was it about the relationship? </h2>
<a>Fear</a> often fuels neediness—fear of abandonment or rejection. But more often than not, fear of break up or
<p>What is it that precipitates needy behavior?</p>
<p>1 - Being in a relationship with someone who has no clue about what you’re feeling or about what you need.</p>
<p>2 - Being involved with someone who is not invested enough in the relationship to care to do something about your expressed and unexpressed needs.</p>
<p>3 - Reacting to a dangled carrot—a promise that seems to never be fulfilled. </p>
<p>5 - The exception—being involved in a relationship with someone who has been unable to meet your needs but genuinely wants to give and is willing to learn how.</p>
<p>So what do you do when you're that "needy" person?</p>
<p>1 - First figure out what it is that you're missing. Is it validation, support, acceptance, <a>forgiveness</a>, comfort?</p>
<p>3 - Realize that learning to take the best care of yourself might be what you really need to learn to do.</p>
<p>4 - Surround yourself with caring friends or a therapist who understands that your needs matter and will not judge you about your expecting more.</p>
<p>5 - Take the best possible care of yourself and prepare for the hits in life and the inevitable encounter with yucky people.</p>
<p>Neediness is at times a wake-up call and it might be as simple as realizing that you’re with the wrong person. A good relationship has the following three components:</p>
<p>1 - Chemistry: Some physical, <a>spiritual</a> pull that you just feel.</p>
<p>2 - Soulful connection: You get each other effortlessly and feel like he knows you and loves you and you know him and love him.</p>
<p>3 - Living life on the same page. You both agree on the important things in both of your lives. You both agree on how and where your lives are heading.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself feeling needy, you need to self reflect—are you with the right person and are you where you should be? And be sure to be nice to yourself. "Needy" just might lead you to where you really need to be. </p>

<h2> Commenting about weight can do more harm than good. </h2>

<h1> Say Yikes to the Dress </h1>
<h2> Tips to help choose what to wear to a wedding </h2>
<p>Here are some pragmatic as well as psychological things to think about that might help find that special outfit.</p>
<p>2. Think about choosing something that is close to how you dress most often and what makes you feel most authentic and attractive.</p>
<p>When I finally settled on a dress for my son’s wedding, the best part of my choice was the fact that the dress had pockets allowing me to carry my cell phone and tissues. We all have our priorities! </p>

<p>In light of all the energy and stress that goes into planning a wedding, remember that a wedding is the celebration of love and commitment no matter what you wear.</p>

<h1> Dreading the Holidays? </h1>
<h2> Five tips to help you get through. </h2>
<p>So why are holidays so hard?</p>
<a>anxiety</a> and the array of human emotions. Yes, we should be
<a>grateful</a> of our blessings, but sadness, longing, and emotional pain are all part of the human experience and might very well be present regardless of the fact that it is a holiday.
<h3>Tips to get through the holidays</h3>
<p>2. Something as simple as a reminder of what it is that you’re supposed to be celebrating, the primary meaning of the holiday, might help refocus and reclaim the real reason for the season.</p>
<a>laughter</a> at what I had said—I had no idea what I had actually said in Spanish but it seemed to be just what that family had needed at that awful moment. I was grateful for that moment of service.
<p>4. Invite yourself somewhere. Call a friend who’s having a gathering and ask if you can join them. People usually are happy to include you and realize that they should have thought of it themselves.</p>

<h1> 4 Steps to Making Better Decisions </h1>
<h2> Let your inner wisdom show you the way. </h2>
<p>1. Find a quiet place and time to think. </p>
<p>2. Is this the right time to be making this decision?</p>
<p>Are other important, overwhelming things happening in your life at this same time. If so, consider that you will be seeing things through the lens of confusion and distracted focus.</p>
<p>3. Identify the pragmatic concerns that support a decision.</p>
<p>4. Engage your inner wisdom by imagining possible outcomes.</p>
<a>attention</a> to which decision feels peaceful, joyful or happy and compare it to the decision that feels uneasy, upsetting or agitating. Does the thought of one outcome cause you
<a>panic</a>? How you feel with an imagined outcome is an important consideration when thinking through a decision.

<h1> Five Things You Should Know About Death </h1>
<h2> What to expect to feel when someone dies </h2>
<p>1. It is normal to feel a horrible aching pain and it comes in waves</p>
<p>2. Walking around in a fog is normal</p>
<p>Walking around unable to concentrate and hardly able to remember stuff does happens in the beginning. That foggy, “you’re not yourself” feeling can last awhile but does diminish with time.</p>
<p>3. You might be stuck "bargaining"</p>
<p>Oftentimes people get stuck in what Dr. Elizabeth Kubler-Ross has termed the third stage of grieving—"bargaining." (Kubler-Ross, 1969.)</p>
<p>4. Become familiar with the “stages of grieving.” </p>
<p>Knowing that there are stages of <a>grief</a> that everyone goes through might help to normalize and validate what you’re feeling and going through at the time. Kubler-Ross delineates the five stages of grieving as the following:</p>
<p>Stage 1: <a>Denial</a> and Isolation. It’s normal to feel like you can’t believe it’s true.</p>
<p>Stage 3: Bargaining. Again, the feeling that there was something that could have been done that might have prevented the outcome.</p>
<p>Stage 4: <a>Depression</a>. Expect to feel down and sad. That’s normal when someone dies. Allow yourself to grieve and feel sad.</p>
<p>Stage 5: Acceptance. Finally, there will come a point when you will have learned to live with and accept the loss.</p>
<p>5. It does get better with time</p>
<p>What does happen eventually is that you adjust to the loss and learn how to manage a new normal. We build emotional scar tissue and we learn to function under the new circumstances.</p>
<p>It is particularly important to take really good care of yourself during this time. That means make sure you’re eating well, <a>sleeping</a>, and reaching out for help and support. </p>
<a>resilient</a> and will return to our baselines with the passage of some time.

<p>The following are a few of the things I’ve found in common among my patients and single friends that get in the way of dating:</p>
<li>They feel as if they failed when first dates don’t automatically click. They immediately get sad and discouraged when “living happily ever” doesn't happen right away.</li>
<li>They express feeling that everyone else has “luck with relationships" but they are the exception.</li>
<li>They easily give up on dating.</li>

<h2> 10 ways to take better care of you </h2>
<a>attention</a> to you, not in a
<a>narcissistic</a> way, but in a way that ensures that you are being cared for by you.
<p>Here are 10 ways to exercise self care and take better care of you. </p>
<p>1. Self care means knowing who you are and your limits. Self care means recognizing when you are doing more than you are used to handling and trying to figure out what can be done to slow down.</p>
<a>sleeping</a> at least that much? Making a serious effort to make that happen as well as knowing how to rest your body and your mind are essential.
<a>nutrition</a> throughout your day.
<p>8. Self care means knowing how to decompress after a day's work. That might mean walking home from work to clear your head, driving in silence or listening to music to help transition from work to home. </p>
<a>spiritual</a> self. That might take the form of meditating, praying, communing with nature by a walk in a park, observing a sunset or sunrise, attending a religious service, practicing
<a>gratitude</a>, reading or listening to something inspirational.
<p>10. And finally, self care means taking time to love yourself and appreciating that there's only one you and you're the expert on that. </p>

<h2> Why we bother finding a mate </h2>
<a>psychotherapy</a> sessions, people spend countless hours trying to make sense of their marriages and relationships, working through the unresolved issues and baggage from
<a>caretaking</a>. People fall in love, marry, and oftentimes the relationship ends in disaster. As our culture evolved and women no longer assumed dependent roles in relationships with men, a new contract, so to speak, emerged and roles were redefined.
