<p>But before she had the chance to question Mitchell about fooling around with his family member, Copenhagen discovered that she’d been barred from contacting him via phone and on social media. </p>
<p>“I was expecting to call him when I got back to my dorm,” she said. “But once I got back to my room I found out I was blocked on everything with him.”</p>
<p>And Copenhagen, who never dreamed that her posts would go viral, claims that she shared the <a>stomach-churning story</a> online as a means of coping with the situation. </p>
<p>“I wasn’t expecting to get so many views and likes. It’s kind of overwhelming,” she said. “I’ve just always posted videos as a way to deal with the different things that happen in my life.”</p>
<p>On TikTok, she also shared a screenshot of an outraged Ashley’s angry text message rebuke, bawling her out for airing out their dirty laundry online. </p>
<p>Sympathetic TikTok watchers flooded Copenhagen’s comment section with well wishes and words of comfort. </p>
<p>But the resilient single lady quickly assured her cyber supporters that their pity was totally unnecessary. </p>
<a>dodged that bullet</a>. I was a freshman in college who was going to fall in love with the first person she laid eyes on. And the guy I fall in love with just so happens to be someone who f–ks their sister. So, I’m OK!”
<p>And while this situation hasn’t totally ruined Copenhagen’s desire for romance, the busy scholar says she’s temporarily placing her love life on hold because “I don’t have time for the <a>drama</a>.”</p>

<h1> School bus driver arrested in fatal hit-and-run of Brooklyn teen</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 9:02pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 9:10pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A school bus driver was arrested for fatally striking a 15-year-old girl in Brooklyn on Monday morning, police said.</p>
<p>Aleksandr Patlakh, 55, of Coney Island, was charged with failure to yield to a pedestrian and failure to use due care after he struck and killed Antonina Zatulovska before fleeing the scene at around 10 a.m., cops said.</p>
<p>According to police, Antonina was hit just before 8 a.m. on Monday at the intersection of Bedford Avenue and Avenue P where police found the teen unresponsive lying on the ground with trauma to the head. </p>
<p>She was declared dead at the scene by first responders.</p>
<p>Details on where the teenager was heading were unclear. James Madison High School is located at that intersection, but the city’s public schools were closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day.</p>
<h1> Fresh clues and cops could finally solve gruesome Gilgo Beach murders</h1>
<div> January 10, 2022 6:00am <div> Updated <div> January 7, 2022 6:59pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Melissa Cann last saw her sister Maureen Brainard-Barnes alive in July 2007 when her sibling took the train from Connecticut into Manhattan and vanished.</p>
<p>“It’s been about 15 years since she went missing,” Cann, 37, told The Post. “It is crazy because if feels like it was yesterday. I was only 22.”</p>
<p>“It took up a lot of my time, but I had to come to the realization that I wasn’t going to be the one to find her. I had to sit and wait and that was horrible,” Cann said.</p>
<p>Now Cann, a soft-spoken, married mother of five communicates with detectives weekly — or more often — and still clings to the idea that her sister’s killer will be brought to justice. </p>
<p>“I always feel hopeful. Without hope, what do you have?” she said.</p>
<h2>Law enforcement doubles down</h2>
<p>Renewing her sense of optimism are two recent key personnel changes in Suffolk County — new district attorney Ray Tierney and police commissioner Rodney Harrison.</p>
<p>Cann said the pieces in place are now “solid.” </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Harrison held a press conference at the site of the gruesome dumping ground, vowing to solve the case.</p>
<p>“We will not rest until we bring those accountable to justice,” said Harrison, the former NYPD chief of department.</p>
<p>He added that there were “some great leads that are putting us in a great place to solve this case. We’re getting there but still some work needs to be done to get us across the finish line.”</p>
<p>Lorraine Ela, the mother of victim Megan Waterman, told The Post, she was “kind of skeptical” prior to watching Harrison’s press conference. </p>
<h2>911 call could provide clues</h2>
<p>Harrison also said he would release the 911 call to the public if it didn’t interfere with the police investigation.</p>
<a>previously said that two male voices can be heard in the background, said to be Gilbert’s driver and the man who hired her</a>. (Both have been
<a>Mari, who was killed in 2016</a> by her schizophrenic daughter, Sarra, was given a transcript years ago. Sherre said she knows it would be “difficult to hear my sister’s last words. But anything to help her case.”
<p>She hoped that in releasing the tapes, it would show her sister’s death was no accident and that she was frightened for her life. </p>
<p>And maybe it will provide a useful lead. “We want to know if the public can identify any other voices on the tapes,” Sherre added.</p>
<p>Cops traced some of the calls to Midtown Manhattan and Massapequa, which is 10 miles from Gilgo Beach.</p>
<h2>Theories but no arrests</h2>
<p>Over the years, the case has been saddled with scandals and sideshows that have sullied the investigation — and uncovered corruption among local officials.</p>
<a>Thomas Spota, who was later sentenced to five years</a> in the conspiracy. It was alleged that Burke
<a>stonewalled the FBI</a> from getting involved in the investigation because they knew of his assault.
<a>released images of a black belt</a> tied to one of the victims and believed to have been handled by a suspect. It was embossed with the initials “WH” or “HM.” They also launched
<a>Netflix’s 2020 movie “Lost Girls,</a>” based on a 2013 book by Robert Kolker delving into the lives of the victims. It’s also ignited the imagination of true-crime sleuths and produced a number of unfounded theories.
<a>filed a wrongful death suit against him in 2012</a>. Hackett has denied involvement and the suit was tossed in 2018.)
<p>Cann said she doesn’t buy any of the theories.</p>
<p>“I want people to say if they saw my sister in New York City. I want them to put in a tip. Don’t think about the names that have been floated. There hasn’t been a suspect yet.”</p>
<p>Sherre echoed those sentiments: “We want to keep the public involved and get justice. They all deserve justice, not just Shannan.”</p>
<p>And as more time goes by since her loved one’s disappearance, Ela confronts another tough calendar milestone later this month.</p>
<p>“Megan’s birthday is January 18, and she would have been 34,” Ela wrote. “But [she’s] forever 22.”</p>

<h1> Diet secrets from the world’s healthiest countries</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> March 7, 2017 6:06pm <div> Updated <div> July 26, 2017 9:50am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Want to live a long, healthy life? Move to South Korea.</p>
<p>The good news: The study predicts life expectancy will increase in all 35 countries. South Korea is expected to take the top spot for both women and men, with projected life expectancies of 90.8 and 84, respectively.</p>
<p>The bad news: The USA came in dead last in its cohort, with the lowest predicted life expectancy out of all high-income industrialized countries — an average of 83.3 years for women, and 79.5 years for men.</p>
<p>Below, the life-extending staples that keep these top countries ticking.</p>
<p>Bennett cites Korea’s traditional diet as one reason why its citizens are expected to live so long.</p>
<p>Other South Korean staples include bibimbap, a popular dish of rice, vegetables, red pepper paste, egg and a small amount of meat.</p>
<p>“It goes down so easily, and it’s full of healthy foods,” says nutritionist Joshua Rosenthal, founder of NYC’s Institute for Integrative Nutrition.</p>
<p>Plus, says Bennett, South Korea’s recent economic growth has made health care more accessible “across the whole population,” leading to “huge gains” in its life expectancy standing.</p>
<p>But the French generally consume foods differently than Americans, opting for smaller portion sizes eaten at mealtimes, rather than snacks or binges.</p>
<p>It also helps that they tend to see meals as social events.</p>
<p>And staying connected with friends and family has been shown to aid in healthy aging — as does the easy access to health care and social services that the French enjoy.</p>
<blockquote><p>No one is crazier about the freshness of fish than the Japanese.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many Japanese meals start with miso soup, made from probiotic-rich miso paste and topped with seaweed, which contains high amounts of vitamins and minerals such as iodine and calcium.</p>
<p>Other diet staples include rice, vegetables and small amounts of fresh, omega-3-packed, heart- and brain-healthy fish.</p>
<p>“No one is crazier about the freshness of fish than the Japanese,” says Rosenthal.</p>
<p>And green tea, consumed throughout Japan, is rich in antioxidants and EGCG, a polyphenol that may help prevent against certain cancers.</p>
<p>Australians are proof that “it’s not only what you eat — it’s about your lifestyle,” says Rosenthal. Australian men born in 2030 have a projected expectancy of 84 years, women 87.6.</p>
<p>Australia has an obesity problem that rivals our own, but its residents tend to be more active and spend more time outdoors than Americans.</p>
<p>Australians are also “doing quite well with reducing their smoking,” says Bennett — an important step in preventing early death.</p>
<p>Starchy pastries and chocolate abound in Switzerland, where the projected life span for 2030 is 84 years for men and 87.7 for women. But such treats are balanced out by one of the healthiest foods around: yogurt.</p>
<p>And the Swiss typically reach for full-fat, no-sugar-added varieties, which can be more filling and easier for the body to digest.</p>
<p>But Rosenthal says it’s not just the Swiss food that matters — it’s the fresh Alps atmosphere.</p>
<p>“The quality of the air you’re breathing makes an enormous difference,” he says.</p>
<h2>USA: Last for high-income industrialized countries</h2>
<p>Kimchee and yogurt may be appearing on more American plates than ever, but that’s not likely to move the needle by 2030.</p>
<h1> Mom goes to war against father’s Jewish ‘cult’ to protect her children</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 19, 2018 10:41pm <div> Updated <div> December 19, 2018 11:11pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Her home was a remote, guarded compound in Guatemala featuring makeshift houses with wood pellets for floors, plastic bags over two-by-fours for walls and tin sheets for ceilings.</p>
<p>There was no air conditioning, no hot water and, until recently, no toilets.</p>
<p>But Sara Helbrans, 32, didn’t start making waves until earlier this year, when she was told her then-13-year-old daughter would be marrying the son of a community leader, according to filings she submitted to a Brooklyn court.</p>
<p>Sara spoke up, and her world collapsed, setting off a chain of deeply disturbing events that have now resulted in a court custody battle and the reported arrest of five former community leaders, including her brother.</p>
<p>Helbrans alleges the group from which she escaped is a cult — and she and her six kids are in desperate need of protection.</p>
<p>“I am very imminently afraid from the cult and what the [children’s] father and other cult members may do now that we are no longer under their power and manipulation,” the frantic mom wrote in the court filing.</p>
<p>“The cult,’’ as Helbrans calls it, is a religious Jewish group known as Lev Tahor, or “Pure Heart’’ in Hebrew.</p>
<p>And until she fled, it had provided the mom with the only life she had ever known: Her father, Shlomo Helbrans, founded the group in Jerusalem in 1987.</p>
<p>But critics say Lev Tahor is more persecutor than proselytizer.</p>
<p>Denis Baraby, the former director of Laurentides’ Youth Protection Services, which has investigated Lev Tahor, told The Post he witnessed alarming conditions during visits to some Lev Tahor homes.</p>
<p>There were holes in the floors, urine-soaked mattresses and bugs — with rarely a toy in sight, he said.</p>
<p>“Medical services, proper hygiene, proper food was not provided for these children,” Baraby said, adding he and his co-workers were “shocked by the children’s living conditions.’’</p>
<p>He said the Quebec Youth Court was ready to grant his agency oversight of two Lev ­Tahor families with 14 kids between them but couldn’t execute the order because the secretive community had already fled.</p>
<p>A former member who escaped from the community in 2012 told The Post that group leaders forced him to live in a closet for 10 days as punishment for arguing when he was 8.</p>
<p>There were holes in the floors, urine-soaked mattresses and bugs — with rarely a toy in sight.</p>
<p>The young man’s only reprieve during that span was for bouts of public denigration, he said.</p>
<p>“Throughout the seven months, the only thing I could think about was, ‘I want to go, I want to go, I want to go.’ ”</p>
<p>Because he was seen as too rebellious to reform, his request for freedom was eventually granted, according to David.</p>
<p>So one night, he signed papers nullifying his engagement to a teenage girl in the community and promising not to speak ill of the group.</p>
<p>Then he hopped into a taxi bound for New York.</p>
<p>By last year, Lev Tahor had resettled once again, this time near the small city of Oratorio in Guatemala — and with a new leader.</p>
<p>Shlomo Helbrans had drowned in a river on a trip to Mexico in 2017.</p>
<p>His son, Sara’s brother Nachman Helbrans, took over the leadership role along with a group of associates, sources and Sara’s court filings said.</p>
<p>Even with those family connections, however, Sara’s complaints about her young daughter’s arranged marriage weren’t well received.</p>
<p>The mom, who through associates declined to comment to The Post, alleged in the court papers that she was instantly ostracized by her community, separated from her husband and children and ordered to perform the most menial of tasks.</p>
<p>“They tortured her. She wasn’t allowed to talk to anyone,” said a source familiar with the alleged incidents. “She was forced to clean toilets.”</p>
<p>Sara was finally told to leave and renounce custody of her kids, according to her court filing.</p>
<p>She refused. Instead, early on Oct. 5, 2018, she quietly hunted for her children in the homes where they had been living in a bid to rescue them.</p>
<p>“She tried grabbing all her kids, but since her kids were with different families, she only found” three, Yakov Flitchkin, a Jewish-community activist in Brooklyn, told The Post, referring to Helbrans’ 10-, 8-and 5-year-olds.</p>
<p>The mom grabbed the children she could locate and “ran for her life,’’ said Flitchkin, a friend of Sara’s family who flew down to Guatemala to assist in October.</p>
<p>The kids were discovered with their father in Mexico 10 days later, according to Sara’s court filings.</p>
<p>The dad, with whom The Post unsuccessfully tried to speak, was detained and the children flown to Brooklyn by an advocate for Sara, sources and the court filings said.</p>
<p>The mom was already in the borough with supporters, as were her other three children.</p>
<p>But Sara’s mind was not eased.</p>
<p>At least one of Lev Tahor’s leaders, who identified himself to The Post as Shmiel Weingarten, arrived in Brooklyn from Guatemala after Sara and the kids did, according to associates of the mom.</p>
<p>On Nov. 20, in response to Sara’s court filing, he filed a petition on behalf of Yante in which she purportedly requested to live with her father or be emancipated from both parents so she could return to Guatemala.</p>
<p>The filing included allegations against Sara of abuse, which ­allegedly intensified after Shlomo Helbrans’ death.</p>
<p>“She would beat the children much more because of anger, and the house became a nightmare, until my father had no other choice but to send the children to other families from time to time,” says the petition filed in Yante’s name.</p>
<p>Flitchkin dismissed the allegations, saying the group often makes counterclaims of abuse against escapees.</p>
<p>Weingarten told The Post his group considers the children kidnapped from their father.</p>
<p>He denied all claims of abuse and mistreatment of children in Lev Tahor that have been leveled over the years, saying the stories were being whipped up solely to destroy the group.</p>
<p>He cut off contact after learning that The Post had been in touch with Sara’s supporters.</p>
<p>Then, nearly two weeks ago, Sara and all of her kids were supposed to be together upstate to relax and try to strengthen the bonds that had been weakened by months of hardship.</p>
<p>She has custody of the children pending a Jan. 3 hearing, and she also received an order of protection against her husband, who still belongs to the group, according to court documents.</p>
<p>But at about 3:30 a.m. on Saturday, Dec. 8, Yante and Chaim were spotted hopping into a car outside the Fallsburg home of friends with whom the family had been staying in the Catskills.</p>
<p>Local and state police have since warned officials at a regional New Jersey airport about the disappearance of the children.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Nachman Helbrans and four other Lev Tahor leaders and members were arrested in a joint operation involving the FBI and Interpol in Mexico, according to The ­Yeshiva World.</p>
<p>FBI officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>As of late Wednesday, however, the two kids were still missing — leaving their mother distraught, according to Flitchkin.</p>
<p>Sara “is very concerned about the kids,’’ he said. “It’s not an easy time for her.”</p>

<h1> San Francisco cancels New Year’s Eve fireworks over COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 29, 2021 1:48pm <div> Updated <div> December 29, 2021 1:49pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>New Year’s Eve in San Francisco will be much quieter this year.</p>
<p>The city, citing a rise in coronavirus cases fueled by the omicron variant, has announced the cancellation of its annual fireworks show in order to “best protect San Franciscans and essential front-line workers.” </p>
<p>“By canceling the New Year’s Eve fireworks show we are reducing everyone’s exposure to COVID-19, while ensuring continuity of citywide public safety operations,” she added. </p>
<p>The “annual fireworks show at the Embarcadero requires increased deployments for critical public safety staff like police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and 9-1-1 dispatchers,” the city also said. </p>
<p>Despite the cancellation, San Francisco allowed 18,064 spectators into the Chase Center on Tuesday night for an NBA game between the Golden State Warriors and Denver Nuggets.</p>
<p>San Francisco’s cancellation also comes after New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio scaled back plans for the iconic ball drop in Times Square. </p>
<p>Those who want to attend this year’s New Year festivities in the Big Apple will have to be fully vaccinated, wear face masks and practice social distancing measures. </p>

<h1> Model Luna Benna claims she’s ‘too hot’ so Tinder banned her for catfishing</h1>
<div> November 10, 2020 10:22am <div> Updated <div> November 10, 2020 11:12am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Too hot to have a handle?</p>
<p>An Instagram model claims she’s been booted from Tinder because the dating app thought her sexy photos were fake.</p>
<p>“I’m too hot for Tinder,” said Luna Benna, 21 an Illinois Instagram model with 1.2 million followers who lives in Florida and reportedly makes oodles of cash on her racy OnlyFans account, @luna.benna.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the few Tinder dates the model did go through with all ended in disaster. Benna recounts one “super awkward experience” when her match said her “presence was so powerful it made him uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“There’s so many fake profiles out there, whenever I start a legit account I get reported and Tinder has me taken down,” lamented the distraught model.</p>
<p>Tinder didn’t immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment on Benna’s alleged exile. However, the dating app does prohibit “nudity” and “sexually explicit content,” per the community guidelines.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, knockoff accounts have proliferated — in part because Benna said she’s “been on the internet forever so they have lots of options to work with.”</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 5</div> </div> </div>
<p>“Some of those profiles using my pictures — so it looks like me, but with fake names, like Jessica, Amber or Natalie — refer to themselves as escorts or prostitutes,” said the horrified adult streaming content star.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, attempts to confront catfishers only resulted in Benna being blocked, and also motivated them to appear more “authentic” when they knew she was wise to their ruse.</p>
<p>“I just need to keep reminding myself I can’t do anything about it,” said the model, adding that “catfishing is inevitable.”</p>
<p>One upside to Benna’s otherwise tumultuous Tinder stint was that she was finally able to find a boyfriend before being booted.</p>
<p>“We both were into photography and modeling and saw an opportunity in the industry where we both are today,” said Benna. “And we work together on my Instagram and OnlyFans content. We’re pretty much a power couple.”</p>
<p>In a similar instance in February, a Los Angeles Instagram model was suspended from Tinder after potential matches thought she too hot to be real.</p>
<h1> McAuliffe takes Loudoun County amid growing tensions between parents, school boards</h1>
<div> November 2, 2021 9:28pm <div> Updated <div> November 2, 2021 9:29pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe appeared to quickly take Loudoun County in the race for governor in Virginia Tuesday night, amid growing tensions in the county between parents and school officials.</p>
<p>In the 2020 Presidential election, Biden won the county with 61.5 percent of the vote, beating Trump who had 36.5 percent.</p>
<p>Loudoun county has yet to count all of the mail-in ballots submitted — as Virginia law allows ballots postmarked by Election Day to be counted so long as they arrive by noon on Nov. 5 — however, those are anticipated to favor McAuliffe.</p>
<a>One expert predicted </a>the Democrat needed to win Loudoun county by 14 percent to hold a lead over Youngkin. 
<p>As education and schooling <a>remained a major issue</a> for voters throughout the election, Loudoun County was a hot spot for parents voicing their concerns against school boards.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a>parents demanded a superintendent </a>and school board resign following allegations they lied and tried to cover up the sexual assault of a female student earlier this year.</p>
<p>Last week, a 15-year-old boy was <a>found guilty of sexually assaulting the girl</a> in a female bathroom at Stone Bridge High School.</p>
<p>During his campaign, Youngkin garnered massive support from parents as he promoted parents’ rights to voice their concerns about mask mandates and specific curriculum being taught, such as critical race theory or sexually explicit novels.</p>
<p>McAuliffe lost more support from parents during a September debate when he said “I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.” The former governor has since defended his comments.</p>

<h1> Prince Andrew sued in New York by Virginia Roberts for alleged sex assault</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> August 9, 2021 1:43pm <div> Updated <div> August 10, 2021 9:16am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre filed a lawsuit against Prince Andrew in Manhattan federal court Monday — accusing the royal of sexually assaulting her at the pedophile’s homes when she was a “child.”</p>
<p>Giuffre, who is seeking unspecified damages for battery and infliction of emotional distress, said the embattled blueblood abused her at least three times while she was 17.</p>
<p>Each time, Giufrre alleges, she was instructed by either Epstein or his alleged cohort, Ghislaine Maxwell, to engage in sex acts with the Duke of York. </p>
<p>On one occasion detailed in the suit, Giufrre says she was forced to have sex with the prince at Maxwell’s London home. </p>
<p>“During this encounter, Epstein, Maxwell, and Prince Andrew forced Plaintiff, a child, to have sexual intercourse with Prince Andrew against her will,” the suit states. </p>
<p>She also was abused by the prince alongside another victim at Epstein’s Upper East Side mansion, according to the suit. </p>
<p>“On another occasion, Prince Andrew sexually abused Plaintiff on Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Little St. James,” it adds. </p>
<p>Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, wrote in the suit she “feared death or physical injury to herself” if she disobeyed Epstein and Maxwell’s orders. </p>
<p>Before filing the suit, Boies told the Daily Mail that he planned to file the action against the prince — who has long been accused of abuse by Giuffre. </p>
<p>“To use a common phrase here in the United States, ‘Time’s up,’ ” Boies told the outlet of the potential legal action.</p>
<p>Andrew’s legal team has ignored two formal legal letters offering to sign a “tolling agreement” that would extend the statute of limitations and allow negotiations to continue, Boies said.</p>
<p>“This could be devastating for Andrew,” a source told the UK outlet of the suit.</p>
<a>embarrassing documents</a> released from her settled lawsuit with Giuffre.
<p>“If he ignores it, he could be found guilty in absentia, which would be a public-relations disaster,” the source added of the prince.</p>
<p>The Duke of York has always denied having sex with Giuffre — even <a>denying knowing her</a> and questioning the authenticity of a <a>now-notorious photo</a> of them hugging.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace has also <a>“emphatically denied</a> that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts.”</p>
<p>“Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation,” the royals have said.</p>
<p>A rep for Andrew declined to comment.</p>
<p>In a statement after the suit was filed, Giuffre said she took the legal action to hold the prince accountable. </p>
<p>Epstein <a>hanged himself</a> in his Manhattan lockup in August 2019 while awaiting trial on serious sex charges.</p>
<p>Maxwell is in custody in Brooklyn awaiting trial for allegedly recruiting underage girls for Epstein. She has pleaded not guilty.</p>
<h1> Trump’s niece says ruling in Prince Andrew case helps her suit</h1>
<div> January 13, 2022 2:11pm <div> Updated <div> January 13, 2022 2:23pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Donald Trump’s niece says a recent ruling in the sexual abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew bolsters her own case against the former president over her inheritance. </p>
<a> accuses her family of swindling her</a> out of her full inheritance, is a 2001 settlement agreement that Donald Trump
<a>has argued releases him and the Trump family from her claims.</a>
<p>Mary Trump’s lawyers have opposed the former president’s motion to dismiss her case, claiming her lawyer at the time of the 2001 settlement was colluding with her family to deceive her and get her to agree to a bad deal.</p>
<p>Mary Trump’s lawyers argued that the case needed to play out and information needed to be exchanged between both sides before a judge could decide on whether the settlement let her family off the hook for her claims.</p>
<p>Roberta Kaplan and lawyers for Donald Trump and his siblings did not immediately return requests for comment.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> August 5, 2021 2:07pm <div> Updated <div> August 5, 2021 2:29pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>If you want to vacation like a Jedi, you’re going to need some serious Imperial Credit.</p>
<p>Disney released pricing details for its new two-night Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser hotel experience at its Florida resort — and it is expensive.</p>
<p>The two-night stay on the “Halcyon starcruiser” starts at $4,809 on weeknights for the most modest package, a two-guest cabin, according to the voyage’s website. </p>
<p>For a three-guest cabin the price rises to $5,299, and for a four-guest cabin it’s a $5,999 “voyage total.” Suite pricing for four or more passengers was not listed on the website. </p>
<p>The experience begins when guests, who will join either the Resistance or a smuggling ring, enter a “launch pod” and “jump into hyperspace” to board the starcruiser, The Post reported. </p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 2</div> </div> </div>
<p>The pod docks, the “airlock” opens and guests, who are encouraged to buy and don costumes, step into the atrium to begin their custom journey, according to the website. </p>
<p>When guests find their cabins, they should look out the porthole — every window on the ship has a view of the galaxy that changes as the voyage continues, according to the website. </p>
<p>The resort is slated to open in spring 2022. </p>

<h1> Inside Teresa Giudice’s new $3.3M NJ house with boyfriend Luis Ruelas</h1>
<div> February 16, 2021 2:33pm <div> Updated <div> February 16, 2021 4:15pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The couple’s “Clarence Manor” purchase is a “business” investment — not their new love nest, TMZ reported. </p>
<p>Giudice will be the property manager of the Montville home, which is only three doors down from the house the 48-year-old “RHONJ” star shared with her ex-husband, Joe Giudice, 48.</p>
<p>Now, the reality television star has a new relationship with Digital Media Solutions co-founder Ruelas. Giudice and her chiseled new beau <a>began dating in November</a> after her <a>divorce from Joe was finalized</a> in September.</p>
<p>The kitchen has nine Tiffany glass light fixtures, granite countertops and top-of-the-line appliances. There is plenty of prep room, between the center kitchen island and the additional seating and preparation area. </p>
<p>There is a large walk-in pantry and a butler’s pantry, a breakfast area with a chandelier and a pair of French doors that open to an outdoor summer kitchen, according to the listing. </p>
<p>Next to the theater is a recreation room with a billiard table, a gas fireplace and French doors that lead to the backyard, according to the listing. </p>
<p>The house was built in 2006 for $2.28 million by its previous owners, Lisa and Salvatore LoBiondo, according to New Jersey property records, who, with the cost of the land in 2003, made a slim profit on the sale. </p>
<p>Giudice recently tried to sell the nearby Montville home she shared with her ex-husband, The Post <a>previously reported</a>, but it is unclear if she has pulled it off the market.</p>
<a>shopping his own dating show</a> — raised their four kids in the home until 2015, when the couple was convicted and ultimately
<a>jailed</a> for fraud, which led to Joe’s deportation to Italy and the end of their marriage,
<a>Page Six</a> previously reported.
<p>Coldwell Banker broker Joshua Baris represented both sides of the deal but declined to comment. </p>
<h1> Why ‘RHONJ’s’ Teresa Giudice needed to sell NJ house built with Joe</h1>
<div> March 4, 2021 3:00pm <div> Updated <div> March 4, 2021 3:45pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“The Real Housewives of New Jersey” star Teresa Giudice is opening up about her decision to sell her longtime Montville, New Jersey, home.</p>
<p>The reality star, 48, revealed on the show’s March 3 episode that the home she spent nearly 20 years in was becoming too much to bear.</p>
<p>Teresa initially purchased the home with her ex-husband, Joe Giudice, in 2002 for $530,000.</p>
<p>“It’s hard for me to sell the house,” she revealed on camera in a confessional. “[My ex-husband] Joe and I built the house together; we raised our four daughters in that home.” </p>
<p>“I am ready for a new beginning,” she added. “I’m looking for a fresh start.”</p>
<p>Two months before the home hit the market, Teresa brought in interior designer Jimmy DeLaurentis to completely change up the home’s decor.</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 5</div> </div> </div>
<p>Teresa and Joe, 50, raised their four kids in the home until 2015, when the couple was convicted and ultimately jailed for bankruptcy fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud and failing to pay taxes. </p>
<p>The home is now on the market for $2,248,888. </p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 6</div> </div> </div>
<p>As Page Six reported, Joe completed a 41-month sentence for mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud in March 2019, but was immediately transferred to ICE custody.</p>
<p>He was ordered to be deported to Italy in October 2018, since he was not a US citizen when he committed the crimes.</p>
<p>Months after he was deported, Teresa filed for divorce.</p>
<a>began dating in November</a> after her 
<a>divorce from Joe was finalized</a>.

<h1> Teresa Giudice finally finds buyer for her longtime $2.2M NJ house she built with Joe</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> March 25, 2021 6:19pm <div> Updated <div> March 26, 2021 5:28pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>It’s the end of an era for Teresa and Joe Giudice, who have finally found a buyer for their longtime $2.2 million Montville, New Jersey, mansion, The Post can report. </p>
<p>She also brought in interior designer Jimmy DeLaurentis to completely change up the home’s decor.</p>
<p>An offer was made Monday, and the house is currently under contract. However, a source tells The Post it could take a couple of months before the deal on the property closes.</p>
<p>A rep for Giudice has not responded to The Post’s request for comment.</p>
<p>Teresa initially purchased the home with her now-ex-husband, 50, in 2002 for $530,000. That leaves the former couple a hefty profit of $1,718,000, minus any upgrade costs. </p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 9</div> </div> </div>
<p>Spanning almost 10,000 square feet, the home is situated on 3.7 acres and is made up of six bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Teresa revealed her decision to sell the house was bittersweet, but it was something she had to do to move on.</p>
<p>“It’s hard for me to sell the house,” she revealed on camera in a confessional. “[My ex-husband] Joe and I built the house together; we raised our four daughters in that home.”</p>
<p>“I am ready for a new beginning,” she said. “I’m looking for a fresh start.”</p>
<p>And a fresh start is exactly what she will get. Teresa has since moved on with her new boyfriend, Luis Ruelas. </p>
<p>They purchased a table-flipping $3.35 million “investment property.” Ruelas, 46, reportedly funded the purchase. </p>
<p>It’s unclear at this time where Teresa and her four girls will move next, while Joe remains in Italy. </p>

<h1> Teresa Giudice’s pending house offer falls through, $2.25M home relists</h1>
<div> December 1, 2021 1:07pm <div> Updated <div> December 1, 2021 3:19pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Teresa Giudice can’t seem to shake off her past just yet.</p>
<p>After nine long months under contract, the “Real Housewives of New Jersey” star’s longtime home she bought with ex-husband Joe Giudice is back on the market after the sale fell through, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>Initially pending an offer since last March, the six-bedroom, 5 ½-bathroom mansion has sat in escrow for longer than usual.</p>
<p>The home was first listed back in September 2020 for $2.5 million. It later received a $250,000 price cut when no offers were made.</p>
<p>Just before Thanksgiving, the home was back on the market for $2,248,888.</p>
<p>The Post has reached out to Teresa’s reps for comment.</p>
<p>Situated on almost 4 acres of land, the stone and stucco structure spans 10,000 square feet.</p>
<p>Upon entry is a Cinderella staircase that leads to the primary suite, two other bedroom suites, two additional bedrooms, an office and a family/game room.</p>
<p>The primary suite is complete with a fireplace, a dressing area, three walk-in closets and a primary bathroom suite made with onyx tile throughout.</p>
<p>Exterior features include a covered patio, a lush landscaped backyard and an in-ground pool.</p>
<p>Last spring, Teresa opened up about her decision to sell the marital home she shared with Joe. </p>
<p>“It’s hard for me to sell the house,” she <a>revealed on camera</a> in a “RHONJ” confessional. “[My ex-husband] Joe and I built the house together; we raised our four daughters in that home.”</p>
<p>“I am ready for a new beginning,” she added. “I’m looking for a fresh start.”</p>

<h1> Disney removes video for pricey ‘Star Wars’ hotel amid fan backlash</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 13, 2021 2:10pm <div> Updated <div> December 13, 2021 3:10pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Disney quietly yanked a video for its new Star Wars-themed hotel that promised an immersive adventure — for more than $1,200 a night — after fans slammed the lodging as subpar and too expensive.</p>
<p>Fans apparently weren’t impressed by the final product shared on social media at the end of November.</p>
<p>“The ‘light saber training’ looks about as exciting as a roadside sobriety test,” one Disney watcher commented on YouTube. “It’s way too expensive,” another said.</p>
<p>Disney did not immediately return requests from The Post for comment.</p>
<a>a bizarre low-fi promo video</a> sent to customers who already had booked a stay at the new property. The video apparently didn’t match expectations that had been juiced by Disney’s marketing.
<p>It sparked a firestorm of criticism from fans. It features a purple-faced female alien concierge explaining various activities that are available onboard the Halcyon Starcruiser, the “ship” that guests will be boarding. </p>
<p>A static-filled video shows the concierge detailing some of the activities available during the stay while she taps on a device that looks similar to an iPhone, which beams low-resolution hologram images as she speaks. </p>
<p>“The Star Wars Hotel lady is using an iPhone as a portable hologram thing,” <a>tweeted</a> an upset Disney fan. </p>
<p>“Bro this isn’t Star Wars, this is “Space Conflicts”. Who … approved this for a $6,000 hotel experience?,” <a>tweeted</a> another angry fan.</p>
<p>“I realize now Disney didn’t make the Galactic Starcruiser for Star Wars lovers. They made it for rich people who think Star Wars is neat,” <a>wrote</a> one fan. </p>
<a> in a video</a>. “It’s not clickbait when I say I believe this two-night immersive experience is going to go down as one of the biggest flops that Disney Parks has ever seen.”
<p>Reservations booked up quickly when the hotel was announced, but now, as the 90-day deadline to cancel approaches, customers appear to be canceling their expensive commitments. </p>
<p>According to Disney’s website, a number of openings have begun popping up in March, April and June. </p>

<h1> Disney+ hits a speed bump and investors nail sell button</h1>
<div> November 10, 2021 5:45pm <div> Updated <div> November 10, 2021 5:45pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Disney’s fourth-quarter earnings missed Wall Street expectations Wednesday, as the company’s fast-growing streaming service, Disney+, hit a speed bump.</p>
<p>Shares of the Mouse House fell nearly 5 percent in after-hours trading on the news. </p>
<p>The company said it added 2.1 million Disney+ subscribers, giving it a total of 118.1 million customers at the end of the fourth quarter. Analysts expected 126.2 million customers. </p>
<p>Despite the slowdown in streaming, the global reopening has benefited Disney’s theme parks, experiences and products business, which includes Disney World and Disneyland. </p>
<p>The company said the division produced operating income for the first time since the pandemic began in the fiscal third quarter, and this unit was expected to remain profitable in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Overall, net income attributable to the company was $159 million, or 9 cents a share, compared with a loss of $710 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Even though the Burbank, Calif.-based company missed expectations, Disney CEO Bob Chapek lauded the improvements that the company has made since the <a>pandemic took a stranglehold on its business</a>. </p>
<p>Calling 2021 a “very productive year” for the company, Chapek said Disney has made “great strides in reopening” its businesses. </p>
<p>Despite a slowdown in Disney+’s subscriber growth, the CEO added: “We remain focused on managing our DTC [direct-to-consumer] business for the long term, not quarter to quarter.”</p>
<p>Disney expects Disney+’s subscriber growth to ramp up in the second half of fiscal 2022, as more original shows and movies will be added to the platform across its brands, including Disney, Marvel and Pixar. </p>
<h1> Disneyland raises single-day ticket prices, citing ‘strong’ demand</h1>
<div> October 26, 2021 11:13am <div> Updated <div> October 26, 2021 11:13am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Disney calls it the “Happiest Place on Earth,” but your bank account may beg to differ.</p>
<a>reopened at limited capacity</a>.
<p>The Anaheim, California-based theme park said it is raising its single-day ticket price for the most popular times to a whopping $164 for admission to one park.</p>
<p>While Disney did not change its cheapest ticket, which costs $104 for a one-day, one-park ticket, the company said that price tag is only available on the park’s least popular days, like weekdays when school is in session.</p>
<p>That marks a 6.5 percent increase over the price of top-tier tickets previously, according to pricing data collected by <a>Disney travel website LaughingPlace.com.</a></p>
<p>A ticket called the “park hopper” pass, which allows customers to enter one theme park a day, jumped to $224 for a peak time ticket, while a two-day park hopper pass, which used to cost $290, is now $319, up nearly 9 percent. </p>
<p>Disney said with the price changes, the resort is “offering guests more ticket choices to meet a variety of budgets as it moves closer to dynamic pricing designed to spread visitation throughout the weeks, months and year.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Disney hiked the price of parking by 20 percent to $30. The price changes take hold in March.</p>
<p>Overall, ticket prices are getting hiked between 3 percent and 9 percent, depending on the ticket type, length of stay and time of year the customer visits. </p>
<p>It’s the first ticket price hike at Disneyland since before the pandemic; increases went into effect in February 2020, shortly before the parks shut down.</p>
<h1> Disney swings to a $710M loss as pandemic crushes parks business</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> November 12, 2020 5:47pm </div>
<p>Disney’s swung to a $710 million loss in the fourth quarter as its theme parks and movie business continued to get crushed by the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the pandemic has most significantly impacted Disney’s parks division, which has forced temporary closures or limited capacity, putting a stranglehold on sales.</p>
<a>has remained closed</a>. As a result, the company’s theme park division saw its revenue dip 61 percent to $2.6 billion.
<a>“Black Widow,” starring Scarlett Johansson, were pushed into 2021</a>. On the bright side, Chapek said Disney has restarted or completed all the productions that were halted pre-COVID.
<p>Elsewhere, Disney’s media networks division, which includes ESPN, ABC and FX, saw an 11 percent increase in revenue to $7.2 billion, due in part to lower programming and production costs.</p>

<h1> Daisy Duck shakes it to Beyoncé on a Disney cruise</h1>
<div> January 5, 2022 8:00pm <div> Updated <div> January 5, 2022 8:08pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Daisy Duck was caught getting wild over the New Year when she was spotted dancing on a Disney Magic cruise.</p>
<p>User Lesley S on TikTok, posted a hilarious one-minute clip of several employees dressed as Disney characters breaking it down to Queen Bey’s hit “Run the World (Girls).”</p>
<p>“Daisy [Duck] was dancing her tail off to Beyoncé at the New Year’s Deck party,” the video said.</p>
<p>Donald Duck, Mickey and Minnie Mouse also joined in on the fun. The characters rang in the New Year by gyrating and moving to the beat. </p>
<p>The video has garnered more than 1.3 million viewers so far and more than 235,000 likes.</p>
<p>Several people gushed in the comments section, with one writing: “Shake a tail feather has a whole new meaning!” Another added, “STARTING MY 2022 WITH THIS ENERGY!”</p>
<p>Lesley (whose full name is Lesley Sawhook), spoke to <a>Newsweek</a> about the wild moment. She revealed that Mickey and the rest of the motley Disney crew took turns dancing and each got featured in a song. </p>
<p>When it was Daisy’s time to shine, people could be heard shouting: “Go Daisy, Go Daisy, Go Daisy.” By the end of the snap, she brought out Minnie to dance and they took center stage.</p>
<p>While Sawhook revealed that she goes to Disney parks several times a year and has been on at least 13 Disney cruises, she admittedly has never seen “anything like this before.”</p>
<p>“It was so much fun so I definitely wanted to post it,” she quipped.</p>
<h1> The clever way Disney stops crowds from forming in their theme parks</h1>
<div> January 6, 2022 1:23pm <div> Updated <div> January 7, 2022 12:30pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Thousands of people flock to Disney theme parks every day.</p>
<p>But there is a clever way that crowds are prevented from building up — although it might make some visitors feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Visitors to Disney theme parks can wear wristbands, called magic bands, which are used to gain access to the parks, as hotel room keys and to make payments at shops and restaurants.</p>
<p>According to a Disney super fan called The Mouselets on TikTok, each magic band contains a chip so when the band is placed on a touchpoint, such as a hotel room door, the chip will be read and the door will open.</p>
<p>Disney has placed sensors all over the park that pick up the number of magic bands in the vicinity, including in ride queues, so staff can see exactly how busy areas are getting.</p>
<p>That means staff can monitor where crowds are building and try to disperse them.</p>
<p>Until last year, magic bands were free for all Disney resort guests, but now they cost between $20 and $58, so if people don’t choose to buy them, the crowd monitoring isn’t as accurate.</p>
<p>TikTok user @themouselets shared a video explaining the different ways Disney stops crowds from forming.</p>
<p>She said: “This is the coolest thing that Disney can do with your magic band – they can actually perform crowd control.”</p>
<p>“Disney knows where you are at all times because your magic band has a tracker.”</p>
<p>“So, when a big crowd starts to form, Disney can be ahead of it. They actually have an entire team devoted to monitoring crowds.”</p>
<p>“When a big crowd forms, they’ll address the issue as quickly as possible by adding characters, opening up additional space in restaurants, and adjusting wait times and ride queues.”</p>
<p>The video has been watched 363,000 times, with viewers confirming that the bands don’t contain trackers, just sensors.</p>
<p>A former cast member commented: “They don’t have trackers… there are sensors in the queue that read magic bands when you pass them.”</p>
<p>“It helps with managing waiting times.”</p>
<p>Another person wrote: “Not really, it’s not a tracker. It has a chip that can be read if you’re in the general area of a reader.”</p>

<p>Disney is experiencing a Figment popcorn bucket frenzy as fans lined up for seven hours to purchase $25 containers that are now selling for $200 on eBay.</p>
<p>The EPCOT International Festival of the Arts began on Friday and Disney fans were so excited for the new limited-edition Figment popcorn buckets that they arrived hours before the park opened.</p>
<p>The buckets, which resemble Figment, were only being sold at one part of the park.</p>
<p>Figment is the mascot of the Imagination! Pavilion at Walt Disney World Resort’s Epcot theme park.</p>
<p>He’s a small purple dragon who is occasionally spotted wearing a yellow sweater and appears on a number of Epcot merchandise.</p>
<p>Figment has appeared in a series of Epcot Educational Media short videos for schools, as well as two Marvel Comics’ Disney Kingdoms brand comic book series. </p>
<p>Disneygoers lined up on Friday at the Pop Eats booth located near the entrance of Epcot’s World Showcase, Insider reports.</p>
<p>Shocking footage from Blog Mickey revealed the seemingly never-ending line before the park opened.</p>
<p>Another video, shared by WDW News Today, showed what looks like hundreds of people waiting in line.</p>
<p>“The line for the Figment popcorn bucket has a quoted 6.5-7 hour wait, and stretches from Pop Eats, to World Showcase Promenade, to Test Track, then to the EPCOT Experience,” WDW News Today tweeted.</p>
<p>Disney fan Ashley Ebey, who purposely stayed at the Polynesian Villiage Resort to have a quick commute to the Pop Eats stand, told Insider: “Because we stayed on Disney property, it gave us a 30-minute head start.</p>
<p>“The line was instantly massive, but once it started moving, we only waited about 45 minutes for it.”</p>
<p>Another fan, Samantha Kristiansen, told the news outlet: “It’s cute, and this is my first time going to the Festival of the Arts, so it’s a great souvenir.”</p>
<p>She waited slightly over two hours to get the cute dragon filled with rainbow popcorn.</p>
<p>A maximum of two buckets were allowed to be purchased per guest.</p>
<p>The Sun reached out to Disney for comment but did not receive an immediate response.</p>
<p>And now, the popcorn buckets are being sold for around $200 on eBay.</p>
<p>At least 50 buckets, dubbed “Disney Parks 2022 Epcot Festival Of The Arts Figment Popcorn Bucket New” on the e-commerce website, were being sold for prices ranging as low as $90.</p>
<p>Most prices were set within the $150 to $200 range.</p>

<h1> Peter Jackson’s Beatles doc brings us back to that shared place we once belonged</h1>
<div> January 16, 2022 12:38pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 12:39pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Watching Peter Jackson’s documentary “The Beatles: Get Back” streaming on Disney+ was a split experience — utterly pedestrian but transplendent and deeply moving.</p>
<a>Life magazine</a> and then their famous, head-shaking Feb. 9, 1964, “Ed Sullivan Show” 
<a>appearance</a>. OK, they were mop-headed and sang, “Yeah, yeah, yeah.” But I soon learned their true power, walking home from school with my first crush. “I have a new boyfriend,” she told me, waving a Paul McCartney 
<a>bubblegum card</a> in my face. And just like that, I was kicked to the curb. I was probably one of a million fifth-graders jilted on account of Paul, and the memory still stings two generations later.
<a>John Lennon had been shot and killed</a> by a psychotic fan outside the entrance of his apartment at the Dakota only hours after I’d walked past the building on my way home from the train. The chilling taint from that awful day has never left me.
<p>But the Beatles may have been the first act to jolt an entire generation with “Where were you?” moments, whether or not they were your cup of musical tea.</p>

<h1> Trump’s niece was ‘swindled’ by family out of full inheritance: suit</h1>

<p>President Trump and his siblings, Maryanne and Robert, “swindled” niece Mary Trump out of tens of millions of dollars in inheritance money, new court papers allege.</p>
<p>First, they “siphoned” money from the business interests that Mary inherited by transferring money to their own companies and masking them as “legitimate business transactions,” the court papers claim.</p>
<p>Second, for years they made it appear as though Mary’s interests were worth less than they actually were, in part through bogus appraisals and financial statements, the court documents allege.</p>
<p>But these three didn’t just plot against Mary, they plotted to cheat on their taxes, steal from business partners and charged their poor tenants high rents, the suit claims.</p>
<p>“My father died when I was still a teenager, and my uncles Donald and Robert and aunt Maryanne were supposed to be protecting me as my trustees and fiduciaries,” Mary said in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>“I am bringing this case to hold them accountable and to recover what is rightfully mine,” Mary’s statement continued.</p>
<p>Mary is suing for at least $500,000 in damages.</p>
<p>Robert died last month at the age of 72.</p>
<p>“The only fraud committed there was Mary Trump recording one of her relatives and she’s really discredited herself,” White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said at a Thursday briefing.</p>
<p>Maryanne could not be reached for comment. Her son did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>
<h1> Sex abuse lawsuit against Prince Andrew can go forward: judge</h1>
<div> January 12, 2022 9:47am <div> Updated <div> January 12, 2022 2:05pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The sex-abuse lawsuit filed by a longtime Jeffrey Epstein accuser against Prince Andrew can move forward to trial, a Manhattan judge ruled Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a 46-page decision, Judge Lewis Kaplan “denied in all respects” the royal’s numerous attempts to dismiss Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s suit against him.</p>
<p>The judge also dismissed the 61-year-old prince’s “meritless” suggestion that his accuser’s complaint needed to be “more definitive.”</p>
<p>“Ms. Giuffre’s complaint is neither ‘unintelligible’ nor ‘vague’ nor ‘ambiguous,'” Kaplan ruled of the detailed allegations that are “reprehensible” if true.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s ruling leaves the middle son of Queen Elizabeth II still facing trial in Manhattan federal court, scheduled for later this year.</p>
<p>One of Giuffre’s attorneys, Sigrid McCawley, hailed it as “another important step in Virginia‘s heroic and determined pursuit of justice as a survivor of sex trafficking.”</p>
