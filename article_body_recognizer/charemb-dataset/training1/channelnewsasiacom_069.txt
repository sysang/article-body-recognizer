<p>Both leaders emphasised the importance of the relationship, responsibility towards the world, and the need for open, frank discussion and good communication. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most important statement came from Biden when he reiterated the US’s longstanding “One China” policy. </p>
<p>Translated by the Chinese media, this became: “The US opposes Taiwan independence.”</p>
<p>According to the Xinhua Statement, Biden also assured Xi that “the United States does not seek to change China’s system, does not seek to strengthen alliances against China, and has no intention of conflict with China.”</p>
<p>This assurance puts to bed brewing Chinese concerns when Trump administration officials openly talked about undermining China’s political system and the CPC. </p>
<p>It also ushers in a new approach: The US is not trying to change China but wants to manage the relationship and speak up on its core values and interests.</p>
<p>It was critical that the two leaders of the most consequential nations of the 21st century met. The meeting paves the way for more working-level diplomacy to tackle some issues that have arisen between both sides but not all. </p>
<p>The larger question is how both sides will steer relations as structural and inextricable tensions between two vastly different economic systems and differing outlook on the international order remain. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Space tourism by 2024 a growing possibility in China </h1>
<div> <p>Developments this year have turbocharged the race to be the first to launch paying customers into space, says the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Lisa Wan.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lisa Wan </a> </div> </div>
<p>HONG KONG: By all indications, space will become affordable within the next 15 to 20 years.</p>
<p>Many people alive today will have a real chance of travelling to space in their lifetimes - whether a sub-orbital flight to the edge of space or lifting off to the Moon, to Mars or somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Space tourism hit an important milestone this year when Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin and SpaceX all sent their first batch of tourists to space, marking the beginning of commercialised spaceflight and the dawn of space tourism.</p>
<p>For now, space travel remains beyond most people's price range. A 90-minute suborbital trip aboard the Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo costs US$450,000. Even then, the company already has a waiting list of over 600. </p>
<p>But this fare is expected to drop by at least half in the next 10 to 15 years, just as airfares halved between 1978 and 2010 when air travel proliferated.</p>
<p>As space tourism expands and the costs continue to drop, the price of a space ticket could fall to as low as US$40,000 in the next decade, making this once-in-a-lifetime experience affordable to many more, not just the billionaires.</p>
<h2>A LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>Space tourism may seem like a luxury, a futuristic concept, a non-essential experience; but the experiences of those who made the trip tells a more nuanced story.</p>
<p>Besides enjoying the thrill of weightlessness and marvelling at the expansive vistas, every person who has gone to space has returned with a profound life-changing experience.</p>
<p>Dennis Tito, the first space tourist who went to space in 2001, called it "eight days of euphoria". Richard Branson said, "Nothing can prepare you for the view of Earth from space. The whole thing was just magical."</p>
<p>And Hayley Arceneaux, a cancer survivor and the youngest space tourist to date, said: "Seeing the planet from that distance and the landmasses without borders filled me with a new perspective into how much we are all united as Earthlings."</p>
<h2>MASSIVE MARKETS IN THE MAKING</h2>
<p>With demand expected to surge, one industry research projected that the space tourism market will balloon to US$2.547 billion by 2027, up from US$885.4 million in 2020, at a compounded annual growth rate of 16.3 per cent between 2021 to 2027.</p>
<p>North America is the leading market for space tourism, with a market share of more than 40 per cent.</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific trails closely behind, with a market share of about 30 per cent. The Chinese space tourism industry is forecast to be worth US$401 million by 2027, making it the second largest in the world.</p>
<p>In October, Blue Origin announced plans to develop a commercial space station called "Orbital Reef" to offer a "mixed use business park" for research, industrial and commercial use.</p>
<h2>CHINA IS PUSHING TOWARDS SPACE</h2>
<p>In China, where space operations are largely government-run, a commercial spinoff from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), called CAS Space, is already developing rockets for commercial satellite launches.</p>
<p>Highlighting the development of a commercial space industry as far back as 2011, the Chinese State Council pledged to "make the space industry an important part of the nation's overall development strategy".</p>
<p>The country's commercial space industry has seen the growth of at least 160 companies with businesses in satellite development, rocket technology and telecommunications.</p>
<p>This growing global competition in launching suborbital flights could boost innovation, bolster efficiencies and drive down costs further.</p>
<h2>GREATER CONSUMER INTEREST IN SPACE TRAVEL</h2>
<p>They reported a higher intention to try space travel and significantly more interest in space hotels.</p>
<p>They also seem prepared for the costs. Chinese respondents were willing to spend an average of US$1,606,310 for space travel, while American respondents were willing to spend an average of US$910,542.</p>
<p>More practically, space tourism can also open up more novel opportunities for China's economy, with Hong Kong playing a major role as a space travel hub.</p>

<h1> Commentary: China doesn't actually have a 'common prosperity' campaign </h1>
<div> <p>President Xi Jinping’s egalitarian credentials are much weaker than the West pretends. But if China’s have-nots nurture hopes for a better future, they have no one else to look to, says a law professor.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Wei Qui </a> </div> </div>
<p>VANCOUVER: After a meeting led by President Xi Jinping in August 2021, China’s Communist Party released a media summary that spoke, in part, to the idea of “common prosperity".</p>
<p>Little is new in the communiqué itself, which reiterated the message that ensuring the broad sharing of China’s wealth among the Chinese people is critical to the party’s lasting rule.</p>
<p>It acknowledged that sharing prosperity is a “long-term, difficult and complex” task and only gradual progress can be expected.</p>
<p>And it alluded to some public spending policies benefiting the poor and middle class, but merely urged sub-national governments to “experiment” with such policies while committing to no new national measures.</p>
<p>Yet “common prosperity” has grabbed news headlines in the West in recent months. Commentators claim that China is “cracking down on the rich,” “clamping down on capital” and shifting political priorities from economic growth to redistribution.</p>
<p>The business media has gone into overdrive trying to decipher what Xi’s supposed populism means for investors in Chinese stocks.</p>
<p>The spectacle of tamed tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent pledging to donate tens of billions to government “common prosperity” funds seems to offer proof of Xi’s ideological turn.</p>
<h2>TAX REVENUES REVEAL THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Yet these prognoses are belied by China’s fiscal realities. Consider the evolution of the ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product (GDP) in China.</p>
<p>This statistic is important because, to pursue redistributive policies whether poverty alleviation, creating a social safety net or supporting economic mobility — a government must raise tax revenue.</p>
<p>What is Xi Jinping’s record in tax collection?</p>
<p>China’s tax-to-GDP ratio enjoyed a sustained rise from 1996 to 2012, but has stagnated since then — precisely during the Xi Jinping era.</p>
<p>If tax revenue had continued to climb as it before 2012, China would have a lot more resources for redistribution than now. Instead, Xi’s rule has so far yielded the most sustained and largest tax cuts in China since 1994.</p>
<p>Many of these tax cuts delivered extraordinary benefits to China’s urban affluent. The 2018 amendment of the Personal Income Tax (PIT) Law, for example, dramatically raised exemptions, broadened rate brackets and introduced generous deductions.</p>
<p>The result is that many who comfortably belong to China’s top one per cent of income earners would still face a marginal tax rate of merely 10 per cent.</p>
<p>The 2018 PIT cut completely wiped out the gains in the PIT’s share of total revenue that had accrued in the previous six years.</p>
<p>Note that 2018 was after Xi entrenched his power at the 19th Party Congress and centralised much economic policy-making.</p>
<p>This means the PIT cut cannot be pinned on anybody else — the decision to slash taxes for the rich was made by the small group of political leaders led by Xi.</p>
<p>When reporting that Xi has launched a “common prosperity” campaign, the Western media sometimes refers to the possible introduction of a property tax on personal residences.</p>
<p>In reality, even this proposed measure for “taxing the rich” has benefits for the rich baked in: Property tax proposals discussed in the past decade all exempt primary residences.</p>
<p>But there is something even more interesting. China’s large PIT cut favoured the rich in 2018.</p>
<p>The Chinese government has made large corporate income tax cuts since 2019. It repeatedly cut value-added tax (VAT) rates from 2016 to 2019. And it made a big payroll tax cut in 2020.</p>
<p>Chances are, not many outside China are aware that these tax cuts even happened. How, then, do we know so much about China’s tentative property tax increase?</p>
<p>To see how odd this is, imagine Joe Biden’s proposal to raise taxes in the United States being greeted with lavish attention with scant mention that Donald Trump had significantly slashed those same taxes.</p>
<p>The explanation of this lopsided coverage is that public information about redistribution in China has come to depend on two highly unreliable sources.</p>
<p>The first is media catering to the affluent. Any possible tax increase will fuel debate. Tax cuts or policies that contribute to inequality, by contrast, aren’t as likely to be reported on.</p>
<p>After all, global financiers are enamoured with the outsized profits of Chinese tech companies; any government intervention that threatens to take away such windfalls is sensationalised to geopolitical proportions.</p>
<h2>CHINESE TECH IS LUCRATIVE</h2>
<p>Much of the media hype about “common prosperity,” therefore, is not about redistributive policy in China at all.</p>
<p>It might however reflect a search for narratives that would rationalise the Chinese government’s regulatory actions against some of its large publicly listed companies.</p>
<p>The force most responsible for lifting hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens out of poverty is probably globalisation — which also reduced global inequality but exacerbated inequities in some advanced economies.</p>
<p>Discontent arising from the “China shock” — the economic impact of rising Chinese exports on the West — has led to a political backlash in the US.</p>
<p>There is broad bipartisan agreement that China’s economic rise represents a threat to America. Lost in the heat of this sentiment, however, is the recognition that the welfare of 1.4 billion Chinese people may also hinge on China’s economic might.</p>
<p>In reality, China’s poor and middle class want the very same things as citizens in rich countries like the US and Canada: Cheaper housing and child care, more even distributions of education resources and help for the unemployed, sick and elderly.</p>
<p>Yet such Chinese desires are viewed with suspicion in the West. A public clamouring for such policies is more often portrayed as a challenge to China’s autocrats than a worthy demand for progress.</p>
<p>Xi’s egalitarian credentials are much weaker than the West pretends. But if China’s have-nots nurture hopes for a better future, they have no one else to look to.</p>

<h1> Commentary: As Singapore and Malaysia peel open borders, Johor hopes daily travel across Causeway, Second Link resumes soon </h1>
<div> <p>This is despite many workers already “giving up” returning to Singapore for work, says ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s Serina Rahman.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Serina Rahman </a> </div> </div>
<p>It has been a difficult 21 months since COVID-19 separated the two countries.</p>
<p>Malaysia and Singapore are deeply intertwined economically, historically and through extensive family ties. </p>
<p>Since Malaysia imposed a Movement Control Order (MCO) in March 2020, spouses, parents and relatives had to make stark choices. </p>
<p>Some, like 22-year-old Iman Nurhannah, dropped her business and management course at the Institute of Technical Education in Singapore to care for her grandparents living in Johor and found herself there since.</p>
<p>Others were forced to bid a final farewell to loved ones over the phone as COVID-19 struck families in the worst way. They hope to return to visit the final resting places of those lost to the pandemic once borders open.</p>
<p>The distance separating people may be short but feels excruciatingly lengthy. </p>
<p>Some 20 families kept apart only by the Johor Strait even went to the extent of hiring a yacht in October 2020 to wave to loved ones in Woodlands Park. </p>
<p>Coming during the school holidays, school-going Malaysians in Singapore can look forward to a long-awaited reunion with family. </p>
<h2>JOHOR NEEDS SINGAPORE TO REOPEN</h2>
<p>But the reality remains that the closure of Malaysia’s southern borders has had severe economic repercussions. </p>
<p>Without the usual inflow of Singapore and other visitors via the Causeway and Second Link bridges, many businesses in Johor Bahru suffered.</p>
<p>Retail lost both local and international customers, leading to popular shopping malls near the customs and immigration complex such as City Square Mall, to completely shut down for many months. </p>
<p>With inter-district and inter-state travel lifted in October, domestic tourists returned. But operators, like Desaru Coast and more in the Johor tourism industry, say Singapore remains the key target market bringing “busloads” of visitors.</p>
<h2>MAKING ENDS MEET WHILE BORDERS STAYED SHUT</h2>
<p>Many of the hundreds of thousands of workers who used to commute between Johor and Singapore have since struggled to find alternative jobs. </p>
<p>Those “lucky” enough to continue working in Singapore with accommodation provided, like bioengineer Lim Kok Leong, have struggled with separation from loved ones. He hasn’t seen his five-year-old daughter for more than a year. </p>
<p>When easing travel rules continued to seem distant, those no longer able to depend on jobs in Singapore took on any temporary work they could find in Johor.</p>
<p>Many worked as food delivery riders. Others took to selling almost anything and everything they could from car boots when the MCO allowed for pop-up shops and small businesses to open. </p>
<p>But the challenge remains that travellers can only travel out of Kuala Lumpur International Airport to head to Singapore under the VTL. </p>
<p>Many who have given up on returning to Singapore for work left Johor Bahru to return to their hometowns in other states when domestic borders opened. </p>
<p>Others were forced to do so because they could no longer meet rental and other payments they used to service on a Singapore dollar salary.</p>
<p>The VTL offers greater ease of travel and is to be welcomed when the relaxing of restrictions between Singapore and Malaysia over the past year have been a bit of a tango. </p>
<p>The Reciprocal Green Lane (RGL), suspended after infections surged, enabled business and official travellers short-term single entry and exit between the two nations for a while, but catered largely to elite travellers. </p>
<p>The Periodic Commuting Arrangement (PCA), designed specifically for companies to bring in workers into either country, was rigid. </p>
<p>Workers were required to stay in their country of employment for at least 90 days and the costs of quarantines and testing made it particularly onerous for blue-collared workers and their firms. </p>
<p>Since mid-2021, vaccination rates across Malaysia have been improving and it feels like the country is turning the corner. </p>
<p>Johor’s vaccination rate as of Nov 9 stands at 77.2 per cent fully vaccinated, higher than the national rate of 75.4 per cent, with most vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine, according to the Malaysian Ministry of Health website.</p>
<p>A record 96.8 per cent of the adult population are fully vaccinated in Johor, and teenagers are swiftly getting their jabs too. </p>
<p>The higher vaccination rates are enabling more rules to be lifted and giving Malaysians hope that the country can live normally with COVID-19.</p>
<p>The VTL between Singapore and Malaysia strengthens the light that seems to be shining at the end of this dark pandemic tunnel for those of us in Johor. </p>
<p>But it is even more heartening that both prime ministers signalled optimism that a similar VTL across the Causeway and Second Link is seeing progress – something most Johor residents and businesses are looking forward to most. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Melaka election more about Pakatan Harapan losing than Barisan Nasional winning </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Francis E Hutchinson </a> <a> Kevin Zhang </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Following unexpected tumult at the beginning of October, Melaka held its state election on Nov 20.</p>
<p>Due to the state’s demographics and income level, observers have examined the results with an eye to getting a feel for national dynamics ahead of a potential snap poll — which could be as early as July next year.</p>
<p>At first blush, the results from the election are stark, and largely favourable to Barisan Nasional (BN). From a low of 13 seats in the 28-seat state assembly in 2018, BN roared back to power with 21 seats.</p>
<p>The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) alone secured 18 seats, and its alliance partners, the Malaysian Chinese Association and Malaysian Indian Congress, secured two and one seat respectively.</p>
<p>Conversely, Pakatan Harapan’s (PH) 15 seats from the 14th general election tanked to a mere five. The Democratic Action Party (DAP) retained four out of its eight seats, many with thumping majorities, and Amanah retained a single seat.</p>
<p>Of keen embarrassment to PH’s leader, Anwar Ibrahim, the Parti Keadilan Rakyat (PKR) was wiped off the map, with all three of its seats falling to Barisan Nasional.</p>
<h2>PAKATAN HARAPAN'S LOSS</h2>
<p>However, while BN now has the numbers to dominate the assembly and even change the state’s constitution if it so desires, a closer look shows that Melaka’s voters are only marginally more supportive of BN now than they were three years ago.</p>
<p>Consequently, PH’s vote share dropped significantly from 51.1 per cent in 2018 to 35.8 per cent last weekend. The 2018 figures include Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu), which ran in six seats but withdrew from the coalition in 2020.</p>
<p>Also key was a notable decline in voter turnout, from 85 per cent in 2018 to 65.9 per cent in 2021. The stark reality is that PH’s ground game consistently lags behind BN’s, with the latter excelling at marshalling the troops to turn up and vote.</p>
<p>While BN’s victory and PH’s loss are attention-grabbing, there is another important dynamic at work.</p>
<h2>PERIKATAN NASIONAL, NEWEST COALITION A THIRD FORCE TO CONTEND WITH?</h2>
<p>In the 2021 polls, Bersatu was the only PN party to secure two seats. But the coalition collectively obtained 24.3 per cent of the votes cast.</p>
<p>This, in itself, is creditable and effectively elevates the coalition from a non-contender to a third force.</p>
<p>Looking at the performance of Bersatu —founded only in 2016 — it appears that in Melaka at least, Muhyiddin Yassin remains popular.</p>
<p>In addition, PN’s tactics of attacking BN on governance and fielding a female, Mas Ermieyati Samsudin, as candidate for Mentri Besar had some traction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in seats like Mas Ermieyati’s Tanjung Bidara, as well as Ayer Limau, Telok Mas, Pantai Kundor, Ayer Molek, Rim and Sungai Rambai, the party came in a respectable (and sometimes close) second. </p>
<p>Despite its securing no seats, PAS performed respectably in the eight constituencies it ran in. It bagged nearly 5,000 votes in Serkam, where it was pipped to the finish line by a mere 79 votes.</p>
<p>PAS also did better than expected in the relatively urbanised and ethnically-mixed seats of Kelebang and Bukit Katil.</p>
<p>When seen from this angle, then, PN clearly performed much better than expected, but less well than its leaders hoped.</p>
<p>For a coalition that has been subject to withering attacks from UMNO, PN has shown it can hold its own and contend for hearts and minds.</p>
<p>While Bersatu will live to fight another day, the issue is what PAS will do. Much of its grassroots and a substantial faction of its leaders have a marked preference for UMNO over Bersatu.</p>
<p>And, they are well aware of the meagre number of seats that PN secured. To date, PAS’ president, Hadi Awang has been resolute in partnering with Bersatu and PN, and not with UMNO and BN.</p>
<p>There are valid strategic reasons for this, not least that the Islamic party will have far more choice and freedom when it comes to seat selection if it does not team up with UMNO.</p>
<p>When it comes to campaigning and protecting fiefdoms, Bersatu is a natural coalition party for PAS. Furthermore, in the likely event that there is a three-way split between BN, PN, and PH, PN would be a more amenable partner for UMNO than PH.</p>
<p>Given the real possibility that no coalition gets an outright parliamentary majority in the next general election, the leaders of BN and PN would be more than capable of letting water flow under the bridge in order to regain power.</p>
<p>In the end, Bersatu has few options and must soldier on, with or without PAS. PAS might have the luxury of choice, but does it have the discipline to be patient?</p>

<h1> Commentary: Najib Razak is down but not out yet </h1>
<div> <p>The legal setback is but a small political obstacle. Still, it might force Najib to press for an early general election, says James Chin.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> James Chin </a> </div> </div>
<p>HOBART: The number one news item in Malaysia for the past 24 hours is the Court of Appeal’s judgement that upheld former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s guilty verdict from last year. </p>
<p>Najib later expressed disappointment at a online press conference organised by his lawyer. </p>
<h2>MOST MALAYSIANS THOUGHT NAJIB WOULD BE ACQUITTED</h2>
<p>This verdict was so highly anticipated that almost the entire country halted its activities just to watch the verdict. </p>
<p>A recent coded statement by Mahathir Mohamad that a “corrupted” ex-leader will be making a comeback had created a build-up of anticipation. </p>
<p>For weeks, rumours were circulating in Kuala Lumpur that due to Najib’s sterling performance in Melaka where Melaka Barisan Nasional (and UMNO) won by a landslide on Nov 20, there would be tremendous political pressure on the courts to acquit him. </p>
<p>The rumours gained currency when Najib’s lawyers filed papers to the Court of Appeal, attempting to introduce new evidence and trying to delay the verdict. </p>
<p>The defence had claimed that Najib should get a new trial because there is new evidence the husband of Zeti Akhtar Aziz, the former central bank governor, was a beneficiary of the 1MDB affair and this was not revealed during the SRC case. </p>
<p>Most Malaysians believed that some deal was struck to get Najib off because a string of acquittals happened in recent months. </p>
<p>In July, the Court of Appeal reversed the conviction of former UMNO Secretary-General Tengku Adnan Tengku Mansor after he was found guilty of accepting RM2 million (US$476,000) from a Chinese businessman. </p>
<p>The court accepted Adnan’s explanation that it was a donation for UMNO that somehow ended up in his personal bank account. </p>
<p>In early November, the High Court ordered the government to return designer handbags, watches and other items worth millions. They were seized in 2018 from Najib’s condo during the investigation into the 1MDB corruption scandal. </p>
<p>The courts subsequently also acceded to Najib and his wife’s request to return their passport and travel to Singapore to see the birth of their grandchild.</p>
<p>Thus, all public signals pointed to Najib getting an acquittal or at least the Court of Appeal possibly ordering a new trial.</p>
<h4> <div>Will UMNO seize this chance to redeem itself? What are the implications when the monarchy, which was never meant to be a backstop against politics crises, steps in? CNA's Heart of the Matter explores these issues:</div> </h4>
<h2>BUT COURT OF APPEAL’S VERDICT MATTERED LITTLE</h2>
<p>Contrary to public perceptions, Najib always knew he will remain a free man no matter what the Court of Appeal verdict was. There is a higher court, the Federal Court. </p>
<p>So like clockwork, Najib’s lawyer asked for and was granted a stay on the Court of Appeal’s judgement while they seek leave to appear before the Federal Court. </p>
<p>If leave is granted by the Federal Court, then the case will go up. It will take months before there is any finality to the SRC case.</p>
<p>In the meantime, legally speaking, little has changed for Najib. His legal team had already anticipated that it may go up to the Federal Court, so Najib was in no danger of going to jail immediately. </p>
<p>It was widely expected that as an ex-prime minister, he would be accorded every avenue in law to argue his case.</p>
<h2>BUT NAJIB’S STAR HAS DIMMED</h2>
<p>Yet, politically, yesterday and today could not be more different. Yesterday before the verdict, Najib’s political capital was sky high as many were expecting the Court of Appeal to grant a new trial. </p>
<p>Moreover, he had played a key role in BN winning a two-thirds majority in the recently concluded Melaka state elections. </p>
<p>The decision on Wednesday meant Najib's political star has dimmed a little. But Najib knows one undisputable fact: If he is going to stay out of jail, only political power can help him. </p>
<p>He will want to remain an MP and a leading power broker in UMNO. There has been talk he has already shown his acumen as one of the ring leaders involved in ousting Muhyiddin Yassin back in August.</p>
<p>However, there are considerable obstacles in Najib’s way. People forget this SRC trial is just one of many he faces over the 1MDB affair. His legal problems will mount with time. </p>
<p>Moreover, UMNO will have to win a massive victory at the next General Election (GE15) if Najib is to have any chance of becoming prime minister again. This is a very big “if”.</p>
<h2>WHY NAJIB MAY BE PUSHING FOR GE15</h2>
<p>A royal pardon before GE15 would allow Najib to escape these legal headaches. But that route is not available to him now as a royal pardon would not normally be exercised until all legal avenues are exhausted. </p>
<p>Moreover, with other trials still in progress, the royals will not want to risk incurring public wrath to save Najib’s political skin. The timing is just plain wrong. </p>
<p>But given the political nature of this case, it would be foolish to second-guess what can and cannot proceed. Nothing about this case is ordinary so the usual rules do not apply.</p>
<p>In summary, while Wednesday’s verdict was a massive legal setback for Najib, politically, it’s just a roadblock. He has to slow down and drive slowly around fresh obstacles. </p>
<p>But Najib is a man who spent his entire life in Malaysian politics and if anyone can manoeuvre around these legal roadblocks using the knowledge of how the system works, it's Najib.</p>

<p>JOHOR BAHRU: Like an ominously dark cloud on the horizon, the recently identified COVID-19 variant Omicron threatens to derail global plans to reopen borders and reinvigorate national economies. </p>
<p>Despite early indications the Omicron variant is “almost certainly” not more severe than the Delta strain from top US scientist Anthony Fauci, this pandemic has had too many twists-and-turns for anything to be a certainty.</p>
<p>Just as Singapore and Malaysia nudged open the gates for families and friends to be reunited after more than a year of separation, some are worried the doors will slam shut yet again. </p>
<p>Both countries have already imposed a tighter COVID-19 testing regime for Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) travellers.</p>
<p>Jubilee has given way to fresh unease. In early November, the announcement of the air VTL to Kuala Lumpur elicited cheers of joy from Malaysians working in Singapore and their families who remained across the northern border. </p>
<p>Others were hoping for a VTL by land, which would allow Malaysians with families in Johor to return without quarantine. </p>
<h2>USING THE VTL HAS BEEN CHALLENGING</h2>
<p>The land VTL pressed on in end-November to great fanfare, with over 5,000 benefitting in the first five days. Another 2,771 used the air VTL. Still, these numbers represent only a small fraction of those hoping to cross these borders.</p>
<p>Travelling via the VTL hasn’t been a bed of roses. Some found tickets to cross the border hard to come by, and once launched, seats were snapped up in minutes.</p>
<p>Fulfilling requirements to cross the border was more complicated than expected, with many struggling to deal with the uploading of vaccination certificates and contact-tracing apps. </p>
<p>Others were unsure about when, where and what types of COVID-19 tests had to be taken. </p>
<h2>COPING WITH UNCERTAINTY: THE PRICE OF TAKING VTL</h2>
<p>Even those choosing to press on with the VTL found themselves having to embrace one more factor: Uncertainty. When unforeseen costs can escalate quickly if rules change, money is a key issue.</p>
<p>The possibility of a sudden quarantine requirement when returning to Singapore weighed heavily on the minds of those with limited leave and cannot work from home.</p>
<p>The daily quotas and poor information over limited alternative flights and bus services added to the worry some might not get the chance to travel or return even if they did cross over. </p>
<p>While he was lucky enough to book a seat on the very first day of the VTL and secured last-minute leave to return, he is also mindful that additional COVID-19 testing could be required and quarantine reimposed when he leaves. </p>
<p>These are trade-offs he would bear when the alternative is losing his Singapore job. He hopes he can continue with this arrangement and is enjoying being back for now.</p>
<p>Others have been less fortunate. As tickets sold out and anxiety increased, social media posts began providing tips on how to bypass glitches in the booking systems.</p>
<h2>SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS FILL SOME GAPS</h2>
<p>Many noted that while it took a long time to get across, with a lot of waiting in between, it was not too difficult in the end. </p>
<p>While some complained about buses being relatively empty, others pointed out that only 20 people per bus were allowed to travel as part of the SOP. </p>
<p>Others posted reliable sources of information or direct links to government website pages answering frequently asked questions.</p>
<h2>MALAYSIANS WILL FIND WAYS TO RETURN IF BORDERS CLOSE</h2>
<p>Malaysians remain creative about finding alternatives in case the Singapore-Malaysia land VTL shuts. Some recommend using the air VTL to travel to Kuala Lumpur then to fly down to Johor. </p>
<p>Others point to plans to enter the country via Langkawi, where there is a travel bubble for tourists. They then hope to travel to Johor or other places after a seven-day stay on the island. </p>
<p>Malaysians who are Singaporean Permanent Residents can return to Malaysia without the VTL, including by land but this requires a seven-day quarantine, with an isolation-at-home option. </p>
<p>Kelvin Tan opted for this after being separated from his family for 13 months, choosing to bite the quarantine bullet and found it hassle-free when the requirements were clear. </p>
<p>While SOPs did change frequently, the latest information was always available and updated on the respective government websites, procedures were systematic, and staff on both sides extremely helpful, he said. </p>
<h2>WHY KEEPING BORDERS OPEN IS AN IMPERATIVE</h2>
<p>With the onset of Omicron and additional SOP requirements, some Malaysian netizens in Singapore have opted to wait or have cancelled VTL flight bookings because they were unsure about returning in time before their leave ends. </p>
<p>Stories of Malaysians working in Singapore show an increase in mental health issues that resulted from separation, loneliness, and missing home and family.</p>
<p>Families have broken down in tears upon reuniting at KLIA. The possibility that Omicron might deprive those who have not yet had a chance to return has created a sense of hopelessness for some.</p>
<p>Authorities and healthcare officials have worked tirelessly to develop and evolve robust SOPs meeting new pandemic uncertainties to ensure families can be reunited safely and as conveniently as possible. Such efforts must continue. </p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate the differences between Singapore and JB … being away from my own home and family, being thrust into a foreign culture and this way of living can be very stressful,” Mr Ong told me. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Why does Najib Razak remain so popular despite guilty 1MDB verdicts? </h1>
<div> <p>Did life in Malaysia under a Najib Razak prime ministership seem better? ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute's Serina Rahman unpacks why many Malaysians feel indebted to the controversial figure.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Serina Rahman </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: It’s been years since former prime minister Najib Razak was slapped with a swathe of corruption charges and just days since the Court of Appeal upheld his guilty verdict of seven charges in one of the 1MDB cases.</p>
<p>While the news drew a broad range of reactions, some bewailed his conviction in spite of the “overwhelming evidence” against him as set forth by lead judge Abdul Karim Abdul Jalil.</p>
<p>It seems incredulous Najib still has a devout following – what explains his popularity? </p>
<h2>GAINING SUPPORT THROUGH ‘SOLVING PROBLEMS’</h2>
<p>Many Malaysians believe his fanbase hinges on his ability to scatter reimbursement or “petrol money” in return for supporters to be present at court hearing, campaign events and rallies. </p>
<p>But there are others who willingly support him even without immediate financial compensation. </p>
<p>Political support from Malaysia’s bottom 40 per cent (B40) depends on personal engagement, interaction and proven past assistance.</p>
<p>On home ground, Najib’s electorate, who voted for him overwhelmingly in the last 14th general election (GE14), strongly believe in his ability to serve.</p>
<p>His ability to ensure Pekan’s progress endears him to the local populace, nurturing their loyalty. </p>
<h2>SELECTIVE MEMORY, LONGSTANDING LOYALTIES</h2>
<p>Najib also enjoys the goodwill from the legacy of his late father and Malaysia’s second prime minister, Abdul Razak Hussein. </p>
<p>Abdul Razak launched Malaysia’s oil palm cooperative communities (FELDA) which helped rural Malays become landowners and climb out of abject poverty.</p>
<p>The boom of the palm oil industry and the widespread conversion of arable land from rubber plantations to palm oil fields allowed an entire generation of rural Malaysians to provide for their families.</p>
<p>Today, many FELDA settlers, especially the older generation in east Johor, feel indebted to Najib when his late father’s efforts improved their lot. Malay culture beholds its people to memories of the good that others have done for them.</p>
<p>In my conversations and interviews with rural Malay communities, a common refrain I hear is to “kenang jasa” or to “remember the good services or efforts (of the past)".</p>
<h4> <div>It's in cookies, toothpaste and hand sanitiser. But it's also been blamed for deforestation. A palm oil producer talks to us on The Climate Conversations about how they’re trying to make it more sustainable:</div> </h4>
<p>This is a common belief by traditional Malay communities, but was especially fervent in Johor’s FELDA areas leading up to GE14. </p>
<p>Johor has always been UMNO’s stronghold. While there was a dip in support over GE14, rural parts of Johor remained firmly in UMNO hands. </p>
<p>The expectation is that past “generosity” should be repaid with loyalty at the ballot box, and in recent times, support outside the courts. </p>
<p>But few expected the entire Barisan Nasional (BN) government to fall. </p>
<p>This sentiment was especially directed towards the Democratic Action Party (DAP) – long vilified as the despised ethnic other and nemesis to Malay culture, faith and rights.</p>
<p>Malaysians used to having BN in power grappled with a completely new world. While the GST was removed, the PH government created a sales and services tax, and costs of living continued to rise.</p>
<p>Past collegial methods of doing business were replaced with systems said to improve transparency and remove corruption but were a shock to the people. </p>
<p>It was at this time around 2019 that Najib began to reinvent himself, even as corruption, abuse of power and tax evasion charges were filed against him. </p>
<p>Intentionally or otherwise, this became his new persona. In public engagements, his supporters and even random foreign workers in the vicinity could be heard calling out to him as Bossku. </p>
<p>From elitist prime minister, Najib was now seen as someone on the ground with the people, accessible to all, and a voice for the everyday Malaysian.</p>
<p>Past anger at his family’s brazen displays of wealth evaporated and “malu apa bossku” (what are you ashamed of my boss?) became the rallying cry of the poor.</p>
<p>The tagline became a catchy rap that spread quickly through B40 communities and even spawned T-shirts, caps and other merchandise. These were bought and worn by people of all ages as a symbol of solidarity and displeasure at the PH government.</p>
<p>The irony that Najib is now advising the UMNO grassroots not to exhibit luxury and instead work for the people, when he himself was deposed from power for those same reasons, seems to be completely overlooked by his fanbase. </p>
<h2>A PANDEMIC KNOCK-OUT PUNCH</h2>
<p>Then came COVID-19, and with it, a whole new wave of uncertainty. It brought the country to an unprecedented economic standstill and total lockdown. It fuelled a political crisis culminating in a changeover in government.</p>
<p>As movement restrictions dragged on well into 2021, nostalgia for Najib’s era of relative stability strengthened. Economic disruption hit the people hard. Incidents involving national leaders and celebrities flouting rules added salt to the wound.</p>
<p>As Najib peppers his social media pages liberally with the local chant of “malu apa bossku”, he is simply parroting public concerns in parliament on behalf of the people.</p>
<p>Some Malaysians think he understands their difficulties and will fight for their rights. Hence the calls for him to return as prime minister.</p>
<h2>CAN BOSSKU RETURN AS PM?</h2>
<p>But on paper, and by law, Najib’s return as PM is not actually possible. Anyone charged and found guilty of this many severe crimes cannot stand as a representative of the people or as a member of parliament. </p>
<p>But there is still the ongoing appeal at the Federal Court, and the never-ending stay of execution. </p>
<p>In spite of the charges against him and the fact he’s been found guilty, Najib has been walking around a free man. </p>
<p>While Najib is seen to be the invisible hand behind UMNO’s win in the recent Melaka state elections, and a vital power-broker within the party given his broad support base and deep pockets, there are factions against him.</p>
<p>Some are envious of his position and power and would like to replace him. Others are publicly outspoken against his role in the 1MDB saga.</p>
<p>UMNO party divisions and branches are now visibly mobilising in preparation for early national elections in 2022. Many analysts see this as a bid by Najib to build on the Melaka elections and regain full power. </p>
<p>It is broadly assumed that if he can be reinstated as prime minister, he can be cleared of all charges. His appeal at the Federal Court will take many months to come to a conclusion in any case. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Shocking risks and little control - the scary things about Facebook’s outage </h1>
<div> <p>We use various services each day to learn about the COVID-19 situation, to get food and more. Yet the recourse we have when Facebook goes down is incredibly limited, says Benjamin Ang.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Benjamin Ang </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Most of us in Singapore were asleep when Facebook and its other platforms went offline through the night. </p>
<p>For casual users, it was a minor inconvenience, an annoyance, or even a good time to disconnect for a social media detox if taken positively. </p>
<p>But imagine the impact had this been during daytime here.</p>
<p>Facebook shares plummeted by 5 per cent on that same day. Some US firms have reportedly estimated their sales were impacted by 30 per cent that day.</p>
<p>It was nothing short of an infrastructural collapse. In the dozens of countries where Facebook is the only de facto means to access the Internet, millions of people were suddenly cut off from communications and services.</p>
<h2>TECHNOLOGY CAN FAIL VERY FAST</h2>
<p>This is not just about Facebook, Instagram or WhatsApp but the lessons we need to learn before a bigger outage happens.</p>
<p>After all, the incident most worryingly reveals how fast even the most advanced platforms can fail, despite having thousands of engineers working to get it back up.</p>
<p>The outage was not caused by a cyberattack or a hardware failure but human error introduced during routine maintenance. </p>
<p>A coding mistake shut down the company’s connection between data centres and took down the DNS (Domain Name System) servers which direct and track traffic offline, killing network access even for frontline engineers trying to fix the problem. </p>
<p>What more then if an insider was planted, bribed or blackmailed to bring down Big Tech firms like Facebook to paralyse societies in an act of terror, ransom or mischief?</p>
<h4> <div>Listen to experts break down the changes to Whatsapp's terms and conditions and discuss the developments leading up to the point where "all hell broke loose" on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:</div> </h4>
<h2>RELIANT ON RANGE OF INTERCONNECTED TECH PLATFORMS</h2>
<p>These risks are shocking because we rarely consider how pervasive and interconnected Big Tech platforms are, and how many services we take for granted each day. The network effect such platforms offer can be a boon, but they can also be a bane.</p>
<p>If one or more stop working for a day or two, our lives would be enormously impacted.</p>
<p>We may use Facebook to log in to apps we use daily and rely on WhatsApp to communicate but it’s not just Facebook platforms.</p>
<p>Work-from-home during this pandemic has only been enabled because of access to emails on Microsoft Outlook, messages on Slack and video calls on Zoom. </p>
<p>The services we use - from food delivery, grocery deliveries, and ride-sharing apps - rely on Google Maps. Many news sites rely on Google Ads for revenue. </p>
<p>Millions also depend on big platforms for information about what is happening around them, because the platforms are their primary or only means of accessing the Internet. </p>
<p>Yet recent revelations of Facebook’s downplaying of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, the role of Instagram in worsening teen mental health and more uncovered by the Wall Street Journal last month remind us of the costs of this reliance.</p>
<p>Still, because it offers economies of scale and quick authentication, Facebook platforms including Whatsapp have also become official communication channels on COVID-19. </p>
<p>Rollouts of authenticated, “green-ticked” accounts for business and government communications have shored up trust and allowed the use of instant, verified communications better than SMSes and calls. </p>
<p>Yet what would have happened if Facebook and WhatsApp had been down when the Singapore Government needed to announce new COVID-19 measures? </p>
<h2>REGULATIONS TO PROTECT COMMUNICATION CHANNELS</h2>
<p>Cognisant of how infocommunication technology has become an essential service, countries have thus far focused on protecting such critical infrastructure. </p>
<p>Tech companies have been put on notice. They know they have a duty to protect systems, avoid passing costs to society, and manage the regulatory fallout on bottom lines.</p>
<p>The Internet is a complex mix of engineering, governance and security. There is responsibility across the corporate, national, community and even individual levels. </p>
<p>We cannot leave this to any single entity because of concentration risk; we all have a part to play. </p>
<h2>BUILDING RESILIENCE AGAINST THE NEXT OUTAGE</h2>
<p>Still, these developments won’t slow much less stop the relentless march of the digital economy. The solution must lie in building up our resilience in such a digital failure. </p>
<p>Some of us have already started doing this, downloading Telegram and Signify when Whatsapp terms and conditions changed last year and were able to switch over seamlessly.</p>
<p>Diversifying the technologies we use might seem expensive, even wasteful when we won’t use more than one main channel when they work well. </p>
<p>Yet these redundancies are essential back-up plans in emergencies for communicating, transacting, and working that tackles our singular reliance on any one channel. Who knows when the next outage will be and how long that can last?</p>
<p>We cannot rely on only one source of water, so over the years we have built our reservoirs and treatment plants. In the same way, we cannot rely on single sources of technology. And we need to start building alternatives now.</p>

<h1> Commentary: China’s long march with tech firms just got started </h1>
<div> <p>President Xi Jinping moves to “securitise” tech should be seen in the larger context of how the country leverages tech to further national goals, says NTU researchers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Stefanie Kam </a> <a> Dylan MH Loh </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: China’s clampdown on leading Chinese technology firms seems the conclusion to its decades-long soul-searching exercise on the extent to which national interests should override private gain.</p>
<p>Although a hallmark of China’s economic miracle has been Deng Xiaoping and subsequent Chinese leaders’ openness to global markets and foreign investments, that pendulum may now be swinging the other way under President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>These recent moves under Xi – the clampdown on tech firms, the rules on gaming hours and the demand for ride-hailing to provide full-time employment – have demonstrated rising techno-nationalism. </p>
<p>It’s clear China has decided market reforms should serve the Leninist one-party rule. </p>
<p>In this model, Chinese authorities are reverting to an old command economy approach to align companies and minimise risks, while also granting them a certain degree of autonomy.</p>
<h2>CHINA ALIGNS TECH FIRMS WITH NATIONAL INTERESTS</h2>
<p>For years, as China moved up its developmental model to leapfrog most modern economies with new capabilities in areas like fintech, transport and gaming, the economy flourished.</p>
<p>Homegrown firms became household names, and, in turn, evolved to global tech titans – such as Ant, Didi, ZTE, Tencent and ByteDance. Crucially, this growth supported the rise of the world’s biggest middle class.</p>
<p>The time spent also gave the Chinese political leadership space to master the art of leveraging tech to support national interests. </p>
<h2>CHINA HAS LEVERAGED TECH TO SUPPORT NATIONAL INTERESTS IN THE PAST</h2>
<p>It it little wonder therefore that Beijing should also seek to more closely align tech companies with national policy and desired norms. </p>
<p>But Chinese authorities, often taking the long view, still view big companies – many of whom are emerging as global leaders in the tech industry – at the forefront of its model of Chinese development.</p>
<h2>TECH EMPLOYED TO ACHIEVE STABILITY</h2>
<p>Chinese political elites know they need to continually produce pipelines of innovative and job-producing, world-class companies to help China sustain economic growth.</p>
<p>Xi’s focus on targeting tech firms and the rising prominence of frontier technology sits in the wider context of the country’s pursuit of modern technologies. </p>
<p>Having first access and control over new technologies also gives the Communist Party of China a leading edge over its territory and population – especially as it mobilises these resources for stability. </p>
<p>It’s Chinese AI companies such as SenseTime corporation and Hikvision that have supplied the Chinese government with the surveillance technologies used there. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it also promises “controllable anonymity”, allowing authorities to monitor capital flows and financial transactions down to the last cent.</p>
<p>While anonymised transactions are not normally accessible, Beijing can choose to access them if they suspect unlawful activities, such as money laundering or gambling.</p>
<h2>PROVING THE IDEOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY OF CHINESE GOVERNANCE MODEL?</h2>
<p>And why not, when on Jul 14, the Biden administration added Chinese companies and other entities to its economic blacklist, following allegations of their involvement in human rights abuses and high-tech surveillance in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The great power competition between the US and China is heating up and both sides know technological dominance underpin this contest. </p>
<p>This may be a clash of narratives and the battle for hearts and minds, as much as it’s a fight for material superiority. </p>
<p>For some in the US, the rise of Chinese tech fuels a form of digital authoritarianism that threatens Western liberal democratic values. </p>
<p>Chinese officials have likewise framed the development of AI as an issue of national security and degrees of freedom, a train of thought present since the first day the Great Firewall was erected. </p>
<p>A deep-seated anxiety to overcome its century of humiliation and avoid a repeat of history also underpins China’s “securitisation” of tech. </p>
<p>But China is playing offence as much as defence. It wants to prove the ideological superiority of its values which the Chinese model of governance hinges on. </p>
<p>It was proud of the global coverage of its success with deploying high-tech surveillance in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and commentary that this was a model to emulate. </p>
<p>It was lauded for controlling the spread of the pandemic with new digital tools without the deliberative democratic processes constraining Western liberal societies. </p>
<p>So there is little surprise the Chinese state has adopted a utilitarian approach to including tech into its updated Chinese developmental model – one able to rival the conventional market-driven model.</p>
<p>Whether China succeeds will depend on its “discourse power” (huayuquan) – its ability to set agendas and shape international norms. This is an area for strategic rivalry. </p>
<p>As the global economy becomes increasingly more digital, the development, usage and export of emerging technologies in cyberspace, AI and more are currently unclear and open for contestation, and first movers hold an advantage.</p>
<h2>RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD</h2>
<p>Semiconductors are now the technological arena where the battle between the US and China will play out and it remains to be seen how China will wrest back control.</p>
<p>As outlined in its national strategic policy, Made In China 2025, China plans to increase domestic semiconductor manufacturing as a share of domestic consumption to 80 per cent by 2030. </p>
<p>It also plans to reduce all external dependences, including reliance on firms such as the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. </p>
<p>With massive state support, coupled with a surfeit of talent and resources, China is already a technological powerhouse. </p>
<p>However, China’s moves to align the tech sector with national security issue could encumber foreign tech firms and make the Chinese market less attractive for global labour and capital. </p>
<p>But one thing’s clear: Beijing’s long march to mobilise the country’s technological prowess for national imperatives has only just begun. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Where are the vaccine-hesitant actually getting their ‘research’ from? </h1>
<div> <p>While similar factors and narratives influence them, there is a crucial difference between those still hesitant about getting a vaccine and those staunchly against it, say SUSS’ Omer Ali Saifudeen and Valerie Ng.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Omer Ali Saifudeen </a> <a> Valerie Ng </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The vaccine-hesitant stand at the peripheries of the anti-vaccine echo chamber.</p>
<p>Almost a year after COVID-19 vaccines made their way to Singapore, some people still have surrounding concerns over medical conditions or uncertainty about the science.</p>
<p>Singapore’s own variants of misinformation exacerbate this problem, with anti-vaccine narratives from local sources and across the globe circulating on social media and being shared by, friends, even family.</p>
<h2>WE WANT STRAIGHTFORWARD ANSWERS FROM TRUSTED PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Viral misinformation can seem convincing. It thrives on cherry-picking, leaving out valuable context and other variables that present the whole – often more complicated – picture.</p>
<p>Those believing in theories casting aspersions on COVID-19 vaccines look upon efforts to tackle dissenting medical opinions as “cover-ups” especially when discredited by mainstream experts. </p>
<p>Misinformation gains critical mass within their social networks and appears to a “tribe” of vaccine-hesitants and anti-vaxxers to be more widely accepted and “grounded in science”.</p>
<p>In extreme cases globally, the anti-vaxxer agenda blends into seething political grievances about state overreach, medical despotism and other nefarious plans.</p>
<h2>ENGAGING THE VACCINE-HESITANT ON THEIR TERMS</h2>
<p>There is a crucial difference between the vaccine-hesitant and anti-vaxxers. The vaccine-hesitant are open to reasoning, but need data to address specific concerns to be convinced vaccination makes sense in their personal circumstances.</p>
<p>The vaccine-hesitant are not fully in a misinformation bubble, but turning around the anti-vaccine narratives drawing them in is an uphill task, especially when amplified by frustrations with prolonged domestic restrictions in Singapore.</p>
<p>The vaccine-hesitant could simply be frustrated or fatigued by restrictions. They may think information about vaccine effectiveness and side-effects has been unclear and don’t want to “take risks”.</p>
<p>Or they may feel discriminated by vaccination-differentiated measures and being made to pay their own COVID-19 healthcare bills.</p>
<p>We should remember these could be our own friends and family. Ultimately, we want to protect them and avoid drastic outcomes.</p>
<p>So let’s listen and empathise without judgement, understand their frustrations and triggers, and find an opening to establish trust over safe conversations.</p>
<h2>HOW DO WE PITCH THE COUNTERARGUMENT? </h2>
<p>It’s always a delicate tango. The vaccine-hesitant too consider themselves “critical thinkers”, put a high premium on having “done their own research” and may distrust authorities or mainstream experts.</p>
<p>We must be mindful the more we contradict their worldview and research effort, the higher the risk they may dig in and see engagement efforts as “attacks” on their beliefs.</p>
<p>If they are concerned about their underlying medical conditions, advise them to seek professional advice from a family doctor more familiar with their health without admonishing them for trusting a stranger on social media.</p>
<p>The crux is to try to understand their hesitations and gently address them, one by one.</p>
<p>For example, to improve the vaccination coverage of the elderly, the government encouraged younger people to talk to their grandparents and general practitioners to reassure their patients.</p>
<p>Deliberate efforts to use social media, alternative messaging formats like videos and online influencers may more easily get a foot in the door with them.</p>
<p>It can be exhausting and demand patience to deal with those entrenched in their belief systems for so long. But persuasion requires certainty and conviction of beliefs.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has taught us many lessons, including the need for a systemic communication approach to drive difficult messages, including vaccination, climate change and mental health. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Are food delivery and ride-hailing the new sweatshops? </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Simon Schillebeeckx </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Coined by the New Yorker editor Tina Brown in 2009, the gig economy describes workers who pursue "a bunch of free-floating projects, consultancies and part-time bits and pieces while transacting in a digital marketplace".</p>
<p>For these gig workers, the freedom to work whenever they want, from wherever they want and on their subjects of choice, the rise of the gig economy has opened doors to international clients and skill development.</p>
<p>But the fate of workers on ride-hailing and delivery platforms around the world appears vastly different. Most work "full-time" and are in a subordinate relationship.</p>
<p>Platforms like Grab, Didi, Gojek, FoodPanda and Deliveroo have undoubtedly kept a close eye on recent international rulings setting a precedent regarding their workers' legal status.</p>
<p>The UK supreme court ruled unanimously in February that Uber drivers are "in a position of subordination and dependency", making them like employees, not contractors.</p>
<p>As Uber sets fares, determines the contracts and imposes penalties on drivers who cancel too many requests, the judges concluded drivers have no realistic way of improving their economic position through sheer entrepreneurial skill.</p>
<p>These characteristics go against the very idea of being a self-employed independent contractor. Yet, not much later a British Court of Appeal ruled unanimously that Deliveroo drivers were self-employed.</p>
<p>Finally, the Spanish government went a step further and told platforms in May that couriers of food delivery companies must become employees, thus taking a diametrically opposite position to the British court.</p>
<p>In the US, longstanding "ABC" employment laws stipulate that workers are full-time employees unless companies can demonstrate they are independent contractors providing a service fulfilling three criteria.</p>
<p>The service must be (a) provided free from the company's control, (b) outside the company's core business and (c) with the contractor an independent professional who provides their services to multiple companies.</p>
<p>Though US laws don't dictate how firms in other countries run their business, they provide broad benchmarks for other authorities grappling with whether platform workers are contractors.</p>
<p>If Asian governments would apply a similar ABC test, how would Asian ride-hailing and delivery platforms fare?</p>
<p>Drivers are also central to these platforms' core business activities, unless we buy the argument these gig economy companies are tech companies for which drivers and passengers are incidental.</p>
<p>If drivers want to be considered employees, incentivising them to work for one platform only would arguably be better.</p>
<p>However, this may reduce their income and lead to the paradoxical situation that platforms would encourage their drivers to work for the competition as well, just to avoid the additional costs of hiring employees rather than contractors.</p>
<p>Industry competition is becoming a bane for such gig workers. While fuelling high incentives for such workers in the past, competition is also what allows platform firms to classify such workers as "partners" or "contractors".</p>
<h2>ARE PLATFORM WORKERS THE NEW SWEATSHOP LABOURERS?</h2>
<p>The gigs ride-hailing drivers and deliverers do, are similar to piece work, which is notoriously linked to sweatshop labour in the clothing industry where labourers are paid per item and work in often inhumane conditions.</p>
<p>This is why economists argue that providing powerful financial incentives for monotonous and simple tasks is highly effective and a fair exchange.</p>
<p>While sweatshop labour in the apparel industry still exists, its prevalence is declining. Was this the consequence of regulatory enforcement and changes in policy? Not really.</p>
<h2>FUTURE OF PLATFORM GIGS IN ASIA</h2>
<p>Since 2010, the number of location-based platforms has grown 1,000 per cent, suggesting they have become an intractable part of most countries' transportation and food infrastructure now.</p>

<p>That same report also finds that worker earnings on the platforms tend to be higher than in the traditional sectors, although the workload is also close to 60 hours a week.</p>
<p>Given the amount of income these platforms generate all over Asia, banishing them would unlikely improve the quality of life of many workers.</p>
<p>Moreover, imposing tight regulations can backfire. Since the legislative change in Spain, Deliveroo is considering to leave the country, leaving its contractors in limbo.</p>
<p>Some workers say that the law evasion tactics taken by the affected platforms have had a significantly negative effect on their earnings.</p>
<p>Others have complained the new Spanish law has increased accounting, insurance, and costs around value-added such that they need work much longer to make ends meet.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how different governments and location-based platforms square this circle to decide the future of gig work in Asia, because I don't think the revolution will come from consumers this time.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Are stars aligning for Grab’s listing? What will happen the morning after? </h1>
<div> <p>The SPAC market is picking up and investors are looking for equity options. But Grab faces regulatory pressures on gig workers and intensifying competition. Fintech remains a murky sector too, say business academics from NUS and HKUST.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Hanny Kusnadi </a> <a> Sam Garg </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE/HONG KONG: In early April, Southeast Asia’s “everyday-everything” super app Grab announced its intention to go public through a merger with Altimeter Growth (AGC), a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). </p>
<p>It would be the largest SPAC merger globally and the largest equity offering in the United States by a Southeast Asian company, aimed at raising around US$4.5 billion in cash proceeds on the back of a whopping US$40 billion valuation.</p>
<p>The SPAC market was bullish then. But the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) crashed the SPAC party in late April after announcing new accounting rule changes.</p>
<p>A series of scandals further dampened investor appetite for SPACs. This shorter and less arduous road for Grab to become public, compared to traditional IPOs, was suddenly infused with uncertainty. </p>
<p>Fast forward six months. The SPAC party seems to be springing back to life as regulatory filing backlog clears up.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks, several SPAC mergers, including those of space-leasing company WeWork, self-driving vehicle company Aurora, and social networking app Nextdoor, pushed past the finishing line.</p>
<h2>THE STARS ARE ALIGNING</h2>
<p>This couldn’t come at a more opportune time for Grab. Enthusiasm for SPAC mergers is recovering at the moment, and tech stocks in particular remain hot. </p>
<p>Waiting can be costly for Grab. The SPAC financing structure is still under scrutiny, with more regulatory changes and a greater focus on transparency expected.</p>
<p>The SPAC-merger route remains Grab’s most viable option to becoming a public company in the short term. Missing this window could thwart Grab’s ambition to become public at an impressively high valuation. </p>
<h2>THE MORNING AFTER: WHAT NEXT AFTER GRAB LISTS?</h2>
<p>The current timing for the SPAC deal may be advantageous for Grab, but what can we expect the morning after a night of aligned stars?</p>
<p>Grab has not been profitable. It reported a US$2.75 billion loss for the year of 2020 and US$1.47 billion loss for the first six months of 2021. </p>
<p>Putting aside whether this valuation is a true reflection of the intrinsic value of Grab, it means Grab has to deliver stellar performance to meet the high expectations of its investors.</p>
<p>As a public company, Grab will be subjected to myriad mandatory financial regulatory disclosures. Normally, firms get a good dress rehearsal during the IPO process and some don’t list because they do not survive the scrutiny.</p>
<p>The SPAC-merger route cuts that out. After going public, Grab would be periodically subject to close scrutiny. </p>
<p>In its critical transition from a private venture into a highly valued public company, Grab must pay attention on several fronts.</p>
<h2>STRENGTHENING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS</h2>
<p>Since the CEO of Grab is expected to retain a disproportionately large total voting rights (about 66 per cent), further fortification of the board would be necessary for oversight reasons.</p>
<p>Boards are important for insight too. Grab wants to dominate the 670 million citizens of Southeast Asia. This sounds impressive.</p>
<p>It is crucial to not only bring in additional independent directors with high and suitable human and social capital, but also to correctly organise the formal board leadership structure so that these directors are effective.</p>
<p>One way is to ensure that the most qualified directors are appointed to the board chair and committee chair positions. Otherwise, director feel slighted and an overall dysfunctional climate ensues, a situation we call “board undervaluation”.</p>
<p>Our research shows that board undervaluation can be the Achilles’ heel in newly public firms.</p>
<p>Grab, and its investors, should be mindful.</p>

<h2>INNOVATING ITS SUPER APP </h2>
<p>Margins for food delivery and ride-hailing are thin, so a key element of Grab’s path to profitability banks (no pun intended) on fintech. </p>
<p>This expansion won’t come easy given few acquisition options in the region to help fuel innovation, and Southeast Asia’s heterogenous regulatory, political and economic environment.</p>
<p>The deal fallout with Gojek suggests rivalries awaits Grab in the region. Competition will intensify if Uber and Didi enter the region upon the expiry of their respective non-compete agreements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Grab’s super app strategy will have to meet stringent data privacy rules. </p>
<h2>MANAGING PLATFORM GIG WORKERS</h2>
<p>To the extent that Grab considers them dispensable – with its management attention increasingly on fintech – it may unintentionally sow seeds of discontent for other products such as financial services for the underbanked. </p>
<p>Grab’s recent initiatives, such as the GrabforGood Fund, aim to improve the quality of life for its drivers and the broader community, and the intent is generally in the right direction. </p>
<p>The success of such support programmes is necessary in keeping its key stakeholders happy and engaged. Yet, there is financial cost associated with these programmes, and imitation by competitors can reduce their effectiveness.</p>
<p>If Grab manages to fire correctly on all its cylinders, it could continue to be an investor darling. </p>
<p>But for now, as much as one adores the aligned stars coming into focus for Grab, it is still prudent to scrutinise the SPAC merger and afterlife under a healthy dose of sunlight.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Grab's Nasdaq listing is the beacon Southeast Asia has been anticipating for years </h1>
<div> <p>The superapp’s listing has larger implications for many potential unicorns looking to similarly list in New York, says investment research firm CrossASEAN founder Angus Mackinstosh.</p> </div>

<p>SINGAPORE: Grab will begin trading on Nasdaq on Thursday (Dec 2), following a merger with Altimeter Growth Corp (AGC).</p>
<p>Grab’s listing will be a key barometer and potential milestone for Southeast Asia’s digital economy.</p>
<p>At a valuation of close to US$40 billion, this will not only be the largest <a>special purpose acquisition vehicle (SPAC)</a> listing to date in the United States but also the biggest debut for a Southeast Asian company.</p>
<h2>A REPORT CARD ON PROSPECTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA</h2>
<p>Southeast Asia is ripe for the picking. Close behind Grab are many potential unicorns from the region with their own plans to list in New York.</p>
<p>Demographically, the region has a young and tech-hungry 655 million-strong population across 11 countries looking for solutions to everyday problems.</p>
<h2>FROM START-UPS TO UNICORNS AND SUPERAPPS</h2>
<p>Early start-ups in SEA were born out of existing players in other markets or founded by young local entrepreneurs coming out of foreign business schools, hungry to solve local problems at home.</p>
