<div> News Trial <a>Fraud</a></div>
<p>Closing arguments began in the fraud trial of former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes on Thursday, with federal prosecutor Jeff Schenk telling the jury that Holmes "chose fraud over business failure" while urging the jury to find her guilty.</p>
<p>"She chose to be dishonest," Schenk said near the start of his closing arguments. "This choice was not only callous; it was criminal."</p>
<p>Kevin Downey, Holmes' lawyer, said the government's case was only a partial picture of her time at the company, and said she "was building a business and not a criminal enterprise."</p>
<p>Schenk played recordings as part of his closing arguments, of Holmes speaking with a group of investors in Dec. 2013 and a reporter for Fortune magazine in May 2014.</p>
<p>"You should find her guilty, but you shouldn't find her guilty because of my words," Schenk said. "You should find her guilty because of her words."</p>
<p>Closing arguments are expected to conclude Friday when the case would be handed to the jury for deliberations to begin.</p>
<p>Schenk opened his closing argument by painting a sordid portrait of Holmes, once a Silicon Valley billionaire — on paper — now trying to avoid conviction on fraud charges that could result in a 20-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on needles to draw vials of blood from a vein, Holmes spent years promising Theranos would be able to scan for hundreds of diseases and other health problems with just a few drops of blood taken with a finger prick.</p>
<p>It was such a compelling concept that Theranos raised more than $900 million, struck partnerships with major retailers Walgreens and Safeway and turned Elizabeth Holmes into the subject of cover stories on business magazines.</p>
<p>But unknown to most people outside Theranos, the company's blood-testing technology was flawed, often producing inaccurate results that could have endangered the lives of patients who took the tests at Walgreens stores.</p>
<p>After the flaws were exposed in 2015 and 2016, Theranos eventually collapsed and the Justice Department filed a criminal case in 2018 that charged Holmes with 11 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy.</p>
<p>The prosecution focused on a series of events at Theranos that "look bad, but at the end of the day when all the evidence flows together, isn't that bad," Downey said.</p>
<a>Stanford University</a> before dropping out in 2003 to found Theranos when she was 19.
<p>Schenk urged the jury to disregard Holmes' abuse revelations as an irrelevant attempt to garner sympathy.</p>
<p>"If you return a guilty verdict, you are not saying you don't believe her abuse allegations," Schenk said.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>Jurors are set to begin their first full day of deliberations Monday after listening to three months of evidence in the trial against former Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, who faces 11 charges of fraud and conspiracy.</p>
<p>The jury consisted of eight men and four women who will deliberate over evidence that includes more than 900 exhibits and testimony from 32 witnesses, including Holmes.</p>
<p>It is up to the jurors to decide if Holmes committed fraud because of her failed technology. If she is found guilty and convicted, she could face up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Although the testimony cast Holmes as Balwani's pawn, her defense team did not mention the alleged abuse and its effects on Holmes during closing arguments.</p>
<p>That leaves the jury to decide whether the alleged partner abuse may have affected Holmes' decisions at Theranos.</p>

<h3><a>'I Teach Sex Ed to Millions on Tik Tok—People Ask About Sex Hurting, Periods and Libido'</a></h3>
<div>My platform allows me to show people that there is no shame in saying the words vagina and vulva on social media. We have commercials for erectile dysfunction so why can't we talk about vaginismus and vulvodynia?</div>
<h3><a>'I'm a Non-Binary Jewish Drag Queen. My Husband is a Rabbi'</a></h3>
<div>Our daughter, Isadora, was born in November 2020, But the notion of gender is not playing a front and center role in how we parent our daughter. I get to both mother and father, I don't think I have to make a decision about how I show up.</div>

<div>I wasn't being fed the answers when I was winning and I didn't throw the game when I lost. I was doing well, and then I lost. My buzzer was working fine, the only thing that wasn't working was my brain at full capacity!</div>
<h3><a>'People Assume I'm White. This is The Racism I See'</a></h3>
<div>My mom's side of my family is Mexican and my dad's is Jewish. I am not visibly Mexican American, a fact that has afforded me many privileges in life but also has been a source of conflicting and isolating feelings.</div>

<div>Tony's mercurial temper probably caused my hair to go a little greyer a little prematurely, but he was never, or very rarely, mercurial or tough for the sake of it. It was because he was always pushing the show and pushing us.</div>
<h3><a>Jeopardy! Champion Jonathan Fisher: There's No Way Matt Amodio Threw His Final Game</a></h3>

<h3><a>Matt Amodio: My Ultimate Goal Is To Win $1 More Than Ken Jennings</a></h3>
<div>Getting my name into the record books as having the second longest winning streak, 33 games won to date, is something to hold on to. But the nice thing about being Jeopardy! famous is that it's not quite the same as being Taylor Swift famous.</div>
<h3><a>'I'm a TikTok Beauty Influencer Who Was Born Without Limbs'</a></h3>

<h3><a>'We Turn Vans into Tiny Homes'</a></h3>
<div>Our basic tiny home van layout includes a bathroom, a fully functional kitchen, bedroom and living space. But some people like to add roof racks or hammocks, or they want mood lighting.</div>

<h3><a>'I Run a Death Cafe'</a></h3>
<div>One woman had read a news article before my first death cafe and was talking in the hair salon about how it was a morbid group getting together to do God knows what. A lot of people still think it's a morbid group.</div>

<h3><a>Amy Schneider: I'm The First Trans Jeopardy! Contestant in the Tournament of Champions</a></h3>

<h3><a>'I'm a World-Class Pianist Living With a Rare Disease'</a></h3>
<div>Continuing to play piano meant I was using my entire body, it was therapy for everything and my motor skills improved. By age 7, I had the strength to stand and hold a bowl of cereal for two seconds.</div>

<h3><a>'At 50, I Wrote a Series of Best-Selling Erotic Fiction'</a></h3>

<h3><a>'I Am a Survivor Of The Jonestown Massacre'</a></h3>
<div>The morning of November 19th, we were told that they hadn't found any children or babies. On the 20th they said they had found more people and children, but they hadn't found any babies. Then on the 21st, we were told that everybody was dead.</div>
<h3><a>'I Robbed 30 Banks in a Year'</a></h3>

<h3><a>'I'm a Mom of Two, I Just Set a Powerlifting World Record'</a></h3>
<div>By the time my marriage fell apart in 2015 and I got divorced, I was around 415lb and I knew that I wanted to change. Right now, I hover at around 280lb-290lb, but for one powerlifting competition I got down to 275lb.</div>

<h3><a>'We Make Sneakers That Turn Into Apple Trees'</a></h3>
<div>Our biggest challenge has been letting people know that the shoes won't biodegrade on their feet. For the shoes to decompose, they need a mixture of moisture and constant pressure underground, for an extended period of time.</div>
<h3><a>'I'm a 20-Year-Old Trans Woman Sharing My Journey on TV'</a></h3>

<h3><a>'I Grew Up In a Slum, I'm Now a Doctor of Neurology'</a></h3>

<h3><a>'I Created a Free Clothes Store in My School'</a></h3>
<div>So far, five or six kids have used the store each week. There are a lot of people in our area on unemployment benefits because of the pandemic, so I think the Kindness Closet has made it easier for people.</div>
<h3><a>'I Manage a Group Of Performing Cats'</a></h3>
<div>In 2004, I had trained Tuna and several other cats put together a cat band that played piano, drums and guitar. The show took on a life of its own, people turned up in droves. There are so many cat lovers out there.</div>
