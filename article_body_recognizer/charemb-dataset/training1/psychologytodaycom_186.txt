<a>more mentally flexible</a> and verbally fluent and more likely to take creative, unconventional approaches to solving problems.
<a>Extraverted</a> people were also more likely to score higher on test of verbal fluency because they tended to talk more, and be less concerned about mistakes. And people higher in the trait of
<a>conscientiousness</a> tend to perform better on
<a>memory</a> tasks because they’re generally better organized and willing to work harder.

<div> <h3> Does exercise increase intelligence? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can stimulants and supplements make you smarter? </h3> </div>
<a>Adderall</a>) deliver proven benefits for many people with ADHD. But the question of whether such
<a>stimulants could improve cognitive ability</a> is highly controversial. Recent research, however, suggests that the drugs do not deliver any cognitive enhancement—aside from an increase in
<a>confidence</a>, interest, and energy in people’s tasks. A boost in
<a>optimism</a> when tackling a difficult assignment is not the same as a boost in intelligence, but it can help deliver better results by motivating people to deploy their existing cognitive resources more vigorously.
<h2> Who’s Smarter? </h2>
<div> <h3> Are men more intelligent than women? </h3> </div>
<a>men claimed to be smarter</a> than the average person, compared to just 59 percent of women.
<div> <h3> Are psychopaths smarter than other people? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are narcissists smarter than others? </h3> </div>
<a>narcissism</a> have found that a belief in their intellectual superiority is often crucial to their
<a>identity</a>. Narcissists of the type known as grandiose are highly likely to believe they are smarter than other people; some place an especially high value on IQ testing.
<a>Vulnerable narcissists,</a> on the other hand, who tend to be more introverted, insecure, and
<a>neurotic</a>, are not as likely to believe that they are smarter than others, but they are more likely than others to find taking intelligence tests to be highly

<li>Repressed anger can lead to depression, paranoia, and passive-aggressive behavior.</li>
<li>Someone who represses anger may fear that if they directly expressed it, they would be rejected or abandoned. </li>
<li>Reclaiming the right to assertive anger can undo the damage repressed anger has caused. </li>
<p>Many people see <a>anger</a> as something bad, something they need to suppress, hide away, or quickly undo. Contrary to this common impression, however, anger is a natural emotion—neither good or bad, it just is, and it serves a function.</p>
<a>anxiety</a>, and somatisation (emotions turning into bodily pain or physical ailments).
<h3>Symptoms of Repressed Anger</h3>
<p>Here are some ways repressed anger can affect us:</p>
<p>Do you feel sad for seemingly no reason?</p>
<p>Do you often feel hopeless and empty?</p>
<p>Do you lack energy and <a>motivation</a>, even towards goals you have set?</p>
<p>Have you been experiencing an underlying current of sadness for a long period of time?</p>
<p>Psychoanalysts have long known that when anger is repressed and turned inward, it turns into depression. People who have this tendency find themselves feeling sad and down about everything when actually they are angry about something specific.</p>
<a>inner critic</a> constantly attacks them, just like their critical parents, bullies, or teachers once did.
<a>guilt</a>. Whether consciously or unconsciously, this shame and guilt pave way for depression.
<a>self-hate</a> for not being able to meet their own standards, or other people’s sloppiness or lack of
<a>ethics</a>. When they have dedicated their lives to doing the right things, and to a high standard, it is understandable that they feel resentful when others don’t but still seem to ‘get away with it.'

<p>Anger is one of the basic human emotions, as elemental as happiness, sadness, anxiety, or disgust. These emotions are tied to basic survival and were honed over the course of human history.</p>
<p>For those who struggle with chronic anger, or for those who only experience occasional outbursts, learning skills to identify and navigate this powerful emotion can lead to growth and change.</p>

<h2> The Experience of Anger </h2>
<div> <h3> What causes anger? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Which personality traits are linked to anger? </h3> </div>
<p>Research suggests that the tendency to become angry is associated with <a>high neuroticism and low agreeableness.</a> Outside of the <a>Big Five</a> personality traits, a few <a>habits and attitudes may be linked to anger.</a> These include:</p>
<p>• Entitlement (believing that one’s rights and privileges are superior to those of other people)</p>
<p>• Focusing on things out of personal control (such as a partner’s behavior) </p>
<p>• External regulation of emotions (trying to regulate emotions by controlling one’s environment)</p>
<p>• External <a>locus of control</a> (believing well-being is controlled by sources outside of oneself)</p>
<p>• Refusal to see other perspectives (viewing different perspectives as threats)</p>
<p>• Low tolerance for discomfort</p>
<p>• Low tolerance for ambiguity </p>
<p>• Hyperfocus on blame</p>
<div> <h3> Are there different types of anger? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Do men and women experience anger differently? </h3> </div>
<p>The relationship between <a>gender</a>, anger, and violence is more complex than people realize, and common beliefs—such as that men are angrier than women—are often false after a close examination of the research.</p>
<a>relationship between masculinity, anger, and aggression.</a> Studies show that masculinity is associated with anger. When men’s masculinity is threatened, they react with increased anger. Challenging men’s
<a>testosterone</a> levels yields a similar effect. And seemingly dormant masculinity often emerges when men get drunk.
<div> <h3> Why does anger sometimes feel good? </h3> </div>
<a>why outrage often feels so good.</a>
<div> <h3> Why do people have revenge fantasies? </h3> </div>
<p><a>Revenge</a> involves embitterment, the sense of having been let down or victimized, coupled with a desire to fight back. Feeling helpless to do so then <a>leads to fantasies of revenge or aggression.</a></p>
<a>self-efficacy</a>, calm feelings of frustration,
<a>humiliation</a>, and insult by settling the score between the victim’s suffering and the perpetrator’s actions, and offer a mechanism to regain power and stability.
<p>Thoughts of revenge are especially likely in individuals who have been victimized and traumatized by others. They are more likely in individuals diagnosed with <a>PTSD</a>.</p>
<div> <h3> Why do people hold grudges? </h3> </div>
<a>forgive</a> and forget” can be well-intentioned but difficult to internalize. Many people
<a>hold deep grudges,</a> even if they don’t want to. This may occur because grudges come with an
<a>identity</a>. With a grudge intact, people know they were wronged. There exists a kind of rightness and strength in this identity.
<div> <h3> What are the consequences of continual anger? </h3> </div>
<a>Excessive and uncontrollable anger can cause</a> rifts in important relationships, challenges in the workplace, and legal and financial problems. Anger can hijack the ability to think clearly, leading to poor judgment and
<a>decision-making</a>. It’s often at the root of substance use disorder,
<a>domestic violence</a>, abuse and other conditions.
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Anger, like all emotions, should be monitored with self-awareness. This can prevent it from spiraling into hostile, aggressive, or violent behavior toward others or oneself.</p>
<p>Outside of therapy, techniques from deep breathing and emotion labelling to adopting a problem-solving mindset can help people learn to navigate anger on their own.</p>
<div> <h3> How can I manage my anger? </h3> </div>
<p>If you are often carried away by anger, it can be helpful to understand the patterns that trigger you. It's possible to intervene at different points along the way to deal with anger effectively.</p>
<p>1. Sleep: Sleep deprivation makes it harder to control angry impulses, so regular, healthy sleep can prevent you from being provoked.</p>
<p>2. Consider alternative interpretations: And ask yourself what evidence you have to support your angering interpretation. Consider different perspectives.</p>
<p>3. Take deep breaths: Take long, slow, deep breaths, using the diaphragm rather than the chest.</p>
<p>4. Avoid the “catharsis myth”: Venting anger, acting with aggression, and viewing aggressive content does not tend to release anger effectively.</p>
<p>5. Know that it’s ok to get mad: If you have been wronged, treated unfairly, or provoked, you should get angry, but express it assertively instead of aggressively.</p>
<div> <h3> How can I manage anger that’s warranted? </h3> </div>
<p>In cases of warranted anger, such as a coworker who never contributes to collaborative projects, you may want to use a different set of anger management tips. In those situations:</p>
<p>1. Distance yourself from the angering situation. This will help you stop ruminating and develop a clear path forward.</p>
<p>2. Dedicate time to thinking about how to solve the root problem so it doesn’t occur again.</p>
<p>3. Express your anger assertively, with a solutions-oriented approach, rather than aggressively.</p>
<div> <h3> How can I reframe situations to stop getting mad? </h3> </div>
<p>However, considering other perspectives and regulating emotions can manage anger. Instead of assuming the worst, you could consider, “They may not have seen me, or maybe they had a bad day. It has nothing to do with me personally."</p>
<div> <h3> How can I handle angry people? </h3> </div>
<p>Different expressions of anger will elicit different responses, but a few tips can help deal with angry people who are verbally aggressive, insulting, or even threatening:</p>
<p>1. Ask yourself if the anger is justified. There may be something you can do to help resolve the situation.</p>
<p>2. Stay calm. Avoid yelling, swearing, or raising your voice, which may exacerbate the situation. Speak slowly and directly, and keep your voice calm and soft.</p>
<p>3. Avoid character assaults. The middle of an angry exchange isn’t the time to discuss larger problems.</p>
<p>4. Know when to disengage. If the possibility of a positive resolution is unlikely, you may want to end the conversation or walk away.</p>
<p>5. Stay safe. An angry person is not necessarily a violent person. Still, if you feel that you are in danger, exit the situation immediately.</p>
<div> <h3> What do people learn in anger management? </h3> </div>
<a>technique to reduce anger</a> is to render it unnecessary by enhancing self-worth by reinforcing personal values.
<div> <h3> How do therapists treat patients with severe anger problems? </h3> </div>
<p>The therapist can aim to be persistent, patient, and avoid being provoked. With enough time, the patient can become comfortable enough to share vulnerabilities that may have fueled patterns of anger and abuse.</p>
<h2> Mental Health Conditions And Anger </h2>
<p>Everyone experiences anger at some point. It becomes problematic, however, when the frequency or severity of anger interferes with relationships, work performance, legal standing, or mental health.</p>
<p>Anger doesn't require a formal diagnosis to be disruptive, or to benefit from help with its management.</p>

<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Why You Need Omega-3s </li> <li> <a> Maximizing Omega-3s In Your Diet </a> </li> </ul> </div>
<h2> Why You Need Omega-3s </h2>
<a>nervous system</a>, omega-3s foster the development of brain circuitry and the speedy processing of information. Fatty acids play an important role in stabilizing mood and staving off
<a>cognitive decline</a>. Low levels of omega-3s are linked to poor
<a>depression</a>. Here's a look at the brain benefits:
<li>Builds nerve cell membranes maintain the fluidity of nerve cell membranes</li>
<li>Allows activation of receptor systems, including the visual receptor system</li>
<li>Makes many bioactive compounds like the anti-inflammatory resolvins and other neuroprotectants</li>
<li>Supports energy metabolism</li>
<li>Modulates sodium, potassium, and calcium channels, affecting cell excitability in brain and heart</li>
<li>Modulates apoptosis, or programmed cell death</li>
<li>Provides vascular protection against stroke and <a>dementia</a>.</li>
<li>Lower blood triglyceride</li>
<li>Maintain heart function</li>
<li>Regulate blood pressure</li>
<li>Diminish back and joint pain</li>
<div> <h3> Why are omega-3s especially crucial for the brain? </h3> </div>
<a>hormones</a>, and proteins back and forth. The human brain is approximately 66 percent fat, and about 20 percent of that fat is omega-3. Cells can turn omega-3 fatty acids into
<a>powerful anti-inflammatory</a> molecules, allowing the brain to heal from
<a>trauma</a>, infection, and oxidation or metabolic damage.
<div> <h3> What are the different forms of omega-3s? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can omega-3 fatty acids help reduce anxiety? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Yes. In research on substance use, when subjects were given more than 2 grams of <a>EPA per day</a>, they showed a statistically significant reduction in <a>anxiety</a> compared with those only receiving a <a>placebo</a>. </p> </div>
<div> <h3> Can omega-3 fatty acids help improve mood? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In studies with individuals who did not suffer depression or anxiety, increased intake of EPA improved their ability to handle <a>stress</a> and generated significant improvements in mood.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Can omega-3 fatty acids help treat clinical depression? </h3> </div>

<ul><li>Flaxseed</li> <li>Chia</li> <li>Walnuts</li> <li>Cashews</li> <li>Soy foods</li> <li>Pumpkin seeds</li> <li>Canola </li> <li>Brussel sprouts</li> <li>Spinach </li> <li>Broccoli</li> <li>Basil</li> </ul>
<div> <h3> Do plants contain EPA or DHA? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are eggs a source of EPA and DHA? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>No, eggs are very <a>low in EPA and DHA</a>. Eggs that are marketed as being higher in omega-3 are actually higher in ALA. Remember that this form of omega-3 is very difficult for the human body to use.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What seafood is higher in omega-3s? </h3> </div>
<a>wild salmon</a> contains some 900 mg of EPA and over 1100 mg of DHA.
<div> <h3> Why is wild fish better than farmed fish? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Farmed and wild fish have about the same amount of omega-3s. However, farmed fish is often higher in omega-6s because of what these fish are fed, and <a>omega-6s work against omega-3s</a> in the human body.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Why must you balance omega-6s and omega-3s? </h3> </div>
<a>essential fats </a>will help keep inflammation at bay. The recommended intake of omega-3s may even be inflated because studies are conducted on people who likely consume higher levels of omega-6; the Western
<a>diet</a> is typically high in omega-6.
<div> <h3> Why is an excess of omega-6s bad for you? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Vegetable oils and nuts and seeds contain omega-6 fatty acids, unsaturated fats. While omega-6s are a good replacement for meats and dairy, a diet in excess of these fats isn’t healthy.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Do vegans and vegetarians have low levels of EPA and DHA? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In a 2005 study, <a>compared to meat-eaters</a>, vegetarians were 28 percent lower in EPA and 31 percent lower in DHA. Meanwhile, vegans were 53 percent lower in EPA and 59 percent lower in DHA compared with meat-eaters.</p> </div> </div>
