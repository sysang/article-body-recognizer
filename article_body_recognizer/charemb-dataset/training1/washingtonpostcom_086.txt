<p>This is a fun way to feed, say, a distracted band of graduate students deep in finals week. A young cook could assemble the ingredients before his or her parents came home from work. You get the picture: so easy it's almost autopilot.</p>
<p>Be sure to place this on a large burner with no hot spots, and your meal will be done on time. For extra flavor, stir in a generous spoonful of homemade or store-bought pesto.</p>

<p>The tenderloin is then returned to the pan, and the kale (or spinach or Swiss chard, if you prefer) is stirred in and simmered for the last few minutes, until the pork is just blushed in the center and the kale is tender but still verdant.</p>
<div><div><p>The result is a complete meal, all there in one skillet — protein, vegetable and sauce — stunning, delicious and just right for the season.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Ah, champagne, you may say. Could be. Champagne is the ultimate fizz, synonymous with luxury and the good life. But it doesn’t have to be champagne.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A champagne shortage is looming. Shop early to keep the sparkle in your holidays.</p></div>
<div><p>There’s also Spanish cava, made like champagne with the second fermentation in bottle, but with Spanish grapes: xarel-lo, parellada and macabeo, usually. (Chardonnay sometimes, and red grapes contribute to rosé blends.)</p></div>
<div><div><p>Italy has franciacorta and trentodoc to match champagne. But, of course, there’s also prosecco, Italy’s answer to the weekday blues, ready to turn the most mundane day into a celebration.</p></div></div>
<p>An ideal holiday season for wine lovers would include all of these sparklers. And it would stretch our comfort zone with something innovative, such as Stoumen’s Solera No. 1, or a local cuvée that includes memories of a winery visit.</p>
<div><div><p>There’s a lot to celebrate, and many sparkling wines to celebrate with. Just let the bubbles work their magic on your mood.</p></div></div>

<a>This Is Not a Film</a>.” But the impact on free expression is chilling.
<p>Although divorce is increasingly common in Iran, the subject was still a risk for Farhadi.</p>
<p>“I was lucky to get it passed,” he said of the government censors who must sign off on scripts. The process of finessing government intrusion begins with the very conception of a film.</p>
<p>“First, you have to decide if you want to show the film in Iran or not,” he said. “If so, you have to get permission to make it.”</p>
<p>“I prefer, before anyone else sees it, that Iranians see it,” Farhadi said.</p>
<p>Making films for the international audience also has its complications. </p>
