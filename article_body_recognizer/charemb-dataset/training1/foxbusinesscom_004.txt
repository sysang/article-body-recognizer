<h1>Facebook to pay $52M in content moderators settlement</h1>
<h2>Moderators diagnosed with PTSD after viewing disturbing content</h2>
<p>Facebook has agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by content moderators who worked on the <a>social media</a> platform.</p>
<a>The Verge</a> reported. The settlement will include at least $1,000 for each moderator, and workers diagnosed with PTSD or similar conditions will be eligible for more, including as much as $50,000 in damages.

<p><a>FACEBOOK EXTENDS WORK FROM HOME POLICY THROUGH END OF 2020</a></p>
<p>The moderators are tasked with reviewing and removing content that includes “millions of videos, images and livestreamed broadcasts of child sexual abuse, rape, torture, bestiality, suicide and murder,” according to their complaint.</p>

<p>Wading through all that content led to former moderator Selena Scola being diagnosed with PTSD, the complaint states. She became the lead plaintiff on the case filed in Superior Court in San Mateo County, Calif.</p>
<p>A Facebook spokesperson told FOX Business that the company is grateful for the moderators who make Facebook a safe environment for everyone.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to providing them additional support through this settlement and in the future,” the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>Under the settlement, Facebook also agreed to make changes to its moderation tools in order to reduce the impact of viewing the disturbing content, The Verge reported. Audio will be muted and videos will display in black and white.</p>
<p>Moderators who view the graphic content will also be given access to weekly sessions with a licensed mental health professional and monthly group therapy sessions, according to the report.</p>
<p>The settlement still requires final approval from a judge.</p>

<h1>Christmas 2021: Everything you need to know about shopping, shipping and shortages</h1>
<h2>Retail experts tell FOX Business what holiday shoppers can expect in 2021</h2>
<div><div><h2>Supply shortages hurting back-to-school, holiday retail: Expert </h2> <p>Strategic Resource Group managing director Burt Flickinger provides insight into the state of the American consumer and retail earnings. </p></div></div>
<p>With <a>Christmas</a> being only a short 100 days away, <a>gift shopping</a> is something that’s sure to be on many consumers’ minds.</p>
<a>coronavirus pandemic</a> will play a factor in the
<a>holiday</a> shopping season in terms of purchase trends, shipping delays and item shortages. FOX Business consulted retail experts to get their insight on what American gift-givers should expect.
<p>Here’s what they had to say.</p>
<h2>Holiday Shopping Trends</h2>
<p><a>RETAIL PRICES TO SOAR BY 2021 HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON, EXPERT SAYS</a></p>
<a>United National Consumer Suppliers</a>. "Unfortunately, this also means they are struggling to keep
<a>prices</a> down. Once the prime shopping season comes around, it will be too late for most."
<p>Rose also believes retailers will tamp down on promotions later into the holiday season in response to the current early shopping trend.</p>
<a>Jane</a>, a boutique deals website predicts holiday deals "will extend over a longer period of time" as a way to get shoppers through physical or virtual doors and drive up profitability.
<p>"Toy sales are up 40% year-over-year," Spencer said. "Mask sales have increased 300% since the end of July." </p>
<p><a>UPS AIMS TO HIRE 100K AHEAD OF 'RECORD PEAK HOLIDAY SEASON'</a></p>
<p>Retail experts expect online shopping and in-store digital experiences to see a rise in light of the COVID-19 delta variant.</p>
<p>Sherene Hilal, a senior vice president at the retail marketing technology company Bluecore, said consumers can expect more opportunities to shop from home, branded pop-up events and showcases where customers can interact with products. </p>
<p>She added, "New options like [buy online, pickup in store], extended return windows, free alterations, waived shipping fees, and online exclusives will all be more available to shoppers this season."</p>
<p>As millions of Americans prepare to get ahead of their holiday shopping, retail experts say shipping delays and supply shortages are imminent.</p>
<p><a>RETAILERS GET CREATIVE IN SUPPLY CHAIN CRUNCH AHEAD OF PEAK HOLIDAY DEMAND</a> </p>
<p>She went on, adding that retailers will likely discount items that are in stock for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s going to become a challenge "as supply shortages mount."</p>

<p>Paul Magel, the president of business applications at <a>CGS </a>(Computer Generated Solutions), said apparel and footwear sectors are positioned to have a "strong holiday season," but fulfilling demand won’t be an easy feat.</p>
<p><a><u>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</u></a></p>
<p>To try and minimize the effects of shipping delays and supply shortages, Hilal said direct-to-consumer brands might be a helpful alternative during the busy holiday season.</p>
<p>In her words, "It would be beneficial for consumers this season to explore new brands that may not be their typical go-to."</p>

<h1>West Virginia home to newest US national park</h1>
<h2>New River Gorge National Park and Preserve has hiking, rafting and more</h2>
<p>America’s newest <a>national park</a> could be just what your family needs for a socially-distanced <a>getaway</a> this year.</p>
<p>New River Gorge National Park and Preserve encompasses 70,000 acres along 53 miles of the New River from Bluestone Dam to Hawk’s Nest Lake in <a>West Virginia,</a> according to the National Park Service. It is the 63rd U.S. national park.</p>
<a>Appalachian Mountains.</a> The park offers a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities like hiking trails, whitewater rafting, rock climbing cliffs, cycling paths and hunting preserve land.

<p>The preserve, which permits hunting, accounts for about 90% of the park’s land. Officials noted that hunting is "a traditional use of the area."</p>
<p>"We feel fortunate to play a role in preserving for future generations some of the most significant natural and cultural resources in our country," park Superintendent Lizzie Watts said in a press release.</p>
<p>Even with the COVID-19 pandemic and the winter weather, some of the park’s campgrounds, hiking trails and one visitor center are currently open. Visitors are advised to follow CDC coronavirus guidelines and avoid crowded areas.</p>

<p>During non-pandemic times, the park also offers guided activities like BASE jumping, rappelling, rafting and walking tours.</p>
<p>This stretch of the New River was established as a national river in 1978, so the infrastructure for outdoor fun is not new. What is new is its status as a national park, which was enabled by the coronavirus relief bill Congress passed in December.</p>

<p>The new designation recognizes the park’s "spectacular features" and allows for possible expansion through the future purchase of 3,700 acres.</p>
<p>The upgrade to park and preserve status was a bi-partisan effort led by West Virginia lawmakers Sen. Jo Manchin (D), Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R) and Rep. Carol Miller (R).</p>

<h1>Zillow quits home-flipping business, cites inability to forecast prices</h1>
<h2>Termination of ‘iBuying’ comes after company said it was halting new home purchases for rest of 2021</h2>

<p>Real-estate firm <a>Zillow Group Inc.</a> is exiting from the home-flipping business, saying Tuesday that its algorithmic+ model to buy and sell homes rapidly doesn’t work as planned.</p>

<p>ZILLOW STOCK DROPS AS COMPANY PUTS HOMEBUYING ON HOLD</p>
<p>"We’ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated and continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility," Barton said.</p>
<div> <div><p>Real-estate firm Zillow Group Inc. is exiting from the home-flipping business, saying Tuesday that its algorithmic+ model to buy and sell homes rapidly doesn’t work as planned. (Zillow) (Zillow)</p></div></div>
<p>Ultralow mortgage-interest rates and a need for more space to work from home have driven robust home-buying demand in the past year and a half. Prices have climbed sharply in almost every corner of the U.S.</p>
<p>Even this gradual tapering in price growth flummoxed Zillow’s algorithm, leading the company to pull the plug on the venture.</p>
<p>ZILLOW RIDES BOOMING REAL ESTATE MARKET TO 70% REVENUE GROWTH</p>
<p>Zillow’s class C share price was down 10% on Tuesday, falling before the company announced after the market closed that it would end home flipping. Shares continued to slide in after-hours trading.</p>
<p>The move represents a big hit to Zillow’s top line. Home-flipping was the company’s largest source of revenue, but it has never turned a profit.</p>

<p>Starting in the summer, competitors such as OpenDoor and Offerpad began to pull back from home purchases in one of the biggest home-flipping markets, Phoenix, as the red-hot pandemic market began to cool.</p>
<p>By October, the company had listed 250 Phoenix homes at a median-price discount of 6.2% below what it had paid for them. DelPrete called Zillow’s price blunder a catastrophic failure.</p>
<p><a><u>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</u></a></p>
<p>A wider look at Zillow’s national performance by analysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets found it had listed 66% of homes at prices below what it had paid for them, with an average discount of 4.5%.</p>
<p>"The fact that Zillow can’t make it work shouldn’t be the final death knell for iBuying," DelPrete said. "The other companies are making improvements, and Zillow’s not. They’re still losing lots of money."</p>
<p>Zillow said it expects that the wind-down of its home-flipping outfit will take several quarters.</p>

<h1>Real estate market will continue to move in 'fast direction' amid pent-up demand: Century 21 CEO</h1>
<h2>Existing-home sales rose 0.8% in October from September: NAR</h2>
<h2>Real estate market is not 'ready to taper right now': Century 21 CEO</h2>
<p>Century 21 President and CEO Michael Miedler argues the real estate market is still hot right now likely because 'a lot of buyers are trying to rush in and beat any more increases in the mortgage rate.' </p>
<p><a>Century 21 President and CEO Michael Miedler</a> argued on Monday that the <a>real estate</a> market is not "ready to taper right now" and will continue to move in a "fast direction" amid pent-up demand. </p>
<p>Miedler told "<a>Mornings with Maria</a>" that the market is still currently hot because "a lot of buyers are trying to rush in and beat any more increases in the mortgage rate."</p>
<a>National Association of realtors.</a>
<p>NAR’s chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a <a>news release</a> that Monday’s data proves that "home sales remain resilient, despite low inventory and increasing affordability challenges." </p>
<p>Miedler agreed with that sentiment on Monday telling host <a>Maria Bartiromo</a> that he continues "to see the market moving in a very kind of fast direction as folks have a lot of pent-up demand in trying to buy homes here in this country." </p>
<h2><a>Real estate investment firm founder on rise in existing-home sales </a></h2>
<p>Macro Trends Advisors founding partner Mitch Roschelle says he expected existing home sales would 'slow down' amid 'uneasiness in the market,' however 'the fact that interest rates could be going up is getting people to race to the goal line.' </p>
<p>Lawrence also noted in Monday’s news release that "inflationary pressures, such as fast-rising rents and increasing consumer prices, may have some prospective buyers seeking the protection of a fixed, consistent mortgage payment."</p>
<p>Earlier this month it was revealed, U.S. consumer prices <a>accelerated at the fastest annual pace</a> in more than 30 years as supply chain bottlenecks and materials shortages persisted. </p>
<p>The consumer price index climbed 6.2% year over year in October, the Labor Department said. The increase marked the largest annual gain since November 1990. Prices rose 0.9% month over month. </p>
<p>The cost of shelter ticked up 0.5% last month and was 3.5% above year-ago levels. </p>
<p>Miedler also pointed out on Monday that "on the building front, we are way behind." </p>
<p><a><u>LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS REAL ESTATE: WHAT YOU CAN GET FOR $1.2 MILLION</u></a></p>
<p>"From the downturn that happened in 2008 to where we are at now, we are at historic lows on where folks are building," he told Bartiromo.</p>
<a>noted</a> that those bottlenecks are creating

<div><h2><a>NAHB CEO warns of never before seen 'unusual circumstances' for new homes</a></h2> <p>National Association of Home Builders CEO Jerry Howard describes how supply chain issues are affecting consumers who are building new homes. </p></div>
<p>Howard acknowledged that the issues are not impacting sentiment, but did stress that the "supply chain is still a headwind." </p>
<p>He also told host <a>Stuart Varney</a> that "demand is so strong and the supply is so low" for new homes and argued if the supply chain can get "fixed" some "real good years" for the market are ahead.</p>
<p>Howard offered insight into the industry on the same day it was revealed <a>homebuilder confidence rose in November</a> as low inventories and strong buyer demand helped boost confidence despite the ongoing supply chain disruptions. </p>

<p>The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index this month <a>rose three points to 83</a>. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv were expecting homebuilder sentiment to hold at 80. </p>
<p>The index can range between 0 and 100 with any print over 50 indicating positive sentiment. Any reading above 80 signals strong demand.</p>
