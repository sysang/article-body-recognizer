<p>Rather than continuing in “a perpetual state of emergency,” he and the others argue, the United States must shift to a strategy of seeking to live with the virus by suppressing its peaks, rather than attempting to eliminate it.</p>

<div><div><p>The Biden administration also has been widely criticized for failing to move faster to acquire and distribute hundreds of millions of rapid coronavirus tests, <a>passing on opportunities</a> last year to do so.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The number of Americans hospitalized with covid-19 reached more than 126,000 this week — the highest level in a year. But this wave of the pandemic looks different from what came before, with dueling variants on the move.</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Los Angeles, where the fast-spreading omicron variant reigns, roughly two-thirds of covid patients in the county’s public hospitals were initially admitted for other causes, officials said Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at CoxHealth in Springfield, Mo., where officials say the older delta variant remains a ferocious threat, the <a>coronavirus</a> remains the immediate cause for 81 percent of covid hospitalizations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are planning on a pretty scary scenario: volumes increasing and being short-staffed,” said Steve Edwards, the hospital’s CEO, warning that omicron could soon arrive and sicken his workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most hospitalized patients are adults, the number of pediatric covid inpatients has doubled since Christmas to a seven-day average of 3,800 children.</p></div></div>
<a>Minnesota</a> and Wisconsin begging residents to get vaccinated, wear masks and take other precautions to avoid contracting covid.
<div><div><p>“We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before. And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated,” <a>read</a> one ad sponsored by Cleveland-area health systems last month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were coping with our delta surge, and omicron spread like wildfire,” said Keith Armitage, an infectious-disease doctor at University Hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Armitage said there were 486 covid patients in his hospital Wednesday, which he said represented “three buckets” of roughly equal size.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“First … patients admitted primarily due to an illness, covid-19,” Armitage said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that patients are showing up at hospitals with other ailments and injuries only to test positive later for covid is another indicator that omicron causes less serious illness, especially in people who are vaccinated, experts say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Given “how crowded the ER is, and how full the hospital beds are … the short-term concern on the health-care system is highly justified,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A changing picture</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Am I worried about those? Not really,” she said. “It does make me wonder how many incidental cases we had of delta, and I don’t think we were really focused on that back then.”</p></div></div>
<p>As evidence has mounted that many people infected with omicron were initially hospitalized for other reasons, critics have argued that health-care leaders and federal officials have obfuscated why hospitalization numbers have risen in recent weeks.</p>
<div><div><p>More than a dozen hospital leaders who spoke to The Post said much of the scrutiny over why covid patients are being hospitalized is misplaced.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>John Rimmer, CarePoint’s chief medical officer and emergency department director, adding that the virus may have worsened a preexisting medical condition such as asthma or diabetes, leading to patients’ hospitalization.
<div><div><h3><div>‘Finite resources’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The surging number of cases has collided with a separate trend: a worsening hospital <a>staffing crunch</a> that is exhausting workers, fueling rising staff turnover and leading to delays in care.</p></div></div>
<a>permanent workplace safety standards</a> to protect health workers from covid, saying that some staff members have quit because they feel at risk.
<div><div><p>In Vermont, where 52 percent of hospitals reported a critical staffing shortage, the problem stemmed from a “crisis of rural health equity” that predated covid, one researcher said.</p></div></div>
<a>Anne N. Sosin</a>, a health policy researcher at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
<div><div><p>Sosin said Vermont’s hospitals had persistently struggled to recruit specialists and other staff, and she was concerned that workers who quit during the pandemic could not be easily replaced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When we lose health-care workers from our rural region, it’s not clear that we’ll be able to fill those positions again,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But in Rhode Island — which reported the nation’s worst staffing shortage — health workers characterized the shortfalls as unprecedented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never seen this before, in the five years I’ve worked here,” said Brooke Huminski, a clinical social worker at Butler Hospital in Providence, R.I.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s created a problem — now the doctors need to pick up more of the work, which is interfering with patient flow … and of course, raising my own stress levels a bit,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a weird time to be worrying about him and also trying to function,” Huminski said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Allyson Chiu</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>At-home covid tests and omicron: What you need to know</p></div>
<b> </b>to add a throat swab has been gaining attention on social media recently, at the same time that concerns have been rising about the efficacy of at-home tests. The FDA
<a>announced in late December</a> that while rapid antigen tests do detect the omicron variant, some “may have reduced sensitivity,” citing an early finding from
<a>ongoing performance evaluations</a>. A
<a>anecdotal stories</a> of having coronavirus symptoms and testing negative when using a rapid test kit as instructed (only swabbing their noses). But when they swabbed their throats as well as their noses, they said, the
<div><div><p>Some prominent experts have also started recommending the additional throat swab.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>symptoms appear to be starting earlier in people infected with omicron, “there is a chance the virus isn’t yet growing in the nose when you first test,”
<a>tweeted</a> epidemiologist and testing expert
<a>Michael Mina</a>, a vocal advocate of rapid testing who recently left his academic and research positions at Harvard and is now chief science officer for the biotech software company eMed.
<div><div><p>“Virus may start further down,” Mina continued. “Throat swab + nasal may improve chances a swab picks up virus.”</p></div></div>
<a>Eric Feigl-Ding</a>, an epidemiologist and senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, agreed. “#Omicron is very different from all other variants,” he
<a>tweeted</a>. “We need to adapt to changing testing strategies.”
<div><div><p>Those research papers were released as preprint articles, meaning formal peer review of the work has not been completed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Feigl-Ding also said other countries, such as <a>Canada</a> and the <a>United Kingdom</a>, have authorized testing options that use throat swabs along with nasal swabs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the FDA, which issues emergency use authorizations for coronavirus tests, has strongly discouraged deviating from the specific instructions that accompany test kits.</p></div></div>
<p>“The FDA advises that COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized, including following their instructions for use regarding obtaining the sample for testing,” the federal agency said in an emailed statement to The Post on Wednesday.</p>
<a>recommends</a> that throat swabs should be collected by a trained health-care provider.)
<div><div><p>Other epidemiologists and testing experts echoed the FDA’s warning and said testing guidance should not change until there is more data.</p></div></div>
<p>“There’s a lot of work under the hood that has to be done for these companies to pivot to a new sampling method,” said <a>Albert Ko</a>, an infectious-disease physician and epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health.</p>
<a> Yuka Manabe</a>, who runs the Center for Innovative Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University, emphasized that it is “not the way the tests were designed to be used.”
<div><div><p>At this point in the pandemic, Manabe’s recommendation for testing is simple: “You should use at-home tests as the instructions for use tell you to use them,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is an interesting topic, but requires careful investigation and any test differing from manufacturer claims need to be rigorously validated before implementation,” LeBlanc said.</p></div></div>
<a>Matthew J. Binnicker</a>, the director of clinical virology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. “I don’t know what that false positive rate becomes with a throat swab included in the mix,” he said.
<a>noted</a> that while the strategy does “likely improve sensitivity,” it “may potentially cause a slightly greater number of false positives.” He recommended not eating or drinking 30 minutes before swabbing.

<div><div><p>“It’s good, but I think they need to physically see them take the test,” Robinson said Thursday morning. “I’m just hoping people are honest.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trivoria Ballard, 33, walked with her children to Tubman Elementary. She had taken her six children to their doctor’s office so they could get PCR tests, but those results take longer and her four Tubman kids needed a rapid test.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I just feel like it’s too much,” Ballard said. “Why go through all of this to get the kids tested to see who’s positive or who’s negative? Why not have them just be virtual?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was awesome,” Willis said. “She was tested and in the classroom within 15 minutes.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For example, with my youngest, her teacher makes her put her mask on while she’s chewing her food,” he said. “Which is absurd!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If anything,” McGilly said, “you get more attention when there’s fewer kids around.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I expect that there were probably a hundred different ways to get kids in the building, and I’m looking forward to figuring out what worked,” Bowser said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In response, the school system <a>announced</a> in October it would spend $22 million to equip each campus with a full-time substitute teacher and a coronavirus response coordinator.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The next challenge for the district is likely to come next week when more students are expected to show up for classes, said Richard Jackson, head of the Council of School Officers, a union for mid-level school leadership.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The lower attendance numbers reported by some school leaders Thursday, he said, made it easier to test students who showed up at schools without proof of a negative test.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Monday will be the real day where they’ll see if their systems really work,” Jackson said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Omicron and children: Pediatric hospitals in parts of U.S. filling fast</h1></div>
<h2>About 800 kids have been admitted nearly every day this week, with those in Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania and New York hit particularly hard by the juggernaut variant.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ariana Eunjung Cha</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Jacqueline Dupree</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 24, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>

<b> </b>most children had been sheltered from the coronavirus. Today, nearly every bed is taken.
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are in a difficult situation,” said Hoyen, at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies Children’s Hospital. “With omicron, we are now having this new surge on top of what was left over from delta.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Add to that the normal cases of the flu, broken bones, scheduled treatments for children with cancer and other conditions, she said, and the hospital is “in a crisis.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>in the last week alone, according to
<a>the American Academy of Pediatrics</a>.
<div><p>What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</p></div>
<div><div><p>U.S. doctors interviewed this week said that while they are seeing record positive results from children’s coronavirus tests, the vast majority of cases so far have been mild and look a lot like the <a>common cold</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>South Africa reported big jumps in hospital admissions </a>for that age group. The accuracy and significance of the South African data is unclear, but on Thursday, the United Kingdom released
<a>data</a> showing a bump in admissions for that age group, too. Hospital admissions ending Dec. 19 were at 3.64 per 100,000 for children ages 0 to 4 — three times the rate for those ages 5 to 14.
<b> </b>unvaccinated adolescents with underlying health conditions, as has been the case for most of the pandemic, although on any given day, a wide range of ages may be represented.
<div><div><p>Even with less severe disease projected overall as a result of omicron, pediatric specialists said they fear more children may be admitted to hospitals in coming weeks given <a>the sheer number likely to be infected</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Everybody is getting prepared for the worst at the moment,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Children 5 and older now have a coronavirus vaccine. But many parents of younger kids are still anxiously waiting.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Cold-like symptoms</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>In March 2020, when the first wave of the coronavirus hit the United States, the initial presentation of covid in children tended to be somewhat distinct — with many reporting a headache, stomach pain, or loss of smell or taste.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Parents have to recognize that yes, there is cold and flu and RSV,” Milstone said. “But right now the dominant cause of symptoms that look like cold is probably covid.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>It’s not just about immature immune systems, she said, but also about how the children cough, and manage secretions and body temperature less efficiently than adults, making them more likely to be felled by colds and the flu.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Most of the U.S. medical centers contacted this week said they are experiencing record volume and positivity rates among children at both their hospitals and outpatient clinics.</p></div></div>
<a>a full-page newspaper ad </a>emblazoned with the word “Help,” and the governor deployed nearly 1,200 National Guard members to set up testing sites and help medical personnel, pediatric cases are surging.
<div><div><p>“There is a sense that kids progress quicker” to severe illness, he said.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Hospitalizations of children are double what they were at the previous peak last winter and the highest of the pandemic, but they still represent a small fraction of all those infected, he said.
<div><div><p>“The good news is the probability of having serious illness goes down when you are vaccinated across all ages,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added that while a large number of children up to age 5 are testing positive, so far “they do not appear to be getting severe illness, or<b> </b>need any interventions or treatment.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Houston, hospitalizations among children with covid have doubled in the past week and over 20 percent of children at outpatient clinics are testing positive for the virus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spinner said infections are occurring in both vaccinated and unvaccinated children — with most of those who’ve gotten the shots having “much less significant symptoms.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I look at the South African data,” he said, “and I say a lot of prayers.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>MIS-C mystery</div></h3></div></div>
<a>patients suffering from lingering symptoms </a>after mild delta infections — anticipate more children in the coming months.
<a>the rare post-viral multi-inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C</a>, associated with covid that appears in some children four to six weeks after an infection. As of Nov. 30, the
<div><div><p>However, Hoyen, the pediatric infectious-disease specialist, cautioned that MIS-C has not disappeared: “We had two admissions just this week.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s too soon, she said, to know about omicron.</p></div></div>

<div><h3>Cases in the U.S. are flat</h3><p> currently has a similar seven-day average case rate to the U.S. overall.</p></div>

<p>The count of known new cases is the closest thing we have to a real-time gauge of the coronavirus’s reach.</p>
<p>It also can serve as a warning: If cases suddenly rise, hospitalizations and deaths almost certainly will follow. However, areas with little testing probably will appear to have fewer cases regardless of how rampant the virus may be.</p>
<p>The seven-day rolling average is the best way to view trends in new cases, because more than half of states don’t report new data every day. That is why certain days of the week show up as consistently higher or lower than others.</p>
<div><h3>Covid-related deaths in the U.S. are flat</h3><p> currently has a similar seven-day average death rate to the U.S. overall.</p></div>
<div><h4>New deaths reported per day </h4><p>At least have been reported since Feb. 29, 2020.</p><p>7-day average deaths</p><div>Loading data...</div><div><label>Show full anomaly values</label></div><p>Data as of ET.</p></div>
<p>Health officials believe the virus has killed more people than state totals indicate, especially early in the pandemic before testing and effective treatments were widely available.</p>
<p>A rise in deaths usually follows a rise in new cases by about a month. For example, after the delta variant caused a surge of new cases beginning in July 2021, the death toll began to climb in August.</p>
<p>As with the new cases chart, occasional single-day anomalies reflect one-time adjustments by states. They are noted but not included in the seven-day averages.</p>
<div><h3>Hospitalizations</h3></div>
<div><h4>Reported covid-19 hospitalizations per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Currently hospitalized</div><div> Filled ICU beds</div></div></div>
<p>A rise in hospitalizations tends to follow a rise in new cases by a couple of weeks.</p>
<div><h3>Vaccinations</h3></div>
<div><h4>Doses of covid-19 vaccines administered per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Reported doses administered per day</div></div><div>See more detailed vaccination statistics for each state in the Vaccine Tracker.</div></div>
<p>The vaccine rollout beginning in December 2020 was limited and chaotic, but free vaccines are now widely available and recommended for everyone age 5 and older. The CDC also recommends booster shots for many people.</p>
<p>Note: Fully vaccinated shows people who have completed vaccination, either through both doses of a two-dose vaccine, or a single dose of a one-dose vaccine.</p>
<div><h3>Tests reported</h3></div>
<div><h4>Tests reported per 100,000 residents</h4><div><div> Positive tests</div><div> Negative tests</div></div><p>Note: Data is preliminary. The most recent days are frequently revised upward.</p></div>
<p>Testing was slow to ramp up in 2020, but it has become more robust, so the rate of positive tests is another clue to the concentration of the coronavirus in an area.</p>

<p>February 19 Marked anomalous days on the daily count chart, and reformatted the chart note to better track data anomalies.</p>
<p>February 12 Updated vaccination charts to reflect reported doses administered per day.</p>
<p>February 2 For five states with limited state hospitalization reports (WV, NV, ND, MS, and WY), data now comes from the Department of Health and Human Services, instead of state reports.</p>
<p>January 8, 2021 Added a data table and charts for vaccinations, and changed the vaccination metrics to display the most reliable data available.</p>
<p>December 23 Added vaccination data to state summaries where available.</p>
<p>December 15 Removed anomalous data from the rolling averages (such as backlogged cases or deaths reported in bulk on a single day), and other data improvements.</p>
<p>December 1 Updated the presentation of hospitalization and testing data, and added aggregate U.S. data for those indicators.</p>
<p>October 30 Added several notes clarifying which days states are expected to report data.</p>
<p>October 28 Switched to reported case counts from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment which only provides data updates on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This has also resulted in a one-day spike of reported cases on Oct. 28.</p>
<p>August 24 Replaced the modeled trend with a more standard 7-day rolling average of new daily cases and deaths.</p>
<p>August 20 Added a module to show the aggregate statistics in the U.S. and each state/territory over the past week.</p>
<p>July 29 Added hospitalization data and other page improvements.</p>

<div><p>Novak Djokovic thought he’d aced Australian immigration. It now looks like a fault.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Park Hotel is most associated with immigrants seeking visas to remain in Australia, some of whom have stayed in the building for years. About 50 refugees are being held now, according to <a>Australia’s 9 News</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Nadal says Djokovic knew the risks in Australia: ‘If you are vaccinated, you can play’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Asylum seekers there have reported being served <a>maggot-infested food</a>. A fire broke out <a>last month</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The hotel where Djokovic has been sent is also holding asylum seekers who’ve been detained for more than 8 years by Australia,” <a>wrote</a> Sophie McNeill, Australia researcher for Human Rights Watch.</p></div></div>
<a>“mistreatment” of and “harassment”</a> toward Djokovic and said the “whole of Serbia” is standing behind him. Prime Minister Ana Brnabic
<a>told Sky News</a> on Thursday that Djokovic should be allowed to move to a house that his team rented in Melbourne, one that is equipped with a tennis court.
<div><div><p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison denied that Djokovic has been targeted and said he “won’t be treated any different to anyone else.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>I finally made it home to Australia. Thousands of others remain blocked by pandemic travel rules.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic,” he said <a>Wednesday at a news conference in Canberra</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australia has implemented one of the world’s strictest policies to contain the coronavirus, imposing border closures that have left many Australian nationals stranded abroad.</p></div></div>
<p>Tennis star <a>Novak Djokovic is facing deportation</a> after his travel visa for Australia was canceled.</p>
<p>Djokovic, whose vaccination status is unknown, arrived in Melbourne with a medical exemption to the <a>mandatory coronavirus vaccination</a> to compete in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>News of Djokovic’s vaccine exemption was <a>met with skepticism and pushback</a> from other quarters in the sport.</p>
<p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier that Djokovic would be “on the next plane home” if the tennis star could not prove why he needed an <a>exemption from getting vaccinated</a>.</p>
<p>The world No. 1 men’s tennis star is now <a>reportedly being held at a hotel</a> used to house asylum seekers as his lawyers lodge an appeal.</p>
<p><b>John Feinstein:</b> Novak Djokovic is desperate to be taken seriously. <a>Now he’s becoming a punchline</a>.</p>

<div><h1>With covid surging, many college students are confined in isolation and quarantine</h1></div>
<h2>With a highly transmissible new variant, college officials are scrambling to separate infected or exposed students from others</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Susan Svrluga</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 6:49 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Oscar Lloyd was eating with some friends in a lounge at his college dorm when he got the email: He had tested positive for the coronavirus, and he had two hours to pack and move into isolation housing for 10 days.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>and many colleges announced they would
<div><div><p>“ ‘I don’t know how we can handle these numbers,’ ” Taylor said. “This is the sentiment I’m hearing.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>UCLA, Yale, Duke among colleges planning to start January with remote instruction as omicron surges</p></div>
<div><div><p>At George Washington University143 residential students were in isolation at its peak in December. Seventy-five of them stayed on campus and the others left to isolate at home during the break.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>School officials are working to expand the amount of quarantine and isolation housing they have available for the spring semester, Goldman said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>For some international students during the pandemic spike, travel home is "almost impossible."</p></div>
<div><div><p>For those students confined to dorm rooms rather than traveling and celebrating the break with family and friends, the abrupt change in the pandemic could not have felt more stark.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The room had yellow walls, a single window, a bed, a set of drawers, and an empty wardrobe without any hangers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It reminded him of a prison cell, and of the Charlotte Perkins Gilman story, “The Yellow Wallpaper,” in which the narrator, confined to a single room, unravels.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s home,” he added lightly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unlike his dorm room, with an open window onto the busy street, fraternity row and all the usual bustle and cacophony of college and New York City life, this was unnaturally quiet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Every night, for hours, there was a soft cooing noise he couldn’t quite place; owls, maybe?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sometimes, through the walls, he could hear other people coughing and hacking. He himself felt perfectly healthy, making it seem all the more discordant, as though he were trapped in a plague house.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s suddenly gone from doing everything all at once to doing absolutely nothing,” he said. “It’s a sharp shift.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Next up: Soren Kierkegaard’s “Fear and Trembling.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At his home in Alexandria, his brothers FaceTimed him so he could watch them put up their Christmas tree. The family played a virtual trivia game with him. His parents sent him a mini-tree, with batteries to light it up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They were surprised by his positive test because the school had been so careful, his mother, Helen Lloyd, said. She was glad he had been responsible and been tested, and was helping tokeep others safe.</p></div></div>
