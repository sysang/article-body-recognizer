<p>Where does the conviction that "I can do this if I try" come from?</p>
<p>In 1977, the psychologist Albert Bandura asserted that the most important determinant of self-efficacy is what he calls mastery experiences. After a lifetime of study, he didn't change his mind. </p>
<p>The main idea is simple: If you attempt hard things, again and again, and eventually succeed, you come to believe in your capabilities. In contrast, if you fail repeatedly, you come to believe that you can’t succeed, even if you try. </p>
<p>The logic of mastery leading to <a>confidence</a> is undeniable. But it’s easy to forget.</p>

<h1> The "Why" of Education </h1>
<h2> Examining our expectations around sending children to school. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Education Is Important </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Martin Luther King, Jr. identified "the goal of true education" to be "intelligence plus character."</li>
<li>Schools that do well in terms of test scores don’t always excel at developing character in their students.</li>
<li>It's important to not simplify education and to get young people's perspective on what they think its purpose is.</li>

<p>What do we hope for when we send children to school? </p>
<p>King’s answer: “<a>Intelligence</a> plus character—that is the goal of true education.”</p>
<p>But what, then, is character?</p>
<p>This is the question child psychologist Diana Baumrind addressed, toward the end of an illustrious <a>career</a>, in an <a>essay</a> entitled “Reflections on Character and Competence.” </p>
<p>Character, Baumrind writes, “provides the structure of internal law that governs inner thoughts and volitions subject to the agent’s control under the jurisdiction of <a>conscience</a>.” </p>
<p>Jackson also found that the schools that do a wonderful job on the test-score front don’t always excel at developing aspects of character—and vice versa. But many schools do both. </p>
<p>Don’t oversimplify education. A great classroom is one in which young people thrive in every sense of the word. Schools play an essential role in helping young people develop socially, emotionally, physically, and academically.</p>

<h1> Student Well-Being Matters </h1>
<h2> How the Student Thriving Index measures how young people are feeling. </h2>
<li>The pandemic has added to the concern for adults and children alike</li>
<li>The Student Thriving Index is a self-report questionnaire that separately indexes social, emotional, and academic dimensions of well-being. </li>
<li>Use the Student Thriving Index as a conversation starter with young people.</li>
<p>According to Google Ngram, which tracks the popularity of words and phrases in books, well-being is having a moment.</p>
<p>But the moment, I think, will last the millennia. Because concern for well-being is not a fad—it’s a permanent transformation.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Google Ngram Viewer</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Around the globe, policymakers are prioritizing well-being. Why? Because our lived experience as human beings matters as much as the bales of cotton, kilowatts of energy, and gigabytes of information that we, as a society, produce each year. </p>
<p>And the pandemic has only added to the concern for adults and children alike. How are the young people in your life feeling right now? Are they thriving, languishing, or somewhere in between? Do you know?</p>
<p>Here are some of the questions:</p>
<li>In your school, do you feel like you fit in?</li>
<li>How happy have you been feeling these days?</li>
<li>Do you feel like you can succeed in your classes if you tried? In your school, is there an adult you can turn to for support or advice? </li>
<p>While keeping individual student responses confidential, we aggregate responses at the school level to create dynamic dashboards for the educators in our network. At a glance, schools can see how the young people in their community are feeling. </p>
<p>Researchers use the same anonymized data to answer urgent questions such as the effect of remote schooling on adolescent well-being? (Answer: <a>not good</a>).</p>

<h1> Suffering Setbacks During the Pandemic Doesn't Mean a Child Is Broken </h1>
<h2> Start this school year by supporting, motivating and encouraging kids. </h2>
<li>A study in over 100,000 schools showed that acceleration, rather than remediation, helped students make more progress post-pandemic.</li>
<li>Acceleration helps motivation more than remediation because it assumes the child is still capable.</li>

<p>“I’m really worried about you. You’ve fallen behind. You’re nowhere close to where you need to be at this point.”</p>
<p>How would you feel if, on the first day of school, you were on the receiving end of this assessment?</p>
<p>You might respond to such discouraging news by doubling your motivation to succeed. I’ll show you, you say under your breath. I have what it takes.</p>
<p>But much more common, I think, is the opposite reaction: I’m never going to catch up. I hate school.</p>
<p>This is why many educators and psychologists advocate an “asset-based” approach to teaching and <a>parenting</a>.</p>
<p>But, truth be told, I didn’t fully grasp the problem with remediating weaknesses.</p>
<p>But I’m beginning to see the light.</p>

<h1> How to Help Teens Cut Back on Social Media </h1>
<li>Harnessing a teenager’s need for independence can be an effective tool for getting teens to cut back on social media use.</li>
<li>Don’t lecture teens about the consequences of too much social media use. They likely already know, and it doesn’t change their behavior.</li>
<li>Instead, help kids understand how social media platforms hook you. Show them how changing their social media behavior is an act of autonomy.</li>
<p>Today, I’ve asked Brian Galla to share his tip of the week.</p>
<p>How do you convince a teenager to kick their Instagram habit?</p>
<p>You might point out that cutting back on social media may help them sleep. Or that what they post in private might become public later.</p>
<p>But as a rule, <a>teenagers</a> don’t enjoy adults telling them what to do or think—so this approach can <a>backfire</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s an idea that new <a>research</a> shows can be effective: harnessing a teenager’s need for independence.</p>

<h2> Young people need scaffolding to grow stronger. </h2>
<ul> <li>All young people need personal agency in order to fulfill their dreams and their potential.</li> <li> Agency is the conviction that you shape your own future.</li> <li>Young people need both challenge and support to develop confidence.</li> </ul>
<p>This is the first in a three-part series on the legacy of Albert Bandura.</p>
<p>When Al Bandura died in July, he was 95 years old and among the <a>most eminent psychologists</a> in history.</p>
<p>In the year before his death, Al and I began a lively correspondence — by phone calls, email, and once via U.S. mail.</p>
<p>So much of what Al spent his <a>career</a> studying — and his own life exemplifying — is what all young people need in order to fulfill their <a>dreams</a> and their potential: personal agency.</p>
<p>What is agency? The conviction that you shape your own future.</p>
<p>What is the opposite of agency? Believing that you’re <a>helpless</a> to make your dreams come true. Seeing yourself in life’s passenger seat, likely on a trajectory you don’t like and didn’t choose.</p>
<a>fear</a> is self-perpetuating. A patient who was afraid of heights, for example, would take pains to avoid skyscrapers, airplanes, or even stairwells — and, thus, never learn to overcome their fear.
<p>“And it’s not so much the fear and the rumination that are the problem,” Al told me. “It’s believing you’re helpless to change your emotions and thoughts. That’s the real problem.”</p>
<p>“And do you know why I knew this was really important?” Al asked me.</p>
<a>resilience</a> and efficacy in other areas of their lives as well. They had a sense of agency they’d never known before.”
<a>confidence</a>. We can neither solve all their problems for them nor expect them to grow without scaffolding.
<p>Don’t tell anyone they have complete control of their destiny. That’s not true. And yet each of us, no matter our circumstances, has some control, particularly over our own thoughts and actions.</p>

<h1> The Power of Collective Efficacy </h1>
<h2> The lesson of Swimmy. </h2>
<li>Self-efficacy emboldens the individual to chase their dreams.</li>
<li>Collective efficacy, on the other hand, motivates a group to coordinate their actions.</li>
<li>Solving problems doesn't depend on just the individual, or collective action—the biggest challenges require both.</li>

<p>This is the second in a three-part series on the legacy of Albert Bandura. Read the first one here. </p>
<p>Do you know the story of Swimmy?</p>
<p>Perhaps, like me, you read the 1963 book by Leo Lionni over and over again as a young child. Or, like me, you read it night after night to your own children.</p>
<p>Here’s how it goes.</p>
<p>Swimmy is a little fish who lives happily in the ocean with his many brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>One day, a much larger fish comes darting through the waves and, in one gulp, swallows every fish in the school except Swimmy himself.</p>
<p>Swimmy escapes to wander the seas and, though at first scared and <a>lonely</a>, eventually comes upon another school of fish just like his own family.</p>
<p>“Let’s go and swim and play and SEE things!” Swimmy says happily.</p>
<p>But the fish are hiding in the dark shade of rocks and weeds. If they come out, they explain, a big fish will eat them all.</p>
<p>Swimmy thinks for a long time.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he says, “We are going to swim all together like the biggest fish in the sea!”</p>
<p>And he shows them how, if they swim close together, just so, they will look like one giant fish.</p>
<p>Swimmy and the triumph of these little fish leaped to mind when I read <a>one of the articles</a> Stanford psychologist Al Bandura selected, among the hundreds he’d written, to mail to me months before he died.</p>
<a>goals</a>. The choice was also timely because, as he pointed out in what would be our last phone conversation, a single person alone can’t solve challenges like
<a>climate change</a>, social inequality, or the pandemic.
<p>Just as <a>self-efficacy</a> emboldens the individual to chase their <a>dreams</a>, collective efficacy motivates the group to set shared goals, coordinate their actions, and overcome obstacles.</p>
<p>Don’t think that solving problems depends on either the individual or social structures. “Personal agency and social structure,” Bandura wrote, “operate interdependently.” It’s not either/or, it’s both/and.</p>
<p>Do share the story of Swimmy with a young person in your life. And remember the legacy of Al Bandura when you read the very last line: And so they swam in the cool morning water and in the midday sun and chased the big fish away.</p>

<p>“Angela, do you think the United States will elect a female president in your lifetime?”</p>
<p>Years ago, this was the last question of the last interview for a scholarship that, alas, I didn’t win. Reflexively, I frowned and shook my head no.</p>
<p>Where does the audacity to set ambitious goals and strive for them come from?</p>

<li>Students from historically marginalized groups often hold limiting beliefs about themselves that they've learned from society.</li>
<li>In noting what they've gained from their unique background and identity, they see how life experiences can be an asset, not a liability.</li>
<li>Forging a positive link between identity and education can increase a sense of self-worth and lead to greater motivation.</li>
<p>This week, I’ve asked Ivan A. Hernandez to share his tip of the week.</p>
<blockquote> <p>I’m not smart enough… I don’t have the experiences they’re looking for… I’m not qualified.</p> </blockquote>
<p>That’s what I told my mentor when he encouraged me to apply for psychology Ph.D. programs. I was a Latinx first-generation college student from a working-class immigrant family. I thought there was absolutely no way I could get in.</p>
<p>Troubled that I held these beliefs, my mentor explained that it was precisely because of my diverse identity and lived experiences that I would benefit the scientific community.</p>

<p>This week, I’ve asked Louis Tay to share his tip of the week.</p>
<p>All parents yearn for their children to succeed in life. Mine were no exception. </p>
<p>When my mother was pregnant with me, she and my father were having a meal out at a Singapore hawker center when a French lady at a nearby table called out her son’s name—Louis. </p>
<a>research</a>, with over 1.7 million people around the globe, I find that life satisfaction increases with earnings only up to a point.
<p>In North America and Western Europe, for example, people are happier when they earn more, but not after they reach an annual income of $95,000. At that point, life satisfaction starts to plateau.</p>
<a>self-worth</a>—and assume that more is always better. If you’re not fulfilled, you might think you would be if you just earned more. But higher pay often comes with greater burdens and
<a>stress</a>. Once you make enough to put food on the table, a roof over your head, and money in the bank for your children’s
<a>education</a>, the extra money may not compensate for higher demands and heavier workloads.
<p>What does influence life satisfaction? <a>Having a higher purpose</a> beyond money—finding deep interest and meaning in your work—is a vital component.</p>
<a>career</a>—doctor, lawyer, entrepreneur, and the like—you hope it will lead to both. And it might. The danger lies in basing the decision solely on income potential.
<p>Don’t push your children toward skills or careers just because they pay well. Financial success is only one dimension of a fulfilling life. </p>
<p>With purpose and <a>gratitude</a>,</p>

<h1> Roots and Shoots: Feeding Curiosity </h1>
<h2> A story from Jane Goodall illustrates the joy of curiosity and discovery. </h2>
<li>At the root of all learning is curiosity—questions you want to know the answer to for no other immediate reason than you’re dying to know.</li>
<li>Don’t scold children for asking questions out of turn or for breaking a few rules in search of answers. </li>
<li>Encourage curiosity at any age.</li>
<p>It all began with an egg.</p>
<p>When Jane Goodall was just 4 years old, she went to visit her grandmother at the family farm. One of her chores was to collect the hens’ eggs.</p>
<p>“As the days passed, I became more and more puzzled,” she recalls. “Where on a chicken was there an opening big enough for an egg to come out?”</p>
<p>Without the Internet to consult for an answer, young Jane decided to find out for herself. One afternoon, she crawled into an empty henhouse and, for hours and hours, hid in some straw, quiet as a dormouse, waiting. </p>
<p>More than seven decades later, Jane remembers what happened next as if it were yesterday:</p>
<p>As excited as she’d ever been, on a birthday or Christmas, she ran home to share the news. </p>
<p>All little girls and boys are born wanting to learn. At the root of all learning is <a>curiosity</a>—questions you want to know the answer to, for no other immediate reason than you’re dying to know.</p>
<a>research</a> shows that it is not only curious questions, but also interesting answers, that further enhance learning and
<a>memory</a>, particularly as children grow into adolescents. In other words,
<a>teenagers</a> are smarter when they’re tackling topics whose questions and answers fill them with wonder.
<p>Don’t scold children for asking questions out of turn, for hiding in henhouses, for breaking a few rules in the pursuit of an answer they urgently need to discover for themselves. </p>
