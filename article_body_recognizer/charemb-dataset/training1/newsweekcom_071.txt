<h3>Why are These Platforms Helpful?</h3>
<h3>Identify Your Target Audience</h3>
<p>• Online searches regarding a product.</p>
<p>Identifying your audience might take you some time. Doing research and conducting surveys can help gather necessary information before you go all out. The more target clients you get, the more profitable your business will be.</p>
<h3>Building Your Digital Advertisement</h3>
<p>Digital advertising is typically included in every business's marketing strategy. There should be details on how the ad will connect with clients, not only via the promotion proper but also via email, blogs, social campaigns and search engines.</p>
<h3>Steps Involved in Digital Advertising</h3>
<p>Once you're aware of what digital advertising is, you are ready to start the process:</p>
<p>People nowadays are quick to rely on the internet. Many easily trust what they see on social media. But there are still pros and cons to this approach, and it's important to deploy your critical thinking skills.</p>
<p>Your business won't be successful if you don't have adequate funding. After creating your strategy, allocating your budget comes next. This depends on what your goals are and your target market. Make sure to focus on:</p>
<p>• The people: If you decide to make a TV commercial, maybe your client is the general public. You'll need to be ready to pay the price.</p>
<p>• The timeline: You must have a clear and concrete timeline of activities that will be involved in executing your business.</p>
<p>• The platform: Whether your chosen platform is social media, website or email, it will come at a cost. You will likely be choosing among paid searches or advertising channels.</p>
<p>Good production can lead to good business. It involves a creative strategy and teamwork — don't try to go it alone. Make sure every aspect of the production emphasizes your business's objectives.</p>
<h3>4. Focus on Distribution</h3>
<p>Lastly, the distribution process: This is where you want to promote your products and services through various platforms. It includes all those social media platforms, websites and even radio or television. The broader the scope, the better.</p>
<h3>Importance of Digital Marketing in the Digital Age</h3>
<p>All successful businesses must have a strong digital marketing strategy to bring in more clients and more revenue. Thanks to the rise of modern-day technology, you can easily reach people with just one click.</p>
<p>Here are some of the benefits to keep in mind:</p>
<p>Unlike the typical ways of delivering information to clients, you can quickly promote your products and services to target clients with digital marketing. You can keep them updated on the latest news via social media and email.</p>
<h3>Easy Monitoring of Prices and Feedback</h3>
<p>Conducting surveys through advertising might be time-consuming and expensive, but you can quickly check the number of clients, purchases and feedback with built-in analytical tools.</p>
<h3>Many Affordable Tools to Choose From</h3>
<p>Besides <a>Facebook</a>, <a>Google</a> Ads and YouTube, there are a lot of options for marketing your products online. You might want to consider affiliate marketing, which can help you reach a vast number of people.</p>

<h1>What Every Realtor Needs to Know</h1>
<h2>Repetition and analyzing mistakes and wins will help you succeed.</h2>
<div> Chris D. Bentley , <a>Award Winning Dallas Real Estate Broker and Owner of Bentley Fine Properties</a> <time> On 12/15/21 at 11:08 AM EST </time></div>
<div> Experts <a>Real estate</a></div>
<p>I have been selling real estate for more than 18 years in multiple states. Here's what I've learned.</p>
<h3>The Power of Specialization</h3>
<p>Naturally, there are things some team members are not going to be good at. Heck, there's a ton of things that I'm not good at, but it's still important to know how they work in case a situation arises that requires me to act.</p>
<p>Many real estate entrepreneurs don't understand the responsibilities that come with being a broker. If something goes wrong with a client, it's your job to make them happy. You also have other agents looking up to you to make sure deals go right.</p>
<p>Peaking in real estate requires strong will, mindset and determination. You can't be afraid of failure. You have to be willing to take a lot of risks to see if the outcome is what you expected.</p>
<p>You're going to fail; you're going to blow sales. You're going to have to develop a tough skin about it to avoid quitting. Repetition and analyzing mistakes and wins will help you succeed.</p>

<p>The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act bans imports from Xinjiang unless businesses prove the items they are sending were not produced with forced labor.</p>
<p>Government agencies will also be required to elevate their systems for monitoring the use of forced labor in China, and the bill establishes a presumption that products created in Xinjiang are produced using forced labor.</p>
<p>The House and <a>Senate</a> each passed the bill with significant bipartisan support before it was sent to Biden.</p>
<p>In its denials, China says it has taken steps it believes are necessary to combat terrorist threats and a separatist movement in the region.</p>
<p>The China measure had to overcome some initial hesitation from the White House, as well as corporate opposition, to win final passage last week in the Senate, following earlier House passage.</p>
<p>Businesses will have to prove that forced labor, including by workers transferred from Xinjiang, was not used in manufacturing products before they will be allowed into the U.S.</p>
<p>Detainees also are moved outside Xinjiang and put to work in factories, including in the apparel and textiles, electronics, solar energy and automotive sectors, the U.S. says.</p>
<p>Some big corporations lobbied against the measure. <a>Apple</a>, like Nike and other companies with production done in China, said it had found no sign of forced labor from Xinjiang in its manufacturing or supply chain.</p>
<p>Uyghur rights advocates and others had also feared private opposition from within the Biden administration as the U.S. sought cooperation from the Chinese on climate change and other issues.</p>
<p>In a statement last week, White House press secretary <a>Jen Psaki</a> noted export controls and import restrictions, sanctions, diplomatic initiatives and other measures the administration had already taken targeting forced labor in Xinjiang.</p>
<p>The ALS Act will also create grant programs and provide early access to promising treatments for patients who aren't accepted into clinical trials.</p>

<p>A reported deal between Saudi Arabia and China to help the former develop its ballistic missile arsenal could spark a new arms race in the region, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) has warned.</p>
<p>CNN reported on Thursday that U.S. intelligence officials believe Riyadh—thanks to help from Beijing—is working to produce its own ballistic missiles, where in the past it had only been importing them from foreign buyers.</p>
<p>Several officials at multiple agencies, including the White House's National Security Council, have reportedly been briefed on the significant transfer of ballistic missile technology from China to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Markey—a member of the <a>Senate</a> Committee on Foreign Relations, and its subcommittee dealing with the Middle East—responded, making clear his concern.</p>
<p>"Reports that China is aiding Saudi Arabia's ballistic missile program are deeply alarming, but not surprising," Markey wrote on on <a>Twitter</a>, urging his colleagues to act.</p>
<p>"<a>Congress</a> must pass my Saudi WMD Act to prevent an illicit Saudi weapons program which could spark an arms race in that region."</p>
<p>The lawmaker was referring to the Stopping Activities Underpinning Development in Weapons of Mass Destruction Act that Markey reintroduced in April along with Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Rep. <a>Joaquin Castro</a> (D-TX) and <a>Ted Lieu</a> (D-CA).</p>
<p>The legislation "aims to restore oversight and take steps to impede access to sensitive technologies that could pave the way to Saudi Arabia acquiring a nuclear weapon."</p>
<p>The tense geopolitical situation in the Middle East—much of it now split into two blocs led by <a>Iran on one side</a>, and the U.S.-Saudi-Israeli partnership on the other—is driving a <a>new arms race</a>.</p>
<p>Iran's proxy forces in Iraq, Yemen, Syria, and Lebanon are armed and funded by Tehran, which is also pressing ahead with its own ballistic missile development despite international protests.</p>
<p>Iran has been expanding its nuclear program since former U.S. President <a>Donald Trump</a> withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action deal in 2018—with the backing of Israel and <a>Saudi Arabia</a>.</p>
<p>With <a>JCPOA revival talks</a> at an impasse, it is unclear whether the international community will be able to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons; or at least reaching a point where it can do so within a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>China on Sunday recorded its highest number of daily COVID cases in 21 months due largely to an outbreak in the northwestern city of Xi'an.</p>
<p>The new cases in Xi'an, home to about 13 million, pushed the national daily COVID count to 158, Reuters reported on Sunday, citing official data.</p>
<p>Infections rose to 155 from 75 in one day after cases with confirmed symptoms were identified on Saturday. The city reported 485 COVID cases between December 9 and 25 after it launched three rounds of mass testing.</p>
<p>No details were revealed about the reasons behind the surge, but city officials said that the new Omicron variant was not detected among the new infections.</p>
<p>Residents are currently on their fourth day of lockdown as heavy COVID-related measures were reinforced in compliance with Beijing's policy to control local outbreaks.</p>
<p>Xi'an city official He Wenquan said on Sunday that the surge in cases could continue in the upcoming days.</p>
<p>"In order to quickly screen out the infected groups of people, after an analysis by experts, we will step up control measures in key areas, especially places with greater risk level," Wenquan said, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>The city will also launch a large disinfection campaign as part of its efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, residents are not allowed to leave their homes without getting approval from local authorities and employers.</p>
<p>China has confirmed some Omicron infections among international travelers and in southern China, according to Reuters. Chinese authorities haven't reported new COVID deaths, leaving the total death toll at 4,636.</p>
<p>Mainland China reported 206 new COVID cases on December 25, an increase from 140 a day prior.</p>
<a>WHO</a>. In response, many countries worldwide imposed temporary
<a> travel </a>restrictions and brought back strict COVID-related measures to slow the spread, while
<a>health experts recommended</a> improving face coverings and getting booster shots.
<p>Omicron has been spreading across the U.S. and has become the leading strain in the country, accounting for 73 percent of COVID infections last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a>CDC</a>) <a>said on Monday</a>.</p>
<a>have predicted</a> the "milder Omicron surge" would peak in the U.S. on January 18, but only if Omicron is far less "immune-evasive" than the Delta variant, adding that the severity and transmissibility of the new variant was still "uncertain."
<header><div> <a>Opinion</a></div><h1>Is McKinsey China's Weapon Against America? | Opinion</h1><div> Gordon G. Chang , Author, commentator <time> On 12/27/21 at 6:30 AM EST </time></div> </header>
<div> Opinion <a>China</a> Marco Rubio <a>Xi jinping</a></div>
<p>A spat between McKinsey Company, the world's largest consulting firm, and Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican, highlights a critical American national security vulnerability to China.</p>
<p>The consultancy has been caught covering up its work for the "Chinese government." McKinsey denies deception, but the episode suggests it knows its dual representation of the American and Chinese governments does not serve U.S. interests.</p>
<a>wrote in a December 16 letter</a> to Bob Sternfels, McKinsey's global management partner, in San Francisco.
<a>says its disclosure in the Valaris case</a> "reflects an accurate description of client service that includes local and provincial government, and is entirely consistent with the type of work we communicated openly about with the senator's office."
<a>Xi Jinping</a>, now in power, the Party has blurred the line again. The distinction is not as distinct as it once was.
<p>In any event, the precise characterization of McKinsey's clients is of no relevance for the critical issue at hand: Does the firm's work for both Chinese and American clients pose a risk for U.S. national security?</p>
<p>The Florida senator is correct on the nature and extent of the risk. China is now in a position to use lucrative consulting arrangements with McKinsey to obtain information about American businesses and the U.S. intelligence community.</p>
<p>The consultancy has worked for the <a>CIA</a>, <a>FBI</a>, <a>NSA</a> and DOD. At the same time, the firm represents, or has represented, 22 of the 100 largest Chinese state-owned enterprises and nine of the top 20 Belt Road Initiative contractors.</p>
<p>That revenue stream obviously gives Beijing influence over McKinsey.</p>
<a>told the Daily Caller</a> last year. "Such services—and the state-controlled enterprises that do their bidding—live to access forensic assessments of the internal operations of key American companies, and even government agencies."
<p>As Robinson pointed out, "After a big dinner with wine, someone from the Chinese side will say, 'We know you can't say much, but could you give us some insights?'"</p>
<p>Yes, America needs tougher laws. In the meantime, President Biden can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to force McKinsey to make a choice.</p>
<p>The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.</p>
<p>An MSNBC news producer has been mocked online after he published a tweet last Sunday that used the word "alleged" when referring to China's human rights abuses against Uyghur Muslims.</p>
<p>"Japan has decided not to send senior officials to the Beijing <a>Olympics</a> in February — a move that will align it with the U.S. diplomatic boycott over China's alleged human rights abuses," MSNBC producer Kyle Griffin wrote in his tweet.</p>
<p>Griffin is a senior producer of The Last Word with Lawrence O'Donnell, one of the network's primetime news discussion programs. His tweet referred to Japan's decision to join the U.S. in a diplomatic boycott of China over the Uyghurs' mistreatment.</p>
<a>Twitter</a> users accused Griffin of being a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Others suggested that he said "alleged" because
<a>NBC</a> will be broadcasting the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.
<p>Newsweek contacted MSNBC for comment.</p>
<a>confidential Chinese government documents</a> showed evidence of Chinese President
<a>Xi Jinping</a>'s personal role in orchestrating oppression of the Uyghurs in China's Xinjiang region, according to German researcher Adrian Zenz.
<p>The documents showed evidence that China deliberately forced Uyghurs to undergo sterilization in a bid to control the Muslim population. China also subjected other Uyghurs to rape and torture in detention centers and forced labor camps, Zenz said.</p>
<p>The governments of the United States, Canada, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands have all called China's actions against the Uyghurs "genocide" and "crimes against humanity."</p>
<a>Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act</a>. The bill bans imports from the Xinjiang region unless businesses prove the items weren't created by forced labor. The bill passed with enormous bipartisan support.
<p>In response, the Chinese government <a>accused the U.S. of "smearing" China</a> with falsehoods about the Uyghurs. Beijing described the reports of Uyghur abuses as the "<a>lie of the century</a>."</p>
<a>had decided "beyond doubt"</a> that China committed genocide and crimes against humanity through its mistreatment of Uygurs.
<p>The tribunal saw the aforementioned leaked documents and heard from multiple witnesses, including Uyghurs who provided firsthand testimony of the abuse they suffered.</p>
<div> World China <a>United States</a></div>
<p>Chinese state media appeared to troll the United States on Monday, publishing dual articles referencing the reported low rates of COVID-19 in China versus rampaging cases of the Omicron variant seen in the U.S.</p>
<p>The articles were published by Xinhua News Agency, China's official state-run press outlet. Often accused of being a channel of disinformation for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the agency has been criticized for publishing reported false facts.</p>
<p>The article on Chinese cases also stated that "no new suspected cases and new deaths from COVID-19 were reported on the day."</p>
<p>"The new Omicron variant has driven a winter surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths across the United States," the story began.</p>
<p>It also pointed to the 176,000 new daily cases being reported by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>The article also appeared to take aim at the efforts of the Biden administration's attempt to slow the spread of Omicron, saying that "people across the nation seeking COVID-19 tests are facing long lines and empty shelves."</p>
<p>However, Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, told Newsweek that the dual articles were not an attempt to troll the United States.</p>
<p>"The relevant data comes from open resources and is credible. Saying 'Chinese media troll the US with these dual articles' is an over-interpretation," Pengyu said.</p>

<div> World Japan <a>China</a> <a>Taiwan</a></div>
<a>China</a> held their first high-level dialogue of the year on Monday, in which both sides clashed over disputed islands in the
<a>East China Sea</a> but also agreed to establish a hotline in order to avoid physical conflict.
<p>Tokyo and Beijing have overlapping claims to the Senkaku Islands, an uninhabited island chain that has been administered by Japan for several decades. China calls the island group Diaoyu and says it has a <a>historical claim</a> to them.</p>
<a>escalated further</a> after Beijing passed a controversial coast guard law this past February, permitting its armed "white hull" vessels to fire upon foreign ships.
<a>Yoshihide Suga</a> and now incumbent PM Fumio Kishida, Kishi is part of a ruling party faction that is decidedly pro-
<a>linking</a> of Taiwan's safety to Japan's own security has been something of a theme in 2021, ever since Suga
<a>White House</a> in April. The internationalization of the decades-long cross-strait impasse has been touted by some Japanese commentators as Suga's greatest foreign policy achievement during his short time in office.
<a>increasingly guarded</a> toward Beijing, was to emphasize "China's principled position on multiple issues," the ministry said. This included unspecified points about "the Asia-Pacific region, the Taiwan question and the
<a>American response</a> under the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The exercise took place on Tsutara—part of the Goto island group in Nagasaki Prefecture—involved the Japan Self-Defense Forces, the Japanese coast guard and police, the report said.
<a>Communist Party</a> tabloid the Global Times described the drills as "exposing Japan's right-wing militarist ambitions and its failure to reflect on history." The move was "obviously a provocation targeting China," said the paper.

<p>After an advertisement from the snack brand Three Squirrels drew backlash from critics who said it portrayed the derogatory Asian stereotype of "slanted eyes," the Chinese model shown in the ad defended her participation.</p>
<p>In a post on the Chinese microblogging site Weibo, the model, under the username of Cai Niangniang, decried the personal backlash she received for her involvement and said that she felt "really helpless."</p>
<p>"Just because my eyes are small, I'm not good enough to be a Chinese person? I don't know what to say to these comments," she wrote.</p>
<p>Critics had accused the model of spreading the Western "slanted eyes" stereotype in the Three Squirrels ad for noodle products on its Weibo account.</p>
<p>"As a professional model, what I need to do is be photographed accordingly to what the client wants, I don't know how this became about me humiliating the Chinese people," Cai said.</p>
<p>"I hope people online would stop messaging me with personal attacks. I'm not a supermodel nor am I a public figure, I'm just someone who loves my motherland and a law-abiding citizen," she added.</p>
<p>Her response to the criticism received more than 330 million views, according to China's communist party publication Global Times.</p>
<p>Mercedes Benz also was attacked by some Chinese online who accused it of using a model with "slanted eyes" in its advertisements on Weibo. The company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>The "slanted eyes" stereotype emerged in the West in the 19th century and is considered offensive and derogatory to Asians.</p>
<p>"In response to the feedback from netizens that the model's makeup does not conform to publicly-accepted aesthetics standards and caused discomfort, our company apologizes," the statement read.</p>
<p>"The page has been replaced and arrangements have been made to check other company pages to ensure that this situation will not happen again."</p>
<p>Online, Chinese internet users have criticized the selection of models and makeup styles to deliberately portray the "slanted eyes" image.</p>
<p>One user with the handle MaoBuErXiong said that such slanted eyes imagery is derogatory and is deeply embedded in the fashion industry, with Asian models and their makeup styles often selected to fit a stereotype.</p>

<div> World Taiwan <a>China</a></div>
<p>The most senior American official in Taiwan says the United States has "strongly encouraged" <a>China</a> to stop its frequent military flights near the island.</p>
<a>miscalculation</a>" between the governments across the Taiwan Strait, the narrow body of water that separates democratic Taiwan from the People's Republic of China (PRC).
<a>reached more than 940</a> since January. The flights now total 961 as of December 28, with an additional five Chinese military planes detected inside the ADIZ on the day, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry
<a>intimidate Taiwan</a> and put off the U.S., too—Oudkirk said: "We believe that those air incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone are destabilizing. They run the risk of miscalculation."
<p>"We have strongly encouraged the PRC to stop doing that," she told Du, stressing that the U.S. has also been <a>outspoken</a> about Beijing's actions in the <a>South China Sea</a>.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> administration's broader strategy of
<a>rallying allies</a> around issues of global concern, including peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait—a fact not lost on the Chinese leadership.
<p>She also emphasized the agency of the Taiwanese people in any decision about the island's political future, a topic that has been spotlighted amid a high-profile tussle for primacy between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>China's 961 military aircraft sorties around Taiwan are nearly triple the 380 flights detected by Taipei in 2020. The actions have alarmed not only the U.S., but also <a>regional</a> <a>allies</a> including <a>Japan</a> and <a>Australia</a>.</p>
<p>Taiwan's air force has scrambled jets to intercept at least 1,131 Chinese warplanes since the Taiwanese Defense Ministry began publishing ADIZ incursion data in September 2020.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden signed off on the $770 billion National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which will fund the U.S. Department of Defense and chart a path forward as to where the nation will focus its military resources in the year ahead.</p>
<p>Among the bill's priorities include a $7.1 billion carveout for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, <a>a program that will</a> bolster U.S. defense operations in the Pacific region and in invest in alliances aimed to counter China.</p>
<p>China did not take kindly to the measures, with Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian decrying the new China-focused actions as "political manipulation" that reflected an "obsolete Cold War" mentality.</p>
<a>Brookings Institutionwrites</a> that "many" see the rate of China's expansion in the region as moving faster than would be "considered a natural reflection of China's growing economic and geopolitical clout."
<a>CNN</a> town hall, Biden was asked if the U.S. would come to Taiwan's defense if China attacked. To which he said, "Yes, we have a commitment to do that." Not long after, Secretary of State
<a>Antony Blinken</a> released a statement in support of Taiwan, saying:
<p>Donald Trump has accused President Joe Biden of "surrendering" to COVID-19 and joining <a>China</a>'s "coverup" of the virus' origins by failing to put pressure on Beijing.</p>
<p>In a lengthy year-end newsletter to his supporters on Tuesday, the former president praised his administration's coronavirus response and concluded that he handled the pandemic "exceptionally well." "It's not even close," he wrote.</p>
<a>said it was "so obvious"</a> that the virus escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan. In August, however, the Intelligence Community (IC)
<a>found evidence</a> of the so-called "lab leak" theory to be inconclusive, after Biden gave agencies 90 days to have another look.
<p>In his newsletter, the former president accused Biden of "bowing down to China" and joining Beijing's coverup.</p>
<p>"The Biden administration has continually refused to hold China accountable for its role in the deadly spread of the coronavirus, opposing President Trump's <a>demand</a> that China <a>pay</a> trillions of dollars for the damage it has caused."</p>
<p>Trump homed in on the U.S.'s reported COVID-19 death toll, which remains the highest in the world and has more than doubled since Trump left office in January 2021.</p>
<p>"One year in, Joe Biden is a failed president who has surrendered to the virus and broken his number one promise to the American people: to end the pandemic once-and-for-all," Trump said. He suggested Biden "should be removed from office."</p>
<p>Biden's immediate challenge is to address a shortage of at-home rapid tests while continuing to vaccinate the nation—only 61.8 percent of the population has been fully vaccinated so far. Trump called the lack of access to tests a "national scandal."</p>
<p>On Monday, Biden said he would back state governors as they battle the Omicron variant—now the dominant strain in the U.S.—over the holiday period.</p>
<a>WHO</a>'s next phase of origin tracing, which includes another look at the environment surrounding Wuhan as well as the
<a>Wuhan Institute of Virology</a>. China has expressly
<a>rejected</a> the proposal while also pushing its own conspiracy theory about COVID-19 being an American bioweapon.
