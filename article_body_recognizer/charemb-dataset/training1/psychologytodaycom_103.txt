<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Anxiety? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist to overcome anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Since last summer, my practice has been overwhelmed with distress calls from people coping with anxiety in our current political environment. </p>
<a>stress</a>, nervousness, and resentment that has intruded into many people’s lives and intimate relationships, the likes of which I’ve not seen in nearly 30 years of clinical work.
<p>Some people are worried about losing their health care or about future economic distress. Others are angry about the travel ban while others <a>fear</a> for their civil rights and personal safety. The list of concerns is daunting.</p>
<a>anxious</a> since the election, you’re not alone. In fact, according to a recent survey, you’re in the majority. “
<a>smoking</a> more often, eating unhealthily, or arguing with loved ones more frequently as a result of their election-induced anxiety.
<p>If you’re among the tens of millions currently anxious in our nervous nation, here are few things you can do:</p>
<a>goals</a>, or experiences. These can be work, school, parents, professional, neighborhood, religious, or sports associations. And don’t forget your
<a>spiritual</a> connection, which can be some expression of religious values or meditative experience or appreciation of natural and creative beauty. Whatever means the most to you, do more of it in these unsettling times.
<p>Appreciate Your Ability to Cope</p>
<p>Walk 30 minutes a day. Studies show that this simple exercise can be as beneficial as anti-anxiety <a>medication</a>, with none of the side effects and lots of health benefits.</p>
<p>Write down your anxious thoughts. When anxious or nervous, our thoughts go by very fast, and the faster they go, the more overwhelming they seem. To slow down the flow, sit down with a pad and paper and write them down in longhand. </p>

<h2> How the DSM Has Changed Over Time </h2>
<a>ceased to classify homosexuality as a form of mental illness</a> in 1973. Other shifts have been controversial, including the omission of Asperger’s disorder from the DSM-5 in favor of a broader autism spectrum disorder category.
<div> <h3> What are the current disorder categories in the DSM-5? </h3> </div>
<a>Obsessive-Compulsive</a> and Related Disorders,
<a>Gender Dysphoria</a>, Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders, Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders, Neurocognitive Disorders, Personality Disorders, Paraphilic Disorders, Other Mental Disorders,
<a>Medication</a>-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects of Medication, and Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical
<div> <h3> What changes were incorporated into the DSM-5? </h3> </div>
<p>The <a>DSM-5 departed from the previous version</a> in several ways. A few of the key changes include:</p>
<p>• Eliminating the multi-axial diagnostic system that required clinicians to rate each client according to criteria other than their main psychological disorder.</p>
<p>• Replacing the diagnoses “<a>Autistic</a> Disorder” and “Asperger’s Disorder” with the overarching label “Autism Spectrum Disorder.”</p>
<p>• Establishing “Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders” as its own group of disorders rather than an anxiety disorder.</p>
<p>• Establishing <a>PTSD</a> as a “Trauma and Stressor-Related Disorder” rather than an anxiety disorder.</p>
<a>Alcohol Abuse</a>" and "Alcohol Dependence" with the overarching label "Alcohol Use Disorder," characterized as mild, moderate, or severe based on the number of symptoms present. The same goes for other diagnoses related to
<p>• Changing diagnoses with stigmatizing terminology, such as replacing the diagnosis “Mental Retardation” with “Intellectual Disability.” </p>
<p>• Removing the exception of <a>bereavement</a> for the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.</p>
<p>• Adding the diagnosis “Mild Neurocognitive Impairment” to categorize <a>cognition</a> problems in old age.</p>
<p>• Reclassifying <a>childhood</a> disorders such as <a>ADHD</a> as neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>
<p>• Adding the diagnosis of “Binge-<a>Eating Disorder</a>.”</p>
<div> <h3> What are some criticisms of the changes made to the DSM-5? </h3> </div>
<a>writes</a> Allen Frances, chair of the DSM-IV Task Force and a professor emeritus at Duke, which could lead to misdiagnosis and overprescribing, especially for children.
<a>concerning changes of the DSM-5,</a> Frances believed, include incorporating grief into major depressive disorder, diagnosing typical forgetting in old age as Minor Neurocognitive Disorder, and introducing the concept of behavioral addictions.
<div> <h3> Are there alternative diagnostic manuals to the DSM? </h3> </div>
<a>alternative to the DSM.</a> It contains diagnostic codes used for tracking incidence and prevalence rates, as well as for health insurance reimbursement, for mental and physical disease diagnoses.
<p>Other alternatives to the DSM include the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual (PDM), <a>Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP),</a> Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), and Power Threat Meaning Framework (PTMF).</p>
<div> <h3> What is HiTOP? </h3> </div>
<a>Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP)</a>—accounts for mental illness at multiple conceptual levels. It covers specific symptoms (such as avoidance,
<a>suicidality</a>) and traits (callousness, distractibility), but also more general factors with names such as Distress and
<a>Fear</a>. The DSM, by contrast, tends to be categorical and binary.
<article> <div> <div> <a> The Myth of Sex Addiction </a> </div> <div> Actor James Franco claims that 'sex addiction' contributed to indiscretions with former students. Is this a valid diagnostic category? The evidence is mixed. </div> </div> </article>
<div> A British judge is blocking the extradition to the U.S. of Julian Assange on the basis of autism and related suicide risk. This raises questions about forensic uses of the category. </div>
<div> <div> <a> The History of Gay Liberation </a> </div> <div> The documentary Cured chronicles the years-long campaign which led the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to remove homosexuality from its manual of mental disorders. </div> </div>

<h2> Understanding Thrill-Seeking </h2>
<a>fear</a> the risks that accompany activities like mountaineering, cliff diving, gambling, or experimenting with drugs.
<div> <h3> What is sensation-seeking? </h3> </div>
<a>drive for new, exotic, and intense experiences.</a> As pioneering psychologist Marvin Zuckerman summarized it, “sensation seeking is a
<div> <h3> What are examples of sensation-seeking behavior? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do I take risks? </h3> </div>
<a>the characteristic encompasses four components.</a> First, an innate quest for adventure and risk. Second, a love for varied and novel sensations. Third, a natural ability to be disinhibited and unrestrained. Fourth, susceptibility to
<a>boredom</a>. The extent to which individuals possess these four traits determines how they approach or avoid new sensations.
<div> <h3> What’s the difference between risk-taking and sensation-seeking? </h3> </div>
<p>Sensation-seeking is the drive to pursue new or intense experiences, and in that process, the danger of physical, social, or financial risks can be disregarded. But <a>risks and danger don’t motivate sensation-seekers</a>—novelty does.</p>
<div> <h3> Can you be addicted to adrenaline? </h3> </div>
<a>releases more dopamine</a> and less norepinephrine in high sensation-seekers than low-sensation seekers. The high thrill and minimal
<a>stress</a> may drive sensation-seekers to repeatedly seek out new, exciting experiences.
<div> <h3> What is the Zuckerman Sensation Seeking Scale? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Lessons from Sensation-Seekers </h2>
<p>Sensation-seekers embody valuable attitudes and traits. The unique experiences they chase can cultivate joy, fulfillment, and coveted memories. New adventures provide an opportunity to grow and expand one’s sense of self.</p>
<a>Bystander Effect</a> demonstrates the tendency to
<a>shy</a> away from unsettling circumstances. But thrill-seekers charge headlong into the fray and trust themselves to respond accordingly.
<a>confidence</a> in one’s ability to conquer future obstacles. Placing oneself in an unfamiliar or even perilous situation—learning to scuba dive or pilot a plane—pushes a person out of their comfort zone, forces them to pay complete
<a>attention</a> to a task, and instills confidence in their mind, body, and instincts.
<div> <h3> What can we learn from sensation-seekers? </h3> </div>
<a>provide valuable lessons</a>, such as the
<a>motivation</a> to cultivate memorable experiences, expand one’s sense of self, and develop confidence and
<a>resilience</a> from conquering challenges. People who don’t overanalyze or fear uncertainty are also more likely to take on
<a>leadership</a> roles or respond in a crisis.
<div> <h3> Is it good to be a risk-taker? </h3> </div>
<a>less stress, more positive emotions, and greater life satisfaction.</a> In addition to these beneficial outcomes, however, sensation-seeking may be accompanied by dangers as well.
<div> <h3> How can I overcome my fears? </h3> </div>
<a>Anxiety</a> can prevent people from embarking on new experiences and adventures, but
<a>exposure therapy</a> can help overcome those fears. Exposure
<a>therapy</a> is the practice of gradually and safely exposing yourself to the object or situation that you fear, in order to
<a>eliminate the fear response that developed</a>.
<div> <h3> Can excitement enhance romance? </h3> </div>
<a>attraction</a>, in the case of strangers, and affection, in the case of couples. The excitement from a roller coaster ride or just a suspenseful movie
<a>may intensify emotion later,</a> so adventurous, spontaneous, and exciting experiences may help bond people together.
<div> <div> <a> A Meaningful Life Includes Gambling for the Desired Outcome </a> </div> <div> Do you take chances ("gamble) about your future absent knowing the true odds (like you know in a casino)? Many of us do. Here is why. </div> </div>

<p>And what is the result of this increased scrutiny? We are increasingly inundated with reports of hypocritical and even blatantly unethical behavior on the part of major politicians. </p>

<div> <h3> What is the least common personality disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Dependent personality disorder seems to be the least common personality disorder in Western samples, with an estimated prevalence of about 0.8 percent.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Can you have more than one personality disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What causes a personality disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>genetics</a>. For some conditions, research suggests, adverse experiences such as
<a>childhood</a> abuse may also contribute to the risk, though a personality disorder can develop in the absence of such experiences.

<a>Cluster B</a>, and Cluster C are three groupings of personality disorder categories used in the
<div> <h3> Are personality disorders considered a mental illness? </h3> </div>

<div> <h3> Can personality disorders be cured? </h3> </div>
<a>may never go away</a> entirely, research indicates that a person can show
<a>decreased symptoms over time</a>. Therapy can also be helpful for certain conditions. A number of approaches have been used in the treatment of borderline personality disorder, including Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and psychodynamic
<a>psychotherapy</a>. In some cases, psychotropic drugs—such as
<a>antipsychotics</a>—may be used as part of the treatment of personality disorder symptoms.
<div> <h3> What can you do if you think someone has a personality disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>precautions that could be helpful</a> in dealing with someone who has a personality disorder, including limiting time together and avoiding topics that lead to friction or conflict.
<div> <h3> What is the most difficult personality disorder to treat? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Antisocial personality disorder can be exceptionally challenging to treat, in part because those with this disorder may be inclined to create the appearance of change in order to get what they want (such as release from incarceration).</p> </div>
<div> <h3> Do personality disorders get worse with age? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Not necessarily. There is evidence, for example, that many people with borderline personality disorder may show <a>reductions in certain symptoms</a> over time.</p> </div> </div>

<a>narcissism</a>, Machiavellianism, and
<a>psychopathy</a>—which share some common malevolent features. The construct was coined by researchers Delroy L. Paulhus and Kevin M. Williams in 2002.

<a>narcissism</a>, and Machiavellianism three distinct traits with overlapping characteristics, others believe the commonalities suggest an underlying
<div> <h3> How is psychopathy related to the dark triad? </h3> </div>
<a>empathy</a> and remorse—to be the “darkest” of the Dark Triad, in so far as psychopaths generally cause more harm to individuals and to society than do narcissists or "High Machs." 
<a>“Psychopath” is not a mental health diagnosis</a>; the disorder that most closely represents it in the
<div> <h3> What is Machiavellianism? </h3> </div>
<a>goals</a>. It is based on the political
<a>philosophy</a> of the 16th-century writer Niccolò Machiavelli. Some evidence suggests that of the dark traits,
<a>Machiavellianism is most closely tied to high intelligence</a>. If a psychologist refers to someone as "High Mach," it means they behave in a highly manipulative manner. 
<div> <h3> How is narcissism related to the Dark Triad? </h3> </div>
<a>excessive self-regard and heightened arrogance</a>. While many narcissists are merely frustrating, extreme or “malignant” narcissists can become

<p>Why do people vote for a particular political party? The conventional answer is voters value certain policies and favor parties that promote those policies. So, the voters elect politicians who represent those parties.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, how do voters know a politician, once elected, will act as he or she promised during the campaign?</p>
<p>The answer may have to do with the candidate’s personality.</p>
<p>Indeed, elected politicians typically possess high levels of personality traits associated with leadership—traits like <a>emotional stability</a> and extraversion (also written as <a>extroversion</a>).</p>
<p>In short, a voter would likely favor a politician who resembles him or her, but who also has leadership qualities he or she does not possess.</p>
<h3>The personality traits of ideal politicians</h3>
<p>The above hypotheses were tested in two studies in Germany and Austria. Researchers asked participants about their personality traits, personality traits they would prefer to see in politicians, and traits good politicians must possess.</p>
