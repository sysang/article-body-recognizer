<p>Prosecutors in Nassau County, New York, will not bring charges against former Gov. <a>Andrew Cuomo</a> over sexual misconduct allegations that came out of a state attorney general's investigation.</p>
<p>A statement from Acting Nassau County District Attorney Joyce Smith issued Thursday said that Smith's office had "concluded" its probe into an alleged incident from September 2019 that was said to have taken place at the Belmont Racetrack. </p>

<p>The judge also noted that the committee had postponed Flynn's deposition date to a "date to be determined" and there was "no evidence in the record as to the date by which the select committee now expects Flynn to comply with its document requests."</p>
<p>Scriven also said Flynn's lawyers did not notify the party's being sued, Pelosi and the committee, about the restraining order request which is required by federal rules. </p>
<p>Scriven did leave the door open for Flynn to ask for the restraining order again if he can rectify the issues she outlined.</p>
<p>REPUBLICAN REP. SCOTT PERRY REFUSES INTERVIEW WITH JAN. 6 COMMISSION CLAIMING IT IS 'ILLEGITIMATE'</p>
<p>In the Tuesday lawsuit, Flynn’s lawyers maintained he was not involved in the organization or the actual events of Jan. 6. </p>
<p>"General Flynn did not organize, speak at, or actively participate in any rallies or protests in Washington, D.C., on January 6, 2021, and he of course did not participate in the attack on the Capitol that day," the lawsuit states. </p>
<p>The lawsuit also argues that Flynn’s First Amendment rights have been violated. </p>
<p>Flynn was subpoenaed by the committed last month based on comments he made on television and a meeting he had with President Trump in December 2020.</p>

<p>It is not the party that once allowed for and encouraged free thought and robust debate. Now, it is a mob that drives policy decisions with the goal of starting over with a new system of governance.</p>
<p>The picture of Republicans that is painted by Democrats and their allies in the media is mostly false; in fact, many of my former colleagues firmly believe the Republican Party is the sole cause of many societal ills.</p>
<blockquote><p>We cannot stand by and idly watch; we must be actively involved in the fight for this nation. </p> </blockquote>

<p>I will always be focused on supporting proposals that keep America strong and prosperous. We must continue to provide our society with the opportunities on which our past, present and future generations have and will continue to thrive.</p>
<p>We cannot stand by and idly watch; we must be actively involved in the fight for this nation.</p>

<h1>DC vax mandate would disproportionately affect Black residents, data suggests</h1>
<h2>Only 39% of Black residents in DC are fully vaccinated</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Mayor Bowser punts question on whether lockdowns will come back to D.C</a></h4> <p>Mayor Muriel Bowser says that Washington D.C. will ‘make changes as necessary.’</p></div></div>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>The new <a><u>COVID-19</u></a> vaccination mandate in <a><u>Washington, D.C.</u></a> would disproportionately impact Black residents in the city, vaccination data suggests.</p>
<p>D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced on Wednesday that she would be implementing a vaccination requirement for residents starting Jan. 15.</p>
<p>Vaccination data shows, however, that Bowser’s mandate would have a disproportionate effect on minorities in the city, in particular with Black residents.</p>
<p><a><u>OUTRAGE AFTER DC MAYOR BOWSER’S NEW COVID VACCINE ORDER: ‘WILL KILL BUSINESSES NOT VIRUSES’</u></a></p>
<div> <div><p> D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser at Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, on Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>According to the city’s most updated <a><u>vaccination data</u></a>, the vaccination rate for Black residents in D.C. is 46.4%, with only 39.4% of vaccinated Black residents being fully vaccinated.</p>

<p>Bowser announced the vaccine mandate during a press conference and in a tweet thread on Wednesday, becoming the latest blue city to adopt such a measure.</p>
<p><a>DC RESIDENTS SPEAK OUT AFTER NIGHT OF BRAZEN SHOOTINGS: 'DEFINITELY AN INCREASE IN VIOLENCE'</a></p>
<p>The mandate requires D.C. residents to show proof of vaccination to enter restaurants, bars, nightclubs, indoor entertainment facilities, gyms and indoor meeting establishments.</p>
<p>Bowser's order reads that people 12 and older must have at least one dose of the vaccine, which will be upped to two doses by Feb. 15. Her order comes on the heels of similar policies in New York City, Chicago, and Boston.</p>

<p>The mandate elicited <a>angry responses</a> online, with some warning of the economic consequences of implementing the mandate.</p>
<p>Additionally, critics pointed out that Bowser’s approach to COVID restrictions is much more involved than her administration’s addressing the <a>violent crime surge</a> in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>Bowser's office did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.</p>

<h1>Biden urged to bow out while Democrats seek alternative for 2024</h1>
<p>If President <a>Biden</a> had not spent months touting the virtues of his massive <a>spending bill</a>, the capitulation would not seem as much of a defeat.</p>
<p>Now the nearly $2 trillion measure is not going to get a vote before the end of the year, which in my view means it may never pass, given that next year is all about the midterms.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that Biden got his infrastructure bill by promising House progressives a vote on Build Back Better, and now, unable to devise any compromise that would satisfy <a>Joe Manchin</a>, it’s dead for 2021 – and perhaps beyond. </p>
<p>The decision to keep pushing this Medicare/climate change/tax credit/pre-kindergarten bill, rather than declare victory after getting infrastructure, is a monumental political miscalculation.</p>
<a>Kentucky</a> on Wednesday to view the tornado damage. Yes, he gives repetitive speeches about legislation that generate little coverage. Yes, he chats up
<a>Jimmy Fallon</a> while avoiding serious media interviews.
<p>But the fact that he can’t drive the coverage – or get 48 Democratic senators (plus two independents who caucus with them) to support his top domestic priority – is a glaring sign of weakness.</p>

<p>Not long ago, there was a wave of media stories expressing doubt that the beleaguered president will run for reelection, a full three years before said election. Biden insists he will seek a second term, at 82, but the doubts are growing louder.</p>
<p>What I said at the time is that it’s unlikely Biden has made a final decision, and if he had decided not to run again it would be insane to announce so far in advance.</p>

<p>Now comes New York Times conservative columnist Bret Stephens to <a>say</a> that Biden should tell the world, "much sooner than later, that he will not run for a second term."</p>
<p>Stephens concedes that this would turn Biden into an instant lame duck.</p>
<a>Democratic</a> field by not bowing to the inevitable. But Stephens, saying Biden’s performance ranges from "cogent" to "uneven" to "incoherent," insists: "Far from weakening him, it would instantly allow him to be statesmanlike."

<p><a><u>WHY TIME TAPPED ELON MUSK, MASTER INVENTOR AND QUIRKY ZILLIONAIRE</u></a></p>
<p>I think the age factor will make it difficult for Biden to run again, even if his political fortunes rebound, but am just addressing when he would go public with his plans.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an earlier <a>Times</a> story essentially provided the 2024 handicapping for the Democrats if Biden stepped aside (though no potential contender is allowed to say that out loud). CNN's Chris Cillizza just posted his own list.</p>
<p><a>Kamala Harris</a> and <a>Pete Buttigieg</a> are in the Times story, of course, along with <a>Elizabeth Warren</a> (though she got clobbered last time) and <a>Amy Klobuchar</a> (who’s since had a bout with cancer).</p>

<p>Mitch Landrieu is getting a lot of notice from what the late Times columnist Russell Baker used to call the Great Mentioner, especially now that the former <a>New Orleans</a> mayor is now the infrastructure czar.</p>
<p>And Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo also seems to have a direct line to the Great Mentioner.</p>
<p>The list goes on to greater long shots. And the media chatter is obviously a sign that many Democrats are hedging their bets or plotting their futures in case the nomination is up for grabs.</p>
<p>But that’s still better for Joe Biden than a premature abdication. </p>
