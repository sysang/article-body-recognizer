<h2> Knowing your genetic risk is key to knowing your chance of developing problems. </h2>
<p>The data bear out this trend: <a>alcohol sales are soaring</a>, with a 55 percent increase in a single week as shelter in place orders were issued across the nation.</p>
<p>What’s behind this increase? Why are so many people drinking more during the COVID-19 pandemic? More importantly, should we be worried?</p>
<p>I am a researcher who studies risk for alcohol use problems. I’ve written hundreds of papers on why some people develop problems and others don’t, analyzing data from thousands of research participants.</p>
<p>Here’s what we know: changes in <a>the environment</a> change the likelihood that people will develop problems. Environments that are more permissive or accepting of alcohol use increase the likelihood that people will use.</p>
<a>anxiety</a>-reducing effects, and let’s be honest, a lot of people are feeling a lot of anxiety right now.
<p>But here’s the part most people don’t realize: the people who are most at risk are the ones who are genetically predisposed to develop problems.</p>
<h3>How do you know if you are at increased risk? </h3>
<a>to find the genetic variations</a> that make people more at risk, but there are likely tens of thousands of them, and so we’re still a far way off from being able to give people accurate genetic risk scores.
<a>genes</a> can alter our risk for substance use problems. Some genes increase our tendency toward
<a>depression</a> or anxiety. People who carry these genetic variants are more likely to use alcohol to cope, which increases their risk of developing alcohol use disorders.
<a>risk-taking</a>, or needing more alcohol to experience effects—it’s a good idea to keep an eye on your alcohol consumption during the pandemic.
<p>If you are concerned about your drinking, the <a>National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism</a> has resources to help you <a>cut down on your drinking</a> or <a>find an alcohol treatment provider</a>.</p>

<h1> Thoughtful Management: What It Is and Why It’s Important </h1>
<h2> It’s not an oxymoron, but a succinct description for effective management. </h2>
<p>Thoughtful, as defined by Merriam-Webster, means: 1. characterized by careful reasoned thinking; 2. given to or chosen or made with heedful anticipation of the needs and wants of others.</p>
<p>As someone who has studied organizational behavior for 25 years, I am increasingly convinced that this word simultaneously captures two elements that are critical for effective management.</p>
<a>Hard Facts</a>, EBM argues that decisions should be based on facts and evidence rather than hope,
<a>fear</a>, instinct, what others are doing, what has been done in the past, or other inadequate bases.
<a>organizational justice</a> indicates that understanding the why behind managerial decisions is critical for employees to feel that those decisions are fair.
<p>Given its importance, why is it so hard to thoughtfully manage? Below, I highlight three obstacles and briefly propose how organizations can overcome them.</p>
<a>decision making</a> are not penalized for engaging in such behavior. Finally, top managers should be
<a>mindful</a> of the signals that they send about the use and importance of thoughtful management because their behavior tends to trickle down.
<a>competition</a>, even within their own organization. As a result, rather than fostering
<a>cooperation</a> and teamwork, organizations often encourage competition and individualism even when doing so can contribute to
<a>stress</a>, dysfunction, and unethical decision making. For this reason, managers may need to change the fundamental way they see organizational life, which may be difficult given that popular culture, including
<a>movies</a> and television, often depicts organization life as dysfunctional and cutthroat.
<p>To some, it may sound like an oxymoron, but thoughtful management, which emphasizes careful thinking and meeting the needs and wants of employees, can increase managerial and organizational effectiveness.</p>

<h1> How to Measure Well-Being </h1>
<h2> Challenges, recommendations, and new horizons on well-being assessment. </h2>
<li>The flourishing index assesses aspects of well-being—health, happiness, meaning, relationships, character—widely desired for their own sake.</li>
<li>Different well-being assessments are recommended for different contexts depending on the intended purpose and time or space available.</li>
<li>Universal and individual aspects of well-being should be assessed, as well as culturally or religiously specific and communal aspects.</li>

<h2> The concept of flourishing has the potential to transform clinical care. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>The concept of flourishing has the potential to transform clinical care.</div> <div>Source: Adobe Spark</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In May, we published a <a>Viewpoint piece in the Journal of the American Medical Association</a> on how the concept and measurement of flourishing are relevant for medical practice.</p>
<p>People certainly care a great deal about health, but they care about other things as well—about being happy, and having a sense of purpose, and trying to be a good person, and having good relationships.</p>
<a>elsewhere</a> that flourishing involves numerous domains of life, including
<a>happiness</a> and life satisfaction, physical and mental health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, and close social relationships.
<p>In these cases, we believe that looking at clinical decisions through a lens of flourishing can be helpful. Examples we’ve given in our papers or presentations have included:</p>
<p>1. A man wrestling with treatment decisions over relatively advanced stage bladder cancer, thinking that a cystectomy will maximize life expectancy, but may severely hamper the quality of life and happiness</p>
<p>3. A chef faces surgery options for his tongue cancer that might maximize his chances of survival, but would impede speech and effectively end his <a>career</a>.</p>
<a>burnout</a>. Physician burnout has been documented as an increasing problem over the past years, and one that threatens the practice of medicine. But
<a>research</a> suggests that a focus on improving a sense of meaning, of control, and of
<a>optimism</a> might help protect against such burnout.
<p>Our <a>flourishing measure</a> can be useful in assessing flourishing for both patients and clinicians alike. It can be useful for research purposes, or for a simple check-in with regard to how various aspects of life are going.</p>
<p>We’ve included the 12 questions from our flourishing index in the image below, and you are of course welcome to use it for your own reflection for these purposes, or in <a>research</a>.</p>

<h3>Economic and Social Contexts</h3>
<a>coronavirus</a> (COVID-19) will likely yet further increase these stresses as potential causes of despair.

<h1> How Religious Community Is Linked to Human Flourishing </h1>
<h2> An analysis explores how service attendance relates to health and well-being. </h2>
<li>An analysis of data from tens of thousands of people found that those who regularly attended religious services were, on average, less likely to become depressed, to smoke, or to drink heavily.</li>
<li>Regular service attendance was also related to a lower likelihood of dying during a study's follow-up period.</li>
<li>People who frequently attend services may benefit from higher life satisfaction, purpose in life, and other indicators of flourishing. </li>
<a>psychological distress</a>. There is also some evidence for an effect on a number of other health and well-being outcomes. However, as noted in both our earlier
<a>long-form</a> reviews of the religious service attendance literature, the existing longitudinal evidence for other outcomes is often limited to only a few studies per outcome (and sometimes just a single study!). We need more evidence.

<a>loneliness</a>; slightly larger effects on increasing positive affect and life satisfaction over time; and notably larger effects on social integration (even non-religious forms) and on purpose in life.
<a>prior work</a>, we, in contrast, found a fairly sizeable effect on survival from cancer and heart disease, even though there was more limited evidence for effects on the incidence of these diseases. It may be that in some cases, religion and

<h2> Single people want places that feel like home, but face needless challenges. </h2>
<li>Single people face unique challenges in finding a place that feels like home.</li>
<li>Parents often fret that their single adult children will be lonely living alone, but the reverse is often true.</li>
<li>Builders, architects, and policymakers haven't yet caught up to these new visions of home for those who are happily single.</li>
<p>People who are single and have no children sometimes return to nuclear family homes, either to visit or to stay. Then, the contrast between sentimentalized notions of home and how it actually feels to be in a nuclear family home can be striking.</p>

<blockquote> <p>“…although many respondents had created new forms of home, <a>intimacy</a>, and belonging, this does not mean that these new intimate attachments were validated or supported by law or policy.”</p> </blockquote>
