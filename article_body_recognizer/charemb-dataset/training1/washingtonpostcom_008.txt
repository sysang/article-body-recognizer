<div><h1>For both U.S. national soccer teams, it’s a massive year</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steven Goff</div></div>Reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 9:23 a.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 12:31 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The U.S. men’s and women’s national soccer teams are accustomed to operating on separate timetables, their priorities set by World Cups and qualifying scrums that fall in different years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2022, however, the ambitions of American soccer’s flagship squads will overlap during a few vital months and carry enormous consequences.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By the end of March, a young men’s troupe nurtured by Gregg Berhalter will have booked a ticket to the World Cup late this year in Qatar — or flamed out for the second consecutive cycle.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Carlos Cordeiro, who left USSF amid equal-pay fight, wants his old job back</p></div>
<p>By the end of July, <a>the women’s team</a> — top-ranked for almost five years but undergoing renovations after another Olympic mishap — will have completed efforts to qualify for the 2023 World Cup and 2024 Summer <a>Olympics</a>.</p>
<a>Australia and New Zealand for the 2023 world championship</a> and a possible third consecutive title.
<a>and still haunted by the disastrous 2018 qualifying campaign</a> — the men cannot afford to stumble. The women have little to worry about, though transition is often imperfect.
<div><div><p>The 2022 mash-up is the result of pandemic-influenced scheduling changes to the men’s World Cup qualifying slate and sweeping changes to the women’s qualifying formats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With eight of 14 games out of the way, the Americans are in good standing. They sit <a>second in an eight-team group</a> offering three automatic berths in Qatar and an intercontinental playoff spot to a fourth country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They’re one point behind upstart Canada but also just one point ahead of both Mexico and Panama. The other four challengers are well back.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Given its personnel and resources, the United States should always finish first or second. Even with the youngest roster in history, that remains true.</p></div></div>
<a>the failure of a veteran squad to qualify for the 2018 World Cup</a>, is carrying a heavy burden.
<a>1-0 victory </a>over Bosnia in Carson, Calif. Because the camp fell outside an official FIFA window, the top European-based players were unavailable.
<a>the Winter Classic </a>isn’t just for hockey anymore. In between, they will face Canada in Hamilton, Ontario.
<a>Concacaf W Championship</a> in July.
<div><p>And the pathway to the World Cup has gotten easier: With the 2023 tournament expanding to 32 teams from 24, Concacaf will receive four automatic berths instead of three. In addition, two teams will advance to intercontinental playoffs.</p></div>
<div><div><p>For the first time, Concacaf also will use the tournament for Olympic qualifying. And the route to Paris is perilous.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Only the tournament champion will receive an automatic berth. The second- and third-place teams will clash in a separate playoff for the region’s other bid.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The first test of the year will come Feb. 17-23 at the <a>seventh annual SheBelieves Cup</a> against New Zealand, Iceland and Czech Republic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like the men’s squad, the women’s performance in the coming weeks will foretell whether it’s on the right path in 2022 — or in need of urgent repair.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Two years after he resigned amid the U.S. women’s national soccer team’s equal-pay fight, Carlos Cordeiro says he wants to return as president of the sport’s American governing body.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He announced Wednesday that he will challenge incumbent Cindy Parlow Cone in the U.S. Soccer Federation election March 5. The former U.S. star is the first woman to lead the Chicago-based organization.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The deadline for entering the race was late Tuesday night. Although the USSF said it would not formally announce the list of candidates until later in the week, Cordeiro wrote on his campaign website that he will run again.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Stepping down as president — a job I loved — was deeply humbling,” he wrote. “In our lives, we can always learn from the past and do better in the future.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Analysis: For both U.S. national soccer teams, it’s a massive year</p></div>
<div><div><p>Cordeiro, 65, said USSF members on the state level nominated him to run again. In a message to them, he wrote, “In speaking with many of you, I’ve heard your desire for a new approach.”</p></div></div>
<a>ESPN story</a> about Cordeiro’s plans to run, the veteran winger questioned whether he had resigned under pressure or “embarrassed everything and everyone with caveman levels of misogyny?”
<div><div><p>His resignation ended a clumsy tenure that included multiple public statements that did not sit well with the women’s team.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>DeMar DeRozan burns the Wizards at the buzzer as the Bulls grab a 120-119 win</h1></div>
<h2>What to know from Washington’s loss to Chicago to open the new year Saturday at Capital One Arena</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ava Wallace</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:18 p.m. EST|Updated today at 11:19 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>The Washington Wizards opened the new year with a new feeling, an emotion that played out on the stunned faces of every player in front of their bench during the final second of a 120-119 loss to the Chicago Bulls on Saturday night.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Saturday’s buzzer-beater came less than four seconds after the Wizards’ Kyle Kuzma hit a three to put the Wizards up 119-117.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“S--- happens,” Kuzma said. “DeMar told me to hold my beer.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Heartbreak such as this was a foreign emotion for Washington, which was 6-0 in games decided by three points or fewer before Saturday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In addition to DeRozan’s game-winner, the Wizards endured a 35-point performance from LaVine. DeRozan ended up with 28 points, Vucevic had 22, and White added 20.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colombia’s first NBA player, Jaime Echenique, brings some joy to bleak covid month</p></div>
<div><div><p>With the ball in his hands more than usual, Beal dished a career-high 17 assists. He added 27 points for his second consecutive double-double. With 29 points and 12 rebounds, Kuzma had a double-double, too.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> health and safety protocols — in double figures. Deni Avdija had 10 points off the bench and performed admirably on the defensive end, successfully bothering DeRozan, LaVine and Vucevic at times.
<div><div><p>Here’s what else to know from Saturday’s loss:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Power in the paint</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>What they gave up on the perimeter the Wizards made up for under the basket. They had 72 points in the paint to the Bulls’ 30, all the more impressive considering Vucevic was in the fray.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Gafford gets going</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Last time out: Bradley Beal makes an in-form return, leads Wizards past Cavaliers</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Hot half</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Wizards shot 56.8 percent in the first half, efficiency that helped them weather Chicago’s onslaught from three.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Beal and Kuzma attributed the ball movement to more aggression on offense — an attempt to compensate for the key guards who were out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Waters comes aboard</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Washington’s coronavirus outbreak has been so debilitating that even its fill-in players are being affected. Wanamaker, who was added to the roster Thursday, entered the protocols after just one day and was unavailable Saturday.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I hope he took a nap quickly,” Unseld said of Waters, who had two points and a steal in eight minutes.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In Washington, he saw a chance to reach for something new. He wanted to be a leader.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kuzma led in a big way for the third straight game Monday night in a 124-121 win over the Charlotte Hornets at Capital One Arena.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unseld and Beal credited wider, more fluid spacing without a point guard on the floor, as well as pace and good defense.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Last time out: DeMar DeRozan burns the Wizards at the buzzer as the Bulls grab a 120-119 win</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Fit and opportunity is everything in this league,” Kuzma said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Beyond the three primary prongs of the Wizards’ offense, Bertans (14 points) and rookie Corey Kispert (12) had productive nights off the bench. Washington’s 16 threes helped make up for its 15 turnovers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gordon Hayward led Charlotte (19-19) with 27 points, and Terry Rozier had 25. Miles Bridges had 23 points and a season-high 14 rebounds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what else to know from Monday’s game:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Turnover trouble</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A slow second</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Wizards gave up the 13-point lead they had racked up in a superb first quarter with a much slower second. One big reason for the stagnation? Kuzma and Beal were locked up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kuzma had 13 points in the first quarter but just two in the second on 1-for-4 shooting. Beal had the ball in his hands more but was forced to make tougher shots and went 3 for 7, ending up with seven points in the quarter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Five turnovers in the period didn’t help, and Charlotte went into halftime with a 64-56 lead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Covid updates</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The small group of healthy Wizards guards may grow this week after Raul Neto cleared the NBA’s protocols Monday. Unseld is hopeful the backup guard will be available Wednesday against visiting Houston.</p></div></div>
<p>Thomas Bryant, who has yet to play this season after partially tearing his ACL last January, also cleared the protocols. His return is “further down the line,” Unseld said; the center has yet to participate in a five-on-five scrimmage.</p>
<div><div><p>Washington’s game at Brooklyn, which was postponed Dec. 21 because of the Nets’ <a>coronavirus</a> woes, was rescheduled for Feb. 17, the NBA announced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Hachimura still on track</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Rui Hachimura was on the cusp of making his season debut last week at Miami before he entered the coronavirus protocols. Unseld said he doesn’t expect Hachimura’s time away to significantly delay the forward’s return.</p></div>

<div><div><p>They came close. But for the second game in five days, the Wizards were undone by a game-sealing three in the dying moments and lost, <a>114-111</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just as DeMar DeRozan’s buzzer-beater did Saturday against Chicago, Kevin Porter Jr.'s long-range bomb stung because of how Washington (19-19) had battled back.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colombia's first NBA player, Jaime Echenique, brings some joy to a bleak covid month</p></div>
<div><p>“It’s unfortunate,” Kyle Kuzma said with a heavy sigh. “Kevin Porter made a hell of a shot. Great defense, just sometimes good players make big-time shots. Obviously throughout the game, it was tough.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Beal led with 27 points in 29 minutes and had five rebounds and five assists despite picking up fouls along the way. Caldwell-Pope added 26 points, and Kuzma had 24.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not having [Beal] out there late is a huge loss,” Unseld said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Christian Wood and Jalen Green had 22 points apiece for the Rockets.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what else to know from the Wizards’ loss:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Too many giveaways</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The Wizards had 15 turnovers for the second game in a row Wednesday. The Rockets didn’t make much of them, scoring just nine points, but the giveaways disrupted Washington’s offense and kept them from getting in rhythm all game.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Trouble from long range</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kuzma was the worst of the bunch, missing all eight of his attempts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Bertans injured</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unseld did not know the severity of the sprain immediately after the game.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bertans had improved his three-point shooting percentage from 25 percent in his first 15 games of the season to 45 percent in his past 10. His field goal percentage jumped from 28.8 to 46.8.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Three Wizards clear protocols</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Guards Dinwiddie and Holiday and forward Rui Hachimura cleared the protocols Wednesday, though they all sat out to ramp up their conditioning before they jump back into game play.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unseld hopes to have Dinwiddie and Holiday available to bolster a depleted group of guards for the Wizards’ upcoming trip to Chicago and Orlando. Hachimura’s return, meanwhile, is slightly further off.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s close,” Unseld said of the 23-year-old from Japan. “I don’t think there’s a definitive timetable, but he’s close.”</p></div></div>
<p>Four players remain in the coronavirus protocols: Montrezl Harrell, Anthony Gill, Tremont Waters and Brad Wanamaker. The Wizards signed Waters and Wanamaker to 10-day contracts as relief, and both entered the protocols after playing just one game.</p>

<div><div><p>He also has proved to be a valued leader for a team with many young players.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Charles Leno brings tradition of giving to DMV through ‘Leno Claus’</p></div>
<div><p>Rivera has noted how he often sees Leno talking to younger players from both the offense and defense to help them along. Before games, Leno is often working alongside younger offensive linemen, drilling on technique or offering advice.</p></div>
<a>within a 72-hour span</a>, Leno visited Washington at its Ashburn training facility, then raced back to Chicago to welcome the birth of his second daughter, then signed a one-year deal with Washington to start a new chapter in his career.

<div><div><p>The issues on the table are numerous and varied — and the expectation among multiple people involved in the negotiations is that no substantive progress will be made in addressing them until the new year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But to the extent that any one issue can be separated from the others, one of the widest gaps in these negotiations exists between the way the owners and players view the economics of the game.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Svrluga: Baseball’s lockout is about economics. What needs to be fixed is the sport.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Revenue increased in the years leading up to the pandemic, <a>according to data from Forbes</a>. But <a>average player salaries decreased</a> in that span, with no major jump to speak of since.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Unsurprisingly — given Commissioner Rob Manfred is employed to represent the interests of the owners and union head Tony Clark is in place to champion the players — the owners and the players disagree on how to do that.</p></div>
<a>Spotrac</a>, the richest players are seeing their salaries grow faster than the others: Since 2011, the average salary of the 30 highest-paid players has grown 4.4 percent, but salaries as a whole have increased less than 3 percent.
<div><p>Svrluga: Max Scherzer, a Met? Man, that doesn’t feel right.</p></div>
<a>a member of the MLB Players Association’s executive subcommittee</a> who recently signed a three-year deal with the New York Mets that
<a>will pay him a record $43.3 million annually</a>. “When certain parts of the market don’t function, well, then it drags down the whole kind of player market.”
<div><p>What to know about MLB’s lockout, offseason and CBA</p></div>
<div><p>Meanwhile, MLB is offering another solution: In his letter addressing the lockout, Manfred said the owners proposed an age-based free agency system designed to eliminate teams’ ability to manipulate the service time of players.</p></div>
<div><div><p>To the players, who believe ownership simply needs to invest more in rosters all around, the idea of costing top-tier stars a year or so of free agent money to benefit the middle class represents a false choice.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Owners are operating in a system that helps keep costs down for young players but also rewards the game’s biggest stars with the richest contracts in pro sports. They are not eager to let the market push their spending further.</p></div>

<div><p>Why baseball’s middle class matters so much in the MLB lockout</p></div>
<a>as an impediment to success</a> during their disappointing 2021 season.
<div><p>The secret settlements that helped a baseball star play on</p></div>
<a>hiring being announced during a lockout</a>, and every time he slipped and referenced a player, General Manager Billy Eppler and team president Sandy Alderson seemed to wince in front of their respective computer screens.
<div><p>The Nationals had MLB’s smallest player development staff. They plan to fix that.</p></div>
<div><p>“One of the biggest things I’m drawn to is teams and situations and organizations that can win consistently. It’s so hard to do,” Showalter said. “Especially winning when you’re expected to win.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Not a lot of lip service,” Showalter said. “It’s kind of a show-me situation.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Will there be a universal designated hitter?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>with a sense of inevitability</a>. Any new CBA would almost certainly include implementation of the designated hitter in the National League, or so the thinking went, in part because both team owners and players could find benefits in it.
<div><div><p>But in December, Commissioner Rob Manfred made a somewhat stunning admission: MLB and the players’ union had taken on-field changes off the negotiating table to focus solely on economics.</p></div></div>
