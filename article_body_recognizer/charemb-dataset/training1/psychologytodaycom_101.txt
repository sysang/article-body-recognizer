<p>The question that the public continues to ask, of course, is why. Why do men in positions of almost incalculable power choose to sexually harass and abuse others? When these men engage in sexual misbehavior, what, exactly, are they thinking?</p>
<a>divorced</a> from their actions. Think about Bill Clinton, a highly intelligent (Rhodes Scholar, Oxford) individual engaging in sexual misconduct in the Oval Office. Hardly the actions of a thinking man in his right mind.
<h3>Typical attempts to explain harassment</h3>
<a>rationalization</a>, blame, and
<a>denial</a>. They provide themselves, their therapist, their lawyer, their loved ones, and the public with all sorts of misinformation to explain their behaviors. Generally, these statements boil down to one or more of the following:
<li>All men behave this way. I’m just the unlucky guy who got caught.</li>
<li>If other people engaged in this behavior, it would be unacceptable, but I’m different because...</li>
<li>If I weren’t so rich/famous/powerful, nobody would care about this.</li>
<li>People want me to help them get ahead, so why shouldn’t I get something in return?</li>
<li>I’m a catch. Anybody who doesn’t want me is crazy.</li>
<a>forgive</a> and forget the allegations against him. On the surface, he seems to be thinking: If I deny this long enough and loudly enough, it will all blow over and things will get back to normal.

<h1> 4 Ways Married Couples Can Keep Having Great Sex </h1>
<h2> Marriage need not be the death of hot sex. </h2>

<li>Despite widespread stereotypes about "bed death," sex can and often does get better as a marriage progresses.</li>
<li>Feeling emotionally connected can greatly improve a couple's sex life.</li>
<li>Having fun together away from the bedroom will help partners have fun together in the bedroom. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Dean Drobot/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But this doesn’t have to happen. Bed death is not inevitable in marriage. In fact, many couples find that their sex lives get better as their marriage progresses. Here’s how:</p>
<h3>1. Take the pressure off.</h3>
<a>happiness</a> and marital satisfaction. So when it comes to sex, more is not always better. Rather than aiming for as much sex as possible, try to find a happy medium that works for you and your partner.
<h3>2. Focus on intimacy. </h3>
<a>intimacy</a> disorder of some sort.
<a>fear</a> of rejection—increases both
<h3>3. Have some nonsexual fun together.</h3>
<p>Do you remember when you were <a>dating</a>? What did you do that made your time together so much fun? Now it’s time to ask yourself: Why would we stop doing those things just because we’re married?</p>
<a>creativity</a> both in and out of the bedroom, and feeling deeply emotionally connected before, during, and after sex can easily top the fumbling, bumbling intensity of early sexploration with your partner.

<h1> Healthy Sexuality Cuts a Wide (Sometimes Confusing) Swath </h1>
<h2> What do you actually know about gender identity and sexual expression? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: melitas/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>attraction</a> to transgender women. He said he had been trying to repress and/or change this attraction for over a decade, to no avail, eventually giving in with
<a>pornography</a> and occasional in-person encounters. He told me that he’d looked for support at the local LGBT center, the local trans support center, on several online forums, and even from a therapist—all without meaningful success.
<a>sexual orientation</a>, and sexual expression.
<li>Cisgender: When your birth gender and gender identity match.</li>
<li>Transgender: When your birth gender and gender identity do not match.</li>
<a>hormones</a>, or genitals that do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies. It is estimated that 1.7 percent of the population are born intersex; many are “assigned” a gender through surgery at birth.
<a>genderfluid</a>, or undifferentiated. Often, it is assumed that feminine or androgynous men are gay and that tomboyish or androgynous women are lesbian. In actuality, gender expression and sexual orientation are unrelated.
<li>Heterosexual: Attracted to the opposite gender.</li>
<li>Homosexual: Attracted to the same gender.</li>
<li>Bisexual: Attracted to both males and females.</li>
<li>Gynandromorphophilic: Attracted to transgender women.</li>
<li>Skoliosexual: Attracted to non-binary individuals, including transgender men and women.</li>
<h3>Varieties of Sexual Expression</h3>
<li>Solo sex: <a>Masturbation</a> (generally our first and often our most consistent form of sex).</li>
<li>Partner sex: Typically begins with adolescent experimentation—although <a>sexual abuse</a>, porn, and similar technologies can disrupt that.</li>
<li>Group sex: Sex with multiple partners at the same time.</li>
<li>Chemsex: Pairing substance use with sexual behavior.</li>
<li><a>Kink</a>: A “non-conformist” sexual interest—whether something someone engages in often, or something they might use once in a while to spice up their sex life.</li>
<li>Paraphilia: Sexual desires taken to an extreme, resulting in negative consequences. Paraphilias are not considered psychologically problematic unless they cause distress or consequences for the individual.</li>
<li>Sexual offending: Clinically, sexual offending is defined as non-consensual sexual activity. The legal definition can look much different and will vary depending on the jurisdiction.</li>

<h1> 6 Ways to Have a Marriage That Lasts </h1>
<h2> 4. Become OK with occasional disagreements. </h2>
<li>One of the primary reasons to stay in a long-term relationship is that it’s fun.</li>
<li>No matter what, set aside some “us” time every day, simply to talk and connect.</li>
<li>A difference of opinion need not become a smoldering resentment that undermines your relationship.</li>

<h3>The characteristics of long-lasting relationships</h3>
<p>Over the years, I’ve noticed that successful, longer-lasting couples tend to share most (or all) of the following traits and behaviors.</p>
<h3>1. They enjoy each other’s company. </h3>
<h3>2. They talk to each other. </h3>
<p>No matter what, set aside some “us” time every day, simply to talk and connect. Make it non-negotiable. Your relationship will thank you.</p>
<h3>3. They trust each other.</h3>
<p>Trust is a key element in a healthy relationship. If two people trust each other, if they know they have each other’s backs no matter what, that’s a solid relationship foundation.</p>
<a>fear</a> of reprisal. One way to enhance relationship trust is to always be vulnerable for at least a moment or two during your daily “us” time.
<h3>4. They’re OK with an occasional disagreement.</h3>
<p>So it’s OK if you and your partner are not always on the same page—as long as you can amicably disagree at least most of the time. A difference of opinion need not become a smoldering resentment that undermines your relationship.</p>
<h3>5. They respect one another.</h3>
<h3>6. They have realistic expectations.</h3>

<h1> 7 Things Every Couple Should Understand About Infidelity </h1>
<h2> Women do it nearly as often as men, and it doesn't have to kill a relationship. </h2>
<div> <h3>Key points</h3> <ul> <li>Infidelity does not automatically doom a relationship.</li> <li>Cheaters can change their behavior—if they truly want to.</li> <li>Infidelity damages relationships even before it is discovered.</li> </ul> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Motortion Films/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>If I asked 100 people what they know about infidelity, I would likely get 100 very different answers, though each of those answers would likely fall into one of seven categories.</p>
<li>Infidelity is a sure sign of a struggling relationship.</li>
<li>If infidelity can be kept secret, it doesn’t hurt the cheater’s relationship or family.</li>
<li>Men cheat more often than women.</li>
<li>Rich and powerful men cheat more often than other men.</li>
<li>Cheaters are consciously aware that they are risking their primary relationship.</li>
<li>Cheaters cheat. If they cheat once, they’ll almost certainly cheat again.</li>
<li>A couple can never truly get over infidelity.</li>
<h3>Does infidelity signify a relationship that is already struggling?</h3>
<a>trauma</a> and is more about soothing feelings of
<a>shame</a> and unworthiness than anything else. That said, if a relationship was solid prior to cheating, it’s likely to become much less solid when the betrayal starts.
<h3>If no one knows about it, then no one gets hurt by it, right?</h3>
<p>Wrong. 100 percent wrong. The foundation of a healthy, long-term relationship is trust. As soon as one partner starts <a>lying</a> or keeping important secrets, honesty becomes a one-way street, and trust is compromised.</p>
<h3>Is it mostly men who cheat?</h3>
<a>pornography</a>, but even that has evened out in recent years.
<h3>Are rich and powerful men more likely to cheat than regular guys?</h3>
<h3>Are cheaters always aware that they are risking their primary relationship?</h3>
<a>fantasy</a>-driven neurochemical bubble of arousal (a mix of
<a>dopamine</a>, adrenaline, and a few other pleasure and excitement-related neurochemicals). In this bubble, they lose track of the real world and only the fantasy matters.
<h3>If a person cheats once, will they cheat again?</h3>
<p>Probably. Unless they take drastic action to change their thinking and behavior. Over the years, I have treated literally thousands of cheaters, and I can tell you that the ones who want to stop cheating and save their relationship usually do.</p>
<a>denial</a> about what they’ve done and the pain they’ve caused. Often, they want to blame their partner for their behavior. Plus, they’ve developed a habit of lying and keeping secrets to cover their actions.
<h3>Does infidelity automatically doom a relationship?</h3>
<a>intimacy</a>. So not only is healing possible, better than ever is possible too.

<h1> How to Avoid In-Law Conflicts </h1>
<h2> When you marry, you also get their family, for better or worse. </h2>

<li>There are four primary areas in which in-laws may create strife: holidays, kids, enmeshment, and genuine discord. </li>

<h1> Life in the Digital Universe: How Do You Define Infidelity? </h1>
<h2> Have you and your partner set boundaries around online behavior? </h2>
<li>Digital cheating can be every bit as painful as real-world cheating.</li>
<li>With relationship betrayal, the loss of relationship trust is ultimately more hurtful than the actual infidelity.</li>
<li>However, infidelity is not necessarily the end of a relationship. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Prostock-studio/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Is looking at <a>porn</a> a form of cheating?</li>
<li>Does it matter if you do or don’t <a>masturbate</a> while looking at porn?</li>
<li>Does sexting with someone other than your partner count as cheating?</li>
<li>Is webcamming a form of cheating?</li>
<li>Does it matter if you do or don’t masturbate while webcamming?</li>
<li>Does it matter if the person you’re webcamming with lives half a world away, and you’ll never meet them in person?</li>
<li>Is chatting with an ex-partner on social media a form of cheating?</li>
<li>Is it OK to have a profile on a hookup app, even if you don’t plan to use it for in-person hookups?</li>
<p>In addition to this list of questions about specific behaviors—which could continue ad nauseam—there is also the question of whether digital cheating is as bad (as devastating to the betrayed partner) as real-world cheating.</p>
<a>sexual</a> or romantic act that causes betrayed partners the most pain; it’s the
<a>lying</a> and secrets that surround the betrayal.
<ul><li>Digital cheating is every bit as painful as real-world cheating.</li> <li>With relationship betrayal, the loss of relationship trust is ultimately more hurtful than the actual infidelity.</li> </ul>
<p>The results of this study led me, when writing my book <a>Out of the Doghouse</a>, to create the following definition of infidelity.</p>

<h1> Why Does Your Cheating Partner Continue to Lie? </h1>
<h2> After betrayal is discovered, continued secrets and lies are agony. </h2>
<li>Sometimes cheaters on the verge of getting caught dig in with more secrets and lies, but try to do it more effectively. </li>
<li>Cheaters often resort to tactics like denial and gaslighting that further harm the relationship.</li>
<li>To rebuild trust, the secrets and lies must stop.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pathdoc/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>For that to happen, however, the secrets and lies must stop. For cheaters, that process starts when they stop <a>lying</a> to themselves.</p>
<a>denial</a>, they lie to themselves about what they are doing and the impact their behavior is currently having and might have in the future. They do this as a way to
<a>rationalize</a> and justify their obviously hurtful behavior in their own mind. And then, over time, they come to believe their own lies. With that, the internal lies and deceits are externalized with lines like:
<li>If I had more/different/better <a>sex</a> at home, I wouldn’t need to cheat.</li>
<li>All I’m doing is looking at a little bit of <a>porn</a>. Everyone does it, and nobody thinks it’s cheating.</li>
<li>Sure, I go to strip clubs, but I never have sex with the workers.</li>
<li>My entire world is take, take, take. Nobody appreciates me. So I deserve to have a little fun.</li>
<li>What my partner doesn’t know can’t hurt him/her.</li>
<a>Gaslighting</a> is denial taken to such an extreme that it qualifies as a form of
<li>She’s just a coworker. When she calls here, it’s because we have a project to finish.</li>
<li>Why are you always so <a>jealous</a>?</li>
<li>Why do you keep asking me if something is going on? You’re completely paranoid. It’s really annoying.</li>
<li>I would never do that. I don’t even look at other women.</li>
<li>You’re just being crazy, and it really upsets me that you don’t trust me.</li>
<p>Over time, gaslighting causes betrayed partners to question their own reality. They start to wonder if maybe their perception of the situation really is askew, despite the ever-growing pile of evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>If you have experienced betrayal in your relationship, especially betrayal that is continued with ongoing secrets, lies, manipulation, and gaslighting, help is available.</p>

<h1> The Comedy and Philosophy of the Film "Don’t Look Up" </h1>
<h2> It’s not funny. It’s not even satire. But this movie is a must-watch. </h2>
<p> Posted December 30, 2021 </p>
<li> "Don't Look Up" is not good satire, but it really wasn't intended to be. </li>
<li>What the film depicts is too close to reality to be funny. </li>
<li>This is a must-watch because everyone should come to grips with the dark side of humanity it exposes and laments. </li>
<p>Why would I say it’s a must-watch? (Spoilers ahead.) </p>
<a>memes</a> designed to make fun of her.
<a>we have already done this with climate change</a> and
<p>Even Don’t Look Up's small lines that should be funny are too close to reality for comfort.</p>
<li>The fact that President Orlean smokes makes her more popular, not less, because it means she “keeps it real.” Jason, the president’s son, openly admits that he would sleep with her and wants to see her in Playboy.</li>
<li>Isherwell’s tech company has so much data on people, it can predict not only their purchasing habits but their manner of death.</li>
<li>Minutes away from the destruction of the planet, the Patriot News Network is reporting on the “only one story everyone’s talking about… topless urgent care centers.”</li>

<h1> How Many More Will Die Before We Stop Politicizing Masks? </h1>
<h2> New research explores the politics of mask-wearing and attitudes in Canada. </h2>
<li>Public health responses to COVID-19 have varied from jurisdiction to jurisdiction throughout the pandemic. </li>
<li>Mask-wearing and mask mandates became an unexpectedly politically charged controversy in North America. </li>
<li>The fifth wave (Omicron) may result in new mask recommendations, e.g., guidance on using N95s vs cloth masks, potentially reigniting controversy.</li>
<li>Research on Canadian mask-wearing attitudes during the first wave underscores the need for politically cohesive public health messaging.</li>
