<h1> A Bigger Brain is Not Necessarily Better </h1>
<h2> Brain size has a surprisingly small impact on intelligence and behavior. </h2>
<li>Having an unusually large brain doesn't necessarily make someone a genius, and large-scale research suggests only a slight and tenuous relationship between brain size and intelligence.</li>
<li>Across vertebrate species, it's possible that it's the size of the brain relative to the body—rather than the brain's absolute size—that confers the greatest level of intelligence.</li>
<li>But neuroscientists still aren't sure what humans' extra brain mass accomplishes—especially considering that much of our brains are inactive for much of the time. </li>
<p>People assume that having a big brain means that you’re especially intelligent. And if you are smart, you must have a big brain. But there is little evidence for either notion.</p>

<h3>Does a Big Brain Make You Smart?</h3>
<p>Being “smart” doesn’t mean you have an especially big brain. The inverse is also not true: having a big brain doesn’t necessarily make you smart.</p>
<a>Edward Rulloff,</a> an upstate New Yorker of the 19th century, who by some accounts had the biggest brain on record. His preserved brain is today on public view in the

<a>Voracek and colleagues</a> found that, although there is evidence for a relationship between overall brain volume and various intelligence measures, the strength of the relationship is very weak.
<a>riled the psychological sciences</a> in recent years, make me doubt that any meaningful relationship exists between brain size and intelligence. Moreover, the original
<a>motivation</a> for this whole line of investigation into brain size and intelligence has hideously racist roots (for a historical deep dive of this area, see
<a>emotional granularity</a>, and lots of other traits should be related to brain size, either big or small. The point is not that these other traits are more likely to be related to brain size; the point is that brain size tells us little, if anything.

<a>no systematic enlargement</a> in brain areas related to memory such as the hippocampus. In fact, in some cases, these individuals have smaller brain volumes in relevant areas.

<p>I know I haven’t earned my Ph.D. yet, professor, but I beg to differ. You see, we all access 100 percent of our brains—every day. And we don’t have to be telekinetic or memorize an entire deck of cards to do it.</p>

<a>There are even products</a> that promise on the market promising to unlock that other 90 percent.
<a>two-thirds of the public and half of science teachers</a> still believe the myth to be true. When University College London
<a>neuroscientist</a> Sophie Scott attended a first aid course,
<a>her instructor assured the class that head injuries weren’t dangerous</a> because “90 percent of the brain [doesn’t] do anything.”
<p>How did this misconception come about?</p>
<a>20 percent of our daily energy intake</a>. Our brains are also remarkably efficient, having evolved gyri which have dramatically increased our cortical surface-area-to-total volume ratio
<a>relative to other species</a>. If we only used 10 percent of our brains, that would mean that we’re all effectively evolving in the opposite direction—and very quickly.

<p>Acute trauma reflects intense distress in the immediate aftermath of a one-time event and the reaction is of short duration. Common examples include a car crash, physical or sexual assault, or the sudden death of a loved one.</p>
<p>Chronic trauma can arise from harmful events that are repeated or prolonged. It can develop in response to persistent bullying, neglect, abuse (emotional, physical, or sexual), and domestic violence.</p>

<h2> Treatment for Trauma </h2>
<p>Left unaddressed or untreated, trauma can undermine relationships and wreak havoc on personal and professional lives. There are multiple avenues of treatment available for people experiencing from short- or long-term trauma symptoms. </p>
<p>Lifestyle changes are an early treatment option to consider. Eating healthy, exercising, avoiding alcohol and drugs, getting enough sleep, seeing loved ones regularly, and emphasizing self-care can help relieve trauma symptoms.</p>
<p>Psychotherapy can help a person build resilience, develop coping skills, and address unresolved feelings that are keeping them stuck. Exposure therapy and cognitive reappraisal therapy are two of the more reliable treatments for trauma and PTSD. </p>
<p>Ketamine (special K) may also be used to expedite recovery. It is injected under a therapist’s supervision prior to a talk therapy session. Research has shown it to be effective. </p>

<p>The researchers placed the neurograins, each about the size of a grain of salt, on the cortex of a rodent to record epicortical signal. The neurograin microchips are optimized for low-power operation— each chip uses less than 30 microwatts.</p>
<p>“In addition to their unique capability for wireless networking, the miniaturized chips achieve recording and stimulation capability comparable to other microimplants,” wrote the researchers.</p>

<a>neuroscience</a> by providing high-precision neuronal insights.
<p>“Utilizing recent advances in machine learning, we introduce a systematic approach to characterize neurons’ input/output (I/O) mapping complexity,” wrote the researchers.</p>
<p>The deep neural network filters gave the researchers a new understanding of the dendritic processing that shapes the input and output neuronal properties.</p>
<p>With this new proof-of-concept, scientists now have a unified model to understand the computational complexity of any type of neuron—an innovative method that may accelerate breakthroughs in both AI and neuroscience in the future.</p>
