<li>If your goal is to drink less or not at all at a holiday party, having a script, enlisting an ally, and a plan for when to leave can help.</li>
<li>Another strategy is to attend a gathering prepared with a special round of non-alcoholic drinks you’ll be excited about.</li>
<p>However, there’s a whole additional category of people whose goal is not to abstain altogether but to cut down on drinking. Perhaps you just want to avoid a hangover or still cringe at some of the things you said at your last office party.</p>
<p>Whatever your reasons, if your goal is to drink less, or not at all, at a gathering this holiday season, here are some things to keep in mind that will help you make it happen.</p>
<h3>Be festive in your substitutions.</h3>
<h3>Keep your hands occupied.</h3>
<p>Give yourself something to do that doesn’t increase your temptation. Perhaps you get a nonalcoholic drink that you need to keep stirring or a coffee or hot chocolate so hot that it needs to be blown on every few minutes.</p>
<h3>Notice your patterns. </h3>
<a>Lonely</a>? Are there certain types of interactions that make you want to drink more? The more you know, the better you can plan.
<a>mindfulness</a> technique that involves acknowledging your cravings and letting yourself feel them, trusting that they will pass–rather than being so frightened of them that they become your mental enemy.
<a>social anxiety</a>, nervousness,
<h3>Stick to your departure time. </h3>

<h1> The Bounce Back: Focusing More on Recovery, Not Relapse </h1>
<h2> Each person with a substance use disorder has a different road to recovery. </h2>
<li>In substance abuse treatment, therapists and clients should not be disheartened by "relapse" or recurrence, which can happen in recovery.</li>
<li>Therapists should be flexible with clients who experience a recurrence rather than immediately referring them to a higher level of care.</li>
<li>Solutions for those who experience recurrence may include partnering with a recovery coach or gradually building up to larger sobriety goals.</li>

<h3>The Bottom Line: Flexibility in Treatment Is Key</h3>
<p>Imagine each time we made a mistake and the people we believed were supportive gave up on us and made us feel like failures. What would motivate us to get back on the horse and “bounce back?"</p>
<p>Finding supportive, creative solutions with my clients throughout their ups and downs kept them engaged in treatment and helped them learn the benefit of living a sober lifestyle independently.</p>
<p>By meeting clients where they are, counselors and therapists can motivate individuals to remain in treatment and achieve the successful lives in recovery that they aspire to have.</p>

<h1> The Problem With the Idea of Tech Addiction </h1>
<h2> Don't believe the idea that technology hijacks your brain. </h2>
<p>A Personal Perspective: Telling ourselves that devices and platforms “hijack” our brains plays right into Big Tech’s hands.</p>
<p>What addiction is and isn’t.</p>
<a>neuroscientist</a> Marc Lewis, an addiction researcher and former addict, “is the brain focusing on just one thing, all else be damned.”
<p>Addiction is a <a>pathology</a>. It is not simply liking something a lot.</p>
<a>sex</a>, but that doesn’t make us all alcoholics and sex addicts. Addiction is a matter of who is using, how much they are using, and the harm done as a result. It’s never simply about the substance or behavior being used or abused.
<p>It’s all in the brain.</p>
<a>dopamine</a>” and activate the same brain regions cocaine does? These decontextualized, click-baity ideas are repeated by people who haven’t comprehended the research.
<p>Every repeated action, from learning to play the piano to studying a new language, rewires the brain and dopamine reinforces all forms of learning—neither of which are unique to online technology or necessarily sinister.</p>
<a>obsessive-compulsive</a> disorder, may be at greater risk, the overwhelming majority of people will never become addicted to their phones. Furthermore, telling ourselves we are addicted promotes passivity instead of empowerment.
<a>“</a>cannabis use disorder
<a>“</a>use and abuse policy,
<a>”</a> companies could reach out to the people who spend an inordinate amount of time on their sites with a simple message: “Can we help?”
<p>For most, it’s not about being addicted to technology, but getting the best out of it.</p>

<h2> What is the best treatment for ADHD? </h2>
<a>behavioral and social challenges</a> (such as difficulties making friends, managing time, and poor self-esteem).
<p>The most commonly used ADHD medications are stimulants such as Ritalin and Adderall. Non-stimulants like Strattera or certain classes of antidepressants can be used for those who don’t respond to stimulants or cannot tolerate them.</p>
<div> <h3> What stimulants are used to treat ADHD? </h3> </div>
<p>The main stimulant medications used to treat ADHD fall into two broad categories: methylphenidates and amphetamines.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate: Ritalin, Concerta, Daytrana, Focalin, Quillichew, Quillivant, Metadate</p>
<p>Amphetamine: Adderall, Dyanavel, Vyvanse, Dexedrine</p>
<div> <h3> Are stimulant medications dangerous? </h3> </div>

<p><a>Three non-stimulant medications</a>—Strattera (atomoxetine), Intuniv (guanfacine), and Kapvay (clonidine)—are FDA-approved to treat ADHD. Wellbutrin (bupropion) and other antidepressants are often used off-label to treat ADHD.</p>
<div> <h3> Do non-stimulant medications work as well as stimulants? </h3> </div>
<a>The only way to know if a medication will work for you (or not) is to try it</a>; many with ADHD report trying multiple stimulants and/or non-stimulants before finding a medication that effectively manages their symptoms.
<h2> Behavioral Treatments </h2>
<div> <h3> Can therapy help with ADHD? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is it possible to treat ADHD without medication? </h3> </div>
<a>video games</a>, brain training programs, or neurofeedback—may improve ADHD symptoms; most experts, however, argue that more research is needed.
