<p>PT: When I was 20 I knew so many things. I knew that life was exciting and romantic and a great adventure. What should my career thoughts have been?</p>
<p>PT: What else should you know besides your ability to withstand pressure?</p>
<p>PT: What is the hardest thing to know?</p>
<p>PT: Is it like being right- or left-handed?</p>
<p>Drucker. That's right. The only ambidextrous people are trial lawyers-they both read and listen. Nobody else can. I am a listener; I can read after I listen but not before. Probably I can't even write first, but that's pathological.</p>
<p>PT: How many of us know from the very beginning what we want to be?</p>
<p>PT: Now, what about going to graduate school? Suppose one has learned all he can about himself. Should he go on to graduate school before he tries his first job?</p>
<p>PT: <a>Politics</a> in the groves of academia fascinate and appall me. The infighting is worse than in the old Kansas City or Boston wards. And the academicians are far more shrewd and vicious.</p>
<p>PT: Would you then, say, go into the Peace Corps first, before considering graduate school?</p>
<p>Drucker: No! The Peace Corps is a great disappointment.</p>
<p>PT: How can you say that? Why?</p>
<p>PT: I see what you want. You think that any good young person should go out and jump in somewhere, anywhere.</p>
<p>PT: All right. I believe you. You'd put off graduate school?</p>
<p>Drucker: I'd put off elementary school if I had my way. I am not a great believer in school. School is primarily an institution for the perpetuation of <a>adolescence</a>.</p>
<p>PT: If you don't believe in school, how would you educate?</p>
<p>Drucker: That is an entirely different question. The thought that school educates is not one I have accepted yet. No, I am not joking.</p>
<p>PT: I know you are not joking.</p>
<p>PT: Did you go from the university into management consultant work, or was it the other way around?</p>
<p>Drucker: I have always taught on the side, because I like to teach. I started teaching at 20 when I was in law school out of sheer <a>boredom</a>. It was the only way to stay alive.</p>
<p>PT: That sounds like something out of Charles Dickens. How did you get there?</p>
<p>PT: Why couldn't she stand Freud?</p>
<p>Drucker: She felt that he was an evil man. She was a perceptive person. My father saw this man as a genius, and felt that geniuses should be allowed anything.</p>
<p>PT: Why did your mother feel that Freud was an evil man?</p>
<p>Drucker: Because he was, period. He was a man who had to domineer.</p>
<p>PT: Let's get back to your own life. Where did you go from your apprenticeship in the export business?</p>
<p>Drucker: I went to Germany. I went into investment banking. In 1929, as you may have heard, there was a slight unpleasantness. Investment banking came to an end, and I became a newspaperman. But all the time, I was enrolled as a law student.</p>
<p>PT: I didn't know you were a journalist.</p>
<p>PT: You did quite a few things as a young man.</p>
<p>PT: But you were very successful in that interim period.</p>
<p>PT: You came to the United States before the Second World War?</p>
<p>Drucker: Yes. In April, 1937. Here I also taught on the side. I taught <a>philosophy</a> at Bennington college in Vermont, then I came here to New York University. I am not a proper model for anything.</p>
<p>PT: When did you switch entirely to management consulting?</p>
<p>Drucker: I haven't. I am tired of management books.</p>
<p>PT: You keep running into complaints about technology. Clark Kerr has said that we can't really make our peace with technology. How can the individual survive and function in this technology?</p>
<p>Drucker: Technology should be made to serve the individual. It can, too.</p>
<p>PT: How? Isn't there war between the individual and technology?</p>
<p>Drucker: There is no war; there is <a>fear</a>. It doesn't ever pay to be permissive and pleasant about mechanical gadgets. Be nasty. Throw it out if it doesn't perform.</p>
<p>PT: I wonder if people were afraid of the light switch once.</p>
<p>PT: And careers are a tool, too.</p>
<p>Drucker: Precisely. The smart way to look at a career is, What does it do for me? What do I want to accomplish?</p>
<p>PT: Are there any special things to look for in a company?</p>
<p>Drucker: Yes. You want old age at top management. You know, one question the young career seeker never asks the company recruiter is, "How old are the department heads?"</p>
<p>PT: You want old ones so you can come up, right?</p>
<p>Drucker: Oh, my, yes. You don't want the First National City Bank in the city, for instance.</p>
<p>Drucker: Oh, yes; the executive vice president is 36. Too many companies actually are lopsided. You want a company with some old and some young at the head.</p>
<p>PT: People are younger longer now. How has this changed the job picture?</p>
<p>PT: What possible solution is there other than a continual increasing of life long education programs?</p>
<p>PT: I should think they'd be scared to death.</p>
<p>PT: It would be like starting life all over again.</p>
<p>Drucker: Six months after these men have taken on their new jobs, they are 20 years younger. They have recovered enthusiasm, they are growing, they have ideas. Their wives are enchanted. They are exciting again.</p>
<p>PT: Not everybody would be a success as an office manager. Are there any other jobs that are especially suited to second careers?</p>
<p>Drucker: Indeed there are. The older professions are best suited to become second careers. Middle age is really the best time to switch to being the lawyer, the teacher, the priest, the doctor-I shocked you-and the social worker.</p>
<p>PT: However would you train a man to be a doctor as a second career?</p>
<p>PT: What has been the reaction of the medical schools to this idea?</p>
<p>And I talked to the archdioceses about putting these men in the parishes as priests in six months. "Can't be done;' I was told. Most training for these old professions consists of trying to simulate experience. Hell, these people have experience.</p>
<p>PT: Is it being done anywhere?</p>
<p>Drucker: We are putting men into the classroom to teach at the University in six months.</p>
<p>Drucker: How? By putting them into the classroom, period. Eight out of ten will swim. And, once they swim I can work on polishing their style. If they sink, I jump in with a life preserver. What I can't do is to teach them how to swim.</p>
<p>PT: And if they sink, you pull them out so they can do something else?</p>
<p>Drucker: No, I dry them off and throw them in again.</p>
<p>PT: What's it like, being a management consultant?</p>
<a>psychiatry</a>. The great weakness of an organization is that you can't have a confidante. You are always either boss or subordinate. And people are terribly
<a>lonely</a>, terribly lonely. Here comes an outsider, the licensed lunatic, and you just start spilling. What clients tell you is incredible. I know much too much about them. Every management consultant has the same experience.
<p>PT: Doesn't this knowledge help you as a consultant?</p>
<p>PT: It doesn't help at all?</p>
<p>Drucker: Oh, sometimes. But more often, one has to suppress it. I have never liked to be cruel, and as I get older, I hate cruelty more and more. But one has to force oneself to do what is right. Sometimes that means <a>cutting</a> off heads.</p>
<p>PT: What happens with the thousands and thousands of people who are stuck, working out their years till <a>retirement</a>?</p>
<p>Drucker: I think company managers will have to learn to sit down and say: "Look, Jack, do you want to stay here or do you really want to do something? If you stay here, you are about as far as you will ever get. Oh, maybe two more raises."</p>
<p>PT: It makes all the sense in the world.</p>

<h1> Dangers of Meditation </h1>
<h2> Meditation is great for our well being—but does it carry any dangers? </h2>
<p>A few years ago, after I discussed the benefits of meditation in one of my workshops, a student said to me: “Well, what you’re actually saying here is that meditation is great, and it does not have any dangers or side effects.”</p>

<a> research</a>, as well as our personal experience, has shown how valuable meditation is: It reduces our

<p>1. Arrive to class early. Rushing in, breathing heavily, feeling <a>stressed</a> for being late, are not a conducive beginning to class. Arriving early would also enable you to easily apply the following point.</p>
<p>3. Avoiding a heavy meal at least two hours before class is important. If you have just eaten, your body is digesting the food, making you tired and unable to fully concentrate on your breath and the movement of the body.</p>
<p>6. When the class has ended, don’t jump back immediately into the "doing." Allow yourself a transition time where you don’t check your phone right away and simply enjoy the juicy bliss of yoga.</p>

<a>self-worth</a>” deeply buried idea about myself is just an example, there are numerous potential judgments, ideas, perceptions, assumptions, and feelings that I could be carrying in my own personal shadow.

<p>Short Video On the Beauty of Self-Awareness</p>
<p>This is a short excerpt from the film “<a>Essays from the Heart: Emergence from Within</a>,” by <a>Anjula Ram</a>, in which I talk about the importance of seeing ourselves fully, as we are, without any masks:</p>

<a>high self-esteem</a>. Research also shows how self-awareness leads to
<a> increased self-care and decreased burn-out</a>. Finally, research indicates that increased self-awareness leads to
<a>greater acceptance of oneself and others</a>. I could go on, listing many studies showing the benefits of self-awareness, but the point is clear: scientific research shows that self-awareness is an essential component in our psychological wellbeing.

<p>Connect with Nature – Many people experience a reduced cognitive “noise” while spending time in nature. This peaceful state of mind is an excellent space to meet yourself.</p>
<p>Learn New Skills – When you learn a new skill, you learn about your personal boundaries, your comfort zone, and find ways to move beyond it. As part of this process, you learn about yourself and ways to expand that self.</p>

<h1> The Intimate Art of Listening </h1>
<h2> Here are some tips to open your ears and heart. </h2>

<p>If someone asked you if you care about your partner and friends, you'd probably say “of course.” But if we dig deeper, what does it really mean to care about someone?</p>
<a>philosophy</a>, expressed it in his classic book,
<p>Extending Our <a>Attention</a> and Interest </p>
<p>Stay Connected to Our Body</p>
<a>good enough mothering</a>,” “good enough listening" conveys the overriding sense that we care.
<p>People can often sense when we extend heartfelt listening. Feeling accepted, not judged, they may feel safer being vulnerable and sharing what’s in their hearts. <a>Fear</a> subsides when people feel cared about.</p>
<p>Monitor Your Defensiveness and Reactivity</p>
<a>shame</a> for breaking an agreement or not being very attentive.
<p>Our non-defensive listening helps our partner feel respected, seen, and heard. This is a powerful key toward repairing broken trust and rebuilding the connection.</p>
<a>Authentic Heart: An Eightfold Path to Midlife Love</a>. It means being interested in a person’s well-being and
<a>happiness</a> and wanting to support that. Just as plants need ample water and sunshine to grow, we humans need the nutrient of generous listening in order to thrive.

<h1> Being a Warrior of the Heart </h1>
<h2> The courage to build healthy relationships. </h2>
<p> Posted January 2, 2021 </p>

<p>Many things take courage: a desired career change, leaving an abusive relationship, or overcoming adversity. But there’s another aspect to courage often overlooked, which is needed in our close relationships.</p>
<a>The Courage To Be</a>. Accepting ourselves as we are, even if others judge us for what we feel or think, is the ultimate act of self-affirmation, self-acceptance, and self-love. Tillich's writing on the importance of affirming ourselves influenced
<a> Rollo May,</a> who was one of the creators of Humanistic and Existential Psychology.
<p>Revealing Our Inner World</p>
<p>It can be scary to let ourselves be seen and known. That’s why it takes courage. Taking intelligent risks allows the possibility of a deeper love and <a>intimacy</a> to unfold.</p>
<p>Building Emotional Safety</p>
<a>shame</a> for making mistakes, we need the courage to pick ourselves up again and again and keep moving forward.
<p>“Mistakes” are nothing more than the ways we acted based upon our limited <a>wisdom</a> and experience at the time. It takes courage to learn from what we call our "mistakes" and move toward the deeper love and connection we want.</p>

<p>We enter a partnership with the best of intentions. But sadly, relationships often fail to fulfill their tender promise. How can we put a proper foundation under our fondest hopes and <a>dreams</a>?</p>
<p>Couples in my <a>therapy</a> office are often quick to itemize each other’s flaws, convinced that if they could persuade their partner to see the light, the relationship would improve.</p>
<p>It’s natural to want to understand why a relationship isn’t going well. Unfortunately, our attempts to understand what’s wrong often focus on our partner rather than explore how we might be contributing to the impasse.</p>
<p>Here are three things we can practice to improve our relationships.</p>
<h3>Uncovering Our Felt Experience</h3>
<p>It’s easier to pinpoint another’s flaws than to recognize our own. Bringing <a>mindfulness</a> to our own feelings and inner process requires that we draw upon another quality: courage.</p>
<h3>The Courage to Look Inside</h3>
<a>attachment</a> with caregivers, which is necessary for developing an inner sense of security.
<h3>Communicating Our Inner World</h3>

<a>lonely</a> and sad. I want to feel more connected with you. I love spending time together and I need more of that.”
<p>Marshall Rosenberg’s <a>Non-Violent Communication</a> (NVC) offers one helpful approach to hear each other’s inner life. As we convey our inner world of feelings and needs, we’re more likely to touch our partner’s heart.</p>
<p>Pausing to notice what we feel and want and patiently communicating our felt experience can help cultivate the deeper connections we want.</p>

<h1> Is Unconditional Love Really Possible? </h1>
<h2> Are you setting yourself up for disappointment in love? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Relationships Matter </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>

<p>The ideal of unconditional love is a noble one. We want to be loved as we are, and perhaps we’d like to see ourselves as capable of selfless love.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, loving unconditionally may set us up for disappointment and <a>shame</a> when our ideal doesn’t match the reality of how difficult — or perhaps impossible — it is to love unconditionally.</p>
<a>attachment</a>. As adults, we also desire and need safe relationships. Opening our hearts, we want to trust that a beloved partner or loyal friend will be there when we need them.
<a>narcissistic</a> child: Love me and supply what I need ... despite how I treat you.
<a>spirituality</a> evolved if we fall short of that ideal.
<p>If our partner wants us to visit our difficult in-laws, we can decline with <a>empathy</a> and kindness. We can vulnerably express our fears and concerns, which allows our partner to understand and respond to our needs and wants.</p>
<p>A key to the elusive <a>intimacy</a> we seek is letting ourselves be seen while seeing another’s inner life. The process of sharing and being responsive to our respective inner worlds is usually more important than the outcome.</p>
<a>dancing with fire</a> (which is why I titled my book as such). There’s the fire of another’s burning needs and that fire of our own desires. Working with how our desires interact is a central part of the art of loving.
<p>Love cannot thrive without courageous self-awareness and rigorous self-honesty. Is our “no” payback for perceived injuries? Are we perpetuating a power struggle? Have we stored up hurts and resentments that leak out?</p>
<p>Healthy relationships require knowing our feelings, our limits, and our motivations. Is it really too painful to visit our in-laws? Or do we want our partner to feel the pain we’re carrying from some past event?</p>
<p>The greatest gift we can give another person is the gift of our own personal growth. The more we know ourselves and develop the courage and skills to communicate our inner experience, the more that trust and love can flourish.</p>
<a>suicidal</a>). But if we define unconditional love as follows, I’m all in, although I prefer the less grandiose term “mature love,” as defined in
<li>We’re committed to the process of open, honest, nonviolent communication.</li>
<li>We’re committed to offering a sacred, spacious, non-defensive presence — listening as best we can, and taking our beloved's feelings and wants seriously, while also expressing our own.</li>
<li>We’re moved by love and caring, not duty or obligation.</li>
<li>Love overrides little annoyances that occur in every relationship. We accept differences and work with them skillfully.</li>
<li>We share power. We don’t always get exactly what we want.</li>

<h1> What Cats Can Teach Us About Love </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective: Loving and losing a cherished companion. </h2>

<p>The Art of Receiving and Letting Go</p>
<a>article</a>, cats (dogs too!) have a capacity to receive, which softens our heart and delights our soul. If we were fortunate to have a cat who is especially affectionate and not too traumatized as a kitten, we may sense a trust and
<a>openness</a> that invites us toward them, allowing our defenses to melt and our heart to open. Even as we may sometimes ignore their bids for
<a>attention</a>, delay feeding them, or display occasional annoyance, our friendly feline has the

<a>immune system boost.</a> We may feel that what we’re offering is being received with openness and perhaps something that resembles
<a>gratitude</a>. We feel that we make a difference in our cat’s well-being. There’s a connection that grows and deepens.

<div> <h2>Are You Wondering How to Create Deeper Relationships?</h2> <p>We want to love and be loved, but oftentimes we lack the awareness and skills to do so. Here are some tips for connecting with ourselves and others so that love may deepen.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>What Cats Can Teach Us About Love</a></h2> <p>A Personal Perspective: Cats can teach us how to love and be loved. Their capacity to be in the present moment and receive affection can delight our heart and feed our soul.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Our Issues Live in Our Tissues</a></h2> <p>Exploring the research-based focusing approach of Dr. Eugene Gendlin. Accessing the intelligence of our body can accelerate our growth. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Perils of Toxic Positivity</a></h2> <p>There's nothing wrong with having a positive attitude. But when others are hurting, they need us to honor their feelings, not just push positivity.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Getting Wiser in Our Later Years</a></h2> <p>Aging is not just about getting older. It can also be about getting wiser and living a more fulfilling life. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Do You Live in Your Body or Are You Mostly in Your Head?</a></h2> <p>Clear thinking is important, but are we neglecting a deeper aspect of our being? This article explores the importance to staying connected to our body and being.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Stop Judging Yourself for Being Single!</a></h2> <p>Do you feel judged by others for being single or tend to judge yourself? You can have a satisfying, connected life whether you're single or partnered.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Is It Possible to Have Too Much Self-Confidence?</a></h2>
<p>We're taught to be confident, but might our self-confidence be covering up a deeper insecurity? Perhaps what takes strength is a willingness to embrace humility and not-knowing.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Is Unrecognized Shame Keeping You Stuck?</a></h2> <p>Of all our human emotions, shame is the most hidden, most stubborn, and most unrecognized. By identifying it, we can free ourselves to enjoy life more fully.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>3 Practices to Deepen Love and Connection </a></h2>
<p>We often communicate our perceptions and interpretations of the other person rather than uncover what we're really feeling inside. Changing this pattern takes awareness, courage, and good communication.</p>
