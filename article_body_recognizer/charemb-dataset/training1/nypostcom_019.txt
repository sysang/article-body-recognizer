<p>Giuffre, now 38, sued Andrew in August, claiming that Epstein and his recently convicted madam, Ghislaine Maxwell, <a>made her have sex with the royal three times</a>, starting in 2001 when she was just 17.</p>
<p>Giuffre alleged that Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell “compelled her to engage in sexual acts by express or implied threat” — and she “feared death or physical injury” if she disobeyed.</p>
<p>If true, such actions “would have been reprehensible,” Kaplan wrote.</p>
<p>The alleged abuse happened in Maxwell’s London home as well as Epstein’s private island and his New York mansion, the latter accusation justifying the Manhattan complaint, Kaplan said.</p>
<p>However, she never accused the prince of abusing her in Florida, where the abuse central to her recently unsealed deal with Epstein took place.</p>
<p>There “is no suggestion in the Florida Case that [Andrew] was himself engaged in sex trafficking,” Kaplan noted.</p>
<p>The wording of the then-secret deal had even specifically forbidden Epstein from passing it to third parties to be able to use, the ruling noted.</p>
<p>Kaplan also surmised that Epstein’s was purely out “to protect himself” from future lawsuits with the $500,000 payout, which helped him skate further criminal prosecution.</p>
<p>Epstein likely wanted only to “gain as much protection for himself … and to do so for an acceptable price.”</p>
<p>Whatever the pedophile’s intentions were, his agreement was “far from a model of clear and precise drafting,” leaving Giuffre and Andrew to “disagree emphatically as to what it meant.”</p>
<p>“The parties have articulated at least two reasonable interpretations of the critical language,” Kaplan wrote of the deal “riddled with drafting problems and ambiguities.”</p>
<p>Kaplan also dismissed Andrew’s claim that the deal must clear him because it had also protected embattled lawyer Alan Dershowitz from similar sex-abuse allegations by Giuffre.</p>
<p>The judge also staunchly defended Giuffre’s right to file the lawsuit using New York’s child victim’s act, which allowed historic allegations of abuse to still be brought to court.</p>
<p>Similar claims that it is unconstitutional have been “rejected by every New York state and federal court to have encountered it. And it has been rejected repeatedly for good reason,” he wrote.</p>
<p>After the decision, another of Giuffre’s lawyers, David Boies, said the accuser was “pleased” that “evidence will now be taken concerning her claims against him.”</p>
<p>“She looks forward to a judicial determination of the merits of those claims,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Boies has previously said he intends to depose up to a dozen people ahead of trial, including the prince himself.</p>
<p>They may also request to depose Meghan Markle because of her position as a US resident with ties to the royal family, Boies told Fox News in December.</p>
<p>“Meghan Markle, because of her position in the family, is one of those people,” he said.</p>
<p>“And because she’s in the United States, it’s easier to take her deposition than people in the United Kingdom. She is somebody who we are considering,” Boies added.</p>
<p>Andrew has vehemently denied the allegations, denying during a 2019 BBC interview that he recalled ever having met his accuser, even suggesting that a now-famous photo of them together was fake.</p>
<p>He has never been criminally charged, and his lawyers previously said he “unequivocally denies Giuffre’s false allegations against him.” They did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.</p>
<p>Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on the “ongoing legal matter.”</p>

<h1> Ex-Clinton adviser says there’s ‘good chance’ of 2024 Hillary/Trump rematch</h1>

<p>“There’s a good chance of it,” said Morris, referring to a Hillary-Trump rematch, to John Catsimatidis on the radio host’s WABC show. </p>
<p>“The second the election is over … every Democrat is going to take a shot at Biden and Harris. They will be DOA,” Morris said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at a time when no Democrats are publicly criticizing Biden, Clinton has been warning her party about aligning itself with the policies of progressive Democrats. </p>
<p>Morris said, “She was right about that.</p>
<p>“She staked out a ground, not on ideological issues, but on pragmatism.” </p>
<p>Clinton in the MSNBC interview also took a shot at the Biden administration’s struggle to pass legislation in a Democratic-controlled Congress. </p>
<p>An op-ed last week in the Wall Street Journal made the case for a 2024 Clinton run, saying the <a>poor poll numbers </a>for Biden and Harris, as well as Harris’ own unpopularity, could open the door for the former first lady. </p>
<p>“She is already in an advantageous position to become the 2024 Democratic nominee,” wrote Democratic political consultant Doug Schoen and former Manhattan Borough President Andrew Stein about the 74-year-old Clinton.</p>
<p>“She is an experienced national figure who is younger than Mr. Biden and can offer a different approach from the disorganized and unpopular one the party is currently taking.”</p>
<p>Trump hasn’t said he intends to run again in 2024, but he routinely bests other potential Republican candidates in polls. </p>
<p>In a recent <a>Reuters/Ipsos survey,</a> 54 percent of Republicans picked Trump as their top choice, far above the 11 percent who chose Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p>

<h1> Election a wake-up call for the woke: Devine</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> November 3, 2021 10:22pm <div> Updated <div> November 4, 2021 9:00am </div> </div> </div>
<p>It turns out that siccing the FBI onto Mama Bear and Papa Bear is not a vote winner. </p>
<p>Nor is indoctrinating their children in the fine arts of racial hatred, homosexual pornography, gender neutrality and anti-Americanism.</p>
<a>school board battles</a> exemplified the anti-woke backlash sweeping the country.
<a>supply-chain shortages,</a> rising crime, out-of-control illegal migration and the botched
<a>withdrawal from Afghanistan</a> are just a few of the self-inflicted debacles the president seems stubbornly determined to ignore. 
<p>So Tuesday became the “Brandon” election, as Florida <a>Gov. Ron DeSantis</a> dubbed it, referring to the new anthem of the disaffected: “Let’s go, Brandon.”</p>
<a>“F–k Joe Biden”</a> chant rocking sports stadiums every weekend, the Brandon euphemism came about at a NASCAR race at the
<a>Let’s go, Brandon!”</a>
<p>This caused much public mirth, and a new chant was born. </p>
<p><a>“Let’s go, Brandon!”</a> is a gentle expression of derision for a vengeful, blundering president who won office on a promise of being a trustworthy moderate who would unify the country and then proved to be the opposite.</p>
<p>The slogan is everywhere, on billboards, on T-shirts and hats, and protest signs at Biden events. Rapper Bryson Gray topped the music charts with a “Let’s Go Brandon” ditty, beating even Adele.</p>
<p>Dems, who spent four years wishing death <a>on Donald Trump,</a> are enraged at the mockery and have tried to rebrand the Brandon slogan as white supremacy.</p>
<a>Southwest Airlines pilot</a> supposedly said, “Let’s go, Brandon!” over the intercom during a flight last week, they campaigned to get him fired and he was branded a domestic terrorist akin to ISIS by an FBI agent-turned-CNN leftist.
<p>Sliming Republicans <a>as domestic terrorists</a> and white supremacists is the new “Russia Russia Russia” excuse deployed by Dems after every setback.</p>
<p>So, of course, after Tuesday’s drubbing at the polls, all we heard on MSNBC and CNN was that mild-mannered <a>Glenn Youngkin</a> had won the governor’s race in Virginia because of racism.</p>
<p>“These Republicans are dangerous … to our national security,” ranted <a>MSNBC’s Joy Reid,</a> “because stoking that kind of soft white nationalism eventually leads to the hard-core stuff.”</p>
<p>Well, Virginia’s sensational new lieutenant governor, former Marine <a>Winsome Sears,</a> has news for Reid.</p>
<p>“I have been black all my life, but that’s not what this is about,” the mother of three and former small businesswoman said in a <a>patriotic victory speech.</a></p>
<p>A few more highlights of a remarkable day:</p>
<ul><li>Republican Jason Miyares became the first Hispanic attorney general in Virginia.</li></ul>
<ul><li>In New Jersey, <a>Republican Jack Ciattarelli</a> nearly defeated incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy, despite being outspent 2 to 1.</li></ul>
<ul><li>New Jersey truck driver Ed Durr reportedly spent just $153 on his campaign and was leading state Senate President <a>Steve Sweeney,</a> who has controlled the state’s Democratic machine for 30 years, by 2,000 votes Wednesday.</li></ul>
<ul><li> In New York, record numbers of Republicans were elected to school boards.</li></ul>
<ul><li> In Minneapolis, the <a>“Defund the Police”</a> movement was repudiated in its birthplace when voters <a>rejected a proposal</a> to replace the police force with a “Public Safety” department.</li></ul>
<ul><li> In Antifa-infested, liberal Seattle, law-and-order Republican Ann Davison defeated a “Defund the Police” extremist.</li></ul>
<ul><li> In Texas, voters approved all eight proposed amendments to the state constitution and flipped a Dem seat.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, what the election results showed is that using Trump as a bogeyman doesn’t work anymore.</p>
<p>Stumping for Terry McAuliffe last week, Biden mentioned his predecessor an <a>obsessive 24 times</a> in one speech.</p>
<p><a>Trump Derangement Syndrome</a> might have driven voters to the polls in 2020, but Youngkin was endorsed by Trump and remained respectful, albeit aloof, and still won over a blue state Biden had <a>taken by 16 points.</a></p>
<p>Tuesday also showed that the patriotic populist movement centered around <a>family wins elections</a> for Republicans even without Trump on the ticket.</p>
<p>“Republicans are the party of parents, of education, of small businesses, of freedom, and family,” said New York Rep. Elise Stefanik.</p>
<p>Biden showed no self-reflection about the results and <a>twice refused to accept</a> any responsibility for the election results.</p>
<p>Even Democrats are displaying “Biden remorse.” A new NPR-PBS-Marist poll found that 44 percent of Democrats want someone else to be their nominee in 2024. The question is will Biden even make it that far.</p>

<h1> New Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin bans critical race theory, school mask rules</h1>

<div> January 15, 2022 8:55pm <div> Updated <div> January 15, 2022 8:55pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Republican Glenn Youngkin was sworn in as Virginia’s 74th governor Saturday — and took immediate action on the hot-button issues that secured his upset victory over former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in November.</p>
<p>Youngkin, nattily dressed in a morning coat and gray gloves, promised to “restore trust in government and to restore power to the people” in an optimistic inaugural speech that strove for bipartisanship after a bruising election battle.</p>
<p>“No matter who you voted for, I pledge to be your advocate, your voice, your governor,” he said outside the state capitol in Richmond.</p>
<a>sexual assaults on female classmates</a> sparked the parental revolt that gave him the governorship.
<p>Youngkin’s history-making GOP running mates were also sworn in during Saturday’s outdoor ceremony.</p>
<a>made her a conservative heroine</a>, became the commonwealth’s first black female lieutenant governor, and new Attorney General Jason Miyares is the first Latino to serve in that role.
<h1> Glenn Youngkin is right — mask mandates harm kids</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 8:29pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 8:42pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Glenn Youngkin promised to be on the side of parents as Virginia governor, and on his first day in office, he delivered. </p>
<p>The flak notwithstanding, his order is a sign of a growing backlash against COVID restrictions that will likely only gain force as the pandemic drags on and former articles of faith, including on masking, get increasingly called into doubt. </p>
<p>Despite Jen Psaki saying that Arlington County, which vows to defy Youngkin, is standing up for kids and their safety, the case for masking kids in schools is weak or nonexistent. </p>
<p>The United States is an outlier on this question. The CDC recommends masking all kids age 2 and older, whereas other health authorities are considerably more nuanced. </p>
<p>Youngkin’s offense, at bottom, is dissenting from this worldview and providing options for parents who don’t share it either. </p>
<h1> Virginia man arrested for abducting store clerk, who remains missing</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 11:12pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 8:51am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Virginia police have arrested a man in connection to the disappearance of a 28-year-old shop clerk, who has not been seen since she went to take out the trash after closing up shop last week, authorities said.</p>
<p>Tyrone N. Samuel, 50, of Heathsville, was arrested and charged with the abduction of Ahreal Smith, whose whereabouts are still unknown, Northumberland County Sheriff Johnny Beauchamp announced Sunday.</p>
<p>Several local businesses and organizations have pooled together a $9,400 reward for any information leading to her.</p>
<p>At 9:18 p.m., she was seen getting in and then getting out of a different car in the parking lot. Police interviewed the driver of the car and have determined he is not a suspect.</p>
<p>After she got out of the car, she walked back inside, set the alarm, locked up and picked up a bag of trash and began walking toward a dumpster on the side of the store, where she could no longer be seen on security cameras. </p>
<p>She has not been seen since. The next morning, police said the day shift clerk found Smith’s car still running in the parking lot. She was last seen wearing a black Nike hoodie, blue jeans and brown Ugg boots. She has multiple tattoos.</p>
<p>Beauchamp told reporters that Virginia State Police deployed a K-9 unit to track her scent from the dumpsters. The dogs caught the scent that led from the store to a nearby road for about 100 yards before losing it.</p>
<p>Officials believe she may have gotten into another vehicle so the dog lost track of her scent. A silver Crown Victoria was initially considered suspicious, but by Saturday<a> was no longer deemed a vehicle of interest</a>.</p>
<p>“That’s my sister. That’s all I got. If anybody knows anything, just let her go,” Lydia Smith, Ahreal’s sister, said at the press conference.</p>
<p>“If this was your family, what would you want somebody to do?” she pleaded.</p>
<p>Following Samuel’s arrest, the Northumberland County Sheriff’s Office has received several calls involving threats against those involved in the investigation.</p>

<div> December 24, 2021 4:44pm <div> Updated <div> December 26, 2021 12:32pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A German model says was uninvited from her friend’s wedding because she looked “too good” in her bridesmaid’s dress. </p>
<p>Alena Yildiz, 21, took to TikTok last week to share the sensational story, with her viral video racking up more than 10 million views in the days since. </p>
<p>“My close friend uninvited me to her wedding because she thought I looked too good in the dress SHE chose for me,” the scorned brunette captioned the clip. </p>
<p>She then shared several stunning photos of herself posing in the eye-catching design, writing: “Still took some fire pics in it tho[ugh].”</p>
<p>The beautiful brunette claims the bride-to-be even picked out the extravagant frock but made her pay for it herself. </p>
<p>The dress was designed by Albina Dyla, and cost Yildiz a whopping 1,200 euros ($1360 USD). </p>
<p>Yildiz’s TikTok video shows the strapless garment is cut low in the front, highlighting her cleavage. The blue and silver embellished dress also features a split in the leg which reaches up to the thigh. </p>
<p>The model <a>told Insider </a>that she sent a video of herself wearing the dress to the bride-to-be — who she refuses to name publicly — before she received an unexpected call. </p>
<p>“She called me and told me about her insecurities with my dress; that it was too attention-grabbing,” Yildiz explained. </p>
<p>“She was very angry about the whole situation and ended up uninviting me after the call. We got into a fight because it made no sense to me since she chose that dress herself.”</p>
<p>Yildiz says the other five bridesmaids were also ordered to wear similar head-turning garments, and was unclear as to why she was singled out. </p>
<p>The model and her pal are no longer on speaking terms. She told Insider she was sad to miss the wedding, which took place last week. </p>
<p>“We talked about her wedding for years, and I was so happy for my friend to finally be with the love of her life and to celebrate with her,” Yildiz said. </p>
<p>She even claimed that the bride contacted her after seeing the viral TikTok video, and that they argued further. </p>
<p>Yildiz says she has no idea whether she will ever make up with her longtime friend, but had some words of advice for all women. </p>
<p>“Another woman’s beauty doesn’t make your beauty fade, and I wish more people would understand that and be confident,” she said. </p>

<h1> A recovering addict to Mayor Adams: Don’t let NYC become San Francisco</h1>
<div> January 10, 2022 9:18pm <div> Updated <div> January 10, 2022 9:18pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>This recovering addict has some advice for our new mayor: Don’t let New York City become San Francisco.</p>
<p>But I understand that a mayor must protect the safety and public health of all constituents. Because addicts don’t just abuse substances — they also abuse fellow citizens to feed an unquenchable, expensive illness.</p>
<a>drug users shot up</a> in the open right on midtown Manhattan streets. This past spring,
<a>Washington Square Park descended to drug-den status</a> as Mayor Bill de Blasio shrugged his oh-so-tolerant shoulders.
<a>right outside a Bronx police station</a>. Just last month in Queens, a man high on a “controlled substance”
<a>murdered his girlfriend with a sword</a>.
<p>The point: Many addicts are desperate and therefore unpredictable and dangerous. Unlike cancer or heart disease, addiction is an illness whose symptoms include debauchery and chaos, including potentially criminal acts.</p>
<p>San Francisco’s failure shows the limits of hands-off progressive policies, which can ruin neighborhoods one broken window — or, as Breed put it, one random punch in the face — at a time.</p>
<p>“I know that San Francisco is a compassionate city,” Breed said. “But we’re not a city where anything goes.”</p>
<p>She’s right. Late, but right.</p>
<a>approval ratings in the 20s</a>. And there’s a reason New Yorkers elected you to replace him.
<p>Reasonable people don’t want to <a>eliminate gifted and talented education programs</a>; they realize life is meritocratic. Nor do they want police to sit back and do nothing as homicide rates soar.</p>
<p>And they don’t want addicts, however sad their sickness, shooting up on streets, mugging passersby or committing other crazed acts of violence.</p>
<p>We’re a city of laws, Mr. Mayor. It’s time someone leads like it. Don’t make New York the new San Francisco.</p>

<h1> DA Chesa Boudin won’t give San Francisco one thing it needs: tough love</h1>

<p>Last month, San Francisco Mayor London Breed said she made an emergency request to the city’s Board of Supervisors for more money to help support a police crackdown on crime, including open air drug dealing, car break-ins and retail theft. </p>
<a>announced</a>, “We will not prosecute cases involving quality-of-life crimes. Crimes such as public camping, offering or soliciting sex, public urination, blocking a sidewalk, etc., should not and will not be prosecuted.
<a>he said</a> it was because they are “themselves victims of human trafficking.”
<p>“The challenge going forward,” said Boudin in 2019, “is how do we close a jail?” </p>
<p>Car break-ins were 75 percent higher in May 2021 than in 2019, before the pandemic, and reached an astonishing 3,000 last month. Meanwhile, many business owners and residents tell me they long ago stopped bothering to report crime.</p>
<a>pushing an accomplice</a>, who later died, out of a robbery getaway car. 
<p>Breed’s grandmother was right about “tough love.” Hopefully, in the face of rising crime, San Franciscans, and progressives nationwide, will finally start to deliver some.</p>

<h1> Taliban orders shop owners in Afghanistan to behead all mannequins</h1>
<div> January 3, 2022 10:57am <div> Updated <div> January 3, 2022 10:58am </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Taliban has ordered clothes shop mannequins to be beheaded because they are “idols” as the brutes continue to wage war on women’s freedoms.</p>
<p>Shopkeepers in the western province of Herat in Afghanistan have been told to chop the heads off their mannequins after officials ruled the dummies were sinful “idols”.</p>
<p>The worshipping of idols is considered a sin in Islam, which bans the worship of anyone or thing other than Allah – considered to be the only God.</p>
<p>The harsh ruling was published this week by the Ministry for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice in Herat, the body responsible for overseeing the Taliban’s strict interpretation of Islam. </p>
<p>The ministry initially ordered shopkeepers to remove the mannequins completely but the store owners hit back and said it would cause significant financial loss.</p>
<p>The complaints prompted Sheikh Aziz-u-Rahman, the head of the ministry, to order the mannequins to be beheaded instead, according to local reports.</p>
<p>A note to shopkeepers said: “All the statues and mannequins in your stores must be headless.”</p>
<p>Business owner Abdul Wadood Faiz Zada told Italian newspaper Repubblica: “Each mannequin costs $100, or $80 or $70, and beheading them will be a huge financial loss.”</p>
<p>Mohammad Yusuf added: “The Taliban have not changed, there will be restrictions once again. “</p>
<p>“They have not gained international recognition, but should they obtain it, they would bring back even stricter limitations.”</p>
<p>Afghan women have faced a savage crackdown on their freedoms and education since the Taliban swept into power earlier this year.</p>
<p>Women and girls have long been warned they will be the biggest potential victims of the Taliban takeover as the fighters roll back 20 years of progress.</p>
<p>Brutal, oppressive and sexist laws enacted by the group in the 90s are being rolled back into place.</p>
<p>Women face being murdered for showing too much flesh, demanding basic human rights, having affairs and being rape victims.</p>
<p>The brutes had already reportedly burnt to death a woman after they said she served below-par cooking to its members.</p>
<p>And as the Taliban stormed across Afghanistan, it was reported their militants were already kidnapping children as young as 12.</p>
<p>A charity also recently issued an urgent warning as baby girls as young as 20-days-old are being offered up for marriage.</p>
<h2>“Lifetime of suffering”</h2>
<p>UNICEF said they received “credible reports” of the days-old babies promised for future marriages in exchange for a dowry.</p>
<p>The charity estimates 28 percent of Afghan women aged between 15 and 49 are <a>married off before they reach 18</a>.</p>
<p>And <a>rules brought in by the Taliban banning teen girls from attending school</a> are only making the situation worse.</p>
<p>UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore said: “Education is often the best protection against negative coping mechanisms such as child marriage and child labor.”</p>
<p>She added child marriage “can lead to a lifetime of suffering”.</p>
<p>Taliban fighters are also allegedly buying child brides and even <a>babies to be raised and turned into sex slaves</a> for as a little as $1,074</p>
<p>Sources have said children as young as one are reportedly being sold to the vile extremists in exchange for cash, livestock and weapons.</p>
<p>Habiba Jamshidi, a women’s rights activist in the west of the country, said women make up half of the population and should not be treated inhumanely.</p>
<p>She said one of the reasons behind the child marriage issue is the lack of “proper awareness of the role and position of women”.</p>

<h1> Illinois district defends offering ‘After School Satan Club’ at elementary school</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 14, 2022 1:00am <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 1:01am </div> </div> </div>
<p>An Illinois school district is defending an elementary school offering “After School Satan Club,” an extracurricular educational program sponsored by the Satanic Temple of the United States. </p>
<p>The program, for children in grades first through fifth, will be taught by volunteers at The Jane Addams Elementary School in Moline, and will meet five times this year beginning Thursday, flyers circulating on social media claim.</p>
<p>“We prefer to give children an appreciation of the natural wonders surrounding them, not a fear of everlasting other-worldly horrors.”</p>
<a>according to a letter from Rachel Savage</a>, Moline-Coal Valley Schools Superintendent, to district families.
<p>She said that the space rental was “not generated by the district and is not affiliated with Jane Addams or the district.”</p>
<p>Thirty flyers were sent to the school from the Satanic Temple and were placed in the school lobbies, as are all flyers for organizations and events at the school that are “religious in nature.”</p>
<p>She further noted that the board of education permits community usage of its facilities, and approves several agreements with local churches.</p>
<p>The Satanic Temple says it views Satan as a “mythical figure representing individual freedom,” according to its website.</p>
<h1> Anti-vax dad in Canada abducts 7-year-old daughter to stop her mom from giving her shot</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 11:46am <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 11:46am </div> </div> </div>
<p>A girl has been abducted by her anti-vax dad who said he was doing God’s work by preventing her getting a Covid jab.</p>
<p>The seven-year-old was taken into hiding by dad Michael Jackson and has not been seen by her mum for two months.</p>
<p>Jackson appeared on a web-based talk show Canada to explain why the girl had not been returned to heartbroken mum Mariecar Jackson after she went to visit him.</p>
<p>“I’m following God, and I’m doing what he wants me to do,” he said.</p>
<p>Jackson appeared last week via video from an undisclosed location with the girl, CBC reports.</p>
<p>He admitted that he has kept the girl since about November 11, long past when he was supposed to return her to her mother.</p>
<p>When told his wife would probably vaccinate the girl, Jackson said “my choice was made then and there that this wasn’t going to work, and that I had to protect my daughter from it”.</p>
<p>Mariecar said her marriage ended seven years ago and has now appealed to the public for help tracking the girl down.</p>
<p>“She’s only seven. She needs to be home. I just want her home,” she told CBC.</p>
<p>With tears running down her face, Mariecar addressed her daughter, saying: “Mommy will never stop looking for you.”</p>
<p>“Mommy loves you so much. Every day, I pray that some day you’ll be home.”</p>
<p>“I love you so much. Mommy is standing strong and some day we will be together.”</p>
<p>Her lawyer Jill Drennan said Jackson might have now have fled Saskatchewan province with his daughter.</p>
<p>“We simply don’t know where she is. We are asking the public for help. We’ve never seen anything quite like this.”</p>
<p>Saskatchewan judges have reportedly issued two court orders for Jackson to return the girl to her mother.</p>

<h1> Rabbi who was held hostage in Texas synagogue says he’s ‘grateful to be alive’</h1>
<div> January 16, 2022 7:04pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 6:30am </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Texas rabbi who was held hostage with three of his congregants for hours at his synagogue Saturday said he’s “grateful to be alive” following the tense standoff. </p>
<p>“I am grateful for my family. I am grateful for the CBI Community, the Jewish Community, the Human Community. I am grateful that we made it out. I am grateful to be alive.”</p>
<p>Cytron-Walker and the others were held captive around 11 a.m. Saturday during a Shabbat morning service by Malik Faisal Akram — who was shot dead in the ordeal.</p>
<p>Akram, a 44-year-old British national, had demanded the release of Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist with suspected ties to al Qaeda currently locked up at a federal prison in Texas.</p>
<p>The harrowing situation lasted 10 hours, and by 9:30 p.m., all four hostages were released and safe — with video showing them dramatically fleeing through a door before Akram was fatally shot by an elite FBI rescue team.</p>
<p>“It’s a little overwhelming as you can imagine. It was not fun yesterday,” the married dad of two daughters said Sunday.</p>
<p>He was ordained as a rabbi in 2006.</p>

<h1> Actress Julia Sawalha plucked from ‘Chicken Run 2’ for sounding ‘too old’</h1>
<div> July 10, 2020 1:17pm <div> Updated <div> July 10, 2020 1:39pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Casting agents wanted a younger bird.</p>
<p>Julia Sawalha, who voiced the character of Ginger in the 2000 film “Chicken Run,” will not be voicing the character in the upcoming sequel because producers have deemed her too old, she said.</p>
<p>“Chicken Run 2 announcement! I have officially been plucked, stuffed roasted,” Sawalha, 51, captioned a Twitter post Thursday with the hashtag #ageism and her full open letter on the matter.</p>
<p>Mel Gibson, 64, who co-starred alongside Sawalha in the original animated film, was also <a>axed from the sequel</a>.</p>
<p>Still, while she did not respect the decision she does not maintain ill will for the project, and wrote that she wished the production “the best of luck and the greatest success with the sequel.”</p>
<p>Aardman Animations, which produced “Chicken Run,” has not responded to a request for comment, according to <a>the Hollywood Reporter.</a></p>

<h1> New ‘extreme’ dating site only matches users with 20-year age gap</h1>
<div> August 25, 2020 10:34am <div> Updated <div> August 25, 2020 10:58am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Age may be just a number for some, but for users of this new dating website it’s vital that their partner be radically younger or older than them.</p>
<p>Site creator David Minns bills his new matchmaking app, 20 Dating, as the “World’s 1st extreme age gap dating site.” The site only matches users with people 20 years younger or older than them, and photos are optional.</p>
<p>There’s no swiping on 20 Dating, or barriers to communication, meaning the algorithm allows all users with the appropriate age gap to instantly contact one another.</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 2</div> </div> </div>
<p>Minns isn’t the only tech creator to think up the idea of an age gap-based matchmaking site. The free app Gaper, launched in the Apple store last year, also specializes in connecting lovers with many years between them.</p>
<p>Previously, Minns has experimented with applying other niche concepts to dating sites.</p>

<div> October 5, 2020 4:01pm <div> Updated <div> October 5, 2020 6:17pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A former marketing executive was chastised by his bosses for being “too American,” wearing khaki pants to work and being too old, according to an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint.</p>
<p>“It was very upsetting and the kind of the way it happened was quite disconcerting,” Hollett, 61, told The Post of his termination.</p>
<p>Boyden, which was created in Bronxville, NY, in 1946, has over 65 offices in over 40 countries worldwide but is headquartered in Purchase, about 30 miles north of Midtown Manhattan, according to the complaint and Boyden’s website.</p>
<p>“I felt quite humiliated,” Hollett, a dad of two and Long Island native who lives in Connecticut, said of being criticized for his business casual attire.</p>
<p>In August 2019, the managing partner for Boyden UK, Nick Robeson, a respondent in the complaint, was upset over a marketing decision Hollett made, the complaint states.</p>
<p>When Hollett explained his decision, Robeson told him his arguments were “outdated” and it was “time to retire,” according to emails attached to the complaint.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine being told, after more than a decade of success, it is time to retire?” Patrick J. Boyd, the attorney representing Hollett, told The Post.</p>
<p>Following more than 13 years at the company, replete with promotions, raises and positive performance reviews, Hollett was suddenly terminated in January, the filing claims.</p>
<p>“I believe that my age, national origin and complaints about discrimination were unlawful factors in the decision to terminate my employment.”</p>
<p>Hollett said he’s disheartened and struggling as he navigates a pandemic-ravaged job market and the loss of a career that he loved.</p>
<p>Kasten and Robeson did not return a request for comment.</p>
<h1> ‘Toyboy’ defends his romance with 82-year-old lover: ‘She’s the boss’</h1>
<div> December 1, 2021 1:04pm <div> Updated <div> December 1, 2021 1:19pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>An Egyptian toyboy who married an elderly British woman is blasting critics who claim he is using her for a visa and money.</p>
<p>Jones — who is retired and gets by on a £200 ($266) weekly government allowance — flew to Cairo to meet Ibriham before they tied the knot in November 2020.</p>
<p>Ibraham recently relocated to the UK but insists he did not woo Jones purely to take up residency in Britain.</p>
<p>The couple appeared on British chat show “This Morning” Tuesday to defend the legitimacy of their relationship.</p>
<p>“Some people attack us. Why? I am working,” Ibrahim declared. “I’m not with Iris because I need something … I am a rich man, I have a bungalow in Cairo.”</p>
<p>Ibraham further claimed Jones was “the boss” in their relationship.</p>
<p>Still, Jones admitted it hasn’t been smooth sailing since her husband moved in with her.</p>
<p>“We’re going through problems now because Mohamed is adjusting to life in the west and I’m adjusting to having a man around the place,” she confessed.</p>
<p>The pair hit headlines last year when they revealed graphic details about their sex life in a separate interview with “This Morning.”</p>
<p>Jones told the program: “The first night was pretty rough. Nobody had been near me for 35 years … I thought I was a virgin again!”</p>
<p>The elderly woman continued: “Can I tell you what we used? A whole tube of KY jelly. The thing is I couldn’t walk the next day … I felt like I was riding a horse!”</p>
<p>The pair also took the opportunity during that interview to defend their romance, according to the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>“The love does not know any difference between age, or countries,” Ibraham declared. “This is our life, Iris chose me and I chose Iris.”</p>
<p>“I want to say for all the people who attack our love, it’s none of your business, focus your lives, go to hell. That is all.”</p>
<p>The couple’s relationship isn’t the only one to face scrutiny due to a significant age gap.</p>
<p>Milind Soman, a 52-year-old Indian actor, defended his relationship with Ankita Konwar, an 18-year-old flight attendant, in 2017. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, 33-year-old Lorena Matarrita <a>told The Post in 2019 that she was crazy in love with her much-older beau Nick Bisesi, 57, </a>despite their 24-year age gap.</p>

<h1> Cruz quizzes FBI brass on Capitol riot conspiracy theory at Senate hearing</h1>

<p>Epps, a former Marine, has become the centerpiece of conspiracy theories that the feds provoked the mayhem and spurred on the rioters to commit violence.</p>
<p>“Ms. Sanborn, was Ray Epps a fed?” asked Cruz after stating that Epps was captured on video the night of Jan. 5, 2021 rousing people to “get into the Capitol.”</p>
<p>“Sir, I cannot answer that question,” replied Sanborn, who added that she was “aware of the individual,” but didn’t have “specific background” on him.</p>
<p>Cruz went on and stated that on Jan. 6, Epps was seen talking to rioters moments before they ripped down police barricades outside the Capitol.</p>
<p>Sanborn responded that she couldn’t answer whether Epps urged them to knock down the barricades.</p>
<p>Cruz then noted that Epps initially appeared on a poster issued by the FBI seeking information about people connected to criminal activity on Jan. 6, but was absent from another FBI “seeking information” poster distributed July 1. </p>
<p>In a statement Tuesday evening, the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot said claims that Epps was an informant were “unsupported.”</p>
<p>He told the newspaper that he meant that “we would go in the doors like everyone else. It was totally, totally wrong the way they went in.”</p>
<p>Cruz’s line of questioning marks an abrupt departure from his previous view about the events of Jan. 6.</p>
<p>During a Jan. 5 Senate hearing, Cruz described the riot as a “violent terrorist attack” and said that anyone taking part “should be prosecuted.” </p>
<h1> DOJ creating unit focused on domestic terrorism amid spike in threats</h1>
<div> January 11, 2022 11:51pm <div> Updated <div> January 11, 2022 11:52pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Department of Justice is creating a specialized domestic terrorism unit, the department’s top national-security official said Tuesday, amid a “growing threat” from violent extremists in America.</p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen revealed the new unit while testifying in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>“We have seen a growing threat from those who are motivated by racial animus, as well as those who ascribe to extremist anti-government and anti-authority ideologies,” Olsen said.</p>
<p>Since the spring of 2020, Olsen said the number of FBI probes into suspected domestic violent extremists has doubled.</p>
<p>The Justice Department already has a counterterrorism section within its National Security Division, which is led by Olsen.</p>
<p>The new unit will “augment our existing approach” and “ensure that these cases are properly handled and effectively coordinated,” Olsen said.</p>

<h1> Dentist accused of killing wife during Africa hunting trip</h1>
<div> January 13, 2022 8:39pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 8:04am </div> </div> </div>
<p>A Pennsylvania dentist and big-game hunter is accused of killing his wife of 34 years while on a hunting trip in Zambia in 2016 in a scheme to collect millions of dollars in life insurance money.</p>
<p>Big-game hunter Lawrence Rudolph, 67, allegedly shot and killed his wife Bianca Finizio Rudolph on a trip to Zambia in 2016, then claimed nearly $5 million in insurance benefits, according to a federal criminal complaint obtained by CBS 2. </p>
<p>Rudolph, who founded and operates the Three Rivers Dental in Pittsburgh, allegedly rushed to have his wife’s remains cremated in Africa just days after her death, officials said.</p>
<p>He has now been charged with foreign murder and mail fraud, officials said.</p>
<p>According to federal investigators, Rudolph made life insurance claims through seven different life insurance companies for a $4.8 million payout for his wife’s death, which was ruled as accidental by Zambian law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>On Oct. 11, 2016 at 5:30 a.m. local time, Bianca was shot in the chest with a shotgun.</p>
<p>A professional hunting guide on scene allegedly “recalled seeing the shotgun and an expanded shotshell on the ground. The shotgun was inside a partially zipped gun case.”</p>
<p>Bianca had filed her first life insurance policy in 1987, according to investigators, and updated the policy in 2016, when she died.</p>
<p>Four of the seven companies hired a private investigation firm to look into Bianca’s death. All of the insurance policies determined that Rudolph should receive his payment from the policy.</p>
<p>“Now, more than five years later, the government is seeking to manufacture a case against this well-respected and law-abiding dentist. Dr. Rudolph looks forward to his trial, where he will demonstrate his innocence.”</p>

<p>A 15-year-old girl was fatally struck by a school bus in a Brooklyn hit-and-run Monday morning, cops said. </p>
<p>Cops responded to Bedford Avenue and Avenue P in Sheepshead Bay minutes before 8 a.m. and found the teen lying in the street, police said. </p>
<p>Police confirmed later Monday that she was struck by a school-bus driver who fled the scene.</p>
<p>The teen, whose name has not been released pending family notification, was pronounced dead at the scene. </p>
<p>It was not immediately clear where the teen was headed when she was struck.</p>
<p>James Madison High School is located at that intersection, but the city’s public schools were closed Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. </p>
<p>A spokesman for the city’s Department of Education said he could not confirm details about individual students.</p>
<p>“I will note that today is a federal holiday and no DOE buses were running today,” he said. </p>
