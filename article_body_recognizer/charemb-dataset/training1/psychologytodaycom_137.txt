<h1> Awareness as a Tool: The "Circle of Life" </h1>
<h2> Emotions reflect your body's physiology; you must be aware of them to change. </h2>
<li> Awareness is at the center of life; you cannot make good decisions without understanding the relevant factors.</li>
<li>The “circle of life” represents three states of the human experience and reflects your body’s current physiological state. </li>
<li>Combining awareness skills with the “circle of life” allows you to selectively use tools to regulate your body’s chemistry. </li>
<p>You must learn to become aware of your physiological state and choose where and when you want to go or stay. Whatever set of tools you decide to implement begins with awareness. Where in the “circle of life” are you at this minute?</p>
<a>anger</a>; then you are able to create the life you want.
<p>Just solving problems doesn’t yield a good life. You must live a good life to have a good life.</p>
<h3>Putting awareness to work</h3>
<p>Seeing your unawareness will allow you to deepen your awareness and start you down the pathway of using awareness as a tool. </p>
<p>Second, understanding and nurturing different types of awareness enables you to learn skills in each of these arenas. Here are four suggested types to use as a baseline.</p>
<ul><li>Environmental</li> <li>Emotional</li> <li>Judgment, or the stories you tell yourself</li> <li>Ingrained patterns</li> </ul>
<a>attention</a> away from disruptive thought patterns. With practice, it becomes automatic and calms your mind.
<a>nervous system</a> and chemistry so that you feel even more.
<p>Creating a clear awareness of your programming is a powerful way of switching your life from a reactive to a creative mode. It is also a much more interesting way of interacting with others, as opposed to constantly projecting your views onto them.</p>
<p>Remember, the steps required to create neuroplastic changes in your brain are: 1) awareness, 2) separation (create some “space” between you and your problem), and 3) redirecting your attention.</p>
<p>Moving easily between all aspects of your life on your terms is the goal of the healing journey. Then you are beginning your real journey of life.</p>

<p>I asked Joanie if she might write down some of her experiences dealing with emotions in the hopes that it would help others. Here are her words:</p>
<a>stress</a> my innocent victimhood, I often feel ashamed of what happened to me and how the after-effects are so palpable, every day, in so many ways.
<p>I become ashamed of the words I can’t remember or the ones I mispronounce, or the times I get confused about where I am, or the times when my emotions boil up and I want to yell at whoever is nearby.</p>
<p>I feel shame when someone hears about the assault and looks at me as if I’m now suddenly fragile and someone to pity.</p>
<a>shame</a> are deeply painful and difficult for most of us to process following trauma for many reasons including the lack of emotions
<a>education</a> provided by our dysfunctional society. The good news is that tuning into our emotions can pave the way to further growth and healing.
<a>process that anger up </a>and out. On our own or with the guidance of an emotion-centered trauma therapist, we can enlist
<a>fantasies</a> in actively healing ways. In addition, we can use the enlivening energy of anger to make a difference—as Joanie did—by writing a
<a>wonderful book</a> to help others.
<p>When we feel sadness, we are called to fully accept our suffering and <a>mourn for the loss</a> of cherished parts of ourselves. Our sadness is our self-love and self-compassion.</p>
<p>And when we feel shame, we know we must <a>tend to the parts</a> of us that are still hidden away, mistaking our suffering for a flaw.</p>

<h2> Tossing a cultural trope and drawing the line between competition and abuse. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Family Dynamics </li> <li> <a>Find a family counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>The term "sibling rivalry" can mislead parents, leading them to ignore sibling abuse.</li>
<li>Healthy competition requires balance of power between siblings. Parents can contribute by not playing favorites or using competion to criticize.</li>
<li>Physical aggression is strikingly common between and among siblings. Surprisingly, it can teach valuable skills when it is mutual or dyadic.</li>
<li>Sibling abuse is about power. It is always one-sided.</li>
<a>narcissistic</a> traits, hypercritical, controlling, or highly combative. In these families, siblings are frequently pitted against each other. That was true for “Joe,” now 42:
<h3>How the term “sibling rivalry” blinds us to sibling abuse</h3>

<a>competition</a>, conflict, violence, and abuse.
<h3>Understanding competition between siblings</h3>
<h3>Surveying conflict in sibling relationships</h3>
<p>But even in a household where constructive behavior has been modeled, it’s clear that constant negative conflict between siblings can alter the dynamics of a family as well as the sibling relationship.</p>
<h3>Is roughhousing violence between siblings?</h3>

<p>So mutual or bi-directional physical aggression actually has its benefits, as counterintuitive as that may seem. </p>
<h3>When it’s not mutual, it’s abuse</h3>
<a>sexual</a>, psychological or verbal, and relational—but verbal abuse is by far the most prevalent. Among siblings, verbal abuse includes insults, name-calling, and threats to property. Again, because siblings do chivy for
<a>attention</a> in the household, it may be difficult for the parents to distinguish between chivying, an expression of frustration, and verbal abuse which is about dominance.
<h3>Beyond sibling rivalry</h3>
<p>If you’re a parent of siblings, pay close attention to not just your behaviors but theirs. Step in if necessary. </p>

<h1>Anxiety: Another Name for Pain</h1>
<p>Understand it and solve it </p>
<div> <div> <h2>Deepening Your Awareness of Unawareness</h2> <p>If you are anxious or frustrated, you are in the past and not present. Understanding the various ways you are unaware is the first step in cultivating awareness.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Awareness as a Tool: The "Circle of Life"</a></h2>
<p>We don't like feeling pain, so we often try to avoid or suppress it. You must first feel the pain to reprogram your brain. The "circle of life" provides a framework in which to navigate.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How Ingrained Patterns Affect Your Life Lens</a></h2> <p>We are each programmed by our past, which determines our attitudes and behaviors. These ingrained patterns are impossible for us to see.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>It Is Impossible Not to Be Judgmental </a></h2> <p>Awareness of disruptive thought patterns allows you to separate and powerfully move past them. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Judgment and Storytelling: The Deadly Nature of Self-Esteem</a></h2> <p>Your prior life experience, as well as the opinions of others, determines every action you take. Awareness of your "stories" is key.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>You Have to Feel to Heal: Emotional Awareness </a></h2> <p>Emotional pain and physical pain share similar neurological circuits. It is no wonder that we do everything we can to not feel unpleasant emotions. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Connecting to Life with Your Senses: Environmental Awareness</a></h2> <p>The harder you fight unpleasant racing thoughts, the stronger they will become. Why not just change direction?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>From Reactive to Creative: "C" First</a></h2>
<p>When you are anxious or angry, the present has often triggered something from the past. You are there and not here. You must create some "space" and "C" first to remain aware.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Flip Your Consciousness: 4 Types of Awareness </a></h2> <p>Our worldview is shaped by our past experiences, so we are continually projecting our worldview onto everything. What if you could reverse it?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Becoming Aware of Being Unaware </a></h2> <p>It is impossible to develop pure awareness but an important step is understanding your own filter.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Letting Go of Victim Mentality to Heal</a></h2> <p>Anger and anxiety are hard-wired survival physiological reactions that don't respond to reason. Pain is magnified in this state. Healing involves "letting go" and moving on.</p> </div>
<h2><a>"Anger Academy"—Processing Anger Is a Complex Skill</a></h2>
<p>Understanding the complex nature of the anger response allows you to learn strategies that address each and all aspects of it. It is a skill set to be used daily.</p>
