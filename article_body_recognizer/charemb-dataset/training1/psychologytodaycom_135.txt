<h1> Why Being in a Long-Term Relationship May Make Women More Depressed </h1>
<h2> Women’s self-esteem suffers more than men’s as romantic relationships progress. </h2>

<li>A new study analyzed data from people in two romantic partnerships to see how their feelings about themselves and their lives change over time. </li>
<li>The study found that married couples became less satisfied with their lives during the first partnership than those cohabiting or dating. </li>
<li>It also found that over the course of the first partnership, the women became more depressed and less satisfied than the men. </li>

<h3>Do Couples Feel Better About Themselves and Their Lives as Their Relationship Progresses?</h3>
<p>In short, years into the second partnership, people felt no more satisfied with their lives and no better about themselves than they had when they were first asked about the first partnership. The only difference was that they felt more depressed.</p>

<h3>Did Older People Do Better?</h3>
<a>proponents of traditional marriage</a> argued vociferously for the superiority of marriage over what was sometimes called, in all seriousness, “living in sin.” Some are still trying to make the same case.
<h3>Have We Been Getting It Wrong About Romantic Relationships—Especially in Women’s Lives?</h3>
<p>“Happily ever after” is for fairy tales. Real people in romantic partnerships typically feel worse over time. They feel less satisfied with their relationship and more depressed, and their self-esteem slumps.</p>

<a>divorcing</a>, remarrying, widowhood, and living apart from a partner in

<a>there are always exceptions</a> to the typical findings, and your own experiences may be among them.

<h1> The Profound Benefits of Prioritizing Friendships </h1>
<h2> A study of 323,000 people in 99 nations showed how valuing friends might matter. </h2>
<li>People who prioritize friendships tend to be slightly happier, healthier and more satisfied with their lives, an international survey shows.</li>
<li>Those who are most likely to value friends include women, people with higher levels of education and people in countries with less inequality.</li>
<li>Women, older people, people with lower levels of education and people in individualistic cultures tend to benefit the most from friendships.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: antoniodiaz/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Did It Matter if People Valued Their Friends?</h3>
<ul><li>Happier</li> <li>Healthier</li> <li>More satisfied with their lives</li> </ul>
<h3>Who Valued Friends More?</h3>
<p>Averaged across all the participants, the people who tended to value friends more were:</p>
<li>People with higher levels of <a>education</a></li>
<li>People in countries with less inequality in wealth (a more equal distribution)</li>
<li>People in countries that allow more enjoyment of life (instead of “suppression of gratification of needs by strict social norms”)</li>
<h3>Who Got the Most Out of Their Valuing of Friendship?</h3>
<a>friendship</a> was linked to health and
<a>happiness</a> in the results averaged across the 323,200 participants. For some people, the link was even stronger than it was for others. The possible benefits to health and happiness of valuing friends seemed even greater for:
<ul><li>Women</li> <li>Older people</li> <li>People with lower levels of education</li> <li>People in individualistic cultures (the ones that value individual freedoms more)</li> </ul>
<h3>A Few Things to Keep in Mind</h3>
<p>Second, none of the results were particularly strong. The findings were statistically significant, but still, the people who valued their friends more were only a little bit happier, healthier, and more satisfied with their lives.</p>
<h3>Why Are These Findings Important?</h3>
<a>why friends are more important than we realized</a>. I have also reviewed some enlightening research by other scholars. For example:
<li><a>Single people invest more in their friends, then enjoy payoffs to their self-esteem</a>, as shown by Alexandra N. Fisher and her colleagues Danu Anthony Stinson, Joanne V. Wood, John G. Holmes, and Jessica J. Cameron.</li>
<li><a>People who choose to be single value their friends more, and people who value their friends more become more committed to being single</a>. We learned that from research by fellow Psychology Today blogger Elyakim Kislev.</li>
<li><a>Friendship skills matter more than romantic relationship skills to future success</a>, Glenn I. Roisman and his colleagues showed, in a 10-year longitudinal study (a study of the same people over time).</li>
<p>All this <a>attention</a> to friendship, especially in the lives of single people, is relatively new. I think it is a very heartening development.</p>

<h1> How Single People Get Patronized and Excluded </h1>
<h2> What’s bothering single people is not the lack of a romantic partner. </h2>
<p> Posted August 18, 2021 </p>
<li>Compared to coupled people, single people more often feel patronized, excluded, threatened, and unsupported, according to recent research.</li>
<li>Feeling patronized and unsupported due to unfair treatment may lead single people to feel less satisfied with life, the research shows.</li>
<li>Other studies suggests that single people are typically happy and healthy. They are thriving despite getting patronized and excluded.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Spectral-Design/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>If you have had those kinds of experiences, do you think you might feel a little less satisfied with your life than you would if people were a tad less patronizing?</p>
<a>discrimination</a>,” was just published in Social Psychological and
<h3>What Counted as Getting Patronized or Excluded? </h3>
<a>singlism</a>,” the stereotyping, stigmatizing, and marginalizing of single people, and the discrimination against them. Girme and her colleagues also wanted to know whether single people felt supported and whether that mattered.
<p>Below are examples of the questions the researchers asked to assess their participants’ experiences of singlism, as well as their satisfaction with their lives and their <a>romantic relationship</a> status.</p>
<p>Getting patronized: “In your day-to-day life, how often do people insist that they know what is best for you?”</p>
<p>Getting excluded: “How often do people happily interact with you in formal situations but not social ones?”</p>
<p>Experiencing other kinds of negative treatment: “How often do people do things that threaten you?” How often are they (not) “friendly and willing to help you?”</p>
<p>Feeling unsupported: “There is no one I can turn to for guidance in times of <a>stress</a>.”</p>
<p>Feeling satisfied with life: “I am satisfied with my life.”</p>
<h3>Who Counted as Single?</h3>
<h3>Getting Patronized, Excluded, and Unsupported </h3>
<p>In both studies, single people, compared to coupled people, more often felt patronized, excluded, threatened, and unsupported. Other people also seemed less friendly to the single people and less willing to help.</p>
<p>All that singlism undermined single people’s satisfaction. Because of feeling patronized and unsupported, single people felt less satisfied.</p>
<h3>Everyday Singlism and Singlism Built into Laws, Policies, and Practices</h3>
<a>sibling</a>. Discrimination built into laws and policies can massively disadvantage single people economically. In
<a>medical settings</a>, the biases single people face can be life-threatening.
<h3>The Resilience of Single People</h3>
<a>always been single</a>, though, are often happier and more satisfied with their lives than people who were once married.
<p>That’s not a story of single people’s deficits and inferiority. It is a story of strength and <a>resilience</a>.</p>

<h1> Beyond Happiness: Why a Psychologically Rich Life Is a Good Life </h1>
<h2> What we get from psychological richness that happiness does not provide. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: mavo/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Happy lives, meaningful lives, and psychologically rich lives have some things in common; you don’t necessarily have to choose. But a psychologically rich life is distinct from those other two kinds of good lives.</p>
<h3>What Are the Characteristics of a Psychologically Rich Life?</h3>
<p>Three key characteristics of a psychologically rich life are variety, interestingness, and perspective-changing experiences. The “Psychologically Rich Life Questionnaire” taps those characteristics.</p>
<li>Variety: “My life has been full of unique, unusual experiences.”</li>
<li>Interest: “I have had a lot of interesting experiences.”</li>
<li>Perspective changes: “On my deathbed, I am likely to say ‘I have seen and learned a lot.’”</li>
<p>The characteristics of a happy life are very different, and include comfort, security, and joy. The characteristics of a meaningful life are different, too, and include significance and purpose.</p>
<h3>Personality: What Kinds of People Lead Psychologically Rich Lives?</h3>
<li>They are open to experience (e.g., they have unconventional attitudes, artistic sensitivity, intellectual curiosity, flexibility, depth of feeling).</li>
<li>They experience emotions intensely, both positive and negative ones.</li>
<p>It is not enough just to experience intense emotions. You also need to think about those emotional experiences and try to make sense of them.</p>
<h3>What Facilitates a Life of Psychological Richness?</h3>
<p>If you want a psychologically rich life, it will help to have curiosity, time, energy, and spontaneity.</p>
<p>Certain kinds of life experiences are associated with a psychologically rich life. They include:</p>
<ul><li>Spending a semester abroad, or just taking short trips in your everyday life</li> <li>Challenging or dramatic life events</li> </ul>
<a>Divorce</a>, for example, can be painful—but it can also change your perspective in a way that can be psychologically enriching.
<h3>What Do You Get Out of a Psychologically Rich Life?</h3>
<p>People who lead happy lives get personal satisfaction. People who live meaningful lives get to contribute to society. People who live psychologically rich lives are rewarded with <a>wisdom</a>. For example:</p>
<li>They have a depth and breadth of knowledge.</li>
<li>They have complex reasoning styles.</li>
<li>They consider multiple causes for other people’s behavior.</li>
<li>They realize that what they know isn’t definitive and isn’t universal.</li>
<p>This wisdom, the authors believe, comes from the many different kinds of life experiences of people who lead psychologically rich lives, experiences that introduce them to different perspectives and show them life’s complexities.</p>
<h3>Global Perspectives: The Good Life, in 9 Nations</h3>
<a>happiness</a>, meaningfulness, and psychological richness (e.g., eventful, interesting). People in all nine nations typically rated their ideal lives as high on all three dimensions.
<h3>Are Single People Especially Likely to Lead Psychologically Rich Lives?</h3>
<p>The authors never compared people of different marital or relationship statuses in the studies they described. They did, however, mention this:</p>
<p>Several of the characteristics and experiences of people who lead psychologically rich lives have also been linked to staying single or liking single life. For example:</p>
<a>The badass personalities of people who like being alone</a>,” I reviewed multiple studies showing that people who like spending time alone, and people who are unafraid of being single, are more likely than others to be open-minded.
<a>pursue their dreams</a>. That could mean pursuing adventures or other intriguing opportunities, or choosing meaningful work over more lucrative work when they can’t have both, or being there for the people who mean the most to them.
<a>single at heart</a>, would tend to experience more psychological richness in their lives.

<h1> Older Women with No Kids Have Better Health and More Wealth </h1>
<h2> The Census Bureau surveys the growing population of older adults with no kids. </h2>
<h3>How Many Older Adults in the U.S. Have No Biological Children?</h3>
<p>Of adults in the U.S. who are 55 or older, 16.5 percent have no biological children. Men are more likely than women to have no biological children: 18.2 percent compared to 15.0 percent.</p>
<p>Hispanics have the smallest percentage of older adults with no biological children (11) and Whites the highest (17). For Blacks, the percentage is 14.5, and for Asians, it's 12.8.</p>
<p>The number of adults who have no biological children has been growing. The youngest of the older people have the highest percentage with no biological children:</p>
<ul><li>55-64 years old: 19.6 percent</li> <li>65-74 years old: 15.9 percent</li> <li>75 and older: 10.9 percent</li> </ul>
<a>in Northwestern Europe from 1500 on, the percent of adults with no children was also high</a>, with the same exception as in the U.S.: the baby boom years.
<h3>Marital Status and Living Arrangements</h3>
<p>In every group, more than 70 percent of adults 55 and older report that their health is good (checking good, very good, or excellent on the survey). The percentage with good health was highest for the women with no biological children.</p>
<ul><li>77 percent: women with no biological children</li> <li>74 percent: biological fathers</li> <li>74 percent: biological mothers</li> <li>72 percent: men with no biological children</li> </ul>
<ul><li>35.6 percent: women with no biological children</li> <li>37.2 percent: men with no biological children</li> <li>38.2 percent: biological fathers</li> <li>39.0 percent: biological mothers</li> </ul>
<ul><li>$173,800: women with no biological children</li> <li>$161,200: biological fathers</li> <li>$132,500: men with no biological children</li> <li>$109,500: biological mothers</li> </ul>
<ul><li> 7.5 percent: biological fathers</li> <li>10.5 percent: biological mothers</li> <li>12.2 percent: women with no biological children</li> <li>12.6 percent: men with no biological children</li> </ul>

<li>The refusal of the mayor of Newport, Delaware to call a female colleague about business speaks to an outdated view of women in the workplace.</li>
<li>Traditionally, a woman's role as a romantic partner and mother have been valued over any other responsibility she might undertake.</li>
<li>A single woman's marital status should not be allowed to affect her access to business communications or any other job-related functions.</li>

<a>physicians may assume that unmarried patients lack the social support</a> necessary to undergo an aggressive treatment, although extensive research shows that
<a>social support is not, in fact, synonymous with marriage</a>. Similarly, popular culture is rife with representations of single adults who desperately want or need a romantic partner, despite growing evidence that
<a>many adults live their best lives solo</a>. The common factor shared by any such bias is the prioritization of

<h1> 3 Secret Strengths of People Who Live Alone </h1>
<h2> People who like living alone have secret strengths that defy stereotypes. </h2>
<li>Many single people have been resilient during the pandemic, perhaps because they’ve already cultivated valuable skills while living alone.</li>
<li>People who live alone have often already found solo activities they enjoy, and they find time alone enriching and restorative.</li>
<li>People who live alone also tend to be skilled at staying connected to their support system, even from afar.</li>

<h3>The Secret Strengths of People Who Live Alone and Like It</h3>
<p>How do solo dwellers live in joyful defiance of all the stereotypes of them as sad and <a>lonely</a> and isolated, especially during a pandemic? I think they have three secret strengths.</p>
<p>1. Some of their favorite activities are solo pursuits. When I researched the pandemic experiences of the single at heart, I <a>found</a> that:</p>
<a>many other studies</a> of single people and people living alone.
<p>All the women in the study in India had a confidant they talked to routinely. “The pandemic, all of them noted, hasn’t changed the way they engage socially,” Samanta reported.</p>
<p>3. Their solitude isn’t scary, it is restorative and enriching. Samanta asked the women living alone if social distancing made them feel lonelier. What they said in response sounded a lot like what the single at heart had told me:</p>
<blockquote> <p>“All of them noted that while they miss going out of their homes, they have always appreciated the ‘solitude’ of living alone. The pandemic has only deepened that experience.”</p> </blockquote>
<p>The women described an experience that was also common to many of the men and women I interviewed: Although they enjoy being with other people, they also truly love coming home to a place of their own. Their solitude is enriching and restorative.</p>

<h1> Why Certain People Just Love Being Single </h1>
<h2> From the perspective of those who actually live it. </h2>
<li>There are many benefits about single life to enjoy, starting with having the freedom to arrange one's life based on one's own priorities.</li>
<li>People who are happily single cherish solitude and use it to restore their energy and pursue their passions. </li>
<li>Happy single people often use their freedom to attend to the people in their lives who matter most.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Krakenimages com/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>people who embrace values </a>such as freedom,
<a>creativity</a>, and trying new things are happier. That’s true for people who are married and people who aren’t. But single people get even more
<a>happiness</a> out of their valuing of freedom than married people do.
<h3>We are more connected—if we want to be.</h3>
<a>are more connected</a> to more different kinds of people. They do more to stay in touch and to be there for the people in their lives. People who move in with a romantic partner or who marry tend to become
<a>more insular</a>, research shows.
<h3>We get to value and prioritize the people we care about.</h3>
<a>value our friends</a>, relatives, mentors, or anyone else who matters to us, then we do. And I mean
<a>deeply value</a>, not just have in our lives in some casual way, though that’s fine, too. And don’t try to tell us that single people cannot be
<a>securely attached</a>; research has demolished that assumption, too.
<h3>We cherish our solitude.</h3>
<a>lonely</a>. But single people who like being single, especially people who are single at heart and love the single life,
<a>embrace solitude</a>. They get a lot out of it. They protect it like the precious resource it is. Maybe that’s why the most sophisticated analyses show that
<a>people who live alone are typically less lonely </a>than people who live with others.
<h3>We figure out how to get things done.</h3>
<a> do so much better</a> than expected.
<h3>We have our happiness, and we value authenticity and psychological richness, too.</h3>
<a>people who marry do not become lastingly happier </a>than they were when they were single. Now there are even more.
<a>psychologically rich life</a>.
<a>benefits and protections</a> given only to people who are legally married. Some people who might like to live single, in some places, face even more formidable obstacles. But by living single when we can, we are living authentically. The
<a>rewards of living authentically</a> may not be material, but they are meaningful and life-enhancing.

<li>A Swiss study found that men who got married were paid 2.6% to 3.5% more, compared to men who stayed single.</li>
<li>Research has shown that married men receive more invitations for job interviews and higher salary offers than single men with identical resumes.</li>

<h1> There Are More Single People Than Ever. Here's Why That's Not a Problem. </h1>
<h2> Happier, more powerful, and less interested in pairing up. </h2>
<p>“Rising share of U.S. adults are living without a spouse or partner,” declared a report just released by the Pew Research Center. The report also documents ways in which single men are falling behind partnered men economically.</p>
<a>singlism</a> (the stereotyping and stigmatizing of single people) and matrimania (the glorifying of
<h3>Half of Unpartnered Americans Are Not Interested in Finding a Partner</h3>
<a>romantic relationship</a>. Based on a national, random sampling of Americans 18 and older, they found that
<a>50 percent of those single people are not interested in a committed romantic relationship, and they are not even interested in a date</a>.
<p>All that hand-wringing about marriageability is of little relevance to people who just aren’t interested in marrying or even <a>dating</a>.</p>
<h3>For Many, Single Life Is a Great Life, Better Than Any Alternative</h3>
<a>single life offers profound rewards</a>, as I described in a recent “Living Single” post.
<h3>Discussions of the Declining Economic Fortunes of Single Men Have Missed Some Important Points</h3>
<a>divorced</a>. Single men tend to put more hours into the kinds of work that has the potential to benefit many other people besides themselves. For example, they give more of their time to farm organizations, unions, and professional societies.

<a>enjoy each other’s company</a>. It’s not the 1970s anymore. And for some groups and in some places, living with parents is highly valued.
<a>teenagers</a> from 10 different kinds of households showed that the teens living with their single mother and at least one grandparent did at least as well as the teens of married parents in graduating from high school, enrolling in college, not
<a>smoking</a>, and not drinking. If their moms had always been single, they tended to do even better than the teens with married parents.
<a>people who live alone can have special strengths</a> that are rarely recognized. For single men especially, who are living alone longer than the men of previous generations, that experience can be
<a>transformational</a>, offering significant payoffs for them later in life.
<h3>The Power of Single People Is Growing</h3>
<a>growing power of single people, in 10 important trends</a>. That rising clout begins with their growing numbers and continues with the ways in which single people, and the important people in their lives, are commanding more positive
<a>attention</a> and more respect. Even a potentially troubling report, such as the recent one from Pew, cannot reverse those trends.

<h1> A New Way to Think About Happy Single People </h1>
<h2> Quirkyalone, self-partnered, solitaries, and more. </h2>
<li>People who are single are used to experiencing stereotyping, stigmatization, and condescension. </li>
<li>One way that they are reclaiming their power is by choosing more empowering terms to describe their single lifestyle.</li>
<li>Some popular positive terms for single people today include Single at Heart, quirkyalone, self-partnered, consciously uncoupled, and solitaries.</li>
<p>At different times and different places, single people—especially women—have been tagged with all sorts of disparaging labels. That continues even now. The term spinster, which some are trying to reclaim, is hardly the worst of it.</p>
<p>What we are seeing now is a proliferation of terms for people who are owning their single lives. They are thriving and proud of themselves. Here are a few examples.</p>
<a>book</a> by the same name. Of quirkyalones, Cagen said, “Romantics, idealists, eccentrics, we inhabit single-dom as our natural resting state... For the quirkyalone, there is no patience for
<a>dating</a> just for the sake of not being alone. We want a miracle. Out of millions, we have to find the one who will understand.”
<a>my doubts about the term</a>, but it was great that the term went viral and inspired endless discussions of single people that renounced that antiquated and embarrassing view that sees them as leading lesser lives.

<a>marriage</a> would not last, she worried about letting people down, especially her children. She wondered, “Was there a world where we could break up and not lose everything? Could we be a family, even though we were not a couple?”
<a>the ones</a>.” Johnson says something similar: “Perhaps that is what defines my solitaries—a reluctance to sacrifice
<a>openness</a> to all for openness to one.”
<p>Whether you favor one of these terms or some other one, I hope that if you love your single life, you will own it. In doing so, you will not only have a happier, more authentic life yourself; you will also be a role model for others.</p>

<h1> Are Romantic Themes in Movies and TV Toxic for Single Women? </h1>
<h2> Watching romantic themes has different implications for single women and men. </h2>
<li>Romantic plots that idealize coupling and marriage are ubiquitous in contemporary movies and TV shows.</li>
<li>Watching romances on-screen tends to reinforce those who are already involved in a committed relationship.</li>
<li>Single women (though not single men) may experience greater anxiety about being single after watching film and TV romances.</li>

<h3>Genuine Helping: Focused on What Is Best for the Disadvantaged Group</h3>
<h3>Morally Motivated Helping</h3>
<p>Morally motivated helping is not aligned with any one political ideology. The authors offer this example:</p>
<h3>Helping That Benefits or Protects the Helper’s Own In-Group</h3>
<p>When people identify strongly with their own advantaged group, they might still want to help a disadvantaged group, but only “on the condition that the status of their own group is maintained.” For example:</p>
<blockquote> <p>“Men might be willing to participate in a Reclaim the Night protest against the violence that women experience, but may not be willing to advocate for equal pay for women in the workplace.”</p> </blockquote>
<p>Helpers with this “ingroup-focused motivation” may be helping disadvantaged groups because that will bolster the reputation of their own advantaged group, perhaps making the members seem warmer and more moral.</p>
<p>People with this motivation often like hierarchical relationships better than equal ones. They are driven by zero-sum beliefs, meaning that they think that if one person gains something, then another person loses.</p>
<h3>Helping That Is Self-Centered, and Maybe Even Narcissistic</h3>
<p>When a member of an advantaged group steps into a disadvantaged group’s protest and grabs the bullhorn, they may be engaging in the kind of grandiose exhibitionism characteristic of narcissists.</p>
<h3>Respectful and Disrespectful Help</h3>
<li>“Listening to and amplifying the voices of the disadvantaged group.</li>
<li>Seeking advice from and following requests made by the disadvantaged group (including stepping back when necessary).</li>
<li>Taking on the role of an ‘accomplice’ or ‘side-kick’ rather than seeking one as a ‘hero’ or ‘champion’ of a movement.”</li>
<p>When people are motivated to protect the interests of their own advantaged group, or when they are motivated by self-centered concerns, they are more likely to help in disrespectful ways. For example:</p>
<li>They don’t ask for guidance from members of the disadvantaged group.</li>
