<p>This is the craziest, creepiest year in both the real and the financial world that I’ve ever seen in my more than 50 years of writing about business. It’s even worse than 2020, which a year ago I called the craziest and creepiest.</p>
<div><p>Portraits from inside the wild, messy, overheating and confounding economy of 2021</p></div>
<div><div><p>But less than a week into the new year, as the <a>Jan. 6 Capitol Hill horror show</a> (for which Trump deserves a lot of blame) struck, any hope of national unity began to disappear, and is now vanishing more rapidly than ever.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Instead of Americans banding together and getting vaccinated with the miracle shots, we’ve got <a>vaccine wars </a>that have become part of our political wars. We’ve got even <a>more divisiveness </a>than we had last year.</p></div>
<a>supply chain disruptions </a>and the disappearance of familiar items from stores; and the spectacle of public figures tearing at each others’ throats are spreading fear and anger throughout the land.
<div><div><p>We’re seeing all this discord even as unemployment is way down from where it was last year and home values and stock prices are both up sharply, greatly increasing our national wealth.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Homeowners are doing great. Shareholders are doing even better.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But<b> </b>economic inequality, which was already serious before this year started, has clearly gotten worse.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>(Since their March 23 bottom last year, stocks then have risen 109 percent, according to the Wilshire 5000, adding about $25.8 trillion in value.)
<div><div><p>This deepens inequality because <a>more than 40 percent of Americans</a> aren’t in the market.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These low rates encourage higher home prices by making mortgages cheaper, which means that buyers can afford to pay a higher purchase price because the low rates hold down their monthly mortgage payments to affordable levels.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Even though the Fed will sharply cut back its trillion-dollar-plus purchases of Treasury securities, I figure those rates will still stay relatively low.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And none of the asset-enhancing benefits of the Fed’s low-rate regime directly help increase the wealth of people who haven’t got much (if anything) in the way of stocks or home equity.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hot economy collides with huge virus in pandemic's latest twist</p></div>
<div><div><p>The one upbeat thing I see is that the rising shortage of workers has led to wage increases, which lots of companies and lots of well-off people are complaining about.</p></div></div>

<div><p>He also told me that the local store that I like so much is likely to close this summer, to be replaced with a fast-food restaurant. However, he said that B N intends to open a new store in the same area. That makes me feel a tad better.</p></div>
<p>And on that note, I wish you and yours a happy, healthy, peaceful and prosperous new year. And let’s hope that by the time year-end 2022 rolls around, today’s traumas, troubles and divisiveness will be history, not current events.</p>

<a><h2>The craziest, creepiest year in the real and financial worlds in my 50 years of writing about business</h2></a>
<p>The economy is going great. Employment is up and so are the stock markets and housing prices, but political divisiveness is undermining everything.</p>

<a><h2>Bookstores are dying. Barnes Noble’s pricing policy may help explain why.</h2></a>
<p>I'm fond of my local Barnes Noble, so I was surprised to see bn.com undercutting prices in the store for some bestselling books — and stunned to see the company allowed pop-up ads from Amazon lowering prices even more.</p>

<p>The White House is strongly considering nominating Sarah Bloom Raskin to become the Federal Reserve’s top banking regulator, and Lisa Cook and Philip Jefferson as Fed governors, according to people familiar with the decision-making process.</p>
<div><div><p>Raskin has a track record for policymaking, having served as deputy secretary of the Obama administration’s Treasury Department from 2014 to 2017. She also served as a governor on the Fed board from 2010 to 2014.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Raskin has also called attention to the risks climate change poses to the financial system and the need for regulators to respond in her more recent work in academia.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden pledged to make the Fed more diverse. His remaining nominations will test that commitment.</p></div>
<a>research</a> has focused on inequality, how business cycles affect poverty rates and the role of education as a shield against unemployment. The Wall Street Journal and

<div><div><p>The complaints topped 700,000 during a period that largely overlapped with the <a>coronavirus</a> pandemic and the economic crisis it precipitated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Complaints to the CFPB about the companies more than doubled from 2019 to 2020, <a>according</a> to Consumer Reports. And more than a third of participants in a study by the publication last year found errors in their credit reports.</p></div>

<a>coronavirus</a> vaccine booster, expanding protection to adolescents and teens as surging
<a> omicron infections</a> threaten to disrupt schools and workplaces across the country.
<b> </b>that echoed the strong language used by many panel members. “I encourage all parents to keep their children up to date with CDC’s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations.”
<a>omicron variant </a>is thought to be less virulent than delta but its high transmissibility has produced many infections, some of which have resulted in severe disease.

<a>authorizing the Pfizer product for 12-to-15-year-olds. </a>
<p>Much of the debate Wednesday by CDC panel members centered on whether to give a full-throated endorsement to booster shots for adolescents by recommending that they <i>should</i> get them, as opposed to recommending they <i>may </i>get them.</p>
<div><div><p>Several panel members supported a strong recommendation for the shots because of the omicron surge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I believe in the vaccine, I believe that it has been safe, I believe that we can prevent serious infection,” said Pablo Sanchez, a pediatrics professor at Ohio State University.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I think we need to highlight that children are not okay,” said Kathy Poehling, a professor of pediatrics at Wake Forest School of Medicine. “Covid is overwhelming our hospitals and our children’s hospitals.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>But as more information emerges on the potential impact of omicron in children, parents’ attitudes toward vaccinating their teenagers and younger children may change, CDC official Sara Oliver said.</p></div></div>
<p>FDA officials have said the agency broadened access to boosters this week because real-world data and laboratory tests indicate the shots significantly strengthen protection, especially against the omicron variant, while posing minimal risk.</p>
<div><div><p>Officials cited data from Israel that found no new safety concerns when more than 6,000 youngsters ages 12 to 15 got a Pfizer booster five months after their second dose. There were no new cases of heart-related complications.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Both the FDA and CDC relied on data from Israel in shortening the interval between the second and third Pfizer shots for adolescents and adults from six months to five months.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Postal Service asks for temporary waiver from Biden vaccine requirement</h1></div>
<h2>In a letter to OSHA, the Postal Service says its ability to deliver the mail would be hurt because employees would either leave over the mandate or be disciplined for disobeying it</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Jacob Bogage</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 7:30 p.m. EST|Updated today at 8:56 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>A vaccine-or-test mandate, he wrote, “is likely to result in the loss of many employees — either by employees leaving or being disciplined.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The mandate takes effect Jan. 10, but OSHA officials have said the agency would not issue citations for violations until Feb. 9.</p></div></div>
<div><p>USPS requests delay of Biden’s vaccine mandate. Read its letter to OSHA.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Vaccines save lives. Sick postal workers, not shots in arms, is what will hurt the Postal Service and customers,” Connolly said in a statement. “Fire DeJoy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A White House spokesperson referred questions to OSHA. Representatives from OSHA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said the Postal Service’s feverishly busy holiday season would prevent the agency of 650,000 employees from timely compliance with the OSHA standards.</p></div></div>
<div><p>CDC advisers recommend Pfizer-BioNTech booster for 12-to-17-year-olds</p></div>
<p>Experts say those reasons may be insufficient to persuade OSHA to grant what’s known as a “variance,” a technical process that requires employers to demonstrate alternative measures that would provide equal workplace protections.</p>
<div><p><span>DeJoy’s USPS slowdown plan will delay the mail. What does it mean for your Zip code?</span></p></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Health</a></div></div><div><h1>About 30 percent of the fully vaccinated in the U.S. have gotten boosted. Omicron could speed things up.</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Paulina Firozi</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Paulina Villegas</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 19, 2021 at 6:46 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<a>according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. More than 54 percent of vaccinated people 65 years and older have gotten a booster, the CDC said.
<div><div><p>The <a>CDC says </a>all adults 18 and older should get a booster, and 16- and 17-year-olds can also get them.</p></div></div>
<a> studies</a> that suggest boosters offer significant protection against
<a>severe disease</a> — that hopefully will compel people to get those shots, El-Sadr said.
<div><div><p>And for those who are still unsure, she said, public health officials should double their efforts to motivate and convey the message that “this is the moment to get it.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>With federal sign-offs, all American adults now eligible for coronavirus vaccine boosters</p></div>
<div><div><p>Limaye said those recommendations need to come not just from the White House but from leaders on both sides of the aisle.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Omicron could redefine ‘fully vaccinated’ to include a booster dose</p></div>
<a>White House briefing</a> on Friday, Anthony S. Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease specialist, said “fully vaccinated plus a boost” offers the best protection against covid-19, the disease the coronavirus causes.
<div><div><p>“It is critical to get vaccinated. If you are vaccinated, it is critical for optimal protection to get boosted,” Fauci said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>He <a>warned</a> Sunday that the nation could see record coronavirus cases as the variant spreads, days after President Biden said that for <a>the unvaccinated</a>, “we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, warned people not to wait to get an extra shot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is the week to do it," he said in a Sunday interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” "Do not wait.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When attention is a “limited resource,” Buttenheim said it helps when messaging from officials and experts aligns with what people are experiencing around them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Everyone is saying this feels like March 2020 or December 2020 again,” she said, noting<a> New York City</a>, where events are shuttering and anxiety is rising as the spread of omicron upends holiday plans.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Fauci warns of record coronavirus cases in U.S. from omicron variant</p></div>
<div><div><p>Still, she stressed that people are in different “info and social bubbles,” and that public health messaging may not be resonating with everyone in the same way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the public health crisis wears on, Buttenheim underlined the fatigue everyone is feeling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Adding to that confusion, El-Sadr said, is that officials have not been clear enough about the limitations of vaccines.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Delaney Williams, a pharmacist in Seattle, a booster was a resource against the virus and anxiety. She got her booster in October, when delta variant cases were surging.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It gave me a lot of peace of mind,” she said. “It felt like a weight was lifted.”</p></div></div>
<p>Williams and her husband, who was vaccinated and scheduled to get his booster, were recently exposed to the coronavirus after a weekend trip. He got infected. She didn’t, even though they were not able to isolate apart from each other.</p>
<div><div><p>“It really is like a no-brainer to me, and I see no downsides to it and only positive things,” she said. “You get to protect yourself, your loved ones and your community.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>English residents who have tested negative on the sixth and seventh days of their self-isolation period can forgo the previously suggested 10-day isolation period, according to Reuters.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The agency told the news outletthat a seven-day isolation period with two negative “lateral flow” results had nearly the same effect on safety as a 10-day period without a negative lateral flow test for two consecutive days.</p></div>
<p>“The new approach reflects latest evidence on how long cases transmit the virus for, and supports essential public services and supply chains over the winter, while still limiting the spread of the virus,” the agency told Reuters.</p>

<div><div><p>“As Oregon prepares for what could be our worst surge in hospitalizations during this pandemic, I know that this is not the beginning of the new year any of us had hoped for,” Brown said in a news release.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>correction</div><p>An earlier version of this report misidentified Larry Krasner's office. He is the Philadelphia district attorney, not the Pennsylvania district attorney. This story has been corrected. </p></div></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stokes is expected to appear in court Jan. 27, when the district attorney’s office will probably inform its final decision to dismiss the matter or retry him, his lawyer Michael Diamondstein said in an interview Monday.</p></div></div>
<p>“He took his first free breaths this afternoon after almost 40 years, and he is very happy and humbled,” Diamondstein said, and added that Stokes’s first wish after being released was to go “get a corned beef hoagie.”</p>
<div><p>Kevin Strickland exonerated after 43 years in one of the longest wrongful-conviction cases in U.S. history</p></div>
<div><p>In 1984, Lee was in prison facing murder and rape charges when he was approached by two homicide detectives who offered him “sex, drugs, and a deal,” in exchange for framing Stokes, according to his testimony in November.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“They said I wouldn’t do no more than two to five, the most seven years,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Lee added that to help persuade him to testify against Stokes, the detectives allowed his girlfriend to meet with him in private at police headquarters. Another time, he said, the detectives provided condoms and a sex worker, he said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The two detectives, Lawrence Gerrard and Ernest Gilbert, have faced allegations of using similar “coercive methods” to obtain false testimonies from witnesses in other cases, court documents show.</p></div></div>
<p>There was no other evidence linking Stokes directly to the crime. A second surviving victim of the shooting attack testified that Stokes was not the shooter. Only one eyewitness said he saw Stokes at the scene holding a gun — but not shooting.</p>
<div><div><p>But during Stokes’s murder trial, Lee surprisingly recanted his testimony — which prosecutors argued was not credible given his own criminal history.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It took decades for Stokes to discover that the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office had prosecuted Lee for falsely accusing him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During the November hearing, Lee, 62, testified that his initial statement given to police and at the preliminary hearing implicating Stokes in Campbell’s murder was false.</p></div></div>
