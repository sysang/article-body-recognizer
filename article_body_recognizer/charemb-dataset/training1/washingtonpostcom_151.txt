<p>“Nobody came, nobody helped, nobody made a video,” he said.</p>
<p>Quintana reported the crime to police, and the suspect has been charged with assault. But many cases never get that far.</p>
<p>Victims from marginalized communities can be reluctant to engage with police because of cultural differences, language barriers or distrust. Even when they do report, proving that they were targeted because of their race is difficult.</p>
<a>the data gap</a>, some Asian American organizations are tracking these incidents on their own.
<a> Stop AAPI Hate</a> launched last March to collect information on suspected cases of racially motivated violence and harassment. It received more than 2,808 self-reported incidents from across the country by year’s end.
<p>Of those incidents, 9 percent were physical assaults and 71 percent were verbal attacks. Among the victims, most were women and about 126 reported being older than 60.</p>
<p> <i>[<a>Negative views of Asian people have risen in both parties</a>]</i> </p>
<p>But some Asian communities suspect the rash of attacks is even worse than data suggests. The tendency to underreport is why Iona Cheng thinks her community in Oakland has become a target.</p>
<p>“They’re attacking Asian women, often for cultural reasons. They don’t speak out. They don’t press charges. They don’t speak English well in some cases,” said Cheng, who is Chinese American.</p>
<p>“I can’t walk outside the door of my house and feel safe,” said Cheng, who added that someone called her “coronavirus” while she was jogging last March in Oakland. “I just feel like that was taken from me.”</p>

<b> </b>And on his way to buying a gun, in the parking lot,
<b> </b>four White men called him and his friend “the coronavirus” and “chinks.”
<p>While in line to buy the firearm, Gee said, he noticed that most of the customers were also Asian.</p>
<p>But he soon started to worry that his purchase was “playing to fear,” ultimately making his community less safe and decided to sell the firearm back.</p>
<p>“If you show up here … expecting violence, that may put you in a certain mind frame, where you may misread a situation and respond to it with violence.”</p>
<p>Local leaders have made similar pleas, including <a>Oakland Police Department Chief LeRonne Armstrong</a> who expressed concern about civilian gun owners creating “unintended victims.”</p>
<p>He held a<a> news conference Feb. 16 after </a>a Chinatown shopkeeper was jailed for allegedly firing his weapon at a man he believed was robbing a woman on the street.</p>
<p>“We don’t want people to fire weapons into our community,” he said. “While we appreciated people’s interest in keeping our community safe, we want them to observe and report.”</p>
<p>“I think a lot of Asian Americans are realizing that the police can only do so much and that the police are not always there to protect us,” Cheng said. “They’re only there to take the report.”</p>
<p> <i>[<a>America on edge: Covid lockdowns, protests and election strife led to record gun sales</a>]</i> </p>
<p>Some law enforcement agencies have been trying to do more. Police departments in San Francisco and New York City have set up task forces to focus on the issue and increased police presence in predominantly Asian neighborhoods.</p>

<div><p>Suspect charged with killing 8 in Atlanta-area shootings that targeted Asian-run spas</p></div>
<div><div><p>For Asian women, the moment felt particularly threatening.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As soon as Crystal Jin Kim heard about the shooting, she reached out to her mother and father, who immigrated to the United States from Korea. In a text, she urged them “to be safe, to be careful, and to pray.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Really, I’m not — I’m very talkative and extroverted,” Kim said. “It’s just people having these assumptions and treating me like a perfect Asian girl. Not even a woman, but a girl.”</p></div>
<div><p>The shootings are not surprising — if you’ve been paying attention, Asian American women say</p></div>
<div><div><p>The shooting made visible the worst-case scenarios many Asians living in the United States had feared. Many sadly expressed a similar sentiment: We knew this was coming.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More than 68 percent of documented reports of anti-Asian <a>harassment and violence</a> since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic have been from women.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never been this afraid to be Asian in America,” said Dorothy Kuo, 38, who attempted to explain to her 6-year-old daughter what had happened in their community.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Shootings put focus on year of heightened anti-Asian violence in the West</p></div>
<div><p>“I told her ‘Mommy is having a hard time focusing today because last night there were eight people killed.’ I just told her, honestly, what happened,” said Kuo, who is Korean American, like several of the victims.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Kuo said she felt it was important to tell her daughter so she understands the world she’s stepping into, one in which she might have to be more careful as an Asian woman.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve been refused seating at a restaurant,” Kuo said, “and even then I’ve never felt what I feel now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jane Kim Coloseus, 32, grew angry Wednesday when Atlanta police declared it was too soon to say whether the slayings were racially motivated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Advocates for Asian Americans demand action: ‘Everyone has heard enough words’</p></div>
<div><div><p>“To me the equation is pretty straightforward,” she said of the shooter’s intent. “It is racially motivated.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Novak Djokovic is desperate to be taken seriously. Now he’s becoming a punchline.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Feinstein</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 10:42 a.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 4:19 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Novak Djokovic is the No. 1 men’s tennis player in the world and may end up the greatest male player of all time. There are some who think he’s already there.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a>, and Antonio Brown
<a>took it a step further</a> when he submitted a fake vaccination card.
<div><div><p>But neither of them were detained by border officials in Australia and <a>held in a hotel</a> as a court weighs deportation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like Rodgers and Brown, Djokovic <a>got himself into an embarrassing mess</a> because he thought he was above the rules of covid decency and refused to get a vaccination that most people understand they need.</p></div></div>
<a>had announced Djokovic was being granted a medical exemption,</a> allowing him to compete in the tournament even though he is apparently unvaccinated.
<div><p>Nadal says Djokovic knew the risks in Australia: ‘If you are vaccinated, you can play’</p></div>
<a>still recovering from knee surgery</a>. Whether he will play again — much less contend for another major title — is in doubt. Nadal is 35 and will play in Australia, but Djokovic
<a>beat him in Paris last spring</a>, an almost unthinkable upset given that Nadal has won the French Open 13 times.
<a>at Wimbledon</a> and came within a whisker of being the third man in history to win a calendar Grand Slam when he reached the U.S. Open final,
<a>only to lose to Daniil Medvedev</a>.
<div><div><p>Still, it felt as if the ­34-year-old’s coronation was little more than a formality, especially with Australia — his “home court” — next up. But Djokovic found a way to mess it up.</p></div></div>
<a>was gone before the end of the first week</a>.
<div><div><p>In short, if you believe Djokovic wasn’t granted a special privilege, Tiley has some oceanfront land in the Outback he would like to sell you.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison clearly didn’t believe Tiley.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No hedging there.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From 2015: How great does Novak Djokovic have to be to be fully appreciated?</p></div>
<div><div><p>At his best, Djokovic is smart and thoughtful and — in my opinion — likable. At his worst, he is bafflingly stupid for someone who is clearly bright.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sadly, this is not unusual for tennis, which has about a dozen ruling bodies, all of which manage to do a lousy job of running the sport. When everyone claims to be in charge, no one is.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No one has worked harder than Djokovic to be taken seriously as a great champion. Now he has become a sad joke.</p></div></div>
<p>Tennis star <a>Novak Djokovic is facing deportation</a> after his travel visa for Australia was canceled.</p>
<p>Djokovic, whose vaccination status is unknown, arrived in Melbourne with a medical exemption to the <a>mandatory coronavirus vaccination</a> to compete in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>News of Djokovic’s vaccine exemption was <a>met with skepticism and pushback</a> from other quarters in the sport.</p>
<p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier that Djokovic would be “on the next plane home” if the tennis star could not prove why he needed an <a>exemption from getting vaccinated</a>.</p>
<p>The world No. 1 men’s tennis star is now <a>reportedly being held at a hotel</a> used to house asylum seekers as his lawyers lodge an appeal.</p>

<a><h2>First lab results show omicron has ‘much more extensive escape’ from antibodies than previous variants</h2></a>
<p>The study, released Tuesday, found that even if the power of vaccines is diminished in the face of omicron, there’s still some protection afforded against the virus.</p>

<a>344 potential single-point failures </a>on this complex mission.
<div><div><p>The mission has had a couple of hiccups.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All the major deployments to date — including that of the solar arrays needed to power the observatory — have gone splendidly, Durning said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am thrilled,” he said. “I’ve been on the job 15 years. To see it unfurl in space, it’s awe-inspiring.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the sun shield deployment was complete Tuesday, he texted a postscript: “15 years of anticipation of this moment and it did not disappoint.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Webb, and the Webb Team, is doing great on deployments!” Garth Illingworth, an astronomer at the University of California at Santa Cruz, said by email early Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are not out of the woods yet for JWST, but we have made wonderful progress. Kudos to the amazing engineers!” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Keith Parrish, observatory manager for the telescope at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., said: “We’ll take each of our deployments as a touchdown. But the game is still going.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>On the first morning of the new year, Andrew Koch was working at his computer in Pittsburgh when a thunder-like sound rumbled through his home.</p></div></div>
<p>He felt it in his chest more than he heard it, Koch said Tuesday. Only after Allegheny County, Pa., tweeted that there was “no explanation” for the loud noise did he check whether his home security cameras had captured the boom.</p>
<div><div><p>“If it had been clear, there would have been something 100 times brighter than the full moon moving from north to south in the Pittsburgh sky,” Cooke said. “That would have been pretty cool to see.”</p></div></div>
<a>Puerto Rico</a> and beyond in recent years. The most recent fireball prompted joking comparisons to the new film “Don’t Look Up,” which features astronomers
<a>trying to warn the world</a> about a comet streaking toward Earth and satirizes indifference to climate change.
<div><div><p>“The Netflix marketing budget for Don’t Look Up is out of control,” <a>one person tweeted</a> in response to the New Year’s Day bolide.</p></div></div>
<div><p>NASA hopes to hit an asteroid now in case we really need to knock one away later</p></div>
<div><div><p>When the scientists saw that an infrasound station had recorded noise around the same time as the Geostationary Lightning Mapper, the mystery appeared to be solved.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It left no doubt that what was located over western Pennsylvania on New Year’s Day was a bolide breaking apart,” Cooke said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>While meteor explosions tend to prompt fears of falling, flaming rocks, Cooke said damage caused by the blast’s pressure is a much more realistic concern. Movies about meteor explosions, he added, are usually not accurate.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But Cooke said he can’t speak to the specific imagery in “Don’t Look Up,” which is streaming on Netflix. He hasn’t seen it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Rocks falling out of the sky, that’s work,” Cooke said. “So I wait for it to come on cable.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the health-care policy debate in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Roubein</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>Today at 8:13 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s according to an investigation by The Post detailing the attack. If you're on the Hill today, check out the series in print: it will be inserted into 2,700 copies of the newspaper delivered to Capitol Hill offices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Today, in health care news:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>‘Surprise’ medical bills are now illegal</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Consumer alert: Patients can no longer get hit with pricey surprise medical bills — the beginning of a major consumer protection Congress passed back in 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Kaiser Family Foundation</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Spreading the word</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Providers are no longer allowed to send eye-popping bills to insured patients who inadvertently get care from an out-of-network provider. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s really going to be critical that the public’s aware of their rights,” said Jane Sheehan, the director of federal relations at Families USA, a consumer health advocacy group.</p></div></div>
<li>Sheehan teased an upcoming public education campaign but declined to share details.</li>
<li>Before the law took effect, the federal health department conducted trainings about the ban with consumer advocates, unions, providers, legal aid organizations and more.</li>
<li>Groups, like the American Hospital Association, say they’ve discussed the ban extensively with their members and are holding office hours to answer questions on certain facets of the law.</li>
<div><ul><li>“Doctor offices are running businesses, and insurance companies are large regulated businesses, they both have pretty strong incentives not to run afoul of the law,” he said. </li></ul></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Looming</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Though the law is in effect, the fight isn’t over. Major hospital, doctor and air ambulance lobbies sued the administration over its surprise billing rules late last year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The move is reminiscent of the fiery debate in Congress over how to resolve payment disputes between providers and insurers, as powerful health care giants poured millions into avoiding picking up the bulk of the tab. </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>“As an advocate, I think that that’s an unacceptable half measure,” said James Gelfand, an executive vice president of the ERISA Industry Committee, which represents large employers.</li></ul></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The CDC says all teens should get boosted</div></h4></div></div>
<p>Advisers weigh in: Earlier Wednesday, advisers to the CDC voted 13 to 1 to recommend a Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine booster for all teenagers. The vote came after the FDA cleared an additional dose for kids ages 12 to 15 on Monday. </p>
<div><div><h4><div>More fallout from the CDC’s isolation guidance</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>The AMA's position: The massive doctor lobby pointed out that the CDC’s own rationale for the change notes that some 31 percent of people may remain contagious after the fifth day following a positive test.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Walensky on Wednesday denied that testing shortages were a motivating factor in the CDC's decision to omit a testing requirement for leaving isolation.</p></div></div>
<li>Repercussions for workers: Walmart announced that it was cutting the amount of paid leave that workers can receive after testing positive for the coronavirus from two weeks to one week, following the CDC’s new isolation guidance.</li>
<div><div><p>Here's what else you need to know: </p></div></div>
<li>The Capitol Police chief says the coronavirus is hitting the department hard and exacerbating personnel shortages, according to our colleague Andrew Jeong.</li>
<li>The world needs 22 billion more mRNA vaccine doses to protect vulnerable populations worldwide and tamp down on new variants, according to a new report prepared by a team of public health advocates and scientists, our colleague Dan Diamond writes.</li>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Mark Zandi</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>House prices are sizzling. Not just in swanky neighborhoods in the nation’s big cities or in resort towns. Not just in the suburbs or exurbs. Not just in inner cities or in rural areas. Just about everywhere.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, are we in another housing bubble?</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Zandi: The conundrum affordable housing poses for the nation</p></div>
<div><div><p>No. Not yet. But I say this with less confidence than I did a year ago, and if current trends continue for another year, I won’t be saying it at all.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Zandi: What actions can policymakers take to avert the brewing national housing crisis?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Based on these tried-and-true measures of house-price valuation, homes nationwide appear overvalued by as much as 15 percent, and in much of the South and West they are overvalued by more than 20 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Zandi: Housing market could shift under new tax law</p></div>
<div><div><p>Having said this, competition is heating up in the mortgage market, which in times past has driven lenders to ease their lending standards.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The script on house prices is still being written. The most graceful scenario is for prices to cool off, go more-or-less sideways, and allow incomes, rents and construction costs to catch up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the price declines won’t be broad-based. The stronger job market will forestall foreclosures and distressed sales, and the housing shortage will put a proverbial floor under prices in many communities.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We should know soon which scenario will unfold.</p></div></div>
