<p>A video of a person claiming they had an interaction with a transphobic baby has gone viral on social media. The video has so far amassed nearly 200,000 views and has left viewers confused as to whether the video is genuine or satire.</p>
<p>The video was first posted on right-wing Twitter page Teachers_Exposed on Monday December 28. The video was posted with the caption: "'Transphobic baby', this preschool teacher came to the conclusion that one of her students is transphobic."</p>
<p>In the video they said: "I have talked about the transphobic baby at work before.</p>
<p>"I went in a room with him today and I had my wig on which I took off now because it is like 9 o'clock at night.</p>
<p>"He didn't cry and he was sort of babbling at me. I had a look at him and do you like me now because we have had a moment or do you like me now because I have long hair and look more feminine.</p>
<p>"Because then you are more transphobic, then he started to cry so that was my answer."</p>
<p>The video has since been widely shared across social media since being posted by another right-wing Twitter account, Libs of Tik Tok, where the post has garnered over 185,000 views and 1,000 retweets.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted the Teachers Exposed Twitter account for further information.</p>

<p>Ghislaine Maxwell being found guilty on Jeffrey Epstein-related sex-trafficking charges will prevent <a>Prince Andrew</a> from calling her as a witness, a royal author told Newsweek.</p>
<p>The British socialite's conviction also affects the evidence in the Duke of York's own civil lawsuit, in which he is accused of rape, according to biographer Nigel Cawthorne.</p>
<p>Virginia Giuffre says she was forced to have sex with <a>Queen Elizabeth II</a>'s son by Maxwell and Epstein, fearing death if she refused.</p>
<p>Within her complaint, she submitted a now famous photograph of the prince with his arm around her, which she says was taken in Maxwell's London townhouse on the night she first met the duke in 2001.</p>
<p>Standing and smiling in the background is Maxwell herself, a long-standing friend of the prince.</p>
<p>Cawthorne told Newsweek: "The verdict does not help Prince Andrew at all in the court of public opinion. The famous picture is now seen in a whole new light.</p>
<p>"Now we have <a>Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, sex trafficker, standing there next to a woman who says she was trafficked, next to Prince Andrew who says he wasn't there.</p>
<p>"If Maxwell was acquitted that would have helped him, indeed they could have called her as a defense witness.</p>
<p>"Things are looking a bit more bleak for him now."</p>
<p>Prince Andrew is currently attempting to get the case thrown out, including by arguing that the <a>court doesn't have jurisdiction</a> because Giuffre is a resident in Australia, not America.</p>
<p>However, if the case does go ahead, Giuffre's lawyers have indicated they may call on his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, or <a>even a member of the royal family</a>, for depositions.</p>
<p>David Boies, her attorney, told The Daily Beast that <a>Meghan Markle</a> and <a>Prince Charles</a> were both possible targets to be deposed.</p>
<p>He said: "She [Meghan] is somebody we can count on to tell the truth."</p>
<p>He added: "We would likely take one or two depositions of people close to Andrew who would have knowledge of his actions.</p>
<p>"That might include his ex-wife. It could possibly be his brother."</p>
<p>Cawthorne told Newsweek the Maxwell verdict would also heap extra pressure on Queen Elizabeth II, who has reportedly been paying Andrew's legal costs.</p>
<p>He said: "It must be a worry for his mother who is looking forward to her Platinum Jubilee next year.</p>
<p>"This certainly isn't helpful. If the case isn't thrown out on January 4, there's talk of deposition being requested from Prince Charles, which would be interesting."</p>
<p>Joseph Kotrie-Monson, a U.K. criminal lawyer of Mary Monson Solicitors, recently told LBC members of the royal family were unlikely to have meaningful evidence to offer.</p>
<p>"Embarrassment, intimidation threat of shame, increased publicity. These are all things in the arsenal of the stereotypical litigation lawyer which have no legal baring but can be tactically effective in the obtaining of large settlements."</p>
<p>U.K. political interviewer Andrew Neil told his 1.1 million <a>Twitter</a> followers: "Will Maxwell now start to name names in Epstein's evil work to reduce sentence? Some wonder why she hasn't done this already as plea bargain with feds.</p>
<p>"So are we to believe that Maxwell pimped only for Epstein? That some of powerful people who flew on Lolita Express, stayed on his island, visited his various homes etc did not also behave illegally with young girls the way he did?"</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a>'s first year in office, a rise his two most recent predecessors also experienced. The number is about 12 percent greater than the
<a>47,600 opioid overdose deaths</a> that the CDC said were reported in 2017 when former President
<a>Donald Trump</a> was serving his first year in office. The number of deaths reported so far in 2021 is also more than three times the
<a>15,597 deaths</a> reported to the CDC for 2009 during former President
<a>Barack Obama</a>'s first year in office alongside then-Vice President Biden.
<p>About 75 percent of the overdose deaths reported between April 2020 and April 2021 were opioid-related, the CDC said.</p>
<p>Biden called the data a "tragic milestone" in a statement released by the White House following the CDC's report.</p>
<p>"As we continue to make strides to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot overlook this epidemic of loss, which has touched families and communities across the country," Biden said.</p>
<div> News Oregon <a>Johnson Johnson</a></div>
<p>Oregon is set to join the $26 billion settlement with the three largest opioid distributors and drugmaker Johnson Johnson after arguments over disbursement, the state's attorney general said Monday.</p>
<p>The state had argued with cities and counties over Oregon's share of the expected $329 million and how much should go toward attorney fees. However, now an agreement is "imminent," Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum said.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' attorneys said that as of a week ago, a minimum of 45 states had signed onto the settlement or showed their intent to and at least 4,012 cities and counties affirmed their participation.</p>
<p>The settlement would be the second-biggest in U.S. history and tackle damage inflicted by opioids.</p>
<p>The Oregon decision was applauded by plaintiffs' attorneys, who have worked the settlement on the national level and advised cities, counties, and states to sign it.</p>
<p>Rosenblum said the agreement still needs to be formally approved by city councils and county commissions in Oregon to be final.</p>
<p>In exchange for the payout, participating states, counties, and cities would have to drop any lawsuits against the defendants and agree not to sue them in the future for the opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson has called the settlement "woefully insufficient." Instead of joining, he sued AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson for $38 billion.</p>
<p>According to Rosenblum's office, the agreement between the state and local governments says:</p>
<p>— The remaining 55 percent of Oregon's share would go directly to cities and counties to pay for prevention, treatment, and recovery services at the local level.</p>
<p>The settlement is second only to the $200 billion-plus tobacco settlement, in 1998, with the nation's four largest tobacco companies.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </p>
<p>A Tennessee state employee filed a lawsuit against the state after his public records request for the state's COVID-19 response report was denied.</p>
<p>Thomas Wesley, a state employee, filed a public records request to gain access to a government report that showed a recommendation on how the state should respond to the COVID-19 pandemic but his request was denied.</p>
<p>The Public Citizen Litigation Group helped Wesley file a lawsuit against the state's Department of Human Services for its decision to deny his request, said Wendy Liu, an attorney with the group.</p>
<p>Wesley's attorneys argued the report doesn't meet the exemption requirements because it's a final report and "does not reflect conversations or deliberations among high government."</p>
<p>Even if the COVID-19 report contained "operational vulnerabilities," the state would still be required to redact the sensitive information and hand over the report, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The report was prepared by McKinsey Co at the request of Governor Bill Lee's administration.</p>
<p>Additionally, the lawsuit says the "operational vulnerabilities" exception is meant to apply to the state's computer systems or technical networks.</p>
<p>Lee's office regularly cites deliberative process to exclude certain documents when producing records requested by the Associated Press, often when it comes to communications of members of his team.</p>
<p>"In my view, this particular governor's admin has used this exemption more aggressively than other administrations," Fisher added.</p>
<p>At the same time, he's also faced criticism from Republicans who are unhappy the governor issued any sort of restrictions early on in the pandemic.</p>
<p>McKinsey's work has been at the center of debate over the Lee administration's no-bid contracting during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Lee, a first-time politician, vowed to make government more transparent when he took over the top elected office in 2019.</p>
<p>However, the governor has not yet followed through on a promise to overhaul Tennessee's public records and open meeting laws that he initially promised during his transition.</p>
<div> News Court <a>Idaho</a> <a>Opioid</a></div>
<p>Local governments in Idaho agreed to join the state in the nationwide $26 billion opioid settlement, and now the state could potentially get up to $119 million from the settlement.</p>
<p>The state previously joined the settlement back in August and could have received a minimum of $64 million from the settlement.</p>
<p>However, Governor Brad Little and Wasden opened up the settlement and allowed for local governments to join. After they accepted, the settlement increased, and the state could now receive up to $119 million.</p>
<p>"This level of participation shows the strong commitment of both the state and local governments to work together to obtain the most money to fight the opioid epidemic in Idaho," Wasden said in a statement.</p>
<p>For the settlement, Johnson Johnson would pay Idaho $22 million over nine years. The three other drug distributors would pay $98 million to the state over the 18 years.</p>
<p>At least 40 percent of the money would go to the cities and counties, 40 percent would go to the state's opioid settlement fund, and the remaining 20 percent would go to the regional public health districts, according to the agreement.</p>
<p>"The opioid crisis is taking lives and destroying families in Idaho," Little said in June 2019 when he signed an executive order to combat opioid and substance misuse by establishing the Opioid Advisory Group to examine strategies.</p>
<p>A settlement has not been reached with Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin and the company most closely associated with opioids.</p>
