<h1> The Mental-Health Pros and Cons of Marijuana Use </h1>
<h2> The research on regular teenage use is especially troubling. </h2>
<li>The evolving legalization of marijuana brings up many unresolved questions for psychiatrists and other mental health professionals.</li>
<li>There are definite medicinal benefits of marijuana but its use should be guided by trained medical and mental health professionals.</li>
<li>The negative cognitive effects are especially worrisome among adolescents and young adults due to possible irreversible effects.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Cottonbro/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>psychiatric</a> medications the patients were taking. To complicate matters even further, no one really knew how marijuana interacted with many of these other medications. Overall effects on sleep, mood, and
<a>anxiety</a> were difficult to assess given this complexity.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Rolf Hansen/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>PTSD</a>), multiple sclerosis (MS), glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, and some forms of epilepsy. There is even some
<a>neuroscientist</a> Gary Wenk suggesting that marijuana could help prevent memory loss in aging by reducing inflammation in the brain.
<a>are now seeking help</a> with chronic medical conditions and the anxiety that comes along with aging.
<a>recent study out of New Zealand, </a>concluded that for those who begin to use marijuana regularly in their early teens, there can be
<a>long-term memory</a> impairment with a lowering of
<a>IQ</a>, poor job and academic performance, and greater risk of depression later on in adulthood. Individuals from traumatic backgrounds are at higher risk of developing this pattern and are
<a>four to seven times more likely</a> to become dependent on alcohol, marijuana, and other drugs.
<a>paranoia</a>, and apathy. Probably due to the higher potency of THC in marijuana today compared to the 1960s,
<a>there is a greater risk of it triggering psychosis, even in those without a genetic predisposition of schizophrenia. </a>
<a>vaping</a> and the stress of the COVID pandemic.
<p>Last, there are the documented <a>harmful health effects of smoking marijuana </a>such as an increase in bronchitis and other chronic lung conditions. </p>
<h3>Psychiatry’s Role in the Debate</h3>
<a>addiction</a>, poor academic performance, and motor vehicle accidents?
<a>CBD</a>, understanding possible harmful drug interactions, and using it safely to avoid abuse and dependency. Marijuana will have to be moved from a Schedule I to Schedule II drug so that the necessary research can be performed on humans.
<a>education</a>, and caution. Many parents wrongly feel that marijuana carries a much lower risk than alcohol and may adopt a casual, laissez-faire attitude when advising their kids.

<p>We might wish to forget that our illness is not going away. In a culture that values a quick fix, taking medication for the rest of our lives can be a reminder that there is no cure for us—only “living with." </p>
<p>We might wish to forget that we ultimately are responsible for our own care. The demands of this care can feel burdensome, and there may be a wish that a <a>caretaker</a> figure would relieve us of these demands.</p>
<p>Conversely, we might wish to forget that medical care can make us feel passive. We may chafe under doctors telling us what to do and how to do it.</p>

<h1> Acupuncture May Reduce Inflammation via Vagus Nerve Pathways </h1>
<h2> Acupuncture's anti-inflammatory powers may be driven by the vagal-adrenal axis. </h2>
<li>Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique used to treat chronic pain and illnesses associated with systemic inflammation. </li>
<li>Eastern medicine views acupuncture as a way to redirect the flow of "life force" or vital "Qi energy" along meridian pathways within the body.</li>
<li>Western medical researchers recently identified how acupuncture triggers an anti-inflammatory response via autonomic vagus nerve pathways.</li>

<a>nervous system</a> in ways that can reduce systemic inflammation.
<p>For the past few years, a team of researchers at Harvard Medical School (HMS) led by Qiufu Ma has been conducting experiments in mice designed to elucidate the neuroanatomical underpinnings of acupuncture's anti-inflammatory effects.</p>
<h3>How Was Acupuncture First Used?</h3>
<p>Acupuncture techniques were first described in written texts about 2,121 years ago and were practiced for centuries in Asia before being embraced by Western practitioners of integrative medicine.</p>
<p>Through the lens of Western medicine, the push-pull dynamics between the parasympathetic ("rest and digest") branch and the sympathetic ("fight or flight") branch can be viewed as a type of yin-yang interaction within our autonomic nervous system.</p>
<a>vagus nerve</a> stimulation (VNS) is a well-established way to activate the parasympathetic nervous system in ways that counteract fight-or-flight
<a>stress</a> responses. (See, "
<a>Vagus Nerve Stimulation via the Outer Ear Takes Center Stage.</a>")
<div> <div> <div>This medically accurate illustration shows how the vagus nerve (CN X) wanders throughout the body. Vagus means "wandering" in Latin. Vagal means "relating to the vagus nerve."</div> <div>Source: SciePro/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div>
<h3>Acupuncture Activates Inflammation-Regulating Pathways via the Vagus Nerve</h3>
<a>Torres-Rosas et al., 2014</a>) which found that using electroacupuncture to stimulate the vagal-adrenal axis alleviated systemic inflammation in mice. His curiosity was "further intensified" by research (
<a>Koopman et al., 2016</a>) published in PNAS by Kevin Tracey and colleagues at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research showing that vagus nerve stimulation tames inflammatory responses and lessens rheumatoid arthritis symptoms in humans. (See, "
<a>Vagus Nerve Stimulation Dramatically Reduces Inflammation</a>.")
<a>Liu et al., 2020</a>) were published in the peer-reviewed journal Neuron. In a follow-up study (
<p>Although these vagal-adrenal axis acupuncture studies were done using mouse models, Ma clarifies that "the basic organization of neurons is likely evolutionarily conserved across mammals, including humans."</p>
<p>That said, more research is needed. The next step for Ma and his colleagues is to conduct human experiments to see if our vagal-adrenal axis responds to electroacupuncture in the same ways they've observed using animal models.</p>

<h2>How a Holiday Letter From the Chronically Ill Might Read</h2>
<p>I’ve received several holiday cards from family and friends that include a letter catching me up their news from the past year. My holiday letter would read quite differently.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>What the Pandemic Taught Me to Appreciate</a></h2> <p>Life seemed to change for the worse when the pandemic hit but, upon reflection, here are four things I’ve learned to be thankful for.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>10 Stressful Thinking Patterns, and How to Reverse Them</a></h2> <p>I often shake my head in amazement at the crazy stuff that goes on in my mind. I’ll say to myself: “This mind can be so unreasonable! So outrageous!" </p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>5 Habits of Mind That Tend to Make Life Harder </a></h2> <p>Whenever you’re feeling stressed and uneasy, it’s usually because you’re caught in the web of one or more of these unskillful habits of mind. </p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>The Perils of Tying Happiness to Getting Your Way</a></h2> <p>The belief that the key to happiness is getting our way sets us up for dissatisfaction with our lives. One reason for this is that most of our desires go unfulfilled. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>4 Things the Chronically Ill Wish Others Understood</a></h2> <p>One of the difficulties of having chronic illness or pain is that the people in our lives don’t understand what we’re going through. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>20 Tips From 20 Years Sick: Tips 11 to 20</a></h2> <p>When I started writing this blog in 2011, I wrote “10 Tips from 10 Years Sick." I assumed that, by 2021, I'd have recovered from what seemed to be a routine virus.</p> </div>
<h2><a>20 Tips: Making the Best of 20 Years of Chronic Pain and Illness</a></h2>
<p>Ten years ago, I posted “10 Tips from 10 Years Sick” but thought that, by 2021, I’d have recovered from what appeared to be a routine viral infection.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>5 Reasons Why Chronic Pain and Illness Are Energy Drains</a></h2> <p>The chronically ill spend a good part of most days contemplating this kind of thing: “If I do this, then I can’t do that.”</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Marking 10 Years at Psychology Today</a></h2> <p>It’s hard for me to believe, but this is my 271st piece. I thought I’d celebrate 10 years at Psychology Today by sharing some of my personal favorites.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>5 Seldom-Recognized Consequences of Living With Chronic Pain</a></h2> <p>Because these little-understood consequences of chronic pain are currently taking center stage in my life, I’m hoping to raise awareness about them.</p> </div>
<h2><a>2021 New Year’s Reflections Inspired by Four Haiku Poems </a></h2>
<p>I hope you’ll take the time to think about the good things that happened in 2020. The good is always there; sometimes we have to stop and consciously call it to mind.</p>
<h2><a>3 Ways to Cope With Isolation in This Unique Holiday Season</a></h2>
<p>The next few weeks, many of us will be facing isolation and loneliness due to the need to stay safe during the pandemic. Here's some help easing emotional pain during the holidays.</p>
<h2><a>Thanksgiving 2020: Finding Gratitude Despite the Pandemic</a></h2>
<p>If gratitude is hard for you to find this difficult Thanksgiving, look around and see if you can find one or two small things that might help you feel good about your life as is. </p>
<h2><a>Creating a Fulfilling Life for Your Chronically Ill Child</a></h2>
<p>When children feel healthy, there are so many activities and events they can plan or attend. However, if they are chronically ill, it’s a different world, with a new set of rules.</p>
<div> <h2><a>6 Ways to Handle the Stigma of Chronic Pain and Illness</a></h2> <p>This culture does a poor job of educating people about chronic pain and illness. They're seen as aberrations instead of natural aspects of the human condition. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>What to Do When Life Takes an Unexpected Turn—as It Just Has</a></h2> <p>We’re in the midst of a change in our lives that’s so profound, none of us could have imagined it a year ago. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>10 Challenges Faced by Those With Chronic Pain and Illness</a></h2>
<p>Be careful not to glorify the past by thinking that before chronic illness (or this pandemic), you could do whatever you wanted, whenever you wanted. No one can.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>How to Stay at Home</a></h2> <p>Staying at home for an extended period of time is not very fun, but it doesn’t have to be a miserable experience. You have the skills to make it easier to live this way.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>19 Tips From 19 Years Sick </a></h2> <p>#1: Don’t underestimate the effect of sheltering-in-place on your symptoms.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Be Your Own Best Friend by Changing Your Negative Self-Talk</a></h2> <p>Negative self-talk is a habit. The good news is that we can change our habits.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>6 Suggestions for Making the Most of “Sheltering in Place” </a></h2> <p>If you’re new to sheltering in place, try these ideas, which come from my years of doing the same.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Two Mindfulness Practices to Help Cope With COVID-19</a></h2>
<p>If you truly understand the fruitlessness of living in a constant state of "want/don’t-want mind" when it comes to this virus, your anger and fear will start to subside.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>My Most Popular Posts From 9 Years Here</a></h2> <p>I always celebrate my anniversary of writing for "Psychology Today" with a post that offers some of my past pieces for reading (or re-reading). </p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Don’t Feel Bad About Feeling Bad</a></h2>
<p>When a painful emotion arises, it arises, and telling yourself that you shouldn’t feel that way doesn’t work. If sadness is there, it’s there. If worry is there, it’s there.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How to Help Manage Your Everyday Fears</a></h2> <p>Everyday fear is closely allied with worry. You can learn to not be a prisoner of fear.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>5 Stages Experienced by Those with Chronic Illness </a></h2> <p>Not everyone will go through these stages in the same way or in the same order, but I’m confident that they will sound familiar.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Equanimity: The Key to Happiness</a></h2> <p>Equanimity is an even-tempered state of mind that enables you to ride life’s challenges with calmness and serenity, instead of being tossed about like a ship in a storm. </p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Handling the Disappointment and Hurt of Being Told “No”</a></h2> <p>It doesn't feel good to be turned down after asking for help, whatever the circumstance. Here are four ideas for handing your disappointment.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>5 Things to Try When You’re Frustrated</a></h2> <p>Frustration serves no useful purpose. Quite the opposite: It clouds the mind, making it hard to see if there’s constructive action you could take.</p> </div> </div>

<p>Dear Family and Friends,</p>
<p>You might even know someone who has what they’re now calling Long COVID. Some of their symptoms are eerily similar to those I’ve been living with ever since I contracted a viral infection in 2001—yes, that long ago.</p>
<a>laughing</a>. This is the nature of invisible pain and invisible illness: what you see does not reflect how a person feels.
<a>envy</a> and resentment about my limitations during the holidays. One result of having done this is that I genuinely want all of you to have a wonderful time as if you’re having fun for me.
<p>With love and the wish that this holiday season is one of peace and joy for you.</p>
