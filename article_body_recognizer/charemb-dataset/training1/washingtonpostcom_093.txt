<div><div><p>Although both are out because of health issues, the greatest impact throughout the season has been created in the interior of Washington’s line, with Allen and defensive tackle Daron Payne.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rivera has praised the improvement of Allen’s game, most notably his hump move, in which he leverages his outside arm under the armpit of a blocker to essentially toss him to the side.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Allen’s success through his first four seasons in Washington landed him a new contract: a four-year, $72 million deal he signed just before the start of training camp in late July.</p></div></div>
<p>“It’s hard for me to be all-in on a team but also be negotiating against them,” he said. “That was hard for me to do. So I’m glad we were able to get it done before the season so I could just be all-in.”</p>

<h1>Daniel Snyder pledged support for the NFL’s investigation. His actions tell a different story. </h1>
<h2>Washington’s owner took former employees to court, deployed private investigators and was accused of trying to ‘silence’ a key accuser</h2>

<b> </b>allegation of sexual misconduct against team owner Daniel Snyder.
<b> </b>denied the woman’s claims. But the existence of an allegation against him, which had been kept secret by a confidential $1.6 million settlement, had the potential to rock a franchise already reeling from scandal.
<b> </b>A few weeks later, Wilkinson sought to interview the former team employee who had made the accusation, according to people familiar with the investigation.
<div><div><p>Then Snyder and his team stepped in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Snyder’s attorneys, in their own sealed letter filed in court, denied trying to block the interview and offering the woman more money, according to people familiar with that letter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Snyder declined an interview request. Lawyers representing Snyder and the team declined interview requests.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Daniel Snyder pushed back as the NFL probed. Here are takeaways from The Post’s reporting.</p></div>
<a> The Post story that prompted Wilkinson’s investigation</a>, his lawyers filed petitions in federal court seeking,
<b> </b>to identify former employees who had spoken to The Post — an effort one federal judge suggested was intended “to burden and harass” former employees who had spoken to reporters.
<b> </b>according to these former employees or their attorneys
<b> </b>— acts many of them viewed as intimidation aimed at discouraging former employees from participating in the NFL’s investigation.
<b> </b>intended to speak to Wilkinson —
<div><p>More than a dozen women allege sexual harassment and verbal abuse by former team employees at Redskins Park</p></div>
<a> the Ray Rice domestic violence </a>case and
<a>the release of executive findings</a>.
<b> </b>secretive handling of the Washington investigation, which has spared Snyder from any public punishment, has
<div><p>But among former team employees, it has not escaped notice that the emails spared Snyder any embarrassment while damaging the reputation of one of his perceived enemies: Bruce Allen, the longtime team president Snyder fired in 2019.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Allen declined to comment.<b> </b>The NFL also declined to comment or to answer any questions about the investigation and its handling of the emails that were leaked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s very sad and disheartening that [the NFL is] not willing to do the right thing,” said Rachel Engleson, a former team marketing director.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Here’s this billionaire owner,” she said of Snyder, “who can do anything he wants.”</p></div></div>
<a>The Post reported on it and the confidential settlement last December</a>. Even then, the details were scarce: a private plane ride, an allegation, a denial, an investigation, a payout.
<p>The woman reported her allegations to David Donovan, then the team’s general counsel. Donovan oversaw an investigation that exonerated Snyder and accused the woman of fabricating her allegations, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>
<div><p>Wilkinson learned about the settlement in late July 2020, according to a court filing by the team’s former lawyer, within days of a <a>Post story</a> detailing allegations of sexual harassment inside the Washington franchise.</p></div>
<p>After the phone call, according to a declaration filed by Donovan and people familiar with the matter, Chirite gave Wilkinson documents relating to the allegation and the settlement, including a report Donovan wrote after his investigation.</p>
<div><div><p>The next month, The Post published <a>a second story about the team’s workplace</a>, including allegations of sexual harassment from 25 more former employees, with two accusations involving Snyder.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A few days after that story published, the NFL assumed oversight of the investigation, and the team said it had released all former employees from nondisclosure agreements so they could speak with Wilkinson.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>According to people with knowledge of the letter, Bolden claimed to Wilkinson that the team’s release of former employees from NDAs did not apply to the 2009 accuser. Bolden and Reed Smith declined to comment on the record about this letter.
<div><div><p>Snyder’s lawyers responded in writing to Sullivan, denying his claim that they’d offered her more money, according to people familiar with their response.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Washington Football Team settled sexual misconduct claim against Daniel Snyder for $1.6 million</p></div>
<div><p>Wilkinson expressed skepticism that Donovan was acting on his own. In court filings, she accused him of pursuing the lawsuit on behalf of someone else, “obstructing the independent investigation designed to uncover the truth.”</p></div>
<p>Donovan, in his court filings, expressed that it was a “near certainty” the NFL would publicly release Wilkinson’s report, which he predicted would “disparage” his investigation that exonerated Snyder in 2009.</p>
<div><div><p>But interviews and previously unreported court records demonstrate that Snyder wasn’t just interested in identifying the sources of the Epstein stories.</p></div></div>
<p>Each time a judge forced someone to turn over records, Snyder’s list of suspects grew. Then his lawyers went to court again, eventually filing claims against ten people or companies in seven states from August 2020 through April 2021.</p>
<div><div><p>Joe Tacopina, a lawyer for Snyder, said in media interviews that he had evidence that Blair was a key figure in a global conspiracy to defame Snyder through online stories tying him to Epstein.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>his ex-wife and several former co-workers in the weeks after The Post story published.
<div><div><p>“It’s very alarming when people you haven’t talked to in years tell you that somebody is snooping around about you,” Baker said.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic, unsettled several former team employees. And some said they felt the combination of private investigator visits and subpoenas had a chilling effect on former colleagues who declined to speak with Wilkinson or reporters.
<a>the team reached confidential settlements with several cheerleaders who appeared in the videos</a>.
<a>offered financial settlements to other former female employees</a> who had gone public with accounts of harassment, provided they agree to stop speaking to journalists and on social media about their time working for the team.
<a>drew criticism from advocates for victims of sexual harassment</a>.
<div><div><p>NFL officials, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said Daniel Snyder would need Goodell’s permission to return to leading the team alongside his wife. Damage control from the Snyder camp came swiftly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the same time, Snyder’s quest to uncover the sources of damaging stories about him had dwindled mostly to one target: Allen, the team’s former president.</p></div></div>
<a>the Wall Street Journal</a> and
<a>the New York Times</a>, costing Gruden his job and subjecting Allen to public criticism.
<a>second New York Times story</a> based on another batch of Allen’s emails disclosed his “cozy relationship” with NFL general counsel Jeff Pash.
<div><div><p>One of the remaining unanswered questions related to Wilkinson’s investigation is who leaked those emails.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Goodell, in his one news conference since the emails leaked, reiterated the league’s stance that no details from Wilkinson’s investigation would be released, he claimed, to protect the identities of witnesses.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My clients wanted a report, and I think Beth Wilkinson intended to write one all along,” Banks said. “But Roger Goodell and the NFL chose to bury whatever she found.”</p></div></div>

<a>got the punter</a>, Pro Bowl pick Tress Way, and
<a>affected nine assistant coaches and multiple staff members</a>. The team still has eight players in the NFL protocols ahead of Sunday’s pivotal game against the Philadelphia Eagles.
<div><div><h3><div>‘You just felt helpless’</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>that has since infected
<a>50 million people</a> and accounted for
<a>more than 800,000 deaths in the United States</a>. He said he experienced a less-severe version of it at the start of training camp in July, when he tested positive and
<a>was placed on the covid-19 list</a>,
<a>this past month</a> as the virus swept through Washington’s locker room and many others in the NFL.

<a>to reschedule three games, including Washington’s first meeting with the Eagles</a>. Allen Sills, the NFL’s chief medical officer,
<a>said at the time</a> that the league anticipated a surge in cases because of data it received earlier showing waning immunity from vaccinations and a shift from mostly staff members being affected to players.
<a>adjusted its protocols</a>, but in-person interactions remain somewhat impersonal; Washington’s four quarterbacks use the team auditorium, which can hold around 75 people, Rivera said, to spread out during meetings.
<p>Still, breakthrough cases have continued. This past week, practice squad quarterback Kyle Shurmur was added to the covid-19 list, along with Way, right tackle Sam Cosmi, running back Antonio Gibson and left guard Ereck Flowers, among others.</p>
<div><div><p>Previously, players stood to miss up to 10 days, which was the case for backup quarterback Kyle Allen.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Brewer: John Madden could have remained a coach. Aren't we lucky he knew better?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Allen, who is vaccinated, was activated Dec. 24 and played two days later, in the fourth quarter of the team’s blowout loss to the Dallas Cowboys. But he said it took another three days before he felt like himself again.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fellow quarterback Taylor Heinicke experienced much of the same.</p></div></div>
<a>to sign Garrett Gilbert</a>, started him after four light practices and hoped for the best — all while the team’s starter watched from his couch with his play binder in front of him.
<div><div><h3><div>‘I was losing my mind’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Not every player experienced significant symptoms. Some said they felt none at all and returned without issue.</p></div></div>
<a>tested out of the protocols</a> after only five days and didn’t miss a game. But while he was out, his usually regimented routine of workouts and practices was reduced to “absolutely nothing,” he said, save for walking on a treadmill.
<div><div><p>“I felt fine,” he said. “And luckily it happened early enough where I knew I was going to have time to recover and try to get back before the [Week 15 game against the Eagles].”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Fellow defensive tackle Tim Settle cleared the protocols mere hours before the game and hopped on the owner’s private jet to make it to Philadelphia in time — only to be declared inactive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His biggest symptom? Boredom. For a week he was holed up in his room, often working on his pass rushes and three-step get-offs to pass the time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After making it through three rounds, he hopes not to see a fourth.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I feel like covid has a thing for me now,” he said with a smile. “… For some reason, she always finds a way into my life. But we’re writing it off. That’s not happening anymore.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>Four takeaways from Washington's loss to the Eagles</p></div>
<div><div><p>But he did trip, and it wasn’t a touchdown. That was Washington’s day Sunday. In a way, it was Washington’s season — 6-10, with a let’s-just-finish-it-up game at the New York Giants to end it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I thought he did some good things,” Rivera said Sunday. “I thought he gave us a chance.”</p></div></div>
<a>Apologies if you’ve read that before</a>.
<div><div><p>It’s also another way of saying this: He won’t be the starter who carries a winner deep into January.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s not true just because of the numbers. It’s true for two other reasons, both on display Sunday: his physical limitations and the fact that his best quality can also lead to his worst results.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That was awful,” Heinicke said, providing spot-on analysis.</p></div></div>
<i>trying</i> to throw the ball away and he merely didn’t have the arm strength to get it to the sideline. The play was negated because Philadelphia committed a penalty. But it stood out as the worst Heinicke has to offer. He knows that.
<div><div><p>Let’s not make it into an issue going into the season finale against the Giants. Whether Allen plays is moot. We know his arm is stronger than Heinicke’s. We know Heinicke is more creative and resourceful.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Taylor Heinicke stood with his hands on his hips, showing a mix of frustration and dismay as the Washington Football Team’s slim playoff hopes faded away.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Looking at it, I thought that was probably one of the best crossing nines I’ve ever thrown,” Heinicke said. “I think if he doesn’t trip, he catches that thing and it’s a touchdown.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Instead, a crowd of primarily Eagles fans erupted at FedEx Field as the final seconds ticked away and the scoreboard remained frozen at 20-16.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Game over. Season mostly over. Playoff hopes entirely gone.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Svrluga: Taylor Heinicke belongs in the NFL, but he’s not Washington’s QB of the future</p></div>
<a>ravaged by injuries and the coronavirus</a>, testing the depth of its roster as
<a>four days of practice</a> with the team because its starter and his backup tested positive for the
<a>coronavirus</a>. The defense, it turned out, was the bigger issue: It allowed 238 rushing yards in
<a> that 27-17 loss to the Eagles</a> on an odd Tuesday night in Philadelphia.
<div><p>In Antonio Gibson’s absence, Jaret Patterson steps up for Washington’s offense</p></div>
<div><div><p>Patterson, who<a> grew up</a> roughly eight miles from FedEx Field as a die-hard Washington fan, capped the opening drive with an 11-yard touchdown run through a narrow crease in the left side of the line.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Patterson’s touchdown was his first at FedEx Field and only the second of his career. But it was the first and only time Washington would reach the end zone.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The next two drives stalled on third and long — one of which resulted in tight end Ricky Seals-Jones getting carted off on a backboard — and forced Washington to settle for field goals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s fine,” Rivera assured after the game. “He’s stable. He’s fine. … He was up and walking around at halftime.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Takeaways from Sunday's loss</p></div>
<div><div><p>Joey Slye, who hit a 31-yard field goal to make it 10-0 late in the first quarter, returned after Seals-Jones’s injury to nail a 39-yarder. But the Eagles already had found their rhythm — and the end zone.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Washington’s offense was running out of gas as its defense struggled to get off the field.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A 55-yard field goal by Slye closed the first half and put Washington in control with a 16-7 lead, but when Scott’s second touchdown narrowed the advantage, Washington’s problems became more pronounced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A third-and-six sack killed one drive in the third, a third-and-nine sack killed the next, and another negative play helped crater the drive after that in the fourth.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Heinicke finished 27 for 36 for 247 yards, an 81.6 passer rating and an uncertain future in Washington’s decades-long quarterback carousel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The most important thing is how we finish,” Rivera said. “... It’s that old saying: You get knocked down; well, it’s how you get up that’s important. So we’ll see.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In a way, Holcomb can relate to Davis’s struggles. In 2019, the rookie fifth-rounder out of North Carolina was not vocal for the same reasons.</p></div></div>

<div><p>A year and a half after retiring its old name and promising a new one, the Washington Football Team will soon reveal its identity. In a video published Tuesday morning, Washington announced that it will unveil its name and logo Feb. 2.</p></div>
<a>retired</a> its old name and adopted Washington Football Team in the interim as it navigated the
<a>legal hurdles</a> and marketing challenges that come with overhauling an 87-year-old brand.
<a>a 2013 interview</a>, he vowed: “We’ll never change the name. It’s that simple. NEVER — you can use caps.”
<a>finalized in early 2022</a>, after it whittled a collection of some 40,000 fan submissions and worked through multiple focus groups to create a shortlist of options.
<div><p>After two losing seasons, Ron Rivera is optimistic Washington can make a Year 3 leap</p></div>
<a>ruled out</a> “Warriors” and any other nickname linked to Native American imagery.
<div><p>WFT’s new name won’t be ‘Warriors’ or include any Native American imagery, Jason Wright says</p></div>
<div><div><p>On Tuesday, Wright ruled out two more options: RedWolves and Wolves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The prospect of years of litigation wasn’t something that we wanted you, our fans, to have to bear as you begin to embrace a new brand,” <a>he wrote</a>, citing potential trademark issues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You just got the number and the uniform, stripes around the shoulders, and that’s it,” Williams said. “That’s going to be a good-looking uniform.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Feb. 2, the game will end and the next era will begin in Washington.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>His letter Tuesday voiced concern about his safety as well as that of the fans after what he described as a “near-tragic incident.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A Washington spokesperson said team president Jason Wright received the letter and sent an email to Hurts in response.</p></div></div>
<a>told ESPN</a> they were not offered medical attention at the stadium.
<div><div><p>NFL spokesperson Brian McCarthy said in an email Monday night: “We are reviewing the matter with the club to understand what happened and to ensure it does not happen again.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The fans who spoke to ESPN, however, said that there was no signage to indicate a restricted section and that stadium security granted them access.</p></div></div>

<a>50 million people</a> and accounted for

<a>was placed on the covid-19 list</a>,

<a>to reschedule three games, including Washington’s first meeting with the Eagles</a>. Allen Sills, the NFL’s chief medical officer,
<a>said at the time</a> that the league anticipated a surge in cases because of data it received earlier showing waning immunity from vaccinations and a shift from mostly staff members being affected to players.
<a>adjusted its protocols</a>, but in-person interactions remain somewhat impersonal; Washington’s four quarterbacks use the team auditorium, which can hold around 75 people, Rivera said, to spread out during meetings.
<p>Still, breakthrough cases have continued. This past week, practice squad quarterback Kyle Shurmur was added to the covid-19 list, along with Way, right tackle Sam Cosmi, running back Antonio Gibson and left guard Ereck Flowers, among others.</p>
<div><div><p>Previously, players stood to miss up to 10 days, which was the case for backup quarterback Kyle Allen.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Brewer: John Madden could have remained a coach. Aren't we lucky he knew better?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Allen, who is vaccinated, was activated Dec. 24 and played two days later, in the fourth quarter of the team’s blowout loss to the Dallas Cowboys. But he said it took another three days before he felt like himself again.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Taylor Heinicke stood with his hands on his hips, showing a mix of frustration and dismay as the Washington Football Team’s slim playoff hopes faded away.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Looking at it, I thought that was probably one of the best crossing nines I’ve ever thrown,” Heinicke said. “I think if he doesn’t trip, he catches that thing and it’s a touchdown.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Instead, a crowd of primarily Eagles fans erupted at FedEx Field as the final seconds ticked away and the scoreboard remained frozen at 20-16.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Game over. Season mostly over. Playoff hopes entirely gone.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Svrluga: Taylor Heinicke belongs in the NFL, but he’s not Washington’s QB of the future</p></div>
<a>ravaged by injuries and the coronavirus</a>, testing the depth of its roster as
<a>four days of practice</a> with the team because its starter and his backup tested positive for the
<a>coronavirus</a>. The defense, it turned out, was the bigger issue: It allowed 238 rushing yards in
<a> that 27-17 loss to the Eagles</a> on an odd Tuesday night in Philadelphia.
<div><p>In Antonio Gibson’s absence, Jaret Patterson steps up for Washington’s offense</p></div>
<div><div><p>Patterson, who<a> grew up</a> roughly eight miles from FedEx Field as a die-hard Washington fan, capped the opening drive with an 11-yard touchdown run through a narrow crease in the left side of the line.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Patterson’s touchdown was his first at FedEx Field and only the second of his career. But it was the first and only time Washington would reach the end zone.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The next two drives stalled on third and long — one of which resulted in tight end Ricky Seals-Jones getting carted off on a backboard — and forced Washington to settle for field goals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s fine,” Rivera assured after the game. “He’s stable. He’s fine. … He was up and walking around at halftime.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Takeaways from Sunday's loss</p></div>
<div><div><p>Joey Slye, who hit a 31-yard field goal to make it 10-0 late in the first quarter, returned after Seals-Jones’s injury to nail a 39-yarder. But the Eagles already had found their rhythm — and the end zone.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Washington’s offense was running out of gas as its defense struggled to get off the field.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A 55-yard field goal by Slye closed the first half and put Washington in control with a 16-7 lead, but when Scott’s second touchdown narrowed the advantage, Washington’s problems became more pronounced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A third-and-six sack killed one drive in the third, a third-and-nine sack killed the next, and another negative play helped crater the drive after that in the fourth.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Heinicke finished 27 for 36 for 247 yards, an 81.6 passer rating and an uncertain future in Washington’s decades-long quarterback carousel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The most important thing is how we finish,” Rivera said. “... It’s that old saying: You get knocked down; well, it’s how you get up that’s important. So we’ll see.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A railing along the north tunnel at FedEx Field collapsed Sunday, sending multiple fans toppling to the ground and nearly taking out Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts as he walked off the field.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hurts sidestepped the railing and the handful of fans who fell to the ground. He stayed to help up those who fell — and then stayed longer as several corralled him for hugs and photos.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The incident is the latest of many at FedEx Field this season.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During Washington’s Monday night win over the Seattle Seahawks in Week 12, the <a>sprinklers inside a suite</a> went off, prompting another statement from a team spokesperson who assured the water was not sewage.</p></div></div>
<a>a story unto itself</a> and again warranted input from a team spokesperson, who told

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Nicki Jhabvala</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 7:15 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Before the start of the season, even before the start of training camp, Rivera began to publicly question the “maturity” of his team and how it would respond to adversity.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Jamin Davis, struggling to turn skills into production, nears end of underwhelming rookie year</p></div>
<div><div><p>But as focus shifts from this season to the next, Rivera cited player “fit” as a priority as he and his front-office staff evaluate the next steps.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The finer details, Rivera indicated Monday, are developed early in the process.</p></div></div>
<p>But the “fit” of some players may also require time. The hope, according to one person with direct knowledge of the coaches’ thinking, is that player accountability and ownership will naturally start to show more in Year 3.</p>
<div><div><p>Washington finished its first season with Rivera with a 7-9 record and sits at 6-10 this season.</p></div></div>
<p>Among the many differences between the franchises, however, is a major one: Carolina had an MVP quarterback in Cam Newton. Washington has had six different starting quarterbacks since Rivera arrived and is still searching for its future quarterback.</p>
<div><p>Svrluga: Taylor Heinicke belongs in the NFL, but he’s not Washington’s QB of the future</p></div>
<div><p>The team has one game remaining, against the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium on Sunday, and although it no longer carries playoff implications, Rivera said his goal is twofold: to win, and to further evaluate lesser-known players.</p></div>
