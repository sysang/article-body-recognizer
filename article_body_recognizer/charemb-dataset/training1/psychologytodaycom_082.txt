<h1> Coping with Seasonal Affective Disorder and the Winter Blues </h1>
<h2> There are steps we can take to alleviate winter dips in mood. </h2>
<li>Many people experience low mood during the darker months of the year.</li>
<li>Awareness of our moods helps, along with exercising outside, connecting with other people, and improving our diet.</li>
<li>Some people suffer from “seasonal affective disorder” or “SAD,” when lifestyle modifications are not enough to prevent or remedy a dip in mood.</li>
<li>Specific treatments for SAD include using a “light box” to help boost mood with light.</li>

<p>So, how can we cope with seasonal changes in our moods?</p>
<h3>Noting Changes in Your Mood</h3>
<p>For most people, simple measures such as these, combined with an awareness of mood changes, is enough to get through the difficult weeks.</p>
<h3>Seasonal Affective Disorder</h3>
<p>For some people, lifestyle modifications are not enough to prevent or remedy a dip in mood. Some of these people suffer from “seasonal affective disorder” or “SAD.”</p>
<p>SAD is a condition that has many of the features of <a>depression</a>, but occurs chiefly or exclusively in winter. SAD is increasingly recognised as a significant problem for many people.</p>
<a>sex</a>. These are all concerning symptoms that impact significantly on quality of life.
<a>appetite</a>, along with cravings for chocolate and high-carbohydrate foods (e.g., sugary food, white bread). These symptoms are the reverse of those commonly seen in depressive disorders.
<p>Like depression, SAD is more common in women than men. With SAD, there is usually an improvement in the spring. One person in every three with SAD feels more energetic than usual in spring and summer.</p>
<h3>Managing Seasonal Affective Disorder</h3>
<p>Specific treatments for SAD include using a “light box” which provides light (2,500 to 10,000 lux) that is like sunlight, but without the ultra-violet rays. These devices should be used if recommended by a medical professional.</p>
<a>anti-depressant</a> medications are sometimes used, especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (in adults).
<p>The key to SAD is recognising when it occurs, and remembering that, no matter what else happens, spring will come.</p>

<h1> The World War II Era Roots of Modern Neuroscience </h1>
<h2> The discoverers who suffered at the hands of the Nazis. </h2>
<li> Modern neuroscience, like psychopharmacology, grew from the World War II era.</li>
<li>Many key discoveries were made by physicians and scientists who fled the Nazis or suffered at their hands.</li>
<li>Among these were Hans Berger, whose pursuit of "psychic energy" led to the discovery of the human EEG.</li>
<li>Similarly, Otto Loewi, who first demonstrated chemical neurotransmission, was jailed by the Gestapo for accepting the Nobel Prize.</li>
<h3>Hans Berger and the Pursuit of "Psychic Energy"</h3>
<a>shy</a>, introspective youngster with little interest in medicine, but was drawn to astronomy.
<a>telepathy</a>" had taken place, and after returning to Jena, he changed his studies to medicine with the goal of determining what kind of "psychic energy" might have been involved.
<a>spiritual</a> thoughts in his diary.
<p>By 1929, he had gained enough experience that he felt comfortable publishing his first paper, and over the next years described EEG changes with age, mental activity and sleep, and in persons with brain tumors.</p>
<a>depressed</a>, and in 1941 he hung himself in his own clinic.
<h3>Otto Loewi and the Stuff That Dreams Are Made Of</h3>
<p>Otto Loewi was born in 1873 in Frankfort, Germany, the son of a well-to-do wine merchant. He was drawn to classical languages and art, and planned to study art history, but was persuaded by his father to go to medical school.</p>
<a>vagus nerve</a> releases a substance, later found to be acetylcholine, which affects receptors in heart tissue, a finding supporting the chemical view of transmission. As a result, Loewi and Henry Dale were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1936.

<h1> We Miss Many Psychiatric Diagnoses </h1>
<h2> Disabling physical disorders are often associated with mental disorders. </h2>
<li>Clinicians and mental health professionals have been trained to expect patients with a mental disorder to express its psychological symptoms.</li>
<li>Patients with common chronic physical diseases, such as cancer or chronic pain, have high rates of mental illness.</li>
<li>Unfortunately, these patients often do not express the psychological symptoms needed to diagnose the co-occurring mental disorder.</li>
<li>All providers need to actively inquire about a mental disorder in patients with disabling chronic physical symptoms of any origin.</li>
<p>My previous post emphasized that primary care providers are untrained in mental disorders. I’ll discuss one aspect of this lack of training, one that also applies to mental health professionals' training.</p>
<a>DSM</a> somatoform disorders towards the end of the book.
<p>Understanding the role played by physical symptoms in mental health diagnoses can greatly increase recognition (and treatment) of mental disorders, the most common health problem in America.<sup>1</sup></p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Beata Zwolańska-Hołod: Diagnostician</div> <div>Source: CC-BY-SA-3.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<li>A chronic physical disease leads to a mental disorder, for example, enervating emphysema, sickle cell disease, or cancer leads to <a>depression</a>, <a>anxiety</a>, or <a>substance abuse</a>.</li>
<li>A mental disorder leads to chronic physical disease. For example, <a>alcoholism</a> leads to incapacitating cirrhosis of the liver, or depression leads to overeating and diabetes with debilitating painful neuropathy. </li>
<a>chronic pain</a>, fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue fall into this category.
<p>As with organic diseases, the severe physical symptoms may precede or follow the depression, anxiety, or substance use problems.</p>
<p>Whether the disabling symptoms are medically explainable or not makes no difference—it’s the interference with one’s life that correlates with a co-occurring mental illness.</p>
<p>Why then do these physically ill patients with a mental illness not express psychological symptoms, focusing instead on their physical complaints? Without key psychological symptoms, diagnosing a mental illness is nearly impossible.</p>
<li>They stigmatize themselves for having emotional or psychological problems.</li>
<li>They are unaccustomed to discussing personal issues in medical settings.</li>
<li>They believe that physicians will be uninterested, even critical (stigma).</li>
<li>They lack awareness of their psychological symptoms.</li>
<a>sex</a>, go to church, travel, or play golf, it’s not surprising that they develop depression, anxiety, or substance abuse.
<p>While any type of physical symptom may be chronic and disabling, it’s the incapacitating feature that bespeaks an underlying mental illness, not the particular symptoms or whether an actual disease exists.</p>
<a>comorbid</a> physical problem. Indeed, most find that treating the comorbid physical symptoms (severe pain) is far more difficult than treating the mental health problem itself (such as depression).

<a>psychiatric</a> disorders—the Mental Health Care Model.

<h1> Becoming Whole Through Psychedelics </h1>
<h2> How Kelley O’Donnell helps patients heal through psychedelic-assisted therapy. </h2>
<a>psychotherapy</a> at the NYU Langone Center for Psychedelic Medicine. Using her passion for poetry and
<a>philosophy</a>, O’Donnell helps her patients process their pain and, in doing so, create new ideas about who they can become.
<p>What was your pathway to <a>psychedelic-assisted therapy</a>?</p>
<a>fear</a> and greater compassion and acceptance. In doing that, they were able to feel more fully themselves, more fully alive, even as they still faced the possibility of dying.
<p>How do you help patients prepare for their psychedelic experiences?</p>
<p>What does the psychedelic session involve?</p>
<p>Is there an example that comes to mind of a patient who confronted their fears in that way?</p>
<a>cognition</a> alone can’t get around. For example, my patient knew theoretically that feelings weren’t fundamentally dangerous, but she didn’t have the imaginative repertoire to live that out.
<p>How is that patient doing now?</p>
<p>What themes have you observed in your experience as a guide?</p>
<p>How does that realization play out afterward?</p>
<a>shame</a> that comes from knowing there’s stuff in the closet. If we open up the closet and see what’s there, then we don’t have to worry about what other people are going to find if they actually see us.
<p>What lessons can psychedelic therapy provide for people who haven’t experienced it?</p>
<a>intuition</a>. Through an orientation of compassionate curiosity, we can transform our understanding not only of who we are but how we fit into the wholeness of things.

<h1> The Surgeon General’s Call to Action on Child Mental Health </h1>
<h2> A new advisory hopes to mobilize action to improve well-being. </h2>
<li>The Surgeon General has recently released a new advisory describing the mental health crisis among American youth.</li>
<li>The advisory provides a number of recommendations for all types of individuals and groups to improve the problem.</li>
<li>The huge mental health workforce shortage is an area in need of further attention. </li>
<a>Psychiatry</a> (AACAP) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), issuing dire statements about worsening mental health and declaring the problem a
<a>depression</a>, and other mental health challenges.
<h3>Topline Recommendations</h3>
<p>· Take care of your own mental and physical health</p>
<p>· Nurture strong, safe relationships with your kids</p>
<p>· Help children develop good peer relations</p>
<p>· Provide a supportive and stable home environment to the best of your ability</p>
<p>· Try to prevent substance use in youth</p>
<p>· Get regular healthcare as much as possible</p>
<p>· Look for warning signs of emerging mental health problems</p>
<p>· Minimize access to means of <a>self-harm</a>, particularly more lethal ones like firearms and medications</p>
<p>· Monitor and limit media and online use, as appropriate</p>
<p>· Advocate for mental health in your community</p>
<a>leadership</a> from the federal government.”
<h3>Some Surprises in the Recommendations</h3>
<p>One recommendation to youth themselves is to serve others – something that may first come across as a bit strange but can in fact help children and <a>adolescence</a> develop a sense of purpose and <a>self-worth</a>.</p>

<h1> What Is Deep Brain Stimulation? </h1>
<h2> Sending electricity directly to parts of the brain can be a good thing. </h2>
<p> Posted October 13, 2020 </p>
<p>In several illnesses, the complex electrical exchanges that give us our lives go slightly off. Modern medicine is beginning to learn how to treat an electrical problem directly with electricity as an alternative to <a>medication</a>. </p>
<p>Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is one example.</p>
<a>obsessive-compulsive</a> disorder, Parkinson's disease, and serious
<a>depression</a>. More than 160,000 people with neurological conditions have been treated by DBS, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons
<a>therapy</a> (ECT), has remission rates of 60 to 90 percent, but
<a>relapse</a> rates are high, and repeated treatments have cumulative cognitive side effects that many won't tolerate. Other options are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and
<a>vagus nerve</a> stimulation (VNS).
<p>When should you consider DBS? You might consider DBS if your symptoms are interfering with your life because they can’t be controlled by medication or the side-effects are intolerable.</p>
<p>You can still participate in other treatments that might become available.</p>
<p>DBS is reversible—you can turn off the device. </p>
<a>trial </a>appeared in 2012 concluding that the improvements in patients receiving DBS for Parkinson’s was stable. In 2014, surgical guidelines
<a>appeared</a> for treating patients with OCD, in an overview concluding that DBS on both sides of the brain offered more improvement than a sham treatment (these treatments serve the function of a
<a>placebo</a> in a test of medication, checking whether the patient improves simply because he feels hopeful, or because of the treatment itself). Just this year, new
<a>research</a> appeared testing various targets in the brain to help the worst cases of depression.
<p>As with any surgery, the risks increase in people age 70 and older or if you have heart disease or high blood pressure.</p>

<h1> The Debate Over Electroconvulsive Therapy </h1>
<h2> The conversation about the safety of electroconvulsive therapy rages on. </h2>

<li>Electroconvulsive therapy reportedly works more quickly and efficiently than conventional antidepressants.</li>
<li>Doctors today administer shock therapy under anesthesia, making the procedure itself painless.</li>
<li>But shock therapy can cause cognitive deficits, such as memory loss, that sometimes persist.</li>

<p>Each year, more than <a>100,000 Americans</a> undergo electroconvulsive <a>therapy</a>, also known as "electroshock treatment" and "shock therapy."</p>
<p>Electroconvulsive therapy may seem like it's from medieval times, but the treatment wasn't invented <a>until the early 1940s</a>.</p>
<a>depression</a>. But the side effects of metrazol-induced convulsions were so extreme that Cerletti soon started looking for a safer alternative.
<p>Once perfected, electroshock treatment did indeed turn out to be more effective than the metrazol paradigm. </p>
<p>However, it didn't take long before doctors worldwide started using the procedure systematically as a treatment protocol, not only for mental illness, but also for criminal behavior, <a>memory</a> loss, and "feeble-mindedness."</p>
<p>Often, the procedure—which reportedly was extremely painful—had no effects aside from its harsh side effects, as iconically depicted in Ken Kesey’s 1962 novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.</p>
<a>bipolar disorder</a>, and the use of muscle relaxers and anesthetics during the procedure has made it painless, as patients are
<a>unconscious</a> while undergoing the treatment. Muscle aches, body soreness, and headache, along with nausea and confusion, following the treatment are
<p>But shock therapy can also cause temporary, or less frequently, <a>permanent brain injury</a>, and patients do not always <a>consent to the treatment</a>, which has led some to regard the procedure as cruel and inhumane.</p>
<h3>How Does Electroconvulsive Therapy Work?</h3>
<a>neural</a> activity that is the primary therapeutic agent of the treatment.
<a>antidepressants</a>—to start working in those individuals who respond to them.
<a>dopamine</a>, norepinephrine, and serotonin. The brain's levels of some or all of these neurotransmitters appear to be significantly reduced in individuals with major depressive disorder.
<p>But is electroconvulsive therapy safe?</p>
<h3>Brain Damage as a Result of Shock Therapy?</h3>
<a>cognitive decline</a>. However, there have been
<a>too few clinical trials</a> of the potentially adverse effects of shock therapy to fully assess the dangers of this treatment regimen.
<p>Some self-proclaimed <a>shock-survivor activists</a> argue that the negative effects of electroshock outweigh its benefits and that the shock industry has concealed its true consequences.</p>
<a>normal standards</a> of approval, and that the shock industry and organized
<a>psychiatry</a> have relied on public-relations campaigns rather than clinical trials to improve its reputation.
<p>There is no doubt that electroconvulsive therapy has severe side effects. The treatment regimen produces <a>short-term memory loss</a> and, in some cases, <a>long-term memory loss</a> and an inability to think abstract thoughts.</p>
<p>Impairment of thought and memory functions is a kind of temporary, and in some cases permanent, brain damage—<a>comparable to</a> <a>traumatic brain injury</a>.</p>
