<header><div><h1>How to travel with your pet this holiday season</h1></div><h2>Tips for navigating flights, car rentals, hotels and restaurants during Thanksgiving and Christmas</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 9, 2021 at 12:58 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>8 questions about flying with emotional support animals, answered</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Flying with pets is trickier now</div></h3></div></div>
<a>allowed</a> to fly in the cabin at no extra charge. That is because of
<a>new federal rules</a>, which were in the works before the pandemic, that enabled airlines to crack down on pet-toting passengers.
<a>International Pet and Animal Transportation Association</a> and owner of
<a>World Pet Travel</a>. “[If] they take their dog to Belize, it doesn’t come home.”
<div><div><p>People looking to fly their pets, she said, need to make sure the airline will carry them. And if they’re looking to travel internationally, they must confirm the pet would be allowed back into the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Just be careful,” Passman said. “I can’t stress it enough.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Check how your hotel defines “pet-friendly”</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finding a hotel, Airbnb or other rental that accepts animals is a demanding task on its own, but figuring out how different properties define “pet-friendly” is an additional challenge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Halliburton, the BringFido executive, said some hotels roll out the red carpet for pets, with amenities such as canine massage and gourmet room service.</p></div></div>
<div><p>You got a pandemic pup. Here’s how to take it on its first road trip.</p></div>
<a>accept pets in their listings.</a> BringFido’s rentals flag which properties charge pet fees and if they allow big dogs or restrict the number of pets that can stay.
<div><div><p>“It’s very difficult to find the information that we have on our site on Vrbo or Airbnb,” Halliburton said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Pet-friendly doesn’t necessarily translate into cat-friendly,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Avoid cleaning charges in rental cars</div></h3></div></div>
<a>suggestions</a> for avoiding extra fees, including getting a pet groomed before bringing them in a rental car, choosing a cloth interior to make vacuuming easier, avoiding mud, leaving baking soda in the car and using a lint roller daily.
<div><div><p>Burkert said her tip is to get an inexpensive shower curtain, thread the holes into the car’s headrests and cover whatever area the pet will sit in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Take your small pet on the rails</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Traveling through the pandemic in the company of dogs</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Practice mealtime manners for restaurants</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Burkert frequents restaurants with her mixed-breed dog, Myles. When she gets up to leave, she said, fellow customers will often say they didn’t even realize she had a pet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s exactly what I wanted,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, Burkert said, dogs can have bad days: “You always have to be ready to get up and leave.”</p></div></div>
<p>She recommended checking restaurant websites and calling ahead to make sure they allow pets in outdoor areas (and that outdoor areas are even open). Breweries are the rare establishments that will allow pets inside, though that is not guaranteed.</p>
<div><p>Dog traveling with you over the holidays? Know your petiquette.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Keep pet safety in mind on the road</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gabrielle Fadl, the medical director of Bond Vet in Brooklyn, said the safest way for pets to travel in cars is to put them inside carriers or crates. There are also seat belts made for dogs that don’t fit into crates.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In the days leading up to a trip, Fadl said, owners should leave the crate or carrier out and occasionally leave snacks in them to create positive associations. Traveling with a familiar blanket could help ease stress on the trip, too.</p></div>
<div><p>Forget a pre-flight drink. Pet an airport therapy dog.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Make a medical checklist</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>If a pet is flying, owners should make sure they know whether the airline will require a health certificate and how long in advance it can be issued, Fadl said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said older pets should get checked before a trip to make sure the stress of traveling won’t be harmful. Owners should bring up any potential travel-related issues with their vet in advance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If your pet gets nauseous or anxious, there are medications that can help make it an easier trip for all parties involved,” Fadl said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The pet’s packing list should include any medications they are taking, as well as prescription refills in case of an emergency.</p></div></div>
<a>Animal Poison Control.</a> She said dogs should wear a tag with identification and a contact number while on a trip.
<div><div><p>“Most veterinary practices are going to be booked out for quite some time,” she said.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>How 4 environmentalists travel with the climate in mind</h1></div><h2>Less (or no) flying, long road trips and a lot of exploring on foot </h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 11, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Kim Cobb, a climate scientist at Georgia Tech, used to be an elite-level frequent flier, racking up more than 150,000 miles a year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But a few years ago, after a crisis of conscience, she started scaling back her air travel. First she cut it by 30 percent, then 60 percent, and then made the call to stay on the ground in late 2019.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Of course, lo and behold, our entire lives were turned upside down, and almost nobody flew for many months of 2020,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite avoiding flights, Cobb loves to travel — especially with her family, which includes four kids between the ages of 10 and 14. They just go about it in a different way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s changed the way my family has approached our time together and our priorities, and what we do in terms of investigating what’s available on the ground,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Air travel was down significantly in 2020. Climate activists hope it stays this way.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Kim Cobb, climate scientist</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>They typically stay in vacation rentals or with friends or family instead of hotels. A big benefit: Those options include kitchens, making it easier to feed Cobb’s family, which includes vegetarians and vegans.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The family is considering a “massive camping trip” to Yellowstone National Park in the future, which would double as a trip to visit Cobb’s brother in Montana.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cobb said she finds traveling “incredibly joyful,” even if the time spent getting to destinations is longer and the trip is more complicated than hopping on a flight.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Let’s remember that flying around with four kids was never too much of a picnic either,” she said, laughing as she recalled a catastrophe of the diaper variety in the airport security line.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cobb can’t say she will never fly again, and she wants people to feel welcome to explore what kind of eco-friendly changes they can make individually.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“An individual move like that can hasten collective action to think about how and why we fly to weigh the climate damage and climate injustice of flying,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to actually make your travel better for the planet</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Aseem Prakash and Nives Dolsak, environmental academics</div></h3></div></div>
<p>“That just means I have to think very carefully when I fly and how I fly,” she said, and opt for local getaways or vacations by train or car when possible. Prakash describes the approach as going on a “carbon diet.”</p>
<div><div><p>Prakash and Dolsak also purchase <a>carbon offsets</a> — investments in projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere — for twice the amount of their emissions for air and road trips.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Despite COP26 pledges, world still on track for dire warming</p></div>
<div><div><p>He said they also largely avoid social media, which he sees as “fueling this epidemic of consumerism where people don’t go in depth.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Green’ travel stunts by airlines can’t erase the environmental impact of flying</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Peter Kalmus, no-fly advocate</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kalmus said he knows the movement to reduce flying is controversial and that people feel like travel is a virtuous thing. He agreed with that last point.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He and his wife have parents in Illinois, so they and their two teenagers visit often by taking Amtrak or driving the family’s Tesla Model 3 — an electric vehicle that he said is as easy as any other car.</p></div></div>
<p>He said they also like to stop along the way and visit friends, or camp in national parks and cook food at the campsite. This summer, Kalmus said, they went to Portland, Ore., and through Montana, fitting in a Yellowstone visit in Wyoming.</p>
<div><div><p>“It can be a lot of fun to meander your way and see the sights and see your friends,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“One of the main considerations we have is whether a place is burning, how likely it is to burn,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The family also enjoys long hiking trips in the Sierra Nevada mountains — which, again, does not provide a true escape. On a hike this year, Kalmus said, he was shocked by dead trees everywhere.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Mortgage rates show little change ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting</h1></div>

<div><div><p>After a volatile late summer and early fall, mortgage rates have been stuck in a holding pattern this winter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aside from the one week in November when it dropped to 2.98 percent, the 30-year fixed average has hovered around 3.1 percent for the past five weeks.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Before this 1911 bungalow was built in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Northwest Washington, the developer modified the original plan for a Sears kit house. And it has continued to evolve over the years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This house was marketed as No. 151, later known as the Avondale model. It was described in the catalogue as “a fine example of a modern bungalow.” The design was hugely popular and was sold from 1909 to 1924.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Julian “Pete” MacDonald, who has owned the house since 1992, marvels at the extra finishes Kite added to the house.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Avondale was designed as a one-level house. MacDonald hired architect Nicholas Gerachis to increase the living space by turning the attic into a second floor and enlarging the basement to create a rental apartment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gerachis “was a master at taking an older house, keeping the feel and spirit of the original, but making changes,” MacDonald said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gerachis also added a deck off the kitchen. MacDonald’s wife, Allen, filled the terraced backyard with a profusion of plant species.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“She wanted to design a garden that would have blossoming all year,” MacDonald said.</p></div></div>
<p>MacDonald said he and his wife would spend summer evenings out on the deck, basking in the serene oasis despite being less than a block from busy Connecticut Avenue. In the winter, they spent their evenings in front of the wood-burning fireplace.</p>
<div><div><p>The four-bedroom, three-bathroom, 3,450-square-foot house is listed at just under $1.5 million.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Although mortgage rates moved sideways this week, the announcement by the Federal Reserve indicates the days of low rates may be waning.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>What drew Howard Forman to Prospect Hill, a circa 1854 house in McLean, Va., was not its rich history. The attraction was more practical. Prospect Hill had a detached three-car garage with living space above it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“At the time, [the house’s history] was not a factor at all,” Forman said. “It was that it had the space over the garage, and we needed the space.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Forman and his wife, Lee Forman, needed the space because they wanted to use it for a museum for the bags that Lee collected for 40 years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I retired in 1999,” he said. “In 2001, my late wife convinced me that we needed to start a museum of bags.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>In a McLean condo, thousands of bags tell the history of America</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We started looking for a home, a place where we could store the bags and use the bags and do what we needed to do,” Forman said. “Prospect Hill met that requirement with the room over the garage.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We launched the website [for the museum] at the beginning of February 2007, and at the end of the month, she found out she had cancer,” Forman said. “She fought it for two years and lost.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After Lee died, Forman’s enthusiasm for the bags waned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I worked at it a little bit but not real excited, because it was her thing, not mine,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When the University of Akron in Ohio expressed interest, Forman happily donated the Lee L. Forman Bag Collection to its Institute for Human Science and Culture in 2019.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after the Formans bought Prospect Hill, they started to learn about its past.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Although the property was broken up over the years, the house remained in the Carper family until the 1960s. George Wallace Carper, who ran a successful dairy farm there, was the last Carper to own the land before it was developed.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The property includes a tennis court, a children’s playhouse and a smokehouse that dates from the 1800s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom, 6,840-square-foot house, on 2.83 acres, is listed at just under $3.3 million.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>After last week’s dip, mortgage rates returned to the level they had been much of the past two months.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aside from last week and the one week in November when it dropped to 2.98 percent, the 30-year fixed average has hovered around 3.1 percent for the past eight weeks.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Ken Hoagland was surprised to see his monthly mortgage payment increase recently.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since 2017, premium rates are up 11.4 percent on average, which means they are rising faster than inflation<b> </b>— and insurance experts expect that the rates will stay high.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“From everything I know about homeowners’ risk, I expected those numbers to be higher,” said Dale Porfilio, the chief insurance officer at Triple-I. “Honestly, I would say they still should go up further.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Most mortgage lenders require borrowers to carry a homeowners insurance policy. According to a recent analysis by Bankrate.com, the average homeowner spends about 1.91 percent of their household income on home insurance.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Your home renovation may require an insurance update. Here’s why.</p></div>
<div><p>Opinion: Biden is hiking lumber tariffs at the wrong time</p></div>
<a>National Association of Home Builders</a>. “Domestic lumber production has really not increased in the United States. The economics of lumber tariffs when we’re trying to fight inflation don’t make any sense.”
<a>survey by the NAHB</a> of its members in May found shortages of materials more widespread than at any time since NAHB began tracking the issue in the 1990s. Appliances were rated the items most in short supply, followed by lumber.
<a>winter freeze in Texas</a>, which led to the state’s largest non-hurricane weather loss event.
<a>Hurricane Ida</a>, which hit in late summer, is expected to rank among the five costliest hurricanes in U.S. history. It is too soon to calculate the losses from the
<a>tornadoes that ripped through eight states</a> in early December.
<div><p>Cold, heat, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes: The year in weather disasters</p></div>
<div><div><p>Porfilio said insured damage from tornadoes, hurricanes, severe storms, wildfires and other natural disasters has reached $82 billion this year, bringing the total from 2017 until now to more than $400 billion.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What should homeowners do after a tornado?</p></div>
<div><div><p>When a natural disaster affects a wide area, the demand for materials and labor puts pressure on prices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because of the rash of natural disasters, some insurance companies are offering extended replacement cost coverage at an additional cost.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Whether the increases are small or large, there are ways to save money on homeowners insurance premiums. Hoagland opted to increase his deductible from $1,000 to $2,000, which reduced his homeowners insurance by about $500 annually.</p></div>
<div><p>Eight tips for buying homeowners insurance</p></div>
<p>On its website, Triple-I lists <a>12 ways in which homeowners can lower the cost of their premiums</a>, including shopping around, bundling home and auto insurance, making the home more disaster-resistant and improving the home’s security.</p>
<div><div><p>Although 2021 may turn out to be an exceptional year for natural disasters and rising inflation, it could be some time before homeowners insurance premiums moderate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div>clarification</div><p>The paragraph about replacement cost should have mentioned that homes must be rebuilt according to current building codes, which may cost more. </p></div></div></div>

<div><p>What a difference a year makes. One year ago this week, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate sank to its lowest level in history. This week, fixed mortgage rates followed long-term bond yields and rose to their highest levels in 20 months.</p></div>
<div><p>Inflation could linger longer than previously expected, Federal Reserve officials discussed in December</p></div>
<div><div><p>“New Year’s optimism has money flowing away from bonds and toward riskier assets, pushing yields and mortgage rates higher to start 2022,” said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bankrate.com, which puts out a weekly mortgage rate trend index, found nearly two-thirds of the experts it surveyed expect rates to go up in the coming week.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Adela Suliman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 6:48 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Sweden is launching a new agency to defend against a rising threat: disinformation — organized campaigns to spread false information.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The agency will aim to boost the country’s “ability to identify and counter foreign malign information influence, disinformation and other dissemination of misleading information directed at Sweden,” Hjort said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The government-funded body, which will start with 45 staff members based in Karlstad and Solna, will report to the country’s justice department.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here’s what you need to know about Russia’s military buildup on the border with Ukraine</p></div>
<div><div><p>The idea for the agency was first developed in 2018, and it is being led by Director General Henrik Landerholm, a former army officer and ambassador to the Middle East.</p></div></div>
<a>warned </a>Russia against carrying out “malicious cyber activities” on the eve of elections in Germany, as Europe grows wary of Kremlin-backed hackers.
<div><div><p>Social media giant Facebook issued a <a>report </a>last year revealing disinformation campaigns in more than 50 countries since 2017, and it named Russia as the largest producer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For this year, the agency will focus on working to “protect Sweden against foreign malign information influence” ahead of elections in September, he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sweden is not a member of NATO and has maintained a scaled-down military since the Cold War ended. Neighboring Russia has been an <a>ongoing </a>perceived threat, with its annexation of Crimea in 2014 alarming the Swedes.</p></div></div>
<a>protests </a>over government-imposed restrictions. The agency emphasizes that individuals will have a role to play in tackling fake news, alongside a robust national media and civil society.
<div><p>The Swedish agency says fighting disinformation “strengthens democracy,” however it will need to do so without impinging on the freedoms of speech and expression, which are protected by the country’s constitution.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“One has to tread very carefully when it comes to freedom of speech. We must never limit the democratic rights of our population,” Hjort said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This approach, she said, was “probably less likely to meet with public resistance” than simply blocking information on social media or websites.</p></div></div>
<p>Still, the move to establish such an agency, Bauer said, reflects a shift toward preventing disinformation as a form of consumer protection — with the government stepping in proactively to stop citizens from getting hurt by fake news.</p>

<div><h1>5 takeaways from Biden’s forceful Jan. 6 takedown of Trump</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 12:04 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>sarcastically saying he missed “my predecessor.”</a> Biden largely
<a>avoided mentioning Trump</a> in the following months.
<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below are some takeaways from Biden’s speech.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>1. The Trump focus</div></h3></div></div>
<p>“For the first time in our history, the president had not just lost an election; he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol,” Biden said. “But they failed. They failed.”</p>
<div><p>Biden added later: “He has done what no president in American history — the history of this country — has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Then Biden went after Trump’s delayed response.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>2. Not just targeting but goading Trump</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Much of Biden’s speech seemed aimed at not just criticizing but also goading Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He referred to Trump’s “bruised ego” over losing the 2020 election.</p></div></div>
<a>invocations of the 74 million people who voted for Trump</a>, and the idea that not further scrutinizing Trump’s baseless voter-fraud claims was tantamount to disregarding those voters.
<div><div><p>Biden also pointed to those who might otherwise be allies who clearly didn’t back up Trump’s claims.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden punctuated it all toward the end of his speech by labeling Trump what Trump fears perhaps most of all: a loser.</p></div></div>
<i>defeated </i>former president,” Biden said, emphasizing “defeated” and then repeating it — “defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.”
<div><div><h3><div>3. A recognition that being passive doesn’t work</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>It might have been a special occasion, but it also seemed to mark recognition that Trump is going nowhere, and one can’t pretend otherwise.</p></div></div>
<a>did that in a late-2017 speech against Trump</a>, and on Thursday there was a word curiously missing from Biden’s remarks: “Trump.”
<div><div><p>Biden’s speech, though, was clearly targeted at one person in particular. And if you’re saying “<a>all that I mean</a>,” why not say all that you mean and make it even more explicit?</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>4. The undersold rebuke</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Toward the end, Biden referred to something that hasn’t gotten nearly enough attention: the implicit GOP idea that the presidential election was somehow stolen, but not other races.</p></div></div>
