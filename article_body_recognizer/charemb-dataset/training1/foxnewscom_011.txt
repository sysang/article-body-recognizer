<h1>Biden objects to NDAA restriction barring transfer of prisoners from Gitmo to other countries</h1>
<h2>Congress has long restricted the president's ability to move Guantánamo Bay detainees</h2>
<p>President Biden took issue with ongoing restrictions on his ability to move detainees from Guantánamo Bay in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, arguing the restrictions could threaten national security.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, section 1032 of the Act continues to bar the use of funds to transfer Guantánamo Bay detainees to the custody or effective control of certain foreign countries," Biden <a>said in a statement</a> during the signing of the NDAA Monday.</p>
<a>some lawmakers argued</a> was necessary to prevent potentially dangerous detainees from threatening American soil.
<p>This year's massive $770 billion <a>defense bill</a>, which was signed by Biden on Monday, will keep those restrictions in place.</p>

<h1>PA Senate candidate on Biden cutting military stipend for 48k troops: We can add to 'list of grievances'</h1>
<h2>Pentagon announced 48,000 troops will no longer receive cost-of-living stipend</h2>
<h4><a>Biden administration slashes military stipend for 48,000 troops </a></h4>
<p>Candidate for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, Kathy Barnette, joined 'Fox Friends First' to discuss the decision, saying arguing it can be added to the administration's 'list of grievances.'</p>
<p>Candidate for U.S. <a>Senate</a> in Pennsylvania, Kathy Barnette, is speaking out after the <a>Biden</a> administration cut <a>military</a> cost-of-living stipends for thousands of troops stationed in pricey areas around the country. </p>
<p><a><u>PENTAGON TO CUT STATESIDE COST-OF-LIVING STIPEND FOR THOUSANDS OF TROOPS IN 2022</u></a></p>
<p>Barnette, who is a veteran herself, joined <a>"Fox Friends First"</a> to discuss the move, telling <a>Benjamin Hall</a> the decision can be added to the "list of grievances" regarding the Biden administration's treatment of the military. </p>
<p>"I think we can add this to the long list of grievances that we have with the Biden administration and how they have dealt with our service members," Barnette explained. </p>
<p>She continued by slamming the White House for how it treated U.S. troops after Biden's inauguration and the way it withdrew American forces from Afghanistan earlier this year. </p>
<div> <div><p> President Biden greets soldiers at Fort Bragg to mark the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 22, 2021. </p></div></div>
<p><a><u>DEFENSE DEPARTMENT ANNOUNCES HOUSING ALLOWANCE RAISE AND OTHER MEASURES TO ASSIST STRUGGLING TROOPS</u></a></p>
<p>"Now we have our service members once more sacrificing, putting their families out here and the federal government sending them to these very expensive cities - and now removing a very small stipend as you've already indicated," she continued. </p>
<p>Barnette also acknowledged the impact this move will have on <a>military families</a> given skyrocketing consumer prices across the board as Americans continue to grapple with rampant <a>inflation</a>. </p>
<p>"The cost of living is so much higher and this particular stipend, although small, covers non-housing expenses, food, energy, gas, all of which are a direct result of the failed policies of this administration," Barnette stated. </p>
<p>The Pentagon <a>announced</a> the change last week, which is expected to take effect Jan. 1 and will take the Continental United States Cost-of-Living Allowance (CONUS COLA) away from almost 50,000 troops. </p>
<p>Service members are only <a>eligible</a> for COLA when they are stationed in an area that has non-housing costs which are 8% over the national average. </p>
<p>Washington, D.C., and Boston were two of the locations that will no longer offer the COLA stipend in 2022. </p>

<h1>Patriotic father-son duo from Wisconsin are 'raising the flag' for America's military and more</h1>
<h2>They're both dedicated craftsmen and artists — and they've found a way to live the American Dream while giving back to heroes across the country</h2>
<h4><a>Wisconsin business donates $250K of products to military families </a></h4>
<p>A father-and-son team from <a>Wisconsin</a> are <a>patriotic</a> and inspiring — and it's all from the heart, soul, and mind. </p>
<p>Their almost-immediate success, he said, "was accidental. We just couldn't believe it."</p>
<p>The father-son duo wound up selling thousands of their specially designed American flags — and decided, ultimately, to go the entrepreneurial route.</p>
<p>"This [product] really exploded," he said. The Hendersons sold "thousands" in just one Christmas season alone.</p>
<p>Their story of patriotism, creativity, and giving back to others keeps getting better, however. </p>
<p>Justis Henderson practically grew up in his father's shop. "Even at the age of 10, he was polishing and welding and painting" because he wanted to, said the proud dad. </p>

<p>Over time, the younger Henderson "took his own artistic eye and embarked on a process of marbling paint. And he invented our marble flags that we now have on our website."</p>
<p>Once his son's products launched, "things went crazy — we just couldn't make them fast enough," said Shane Henderson.</p>
<p>Lat year, when Justis Henderson was 17, he told his dad, "I want to do this. This is what I want to do. I want to be a metal artist." </p>
<p>So — following in his father's footsteps — he started his own business crafting steel flags, called Flags by Justis. It's located right across the street from his dad's shop. </p>
<div> <div><p> Justis Henderson, 18, is shown at work in his shop. He says that "continuously growing and improving" has been the secret to his success. (Courtesy Shane Henderson and Justis Henderson)</p></div></div>
<p>"We have kind of a metal art dynasty going on here," said Shane Henderson.</p>
<p>The products are handmade and specially crafted. "They're works of art," said Shane Henderson about his son's creations. "Schools, churches, banks, and other businesses are proud to display them." (See their creations in the two tweets just below.) </p>
<p>He added, "Our businesses are now growing side-by-side. We're two metal artists doing what we do — and it all took off on social media," said Shane Henderson.</p>
<p>Most sales of Metal Art of Wisconsin and Flags by Justis occur through their websites, though they do occasionally get walk-in customers.</p>
<p>"These are patriotic products, so we automatically attract military, law enforcement, and other heroes — the heroes of this nation," said the elder Henderson.</p>
<p>To date, they've donated over $250,000 worth of products to veterans, military, police officers, first-line responders, crossing guards, and many others across the country. "We give to anyone in the community who is making a difference," he said. </p>
<div> <div><p> A police officer and his dog are shown here with a unique flag creation from the Henderson father-son team. (Courtesy Shane Henderson and Justis Henderson)</p></div></div>
<p>Any member of the public can nominate individuals to receive this donation, which is worth about $500. </p>
<p>"Doing this is what makes it all worth it for us," said Shane Henderson (shown at right, below, in this tweet). </p>
<p>The entire process of building their businesses and helping those businesses grow has been a strong education for Justis Henderson, who is now 18. </p>
<p>"I think it's a great experience," he told Fox News Digital by phone. "And I think any teenager like me should get interested in something they love to do and make a career out of it."</p>
<p>He said, "I'm going to continue working on the business." Eventually, he might pursue a degree in metal art, he said; for now, the business and his artwork are his singular focus and passion.</p>
<p>His peers admire and appreciate what he's doing. "I'm so young. And I basically prove that no matter what age you are, you can do anything." </p>
<p>Justis Henderson also said, "I'm very excited for my future. And it's all thanks to my dad for teaching me while I was growing up."</p>
<p><a>AT CHRISTMAS AND ALL YEAR LONG, CODE OF VETS GIVES BACK TO VETERANS IN NEED</a></p>
<p>They use locally sourced wood and other components as much as they can.</p>
<p>They're also already signed up for the Made in America trade show in October 2022, which will take place in Louisville, Kentucky. It begins on Oct. 6, 2022 — National Manufacturing Day.</p>

<h1>The Walking Patriot: Kansas soldier shares his story to inspire others</h1>
<h2>Derek Redenius began walking in October 2020 and hopes to use his social media fame to help veterans</h2>
<p>A <a>Kansas</a> solider is sharing his message of inspiration and positivity on <a>social media</a>.</p>
<p>Derek Redenius joined the National Guard when he was 17 and has since gone on three tours. When he returned, he began driving semis across the Midwest, and it was behind the wheel where he said he had an epiphany.</p>
<div> <div><p> Derek Redenius, The Walking Patriot, walks by a waving crowd. (Derek Redenius) </p></div></div>
<p>That morning, Redenius put on his 25-pound military vest and started walking. As he walked, he waved to local farmers, and they waved back from their tractors. As his walk turned onto Kansas Highway 15, he continued to wave to passersby. </p>
<p>"It was refreshing to see people see me. It felt really good. When I got home, I wrote a little post on my Facebook thanking people for acknowledging and waving to me. I thought, I am going to do this again tomorrow." </p>
<p>The next morning, Derek Redenius started carrying a large American flag as a show of patriotism.</p>
<p>"I would share something positive on social media," he said. "One day, someone told me to post on TikTok. The first few videos didn’t do great, but one morning, my video got 20,000 views." </p>
<p>After his first viral video, Redenius began sharing more.</p>
<p>"People are enjoying my videos, and it’s helping me. In turn, the inspiration that we’re giving each other is creating positivity, which we need more of in this world."</p>
<p>Since he began in October 2021, he has gained over 61,000 Tik Tok followers.</p>
<p>"I didn’t share my personal views towards politics, I just tried to show inspiration, positivity, and appreciation to this country. I want to give my thanks to God, this country and show positivity." </p>
<div> <div><p> The Walking Patriot carries a large American flag as he walks along. (Derek Redenius) </p></div></div>
<p>As Redenius looks towards 2022, he shares his dream of creating a movement to help others.</p>
<p>"Twenty-two is a big number for service men and women because that’s the average number of suicides we have per day. I’ve made a plan to walk every day of 2022, to do something for <a>veterans</a> and for others."</p>
<p>As Derek looks towards the future of The Walking Patriot, he wants to, "help veterans less fortunate," however he is able.</p>

<h1>Texas family donates late son's medical equipment to Chicago families facing similar challenges</h1>
<h2>The Texas family drove from San Antonio to Chicago to hand-deliver the equipment to a nonprofit that helps with home health care</h2>
<p>A family that spent tens of thousands of dollars of medical equipment throughout their son's lifetime <a>donated it all to people</a> in need – families who knew all too well what it is like being in the Pantoja family's shoes. </p>
<p>In May 2021, Itza Pantoja and her husband, Adrian, packed up a U-Haul with the equipment that was used to improve their son Dylan's quality of life before he passed away in 2019 at 16 years old. </p>

<p>"Dylan would have loved for someone else to get it," Pantoja told Fox News. </p>
<p>Pantoja said the family had to pay out of pocket for a majority of the equipment. </p>
<div> <div><p> Itza Pantoja's sons, Adrik and Dylan. (Itza Pantoja)</p></div></div>
<p>So, in order to cover some of the cost, Pantoja started selling baked goods to families at the hospital. Pantoja's efforts began while they were living in Puerto Rico and continued when they moved to Texas in 2013. </p>
<p>"I also tutored kids in English or, you know, babysat kids while their parents were out just so that we can make ends meet," she said. </p>
<p><a>NYPD OFFICER SAVES MAN WHO FELL ON SUBWAY TRACKS MOMENTS BEFORE TRAIN ARRIVED</a></p>
<p>After Dylan passed away, Pantoja donated some of the equipment to families in the area. The rest was packed into a garage, which was so full you couldn't even open the door without something falling out, Pantoja said. </p>
<p>"But then the pandemic hit and nobody wanted to take anything," she said. "And I was like, ‘What do I do with all this?’ You know, I didn't want to throw it away because that's like throwing away thousands and thousands" of dollars. </p>
<p>Pantoja said the family eventually got in contact with ASI, which said it would gladly take the supplies and that it had a handful of families who could greatly benefit. </p>
<p>Even before they even started their journey to Chicago on May 25, Pantoja said there were about five families awaiting their arrival. </p>
<p>The day provoked a ton of mixed emotions, Pantoja said. </p>
<p>What's more, Pantoja said she felt as though she relived her entire life with Dylan when she drove up to Chicago and met the Aguilar family, whose son, Felipe, had similar medical conditions as Dylan. </p>
<p>Pantoja and Felipe's mom, who now share a deep connection, embraced each other without a second's thought. </p>
<p>"We hugged. We cried. We just couldn't find words," Pantoja said. "But when we looked at each other, we understood each other." </p>
<p>To this day the families stay in contact. </p>
<p>"Sometimes she just needs to blow off some steam," Pantoja said. "Yeah, I remember those days."</p>

<h1>Stop Shop throws retired WWII vet, former employee surprise 100th birthday bash</h1>
<h2>Stop Shop unveiled a veterans-only parking spot in his honor</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>World War II paratrooper jumps from airplane to celebrate his 100th birthday</a></h4> <p>Word War II veteran Tom Rice reflects on his 100th birthday jump on 'The Story'</p></div></div>
<p>A retired WWII vet – who had worked every day up until the coronavirus pandemic struck last year – was <a>honored</a> on his 100th birthday by his former and beloved employer: Stop Shop. </p>
<p>The company wanted to thank Benny Ficeto, not only for his service to this country, but for his dedication to the Edison, New Jersey, store for over a decade. </p>
<p>On Monday, Ficeto was driven to his former store for his very own surprise party. There were droves of extended family members, friends, former associates, a patriotic singing group and even a cake. </p>
<p>What's more, Stop Shop unveiled a veterans-only parking spot in his honor. </p>
<div> <div><p> Benny Ficeto was thrown a surprise party for his 100th birthday by his former Stop amp; Shop. (Stop Shop )</p></div></div>
<p>"Benny's Spot" will help give veterans easy access to the store, Stop Shop spokesperson Stefanie Shuman told Fox News. </p>
<p>"It says in honor of Benny for his service to the store and his country," she said. </p>
<p>For four years, residents of Edison knew exactly where to find the hard-working veteran – bagging groceries at register number four or five, Shuman said. </p>
<p>Prior to that, he worked at a location in Bloomingdale, New Jersey, for eight years.</p>
<p>"People would wait in line even if there was an open register, they would wait because they wanted Benny to bag their groceries," Shuman said. </p>

<p>Ficeto was fulfilled going to work every day and interacting with the customers, his great-nephew Daniel Reynolds and Reynold's girlfriend, Melissa Malley, told Fox News. </p>

<p>"Working at my age gives you purpose," Reynolds and Malley recalled Ficeto saying. </p>
<p>He never wanted to take a break and thought it was "senseless to do so," Reynolds and Malley added. </p>
<p>When the pandemic hit in 2020, Ficeto stopped working but he "never really left the hearts and minds of Stop Shop." </p>
<p>Last year, Stop Shop even threw him a drive-by car parade to mark his 99th birthday. </p>
<p>This year, seeing his 100th birthday party and dedicated parking spot, he was filled with gratitude, Shuman said. </p>
<p>"He knew the day was for him. Every day should be for him in my opinion," Shuman said. </p>
<p>Even though Ficeto is no longer an associate, "he's still part of this family and we will continue to celebrate him." </p>
<p>In fact, they are going to plan his 101st birthday and "every birthday after that," she said. </p>

<h1>Virginia bus driver pulls toddler from traffic, hailed as hero</h1>
<h2>Kelvin White used his reflective vest to help direct drivers away from the child</h2>
<p>A <a>Virginia</a> <a>bus driver</a> has been hailed as a hero after he saved a wandering <a>toddler</a> who almost walked into oncoming traffic. </p>
<p>Kelvin White was driving his route when he saw a little girl pushing a stroller with a stuffed animal towards the street. He stopped his bus and got out to pull the girl to safety. </p>
<p>"I was on the inbound 20, heading into downtown Norfolk, heading down Brambleton Avenue towards the Martin Luther King monument," White told <a>Fox 4 Now</a>. "I saw a little girl wandering the street."</p>
<p><a>UTAH CHILDREN CREATE HEARTFELT NEIGHBORHOOD DISPLAY HONORING 13 FALLEN HEROES</a></p>
<p>White estimated that the girl was no older than 3 years old. </p>
<p>Thanks to his neon vest, he was able to flag oncoming drivers and direct them out of the way until he had the girl to safety. </p>

<p>"By the time I reached her, I was able to get her off from the street," White explained. "Me and another unidentified man went door to door in the neighborhood trying to find maybe the mother or somebody who may know the child."</p>
<p>Through his quick thinking, White was able to save the girl and reunite her with her mom, according to <a>WUSA 9 News</a>. </p>

<p>"I was very grateful for the actions that he took," Alex Brink, White’s supervisor, said. "It was definitely nothing that we would necessarily expect and operator to do."</p>
<p>For his efforts, Brink said the company gave White a new pair of Beats headphones. </p>
<p>White said he will be happy if he never has to pull another child out of traffic again. </p>
<p>"I’m hoping it never happens again, but I’m just glad the little girl is safe," White said.</p>

<h1>WWII vet hits the skies for his 100th birthday</h1>
<h2>Dream Flights was founded in 2011</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>96-year-old WWII veteran sings national anthem</a></h4> <p>John Pylman, a 96-year-old WWII veteran, sang the national anthem before a Minor League Baseball game in Comstock, Michigan, on Aug. 5.</p></div></div>
<p>A WWII Air Force veteran was able to <a>celebrate his 100th birthday</a> back in the sky thanks to a nonprofit "dedicated to honoring seniors and military veterans."</p>
<p><a>Dream Flights</a> teamed up with the Arkansas-based assisted living facility Elmcroft of Mountain Home in order to give Bob Cwiak a present he could have never imagined. </p>
<div> <div><p> Bob Cwiak taking flight for his birthday on Sept. 15, 2021 in Arkansas. (Elmcroft of Mountain Home, provided by Eclipse Senior Living)</p></div></div>
<p>9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS CYCLING FROM NEW YORK TO VIRGINIA FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION</p>
<p>In celebration of his big day Monday, Cwiak was flown in a WWII biplane at the Baxter Regional Airport in Midway, Arkansas. </p>
<p>The veteran told Fox News that he was "taken aback" by the 22-minute experience, saying it brought back memories of his days during WWII. </p>
<p>Cwiak, who eventually became a 1st Lieutenant, and his crew mainly flew missions over Nazi-occupied central Europe. </p>
<p><a>OLDEST US VETERAN OF WWII CELEBRATES HIS 112TH BIRTHDAY</a></p>
<p>"The acceleration of being back in the air was great…the wind in my hair," Cwiak said of Monday's flight. "I would like to be up there again." </p>
<p>It's a wish that will be granted for his birthday every year. </p>
<p>The nonprofit "actually told him when he came down that since he is turning a century old, he gets to go up every year," Katie Hammet, healthy lifestyles director for Elmcroft of Mountain Home, told Fox News. </p>

<p>It's the same aircraft that was used to train military aviators in the late 1930s and early 1940s.</p>
<p><i>Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said Second Wind Dreams was the organization providing the flight. Dream Flights is the nonprofit that provided the flight.</i></p>

<p>When a <a>Michigan</a> police officer pulled over an elderly man for speeding, he likely had no idea he would be at the man’s house later that evening helping set up a TV for the man’s family. </p>
<p>Sterling Heights <a>Police</a> Department released a video of the Sept. 30 traffic stop on Wednesday. It happened on Mount Road and 18 1/2 Mile Road. </p>
<p>In the <a>video</a>, officer Kevin Coates makes contact with the driver, who police identified only as David, 79. Coates asked David what was going on. </p>

<p>"Everything’s going wrong," David said, looking visibly distraught. </p>
<p>David, choking back tears, told the officer his wife has been in bad health, and their adult son is mentally ill. He told the officer he was upset because he bought a new TV for his wife to make her happy but was having trouble hooking it up. </p>

<p>"I really try to drive right," David told the officer. "I bought a new television today because I wanted to make my wife happy, you know, and I can’t get it hooked up." </p>
<p>Coates let David off with a warning and told him he would stop by his home later that evening to help set up the TV. </p>
<p>About an hour later, Coates and two other officers, Remi Verougstraete and Jeremy Jaushevich, arrived at David’s house to help set up the TV and show him how to navigate across channels. </p>
<p>David told the officers that he’s not technically savvy and had it not been for the officers, he would have never been able to set up the TV on his own. </p>
<p>Lt. Mario Bastianelli praised Coates and the other officers for doing an "outstanding job." </p>

<h1>DC tribute to fallen law-enforcement officers draws crowd of thousands to National Mall</h1>

<p>Thousands of candles lit up the night sky at the National Mall in <a>Washington D.C.</a>, on Thursday evening to honor fallen <a>law enforcement </a>officers.</p>
<p>More than 4,000 members of law enforcement and their families attended the candlelight vigil, which <a>paid tribute</a> to 701 officers who died in the line of duty in previous years, including 434 who died in 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>"Today we recognize the nobility of the law enforcement profession. We pay tribute to those who lost their lives in sacrifice of the safety of our communities, and we remember them," <a><u>Homeland Security</u></a> Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said.</p>

<p>Keyworth <a><u>died last month in a car accident</u></a> while responding to a felony offender case near Florence, Mississippi, reports said. </p>
<p>"Yet despite those risks, you run toward danger to protect the public from harm. Your extraordinary courage and dedication is an inspiration for all of us," Garland said. </p>
<p>As the pandemic spread last year, law enforcement and first responders continued to work on the streets. Approximately two-thirds of those who died in the line of duty last year were COVID-related deaths, Garland said. </p>

<p>In addition to the virus, Garland discussed the dangers and challenges to law enforcement as violent crime and gun violence continue to surge across the U.S.</p>
<p>Starting at age 12, he said his mother would tell him to approach an officer, shake their hand and say "thank you."</p>
<p>"Reverence for the men and women of law enforcement remains very much a part of me today," he said. "Let it be so for our entire nation."</p>

<h1>Wounded Army veteran gifted customized all-terrain wheelchair</h1>
<h2>Freedom Alliance is helping veterans regain their mobility and independence with all-terrain wheelchairs</h2>
<p>After 18 surgeries and a below-the-knee amputation, U.S. Army veteran Stephanie Vazquez was <a>given a gift </a>to improve her mobility for the rest of her life. </p>

<p>On Oct. 14, Vazquez became the latest wounded veteran to be honored with a customized wheelchair meant to "help reduce her burden and ease her pain," Tom Kilgannon, the president of Freedom Alliance, told Fox News.</p>

<p>The customized wheelchairs are just one of many ways in which the organization works to "heal the wounds of war" through recreational activities and rehab.</p>
<p>"We do a lot of fishing trips and hunting trips, and those are events to bring veterans together so that they can mentor one another, counsel one another and help one another," Kilgannon said. </p>
<p>The events, however, showed the organization that some veterans, particularly amputees, had difficulty engaging in outdoor activities because of their physical limitations.</p>
<p>Freedom Alliance set out to change that with the all-terrain chairs that are outfitted with treads that look like those on a tank that can handle anything from snow and hills to sand on the beach.</p>

<p>"These are strong-willed individuals, and having a chair like this just allows them to engage in more of the activities they love," Kilgannon said. </p>
<p>It also gives the veterans the ability to complete activities around the house or their property and "do so with a degree of independence that they wouldn't have had," he added. </p>
<p>After Freedom Alliance started providing the wheelchairs, the group recognized the amount of independence the veterans were gaining. </p>
<p>"It is a tremendous feeling of satisfaction to know that you’ve helped to improve another person’s circumstances and make their life a little bit better," Kilgannon said. "It’s the least we can do for those who’ve sacrificed so much." </p>

<p>Corlew said he was 23 years old when he went to work for Daniels in 1973. Now 71, the roadie and righthand has spent the entirety of his adult life with Daniels and the foundation. </p>
