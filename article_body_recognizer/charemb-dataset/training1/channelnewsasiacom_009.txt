<p>The Committee's report said that Mr Singh confirmed that he did not advise Ms Khan to respond to the police, nor did he advise her not to meet the police to answer their questions.</p>
<p>He said that he had told Ms Khan to tell the police that she was going to answer in Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr Singh's account of another meeting on Oct 12 was also different from Ms Khan's. </p>
<p>On Nov 1, Ms Khan delivered a statement in Parliament to apologise for lying, revealing that she had been sexually assaulted years ago.</p>
<p>This was followed by statements from the WP on Nov 1 on Ms Khan's statement and on Nov 2 announcing the formation of a disciplinary panel to look into the statements that Ms Khan had made in Parliament.</p>
<p>When asked if he should have disclosed that Ms Khan had confessed to WP leaders months before, Mr Singh said that he did not think that it was relevant.</p>
<p>On why he then revealed this at WP's press conference on Dec 2, he said that by that time, there had already been questions and "chatter" in the online space as to when and how much the WP leaders knew about Ms Khan’s untruths.</p>
<p>Mr Singh therefore decided to address this issue, as he anticipated that journalists would ask questions about it.</p>
<p>The Committee pointed out to Mr Singh that this "chatter" online had existed for some time and was not new, and Mr Singh agreed.</p>
<p>Mr Singh also denied that he had disclosed their knowledge of her lie because he knew that these facts would also come out in the evidence given to the Committee, which held its hearing with Ms Khan on the same day.</p>
<p>According to the report, Mr Singh said that it was "not relevant for Party members, the CEC and the public to know these facts".</p>
<p>The Committee proceedings will resume on Monday and at least two more witnesses - Ms Lim and Sengkang GRC MP Associate Professor Jamus Lim - are set to be called.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> 'Significant' resources put into investigating former MP Raeesah Khan's claims, say police after Pritam Singh's testimony </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lakeisha Leo </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The police had dedicated "significant" resources into investigating former Member of Parliament (MP) Raeesah Khan's claims, said the Singapore Police Force (SPF) on Monday (Dec 13). </p>
<p>SPF's statement comes after the Workers' Party chief Pritam Singh said at the Committee of Privileges (COP) hearing on Friday that Ms Khan's false claims <a>would not have an "adverse impact"</a> on the work of the police. </p>
<p>The police said they would like to provide clarifications in response to media queries arising from Mr Singh's oral evidence at the Committee of Privileges hearing.</p>
<p>The police noted that Mr Singh had "minimised the possible impact of the false claims" made by Ms Khan. </p>
<p>Ms Khan's claims were made in Parliament on Aug 3, where she alleged that a rape case was mishandled by the police after she had accompanied a victim to the police station. </p>
<p>After the case was mentioned in Parliament on Aug 3, the police said its officers went through many records, including the records of visitors to all police stations islandwide since Jan 1, 2017 to identify the alleged visit. </p>
<p>As officers also considered the possibility that Ms Khan had accompanied a victim without entering a police station, SPF also "combed through" more than 1,400 sexual assault and related cases from 2018 to 2021.</p>
<p>The list was narrowed down to cases which appeared to "somewhat" match Ms Khan's description in Parliament. </p>
<p>The Investigation Officers in charge of the cases were all then asked to check through their investigation records in detail, said SPF, adding that other details were also checked with the officers. </p>
<p>They also checked through all the feedback received from members of the public in 2018, relating to sexual assault. However, no feedback was linked to the case mentioned by Ms Khan. </p>
<p>"The police had dedicated significant resources to investigate into Ms Khan’s claims. Many police officers had been involved in the investigations into the false claims," said SPF. </p>
<h2>"QUANTITATIVE IMPACT" NOT JUST IN MAN-HOURS LOST</h2>
<p>SPF said the "quantitative impact" of such falsehoods was not just in terms of the man-hours lost. </p>
<p>"Public trust in the SPF is integral to our officers’ ability to carry out our mission effectively, to ensure the safety and security of our people. </p>
<p>"If the public whom we serve do not trust us, it would be difficult to secure their cooperation, which is often critical to prevent, deter and detect crime and security incidents," said the police. </p>
<p>They added that false accusations against the police have an impact on the victim's trust and confidence in them, and may deter victims from coming forward to seek help. </p>
<p>"This trust in the police and our close partnership with the community, are among the key reasons for Singapore being one of the safest places in the world," said SPF, adding that they take all allegations against their professionalism seriously. </p>
<p>"When allegations are made, we investigate carefully, and if they are true, we take steps to rectify the mistakes, and minimise the possibility of them recurring," they added. </p>
<p>False allegations such as the one made by Ms Khan will "cast doubt on, and over time, erode public trust" in the police, said the authorities. </p>
<p>"Comments that downplay or dismiss the impact of false allegations against the police, are discouraging.</p>
<p>"They can also affect the morale of our officers, who work hard every day to keep Singaporeans safe and secure," added SPF. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Sylvia Lim says time was needed to structure Raeesah Khan’s clarification after she repeated lie in Parliament: COP report </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>Ms Lim, who is MP for Aljunied GRC, testified on Monday before the COP. The fourth special report on the hearings contains the main points from the testimonies of Ms Lim and of Sengkang MP Associate Professor Jamus Lim.</p>
<p>Ms Lim told the COP that time was needed to carefully structure Ms Khan’s clarification, and make sure that she was comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Ms Lim also cited what happened on Aug 3, when Ms Khan first told the lie in Parliament. At the time, Mr Singh had drafted a clarification for Ms Khan, which she delivered later that same day.</p>
<p>The clarification, in which Ms Khan "said it was Bedok police station and so on and forth" was one which "further told a lie", said Ms Lim in her evidence included in the video of the session, which was also released on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>"So I would say that haste in this circumstance, even on Oct 4, is not wise and we needed to do it calmly and with due deliberation," said Ms Lim.</p>
<p>Ms Lim testified that while she had known from Aug 8 that Ms Khan had lied in Parliament, she was initially not involved in handling the matter.</p>
<p>Ms Lim was also asked about a WhatsApp message that Ms Khan had sent to her assistants Ms Loh Pei Ying and Mr Yudhishthra Nathan, which said that WP leaders had told Ms Khan to "take the information to the grave".</p>
<p>Ms Lim disagreed with Ms Khan’s evidence.</p>
<p>Ms Lim explained to the COP that because WP secretary-general Pritam Singh knew Ms Khan best, and was guiding her, she left it to Mr Singh to follow up with Ms Khan.</p>
<p>Ms Lim was not aware that Mr Singh had gone to see Ms Khan on Oct 3 and only learned of it the next day. Ms Khan and Mr Singh have given contradicting accounts of that meeting.</p>
<p>Ms Khan had told the COP that on Oct 3, Mr Singh had told her there would be "no judgment" from him if she were to "continue" the false narrative.</p>
<p>Regarding this meeting, Ms Lim provided the COP with a copy of the notes she had taken during the WP’s Disciplinary Panel interviews with Ms Khan in November.</p>
<p>She told the COP that these notes were as close to verbatim as possible, and highlighted this exchange between Mr Singh and Ms Khan about the Oct 3 meeting:</p>
<p>Ms Lim was asked for her views on Mr Singh's words: “I told you it was your call”. She said that Mr Singh seems to have told Ms Khan that it was for Ms Khan to decide what to do on Oct 4, if the issue arose in Parliament.</p>
<p>But later in the hearing, "she (Ms Lim) said she could not 'fathom' the possibility that Mr Singh would have given Ms Khan the choice between telling the truth and lying again," according to the COP report.</p>
<p>She had said that the victim came out crying because a police officer had made comments about her dressing and the fact that she had been drinking.</p>
<p>But on Nov 1, Ms Khan admitted in Parliament that she had heard the anecdote in a support group but lied that she had accompanied the victim as she did not want to reveal that she herself had been a victim of sexual assault.</p>
<h2>LIM'S ACCOUNT OF OCT 12 MEETING AT PRITAM SINGH'S HOUSE</h2>
<p>Ms Lim also gave an account of an Oct 12 meeting between her, Ms Khan and Mr Singh at Mr Singh's house. She said that at that meeting, initially, Ms Khan indicated some reluctance to correct the record.</p>
<p>Ms Lim said that she could also not fathom the possibility of Mr Singh giving Ms Khan the option of choosing between telling the truth, or continuing the lie, the report said.</p>
<p>"Ms Lim confirmed that this was the first time that an express commitment was made for Ms Khan to clarify the lie in Parliament," said the report.</p>
<h2>DISCIPLINARY PANEL INTERVIEWS</h2>
<p>After Ms Khan delivered her statement clarifying the untruths in Parliament on Nov 1, WP set up a Disciplinary Panel to look into the issue.</p>
<p>To prepare for this, Ms Khan met the WP Central Executive Committee (CEC) on Oct 29 to discuss her draft statement. This was the first time the CEC found out that Ms Khan had lied in Parliament, according to Ms Lim's testimony.</p>
<p>The CEC was not told that Mr Singh, Ms Lim and WP vice-chair Faisal Manap had been aware of Ms Khan’s lie from Aug 8. They were also the three members of the disciplinary panel set up by WP.</p>
<p>The panel held two interviews with Ms Khan, on Nov 8 and 29. At these interviews, when asked why the untruth was included in the Aug 3 statement, Ms Khan’s explanation was that she was "dissociated" and did not realise what she was doing.</p>
<p>They also talked about the actions Ms Khan was taking to address her psychological needs, and Ms Khan submitted documents from a psychotherapist saying that she was undergoing therapy.</p>
<p>Lastly, they talked about whether and, if so, why Ms Khan wanted to remain in the Party, as an MP and a CEC member, the report said.</p>
<p>The panel also verified that Ms Khan had attended sessions held by a women’s survivor group in 2018 and 2019, as she had claimed.</p>
<h2>WHEN CEC LEARNED OF MATTER</h2>
<p>The evidence given by Associate Professor Lim said that the WP CEC was only informed at an extraordinary meeting on Oct 29 of Ms Khan's lies in Parliament.</p>
<p>He also said that he did not know until much later that Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal had known from August that Ms Khan had lied.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Lim said that apart from what he was told at the Oct 29 meeting, he generally learned of the facts about this matter only when they became public, the report said.</p>
<p>He was asked if, as a member of the CEC, he would have expected the committee to be told that Ms Khan had already confessed to the party leadership in August.</p>
<p>The COP also asked if he expected a disciplinary panel to be "disinterested from the episode and the surrounding circumstances, so that they had no personal interest in the matter which they were supposed to investigate", said the report.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Lim replied that he trusted the party leadership to inform the CEC of all material facts.</p>
<p>"Given that the Party leaders had not told the CEC about their involvement in the matter from an early stage, A/P Lim trusted that these facts were not material," the report said.</p>
<p>According to the summary of his testimony, he said that if Ms Khan had planned to subsequently confess, then her prior confessions to the Party leaders would not have been material.</p>
<p>The proceedings of the COP were adjourned to Wednesday.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Pritam Singh's words 'your call' under scrutiny as WP leader recalled by COP to give further evidence on Raeesah Khan case </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Workers' Party (WP) secretary-general Pritam Singh was recalled on Wednesday (Dec 15) by the Committee of Privileges (COP) to clarify his version of events at an Oct 3 meeting with Ms Raeesah Khan.</p>
<p>This was after <a>WP chair Sylvia Lim on Monday</a> produced a document recording his exchange with Ms Khan at a disciplinary panel meeting on Nov 29.</p>
<p>The COP said in its fifth special report issued on Wednesday evening that Mr Singh was given the opportunity to clarify his evidence following that.</p>
<p>Wednesday's session was a much shorter affair, clocking in at just under 40 minutes, compared to the nine hours of questioning that the Leader of the Opposition <a>faced last week</a>.</p>
<p>The document Ms Lim had submitted to the COP were notes that she had taken during WP's disciplinary panel interview with Ms Khan on Nov 29. It set out an exchange between Mr Singh (PS) and Ms Khan (RK):</p>
<p>PS: Before Oct session, I met you + I told you it was your call. Did need to tell the truth in Parl occur to you? RK: Yes but consumed with guilt + own experience. Thought it wouldn’t come up. PS: Can’t lie right? RK: Yes.</p>
<p>Mr Singh testified that Ms Lim’s notes accurately reflected what he had said to Ms Khan during the disciplinary hearing on Nov 29.</p>
<p>He agreed that the phrase "your call" might be understood that he had, on Oct 3, told Ms Khan that she had to make a choice as to whether to tell the truth or continue to lie, if she was asked on Oct 4 in Parliament.</p>
<p>But Mr Singh said that what he had meant when he said “your call” was that Ms Khan should take responsibility for her work in Parliament. And it had to be "looked at in context".</p>
<a>apologise </a>and clarify that she had heard the anecdote at a support group, but lied that she was with the victim as she did not want to reveal that she had been sexually assaulted at 18 while overseas.
<p>The whole episode led to a complaint to the COP being made against Ms Khan, who has since <a>resigned</a> as MP for Sengkang GRC and from the Workers' Party.</p>
<p>Mr Singh, who had known since Aug 8 that Ms Khan's account was untrue, has also been summoned before the COP to give evidence.</p>
<p>While Ms Khan said that she had been told by WP leaders to "retain the narrative", Mr Singh has testified that he told her to "take ownership and responsibility" for her untruth in Parliament - by which he meant for her to tell the truth.</p>
<p>On Dec 15, Mr Singh told the COP that "It is your call to make" were not the words he had used to Ms Khan on Oct 3, and the words he used did not offer Ms Khan a choice.</p>
<p>He added that Ms Lim’s notes also reflected that he had told Ms Khan at the Nov 29 meeting that she could not tell a lie.</p>
<p>However, he agreed that it was reasonable to construe the words “your call” to mean that it was a choice for Ms Khan to make.</p>
<p>When asked why he used those words to Ms Khan on Nov 29, he said: "I think it was in the context of how she was responding to us.</p>
<h2>PRITAM SINGH ON WHY HE WASN'T MORE DIRECT WITH RAEESAH KHAN</h2>
<p>Mr Singh was also asked why he had not told Ms Khan on Oct 3 to own up and tell the truth in Parliament, and why he had not made things absolutely clear, in direct terms to Ms Khan.</p>
<p>Mr Singh said that he believed he had communicated this message to Ms Khan in his own way, when he suggested to her on Oct 3 to take ownership and responsibility, said the report.</p>
<p>Mr Singh was asked why Ms Loh had this impression from a conversation she had Mr Singh with Oct 12 - that a choice was given to Ms Khan.</p>
<h2>SUMMONS ISSUED TO SINGH, LIM, FAISAL</h2>
<p>The COP had made requests for these documents from Dec 10 to 14 but the WP leaders have failed or refused to produce them, said the release.</p>
<p>Parliament said that the committee’s proceedings have "largely concluded", but it may hear further evidence "if it sees fit". Proceedings have been adjourned to Monday.</p>
<p>"It will present its findings and recommendations to Parliament in due course." </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Was she told to continue with her lie? How video testimonies of Raeesah Khan and Pritam Singh differ </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Workers’ Party (WP) chief Pritam Singh and former Sengkang MP Raeesah Khan have given two starkly different versions of what happened after Ms Khan told a lie in Parliament in an August sitting.</p>
<p>They have shared their accounts with the Committee of Privileges (COP) and the full videos of their testimonies were made available to the public.</p>
<h2> What happened before the COP hearings </h2>
<p>On Aug 3, the Workers' Party raised a motion in Parliament on empowering women. Ms Khan delivered a speech in which she claims she accompanied a victim of sexual assault to a police station, alleging that the police mishandled the case.</p>
<p>In September, Ms Khan came down with shingles and did not attend Parliament.</p>
<p>She was next in Parliament on Oct 4 when Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam asked her to provide more details. She declined to do so, citing the need for confidentiality.</p>
<p>She also said she had not been successful in contacting the victim.</p>
<p>On Oct 20, the police said they had not been able to identify the case of sexual assault that Ms Khan mentioned. They added that Ms Khan did not respond to requests to provide more details.</p>
<p>At the Parliament sitting on Nov 1, Ms Khan made a bombshell admission that she had lied in Parliament about the account, and had not accompanied a victim to the police station as claimed. She also apologised to the Singapore Police Force.</p>
<p>She said she was sexually assaulted when she was 18 and she had lied because she did not want to reveal that she had heard the anecdote in a support group.</p>
<p>Leader of the House Indranee Rajah said she had "no choice" but to raise a formal complaint against Ms Khan for breaching her parliamentary privilege.</p>
<p>On Nov 2, WP announced that it had formed a disciplinary panel to look into Ms Khan's admissions. The panel comprised Mr Singh, party chair Sylvia Lim and vice-chair Faisal Manap.</p>
<p>In the course of its work, the panel invited party members to share their views on the issue before it submitted its report to the central executive committee for deliberation.</p>
<p>On Nov 30, Ms Khan resigned from the Workers' Party and as an MP.</p>
<p>In Ms Khan’s testimony on Dec 2, lasting nearly two hours, she said that WP leaders instructed her to “retain the narrative”, which she interpreted to mean she should keep lying.</p>
<p>She also messaged two of her close associates that Mr Singh, WP chair Sylvia Lim and vice-chair Faisal Manap had told her to take the untruth “to the grave”.</p>
<p>Mr Singh was questioned for about nine hours and he made it clear that no such instruction was given. He said he had told Ms Khan to “take ownership and responsibility” of the matter, and that it was clear to him that meant telling the truth.</p>
<p>Here are snippets of what they have said about key events in the lead up to the COP hearings:</p>
<p>This is Ms Khan’s account of when she first told the WP leaders that she had lied in Parliament:</p>
<p>“The first time that I gave any sense that it was an untruth was on Aug 7, and it was a short phone call, which then was followed by a meeting at Pritam Singh’s house with the chair, Sylvia Lim, and vice-chair Faisal Manap.”</p>
<p>At this meeting on Aug 8, she told them that she had lied in Parliament, and she did so because she did not want to reveal that she had been in a support group for survivors of sexual assault. </p>
<p>Minister for Culture, Community and Youth and Second Minster for Law Edwin Tong, who has been leading the questioning at the COP, asked if that meant “if you can get away with it, we don't have to clarify the lie, correct?”</p>
<p>Ms Khan said: “I think in simple, in the simplest terms, yes, you're correct.”</p>
<p>Ms Khan said there was no exchange of emails, documents or WhatsApp chats that would corroborate her version of this meeting.</p>
<p>In contrast, Mr Singh said there was no decision made for Ms Khan to “retain the narrative”.</p>
<p>He recounted that on Aug 8, Ms Khan started "crying straight away" and told them she was sexually assaulted when she was 18 years old. He said that he, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal were “shocked” to hear this.</p>
<p>He asked Ms Khan if anyone knew about the assault. She said her husband knew and so did her close associates, Mr Yudhishthra Nathan and Ms Loh Pei Ying, as well as her therapist. </p>
<p>Mr Singh added: “The conversation actually was very short. And I told her, I said, you have to speak to your parents about this … She said okay … I mean, she was just crying and crying. And you know, that's where we left it.”</p>
<h2>TEXT MESSAGE: TAKE LIE TO THE GRAVE</h2>
<p>On Aug 8, Ms Khan sent Ms Loh and Mr Nathan, both longtime WP members, a text message in a group chat about her meeting with Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal. </p>
<p>When confronted with the message at the COP hearing, Mr Singh said: “It would be highly inaccurate. It is a complete lie.”</p>
<p>When Mr Tong asked Mr Singh why Ms Khan might have lied, Mr Singh revealed that Ms Khan told the WP disciplinary panel on Nov 29 that she suffers from “disassociation”.</p>
<p>Mr Singh said: “It was the first time I heard of it. I asked her what disassociation was, she said: ‘It's when I talk without thinking.’ And I asked her: ‘Don't you think that's dangerous for an MP?’ And she said: ‘Yes.’”</p>
<p>He then suggested that the COP call for a psychiatric report or evaluation of Ms Khan.</p>
<p>Mr Tong then said: "I was very careful before I started this line of inquiry to ask you if you thought that there was anything untoward, unusual about Ms Khan's performance as an MP."</p>
<p>He said a little later: “I really think It is quite inappropriate to bring that up and to suggest for this committee to seek a psychiatric assessment of Ms Khan.”</p>
<h2>DID PRITAM SINGH LEAVE THE CHOICE TO RAEESAH KHAN?</h2>
<p>There was extensive questioning about a meeting that Mr Singh and Ms Khan had on Oct 3 at her house. This happened a day before a Parliament sitting where Ms Khan repeated the lie when questioned in the House.</p>
<p>Ms Khan said she was told by Mr Singh that “there would be no judgment” if she “continued the narrative”.</p>
<p>Mr Tong asked: "The discussion for you to retain the narrative, and there'll be no judgment. Can you give me your interpretation of that? What do you make of that statement?”</p>
<p>Said Ms Khan: “My interpretation was that there would be no consequences for me to continue the narrative that I had begun … in August.”</p>
<p>“She started getting a bit uncomfortable when I said that. And then I told her, I will not judge you. And ‘I will not judge you’ meant I will not judge you if you take responsibility and ownership.” </p>
<p>Mr Singh was questioned about his choice of words at this meeting several times.</p>
<p>Mr Singh replied: “I think I made that clear to her – you can disagree but that’s my evidence.”</p>
<h2>TO REPLY TO THE POLICE OR NOT?</h2>
<p>Ms Khan also said Mr Singh and Ms Lim directed her not to reply to queries from the police about her anecdote but the party leaders denied that.</p>
<p>Ms Khan said she forwarded an email she received from the police on Oct 7 to them, asking for advice. </p>
<p>He then asked: “To not even reply to the police? Was that something that Mr Singh agreed with? To ignore the police and to not even reply to the police?”</p>
<p>Ms Khan replied: “That was the directive, yes.” </p>
<p>When asked about this by Mr Tong, Mr Singh said he didn't direct Ms Khan not to respond to the police. He also did not tell Ms Khan to respond to the police, but said that Parliament was the right forum to correct the mistake.</p>
<p>“In the course of our communication about the police, the police request, I said: ‘Look, I think this is something that you should correct in Parliament,’” said Mr Singh.</p>
<p>Mr Tong said therefore Ms Khan was right in saying that she was directed by Mr Singh not to go to the police.</p>
<p>Mr Singh is referring to the fact that Ms Khan had sought legal advice on her situation after Oct 4, when she repeated the lie in Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr Singh was called back by the COP on Dec 15 to clarify what he had meant when he said “it was your call” to Ms Khan at a WP disciplinary panel hearing on Nov 29.</p>
<p>Ms Lim had submitted notes that she had taken of that meeting to the COP, containing that exchange, although Ms Khan’s account of that panel hearing did not mention this.</p>
<p>According to Ms Khan, she had called for that meeting because she wanted to explain and reply to remarks made in a prior disciplinary panel meeting on her performance as an MP.</p>
<p>She said: “I outlined my successes and even my challenges as a Member of Parliament, including my work on the ground and in Parliament.”</p>
<p>Mr Tong asked if there was any discussion on her speech containing the false anecdote delivered on Aug 3.</p>
<p>“There was, but the discussion was that I had made a mistake and it had cost the party deeply,” Ms Khan said.</p>
<p>When he asked what her response to that was, she said: “I agree.”</p>
<p>She said that after she left the meeting, her personal decision was that she should resign. She quit the party and as an MP the next day.</p>
<p>Ms Lim was interviewed by the COP on Dec 13 and she highlighted her notes from the Nov 29 meeting where they mentioned the Oct 3 meeting between Ms Khan and Mr Singh.</p>
<p>“And the question was put to her by Mr Singh as follows, he says: ‘Before the October session, I met you and I told you that it was your call, did the need to tell the truth in Parliament occur to you?’ </p>
<p>“And her response was, yes. But I was consumed with guilt and my own experience, and I thought that it wouldn't come up.” </p>
<p>Ms Lim went on: “Mr Singh says to her: ‘You can't lie. Right?’ And then she says: ‘Yes.’”</p>
<p>Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin asked Ms Lim what Mr Singh meant by “it was your call” and if “it was really up to her to decide what to do”. </p>
<p>Ms Lim said: “I don't know the context, but he phrased it in this way.” She highlighted that Mr Singh also said: “But you can't lie. Right?”</p>
<p>Mr Singh said on Dec 15 that what he had meant when he said “your call” was that Ms Khan should take responsibility for her work in Parliament.</p>
<p>"I think the whole, the entire context of the discussion on Oct 3 really comes back to Ms Khan, having to take ownership and responsibility for this issue, which I believe I communicated to her quite clearly.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Raeesah Khan stands by her evidence; psychiatrist says she did not have any disorder that would 'predispose' her to lying: COP report </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>This is Ms Khan's second time appearing before the committee, which is looking into a complaint against her for lying in Parliament.</p>
<p>She admitted that she had lied in Parliament on Aug 3 about a sexual assault case, and had repeated the lie on Oct 4.</p>
<p>She subsequently resigned as an MP and from the WP.</p>
<p>When questioned by the COP on Dec 2, Ms Khan said that she had told WP leaders at a meeting on Aug 8 about the lie and was then told to "retain the narrative", which she took to mean that she should continue lying.</p>
<p>But WP chief Pritam Singh told the COP that this conversation did not take place, and that there had been no discussion during the meeting about whether or how to correct Ms Khan’s untruth.</p>
<h2>"EXTREMELY OUT OF LINE"</h2>
<p>In addition, he suggested to the COP that Ms Khan suffered from "disassociation" due to past trauma and asked that she undergo a psychiatric assessment.</p>
<p>In her testimony to the COP, WP chair Sylvia Lim also said that Ms Khan was "doing things without thinking about what she was doing".</p>
<p>She said that Ms Khan submitted documents to a WP disciplinary panel from a psychotherapist, with indications that Ms Khan was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and that she is undergoing therapy.</p>
<p>The Office of the Clerk of Parliament said in a press release on Wednesday that the Committee invited Ms Khan to undergo a psychiatric assessment.</p>
<p>She agreed and saw Dr Christopher Cheok, acting chief and senior consultant at the department of forensic psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health, on Dec 17 and Dec 20.</p>
<p>Responding to the claims by Mr Singh and Ms Lim about her mental state, Ms Khan said that it was "extremely out of line" for them "to have used mental illness as a means to discredit someone", according to the summary.</p>
<p>"Mr Singh had tried to paint a picture of her as someone who was mentally unstable, when she was of sound mind," said the report from the COP summarising the key points of Ms Khan's testimony.</p>
<h2>"TAKE IT TO THE GRAVE" SAID BY MR SINGH: KHAN</h2>
<p>On what happened at an Aug 8 meeting with Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal Manap, Ms Khan said that their evidence was untrue.</p>
<p>According to her, the words “take it to the grave” were used by Mr Singh, in front of Ms Lim and Mr Faisal. She said that this was not a phrase she would "ordinarily use", the COP report said.</p>
<p>She added that there was no discussion during the meeting on whether she should disclose the sexual assault to her father and family, which Mr Singh claimed he had told her to do.</p>
<p>Mr Singh and Ms Khan had also given differing accounts of an Oct 3 meeting at her house, a day before the Parliament sitting where she repeated her lie when questioned by Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam.</p>
<p>Ms Khan had earlier told the COP that during this visit, Mr Singh told her that if she kept to her existing narrative, there would be "no judgment".</p>
<p>But Mr Singh said he told Ms Khan that “if the issue came up”, Ms Khan had “to take responsibility and ownership of the issue”, and if she did so, he “will not judge” her.</p>
<p>Ms Khan said that Mr Singh had never said the words “take ownership and responsibility” to her, nor did he tell her to clarify the lie in Parliament.</p>
<h2>LIED AGAIN AS MR SINGH DID NOT REPLY TO HER MESSAGE</h2>
<p>On the day of the Oct 4 Parliament sitting, Ms Khan sent Mr Singh a message, asking: “What should I do, Pritam?”.</p>
<p>When asked about this, Ms Khan said that she was waiting for Mr Singh to respond to her message, to give her guidance about what she should do. As Mr Singh did not reply to her, she lied again.</p>
<p>Later that night, sometime past 11pm, Ms Khan met Mr Singh and Ms Lim in the office of Leader of the Opposition.</p>
<p>Mr Singh previously said that Ms Khan was "in a daze" and had said: “Perhaps there is another way. That is, to tell the truth.”</p>
<p>Ms Khan agreed that she said those words, but disagreed that she had been "in a daze" when she said those words.</p>
<p>Ms Lim had said that Mr Singh responded by asking Ms Khan if she "hadn’t already chosen a path", the report said.</p>
<p>Ms Khan testified that she was "shocked" by Mr Singh’s response because there was "no intention or directive" from him to tell the truth at the time, said the COP report.</p>
<p>Ms Khan told the committee that Mr Singh had not presented her with a choice on Oct 3, but had told her that "if she continued the narrative, he will not judge her", the report said.</p>
<h2>DOES NOT HAVE DISSOCIATION</h2>
<p>She told the committee that she did not say she had disassociation. She clarified that she mentioned to the WP disciplinary panel that she may have symptoms of PTSD.</p>
<p>When asked what symptoms they were, she said one of the symptoms was dissociation, but had never said that this was something that she was going through.</p>
<p>Dr Cheok explained that dissociation is a symptom, not a medical diagnosis. It refers to the loss of the integrative function of the mind, and may be experienced by normal people in different situations, said the report.</p>
<p>"Dr Cheok said that Ms Khan did not suffer from any psychiatric disorder that would predispose her to telling untruths," added the report. </p>
<p>"Having been in practice for more than 25 years, he said that persons with psychiatric disorders do not generally tell untruths more frequently than any other human being."</p>
<p>The Office of the Clerk of Parliament also said that in response to the summons issued by the Committee on Dec 15, Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal produced "certain documents" on Dec 20.</p>
<p>They each signed a confirmation that they had produced before the Committee the documents requested, it added.</p>
<p>Dr Cheok also said that Ms Khan did not have PTSD and did not suffer from "any significant or material dissociation during the material period".</p>
<p>"While Dr Cheok did not deny that Ms Khan had some symptoms of being psychological traumatised, he was of the view that the symptoms did not reach the threshold of a psychiatric disorder," said the COP report.</p>
<p>"In his view, it was a normal reaction for someone who had gone through a traumatic experience, to continue to have some anxiety when speaking about the topic. This did not mean that the person would be mentally impaired or incapacitated."</p>
<p>He testified that her judgment and decision-making capacity was not impaired and that she was of sound mind.</p>
<p>Dr Cheok was also asked if it was possible that Ms Khan’s judgment could have been affected by the trauma, in a way that caused her to have “false memory creation”.</p>
<p>He reiterated that Ms Khan did not suffer from dissociation and that in his assessment, when Ms Khan spoke of her assault, she was "not affected to an extent that caused her to lose her mental capacity".</p>
<p>He was then asked whether a person who is suffering from trauma, while still generally high functioning, could be "capable of sending out a message that selectively contained a lie".</p>
<p>"Dr Cheok said that generally it is possible but there also may be other explanations why a person may give a falsehood. However, in the specific context of Ms Khan, Dr Cheok disagreed with this possibility," said the COP report.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Tuesday (Dec 21) sent condolences to his counterparts in Malaysia and the Philippines over the recent natural disasters in both countries.</p>
<p><a>More than 20 people have died in Malaysia</a>, while about 70,000 people have been forced from their homes, after days of torrential rain triggered some of the worst flooding in years across the country at the weekend.</p>
<p>Dr Balakrishnan said in his letter to Malaysian Minister of Foreign Affairs Saifuddin Abdullah that "Singapore stands in solidarity with Malaysia during this difficult time”.</p>
<p>"I am saddened by the tragic loss of lives and devastation caused by the floods in several parts of Malaysia," he said. </p>
<p>"I extend my deepest condolences to the families of the victims and all Malaysians whose livelihoods have been affected.</p>
<p>"The Malaysian government is swiftly mounting relief efforts, and I am confident that the Malaysian people will overcome this crisis with strength and fortitude," he added.</p>
<p>He also sent a letter expressing condolences to the Philippines’ Secretary of Foreign Affairs Teodoro Locsin Jr.</p>
<p>“It is distressing that so many families have lost their homes, livelihoods and loved ones, especially with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” Dr Balakrishnan wrote.</p>
<p>“Singapore stands ready to provide any assistance required by the Philippines during this difficult time. </p>
<p>"Our thoughts are with the people of the Philippines during this difficult time, and I wish the Philippines strength and fortitude to overcome this natural disaster," he added.</p>
<p>The Singapore Red Cross has pledged a combined US$100,000 (S$136,772) in humanitarian aid to the two countries following the natural disasters.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked Singaporeans in the affected areas to monitor local news closely and heed the instructions of the local authorities.</p>
<p>They are also advised to keep in touch with family and friends, as well as to eRegister with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Former Johor chief minister Osman Sapian dies </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>JOHOR BAHRU: The former chief minister of Johor Osman Sapian has died, Bernama reported. </p>
<p>Mr Osman died on Tuesday (Dec 21), aged 69. </p>
<p>He was admitted to the KPJ Johor Specialist Hospital on Oct 13 after suffering a mild stroke, and later treated at the Universiti Putra Malaysia Teaching Hospital in Selangor. </p>
<p>His brother Mr Aziz Sapian said Mr Osman died at his son's home in Kuala Lumpur. “I was informed of his death by one of our siblings," he told Bernama. </p>
<p>Mr Osman was Johor chief minister from May 2018 until April 2019. </p>
<p>He was also an assemblyman for Kempas and Bersatu chief for Ayer Hitam at the time of his death. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Flood situation improves in Shah Alam as waters recede; number of evacuees in several states drops </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR: The flood situation was reported to be improving in Shah Alam, Selangor, on Wednesday (Dec 22) with water level in the badly hit areas starting to subside, local media reported.</p>
<p>Authorities have begun to pump out flood waters in Taman Sri Muda, Shah Alam, since Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bernama reported that the process was running smoothly despite heavy downpour around Shah Alam on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>“The water has receded even though it rained at 4am,” said National Disaster Management Agency director-general Aminuddin Hassim, as quoted by Bernama.</p>
<p>He said the Department of Irrigation and Drainage would be digging drains at several sites to speed the movement of water to the nearby river.</p>
<p>“Water has already subsided but there is water below 0.3m in some areas,” he said, adding that flood waters were still at about 0.6m to 1m deep in Taman Damai Section 25.</p>
<p>Fourteen bodies have been found in Taman Sri Muda so far following the serious floods caused by incessant heavy rain since last Friday, according to Astro Awani. </p>
<p>Flood waters in the area were slow to recede because the sluice, which controls the flow of water into the river, was jammed, according to reports quoting Selangor executive councillor Izham Hashim. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, the state government announced that the sluice was able to operate again with electricity restored. </p>
<p>“With the sluice in operation, water will recede faster, God willing,” Chief Minister Amirudin Shari wrote on his Facebook. </p>
<p>Other than Selangor, several other states in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia such as Pahang, Negeri Sembilan and Perak, were also affected.</p>
<p>Death toll in both Selangor and Pahang was reported to be 34 on Tuesday. </p>
<h2>NUMBER OF EVACUEES DROPPED</h2>
<p>The number of evacuees has dropped in Pahang, Selangor, Perak and Kelantan as of Wednesday noon, while the total remained unchanged in Melaka and Terengganu. </p>
<p>According to Bernama, the number of flood victims seeking shelter at relief centres in Pahang fell to 38,810 from 42,529.</p>
<p>In Selangor, the Disaster Info portal of the Social Welfare Department reported that 21,047 evacuees were being housed at 117 relief centres, down from 23,633 evacuees at 128 relief centres.</p>
<p>Victims have complained that the government has been slow to act, and Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob admitted that there were weaknesses in coordination efforts. </p>
<p>In a statement posted on Istana Negara’s Facebook page on Tuesday, Malaysian King Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah urged the government agencies to be more proactive in rescue and aid efforts.</p>
<p>The king also asked the people to pray for a quick end to the floods and inclement weather hitting the country, Bernama reported. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the impact of the flood disasters was being assessed, Permatang Pauh MP Nurul Izzah Anwar called for the government to provide higher compensation for the victims. </p>
<p>She said each four-person household requires at least RM30,000 (US$7,100) in stages to meet their multidimensional needs. </p>
<p>The government has promised a cash aid of RM1,000 to each affected household. Factoring in other allocation and donation, each household was estimated to receive RM6,600. </p>
<p>“One question remains – is this estimated RM6,600 per household enough?” she said, calling on the National Recovery Council to look into the next step to assist the 71,000 individuals affected by the floods.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Former Malaysian PM Mahathir discharged from National Heart Institute </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR: Former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad was discharged from the National Heart Institute (IJN) at 11.30am on Thursday (Dec 23).</p>
<p>In a statement, IJN said Dr Mahathir, 96, underwent a series of medical investigations and was ready for discharge as planned.</p>
<p>Dr Mahathir and his wife Dr Siti Hasmah Mohamad Ali expressed their thanks to people for their concern and prayers over the last week, the statement said.</p>
<p>The former prime minister was admitted to hospital on Dec 16 for a <a>full medical check-up and further observation</a>.</p>
<p>The institute said on Tuesday that the team of doctors treating Dr Mahathir <a>was "satisfied"</a> with the results of the investigations, and that all necessary investigations have been completed.</p>
<p>Dr Mahathir, Malaysia's longest-serving prime minister, has a history of heart troubles. He has had heart attacks and bypass surgeries.</p>
<p>The nonagenarian served as prime minister for 22 years from 1981 and 2003.</p>
<p>He returned as prime minister at the age of 92 after leading the opposition coalition to a historic win in 2018, defeating the party that he once led. His government <a>collapsed in less then two years</a> due to infighting.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Malaysia government under fire over slow clean-up after deadly floods </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SHAH ALAM: Malaysia's government was under fire on Monday (Dec 27) as residents accused it of <a>responding too slowly</a> after the country's <a>worst floods in years</a>.</p>
<p>Days of torrential rain caused rivers to overflow last week, swamping cities, forcing tens of thousands of people to <a>flee their homes</a>.</p>
<p>Damaged appliances and soaked furniture were piled up on the streets and outside homes in flood-hit areas as residents and volunteers continued a massive clean-up drive.</p>
<p>Many were frustrated with the authorities.</p>
<p>"I am angry. There is no assistance from the government ... We need cash to rebuild our lives," said Asniyati Ismail, who lives in a residential enclave in Shah Alam, the capital of Selangor state.</p>
<p>"There is mud everywhere, everything has been destroyed," she told AFP as her two children helped her clean.</p>
<p>The mounds of rubbish left in the area after the floods have also sparked fear of disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>Selangor, which encircles the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, was the state hit hardest by the floods.</p>
<p>Many in Shah Alam were left stranded in their homes with barely any food for days, before being evacuated on boats in a chaotic rescue operation.</p>
<p>"The government has been absolutely slow in the rescue mission," resident Kartik Rao told AFP.</p>
<p>"And now they are slow in the clean-up operation. Even after seven days, the rubbish in this neighbourhood has not been cleaned up."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob has admitted <a>"weaknesses" in the flood response</a>, but has pledged improvements in future.</p>
<p>Malaysia is hit by floods annually during the monsoon season, from November to February, but the ones this month were the worst since 2014.</p>
<p>They have left at least 48 people dead and five missing across Malaysia, officials said.</p>
<p>Global warming has been linked to <a>worsening floods</a>.</p>
<p>Because a warmer atmosphere holds more water, climate change increases the risk and intensity of flooding from extreme rainfall.</p>
<p>Kawitha Maratha, 39, and her four children were rescued by a boat after floodwater rose rapidly to the second floor of their house in Shah Alam.</p>
<p>"The flood has destroyed our lives," she said.</p>

<p>Dr Balakrishnan was hosted to lunch by Johor ruler Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar on Thursday, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).</p>
<p>During his audience, Dr Balakrishnan conveyed an invitation from Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to Sultan Ibrahim to make an official visit to Singapore in the near future. </p>
<p>Dr Balakrishnan also called on Johor Crown Prince Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, said MFA in a statement. </p>
<p>In a Facebook post on Thursday night, Dr Balakrishnan said that the vaccine delivery was made to the Johor state government through the Sultan of Johor's foundation, the Yayasan Sultan Ibrahim Johor. </p>
<p>During his trip, Dr Balakrishnan also met Johor Chief Minister Hasni Mohammad and discussed the recently launched Singapore-Malaysia vaccinated travel lanes (VTLs). </p>
<p>Dr Balakrishnan and Johor's leaders also "exchanged views on new areas of cooperation" between Singapore and Johor. These include the establishment of the Johor Economic, Tourism and Cultural Office in Singapore next year.</p>

<h1> Singapore tightens rules for VTL travellers, requiring them to take COVID-19 tests for 7 days on arrival </h1>
<div> <p>Travel restrictions have also been extended to more countries as Singapore steps up measures against Omicron.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Michael Yong </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: All travellers entering Singapore on vaccinated travel lanes (VTL) will soon have to take COVID-19 tests daily for seven days on arrival as the country tightens measures against the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>This means there will be additional swabs on top of the current requirement for a pre-departure test, an on-arrival polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, as well as supervised antigen rapid tests (ARTs) on day 3 and day 7 of their visit.</p>
<p>The new testing requirement will take effect on Dec 6, 11.59pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on Friday (Dec 3).</p>
<p>It will remain in place for four weeks "in the first instance" until 11.59pm on Jan 2, 2022, the ministry added.</p>
<p>The additional tests - on days 2, 4, 5 and 6 - are self-administered and will be done using ARTs. Travellers must submit their results online using a link that will be sent to them via their declared contact details.</p>
<p>On days 3 and 7, the ARTs will be done in a supervised setting at a Combined Test Centre or Quick Test Centre.</p>
<p>"Day 3 is the median incubation period, and day 7 is the day of exit from this testing protocol," said MOH. </p>
<p>"During this seven-day period, other than on days when they go out for their supervised tests, these travellers must test negative on their self-administered ART before going out for activities on that day."</p>
<p>This new testing regime will also apply to travellers arriving from Malaysia using the land VTL from 11.59pm next Monday. These travellers already have to take a pre-departure test and on-arrival ART.</p>
<h2>ANTIGEN RAPID TESTS EFFECTIVE IN DETECTING OMICRON</h2>
<p>The new testing regime comes amid concerns over the new Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Singapore detected its first two cases earlier this week, when two imported cases tested <a>"preliminarily positive"</a> for the variant. The National Public Health Laboratory is conducting whole-genome sequencing to confirm the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>"We have also been closely monitoring studies on the sensitivity of ARTs to the Omicron variant," said MOH. </p>
<p>"Preliminary validation by the manufacturers show that ARTs remain effective in detecting COVID-19 cases of the Omicron variant, and laboratories are doing further biochemical tests to confirm these results," it added.</p>
<p>"These initial results lend confidence that ARTs remain effective as a method of detecting COVID-19, including Omicron cases."</p>
<p>The Health Ministry also announced on Friday that Singapore will extend travel restrictions to more countries that have seen a spike in Omicron cases.</p>
<p>From 11.59pm on Dec 4, all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to Ghana, Malawi and Nigeria within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter or transit in Singapore.</p>
<p>“This restriction will apply to those who have obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore,” said MOH.</p>
<p>“We will apply these restrictions for four weeks in the first instance, after which we will review and extend them if necessary.”</p>
<p>Seven countries – Bulgaria, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway and Poland – will be placed in Category 3 from 11.59pm on Dec 6.</p>
<p>Travellers from Category 3 countries have to take a pre-departure COVID-19 test within two days before departure for Singapore.</p>
<p>They will be tested on arrival and are required to do a 10-day stay-home notice at a declared place of accommodation. A PCR test will be done before the end of the stay-home notice.</p>
<h2>NO EVIDENCE OMICRON SYMPTOMS MORE SEVERE</h2>
<p>There is currently no evidence to suggest that symptoms associated with the Omicron variant are different or more severe than those of other variants, or that current vaccines and therapeutics would be ineffective against the new variant, said MOH.</p>
<p>It noted that more data and further studies are needed.</p>
<p>The ministry said it expects to see more Omicron cases being reported globally in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>"Should the Omicron variant be more transmissible than Delta and become the globally dominant variant over time, it is a matter of time before it establishes itself in Singapore," it added. </p>
<p>"But the additional measures will help to buy time to learn more about dealing with Omicron, and to continue with our booster programme to strengthen our collective resilience for better protection against this new variant."</p>
<p>MOH said it might need to introduce or adjust its measures "at short notice" in response to the "fluid" situation.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: The Singapore-Malaysia vaccinated travel lane (VTL) <a>via the Causeway</a> will be expanded to allow more groups of people to travel between both countries.</p>
<p>From Dec 20, Singapore citizens will be able to enter Malaysia, and Malaysia citizens will likewise be able to enter Singapore, the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) said in a press release on Tuesday (Dec 14).</p>
<p>There will be no change to the <a>current test protocols</a> in Singapore and Malaysia, added MTI.</p>
<p>All travellers entering Singapore will have to abide by the prevailing test protocols and safe management measures, which include the post-arrival 7-day COVID-19 antigen rapid test (ART) regime.</p>
<p>The first phase of the <a>land VTL </a>between Singapore and Malaysia had begun late last month, on the same day as the air VTL between <a>Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport</a>.</p>
<p>There are currently 32 bus trips each way across the Causeway daily. The buses have a maximum capacity of 45 "fully seated" passengers per trip.</p>
<p>That means the daily quota for the land VTL scheme at present is about 2,900 travellers in total, with 1,440 passengers each way.</p>
<p>Handal Indah similarly operates 32 daily trips between Larkin Sentral Bus Terminal and Queen Street Terminal in Singapore.</p>
<p>But under the initial land VTL arrangement, travellers must be citizens, permanent residents or long-term pass holders of the country that they are entering.</p>
<p>Thus, entry into Singapore via land VTL is limited to Singapore citizens, Singapore permanent residents and Singapore long-term pass holders. </p>
<p>Entry into Malaysia via land VTL is for Malaysians, Malaysian permanent residents and Malaysian long-term pass holders.</p>
<p>The Malaysian trade ministry said in a separate statement on Tuesday that designated bus operators will offer tickets to meet increased demand, subject to the prevailing health situation.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated children below the age of 12 are also permitted to enter Malaysia via the land VTL, provided that they are accompanied by vaccinated parents or guardians, added the ministry. </p>
<p>Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Tuesday, Minister for Trade and Industry Gan Kim Yong noted that the new move would allow individuals to visit family members across the border.</p>
<p>He added that the authorities will continue to review the land VTL to see if it can be expanded, for example, to include other modes of transport.</p>
<p>“One possibility I mentioned earlier was via train and it's something that we continue to discuss with Malaysia on how we can expand to additional modes of transport,” said Mr Gan, who is co-chair of the multi-ministry task force.</p>
<p>“And this will also have to take into account the infection situation in both countries ... and when we have additional information, we will give an update to the public as well as to the media.”</p>
<p>At the press conference, the task force was also asked about the criteria for border measures to be tightened against countries experiencing a rapid spread of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Multi-ministry task force co-chair Lawrence Wong said that Singapore already has an established framework that is "quite well settled" when it comes to general border control measures.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Travellers and tourism providers frustrated after countries ‘overreacted’ to Omicron </h1>
<div> <p>In just three weeks since the new coronavirus variant was first reported, the damage has been done to the travel industry and the tourist experience, writes business and travel journalist Raini Hamdi.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Raini Hamdi </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: I was packing for my trip just before news of the Omicron outbreak threatened to upend travel.</p>
<p>Arriving in Thailand from Singapore on Nov 30, it felt like catching the last train to my destination, as countries began announcing closures of borders and fresh restrictions to stem the spread.</p>
<p>It was complicated paperwork. But once I was out of the airport, I felt a great sense of satisfaction, as if I had just completed some obstacle course.</p>
<p>But with countries changing rules since Omicron reared its head, she has postponed the trip until June.</p>
<p>Caught off-guard, she was worried that costs would rise astronomically, with countries likely to want more PCR and antigen tests to be done before allowing entry.</p>
<p>“I’ve also read reports of tourists in (South) Korea caught by sudden changes in COVID-19 regulations, which led them to be refused entry to restaurants and more. This is the last thing I want happening on my holiday.”</p>
<h2>HOW NECESSARY ARE TIGHTENING TRAVEL RULES REALLY?</h2>
<p>Omicron is the first test of what countries would do if faced with a new variant of concern when they have already vaccinated people, picked up lessons on how to treat COVID-19 and said they would learn to live with the virus.</p>
<p>Yet now, travellers must navigate a new mixed bag of rules - bans on visitors from certain places, additional PCR tests, quarantine reinstatements, rearrangements of green, yellow and red lists or categories, you name it.</p>
<p>There was confusion when South Korea announced a 10-day quarantine for all inbound travellers from Dec 3. It then retracted a little, saying VTL passengers from Singapore were an exception, relieving the agony of those with bookings.</p>
<p>Malaysia too announced on Dec 2 a temporary ban on travellers from 26 countries under its Langkawi tourism bubble. The next day, it clarified the ban was only on eight African countries.</p>
<p>This is a sorry turn from two months ago when signs were strong that the world, bar Fortress China, was taking steps to make travel normal again.</p>
<h2>UNCERTAINTY CHOKING TRAVEL REOPENING</h2>
<p>The reality is it may take more time to confirm Omicron’s true colours, though health experts are veering towards the view that Omicron is highly transmissible, but not a cause for panic.</p>
<p>Top United States scientist Anthony Fauci said on Dec 7 that Omicron “almost certainly is not more severe than Delta” and “there’s some suggestion that it might even be less severe”.</p>
<p>The best-case scenario, Fauci said, is a more transmissible virus that does not cause more severe illness and does not lead to a surge of hospitalisations and deaths.</p>
<p>But can countries stay shut for a final verdict? Not really. The WHO has said that vaccination, not travel curbs, is the key to battling Omicron.</p>
<h2>KEEPING BORDERS OPEN THE EXCEPTION NOT THE NORM</h2>
<p>The thing is, Omicron can only undo carefully laid travel plans if countries let it.</p>
<p>Close shaves demonstrate the ramifications one rule change can make. </p>
<p>Thailand reopened on Nov 1 and was on the verge of replacing PCR tests with antigen tests but scrapped the plan owing to Omicron. </p>
