<div><div><p><b>* </b><a><b>Winter weather advisory</b></a><b> 9 tonight through 7 a.m. Friday *</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Key points</b></p></div></div>
<li>Snow set to arrive within about an hour of midnight and end between 4 and 5 a.m.</li>
<li>A brief burst of heavier snow is possible between about 1 and 3 a.m.; roads will become slick as temperatures fall below freezing.</li>
<li>Accumulations of 1 to 3 inches are most probable (see map under “amounts” section below); we expect some school delays and cancellations Friday morning.</li>
<div><div><p><b>5:45 p.m. — Light snow arrives in western Maryland and eastern panhandle of West Virginia</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be posted around 7:30 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4:10 p.m. — Forecast is on track as snow spreads into West Virginia</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Radar shows snow falling over most of Kentucky and West Virginia as the storm system sweeps eastward. The snow is still set to arrive in our area between around 11 p.m. and 1 a.m., or maybe a little later in our eastern areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Nashville, where 4 inches has fallen from this system, it’s the snowiest day since Jan. 22, 2016, according to AccuWeather.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest models continue to show 1 to 3 inches falling over the immediate D.C. area; here are some of the latest projections for the District based on simulations run in the past hour:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>High-resolution NAM: Around 3 inches</li><li>NAM: 2-2.5 inches</li><li>HRRR: 1.5-2 inches</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>We should note that the National Weather Service did lower its projections slightly, from 2 to 3 inches from 3 to 4 inches, and they are now pretty consistent with ours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be around 5:45 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Original forecast from 12:30 p.m.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most of us sleep overnight, a high-altitude weather disturbance will zip across the Mid-Atlantic, coating the Washington and Baltimore area in snow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should develop about midnight and end by about 5 a.m. Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amounts may vary between about one and four inches over the region, but around two inches should be most common. Because temperatures will fall into the 20s as the flakes fall, many roads will become slick and treacherous.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s the possibility of a brief burst of heavy snow between about 1 and 3 a.m., falling at the clip of about an inch an hour, limiting visibility and making travel difficult.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mid-Atlantic, Northeast brace for burst of snow Friday morning</p></div>
<div><div><p>Although the snow will end well before sunrise, untreated roads will probably be slippery for the Friday morning commute, so we expect school delays and cancellations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Amounts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Computer model snowfall projections have edged slightly lower since Wednesday night, so we have shaved an inch off the most likely amounts in the immediate area, from two to four inches to one to three inches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While we don’t expect a lot of regional variability in accumulation, we would generally lean toward the higher amounts north and west of Washington and somewhat lower totals to the south and southeast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The track of this disturbance is farther north than Monday’s storm, so the jackpot totals will also probably be farther north.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s how much snow is forecast for Washington by the different models:</p></div></div>
<li>American (GFS): 4 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution NAM: 2 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution Canadian: 2 inches</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Timeline and temperatures</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should move in between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. from west to east and end between 4 and 6 a.m., lasting only four to five hours in any one location.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The window for a possible burst of heavier snow is between about 1 and 3 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>10 p.m. to midnight:</b> Snow develops in our western areas. Temperatures: 30 to 35.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Midnight to 2 a.m.:</b> Snow begins in our eastern areas, while increasing in intensity to the west. Temperatures: 30 to 34 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2 a.m. to 4 a.m.:</b> Snow lightens in western areas, while picking up to the east. Temperatures 26 to 31.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4 a.m. to 6 a.m.:</b> Snow decreases in eastern areas and ends everywhere from west to east. Temperatures 25 to 29.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Temperature ranges shown above are lowest in our northwest areas (Loudoun and Frederick counties) and highest to the southeast (Stafford County, Fredericksburg and southern Maryland).</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Impacts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But as many neighborhood roads may well be untreated through rush hour, we do expect widespread school delays and some cancellations. Also, with temperatures holding at or below freezing on Friday, little will melt.</p></div></div>
<div><p>We don’t expect wind to be a big issue with this system Thursday night. However, as the system pulls away Friday morning, winds will become gusty, blowing the snow around a bit and creating bitter wind chills in the teens and 20s.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The consistency of the snow may start off as a bit heavy and wet, but it should turn more powdery as temperatures fall. The risk of power outages is low.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Could the ‘D.C. snow hole’ return with this event?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While one to three inches of snow seem most likely, and locally heavier amounts are possible, there’s also the possibility of just a dusting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We sometimes see this circumstance in the D.C. area with storm systems coming in from the west, and it has been given the endearing name of the “D.C. snow hole.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Around downtown Washington, the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay, some snow accumulation may also be lost because of melting, as temperatures may be a little above freezing as the snow develops before slowly falling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How might we see a snow ‘boom’?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the snow hole scenario is possible, there’s also a way for snowfall to exceed expectations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some models have even shown an elevated unstable layer that could briefly enhance snowfall rates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The big forecast problem is whether and where any bands of heavier snow occur.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Where’s the snow? Eastern U.S. left wondering as midwinter approaches</h1></div>
<h2>More warmth is expected through at least the first week of January, but there’s still time until the Northeast enters what is normally the snowiest part of winter</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ian Livingston</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 29, 2021 at 2:30 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Across the Northeast, snowfall is about as low as it gets approaching the new year. The big cities, from Boston to Washington, have yet to see anything substantial, and there’s nothing imminent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There could still be a while to go until the situation changes much, as the large-scale weather pattern remains slow to change.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The flakes have been few</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>where snowfall is generally running zero to 10 percent of normal through late December.
<div><div><p>The only areas closer to average in the Northeast are parts of the Green and White mountains of New England and across far northern Maine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below is season-to-date snowfall through Dec. 29 for some Interstate 95 cities, compared with average in parentheses.</p></div></div>
<li><span><b>Portland, Maine: </b>12.1 inches to date (15.3 inches on average)</span></li>
<li><span><b>Boston:</b> 0.4 inches to date (9.2 inches)</span></li>
<li><span><b>New York City: </b>0.2 inches to date (5.2 inches)</span></li>
<li><span><b>Philadelphia:</b> Trace to date (3.5 inches)</span></li>
<li><span><b>D.C.: </b>0.0 inches to date (1.8 inches)</span></li>
<a>meteorologist Eric Fisher</a>, those slow-starting seasons ended with below-average snow totals. In short, the beginning of this season does not bode well if history is an indicator.
<div><div><p>It’s not just the urban corridor, either.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Why so little snow?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>data from the Southeast Regional Climate Center</a>.
<div><p>The warmth alone is a big part of the lack of snow. In many places outside of higher elevations, snowfall averages through December are a small chunk of the seasonal tally. In other words, early-season warmth is often a dealbreaker.</p></div>
<a>Areas of drought</a> have been expanding out of the Carolinas and into the broader Mid-Atlantic.
<a>La Niña winter</a> like the one we are in, the flexes — in combination with West Coast storminess — have been extra impressive this season.
<div><div><h3><div>Snow chances should increase in the new year, somewhat</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Major changes in the current<b> </b>pattern are likely to be hard to come by in the shorter term. Renewed rounds of cold and snow in the<b> </b>West and more warmth in the<b> </b>East seem likely through at least the first week of January.</p>
<div><div><p>Fickle stuff.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So even without perfection, odds should grow ahead. Keep those snow dances going.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Hospitals also want protection from liability lawsuits, he said, because they are operating in a “catastrophic health emergency.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“All the help that we can get is going to be welcomed,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hogan, he noted, had a call Tuesday morning with the state’s multiagency <a>coronavirus</a> task force. “Additional actions will be taken as needed in line with the data and the science,” Ricci said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C., Maryland and Virginia emerge from Christmas weekend with record coronavirus case numbers</p></div>
<div><div><p>Maryland on Tuesday also resumed reporting covid-19-related deaths after a more than three-week pause because of <a>a cybersecurity breach</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the week leading up to Christmas, about 164 Marylanders died of covid-19, with the state’s more rural and less-vaccinated counties seeing dramatic increases in deaths per capita.</p></div></div>
<a> recent reports from medical experts </a>indicate that healthy people who have been vaccinated, and especially those who have been boosted, seem unlikely to develop severe infections from the omicron variant that would land them in the hospital.
<p>“A look at deaths over time—especially comparing last year’s wave to this one—is another indicator that #VaccinesWork,” Ricci tweeted, noting that this week last year, there were 44 deaths, compared with 18 this week.</p>
<div><div><p>Officials across the region report that they are trying — and often struggling — to keep up with the high demand for tests driven by the surging case numbers and holiday travel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Loudoun County, a line of cars and SUVs began forming outside a free drive-through testing site at 8 a.m., prompting officials there to begin the testing more than an hour before the scheduled 10 a.m. start time.</p></div></div>
<div><p>David Goodfriend, Loudoun’s health director, said the county is working with its private contractor to increase the number of tests that will be available for another drive-through testing event planned for Thursday at the park.</p></div>
<div><p>“We want to meet that demand as well as we can,” he said. “But they’re also seeing demand in other places. So, it’s a challenge for them as well to be able to provide a larger number of tests.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If a test is available, take advantage of it,” Goodfriend said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Montgomery County, meanwhile, testing volume has nearly doubled since the week before Thanksgiving, said health department spokesperson Mary Anderson.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The county in late November was averaging about 3,500 tests per week; last week, it averaged 2,500 tests a day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At some points last year, Montgomery had as many as six county-run test sites, but some resources have since had to be redirected to the vaccination effort, Anderson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In addition, many of the staff at both testing and vaccination sites were school health nurses, who have since returned to their jobs at the county’s school system.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Alexandria, people started lining up outside the Beatley Central and Duncan Branch library locations before they opened at 10 a.m., waiting to get a rapid antigen test.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our phones won’t stop ringing,” Knight said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The library is excited to be a part of the solution,” Knight said about the program. “Other than running out, it’s been very successful.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>He shared a commonality with several other children in the room, and even some of the adults: He’s not the biggest fan of needles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But did it hurt?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No, not at all,” said Hector, 14, who wore a shirt embroidered with the D.C. flag. “I was actually surprised — I didn’t feel it.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Cooper More, 13, was brimming with excitement. He has multiple birth defects and a chronic condition that required him to stay more vigilant than most, spending nearly all of his time at home in the past year to avoid the virus.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He was relishing the thought of attending baseball games and spending more time out of the house with his brother, 15-year-old Turner, who also received his first shot Thursday.</p></div></div>
