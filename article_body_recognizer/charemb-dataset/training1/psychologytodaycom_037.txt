<div> <div> <h1>Treatment of Depression</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Studies repeatedly show that psychotherapy is at least as effective as medication, and the most effective treatment for many people may be a combination of both.</p>
<li> Does depression ever go away on its own? </li>
<h2> Does depression ever go away on its own? </h2>
<h2> When does depression need treatment? </h2>
<a>Signs that depression is responding</a> include less irritability, increased energy, feeling less overwhelmed, normalization of appetite, improved ability to concentrate, return of libido, and improved sense of self.
<h2> What is treatment-resistant depression? </h2>
<a>multiple types of medications</a>, used singly and in various combinations, fail to significantly improve symptoms or create side effects that are intolerable.
<h2> What does psychotherapy do? </h2>
<a>identify the problems that trigger their depression</a> or contribute to its continuation.
<h2> How do antidepressant drugs work? </h2>
<a>affect those neurotransmitters</a>, such as norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine and others belonging to a class of chemicals known as monoamines.
<h2> When is ketamine used? </h2>
<h2> Do psychedelics help depression? </h2>
<a>renewed scientific interest </a>in psychedelic agents as treatments for depression, especially depression accompanied by suicide ideation.
<a>Ongoing clinical trials</a> show that in carefully monitored settings, the substances, which broaden and deepen consciousness, can dramatically boost the effectiveness of psychotherapy for major depression, facilitating
<a>self-awareness</a> and speeding behavior change. Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy actually seems to motivate people to change, and brain imaging studies of treated patients show durable changes in brain connectivity patterns.
<a>microdosing psychedelics</a>— regularly taking small doses of such agents as a way to maintain mood and general mental health while avoiding the hallucinogenic effects.
<h2> What does brain stimulation, or neuromodulation, do? </h2>
<a>stimulating specific components of brain circuitry</a>. Neuroimaging studies have repeatedly demonstrated functional abnormalities in networks linking such key areas of the brain as the hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex.
<div> <h3> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) </h3> </div>
<h2> What are the major types of brain stimulation? </h2>
<a>target brain circuits involved in attention</a>, perception, learning, and memory that affect mood.
<p>• In deep brain stimulation, reserved for highly treatment-resistant depression, an externally programmable device is implanted in the chest to deliver electrical signals to targeted sites in the brain. It is like a pacemaker for the brain.</p>
<p>• Intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) is a noninvasive form of brain stimulation approved for use in treatment-resistant depression.</p>
<h2> How do I know which treatment is best for me? </h2>
<h2> Are brain scans useful in determining treatment? </h2>
<a>such use is very much for research purposes</a>, In general, scanning does not yet provide enough specificity or utility for personalizing therapy.
<h2> Are there things I can do on my own to relieve depression? </h2>
<h2> What's the best way to help someone who has depression? </h2>
<a>pitch in on the chores</a> of daily living that usually seem overwhelming to someone with depression.
<h2> What are the most effective natural treatments for depression? </h2>
<a>Singing in a chorus</a> is known to boost mental health; both the singing and the socialization affect autonomic nervous system reactivity to stress. Religious involvement is another proven stress buffer.
<h2> Why is exercise important? </h2>
<h2> How much physical activity is recommended to stave off depression? </h2>
<a>exercise restores a sense of control</a> over one’s life. Studies show that even 15 minutes of physical activity daily—
<a>start somewhere</a>—doing anything is better than doing nothing— and to start small, beginning with a few minutes of walking.

<h2> What are the major signs of depression? </h2>
<p>• Feelings of sadness, emptiness, or hopelessness</p>
<p>• Irritability, angry outbursts, or low frustration tolerance</p>
<p>• Loss of interest in or ability to enjoy usual activities, from sex to sports</p>
<p>• Sleep disturbance, whether inability to sleep (insomnia) or sleeping too much (hypersomnia)</p>

<p>• Difficulty concentrating, remembering things, and making decisions</p>
<p>• Recurring thoughts of death</p>
<p>• Physical pain such as headaches or back pain that has no clear cause.</p>
<h2> I feel hopeless and empty. Am I depressed? </h2>
<a>there is no way out</a> of such a mental prison. But thoughts are not facts, and the distorted cognitions of depression are changeable through psychotherapy.
<h2> Why do I have no interest in sex? </h2>
<a>relationship difficulties depressed people experience</a>.
<h2> Can depression sometimes show up as agitation? </h2>
<h2> What does it mean to be clinically depressed? </h2>
<h2> How does depression differ from sadness? </h2>

<h2> What is the course of depression? </h2>
<h2> At what age are people most likely to get depressed? </h2>
<a>those in Generation Z </a>(born between 1995 and 2015) are especially prone to depression and anxiety because they have been overprotected by parents and shielded from opportunities to develop skills for coping with life’s inevitable stresses.
<h2> Are people more prone to depression later in life? </h2>
<a>less likely than others to have a family history of depression</a>; there’s evidence that curtailment of daily activities is a significant precipitating factor.

<h1> We’ve Got Depression All Wrong. It’s Trying to Save Us. </h1>
<h2> New theories recognize depression as part of a biological survival strategy. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Depression? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist to overcome depression</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>The common wisdom is that depression starts in the mind with distorted thinking, leading to "psychosomatic" symptoms.</li>
<li>Some researchers now see depression as stemming from an immobilization response—a biological defense against stress.</li>
<li>When one gets stuck in an immobilization response indefinitely due to ongoing threat, the body and brain develop symptoms known as depression.</li>

<a>adaptive response to adversity</a> and not a mental disorder. In October, the British Psychological Society published a
<a>new report</a> on depression, stating that “depression is best thought of as an experience, or set of experiences, rather than as a disease.” And neuroscientists are focusing on the role of the autonomic
<a>nervous system</a> (ANS) in depression. According to the
<a>Polyvagal Theory</a> of the ANS, depression is part of a biological defense strategy meant to help us survive.

<p>Laura’s father was so perceptive, that he could tell when she felt rebellious on the inside even when she was hiding it. And he punished her for those feelings.</p>
<p>Looking back, Laura does not regret her <a>childhood</a> depression. She values it. Going through her own healing process and working with her therapist helped her see how depression served her.</p>
<h3>Depression Starts With Immobilization</h3>
<p>Sometimes the threat is so bad or goes on for so long, that the nervous system decides there is no way to fight or to flee. At that point, there is only one option left: immobilization.</p>

<p>So the immobilization response is a key part of the biological defense, but it is ideally designed to be short-term. Either the metabolic shut down preserves the organism, i.e. the rabbit gets away, or the organism dies and the fox eats the rabbit.</p>

<h2> What does it mean to be in recovery? </h2>

<p>Many people recover from eating disorders and go on to lead healthy, fulfilling lives. For a smaller number, however, the disorder doesn’t abate.</p>

<h2> What leads to a successful recovery? </h2>
<p>Another crucial component is a <a>strong support system.</a> Successful recovery often encompasses loved ones who encourage the individual to eat, continue treatment, talk through challenges, and strive toward their larger goals.</p>
<h2> What is the role of relapse in recovery? </h2>
<p>The road to recovery is not one smooth process—it very <a>often includes slips and relapses.</a> But it’s important to continue moving forward despite those difficult setbacks.</p>
<h2> What are the warning signs of a relapse? </h2>
<li>Departing from an eating schedule, such as by skipping occasional meals.</li>
<li>Developing a renewed obsession with food, weight, and appearance.</li>
<li>Adopting a new restrictive diet.</li>
<li>Avoiding eating with other people.</li>
<li>Lying about meals, food, or other choices.</li>
<li>Returning to rigid eating patterns, such as avoiding particular foods or eating only at certain times of the day.</li>
<li>Checking the body continuously, such as by weighing or measuring.</li>

<li> When is inpatient treatment necessary? </li>
<h2> When is inpatient treatment necessary? </h2>
<p>It can be difficult to know how to help someone with an eating disorder; in addition to being painful to understand and discuss, the severity of the condition varies widely.</p>
<p>However, if you are concerned for someone’s immediate safety, such as if their physical health has deteriorated, seek medical attention or call 911.</p>
<h2> What are different types of treatment for eating disorders? </h2>
<a>Enhanced Cognitive Behavior Therapy as well as Family-Based Treatment.</a> Clinicians may also practice therapies of other kinds, such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, or Psychodynamic Therapy.
<h2> What is Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy? </h2>
<a>CBT-E was created specifically to treat eating disorders.</a> It encompasses a personalized treatment approach, addressing the thoughts that maintain the disorder and leading the individual to decide for themselves to maintain a healthy weight.
<p>Clinical trials show that CBT-E <a>effectively treats eating disorders</a>; however, further research is needed to determine whether it is consistently more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<h2> What Is Family-Based Treatment? </h2>
<p>Family-Based Treatment (FBT) is a leading treatment for adolescents with eating disorders. It’s also referred to as the Maudsley method, named for the British hospital where it was created in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The approach incorporates the entire family. It helps parents support their children to eat and restore a healthy weight. In this process, parents assume control over the child’s eating before gradually shifting that power back to the child.</p>
<a>more appropriate for some families than others.</a>
<h2> Do any medications treat eating disorders? </h2>
<p>Medications may be prescribed to address relevant symptoms, such as anxiety or depression. But there are currently <a>no drugs approved to treat eating disorders.</a></p>
