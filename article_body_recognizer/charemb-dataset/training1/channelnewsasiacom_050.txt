<p>Some estimates suggest the PLA is now not just numerically superior, but technologically on a par with Taiwan, meaning that a war across the Taiwan Strait would likely end in China’s favour.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: China’s cheap drones are finally taking off, with many uses and huge implications</a></h3>
<p>But such studies ignore the reality that even a relatively successful invasion of Taiwan will require a bloody, costly campaign.</p>
<p>Taiwan sits 100 miles off China’s coast, across open water where Chinese vessels would be vulnerable to missile and torpedo attack. </p>
<p>China would likely lose tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of troops, to say nothing about the impossible task of pacifying an island of 23.5 million Taiwanese who would likely resist Chinese occupation.</p>

<p>For the CCP, regaining Taiwan is a defining priority, but losing a war over Taiwan is a regime-threatening event.</p>
<p>The alternative, and less risky, path to war for Beijing is therefore to use a strategy that has been successful elsewhere: Salami slicing.</p>
<p>In salami slicing, small, incremental changes are made to move towards a larger goal. Those small changes are insignificant enough to fall short of a reason for war, but when added together start to definitively change the facts on the ground.</p>
<p>In China’s near-seas, this process has involved a massive increase in the patrols of Chinese military, paramilitary and commercial vessels, island reclamation and more overflights of aircraft.</p>
<p>These tactics work on land and sea – on its mountainous border with India, China has built a string of villages in disputed territory to create a fait accompli of occupation.</p>

<p>In the 60 years prior to this, just one intentional crossings of the median line had occurred; now they are commonplace. In September 2020, 37 aircraft crossed the line. </p>
<p>And Chinese aircraft crossed into Taiwan’s air defence identification zones a record 380 times in 2020, the most since the 1996 Taiwan Strait crisis. On Apr 13, the largest incursion yet, of 25 aircraft, occurred.</p>
<p>Such flights are becoming so commonplace Taiwan has stopped scrambling jets to every Chinese incursion. It has become too costly to do so. By October 2020, Taiwan had scrambled 2,972 times against Chinese aircraft that year.</p>
<p>Beijing has already started to shift the expectations of behaviour and created a new normal where the presence of Chinese military aircraft and vessels is routine, even expected.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: China's boycott of HM, Nike and other big brands is really bizarre</a></h3>
<p>It is not the main island of Taiwan at most risk of such salami-slicing tactics, but Taiwan’s outlying islands such as Penghu, Matsu, Kinmen and Pratas.</p>
<p>With small populations and at a distance from the main island, these are vulnerable to greater pressure campaigns from China, whether grey-zone tactics or a more militarised operation.</p>
<p>Would Washington react militarily if China occupied one of the smaller Kinmen islands – an uninhabited rock just 10 km off China’s coastline – in a bloodless operation?</p>
<p>What if it were not military personnel but Chinese “fishermen” that set up camp there? Would it not be challenging to justify a military response to such a small non-military change?</p>
<p>The threat of war from China should not be ignored – reunification with Taiwan would be a crowning moment for any Chinese leader and the PLA is explicitly geared toward an offensive against the island.</p>

<h1> Commentary: China and the US are becoming firm frenemies </h1>
<div> <p>The call between Biden and Xi reinforced the new reality for Sino-US relations, with selective collaboration and broad competition, says Christian Le Miere.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Christian Le Miere </a> </div> </div>
<p>HONG KONG: One thing the COVID pandemic has brought us all are lengthy online meetings that seem to go on forever. </p>
<p>On Tuesday (Nov 16) Beijing time (Monday evening in Washington DC), the two most powerful men in the world experienced exactly what the rest of us have soldiered through for nearly two years. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden and President Xi Jinping engaged in a 3.5-hour long, virtual direct conversation, their first (albeit digital) face-to-face discussion since Biden became president in January. </p>
<p>The meeting was the most definitive moment for framing the Sino-US relationship over the course of the coming administration. </p>
<p>With Xi having been all but confirmed as serving a third term at the sixth plenum last week, this means Biden and Xi will likely be dealing with each other for at least three more years. </p>
<h2>RED LINES AND GUARDRAILS</h2>
<p>Substantial deliverables were almost entirely lacking from the meeting, despite its length and the build-up beforehand with lower-level officials meeting, namely US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Politburo member Yang Jiechi. </p>
<p>An agreement on the lifting of visa restrictions for some journalists was reached, which should allow those previously denied access to or ejected from either country to return. </p>
<p>Beyond this, there were no significant agreements reached. The two sides agreed to consider negotiations in a more structured format over the issue of nuclear weapons limitations. </p>
<p>A key example was the topic of Taiwan, which has been at the centre of Sino-US tension in recent months. </p>
<p>Both sides laid out their red lines on Taiwan, with Biden underlining that the US does not wish to see the status quo changed by unilateral action, while Xi noted that advocates of Taiwanese independence were “playing with fire”.</p>
<p>This understanding should, in theory, help ensure, as Biden noted, that the “competition between [these two[ countries does not veer into conflict, whether intended or unintended.”</p>
<p>Each requires cross-border cooperation, and thus have been identified previously in Washington as potential areas for collaboration between China and the US, despite current levels of tension. </p>
<p>This was further demonstrated just a week before the Biden-Xi meeting with a high-profile bilateral agreement between the two superpowers at COP26.</p>
<p>Whether concrete actions to collaborate will be reached is still uncertain, but both sides were keen to emphasise the greater momentum behind such a scenario in the wake of the talks. </p>
<p>The Biden administration will be wary of previous backsliding by Beijing on promises made, but sees little option other than to seek to engage on those issues where China’s involvement is paramount to policy success.</p>
<p>Perhaps just as important as the substance of the meeting – collaboration around certain cross-border issues and red lines around others – was what failed to make it on to the agenda in a meaningful way. </p>
<p>Neither side in their respective readouts and briefings after the call mentioned current US sanctions and tariffs on China. </p>
<p>This is perhaps the best indicator of where Sino-US relations lie. Those tariffs when first implemented by the Trump administration were surprising, even shocking to observers. </p>
<p>But now they have been accepted as standard US policy towards China, with little indication they are likely to be removed, or even be used as bargaining chips. </p>
<p>There may not yet be any guardrails on this competition, but this clearer path to greater dialogue and selective cooperation should lower the temperature and curtail any slide towards conflict. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Putin says Russia does not want conflict but needs 'immediate' guarantees </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MOSCOW: Russia wants to avoid conflict with Ukraine and the West, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday (Dec 23), but needs an "immediate" response from the United States and its allies to its demands for security guarantees.</p>
<p>Ukraine is at the centre of soaring East-West tensions after the United States and Kyiv accused Russia of weighing a new attack on its southern neighbour, an allegation Moscow denies.</p>
<p>Putin was plied with questions about the risk of conflict with Ukraine during his marathon annual news conference, which lasted over four hours.</p>
<p>"This is not our (preferred) choice, we do not want this," he told reporters.</p>
<p>Tensions over Ukraine have pushed Moscow's relations with the West to their lowest point since the collapse of the Soviet Union some 30 years ago.</p>
<p>The United States, the European Union and the Group of Seven have all warned Putin he will face "massive consequences" including tough economic sanctions in the event of any new Russian aggression.</p>
<p>But in a separate reply, Putin grew more heated when recalling how NATO had "brazenly tricked" Russia with successive waves of expansion since the Cold War, and said Moscow needed an answer urgently.</p>
<p>"You must give us guarantees, and immediately - now," he said.</p>
<p>A Biden administration official in a call with reporters said Washington has taken note of the concerns that Moscow has raised and was ready to engage with Russia as soon as early January but a specific date and location were yet to be set.</p>
<p>Speaking on condition of anonymity, the administration official repeatedly said the United States would not negotiate publicly and that it would provide its full response to Russian proposals in January.</p>
<p>"We just directly posed the question that there should be no further NATO movement to the east. The ball is in their court, they should answer us with something," Putin said.</p>
<p>Putin accused Ukraine of breaking its commitments under a 2015 deal meant to halt fighting in its eastern Donbass area between Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces, and refusing to talk to representatives of two breakaway regions there.</p>
<p>There were no casualties from those incidents, it said.</p>
<p>Four sources have told Reuters that Russian mercenaries have deployed to separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine in recent weeks to bolster defences against Ukrainian forces.</p>
<p>The Biden administration official also welcomed the move, but called it a "small step" and added that Washington would be looking for follow-through.</p>
<p>Ukraine rejects Putin's stance that Moscow is just a mediator in the conflict, accusing it of providing direct backing to the separatist side. It has repeatedly offered direct talks with Russia, which Moscow has so far rejected.</p>
<p>Putin made clear he did not see President Volodymr Zelenskiy as a negotiating partner, accusing him of falling under the influence of what he called radical nationalist forces.</p>
<p>"How can I build a relationship with the current leadership, given what they are doing? It's practically impossible," he said.</p>
<p>Many of Russia's security proposals, which would require the withdrawal of US and allied forces from central and eastern European countries that joined NATO after 1997, are seen as non-starters in the West.</p>
<p>But the United States and NATO have said they will discuss the package with Russia early next year, aware that outright rejection could further inflame the crisis over Ukraine.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> 'Keep the defender guessing': Russia's military options on Ukraine </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MOSCOW: Russia's deployment of tens of thousands of troops to the north, east and south of Ukraine is fuelling fears in Kyiv and Western capitals that Moscow is planning a new attack. Russia denies any such plans.</p>
<p>Western military analysts have suggested that Russia cannot keep such troops deployed where they are indefinitely due to financial and logistical issues and would need to pull them back by the summer of next year.</p>
<p>Estimates of the numbers of new Russian troops moved closer to Ukraine vary from 60,000 to 90,000, with a US intelligence document suggesting that number could be ramped up to 175,000.</p>
<p>US officials have warned Russia might launch a new attack against Ukraine as early as the second half of next month when the ground will be harder, making it easier for tanks and other armour to move swiftly.</p>
<p>But what might a Russian attack actually look like and what could it seek to achieve?</p>
<p>"The current deployments are versatile. They keep Russia's options open and therefore keep the defender guessing," said Keir Giles, an Associate Fellow at Chatham House.</p>
<p>Here are some possible scenarios.</p>
<p>Heavily armed Russian-backed separatists have controlled a swath of eastern Ukraine since 2014 and continue to exchange fire with Ukrainian government forces on a regular basis despite a 2015 ceasefire that ended major hostilities.</p>
<p>The conflict in Donbass has killed 15,000 people, Kyiv says. Ukraine has long accused Russia of having regular troops in the region, something Moscow denies.</p>
<p>Russia in turn has accused Kyiv of harbouring plans to retake the region by force, something Ukraine denies.</p>
<p>In such a febrile atmosphere the risk of a misunderstanding or unplanned escalation is greater, and Russia could use such an incident as a casus belli.</p>
<p>"That would put the Ukrainian government under a lot of pressure," he said.</p>
<p>Russia has brought in new forces to Crimea, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and said this week paratroopers would be holding new drills there.</p>
<p>Forces would secure control of a Soviet-era canal that provided Crimea with fresh water supplies until Russia annexed the territory and Ukraine stopped the flow.</p>
<p>"This of course would be the most costly economically, politically and in terms of human lives and that's probably why it's least likely," Melvin said of an all-out invasion.</p>
<p>Analysts said even if it overwhelmed Ukraine's army, which is half the size of its own, Russia could face guerrilla-type resistance that would make it hard to hold on to captured territory.</p>
<h2>MISSILE STRIKES OR CYBER-ATTACK</h2>
<p>Giles said some scenarios could involve long-range missile attacks or cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructure. Missile attacks would take advantage of Ukraine's weaker anti-missile defences.</p>
<p>"The different scenarios for how exactly Russia might seek to persuade the West to meet its (security) demands by punishing Kyiv don't even necessarily include a land incursion," he said.</p>
<div> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h5> Putin says Russia has 'nowhere to retreat' over Ukraine </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Putin says Russia has 'nowhere to retreat' over Ukraine </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday (Dec 21) that Russia had no room to retreat in a standoff with the United States over Ukraine and would be forced into a tough response unless the West dropped its "aggressive line".</p>
<p>Putin addressed the remarks to military officials as Russia pressed for an urgent US and NATO response to proposals it made last week for a binding set of security guarantees from the West.</p>
<p>"What the US is doing in Ukraine is at our doorstep ... And they should understand that we have nowhere further to retreat to. Do they think we’ll just watch idly?" Putin said.</p>
<p>"If the aggressive line of our Western colleagues continues, we will take adequate military-technical response measures and react harshly to unfriendly steps."</p>
<p>Russia rejects Ukrainian and US charges that it may be preparing an invasion of Ukraine as early as next month by tens of thousands of Russian troops poised within reach of the border.</p>
<p>With Western powers keen to show Russia they are solid in their support of Ukraine and NATO, Germany's new Chancellor Olaf Scholz also spoke by phone with Putin.</p>
<p>In the meantime, she said, the United States would continue to send military equipment and supplies to Ukraine in the weeks and months ahead - something that has antagonised Moscow.</p>
<p>"As President (Joe) Biden has told President Putin, should Russia further invade Ukraine, we will provide additional defensive materials to the Ukrainians above and beyond that which we are already in the process of providing," she said.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would seek meaningful discussions with Moscow early next year.</p>
<p>He offered no evidence in support of the claim, which Pentagon spokesman John Kirby described as "completely false".</p>
<p>Throughout the crisis, Russia has veered between harsh rhetoric, calls for dialogue and dire warnings, with Ryabkov repeatedly comparing the situation to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when the world stood on the brink of nuclear war.</p>
<p>Many of its demands, including for a block on NATO membership for Ukraine and the withdrawal of US and other allied troops from Eastern Europe, are seen as non-starters by Washington and its partners.</p>
<p>But rejecting them out of hand would risk closing off any space for dialogue and further fuelling the crisis.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> South Korea to restore tougher curbs against spike in COVID-19 infections </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SEOUL: South Korea said on Thursday (Dec 16) it will reinstate stricter social distancing rules a month and a half after easing them under a "living with COVID-19" policy, as the number of new infections and serious cases spirals.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated people can only dine out alone, or use takeout or delivery services.</p>
<p>The measures come as South Korea's daily coronavirus tallies and the number of serious cases continue to make new records amid a persistent spike in breakthrough infections, adding to strains on the country's medical system.</p>
<p>"We're making all-out efforts to overcome the pressing crisis by expanding our medical capacity and vaccination campaign, but we need time," Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum told an intra-agency meeting.</p>
<p>"We can go beyond this crisis only by beating down the current spread as soon as possible through strong social distancing."</p>
<p>Associations of small business and restaurant owners issued a series of statements protesting the decision and calling for measures to compensate their losses. One of the groups vowed to stage a rally next week.</p>
<p>Kim said the government will soon announce plans for "even larger financial support" for the businesses.</p>
<p>President Moon Jae-in offered an apology for having failed to restrain the virus' spread and secure sufficient hospital beds during the earlier easing process, his spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 7,622 cases for Wednesday, a day after posting a new record daily count of 7,850.</p>
<p>The number of serious cases hit another fresh high at 989, with about 87 per cent of intensive care unit beds taken up in the Seoul metropolitan area and about 81 per cent in use nationwide.</p>
<p>More than 92 per cent of South Korean adults are fully vaccinated, but the number of new cases has surged nearly five-fold since the rules were eased last month, while the number of serious cases has tripled.</p>
<p>Daily numbers of cases <a>shot past 7,000 for the first time</a> last week, just days after surpassing the 5,000 mark.</p>
<p>KDCA director Jeong Eun-kyeong said the daily tally could top 10,000 this month if the upturn is not blunted.</p>
<p>Total infections rose to 544,117, including 148 cases of the potentially more transmissible Omicron variant, with 4,518 deaths, the KDCA said.</p>

<p>SELANGOR: Malaysians were out in force to lend a hand to those affected by catastrophic floods in the populous Klang Valley area.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday (Dec 21), more than 20 people have died across the country, while more than 65,000 people have been displaced from their homes. </p>
<p>The organisation also mobilised boats and pickup trucks to ensure that the food is delivered to flood victims in rural areas across the Klang Valley. </p>
<p>The organisation’s vice president Jasbir Kaur told CNA that she was pleasantly surprised by how the unfortunate incident has galvanised Malaysians to help one another in time of need. </p>
<p>"Malaysians from all walks of life - Malay, Chinese, Indian - everyone packing, cooking, loading and distributing food," said Ms Kaur. </p>
<p>"There is equality here. Everyone is working in harmony and it is beautiful to see after such a difficult time," she added. </p>
<p>She explained that Gurdwara Sahib Petaling Jaya was running a food bank for flood victims and that the meals are vegetarian and halal. </p>
<p>One of the volunteers was 35-year-old Suraya Barakbah, who told CNA that she just wanted to help the flood victims by packing food and basic necessities like sanitary pads, clothing and blankets.</p>
<p>"Everyone is here, from different races and religions. Everyone who is here just walks in and does whatever is needed. I don't feel restricted here," said Dr Suraya who is from Sarawak.</p>
<p>Over at Kampung Kenangan in Subang Jaya, Selangor, the waters have receded and residents were returning to their homes to assess the damage. Some of them were seen washing mud off their vehicles and carpets. </p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur resident Asyraf Suhaimi was seen distributing packets of groceries to residents from his car.</p>
<p>Mr Asyraf told CNA that he and a small group of friends decided to pool some money together and buy items such as rice, milk powder and cooking oil. </p>
<p>"It wouldn't cover the financial losses they’ve sustained to their homes and appliances, but we are hoping it would at least give them some respite during this trying time," said Mr Asyraf.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, three days after the torrential rains, some people were still reportedly stranded and awaiting rescue. There have also been complaints on social media that the authorities have been slow to act and deliver aid.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said on Tuesday that there were <a>weaknesses in the government's flood response</a> and promised improvements going forward. He also said that the flood situation in Selangor was unexpected. </p>
<h2>JOHOR DEPLOYS SOUTHERN VOLUNTEERS TO SELANGOR</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, over at Hulu Langat, Selangor, which is among the most affected areas, around 37 members of the Southern Volunteers under the Johor government have been deployed to send humanitarian aid and help with cleaning efforts. </p>
<p>“These include basic everyday items such as mineral water, diapers, biscuits and bread,” said Mr On.</p>
<p>He added that the Southern Volunteers were discussing with the Selangor state government on what other help may be required during the second and third phases of recovery efforts, which involve cleaning and rebuilding works.</p>
<p>Mr On explained that even though Johor was not impacted by the floods this time round, it was important for the state to show solidarity with fellow Malaysians and extend help in this time of need. </p>
<h2>POLITICIANS ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES</h2>
<p>Politicians have also rolled up their sleeves and hit the ground to personally render assistance.</p>
<p>Bangi Member of Parliament Ong Kian Ming wrote in a Facebook post how he had used his kayak to rescue 40 residents at the badly-hit Taman Sri Muda area. </p>
<p>"Because I am an experienced kayaker (about 20 trips along Sungai Klang, Gombak and Hulu Langat over the past six years), I was able to bring my kayak solo into Taman Sri Muda," according to Mr Ong. </p>
<p>"I made about 15 trips over a 4-hour period when I rescued about 40 people. The rest of my team rescued about 20 people. It was a very tiring effort as I was the only person kayaking in my kayak," he added.</p>
<p>Senior Minister in charge of International Trade and Industry Azmin Ali also tweeted photos and a video of him heading down to affected areas in his Gombak constituency to extend help. </p>
<p>Wearing yellow boots, he could be seen in a video shovelling muddy water out of a home. </p>
<p>"Affected residents have been shifted to temporary relief centres. Help will always be extended to them, including basic necessities and medical aid," he wrote on social media.</p>

<p>SELANGOR: In her 20 years living at Kampung Melayu Subang in Selangor, Marniza Othman had never experienced any floods. </p>
<p>But at around 4pm on Saturday (Dec 18) afternoon, she noticed small gushes of water entering her living room from the front door, alongside some centipedes and cockroaches. </p>
<p>In just 20 minutes, the water level reached her knees, and that was when Ms Marniza realised the situation had become “serious”. </p>
<p>"I asked my two older children to stand on dining chairs while I held the youngest, my 2-year-old, close to me," said Ms Marniza. </p>
<p>"I was so scared I would lose them, I kept telling them, ‘You can do it,’" she added. Her husband had gone out to seek help.</p>
<p>Before the water level reached her waist, thankfully, her husband arrived to escort the entire family to his mother's home, a kilometre away. </p>
<p>“I just took my children’s clothes, our phones and wallet. Everything else, we left behind,” said Ms Marniza. </p>
<p>“I’ve not been back since, but I’m certain, almost everything we own is gone,” she added. </p>
<p>Marniza was among thousands of Malaysians who have been displaced from their homes following continuous heavy rain on Friday and Saturday. </p>
<p>On Sunday morning, the rain had subsided when CNA visited several residential areas in the states of Negeri Sembilan and Selangor.</p>
<p>Many of these areas were flooded and residents were forced to evacuate to disaster relief centres or to stay at the homes of friends and relatives. </p>
<p>At Meru Klang in Selangor, Muhammad Riduan Abdul Rahman also had to leave his home and valuables as he sought shelter at a friend’s home. </p>
<p>He told CNA that as of 5pm on Saturday, the water level at his home had gone above his knees. </p>
<p>“I took only things I absolutely needed and left. It was too dangerous to stay put,” Muhammad Riduan told CNA. </p>
<p>“The rest - TV, washing machine, fridge - all of it was swept away. It's all gone, finished,” he added. </p>
<p>He said that RM50 million will be channelled to the National Disaster Relief Fund for disbursement; with each flood-hit household to receive RM1,000.</p>
<p>He also reassured residents that evacuation centres will have sufficient basic amenities such as face masks and food for those who are sheltering there. </p>
<p>Among those who were transported to an evacuation centre was Khamsani Yusof, whose rural hometown in Kampung Bukit Lanchong, Selangor, was among the worst-hit areas. </p>
<p>Rows of houses were partially submerged in muddy waters. Only the roof of cars could be seen as debris such as clothes, shoes and household items floated around. </p>
<p>Traffic lights and lamp posts were also not functioning. Army officers were seen on an inflatable rescue boat, patrolling the village in search of stranded residents. </p>
<p>Some of the residents who were earlier rescued stood on elevated ground along a busy highway, holding pieces of luggage. </p>
<p>“It’s really sad to see our home destroyed like this,” said the 49-year-old. </p>
<p>“We’ve lived here for 15 years. Everything was destroyed in two days.” </p>
<p>The family had lost their two cars, television, fridge and their tin-roofed kampung house to the floods. </p>
<p>Khamsani said they were waiting for a government bus to take them to a nearby relief centre to stay. </p>
<p>Over at Pekan Pantai, near Seremban, the state of Negeri Sembilan, the storm had caused trees to topple, blocking key roads. </p>
<p>Businessman Heng Xian Zheng told CNA that he was driving down a winding hilly road when a tree suddenly fell due to the strong winds, crashing 5 metres in front of him. </p>
<p>“It was so close, luckily I jammed my brakes in time,” said Mr Heng. </p>
<p>The incident led to a traffic jam, which cleared only after local villagers used a chainsaw to cut the trunk. </p>
<p>At Seremban, road closures meant that residents had to make constant detours.</p>
<p>Ms Yanti Zulfadhli, who owns a restaurant, told CNA that she was unable to open for business on Sunday because her suppliers could not make the required deliveries. </p>
<p>“It’s a financial loss to have no business for one day, but I hear that others have lost their homes, so I’m at least thankful that my family and I are safe,” she said.</p>
