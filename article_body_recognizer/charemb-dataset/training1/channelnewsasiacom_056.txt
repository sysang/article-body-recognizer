<p>But he failed in his bid to become the first person to land a quadruple axel in competition, slightly under-rotating his maiden crack at the legendary jump.</p>
<p>Hanyu, who was making his first appearance in eight months after injuring ankle ligaments, will have the chance to try again in China in six weeks' time.</p>
<p>He was officially named in Japan's Olympic team later Sunday evening, along with Pyeongchang Games silver medallist Shoma Uno and current world number one Yuma Kagiyama.</p>
<p>"To be honest, this wasn't an Olympics that I had been thinking about," said 27-year-old Hanyu, who only confirmed this week that he intended to compete in Beijing.</p>
<p>"But the road I have taken to get here, and my feelings towards the people who have supported me, made me decide to compete."</p>
<p>Hanyu added that he is "aiming to be number one", and that he is "the only one who has the privilege to be able to compete for a third straight men's figure skating Olympic title".</p>
<p>Hanyu has been gearing up all week to attempt the quad axel, considered the holy grail of men's figure skating.</p>
<p>He came close to nailing it in practice earlier in the week, and made two failed attempts as he warmed up ahead of his free skate routine on Sunday.</p>
<p>He was unable to land it cleanly in competition either, under-rotating the jump and landing on both feet.</p>
<p>"I was almost going out of my mind with everything I was doing leading up to this competition," he said.</p>
<p>"I was reminded just how difficult it is to do a quad axel that I haven't mastered yet in a competition."</p>
<p>Hanyu went on to produce a masterclass for the rest of his routine, earning a free skate score of 211.05 for a 322.36 score overall.</p>
<p>He showed no sign of being hampered by the ankle ligament injury that forced him to miss the entire Grand Prix season.</p>
<p>Uno finished second with an overall score of 295.82, ahead of Kagiyama on 292.41.</p>
<p>Uno hurt himself in the warm-up but still produced a clean free skate, and will now attempt to claim another podium finish in his second Olympics.</p>
<p>"I'm very happy to be chosen for the Olympics, but after watching Yuzuru and Yuma's performances today, it highlighted some areas where I'm lacking," he said.</p>
<p>"I want to get back to practice as soon as I can."</p>
<p>Eighteen-year-old Kagiyama, who won both his Grand Prix assignments this season, put in a solid free skate to finish third.</p>
<p>But he was unable to make up ground on the leaders after falling on a jump in Friday's short programme.</p>
<p>Kaori Sakamoto, Wakaba Higuchi and Mana Kawabe were chosen for Japan's women's team.</p>
<p>Sakamoto, who finished sixth at the Pyeongchang Olympics, won her second national title on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Beijing Olympics begin on Feb 4.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Southampton edge West Ham in Boxing Day thriller </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: James Ward-Prowse scored one and created another as Southampton dug deep to earn a much-needed 3-2 win over West Ham United in a pulsating Premier League game at the London Stadium on Sunday.</p>
<p>The victory was Southampton's first in the league since Nov. 5, while defeat for West Ham continued their patchy run of form after a fine start to the season, with just one win in their last seven league games.</p>
<p>A lethargic opening from the home side allowed Southampton to take the lead after eight minutes when Mohamed Elyounoussi lashed home with his left foot from the edge of the box following a driving run from Kyle Walker-Peters.</p>
<p>West Ham created little going forward as Southampton keeper Fraser Forster remained largely untroubled during the first half.</p>
<p>The penalty was awarded following a VAR check after centre back Craig Dawson seemed to have clipped Armando Broja inside the area, a decision that incensed West Ham players.</p>
<p>A revitalised West Ham hit back three minutes later through Said Benrahma after being played in by Jarrod Bowen, but Jan Bednarek grabbed the winner in the 70th minute when he deftly turned in a curling free kick from Ward-Prowse.</p>
<p>Southampton boss Ralph Hasenhuttl hailed his side's "brave" performance and praised the players for showing resilience.</p>
<p>"Huge win because our record here in the last five years is that we haven't taken a point here. We played well today it was the right thing to do we never stopped believing and scored three fantastic goals," he said.</p>
<p>"We had a bit of a push back but an excellent opening 15 minutes and we can't play that way for 90 minutes so it's normal but we played well."</p>
<p>The win moved Southampton up to 14th in the standings with 20 points from 18 games, eight points behind sixth-placed West Ham.</p>

<p>NORWICH, England: Arsenal cruised to a 5-0 win at hapless bottom side Norwich City on Sunday, with Bukayo Saka's double helping them to secure the victory as they consolidated fourth place in the Premier League.</p>
<p>The win takes Arsenal to 35 points from 19 games following their fourth straight league victory, just over two years since manager Mikel Arteta’s first match in charge of the Gunners.</p>
<p>They have a six-point lead over fifth-placed Tottenham Hotspur, although their London rivals have three games in hand.</p>
<p>"It's a very satisfying result because in this festive period we have to keep performances to a high level," said Arteta. "We looked really sharp and committed.</p>
<p>"It's a big win for us. The amount of chances we create is pleasing. We go to every ground to try and impose our game. Today was a really good example."</p>
<p>The visitors took the lead after six minutes through Saka, who stroked the ball past goalkeeper Angus Gunn, who was making his Premier League debut, following a neat passing move that led to Martin Odegaard laying the ball into the forward's path.</p>
<p>Arsenal continued to test the Norwich defence with Saka the danger man thanks to his jinking runs down the wing and Gabriel Martinelli also posing a threat as the Gunners dominated.</p>
<p>Norwich's last top-flight Boxing Day win was in 1987 so the signs were ominous for the struggling Canaries from the start.</p>
<p>However, it took Arsenal until just before halftime to score again on the break when Scotland left back Tierney fired home a low shot, with Odegaard again providing the killer pass.</p>
<p>Norwich stayed in the game until the 67th minute but then the floodgates opened as the visitors struck three times.</p>
<p>England forward Saka got Arsenal's third goal with another precise strike after cleverly weaving his way past Brandon Williams on the right edge of the area.</p>
<p>Lacazette was then fouled in the box by Ozan Kabak, and the Frenchman got up to convert the spot kick in the 84th.</p>
<p>Substitute Smith Rowe complete the rout with a goal in added time, leaving Norwich on 10 points - three adrift of fourth-bottom Watford having played two games more.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Lukaku leads Chelsea to much-needed win at Villa </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Romelu Lukaku came off the bench to lead Chelsea to a much-needed 3-1 victory at Aston Villa with midfielder Jorginho scoring two penalties in the Premier League on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lukaku has not started a league game since picking up an injury in October and missed the last two games after testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>But the Belgian transformed his team's display after coming on at halftime at Villa Park, providing a constant threat, putting his side ahead and then earning the late penalty that secured the three points for Thomas Tuchel's side.</p>
<p>Third-placed Chelsea, who had drawn with Everton and Wolverhampton Wanderers in their previous two games, are now level with second placed Liverpool on 41 points - six behind leaders Manchester City.</p>
<p>Villa had taken the lead in the 28th minute with some good fortune when Matt Targett's cross struck the head of Chelsea defender Reece James and flew past goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.</p>
<p>The visitor's drew level six minutes later, though, when Matty Cash clumsily brought down Callum Hudson-Odoi inside the box and Jorginho coolly converted the penalty.</p>
<p>Halftime substitute Lukaku made a swift impact, getting in front of Tyrone Mings to angle in a fine, glancing header from a Hudson-Odoi cross to put Chelsea ahead in the 56th minute.</p>
<p>Mason Mount should have added a third but shot wide after Villa keeper Emiliano Martinez had raced out of his area and failed to clear.</p>
<p>Hudson-Odoi should also have done better when he was found in space at the back post but his shot was comfortably dealt with by Martinez.</p>
<p>In stoppage time, Lukaku powered his way from his own half before he was brought down inside the box by Villa defender Ezri Konsa. Jorginho again made no mistake to secure three points.</p>
<p>"I needed a performance like this," said Lukaku, "It’s been difficult getting (on at) the end of games. I kept working hard. I’m happy with my performance and have to push on," he added.</p>
<p>The former Manchester United and Inter Milan striker said Chelsea remained in the race to catch leaders City.</p>
<p>"We are the hunters now. The last results were not the best and now we have to chase. We have to treat every game like a final. Today we won and now we have to push on," he said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Moura inspires Tottenham to easy win over Crystal Palace </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON :Brazilian Lucas Moura inspired Tottenham Hotspur to a 3-0 victory over Crystal Palace that stretched their unbeaten Premier League run under new manager Antonio Conte to six games in murky north London on Sunday.</p>
<p>Moura created goals for Harry Kane and Son Heung-min and bagged one for himself as Tottenham comfortably beat a Palace side for whom manager Patrick Vieira missed the game because of a positive COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>While victory moved Tottenham up to fifth in the table, it proved a dispiriting day for Palace, who faded after a decent start and were reduced to 10 men in the 37th minute when Wilfried Zaha was sent off for a needless second yellow-card offence.</p>
<p>By that time Tottenham were well in control after Kane swept in from Moura's pass before Moura headed the second.</p>
<p>Son wrapped up the Boxing Day win with his side's third from close range in the 74th minute.</p>
<p>Tottenham have 29 points, six less than fourth-placed Arsenal but have played three games fewer after having two matches postponed this month because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Conte has changed the vibe at Tottenham since taking over from Nuno Espirito Santo, and this latest victory provided further proof that his methods are paying off as his side avenged a 3-0 defeat at Palace in September.</p>
<p>"We started a bit slow but created chances to score. We improved the quality and the intensity and scored twice and for sure when we played against 10 men it was easier," Conte said.</p>
<p>"Now we have to recover and make the best decision around our starting 11 for Southampton (on Tuesday). It won't be easy for us or other teams to play after two days."</p>
<p>It took them a while to get into their stride, however, with Kane almost invisible until the 32nd minute when the lively Moura sped down the right wing and looked up before pulling back a pass for the England skipper to fire in a right-footed shot.</p>
<p>Two minutes later Moura was in the thick of the action again, seizing possession and playing in Kane who in turn slid an astute ball into the path of Emerson Royal. Royal then crossed and Moura steamed in to the area to power in a header.</p>
<p>Things got even worse for Palace shortly afterwards when Zaha, who had already been booked, needlessly shoved Davinson Sanchez as they tussled for the ball near the touchline.</p>
<p>Tottenham substituted Kane after an hour and played most of the second half in cruise control as the game petered out, but Moura completed a superb individual display when he crossed for Son to score with a silky touch.</p>
<p>Palace, who are 12th, failed to register a shot on target.</p>
<p>"The two goals and the red card changed the game. We knew it would be difficult with 11 men on the pitch, but it made it even more difficult after the red card," Crystal Palace assistant manager Osian Roberts said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Man City survive Leicester fightback to secure ninth successive win </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MANCHESTER, England: Manchester City survived a spirited Leicester City fightback to earn a thrilling 6-3 victory on Sunday, a ninth Premier League win in a row moving them six points clear the top of the standings.</p>
<p>With second-placed Liverpool not in action after their clash with Leeds United was postponed due to COVID-19 cases at the Yorkshire club, City appeared out of sight midway through the first half at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>The in-form champions raced into a fifth-minute lead through Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, before a Riyad Mahrez penalty put the hosts in control nine minutes later.</p>
<p>Things went from bad to worse for a Leicester side struggling to replicate last season's form, with Ilkay Gundogan and another penalty, converted by Raheem Sterling, giving the hosts a four-goal lead inside 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Despite looking dead and buried, Leicester stormed back in the second half as goals from James Maddison, Ademola Lookman and Kelechi Iheanacho threatened to derail the league leaders.</p>
<p>Aymeric Laporte's 69th-minute header and Sterling's late second took the champions over the line, however, as they moved on to 47 points, six clear of Liverpool, from 19 matches. Leicester dropped to 10th.</p>
<p>"We just had to control the game," Sterling told the BBC. "At 4-0 up you have to kill the game.</p>
<p>"Leicester have some really good players. They didn't get disheartened and kept going. Credit to them."</p>
<p>Leicester stunned Pep Guardiola's side last season in the same fixture, thrashing their opponents 5-2 at the Etihad, thanks largely to a Jamie Vardy hat-trick.</p>
<p>Without their injured talisman this time around, a second successive win in the blue half of Manchester looked a distant dream for Leicester as City stormed into a four-goal lead.</p>
<p>De Bruyne's fifth league goal of the season, a fierce strike from the edge of the penalty area, got the champions up and running, before Youri Tielemans conceded a penalty for a foul on Ruben Dias, with the spotkick emphatically put away by Mahrez.</p>
<p>Home goalkeeper Ederson pulled off a stunning save to deny Maddison, but that was only a brief reprieve for the visitors’ backline as Gundogan added a third in the 21st minute from close range.</p>
<p>City had won 4-0 in their previous league match and soon had a fourth against Leicester after Tielemans fouled Sterling in the area, with the England international getting up to score for a fourth consecutive league match.</p>
<p>Maddison's third goal in as many games in all competitions, on the end of a through ball from former City player Iheanacho, gave the visitors hope, before Iheanacho again turned provider for Lookman to really worry the home crowd.</p>
<p>Iheanacho then reacted fastest to Maddison's saved strike from distance to put Leicester within one of the champions.</p>
<p>Laporte's towering leap from a corner ended the fightback, before Sterling's late tap-in put the result, finally, beyond all doubt.</p>
<p>The encounter is the first ever Premier League game on Boxing Day to have as many as nine goals.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> England cleared to play after multiple COVID-19 cases hit camp </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MELBOURNE: England's cricket team were cleared to play day two of the third Ashes test in Melbourne after two members of support staff and two of their family members were forced to isolate after testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The England team initially reported only one positive test among the team's "family group" but host board Cricket Australia confirmed there had been a rash of cases in the camp.</p>
<p>"Cricket Australia has been informed that two members of the England cricket team's support staff and two of their family members have returned a positive COVID-19 Rapid Antigen Test," CA said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The affected individuals are currently isolating.</p>
<p>"The entire playing group and all other support staff have undertaken Rapid Antigen Tests this morning and all have tested negative.</p>
<p>"The England Cricket team will also have PCR tests today, and both teams will take extra precautions throughout play. Both playing squads remain unchanged."</p>
<p>Play was delayed by half an hour to start at 11:00am local time (0000 GMT).</p>
<p>The England team reported the sole case just over an hour before play was to start.</p>
<p>Some 20 minutes later, the team said it had been given the green light to head to the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>Australia will resume on 61 for one in reply to England's first innings 185.</p>
<p>Australia lead the series 2-0 and can retain the Ashes with a draw in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Cricket Australia said there was no impact on fans or other parts of the MCG but host broadcaster Seven Network confirmed one of its staff members working on the Ashes at the stadium had tested positive to COVID-19 late on Sunday.</p>
<p>Australia captain Pat Cummins was forced to miss the second test in Adelaide and isolate for a week after being identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case.</p>
<p>Australian authorities are battling a surge in COVID-19 cases driven by the Omicron variant.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Fellaini on target as Shandong end Chinese league title drought </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>HONG KONG: Marouane Fellaini was on target as Shandong Taishan defeated Hebei FC 2-0 in Guangzhou on Sunday (Dec 26) to clinch the club's first Chinese Super League title in over a decade.</p>
<p>The former Manchester United midfielder netted from close range in the 21st minute to send Shandong on their way to the win they needed to take an unassailable lead at the top of the standings and claim the trophy for the first time since 2010.</p>
<p>Xu Xin added a second seven minutes from time as Shandong moved onto 48 points from 19 games. With three matches remaining and a gap of 10 points over second placed Guangzhou FC, Hao Wei's side cannot be overhauled.</p>
<p>Wearing the captain's armband, Fellaini put Shandong in front when Hebei goalkeeper Bao Yaxiong was unable to do enough to stop Jin Jingdao's clipped ball from the right, leaving the ex-Belgium midfielder to bounce his miss-hit shot over the line.</p>
<p>Seven minutes from time Fellaini was involved again, this time seeing Bao save his header only for Xu to score on the rebound and put the seal on Shandong's win.</p>
<p>Shandong's title marks the end of an era dominated by clubs largely backed by China's big spending property developers.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, owned by embattled developers Evergrande, won eight of the 10 titles since Shandong last prevailed, with Shanghai Port and the now-defunct Jiangsu Suning the other clubs to claim the Chinese Super League crown.</p>
<p>Jiangsu collapsed after winning last year's title while Guangzhou have seen many of their foreign players plus Italian coach Fabio Cannavaro leave this season as financial difficulties have hit hard.</p>
<p>Now led by former China midfielder Zheng Zhi, Guangzhou defeated Slaven Bilic's Beijing Guoan 1-0 on Sunday through Deng Hanwen's first half goal to remain in second, ahead of Shanghai Port on goals scored.</p>
<p>Shanghai also won, downing Shenzhen FC 3-1, taking the lead through Li Zhurun only to go into the interval level after Frank Acheampong equalised for Shenzhen.</p>
<p>Li Shenyuan and Oscar struck to ensure Ivan Leko's side recorded a victory that keeps them on track to qualify for next year's Asian Champions League.</p>
<p>Changchun Yatai maintained their push for a top three finish when Brazilian duo Erik and Junior Negrao scored to earn Chen Yang's team a 2-1 win over Guangzhou City.</p>
<p>Matches in the championship rounds of the Chinese Super League are currently being played in a bio-secure bubble in Guangzhou to limit travel as a result of the pandemic.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: A dormitory resident in Singapore contracted the coronavirus despite having completed the full COVID-19 vaccination regimen, sparking questions about how this can happen and the effectiveness of the jab. </p>
<p>The 23-year-old Indian national was the first such case reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH), which said it is a "reminder" that it is possible for vaccinated individuals to get infected.</p>
<p>He received his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine on Jan 25 and the second dose on Feb 17.</p>
<p>His infection was detected when he was swabbed on Apr 7 as part of rostered routine testing. The man's earlier tests from routine testing - the last being on Mar 24 - were all negative for COVID-19. </p>

<p>Similar cases have been reported around the world. </p>
<p>In the United States, for instance, three out of nearly 5,000 vaccinated people in an April report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had confirmed infections after they were fully inoculated.</p>
<p>CNA spoke to infectious diseases experts about getting infected after vaccination. </p>
<p>Q: What are the chances of getting COVID-19 after vaccination?</p>
<p>It is rare, but not impossible.</p>
<p>While COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, none are 100 per cent effective.</p>
<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines – both used in Singapore – are mRNA vaccines.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine authorised for use in Singapore</a></h3>
<p>Assoc Prof Hsu noted that the “real world” experience in the United States and Israel shows that the vaccine efficacy was less than 90 per cent.</p>
<p>“What this means is that one in 20 persons on average would still develop COVID-19 if exposed to the virus,” he said.</p>
<p>He added that the chances in Singapore “are very low simply because there is minimal spread of COVID-19 in the community”.</p>
<p>“As an illustration, there has only been one reported infection post-vaccination in our dormitory migrant worker community so far despite regular testing, whereas a significant proportion has already been vaccinated,” he said.</p>
<p>Senior consultant in the Division of Infectious Disease at the National University Hospital Dale Fisher said there is “hardly any chance of getting COVID-19 in Singapore ... especially if you are vaccinated”.</p>
<p>The chances of infection after vaccination depends on the prevalence of the disease, said the president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection Paul Tambyah.</p>
<p>“Bottom line is that it is rare to get the disease after vaccination but not impossible,” said Professor Tambyah.</p>
<p>Q: Why do people get infected with COVID-19 after completing vaccination? </p>
<p>This happens because the strength of the immune response varies across individuals after vaccination, Assoc Prof Hsu said. </p>
<p>The mRNA vaccines teach cells how to make at least a piece of a protein that triggers an immune response inside the bodies of those who are vaccinated.</p>
<p>Dr Fisher added that the vaccine is not 100 per cent effective. If it is 90 per cent effective, 10 per cent are still vulnerable, he said.</p>
<p>“This is fully expected. The World Health Organization initially set a target of at least 50 per cent efficacy,” he said.</p>
<p>If a person falls sick after vaccination, it is “very, very acceptable, very expected because of vaccine failures”, said Dr Leong Hoe Nam, infectious diseases expert from Mount Elizabeth Novena Hospital.</p>
<p>Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) said that some countries are seeing a resurgence of COVID-19 cases "partly due to emerging variants of concern with better ability to transmit".</p>
<p>"Humans develop immunity through natural infection or vaccination to counter the virus. However, viruses like the coronavirus are known to mutate over time thus escaping from our immune protection," she said.</p>
<p>Q: Is it a cause of concern if someone who has completed their vaccination gets COVID-19? </p>
<p>This depends on a few factors, said Prof Tambyah. </p>
<p>Dr Fisher said that it is “not at all (cause for concern) if numbers are low”.</p>
<p>Prof Leo said having an infected case after two doses of vaccine is "not a surprise".</p>
<p>"It serves as a reminder that we cannot be complacent," she added.</p>

<p>Q: How does vaccination help then?</p>
<p>A person who has not been vaccinated will have more severe symptoms, while a person who has been vaccinated will have much milder symptoms, said Dr Leong.</p>
<p>“If you think about it, no one dies of it, almost everybody is asymptomatic, then we have converted the disease from a bad critical illness to that of a mild cold."</p>
<p>Prof Leo added that vaccination also likely reduces the risk of onward transmission of infection, although further research is required to determine the extent of reduction.</p>
<p>While the disease is mild in vaccinated people, Dr Fisher cautioned that they would still be infective and therefore a risk to those who are not vaccinated.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, vaccination is still the most effective way of preventing infection, "not just in the individual, but also at a population level”, said Dr Hsu.</p>
<p>Vaccination goes hand in hand with other measures like safe distancing, he added.</p>
<p>“There are millions of people worldwide who have been vaccinated (against COVID-19) but those who have been infected post-vaccination number in the low thousands at most. That is pretty good,” Prof Tambyah said.</p>

<p>BANGKOK: The popular Thai resort island of Phuket <a>reopened to tourists from overseas</a> on Thursday (Jul 1) after more than a year without international arrivals due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>It is the first province in Thailand to welcome back international visitors and pilot a new tourism model called Phuket Sandbox, designed to help the pandemic-battered economy recover.</p>
<p>Tourists arriving in Phuket from Thursday are free to enjoy the island. But because some activities are still restricted, here are a few things that tourists need to know before booking their flight to the tropical getaway.</p>
<p>Q: Will there be a quarantine upon arrival?</p>
<p>Travellers who plan to stay in Phuket for less than seven days must take a second test on Day 6 or 7. If the length of stay is between 10 to 14 days, they have to be swabbed for the third time on Day 12 or 13. </p>
<p>The tests can be done at certified hotels or partner hospitals at travellers’ own expense. If they test positive, tourists will be transferred to healthcare facilities for treatment.</p>
<p>According to the Tourism Authority of Thailand, the cost of an RT-PCR COVID-19 test ranges from 2,500 (US$78) baht to 4,000 baht per person. All the tests must be paid in advance through hotels.</p>
<p>Q: Can my kids come along with me to Phuket?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Children aged below six who are travelling with their fully vaccinated parents can enter Phuket without prior vaccination against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Tourists under 18 years of age who travel with their fully vaccinated parents are required to present a medical certificate with a laboratory result indicating that COVID-19 is not detected in an RT-PCR test within 72 hours before travel.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary - Thailand’s Phuket sandbox can peel open travel despite limitations</a></h3>
<p>Q: Can I visit the surrounding islands?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Tourists can visit islands located in Phuket if they test negative for COVID-19 upon arrival. There are 37 islands in the province, including Koh Racha Yai, Koh He, Koh Bon and Koh Mai Ton. </p>
<p>However, they cannot visit islands located in other provinces, although they were previously accessible from Phuket. These include Koh Phi Phi in Krabi and the James Bond island in Phang-nga.</p>
<p>Q: Can I travel to other provinces in the country?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Tourists who have spent 14 nights at a certified hotel in Phuket and tested negative throughout their stay can continue their journey to other provinces in Thailand.</p>
<p>Travellers who intend to spend less than 14 nights in Phuket must leave the province on an international flight to another country. </p>
<p>Q: Will I have to wear a face mask in Phuket?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Visitors to Phuket are advised to take some precautions during their stay as part of the province’s COVID-19 preventive measures. These include wearing face masks in public, social distancing, hand sanitising and temperature screening.</p>
<p>Q: Are entertainment venues open?</p>
<p>A: No. Pubs, bars, karaoke venues, entertainment venues and businesses that are similar to entertainment venues in Phuket are temporarily closed. </p>
<p>However, tourists can dine-in at eateries and consume alcohol there until 11pm.</p>
<p>Q: Can I go for a massage?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Spa and massage venues are open but the number of customers may be limited to ensure social distancing.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> FAQ: What you need to know about the new vaccinated travel lanes for Germany and Brunei </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ang Hwee Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore will be launching quarantine-free travel lanes for vaccinated passengers from Germany and Brunei Darussalam next month, as it further moves to reopen its borders.</p>
<p>Under the vaccinated travel lanes, passengers who are fully vaccinated and arriving from Germany or Brunei from Sep 8 will not have to serve a stay-home notice in Singapore, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force announced on Thursday (Aug 19).</p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about the new vaccinated travel lanes, and what they mean for your long-awaited overseas holiday. </p>
<p>Q: Which group of passengers are covered under the vaccinated travel lanes? </p>
<p>A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after they have received both doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or other vaccines listed under the World Health Organization (WHO) emergency use list, such as Sinovac and AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>This also means that children under the age of 12 in Singapore, who cannot be vaccinated yet, cannot travel through the vaccinated travel lanes. </p>
<p>Q: I am a fully vaccinated Singapore citizen or permanent resident and I want to travel to Brunei or Germany. Can I do so under the new vaccination travel lanes? </p>
<p>A: The new vaccination travel lanes apply to passengers coming to Singapore from Germany and Brunei.</p>
<p>Currently, Singaporeans can already travel to Germany without serving a quarantine there - regardless of vaccination status. Travellers from Singapore to Brunei under the reciprocal green lane arrangement are subject to certain restrictions.</p>
<p>The current plan is to have seven flights a week or one flight a day from Frankfurt or Munich, and three designated flights from Brunei a week. </p>
<p>Q: Where can I go under the new arrangement? </p>
<p>A: With the new vaccinated travel lanes, passengers who are fully vaccinated and arriving from Germany and Brunei will not be subject to a controlled itinerary or sponsor requirements. </p>
<p>However, they must have remained in Singapore or their country of departure – Germany or Brunei – for 21 consecutive days before they depart for Singapore. </p>
<p>On arrival in Singapore, travellers must also take a PCR test at the airport and self-isolate until they get a negative result.</p>
<p>Responding to a question about how Singapore will verify the travel history of those coming from Germany, since there are relaxed border control measures within the EU, Transport Minister S Iswaran said this will be based on “self-declaration”. </p>
<p>“The individual has to make a declaration to the effect that he or she has spent the last 21 days within Germany. And that declaration is being made to our authorities,” said Mr Iswaran at the press conference.</p>
<p>If individuals are found to have made a false declaration, action can be taken against them, including enforcement under the Infectious Diseases Act, said Mr Iswaran. </p>
<p>Q: I am in Germany or Brunei and want to travel to Singapore. How do I go about this under the new vaccinated travel lanes? </p>
<p>A: Short-term visitors and long-term pass holders coming from Germany or Brunei will need to apply for a vaccinated travel pass seven to 30 days before their intended arrival. Applications for these passes open on Sep 1. </p>
<p>As part of the application for the pass, travellers will have to pre-pay for their day three and day seven PCR tests, and their vaccination status will be checked for entry into Singapore. </p>
<p>Short-term visitors who need a visa to enter Singapore must also obtain one. They are advised to do so after their vaccination travel pass is approved and before they depart for Singapore, said the authorities. </p>
<p>They must also buy travel insurance with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 for COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs before they travel to Singapore. </p>
<p>All visitors must also use the TraceTogether app in Singapore to facilitate contact tracing. </p>
<p>Q: I am a fully vaccinated Singapore citizen or PR and want to return from Germany or Brunei under the scheme. What do I need to do? </p>
<p>Fully vaccinated Singapore citizens and permanent residents (PRs) do not need to apply for a vaccination travel pass to enter Singapore under the scheme. </p>
<p>Those who are vaccinated in Singapore can show their vaccination status on the HealthHub app when checking in at the airport before departure for Singapore. </p>
<p>For those who were not vaccinated in Singapore, they can present proof of their vaccination to the airline in their country of departure, as well as to Singapore's immigration authorities after arriving at Changi Airport. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> FAQ: What you need to know about COVID-19 quarantine orders, health risk warnings and alerts </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Cindy Co </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on <a>Sep 6</a> that it would begin issuing health risk warnings and health risk alerts as part of new measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, amid a sharp spike in the number of local cases.</p>
<p>On top of quarantining close contacts, these new measures will enable authorities to “cast a wide net” whenever a new cluster is detected, and help contain them quickly, said MOH.</p>
<p>Singapore has seen a sharp spike in the number of local COVID-19 cases, with the daily caseload on Sep 18 <a>crossing the 1,000-mark</a> for the first time since April last year.</p>
<p>The country has taken multiple steps to contain the spread as it moves towards living with the virus as an <a>endemic disease</a>.</p>
<p>On Friday, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung said that every country that decides to live with the virus will have to undergo a “major wave of transmission”. </p>
<p>“This is almost like a rite of passage, before humans and the virus achieve a new equilibrium and things stabilise,” he said.</p>
<p>To be able to "live with COVID-19 as an almost endemic disease", said Mr Ong, measures such as vaccination, treatment, mask-wearing and testing will have to be implemented in tandem.</p>
<p>"Take away any portion, any part, any component and I think we can’t be successful," he said.</p>
<p>Singapore on Tuesday reported 1,173 new local COVID-19 infections and three fatalities. As of Tuesday, the country has reported a total of 79,899 COVID-19 cases and 65 deaths from the disease.</p>
<p>Here is what you need to know about quarantine orders, health risk warnings and health risk alerts.</p>
<p>Q: What are health risk warnings and health risk alerts?</p>
<p>Health risk warnings are issued to those identified as close contacts of COVID-19 cases, based on TraceTogether and SafeEntry data.</p>
<p>People who have been in close proximity with a COVID-19 case for an extended period of time will also receive a health risk warning.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, health risk alerts are issued to people with possible exposure to COVID-19. </p>
<p>According to MOH’s website, people issued health risk alerts are those who have “directly or indirectly been exposed to the risk of infection, even if that risk is lower than that of a close contact”.</p>
<p>Q: What do I need to do if I receive a health risk warning?</p>
<p>People issued with health risk warnings must comply with the testing and isolation requirements by law.</p>
<p>Once they are notified by MOH, they should book an appointment for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 48 hours of the SMS. This can be done at either a private practitioner or a swab-and-send-home clinic, not including polyclinics.</p>
<p>They also have to self-isolate until their PCR test result comes back negative. This means that they should not leave their residence except to seek medical treatment from a doctor, or to go for their PCR tests.</p>
<p>People who have been issued with health risk warnings are also “strongly advised” to stay in their rooms and minimise interaction with others in the household or visitors during this period, said MOH on its website.</p>
<p>They may only end their self-isolation once they receive a negative PCR test result, but should continue to minimise social interactions as much as possible for the entire period.</p>
<p>On the third, fifth and seventh day from the last exposure, they should perform a self-test with an antigen rapid test (ART), which can be collected from ART vending machines.</p>
<p>A second PCR test should be done on the eighth day from the last exposure. MOH's SMS notification will contain the date for the second PCR test appointment.</p>
<p>Q: What do I do if I receive a health risk alert?</p>
<p>Those who receive health risk alerts should monitor their health and seek medical attention if they are unwell within the health risk alert period, said MOH on its website.</p>
<p>They should undergo a self-administered ART within 24 hours from the last date of exposure, as well as on the third and fifth day. These kits can be collected from ART vending machines.</p>
<p>MOH also said that those who have been issued health risk alerts are “strongly encouraged” to come forward for free swab tests. </p>
<p>Q: Can I leave the house?</p>
<p>Those under health risk warnings must self-isolate immediately after receiving the SMS notification. They must comply with the self-isolation requirements by law.</p>
<p>Their isolation only ends when they receive a negative PCR test or at the end of their health risk warning period, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p>Those under health risk warnings and health risk alerts cannot claim compensation for time lost at work.</p>
<p>Q: How do health risk warnings and alerts differ from a quarantine order?</p>
<p>Health risk alerts are issued only to people with possible exposure to the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>While health risk warnings and quarantine orders are both issued to close contacts of COVID-19 cases, those under quarantine orders have to self-isolate for the entire duration of the order.</p>
<p>People who are issued with health risk warnings can end their self-isolation after they receive a negative PCR test result. However, it is still recommended that they minimise social interactions for the duration of the health risk warning.</p>
<p>Q: What do I need to do if I receive a quarantine order?</p>
<p>People are issued with quarantine orders if they are, or are suspected to be, a carrier of the COVID-19 virus. Close contacts of a COVID-19 case may also be issued with quarantine orders.</p>
<p>Quarantine orders can be served at home, a dedicated Government quarantine facility or in hospital. This will be determined by MOH based on the person’s contact history, state of health and suitability of their home.</p>
<p>People whose household members have not been issued quarantine orders will be sent to a Government quarantine facility.</p>
<p>Spot checks will be conducted throughout the quarantine period.</p>
<p>There will be a swab test performed at the start of the quarantine period and another swab test performed near the end of the order.</p>
<p>These tests are arranged by appointment only and are conducted at designated testing sites. Two-way transportation will be provided.</p>
<p>Approved caregivers of a person under quarantine may apply for the allowance as well, subject to eligibility.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> FAQ: What you need to know about COVID-19 home recovery scheme </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Johannes Tjendro </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: COVID-19 patients who are recovering at home currently account for up to 40 per cent of cases every day, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (Sep 23).</p>
<p>Home recovery is now the default mode of care for fully vaccinated COVID-19 cases if they meet the criteria.</p>
<p>Singapore has seen a surge in local COVID-19 cases over the last month, with a record 1,453 new local cases reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The ministry's <a>ground operations are "much strained"</a> and there have been delays for some patients, said MOH.</p>
<p>Some patients on home recovery said they <a>have not received instructions from authorities</a> about tests or what they should do after they tested positive.</p>
<p>This is what you need to know if you have tested positive for COVID-19 and are recovering at home.</p>
<h2>Q: Who is eligible for home recovery?</h2>
<p>Home recovery is the default mode of recovery for fully vaccinated COVID-19 cases who meet the criteria, said MOH.</p>
<p>COVID-19 cases recovering at home must meet these requirements:</p>
<li>Aged 12 to 69 years old</li>
<li>No severe co-morbidities or illness</li>
<li>Household members do not include elderly who are more than 80 years old or people in the vulnerable group such as pregnant women or those with weakened immune response or multiple co-morbidities</li>
<li>Able to self-isolate in a room, "preferably" with an attached bathroom</li>
<p>COVID-19 patients are admitted to hospital and community care facilities if they are 80 and above, 70 and above and not vaccinated, or if they have underlying illnesses.</p>
<h2>Q: I've tested positive for COVID-19. What should I do while waiting to be contacted to start home recovery?</h2>
<p>"The surge in cases has caused delays and we seek your patience and understanding. We are streamlining our operations and will get to you as soon as possible," said MOH.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, please isolate yourself in a room in your home."</p>
<p>Isolate in a room that "preferably" has an attached toilet and wear a mask if you have to come out of the room, MOH said.</p>
<p>If you are not feeling well, you can call one of the <a>telemedicine providers on this list</a>.</p>
<p>MOH said an SMS will be sent to provide more information on what you should do during home recovery.</p>
<p>This will include the home recovery buddy hotline at 6874 4939 should you have any questions.</p>
<p>As the ministry is still "building up" its call response team, it advised people to call again later if the line is busy.</p>
<p>Household members are to register for an <a>electronic quarantine order</a>, while you will be issued an isolation order for 10 days.</p>
<h2>Q: Who should I contact if I have not received my home care pack?</h2>
<p>The home care pack is only delivered to you if you do not have an oximeter at home. Should you need one, call your home recovery buddy.</p>
<p>"The key item is the oximeter to monitor the oxygen level in your blood," said MOH.</p>
<p>"We will deliver it to you using contactless delivery, no different from when you are ordering food delivery."</p>
<h2>Q: Where do I upload my oximeter test results?</h2>
<p>Maintain a daily regimen of monitoring your temperature, pulse rate and blood oxygen saturation.</p>
<p>You can submit the readings to the home recovery vitals diary by 10am every day.</p>
<h2>Q: How can I keep my household members safe if I need to collect meals, have laundry changed or clear trash?</h2>
<p>"If you really do need to step out of the room to do these tasks, ensure no one from the household is near the doorway to your room," said MOH.</p>
<p>"Put on a surgical mask before opening the door, complete your task and return back to your room quickly."</p>
<h2>Q: I’m under electronic quarantine order and my household members are not allowed to leave home. How can I get food, groceries or medical supplies?</h2>
<p>Try to order groceries and food that can be delivered to your home, or get help from your relatives, family members and friends.</p>
<p>"As for medicine, access the 24/7 telemedicine service. If you need medication, it will be sent to you," said MOH.</p>
<h2>Q: I am running out of ART test kits for myself and my household members under home quarantine. Who should I contact?</h2>
<p>There is no need to take antigen rapid tests (ART) if you are on home recovery.</p>
<p>If you are on a quarantine order, ART kits are given to you when you go through your quarantine entry swab at the clinic or test centre.</p>
<p>There is sufficient nationwide stock of ART kits, said the Health Ministry.</p>
<p>"However, it will take a few days for the stock to be distributed to the various shops. Please wait for a few days before going back to the shops to check," MOH added.</p>
<p>You can also arrange for friends or relatives to get them from shops and deliver them to you.</p>
<h2>Q: I have developed some symptoms. What should I do?</h2>
<p>If you feel unwell or experience worsening of any of the following symptoms, contact your designated telemedicine provider. They will guide you on what to do.</p>
<ul><li>Fever</li> <li>Acute respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore throat, runny nose, headache</li> <li>Muscle ache or tiredness</li> <li>Diarrhoea</li> </ul>
<h2>Q: When can I be discharged from home recovery?</h2>
<p>No discharge memo is needed, said MOH.</p>
<p>"If you are feeling well, you are discharged on day 10 of the illness.</p>
<p>"There is no need for further PCR tests because vaccinated individuals are extremely unlikely to be infectious by this time," added the ministry.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> FAQ: What to do if you have COVID-19 symptoms or your antigen rapid test is positive </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Cheryl Lin </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Local COVID-19 infection numbers have swelled in recent weeks, with <a>cases growing “faster than expected”</a>, said Health Minister Ong Ye Kung last Friday (Sep 17).</p>
<p>Authorities continue to emphasise the importance of testing extensively – and are urging people to self-test regularly as a matter of “social responsibility”.</p>
<p>To that end, such do-it-yourself antigen rapid test (ART) kits have been distributed to households and students. <a>Vending machines have also been set up islandwide</a> to dispense the test kits to those who receive health risk warnings or alerts.</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines from the Ministry of Health (MOH), as of Sep 22, on what you should do if you display symptoms of COVID-19 or test positive on an ART.</p>
<h2>Q: I have COVID-19 symptoms. What should I do?</h2>
<p>Symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to acute respiratory infection symptoms – such as fever, cough, runny nose or loss of taste or smell.</p>
<p>If you have any such symptoms, skip the self-test. </p>
<p>Instead, consult a general practitioner at a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic, says MOH. You can find a list of these clinics <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have mild symptoms, you should also avoid seeking treatment at a hospital, added the ministry.</p>
<p>Going to a SASH doctor – who can assess the severity of one's symptoms and perform COVID-19 tests – will help preserve hospital capacity “for those who truly need hospital care”, it said.</p>
<p>You can also check your symptoms on this <a>site</a> developed by healthcare institutions. </p>
<h2>Q: Should I use a self-test kit even if I don’t have any symptoms?</h2>
<p>You can use the ART even if you are well, as a person could be infected even if he has no symptoms, says MOH.</p>
<p>Testing will provide certainty, especially if you have come into contact with an active cluster, it said.</p>
<p>People are encouraged to self-test regularly, including those who are fully vaccinated, especially if they are taking part in large-scale events.</p>
<h2>Q: Is frequent ART swabbing harmful to me?</h2>
<p>Frequent swabbing has not been proven to be harmful, says MOH.</p>
<p>ART swabs are inserted at around 2cm into the nostril, which are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.</p>
<p>However, if you have had recent facial surgery or frequent nose bleeds, you are advised to visit a licensed ART provider to have a professional perform the test for you.</p>
<h2>Q: I’ve tested positive on a self-test kit. Now what?</h2>
<p>If your ART shows a positive result but you are asymptomatic, you should:</p>
<p>1. Stop going to work, cancel your social activities</p>
<p>This is to protect others from possibly being infected with COVID-19.</p>
<p>2. Do not rush to a hospital to get tested</p>
<p>Doing so may expose you to more risk because there may be other infected people there, said MOH’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak last Friday.</p>
<p>If you are concerned about the ART test result, visit a nearby SASH clinic. The doctor will assess you and decide if a PCR test is needed.</p>
<p>3. Self-isolate for at least 72 hours</p>
<p>You are encouraged to stay at home and self-isolate for at least 72 hours. This will allow you to safely recover, monitor your health and avoid spreading the virus further.</p>
<p>If you start to feel unwell during isolation, visit a GP as soon as possible to be assessed. The doctor will decide if a PCR test is needed and will also advise on your next steps.</p>
<p>4. At the end of the 72 hours, do another ART test</p>
<p>If the result is negative, you can have “peace of mind” knowing you have recovered, said Assoc Prof Mak.</p>
<p>You can then “progressively” resume your normal activities, he said.</p>
<p>5. If your test result is still positive after the period of self-isolation, consult a GP</p>
<p>Take a photo of your ART test result next to your identification card.</p>
<p>Have this photo and your identification card with you when you go to the doctor.</p>
<p>6. If you are then given a PCR test, self-isolate while waiting</p>
<p>You should head home via private transport and self-isolate while awaiting the results of your PCR test. Keep your mask on.</p>
<p>Your doctor will inform you of your results generally within 24 to 48 hours, according to MOH. You may also check your results via HealthHub.</p>
<h2>Q: If my PCR test is positive, what happens next?</h2>
<p>Continue to self-isolate in a well-ventilated room. Do not have contact with your household members.</p>
<p>MOH will contact you on the next course of action. </p>
<p><a>Home recovery</a> is the default care management model for those who fulfil these criteria:</p>
<p>- Aged 12 to 69 years old</p>
<p>- No severe comorbidities or illness</p>
<p>- Household members do not include elderly who are more than 80 years old or people in the vulnerable group such as pregnant women or those with weakened immune response or multiple comorbidities</p>
<p>- Able to self-isolate in a room, preferably with an attached bathroom.</p>
<p>You can expect to receive an SMS within 24 hours, with a link to provide your details, to start your home recovery.</p>
<p>If you're unsuitable for home recovery, MOH will make the arrangements for you to recover at a community care facility or hospital.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) and Early Childhood Development Agency announced the beginning of the COVID-19 vaccination programme for children aged five to 11 on Tuesday (Dec 21). </p>
<p>Here’s what you need to know about the vaccination programme for this age group: </p>
<h2>WHEN WILL VACCINATIONS BEGIN?</h2>
<p>Vaccinations will begin on Dec 27, with older children being vaccinated before younger children. Bookings will begin on Dec 22 for parents of pupils from Primary 4 to Primary 6 in MOE schools below the age of 12 in 2022.</p>
<p>After registration on child.vaccine.gov.sg, parents and guardians can expect to receive a unique link via SMS within three to five working days to book a vaccination appointment.</p>
<p>From the week of Jan 3 next year, parents and guardians of Primary 1 to 3 students in MOE primary schools can expect to progressively receive a unique link via SMS to book a vaccination appointment, MOE and ECDA said.</p>
<p>Children must have crossed their 5th birthday before they are eligible to book an appointment and receive the vaccination.</p>
<p>Students in primary levels at madrasahs will largely follow similar arrangements as those in MOE primary schools, and an SMS invitation will also be sent to their parents and guardians.</p>
<p>The programme will be open to all Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders.</p>
<h2>WHERE WILL THE VACCINATION BE HELD?</h2>
<p>Fifteen designated paediatric vaccination centres are located islandwide. The following seven centres will begin operations on Dec 27: </p>
<p>Another seven vaccination centres will begin operations on Jan 3: </p>
<p>Another vaccination centre located in Yusof Ishak Secondary School (Punggol campus) will begin vaccinations on Jan 11.</p>
<h2>WHAT MUST PARENTS BRING?</h2>
<p>Parents need to bring their child’s student identification, or other forms of identification, such as birth certificate or passport, for verification purposes.</p>
<p>Those who registered their interest on the national appointment system will also be required to sign a consent form and bring along a hardcopy or softcopy to the vaccination centre for verification. The consent form can be found on the system.</p>
<p>Only one parent is allowed to accompany the child to ensure compliance with safe management measures at the vaccination centres.</p>
<h2>HOW ABOUT CHILDREN OUTSIDE OF MAINSTREAM SETTINGS?</h2>
<p>To facilitate access for children in special education schools and ECDA-funded Early Intervention Programme for Infants and Children (EIPIC) centres, MOH will deploy mobile vaccination teams to these locations for all eligible students from Jan 12.</p>
<p>The special education schools and EIPIC centres will share registration instructions and guidelines with the parents and guardians of these children. </p>
<h2>HOW SAFE IS THE VACCINE?</h2>
<p>MOE and ECDA said that the Phase 3 clinical trial of the vaccine has shown that the Pfizer BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for children in this age group. </p>
<p>The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has assessed that the “benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks”, the agencies added. </p>
<p>Currently, the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine is the only vaccine approved for children aged 5 to 11 in Singapore.</p>
<h2>WILL UNVACCINATED CHILDREN BE TREATED THE SAME?</h2>
<p>MOH said earlier in December that there are presently no plans to introduce vaccination-differentiated safe management measures for children aged 12 years and below</p>
<p>"The focus now is to ensure our children are well-protected by vaccination," MOH said.</p>
<p>MOE said during the news conference on Tuesday that when it comes to unvaccinated children taking part in "higher risk" activities, they will have to follow the "sensible thing" in accordance with the national regime.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore has begun reopening its borders to travellers as the country continues its transition to living with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Travellers from <a>more countries</a> can now serve their stay-home notice at their place of residence instead of a hotel, while visitors from selected countries can enter Singapore via quarantine-free <a>vaccinated travel lanes</a> (VTLs).</p>
<p>With three more VTLs set to open in the coming days, here’s what foreign visitors need to know about entering Singapore via the quarantine-free arrangement.</p>
<h2>WHO CAN TRAVEL TO SINGAPORE VIA VTL?</h2>
<p>As of Oct 28, Singapore has announced VTLs with 13 countries. Travellers are required to enter Singapore via dedicated flights.</p>
<p>They must have been fully vaccinated with a vaccine under the World Health Organization emergency use listing, at least two weeks before arriving in Singapore. They must also have met the minimum dose interval period for that vaccine if applicable.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated children aged 12 and below in the calendar year are allowed to travel to Singapore via VTL as long as they are accompanied by a fully vaccinated traveller.</p>
<a>Australia and Switzerland</a> on Nov 8, and to
<p>For Australia, two-way travel will initially only apply to fully vaccinated Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate families, due to the country's current border measures.</p>
<p>Under the VTL scheme, travellers must have remained in one or more of the VTL countries in the last 14 days before departure to Singapore.</p>
<h2>HOW DO I PROVE MY VACCINATION STATUS?</h2>
<p>In Singapore, residents use the <a>TraceTogether</a> or <a>HealthHub</a> apps to prove their vaccination status, so it is important for visitors to get their vaccination records reflected on either of those apps. </p>
<p>To do that, travellers should present their proof of vaccination to an Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) officer at immigration clearance on arrival. </p>
<p>Upon verification, their vaccination records will then be reflected electronically in TraceTogether or HealthHub.</p>
<p>Because TraceTogether is Singapore's contact tracing app, travellers are required to download it and register with their passport numbers.</p>
<p>The app will allow visitors to enter places like hotels, malls, restaurants and attractions - or any places that are regulated by Singapore’s vaccination-differentiated safe management measures. </p>
<p>Do note that the vaccinated status granted to visitors is only <a>valid for 30 days</a>.</p>
<a>Public Health Preparedness Clinic</a> to take a serology test. With a positive serology test result, travellers will have their vaccination records added to the National Immunisation Registry, and they will retain their vaccinated status.
<h2>WHAT ELSE MUST BE DONE BEFORE DEPARTURE?</h2>
<p>Short-term visitors and long-term pass holders travelling to Singapore must apply for a <a>vaccinated travel pass</a> (VTP) between seven and 60 days before they plan to enter the country.</p>
<p>Travellers who require a visa to enter Singapore will have to apply for one beforehand.</p>
<p>All short-term visitors travelling to Singapore via a VTL must have <a>travel insurance</a> with a minimum coverage of S$30,000 against COVID-19-related medical charges. Insurance can be obtained from insurers based in Singapore or overseas.</p>
<p>Although VTL travellers do not undergo quarantine in Singapore, they must still wait for the results of their on-arrival polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test before going about their activities in Singapore.</p>
