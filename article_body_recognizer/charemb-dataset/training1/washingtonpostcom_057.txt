<p>More than 4,000 children were hospitalized with covid-19 across the nation Wednesday, Washington Post figures show, marking a new high that towers above previous peaks set during the summer when the delta variant was driving up infections.</p>
<div><p>The tally, which includes confirmed as well as suspected pediatric covid-19 patients, reflects a steep rise in infections in that group. Less than two weeks ago, on Christmas, fewer than 2,000 children were in hospitals with covid. </p></div>
<div><div><p>The seven-day average of pediatric hospitalizations was slightly lower at 3,713. Hospitalizations of adults are also rising rapidly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, patients who have been more recently infected appear less likely to be hospitalized or put in intensive care, according to preliminary studies.</p></div></div>

<a>a recent study</a> done by researchers from Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine.
<div><div><p>But even with less severe symptoms, the increase in the number of covid-19 patients can still overwhelm hospitals and result in more patients with serious illness, <a>health experts say.</a></p></div></div>

<p>Covid-19 has killed more than 5 million people since the coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>More than a quarter-billion cases of the coronavirus have been reported in almost two years. Despite the rollout of vaccines, global health experts warn that the pandemic is set to continue.</p>
<p>On Dec. 15, <a>a top British health official </a>told Parliament that omicron was “probably the most significant threat we’ve had since the start of the pandemic.”</p>Jump to metric:
<h4>New daily reported cases across the world</h4>
<p>At least 299,260,123 have been reported since Feb. 29, 2020.</p>
<li>The spike in reported cases on Dec. 11, 2020 is due to a change in Turkey's reporting standards.</li>
<li>The spike in reported deaths on June 2, 2021 is due to a reclassification of more than 120,000 deaths in Peru that occurred between March 2020 and May 22, 2021.</li>

<p>[Why Africa is perilously far behind on coronavirus vaccination]</p>
<a>some other nations</a> have vaccinated a greater share of their population. A number of vaccines were developed and rolled out at record speed, and studies show most have impressive efficacy.
<p>Billions of doses have been administered around the world, far more than the number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. However, a large number of cases were probably never recorded, experts caution.</p>
<p>The rise of omicron, which was first detected in southern Africa in November, may widen the global divide on vaccinations.</p>

<b>Krystalline, Roswell, N.M.</b>
<a>vaccinated</a> but can’t — such as
<a>people who are allergic</a> to vaccine components or had severe allergic reactions after getting a first shot.
<div><p>What to do if your flight is delayed or canceled</p></div>
<div><p>The first question to ask yourself is whether your upcoming trip is absolutely necessary, says <a>LetsGetChecked</a> chief medical officer Robert Mordkin. Can you delay a month or at least a few weeks until the current surge <a>wanes?</a></p></div>
<div><div><p>If the trip can’t wait, consider driving to your destination. You will be better able to control your environment and social distance from other people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not traveling is choice number one. Traveling by car is choice number two,” says Katie Passaretti, medical director of infection prevention of health-care company <a>Atrium Health</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California at Irvine, agrees — to an extent.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The best travel advice of 2021, from By The Way Concierge</p></div>
<div><div><p>Step one: Get a good <a>mask</a> and make sure it fits correctly. Madad suggests an N95, KN95 or KN94 mask for travelers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because everyone has a unique face shape, Noymer says you may need to purchase multiple mask options from different brands to find one that seals your nose and mouth the best.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The airline lost your luggage. Now what?</p></div>
<div><div><p>While traveling, refrain from taking off the mask in shared public spaces, Madad says. If you need to eat or drink something, she recommends finding a less crowded place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Passaretti also recommends booking a <a>window seat</a>, where you will be farther from passengers walking up and down the aisles, and turning on the overhead air vent to improve the air flow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These tips are, of course, in addition to coronavirus-prevention basics such as cleaning your hands often and social distancing from people when possible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finally, it may be worth having another conversation with your doctor about your vaccination status.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mordkin recommends confirming with your physician that you are still not a candidate for coronavirus vaccination, as it remains the most effective defense against severe illness or death from a covid-19 infection.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>How to cancel flights, hotels and other holiday bookings as omicron surges</h1></div><h2>Guidance for adjusting plane tickets and more reservations if the covid wave makes you want to cancel your trip</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 20, 2021 at 3:38 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>U.S. health experts are bracing for record coronavirus numbers this winter due to the rapid spread of the <a>omicron variant</a>, and travelers are debating whether to rethink their trips over <a>the holidays</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Tara Cappel, founder and CEO of the <a>For the Love of Travel</a> agency, said her company is seeing requests to cancel or postpone trips in the near future, but ones set for February and onward remain untouched.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s also destination-specific,” Cappel said in an email. “We’re not seeing cancellations for trips to Central and South America at this point.”</p></div></div>
<a>TripIt</a>, said that now that we are entering the third year of the pandemic, more travelers have prioritized flexible bookings in preparation of unexpected surges.
<div><p>Battles are being waged over airline refunds. Passengers aren’t always winning.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Canceling a flight</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Airlines largely instituted flexible cancellation policies during the pandemic, but you aren’t likely to get a cash refund. Expect a voucher or credit instead.</p></div></div>
<a>Department of Transportation regulations</a>.
<div><div><p>Unless you cancel a flight <a>within 24 hours of booking</a>, which entitles you to a full refund, results for canceling will otherwise vary depending on what type of ticket you purchased.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to extend your flight credits and vouchers</p></div>
<a>make changes on basic economy flights</a> without charges
<a>through the end of the year</a>.
<a>some tricks for getting through faster.</a> Your best bet may be trying the airline through their online chats, text or social media.

<div><div><h3><div>Canceling a hotel</div></h3></div></div>
<a>says</a> its properties may adjust their cancellation policies during high-demand periods, so guests are encouraged to review cancellation, deposit and refund policies for the specific dates they have booked.
<div><div><p>What you’re able to do will come down to the terms at the time you booked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Are you striking out when you try to negotiate a refund with the hotel? Keyes says that when all else fails, call your credit card company.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Every credit card and bank has a process where you can dispute a charge if you’ve paid for something and you didn’t receive that service,” Keyes said.</p></div></div>
<a>are limits</a> to what a credit card dispute can get you. Keyes uses this step as a last resort, because the process can be more of a bureaucratic hassle than going to a merchant directly.

<div><div><h3><div>Canceling an Airbnb</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Airbnb instituted more flexible booking policies on listings earlier this year, but a <a>coronavirus</a> surge doesn’t guarantee you a refund. Normally, getting your money back from an Airbnb is between you and the host.</p></div></div>
<p>While Airbnb created a <a>COVID-19 Extenuating Circumstances policy,</a> it says reservations for stays and experiences after March 14, 2020, aren’t covered “except where the guest or host is currently sick with COVID-19.”</p>
<div><p>What to do if coronavirus variants leave you stranded overseas</p></div>
<a>we have reported before</a>, it is not impossible to get an Airbnb host to give you a refund outside of the listing’s policies. While hosts might not be obligated to make any exceptions, you can still
<a>ask nicely</a> and may end up getting what you want.
<div><div><h3><div>Canceling a rental car</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Luckily, most rental cars offer refundable reservations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Canceling a cruise</div></h3></div></div>
<a>many cruise booking and cancellation policies</a>. As a result, Ball said, it’s easier now to make changes without incurring extra fees. Deposits may be nonrefundable, but you may be able to get a voucher to use at a later date.

<header><div><h1>How to make holiday flights less stressful, according to flight attendants</h1></div><h2>Prevent airport anxiety around Christmas with omicron and unruly passengers looming</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 21, 2021 at 2:28 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>plan on traveling for Christmas and New Year’s Eve</a>, and millions already have. On Tuesday, the Transportation Security Administration
<a>announced</a> its agents screened more than 2 million people at its checkpoints for the fifth day in a row.
<div><div><p>“The airports have been packed,” says Miami-based flight attendant <a>Sharmy Aldama</a>, who will be flying on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day and the ensuing days. “It’s definitely more stressful.”</p></div></div>
<a>reports</a> of unruly passengers this year, a massive uptick from past years.
<div><div><p>Before you begin your own holiday travels, here are six tips from flight attendants to make your trip — and theirs — a little nicer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Bring (TSA-approved) snacks to the airport</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Make sure that you have at least a protein bar or something of sustenance just in case there is a delay,” says Sara Nelson, international president of the <a>Association of Flight Attendants-CWA. </a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Oakland-based flight attendant <a>Elizabeth Simpson</a> also recommends bringing a reusable water bottle so you don’t have to buy one at the airport to stay hydrated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Empty your bag before packing</div></h3></div></div>
<a>TSA website</a>, app and social media chats are good resources to double-check so your luggage doesn’t get confiscated at security.
<div><div><p>One last note on packing: Simpson has been telling travelers to pack portable chargers and ear buds.</p></div></div>
<div><p>4 flight attendants (and a pilot) share their skin-care tips for flying with masks</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Give yourself time for extra-long lines</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>As Aldama mentioned, it is crowded out there. With millions of people on the move for Christmas and New Year’s, you can expect to find hectic airports full of hurried travelers.</p></div></div>
<a>according to airport insiders</a> — to get to the airport and pass through security, particularly if you are traveling with a large family or small children, bringing an animal, or needing wheelchair assistance.
<div><p>How to travel with your pet this holiday season</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Don’t abuse mask loopholes</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Particularly as coronavirus cases surge again, Nelson says, it is critical to follow the core <a>CDC recommendations</a> for coronavirus safety, namely remaining masked on board.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Leave your mask complaints at home</div></h3></div></div>
<a> it may always be necessary </a>to mask up on planes.
<div><div><p>If you do want to complain, do not direct your frustrations at the flight attendants. They don’t make the policy, and enforcing the rule throughout every flight is exhausting for them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to cancel flights, hotels and other holiday bookings as omicron surges</p></div>
<a>unruly passengers</a>. The agency can propose fines up to $37,000 per violation, and one incident can yield multiple violations. The agency has proposed more than
<a>$1.45 million</a> in fines this year. More than 4,000 of the FAA’s unruly passenger reports this year have been mask-related.
<div><div><h3><div>Pause to say hi to the crew</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The easiest way to make your flight — and the crew’s — a little better is to show common courtesy. Make eye contact and greet the staff while you’re boarding.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>According to a <a>Psychological Science study</a>, briefly locking eyes can enhance your well-being.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>“</b>Put your phone down for just a minute and look up,” Nelson says. “That personal connection is super important.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nelson says receiving gifts is rare for flight attendants, and they deeply appreciate the gesture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They love the acknowledgment more than the gift,” she says, adding that “a drawing from a little kid” might carry the most sentimental value.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>From airport WiFi to ‘juice jacking’: 7 ways to protect your data when traveling</h1></div><h2>Travel can be full of cybercrime land mines. Here are expert tips to avoid them. </h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 22, 2021 at 4:48 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Whether your online data is locked down may be the last thing on your mind as you rush through the airport checking departure times and work emails.</p></div></div>
<a>Lookout</a>, points out that we may have been taught to install protections like anti-virus software on our computers, but our personal devices remain vulnerable — and a preferred entry point for cybercriminals.
<div><div><p>“They leverage the trust we have in these devices against us and know that they’re a treasure trove of personal and corporate data,” Schless said in an email.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the risks, “there are certainly ways to be safe,” said Paige Hanson, chief of cyber safety education at the anti-virus and security software company <a>Norton</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are seven ways travelers can protect themselves against hackers.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Let By The Way help you navigate travel dilemmas</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Scrutinize the public WiFi options before connecting</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The public WiFi we often rely on away from home can be filled with cybersecurity land mines. Places with lingering travelers — like airports, train stations and coffee shops — can be prime targets.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hanson said travelers should treat their public WiFi use “like someone is looking over your shoulder” and avoid logging into sensitive accounts such as your bank, medical provider or even social media.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to extend your flight credits and vouchers</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Use your own charger</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another significant risk for travelers is using a charger that isn’t yours, Schless said. He warns against ever accepting a stranger’s offer to borrow their charging cord.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Attackers can exploit USB cords and load malicious software into them that loads itself onto your device the second you plug it in,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Testing French Bee’s new cheap flight from New York to Paris</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Turn off auto-connect functions</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>If your personal devices are programmed to auto-connect to WiFi networks, Hanson recommended turning that off while traveling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Additionally, she said, travelers should turn off their WiFi and Bluetooth when not in use for further protection.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There is an added bonus to turning off these settings: You’ll save precious battery power.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Turn on account alerts before travel</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>To stay up to date on your accounts while traveling, Crockett told travelers to turn on alerts for their credit card and banking apps. Doing so will let the company alert you if there is unusual spending or log-ins.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Crockett also advised travelers to know how to lock their debit or credit cards before hitting the road. If you lose or misplace them during the trip, you can lock them to prevent fraudulent use.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to cancel flights, hotels and other bookings due to variant concerns</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Add two-factor authentication or biometric log-ins</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Two-factor verification works</a> by requiring both a password and a unique code. Even if a hacker had your password, they would need to physically have one of your personal devices to get the code for the second step.
<div><div><p>Even better: Hanson suggests enabling biometrics — i.e., a fingerprint or face ID — to open your devices or apps.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Consider a VPN</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hanson warned against using a free VPN. “If it’s free, you might be the product,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another option is downloading a security app for your phone to prevent mobile phishing attacks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>That email asking for proof of vaccination might be a phishing scam</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Be wary of subscription renewal emails</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“On mobile devices, these campaigns can be executed across SMS, email, social media platforms, third-party chatting apps, gaming and even dating apps,” Schless said.</p></div></div>
<p>For example, Crane Hassold, director of threat intelligence at Abnormal Security, a cloud email security platform, said he has recently noticed cyberattacks targeting travelers by impersonating the Transportation Security Administration via email.</p>
<div><div><p>While TSA does send renewal reminder emails, travelers should go directly through the <a>TSA website</a> for information on their existing accounts.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 23, 2021 at 12:21 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Through the constant travel whiplash of 2021, we scrambled to keep up with border closures and testing requirements. We learned about new variants and vaccines.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We compiled that advice through our By The Way Concierge column, and to end the year, we’re revisiting our most helpful tips to prepare you for 2022 travels. And as always, <a>send us your latest dilemmas. </a></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Are PreCheck, Global Entry or CLEAR still worth it?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Should I get TSA PreCheck or Global Entry? Are they worth it?</b></i></p></div></div>
<div><p>The airport can be so unpredictable these days. Any of these line-cutting services may be a godsend one day, and completely unnecessary the next. Your travel style and where you are traveling most may also be <a>part of the equation.</a></p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How should I handle holiday visits to unvaccinated households?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>How should I handle visits (after air travel) to households where some members are unvaccinated?</b></i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While <a>the subject of vaccinations</a> with families can be a thorny subject during the holidays, experts agreed on some key tools to get you through it: tests, masks and gathering outside.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>My Airbnb host won’t refund me. How can I get my money back?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Airbnb host refused to refund me even though Airbnb has asked multiple times. Am I entitled to a refund? I have met all the Extenuating Circumstances besides canceling the reservation myself.</b></i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The airline rescheduled our flight. What can we do?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While a rescheduled flight is definitely a hassle, you might want to keep the new itinerary unless it significantly upsets travel plans. <a>Here’s why.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How do I find a coronavirus test in a foreign country?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Please explain how you can obtain a coronavirus test for reentry to the U.S. when you do not know the location, cost, procedure or language to get this service.</b></i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Packing <a>your own test may be the best move</a>, but many hotels offer to arrange testing to take some of the stress off travelers. The specifics will vary from property to property.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Will travel insurance protect your trip as covid spreads?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Travel insurance is not one-size-fits-all. <a>Policies and what they cover can vary wildly</a>. And everyone’s will be priced differently. If you are looking for a policy that covers covid, you should expect to pay even more.</p></div>

<a>have steadily continued into the new year</a>. After U.S. airlines navigated the Thanksgiving bump relatively unscathed, this was the
<a>“messy” holiday travel</a> season some experts envisioned.
<a>omicron variant</a> for sending their crews to sick leave or isolation after being identified in contact tracing. Winter weather
<a>in the East Coast</a>, the Pacific Northwest and hub cities like Chicago and Atlanta has exacerbated the industry’s struggles, even as
<a>new guidance</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends cutting isolation time in half.
<div><p>Back in the summer, a <a>chaotic travel season</a> rife with staffing shortages, By The Way <a>compiled a guide</a> for what to do if your flight gets canceled and how to get a refund you are owed. Here’s a helpful reminder.</p></div>
<div><p>Teachable moments from cancellation horror stories</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If your flight gets canceled</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The bad news is your flight has been canceled. The good news is the airline owes you a refund; <a>Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations</a> entitle you to one.</p></div></div>
<a>inundated with requests</a> for months, pushing the DOT to crack down on wrongful denials and investigate delays in payment. In November, following an investigation into Air Canada, the airline reached a
<a>$4.5 million settlement</a> with DOT, saying it had provided $570 million in required refunds over the course of the pandemic.
<a>18 months starting in January 2020,</a> it received 124,918 consumer complaints related to air travel — more than 84 percent of which were about refunds. That compares with about 8 percent a year before the pandemic.
<div><p>How to get in touch with airlines in a hurry</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If your flight gets delayed</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Scott’s Cheap Flights</a> founder Scott Keyes. “If your flight were to get canceled, what are flights that this airline has that would work for me and my schedule?”
<div><div><p>Once you have picked a new flight that works for you, get on the phone with customer service and request it specifically.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s going to be much more fruitful than saying, ‘My flight got canceled, what do I do?’ ” Keyes said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Omicron may be on your next flight. Here's how to protect yourself.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If you want to be protected</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>There are a few things you can do to put yourself in a better position for this uncertain time of flying.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Protecting yourself starts when you book the flight. Brian Kelly, the founder and chief executive of <a>the Points Guy</a>, recommends booking your flights with frequent flier miles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Most airline frequent-flier programs will actually refund your points and taxes and fees, so it’s kind of like buying a refundable ticket,” Kelly said. “They give you maximum flexibility.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Look for nonstop flights to your destination that depart earlier in the day. You will have fewer variables to deal with, and should something go wrong, you’ll have more rerouting options than if you were departing later.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Keyes strongly urges travelers to skip checking a bag.</p></div></div>
