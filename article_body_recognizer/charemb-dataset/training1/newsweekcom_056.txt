<p>GIGLIO ISLAND Italy (Reuters) - Italian authorities gave the green light to refloating the wrecked Costa Concordia cruise ship on Saturday, setting the stage for the next step in the largest maritime salvage in history to begin on Monday morning.</p>
<p>The operation to raise the 290-metre hulk from underwater platforms next to the Italian island of Giglio where it sank, killing 32 people, should take six or seven days, the group organizing the removal said.</p>
<p>The refloating will go ahead if the summer weather remains calm, and then the Concordia, which is around two and a half times the size of the Titanic, is due to be towed to the northern port of Genoa to be scrapped.</p>
<p>The government's Civil Protection Department said that documentation submitted for the refloat was "valid", allowing it "to give the go-ahead for the operation to refloat the Concordia".</p>
<p>The defunct luxury liner is due to depart Giglio on July 21, two and a half years after it struck a reef while performing a display maneuver to move close to shore and "salute" the port.</p>
<p>Residents of the tiny island, which depends on tourism, hope this stage in the salvage will repeat the success of a complex "parbuckling" operation which stabilized the wreck last year.</p>
<p>"I am happy they are taking it away because to see a ship like that always there, with the deaths that happened, it gives us the shivers," said ferry worker Italo Arienti.</p>
<p>The ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, is on trial accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship. He is fighting the charges.</p>
<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>Costa Concordia Re-Floated</h1><div> By Reuters <time>On 7/14/14 at 11:09 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>GIGLIO Italy (Reuters) - The wreck of the luxury liner Costa Concordia was re-floated on Monday and will soon be towed away and broken up for scrap, more than two years after it capsized off the Italian coast, killing 32 people.</p>
<p>The 290-meter Costa Concordia ran aground on rocks near the Tuscan holiday island of Giglio on Jan. 13, 2013. The rusting hulk of the once-gleaming-white ship had been resting on a temporary platform since being righted a year ago.</p>
<p>Franco Porcellachia, the engineer in charge of the salvage, said at a news conference around seven hours after the operation began that the hulk had been raised two metres out of the water.</p>
<p>Tug boats attached with cables to the ship then started shifting it away from the shore. "I would say we are halfway through our plan to move the ship," Porcellachia said.</p>
<p>Later on Monday, the vessel will be stabilised with chains and cables. Work will start again on Tuesday to prepare it for towing within days to Genoa in northern Italy, to be scrapped.</p>
<p>Porcellachia said the sixth deck of the ship had started to emerge on Monday, and once that was fully above the water the other decks would become visible in quick succession.</p>
<p>"When deck 3 re-emerges we are in the final stage and ready for departure," Porcellachia said. The wreck is due to depart Giglio on July 21.</p>
<p>The ship's captain, Francesco Schettino, is on trial on charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck as he sailed too close to shore to "salute" the port, and abandoning ship. He is fighting the charges.</p>
<p>Once the Concordia has left Giglio, the search will continue for the body of the last person who was aboard the Concordia the night it sank and has not been accounted for.</p>
<p>"We are undertaking an operation that will close a dramatic chapter for our country," Italian Environment MinisterGian Luca Galletti said at the news conference.</p>
<p>The cruise liner will be demolished and scrapped in Genoa by a consortium including oil services company Saipem and Genoa-based companies Mariotti and San Giorgio.</p>
<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>Concordia Aftermath: What to Know Before Boarding a Cruise Ship</h1><div> By Eve Conant <time>On 7/16/12 at 1:00 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>What vacationers don't think about when they take a cruise is how, precisely, the industry has managed to keep its prices so low and still rake in huge profits in a down economy. The quick answer: it controls labor costs.</p>
<p>ROME (Reuters) - An Italian court convicted the former captain of the Costa Concordia cruise liner on Wednesday for his role in the 2012 shipwreck that killed 32 people and sentenced him to 16 years in prison.</p>
<p>Francesco Schettino was commanding the vessel, a floating hotel as long as three football pitches, when it came too close to shore and hit rocks off the Tuscan holiday island of Giglio.</p>
<p>Schettino was charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship in one of the highest-profile shipping disasters in recent years.</p>
<p>However it is far from certain whether he will actually go to jail before the end of Italy's long appeals process, which can take years.</p>

<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Ex-Army Generals Fear Insurrection or 'Civil War' in 2024</h1><div> By Darragh Roche <time>On 12/18/21 at 4:47 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> News Capitol Riots <a>Civil war</a></div>
<p>Three retired U.S. Army generals have warned of insurrection or possibly even civil war if the results of the 2024 presidential election are not accepted by sections of the military.</p>
<p>Retired Major Generals Paul D. Eaton and Antonio M. Taguba joined retired Brigadier General Steven M. Anderson urged today's leaders to act to prevent such scenes, calling on today's leaders to "war-game" an attempted coup.</p>
<p>They warned of the potential for "total breakdown of the chain of command along partisan lines" and the risk of a "shadow government" led by a losing candidate who refuses to concede defeat, directly referencing former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>"In short: We are chilled to our bones at the thought of a coup succeeding next time," they wrote.</p>
<p>And they outlined four preventative steps they argue should be taken:</p>
<li>First, the leaders of the Capitol riot should be held accountable. They called on the <a>Department of Justice</a>, the House of Representatives' Select Committee investigating January 6 and Congress to "show more urgency."</li>
<li>The Army's actions should also involve finding and removing "potential mutineers" and stopping efforts to subvert the chain of command through propaganda.</li>
<li>Finally, the generals advised the Department of Defense to war-game a potential insurrection or attempted coup following the 2024 presidential election "to identify weak spots" and deal with them.</li>
<a>have also pushed these unsubstantiated claims</a>.
<p>The generals warned that while U.S. service members take an oath to uphold the Constitution, in the case of a disputed election, loyalties would be split and some might choose to follow orders from the losing candidate who does not accept defeat.</p>
<p>"Under such a scenario, it is not outlandish to say a military breakdown could lead to civil war," they wrote. If such a situation were to arise, the generals warn the enemies of the U.S. could take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the generals seemed hopeful that could be prevented if <a>Congress</a> and the military "take decisive action now."</p>
