<div> October 29, 2021 11:37am <div> Updated <div> October 29, 2021 11:38am </div> </div> </div>
<p>You’ve heard of “Hot Girl Summer” — now, get ready for “Hot Girl Halloween.”</p>
<p>The queen of “real hot girl s–t” Megan Thee Stallion dropped a new album of unreleased songs titled “Something for Thee Hotties” on Friday.</p>
<p>Released just in time for a spooktacular <a>Halloween</a>, she <a>teased the album art</a> earlier in the week, which features her dressed as a devil in glowing ember red.</p>
<p>While the album has a collection of various uncut tracks, verses that never made the final song edits and more, it also features older songs such as “Thot S–t” and “Tuned In Freestyle” with previously unheard lyrics.</p>
<p>Originally, she was only going to release 16 songs but expanded the tracklist earlier this week on the eve of its release.</p>
<p>“It’s worth thee wait,” <a>she tweeted</a>, along with the surprise news.</p>
<p>Naturally, her “hotties” <a>were thrilled</a>.</p>
<p>“Please don’t talk to me, I’m Megan today,” <a>tweeted</a> one fan.</p>
<a>Megan Monday Freestyle</a>,” in which she raps, “It was the knees for him, the way that it squeeze for him, he done f–ked a whole lotta b—hes, but it was the me for him.”
<p>Earlier in the week, the self-proclaimed “Hot Girl Meg” announce she <a>is preparing to graduate </a>from Texas Southern University, where she <a>attended school part-time </a>while growing her rap career and fanbase.</p>
<p>The notable musician also <a>led award nominations </a>earlier this year at various award shows, including <a>winning her first Grammy </a>for Best Rap Performance for “Savage (Remix).”</p>

<h1> ‘Traumatized’ nurses rally social media for national walkout over work conditions</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 11, 2022 4:05pm <div> Updated <div> January 11, 2022 4:06pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The nurses are sick and tired!</p>
<p>“Nurses have been leaving the bedside at unprecedented rates since the pandemic hit,” she added. “And many are never going back because the trauma and systemic mistreatment has been too much.” </p>
<p>Warren sparked the now-trending conversation about a national nurse walkout in a TikTok clip shared Monday, following a viral post in which she revealed that an unruly patient once strangled her with her own stethoscope. </p>
<p>“It was traumatizing,” she explained of the 2019 incident. “I was doing my initial assessment on a patient and had my stethoscope around my neck, and the patient grabbed onto it with two hands and pulled me backwards.”</p>
<p>Warren — who chose not to reveal the patient’s gender — said the person was suffering with some dementia, but had no previously reported outbursts of violence on health care workers. </p>
<p>“I had to use so much strength to pull away that I thought I was going to break my stethoscope,” she added. </p>
<p>And she never reported the incident to hospital administrators. </p>
<p>“There seems to be this weird idea amongst nurses that things like this happen in nurses,” Warren said. “That <a>violence comes with the territory</a>, it comes with the job.”</p>
<p>But nurses, by and large, are no longer willing to excuse the abuse. </p>
<a>need a national walkout</a>. It’ll take six hours before we get everything we deserve.” Warren concurred, writing, “Regarding a national walkout, I think it’ll happen soon.”
<p>She’s already reduced her bedside presence, transitioning from full-time to part-time nursing in January 2021 due to the agony she endured on the job the prior year.</p>
<p>“I suffered severe mental burnout and anguish during 2020,” she said. “What contributed to that was the shortage of PPE — having to reuse N95 masks for multiple shifts for weeks at a time.”</p>
<a>shortage of nurse support staff members</a> — including certified nurse assistants, who provide basic care to patients, and environmental service workers, who provide housekeeping services to patients and health care workers. 
<p>And when it came to requesting more money for the hospital’s fatigued employees, the admins wouldn’t budge on the budget. </p>
<p>Instead, her CNO suggested appeasing stress-ridden staffers with a 2020 commemorative coin. </p>
<p>“I told him, ‘Hell no!’” Warren said. “But that exchange helped me see that I wasn’t worth one more dollar to my hospital system.”</p>
<p>And she believes a collective walkout might show the system how unjustly it’s treating its most essential workers. </p>
<a>Doctors have held walkouts</a> before, and it’s not about abandoning our sick patients. A nurse walkout would be a demonstration to ensure that everyone receives adequate pay, benefits, support and care.”
<p>When reached by The Post for comment, the American Nursing Association said they can provide a spokesperson about nursing/COVID in general — but “we can’t speak to nurse walkouts at this time.”</p>
<p>But supporters of the impending movement took to Twitter, encouraging Warren to lead the charge in the great nurse exodus. </p>
<p>“Do it. These things make history and are the only things that improve working conditions, historically,” one advocate tweeted in part. </p>
<a>ER wait times </a>hit 96 hours, or when incoming ambulances have to be redirected more than 500 miles [change will happen],” rallied another. 
<p>But while a number of hyped health care workers and their online allies strategized a mass retreat, other nurses expressed regret over the thought of abandoning those in need. </p>
<p>And Warren agrees. </p>
<h1> Twitter bans account linked to Iran’s supreme leader over Trump assassination threat</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 16, 2022 1:53pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 1:54pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Twitter permanently suspended an account linked to Iran’s supreme leader after it promoted a video depicting the assassination of former President Donald Trump, according to a report. </p>
<p>The social media giant said its top priority is keeping people safe and protecting the health of conversations on the platform.</p>
<p>The account, linked to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, posted an animated video of a drone last week targeting Trump as he is golfing near Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Florida.</p>
<p>The clip called for revenge for <a>the death of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani,</a> the commander of the elite Quds Force who was killed in a drone strike ordered by Trump near the Baghdad airport on Jan. 3, 2020.</p>
<p>In the video, titled “Revenge is Definite,” a robot spots Trump playing golf with a small group and calls in a drone strike. </p>
<p><a>The former president,</a> who has been suspended by Twitter because of his posts about the Capitol riot, and his supporters have urged the platform to take action against Iran for calling for violence against Israel and the US.</p>
<p>Other accounts associated with Khamenei are still online. </p>

<h1> Harris appointee to meet with Latino lawmakers over old immigration tweets</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 9:42am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 10:14am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Vice President Kamala Harris’ newly appointed communications director will meet with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus this week to discuss old tweets of his that resurfaced this month about undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>Jamal Simmons, 50, who was named to his new position in the first week of January, is set to meet virtually with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus on Thursday, sources told CBS News.</p>
<p>Simmons had received backlash from pundits and politicians on both sides of the aisle for several tweets from 2010, which appeared to call for the deportation of undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>“Just saw 2 undocumented folks talking on MSNBC. One Law student the other a protester. Can someone explain why ICE is not picking them up?” he wrote in <a>November 2010</a>.</p>
<p>“I’ll try this again,” read another tweet posted the same day. “Just saw 2 undocumented folks talking on MSNBC and have a serious legal question. Why wouldn’t ICE pick them up?” </p>
<p>“We shld harden borders ease visas/find ways to bring undocumented into legal status/punish employers. My was common sense one,” Simmons insisted <a>in a third tweet</a>.</p>
<p>Simmons has since apologized for the tweets, explaining that during his experience as a pundit, he “tweeted a lot of and spoken out on public issues.” </p>
<p>“As a pundit for much of my career I have tweeted a lot and spoken out on public issues. Sometimes I have been sarcastic, unclear, or just plainly missed the mark,” he said in a statement. </p>
<p>Since the tweets have resurfaced, several Latino lawmakers are looking to chat with the vice president’s communications director, calling his remarks “stunning.” </p>
<p>“The statements that Jamal made were just stunning, beyond stunning. Words cannot describe my feelings,” Rep. Lou Correa (D-Calif.) <a>told Axios</a>, adding that he might ask Simmons if he is a President Donald Trump supporter.</p>
<p>“I am being public about it, because he was public. He was honest. And I am being honest. And that’s what the public deserves.”</p>
<p>People familiar with the matter told the outlet that Correa, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) and Reps. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia (D-Ill.) and Norma Torres (D-Calif.) are the key lawmakers offended by the posts. </p>
<p>A White House official confirmed the plans for the Thursday meeting to <a>CBS News</a>, noting that the meeting was “mutually agreed.” </p>
<a>repeatedly insisted</a> that President George W. Bush’s first presidential election victory was “illegitimate.”

<h1> Adidas sells Reebok to Authentic Brands for $2.5 billion</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> August 12, 2021 2:32pm <div> Updated <div> August 12, 2021 2:32pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Adidas is selling Reebok to Authentic Brands Group for up to 2.1 billion euros ($2.5 billion) as the German sporting goods company concentrates on its core brand after a deal that did not deliver.</p>
<p>Adidas bought Reebok for $3.8 billion in 2006 to help compete with arch-rival Nike, but its sluggish performance prompted repeated calls from investors to sell the U.S. and Canada focused brand.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Adidas managed to eat into Nike’s dominance in the United States with its own brand, helped by partnership with celebrities like Kanye West, Beyonce and Pharrell Williams.</p>
<p>Over 11 years, ABG has amassed more than 30 labels sold in some 6,000 stores. Its brands include apparel chains Aéropostale and Forever21, as well as and Sports Illustrated magazine.</p>
<p>“We’ve had our sights set on Reebok for many years, and we’re excited to finally bring this iconic brand into the fold,” Jamie Salter, founder, chairman and CEO of ABG, said.</p>
<p>“We are committed to preserving Reebok’s integrity, innovation, and values – including its presence in bricks and mortar,” he added.</p>
<p>Last month, ABG also filed for a U.S. initial public offering after a year of strong earnings growth.</p>
<p>Adidas reported last week that Reebok’s first-half sales jumped to 823 million euros from 600 million a year ago, and the brand made a net gain of 68 million euros compared to a net loss of 69 million in the first half of 2020.</p>
<p>Reebok’s recent collaborations with celebrities like Cardi B and a renewed focus on women’s apparel have put it in a better place, analysts say.</p>
<p>Adidas has already sold, for 400 million euros, the Rockport, CCM Hockey and Greg Norman brands that were part of the original Reebok purchase.</p>
<p>The German company said in a statement that the sale had no impact on its financial outlook for the current year or for its targets set out in the five-year strategy it announced in March.</p>
<p>Adidas said the majority of the 2.1 billion euros would be paid in cash at the closing of the transaction, expected in the first quarter of 2022, with the remaining comprised of a deferred and contingent consideration.</p>
<p>It said it would share the majority of the cash proceeds with its shareholders. ($1 = 0.8526 euros) </p>

<h1> The airline dress codes Olivia Culpo and others don’t know about</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 14, 2022 7:37pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 4:24pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Gone are the days when people got gussied up to fly on airplanes — but unbeknownst to many passengers, airlines still have some expectation of decorum. </p>
<p>Former Miss Universe Olivia Culpo found out the hard way that certain outfits aren’t permitted on passenger aircraft when she was asked to “cover up” before boarding an American Airlines flight to Cabo on Thursday.</p>
<p>The next month, another woman claimed she was booted from an Alaska Airlines flight for <a>how she looked</a>. </p>
<p>Here’s everything we know about the few vague, public rules major US airlines have regarding onboard dress requirements.</p>
<p>The Post has contacted JetBlue and United for further comment.</p>
<p>Following a 2017 incident in which United wouldn’t let a group of teens onto a flight due to their leggings, Delta cheekily took to Twitter to reveal that the bottoms are fully allowed aboard their planes.</p>
<a>tweeted</a> at the time, before
<a>adding</a> in response to a question, “We don’t have an item-specific clothing policy, but we encourage no swimwear, sleepwear or underwear as your outerwear.”
<p>A higher standard, however, is expected of those affiliated with the airline. </p>
<p>“We ask our employees and their family and friends flying on pass privileges to use their best judgment when deciding what to wear on a flight,” a Delta spokesperson <a>told Travel + Leisure</a> following the Culpo incident.</p>
<p>United <a>made headlines</a> in 2017 for not allowing individuals onto their flight due to their leggings. </p>
<p>The move sparked widespread online outrage, with critics including a slew of Hollywood celebrities accusing United of being sexist and body-shaming the girls.</p>
<p>“[United] humiliated everyone. They’re sexualizing young girls,” witness Shannon Watts raged to The Post <a>after tweeting about the incident</a>, which she called “leggings-gate.’’</p>
<p>Model Chrissy Teigen <a>added in a tweet</a>, “I have flown United before with literally no pants on. Just a top as a dress. Next time I will wear only jeans and a scarf.”</p>
<p>However, the company subsequently made clear that leggings are, in fact, allowed on flights, <a>tweeting</a>, “To our customers…your leggings are welcome!” </p>
<p>The teens, however, had been pass riders, who are held to a higher standard of dress than general customers.</p>
<a>told Travel + Leisure</a> in a statement.
<p>This includes face masks: A couple was recently <a>banned from flying on JetBlue</a> after they refused to wear their face masks properly and abused crew members on a San Diego-bound flight.</p>
<p>The airline said the passengers were asked several times to properly wear their face coverings before takeoff but they ignored the federal mandate,<a> News10 ABC reported</a>.</p>
<a>accused the company</a> of banning her from her flight over her attire.
<a>airline’s Conditions of Carriage</a>, which specify that passengers are expected to “Dress appropriately; bare feet or offensive clothing aren’t allowed.”
<a>who told her she couldn’t fly while wearing her low-cut leopard-print top</a>, according to a report.
<p>Eve J. Marie, who was headed from Dallas to Tulsa, told Jam Press that the crew member told her she’d have to change out of the revealing outfit because it violated the airline’s dress code.</p>
<p>“When they threatened to remove me off the plane if I didn’t have a change of clothes, I felt completely humiliated, embarrassed and highly offended,” the buxom Instagram influencer told the outlet.</p>
<p>A woman who <a>claims she was booted from a plane</a> because her “stomach was showing” says she was actually discriminated against for being a “fat, tattooed, mixed-race woman.”</p>
<p>Fairbanks, Alaska, resident Ray Lin Howard, 33, alleges she was harassed by Alaska Airlines staffers. In turn, she did what people do these days to state her case: She took to TikTok to post a now-viral video.</p>

<h1> April Ashley, Vogue model and transgender trailblazer, dead at 86</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 29, 2021 12:30pm <div> Updated <div> December 29, 2021 12:30pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Trailblazing transgender model April Ashley has died at the age of 86.</p>
<p>Ashley — born George Jamieson — underwent gender reassignment surgery in 1960, before embarking on an international modeling career that landed her on the pages of Vogue.</p>
<p>The British beauty was photographed by both Robert Bailey and Terence Donovan, and reportedly romanced a string of A-list heartthrobs, including Michael Hutchence and Omar Sharif.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elvis Presley, Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali were all said to have been smitten with the model.</p>
<p>But Ashley — who was only the second British person to undergo male-to-female gender reassignment surgery — was often subjected to public ridicule at a time where LGBTQ+ people were largely excluded from the spotlight. </p>
<p>In her later years, however, Ashley became widely recognized for her role in championing transgender causes. At the age of 80, she advised the actor Eddie Redmayne on how to play a trans woman for his 2015 film “The Danish Girl.”</p>
<p>The model passed away at home in London on Monday. The news was first reported by the Liverpool Echo, and a cause of death has not yet been disclosed. </p>
<p>Ashley was born George Jamieson in 1935 to a working-class couple who had five other children. As a young boy, Ashley said she felt like a stranger in her own body. </p>
<p>Ashley later fled to Paris and worked in a nightclub, saving up £1,500 ($2,000 USD) to undergo gender reassignment surgery in Morocco. </p>
<p>After undergoing the groundbreaking procedure in 1960, George officially became named April Ashley and returned to the UK, where she embarked on a successful modeling career. </p>
<p>In 1961, the British tabloid Sunday People outed Ashley as a trans woman, causing a significant stir at the time. However, her undeniable beauty meant her modeling career survived in spite of the biases she encountered. </p>
<p>In London’s swinging ’60s, she partied with artists including Dali and Picasso and was a fixture on the social scene. </p>
<p>Ashley married twice. Her first union was with British aristocrat Arthur Corbett, who famously had the marriage annulled on the grounds that Ashley was “a man.” She tied the knot for a second time to Jeffrey West in the 1980s. </p>
<p>However, it was her reported romances with high-profile heartthrobs that garnered the most attention. </p>
<p>Egyptian actor Omar Sharif and British star Peter O’Toole were both said to have bedded the beauty. Ashley also claimed to have had a brief romance with INXS frontman Michael Hutchence in the early 1980s. </p>
<p>The model also said Elvis Presley was captivated by her when they met in Paris prior to her gender reassignment surgery. </p>
<p>In 2012, Ashley was awarded an OBE (the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) for her work raising awareness about transgender causes. </p>
<h1> Slender model claims she’s forced to wear ‘fat suit’ for plus-sized ads</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 30, 2021 10:11am <div> Updated <div> December 30, 2021 10:11am </div> </div> </div>
<p>A European model has sparked outrage after revealing she wears a “fat suit” so that she can appear in plus-sized ads.</p>
<p>The woman — identified by The Daily Dot as Karoline Bjørnelykke — took to TikTok late last month saying she was going to expose “a secret from the modeling industry.”</p>
<p>At the beginning of the clip — which has been viewed more than 300,000 times — Bjørnelykke shares a mirror selfie showing off her slender physique.</p>
<p>However, she goes on to state that she is often hired to appear in ads for sizes XL through 5XL.</p>
<p>The model then reveals the padding, before stuffing it under her shirt to show how she transforms into a “plus-size model.”</p>
<p>Bjørnelykke explains that casting agents actually prefer to hire thinner women as opposed to actual plus-size models because “they still want the neck and the face to look really slim and sharp.”</p>
<p>“This doesn’t just create unrealistic standards, but impossible ones!” the model declared. </p>
<p>Bjørnelykke ended her clip by imploring agents to actually hire larger women for their commercials. </p>
<p>“There are so many beautiful plus-size women out there,” she stated. </p>
<p>She added that she will no longer take jobs that require her to wear the fat suit, as she hopes that the jobs will go to those who are actually larger in size. </p>
<p>Viewers were left outraged by Bjørnelykke’s revelation, which she claims is standard practice across the industry. </p>
<p>“Oh, the jawlines make sense now,” one person remarked. </p>
<p>“I just realized how many times I have fallen for this by being ashamed of my double chin,” another wrote. </p>
<p>“This is why I’m so self-conscious about my face shape,” a third person chimed in. </p>
<p>Back in 2019, The Post spoke with several plus-size models who exposed problems with the industry. </p>
<p>“They want you to have small arms, a beautiful jawline, a slim waist, but you can have all the boobs, a-s and thighs you want,” one 22-year-old model stated. </p>
<p>Others complained that they were encouraged to be “curvy,” but were simultaneously forbidden from having cellulite.</p>

<h1> These are the trashiest fashion trends from whale tails to bra tops</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 7, 2022 1:00pm <div> Updated <div> January 7, 2022 12:45pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>These celebrities think they’re rocking haute couture — but they’re actually hot messes. </p>
<p>Read on for today’s tawdriest trends — and the stars who just can’t stop wearing them.</p>
<a>viral on social media</a> thanks to style influencers including Normani, 25, Dua Lipa, 26, and Irina Shayk, 36 — does much in the way of cinching one’s waist, but does little in bringing any class to one’s look.
<h1> Inside the $11.5M home Jessica Simpson risked to save struggling brand</h1>
<div> January 7, 2022 6:43pm <div> Updated <div> January 7, 2022 7:18pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Jessica Simpson wanted her billion-dollar fashion brand back, and she once considered “borrowing against her homes,” to do it.</p>
<p>In a lengthy interview with Bloomberg Businessweek, the business mogul revealed the desperate measures she took to salvage her fashion empire. </p>
<p>“Even if I have to go live in a little, tiny place in Ireland, I will,” Simpson, 41, explained.</p>
<p>The decision to take back her company came about during an already dramatic period in her life. </p>
<p>In 2019, while 34 weeks pregnant with her third child, Simpson was hospitalized with severe bronchitis as her daughter’s status began to deteriorate. </p>
<p>“Her oxygen levels were dropping. I couldn’t breathe,” said Simpson, who was hooked up an oxygen machine. Though her and her daughter’s health stabilized, it was time to turn her attention to the health of her empire. </p>
<p>The company she started in 2005, the Jessica Simpson Collection, had shot to $1 billion in sales in 2014, but in the years since, was slipping into financial ruin.</p>
<p>But after a few years it was clear that her affordable lifestyle brand, which produces shoes, clothing, fragrances and other items for women, would not expand under Sequential as they had promised the young star.</p>
<p>The company was in financial trouble and Simpson knew the business she had created from the ground up was in jeopardy.</p>
<p>“My name was on it,” Simpson said. “I don’t ever move away from my name.”</p>
<p>“We’re ready to go into the trenches,” Simpson continued. “Pay it all back and earn it ourselves.”</p>
<p>Sequential purchased the Jessica Simpson Collection for $353 million at the time — their largest acquisition by far. But those who had a stake on the brand quickly realized they had gotten ahead of themselves.</p>
<p>By August 2021, Sequential Brands Group Inc. would file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.</p>
<p>And a month later, Simpson reportedly offered to buy the brand out of bankruptcy for $65 million.</p>
<p>In October, before she knew it, Simpson was CEO of the Jessica Simpson Collection after her determination to reclaim the brand.</p>
<p>“It means the absolute world to me to be able to take over complete ownership of my brand,” Simpson told <a>Footwear News</a> in a separate interview.</p>
<p>“After 16 years in business, I feel ready to meet this next exciting phase with open arms. I know the sky’s the limit when my mom, our incredible team and I lock into our customers completely.”</p>
<h1> Skin-care influencer shares sticky secret for staying wrinkle-free</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 7, 2022 7:07pm <div> Updated <div> January 7, 2022 7:33pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>This crafting supply can make skin look decades younger, a skinfluencer claims.</p>
<p>A TikTok creator credits her wrinkle-free skin to a surprising hack, which she says has trained her to not make the facial expressions which lead to fine lines. </p>
<p>“Dr. Brandt used to make us wear tape on our forehead. Like, pieces of tape, because it teaches you how often you’re flexing and using that muscle ’cause you’d hear the tape crinkle,” Malibu explained. </p>
<p>She insisted that she can “still be animated” and express herself while also successfully preventing the formation of “lines or creases on my upper forehead.” </p>
<p>While many in the clip’s comments wrote that they would never trade certain facial expressions so as to hopefully age less visibly, Malibu seems to feel the exchange was more than worth it. </p>

<h1> We reviewed the 12 best women’s joggers in 2022: Old Navy, lululemon, more</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 10, 2022 10:41am Updated </div>
<p>Joggers, the fashionable sibling of the comfy pants, are a wardrobe staple for both active and sedentary lifestyles — or a mix of the two as the lines between home gym, home office and home sofa are blurred.</p>
<p>Like leggings, the cuffed sweatpants come in all shapes and sizes — and are designed for all shapes and sizes of women, too. </p>
<p>From a basic black pair for running errands to pajama-style joggers and even those made of leather or velour, there is surely something for everybody that looks and feels great.</p>
<p>In search of the best joggers in every category I could think of, I scoured the internet and solicited advice from trendier friends than I, coming up with the ultimate list from 10 brands and across 12 categories.</p>
<h2>1. Best joggers for traveling </h2>
<h3><a>lululemon On the Fly Jogger Woven</a>, $118</h3>
<p>While we aren’t able to travel as much right now, these joggers are great for even the shortest of distances (even from the fridge to the couch, if that’s your destination).</p>
<p>Pockets are travel essentials and these pants have two pockets on either side. However, the best travel perk is the hidden mesh pocket, the perfect size for a credit card or ID, inside the right pocket.</p>
<p>For travelers on long-haul trips, the waistband and ankle cuffs are comfortable, even when sitting for long periods of time, but fit snugly like leggings.</p>
<p>Note: At time of update, the On The Fly Woven joggers were out of stock. Love the look? Try the <a>Dance Studio High-Rise Jogger</a> for a similar style and feel! </p>
<li>Almost impossible to wrinkle, perfect for long-haul travel, packing in a suitcase or everyday wear.</li>
<li>Comfortable waistband for sitting for long periods of time.</li>
<li>Lightweight material to prevent overheating.</li>
<li>Secret mesh pocket for a credit card or ID.</li>
<li>Range in size from 0 to 14.</li>
<li>Cons:<ul><li>Very popular, so sizes and colors may be hard to find during peak seasons like holidays.</li></ul></li>
<h2>2. Best joggers for all body types</h2>
<h3><a>Girlfriend Collective ReSet Jogger</a>, $68</h3>
<p>Fashion should be made for all, big or small, tall or short and really everywhere in between. </p>
<li>Pros:<ul><li>The size range is amazing, from an XXS to a 6XL. </li><li>Plenty of stretch in the waistband and the ankle cuffs.</li><li>Pockets! </li><li>Made of recycled materials and super soft. </li></ul></li>
<li>Cons:<ul><li>A bit on the thin side, but perfect for spring and summer. </li></ul></li>
<h2>3. Best jogger-legging hybrid</h2>
<h3><a>Vuori Daily Joggers</a>, $84</h3>
<p>If you can’t decide between leggings and joggers, why not have both at the same time? </p>
<p>This pair from Vuori came recommended to me by coworkers and friends as the softest pants on the planet. They’re super soft and lightweight like leggings but have a waistband and ankle cuffs like joggers.</p>
<p>The fabric is moisture-wicking, great for high-intensity workouts, hot yoga or sitting super close to the fire when relaxing at home. </p>
<p>The Daily Joggers come in two colors, the green oregano color and a hazel purple, and sizes range from XS to XL. Size up for a looser jogger look or size down for a legging fit.</p>
<li>The softest fabric that’s also moisture-wicking.</li>
<li>Best of both worlds: Waistband and ankles of joggers, fabric and feel of leggings.</li>
<li>High-rise waistband doesn’t fall down or move when moving and is slimming.</li>
<li>Comes in two colors and sizes range from XS to XL. </li>
<li>Cons:<ul><li>No pockets.</li><li>Would be nice to see bigger sizes available for more inclusivity.</li></ul></li>
<h2>4. Best jogger-sweatpants hybrid</h2>
<h3><a>Alo Yoga Cargo Joggers</a>, $114</h3>
<p>Never decide again between a pair of baggy sweatpants and their stylish jogging relative again, or compromise when it comes to pockets a lá cargo pants. </p>
<p>This pair from Alo Yoga has takes the mid-rise waistband with a traditional pull drawstring of sweatpants and comnbines it with the trademark thicker cuff of a jogger, all wrapped up in an unbelievably soft tri-blend fleece.</p>
<li>Pros:<ul><li>An amazing blend of jogger and sweatpants, with cargo pockets.</li><li>Super soft interior and substantial and sturdy outer fabric, built to last.</li><li>Fashionable knee panels and pocket detailing.</li></ul></li>
<li>Cons:<ul><li>Fake back pockets. </li><li>Only go up to a size large, or 12 to 14 and come in just black </li></ul></li>
<h2>5. Best joggers to wear as pants </h2>
<h3><a>Spanx Leather-Like Joggers</a>, $148</h3>
<p>Like all things from Spanx, if you want a confidence-boost and a stylish pair of pants all rolled into one, look no further than these joggers. </p>
<p>I went with my normal size, and while they fit, I could have easily sized up for a baggier jogger look. For this joggers-as-pants category, my normal size was perfect, especially paired with my favorite sweater and a pair of winter booties.</p>
<p>I was almost shocked to see just how deep the pockets were and didn’t even pucker when faced with an iPhone XR in one and headphones in another.</p>
<li>Can be worn to the office, from day-to-night and everywhere in between.</li>
<li>Size inclusive, ranging from XS to 3XL.</li>
<li>Deep pockets to fit a large phone, keys and more without looking too bulky. </li>
<li>Slimming waistband and feel like shapewear without looking like it.</li>
<li>Cons:<ul><li>Size up if you want a baggier feel.</li></ul></li>
<h2>6. Best jogger and sweatshirt workout set </h2>
<h3><a>Gymshark Venture Joggers</a> and <a>Venture Hoodie</a>, $50 each</h3>
<p>The two items both come in sizes ranging from XS to XL, so feel free to mix and match depending on your body type. </p>
<p>Note: At time of update, the Venture collection was out of stock. Love the look? Try the matching <a>Studio Joggers</a> and the <a>Studio Hoodie</a> for a similar style and feel!</p>
<li>The matching set is both fashionable and functional for a workout or just to run errands.</li>
<li>The substantial cotton blend and water-resistant panels add to the functionality and style.</li>
<li>Both products range from an XS to an XL.</li>
<li>Zipper pockets on both the joggers and the sweatshirt keep items from falling out.</li>
<ul><li>The set is sold separately, so make sure to figure out your sizing in both before placing your order.</li><li>Sizing ran a bit on the larger and taller side, so size down if you want a more snug fit or have a shorter torso and legs. </li></ul>
<h2>7. Best joggers to wear to sleep</h2>
<h3><a>Yummie Baby French Terry Slim Leg Jogger</a>, $44</h3>
<p>My biggest mistake was reviewing these in the morning, because all I wanted to do after putting them on was crawl right back into bed. </p>
<a>matching T-shirt</a> are a bit on the see-through side, so be sure to wear flesh-toned undergarments when venturing out of the house.
<p>The waistband isn’t too tight and the ankles are comfortably snug without cutting off circulation. They offer sizes up to a 2XL, which is great for inclusivity as well as those that want a loose pair of PJ’s to curl up in.</p>
<li>Light enough for sleeping comfortably in all seasons, but heavy enough to feel cozy.</li>
<li>Waistband and ankles stay up, but loose for comfort. </li>
<li>Size inclusive, ranging from XS to 2XL in most colors.</li>
<li>Affordable price and has a matching shirt to complete the look.</li>
<li>No pockets, but don’t really need them while in dreamland.</li>
<li>The white pair is a bit see-through, so wear nude undergarments if you venture outside the bedroom.</li>
<li>Terry fabric tends to pill on the inner thigh, so wash on delicate and inside-out.</li>
<h2>8. Best tie-dye joggers</h2>
<h3><a>Lulu’s Cozy Livin’ Tie-Dye Joggers</a>, $48</h3>
<p><a>Tie-dye is having a moment</a> and even though we’ve come a long way from the ’70s, this pattern is timeless and deserves its own category. </p>
<p>Lulu’s offers a bunch of tie-dye joggers, ranging in colors and fabrics. The popular Cozy Livin’ style comes in a gorgeous light blue color with an option for a matching tee, <a>so check that out for the full ‘fit</a>.</p>
<p>Both the waistband and the ankle cuffs are tight enough to stay where you put them, but loose enough to wear as loungewear or PJ’s that won’t leave marks or indents. Since they are thin, flesh-toned undergarments are the best bet.</p>
<p>Note: At time of update the Cozy Livin’ Tie Dye Joggers were out of stock. Love the look? Try the <a>Mellow Moment Tan Tie-Dye High-Waisted Lounge Joggers</a> for a similar style and feel! </p>
<li>Super on-trend and come in five different colors.</li>
<li>Offers a matching top for the full look.</li>
<li>Super soft and light enough to wear around the house and for sleeping. </li>
<li>Waistband and ankle cuffs stay put but not too tight or uncomfortable.</li>
<li>Cons:<ul><li>Pretty thin.</li><li>No pockets.</li><li>Colors appear a bit different than on the website, but still vibrant and pretty. </li></ul></li>
<h2>9. Best cargo pant joggers</h2>
<h3><a>Old Navy High-Waisted StretchTech Mesh-Lined Jogger Cargo Pants</a>, $39.99</h3>
<p>Pocket lovers, take note. </p>
<p>The zippered cuffs at the ankle allow for customization and some more air flow but don’t make the cuffs any tighter.</p>
<li>Four pockets deep enough for large items like phones, wallets, keys and more.</li>
<li>Adjustable interior drawstring and zipper ankles for customization.</li>
<li>Great for high-intensity workouts both indoors and outdoors with mesh lining, quick-dry fabric and UV protection.</li>
<li>Size inclusivity, including in height with regular, petite and tall sizes as well as XS through XXL.</li>
<li>Comes in three colors: forest green, black and cream.</li>
<li>Cons:<ul><li>Ankle cuffs and waistband are a touch loose and only the waist can be made tighter.</li></ul></li>
<h2>10. Best joggers from to transition from loungewear to streetwear</h2>
<h3><a>Calvin Klein Performance Brush Logo High Waist Drawstring Joggers</a>, $38</h3>
<p>Jogging #InMyCalvins. Absolutely. </p>
<a>a light gray as well</a>, and both pairs feature the Calvin Klein logo in a black or white brushstroke up the leg.
<p>For sizing, I found my normal size to be a great happy medium between a form-fitting pant and looser joggers, but for those who want a true jogger fit, consider sizing up. The waistband fits above the hips for a high waist fit.</p>
<li>Streetwear style with a comfortable fit and fabric.</li>
<li>Comes in white and gray with either a black or white logo.</li>
<li>Medium-to-high waist and a 7/8th length great for pairing with sneakers or house slippers.</li>
<li>Fit true-to-size; size up if you want a baggier look.</li>
<li>Cons:<ul><li>No pockets.</li><li>Be wary of wearing brightly colored underwear or shorts under the white pair, as they may show through.</li></ul></li>
<h2>11. Best joggers for winter</h2>
<h3><a>lululemon Scuba Jogger</a>, $118</h3>
<p>From the outside, these lululemon joggers appear to be a sturdy pair of black cotton joggers. The inside, however, is made of a cotton fleece fabric, which translates to soft and warm but also lightweight should you choose to work out in them. </p>
<p>As for extras, when putting my phone in the right-hand pocket, I found a hidden gem: A mini mesh pocket inside the pocket, great storage to stash a credit card or keys when running errands, out running or in the yoga studio.</p>
<li>Insanely soft cotton fleece on the inside, but don’t feel heavy.</li>
<li>Keep legs warm in the winter.</li>
<li>Ankle and waistband stay put.</li>
<li>Hidden mesh pocket for keys, credit card or earbuds. </li>
<li>Comes in four colors: black, gray, light pink and gray-green.</li>
<li>Cons: <ul><li>Size up one size if you want a baggier look, size down one size if you like a form-fitting pant. </li></ul></li>
<h2>12. Best velour joggers</h2>
<h3><a>Athleta Double Cozy Karma Recover Joggers</a>, $98</h3>
<p>When looking up the definition of cozy, these joggers should be the only definition listed. </p>
<p>From Athleta, these joggers are more than worthy of the “double cozy” name, as both the outside and the inside has the ultra-soft velour feel. </p>
<p>The pants currently come in two colors, black and an off-white, and range in size from an XXS to an XL. <a>The white pair also come in sizes ranging from 1XL to 3XL</a>. </p>
<li>Both the inside and the outside feature the ultra-soft velvety fabric.</li>
<li>The waistband is comfortable for all-day wear but also works as shapewear.</li>
<li>Comes with two deep pockets, an adjustable waistband and elastic ankle cuffs.</li>
<li>Ranges in size from XXS to XL and the white pair come in 1XL to 3XL.</li>
<li>Cons:<ul><li>The black pair does not currently come in larger sizes, but may change as stock is updated.</li></ul></li>

<h1> Evangelical Lutheran Church elects first transgender bishop</h1>
<div> May 11, 2021 2:33pm <div> Updated <div> May 11, 2021 2:58pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has elected a transgender bishop — the first of the major Christian faiths in the US to do so.</p>
<p>The Rev. Megan Rohrer, pastor of Grace Lutheran Church in San Francisco, who has appeared on TV’s “Queer Eye,” was elected to serve as bishop of the Sierra Pacific synod, the ECLA announced.</p>
<p>“I am humbled and honored, and aware that this call is bigger than me,” Rohrer, 41, said after the ballots were counted Saturday, later <a>telling Religion News Service (RNS)</a> it was “an honor to be called to serve.”</p>
<p>“During this time when some imagine trans people at their worst, Lutherans have once again declared that transgender people are beautiful children of God,” Rohrer said.</p>
<p>“Thank you to everyone who has been praying for me and my family as I accept this call.”</p>
<p>Rohrer, whose appointment is for six years, had already made ECLA history twice before, as the first transgender person to be ordained in 2006 and then the first to serve as a pastor when called to Grace Lutheran in 2014.</p>
<p>The new bishop, who uses the pronouns they and them, on Tuesday addressed Christians who may be confused by the historic appointment.</p>
<p>“God’s call extends to more people than you’d expect, in more places than you’d expect and more often than you’d expect,” <a>Rohrer tweeted</a>, with the hashtag #iamLutheran.</p>
<p>Raised in South Dakota, Rohrer has recounted being expelled from a church youth group in Sioux Falls after coming out as a lesbian.</p>
<a>told KALW</a> in 2014. “And I would just sing harmony. I didn’t know what to do.”
<p>Now a community chaplain coordinator for the San Francisco Police Department, Rohrer is known for advocating for LGBTQ rights in street activism.</p>
<p>“We need to all be as loud and as angry as the people who want to declare that there are types of people that God can’t love,” they told Cosmopolitan in 2017.</p>
<p>Rohrer’s profile was raised last year with an appearance in “Queer Eye,” lending support to an openly gay pastor in Philadelphia. </p>
<p>The Sierra Pacific Synod encompasses 180 congregations in Northern California and northern Nevada, with more than 36,000 individual members and about 13,000 worshippers attending on Sundays. </p>

<p>Banks repeatedly argued the expansion of the program — typically reserved for students out sick — did not amount to a “remote” learning option as there are still no formalized plans to provide live instruction. </p>
<p>However, he did confirm the coursework offering, which will only be available if a student’s teacher and their supervisor sign off, describing the effort as an “on ramp” for bringing families back to the classroom. </p>
<p>He then further cautioned those comments. </p>
<p>“To turn around and do a remote learning option is not an easy thing to do,” Banks said. “It requires the reprogramming of school schedules.”</p>
<p>Pressure has mounted on city officials to expand options for families who are keeping their children at home as daily attendance rates remain at or below 75 percent. </p>

<h1> Subway lines suspended over COVID staffing shortages set to resume</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 4:20pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:20pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Transit officials will resume service on five subway lines they suspended in December to cope with COVID staff shortages, Acting MTA Chairman Janno Lieber said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The B, Z, Rockaway Shuttle routes will come back online Wednesday along with express service on the 6 and 7 lines, Lieber told reporters during an unrelated announcement in the Bronx. </p>
<p>The W line will remain suspended for the time being, he said.</p>
<p>“With the Omicron, we had a very sudden and significant impact,” he told reporters. “It’s no secret we had to suspend a couple of service on a couple of lines that happened to provide redundant routings.”</p>
<a>pandemic hiring freeze</a> that officials do not expect to have recovered from until well into 2022.
<p>Unlike city employees, employees of the state-run MTA <a>are not required</a> to be vaccinated. </p>
<h1> Gov. Hochul’s budget projects $1.25 billion in revenue from pot sales over 6 years</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 4:52pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:53pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>New York is set to reach new highs starting in 2023 — thanks to legalized pot.</p>
<p>The state plans to reap more than $1.25 billion in new revenue from legal marijuana sales during the next six years, according to the fiscal 2023 spending plan unveiled Tuesday by Gov. Kathy Hochul.</p>
<p>Those fees are expected to start rolling in later this year and storefront sales of recreational marijuana are likely to begin next year, state Budget Director Robert Mujica said during an afternoon briefing in Albany.</p>
<p>Once the business begins booming, projections show the state will collect rapidly increasing revenues that reach $363 million in fiscal 2028.</p>
<a>made the budding industry a high priority</a> when she succeeded former Gov. Andrew Cuomo following his
<a>resignation over a sexual harassment scandal </a>last year.
<p>Cannabis products will be taxed by the state on the amount of THC — the chemical compound that gets people stoned — they contain, according to the budget briefing book, which doesn’t specify that rate.</p>
<p>The state will also collect a 9 percent excise tax and local governments will collect a 4 percent excise tax, in addition to state and local sales taxes.</p>
<p>Forty percent of the state’s revenues will go to education, with another 40 percent earmarked for a new “Community Grants Reinvestment Fund” and the remaining 20 percent to drug treatment programs.</p>
<h1> Hochul boosts funding for charters, gives Adams 4 years to run NYC schools</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 7:40pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 7:40pm </div> </div> </div>
<a>Eric Adams’</a> authority to control the New York City public education system for the duration of his first term.
<p>The boost will increase aid to charter schools to $17,633 per student, up from $16,844, according to the NYC Charter School Center. Two years ago, aid to charter schools was frozen.</p>
<p>The increase is below the overall increase of 7.1 percent for all K-12 schools, however.</p>
<p>Hochul’s recommended four-year extension mayoral control of the schools is a gift to Adams. The law giving him such control is set to expire in June.</p>
<a>received only</a> a one or two-year extension from Albany to oversee the city school system, when antagonist Andrew Cuomo was governor and Republicans controlled one house of the legislature — the state Senate.
<p>It wasn’t until 2019, when more friendly Democrats ruled the Senate, that lawmakers gave him<a> a three-year extension</a> of school control for the remainder of his second term.</p>
<a>lift the cap</a> that has blocked charter school expansion in the city.
<p>There are about 180,000 students attending 331 charter schools in New York State. The overwhelming majority of students — 145,000 — attend 272 charter schools serving in New York City.</p>
<p>Charter schools receive tuition payments funded by the state and local school districts, based on the average growth in the district’s spending from the previous years combined.</p>
<p>“So, as district school spending goes up, so does charter school, per pupil, spending,” Mujica said.</p>
<p>“So there was a lag to last year’s spending. We saw the lag. We’ll be hearing that,” he said, referring to criticism from charter school advocates..</p>
<p>Mujica said there was no change in the charter school cap for New York City but added,“we are in discussion about that, with the mayor.”</p>
<p>In total, Hochul’s executive spending provides $31.3 billion in state aid for fiscal year 2023, a year-to-year increase of $2.1 billion or 7.1 percent, compared to the current budget, which expires on March 31.</p>

<p>Rangers winger, and former Devil, Kevin Rooney takes a shot at some QA with Post columnist Steve Serby.</p>
<p>Q: How have the doubters impacted you?</p>
<p>Q: Describe coach Gerard Gallant.</p>
<p>Q: Can you describe the way he delivers his messages?</p>
<p>Q: Describe Chris Kreider.</p>
<p>A: Power. He’s like the strongest guy on the team. I’d probably just say strength and speed.</p>
<p>Q: Give me an example of his leadership.</p>
<p>A: Makes everything look easy. He’s by far the best goalie in the league right now. He makes you look like you can’t shoot the puck in practice (laugh), that’s for sure.</p>
<p>A: Just quiet confidence. Such a good leader, just leads by example. He also plays the center ice position, so he’s one of those guys that I’ve certainly looked up to and tried to learn a lot from since I’ve been in New York.</p>
<p>A: Smart. Seems to make the right play, and obviously sees the game a little quicker than everybody else.</p>
<a>not many people want to fight him</a> though (laugh).
<p>Q: What adjectives would you use to describe your game?</p>
<p>A: I’d probably say <a>tenacious, competitive</a> … maybe say smart.</p>
