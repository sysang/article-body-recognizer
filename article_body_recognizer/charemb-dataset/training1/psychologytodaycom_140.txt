<h1> Is There an Angry Personality? </h1>
<h2> How we can learn compassionate assertiveness. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Personality? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Neuroticism</a> is a personality trait but not
<a>anger</a>. Only when aspects of neuroticism – frustration, envy,
<a>loneliness</a> – are blamed on self or others, do they produce anger. Blame is a learned coping mechanism, not a personality trait.
<p>While there’s no “angry personality,” the following attitudes and habits are correlates of chronic anger and resentment.</p>
<p>My rights and privileges are superior to those of other people. In relationships, my right to get what I want supersedes your right not to give me what I want.</p>
<p>Focus on things out of personal control</p>
<p>In traffic, they focus on the way the highway should have been designed, how the lights should have been synchronized, and how other people drive. In relationships, they focus on manipulating their partners' behavior and attitudes.</p>
<p>External regulation of emotions</p>
<p>They try to regulate their emotions by controlling their environment.</p>
<p>Emotions are not in <a>the environment</a>. Emotions are in us, and that’s where they must be regulated.</p>
<p>External <a>locus of control</a></p>
<p>They believe that their well-being, indeed their fate, is controlled by powerful forces outside the self, and damn it, they’re not going to take it.</p>
<p>Refusal to see other perspectives</p>
<p>They perceive different perspectives as ego-threats.</p>
<p>Low tolerance of discomfort</p>
<p>Discomfort is typically due to low physical resources – tired, hungry, sleep-deprived. They confuse discomfort with unfair <a>punishment</a>. As with many toddlers, discomfort quickly turns to anger.</p>
<p>Low tolerance of ambiguity</p>
<p>Certainty is an emotional, not an intellectual state. To feel certain, we must limit the amount of information we process. Ambiguity necessitates processing more information, which they see as a potential ego-threat.</p>
<p>They’re more concerned with attributing fault for problems than solving them. This makes them powerless to improve their experience.</p>
<p>Those they blame live rent-free in their heads and dominate their thoughts and feelings.</p>
<p>None of the above is a personality trait. All the above are learned habits and attitudes. Unlike personality traits, habits and attitudes are amenable to change, with practice.</p>
<p>We can learn to improve, rather than blame. In relationships, we can learn binocular vision – the ability to see both perspectives at once – instead of devaluing other perspectives.</p>
<p>In family relationships, we can learn compassionate <a>assertiveness</a> – standing up for our rights and preferences, while respecting the rights, preferences, and vulnerability of loved ones.</p>

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Big 5 Personality Traits</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>The differences between people’s personalities can be broken down in terms of five major traits—often called the “Big Five.” Each one reflects a key part of how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. The Big Five traits are:</p>
<li>Openness to experience (includes aspects such as intellectual curiosity and creative <a>imagination</a>)</li>
<li><a>Conscientiousness</a> (organization, productiveness, responsibility)</li>
<li><a>Extroversion</a> (sociability, <a>assertiveness</a>; its opposite is <a>Introversion</a>)</li>
<li><a>Agreeableness</a> (compassion, respectfulness, trust in others)</li>
<li><a>Neuroticism</a> (tendencies toward <a>anxiety</a> and <a>depression</a>)</li>
<a>conscientious</a> and less agreeable than most people, for instance, while scoring about average on the other traits. These traits remain fairly stable during adulthood.
<p>People can also differ on the more specific facets that make up each of the Big Five traits. A relatively <a>extroverted</a> person might be highly sociable but not especially <a>assertive</a>.</p>
<h2> How the Big Five Personality Traits Are Measured </h2>
<a>openness to experience</a> (also called open-mindedness or just openness),
<a>extroversion</a> (the reverse of which is
<a>agreeableness</a>, and neuroticism (sometimes
<a>negative emotionality</a> or emotional stability).
<p>One test, the latest version of the Big Five Inventory, asks how much a person agrees or disagrees that he or she is someone who exemplifies various specific statements, such as:</p>
<li>“Is curious about many different things” (for openness, or open-mindedness)</li>
<li>“Is systematic, likes to keep things in order” (for conscientiousness)</li>
<li>“Is outgoing, sociable” (for extroversion)</li>
<li>“Is compassionate, has a soft heart” (for agreeableness)</li>
<li>“Is moody, has up and down mood swings” (for neuroticism, or negative emotionality)</li>
<p>Based on a person’s ratings for dozens of these statements (or fewer, for other tests), an average score can be calculated for each of the five traits.</p>
<div> <h3> What does your score on the Big Five tell you? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How were the Big Five traits determined? </h3> </div>
<a>identify clusters of related characteristics</a>. This led to a small number of overarching trait dimensions that personality psychologists have scientifically tested in large population samples.
<div> <h3> Who developed the Big Five personality traits? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Do Big Five tests measure more specific traits? </h3> </div>
<a>smaller sub-components or “facets,”</a> which are correlated with each other but can be independently measured. In the Big Five Inventory, for instance, “sociability” and “
<a>assertiveness</a>” are distinct facets of extroversion, while “organization” and “responsibility” are facets of conscientiousness.

<h2> Why the Big Five Personality Traits Are Important </h2>
<div> <h3> What can Big Five scores tell us about other outcomes? </h3> </div>
<a>Quite a lot</a>, at least in Western samples. There is reliable evidence, for example, that extroversion is associated with subjective well-being, neuroticism with lower work commitment, and agreeableness with religiousness. Certain traits have been
<a>linked to mortality risk.</a> However, these are overall patterns and don’t mean that a trait necessarily causes any of these outcomes.
<div> <h3> Can Big Five personality traits change? </h3> </div>
<a>reason to believe</a> that deliberate
<a>personality change</a> is possible.
<h2> The Big Five and Other Personality Tests </h2>
<div> <h3> How do Big Five tests compare to the Myers-Briggs? </h3> </div>
<a>a number of reasons</a>, many personality psychologists consider Big Five tests superior to the
<div> <h3> Do the Big Five capture personality types? </h3> </div>
<a>along a continuum</a> rather than fitting neatly into categories. While some identify wholeheartedly as a total extrovert or introvert, for example, there are many shades in between, and most of us would score somewhere in the middle.
<div> <h3> Do Big Five tests have known limitations? </h3> </div>
<a>HEXACO</a>). There is also evidence that current tests provide less reliable results outside of Western, industrialized countries.

<h2> Why some people get angry more often than others </h2>
<p>Individual characteristics</p>
<a>competition</a> with the others on the road. Likewise, a
<a>narcissistic</a> person may think of himself or herself as the most important person on the road and be irritated by the other driver for that reason.
<a>anxious</a>, or already angry, they are more likely to respond with anger. Some of this has to do with simple physiological arousal. A nervous person already has an elevated heart rate so doesn't have as far to go to become angry.

<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: wan mohd, Flickr/Creative Commons</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Most toddlers get aggressive sometimes. Tantrums and aggressive behaviours—hitting, kicking, scratching, and biting—don’t mean you’re a bad parent, but they are a call to action.</p>
<h3>Why Little Kids Get Nasty</h3>
<p>Looked at from a child’s eye view, lashing out at someone is a reasonable reaction to the powerlessness of being a toddler. What else can they do?</p>
<h3>How to Respond to a Young Child Who Has Lost Control</h3>
<a>punishment</a> doesn’t help. In fact, you getting angry or impatient just makes things worse, exacerbating the frustration that led to your child’s bad behaviour, as well as demonstrating that anger and impatience are okay.
<p>Here are four simple steps for stopping toddler aggression, and teaching some important new skills in the process:</p>
<p>Help Your Child Use Their Words (and Not Their Hands, Nails, Feet, or Teeth)</p>
<a>self-control</a>. That is, be kind, matter-of-fact, and strong. No matter how you are feeling—angry, worried, embarrassed, whatever—this is a time to act like a good parent.
<h3>Prevention: 10 Pathways to Peaceful Co-Existence with a Toddler</h3>
<li>Snuggle your child frequently. Provide warm close cuddle time throughout the day. Show your love actively and often.</li>
<li>Maintain a schedule for playing, <a>sleeping</a>, and eating. A dependable schedule helps a child feel the world is safe and predictable. It also increases the likelihood their physical needs are being met.</li>
<li>Look for different kinds of stimulation. Sometimes toddler aggression reflects <a>boredom</a>. Make sure your child gets enough different kinds of stimulation—musical, physical, intellectual, social, and visual.</li>
<li>Ensure ample time for active play. A two-year-old needs three hours of active physical exercise every day. Ideally, a good portion of that is outdoors. Toddler aggression sometimes reflects a need for more physical activity.</li>
<li>Create a harmonious environment. Children mimic what’s happening around them. Are there other kids they spend time with who use hitting to get what they want? Are there worries or tensions at home or daycare they might be reacting to?</li>

<li>Use your words. Help your child learn to use words instead of hitting.</li>
<li>Walk away. Teach your child to walk away when they feel someone is treating them badly. You don’t want them walking away from you, but that’s almost always better than scratching you.</li>
<a>emotional self-regulation</a> yourself. Do what you need to do to keep yourself happy, healthy, and
<a>optimistic</a>. Find ways of managing your own emotions so you can be a model of calm, thoughtful, respectful behaviour. Remember that anger and shouting are also forms of aggression, tantamount to
<a>bullying</a> when a (large) parent shouts at a small child.

<h1> The Relationship Between Empathy and Anger Is Complicated </h1>
<h2> Many factors determine whether empathy can inhibit anger arousal. </h2>
<li>Empathy takes two forms, emotional empathy, and cognitive empathy. Cognitive empathy can exist in the absence of emotional empathy.</li>
<li>In a study, individuals with low cognitive empathy could not reduce the impact of the tendency toward anger and aggression. </li>
<li>Strategies to learn empathy include listening to others' words, tone, and body language and recognizing your biases.</li>
<p>We were discussing empathy in my all-male <a>anger management</a> group when Sebastian shared an experience that helped him to become more <a>empathic</a>.</p>
<p>Empathy helps us form bonds in our relationships and expand compassion for others and ourselves. It takes two forms: emotional empathy and cognitive empathy.</p>
<p>Empathy is partly <a>unconscious</a> and automatic, and we vary in the degree to which we have learned to embrace empathy. Some, like Sebastian, require transformational experiences before we can enhance our empathy.</p>
<p>In general, empathy is associated with inhibiting anger. However, its relationship with anger can be quite complicated.</p>
<h3>Empathic Enhancement as Part of Anger Management</h3>
<a>catastrophizing</a>, and all-or-nothing thinking–that influences our knee-jerk appraisal of a person.
<p>Learning to be curious and open allows us to generate alternative hypotheses about others’ thinking and emotions. However, while empathy may be essential to understand and be sensitive to others, some factors can undermine its benefits.</p>
<h3>When Empathy Can Increase Polarization</h3>
<a>bias</a> when evaluating contentious political events.
<h3>Cognitive and Emotional Empathy and Their Impact on Aggression</h3>
<h3>Anger Arousal Can Inhibit Empathy</h3>
<a>openness</a> to perspective-taking. Anger arousal inhibits good frontal lobe functions, which reduces cognitive flexibility. So it is not surprising that a group of studies found that anger reduces perspective-taking (Yip and Schweitzer, 2019).

<h3>Empathy Can Be Taught as a Skill to Help Lessen Anger</h3>
<p>It’s important to realize that our capacity for empathy can be taught as a powerful contribution to curbing anger. Following are several strategies that help promote it. </p>
<li>Be curious about others and ourselves. Visit and talk to new people. Read fiction as well as non-fiction about peoples’ struggles, individually or as a group.</li>
<li>Remember that others’ thoughts and feelings make sense to them due to their unique history. </li>
<li>Listen more–to their words, tone, and <a>body language</a>.</li>
<li>Make guesses as to why someone is behaving a certain way. Ask yourself, “What thoughts, feelings, or experiences might contribute to their behavior?”</li>
<li>Recognize how your biases, including fears and anxieties, influence your attitudes and perceptions to either expand or constrict empathy.</li>
<li>I find it helpful to think that we are all children doing our best to face life’s challenges as adults–each of us has developed a template for how to do this.</li>

<h2> What Is Codependency? </h2>
<p>According to this way of thinking, creating emotional distance from the troubled loved one is necessary and beneficial for the codependent partner: It is a way to expose them to the negative consequences of their behavior.</p>
<div> <h3> What causes codependency? </h3> </div>
<a>trauma</a> which led them to feel
<a>anxious</a> or insecure about relationships. However, it’s important to remember that anyone can fall into an unhealthy relationship pattern.
<div> <h3> What are some common signs of codependency? </h3> </div>
<a>In unhealthy codependent relationships,</a> the “giver” tends to be overly responsible, making excuses for the “taker” and taking over their obligations. Givers are self-critical and often
<a>perfectionistic</a>; fixing or rescuing others makes them feel needed. They focus so much on pleasing others that they neglect their own wants and needs. Givers generally have low self-esteem, find it hard to set boundaries and be
<a>assertive</a>, and struggle with asking for help when they need it. Takers are often struggling with serious issues, such as emotional immaturity, mental health problems, and addiction.
<div> <h3> What is the link between codependent relationships and addiction? </h3> </div>
<a>substance abuse</a>. Often, an integral part of recovering from addiction involves changing old codependent patterns; in some cases, it may be necessary
<a>to let go of the relationship altogether.</a>

<a>caretaking</a> patterns seen among partners of alcoholics. It has since been applied not only to addictions in general but well beyond, to other kinds of mental health and behavioral problems, including
<a>emotional abuse</a>. The term is also often used colloquially, to describe close relationships without carrying any strict psychological meaning.
<div> <h3> What is the difference between a healthy relationship and a codependent relationship? </h3> </div>

<h1> Adaptive and Maladpative Anger </h1>
<h2> Additional reflections on the anger-aggression distinction. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> How Can I Manage My Anger? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from anger</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a> <div>This post is in response to <article> Anger Is Its Own Beast, whose Bark Is as Bad as Its Bite By Steven Laurent </article> </div> </a>
<a>aggression</a> and offered some useful points of clarification. I agree with him that we are not very far apart overall and that we should avoid coming across as unnecessarily polarized. As such, let's start with some points of agreement.
<p>Given all this agreement, where is the difference? The basic difference is that I see angry feelings as being adaptive or maladaptive depending on context and how they are expressed.</p>
<p>The difference in opinion can be well-characterized by our reading of a famous quote from Aristotle, which Steven explicitly references in another post:</p>
<p>Anybody can become angry, that is easy; but to be angry with the right person, and to the right degree, and at the right time, and for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not within everybody's power; that is not easy.</p>
<p>—Nicomachean Ethics, 1109a25</p>
<p>My perspective stems in part from my concern that many of the "negative emotions" are viewed as "bad" in an unhelpful way (e.g., Feel <a>depressed</a> or <a>anxious</a>? You likely have a brain disease and need a pill).</p>
<h3>Socio-emotional processing</h3>
<a>goals</a> and emotional responses. I developed a map of this processing called the Influence Matrix. From this angle, the core, immediate experience of anger is important because it is tied to one's self-interest.
<a>Guilt</a> is important for the opposite reason—it signal's one to orient to another's interest.
<a>shame</a>) can be adaptive because they serve as important guides for one's self-conscious system to use in

<h2> How to Develop Self-Worth </h2>
<p>Cultivating <a>self-esteem</a> is the antidote to self-loathing. Learning how to silence one’s <a>inner critic</a> can limit the negative thoughts that come to mind and the comparisons made to others. </p>
<p>Practicing self-compassion and learning how to forgive others and oneself for past mistakes, whether serious or trivial, are key approaches as well.</p>
<p>Seeking support from a loved one or mental health professional is also an important part of the process.</p>
<div> <h3> How do I stop hating myself? </h3> </div>
<a>Self-forgiveness offers a path to release that burden</a>. This process can begin by forgiving others and progress to recognizing that you, too, are more than your behavior and that you can learn to love yourself.
<div> <h3> How do I build self-esteem? </h3> </div>
<a>begin by noticing critical self-talk</a> and challenge those thoughts. Explore the narrative you have about yourself and why it might be flawed. Avoiding comparing yourself to others and practicing
<a>forgiveness</a> can also help cultivate self-esteem.
