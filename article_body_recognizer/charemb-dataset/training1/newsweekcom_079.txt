<p>One direction I would like to see us head as a movement, and I do see this happening, is letting our conversations about sex, desire in the workplace be a little more nuanced and more reflective of the tremendous variation of human behavior.</p>
<p>Where #MeToo gets challenging is when we try to have these hard and fast rules that we apply to every single situation when we know human experience is much more complex.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>China</a></div>
<p>The following is a lightly edited transcript of remarks made by Kishore Mahbubani during a Newsweek podcast debate on China. You can listen to the podcast here:</p>
<p>China has been around for 5,000 years. The United States has been around for 250 years. And it's not surprising that a juvenile like the United States would have difficulty dealing with a wiser, older civilization.</p>
<p>So the troubles that the United States is having in dealing with China are perfectly understandable. What the United States doesn't understand is the longer arc of human history.</p>
<p>Of course it's perfectly natural for the United States, which has got used to being number one for 130 years since they replaced British in 1819, to feel a sense of entitlement, that they should always be number one in the world.</p>
<p>What the United States lacks in dealing with China is a comprehensive long-term strategy, which is what you need to deal with one of the oldest civilizations on planet earth. This insight actually was given to me by Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>China is not threatening the United States. China is not mounting a military invasion of the United States. China is not sending troops to the U.S. border or naval ships close to United States.</p>
<a>United Nations</a> system. It's a system I know well because I was an ambassador to the UN for over 10 years. That rules-based order created by the West is a gift to China and China wants to preserve it and protect it.
<p>So the paradox about the world today is that even though the global rules based order is a gift of the west, China embraces it.</p>

<p>I believe that China is a threat to the United States and to the international community. I also believe it's more than just a competitor, as president Biden has said, and it's more than just an adversary. It is actually our enemy.</p>
<p>We need to treat China the way it treats us.</p>
<a>Xi Jinping</a> and from his officials that they believe that the current international order is no longer appropriate, that it should be replaced.
<p>So they don't want to compete with the U.S. in the international system. They don't even want to adjust that system to be more to China's liking. In fact, they want to overthrow it all together.</p>
<p>We should listen to what Chinese officials say because that is the best indication of what they're thinking, in terms of what China is doing.</p>
<p>Yes, China does benefit from the American market, but they are trying to compete with us in ways which are destructive.</p>
