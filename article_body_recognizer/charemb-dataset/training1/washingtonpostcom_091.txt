<header><div/><div><div><a>Washington Wizards</a></div></div><div><h1>Wes Unseld Jr. has been around NBA stars all his life, and that’s why he’s ready to lead them</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ava Wallace</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 20, 2021 at 4:30 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Wes Unseld Jr. sits down in front of the mic in a white Washington Wizards T-shirt, takes off his mask and folds it carefully in thirds before placing it to his left, as he always does before addressing reporters.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Perspective: The Washington Wizards are set to begin another season of meh</p></div>
<div><div><p>Yet Unseld received no questions about his father that morning in front of the largest media contingent he had faced since his hiring in July.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Wizards’ hire of Wes Unseld Jr. brings a forward thinker to a team spinning its wheels</p></div>
<div><p>Warriors associate head coach Mike Brown saw Unseld’s attention to detail early on. As a Wizards assistant when Unseld was just starting out, Brown initially thought the youngster’s keen mind would make him a good scout.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Until then, preparing for the season is all-consuming.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A people person first</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unseld may be unproven as a head coach, but he is not an unknown commodity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He was touted upon his return to Washington as a defensive mastermind, the man credited with turning around the Nuggets’ defense who could do the same for the Wizards’ years-long streak of woeful defending.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was then that Hubbard learned Unseld’s superpower was neither offense nor defense. It was people.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Get ready, Wizards fans: Spencer Dinwiddie has a lot to say and a lot to prove</p></div>
<div><div><p>Navigating the kaleidoscope of personalities on one of the more colorful rosters in the NBA at the time came naturally to Unseld.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jamison, now the Wizards’ senior director of pro personnel, assumed Unseld was older because he pushed the forward like a parent or mentor might.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In those conversations, Jamison never felt talked down to.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Wes Unseld Jr. didn’t get the Wizards job because of who his dad is. He grinded for 24 years.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But making a living in basketball with the last name Unseld — especially when you don’t have your dad’s height or talent — requires a different level of excellence.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Putting himself out there</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The smack talk came mainly from Brown and Johnson, the elder contingent of the young staffers. Illegal screens were common. Unseld laughed off every slight and played through every foul.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Steady,” Brown said. “Extremely steady.”</p></div></div>
<i>Will I ever get the call for the top job?</i>
<div><div><p>Connelly and Nuggets Coach Michael Malone made multiple calls from Denver advocating on Unseld’s behalf. By his second interview, most of the Wizards’ decision-makers were sold.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I knew Wes, but even I was blown away,” Jamison said. “He was like a mad scientist with plays. You know you’re doing something right when the analytical guys are nodding their heads, impressed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unseld also passed the test with franchise cornerstone Bradley Beal and star point guard Russell Westbrook, who was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. All that was left was for Sheppard to make the call.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Wizards are taking a ‘slow and steady’ approach with Rui Hachimura</p></div>
<div><div><p>He escaped to the laundry room to take Sheppard’s call.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Absent a written guide, Unseld did the only thing that made sense to him and started making his own checklists nearly right away. The 25th head coach of the Washington Wizards got to work.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Washington Wizards</a></div></div><div><h1>Bradley Beal is comfortable not being a superhero all the time — on and off the court</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ava Wallace</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 6, 2021 at 3:48 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Montrezl Harrell has a running joke — at least, one assumes it’s a joke — about Bradley Beal raiding his closet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It stems from the pair’s habit of wearing accidentally coordinating outfits when they do their joint news conferences-slash-comedy hours after games, which has happened three times now.</p></div></div>
<a>season-opening win in Toronto</a>, they both donned puffer jackets. After a
<a>home win against Atlanta</a>, both sported plaids. Following a
<a>double-overtime win against Boston</a>, they were two halves of a black and white cookie, with Harrell wearing a white shirt and cap and Beal opting for a black hoodie and beanie.
<div><p>“I told him. He stay in my closet, I told you that, bruh,” Harrell said, turning to Beal during their post-Atlanta showcase. “I been hearing him upstairs. I hear him when I sleep, man, all upstairs in my closet!”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Cozy,” Beal shot back, with a smile and a wiggle of his shoulders.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even when the Wizards’ Abbott and Costello are apart, Beal is projecting a different image this season than his <a>famously exasperated mugs </a>of last year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Beyond his clothes (he looked technicolor in preppy pink and green after a <a>loss to Toronto</a>), the all-star guard seems lighter.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Wizards snap out of funk and dominate the Grizzlies</p></div>
<a>scoring is down across the league</a>.
<div><div><p>“Gives me a little peace knowing I ain’t the only one out here struggling,” Beal said this week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Washington’s franchise cornerstone has arrived at this sunny place after what he called perhaps the most personally difficult summer of his life.</p></div></div>
<a>who is unvaccinated</a>, had to miss the Tokyo
<a>contracting the coronavirus at Team USA’s training camp in Las Vegas</a>.
<a>new coach Wes Unseld Jr</a>. And Beal can focus on changing the conversation around the franchise he leads without worrying about the massive contract decision hanging over his head.
<div><div><p>Washington <a>has offered Beal a four-year extension </a>worth more than $180 million. If he waits to sign it and chooses to become a free agent in 2022, he could earn $50 million more.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He doesn’t think about it often.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Rui Hachimura’s return to Wizards has no timeline but will be ‘sooner rather than later’</p></div>
<div><p>“I'm not sitting here and saying we're going to hold up the Larry [O’Brien NBA Championship Trophy], but I want to be able to have those opportunities. I want to be able to see that that's reachable,” Beal said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>With Washington in a promising spot and his family situation more stable, Beal also feels stronger mentally than he did just before the season began.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He is open to receiving the <a>coronavirus</a> vaccine at some point and said it’s a conversation he and his partner, Kamiah, have daily, particularly now that their two young sons are attending preschool.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Beal said he is not broadly anti-vaccine — nor did he appreciate the <a>Twitter shout out </a>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) gave him and the handful of other unvaccinated NBA stars in late September.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Bob Ferry built the Washington Bullets into NBA champions, one laugh at a time</p></div>
<div><p>Still, his stance on the coronavirus vaccine being fodder for public debate, his family adversity, missing the Olympics — they were all heavy topics for Beal to deal with as he prepared for an important year in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The guard usually devotes his summers to adding an element to his game. This year, he learned about himself.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In the wake of the Washington Wizards’ win over the Milwaukee Bucks this month, Bradley Beal was asked about the ceiling for his team. What was it, exactly, that made him feel hopeful for the future?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Beal paused.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I can speak on Deni,” he said, referring to second-year forward Deni Avdija.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Wizards’ start enters historic territory after they storm back to stun the Pelicans</p></div>
<a>suffered a fibular fracture</a> in April that cut short his rookie season. The injury kept him from competitive basketball for months, the longest he had been off court since he was 14.
<div><div><p>Unseld’s initial surprise, which has morphed into trust, wasn’t foreign to Avdija. That type of reaction is what he relishes from opponents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For as stifling as he has been in one-on-one matchups, Avdija, by his own admission, doesn’t look the part.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harrell’s reputation precedes him. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, with a quiet focus, fits what most fans might think of as a traditional lockdown defender.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Wes Unseld Jr. has the Wizards doing the unthinkable — playing good defense</p></div>
<div><div><p>On screen or in person, his yearning — to be a good teammate, to be better at basketball — is palpable, like a freshman trying to do right by the senior class.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On offense, Avdija has had to be patient as his sharpness and timing come back after an injury recovery that took longer than expected. He’s averaging 5.8 points, slightly lower than last season’s 6.3.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But on defense, his approach boils down to two things: preparation and passion. Avdija said he feels he isn’t as athletic as other defenders, so he makes up for it by studying.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aside from preparation, Avdija simply tries hard. He tries like he knows his defense is keeping him in the rotation, like he wants to make good on the trust Unseld and Beal have in him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He tries, too, because of the<a> Israeli flags</a> that fans across the country unfurl at every NBA arena he’s in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With the support from his teammates, his coaches and his countrymen behind him, Avdija finds it natural to tap into the primary source of his defense.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The point guard leaned in to listen to a question from a reporter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The query: What exactly does Coach Wes Unseld Jr. mean when he says, repeatedly, that Dinwiddie and his backcourt mate, Bradley Beal, must get on the same page for the team to have success?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dinwiddie responded with a knowing smile and a long pause before saying, “Definitely, for our team to operate at its highest level, me and Brad will have to play well, for sure.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Giannis Antetokounmpo, James Harden enter protocols as NBA’s coronavirus problems worsen</p></div>
<a>the Wizards (15-13) as they creep toward a .500 record</a> after a cannon-blast of a start is their backcourt.
<div><div><p>In his past 12, he has averaged 9.3 points and 4.3 assists and shot 33.3 percent from the field and 27.8 percent from three.</p></div></div>
<a> can sign a four-year, $181 million contract extension</a> with the Wizards this season.
<div><div><p>From his first 12 games of the season to his past 13, Beal’s points per game decreased from 23.9 to 20.9. His three-point percentage fell from 28.9 to 23.6, and his attempted field goals dropped from 21.2 to 17.9.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unseld and Dinwiddie seem to have different perspectives on the issue. The coach’s evaluation is that the backcourt pair defer to each other too much.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Stephen Curry sets the NBA record for career three-pointers, surpassing Ray Allen</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve got to find a balance where they can both stay aggressive not only to score but to play-make,” Unseld said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I want him to get downhill; I think that’s where he’s at his best,” Unseld said before acknowledging that Dinwiddie has taken a higher percentage of his shots at the rim in his past 12 games.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s more the purpose part. He can get [to the hoop] probably whenever he wants. It’s just, is it the right time, are people in the right space, does he have the right angle?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>From Dinwiddie’s point of view, he’s making the best of an offense that he described as featuring Beal at the top with everyone else getting an equal slice of whatever’s left over.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Monday, after dishing a few quips when asked about his and Beal’s play, the point guard opened up.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ten teams to watch as NBA trade season opens</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s not just me and Spence making the adjustments. It’s everybody,” Beal said. “It’s the staff, too. It’s everybody.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Dinwiddie was firm that for him and Beal to be as dynamic of a backcourt as Unseld thinks they can be, there may need to be more of a top-down structure to Washington’s offense.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>With just seconds left to seal an improbable win against the Utah Jazz on Saturday, Raul Neto readied for a jump ball knowing the odds were not in his favor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“As soon as I saw him starting to throw the ball up, I just jumped as high as I could,” Neto said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It worked. Neto won the jump ball, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope recovered and put up a floating three-pointer to seal the game as the shot clock expired.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think everything happened how I expected it,” Neto said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To Neto, having to spend the extra few seconds to outsmart a bigger, more athletic adversary is nothing new. He had to have a plan to make it to the NBA, much less carve out a significant role with the Wizards.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Wizards guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope enters the NBA’s coronavirus protocols</p></div>
<div><div><p>The most common word his teammates use to describe him is “pest.” Maybe if flies had titanium wings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Eventually, Brazil’s dearth of practice gyms, coaches and trainers drove Neto to leave home at 18 to play in Spain’s pro league, where he had to learn a new language and how to cook for himself.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Neto’s talent for adaptation has helped him carve out space with two of the three organizations he has been with since he was drafted by Atlanta and traded to Utah on draft night in 2013. But so has his signature toughness.</p></div>

<p>“I’ve always appreciated guys that played hard and put their body [on the line] trying to get an offensive foul, or doing those little plays for the team,” Neto said. “I always appreciate it, and I try to do the same.”</p>

<div><p>Bradley Beal and our uncomfortable divide in vaccinations</p></div>

<a>coronavirus</a> protocols Wednesday, but for one more game they were tasked with coming up with a victory while significantly shorthanded.
<div><div><p>They came close. But for the second game in five days, the Wizards were undone by a game-sealing three in the dying moments and lost, <a>114-111</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just as DeMar DeRozan’s buzzer-beater did Saturday against Chicago, Kevin Porter Jr.'s long-range bomb stung because of how Washington (19-19) had battled back.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colombia's first NBA player, Jaime Echenique, brings some joy to a bleak covid month</p></div>
<div><p>“It’s unfortunate,” Kyle Kuzma said with a heavy sigh. “Kevin Porter made a hell of a shot. Great defense, just sometimes good players make big-time shots. Obviously throughout the game, it was tough.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Beal led with 27 points in 29 minutes and had five rebounds and five assists despite picking up fouls along the way. Caldwell-Pope added 26 points, and Kuzma had 24.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not having [Beal] out there late is a huge loss,” Unseld said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Christian Wood and Jalen Green had 22 points apiece for the Rockets.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what else to know from the Wizards’ loss:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Too many giveaways</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The Wizards had 15 turnovers for the second game in a row Wednesday. The Rockets didn’t make much of them, scoring just nine points, but the giveaways disrupted Washington’s offense and kept them from getting in rhythm all game.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Trouble from long range</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kuzma was the worst of the bunch, missing all eight of his attempts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Bertans injured</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unseld did not know the severity of the sprain immediately after the game.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bertans had improved his three-point shooting percentage from 25 percent in his first 15 games of the season to 45 percent in his past 10. His field goal percentage jumped from 28.8 to 46.8.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Three Wizards clear protocols</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Guards Dinwiddie and Holiday and forward Rui Hachimura cleared the protocols Wednesday, though they all sat out to ramp up their conditioning before they jump back into game play.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unseld hopes to have Dinwiddie and Holiday available to bolster a depleted group of guards for the Wizards’ upcoming trip to Chicago and Orlando. Hachimura’s return, meanwhile, is slightly further off.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s close,” Unseld said of the 23-year-old from Japan. “I don’t think there’s a definitive timetable, but he’s close.”</p></div></div>
<p>Four players remain in the coronavirus protocols: Montrezl Harrell, Anthony Gill, Tremont Waters and Brad Wanamaker. The Wizards signed Waters and Wanamaker to 10-day contracts as relief, and both entered the protocols after playing just one game.</p>

<div><h1>Late-season surge could cost the Lions the No. 1 pick, and they’re just fine with that</h1></div>

<a>a 30-12 dismantling of the Arizona Cardinals</a> on Sunday that ranks as one of the most stunning upsets of the season. In handing the Cardinals their first road loss of the year, the Lions became only the
<a>third team in the Super Bowl era</a> with two or fewer wins to defeat an opponent with at least 10 wins. The victory also allowed the Jacksonville Jaguars, who fell to 2-12 with their sixth straight loss, to jump the Lions for the top spot in the
<a>NFL draft order</a>. At 3-11, the Houston Texans and New York Jets are also in the running for the No. 1 pick.
