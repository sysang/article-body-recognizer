<h3>Put Things in Perspective</h3>
<p>Step back, reevaluate, and use these four keys to build relationship confidence. </p>
<p>1. We’ve all got questions. </p>
<p>You’re not alone in questioning aspects of your relationship. Your relationship is important, so it would be odder if you didn’t question anything about it.</p>
<p>What this means is that questioning is common and isn’t a betrayal or fatal flaw. It’s normal, and an opportunity to strengthen your relationship. </p>
<p>2. The more you know…</p>
<a>Dunning-Kruger effect</a>. [6]
<a>recognizing areas of strength you may have overlooked</a>.
<p>3. Move beyond the binary. </p>
<p>4. Comparisons are killers. </p>

<h1> Letting the Chips Fall: Control and Letting Go With Your Children </h1>
<h2> Are you willing to wake up to your parenting experience? </h2>
<p> Posted September 26, 2011 </p>
<a>parenting</a> as well - we, as parents, set our sights on specific
<a>goals</a> and outcomes for our kids, and then . . . reality says otherwise.
<p>A metaphor I've used in session with parents and kids has to do with holding a coin in your hand. "This coin represents that ‘thing' you want to happen - that thing this is very, very important to you," I say.</p>
<p>I plop the coin into the palm of their hand. "Grip it very tightly - as tight as you can." I wait until I can see the whites in their knuckles, suggesting the gripping is sufficiently intense.</p>
<p>"Now turn your hand over, fingers facing the floor. Now imagine releasing your grip on this thing - this thing you want so badly." I wait for "the look" - the sense from the person that "no, I don't want to let go of it."</p>
<p>"Go ahead and turn your hand over," I say. "Now slowly open your fingers." I watch as they look at the coin resting there that now means much more than one-tenth of a candy bar. It holds the mass and weight of their most important desires.</p>
<p>"Are you willing to let it just sit there in your open palm? Let it sit without clutching at it as long as it will. Let it sit there despite anything that might happen to bounce it out of your grasp?"</p>
<a>mindful</a> engagement of present moment experience. We manage pain better, symptoms of disease abate more readily, anxiety calms and
<a>depression</a> eases more when we learn to mindfully watch and allow our moment-to-moment experience. Our pain, symptoms, fears all seem to increase when we grip at them, try to "control" them away.
<p>Parents shouldn't play "Plinko" with their children's college savings, but they should learn to let go of gripping things so tightly in their daily parenting that the few chips they're greedily holding never fall in the first place.</p>

<h1> Invisible Wounds of the Sensitive, Emotionally Intense Child </h1>
<h2> Childhood wounding does not always take a physical form. </h2>
<p>This post is about a challenging, but important subject—the "invisible" psychological wounds for the sensitive and intense child. It also serves as a sequel to an earlier post, “Were You an Intense Child?”</p>
<p><a>Childhood</a> wounding does not always take a physical form. Our society typically recognizes the horror of physical child neglect, but not the emotional pain that comes from toxic relationships.</p>
<a>sibling</a> rivalries, or over-control. Children who are emotionally
<a>gifted</a>, either due to their innate wiring or necessary adaptation, are more likely to fall into certain roles and dynamics, such as becoming enmeshed or parentified. Their emotional
<a>trauma</a> may not be a result of conscious or malicious acts but remain unspoken of and unnoticed for years.
<a>empathic</a>, all children have particular needs that must be met. They have the right to safety, to be protected from harm, to receive love and
<a>emotional regulation</a>. They are acutely aware of and have intense responses to what happens to them and around them, which may exacerbate the impact of any childhood difficulties.
<a>rage</a> in upon himself or act it out on others, else it all will turn into madness.”

<a>mindful</a> of not perpetuating the mother-blaming culture). We can see how this can easily happen with the empathic child: When the parent feels down, the child can quickly sense it and would show their genuine concern. Their
<a>intuition</a>, insightful questions, and profound love make them the most available and loving ally.

<a>a previous post, </a>there are six specific conditions within the Schizophrenia and Related Conditions (AKA psychotic disorders) chapter of the
<a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, 5th Edition (DSM-5). Though this may seem like a lot to get a handle on, it’s really just a matter of understanding symptom arrangement and duration:
<h3>Schizophrenia-Spectrum Disorders</h3>
<p>Schizophrenia. For at least six months, some combination of at least two psychotic disorder symptoms as outlined <a>here.</a></p>
<p>Schizophreniform. As above, but the active-phase symptoms last one month up to six months. While some people periodically experience just a few months of symptoms and stabilize, many with schizophreniform go on to develop schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Brief Psychotic Disorder. For one day to one month, the person experiences one or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions or disorganized thought process. There could well be some combination of them, also.</p>
<a>hypomania</a>/mixed episodes also occur, it's Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type.
<a>personality disorder</a>, or
<a>OCD</a>-spectrum condition that it may be a part of.
<h3>Conditions with psychotic features</h3>
<p>Now that it’s clear how to tell the schizophrenia-spectrum conditions apart, let’s look at how to differentiate those from conditions that have psychotic features.</p>
<a>Depression</a> or Bipolar Disorder. At first, this may be hard to tell from Schizoaffective Disorder. However, the noticeable difference is that the psychosis only occurs during a major depressive, manic, or mixed episode.
<a>romantic relationship</a> and their partner asks for space because they're feeling smothered, the BPD patient reflexively perceives this as a guaranteed pending abandonment because they're unacceptable, and "surely they're
<a>cheating on</a> me with someone else." So convinced are they that they are being cheated on, they begin spying on the partner. Meanwhile, they may be hearing voices that they're no good, because if they were, this person wouldn't have cheated on them.

<div> <div> <h1>Catatonia</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric condition that affects both behavior and motor function, and results in unresponsiveness in someone who otherwise appears to be awake.</p>
<p>According to the <a>DSM-5</a>, at least three out of twelve symptoms must be present for a diagnosis of catatonia. These symptoms include: </p>
<li>Stupor (oblivious inability to move or respond to stimuli), catalepsy (rigid body posture)</li>
<li>Mutism (little to no verbal communication)</li>
<li>Waxy flexibility (body remains in whatever position it is placed by another)</li>
<li>Negativism (lack of verbal response)</li>
<li>Posturing (holding a posture or position that goes against gravity)</li>
<li>Mannerisms (extreme or odd movements and mannerisms)</li>
<li>Stereotypy (frequent repetitive movements for no reason)</li>
<li>Agitation (for no reason), grimacing (distorted facial expressions)</li>
<li>Echolalia (repeating others’ words)</li>
<li>Echopraxia (repeating others’ movements)</li>
<a>psychiatric</a> conditions, where there are likely to be lengthy remissions.
<div> <h3> What are the different types of catatonia? </h3> </div>
<a>self-harm</a>. Malignant Catatonia involves medical problems such as high blood pressure, rapid breathing, and a faster heart rate.
<div> <h3> What is the history of catatonia? </h3> </div>
<a>catatonia has distinct features</a> and actually occurs more frequently in patients with mood disorders than schizophrenia. It is now
<a>diagnosed as its own entity in the DSM-5,</a> unspecified or associated with another mental disorder or medical condition.
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<a>trauma</a>, and mood disorders are associated with catatonia. Catatonia can also be idiopathic, arising from an unknown cause.
<div> <h3> How common is catatonia? </h3> </div>
<a>research suggests</a> that catatonia occurs in 9 to 17 percent of patients with acute psychiatric illnesses, such as schizophrenia,
<a>depression</a>. Catatonia is more prevalent among those with mood disorders than schizophrenia.
<div> <h3> What are the risk factors associated with catatonia? </h3> </div>
<a>research suggests.</a> Catatonia is also more
<a>antidepressants</a>, muscle relaxers, and antipsychotic medications. Brain stimulation
<a>therapy</a>, such as electroconvulsive therapy, is used in some cases.
<p>Medical treatment will also vary depending on co-existing conditions. In the case of a vitamin deficiency, catatonia can easily be treated with supplemental nutrients.</p>

<h2>Mothers who can never measure up.</h2>
<a>child-rearing is an all-consuming task</a> where even small failures are not an option, parents (particularly mothers) are showing
<a>record-high levels of stress</a>. There is so much that parents are told they should and should not do for their children, and the only standard is perfection. In this

<h1> Why So Many People Feel Like Impostors </h1>
<h2> Exploring the contextual underpinnings of impostor feelings. </h2>
<li>The impostor phenomenon—an internal experience of intellectual fraudulence—is common among successful individuals, but particularly among women.</li>
<li>Gender differences in impostor feelings are magnified in contexts perceived to value “raw intellect” (i.e., brilliance) for success.</li>
<li>Impostor feelings are better understood as a response to unwelcoming environments, rather than an individual affliction.</li>
<li>The brilliance-valuing ethos may represent an obstacle to women’s professional advancement.</li>
<p>Co-authored with Andrei Cimpian</p>
<a>research</a> substantiated initial claims that the impostor phenomenon is gendered by showing that women average stronger levels of impostor feelings than men.
<a>Other research</a> documented that feelings of
<a>anxiety</a> often accompany impostor feelings—illustrating the impostor phenomenon’s relevance to psychological well-being.

<a>research</a> that examined the phenomenon’s association with
<p>This may not be the case.</p>
<a>one study</a> found that African-American college students who had more frequent experiences with racial
<a>discrimination</a> reported stronger impostor feelings.
<a>Another study</a> showed that people who are more concerned with being stigmatized because of their
<a>gender</a> experienced higher levels of the impostor phenomenon. Together, these studies offered support for the idea that environment plays a key role in impostor experiences.
<p>Inspired by this shift in focus, we thought that certain workplace cultures—even ones not overtly negative—might prompt women to question their abilities and success.</p>
<a>cultural stereotypes</a> that characterize men, not women, as brilliant.
<a>prior speculation</a> that women of color may be particularly likely to experience impostor feelings because of their doubly stigmatized
<a>recent work</a>, we and our colleagues have found that diminishing elements of brilliance-oriented environments, such as extreme self-reliance and ruthless competitiveness, have positive consequences for women’s psychological well-being.
<a>growing calls</a> to address the contextual origins of the phenomenon. Practically, we hope this research draws
