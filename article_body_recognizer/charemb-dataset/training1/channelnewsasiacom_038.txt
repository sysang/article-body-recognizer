<p>"We try to show that kids are the ones demanding and making the changes. Climate change education has to be everywhere at every age group. It’s so critical and it’s surprising that it’s not taken very seriously or urgently.”</p>
<p>They aim to challenge assumptions that learning about climate change is too complex or daunting for children, and eventually advocate for governments to include this type of material themselves.</p>
<p>Climate impacts such as flooding, cyclones, water scarcity, disease and air pollution overlap and compound in many parts of the world. Children in those often-poor parts of the world face even more future risks.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Omicron spreads in India, full vaccination in focus </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>NEW DELHI: Cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant have risen to 21 in India over the weekend and people must step up for vaccination, officials said on Monday (Dec 6).</p>
<p>The western state of Rajasthan reported the most number of Omicron cases with nine, followed by eight in Maharashtra, two in Karnataka and one each in Gujarat and the capital New Delhi.</p>
<p>He said the city's first Omicron patient was being treated at a state-run hospital. Some 94 per cent of its adults had received at lease one dose, he added.</p>
<p>The country has fully vaccinated 51 per cent of its 944 million adults and given at least one dose to 85 per cent. Tens of millions of people, however, are overdue for their second dose despite ample vaccine supplies, government data shows.</p>
<p><a>India reported its first two Omicron cases</a> in the southern state of Karnataka on Thursday, in one person with no recent travel history.</p>
<p>Most other cases have been in people who have recently come from abroad, but doctors said the mutated virus was already spreading in the local population as well.</p>
<p>"Mask up. Get FULLY vaccinated."</p>
<p>India reported 8,895 new COVID-19 cases for the past 24 hours, taking the total to 34.64 million. Deaths rose by 211 to 473,537.</p>
<p>Since a record surge in infections and deaths in April and May due to the Delta variant, new cases have hovered around 10,000 in the past few weeks.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> 'Karate is a part of my life': Afghan champion keeps hope alive for refugees stranded in Indonesia </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Nivell Rayda </a> </div> </div>
<p>BOGOR, INDONESIA: As soon as the dojo was open, some 30 students of the Cisarua Refugee Shotokan Karate Club hurried their way to the second floor of a rundown gym on a small alleyway of Cisarua, a hilly town just outside of Jakarta.</p>
<p>Already in their white karate uniform, several students immediately headed to the punching bag to practise their roundhouse kicks. Others warmed up by doing splits on the mouldy carpet as well as leapfrogging over each other.</p>
<p>The blue painted room, walls of which were covered with faded and broken mirrors, was buzzing with grunts, yells and laughs from students aged between six and 37.</p>
<p>Training three times a week for two hours each, they run dozens of laps, practice their stances, punches, kicks and blocks as well as spar together. </p>
<p>During these sessions, they seem to forget the fact that each one of them was either born in countries in conflict like Afghanistan or Iraq or in refugee camps around the world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other countries are tightening their borders because of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as strong anti-immigrant sentiments, dimming the refugees’ chances of being resettled permanently elsewhere.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, refugees could spend at least three years before the UNHCR finds a country willing to accept them. There are people who have waited more than ten years and still find themselves in limbo. </p>
<p>But being a refugee also led her to discover karate. She first learned the Japanese martial art at the age of 13 during her time in Pakistan.</p>
<p>She hoped to pass the lessons she learnt from karate to her pupils when she founded the Cisarua Refugee Shotokan Karate club in January 2016.</p>
<p>“The thing which motivated me to open a karate club was to help the refugees. Because they (are) always alone at home. They don’t have activities. That’s why I opened this club,” Asadi told CNA.</p>
<h2>BREAKING DOWN GENDER BARRIERS</h2>
<p>A civil war between various Afghan militias had already begun when Asadi was born in 1992. Among these militias, the Taliban eventually emerged as the strongest force and rapidly took control of many cities, including Asadi’s hometown Ghazni.</p>
<p>By 1996, the Taliban managed to control virtually all of Afghanistan and instilled a strict and conservative form of Islamic law and code. They banned music and film and prohibited women from working, getting higher education and practicing sports.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any good memories from my childhood,” she said.</p>
<p>Asadi was 13-years-old when she first learned karate in 2005 at a club near the refugee camp where she lived. She was driven by her motivation to do sports as well as her male counterparts.</p>
<div> <div> <h4> <div>Related:</div> </h4> </div> </div>
<p>The federation, she recounted, made arrangements so she could obtain a Pakistani passport in order to compete at the games. Asadi won two medals for Pakistan.</p>
<p>Upon returning to Afghanistan in 2011, Asadi quickly set up her own dojo in Afghan capital Kabul.</p>
<p>Asadi, a member of the Hazara ethnic Shia minority group often persecuted under the Taliban, insisted that her dojo would be a place where girls and boys could train together as equals.</p>
<p>This did not bode well with conservative Muslims in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“At the time, karate was also new in Afghanistan. Some narrow-minded people thought that it was a foreign sport. They also didn’t think that girls (should be) allowed to do sport,” Asadi’s husband Ashraf Jawadi told CNA.</p>
<p>The media exposure that Asadi was receiving as an accomplished female athlete and a champion for gender equality also made her a prime target in the eyes of the Taliban and its network of supporters.</p>
<p>“They disturbed the students, especially the girls after they left the dojo. Sometimes they threw stones at the dojo,” Jawadi continued.</p>
<p>The final straw came when the Taliban launched a bomb attack against a nearby sports club in 2015.</p>
<p>“We thought if we continued, maybe they (would) throw a bomb (at our dojo) someday. There wasn’t anything from the government to protect us. So, we (thought) enough was enough. We have to save our lives,” Jawadi said.</p>
<p>With their then one-year-old daughter Setayesh, the trio fled Afghanistan in 2015. Some of their friends suggested that they make their way to Indonesia, and they have remained in the Southeast Asian country since then.</p>
<p>So much was Asadi’s love for karate that as soon as she arrived in Indonesia, Asadi immediately sought ways for her to teach the martial art.</p>
<p>“Karate is my passion. Karate is a part of my life. I love to teach others karate,” she said.</p>
<p>But starting her own dojo in a country a world apart from her own was very challenging.</p>
<p>“It was very very difficult, because I didn’t have friends here. I cannot (speak) Bahasa (Indonesia). I didn’t know the way. Where should I go? How should I (talk to) other people?” Asadi recounted.</p>
<p>Two months after Asadi arrived in Indonesia, the karate club was opened, maintaining the same inclusivity that her old dojo in Afghanistan was known for, a place where boys and girls from Afghanistan, Iraq and other countries can train together. </p>
<p>Asadi said she feared for the future of her country after the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan following the US military withdrawal.</p>
<p>“I don’t have many hopes for my country. I don’t know what will happen (to) my country,” she said, adding she is also worried about her parents and siblings who are still in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>The Taliban’s return to power had dashed all hopes for her of ever returning to her birth country. The only option now is to wait for a third country which is willing to grant her and her family asylum.</p>
<p>“I (want to) go to (a) third country. Here, we don’t have the right to work. I have lived here (for) six years. I wish this (uncertain) situation (will be over) soon and I can practice karate professionally,” she said.</p>
<p>Yet she also felt conflicted about leaving, wondering who will continue her work at the karate club in Cisarua, which heavily relies on donations to pay for rent, equipment, students’ competition fees and belt exam tests.</p>
<p>But she might not have to look far to find a successor, for Asadi had inspired a generation of young athletes.</p>
<p>“A lot of people told me, if I get my black belt then I should finish (learning karate). But I will just ignore them. My dream is to be like my sensei and when I go to a third country I want to continue (karate),” he said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Canada's ambassador to China to leave post after helping free detainees </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>OTTAWA: Canada's ambassador to China said on Monday (Dec 6) he would soon leave his post after a two-year assignment where he helped secure the freedom of two Canadian detainees despite icy relations between Beijing and Ottawa.</p>
<p>Dominic Barton's departure, which will take effect on Dec 31, leaves a crucial diplomatic post open at a time when the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is rethinking its policy towards a more assertive China.</p>
<p>Barton said in a statement that working to free the two men had been "the honor of a lifetime".</p>
<p>Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor spent almost three years in detention before being freed in September. The two were jailed shortly after Canadian police picked up a top Huawei Technologies Co Inc executive on a US warrant.</p>
<p>Trudeau, under pressure from the official opposition Conservatives to take a tougher line with China over human rights, said Canada was "better positioned to manage this important relationship and achieve our diplomatic objectives".</p>
<p>Two senior diplomatic sources said Canada was putting together a new strategy for the Indo-Pacific region, in part to deal with China. Canadian officials say Ottawa, which has limited diplomatic influence, must work with others.</p>
<p>In February, Canada launched a 58-nation initiative to stop countries from detaining foreign citizens for diplomatic leverage, a practice that Ottawa says China is using.</p>
<p>Another possibility is Sarah Taylor, a fluent Mandarin speaker, who is ambassador to Thailand.</p>
<p>The office of Foreign Minister Melanie Joly did not immediately respond to questions about when a replacement might be named or whether Canada might consider a diplomatic boycott.</p>

<h1> Thai start-up on a mission to revive old clothes and slow down fashion industry </h1>
<div> <p>A new online start-up in Thailand wants to make clothing repair easy and stylish in order to make the fashion industry more sustainable.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Pichayada Promchertchoo </a> </div> </div>
<p>BANGKOK: Hau Thi Pa was heavily pregnant with her first child. Still, she insisted on joining a workshop in Bangkok with other Hmong refugees from Vietnam earlier this year.</p>
<p>A few of them were mothers with young babies. Their tiny faces popped out from sling bags on their mothers’ backs, all hand-sewn and decorated in the ethnic Hmong style.</p>
<p>“I want to be able to earn income by myself,” Hau Thi Pa told CNA. </p>
<p>The 20-year-old arrived in Thailand with her family at a very young age. She is skilled at sewing, which is a Hmong traditional art form passed down from mothers to daughters for generations.</p>
<p>Like other participants, Hau Thi Pa was learning the art of redesigning old clothes for customers in the workshop organised by Reviv - a Bangkok-based online start-up that offers clothing repair and alteration services.</p>
<p>Besides giving old clothes a new life, it also promotes a fashion culture that cares more about the environment and the vulnerable in society.</p>
<p>“In fact, we’ve already had enough clothes for everyone in this world. The problem is a lot of them were simply discarded.”</p>
<p>Reviv was launched in early September with a main goal of educating consumers about the environmental and social impacts of the fashion industry. It offers online services to make clothing repair and alteration easier and more convenient.</p>
<p>Although such services are not uncommon in Thailand, it is not always easy to find the providers nowadays. Many of them are scattered outside the city centre and do not have a fixed working schedule.</p>
<p>Moreover, many Thai consumers have adopted a negative attitude towards old clothes, according to Poom. </p>
<p>“Repairing or reusing old clothes may not be so fancy or well accepted,” he said. </p>
<p>“The culture of fast fashion has taught us to associate our self-worth or value with buying new clothes all the time. So, opting for old clothes doesn’t quite boost people’s self-esteem.”</p>
<p>By connecting consumers with quality artisans online, his start-up hopes to change such perception and advocate a more sustainable kind of fashion in the country.</p>
<p>Its services are available on the web and the Line messaging app. Customers can choose from the menu how they want their clothes repaired or changed - from patching to size adjustment and embroidery. </p>
<p>Once payment is made, customers can post their clothes to the company. They can also track the work progress online and get their clothes back within two to three weeks.</p>
<p>FAST FASHION DAMAGES ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>Despite its main service in clothing repair, Reviv was in fact created with a green mission to fight fast fashion in Thailand, where garments are affordable and easily discarded. </p>
<p>Fast fashion refers to the mass production of inexpensive, trendy garments that are low-quality and disposable. The business model is common in Thailand and often employs low-paid workers.</p>
<p>Data from international market research and analytics firm YouGov showed four in 10 Thai adults have thrown away an item of clothing after wearing it just once.</p>
<p>In October 2017, it conducted research with 1,137 respondents in Thailand and found that one in five millennials - those aged between 25 and 40 now - keep their clothes for under a year before throwing them away.</p>
<p>“The most popular reason for disposing of clothes is because they no longer fit, which 45 per cent consider grounds for throwing garments away,” YouGov reported.</p>
<p>Other common reasons are because their clothes have been damaged. The research also showed millennials are more likely to dispose of their garments because they are “bored” of wearing them, compared to the older generation.</p>
<p>“Across all generations, nearly one in five (17 per cent) have thrown unwanted clothes in the bin,” YouGov added.</p>
<p>Every second, the UN said, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or burned and if nothing changes, “by 2050 the fashion industry will use up a quarter of the world’s carbon budget”.</p>
<p>Although more retailers are moving towards sustainable fashion that is friendlier to the environment, their transformation does not address the overconsumption in the fashion industry.</p>
<p>“If consumers continue to consume too much and forget about their old clothes, the problems of this industry will never end, no matter how many fashion brands are environmentally friendly,” Poom said.</p>
<p>“FELT LIKE I GOT A NEW PAIR OF JEANS”</p>
<p>By making clothing repair easy and more accessible, Reviv’s co-founders hope more people would reuse their clothes instead of buying new ones while saving the planet from more carbon footprints, waste and plastic.</p>
<p>They also offer various styles of needlework to help clients customise a new look for their old garments, giving them a new life that is not just stylish but also tailored to what each person needs.</p>
<p>“When I got them back, I wasn’t so excited. But when I put them on, I felt like I had got a new pair of jeans. Nowadays, when I need to go somewhere, I’d grab them first with no hesitation,” she told CNA.</p>
<p>“I like that there are patterns and we can choose them ourselves. The needlework is neat.”</p>
<p>Besides a new look for her old jeans, Jirapa also enjoyed the fact that one more garment was saved from the landfill. Her purchase also went towards helping ethnic minorities such as Hau Thi Pa as well as other vulnerable groups in society.</p>
<p>Through its choices of raw materials, business partners and artisans, Reviv hopes to remind its customers of various social issues, from the statelessness of refugees to a lack of social security among non-registered garment labour. </p>
<p>It also works with suppliers who have special needs and visually impaired craftsmen who create textiles and embroidered fabrics for its customers. </p>
<p>“Customers can use their work to repair or redesign their clothes. By doing so, they give voice to these voiceless people,” Poom told CNA.</p>
<p>“They do it by wearing their stories, showing and telling them to others.”</p>
<p>For Hau Thi Pa, who currently heads the sewing team, the job has enabled her to utilise her sewing skills to support her family.</p>
<p>Each time she works, the young mother also gets to save a piece of clothing from landfill. </p>
<p>“I want my customers to be happy with the clothes they still want to keep wearing,” she said.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Please don't give up on Myanmar </h1>
<div> <p>Developments in Myanmar seem to have been cast aside from the global spotlight as more recent events capture international attention. A Brookings Institution researcher explains how the international community can tackle the impasse.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Nay Yan Oo </a> </div> </div>
<p>ITHACA, New York: Myanmar is on the edge of a state collapse nearly 11 months after a military coup. Violence and insecurity have followed the coup, while the country is also suffering greatly from COVID-19 and a resulting economic crisis.</p>
<p>But the Southeast Asian country of 54 million people is slipping away from headlines, as other important global issues are occupying the world's attention.</p>
<p>But they are struggling to change the junta's course as its State Administration Council (SAC) was smart enough to court China and Russia, both of which have continued to undermine the West's efforts to pressure the military regime.</p>
<p>While China is unhappy with the political instability created by the coup, it has not openly sided with the rival National Unity Government (NUG). Meanwhile, the Myanmar army's relationship with Moscow has reached an all-time high.</p>
<p>The international community thus does not have much leverage to address the political crisis in Myanmar, but they can still do at least three things to help the country.</p>
<h2>BRING ALL PARTIES TO THE NEGOTIATION TABLE</h2>
<p>Both parties are determined to defeat the opposite side in a civil war. But violence is not - and should not - be the answer to settle this dispute, especially when the conflict has reached a stalemate.</p>
<p>The outside world must help foster a return to a democratic path in Myanmar through a peaceful resolution because it has invested so much in the country in the past 10 years supporting the democratic transition.</p>
<p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) reached a five-point consensus with the coup leaders in April, which included immediately ceasing the violence and beginning a constructive dialogue among all parties.</p>
<p>So far, the SAC is not keen to implement the ASEAN consensus. To be fair, the NUG is not interested in engaging in a dialogue process either. The opposition movement wants to remove the Tatmadaw from power once and for all.</p>
<p>Both sides are trying to get the control of the country, but before this fierce competition ends, Myanmar could fall to pieces.</p>
<p>A large part of the country has already been a battleground for numerous fights between the military and resistance groups, and the human and economic costs of a civil war would be astronomical.</p>
<p>The outside world must pressure and persuade both the SAC and the NUG to come to the negotiation table. The junta is paranoid with anti-Western sentiments, and it does not have much respect for ASEAN either.</p>
<p>But the generals are comfortable with some global figures, such as Bill Richardson of the United States and Yōhei Sasakawa of Japan. Both visited Myanmar in November, and they should continue talking to the top brass.</p>
<p>Quiet diplomacy by global statesmen whom the junta seems to trust could perhaps persuade the generals to negotiate. Similarly, the West needs to convince the NUG that political dialogue is a way forward.</p>
<p>China holds much leverage on both sides, so it is essential to have Beijing on board in this negotiation process as well.</p>
<h2>PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE</h2>
<p>Myanmar is experiencing one of the worst crises since its independence. Fighting with several ethnic armed organisations resumed after the coup.</p>
<p>The NUG and its military wing, the People's Defence Forces (PDFs), along with various armed resistance groups, are carrying out guerrilla warfare against the Tatmadaw.</p>
<p>The junta seems determined to destroy the PDFs. As in conflict areas in the past, the Myanmar military is now committing human rights violations against combatants and civilians.</p>
<p>Violence has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. On top of that, a new wave of COVID-19 in July and August killed thousands more and paralysed the country's healthcare system.</p>
<p>Compared to other countries in the region, Myanmar has low levels of vaccination coverage, which leaves it vulnerable to future COVID-19 waves.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the twin crisis of the coup and the pandemic are severely impacting an economy that is expected to contract around 18 per cent this year, according to the World Bank.</p>
<p>The United Nations emergency relief coordinator said that three million people across Myanmar need life-saving humanitarian assistance because of rising conflict and insecurity, the pandemic, and a failing economy.</p>
<p>The international community must work with the U.N. and NGOs to provide humanitarian aid to Myanmar. As Richardson told The New York Times, 54 million people should not suffer because of the political crisis of the military takeover.</p>
<p>The world can help by providing COVID-19 vaccines, offering assistance to internally displaced persons, and contributing economic support to small businesses and the poor.</p>
<p>There is a risk that delivering aid to Myanmar allows the Tatmadaw to claim credit and bolster its domestic support.</p>
<h2>ENGAGE WITH THE TATMADAW</h2>
<p>During Myanmar's democratic transition, the Western governments and NGOs poured millions of dollars into the country to build the capacity of local CSOs and nurture political and social activists.</p>
<p>They are now at the forefront of the resistance movement against the coup. Western nations, however, failed to engage with the Tatmadaw.</p>
<p>Social media, particularly Facebook, fueled political polarisation in Myanmar, creating intense fights between Tatmadaw supporters and Aung San Suu Kyi fans on the internet.</p>
<p>Even though the military has sent thousands of officers to Russia for graduate studies, they are still cementing authoritarian mindsets due to a lack of exposure to democratic education.</p>
<p>To change Myanmar, the Tatmadaw must be changed. The international community should start thinking about engaging with Myanmar's military after the current political turmoil ends.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome of the present crisis, it is likely that the Tatmadaw, as the country's strongest institution, will still be there.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> Blinken says US to look at more Myanmar measures, plans ASEAN summit </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Engaging with the Tatmadaw is thus required, but it does not mean lifting existing arms embargoes or transferring military technology to Myanmar.</p>
<p>Western countries should provide norm transmission and diffusion through international exposure and education related to democratic values.</p>
<p>Offering the Tatmadaw training on democracy, human rights, and leadership should be considered. Even teaching English to Myanmar military officers would be a good start.</p>
<p>The United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries tried these initiatives briefly, though they all ended after the Rohingya crisis broke out in 2016-2017.</p>
<p>This time, the West should put more effort into helping to integrate the Tatmadaw into the international arena to end their isolation.</p>
<p>Reforming an army entrenched in power for decades - with a record of human rights violations - will take time, of course. But with patience and the right strategy, it is worth trying.</p>
<p>The ongoing political crisis in Myanmar has no end in sight. The hard-won democratic achievements of the last 10 years have disappeared.</p>
<p>No one knows what the future will look like. But an armed revolution might not be a wise idea, given the brutal counterinsurgency history of the Tatmadaw.</p>
<p>The international community should bring all parties to the negotiable table to start constructive dialogues to achieve a peaceful resolution.</p>
<p>Global statesmen should continue quiet diplomacy to persuade the generals to stop violence and perhaps finally agree to talk with the democratic movement.</p>
<p>The NUG could come to the negotiation table when they realise that armed revolution cannot topple the military regime. Humanitarian aid must be delivered to the poor and most vulnerable groups inside the country and along the border.</p>
<p>As a long-term solution, the West should engage with the Tatmadaw to reform it as a professional army by discouraging their isolation and giving them access to a liberal education.</p>
<p>The world should not give up on Myanmar.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> From marine waste to fashion: A journey of flip-flops and trash heroes from Thailand’s far south </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Pichayada Promchertchoo </a> </div> </div>
<p>PATTANI, Thailand: It was a journey that began five years ago on the islands of Satun, with 100,000 flip-flops and sandals that had been spat out by the sea and washed ashore.</p>
<p>It was not known where this debris had come from or how far it had travelled before reaching some of the most beautiful beaches in southern Thailand.</p>
<p>These discarded shoes may have been unwanted before, but someone wanted them now.</p>
<p>When the shoes arrived at his house, he was stunned. Tens of thousands of flip-flops brought together from the sea were piled on top of one another in a ten-wheeled truck – dirty, mismatched and worthless.</p>
<p>The sight struck Nattapong, as he realised the shocking multitude of ocean debris.</p>
<p>“They said they had collected 80,000kg of marine trash in three months and that my part alone weighed 8,000kg, including some 100,000 pieces of shoe,” he said.</p>
<blockquote> <p>I didn’t picture there’d be so much ocean waste. It’s unimaginable when you don’t see it with your own eyes.</p> </blockquote>
<p>The mountain of flip-flops in front of his house and the underlying reality of marine trash motivated Nattapong to seek a solution.</p>
<p>His team chose to develop a business model that would turn discarded flip-flops from Thai beaches into new ones of higher quality and value. The project was called Tlejourn. It means ‘wandering across the sea’ in Thai.</p>
<p>Today, Tlejourn has grown into a social enterprise that not only recycles ocean waste but also supports the local economy and raises awareness about marine debris through its products – flip-flops.</p>
<p>Their signature is a colourful insole made of tiny pieces of discarded shoes. Each one of them is unique and carries a message about the waste problem.</p>
<p>“Our solution isn’t about technology but rather mindset,” Nattapong said.</p>
<p>“Waste shouldn’t only be used as a filler. It should be turned into a new product because a product can sell and requires a raw material. So if we use waste as raw material, its commercial function can drive its utilisation.”</p>
<p>"TLEJOURN": WALK WITH A STORY</p>
<p>Thailand is facing a serious environmental challenge caused by millions of tonnes of plastic waste. In fact, <a>it is the fifth biggest contributor in the world to ocean debris</a>.</p>
<p>According to a 2015 report by environmental advocacy group Ocean Conservancy, more than half of plastic waste in the ocean originated from China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand.</p>
<p>“Unless steps are taken to manage this waste properly, by 2025 the ocean could contain one tonne of plastic for every three tonnes of finfish - an unthinkable outcome,” the report added.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary - Recycle or reduce waste? Why Southeast Asia’s ocean plastic pile has no easy answers</a></h3>
<p>Earlier this month, the Thai environment minister <a>called for action to tackle environmental challenges</a> the country is facing.</p>
<p>The magnitude of waste in the ocean has made many Thais more eco-conscious. In recent years, products made with recycled materials have become increasingly common in local stores.</p>
<p>Unlike other shoe brands, however, Tlejourn does not promote comfort or design but rather a story about waste and what consumers can do for the environment and society.</p>
<p>“Our story is the real product,” said Nattapong.</p>
<blockquote> <p>For every step we’ve taken to develop, our product is our story, completely. We crafted our story before we even designed our shoe model.</p> </blockquote>
<p>The social enterprise partners with a global network of environmentalists from Trash Hero to source key raw materials – discarded flip-flops – for its production.</p>
<p>Trash Hero is a non-profit volunteer-based group. It was formed on the island of Lipe in Satun before expanding across Southeast Asia and into Australia, Europe and the United States.</p>
<p>It has worked with more than 330,000 volunteers worldwide and collected around 1.65 million kg of garbage, including at least 36 million plastic bottles.</p>
<p>“We don’t pick up trash to make it clean but we do it to clean our mind, to stop creating waste in the future, and to be aware of where trash comes from,” said Nattapong, who also supervises Trash Hero’s networks in Thailand.</p>
<p>“People who pick up trash wouldn’t want to create waste. They’d be highly aware. We want to build this group of people to change society on a wider scale.”</p>
<p>Every week, "trash heroes" across Thailand gather to collect garbage. Discarded shoe are separated and transported to Tlejourn’s production base in Pattani for recycling.</p>
<p>They are cleaned, shredded and mixed with polymer glue, then compressed and moulded into sheets. Afterwards, soles of different sizes are cut out. Whatever remains re-enters the same recycling process to produce other pairs of soles.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Atlantic plastic levels far higher than thought, according to study</a></h3>
<p>“We want a social enterprise that goes beyond the boundary a little – one with an ideal and to not just be another non-profit body,” Nattapong said.</p>
<p>The result is a zero-profit business model that strives to reduce social inequality and promote fair trade. It seeks to empower local artisans with limited job opportunities, preserve their traditional livelihoods, and provide extra income.</p>
<p>“This reduces inequality because normally, when a business grows, we’ll see a gap between CEOs and labourers. That gap always grows. But with our model, it won’t happen because we move in parallel,” Nattapong said.</p>
<p>If we look at labour in any business, it’s on the wrong side of the account book. Labour is an expense, excluded from the partnership. So, from an entrepreneur’s or an industrialist’s perspective, it’s clear they have to lower it.</p>
<p>Tlejourn built a training and production centre in a local village of Klong Maning. The space is open to public and welcomes anyone who wishes to earn extra income by assembling flip-flops.</p>
<p>“I have a small child and other children I need to send to school,” said villager Rohaning Palaya, 32. “I have to stay at home. So I do this job because it allows me to take care of my child.”</p>
<p>With precision, she punctures holes for shoe straps with a hammer while her friend glues the soles together. For five years now, they have been earning extra income from making flip-flops without having to travel far for work in the city.</p>
<p>Rohaning is one of a few women in the village who work with Tlejourn. They share a similar lifestyle that requires them to take care of young children and the elderly at home.</p>
<p>Before the social enterprise was created, a number of women in the village were jobless and had to rely on their husbands for financial support. Today, with the extra income from shoe-making, their life has improved.</p>
<p>“The job gives extra income to people in the community,” Rohaning said. “My life has changed for the better.”</p>
<p>Away from her village, trash is scattered along the beaches of Pattani – plastic bags, bottles, used diapers, lighters and dirty flip-flops washed up by the ocean waves.</p>
<p>Some of it will be picked up by trash heroes when they gather for the week. But more will gather from the incoming waves, day after day, unless environmental solutions like this can finally break the cycle of waste.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Japan confirms first known local Omicron COVID-19 transmissions </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TOKYO: Japan on Wednesday (Dec 22) confirmed its first known local transmissions of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus in Osaka, a sign it is already making its way in the country.</p>
<p>The family of three in Osaka had no record of traveling overseas and their infections could not be traced, said Osaka Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura.</p>
<p>Yoshimura said current restrictions on eateries in Osaka will remain in place, including a limit of four people per table for a maximum of two hours, to minimize risks during the yearend holiday season, when coronavirus infections surged last year.</p>
<p>About 80 previous Omicron cases have been identified in Japan, but all involved people who tested positive upon entry at airports or those linked to them, government officials have said.</p>
<p>Health Minister Shigeyuki Goto, responding to the confirmation of the Osaka cases, said the government will do its utmost to prevent a further spread of the variant.</p>
<p>Japan eased its border controls in November, but quickly reinstated a ban on most new foreign entrants after omicron was first identified in South Africa.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Tuesday that he plans to keep the border controls, among the world's most stringent, in place until more details about the Omicron variant are known.</p>
<p>Kishida said Japan is also tightening quarantine rules for those who come in close contact with omicron patients, requiring 14 days of isolation at designated facilities instead of the previous self-isolation at home.</p>
<p>He also announced plans to accelerate booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines, which started with medical workers in December.</p>

<p>KABUL: Hundreds of people braved sub-zero temperatures in Afghanistan's capital to queue outside the passport office early Sunday (Dec 19), a day after the Taliban government announced it would <a>resume issuing travel documents</a>.</p>
<p>Many began their wait the previous night and most stood patiently in single file - some desperate to leave the country for medical treatment, others to escape the Islamists' renewed rule.</p>
<p>Tense Taliban personnel periodically charged crowds that formed at the front of the queue and at a nearby roadblock.</p>
<p>"We don't want any suicide attack or explosion to happen," said Taliban security operative Ajmal Toofan, 22, expressing concerns about the dangers of crowding.</p>
<p>The local branch of the Islamic State group, the Taliban's principal enemy, killed more than 150 people in late August when citizens massed at Kabul airport in a desperate bid to leave during the early days of the new regime.</p>
<p>"Our responsibility here is to protect people," Toofan added calmly, his gun pointed professionally towards the ground. "But the people are not cooperating."</p>
<p>He spoke to AFP as one of his colleagues pushed a man who then fell headlong just short of a coil of barbed wire.</p>
<p>Mohammed Osman Akbari, 60, said he was urgently trying to reach Pakistan, because dilapidated hospitals at home were unable to complete his heart surgery.</p>
<p>Medics "put springs in my heart", he said, referring to a stent. "They need to be removed and it's not possible here."</p>
<p>Nearby, ambulances containing people too sick to queue were parked at the side of the road.</p>
<p>"The patient has a heart problem," said ambulance driver Muslim Fakhri, 21, referring to a 43-year-old man lying on a stretcher inside his vehicle.</p>
<p>An applicant has to be present to ensure the passport is issued, he explained.</p>
<p>The Taliban initially stopped issuing passports shortly after their return to power, which came as the previous, Western-backed regime imploded in the final stages of a US military withdrawal.</p>
<p>In October, authorities reopened the passport office in Kabul only to suspend work days later as a flood of applications caused the biometric equipment to break down.</p>
<p>But the office said Saturday that the issue has been resolved and those whose applications were already in process can now get their documents.</p>
<p>Mursal Rasooli, 26, said she was happy to hear the news.</p>
<p>"The situation here is not peaceful," she told AFP, hugging her two-year-old daughter Bibi Hawa close for dual relief against the biting cold.</p>
<p>"If the situation gets worse than this, then we have the passport" and can flee, she said.</p>
<p>Her husband is in Iran because he could not find work here, she added, before expressing concern about skyrocketing prices and a lack of jobs and education for women and girls.</p>
<p>Issuing passports - and allowing people to leave amid a humanitarian crisis the UN has called an "avalanche of hunger" is seen as a test of the Taliban's commitment to the international community.</p>
<p>The Taliban are meanwhile pressing donors to restore billions of dollars in aid that was suspended when they came to power.</p>
<p>Local musician Omid Naseer, sporting a leather jacket, short beard and unkempt hair, was desperate to leave.</p>
<p>For "months now, since the Taliban came (to power), we've had no work", he said.</p>
<p>"The artists are most vulnerable, but no one cares."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> 'We're not giving up': The radio station for Afghan women </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>KABUL: From Taliban-controlled Kabul, Radio Begum is broadcasting the voices of women that have been muted across Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Station staff fill the airwaves with programming for women, by women: Educational shows, book readings and call-in counselling.</p>
<p>For now, they operate with the permission of the hardline extremists who regained power in August and have limited the ability for women to work and girls to attend school.</p>
<p>"We're not giving up," pledged 48-year-old Hamida Aman, the station's founder, who grew up in Switzerland after her family fled Afghanistan a few years after the Soviet Union invaded.</p>
<p>"We have to show that we don't need to be scared," said Aman, who returned after the ousting of the Taliban's first regime in 2001 by US-led foreign forces.</p>
<p>"We must occupy the public sphere."</p>
<p>The station was founded on Mar 8, International Women's Day, this year, five months before the Taliban marched into Kabul and finalised their defeat of the US-backed government.</p>
<p>"Begum" was a noble title used in South Asia, and it now generally refers to a married Muslim woman.</p>
<p>"This station is a vessel for women's voices, their pain, their frustrations," Aman said.</p>
<p>The Taliban granted permission for the broadcaster to stay on the airwaves in September, albeit with new curbs.</p>
<p>Radio Begum's 10 or so employees used to share an office with male colleagues who worked on a youth radio station.</p>
<p>Now they are separated. Each sex has its own floor and a large opaque curtain has been installed in front of the women's office.</p>
<p>Pop music has been replaced with traditional songs and "quieter music", Aman said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, staff members said working at the station was a "privilege", with many women government workers barred from returning to offices.</p>
<p>The Taliban have yet to formalise many of their policies, leaving gaps in how they are implemented by the group across the country.</p>
<p>Most public secondary schools for girls have been shut since the takeover.</p>
<p>But twice a day the radio studio resembles a classroom.</p>
<p>When AFP visited, six girls and three boys - all aged 13 or 14 - pored over their books as the presenter gave an on-air lesson about social justice.</p>
<p>"Social justice is opposed to extremism," said the 19-year-old teacher, a student of journalism until a few months ago.</p>
<p>"What is justice in Islam?" she asked.</p>
<p>Mursal, a 13-year-old girl, has been going to the studio to study since the Taliban blocked some secondary schools from reopening.</p>
<p>"My message to girls who can't go to school is to listen to our programme carefully, to use this golden chance and opportunity," she said.</p>
<p>"They may not have it again."</p>
<p>There are also on-air lessons for adults.</p>
<p>In one such lesson, station director Saba Chaman, 24, read the autobiography of Michelle Obama in Dari.</p>
<p>She is particularly proud of a show where listeners call in for psychological counselling.</p>
<p>In 2016, just 18 per cent of women in Afghanistan were literate compared with 62 percent of men, according to the former education ministry.</p>
<p>"Women who are illiterate are like blind people," one woman who cannot read said on air.</p>
<p>"When I go to the pharmacy they give me expired medication. If I could read they wouldn't do it."</p>
<p>A few months after the Taliban seized power, Aman met with spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, and told him the radio was "working to give a voice to women".</p>
<p>He was "very encouraging", she said.</p>
<p>But the future is uncertain.</p>
<p>In September, the country's leading independent TV station Tolo News reported that more than 150 outlets had shut over restrictions and financial troubles.</p>
<p>Radio Begum is no longer taking in advertising revenue.</p>
<p>If no funds are received within three months, the voices of these women will disappear from the airwaves of Afghanistan, Chaman said.</p>
<p>"My only cause for hope at the moment is knowing that I'm doing something important in my life to help Afghan women."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> Millions more in Southeast Asia face sea level rise risks than previously thought: Satellite imagery study </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jack Board </a> </div> </div>
<p>BANGKOK: Huge swathes of land are closer to sea level across Southeast Asia than previously realised, highlighting the flood dangers faced by millions, according to a new study using advanced satellite imagery.</p>
<p>Past coastal flood risk assessments and projections have been let down by a lack of accuracy in satellite radar data that measures land elevation levels. </p>
<p>However, researchers from Dutch-based research institute Deltares were able to perform the first global elevation model using new satellite Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, providing a more accurate picture.</p>
<p>“If the assumed land elevation is too high, the resulting calculated flood risk is too low,” he told CNA.</p>
<p>As a result, in Indonesia, the land area below 2m detected by LiDAR is more than 14 times what was previously thought, compared to the more commonly used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. </p>
<p>In Thailand, the amount is about five times SRTM estimates, and seven times in the Philippines.</p>
<p>These figures can vary at a local level, the researchers stressed, where more precise data can help planning officials reduce flooding risks.</p>
<p>BURDEN FALLS ON TROPICAL ASIA</p>
<p>The researchers found that the “burden of current coastal flood risk and future sea level rise falls disproportionately on tropical regions, especially in Asia”.</p>
<p>The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change expects sea level rise to be 0.8m, possibly by 2100, and extreme flooding events that used to happen once in 100 years could occur every year by the end of the century.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary - Rising sea levels and sinking land are hitting big cities but the solution is far from simple</a></h3>
<p>If a sea level rise of 1m does eventuate, densely populated areas of major deltas will be underwater. Some 129 million globally would live at high risk of permanent flooding by the sea.</p>
<p>“We knew the numbers would be high, as we see flooded and nearly flooded land along many coastlines. But to find two-thirds of the lands and people most at risk in developing tropical countries was more than we expected,” Hooijer said.</p>
<p>“The numbers for Asia are especially large. It could be said that half the global coastal flooding problem is in tropical Asia alone – a bit more by population, less by area,” he said.</p>
<p>That does not account for any growth of population or movement of people towards coastal areas, making those estimates conservative, according to Hooijer. “Many scientists believe coastal populations will keep increasing,” he said.</p>
<p>The impact could be severe in major cities, coastal communities and agricultural heartlands. Large areas might become uninhabitable and unproductive, cascading pressures onto food systems, congested urban developments and economic systems.</p>

<p>“Climate change impact is not only an environmental problem. It devastates the economy and, as a result, will create nationwide social problems,” said Tata Mustasya, Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s regional climate and energy campaign strategist.</p>
<p>“Millions of vulnerable people live in the flooding areas. They will be displaced and lose their livelihoods.” </p>

<p>BANGKOK: A new survey on Southeast Asians’ attitudes and perceptions of climate change reveals genuine concerns among respondents about the crisis but pessimism around whether regional governments are doing enough to tackle it.</p>
<p>Seventy per cent of those surveyed said they believe climate change is a serious and immediate threat to the well-being of their country.</p>
<p>But only 15.7 per cent believes that their government considers climate change an urgent national priority and has allocated sufficient resources to address this threat. </p>
<p>Yet only just over 15 per cent overall thought that their government had seized on the chance to use COVID-19 stimulus money to contribute to a green recovery. </p>
<p>Recent separate analysis from ISEAS showed that regional governments were missing the opportunity to weave green components into their recoveries, while keeping many harmful subsidies to high polluting industries.</p>
<p>“Deep decarbonisation, economic transformation does not happen overnight. Political will is needed,” she said.</p>
<p>According to the survey, those from Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam felt that the main government priority should be to encourage businesses to adopt green practices. </p>
<p>Singapore-based respondents thought the main government priorities should be to allocate more public financial support to low-carbon solutions as well as to encourage businesses to adopt green practices. </p>
<p>In Myanmar, there was an overwhelming call for the enactment of climate laws.</p>
<p>Throughout the region, the looming threats of worsening disasters are a concern, the survey shows.</p>
