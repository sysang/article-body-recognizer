<div><div>Correction</div><p> A previous version of the story had the incorrect name for the body of water homes have waterfront access to. It is Little Hunting Creek, not Little Huntington Creek. </p></div>
<div><div><p>Sara Kirstein recently made a new friend in Wessynton, a neighborhood in Fairfax County, Va. — a beaver who greeted her down by the community dock.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After moving to the neighborhood just off of Mount Vernon Highway in early 2019, Kirstein has enjoyed the melding of midcentury modern houses and the tranquility of the area.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The neighborhood is lovely for walking around,” she said. “We have a wooded nature trail that is very short so we like to go on a lot of walks.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While Kirstein gushed about the sense of community, which included resident-planned Fourth of July pool parties and haunted Halloween forests, her partner, Alejandro Silva, was drawn to Wessynton because of the style of homes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He loves the clean lines, the big windows and the type of floor plan,” Kirstein said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This neighborhood of 156 midcentury modern houses was designed by Nicholas Pappas of Deigert and Yerkes. Five styles of houses were created in symbiosis with the woodland areas that encase the neighborhood.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To maintain the mid-century modern design, the Wessynton Architectural Review Committee was founded. While changes have been made to the homes over the years, the neighborhood retains its harmony.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ely has lived in Wessynton for 33 of its 54 years and likens the neighborhood to being on a permanent vacation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“During the pandemic, it was such a blessing because we were in our little cocoon,” she said.</p></div></div>
<p>Ely enjoyed being able to get out and see her neighbors without fear because of their spacious neighborhood. A favorite spot is the Wessynton Forest, a 20-acre space for contemplation and exercise shrouded in the nature that inspired Pappas.</p>
<div><div><p>Her best memories of Wessynton include her dogs. Ely had a Shih Tzu named Bubbles who was known to the community.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We would walk Bubbles and everyone knew Bubbles and Bubbles knew everybody; she would stop for cars,” Ely said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Her new dog, Callie, gets the same attention as Bubbles once did. This welcoming community has kept Ely, Bubbles and now Callie walking around the neighborhood.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s a really tranquil wooded area that does have a homeowners association, and they’ve really tried to keep that wooded, natural feel to it,” said real estate agent Rebecca McCullough of McEnearney Associates.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The neighborhood has a pool, tennis courts, a playground, a community clubhouse and the Wessynton woods. The HOA fees are $943 annually.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wessynton has a community dock accessible to those who live in the neighborhood, but there are also 23 homes that have waterfront access to portions of the Little Hunting Creek, according to Wisniewski.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since the start of 2021, seven houses have been sold. The average sale price was $865,200. No houses are for sale, and one sale is pending.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>According to Rebecca McCullough, the highest priced house to sell was $1.392 million and had five bedrooms and three bathrooms. The lowest priced was also a five-bedroom house with three bathrooms that sold for $678,000.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Schools: </b>Woodley Hill Elementary, Whitman Middle and Mount Vernon High.</p></div></div>
<p><b>Transit: </b>The nearest Metro station is more than 15 minutes from the neighborhood. The Fairfax Connector offers bus service across Mount Vernon Highway. The George Washington Memorial Parkway and Richmond Highway are close to the neighborhood.</p>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Real Estate</a></div></div><div><h1>Brightwood is on the verge of change</h1></div><h2>The Walter Reed development brings new attention and higher housing prices to the Northwest D.C. neighborhood </h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Michael Loria</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The development has already driven up housing prices, according to Henderson. He first noticed the market impact of the development two years ago. Since 2019, the median home price has increased from $610,000 to $689,000.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s hard pressed to have a bad sale in [Brightwood] and that’s directly a result of the development,” Henderson said. “Values are really picking up.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Homes now sell for more than $1 million regularly. In 2019, only one home sold for more than $1 million. In 2021, 14 homes sold for more than $1 million.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Wessynton has serene places, tranquil spaces surrounded by history</p></div>
<div><div><p>Henderson and his family moved to Brightwood in 2012. For the kids it was “perfection,” Henderson said. “We’re literally in between two playgrounds.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some worry the Walter Reed development will make Brightwood too expensive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For me, that’s going to be an issue,” Tesfaye Lencho said. “I’m not young. I’m 68. I’m on Social Security now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Who doesn’t want to live here?” Lencho said. “It’s an ideal place to be honest with you.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Budding families and camaraderie in North Bethesda’s Old Georgetown Village</p></div>
<p>Brightwood is more diverse than nearby Manor Park or Shepherd Park. Amharic and Spanish can often be heard. Brightwood Community Association president Monica Goletiani attributes the diversity to the neighborhood’s broad housing options.</p>
<div><div><p>“Because there is a housing type that you can afford,” Goletiani said, “anyone could live here.”</p></div></div>
<a>Jackson</a> who moved to the neighborhood in 1989.
<div><div><p>Goletiani, who has lived in Brightwood for 20 years, understands the concerns about the Walter Reed development but trusts Brightwood can stand up for itself.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Small pieces of preservation have made a big difference,” Goletiani said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We managed to preserve this for so many,” Goletiani said. “Little kids, elderly people, everybody uses the triangle.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The plot proved a boon when city parks, like the adjacent Fort Stevens, closed during the <a>coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But homes selling for more than $1 million can change the character of a neighborhood. Henderson, like others, hopes they can meet Brightwood on its own terms.</p></div></div>
<p>“It’ll be interesting to see how we transition once everything is completely walkable,” he said. “You want people who want to integrate into a neighborhood and be there, and not be there waiting for it to change.”</p>
<div><p><b>Living there:</b> According to the Brightwood Community Association, the neighborhood is bounded by Aspen Street to the north, Georgia Avenue to the east, Missouri Avenue and Military Road to the south, and Rock Creek Park to the west.</p></div>

<div><p>The yellow clapboard house in Georgetown is best known as the house where Julia Child taught cooking classes and tested recipes for the cookbook “Mastering the Art of French Cooking.” But it is notable for other reasons.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s one of the few houses left after gentrification turned the area [that was] owned by a Black family,” said Rory Veevers-Carter, who bought the house in 2015.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h4>Distinguished homes for sale in the D.C. region</h4><div><div><div><div>Share</div></div></div></div></div><div><div>View Photos</div></div></div></div></div>
<div><p>Julia Child Slept Here: ‘Big Garland’ was key addition at on Olive Street home</p></div>
<div><p>Julia Child’s D.C. home had lost its luster. But it’s getting ready to sparkle again.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The state of the house didn’t deter Veevers-Carter who had been searching for a fixer-upper in Georgetown.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t do [remodeling] professionally, but I enjoy doing it,” he said. “This house, I built it for myself, built it the way I wanted it because I was going to be living here.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Veevers-Carter worked with architect Dale Overmyer on the renovation, but “95 percent of it was designed as I went along,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The floating stairs, which replaced the spiral stairs, was one inspiration that came to him along the way. The wood on the stairs was reclaimed from the house.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even though the house has gone through several renovations over the years, Veevers-Carter said he did his best to preserve its character. The floors, which had to be replaced because of rot, are rustic white oak.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I had them cross-sawn, which is an older way of sawing, which gives you that feeling that this is an old cut,” he said. “I was trying to keep the history of the house as much as I could.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I really wanted that as your entertainment space,” Veevers-Carter said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The paint wasn’t Veevers-Carter’s only find. When he excavated the lowest level to create more living space, he uncovered several interesting relics that he offered to a D.C. archaeological program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By digging down about 15 feet, Veevers-Carter turned a small mechanical room under the kitchen into another floor with a den, a laundry room and a pink marble-tiled hammam (steam room).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The renovation took longer than expected. The permitting process alone dragged on for three years. But in the end, the house has gone from eyesore to eye-catching.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The three-bedroom, four-bathroom, 3,150-square-foot house is listed at $3.5 million.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Before this 1911 bungalow was built in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Northwest Washington, the developer modified the original plan for a Sears kit house. And it has continued to evolve over the years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This house was marketed as No. 151, later known as the Avondale model. It was described in the catalogue as “a fine example of a modern bungalow.” The design was hugely popular and was sold from 1909 to 1924.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Julian “Pete” MacDonald, who has owned the house since 1992, marvels at the extra finishes Kite added to the house.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Avondale was designed as a one-level house. MacDonald hired architect Nicholas Gerachis to increase the living space by turning the attic into a second floor and enlarging the basement to create a rental apartment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gerachis “was a master at taking an older house, keeping the feel and spirit of the original, but making changes,” MacDonald said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gerachis also added a deck off the kitchen. MacDonald’s wife, Allen, filled the terraced backyard with a profusion of plant species.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“She wanted to design a garden that would have blossoming all year,” MacDonald said.</p></div></div>
<p>MacDonald said he and his wife would spend summer evenings out on the deck, basking in the serene oasis despite being less than a block from busy Connecticut Avenue. In the winter, they spent their evenings in front of the wood-burning fireplace.</p>
<div><div><p>The four-bedroom, three-bathroom, 3,450-square-foot house is listed at just under $1.5 million.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>What drew Howard Forman to Prospect Hill, a circa 1854 house in McLean, Va., was not its rich history. The attraction was more practical. Prospect Hill had a detached three-car garage with living space above it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“At the time, [the house’s history] was not a factor at all,” Forman said. “It was that it had the space over the garage, and we needed the space.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Forman and his wife, Lee Forman, needed the space because they wanted to use it for a museum for the bags that Lee collected for 40 years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I retired in 1999,” he said. “In 2001, my late wife convinced me that we needed to start a museum of bags.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>In a McLean condo, thousands of bags tell the history of America</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h4>Distinguished homes for sale in the D.C. region</h4><div><div><div><div>Share</div></div></div></div></div><div><div>View Photos</div></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We started looking for a home, a place where we could store the bags and use the bags and do what we needed to do,” Forman said. “Prospect Hill met that requirement with the room over the garage.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We launched the website [for the museum] at the beginning of February 2007, and at the end of the month, she found out she had cancer,” Forman said. “She fought it for two years and lost.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After Lee died, Forman’s enthusiasm for the bags waned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I worked at it a little bit but not real excited, because it was her thing, not mine,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When the University of Akron in Ohio expressed interest, Forman happily donated the Lee L. Forman Bag Collection to its Institute for Human Science and Culture in 2019.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after the Formans bought Prospect Hill, they started to learn about its past.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Although the property was broken up over the years, the house remained in the Carper family until the 1960s. George Wallace Carper, who ran a successful dairy farm there, was the last Carper to own the land before it was developed.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The property includes a tennis court, a children’s playhouse and a smokehouse that dates from the 1800s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The six-bedroom, nine-bathroom, 6,840-square-foot house, on 2.83 acres, is listed at just under $3.3 million.</p></div></div>

<p>While just 9.61 percent of mortgage loans in 2020 were Federal Housing Administration loans, which are insured by the FHA to protect lenders, 83.1 percent of FHA borrowers were first-time home buyers, according to the agency’s annual report.</p>
<div><div><p>FHA loans are not limited to first-time buyers, but they appeal to new entrants into the housing market for several reasons.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“FHA loans are attractive for first-time buyers because they’re easier to qualify for,” says Joe Shalaby, CEO of E Mortgage Capital in Santa Ana, Calif.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You can qualify with a lower credit score and make a down payment of just 3.5 percent with a 580 FICO score. Conventional loans require a credit score of 740 to qualify for a low down payment loan.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>A guide to financing options for first-time home buyers</p></div>
<div><div><p>Other benefits of an FHA loan compared with conventional financing include the increased ability to have co-borrowers on the loan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“FHA allows several buyers per transaction, including non-occupying co-borrowers,” Shalaby says. “We sometimes see three or four co-borrowers on a loan, especially with first-time buyers.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Your credit score will determine how expensive the monthly mortgage insurance premium will be with a conventional mortgage, so first-time buyers often choose FHA loans when their credit score is below 700,” May says.</p></div>
<div><p>BOA expands down-payment assistance program for home buyers with moderate incomes</p></div>
<div><div><p>FHA borrowers must pay an upfront mortgage insurance premium of 1.75 percent of the loan, plus a fixed monthly mortgage insurance of 0.85 percent of the loan.</p></div></div>
<p>For borrowers with a credit score of 700 or higher, the mortgage insurance premium on a conventional loan, which varies according to several factors, might be 0.68 percent, May says. In that case, a conventional loan would be the better option.</p>
<div><div><p>But borrowers with a credit score between 620 and 680 could have a private mortgage insurance premium as high as 1.69 percent, which would make the FHA loan the better option.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Disadvantages of FHA loans</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>“Conventional loans require less mortgage insurance,” Shalaby says. “In addition, borrowers have the option of lender-paid mortgage insurance, which wraps the insurance into the loan with a slightly higher rate.”</p></div>
<p>One more disadvantage of an FHA loan is that FHA appraisals are stricter than those required for conventional loans, May says. Buyers purchasing a fixer-upper may have a harder time qualifying for an FHA loan unless they opt for a renovation loan.</p>

<div><h1>How a low credit score can be costly when buying a home</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Francis Creighton</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>September 20, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Every Thursday morning, Freddie Mac (the Federal Loan Home Mortgage Corporation) publishes a survey of mortgage rates giving potential buyers a sense of the range they could be looking at when purchasing a house.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This data is a baseline guide for someone considering a new home purchase. But just because the analysis reports a specific rate doesn’t mean that’s the rate you will be offered.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s how to better understand the rate and how to use it:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What’s in a mortgage rate?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mortgage rates are based on two main factors: (1) how much it would cost the lender to acquire the funds you need to buy your home and (2) the risk you represent.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Creighton: Four things first-time home buyers should know about their credit</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Are you a risky investment?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>First, the lender gauges your ability to afford the loan. This assessment is typically based on a variety of factors, including your credit score, size of down payment and income, to name a few.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What’s the true impact of a risk premium?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Borrowers with not-so-perfect credit may be eligible for FHA home loans</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>So what can a prospective home buyer do?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>There are several important steps to take:</p></div></div>
<li>If you have high balances on any of your credit cards, consider paying them down — you generally don’t want any credit card to have more than 30 percent of your total credit available being used.</li>
<li>Keep paying your bills — a missed payment, especially a recent one, can really hurt your credit score. Be vigilant about your budget in the months leading up to your application, prioritizing those essential bills.</li>
<div><div><p>Ultimately, your mortgage rate will influence your purchase — viability, cost, location, size and more. Being mindful of your credit score isn’t a one-time exercise, but rather an ongoing practice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The more you are in tune with your credit and the factors affecting it, the more you can take steps to improve your credit and your mortgage options the next time you buy a home.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Michele Lerner</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>March 25, 2021 at 7:59 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<p>Purchasing a home in the Washington region is tougher than ever with more buyers in the market seeking to take advantage of historically low mortgage rates and fewer properties for sale — particularly in the $300,000 to $500,000 range.</p>
<div><div><p>But it’s not impossible. For Jason Spear and his wife Domonique Williams, like others who managed to find a house within their means, it meant making trade-offs and stretching their budget a little.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When the couple started looking for their first home in November 2019, they obtained a preapproval from a lender and contacted Ericka S. Black, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker Realty.</p></div></div>
<div><p>New app provides plethora of information for first-time home buyers and owners</p></div>
<div><div><p>Spear and Williams spent about five months looking for a home and ended up widening their location search and increasing their budget to become homeowners.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The couple purchased a 2,200-square-foot single-family home in Suitland, Md., with four bedrooms and three full bathrooms, each with a bathtub, for $339,900. The house also has a fireplace, a garage and a backyard.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In addition, Black helped Spear and Williams recognize that buying a single-family home meant the couple did not have to add condominium or homeowners association dues to their budget.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Financial preparation </div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mickel Rambus, 37, a move-up buyer, worked with Darnell Eaton, a real estate agent with Century 21 New Millennium, to find a larger home that met her requirements.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It has a balcony, a nice kitchen and even a garage,” she says. “I got more space than I needed and I can walk to a grocery store. I compromised because it’s not near Metro, but it’s near a bus stop.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Rambus says she preferred visiting homes by appointment when she was searching, instead of during an open house where she might be distracted by other buyers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I can be loud and obnoxious sometimes, but I want to live in a place that’s quiet and comfortable and still be able to get to where other people are,” says Rambus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Taking your own advice</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Will Hirzy, 30, and his wife, Katie Bishop, 27, didn’t have to look far for a real estate agent when they became first-time buyers: Hirzy has been a real estate agent with Redfin for five years.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How Biden’s proposed tax credit could help — and hurt — first-time home buyers</p></div>
<div><div><p>The couple’s budget was $400,000 and they hoped to keep their mortgage payment close to their rent payment.</p></div></div>
<p>Hirzy and Bishop looked at homes for about one month before they purchased their home. At first, they looked for less costly homes that needed some renovation but decided that while they are both working at home a remodel would be too disruptive.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Flexibility and patience</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Judy and Jack Mark, retired doctors who moved to Florida from Long Island two years ago, the pandemic led to a major life decision to buy a second home in the D.C. area.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Marks consulted Suzanne Parmet, a real estate agent with Compass, to explore their options with a budget of $300,000 or less.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Eventually, the couple chose a two-bedroom condo in Leisure World in Silver Spring, Md., with 1,300 square feet and a large terrace that cost $329,000, including the furniture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Judy says that their agent’s neighborhood knowledge was valuable since they are not as familiar with Maryland.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What helped us stay close to our budget is that we were really flexible,” says Judy. “When what we thought we wanted wasn’t available, we adjusted our priorities to what was available.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Practicality</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Home remodeling projects that will bring you the most return on investment</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Lauers were in a bidding war for their townhouse with seven other prospective buyers.</p></div></div>
<p>“We offered $320,000 and an escalation clause, so we got the house for $328,000,” says Braun Lauer. “We waived the contingencies and just had a ‘take it or leave it’ home inspection after our offer was accepted.”</p>
<div><div><p>Braun Lauer, a stay-at-home mother, has a side business selling handmade stationery that she now runs from a studio in the basement of the 1,600-square-foot three-bedroom, three-bathroom townhouse.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Location over condition</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Carrie Banachowski, a 58-year-old business manager for the Girl Scouts in D.C., calls herself a “serial mover.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Banachowski waited for the house to go on the market because she felt that was fair to the family.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Banachowski says she will eventually do more upgrades, but for now she is thrilled that when she goes into her office occasionally her commute has been cut in half.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Extra cash sealed the deal</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Patrick Lee, a 31-year-old software salesman, and his partner, Katie Peters, a 32-year-old quality assurance specialist, the desire to move out of their separate rental homes was accelerated by her pregnancy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C. down payment assistance program seeks to expand access to more borrowers</p></div>
<span> [Va.]</span> for $456,000, $16,000 over the asking price.”
<div><div><p>The compromises that buyers must make in a tight housing market include accepting homes that have not been updated, purchasing in a less desirable location or buying a smaller home than planned, says Parmet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Besides being financially prepared, the best qualities buyers today can have are patience and persistence.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div> Tips for buying an affordable house in a tight market</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>●● Pick the right real estate agent: Interview several and choose one who listens, knows the market and has good relationships with lenders and other agents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Be prepared financially and with a preapproval before you shop for a home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Be flexible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Know your must-have priorities and nice-to-have features.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Consider a pre-offer home inspection or a post-offer inspection that allows you to walk away if necessary but not to ask the sellers to fix items.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Be ready to move quickly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Try to put all your spending on hold in the months leading up to your purchase so you have more cash saved.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Have your cash on hand for your deposit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Be ready for a possible bidding war with your upper spending limit and an understanding of what it means to waive contingencies.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Surprised by what the government says your home is worth? Here’s how to file an appeal on your property taxes.</h1></div>
<h2>Making a case includes collecting the right data, spotting errors in descriptions and meeting a filing deadline</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Haisten Willis</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 30, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>With prices changing so quickly, how do you know if your assessment is accurate? And if you’re sure the estimate is higher than what your home could actually sell for, is there anything you can do about it?</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The assessment process</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Though the assessment process varies from state to state and county to county, the basics generally remain the same.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Your property taxes are set in part by the millage rate, which represents the amount per every $1,000 of a property's assessed value that owners pay. The other factor is, of course, how much the property is worth.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Black families pay significantly higher property taxes than white families, new analysis shows</p></div>
<div><div><p>If your home sold within the last year, that’s easy — it’s worth the sale price. If not, local assessors will estimate the value.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Assessors typically can’t visit every house in their city or county every year, so they also use oblique photography or geographic information systems (GIS) to fill in the gaps.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because assessments are usually handled at the hyperlocal level, there is no national database of appraisal values. However, you can get that information from your local government by visiting its website.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Things are handled a little differently depending on where you live. One major exception to the rule is California, which bases property taxes on a home’s last sales price even if that sale took place decades ago.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Appealing your assessment</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>And those deadlines are no joke.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How you can prevent buyer’s remorse</p></div>
<div><div><p>She said most homeowners aren’t familiar with the appeal process or how it works.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the District, homeowners can request comparable sales — a key data point in any assessment — and the worksheet the D.C. government used to estimate your home’s value.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another key is to be realistic about what you argue the home is worth rather than simply shooting for the lowest number possible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“More people would have success if they aimed for actual market value, rather than trying to get below that,” said Milligan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How hard is it to file an appeal?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Paying off your mortgage? The property taxes and homeowners insurance are now on you.</p></div>
<div><div><p>DeTurris said finding three comparable properties that the city or county assessed at a lower value than yours is usually enough to make a convincing argument, provided you include documentation to back up your claim.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Appeals can also be made for errors in property description — for example if an assessment says your home has four bedrooms when it only has three.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Use the exact assessors’ data against them,” said DeTurris. “Using concrete data that you can point to is probably the best path to take.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>McHenry stressed that assessors welcome the appeal process and are glad to have a check on their work.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other than the time involved, there’s little risk in filing an appeal. Your property tax assessment can go down if you win, but won’t go up if you lose.</p></div></div>

<a>Federal Housing Administration </a>are the federal government’s premier first-time home buyer program. FHA loans require a 3.5
<div><div><p>Also, sellers can contribute up to 6 percent of the purchase price toward a borrower’s closing expenses. However, mortgage insurance is required for the life of the loan.</p></div></div>
<a><b>VA loans</b></a>, which are designed for individuals who have served our country in the armed forces, are a good option for those who are eligible because buyers can finance 100 percent of the purchase price without requiring mortgage insurance.
<div><div><p><b><a>Freddie Mac’s Home Possible</a> </b>loan program and <a><b>Fannie Mae’s HomeReady </b></a>loan program allow for a down payment as low as 3 percent and reduced private mortgage insurance (PMI).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are some examples:</p></div></div>
<a><b>Bank of America</b></a>: Bank of America’s

<div><h1>8 important — and overlooked — questions to ask before buying a home</h1></div>
<h2>Rather than focusing on decor, home buyers should learn about neighborhood development, noise levels and weather hazards.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Michele Lerner</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>September 21, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>“We saw lots of listings on different websites, but we wanted to know more about everything from safety ratings to subway lines to whether there was a park with a basketball court,” says Jahangir.</p></div></div>
<p>While buyers often get enticed by quartz counters, wood floors or a pretty backsplash, there are more serious factors that consumers should consider before investing in a home, says Lynn Ikle, a real estate agent with Redfin in Howard County, Md.</p>
<div><div><p>Here’s how you can find out about everything from noise levels, to future development plans for the neighborhood to the home’s infrastructure before you buy:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Will my new place be noisy?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While it may be obvious that you’ll hear noise if you buy a home next to a highway used by trucks, what you’ll hear and when is not always clear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When you visit a home in the daytime, you may not be aware what it’s like at night, particularly in a city environment,” says Omer Granot, president and chief operating officer of Localize in New York.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Localize mapped all the subway routes in New York to see which buildings have a subway traveling underneath.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We can tell you where you’re likely to feel the vibration of the train and how many times a day that will happen,” Granot says.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Am I at risk for floods and fires or from previous uses of this property?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>“The point of these reports is to know whether you’ll have long-term maintenance issues, whether the property is insurable and whether the home value will be impacted by these issues before you make an offer,” says Teta.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Is this a safe neighborhood with good schools?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I always suggest people review county websites for potential school redistricting plans because school assignment boundaries can change,” says Ikle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Consumers can also buy an iHomeReport from Kukun, which costs $39.95 per report and contains a variety of information, including community safety information and maps with the nearest schools and their ratings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Will my view change?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You don’t want to buy a house because of the wooded view and discover two years later that the site is being developed into a shopping center,” she says.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How soon will my appliances and systems need maintenance?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>While some buyers waive their right to a home inspection in order to make a more competitive offer, real estate agents recommend having at least an informational inspection even if you don’t plan to ask the sellers to make repairs.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How much do utilities cost?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Whether you’re moving from a home where utilities are included or significantly increasing your living space, you need to consider utility costs in your housing budget.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some jurisdictions require sellers to provide information to buyers about their utility bills, says Ikle. In other areas, buyers can call the utility company to ask for the 12-month average of electric, water and gas bills.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you’re buying a home with solar panels, ask the sellers whether the panels are leased or owned, says Ikle. You may be taking over a lease that will incur monthly costs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What rules, regulations and fees come with living in an HOA or condo?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Homeowner or condo association fees should be included with the listing information on a property or you can ask the listing agent or seller for that information.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Buyers should review association documents to see if a reserve fund has enough money to avoid special assessments, which could be hundreds or thousands of dollars if a major repair is needed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Association rules are also important to review for items such as whether you can park an RV or boat on the property, run a home-based business or change your paint color.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Some associations are very strict and some are not, so you can ask your real estate agent to find out for you,” says Ikle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Can I rent my home to short- or long-term tenants?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>You can also check local jurisdictions for their rules about property rentals. Some locations ban short-term rentals entirely or only allow them if the homeowner is in residence.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Carisa Crawford Chappell</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 26, 2018</div></div>
<div><div><p>Experts recommend buyers understand the different loan options, including conventional and government mortgages. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some loans are ideal for first-time buyers with a limited budget and little money to put down on a home, while others work better for buyers who have more established credit, disposable income and a hefty down payment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When choosing a lender, John Stevens, board chair of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (NAMB) recommends going to NAMB.org for a list of certified mortgage specialists by state. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Experts say look for the Mortgage Bankers Association’s Certified Mortgage Banker (CMB) designation next to a lender’s name.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stevens said that first-time buyers often overlook taxes, insurance and homeowners association fees, all of which add to their monthly costs. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Don’t become house poor,” he said. “Consider mortgage payments that allow you the flexibility to still make memories with your family.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The mortgage market is now dominated by non-bank lenders</p></div>
<p>An ARM can be a better fit for buyers who plan to move in less than 10 years, because they can take advantage of the initial low rates. But buyers must be aware of how high and how frequently the interest rate and monthly payment can adjust.</p>
<div><div><p><b>Conventional loans </b>account for more than half of new mortgage loans. Many require a down payment of 20 percent, but some programs require less.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The minimum credit score is typically between 620 and 640. Lenders prefer a 36 percent debt-to-income ratio. The maximum DTI for a conventional loan is 43 percent. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since the housing meltdown, it has been more challenging for buyers to qualify for conventional loans. However, some lenders have eased their requirements to help more first-time buyers. </p></div></div>
<div><p>The downside is buyers must pay for mortgage insurance, which adds to the monthly payment. Typical cost is around 1 percent of the payment amount. Mortgage insurance is standard for buyers whose down payment is less than 20 percent.</p></div>
<div><p>All the reasons it’s so much harder to buy a home than it was for your parents</p></div>
<div><div><p>FHA loans allow a higher debt-to-income ratio of 43 percent of gross income. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>VA loans:</b> Veterans Affairs loans benefit military buyers. These loans require no down payment (if the buyer stays below the loan limit) and offer one of the market’s lowest interest rates. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>VA loans do not require mortgage insurance, but borrowers pay a VA funding fee, typically 2.15 percent of the loan amount. Many borrowers finance the fee. </p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>USDA loans:</b> The Agriculture Department’s program, managed by the Rural Housing Service and called the USDA Rural Development loan, is designed for rural borrowers with low or modest income. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To be eligible, borrowers can’t earn more than 115 percent of the median family income for the area. The USDA program doesn’t require a down payment and offers flexible credit criteria. The minimum score is 640.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>USDA loans promote housing opportunities in less popular communities, making it ideal for residents who struggle to obtain conventional financing. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The USDA website can help buyers determine if their prospective property is located in an eligible rural area by entering the home’s address. </p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Susan Straight</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 29, 2018</div></div>
<div><div><p>Buying a home is complicated, expensive and time-consuming. Most buyers and sellers welcome help from a real estate agent to walk them through the process, handle the paperwork and fight any battles that may arise.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since the commission for the buyer’s agent is typically paid by the seller, “it’s penny-wise and pound-foolish for a buyer not to use an agent,” Rubida said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But in an age of Redfin, Zestimates and online contracts, isn’t all the information you need on the Internet? Seriously, why use an agent?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Time, for one thing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As real estate has become more complicated, the value of using an agent has grown.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The hard part is not finding the property, it’s getting through the transaction without a major financial, emotional or procedural error,” Rubida said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Experience and ability vary among agents. How do you find the best one for you?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Pay attention to credentials.</b> Check the agent’s website or business card for his or her license. Search your state’s website for licensing or professional and occupational regulation.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Real estate vocabulary: Words you need to know before buying your first home</p></div>
<div><div><p>A real estate agent has a financial incentive to see the deal go through. Most reputable agents will not let this consideration interfere with the advice they give you. A lawyer has no such incentive. He is paid regardless.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Follow the same advice for hiring a lawyer as you would a real estate agent: Talk to friends, interview several lawyers, and pay attention to credentials.</p></div></div>
