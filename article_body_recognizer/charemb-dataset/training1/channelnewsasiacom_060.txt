<p>To get children to talk, parents should use lots of questions that require children to come up with their own answer rather than simply responding with a “yes” or a “no.”</p>
<p>For example: Who came with you to the party? Where did you go with Grandma? Why were you scared?</p>
<p>Talking about topics that the child cares about can also help parents get children to talk.</p>
<p>To keep the child engaged in the conversation, parents can ask follow-up questions like “And then what happened?” They can also repeat back what the child says.</p>
<p>For example, if the child says “We went to the park,” the parent might respond “That’s right, we went to the park!” and use phrases such as “Uh-huh,” “Oh,” “I didn’t know that” and “Really?” to keep the conversation going.</p>
<h2>4. USE THE LANGUAGE THAT’S MOST COMFORTABLE</h2>
<p>Parents should feel free to talk in the language they know best. Many parents might feel pressured to speak in one language - such as English – at home because this is the language used in school.</p>
<p>However, when parents speak in the language they are most familiar with, they are better able to express their thoughts and feelings while also preserving their culture.</p>
<p>Speaking a native language at home is not detrimental to children’s learning.</p>
<p>When children have strong foundations in one language – such as Spanish – they can use that knowledge as a building block for learning a second language – such as English.</p>
<p>Our research is based primarily on Latino families, who place particular value on family meals.</p>
<p>Latino families tend to eat together more often than families from other ethnicities. They are also more likely to cook at home and involve children in kitchen chores.</p>
<p>However, these tips apply to all families who regularly cook, eat and shop for food together. And they can help busy parents support their young children’s learning without much added burden or spending.</p>

<h1> Start early to keep pigmentation at bay </h1>
<div> <p>Apart from minimising sun exposure, customised preventive care can help you maintain a bright, healthy complexion. Shakura’s celebrity ambassadors Ya Hui and Lawrence Wong share their go-to pigmentation care solution.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Brand Studio </a> </div> </div>
<div><div> <h6> Brought to you by </h6> </div> </div>
<p>Pigmentation – when your skin develops dark spots in the form of melasma, freckles or age spots – is a skin concern that many share.</p>
<p>The good news is, advancements in the field of aesthetics mean that pigmentation does not have to be a permanent problem. </p>
<p>For skincare solutions provider Shakura, which hails from Japan, its pigmentation solutions are customised and formulated to meet individual needs, because everyone’s skin and pigmentation concerns are different. </p>
<p>That is why celebrities Ya Hui and Lawrence Wong believe in Shakura’s skincare solutions, and have collaborated on a new TV commercial with Shakura.</p>
<p>Said Lawrence: “I like Shakura’s customised approach because it helps to target individual concerns using different treatment programmes, and I feel the results are visible after just one session.”</p>
<p>Ya Hui added: “Whether it’s pigmentation or dull skin, Shakura’s formulas are gentle and there are visible results without the need for invasive methods.”</p>
<p>UNDERSTANDING PIGMENTATION TYPES</p>
<p>Once pigmentation appears, it may worsen over time, making it tougher to get rid of.</p>
<p>Taking early action is critical for treating pigmentation before it worsens by darkening or increasing in size. The approach has to be customised as well.</p>
<p>At Shakura, its treatment programme begins with a one-on-one consultation that includes a detailed skin analysis to better understand your skin’s needs as well as determine the cause of pigmentation for optimal results. </p>
<p>“Understanding your pigmentation type is the key to effective treatment,” explained Ms Peh.</p>
<p>Shakura’s Miroko Whitening Treatment is carefully adjusted to best treat each individual’s skin depending on the analysis done. Each treatment is customised primarily on the pigmentation type and skin type of the customer. </p>
<p>Having treated the skin concerns of over 60,000 customers in Singapore since 2011, Shakura’s Miroko Whitening Treatment does not just help treat pigmentation issues. In the long term, it also seeks to boost skin health.</p>
<p>Of course, the key to treating and preventing pigmentation is not just in treatment, but also in an overall approach to keeping skin healthy. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> With sustainable investing on the rise, experts warn of greenwashing risks </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tang See Kit </a> <a> Vanessa Lim </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Three months ago, Ms Wendy Lim invested S$10,000 into a US-listed exchange-traded fund that focused on companies involved in clean energy and conservation.</p>
<p>The possibility of good returns, coupled with lower risks, was the reason she decided to sink her money into this, said the 34-year-old, who has been investing as part of her retirement planning.</p>
<p>Plus, the energy sector holds growth potential and seems less volatile compared to the disruption-prone technology space, she said.</p>
<p>But Ms Lim also wondered if she could make her money work for a greater good.</p>
<p>“I have always been following climate change (issues). Since I’m intending to invest, I might as well invest in a good cause.</p>
<p>“I do believe that sustainable energy is our future, just like technology. The earth has finite resources and it’s only a matter of time that all countries and industries need to make the change.”</p>
<p>Ms Lim is among a burgeoning group of retail investors looking at growing their cash by investing in companies that focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects.</p>
<p>Another consumer study by local lender UOB found that 90 per cent of Singaporeans were keen to find out more about sustainable investing. Of those surveyed, 13 per cent had already made such investments.</p>
<p>DBS said it has seen a steady increase in investments into its two sustainability-themed funds, with fund purchases as of end-September nearly three times higher compared with January. Investors were mostly between 35 and 55 years old.</p>
<p>Given the strong demand, DBS’ head of financial planning, investment and insurance solutions Evy Wee told CNA that the bank plans to bring in more sustainability-themed investment products for customers next year.</p>
<p>Robo-adviser Syfe, which allows clients to choose from five thematic investment portfolios, said that “ESG and clean energy” has been the most popular option, accounting for 40 per cent of the thematic portfolios created so far.</p>
<h2>WHAT’S DRIVING DEMAND?</h2>
<p>To be sure, sustainable investing is not entirely new.</p>
<p>But the trend picked up momentum globally over the past two years amid growing awareness about climate change and sustainability issues, experts said.</p>
<p>The prolonged pandemic, whose impact has caused mindset and value shifts among people, is another reason fuelling more to invest with a conscience.</p>
<p>Investors, particularly the younger ones, are concerned with issues like climate change, said Mr Elson Goh, head of Asia portfolio management at St James’s Place Wealth Management. </p>
<p>“COVID-19 has been a pandemic that has struck the world and that has probably (made people) realise that there are other areas which can have a drastic impact on our lives,” he said.</p>
<p>Some misconceptions about ESG investing include how it entails a compromise on returns. But data has suggested otherwise, industry players said.</p>
<p>DBS pointed to the one-year performance of its sustainability-themed funds, which has been “healthy” at around 30 per cent.</p>
<p>“(Our) portfolio allows investors to tap into significant growth potential tied to the growing importance of ESG factors among companies, as well as the growing importance and urgency of combating climate change,” he added.</p>
<p>“That leads to better decision outcomes within the company, which also means that they are better quality companies in general,” he told CNA.</p>
<h2>THE RISK OF “GREENWASHING”</h2>
<p>But with more looking to invest sustainably, experts warn that there could be a growing risk of so-called “greenwashing” – the act of making false or misleading claims about the environmental merits of a product, service or technology.</p>
<p>UK climate change think tank InfluenceMap studied 723 equity funds specifically marketed using ESG- and climate-related keywords like low carbon, and had more than US$330 billion in total net assets.</p>
<p>More than half of these funds fell short of global sustainability targets laid out in the Paris Agreement, it said.</p>
<p>More than 70 per cent of funds with broader ESG goals were also misaligned with the Paris Agreement’s global climate targets, according to InfluenceMap.</p>
<p>It added that investors may not be able to determine if funds are really what they claim to be, given the wide spectrum of terms used to describe green funds and a lack of transparency when it comes to marketing, the Financial Times reported.</p>
<p>Experts that CNA spoke to also cited the absence of standardised ESG regulations and benchmarks to measure fund performance.</p>
<p>This could make it easy to "greenwash" ESG funds, said Mr Armin Choksey, who leads PwC Singapore’s Asia-Pacific asset and wealth management market research centre.</p>
<p>He added that such funds tend to have confusing and overlapping terminology, as well as generic names like “socially conscious”.</p>
<p>Professor Sumit Agarwal from the National University of Singapore’s Business School pointed out the risk that comes with the lack of a standardised measurement to calculate companies’ green or sustainability score.</p>
<p>“We just have to take their word for it."</p>
<p>Mr Choksey said the development of standardised regulations and labelling guidelines for funds would help ensure retail investors are better informed about ESG investments and the associated risks.</p>
<p>Steps are already being taken in the region. In Hong Kong, the Securities and Futures Commission maintains a central database of all authorised ESG funds and allows access to this database through its website.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Financial Supervisory Commission in Taiwan laid out its first set of formal criteria and disclosure requirements for onshore funds claiming an ESG label.</p>
<p>Back home, the Singapore Exchange will start requiring companies to provide climate reporting on a "comply or explain" basis in their sustainability reports from financial year 2022.</p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore has said it will announce new disclosure standards for retail funds in Singapore with an ESG investment objective by early next year.</p>
<p>The goal is to help investors better understand the criteria that an ESG fund uses to select investments and be able to obtain more information on the investment process.</p>
<p>Other efforts are also under way, such as the establishment of a new Sustainable and Green Finance Institute by the National University of Singapore to drive green finance education and research.</p>
<p>The latter is likely to take three to four years.</p>
<p>Firms in some Asian countries are "big culprits" of greenwashing and duping investors, he said.</p>
<p>With a measurement that is transparent, "we can hold them more accountable, and then the investor will make more informed decisions”.</p>
<h2> How to start investing sustainably </h2>
<p>Knowledge is key, so find out what sustainable investing is all about before putting dollars behind it.</p>
<p>For a start, read the sustainability reports issued by companies you are investing in, said Securities Investors Association Singapore founder David Gerald.</p>
<p>There are also several misconceptions surrounding ESG, such as how it is a mere “passing fad”. Some investors also see ESG as a new asset class but it serves more as an approach to investing.</p>
<p>“Effective sustainable investing should use traditional financial analysis, along with ESG factors, to arrive at investment decisions,” said Ms Evy Wee from DBS.</p>
<p>Just because the world is moving towards ESG investing does not mean it is risk-free. Always invest based on your risk appetite, investment horizons and goals, said Mr Gerald.</p>
<p>Syfe’s Mr Sieber advised investors to decide what matters most to them, given how there are three metrics within ESG and each having “wide-ranging” definitions.</p>
<p>“Find what aligns with your beliefs and your values before investing,” he said. “Is it environmental factors or are you most concerned about issues (about) corporate governance such as executive pay?”</p>
<h2>UNDERSTAND THE STRATEGIES</h2>
<p>Picking the right investment strategy is also crucial.</p>
<p>Don't over-invest in one company or investment product, he added.</p>
<p>ETFs, according to Mr Sieber, is an efficient way for investors to spread their risks across companies, sectors and geographies.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Big Oil is banking on plastics boom to make up for climate-related losses </h1>
<div> <p>The plastics we use every day are produced on such a large incomprehensible scale, we live in an era best labelled the “plasticene”, says two researchers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Fredric Bauer </a> <a> Tobias Dan Nielsen </a> </div> </div>
<p>LUND, Sweden: Visiting a modern petrochemical plant makes you feel incredibly small. </p>
<p>Enormous compressors roar incessantly, distillation columns tower high, large pipelines full of oil and gas criss-cross the site. </p>
<p>Heat radiates from inspection hatches in furnaces in which hydrocarbons are heated to 850 degrees Celsius to make the molecules crack. It’s easy to get lost in alleys of ducts and pipes, which to an untrained eye, all look the same.</p>
<p>Large tankers moor at the quay to unload cargoes of oil and gas and trucks leave at the other end, filled with plastic pellets. </p>
<p>Tall chimneys release large plumes of flue gases from burning gas and unwanted by-products, using the energy to run processes at the plant. </p>
<p>At night, a flare watches like a bright eye. This is where gases are combusted in case of an emergency or unexpected shutdown of parts of the plant. It’s always burning with a small flame.</p>
<p>The plastics we use every day are produced at such facilities on an almost incomprehensible scale. A scale so large some suggest we now live in an era best labelled the “plasticene”.</p>
<p>And as the climate crisis worsens, plastics production at plants like these is ballooning. Modern lifestyles and practices are intimately entwined with the use of plastics. </p>
<p>Our phones, computers, food packaging, clothes and even renewable energy technologies, such as wind turbine blades and cables connecting them to the power grid, are all, to a large extent, made from plastics.</p>
<p>This means plastic demand is likely to grow for decades to come – not least in developing countries, which will account for the bulk of future demand growth. </p>
<p>In 1950, global production of plastic was estimated to be a mere 2 million tonnes (Mt). In 2015 this had grown to 380 Mt, and along a business-as-usual trajectory it will reach 1,606 Mt by 2050.</p>
<p>Unless mitigated, this growth will also incur a substantial increase in global greenhouse gas emissions – from 1.7 billion tonnes (Gt) of CO2-equivalent in 2015, to 6.5 Gt by 2050. </p>
<p>Why? Because the raw materials behind plastics and other petrochemicals are fossil fuels. </p>
<p>We have long argued climate impacts of plastics and petrochemicals production are neglected, as the debate so far mainly focuses on later stages of plastic life cycles. </p>
<p>More recently, we investigated major plastics producers and their investments likely to increase the production of fossil-based virgin plastics around the world. </p>
<p>The 12 largest petrochemical companies cumulatively announced 88 new projects for production capacity increase and infrastructure expansion between 2012 and 2019. </p>
<p>This is indicative of a global trend of increasing investments in the chemical industry, with available data for key regions showing total investments more than doubled from 2007 to 2019, reaching levels we estimate have not been seen before.</p>
<p>These new expanded facilities will operate for decades once they are opened, adding to current greenhouse gas emissions of the chemical industry – already the third largest of all industries.</p>
<h2>PETROCHEMICAL PLANTS OF THE FUTURE</h2>
<p>On the small island of Yushan in Zhejiang, China, one such new mega-plant is currently being built. The mountain peaks have been flattened and the island expanded into the sea by so much you can no longer recognise its shape. </p>
<p>All this to make way for a gigantic industrial site: Zhejiang Petrochemical Company’s somewhat perversely named Green Petrochemical Base.</p>
<p>The new site is a fully integrated petroleum refinery and petrochemical production facility. Previously, these processes have typically been in separate facilities and sometimes on different continents.</p>
<p>It will have the capacity to process 800,000 barrels of crude oil per day - enough to fill 50 Olympic-size swimming pools - making it one of the largest refineries in the world. </p>
<p>Most of its chemical products will be common plastics, such as polyethylene for flexible packaging and key petrochemical building block molecules for the production of polyester fibres for textiles.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang project is indicative of a trend as oil and gas companies increasingly look to plastics and other petrochemicals as progressively important markets. </p>
<p>“The future of oil is in chemicals, not fuels,” as a headline in a trade press journal describes it. Our investigations indicate this future is fast approaching.</p>
<p>We spent the last year collecting data about recent projects from trade press as well as information released by the firms, cross-referencing to identify unique projects. </p>
<p>Two key trends emerged in our analysis: The move towards primarily using oil for plastics and chemicals rather than petrol, and the explosive growth in demand for United States ethane, a byproduct from shale gas produced through fracking.</p>
<p>The first trend is most manifest in China and the Asia-Pacific, where industry experts estimate 70 to 80 per cent of new refining capacity in the next five years will be plastics-focused. </p>
<p>The almost insatiable demand for plastics in the Chinese manufacturing industry – producing plastic car parts, cell phones, and textiles for use both domestically and abroad – has also spurred Western chemical firms to make record investments. </p>
<p>The world’s largest chemicals company BASF is investing US$10 billion in a new site in China – the largest investment ever for the company.</p>
<p>As US ethane production has soared following the shale gas boom, so have the investments in ethane-based plastics production facilities as well as other chemicals produced from shale gas.</p>
<p>With new technology being developed for exporting ethane overseas, this trend quickly diffused to Europe. Adding new export terminals in the US has also recently allowed the export to reach both India and China.</p>
<h2>SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PLASTICS AND FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRIES</h2>
<p>To understand the modern plastics and petrochemical industries of today, we must look to the past. </p>
<p>The modern chemical industry has a long tradition of close connections to the fossil fuel industry. It goes back to the mid-19th century when the first synthetic dyestuffs and other early industrial chemicals were produced from coal tars.</p>
<p>Coal remained the main source of raw materials and energy for chemicals for a century and also for the first synthetic plastics, such as Bakelite.</p>
<p>In the mid-20th century, it was clear change was coming, but in the years following World War II the direction remained uncertain. </p>
<p>But in the 1950s, the industry went a different way, as breakthroughs US firms made in petroleum processing during the war quickly spread around the globe with the help of re-industrialisation aid schemes such as the Marshall plan.</p>
<p>For more than 150 years, the chemical and fossil fuel industries have fostered a particularly special relationship.</p>
<p>Other firms started by producing plastics and chemicals before acquiring oil and gas infrastructure, such as INEOS and Reliance.</p>
<p>Although several bio-based plastics have been developed, they still make up less than 1 per cent of the market, which is still completely dominated by fossil-based plastics.</p>
<h2>PLASTICS SUFFER FROM CARBON LOCK-IN</h2>
<p>Plastics therefore suffer from a severe case of “carbon lock-in” – a dependence on fossil fuel resources continually reinforced through technology, infrastructure, institutions and behaviour.</p>
<p>The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recently warned irreversible effects of intensifying climate change are imminent and agreed targets of limiting global warming to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius are soon beyond reach. </p>
<p>At this point in time, all sectors of the global economy ought to be on track to reduce use of fossil fuel resources, especially the most energy and emissions-intensive industries, including cement, steel and chemicals.</p>
<p>From energy efficiency improvements and switching to renewable energy to improving circularity and recycling, there are plenty of opportunities for the industry to invest in solutions for a cleaner environment, as identified by the IEA. </p>
<p>Yet only very few of the plastics and chemical firms have set emission reductions targets aligned with the Paris agreement.</p>
<p>There is increasing awareness of the dangers of plastic pollution. Countries, civil society and businesses are all calling for a global treaty to end marine plastic pollution. And many would like to see a more circular economy for plastics. </p>
<p>It’s particularly worrying, then, petrochemical firms are seemingly so sure their enormous new investments will pay off. It indicates they see no sign of a slowdown in the production of plastics.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, there has been growing pressure to regulate plastics around the world. Plastic objects and marine plastic pollution have helped elevate plastics to the top of the political agenda in many regions. </p>
<p>The fact we can find plastic literally everywhere and gloomy prospects, such as the prediction there’ll be more plastic than fish (by weight) in the ocean by 2050, make it clear policy responses are needed urgently.</p>
<p>Addressing plastic waste and particular objects is necessary, but it is not enough. The plastic pollution prevention policies now in place will not break the wave of plastic waste, let alone alter the fundamental structure of the sector. </p>
<p>Our research shows what drastic changes to the ways we use plastics are required to reach a meaningful form of circular economy.</p>
<h2>THE ANTI-PLASTIC MOVEMENT</h2>
<p>Resistance against the industry is growing. Around the world, there are loud, local protests against expanding production of plastics and other petrochemicals.</p>
<p>In the US, protesters have successfully litigated against petrochemical production facilities. In Texas, plastic pellets gathered over several years were used as evidence in a lawsuit filed against Formosa Plastics. </p>
<p>The outcome encouraged another lawsuit against Formosa Plastics in Louisiana, where protesters have fought the building of new petrochemical facilities. </p>
<p>In the Netherlands, the Plastic Soup Foundation took legal steps to try and stop plastic pellet pollution from the chemical clusters in Rotterdam and Antwerp.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, where petrochemicals have been a key contributor to economic development, several protests against petrochemical sites have made it nearly impossible to expand.</p>
<p>Even in China, which has seen the most rapid expansion of the industry in recent years, protests have been organised in many cities where plans for paraxylene production have been revealed. </p>
<p>INEOS responded saying emissions from the production in the UK were lower than elsewhere, and that the company explores ways of reducing emissions further.</p>
<p>The local union, Unite, has a long history of conflicts with the owner, including on the topic of fracking. INEOS already imports ethane from US shale gas and has pursued fracking in the UK, whereas Unite has campaigned against fracking.</p>
<p>Striking a balance between securing jobs for the communities around petrochemical clusters and shutting down emissions-intensive production remains difficult.</p>
<p>So local pressure on petrochemicals has, in some cases, resulted in individual plants being forced to change their practices. </p>
<p>But they have not led to a systemic change of the sector, which continues to be locked in to fossil-based and greenhouse emissions intensive technologies and processes. </p>
<h2>LARGER STEPS TOWARDS LOW-CARBON SUSTAINABLE PLASTICS NEEDED</h2>
<p>The industry is not doing enough. Only a few of the large companies have set proper targets for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. And plans for how they will do so remain light on detail.</p>
<p>Several scenarios show deep cuts to emissions within the industry are possible – but rely heavily on niche and future technologies that would require an unprecedented technology scale-up and renewable energy deployment. </p>
<p>Some large firms are strategically acquiring renewable energy assets, such as offshore wind farms, to supply energy to their plants, but not yet at anywhere near the scale needed to replace all their fossil energy use. </p>
<p>And industry trade associations continue to lobby against tougher regulations aimed at accelerating the transition.</p>
<p>At the same time, large firms continue to announce plans for new larger plants that will continue to use fossil fuel resources and remain productive for decades, emitting CO2 far beyond 2050.</p>
<p>There is a great need to move beyond words and small incremental changes and take larger steps towards low-carbon and sustainable plastics. Working seriously on how to get there entails many different changes. </p>
<p>Carbon capture could be a solution for the remaining fossil-based production and emissions which cannot be mitigated soon enough – including from chemical recycling plants.</p>
<p>A convention on plastic pollution is emerging, but global meetings on climate change, such as COP26, need to focus more attention on the somewhat overseen issue of petrochemicals.</p>
<p>Plastics are locked into fossil resources and this connection continues to grow stronger by the day.</p>
