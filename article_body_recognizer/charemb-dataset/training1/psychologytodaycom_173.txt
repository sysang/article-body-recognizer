<h1> Don't Let Common Thinking Traps Get You Stuck </h1>
<h2> There are a few common thinking traps we’re all guilty of falling into. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: wan wei/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>What can we do to balance our negative and positive thoughts?</p>
<p>Trick question! Controlling our thoughts doesn’t make for a healthy mental experience—if we try to manipulate our thoughts, we’re only fooling ourselves and, since the mind has a pretty strong will, fighting a losing battle. </p>
<p>The mind likes to fret, criticize, complain, doubt, bemoan, downplay, and generally bring us back down to earth. Sometimes, it does go too far and keeps us mired in muddy, unhelpful swamps, and in those moments, we could use a positive lift.</p>
<a>for better mental health</a> and more successful living?
<p>Let’s take a look at just a few of the most common thinking traps we’re all guilty of falling into.</p>
<p>Thinking trap #1: Black-and-white thinking</p>
<li>"I bombed this speech because I messed up my talking points."</li>
<li>"My friends have partners, so they're lovable. I'm single because I'm unlovable."</li>
<li>"Your parents were perfect because they supported your <a>dreams</a>, but mine ruined my life because they didn’t let me go to fashion school."</li>
<p>How to avoid this thinking trap</p>
<p>Next time your mind tells you a story that seems to only present two forks in the road, slow down and ask if you might be missing some options. The more of those you see, the clearer the picture will be.</p>
<p>Thinking trap #2: Jumping to conclusions</p>
<li>"She didn’t pick up my phone call, so she must be mad at me."</li>
<li>"If I don’t list all my accomplishments in this interview, they’ll never hire me."</li>
<li>"The doctor is frowning at my chart, so there must be something terribly wrong with my test results."</li>
<p>For better or worse, our brains are faster than the speed of sound, always racing ahead to see what might lie ahead.</p>
<a>anxiety</a>, but sometimes it even becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<a>mind-reading</a>. Is your thought based on facts that have already happened? Or is it based on what you
<p>Thinking trap #3: Mental filter</p>
<ul><li>"Every time I have an <a>insomnia</a> night, my brain is useless the next day."</li> <li>"My partner is always leaving dirty dishes in the sink. She's hopeless!"</li> <li>"I suck at art. I've only ever drawn stick figures!"</li> </ul>
<p>Perhaps it’s true that you’ve only ever drawn stick figures, but have you tried to draw more seriously with an open mind? Picasso himself would never have become a great artist if he had constantly told himself he couldn't be one.</p>
<p>Next time you feel stuck or despairing about something, see if you’re looking at the situation with blinders on. Suspend your belief and ask if there’s anything you’re missing.</p>
<p>With practice, you might find yourself working with your thoughts instead of against them. And isn’t that more fun?</p>

<a>attention</a>. As you get used to what will be the new normal at least for a while, these tips will help you cope.
<p>1. Limit your news consumption to a few trustworthy official sources.</p>
<a>drinking bleach or snorting cocaine</a>!)
<a>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> is an excellent resource for coronavirus updates. Your local health official's website is another good place to stay updated about what's happening in your own community.
<p>2. If you're homebound, try to stay physically and mentally active.</p>
<a>work from home</a>. Many public gatherings and events have been canceled to help
<a>"flatten the pandemic curve"</a> and slow the spread of COVID-19. You may have even opted to self-quarantine.
<p>We’re all making a lot of lifestyle shifts, including hunkering down and staying home. Cabin fever is real! The monotony of staying in one place can wear on anyone's mental well-being.</p>
<a>maintain exercise routines</a>, or even pick up a new one to do at home. Try to get outside to places that aren't crowded. (Of course,
<a>follow social distancing guidelines</a> and use common-sense precautions.) If you have a yard, try taking up gardening. Have a balcony? Start a small container herb garden or work outside for a few hours each day.
<a> flattening out</a>. Sunlight entering through the eyes is the strongest cue for your brain to know what time of day or night it is. The clearer the message you give to the circadian clock in your brain, the healthier and happier you’ll be.
<p>3. Stay socially active, too.</p>

<p>4. Seek help from a mental health provider if you need it.</p>

<h1> How Does Your Attachment Style Impact Your Relationships? </h1>
<h2> Your attachment style may affect commitment, trust, and jealousy. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Attachment? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>dating</a> someone for a few months and things are going great. You feel connected, you have a similar
<a>sense of humor</a>, you enjoy being around their friends, and you haven’t seen any glaring red flags. You both haven’t been seeing anyone else for a while now.
<p>One night, they’re hanging out at your place and mention the idea of becoming exclusive and officially being coined a couple. What’s your reaction?</p>
<li>Sure, let’s give it a shot! I’m really enjoying spending time with you, so let’s see where this goes.</li>
<li>Whoa, whoa—slow down! That much commitment this soon is too much for me. Maybe we should take a step back.</li>
<li>Wait, what? My toothbrush is already permanently installed in your bathroom, you've met my parents, and you know all my secrets. We’re way past “exclusive.”</li>
<li>Yes. No. I don’t know. Are you mad? I really like you. I don’t know. </li>
<p>How you respond largely depends on your <a>attachment</a> style—your patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving in the way you bond with others. They generally fall into <a>four different styles</a>.</p>
<ul><li>Secure</li> <li>Dismissive-avoidant</li> <li><a>Anxious</a>-preoccupied</li> <li>Fearful-avoidant (a.k.a., disorganized)</li> </ul>
<a>Jealousy</a>? These are affected by your attachment style, too.
<p>Let’s take a look at a few different aspects of relationships that often determine how they start, flourish (or wither), and, perhaps, end.</p>
<a>attachment</a>—at work, too. It’s no surprise that, out of all the attachment styles, people with dismissive-avoidant attachment styles
<a>feel the least committed</a> to their
<a>romantic relationship</a>. On the flip side, securely attached people feel the most committed. Unsurprisingly, researchers who followed the activity of people with avoidant styles for a few months found they were
<a>most likely to have a break-up</a>.
<a>flirting</a> with someone else or receiving a lot of
<a>attention</a> from a potential rival. But if your jealousy is out of proportion to reality or leads to unhealthy behaviors, like checking your partner’s phone or restricting their independence, it can lead to serious problems.

<p>One attachment researcher has described <a>four prerequisites</a> for being able to have intimacy in a relationship:</p>
<ul><li>Ability to seek care</li> <li>Ability to give care</li> <li>Ability to feel comfortable with an autonomous self</li> <li>Ability to negotiate</li> </ul>
<a>more connected to their romantic partners</a>, with more engagement in the relationship, more communication, and more joint friendships. They are also
<a>more authentic</a> in the way they express themselves in the relationship.

<h1> 5 Ways to Stop Nightmares </h1>
<h2> Beat nightmares and get back to restful nights. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Is Sleep Important? </li> <li> <a>Find a sleep counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Hopefully, you haven't experienced any of those events in real life. But I bet you've gone through at least one of these common themes in the snooze world and woken up in a cold sweat with your heart pounding.</p>
<p>What are nightmares, and who has them more often?</p>
<a>more common among girls</a> and women than their male counterparts. Those who struggle with
<a>alcohol or drug addiction</a> are also more likely to have frequent nightmares. People who have
<a>post-traumatic stress disorder</a> (
<a>PTSD</a>) or have experienced
<a>childhood</a> abuse may also have frequent nightmares.
<a>nightmare disorder</a>. This is a disorder where you not only frequently have vivid and disturbing dreams, but also suffer major distress or impairment during the day, such as
<a>concentration</a> problems, tiredness, and worry about going to sleep.
<p>Whether you have Nightmare Disorder, PTSD, or just experience more nightmares than you'd like, there are things you can do to decrease nightmares and regain a good relationship with sleep. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Marcos Mesa Sam Wordley/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>1. Don't avoid sleep, and keep a regular sleep-wake schedule</p>
<a>procrastinate</a> bedtime, keeping yourself awake as much as possible by watching yet another movie, reading just a few more chapters of your book, or scrolling on your phone for another hour.
<a>dreaming</a> happens. When the brain is deprived of REM, it brings REM back with a vengeance later in the night or the next night. This is called a
<a>REM rebound effect</a>—the brain gets into REM faster, stays there longer, and creates more intense dreams.
<p>Even if bedtime seems scary, try your best to keep a steady sleep-wake schedule. Give yourself ample opportunity to sleep. It will be worth it once you establish a pattern.</p>
<a>tamps down on REM</a>—drinking a lot is just like REM-depriving yourself. That leads to REM rebound and more opportunity for intense nightmares the next time you drift off to dream town. If someone frequently drinks,
<a>withdrawal from alcohol</a> when they try to cut down on drinking also leads to more nightmares.
<div> <h2>Sleep Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Sleep Is Nature's Medicine</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>How to Power Through the Afternoon Slump</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<a>antidepressants</a>, and other types of drugs have been linked to nightmares, so review your medications with your doctor to see if there are possible culprits. Even the timing of when you take
<a>medication</a> could affect dreaming, so it's important to ask your doctor whether you must take your antidepressant at night, or if there are other options.
<p>3. Wake up fully and be ready for a quick check-in with reality</p>
<a>traumatic</a> event, or if you've been having frequent nightmares for a long time. What should you do when they happen?
<a>lying</a> back down and closing your eyes.
<p>4. Rewrite the ending and rehearse the new script</p>
<a>imagery rehearsal therapy</a> (IRT). This
<a>therapy</a> has a very simple premise—having nightmares is a learned behavior for the brain, which means it's possible to unlearn.
<p>5. Seek treatment for PTSD and other mental health needs</p>
<a>PTSD or another psychiatric condition</a>, and successfully treating those conditions can often
<a>decrease nightmares</a>. Treating PTSD will improve your daytime too, allowing you to have less anxiety, better relationships, and the opportunity to be your full self.
<a>cognitive processing therapy</a>, which uses an evidence-based, step-by-step approach to help you learn about how PTSD has impacted you, pinpoint the "stuck points" that keep you bogged down, and learn strategies for finding balance.
<a>take PTSD down</a> a notch overall.

<h1> 8 Strategies to Manage Overwhelming Feelings </h1>
<h2> Try these tips to keep calm and carry on. </h2>
<p>Sound familiar? Functioning isn’t so simple when you’re overwhelmed.</p>
<p>And we react to these feelings the same way we do with other threats: fight, flight, or freeze. That's true whether the threat is a bus hurtling toward us or a to-do list that makes us feel like we can’t catch our breath.</p>
<a>gratitude</a>, try these eight tips.
<p>1. Ground yourself in the present using the 5-4-3-2-1 technique.</p>
<p>This is one of my favorite <a>mindfulness</a> techniques. It doesn’t require any special spaces or tools—all you need is your five senses. Here's how to walk your way through them for instant grounding:</p>
<li>5 - Look around and name five things you can see, right now, from where you are.</li>
<li>4 - Listen and name four things you can hear.</li>
<li>3 - Notice three things you can touch, like the pages of a nearby book or the feeling of your feet on the carpet.</li>
<li>2 - Next come two smells: Breathe in the pages of a book or the citrus <a>scent</a> of the candle you lit.</li>
<li>1 - Finally, name something you can taste: a sip of cold water will do, or even just the taste of your own mouth.</li>
<p>2. Clean up your immediate surroundings.</p>
<p>The phrase “outer order, inner calm” is popular for a reason. When you’re feeling overwhelmed, tidying the area around you restores order to a little corner of your universe and allows you to move forward.</p>
<p>3. Ruthlessly prioritize.</p>
<p>Cut everything that should be done and stick to things that need to get done now.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: TierneyMJ/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>4. Stop accidentally multitasking</p>
<a>attention</a> (and then transition it back) hundreds of times a day.
<p>5. Take the next tiny step.</p>
<p>6. Follow your impulses (sort of).</p>
<p>7. Rethink your to-do list.</p>
<p>Another method: Write out your list in accordance with your schedule. Plan big projects for the morning when you have the most energy and focus. Schedule brainless tasks for the 3 p.m. slump.</p>
<p>8. Radically accept what you cannot do or control.</p>
<p>You can strategize, organize, and hack all you want, but at some point, you will run into something you can’t do or control. When you do, the only thing to do is to radically accept.</p>
<p>Radical acceptance doesn’t mean throwing in the towel. It means allowing for uncertainty and uncontrollability, without struggle or complaint, and keeping on with what you can do instead of dwelling on what you can't.</p>

<p>But I am feeling angry these days. While the events that sparked my anger and the deep-rooted social problems they expose are beyond my scope of expertise, the emotions surrounding them are my bread and butter. </p>
<p>Now, I realize that my young self’s understanding of one of these emotions was very wrong: Anger is not poison; it's fuel.</p>

<p>Anger is an emotion, not a behavior</p>
<p>First, let’s bring some light to an often misunderstood concept: Anger is not a behavior, it’s an emotion. </p>
<a>attention</a>, and a facial expression that flashes like a warning sign.
<a>aggression</a>. Those words describe what people do; anger describes how people feel.
<p>While anger can activate aggressive behavior, it doesn’t always and doesn’t have to. For example, you can feel mad that someone cut you in line for show tickets without flipping them the finger. </p>
<p>You can also hurt someone without being angry at all. For example, people who commit terrible <a>sex</a> crimes can be perfectly cool and calculated in the way they stalk and harass their victims.</p>

<p>Anger is the same. It tells us that injustice is being enacted, or that we need to take action to ensure the survival of our body and our integrity.</p>

<p>Being aggressive or suppressing anger is unhealthy</p>

<h1> How to Recognize (and Correct) Enabling Behavior </h1>
<h2> Here's how to take note of enabling and correct it with empathy and boundaries. </h2>
<a>quit smoking</a> by dunking their cigarettes in water or trying to get their roommate out of an abusive relationship by secretly sabotaging their dates.
<p>Their sympathy overflows, and they want so much to help their loved one. They say, “If I don’t try to help, what will become of them?”</p>
<p>But what my cousin--and those like her--was doing was not helping. She was just enabling.</p>
<a>study on people with alcohol dependence and their partners</a> found that the majority of partners engaged in enabling behaviors, such as
<a>lying</a> and covering for them or threatening to leave but not following through.
<p>What is enabling, and why is it unhelpful?</p>
<p>Do any of these enabling behaviors, often disguised as helpful behaviors, strike a chord? </p>
<p>1. Cleaning up after them</p>
<p>I don’t just mean literally cleaning up their messes (though I’m sure plenty of people do this as a means to “help"). </p>
<p>Cleaning up includes any form of shielding the person from the natural negative consequences of their own behavior.</p>
<li>A parent calls their daughter’s college professor to argue about her failing exam grade</li>
<li>A partner lies to his in-laws about her wife’s drug problem to protect her from <a>embarrassment</a></li>
<li>A <a>sibling</a> pays his brother’s rent whenever his funds fall short because he regularly puts all his money into online gambling</li>
<a>confidence</a> in their own ability to handle tough situations.
<p>2. Giving them non-specific help (like money) that doesn’t support a well-defined goal</p>
<p>Our loved ones often come to us in a moment of crisis. They’re about to lose their job. They need to pay someone back. They’ve been caught cheating and need a couch to crash on. </p>
<p>3. Not sticking to your word about boundaries and limits</p>
<p>Accidental enablers can use boundaries to stop the cycle. It’s not letting those boundaries slip when the going gets tough for your loved one that’s the hard part. </p>
<p>If you put your foot down on not loaning money to your brother until three agreed upon monthly payments on previous loans, don’t waffle after two months. </p>
<p>4. Flip-flopping between shaming them and making excuses for them</p>
<p>We’re all human, and when someone we care about keeps sabotaging themselves, it’s easy to get frustrated. This frustration can make us do things like <a>guilt</a>-tripping them.</p>
<a>Shaming smokers tends to backfire</a>.

<p>How to productively help someone make a life change</p>
<p>Before you start to help someone, it’s important to acknowledge that you can't control another person's behavior, and it's not your job to do so.</p>
<p>Gently drop the idea that you should be able to turn someone around. </p>
<p>Now that you've relinquished control, turn your <a>attention</a> to the person you’re trying to help. Start, as always, with <a>empathy</a>:</p>
<p>1. Provide a non-judgmental space for them to share</p>
<p>2. Hold them accountable without shaming or guilt-tripping</p>
<p>When the person is ready to change--to get off drugs, leave a toxic relationship, make a monthly budget--you can be ready to keep them accountable if they ask for help.</p>
<p>3. Celebrate successes with them</p>
<p>If you help a loved one set realistic, incremental milestones right from the start, there will hopefully be many opportunities to celebrate. It’s your job to remind them how hard change is, and how proud they should be of every win.</p>
<p>4. Provide reasonable logistical support and attention</p>
<p>I started out by listing unhelpful enabling behaviors, such as repeatedly lending money without accountability, with the caveat that sometimes a concrete piece of support could be appropriate. In fact, sometimes it could even be crucial.</p>
<li>Is the person willing to put in the work to change their unhealthy behaviors? </li>
<li>Is there a well-defined purpose for the loan or other form of help?</li>
<li>Is there a reasonable plan (or are they willing to make one) for what they will do after they use your support to get past this immediate crisis?</li>

<h1> Why We Believe in Conspiracy Theories </h1>
<h2> From chemtrails to the Illuminati, here's how conspiracy theories take root. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Shutterstock/Media Whalestock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Whether they're true or not, the psychology behind why we believe in conspiracy theories is fascinating. </p>
<p>Why do people believe in conspiracy theories?</p>
<p>Psychologists who specialize in conspiracy theories note that there are three main motivations people have for believing in a conspiracy, though they’re not always aware of said motivations.</p>
<p>When a conspiracy theory pops up, claiming to make sense of the insensible, it can be pretty appealing.</p>
<a>high need for cognitive closure</a>—in other words, they feel deeply distressed if they don’t get answers.
<p>2. The need to feel safe and in control. Similar to the need to make sense of the world, humans also have a desire to feel safe and in control of our environment.</p>
<a>offer the opportunity to reject official narratives</a>, affording some small comfort.
<p>3. The need to cultivate a good <a>self-image</a>. Another reason people who feel left behind or left out are <a>more likely to believe in conspiracy theories</a> is that these unfounded beliefs offer a way to maintain a positive self-image.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is why people on the <a>losing side of the political process</a> are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. It allows people to blame others when things go wrong, rather than take a look at their campaign. </p>
<p>How do conspiracy theories take root?</p>
<p>As we’ve discussed, there are a few factors that make people more susceptible to believing in conspiracy theories. But how do specific theories take root in people’s minds?</p>
<p>The answer is complex, but psychological science has found some hints.</p>
<a>confirmation bias</a>. Confirmation
<a>falsely recalling</a> that they had believed in the conspiracy all along.
<p>In other words, the act of believing in conspiracy theories is its own fuel. The more we believe in one, the more likely we are to believe in others, even if they're contradictory.</p>
<a>episode of sleep paralysis</a>. Often, their
<p>What are the psychological consequences of believing in conspiracy theories?</p>
<p>As I've already mentioned, a deep longing for safety and control can motivate someone to believe in conspiracy theories. But unfortunately, this approach isn't helpful. In fact, it may have the opposite effect.</p>
<a>they immediately feel less like they’re in control</a>. And it’s not just about feeling bad—believing in conspiracy theories makes people distrustful of government
<a>even when the theories aren’t related to the government</a>. It also

<a>wise minds</a>—acknowledge our
<a>anxiety</a>, but also weigh the facts so we can be empowered with useful knowledge in the face of uncertainty.

<h1> Pain Is Unavoidable, Suffering Is an Option </h1>
<h2> Pain and suffering are not one in the same. </h2>
<p>It’s funny—when I think about the most painful experiences in my life, both physically and emotionally, I notice that the amount of hurt I felt at the time is not proportional to how much I shudder when I look back on those moments. </p>
<p>For example, nothing caused as much pure, mind-numbing pain than giving birth! Yet even in the toughest moments, I felt pride and excitement. But when I get a mosquito bite, I complain and moan for days. Suffering galore!</p>
<p>Judged by the level of pain alone, giving birth is a million times worse than a mosquito bite. So, what governs the amount of suffering we experience?</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: The secret ingredient behind how much we suffer from painful experiences lies in the way we think about pain. </p>
<a>congenital insensitivity to pain</a> can feel unpleasant emotions.
<a>stress</a> on them and cause an injury.
<a>pets</a>, we wouldn’t be sad if they died. Sadness also signals to those around us that we need to be consoled and supported, and in the other direction, gives us the basic foundation for
<ul><li>Necessary and unavoidable</li> <li>Clean and simple, even if unpleasant</li> <li>A “raw” experience that isn’t over-processed by thoughts</li> </ul>
<p>Unlike pain, suffering is messy. I like to think of it as something we wrap around pain like layers of gift wrap—you can pile it on, and it makes the original piece seem much bigger and more complicated, but it’s not necessary.</p>
<p>Here’s what suffering looks like in action:</p>
<li>“Why is this arthritis happening to me? What did I do to deserve this?”</li>
<li>“I always have the worst luck. I can’t believe my flight was canceled!”</li>
<li>“I hate this cramping so much. When will it ever end?”</li>
<li>“These <a>migraines</a> are never going to go away. I can’t take it.”</li>
<li>“How come I ended up with the flu but my partner didn't? It’s not fair.”</li>
<li>“I’m young and healthy—I shouldn’t have back pain!”</li>
<p>You may also notice that these thoughts don’t accept the pain. When I say "accept," I'm not describing giving up. Accepting means acknowledging that that pain is there and then simply allowing it to be.</p>
<p>These complications apply to emotional pain and suffering, too. Do any of these sound familiar?</p>
<li>“My stupid <a>anxiety</a> makes me so miserable. What’s wrong with me?”</li>
<li>“What if I never get over this breakup? I can’t handle this.”</li>
<li>“I shouldn’t be feeling so low. Other people have it even worse.”</li>
<p>When you judge an emotion like fear—"What's wrong with me?"—what could be simple anxiety is now anxiety plus <a>shame</a>. </p>
<p>When you judge sadness as a weakness, <a>grief</a> becomes grief plus <a>guilt</a> plus pressure to act happy even when <a>happiness</a> isn't an authentic emotion.</p>
<p>When you time travel, projecting heartbreak into the future, you're forced to carry your potential heartbreak plus all of its imaginary friends in the pit of your stomach.</p>
<p>No wonder suffering feels so much heavier than pain!</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Stock-Asso/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>How to let go of suffering</p>
<p>Point blank, suffering sucks. So how do we get rid of it? </p>
<p>1. Let go of the idea that we can “get rid of” any experience we have</p>
<p>Many of my patients aren’t fans of this recommendation. They (rightfully) wonder, “Isn’t the whole point of <a>therapy</a> to get rid of bad feelings?”</p>
<p>But when was the last time you won a tug-of-war with anxiety or got rid of sadness for good? Our thoughts and emotions are real. We will never stop experiencing them, and the more we try, the harder they come back, clamoring for <a>attention</a>.</p>
<p>So instead of trying to struggle against suffering, let’s first accept that you are suffering. Let go of the goal to get rid of suffering. Turn your attention to what’s wrapped up inside the suffering—the pain.</p>
<p>2. Fully experience the pain and sit with it nonjudgmentally</p>
<p>Whether it’s physical or emotional, simply sit with the feeling of pain without any distractions.</p>
<p>The point of this exercise is not to pretend that the pain feels good or is meaningless. Listen to what your body needs—it might be an ambulance, or it might be a change in position or a moment of nonjudgmental stillness.</p>
<p>3. Recognize the stories your mind tells you about the pain</p>
<p>While you are sitting with your pain, you’ll probably notice your mind telling you stories about the pain:</p>
<li>“My life has just been one big disappointment since I lost my job.”</li>
<li>“I have to keep my anxiety under control or I’ll fall apart.”</li>
<li>“Nobody wants to be with someone who's <a>depressed</a>.”</li>
<p>In each of these examples, you can insert almost any unpleasant experience, sensation, or emotion. Notice how these stories make the pain the center of your <a>identity</a> as if it determines who you are and what your life means.</p>
<p>But you can catch these stories as your brain tells them and call them out for what they are—simply stories. You don’t have to believe them or follow their lead. </p>
<p>4. Get back to allowing the pain</p>
<p>Of course, this will not rid you of your pain. Don’t expect these steps to take away your bruised knee or a broken heart. The point isn’t to avoid pain—pain is unavoidable. The point is to notice and let go of suffering.</p>

<h1> Why We Fear Death and How to Overcome It </h1>

<p>Death—what isn’t there to be afraid of? It’s the ultimate end! But while some people dread death, others accept it as inevitable. So why do some people <a>fear</a> it more than others? </p>

<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Cristina Conti/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>This could be because older people have experienced more of life, so they have less fear of missing out. Or it might be because they have more experience with witnessing and handling the death of others. </p>
<a>confidence</a> in an afterlife or a greater meaning to life, would make people feel better about the finality of death. But studies have found that those with
<a>stronger religiosity</a>, regardless of culture or religion, have a stronger fear of death.
<p>But it’s worth noting that there are also studies that show the opposite. </p>
<p>Some studies have found that, at least among Westerners, those who fear death most are <a>moderately religious</a>. Both non-believers and very religious people <a>feared death less</a>.</p>
