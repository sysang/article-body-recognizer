<p>Another teacher, who also declined to be named, described the mental health of teachers to be “a very sad affair right now”.</p>
<p>“It’s a whole new workload altogether and I think at this point teachers are just barely managing.”</p>
<p>Ms Ong urged that “we must not look at the student’s mental well-being without looking at the teacher's well-being” as well.</p>
<p>“A student who is not well affects the wellbeing of a teacher and a teacher who is not well will also affect the students. These two things need to be looked at in totality.”</p>
<p>WHAT WOULD MAKE COUNSELLING A VIABLE OPTION?</p>
<p>One 19-year-old student, who wishes to be anonymous, suggested offering students email or phone call services like what is done at Samaritans of Singapore, such that students who are afraid of physical sessions may have an option.</p>
<p>She also suggested having routine mental health checkups, such that students who may be afraid to walk into the counsellor’s room have a space to speak up under the guise of a formal school event.</p>
<p>But he admits that the job can be overwhelming, especially with the already heavy academic stress and workload.</p>
<p>Above all, all students CNA Insider spoke to echo making school counselling more approachable, with a strong emphasis on confidentiality.</p>
<p>“These are students, it’s probably their first time starting this kind of thing. So I hope that (school counsellors) will be the ones taking the lead in asking the students, guiding the students to realize what they want,” she said.</p>
<p>MORE TRAINING FOR SCHOOL COUNSELLORS?</p>
<p>Other than the lack of resources in schools, Mdm Halimah also said that school counsellors “may not be well-trained on issues affecting mental health”.</p>
<p>In its email response, the MOE said that school counsellors receive monthly professional supervision, peer support group sessions and individual clinical supervision from lead school counsellors.</p>
<p>“These have been continuing via online platforms in the midst of COVID-19 restrictions.”</p>
<p>The MOE added that school counsellors also deepen their knowledge through workshops and courses such as “suicide assessment and intervention, psychological first aid, addiction, child abuse or family violence, and multicultural issues”.</p>
<p>At Counselling and Care Centre, she conducts supervised training for professionals in the field and she has been working with some school counsellors who want to seek “extra supervision”.</p>
<p>“We often encourage them to record their sessions - with the permission of their students - and showcase segments of their work so we can really look at the skills.”</p>
<p>From her experience working with school counsellors, she noticed that it is “really hard” for them to get more support and training to improve their skills when they have heavy caseloads and are constantly “firefighting with higher risk cases”.</p>
<p>“In this line of work, we can’t just rely on our degrees. There’s so much more conversation that needs to be carried out to support professionals in working effectively with people,” she added.</p>
<p>“The most dangerous thing is when practitioners practice on their own.”</p>
<p>CHANGING PERCEPTIONS OF MENTAL HEALTH</p>
<p>In schools, there is the Character Citizenship Education (CCE), which this year had a refreshed syllabus that gives more focus on mental wellness and peer support. But teachers find that it is merely “scratching the surface”.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Schools to offer mental health lessons from 2021; more trips to Asian countries</a></h3>
<p>Rachel added: “Teachers are so busy teaching other lessons that during CCE lessons, we just literally deliver whatever the school gives us. It’s really hard to engage the kids in a manner that is real and that they can fully relate to.”</p>
<p>This is why she also felt that her students took CCE as “a joke”.</p>
<p>“Students don't feel like they can ask anything. It's very hard in a group of 40 - not every child wants to speak up, not every child wants to engage. Whereas if you had smaller groups, it’ll be more intimate.”</p>
<p>While part of the refreshed CCE syllabus teaches “resilience and social-emotional well-being” - which includes having a sense of gratitude and appreciation - Cindy felt that it perpetuates “toxic positivity”.</p>
<p>Perhaps, beyond improving ratios and the quality of care, it is an attitudinal shift that is needed in taking care of students’ - and even teachers’ - mental health.</p>
<p>“We need to be mindful of using mental resilience and mental well-being interchangeably. We really need to stop talking about resilience as if (poor mental health) is just something to snap out of,” said Ms Ong.</p>
<p>“There isn’t a strength more powerful than being able to deal with your own vulnerability, and I think we understate that.”</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Her life changed forever the day the letter arrived.</p>
<p>It was July 2014, and Madam Yee Dew Eng had just returned home from her cleaning job at a nearby school when she found the letter slipped under her door.</p>
<p>She recognised the logo of the Housing and Development Board (HDB). But she could not make out the rest of it. Yee, then 76, had spent most of her life working a variety of jobs from construction to cleaning, and could neither read nor write. </p>
<p>It was only later, when she asked her children to read the letter, that she learned she would have to vacate her second-floor rental flat at 30 Dakota Crescent where she lived alone; a place she had called home for more than 30 years. </p>
<p>The estate was to be redeveloped, and she would have slightly over two years, till the end of 2016, to get ready to move to the new place offered. </p>
<p>Yee loved her home, with its wide corridors and open spaces that gave her the opportunity to host large groups of friends or family dinners. </p>
<p>The wet market at Kallang Estate just across the road made it easy to get her groceries. And whenever Shuilin saw Yee lugging her shopping, she’d offer a hand. “She treated me like her grandmother,” said the elderly resident.</p>
<p>The grassy expanses and stone benches were an impromptu gathering spot for residents who loved to take morning walks around the estate.</p>
<p>One of them was Jamaluddin, 74, a former school caretaker who lived in a ground-floor unit at block 20. He’d stop to feed the community cats each day, and struck up a friendship with the elderly woman next door.</p>
<p>“Every morning, we’d sit together,” he said, gesturing to the space between their two units. “Because I can speak Hokkien, she liked to talk.” </p>
<p>It functioned as a “one-stop” service of sorts, said centre manager Roger Neo: When residents received letters they could not read, or needed help contacting agencies, they would drop by for help.</p>
<p>Po Lu, 77, enjoyed strolling over for the morning exercise sessions. “I knew everyone. All of them are very nice,” she said, saving her most effusive praise for Neo, or “Ah Leong” as she and the residents affectionately called him. </p>
<p>“Ah Leong is a very good person,” she said. </p>
<p>Some grew to depend on him for almost everything. The area’s Member of Parliament Lim Biow Chuan said some trusted Neo so utterly, they’d leave their house keys with him, or pass him money to pay government agencies on their behalf. </p>
<p>The bonds within the old estate were unique, not to be found anywhere else, Neo believed. </p>
<p>“The elderly moved into Dakota when they were much younger; they built their families there, their children grew up together,” he said.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> It’s like a kampung - everyone knows each other.” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Other times, he was not so lucky.</p>
<p>“I would have to sit on each step and go up step by step,” he recalled. The lift, he added, was often out of order, but because it was so old, spare parts were hard to come by. </p>
<p>“There was one time I waited the whole morning, and they couldn’t get it done. Eventually, I was carried up.”</p>
<p>With the help of HDB, he later moved to a ground-floor unit. It was windy and peaceful, he said, with the Geylang River at his doorstep and a courtyard where he could cultivate plants.</p>
<p>GALLERY: THE OLD DAKOTA CRESCENT</p>
<p>Then came the news in 2014. As part of the Government’s estate renewal plans for Mountbatten, Dakota was to be redeveloped as a public housing site with “more intensive use of the land”. </p>
<p>Tenants who were ready to buy a flat were also to be given priority allocation in sales exercises, as well as a relocation grant.</p>
<p>The flats at 52 Cassia Crescent would have elderly-friendly universal design features, such as ramps at the main entrance and bathrooms for easy access; and wider internal corridors and doorways to accommodate wheelchairs. </p>
<p>But as observers note, relocating the elderly isn’t just a matter of putting a new roof over their heads. There are ramifications to uprooting them from their familiar social networks and surroundings too. </p>
<p>“It seems natural that because Singapore is so tight on space, with housing being demolished and built all the time, there must be relocation,” said Assistant Professor Ng Kok Hoe of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP).</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> But we don’t think of the process of moving people around physically, taking communities apart and then rebuilding them… It is a huge blind spot,” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>added Ng, who co-edited a book of essays, They Told Us To Move: Dakota-Cassia.</p>
<p>So what can be learnt from the experiences of the former Dakota residents?</p>
<p>WATCH: Life uprooted: Dakota to Cassia, a documentary 2 years in the making. (22:23)</p>
<p>One common reaction to the move was: Dismay, confusion and bewilderment. </p>
<p>Neo had been hearing rumours of a relocation exercise “ever since I first came to Dakota”, but he first got confirmation when a resident asked him to help read and translate the letter of notice. </p>
<p>Full of practical concerns, residents kept asking Neo: When is the move? What will the new flat look like? How big is it? Where is it? How do I move all my things there? </p>
<p>He sympathised with them. “For a person living alone who is 70, 80 years old, the packing and unpacking - asking them to do all this is very, very difficult.”</p>
<p>Then there was the paperwork and steps involved, such as selecting their new flats.</p>
<p>To assuage worries over the smaller new flat units, MP Lim arranged with the housing board to bus some residents to a similar housing project in Marsiling, where they could see that the layout was “quite usable”.</p>
<p>But Lim had another concern: The new block, as originally planned, lacked a large void deck.</p>
<p>The board obliged by freeing up the block’s second floor to be used as a “void deck” of sorts, instead of for flat units.</p>
<h4> <div>Related: Stories about Singapore's elderly</div> </h4>
<p>One of the biggest blows for elderly residents was realising that the Tung Ling centre, and their “kampung chief” Ah Leong, would not be moving with them to their new home. </p>
<p>A space was set aside for a Senior Activity Centre (SAC) and a childcare centre at Cassia, but Neo’s request to move to Cassia was turned down. He remembers the residents’ crestfallen faces, he said. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> I apologised to them. They were disappointed. We were also very disappointed.” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>“But there was no explanation. They came, they assessed, and there was no change in their decision.”</p>
<p>But Lim was determined not to see Neo’s centre disappear entirely from the area. “I considered the work done by Tung Ling to be exceptional,” said the MP. “So I asked if they would be interested in running a centre nearby. </p>
<p>“They would reach out to another set of residents - and if there were those (at Cassia Crescent) that wanted to maintain the friendship, they’d be also free to join.”</p>
<p>The catch? The centre’s new location at 58 Dakota Crescent is at least a 10-minute walk from Cassia - a challenge for an elderly person with mobility issues.</p>
<p>HELPING A WHOLE VILLAGE TO MOVE </p>
<p>A Relocation Taskforce formed by Lim and grassroots volunteers, and assisted by Neo, swung into action. They went door to door asking residents what help they needed – be it finding packing material, or installing fixtures at the new flats. </p>
<p>“I have (HDB’s) number on my phone, on speed dial to whoever is in charge,” Sim quipped.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges the taskforce faced was the residents’ sheer amount of possessions - and convincing them to part with what wouldn’t fit into the smaller new flats. </p>
<p>“There was a lot of persuasion and soft skills involved,” said Sim Bee Hia, who led the taskforce. “We may think, ‘why are you bringing so much furniture over when you can’t put it in?’ But these are their memories, their whole life.”</p>
<p>The work didn’t end there. For a while after the move, Sim said her team continued visiting residents to chat and make sure they were coping okay with the change.</p>
<p>“It was both a physical shift as well as a mental one, for them to start life anew,” she said.</p>
<p>INCREASING ISOLATION AND ITS DANGERS</p>
<p>As the elderly residents tried to get used to their new surroundings, some like wheelchair-bound Fun appreciated the new features straightaway, like the grab bars. </p>
<p>“I can stand, I can bathe independently,” he said.</p>
<p>But for others, the displacement took a toll on their mental and physical well-being. </p>
<p>Those living alone in particular, were lonely and could not find their friends, said Neo. Others, used to a spacious flat and open spaces, felt claustrophobic and depressed, like Yee who said it felt like living in a “bird’s nest”.</p>
<p>But for each resident who managed to overcome their insecurity, there was another who ventured out less and less in an alien environment</p>
<p>Neo knew of one woman with dementia who could always find her way from her old flat at block 28 to the Care and Friends Centre. But when she moved to Cassia, she became fearful of leaving her home and getting lost.</p>
<p>And for others, the distances to old haunts simply became too huge. </p>
<p>“My legs don’t have strength,” she said. “What if I slip and fall?” </p>
<p>These are more than just physical inconveniences. Unlike younger people, the social lives of the elderly are tied closely to their neighbourhood because of their decreased mobility, said public health researcher Yi Huso. </p>
<p>In 2019, he did a survey of 500 elderly people from 32 housing blocks in Ang Mo Kio, and measured the walking distance between their blocks and community resources such as hawker centres and parks.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> He found that the further away they were located, the less likely they were to go out and socialise or exercise – both of which are important for mental health. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>And as people grow older, their social networks tend to shrink. So even a small disruption – say, no more daily visits to the market and chats with stallholders – can have a huge impact on their well-being.</p>
<p>“Globally, the evidence is so clear. Social isolation and loneliness increases the risks of many types of physical and mental conditions, including hypertension, heart-related disease, diabetes, obesity, depression… even death.</p>
<p>“As we say: Loneliness kills people,” said the assistant professor with the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.</p>
<p>While residents were struggling to adapt during those crucial first weeks, one potential pillar of support was having its own transitional struggle. </p>
<p>Tung Ling’s Neo - who had long been the residents’ go-to helper – had had to hand off to Thye Hua Kwan, which would be running the SAC at Cassia. </p>
<p>Neo said he had reached out in mid-2015, hoping to introduce the new centre manager to the residents himself. But he learnt that one had not yet been appointed. </p>
<p>It was only in December 2016 that Nicholas Lee learnt he’d be running the new SAC. And by the time he took over officially as manager, it was February 2017 – two months after most residents had moved in.</p>
<p>“I had to pick up the pieces and carry on with the work,” Lee said. </p>
<p>Lee met up with Neo to learn what he could about the residents under his charge. Neo told him which ones needed extra attention and support – but he did not know their new unit numbers. </p>
<p>“I had to go door-to-door to find out where they were staying,” said Lee.</p>
<p>He went all-out knocking on doors for weeks, to introduce himself to residents. It was frustrating to encounter seniors distrustful of a new face. </p>
<p>“There was resistance,” Lee said. “They would prefer to look for Roger (Neo) and call Roger whenever they had problems. Then Roger would direct them to me, or call me to look out for them.”</p>
<p>In short: For several months, the elderly residents didn’t have a place like the old Care and Friends Centre where they could drop in anytime they needed help. </p>
<p>“Imagine you check into a hotel room, and there’s no reception. It added a lot of stress for the elderly,” said Neo.</p>
<p>SHORTCOMINGS ACKNOWLEDGED</p>
<p>Both Neo and Lee said coordination between their two agencies could have been better. </p>
<p>“It makes a lot of difference,” said Neo, citing how, when he first came to Dakota as a new centre manager in 2006, he was shown around and introduced to residents.</p>
<p>LKYSPP’s Ng suggests, however, that it could have been better in the first place to just let Neo and Tung Ling follow the elderly residents to the new place and continue serving them.</p>
<p>“As with all new sites, new services were contracted out in a normal way,” Ng said. “The process itself was above board, and there must be reasons for inviting the other service provider to operate (the SAC).</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> But what this process was blind to, was the fact that the previous provider had a lot of advantages that no new service provider would have.” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>The HDB said that “for residents who are supported by social services, we will work with the service providers to maintain service continuity for the residents”.</p>
<p>“Relocation is not an easy process for all involved,” the housing board acknowledged. “Some residents may need many helping hands to make the move. There are limits to what HDB alone can do, given the constraints on our resources such as manpower. </p>
<p>“As such, we aim to work more closely with institutional and community partners alike for future relocation exercises.”</p>
<p>It added that it would “continue to find ways to improve the relocation process, based on experience of previous exercises”.</p>
<p>It is important that the process be improved, because redevelopment in Singapore will only pick up pace as more estates age, as Ng noted. “Most HDB residents will experience relocation at some point in their lives.”</p>
<p>“If we’re interested in building a strong society with tight-knit communities, we should be paying special attention to the way we preserve and rebuild communities if we have to move them.” </p>
<p>RETURN OF THE KAMPUNG SPIRIT?</p>
<p>The story of the former Dakotans did get better.</p>
<p>At the end of 2016, young volunteers for a heritage interest group were collecting stories from residents about the old Dakota Crescent for the project Between Two Homes.</p>
<p>This prompted the youth and two others to start the Cassia Resettlement Team (CRT) in February 2017, to help the elderly settle in. </p>
<p>For instance, they referred those with disrupted meal deliveries to other service providers; organised potluck parties to help residents reconnect with old neighbours and make new friends; and worked with the SAC to conduct gardening classes.</p>
<p>The team, which started with around 10 volunteers, has grown to about 75 volunteers. </p>
<p>“Through our regular home visits, we pick up residents who might have new medical conditions and new difficulties. So we are sort of the first responder and a safety net in this community,” Lim said, adding:</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> It’s important to make a distinction between relocation and resettlement. Resettlement is also about helping residents thrive in the new community.” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>The role of the Relocation Taskforce too changed. </p>
<p>When a second group of residents relocated from Sims Drive to Cassia, it became a priority to integrate both groups. So in early 2019, 52 Community Dinners was born – named both for the block number and the number of weeks in a year. </p>
<p>Every Monday, volunteers threw a dinner party for residents at the second floor’s open space, with old movies and Bingo games. On those nights that CNA Insider visited, the place was abuzz. </p>
<p>The dinners succeeded in getting residents to come out and socialise – particularly those wheelchair-bound who might be confined at home. </p>
<p>“The residents are happier, and they are less shy about seeking help,” Sim said, adding that she’d even seen one woman with dementia become more alert. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, SAC manager Lee’s persistence in wooing residents paid off – just before the pandemic, about 30 regulars were showing up every day, up from the 10 or so when the centre first opened.</p>
<p>They now affectionately referred to him as Ah Beng or Ah Ming. “I just let them accept me at their own pace,” he said.</p>
<p>EPILOGUE: COVID-19 AND THE AFTERMATH</p>
<p>When COVID-19 struck in 2020 and Singapore’s ‘circuit breaker’ went into effect, it not only threatened to set back all this progress. It also drove home the dangers of isolation among the elderly.</p>
<p>Tung Ling and the SAC’s activities, as well as the community dinners, all had to stop. Sim and a few volunteers checked in with residents via phone and delivered food items to those in need. </p>
<p>“We were anxious,” she said. “Not just about how they are doing, but also if we would be the conduit of bringing COVID-19 to them.”</p>
<p>Residents would want to shake their hands or invite them in. They had to say no. The residents understood – but as the days turned into months, she could see, in their drawn faces, the toll that the isolation and confinement took.</p>
<p>Physically, there was an impact as well. Po Lu, once active in Neo’s exercise classes, was stuck in her small flat. Soon she became aware of strange aches and pains developing that made her feel weak.</p>
<p>“Walking is a lot slower for me now,” she said. “It feels like my legs have no strength.”</p>
<p>The activity centres have since reopened, with staggered times and social distancing. But the community dinners have not resumed.</p>
<h4> <div>Related: COVID-19 and the elderly</div> </h4>
<p>In April 2021, Lee was posted to another SAC, after four years of painstakingly building relationships from scratch. A new centre manager has taken over at Cassia. </p>
<p>Even the dour Yee, who complained to CNA Insider about her 16th-floor studio unit being dark and small and noisy, has fewer gripes these days. </p>
<p>After she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, she got assistance to move to a unit next to the lift lobby in mid-2020. She likes it more – she enjoys the breeze and the view of the CBD from her window. </p>
<p>But still, she hankers after the good old times. </p>
<p>On her wall is a newspaper clipping with a photo of her smiling younger self in her old second-floor flat at Dakota, surrounded by all her things. “Every night, after I finish my dinner, I will think about the past,” she said. </p>
<p>It never fails to bring a smile to her face. </p>
<p>This is the first of a two-parter looking at how the impact of relocation on the elderly can be better managed, as more estates are marked for redevelopment. Next: <a>Tanglin Halt to Dawson</a>.</p>

<li>Some of the last few residents moving out soon, under a SERS exercise, have lived there for 50 years</li>
<li>They rely on a community of hawkers, shopkeepers, neighbours and a centre that is “like family” to look out for them</li>

<p>SINGAPORE: At 93, Madam Wong Ying has lived more than half her life in Tanglin Halt.</p>
<p>Sundays are for church, one bus stop away. And four times a week, she can be found at the FaithActs centre a short stroll away, playing games and taking exercise classes.</p>
<p>But these days, she’s been seeing fewer and fewer familiar faces at her hangouts.</p>
<p>“Only a few of us are left,” she said wistfully in Cantonese. “The rest have moved.” Soon, she will have to as well. </p>
<p>Her face is stoic when asked about how she feels about relocating. “I don’t want to think about it,” she says.</p>
<p>Affected residents are being allocated new flats at five nearby sites, and some have already moved into finished units at Dawson Vista and Forfar Heights, while others are waiting on the completion of the remaining sites – expected by end-2021. </p>
<p>CNA Insider tracked some of the elderly residents over two years, including in the wake of the COVID-19 ‘circuit breaker’ which threw into painful relief the worrying effects of social isolation on the elderly.</p>

<p>GOODBYE TO CENTRE THAT’S A SECOND FAMILY</p>
<p>When we first met Wong in 2019, it took her just over 10 minutes to walk with slow, mincing steps, using an umbrella as a walking stick, the 600 metres from her flat to the FaithActs centre at 50 Commonwealth Drive. </p>
<p>She never fully recovered from a fall a decade ago that injured her arm and leg. Yet, she made the journey there four times a week for her friends – and the centre’s executive director, Shirley Ng.</p>
<p>For 10 years, Ng has been involved in the day-to-day running of what is a second home for 300-odd seniors (it also caters to youths and families in the estate). Ng has come to regard the old folks as family, and they her.</p>
<p>“They treat me like I’m their child,” she said, warmly remembering how she once casually mentioned that she liked a certain type of salted vegetable – and the next day, she was presented with a big, home-cooked tub of it.</p>
<p>The social service agency’s application for a space to run a centre near Dawson Vista was rejected. It also expressed interest in running a centre near the upcoming flats at Margaret Drive, but has yet to get a reply.</p>
<p>For relocated residents, getting to the centre from their new flats in Dawson estate would mean at least a 20-minute walk – half of it unsheltered, with one major road crossing – or a four bus-stop ride.</p>
<p>The 67-year-old with Parkinson’s disease moved in June 2020 to a bright, airy new flat at Dawson, and still returns to FaithActs every week. “I’m very happy (when I go back),” she said. “I get to see my old friends.”</p>
<p>For Ng, it seems a shame not to preserve the bonds and trust that her centre has already built with these seniors. “We go beyond the casual kind of relationship and help them as much as we can,” she said.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> That’s the reason why they will tell us every little thing… some even tell us where they keep their keys at home.” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>She worries that being torn from support systems they know could affect the old folks’ mental well-being.</p>
<p>“They like familiarity,” she said. “If they are not happy, they’ll get into a bad mood and depression seeps in, and then you get other health issues.”</p>
<p>THE ‘CIRCUIT BREAKER’ LESSON</p>
<a>have been well documented</a>, and it was no different for Tanglin Halt residents.
<p>When CNA Insider met again with Wong in late August 2020, she had visibly lost weight. Her legs, she said, had grown even weaker after not being able to go out or attend exercise classes at FaithActs.</p>
<p>“I have nothing to do and I can’t sleep so much,” she said. After finishing her chores and eating breakfast, she struggled to fill her days and got bored, even depressed at times.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>She was not the only one. Ng knew of others who had deteriorated both physically and mentally.</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <section> <blockquote> There are cases where mentally, they’re not as good as before,” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>She said: “They’re confined alone at home and their only companion is the television and phone calls. I’m so sad to see them all deteriorating.”</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>One elderly woman with dementia at another FaithActs centre would call her just to hang up, repeatedly. Previously, the woman would send her videos periodically as assurance that she was well, Ng said.</p>
<p>“When we first told (the residents) the centre was closed, they all felt completely helpless. The main thing was fear: They want to come here because most of them live alone, and if they had problems, there’d be no one to communicate with.”</p>
<p>“And of course, the other thing is that they missed their friends.</p>
<h4> <div>Related: COVID-19 and the elderly</div> </h4>
<p>During the ‘circuit breaker’, FaithActs made meal deliveries and called up beneficiaries regularly to check on them – “panicking a bit”, she laughs, when their calls went unanswered by those who had taken their hearing aids off.</p>
<p>Those in the new estate also have the Pacific Activity Centre and Esther Seniors Activity Centre to look out for them. </p>
<p>Esther SAC told CNA Insider it offers exercise sessions, table games and language classes among other things, and manages the pullcord emergency alert system for elderly residents of some studio apartments. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ng says FaithActs plans to make transport arrangements for seniors who wish to continue visiting their centre at Commonwealth. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>VANISHING FAMILIAR FACES</p> <p>In Tanglin Halt, FaithActs wasn’t the only one looking out for elderly folks. Stallholders and shopkeepers have been doing so for decades, in this close-knit community.</p></div> </div> </div>
<h2> The history of Tanglin Halt </h2>
<p>One of Singapore’s oldest housing estates, Tanglin Halt was one of the five initial districts within Queenstown, Singapore’s first satellite new town. </p>
<p>The estate got its name from the trains that used to stop at the former KTM station located there. </p>
<p>The distinctive rows of 10-storey flats were completed between 1962 and 1963 and even feature on the back of the old one-dollar note in Singapore’s orchid series.</p>
<p>Take Alice’s Hair Beauty Shop, run by Alice Tan and open since 1976. The round table in the centre of the salon is a gathering spot for regulars to stop by, sit down for a chat, even peel beansprouts together. </p>
<p>“It’s like one family,” said Tan. “Some will even bring breakfast over for everyone to share.”</p>
<p>Then there is the Chinese medical hall which has been around since 1964. </p>
<p>Second-generation owner Jasmine Zhang says the children and even grandchildren of her regulars continue to stop by to pick up their herbs. They tell her, “You know exactly what I need, what is suitable or not suitable for me to take.”</p>
<p>Market stallholders too, are part of this kampung network. “The old folks come to connect (with us) every day,” said hawker stall assistant Loh Sau Lai. “If they don’t come for a while, I’ll get worried and start wondering why.”</p>
<h4> <div>Related: </div> </h4>
<p>Residents’ Committee (RC) member Alice Lee echoed this. “In a kampong, we feel for one another,” she said. “When you see someone every day and always greet them, then suddenly you don’t see them anymore, you will ask about them or go look for them.</p>
<p>But most of these small merchants will not be continuing with business at the new estate.</p>
<p>It came as a shock to Lee, 73, and her friend Shirley Soh when they looked at a model of the new sites and realised there was no wet market. </p>
<p>“Where can we go if there’s no market?” asked Lee, insisting that buying from a supermarket was not the same. “We are already old, it is difficult for us to travel to Ghim Moh or Redhill.”</p>
<p>They started a petition in 2015 for the wet market to move with them, submitting the signatures of 1,000 residents to the HDB and their Member of Parliament at the time, Chia Shi-Lu. </p>
<p>Many of the shopkeepers and hawkers were getting old and wanted to retire, explained Kwek Li Yong, executive director of the non-profit heritage group My Community. </p>
<p>Kwek added: “The loss of all these familiar community actors adds to the difficulty (elderly residents) face in acclimatising to their new environment." </p>
<p>And when even such nearby touchpoints vanish, that increases the risks of loneliness and social isolation.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> “Globally, the evidence is clear - social isolation and loneliness increases all types of physical and mental conditions. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>“These include hypertension, heart-related disease, diabetes, obesity, and depression. Even death,” noted Yi.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>TRYING TO STAY NEIGHBOURS </p>
<p>For the elderly, good neighbours are often the first line of defence against loneliness and helplessness.</p>
<p>Lee, who serves as RC vice-chairman, looks out for Uncle Mauricio, who is in his 80s and lives alone next door. Once, walking past, she saw that he had fallen. </p>
<p>“I called the police, called the ambulance,” she said. Now, she reminds him to keep his corridor windows open, and listens out for his footsteps which tell her that he has returned home safely.</p>
<p>Mauricio has even entrusted Lee with his house keys, after she caught him standing on plant pots outside trying to reach in through the window to unlock his door. He laughs at the memory of her scolding him in her brisk, no-nonsense manner.</p>
<p>“She’s a fairy godmother,” he said. “Everybody runs to her when they have problems.”</p>
<p>Indeed, inside Lee’s flat is a box full of keys passed to her by relatives and neighbours for safekeeping.</p>
<p>She is far from the only neighbour who is a source of support. And the HDB’s Joint Selection Scheme (JSS) allows neighbours who want to continue living near one another to jointly choose their replacement flats.</p>
<p>The Joint Selection Scheme (JSS) was introduced in 1996 for households affected by SERS, to help preserve ties between neighbours. </p>
<p>It allows up to six households to jointly select replacement flats. They may indicate their interest in doing so when they register for a replacement flat – typically several months before the selection exercise. </p>
<p>Their selection appointments would then be scheduled one after the other, so they can select flats in close proximity with each other.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what a resident who only wanted to be known as Vivien, 71, and her neighbour of 50 years did. They now live next door to each other in Dawson.</p>
<p>“The main purpose was so we could look out for each other… but in fact, they look after me,” she said. </p>
<p>“I would be very lonely.”</p>
<p>But not all residents might be aware of how the scheme works. Wong told CNA Insider she didn’t know about it.</p>
<p>Lee and five friends hoped to get flats on the same floor – but they wanted units of different sizes which the block didn’t have. (Three eventually got units in the same block, while the others, and Uncle Mauricio, got flats in the next blocks.) </p>
<p>According to HDB, 13 per cent – 434 of the 3,252 Tanglin Halt households that registered for a SERS replacement flat – applied for the JSS. </p>
<p>MINIMISING THE DISLOCATION</p>
<p>One non-profit group, My Community, had noticed how that stress of tearing up roots had affected the elderly in other relocation exercises. </p>
<p>In previous SERS exercises in Queenstown, the group had visited residents to collect their stories and artefacts. What was evident was their “very strong emotional attachment” to the place, said group leader Kwek.</p>
<p>“I was talking to a long-time resident. You don’t expect grown men to cry, but while he was recollecting his memories of the old Queenstown Town Centre, he just cried uncontrollably,” he said.</p>
<p>But volunteers also noticed that residents were very anxious about a more immediate concern – the impending move itself. They were “not clear about what’s going on”; some couldn’t read the official letters they had been sent.</p>
<p>Each household was also assigned a “Journey Manager” to guide them throughout the SERS process from start to finish.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kwek said volunteers often encountered confused elderly residents: “The most frequent questions were ‘I don’t know when I’ll be moving’ and ‘I don’t know what to do’.” </p>
<p>To give residents more support, My Community has launched a befriending scheme, called the Hello Dawson Relocation Programme, where volunteers go door to door and offer to help residents with things like reading official letters, moving and packing.</p>
<p>After the move, many have needed help settling in. Lee and RC volunteers check in on them, offering decorating or space-maximising advice, or directing them to activities where they can make new friends and reconnect with old ones. </p>
<p>The area’s new MP since July 2020, Eric Chua, says there will be “quite a bit of easing in to do” to familiarise them with the area, like “where they can relax, and the bus services they can use”. </p>
<p>The sizeable role that volunteers have been playing in the Tanglin Halt relocation exercise echoes what happened at Dakota Crescent back in 2016, when residents of the ageing rental estate were resettled at Cassia Crescent.</p>
<p>There, too, grassroots volunteers as well as a group of young heritage enthusiasts – much like My Community – were invaluable in helping the old folks who were bewildered and struggling to cope with the big move into a new environment. </p>
<p>It has led some to ask if there is a better way forward, as more estate renewal exercises loom in Singapore?</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> The Government cannot do this alone, nor can the ground do it alone,” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>said Sim Bee Hia, a grassroots leader who chaired the Dakota Crescent relocation taskforce. </p>
<p>“A resident who is forced to relocate would see the HDB officer as someone that is on the opposite site,” she added. “But when a volunteer team comes in to hold (the residents’) hands, we can help to mitigate issues.”</p>
<p>The HDB too acknowledges the need for “many helping hands”, given its own constraints on resources such as manpower, and aims to “work more closely with institutional and community partners” for future relocation exercises.</p>
<p>“We might require people who are doing this on a full-time basis, to be able to do it effectively and sustainably,” he said.</p>
<p>Assistant Professor Ng Kok Hoe of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy (LKYSPP) suggested providing volunteer groups with more support and funding. </p>
<p>“We should also be concerned about relocation for our most vulnerable citizens,” he said</p>
<p>EPILOGUE: FROM RELUCTANT, TO LOOKING FORWARD</p>
<p>For now, the COVID-19 pandemic has meant a delay to the final chapter of the Tanglin Halt story. </p>
<p>MP Chua had hoped to hold a “farewell event” early next year to give residents a sense of closure, but plans might have to wait on the easing of COVID-19 restrictions. </p>
<div> <div> <div><p>“At first, they thought they would be sad when they moved out,” Lee said. “But after applying for the flats… everyone also wants to move.</p></div> </div> </div>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Some of the old people have asked me, ‘I’m already so old, can I move there before I die?’” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Vivien too had once longed to stay on in Tanglin Halt for sentimental reasons. But after moving into her new flat at Dawson, she admits she’s changed her mind. “Everything has to come to an end,” she said. </p>
<p>“It’s a blessing that I’m here now … everything is new, and as I unpacked, I realised that I needed to throw away a lot of my things.”</p>
<p>Wong, however, is still in limbo. After recently suffering a fall, she has been living with her sister; her family plans to get her a live-in helper when she finally moves into her new flat at Margaret Drive. </p>
<p>This is the second of a two-parter looking at how the impact of relocation on the elderly can be better managed, as more estates are marked for redevelopment. Read part 1: The move from Dakota to Cassia.</p>

<h1> Once a wayward teen, this bike shop uncle turned his life around. Now he’s paying it forward </h1>
<div> <p>Melvin Lee was once in a gang and was almost expelled from school. But a police mentor believed in him and gave him a chance to succeed in life. Today, he is paying it forward through the sport of cycling.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lianne Chia </a> <a> Eileen Chew </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: For 18-year-old Chen Jun Wei, what made him fall in love with cycling was the wind in his hair, and the exhilaration of riding fast along empty roads at night.</p>
<p>But it is also an escape. He does not see much of his parents — a lorry driver and a minimart assistant. “I try my best to spend time with them, but I think they’re quite busy,” he said.</p>
<p>Almost every night, he would get on his bicycle — a gift from his parents to keep him out of trouble — and explore the roads of Singapore. He remembers one “epic” round-island ride, when he cycled from 5pm to 6am.</p>
<p>He had friends who enjoyed cycling, but he usually rode alone. Besides, he said, his friends rode mostly road bikes — faster and easier to pedal on roads and pavements — and his mountain bike could not keep up with them.</p>
<p>In July, one of them, Shaun, told him about Team Garcia, youth cyclists who took part in local competitions. It piqued his interest: Perhaps he would find new buddies to ride with — after all, it eventually got lonely riding alone.</p>
<p>He asked Shaun if he could join the team.</p>
<p>That was how he walked into a neighbourhood bicycle shop in Bishan and met the man who changed not only his life, but also the lives of others like himself through a combination of tender loving care and an opportunity.</p>
<h2>FROM GANG MEMBER TO ENGINEER</h2>
<p>The owner of RNE Bike Shop and founder of Team Garcia is 54-year-old Melvin Lee. He, too, was once a teenager lacking the care he now offers so willingly.</p>
<p>He saw his sailor father once a year, while his mother, who did odd jobs — from sewing army clothes to selling laksa on the streets — struggled to make ends meet for Lee and his two sisters.</p>
<p>Left alone at home, he roamed his Circuit Road neighbourhood, a place he describes as having been infamous for gang activity. It wasn’t long before he himself joined a gang of youths.</p>
<p>“We could bully a guy for a whole year,” he recalled. “We see you … we pull you behind, we whack you.</p>
<p>His results dropped, and he was on the verge of being expelled from school.</p>
<p>Around this time, when he was 14, a policeman approached him to join the MacPherson Boys’ Club. The police-run Boys’ Club was a network of clubhouses that gave at-risk teens a safe place to hang out in housing estates.</p>
<p>Lee agreed, drawn to the free activities and games it offered, like snooker, which he would never have got the chance to play otherwise. What made him stay on, however, were the mentors — the police officers.</p>
<p>It was tough love, he said, and they demanded respect.</p>
<p>“They always said, ‘I can handcuff you — don’t play the fool,’” he recalled. “But they cared for us. They saw that we were hungry; they’d (say), ‘Go and buy food. I’ll pay.’”</p>
<p>They sometimes insisted that he should join in events and excursions such as a trip to Haw Par Villa. “They’d say, ‘I’ve put your name down already. This is an order — you’d better come,’” he said. He never regretted going.</p>
<p>He especially clicked with one of the mentors, whom he knew as Uncle Tang. “He’s a Cantonese, I’m a Cantonese,” said Lee. “He’s very close to me.”</p>
<p>WATCH: Lessons from my mentor, who was a teenage gangster (6:52)</p>
<p>Uncle Tang “basically” brought him up, gave him “a lot of support” and even talked to his mother at times to tell her that “actually, Lee’s not so bad”.</p>
<p>“When he read the contract, he got a shock,” Lee said. Only during the signing did Uncle Tang find out that he would have to pay S$32,000 — a huge sum at the time — if Lee were to break the bond.</p>
<p>But to Lee’s relief, Uncle Tang signed the contract. “He said, ‘Ho ho zho lang (Be a good person), okay?’” Lee recounted. “Don’t let me down.”</p>
<p>With the opportunity to make a success of his life, Lee graduated with distinction and began his career as a machinist.</p>
<p>Over the years, he rose through the ranks in different companies, earned a diploma in engineering and travelled the world, helping to oversee various projects. Eventually, he started his own business in plastic injection moulding.</p>

<h2>TWO TEENS AND THEIR POTENTIAL</h2>
<p>But in 2013, Lee decided that it was time for a change. After selling his business, he was whiling away the time fishing when a friend approached him about the idea of starting a bicycle shop.</p>
<p>“Actually, I just wanted to pass the time,” he said. “Every day, I was just at the fishing pond … until one day, my wife told me I’d lose contact with the world if I kept on like that.”</p>
<p>At that time, he had no experience with bicycles beyond leisure cycling. But he learnt to service them as he went along, and began to enjoy the process. Two years later, he started his own house brand of bicycles, Garcia.</p>
<p>Then one day in 2018, two teenage boys walked into his shop in Bishan Street 12.</p>
<p>Lee immediately caught their attention, and not in a good way. “He was smoking in a corner and looked very fierce,” said Pacheco, now 21. But they were soon surprised, as he was “the friendliest uncle you could ever meet”.</p>
<p>Even though they were “noobs” who did not know their way around a bicycle shop, Lee sensed their interest as he chatted to them, so he invited them to join a leisure cycling group he and his friends had formed.</p>
<p>Over time, the relationship grew. Lee thought the boys had “potential”, and they began to spend more time with him, helping to fix customers’ bikes and learning the ropes.</p>
<p>In 2019, he thought it would be a good challenge for them to compete in the OCBC Cycle National Championships’ individual time trials.</p>
<p>He covered their competition fees and roped in a customer’s son — Ting Chun, 38, who had racing experience — to train them for free. The boys were scared but agreed.</p>
<p>They had six weeks to train, compared to the three to four months serious riders usually take. But they trained hard, and Lee told them to just do their best and “have fun”, no matter where they are placed.</p>
<p>On race day, they were a bundle of nerves.</p>
<p>But the results stunned them. Pacheco came 13th out of 18 riders, while Yanda came fourth out of 16 in a category where he was up against some national cyclists.</p>
<p>Yanda, now 20, was selected for the national development squad, which was the first step towards the goal of joining the national team.</p>
<p>He eventually dropped out, but that was when Lee realised there was potential to take the team further, and Team Garcia was officially formed.</p>
<p>As word spread, the team grew. Today, there are officially 18 riders, aged 15 to 23, including one female rider.</p>
<p>To Lee, who hopes to keep them from wayward habits, the team mission is clear: “To learn what care and love is.”</p>
<p>He also wants to help those who may not otherwise have the means to join the sport, as cycling can be an expensive hobby. A road bike with components of “reasonable” quality can cost S$3,000 to S$4,000, he noted.</p>
<p>He has poured his own money — about S$70,000 — into team assets, like bicycles and other components, to make sure that all the riders have the gear they need to participate in races.</p>
<p>Bicycles are given to those without their own, on the understanding that they will return the bikes if they leave the team.</p>
<p>For those who want to own a bicycle but cannot afford it, he would offer them one at cost price or even lower.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he said, they ask him what would happen if they do not achieve a podium finish. Would they have let him down?</p>
<p>“I always tell them, ‘If you win, take it as a bonus. If you lose, try again,’” he said. “That’s it. What we want is for you to be a good person.”</p>
<p>Some of these young riders are not close to their families, he realises after talking to them, or they come from troubled backgrounds. And his heart goes out to them.</p>
<p>Support for the team has also grown. Ting, for example, now volunteers as the team’s head coach and has never considered asking for payment.</p>
<p>“When I see the growth in the youths, that’s what pushes me to do this,” he said.</p>
<p>The same goes for the sponsors. The team’s mission has moved customers and companies alike to dip into their pockets to help fund the team.</p>
<p>“We were touched by the efforts that (Lee) put in for the kids. He's not calculative and has never asked them for anything in return - he only gives," she said. </p>
<h2>‘70 PER CENT ABOUT LIFE, 30 PER CENT ABOUT BIKING’</h2>
<p>Indeed, the character at the core of the team is Lee, or Uncle as the riders refer to him. “Without him, you can’t really call Garcia, Garcia any more,” Pacheco said.</p>
<p>Pacheco remembers being very shy when he first met Lee. But it is hard to tell he was an introvert from the way he carries himself now: With confidence as he dishes out advice to younger boys in the shop.</p>
<p>“(Uncle) told me to talk more, even at work or at school, to just go up to (people) and talk to them if you want to talk to them,” said the young man. “He’s basically like a consultant.”</p>
<p>Over the years, Pacheco has noticed how Lee has an intuitive way of getting the riders, especially newbies, to open up to him. And the advice he gives them is “70 per cent about life, 30 per cent about biking”.</p>
<p>“That’s what has made this team a bit more family oriented,” Pacheco added. “We have that sense of belonging here.”</p>
<p>He himself asks Lee for advice on anything from relationships to finances. “I was wishy-washy in secondary school and had no idea what I wanted to do,” he said. “But Uncle gave me the spark to be in business.”</p>
<p>He is now studying accounting at the Institute of Technical Education. In his free time, he helps to build bicycle wheels for a business Lee started with him and two others.</p>
<p>He also mentors other boys like Chen, who is now the proud owner of a Garcia road bike in black and purple.</p>
<p>Chen’s parents chipped in about S$500 of the S$3,000 cost, and the teen worked as a warehouse assistant almost every day for two months to pay the rest. Lee sold him the bike at almost cost price, he recalled.</p>
<p>At that time, he had known Lee for only a month. Chen still remembers what Uncle told him when he was presented with the bike: “Just (take a) whack.”</p>
<p>Chen has since taken a firm whack at it. The team trains Thursdays and Saturdays, and he never misses a session.</p>
<p>In his free time, he still rides alone, enjoying the speed of his new bike and practising the skills he has learnt from the team.</p>
<p>Like in making uphill climbs. On one training ride, the team took him to Mount Faber, and he remembers laughing on the way up when most of his teammates dropped behind.</p>
<p>“I felt like it was easy for me, but I looked back and saw that most of them were struggling. It was quite funny,” he said. “I felt like I had a lot of power."</p>
<p>He is always happy to lend his teammates a hand, and he knows how to repair bicycles now.</p>
<p>He also loves his bike — that is clear from the careful way he wipes it down and his detailed explanation of how he services it. “It’s like my girlfriend,” he said with a grin.</p>
<p>Today, he dreams of representing the country, or riding in Europe. And on the career front, he wants “to be the best engineer (he) can be”.</p>
<p>His newfound confidence comes not only from the team but from Lee, who has nudged him out of his shell.</p>
<p>“I always tell him, talk more. The more you hide, the more you suffer. Maybe when you talk, somebody can help you,” said Lee.</p>
<p>In a few short months, Chen even began mentoring new boys, teaching them how to ride as a team.</p>
<p>“I’m so proud of him,” said Lee. “He used to tell me he was very weak and couldn’t keep up with the team, but now he has that ambition to represent Singapore."</p>
<p>Seeing that youths like Chen have blossomed in his care — as he did at the Boys’ Club — he knows he is leaving a legacy.</p>
<p>And just as he keeps in touch with his old mentor, Uncle Tang, he hopes the boys will stay in touch with him, even if they become rich and famous.</p>
<p>“I always tell my boys, (when) you’re famous and successful, you must remember Uncle,” he said with a chuckle. “Whoever can be a minister, please take a picture with me.”</p>
<p>To him, there is no limit to what they can achieve.</p>
