<div><div><h3><div>How can parents prepare their kids to wear a mask?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Practice is crucial, especially if young children are new to face coverings. Because the CDC <a>says</a> not to put masks on kids younger than 2 — but 2-year-olds have to wear them on planes — the learning curve could be steep.</p>
<p>For kids 2 and older, wearing a face covering is “one level of protection from covid,” she said: “Especially for kids who have not been able to get vaccinated yet, that’s one of the best ways to prevent infection.”</p>
<div><div><p>In preparation for travel, she said, parents should start getting young children ready a month or two before a trip. She said even mature 18-month-olds can start to practice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said parents should also provide ways for kids to keep their hands busy so they don’t try to remove the mask: tape, stickers, crayons, even sticky notes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hassan, whose son is now 3, recommended finding a mask that is comfortable and has a cool design that the child will like. The family also wears masks regularly in their daily life.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s really just about practice,” he said.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><h1>Travelers are confessing to using fake vaccine cards to their travel advisers</h1></div><h2>They’re not being shy about it, either </h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 18, 2021 at 4:34 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>A travel adviser, once known as a travel agent, can easily become a client’s confidant over years of trip planning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You have no idea,” St. Louis-based travel adviser and practicing attorney Robert Merlin said of the intimate details clients share with him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In between the “I think my wife is leaving me” texts to mentions of rehab and fertility treatments, Merlin received a new kind of confession: A prospective client wanted to use a fake vaccination card to travel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Merlin told the woman that using a fake vaccination card was a crime — one he would not help her commit.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Two travelers submitted fake vaccination cards before flying to Toronto. Each was fined nearly $16,000.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m not willing to lose my job or career for somebody’s vacation,” Merlin said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Travelers using fake vaccination cards have made headlines since vaccinations ramped up around the world, from the woman in <a>Hawaii with Moderna misspelled</a> on her card to <a>two travelers who tried to enter Canada</a> with fakes.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Ocean Reef Club travel adviser <a>Stephanie Fisher</a> said she has had three people ask her about using fake vaccination cards. She declined to book their trips.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s not something I’m willing to touch,” Fisher said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Instead of being shy about the admission, Fisher said, the prospective clients have seemed proud. “There’s a weird glee about trying to find a way to short-circuit the system,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Federal agents seize thousands of fake covid vaccination cards destined for locations across U.S.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It definitely puts me in an uncomfortable position,” the adviser said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Agnos says it’s common to hear of people getting fake cards in South Florida, where she splits her time between <a>Athens</a>. Her client told her it was easy to get one and planned on getting another.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Clients aren’t always as clear with their admissions.</p></div></div>
<a>Raoul Fokke</a>, an Amsterdam-based travel adviser for Act of Travel, was meeting with a prospective client in-person to get a better sense of his interests and travel style. The Dutch traveler, who wanted to take a trip either to
<a>Dubai</a>, Portugal or Italy, told Fokke that while he didn’t want to get vaccinated, he had someone who could arrange documents to bypass travel restrictions.
<div><p>Fully vaccinated travelers can come to the U.S. even if their doses are mixed, authorities say</p></div>
<div><div><p>While the man was understanding about the reaction, Fokke said, he decided to pursue another adviser for his travel needs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Not all clients take their business elsewhere after a travel adviser refuses to book their trip.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Juliana Mulholland</a>, who plans travel for wealthy clients, sees herself as more of a travel fixer than a travel adviser, and she has a reputation for making the impossible happen. Her clients tend to get what they want.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No one says no to these people,” said Mulholland, a former lawyer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But earlier this year, she did have to say no to a client who asked Mulholland if she could get her a fake vaccination card.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was out of the question from the get-go,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The client didn’t push back and dropped the subject. Mulholland said she reminded her that not being immunized would keep interfering with her travel, and the client ended up getting vaccinated.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>Your guide to safer holiday travel</h1><h2>Crowded airports and gatherings are back this season. Our interactive guide will help you navigate them as safely as possible. </h2></div></header>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Hannah Sampson</div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Dec. 8, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>[Send us your holiday travel questions for our live chat on Nov. 11 ]</p>
<p>The CDC said in April that those who are fully vaccinated may travel once again. That came with new warnings amid the delta surge this summer, but health experts are optimistic about holiday travel if you’re vaccinated.</p>
<p>“I think both the combination of boosters and most children being able to have a vaccination by December certainly does make it safer,” said Joseph Khabbaza, a critical-care medicine specialist at Cleveland Clinic.</p>
<p><i>[</i><a><i>What 5 health experts say about holiday travel this year</i></a><i>]</i></p>
<p>“If you’re unvaccinated, my good faith advice is please stay at home for everyone’s sake,” said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of population health and disease prevention at University of California at Irvine.</p>
<h3>Are you eligible for a booster shot?</h3>
<div><p>This questionnaire will help you figure out if you’re eligible.</p></div>
<h3>What is the vaccination status of people you’re visiting?</h3>
<b> </b>Althoff also encourages making modifications, like spending time outdoors together or maintaining social distance.
<h3>Who are you traveling with?</h3>
<p><i>[</i><a><i>Should you travel with kids during the pandemic? Consider these 6 trip scenarios.</i></a><i>]</i></p>
<p>The CDC ranks types of travel for families with unvaccinated kids by describing what is safer, less safe and what people should avoid.</p>
<p>If plans call for gathering with other households, getting together outside is better — even if everyone is vaccinated.</p>
<p>Anyone who is immunocompromised or otherwise at high risk of severe disease from the coronavirus should get a third shot or booster before traveling. The CDC says people in this group should talk to their health-care providers.</p>
<p>The public health agency says that if they do travel, immunocompromised people should take the precautions that are recommended for unvaccinated people, regardless of their vaccination status.</p>
<p>That includes wearing a well-fitting mask, keeping a distance of six feet from people outside their household, washing their hands and avoiding crowds and poorly ventilated spaces.</p>
<p>Make sure you are fully vaccinated before traveling; get the booster shot if you’re eligible.</p>
<h3>Are you flying or driving?</h3>
<p><i>[</i><a><i>Flying during the pandemic? Don’t forget about the risks at the airport.</i></a><i>]</i></p>
<p>Experts say passengers should avoid eating or drinking on a plane, which would require them to remove their masks, if possible.</p>
<p>If you’re renting a car, don’t wait to make reservations. A rental car shortage that has caused long lines, low availability and high prices since early this year is expected to be an issue this holiday season.</p>
<p>Just like any road trip since the beginning of the pandemic, pack protective gear, hand sanitizer and food, and try to minimize interaction during stops.</p>
<p>Not sure if masks are required (or recommended)? The CDC says masks should be worn indoors in public places in areas where transmission is substantial or high. The agency publishes county-level data with that information.</p>
<b> </b>Travelers should treat shared spaces in hotels as they would other public places and take coronavirus precautions accordingly, such as masking in elevators and busy hotel lobbies.
<p>Because we know spread of the virus is more of a threat from human interaction than surfaces, Baktari says vaccinated travelers shouldn’t go overboard with sanitizing their travel accommodations.</p>
<h3>Are you traveling domestically or internationally?</h3>
<b> </b>said the number one precaution people can take before traveling for the holidays is getting vaccinated (and boosted if you’re eligible). The second-best practice is to be masked while on transit.
<p><i>[</i><a><i>You asked: Where can I find a coronavirus test in a foreign country?</i></a><i>]</i></p>
<p>Before you fly back to the United States, you’ll have to take a coronavirus test, regardless of your vaccination status. As of Dec. 6, all travelers must get a test within a day of their return.</p>
<p>If you test positive abroad, you will be denied entry to the United States until you can test negative. You may want to purchase travel insurance ahead of your trip in case you have to stay abroad longer or need medical care.</p>
<h3>Are you getting tested for travel?</h3>
<p>Unvaccinated people should get a coronavirus test one to three days ahead of their trip, and three to five days after their trip, according to CDC guidance.</p>
<p><i>[</i><a><i>Your vacation is around the corner. But first: time to scramble for a coronavirus test.</i></a><i>]</i></p>
<p>If you’re unvaccinated, you may want to rethink your plans and consider testing ahead of and after your trip, per CDC guidance.</p>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Africa</a></div></div><div><h1>Frustrated by vaccine inequity, a South African lab rushes to replicate Moderna’s shot</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Lesley Wroughton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 28, 2021 at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Afrigen Biologics and Vaccines is racing to make a vaccine because, despite donation pledges, supply is short and just 6 percent of Africa’s 1.2 billion people have been inoculated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What’s missing is the vaccine formula. Moderna refuses to share its recipe, citing intellectual property, so Afrigen has used publicly available information and help from outside advisers to begin making the vaccine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If Moderna were to share information, Afrigen Managing Director Petro Terblanche said, the company could produce a replica within a year. Without it, the time estimate balloons to three years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It will be an interesting debate when we get to Phase 3, and we have a vaccine ready for low-income countries,” she said, “and Moderna says, ‘No, you can’t proceed.’”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why Africa is perilously far behind on coronavirus vaccination</p></div>
<div><div><p>Now, with the genetic sequence for the vaccine in hand, the Afrigen team is preparing to develop the first complete lab sample, which they will then compare to Moderna’s version.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s like saying you know how to make a loaf of bread but you are now asked to set up a process to make 100,000 loaves per day,” Friede said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Afrigen is working toward creating a vaccine that is less expensive than Moderna’s and will not require <a>freezing in storage</a> — both essential for widespread distribution in poorer countries.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“All eyes are on us,” said Caryn Fenner, Afrigen’s technical director. “If one really thinks about the bigness of it and its significance, it almost cripples you.”</p></div></div>
<a>temporarily waive intellectual property rights</a> on coronavirus vaccines and therapies or find a way to allow developing countries to access the technologies. The meeting has been postponed because of the omicron variant. No new date has been set.
<div><p>A scientific hunch. Then silence. Until the world needed a lifesaving vaccine.</p></div>
<a>struggled to access enough supplies</a> during the pandemic.
<div><div><p>The solution, said Friede of the WHO, is for African countries to make the vaccines themselves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Right now the process isn’t moving,” Okonjo-Iweala said in an interview. “This is a pandemic. If we can’t come to a meeting of minds now, then we will miss the timing.”</p></div></div>
<p>The concern with a waiver, Kieny said, is what happens once the pandemic ends. Any broader waiver agreed on at the WTO talks would likely have a time limit, she said, without a commitment from the drugmakers to enter into licensing agreements.</p>
<div><div><p>She said companies should negotiate now with drugmakers such as Moderna to reach formal licensing agreements before the pandemic is over.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Friede acknowledged that any company that takes the Afrigen vaccine to commercial production may need a license from Moderna once the U.S. drugmaker’s waiver expires.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even if there is a deal at the WTO meeting, Okonjo-Iweala said it would take several years for manufacturers in Africa and elsewhere to build capacity to make their own vaccines.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When we are talking about manufacturing in Africa, we are really thinking of the medium to longer term — for the next pandemic, that is,” she said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>NAIROBI — South Africa’s huge wave of omicron cases appears to be subsiding just as quickly as it grew in the weeks after the country first announced to the world that a new coronavirus variant had been identified.</p></div></div>
<p>On Monday, the United States’ top infectious-disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, said the Biden administration was considering lifting those travel restrictions, given that community spread of the variant was occurring in many countries.</p>
<a>earlier findings</a> from the country that omicron was causing fewer hospitalizations and instances of severe side effects than previous coronavirus variants.
<div><p>Omicron variant more resistant to vaccine but causes less severe covid, major South African study concludes</p></div>
<div><div><p>The <a>study found</a> that the omicron variant was 80 percent less likely to lead to hospitalization than the delta variant and that for patients who were hospitalized, the risk of severe illness was 30 percent lower.</p></div></div>
<p>“In South Africa, variants, even highly mutated ones, will run out of people pretty quickly,” he said. “Pretty much by the end of last week it was running out of steam; there just aren’t enough people left to infect.”</p>
<div><div><p>Karim noted that omicron accounted for nearly every new coronavirus case in South Africa last week. Recent data from the United States showed that more than 70 percent of new U.S. cases were caused by the variant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden administration officials have closely studied the South Africa data, looking for clues about omicron case growth and the severity of infections, said three officials involved with the U.S. coronavirus response.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Data from South Africa is critical. Data from South Africa, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and New York paint a more complete picture,” said an official who was not authorized to comment on the record.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Since South African scientists announced the detection of the omicron variant less than a month ago, European governments have imposed new restrictions, in part because most of the data and research on omicron is so new and unproved.</p></div>
<a>scientists warned</a> that without stricter measures, infections
<b> </b>could reach 600,000 to 2 million cases a day by the end of this month.
<a>also has experienced a massive rise in case numbers</a>, unlike in previous waves. Scientists say this is due in part to omicron’s higher transmissibility.

<div><div><p>The relaxation of pandemic control measures is unlikely to lead to a “dramatic” spike in infections even if the decline in cases slows, said Bennett, the Australian expert.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The restrictions will apply to travelers from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi. They do not apply to American citizens and lawful permanent residents, the official said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If you have not gotten vaccinated, or have not taken your children to get vaccinated, now is the time,” Biden said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The White House arranged a meeting Friday between U.S. and South African doctors to learn more about the variant that is spreading in that region, Fauci said in an interview on CNN “New Day.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We want to find out scientist-to-scientist exactly what is going on,” Fauci said of the meeting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fauci said the new variant has “some mutations” that “are raising some concern,” including “with regard to possibly transmissibility increase and possibly evasion of immune response.”</p></div></div>
<p>On Friday, <a>the stock market tumbled</a>, with the Dow Jones falling more than 900 points on concerns about the new variant, its worst day of the year thus far at the close. The SP 500 was also down by more than 2.2 percent at the close.</p>
<div><div><p>Biden told reporters the market activity was “expected” and typical after bad coronavirus news and that he was “not at all” worried about the drop.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden in his Friday statement said the new variant underscored the need for other countries to do more to increase global vaccinations, including by waiving intellectual property restrictions that hamper production.</p></div></div>

<p>On Friday, the World Health Organization declared the mutation-laden virus a “variant of concern” after a full-day review by the group’s scientists and dubbed it the “omicron” variant, named for a Greek letter.</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s too early to know the effectiveness of current vaccines against the new variant,” said Bruce Gellin, a vaccine expert and chief of global public health strategy at the Rockefeller Foundation.</p></div></div>
<p>Scientists in South Africa convened a news conference Thursday and said they had linked omicron to an exponential rise of infections in the country. Cases have also been identified in Belgium, Botswana, Hong Kong, Israel and other countries.</p>
<div><div><p>The World Trade Organization <a>postponed its first ministerial meeting </a>in four years because of the deteriorating health situation, Reuters reported.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Britain, Canada, France, Israel and Japan began to ban or order quarantines for air passengers arriving from the southern African region. European Union countries agreed Friday to ban air travel from seven southern African countries.</p></div>

<div><div><p>Chief among experts’ concerns is whether coronavirus vaccines will prove less powerful against omicron — and whether they could be adapted to target the new variant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement, Pfizer and BioNTech said the companies expect to have data within two weeks that will provide more information on whether omicron may require an adjustment to the companies’ coronavirus vaccine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The omicron variant, Moderna said, carries a combination of mutations that poses a “significant potential risk” to both natural and vaccine-induced immunity.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Gellin said U.S. regulators have “not yet mapped the process they would use to make adjustments to coronavirus vaccines.” But small clinical trials would probably be needed to ensure that changes had the effect desired.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Food and Drug Administration is familiar with updating vaccines, Gellin said, and has a long track record of approving flu vaccines to “match” the viruses in circulation every year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no reason why future boosters should not be updated to match the most common strain” of the coronavirus, said John Brownstein, chief innovation officer at Boston Children’s Hospital.</p></div></div>
<a>ramping up its monitoring</a> of variants several months ago, made wary by the delta variant’s destructive sweep across India and the continent’s low vaccination rates, which some officials blamed on “
<a>vaccine hoarding</a>” by wealthier countries. In South Africa, just 25 percent of the population is
<a>vaccinated, </a>and officials said the vast majority of people hospitalized continue to be unvaccinated.
<div><p>But South African health officials decried the world’s reaction as unjustified, saying South Africa should not be “punished” for making this discovery, particularly because the variant’s origin remains unknown.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control offered a <a>new threat assessment </a>Friday noting the distinct possibility that the new variant will spread.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We just don’t know,” said Brownstein, who emphasized the importance of waiting for research.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not all mutations are good for the virus,” Ko said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Massimo Ciccozzi, head of the molecular epidemiology unit at the Rome-based University Campus Bio-Medico, described omicron as “a greatest hits compilation of all mutations from other variants, within one lineage.”</p></div></div>
<p>Ciccozzi, who speculated that the package of mutations may be due to long-term treatment of a single immunocompromised patient, noted one bright spot. Unlike delta, omicron is detectable through the normal procedures used with other variants.</p>
<div><div><p>“The molecular test detects it,” Ciccozzi said. “Which is very important because it just won’t go unnoticed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Britain maintains a world-class system of laboratories to detect and study the genomes of coronavirus variants and modeling groups that forecast potential spread. The southern African strain has not been found in Britain.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Israel imposed a travel ban covering most of Africa after the detection of the new variant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are currently on the verge of a state of emergency,” Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What’s interesting is the policies,” said Ko, the Yale epidemiologist, noting how the coronavirus has consistently beaten global responses. “Are any of these policies going to help?”</p></div></div>

<a>vaccinated</a> but can’t — such as
<a>people who are allergic</a> to vaccine components or had severe allergic reactions after getting a first shot.
<div><p>What to do if your flight is delayed or canceled</p></div>
<div><p>The first question to ask yourself is whether your upcoming trip is absolutely necessary, says <a>LetsGetChecked</a> chief medical officer Robert Mordkin. Can you delay a month or at least a few weeks until the current surge <a>wanes?</a></p></div>
<div><div><p>If the trip can’t wait, consider driving to your destination. You will be better able to control your environment and social distance from other people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not traveling is choice number one. Traveling by car is choice number two,” says Katie Passaretti, medical director of infection prevention of health-care company <a>Atrium Health</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California at Irvine, agrees — to an extent.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The best travel advice of 2021, from By The Way Concierge</p></div>
<div><div><p>Step one: Get a good <a>mask</a> and make sure it fits correctly. Madad suggests an N95, KN95 or KN94 mask for travelers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because everyone has a unique face shape, Noymer says you may need to purchase multiple mask options from different brands to find one that seals your nose and mouth the best.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The airline lost your luggage. Now what?</p></div>
<div><div><p>While traveling, refrain from taking off the mask in shared public spaces, Madad says. If you need to eat or drink something, she recommends finding a less crowded place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Passaretti also recommends booking a <a>window seat</a>, where you will be farther from passengers walking up and down the aisles, and turning on the overhead air vent to improve the air flow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These tips are, of course, in addition to coronavirus-prevention basics such as cleaning your hands often and social distancing from people when possible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finally, it may be worth having another conversation with your doctor about your vaccination status.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mordkin recommends confirming with your physician that you are still not a candidate for coronavirus vaccination, as it remains the most effective defense against severe illness or death from a covid-19 infection.</p></div></div>

<a>pressed</a> the White House to more aggressively help to vaccinate the world, saying that too little has been done to tamp down the risk of virus variants emerging abroad.
<div><div><p>The Biden administration also has been widely criticized for failing to move faster to acquire and distribute hundreds of millions of rapid coronavirus tests, <a>passing on opportunities</a> last year to do so.</p></div></div>
<p>In interviews, the advisers said that Biden officials faced considerable challenges in trying to both execute a pandemic strategy and plan for the future, adding that their recommendations were meant to complement the administration’s efforts.</p>

<a>90 percent of school staff</a> are fully vaccinated, indoor masking is required and the city is

<a>Missouri</a> have shown that even when community infection rates are high, there was minimal school-related transmission in districts that implemented protective measures.

<div><div><div>By Brittany Shammas2:38 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<div><div><p>Omicron is unlikely to be the coronavirus’s last variant of concern, World Health Organization officials said Thursday, noting the virus will continue to mutate as it circulates.</p></div></div>
<p>Speaking during a news briefing, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said there is “still a lot of energy in this virus.” When the delta variant emerged, he said, some scientists wondered how it could adapt further when it had become so fit.</p>
<div><div><p>“And yet, we’ve seen a further variant emerge that is even more transmissible than delta, which was itself more transmissible than previous variants,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging-disease and zoonosis unit, said the question is what kinds of mutations happen in the future — and what their effect on the severity of the virus will be.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no inevitability that the next variant will be less severe or more severe,” she said. “We just have to see what happens as this virus evolves.”</p></div></div>

<p>More than 4,000 children were hospitalized with covid-19 across the nation Wednesday, Washington Post figures show, marking a new high that towers above previous peaks set during the summer when the delta variant was driving up infections.</p>
<div><p>The tally, which includes confirmed as well as suspected pediatric covid-19 patients, reflects a steep rise in infections in that group. Less than two weeks ago, on Christmas, fewer than 2,000 children were in hospitals with covid. </p></div>
<div><div><p>The seven-day average of pediatric hospitalizations was slightly lower at 3,713. Hospitalizations of adults are also rising rapidly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, patients who have been more recently infected appear less likely to be hospitalized or put in intensive care, according to preliminary studies.</p></div></div>

<a>a recent study</a> done by researchers from Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine.
<div><div><p>But even with less severe symptoms, the increase in the number of covid-19 patients can still overwhelm hospitals and result in more patients with serious illness, <a>health experts say.</a></p></div></div>

<div>1042 Cutler Street, right, in Schenectady.</div>
<div> <div> By Eli Saslow </div> <div>May 1, 2021</div> </div>
<p>Budhoo parked in front and flipped through his receipts. The tenant owed more than $12,000, and on the porch Budhoo saw a pile of warnings and eviction notices dating back almost a year.</p>
<p>“No more grace periods,” read one from last fall. “Pay now or leave.”</p>
<p>“Just a friendly reminder,” he’d written to the tenant, after the first missed payment in April 2020.</p>
<p>“Good morning! Are you able to pay rent?” he’d written after the second month.</p>
<p>“Please. I am willing to work with you,” he wrote after the government announced its first national eviction moratorium in September.</p>
<p>“Really? You’re still not going to pay ANYTHING?” he wrote after he read about the billions of government dollars being spent in rental assistance, for which his tenant never applied.</p>
<p>“This is robbery,” Budhoo had written. “What you’re doing now is stealing from me."</p>

<p>“Look, I don’t want to be living here, either,” Hill had told Budhoo at one point, but he also believed the pandemic had given him no choice.</p>

<p>“He’s basically the exterminator and we’re the rats. Do you understand that?”</p>
<p>“Kind of,” she said. “I guess so.”</p>
<p>“What I’m saying is he wants to get rid of us. It doesn’t matter what we’re dealing with. We’re not human to him. We’re money. It’s all a big game.”</p>
<p>“I need some air,” he told his daughter, and he grabbed a beer and headed back outside.</p>

<p>A few more cans on his porch. More trash littered across his yard. Budhoo stopped at 1042 Cutler the next morning to survey the latest insults to his house, and then he took out his cellphone and dialed a number for “Julie Eviction.”</p>
<p>“Can we meet?” he asked. “There must be something I can do.”</p>
<p>“The word is out,” she said. “I’m a shark with no teeth.”</p>
<p>“So that’s it?” Budhoo said. “We’re powerless?”</p>
<p>“That’s not how the city sees it,” she said. “You’re the landlord, remember? You’re the villain. You’re greedy. You’re trying to put a helpless family out on the streets.”</p>
<p>“This house is slowly killing me,” he said.</p>
<p>“Have you thought about trading cash for keys?”</p>
<p>“What?” he asked, and Horn explained a strategy that was becoming popular among landlords in Schenectady. They offered to pay delinquent tenants more than $500 in cash and forgive all overdue rent if the tenant agreed to move out.</p>
<p>“That’s crazy,” Budhoo said. “I don’t have any more money to waste. I’d rather walk off a bridge. I’m serious. I’d just as soon commit suicide.”</p>
<p>She looked at the file and flipped through the paperwork. “Could you sell?” she asked. “Get what you can and then pay down your debts?”</p>
<p>“Maybe if I’m lucky I’d break even and get back to zero,” Budhoo said. “And then what? I put my whole life into this business. It’s all I have. I’d be erasing 20 years.”</p>

<p>Now those same landlords were operating at a loss, and the city was trying to survive its own pandemic budget crisis by increasing their trash fees and raising property taxes for the first time in five years.</p>
<p>“We saved this city, and now we need help and get nothing,” said Mohamed Hafez, a landlord who was out more than $20,000 in rent.</p>
<p>“I’m broke. I’m eating from the food pantry,” said another.</p>
<p>“Where does it stop? I’ve heard people say: ‘Housing is a basic right. Cancel rent forever.’”</p>
<p>“Why don’t the grocery stores just start giving away food?” Hafez said.</p>
<p>“When you kick a dog, eventually it’s going to bite,” one of the landlords said.</p>
<p>“That guy’s a hero,” said another.</p>
<p>“The whole system crashes down,” he said.</p>
<p>“And we’re going down with it,” Budhoo said.</p>

<p>A woman was throwing clothing out of a house and onto the lawn. She carried a chair down the front stairs and put in on the sidewalk. It looked to Budhoo like an eviction, so he drove closer, parked and walked up to the house.</p>
<p>“Are you the landlord?” he asked the woman, and she nodded.</p>
<p>“Wow. Congratulations,” he said, gesturing at the trash piled up on the sidewalk. “I’ve been trying to get one of my houses back for more than a year. How’d you do it?”</p>
<p>“It’s not what you think,” the landlord said. “I didn’t evict. They just left.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, come on,” Budhoo said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been lucky,” she said. “I only rent to good people, and most have paid. It seems like every other landlord is going under, but I’m actually trying to invest. I’m looking to buy.”</p>
<p>Budhoo helped her pick up trash bags and then tossed them into an industrial dumpster.</p>
<p>“I might have an opportunity for you,” he said, already feeling defeated by what he was about to suggest. “You know 1042 Cutler? It’s a good house. I can give you a good price.”</p>

<div> <div> <p>A pandemic year</p> <h1>How the pandemic is reshaping education</h1> </div> </div>
<div> <div> By Donna St. George, Valerie Strauss, Laura Meckler, Joe Heim, Hannah Natanson </div> <div>March 15, 2021</div> </div>
<p>A year later, a rethinking is underway, with a growing sense that some changes may last.</p>
<p> <i>[<a>Parents and teachers: How are your kids handling school during the pandemic?</a>]</i> </p>
<h4>Remote learning keeps going</h4>
<p>School systems in America are not done with remote learning.</p>
<p>After a year when some systems did nothing but school by computer screen, it has become clear that learning virtually has a place in the nation’s schools, if simply as an option.</p>
<p>Few suggest that remote learning is for everyone. The pandemic showed, unmistakably, that most students learn best in person — in a three-dimensional world, led by a teacher, surrounded by classmates and activities.</p>
<p> <i>[<a>Do you have questions about how D.C.-area school systems are returning kids to the classroom? Ask The Post.</a>]</i> </p>
<p>But school systems across the country are looking at remote learning as a way to meet diverse needs — for teenagers who have jobs, children with certain medical conditions, or kids who prefer learning virtually.</p>
<p>It has also emerged as a way to expand access to less-common courses. If one high school offers a class in Portuguese, students at another school could join it remotely.</p>
<p>To make it work, some of the system’s teachers would only be remote. Parent interest was one impetus for the program.</p>
<p>In the Washington region, suburban Montgomery County is exploring the creation of a virtual academy for full-time online instruction. Parents have advocated for a program for some time, said Gboyinde Onijala, a spokeswoman.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has helped us see that it is possible and can be done well,” she said.</p>
<p>Not everyone imagines the same path forward.</p>
<p>“Staring at a screen all day is not optimal,” Weingarten said. “Zoom fatigue is real.”</p>
<a>spike in failing grades</a> for
<a>the most vulnerable students</a> in some areas, including English language learners. And across the country an unprecedented number of students have gone off the radar even as
<a>schools try to track them down.</a>
<p>Katie McIntyre, a mother of two in Damascus, Md., said that for her family, virtual classes were “wonderful experiences” — especially for her 10-year-old daughter who has autism and is gifted. Teachers have gone above and beyond.</p>
<p>“If I had any opportunity to do this again, I would,” she said.</p>
<h4>Schools set to attack lost learning</h4>
<p>What’s more, some believe that once this infrastructure is in place, it could last for years, especially if it shows results.</p>
<p> <i>[<a>'A lost generation’: Surge of research reveals students sliding backward, most vulnerable worst affected</a>]</i> </p>
<p>They are also rethinking what the great catch-up should look like, with many shifting the focus from remediation to acceleration, or what’s sometimes called “accelerated learning.”</p>
<p>So if a child is behind in reading, he might be given the grade-level text along with tools to make it more accessible, such as a plot summary or a list of characters, or perhaps the audiobook version.</p>
<p>That’s the approach that Alabama is encouraging for its districts, said Eric Mackey, the state’s schools superintendent.</p>
<p>“We are afraid that when we come back, many of our students are going to be way behind,” Mackey said. “Even if we said, ‘We just need to catch them up to where we were,’ where we were isn’t good enough.”</p>
<p>He said there is simply not enough time for teachers to make up all the lost material. Reteaching is unrealistic, so he is recommending that schools try accelerated learning.</p>
<p>“It’s a shift for most of our districts,” he said. “It’s something that everybody wants to do, but in the past we’ve had neither the time nor resources to really do that.”</p>
<h3>When students struggle</h3>
<h4>More support for mental health</h4>
<p>The mental health struggles of the nation’s schoolchildren will outlast the pandemic, and so too will school districts’ efforts to meet the far-reaching need.</p>
<p>A year into the pandemic, counselors and others in mental health report an increasing number of students who are depressed or anxious. Hoover says that 75 percent of students who get mental health services get them at school.</p>
<p>With the need so great, she expects schools to hire more staff and to forge partnerships with community mental health providers. In many cases, therapists are based at schools, working with students and families on campus.</p>
<p>“I think we will see more of this,” said Hoover, who once worked as a school-based therapist in Baltimore public schools.</p>
