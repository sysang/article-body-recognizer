<p>Podcaster Joe Rogan recently suggested that Michelle Obama could be elected president in 2024, adding his voice to long-running speculation about the former first lady's future.</p>
<p>Obama, who is married to former President <a>Barack Obama</a>, has often been talked about as a potential presidential candidate, but she has never publicly expressed an interest in running.</p>
<p>Rogan told listeners of the Joe Rogan Experience on Christmas Eve: "I really believe if Michelle Obama runs, she wins." But there is as yet no indication that she wants to return to the <a>White House</a>.</p>
<p>"She's great, she's intelligent, she's articulate, she's the wife of the best president that we have had in our lifetime in terms of like a representative of intelligent articulate people," Rogan said, according to TheWrap.</p>
<p>That view is certainly shared by Michelle Obama's admirers and many Americans, as the former first lady has been <a>voted the most admired woman in the U.S.</a> three years in a row.</p>
<p>A YouGov poll published on December 14 surveyed 42,000 people in 38 countries and found that Michelle Obama topped the list of most admired women yet again. 71 percent of respondents said they admired her the most.</p>
<a>Kamala Harris</a> came second with 6 percent—she had not yet become vice president at that time.
<p>That was also the third year in a row that Michelle Obama had topped the Gallup poll of most admired women, but polling on the specific question of her running for office is limited.</p>
<p>The former first lady has never held public office or expressed a desire to run, and that may account for why there is little polling on the possibility of her running for president.</p>
<p>However, a Hill-HarrisX poll conducted from November 18 to 19 showed that <a>Michelle Obama would be a leading contender</a> for the <a>Democratic</a> presidential nomination if President <a>Joe Biden</a> does not seek reelection.</p>
<a>Pete Buttigieg</a> as well as Sens.
<a>Beto O'Rourke</a> and former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan.
<p>Betfair gives Harris better odds at 5/1 and Biden at 4/1, although Michelle Obama does enjoy slightly better odds than Sanders, who stands at 33/1. Warren's odds are 35/1.</p>
<p>President Biden has said <a>he intends to run</a> for another term in 2024, but if that situation changes for any reason, Michelle Obama could be a strong contender, and her name could start appearing in presidential polling more regularly.</p>

<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Joe Rogan Says Michelle Obama Could Beat Donald Trump in 2024 Presidential Election</h1><div> By Katherine Fung <time>On 12/29/21 at 11:38 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Popular podcast host Joe Rogan thinks former first lady Michelle Obama would beat former President <a>Donald Trump</a> in a 2024 presidential election match-up if she decided to run for the White House.</p>
<p>During an episode of The Joe Rogan Experience released on Christmas Eve, Rogan said: "I really believe, if Michelle Obama runs, she wins."</p>
<p>"She's intelligent, she's articulate, she's the wife of the best president that we have had in our lifetime in terms of like a representative of intelligent, articulate people. She could win," the podcaster said of Obama.</p>
<p>Rogan said the only thing that would get in the way of a potential victory for the former first lady would be if she "bought into some of these policies that are destroying businesses in America, that are making people scared."</p>
<p>"If she somehow or another supported or showed any support for lockdowns and mandates and all this craziness that's going on," he explained.</p>
<a>Kamala Harris</a> on the presidential ticket for a "double dose of diversity," adding that Trump and Republican Florida Governor
<a>Ron DeSantis</a> could also form a "super team" against the Democrat pair.
<p>"They have to make a super team. That's the only way they win," Rogan said on his show.</p>
<p>Previously, Rogan had predicted that Trump would likely win a 2024 bid for presidency if up against a reelection campaign from President <a>Joe Biden</a>.</p>
<p>When asked during a September episode of his podcast whether or not he thought Trump would run again, Rogan said: "He's gonna 100 percent try. He's probably gonna win."</p>
<a>Democrats</a> f***ed up royally by making that guy the president."
<p>So far, Obama has not signaled that she plans to run in 2024. But a poll conducted by The Hill-HarrisX last month showed that she would be a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination should Biden not seek reelection.</p>
<p>Last week, the president confirmed that he would run again if he remains in "good health," adding that a Trump 2024 campaign would only "increase the prospect."</p>
<p>"If I'm in the health I'm in now—I'm in good health—then, in fact, I would run again," the president told <a>ABC</a> News last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trump has not yet officially announced whether or not he will run for president again but has teased a challenge to Biden in a series of interviews since leaving the Oval Office.</p>
<p>The former president has also addressed concerns over his health, saying that the only thing keeping him from running would be a "bad call from a doctor or something."</p>
<p>"Things happen, through God, they happen. But I feel so good," Trump said in a September episode of The Water Cooler podcast.</p>

<p>A ban on instituting mask mandates in Arkansas has been declared unconstitutional.</p>

<a>state's proposed budget package</a>, while Tennessee's executive order was previously halted by a federal court due to an alleged violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, it was

<p>It is unclear whether or not authorities plan to challenge Fox's ruling on the mask mandate ban.</p>
<p>More than 100 public charter schools and school districts in Arkansas imposed mask mandates following Fox's ruling in August. Many have since eased or eased their requirements altogether.</p>
<p>Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson signed the ban into law in April, though he has since said he regretted that decision and has said he agreed with Fox's initial ruling against the ban.</p>
<p>Hutchinson faced heavy opposition from fellow <a>Republicans</a> in August when he proposed rolling back the ban.</p>
<p>Fox's ruling comes as COVID-19 cases are again on the upswing in Arkansas. On Tuesday, the state reported more than 2,400 new cases of the virus and an increase of 51 hospitalizations.</p>
