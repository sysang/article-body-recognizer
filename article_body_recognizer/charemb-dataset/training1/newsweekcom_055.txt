<p>President Joe Biden and Russian President <a>Vladimir Putin</a> are now scheduled to speak Thursday, following recent expansions to the demands Putin has made concerning the behavior of the U.S. and its <a>NATO</a> allies in Ukraine.</p>
<p>The National Security Council released a statement announcing the call, in which spokeswoman Emily Horne said Biden and Putin will discuss "a range of topics, including upcoming diplomatic engagements."</p>
<p>Biden is expected to emphasize America's commitment to its allies, but is willing to work toward "principled diplomacy" with Russia, an administration official told reporters, according to The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The official also said the Biden administration sees the call as another important step in finding a way past the "moment of crisis" the situation between Russia and Ukraine represents.</p>
<p>The U.S. and other allies have so far refused the demands, saying one of NATO's core principles is its ability to accept membership of any country that qualifies.</p>
<p>Last week, Putin <a>held a press conference</a> where he refused to rule out a potential invasion of Ukraine and demanded the U.S. and other NATO members listen to the nation's demands ahead of the <a>January negotiations</a> announced last week.</p>
<a>six U.S. Navy vessels</a>, including the USS Harry S. Truman, were ordered to remain in the Mediterranean Sea region rather than continuing their trip to the Middle East to address continuing concerns of potential conflict between Russia and Ukraine.
<p>The talks come as the U.S. and Western allies have watched the buildup of Russian troops near the border of Ukraine, growing to an estimated 100,000 and fueling fears that Moscow is preparing to invade Ukraine.</p>
<p>Secretary of State <a>Antony Blinken</a> spoke on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Ned Price said Blinken "reiterated the United States' unwavering support for Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity in the face of Russia's military buildup on Ukraine's borders."</p>
<p>Price said the two discussed efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine and upcoming diplomatic engagements with Russia.</p>
<p>Putin said earlier this week he would ponder a slew of options if the West fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding NATO's expansion to Ukraine.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Russia are to hold high-level talks on January 10. Moscow and NATO representatives are expected to meet that same week as well as Russia and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes the United States.</p>
<p>The official spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity. The two leaders held a video call earlier this month.</p>
<a>Barack Obama</a> on the international stage—looms large as Biden looks to contain the current smoldering crisis.
<p>The two leaders are also expected during Thursday's call to discuss efforts to persuade Iran to return to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was effectively scrapped by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Despite differences on Ukraine and other issues, White House officials have said the Iran nuclear issue is one where they believe the U.S. and Russia can work cooperatively.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Putin would speak with Biden on Thursday but provided no details.</p>

<p>A woman who survived the horrors of the Holocaust has celebrated her 98th birthday, as she declared "the Nazis did not win."</p>
<p>Lily Ebert BEM (British Empire Medal) marked the milestone on December 29 with cards from well-wishers around the world, as part of a campaign organized by her great-grandson, Dov Forman.</p>
<p>Forman put out a plea on social media for cards for Ebert, based in London, and on Wednesday shared a tweet showing his great-grandmother beaming, surrounded by letters.</p>
<p>Forman wrote: "Today my incredible great grandma Lily Ebert, a Holocaust survivor, turns 98!!</p>
<p>"To the thousands of people who sent birthday cards messages to Lily, THANK YOU."</p>
<p>Quoting Ebert, the tweet said: "I never expected to survive Auschwitz. Now, at 98, I celebrate surrounded by my family—the Nazis did not win!"</p>
<p>Chatting to Newsweek, Forman revealed they'd received more than 3,500 cards after his online appeal.</p>
<p>"So last year she had COVID, so I was thinking what could we do to make it extra special, to make up for last year," he said.</p>
<p>When asked if Ebert thought she'd reach this incredible birthday, Forman said "she definitely didn't."</p>
<p>"Let alone survive Auschwitz, and even if she did think she'd survive Auschwitz I don't think she ever thought she'd reach 98.</p>
<p>Ebert, who bears the Auschwitz camp tattoo of her number, has been hailed as an inspiration online, as happy birthday messages flooded in from celebrities, politicians and strangers alike.</p>
<p>Ebert was born in Bonyhád, Hungary, in 1923, before being transported to Auschwitz in July 1944, age 20, according to the Auschwitz Memorial <a>Twitter</a> page.</p>
<p>"She was then transferred to an ammunition factory near Leipzig where she was liberated," they wrote. Forman also claimed Ebert was forced to go on a "death march."</p>
<p>While Ebert, one of six children, survived, her younger brother and sister were <a>killed in Auschwitz</a>, while her mother also perished at the camp.</p>
<p>After being liberated Ebert rebuilt her life, and now has 10 grandchildren and 34 great-grandchildren, including Forman.</p>
<p>The account, featured as one of TikTok's creator spotlights earlier this month, captures Ebert discussing sleeping arrangements, jobs at the camp, and "selection," where the Nazis chose "people either to stay alive or to kill."</p>
<p>Forman told Newsweek: "She's dedicated her whole life to making sure something like the Holocaust can never happen again. She's incredibly positive, you can see that especially from the photo which we put on social media.</p>
<p>As well as setting up a TikTok account to bring Ebert's incredible story to a new generation, Forman co-authored a book, entitled Lily's Promise, which became a Sunday Times Best Seller, featuring a foreword by <a>Prince Charles</a>.</p>
<p>Auschwitz was the largest, and deadliest, of the <a>six extermination camps</a> set up during the Second World War, under Adolf Hitler's brutal regime.</p>
<p>Located in outskirts of Oswiecim, in German-controlled Poland, it opened in 1940. <a>The Holocaust Museum</a> estimates 1.1 million were murdered between 1940 and 1945, when was the camp was liberated on January 27.</p>
<p>The Auschwitz-Birkenau camp is now a memorial and museum dedicated to those who lost their lives.</p>
<p>The U.K.-based The Holocaust Educational Trust (HET) also shared birthday wishes for Ebert, <a>saying</a>: "The remarkable Lily Ebert BEM turns 98 today. Lily survived Auschwitz, before moving to the UK in 1967.</p>
<p>"Today, together with her great-grandson @DovForman, they have found new ways of reaching the next generation. Lily is an inspiration, Happy Birthday!"</p>
<div> News Australia <a>Tiktok</a> <a>Viral video</a></div>
<p>An Australian father is going viral for a video of him catching a massive huntsman spider with his bare hands.</p>
<p>Stephen Walker, who goes by @stephenwalker34 on TikTok, uploaded the video on December 23 and received more than 336,000 views and 860 comments.</p>
<p>"Straya baby spiders," the on-screen text read as Walker approached a spider that was crawling along a wall inside the house.</p>
<p>"Catch the little spider," Walker said casually as he cupped his hands and attempted to catch the spider.</p>
<p>The footage showed Walker attempting to grab the huntsman spider by cupping his bare hands, but the spider was able to quickly crawl away. With his quick instincts, Walker was able to successfully capture the spider.</p>
<p>As Walker attempted to show the spider to the camera, it hopped out of his grasp.</p>
<p>After jumping out of his hands and onto his bare arm, but Walker remained calm. While never losing his calm demeanor, Walker once again caught the spider.</p>
<p>"There it is," he said with his fist around the large huntsman.</p>
<p>In the comments, many users said they would have quickly run away if they witnessed a spider that big. Even users who said they were from Australia said they were shocked by the size.</p>
<p>'I'm in Australia and I still sh** my pants when I see a spider 5x smaller than that,' one user commented.</p>
<p>"LITTLE??! I'm Australian and I would move to France if I saw that in my house," another user wrote.</p>
<p>But other users were confused why people seemed so fazed by the spider.</p>
<p>"wait...this isn't normal? me and my mates would catch these types of spiders in primary school," one user admitted.</p>
<p>Some even mentioned that they thought spiders were "cute" and that while huntsman spiders are notoriously large, they are known for being less harmful than other large species.</p>
<p>While huntsman spiders are venomous, their bites do not kill humans. Unlike most spider species, huntsmans do not use webs to catch their food. Instead – as their name suggests – they hunt down their prey.</p>
<p>There are several subspecies of huntsmans, but the average species has a leg span of up to five inches while the giant huntsman can have a leg span up to 12 inches. This makes it the largest spider in diameter.</p>
<p>In other videos, Walker showed other huntsman spiders he had caught in the past.</p>
<p>"Because the last video was just a baby," the caption of the video read.</p>
<p>The video showed various photos of Walker next to some massive spiders. In some of the photos, the spiders looked larger than Walker's hand.</p>
<p>In another video, Walker's son filmed him joking around with a baby spider crawling around his head. Walker joked that he was trying to "catch a spider" as it crawled along his ears, head, and face.</p>
<p>Israeli archaeologists discovered two ancient shipwrecks off the Mediterranean coast containing coins and other artifacts from Roman and medieval periods, the Israel Antiquities Authority announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The two ships, both found near the ancient port city of Caesarea, sunk about 1,000 years apart. The first was from the Roman period, about 1,700 years ago, and the second was from the Mamluk period, about 600 years ago.</p>
<p>In addition to over 500 silver coins, there were figurines, ceramics and bells found among the wreckage. Also, some of the metal ship parts are considered artifacts now.</p>
<p>Jacob Sharvit, head of the IAA's Marine Archaeology Unit, said the unit made these discoveries in an underwater survey they have been conducting over a two-month period.</p>
<p>The artifacts were located on the seafloor, about 13 feet down, near the boats' remains. Sharvit told Haaretz, an Israeli newspaper, the two ships were most likely wrecked in storms while anchored offshore.</p>
<p>Notable discoveries include a bronze eagle figurine, bronze bells meant to deter evil spirits and pottery, Haaretz reported.</p>
<p>There was also a figurine of a pantomimus, or a nonverbal dancer in Roman theater that would act out scenes alone using only masks and movements, wearing a comic mask. The modern word "pantomime" was adopted from pantomimus.</p>
<p>From the ship, the archaeology unit also recovered nails, lead pipes and a large, shattered iron anchor.</p>
<p>According to Haaretz, IAA Director Eli Eskozido said in a press release that Israel's coasts are "rich" in these kinds of "sites and finds."</p>
<p>The IAA made its announcement just days ahead of Christmas and underscored the discovery of the Roman gold ring, its green gemstone carved with the figure of a shepherd carrying a sheep on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Robert Cole, head of the authority's coin department, called the item "exceptional."</p>
<p>"On the gemstone is engraved an image of the 'Good Shepherd,' which is really one of the earliest symbols of Christianity," he said.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
