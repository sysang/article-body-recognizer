<p>Now her perspective has shifted: “I can be grateful for my kids, and it can be hard,” she said. “I can treasure the children I have but wish Bella were here.”</p>
<p>“The gratitude can be there buried inside of you,” she added, “even when the most prominent feeling you have at this moment is sheer rage because your toddler is driving you insane.”</p>
<a>Instagram</a>. Many of her followers are dealing with infertility or child loss. She and her wife, Jess Camarillo, welcomed their son Bowie in March after enduring multiple rounds of in vitro fertilization and ultimately adopting three embryos.
<p>But Heather has never posted online about the postpartum depression she experienced after bringing Bowie home from the hospital.</p>
<p>“The only person I even told was my wife,” she said. “I just felt I should not be feeling this way. After everything we’ve been through, why should I have any kind of depression?”</p>
<p>Kristin Jones from Wayne, Pennsylvania, felt alone for a long time, too.</p>
<p>She miscarried another baby before delivering a daughter, who had significant digestive issues and was constantly crying.</p>
<p>An avid runner, Jones craved the release of exercise but felt too guilty to work out. “You can’t strap a screaming child into a jogger and go out without feeling like people are staring at you and judging,” she said.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when a fun excursion with her son isn’t going smoothly, she says she wonders: “Should I be doing something different so that I’m maximising my time with him? I’m so lucky to have him.”</p>
<p>She’s found relief in repeating an affirmation to herself: “Parenting is hard and not every moment of being a parent is going to be worth savouring.”</p>

<h1> What is cardiac angiosarcoma? The rare cancer that took Virgil Abloh's life </h1>
<div> <p>According to a statement released on his Instagram account, Abloh was diagnosed with the rare cancer in 2019 and underwent a number of treatments before he died. Here's what to know. </p> </div>
<p>On Nov 28, <a>Virgil Abloh</a>, a noted designer and artistic director of men’s fashion at Louis Vuitton, died at 41 in Chicago after a two-year battle with cardiac angiosarcoma.</p>
<p>WHAT IS CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMA?</p>
<p>These cancers are part of a larger family of cancers called sarcomas, which affect the connective tissues that support and surround other parts of the body, including muscle, fat and blood vessels.</p>
<p>Angiosarcomas are a kind of sarcoma that specifically afflict cells that line blood vessels, and cardiac angiosarcomas are angiosarcomas that occur within or around the heart.</p>
<p>Cardiac angiosarcomas that begin in the heart are known as primary cardiac angiosarcomas, whereas cancers that form elsewhere and then spread to the heart are secondary cardiac angiosarcomas.</p>
<p>It’s unclear which kind Abloh had, but it’s likely it was primary, said Dr Sumeet Mitter, a cardiologist at The Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, because if the tumor had originated elsewhere it would probably be described differently.</p>
<p>Angiosarcomas are aggressive and can also spread, or metastasise, to other parts of the body, including the lungs, liver and bone marrow, Dr Maki said.</p>
<p>HOW COMMON ARE CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMAS?</p>
<p>Angiosarcomas are <a>more common</a> in dogs, especially retrievers, Dr Maki added, where they often afflict the spleen.</p>
<p>These symptoms typically arise because the tumors make it harder for blood to flow through the chambers of the heart.</p>
<p>But while many people experience shortness of breath and fatigue, only a very small portion of people with these symptoms have cardiac angiosarcoma.</p>
<p>Typically, people have other heart problems instead – the heart muscle itself might be weak, or it may be too muscular and stiff, Dr. Maki said.</p>
<p>HOW ARE CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMAS DIAGNOSED?</p>
<p>HOW DO DOCTORS TREAT CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMA?</p>
<p>It depends on the patient, but treatment might include surgery to try to remove the heart tumor, or a heart transplant. But sometimes – even in transplant patients – the tumor can reappear.</p>

<p>This article originally appeared in <a>The New York Times</a>.</p>
<p>If the cancer has spread, though, a patient might undergo chemotherapy, radiation or treatment with other cancer-fighting drugs that can kill the spreading cancer.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Abloh’s cancer had spread, but if he had it for two years, that is certainly possible, Dr Maki said.</p>
<p>Because cardiac angiosarcomas can damage the heart, which is a vital organ, and because they are aggressive and often spread, these cancers are often fatal.</p>
<a>may live</a> for 12 to 30 months.
<p>WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIAC ANGIOSARCOMA?</p>
<p>Because so few people are diagnosed with this kind of cancer, we don’t know much about specific risk factors, Dr Maki said.</p>
<a>have been exposed</a> to high levels of vinyl chloride (a chemical used to make PVC.); arsenic; or
<a>thorium dioxide</a>, a chemical people can be exposed to in drinking water if they live near sites that mine for the radioactive metal thorium or use it in manufacturing.

<h1> Meet Arianna Majeed, the woman behind Singapore's modern halal bakery Spatula </h1>
<p>Spatula's not only the pioneer modern halal bakery in town known for their wedding cakes, it was also a popular hangout with live music gigs on the weekends. In this instalment of CNA Lifestyle’s Creative Capital series, we brains behind it.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Aun Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>Nonetheless, she seems happy and upbeat, enjoying both motherhood and a very manageable baking load. </p>
<p>HI ARIANNA, HOW DID YOU FIRST GET INTO BAKING AND COOKING?</p>
<p>WHAT GAVE YOU THE MOTIVATION TO START SPATULA?</p>
<p>HOW HAS THE BUSINESS EVOLVED AND CHANGED OVER THE LAST NINE AND A HALF YEARS?</p>
<p>WHAT DO YOU WISH YOU KNEW 10 YEARS AGO THAT YOU KNOW NOW, WHEN IT COMES TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP?</p>
<p>SPATULA TODAY SEEMS TO FOCUS ON HALAL BESPOKE CELEBRATION CAKES. IS THE MUSLIM MARKET, AND HAS IT TRADITIONALLY BEEN, UNDERSERVED WHEN IT COMES TO SERVICES LIKE THIS?</p>
<p>WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST PET PEEVE WHEN IT COMES TO MESSY HOMES?</p>
<p>For me, dirty dishes in the sink are a big no-no. Similarly, dirty clothes on the floor. Dishes should be washed after each meal, or at least before you go to bed for the night, and it's not that difficult to put dirty laundry in a hamper.</p>
<p>HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOUR TWO BUSINESSES?</p>
<p>DID YOU GET NON-MUSLIM CUSTOMERS PATRONISING THE BUSINESS SIMPLY BECAUSE YOUR CAKES ARE SO GOOD AND SO BEAUTIFUL?</p>
<p>WHAT ROLE DO YOU PLAY NOW WITH THE BAKERY?</p>
<p>OF ALL OF YOUR CAKES, WHICH IS THE HERO PRODUCT?</p>
<p>Today, I think this cake is no longer on trend, although we still do get the occasional order for it so it's still a staple in the eShop. Other than bespoke cakes, our fudgy brownies continue to be one of the best-selling items over the years.</p>
<p>AND WHICH IS YOUR OWN PERSONAL FAVOURITE?</p>
<p>Flavour-wise, my personal favourites are Cinnamon Apple Pie, and Boston Creme.</p>
<p>AND WHAT HAS BEEN THE BEST THING THAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU BECAUSE OF SPATULA?</p>
<p>TELL ME ABOUT SPRUCED? IS THIS A WHOLE OTHER BUSINESS?</p>
<p>Spruced is a small side-line that I unofficially launched in 2018. It grew from my incessant love and passion for organising and home decor. I provide assistance to those who need</p>
<p>help in tidying up their homes, advice on implementing organising systems, and sometimes home interior design and decor consultancy.</p>
<p>WHAT DO PEOPLE NEED MORE HELP IN ORGANISING — THEIR KITCHENS, CLOSETS OR HOME DECOR?</p>
<p>WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO DO THIS?</p>
<p>MARIE KONDO — YES OR NO?</p>
<p>THERE HAVE BEEN A NUMBER OF TV SHOWS FEATURING PROFESSIONAL HOME ORGANISERS? IS THIS PART OF THE PLAN? ARE YOU SHOPPING AROUND FOR A TV SERIES?</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Women </a> </p> <h5> She had two brain aneurysms and a stroke in a year: One woman's journey to recovery </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> She had two brain aneurysms and a stroke in a year: One woman's journey to recovery </h1>
<div> <p>Having to relearn simple things like walking, reading and making a cup of coffee showed entrepreneur and communications specialist Dominique Low that she is stronger than she had thought.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Vanessa Chia </a> </div> </div>
<p>Sitting across from Dominique Low, you would never suspect that little more than a year ago, she was fighting for her life in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Tan Tock Seng Hospital. </p>
<p>To this day, the founder of Wanderlust Brand Communications has little recollection of what happened that fateful day in August 2020. </p>
<p>Somehow, Low managed to open the bathroom door, where her partner saw that she had a huge bump on her head where she hit the floor.</p>
<p>“I managed to look in the mirror and realised that my arms kept shaking and I was still seeing stars, so he rushed me to the hospital, which turned to be an extremely good thing.”</p>
<p>Even Low’s partner, 47-year-old Greg Rawson, who co-owns the consultancy, had no idea how bad the situation was as she was still able to ask questions and give instructions during the car ride. </p>
<p>A RUPTURED BRAIN ANEURYSM</p>
<p>At the hospital, Low was sent for a CT scan and the doctors told Rawson that Low had a ruptured brain aneurysm – and that it would have to be treated immediately. </p>
<p>An aneurysm is a bulge in the blood vessel that can result from a weak blood vessel wall. This causes pressure to build up as blood passes through, causing the vessel to expand outwards like a balloon. </p>
<p>The heart and brain are the most common places for it to occur. In the brain, it can cause bleeding that can lead to haemorrhagic stroke, or worse, death.</p>
<p>Low was then whisked into surgery. Upon cutting into the area, the doctor found another aneurysm, just next to the one that had ruptured, which hadn’t come up in the scan. </p>
<p>The surgery took six hours, and for it, Low said that they had to shave her hair and cut through a muscle membrane to get to the aneurysm. </p>
<p>“The muscle membrane is elastic, so after they cut through it, it kind of collapsed,” Low explained as she showed me the slight depression near her temple. </p>
<p>Once out of the operating theatre and in the ICU, Low said she was doing fine at first, although she doesn’t remember much of her days there. </p>
<p>“I think I was only consciously present in the later part of my recovery, but in-between, I was definitely in and out,” she said.</p>
<p>A SUDDEN STROKE WHILE IN ICU</p>
<p>But one week after the surgery, Low found herself back in the operating theatre fighting for her life once more. </p>
<p>“One of the side effects of any brain surgery is that the patient could suffer from a haemorrhagic stroke (where blood from an artery begins to bleed into the brain after a blood vessel bursts).”</p>
<p>The result: The left side of Low’s face started to droop. Low said she was fortunate because the nurses checked on her hourly and caught the stroke in time, and were able to rush her back into the operating theatre.</p>
<p>“My doctor managed to pump some medication directly into my brain to stop the stroke.</p>
<p>But the downside was that things became challenging for Low again. “I had heard that patients who have had brain aneurysms but didn’t get haemorrhagic strokes would have a slightly better recovery process.”</p>
<p>THE REAL RECOVERY PROCESS</p>
<p>After a month in the hospital, Low was moved to Thye Hua Kwan Hospital in Ang Mo Kio for her rehabilitation and recovery. </p>
<p>And she had her work cut out for her. </p>
<p>The combination of two brain aneurysms and a stroke had left her unable to function as she had done before. </p>
<p>“Because of the stroke, my right leg couldn’t move properly so I couldn’t walk normally. And on my left side, I was unable to balance well. So I couldn’t even take a step. I always felt like I was going to fall,” she recalled. </p>
<p>“The one thing I remembered most clearly during my time was that I was very tired.” </p>
<p>Through it all, Low said that even though the nurses, doctors and even Rawson would tell her what she had gone through, she never fully understood it, until one day, when one of the doctors came in to check on her. </p>
<p>“She was telling me what had happened and then all of a sudden, I understood, and I went quiet. It’s funny because it was not like people were trying to hide the situation from me, but I guess I didn’t understand the significance till that day.”</p>
<p>“I STILL DON’T KNOW WHY IT HAPPENED”</p>
<p>Low said she hasn’t been able to figure out why the brain aneurysms happened, although her doctor told her that stress can play a big part, and that women tend to have a higher risk of getting it.</p>
<p>“I run my own company, and I remember I was juggling a few projects back then, and also taking care of some new businesses that were coming in. But I wouldn’t say I was overly stressed, so I’m not really sure how it all happened.”</p>
<p>She said the saddest part of the whole experience is that she’s now unable to do anymore expeditions. Her doctor has advised her against it as it’s unclear how her brain will be affected by high altitudes of 2,000m and above. </p>
<p>“My doctor said no high-elevation trekking for now,” she said, explaining that another brain aneurysm could happen. “Although, I can get on a plane and fly.”</p>
<p>SUPPORT FROM FRIENDS AROUND THE WORLD</p>
<p>Besides the doctors and therapists, Low also credits her support system of friends for helping her to pull through. </p>
<p>“I was really touched when I read their messages. I didn’t know so many people cared.” </p>
<p>Low also shared that she had friends visiting her from November 2020, when she felt ready to receive guests, and that “the visits really boosted my morale”.</p>
<p>Some friends also started fundraising campaigns to help with living expenses because Low and Rawson could not work as much. </p>
<p>WORKING HARD ON HER RECOVERY</p>
<p>Low’s true and steady champion throughout has been her partner of 10 years, Rawson.</p>
<p>“I keep forgetting that he was also stressed by what had happened. To be honest, I’m not sure if I could do as good a job as he did if the roles were reversed.”</p>
<p>Rawson played the role of caregiver, coach, teacher and parent during Low’s year of recovery. </p>
<p>“He would write out daily schedules and I would have to follow them. The doctors and therapists would set me assignments, and he made sure that I followed them.”</p>
<p>These included daily walks at the sky garden where they stay, reading and mental exercises. </p>
<p>Low said her short-term memory and vocabulary were affected after the incident, especially during the early months of her recovery, where she struggled even to remember how to construct a simple sentence. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> In the beginning, everything was difficult. I was really worried how I would recover and when I would recover because I didn’t know how long it would take. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>“For instance, if I wanted Greg to move a cushion on the sofa, I was unable to find the words to describe it or the action. I would go, ‘You see that thing, you need to push it’ instead.” </p>
<p>Even reading was difficult. “I could make out the words, like how to pronounce them, but I couldn’t make out what they meant, so I had to read them a few times to be able to understand what the sentence meant.”</p>
<p>It was these little things that Low said made her worry initially because she wondered when she would fully recover. </p>
<p>“In the beginning, everything was difficult. I was really worried how I would recover and when I would recover because I didn’t know how long it would take. </p>
<p>“Unlike a physical injury, like breaking an ankle (which coincidentally Low did in 2018 while she was climbing Mount Rinjani in Indonesia) where you can see how it is healing; when it is something like the brain, you have no clue how it’s doing.”</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> I could make out the words, like how to pronounce them, but I couldn’t make out what they meant </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>And you know what they say about things happening in threes? Low almost suffered yet another setback earlier in 2021, when her doctor found excess liquid building up inside her brain, which is another side effect of brain surgery. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> I hope with time, I’ll get back to the person I was. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Her efforts paid off because by the end of the month when she went back for her follow-up, the amount of liquid had reduced.</p>
<p>GETTING THE ALL-CLEAR ON HER HEALTH</p>
<p>To check that she had fully recovered, Low had to undergo a four-hour face-to-face test with a clinical psychologist to assess if her cognitive abilities had returned to her pre-aneurysm days. </p>
<p>“It’s a test that will be on your record because it is evidence that your brain is functioning normally, or as normally as it had. </p>
<p>“And here’s the scary part, you can only take this test one time.”</p>
<p>Low explained that it was mainly IQ-related, and included puzzles, drawings, arithmetic and even listening comprehension. </p>
<p>The good news: Low passed. </p>
<p>“Generally, the doctors say that I’m fully functional, about 98 per cent back to my pre-incident self. That missing 2 per cent, I can feel it. But I hope with time, I’ll get back to the person I was.</p>
<p>“This brain aneurysm, it’s a mystery. You don’t know when it’s coming. I’ve heard that some people try to prepare themselves for it by going for scans, so if there’s one coming up, they can get it treated. But how many of us would do that?” </p>
<p>Today, Low is back in the swing of things. For Christmas last year, she even cooked a dish and baked two cakes – although she said she had trouble following the recipe because she kept forgetting the steps.</p>
<p>“I would look at what needed to be done, then forget it the moment I stepped away. So I had to keep going back to check the recipes, but I did it. It took two days but I pushed through,” Low declared proudly. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> You push through and do your best, whatever the outcome might be. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Asked if there were moments during her recovery journey that she felt like giving up, Low said the thought never crossed her mind. </p>
<p>She credits her strong “can do” attitude for this. “I’ve always tried to be more of a ‘can do’ person. And sometimes, I do fail, but it’s okay because it’s still an experience. You push through and do you best, whatever the outcome might be.” </p>
<p>What is her biggest takeaway from all this? </p>
<p>“I felt really stupid in the beginning. I had to try to remember the simplest things, like how to make a cup of coffee. It was not difficult, but I realised that things that used to come so naturally, required more effort now. </p>
<p>“It also made me realise not to take things for granted, and to make more of an effort to keep in touch with my loved ones. And if there is an opportunity to care for someone, I should reach out more.”</p>

<h1> 'Everything changed': Wife separated from husband in KL when the borders closed shares her heartache </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Sharon Salim </a> <a> Serene Gan </a> </div> </div>
<p>Work and get married in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, live there and start a family. That was the plan my husband Seik Yeu and I had when we got engaged in May 2017.</p>
<p>But I didn’t foresee that I would leave my job and have to look for another one about a year before we got married. </p>
<p>I couldn't find anything in KL that was right for me but through a mutual friend, I found a job in Singapore as a tech consultant. </p>
<p>So I started working here in September 2017, and it turned out really well. Our clients really liked the work we were doing and I also liked my team.</p>
<p>That’s how I came to be living in Singapore for the past three years, and happily married but separated by distance from my husband, Seik Yeu.</p>
<p>The reason why we have a long-distance marriage is that my husband is running his family’s business in KL.</p>
<p>Although the long-term plan is for us to start a family in Singapore, it is more difficult for him to move here because his job requires him to be physically present at the factory. Seik Yeu and I agreed to take things one step at a time. </p>
<p>ADJUSTING TO A LONG-DISTANCE MARRIAGE </p>
<p>At the start of 2018, three months after I started my new job, I started planning our wedding from Singapore. We got married in KL in June 2018. </p>
<p>Back then, we didn’t think too far ahead because I wanted to try working in Singapore for one to two years to see how it went. It was meant to be a short-term arrangement. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Seik Yeu and I agreed to take things one step at a time. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>And thinking that our separation was going to be a short sprint made it easy for Seik Yeu and me to say: “Okay, we can do this.” </p></div> </div> </div>
<p>The plan was to meet every weekend: He would come here for three weekends, and I would fly back to KL on the last weekend of each month. </p>
<p>It was hard for me because I relied heavily on my husband to help in our partnership. Over the weekends we spent together, he would cook, do meal preps and help with the chores.</p>
<p>We had a running joke that we were not married yet.</p>
<p>Thankfully, very few people asked us when we were going to have kids. They knew about our situation, so we didn't get that pressure.</p>
<p>EVERYTHING CHANGED WHEN THE BORDERS CLOSED </p>
<p>We continued to meet every weekend from September 2017 to March 2020. Even when COVID-19 started in January last year, we were able to keep to our arrangement. </p>
<p>But it was only when the lockdown happened in both countries, which stopped visitors from crossing the borders, that we felt the effects of the pandemic. </p>
<p>When then Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced on Mar 16 that the Movement Control Order (MCO) was in place, my husband and I had just one day to decide whether one of us should go over. </p>
<p>It was an unprecedented time and there was very little information to help us make a decision.</p>
<p>I told Seik Yeu that he just needed to get to Singapore, although I didn’t know when he would be able to return to KL. During that time, flights had already stopped but the land border was still open. </p>
<p>We panicked so much that my husband drove into Singapore from KL, barely making it before the 12am cutoff on Mar 17 at the Causeway. </p>
<p>He stayed in Singapore for a month and a half, although he was very anxious throughout the trip because he had to leave his business unattended during this time. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> There was so much stress and I really felt for my husband, not knowing when he could head back to KL. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>His trip also coincided with the "circuit breaker" period in Singapore, which started on Apr 7.</p>
<p>“I WAS FORCED TO LET HIM GO”</p>
<p>My husband managed to leave Singapore in May 2020. Although the borders weren’t opened yet, Malaysia had allowed essential businesses to start operating – his factory provides services to electricity and utilities companies. </p>
<p>Once he received the approval, he needed to return to KL. He also had to serve a 14-day quarantine in Johor Bahru. </p>
<p>I felt like I was forced to let him go. As a Malaysian on a tourist pass, he would not be able to come back to Singapore for as long as the borders were shut. </p>
<p>There were so many uncertainties: No one knew how long the pandemic was going to last, whether there was going to be another lockdown, and we just couldn’t make any plans.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> For most of 2020, I was in major distress – it’s one of the hardest years of my life. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>All we knew was that he had to go back to KL and I couldn’t return with him because I had my job here. We just needed to take this step and hope that things would look better in the coming months. </p>
<p>All we could do was hope, all through 2020, that the borders would re-open.</p>
<p>We were disappointed three times. We thought it would open in August last year, but nothing happened. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> No one knew how long the pandemic was going to last, whether there was going to be another lockdown, and we just couldn’t make any plans. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Then, we tried to plan to meet in December, hoping that the two countries would allow families to meet over Christmas. But it didn’t happen.</p>
<p>This year, we also tried planning to meet during Chinese New Year, but that didn’t happen as well.</p>
<p>THE UPS AND DOWNS OF A LONG-DISTANCE MARRIAGE</p>
<p>During the months after Seik Yeu went back to KL, I went into a period of anxiety.</p>
<p>It was the worst time. I would cry for hours before falling asleep. Seeing couples holding hands was a bad trigger for me. There were many outbursts, but the worst was when it sent me crying on the floor for three hours.</p>
<p>It also wasn’t easy for my husband. He chose to put his emotions on hold and focus on his work, to cope with the loneliness and distract himself from it. </p>
<p>In a long-distance relationship, when you are sick and need someone to be around, you don’t get that. I also found it hard to deal with all the negative news happening around the world without Seik Yeu close to me. </p>
<p>But it was during this period that I grew as a person and relied more on my faith. </p>
<p>I realised that a lot of my identity and self-worth was tied to my husband, where I was dependent on him for so many things, such as cooking, cleaning the house and companionship. </p>
<p>I was thankful that I had a good team at work. The company gave us a mental health budget and unlimited days off, so I could take a mental health day when I needed it. </p>
<p>It was because my employers exposed us to the importance of mental health during the pandemic, that I became more open to seeking help. </p>
<p>I was at the peak of my anxiety in December last year and that was when I decided I just couldn’t cope anymore – and started seeing a counsellor. Journalling also helped me significantly. </p>
<p>It took me many months, almost a whole year, in fact, to accept the situation. It took a lot of self-reflection and inner work. </p>
<p>It was only this year that I stopped feeling affected about being in a long-distance marriage.</p>
<p>Now, in those moments where I feel that it’s hard, I don’t question why I’m feeling this way or why I’m so “weak”. I have come to accept that yes, it’s hard – and that’s fine.</p>
<p>It was more about me dealing with how I see things in my life, my values and my identity. </p>
<p>LEARNING TO MAKE THE MARRIAGE BETTER</p>
<p>We may not be able to watch TV together or have a coffee in person but because we had to get creative to find those moments together, we have grown so much in our marriage.</p>
<p>One of the upsides of this experience is that Seik Yeu and I are more in tune emotionally than we have ever been.</p>
<p>We’ve learned the art of speaking nicely to each other, and that has really helped our relationship.</p>
<p>We used to fight terribly, and in a long-distance relationship where you can’t see your partner face to face (and hug to reconcile after), the art of speaking kindly to each other really goes a long way.</p>
<p>Even if you are discussing something serious, your tone of voice can help to make it less stressful for both parties.</p>
<p>My husband is very patient, and he knows that he needs to give me space to “let it out”.</p>
<p>I was initially very hard on myself because I had certain expectations of what my marriage was supposed to look like. But once I let go of them, that was when I could start healing.</p>
<p>It took me a while to realise that that was the real problem. Having a fixed view of my life (and marriage) was hurting me more than the situation.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> We’ve learned the art of speaking nicely to each other, and that has really helped our relationship. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>I also came to realise that it also wasn’t easy for my husband to be apart from me. I want to focus on that and appreciate how supportive he’s been throughout the journey. </p>
<p>He’s a good man and a kind husband. I don’t think I could meet anyone who comes close to how kind he is to me and to the people around him. </p>
<p>I can also fully trust that he has my best interests at heart and that he is in my corner. He never gives me any reason to feel insecure in our long-distance marriage. </p>
<p>Even when our arguments get bad, we know at the back of our minds that we are just angry and we can get back to the issue later and figure it out. It’s that kind of security that makes being in a long-distance marriage bearable and fruitful.</p>
<p>LOOKING FORWARD TO THE VACCINATED TRAVEL LANE (VTL)</p>
<p>We applied to be Singapore Permanent Residents (PR) in April 2020, when Seik Yeu was in Singapore during the "circuit breaker" period.</p>
<p>We haven’t seen each other since that visit – seven whole months – so the recent announcement of VTL between Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport is really good news. </p>
<p>Seik Yeu recently booked his VTL flight to Singapore to spend Christmas and New Year’s Day here. We are looking forward to doing the normal things that couples do, such as cooking, talking and watching TV together.</p>
<div> <div><p>I am excited about planning a trip back to KL, too. The last time I was home was in February last year during Chinese New Year. I want to see my parents, catch up with friends, and look for new places to eat and visit. </p></div> </div>
<div> <section> <blockquote> We are looking forward to doing the normal things that couples do, such as cooking, talking and watching TV together. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>When Seik Yeu and I meet in December, we will finally be able to plan for 2022 in person.</p>
<p>This time, we are going to be smarter and not expect to see each other every weekend. We want to make each trip slightly longer, for example, travel on the VTL monthly, and stay for one and a half weeks each time. </p>
<p>The pandemic and our long-distance marriage has taught me to feel okay about being alone, which is also why it’s alright that we don’t meet every weekend, although we will spend more days together in a month. </p>
<p>TIPS FOR THOSE IN A LONG-DISTANCE MARRIAGE</p>
<p>If you are in a long-distance marriage, it’s usually not by choice, and there are certain circumstances and reasons that make for the set-up.</p>
<p>Every love story is unique and beautiful, so don’t think that your marriage is not “normal”. I changed my mindset from this to seeing that my marriage is unique, and it really helped me enjoy it more.</p>
<p>Creating psychological safety for each other is important, too. The moment you have that, it’s when your partner can tell you honestly what they think.</p>
<p>Because we are physically apart, we are doing this so that we can work on something tangible together. That has helped us feel connected and enjoy things together. </p>

<h1> Catching up with Kit Chan: New concert, Christmas rituals, pandemic obsessions and more </h1>
<div> <p>Ahead of her Reignite concerts at Marina Bay Sands from Dec 16 to 19, the 49-year-old Mandopop singer shares with CNA Women what she’s been up to – and lets us in on her Christmas favourites, too.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sharon Salim </a> </div> </div>
<p>Titled Reignite - Kit Chan “Live” in Concert,it will be held at the Sands Theatre at Marina Bay Sands, from Dec 16 to 19. The concert will also feature Chan’s first-ever Christmas segment. </p>
<p>The last time Chan performed in front of a live audience was in 2018, at her 25th anniversary concert Kit Chan 25 Years On: A Time For Everything. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Oh, I am so excited about this concert, you have no idea. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>It’s an exciting development for her and she has been looking forward to reconnecting with her fans and performing live with her band.</p>
<p>“I get lost in those moments, and all the stage fright and pain of wearing crazy high heels just melt away,” she told CNA Women in an email interview. </p>
<p>About two weeks ago, Chan gave her Instagram followers a sneak peek at what to expect, including dropping hints that there were “new songs to learn”. </p>
<p>Ahead of her concert in mid-December (as well as her performance in Mediacorp's Let's Celebrate 2022 countdown show), we caught up with Chan to find out what's new with her.</p>
<p>WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO LATELY? DID YOU DEVELOP A PANDEMIC OBSESSION? </p>
<p>Like a lot of people, I got into planting edibles such as herbs and even, eggplants and lady’s fingers. The thing that drew me to horticulture started with a concept, a philosophy, and not so much because I love green things.</p>
<p>I felt that I wanted a life that was more natural and rooted in nature. It seems so many of our problems stem from our disconnect and alienation from nature – and farming seems like the perfect thing.</p>
<p>Besides, I have always found peace and stability in manual work, even though I am, at the same time, a person who thrives on inspiration and creative impulses.</p>
<p>I also volunteer at a local farm when I find the time. It gives me so much joy and fulfillment.</p>
<p>HOW CAN WE TELL IF A RELATIONSHIP IS GETTING TOXIC? </p>
<p>THE PANDEMIC ALSO RAISED A LOT OF AWARENESS ABOUT MENTAL WELLNESS AND SELF-CARE. DID IT CREATE A SHIFT IN YOUR MINDSET ABOUT IT, TOO? </p>
<p>No, I was extremely aware of self-care and mental wellness years before the pandemic happened. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> We need to know if we are happy or not. It sounds simple, but a lot of people have stopped thinking about what happiness means to them. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>WHAT ARE YOUR TIPS FOR HOW WE CAN PRIORITISE OUR MENTAL HEALTH?</p>
<p>What I have learned over the years is that we really need to be self-aware, and to be honest with ourselves. Once we can do these two things, it is not difficult to be mentally healthy and well.</p>
<p>We need to know if we are happy or not. It sounds simple, but a lot of people have stopped thinking about what happiness means to them, and just sort of follow the path that society dictates as the path to happiness, success and more. </p>
<p>But there is no such path. We must chart our own journey, and we have to decide what makes us happy. </p>
<p>SPEAKING OF HAPPINESS, THERE’S CHRISTMAS TO LOOK FORWARD TO. WHAT DOES THE SEASON MEAN TO YOU?</p>
<p>The birth of Jesus Christ, a time of reflection and thanksgiving, a time to celebrate and to forgive, candles, cookies, Christmas carols, family, feasting. A time to be kind and generous to everyone. </p>
<p>I look forward to Christmas Eve dinner with the family, putting up the Christmas wreath and lights, lighting candles at night, and making tiramisu for my nephew. Also, playing Christmas music in the car.</p>
<p>YOU MUST BE EXCITED ABOUT YOUR UPCOMING CONCERT AS WELL. PLUS, YOU’RE ALSO HAVING A SPECIAL CHRISTMAS SEGMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME. </p>
<p>Oh, I am so excited about this concert, you have no idea. Reignite is not a Christmas concert, but a Kit Chan concert with a segment in it featuring some Christmas classics.</p>
<p>A SNEAK PEAK INTO WHAT YOU WILL BE SINGING, PLEASE?</p>
<p>There will be crowd favourites, of course, but even for some of those, we will treat it very differently to fit into the cosy and warm Christmas mood I was talking about. </p>
<p>And there will be a few surprises.</p>
<p>ARE YOU GOING TO SING HOME?</p>
<p>You will have to come and find out for yourself. </p>
<p>I READ ON YOUR INSTAGRAM THAT LEARNING A NEW SONG FOR THE CONCERT FEELS LIKE SETTLING IN A NEW PAIR OF SHOES. I LOVE THAT ANALOGY – WHERE ARE YOU IN THAT PROCESS?</p>
<p>I am still marvelling at how gorgeous those shoes are, and how shiny. But don’t worry, I will get there, and I will be strutting in those shoes.</p>
<p>STILL ON INSTAGRAM, YOU STARTED AN ACCOUNT FOUR MONTHS AGO AND IT NOW HAS MORE THAN 6,500 FOLLOWERS. HOW’S THAT GOING FOR YOU? </p>
<p>Honestly, I still can’t “do” IG in the way I see some others do it. I don’t think I spend more than 15 minutes on it each day, if at all.</p>
<p>What I appreciate about it is that I have made a couple of new friends or reconnected with old ones. It is also kind of nice to get news of what some of my overseas friends might be up to.</p>
<div><p>It is a great medium to share some news and perspectives with fans and whoever might be interested. However, I am never going to be a digital native, and I still prefer the old-school way of getting to know someone: Face to face.</p></div>
<p>YOU’VE BEEN IN THE INDUSTRY SINCE 1993. WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS ABOUT MUSIC IN SINGAPORE – AND WHO DO YOU ENJOY LISTENING TO? </p>
<p>I love Charlie Lim’s soulful vocals, Jasmine Sokko’s fancy futuristic noir outfits and Tanya Chua’s new songs.</p>
<p>JUST FOR CNA WOMEN READERS, WHAT DOES YOUR CHRISTMAS PLAYLIST LOOK LIKE?</p>
<p>Very traditional, though I do keep a classic and a modern playlist, just in case.</p>
<p>I must have Bing Crosby’s The Christmas Song and some retro Winter Wonderland. And I really have gotten to like Amy Winehouse’s I Saw Mummy Kissing Santa Claus.</p>

<h1> Positive About Breast Cancer, Even at Triple Negative </h1>
<div> <p>Still the leading cause of cancer deaths among women in Singapore, doctors are helping victims overcome odds even in the face of aggressive triple negative breast cancer.</p> </div>
<p>Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among Singaporean women, accounting for roughly 30 per cent of all cancers diagnosed in women.</p>
<p>The occurrence of breast cancer is linked to hormone receptors and a protein known as Her2 – the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2.</p>
<p>About 70 to 80 per cent of breast cancer cells express hormone receptors, commonly known as estrogen and progesterone receptors. As for Her2 receptors, only about 20-25 per cent of breast cancer cells express them.</p>
<p>“Her2 receptors are proteins that promote cancer cell growth”, explains Dr Wong Chiung Ing, a Medical Oncologist at Parkway Cancer Centre.</p>
<p>While conventional treatments such as chemotherapy are still sought to combat breast cancer, it is now also possible to destroy the cells with greater precision.</p>
<p>“We now have targeted therapy that targets this protein (Her2), interferes with the pathway, stops the tumour progression and therefore promotes cancer cell death” says Dr Wong.</p>
<p>She goes on to add that “targeted therapy can be combined with chemotherapy to have even more effective control on cancer cell growth.”</p>
<p>Signs of Breast Cancer, Apparent and Hidden</p>
<p>The most common tell-tale sign of breast cancer is a breast lump that is painful, hard and will not go away. The breast may be swollen as well because of this.</p>
<p>Other symptoms may include nipple inversion or nipple discharge which could be bloody or coloured. Breast cancer can also cause skin changes, including dimpling or puckering of the skin.</p>
<p>However, the bigger problem for doctors and patients alike lies beneath the skin, in the 15 per cent of breast cancer cells that do not exhibit either hormone or Her2 receptors. This is known as a triple negative breast cancer.</p>
