<p>The scope of cognitive neuroscience includes how thought processes unfold at the cellular level—in specific neurons and the connections between them—as well as in the links between mental processes and larger brain regions and systems.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>How Brain Cells Work</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>When a person thinks, speaks, eats, walks, or just sits comfortably with all bodily systems functioning normally, the billions of cells that make up the brain and the rest of the nervous system are hard at work. </p>
<div> <h4>On This Page</h4> <ul> <li> Neuron Basics </li> <li> How Neurons Connect </li> <li> Neurotransmitters </li> <li> Other Brain Cells (Glia) </li> </ul> </div>
<p>Between the axon of a transmitting neuron and the dendrite of a receiving neuron is a gap called the synapse—the site at which signals are passed between the brain cells.</p>
<p>The nervous system contains hundreds of different types of neurons that have physical forms specialized for their functions. </p>
<li>Sensory neurons transmit signals from the sense organs about touch, sights, sounds, tastes, and smells.</li>
<li>Motor neurons carry signals from the brain to the body’s muscles in order to control movements.</li>
<li>Interneurons convey signals between sensory and motor neurons and among themselves.</li>
<p>Key neurotransmitters include the following:</p>
<li>Acetylcholine is important for the control of muscles and the secretion of hormones, as well as for cognitive function.</li>
<li>Norepinephrine (noradrenaline) is key to the function of the sympathetic nervous system and to the “fight-or-flight” response.</li>
<li>Dopamine helps to regulate reward behavior and mood, as well as in the control of body movements.</li>
<li>Serotonin plays a role in the initiation of sleep and in appetite, mood, temperature control, and other functions.</li>
<li>Glutamate is the most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system; it is involved in a wide variety of functions.</li>
<li>GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is the most widespread inhibitory neurotransmitter; it is also involved in a vast array of functions.</li>
<h2> Other Brain Cells (Glia) </h2>
<p>There are multiple types of glial cells with distinct purposes. Major kinds of glia include:</p>
<li>Microglia: provide the central nervous system’s immune defense against potential disease threats. They also dispose of leftovers from cell injury and death. </li>

<p>The human brain, as the seat of mental life—from the most complicated intellectual processes down to routine and unconscious bodily control—is necessarily enormously complex. </p>
<p>The brain and spinal cord together form the body’s command structure: the central nervous system. The peripheral nervous system extends body-wide, encompassing nerves that branch out from the spinal cord and the brain.</p>
<div> <h4>On This Page</h4> <ul> <li> Hemispheres of the Brain </li> <li> Lobes of the Brain </li> <li> The Cortex </li> <li> Beneath the Cortex </li> <li> Cerebellum </li> <li> Brain Stem </li> </ul> </div>
<h2> Hemispheres of the Brain </h2>
<a>Both hemispheres work closely together</a>, communicating via a bundle of nerve fibers, the corpus callosum, that forms a bridge between them.
<p>While each hemisphere has certain tasks to which it is especially tailored, broad mental activities and qualities such as perception, creativity, and reasoning are handled by both hemispheres together. (For more, see Left Brain - Right Brain.)</p>
<p>The cerebral hemispheres are commonly mapped out based on four large regions—the frontal lobe, the temporal lobe, the parietal lobe, and the occipital lobe—with one of each on either half of the brain.</p>
<li>The occipital lobes form the back section of the cerebrum. They contain the primary visual cortices and are crucial for vision.</li>
<p>Buried in the core of the brain are a collection of structures that serve a variety of important functions. Some of these essential components are:</p>
<li>The clusters of neurons called the basal ganglia are important for coordinating physical movements, including habitual behaviors.</li>
<p>The cerebellum plays a central role in the control of the body’s movements and in the learning of physical tasks. Based on signals from the inner ears and the muscles, the cerebellum enables the body to maintain balance and posture.</p>
<p>The brain stem, situated at the bottom of the brain, is made up of three main parts: the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata.</p>
<li>The midbrain is the highest part of the brain stem. Among other functions, it is responsible for certain reflexes, helps to process visual and auditory information, and contributes to the control of eye movement as well as other body movements. </li>

<h1> When "Parental Alienation" Is Not Quite What It Seems </h1>
<h2> The dynamics may be more complex than what first meets the eye. </h2>
<li>Parental alienation results from one parent maliciously turning a child against the other so that a relationship is lost.</li>
<li>A child may become "alienated" from one parent because of the behavior of both parents.</li>
<li>It is essential to evaluate the personalities of both parents in depth before assuming that "parental alienation" is why a relationship is lost. </li>
<h3>Negative attitudes of the children</h3>
<p>The following is indicative of Lois’s deteriorating attitude from tolerating her father to wanting him removed entirely from her life.</p>
<li>Lois said without enthusiasm, “I like going, but there’s not enough fun.” Asked what she would like to do with her father, she replied, “I don’t know.”</li>
<li>One month later, Lois said tersely, “I don’t like seeing him in general. I don’t like being around him. He’s annoying.”</li>
<li>Several months into her new life, Lois exclaimed, “When it’s just me and my dad, I walk away.”</li>
<li>Lois denounced her former school as “really <a>boring</a>” and spoke of how “really cool” her new school was. She said, “I don’t want my dad at any of my sports.”</li>
<li>Lois’s negativity increased to a point that she asserted that her father was harmful, that he made her “nervous” and “upsets me so I don’t work well when he is around.”</li>
<li>When Mr. Trumball called on the phone, Lois would not answer or call him back. </li>
<li>Lois refused to let Mr. Trumball escort her to a father-daughter dance. She commented, “I wanted to go, but not with my dad.” She declared that she could not “think of anything” that she enjoyed doing with him.</li>
<p>When Michael drew a picture of his family, he omitted his father. When I inquired about this, he explained, “I was drawing everyone in the family here.” Michael added. “I don’t like him being around me.” </p>
<p>Michael had adjusted quickly to his new surroundings. He said about his school, “I love it. It has really good kids and great teachers. The principal is really nice.”</p>

<p>Ken suspected that his wife might want to move after they separated. He made financial offers so that she and the children could remain in the same area even if they had to move to a smaller house.</p>
<p>If one considers the children’s perspective, the following was true:</p>
<li>They were living among relatives whom they loved and who adored them;</li>
<li>They had become enthusiastic about their new school;</li>
<li>They had immersed themselves in the community including extracurricular activities;</li>
<li>They saw that their mother was more relaxed;</li>
<li>Traveling 150 miles each way to Virginia constituted a major intrusion into their lives. They would miss practices and games while wasting hours in the car traveling to and from Virginia. Their new social activities would be interrupted;</li>
<li>When Mr. Trumball visited, he’d stay in a hotel, and the children would have to spend part of the time there.</li>
