<h1> What Is the Right Amount of Noise for Your Work Team? </h1>
<h2> How you can conduct a noise audit. </h2>
<li>Noise is not bias but variability in judgment on any specific matter.</li>
<li>Too much or too little noise in a work group can be harmful.</li>
<li>A noise audit using a Board of Directors provides a good example.</li>
<li>A noise audit can be adapted to other corporate work groups.</li>
<a>decision-making</a> bodies such as work teams.
<p>Optimal Noise in Work Groups.</p>
<p>Too much noise can be a problem. On the other hand too little noise can also have negative consequences: </p>

<a>confidence</a> of the Board as a collective. It is not presented with the idea of showing how any individual Board member thinks relative to the group as a whole.
<p>Please read the cases below. At the conclusion of each case, write down your responses to these two questions:</p>
<p>1. If I was on this Board, I would respond in the following manner:</p>
<p>2. My level of confidence in my decision is:</p>
<p>0=Totally unsure about my decision</p>
<p>5=Ambivalent about my decision.</p>
<p>10=Totally confident about my decision</p>
<p>Sample Cases for a Board of Directors Noise Audit.</p>
<p>Case 1: The 81-year-old founder of a successful family business is making some “strange” decisions. The daughter approaches you and expresses concern. You are an independent non-family member of this Board:</p>
<p>Case 2: Cybersecurity risk is on everybody’s mind. The Chair approaches you and asks which Committee should deal with it at the Board level:</p>
<p>Case 3: You are on the Board of a public company. The CEO has complained to you that Board members are too involved in the life of the company. What is your response?</p>
<p>Case 4: The CFO and the Chair of the Audit Committee Disagree. How do you respond?</p>
<p>Case 5: You are on the Board of a private equity portfolio company. The Founder-CEO threatens to quit the company unless the Board agrees to the CEO's compensation demands. How do you respond? </p>
<p>Summary and Conclusions.</p>
<p>Noise and bias are both involved with individual and collective decision-making. Our focus has been on noise.</p>

<h1> Rewiring—Not Retiring </h1>
<h2> Figuring out the next phase of your life. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: patpitchaya/shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Retirement is changing, partly because people are living longer. So many people are living well into their 90s that planning for 30 years of retirement has become conventional financial advice.</p>
<p>Moreover, a lot of people still feel pretty vigorous at 65—or 75—and would like to remain engaged with the world. They want to use their experience to make a productive contribution. They don’t want to be <a>bored</a>.</p>
<a>the percentage of 65- to 74-year-olds still participating in the labor force</a> was 26.8 percent in 2016, and projected to reach 30.2 percent by 2026.
<a>73 percent of the 60-to-74-year-olds cited job enjoyment</a> as one of the most important reasons they still work.
<a>career</a> couples naturally tend to have a strong commitment to their work, this approach may appeal to many of them.
<p>Bram, for instance, is now entering his third phase of rewiring. In his first phase, which lasted five years, he went to work for a small private equity firm, putting in a 40-hour workweek—a big step down from his previous 80-hour weeks.</p>
<p>In his second phase, Bram partnered with both our children to help with their respective businesses—a venture capital firm and a real estate/property <a>management</a> firm.</p>
<p>And now in phase three, after being rewired for 10 years, Bram is trying to manage down his commitments to the business world and play a little more golf.</p>
<a>wise</a> to take some time before rewiring to plan in more detail how you want to spend your time. We both feel that a year or so for planning is about right. For one thing, it can take some time to put the elements of rewiring in place.
<p>But bear in mind, if you’re rewiring, you’re committing to more of a working lifestyle than a retirement lifestyle, especially in phase one. You won’t be playing golf three times a week.</p>
<p>And you should be clear on the persona you’re developing. For Bram, this meant developing a career as a private equity and venture capital investor. For Ilene, it was serving on corporate boards.</p>

<p>The apprehension that occurs when we are evaluated by others is, in fact, perfectly normal (see Thomas et al., 1979). This said, the interview process amplifies such apprehension quite a bit. But that need not be the case. </p>
<p>Below are six empirically supported tips for nailing that interview, along with some guidance for dealing with rejection which, at some point or another, rears its head in all our lives.</p>
<a>unconscious</a> level). Sure, some people may naturally be warmer than others and you certainly don’t want to fake anything. But if you’ve got a splash of warmth in your character, I’d say to amplify it during the interview.
<a>leadership</a>/personnel. Find out about how the department fits in with the broader
<a>goals</a> of the institution. Become an expert in all of these things and bring your printed materials in an organized and well-presented manner so that they know you mean business.
<p>4. Be Ready to Describe Your Faults. Here are some common questions in an interview:</p>
<li>Describe your biggest failure.</li>
<li>What would your current co-workers describe as your worst work-related attribute?</li>
<li>Describe an area in which you need work.</li>
<li>Have you ever been fired? If so, explain the circumstances.</li>
<p>And so on. Often, a set of interview questions will have a zinger along these lines. And it often catches folks off guard. </p>
<p>For instance, suppose that you are interviewing to teach in a special science program and you are asked about your teaching <a>philosophy</a>.</p>
<p>Whatever the details, I’d say to bring them to the table. When it comes to telling the story of your work, the more specific you can be, the more it seems that you actually got this.</p>
<li>Get to each and every meeting early. Not on time; early.</li>
<p>What If You Get Rejected?</p>
<p>Here are some reasons that you might not get the job:</p>
<li>There were a ton of applicants and interviewees</li>
<li>There was an inside candidate who was going to get the job no matter what</li>
<li>One member of the committee didn’t like a word you’d used, or your hairstyle, or your pants, or something...</li>
<a>Failure as the Single Best Marker of Human Success</a> from a few years back.
<p>Bottom Line: If you got an interview, you must have done something right. Always remember that you’re not guaranteed a job offer. And there are always extenuating circumstances lingering behind the scenes. </p>
<a>mindful</a> of others’ schedules, and you are a hard-working, caring person who is good at his or her craft, you should have a good fighting chance at this one.
<p>And if you don’t get the job, don’t worry too much about the why of it. As I always suggest in the light of failure: Smile at the rain, learn something from the experience, and move forward.</p>
<p>This post is dedicated to all those among us who are willing to take chances in an effort to aspire to do something great and to make the world a better place. Thanks for your service. And stay the course. The world needs people like you.</p>

<h1> 6 Ways to Discover and Choose Your Core Values </h1>
<h2> Knowing your values can guide your actions and give you inner peace. </h2>
<p>“What Should I Do?” Everyday Values Dilemmas</p>
<p>You’ve planned to have dinner with your friend on Friday night. On Friday morning, the guy you’ve been crushing on asks you out for the evening. Do you say yes and break the date with your friend?</p>
<p>You just got a raise. Should you bank it for retirement or make your life more comfortable now? </p>
<p>You wanted to get a head start on an important report for work later this evening. But your child has had a tough day and could benefit from your <a>attention</a>. Should you prioritize work or family?</p>
<p>But how do you know what your core values are? This blog post will reveal six ways to discover and choose your core values.</p>
<p>First, what is a “value” anyway?</p>
<a>Self-Confidence</a> Workbook. I love both parts of this definition—that values stand for our most meaningful ideals and also that they inspire us to keep going when the going gets tough.
<p>If you are not sure about your own core values, or if you would like to clarify which of your values are top priority now, here are six options.</p>
<p>1. Choose your top six to eight values from a wide-ranging list of values.</p>
<p>To do this, you need a good list.</p>
<a>Creativity</a>; Dependability; Loyalty; Beauty; Bravery;
<a>Gratitude</a>; Love; Connection/Relationships; Learning;
<a>Leadership</a>; Survival; Self-Preservation; Security; Adventure; Family; Work; Success; Calm; Freedom; Other___; Other ___.
<p>Note that sometimes your choice is not between right and wrong but between two cherished values, as in my situation above.</p>
<p>2. Think of three to six people you most admire or love. Consider why they are so important to you. </p>
<p>Values can be personified in people that you love and admire. You can use this simple two-step process to uncover the values that you associate with your significant others and role models: </p>
<p>3. See a <a>career</a> counselor.</p>
<p>4. Use an online values inventory.</p>
<p>5. Observe yourself and learn.</p>
<p>6. Focus on the bitter and the sweet in your life.</p>
<p>Difficult Choices and Difficult People</p>
<a>goals</a>—for example, once you achieve a comfortable degree of "financial security," that value may recede into the background and other values may take its place.
<p>Know Your Values, Know Yourself</p>
<a>this blog</a>. The others are interests, temperament,
<p>A Preview of Coming Attractions</p>
<a>stress</a>, communicate with more compassion, increase your self-confidence, and power up your
<a>willpower</a>. The next blog will reveal the research behind those benefits and how you can utilize it for yourself.
<p>Meanwhile, experiment with living the "values-driven life." Does living by your values increase your sense of satisfaction with yourself and your life? </p>
