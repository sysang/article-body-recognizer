<p>Turmoil in China’s junk bond market has been testing investors’ nerves - and that’s just concerning the debt they knew about.</p>
<h2>1. How do developers obscure debt?</h2>
<p>There are several ways, including:</p>
<p>Evergrande’s late payments on its wealth products sparked protests in September, prompting worries of social unrest. Kaisa’s bonds and shares plunged in November after the company missed payments on its wealth products.</p>
<p>Joint ventures. These allow property companies to invest in projects without consolidating them onto their own balance sheet, creating potential for hidden liabilities, according to Moody’s Investors Service.</p>
<p>Fantasia disclosed it had US$150 million of private bonds only after it ran into repayment trouble, according to Fitch Ratings. Evergrande, Kaisa, Fantasia and Agile didn’t respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>Developers have always relied heavily on borrowing to fund growth, but in recent years they’ve come under pressure from regulators worried about the risk of financial meltdown.</p>
<h2>4. What’s the private bond market and who are the issuers?</h2>
<h2>5. What’s the reaction been?</h2>
<p>Bondholders have also become savvier about identifying red flags at developers, including large exposure to joint ventures. Agile told investors in October it plans to refrain from issuing private placement bonds going forward.</p>
<h2>6. Why does this matter now?</h2>

<h1> Commentary: India’s COVID-19 crisis could cause long-lasting economic scars </h1>
<div> <p>Even though India’s lockdowns are more targeted this year, significant economic losses remain likely, especially if subsequent waves of the infection continue to burden healthcare infrastructure, says economist Charu Chanana.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Charu Chanana </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: India’s devastating rise in COVID-19 case numbers and fatalities is proving to be a full-blown tragedy.</p>
<p>Apart from the disastrous impact on lives and livelihoods, the restrictions imposed across the country will greatly impact the economy, with long-lasting scars on the labour market.</p>
<p>An increasing number of states have announced lockdowns in one form or another. Uttar Pradesh has imposed a statewide curfew. West Bengal has introduced a night curfew to go along with the lockdown.</p>
<p>Others like Delhi, have ceased metro transportation services but have allowed some essential services to carry on. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Some pain even as Singapore rises to the challenge of tighter COVID-19 measures</a></h3>
<p>More states could see tighter restrictions as the outbreak spreads. While cities like Mumbai and Delhi show signs of peaking, the southern states and rural areas are seeing new surges.</p>
<p>Mobility indicators from Google and Apple show the second wave is starting to bite into economic recovery.</p>
<p>The Indian economy was estimated to have shrunk by 8 per cent last year - its worst performance since independence. Last year’s national lockdown also took a heavy toll on the informal sector.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Is Modi already being made to pay for India’s COVID-19 crisis?</a></h3>
<p>While the economic losses this year are not expected to be as steep as last year, the drag is likely to be significant, with further downside risks if subsequent waves of the infection continue to burden healthcare infrastructure.</p>
<p>So far, data collected reflects a mixed trend, with the Goods and Services Tax (GST) collections touching a record high in April but likely to soften in May.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the unemployment rate has ticked up to 8 per cent in April from 6.5 per cent in March, while the labour participation rate has declined further month-on-month, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.</p>
<p>The declines in power demand and railway freight have, however, been less severe than last year.</p>
<p>DISMAL VACCINATION STRATEGY</p>
<p>India cannot let its guard down, especially because the pace of vaccinations has been so sluggish.</p>
<p>Initial vaccine rollout has been slow and marked by public scepticism over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and lack of disclosure about an Indian-developed dose.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: India’s second COVID-19 wave threatens global supplies of vaccines</a></h3>
<p>The vaccination programme has lagged targets, with supply compounding problems. Daily vaccination rates have been stuck at between 2 million to 2.5 million.</p>
<p>Even if that can be increased to 4 million to 6 million if supplies are ramped up, India can only fully inoculate only 25 per cent to 40 per cent of the population by year-end.</p>
<p>Worse, India has relied mostly on domestic production of the vaccine compared to the other big economies.</p>
<p>But closures owing to lockdowns have led to a shortfall in vaccine doses. Many states have had to close vaccinations for the 18 to 45 age group recently after inoculations for this bracket started on May 1.</p>
<p>The possibility of a worse third wave and the need for annual booster doses against a mutating virus means that demand could continue to outpace supply of vaccines.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Indonesia’s vaccine campaign needs serious help to accelerate</a></h3>
<p>The high infection rate as recovering patients gain antibodies could suggest some form of herd immunity, but there is little substitute for vigilance. Global examples too show re-infection is a possibility.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, vaccine pricing has shot up in an attempt to liberalise procurement. Manufacturers have been allowed to sell 50 per cent of the produce directly to states, corporates and private hospitals.</p>
<p>At private hospitals, a single dose can now cost up to 1,500 rupees (US$20), almost six times the original price, which will impose hurdles for vaccinating rural India, where disposable incomes are significantly lower.</p>
<p>ECONOMIC CHAOS TO LEAVE SOME SCARS</p>
<p>India’s consumption saw a quick return to normalcy after the first wave, owing to pent-up demand and festive shopping.</p>
<p>Yet hesitancy over spending may last longer this time around, given the severe impact on lives and livelihoods.</p>
<p>Growth in the second half is likely if the virus peaks by May. The economy can reopen sometime over July to August if cases begin to taper.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: My harrowing brush with COVID-19 in New Delhi as India is ravaged</a></h3>
<p>But if this virus resurgence remains out of control, we will see longer-lasting scars in the labour market and a drag on India’s potential output.</p>
<p>The post-pandemic era will also amplify pre-COVID structural headwinds leaving stressed corporate balance sheets and banks with more non-performing assets.</p>
<p>Hence, an investment-led recovery may remain elusive as well, unless structural reforms are prioritised.</p>
<p>GLOBAL REPERCUSSIONS WILL BE MATERIAL</p>
<p>India’s COVID-19 crisis is not only proving to be tough for the domestic economy, it is also likely to create multi-dimensional drags for parts of the global economy and foreign relations.</p>
<p>Variants first detected in India have spread to the global economy.</p>
<p>Even as trade continues, many countries are likely to keep their borders shut to passenger commute, particularly to India, for a prolonged period unless it can get its act together.</p>
<p>The greatest impact will come as India’s migrant labour, key to construction and services industries in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia, have been repatriated.</p>
<p>With borders now closed and limited visibility on when these might open again, labour flows are likely to remain closed or minimal, sparking labour supply shortages in many countries.</p>
<p>India has also stopped exports of vaccines and life-saving drugs, leading to delays in reaching herd immunity, especially for low-income countries.</p>
<p>POLICY MISSTEPS MUST BE AVOIDED</p>
<p>Healthcare investments and support to contact-intensive sectors remain the priority for the next few years, while advancements in digital and e-commerce are also needed.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Deep-rooted issues at heart of India's COVID-19 crisis</a></h3>
<p>For now, rating agencies remain optimistic about India’s post-COVID rebound. They see it as being delayed, not denied.</p>
<p>But there is a need to remain watchful as two of the three major agencies - Fitch and Moody’s - have issued a negative outlook on India, and India’s credit rating stands just above investment grade.</p>

<h1> Commentary: India has a hidden COVID-19 crisis of food </h1>
<div> <p>With the pandemic inducing lockdowns and affecting migration patterns, food security is the unexpected collateral damage, says NUS’ Vani Swarupa Murali.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Vani Swarupa Murali </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: India’s second wave of COVID-19 has been brutal on its people.</p>
<p>During the first wave, images emerged of a mass exodus from the major cities with countless people walking – sometimes more than 700 kilometres – back to their villages, many not surviving the journey.</p>
<p>Now it is happening again. The pandemic has also seen increased mortality rates, loss of livelihoods and growing malnutrition.</p>
<p>While some studies have shown the effect of the pandemic on food security in terms of food shortages, rations and government public distribution schemes, not many have looked at the effect it has had on the producers and production of food.</p>
<p>The many quarantine regulations, social distancing rules, lockdowns and border controls have disrupted the supply chain of food and made food security a question mark for many, especially the poor.</p>
<p>Despite the Indian government’s promise to double farmers’ income by 2022, producers have faced one difficulty after another in the last few years.</p>
<p>In late 2018, amid a spike in farmer suicides, growers took to the streets to demand loan waivers and higher prices for their produce in an effort to tackle mounting debt.</p>
<p>In 2020, with scope for record harvests in rice and wheat, farmers appeared optimistic about their year.</p>
<p>This optimism was quickly dampened when the Modi government introduced three new farm acts, which led to protests that continued into 2021.</p>
<p>Farmers congregated in Delhi, the national capital, to object to the takeover of the agricultural sector by big corporates – yet have little to show for their demonstrations.</p>
<p>Ever since the first lockdown in India, producers have faced serious difficulties in maintaining their livelihoods.</p>
<p>A study conducted in May 2020 among almost 1500 farmers revealed that of the 11 per cent who did not harvest their crop, 24 per cent cited lockdown-related reasons.</p>
<p>Of the 63 per cent of farmers who were able to harvest in the month prior to the survey, 39 per cent had stored their crop, with half citing lockdown issues as the reason.</p>
<p>Another survey reported that 15 per cent of farmers were unable to sell their harvest due to lockdowns.</p>
<p>These issues are, in part, the result of one of the first consequences of the pandemic: The change in migration patterns.</p>
<p>As migrant workers lost their jobs in the cities and returned to their villages, families faced the added pressure of having more mouths to feed.</p>
<p>Most migrants were quick to enter the local labour force as a way to contribute to their family’s income.</p>
<p>The increased demand for jobs and the willingness to work for lower pay depressed overall wage rates and may ultimately affect the viability and productivity of agriculture as a profession in India.</p>

<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Grassroots health surveillance can help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 and other illnesses</a></h3>
<p>The availability of more able-bodied men may also sideline women who are working in agriculture, rejigging gender dynamics.</p>
<p>Some migrants are also seasonal and are expected to return to their villages for rice-sowing season.</p>
<p>However, many of them were stranded in cities during the lockdown. This limited their movement and led to labour shortages in their home villages.</p>
<p>THE IMPACT ON FOOD SECURITY</p>
<p>Given that these areas are considered “breadbasket states” due to the crops they produce, their underproductivity has serious implications for food security around the country.</p>
<p>If they managed to yield a good harvest, taking their produce to the market was nearly impossible with limited transport options available.</p>
<p>The road closures and restrictions on interstate travel impeded the movement of produce across the country and limited the number of sale points.</p>
<p>As a result, there was extreme wastage of perishable commodities such as milk, fruit and vegetables, and a significant number of distress sales.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: India’s COVID-19 crisis could cause long-lasting economic scars</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: India’s second COVID-19 wave threatens global supplies of vaccines</a></h3>
<p>Those farmers who spent on transportation were left with reduced income to purchase seeds and fertilisers for the next sowing season.</p>
<p>Many of these issues were listed in the May 2020 survey as reasons why 55 per cent of farmers said that the lockdown affected their preparations for the sowing season.</p>
<p>However, rather than focusing on cyclical problems or downward spirals, recent reports suggest that things might be looking up.</p>
<p>With many migrant workers returning to their villages and spending time on farming, the farming sector is seeing “good progress and with good monsoon … a bumper crop and good income”.</p>
<p>Some are even reporting a better quality of life: “City life takes away a lot – health, happiness and community sentiment, though I returned under compulsion, at the moment I am not regretting”.</p>
<p>Perhaps increased help on the farm and a projected good monsoon might be a “silver lining for those who returned home”.</p>

<h1> Commentary: India cosying up to Pakistan is latest move in a regional chess game with China </h1>
<div> <p>With pressures mounting on the northern frontier, India knows it cannot afford escalating tensions to its west, says Shashi Tharoor.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Shashi Tharoor </a> </div> </div>
<p>NEW DELHI: Recent conciliatory moves by India’s nationalist government on its western flank have rightly aroused global interest.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, there have been reports of secret back-channel talks between Indian and Pakistani security officials – facilitated by the United Arab Emirates – aimed at easing bilateral tensions.</p>
<h3><a>READ: India's Modi discusses Kashmir elections in first talks since autonomy revoked</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: The US’ hasty exit from Afghanistan is a gift to the Taliban</a></h3>
<p>A February 2021 ceasefire along the Line of Control separating Indian and Pakistani forces in the disputed Kashmir region has so far held, permitting an atmosphere of near normalcy in the area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, India has kept two of its consulates in Afghanistan closed since last year, a long-standing Pakistani demand that it had resisted for two decades.</p>
<p>INDIA CAN’T AFFORD ESCALATING TENSIONS</p>
<p>Indian-Pakistani relations are at their lowest level in recent times, owing to a series of incidents, beginning with the terrorist attack on Mumbai in November 2008 and culminating in the 2019 Indian air strike on Balakot in Pakistan.</p>
<p>And the Indian government outraged Pakistan with its August 2019 decision to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its constitutionally guaranteed autonomy and reduce its status to a “union territory”, directly administered from Delhi.</p>
<p>The Pakistani government subsequently mounted a worldwide campaign, working especially with Islamic countries but also at the United Nations, to censure India and force it to rescind the move.</p>
<p>The Modi government had previously denounced some of them as corrupt dynasts, accusing them of milking the state for their own benefit.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: The shock and awe of India's move on Kashmir</a></h3>
<p>But now they were welcomed with sweet words and deferential protocol by Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah (India’s second most powerful politician) and other senior officials.</p>
<p>But it would be wrong to see the government’s recent talks with the Kashmiri leaders as an admission of defeat.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: India has a hidden COVID-19 crisis of food</a></h3>
<p>INDIAN-PAKISTAN TALKS HAVE SHIFTED GOALPOSTS</p>
<p>The other agenda items were elections across Jammu and Kashmir, and restoration of its statehood.</p>
<p>This could lead to a politically viable trade-off, whereby the central government gives Jammu and Kashmir statehood if state leaders agree to go quiet on Article 370 and leave the matter to the judiciary.</p>
<p>If that happens, as seems likely, Kashmiris will have the illusion of wresting a concession while the Modi government’s real victory – the revocation of autonomy two years ago – goes unchallenged by the Kashmiri parties.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: US withdrawal from Afghanistan is hollow victory for Pakistan</a></h3>
<p>Meanwhile, Pakistan’s global campaign against India to restore the state’s autonomy has gone nowhere.</p>
<p>The Indian government will thus chalk up another win if it enters new bilateral talks without making any real concession on the preconditions that Pakistan has been loudly declaiming for two years.</p>
<h3><a>READ: India vs Pakistan: A history of conflict over Kashmir</a></h3>
<p>Simmering Kashmiri militancy could boil over, while Pakistan – if it is unable or unwilling to stem terror attacks from its territory on Indian targets – could again prove duplicitous in its peace overtures.</p>
<p>There are too many unknowns for any side to have victory in sight. But for now, at least, India appears to be making the right moves.</p>

<p>After the number of cases declined from September 2020 to about end January 2021, the Indian government declared it had gained victory over the spread of the virus and that India was seeing the “endgame” of the pandemic.</p>
<p>India even increased its exports of vaccines and exported around 193 million doses. Lockdown curbs were eased with travel, local elections, religious gatherings and weddings permitted, albeit with some restrictions.</p>

<p>Little did the government know that things were about to take a very nasty turn. By January, India totally let its guard down even though experts were pointing to the possibility of new variants.</p>
<p>There was a sudden surge in April with new infections spiking to the highest ever at about 300,000 cases a day.</p>
<p>The spike was attributed to super-spreader events such as the festival of Kumbh in which about 4 million devotees bathed in the holy Ganges in Hardwar and returned to their homes.</p>
<p>Another string of events that caused grievous setback was the huge rallies during elections in the states of Assam, West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>This second wave saw the spread of the Alpha variant, first identified in the United Kingdom. Scientists also point to a new Delta variant behind India’s second surge.</p>
<p>This variant is also believed to be triggering new surges in Bangladesh and Pakistan. India began recording a dramatic increase in new cases from Apr 15 this year, with more than 200,000 cases daily.</p>

<p>The Government was finally seized by the seriousness and immensity of the problem facing the country, after the State Elections were completed, and drew up a cohesive action plan, in collaboration with the state governments.</p>

<p>VACCINATION AND DISCIPLINE IS KEY</p>
<p>Two-thirds of Indians have developed SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to an Indian Council of Medical Research released in July but 400 million are still vulnerable.</p>
<p>Still, immunity has increased compared to when the survey was last released six months ago, which showed only 25 per cent had COVID-19 antibodies.</p>
<p>The prevalence of antibodies could be due to the large number who had been infected with the virus. India has a recorded 31.4 million infections. Only 12.6 per cent are fully vaccinated as of Jul 20. </p>
<p>The only silver lining is that India may be reaching “herd immunity”.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Indonesia is Asia's new COVID-19 epicentre</a></h3>
<p>The other issue is ensuring sufficient vaccine supplies. The Indian government has made concerted efforts to ensure that adequate quantities of the vaccine will be available as soon as possible.</p>
<p>India has almost two dozen vaccine production units. Covishield produced by the Serum Institute of India in Pune and Covaxin of Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad, are the main suppliers of its vaccine drive.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Overwhelmed Indonesian hospitals with COVID-19 cases behind high doctor fatalities</a></h3>
<p>The multinational pharmaceutical company Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has teamed up with Russia to procure Sputnik V vaccines.</p>
<p>As the vaccination drive picks up, the Indian public has also grasped the need to maintain discipline given the devastating effects of the second wave.</p>
<p>Contributing to global knowledge of the virus, genome sequencing of the virus has been an important step taken to identify new potentially more infectious or deadly variants.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: India’s COVID-19 crisis could cause long-lasting economic scars</a></h3>
<p>The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia was therefore set up last year, bringing together 10 labs in the country, though India is sequencing just over 1 per cent of all samples at the moment.</p>
<p>This could also help India track new variants or upticks in infection, using real-time epidemiological and sequencing data.</p>
<p>Months after its deadly wave, India seems to have gained control over the spread of the virus and precautionary steps are being taken to avert a third wave.</p>
<p>The government’s efforts, citizenry discipline, along with so many people who have developed antibodies because they caught the virus, have appeared to calm India’s COVID-19 crisis but to avoid another hit, a sustained vaccination drive is critical.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why didn’t India take home more Olympic medals? </h1>
<div> <p>It was India’s best Olympic showing to date, but why wasn’t it near the likes of other major countries like China and the US? Aarti Betigeri explains.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aarti Betigeri </a> </div> </div>
<p>CANBERRA: India took home seven medals, including one gold, from this year’s Tokyo Olympics.</p>
<p>There have been two reactions: The first is, amazing! India has taken home its largest-ever medal haul! What an excellent achievement!</p>
<p>Both responses deserve consideration given the confounding situation of India at these Games. The world’s second-largest population is 48th on the list of Olympic medal-winners.</p>
<h2>INDIA’S BEST OLYMPICS SHOWING EVER</h2>
<p>Those who think we should revel in India’s moment of triumph aren’t wrong about the reasons for celebration.</p>
<p>Indeed, The Guardian labelled Tokyo “India’s greatest ever Olympics” after 23-year-old Neeraj Chopra won big in the men’s javelin event, throwing 87.58m for India’s first gold in athletics.</p>
<p>From one gold and two bronzes in the 2008 Beijing edition, to two silvers and four bronzes in London in 2012, and two medals in Rio, India’s quest for medals has been on an uneven but somewhat steady increase.</p>
<p>And yet one cannot help but ask why India does badly at the Olympics when it has produced otherwise world-class athletes.</p>
<p>It is home to Asian Wrestling Championships winner Vinesh Phogat, decorated archer Deepika Kumari and Boxing World Cup gold medalist Amit Panghal, all of whom are world number ones in their sport or category.</p>
<p>Part of that problem lies in larger economic, social and even spatial forces that rule over life in India, and the realities that large, well-endowed rich countries simply win more sporting medals while developing countries have other priorities.</p>
<h2>WHY THE DISMAY OVER INDIA’S MEDALS HAUL</h2>
<p>At the same time, India has traditionally neglected and underfunded its sporting sector.</p>
<p>Scholarships to incentivise and support the young on their Olympic journey, under TOPS or otherwise, hold the keys to unlocking India’s sporting dreams.</p>
<p>Rani Rampal, captain of the women’s field hockey team, put it best in an Instagram post. </p>
<p>Then there is Deepika Kumari, the world number one in women’s archery. Born to a rickshaw driver father, she grew up stealing tamarinds and bathing in the river when her village home had no bathrooms.</p>
<p>She has even revealed at one point that she and her family would often sleep with their stomachs empty. Both have been beneficiaries of India’s sporting scholarships and were close to securing a podium win this time around.</p>
<p>The TOPS scheme is a clear sign of India’s willingness to invest in its future Olympic sporting stars, and the recognition of the deep wealth-income divide that would otherwise keep talented players away from the field.</p>
<p>There is of course one sport that commands the most attention and resources in India: Cricket.</p>
<p>Cricket is treated with an almost religious fervour, far from any other sport, although a nascent soccer league is starting to gain traction.</p>
<p>The gentleman’s game has morphed somewhat on the subcontinent, with the Indian Premier League assuming the powerful status of the US Super Bowl, complete with teams, cheerleaders, and lots of flash and colour.</p>
<p>It has also brought enormous money to the game. The Indian cricket board, the BCCI, in January was valued at more than US$2 billion, tripling in value in just five years, with a large chunk attributed to the IPL.</p>
<p>Indian national cricket captain Virat Kohli earns up to US$3 million each year, not counting commercial endorsements. So it’s little wonder India will be pushing for the sport’s inclusion in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Hockey is traditionally India’s national sport, but has received relatively scant attention, although has benefitted from recent investment in various states, such as the Odisha government funding a new Astroturf field.</p>
<p>Still, the small wins in this Olympics may be a sign of better times to come. India’s sporting prowess in hockey had languished for years despite winning most of its medals in this sport - including eight out of its total 10 golds.</p>
<p>And yet, in Tokyo, the Indian women’s team beat Australia to reach the semi-finals, coming fourth overall, while the men’s team took the bronze - the team’s first medal in over 40 years.</p>
<p>Success could also beget success. Neeraj Chopra’s gold may be a shot in the arm for would-be athletes across the country, that drives further investment and resources.</p>
<p>So those seven medals might sound scant, but potentially represent real achievement against the odds, and an indication that India’s time on the podium may be coming.</p>
<p>Just give it a few more Olympics.</p>

<h1> Commentary: The Olympic-sized difference between India and China </h1>
<div> <p>Whereas India produces individual excellence despite the system’s limitations, individual success in China is a product of the system, says Shashi Tharoor.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Shashi Tharoor </a> </div> </div>
<p>NEW DELHI: The Tokyo Olympic Games are over, and the Japanese people and government have heaved a sigh of relief that the spectacle passed without a major COVID-19 outbreak in the athletes’ village or other disasters.</p>
<p>Here in India, the celebrations of the country’s first gold medal in the men’s javelin throw – and its best-ever medal performance at a single Olympics – have not yet subsided. But how good, really, is its best?</p>
<p>A decade or so ago, many spoke of India and China in the same breath. The two countries were supposedly the new contenders for global eminence after centuries of Western ascendancy.</p>
<p>Some even spoke of “Chindia”, as if they were joined at the hip in the international imagination.</p>
<p>But anyone seeking confirmation that such twinning is, to put it mildly, out of place, need only look at the medal tally in Tokyo.</p>
<p>China ranked a proud second, with 38 gold medals – one fewer than the United States – and 88 medals in total.</p>
<p>Now scroll down, past Belarus, divided Georgia, the Bahamas and even the breakaway province of Kosovo (whose independence India does not recognise).</p>
<p>There, in 48th place, sits India, with seven medals in all, one gold, two silver, and four bronze.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not a surprise. Whereas China has systematically strived for Olympic success since it re-entered global athletic competition after years of isolation, India has remained complacent about its lack of sporting prowess.</p>
<p>Indians, by contrast, wonder if they will ever crack the magic ceiling of ten medals.</p>
<p>China, seeing the number of medals on offer in kayaking, decided to create a team that would master a sport hitherto unknown in the Middle Kingdom.</p>
<p>But India has not even lobbied successfully for the inclusion in the Games of the few sports it does play well, such as kabaddi (a form of tag-team wrestling), polo or cricket, which was played in the 1900 Olympics and never since.</p>
<p>Likewise, China has developed new strengths in other non-traditional sports, like shooting, while maintaining its dominance in table tennis and badminton.</p>
<p>India, by contrast, has seen its once-legendary invincibility in field hockey fade with the introduction of artificial turf, to the point where a bronze for the men’s team in Tokyo prompted great exhilaration.</p>
<p>When it comes to sport, forget “Chindia” – the two countries barely belong in the same sentence.</p>
<h2>MILITARY DISCIPLINE VS SHAMBOLIC ORGANISATION</h2>
<p>India, by contrast, approached the Tokyo Olympics as it had every other, with its usual combination of amiable amateurism, bureaucratic ineptitude, half-hearted experimentation, and shambolic organisation.</p>
<p>That’s simply the way we are. If the Chinese authorities want to build a new six-lane expressway, they can bulldoze their way past any number of villages in its path.</p>
<p>But if you want to widen a two-lane road in India, you could be tied up in court for a dozen years fighting over compensation claims.</p>
<p>In China, national priorities are established by the government and then funded by the state; in India, they emerge from seemingly endless discussions and arguments among myriad interests, and funds have to be found where they can.</p>
<p>China’s budget for preparing its athletes for the Tokyo Games alone probably exceeded India’s expenditure on all Olympic training in the last 70 years.</p>
<p>So, whereas India produces individual excellence despite the system’s limitations, individual success in China is a product of the system.</p>
<p>Indians excel wherever individual talent is given free rein. The country has produced world-class computer scientists, mathematicians, biotech researchers, filmmakers and novelists.</p>
<p>But come up with a challenge that requires high levels of organisation, strict discipline, sophisticated equipment, systematic training and elastic budgets, and Indians quail.</p>
<p>Perhaps tellingly, the only Indians who have attained the title of world champion in recent years have been a billiards player and a chess grandmaster.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the much-favoured Indian shooters failed to win a single medal, owing to setbacks such as a malfunctioning trigger on a world champion’s pistol that could not be fixed quickly enough.</p>
<p>The best women’s table tennis player, denied the advice of her trainer, snubbed the official Indian coach, leading to disciplinary action. Our female archer, ranked first in the world, failed to get past her qualifying round.</p>
<p>India’s sporting talent pool is smaller than its large population suggests; in a country of existential challenges and intense competition for every opportunity, very few feel able or inclined to devote the time needed to master a sport.</p>
<p>The system is not designed to unearth athletic talent, and many who have it lack the health, nutrition, sporting infrastructure and training resources required to make a global mark.</p>
<p>India, unlike China, is a fractious democracy. China will win many Olympic medals for many Games to come. But India, perhaps, might win some hearts.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> India farmers end year-long mass protests against Modi reforms </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>NEW DELHI: Indian farmers formally ended year-long mass protests on Thursday (Dec 9) after Prime Minister Narendra Modi <a>abandoned his push for agricultural reforms</a>, defusing one of the biggest challenges faced by his government.</p>
<p>Thousands of people have been camped on the outskirts of the capital New Delhi since last year to campaign against laws that they said would have led to a corporate takeover of the sector.</p>
<p>Modi's administration rushed through a repeal of the laws last month in a rare backdown, and farmer representatives said that they agreed to stand down after the government agreed to other demands.</p>
<p>"Farmers' unity, peace and patience has been the key to the victory, and this will not be allowed to erode in any circumstance," said Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a coalition of farmers' unions, in a statement.</p>
<p>Protesters began disassembling their makeshift camps on the highways leading into the capital on Thursday.</p>
<p>They plan to wait until after a funeral for India's defence chief <a>General Bipin Rawat</a>, who died in a helicopter crash on Wednesday, before returning to their homes on the weekend.</p>
<p>Protests had carried on in smaller numbers after the repeal of the laws, with farmers seeking additional concessions including compensation for the families of the more than 700 farmers they say died during the protests.</p>
<p>The government agreed to that demand and also pledged not to prosecute those using fire to cheaply clear their fields - a practice that regularly shrouds Delhi in smog each winter.</p>
<p>About two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion population draw their livelihood from farming, and the sector has long been a political minefield.</p>
<p>Thousands of Indian farmers die by suicide every year because of poverty, debt and crops affected by ever more erratic weather patterns caused by climate change.</p>
<p>The three agricultural laws passed in September 2020 aimed to deregulate farm produce markets, where state bodies have for decades set guaranteed minimum prices for crops.</p>
<p>But the reforms became a lightning rod for opposition to Modi's administration by farmers, who said that the changes would have left them at the mercy of big business.</p>
<p>The protest sites on highways leading into Delhi turned into colourful, semi-permanent camps, with volunteers providing food, sanitation and even dentist surgeries and foot massage parlours.</p>
<p>One rally turned violent in January when a tractor convoy transformed into a rampage that embarrassed the government on Indian Republic Day, leaving one farmer dead and hundreds of police injured.</p>
<p>Modi's reversal came ahead of important elections for his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh states, both home to huge numbers of farmers.</p>
<p>Economists, however, said that the decision to repeal the laws doomed any prospect of fixing the agricultural industry's underlying problems.</p>
<p>"The government will always put political considerations such as state elections over sensible economic policy or environmental considerations," economist Mihir Swarup Sharma of the Observer Research Foundation think-tank told AFP.</p>
<p>"The failure to impose penalties for stubble burning is a serious setback to attempts to improve north India's air quality, which is the worst in the world by far."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> COVID-19 situation in India 'beyond heartbreaking': WHO chief </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>GENEVA: The World Health Organization chief voiced alarm on Monday (Apr 26) at India's record-breaking wave of COVID-19 cases and deaths, saying the organisation was rushing to help address the crisis.</p>
<p>"The situation in India is beyond heartbreaking," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.</p>
<p>He spoke as India battles a catastrophic coronavirus wave that has <a>overwhelmed hospitals</a>, with crematoriums working at full capacity.</p>
<p>A surge in recent days has seen patients' families taking to social media to beg for oxygen supplies and locations of available hospital beds, and has forced the capital New Delhi to extend a week-long lockdown.</p>
<p>"WHO is doing everything we can, providing critical equipment and supplies," Tedros said.</p>
<p>He said the UN health agency was among other things sending "thousands of oxygen concentrators, prefabricated mobile field hospitals and laboratory supplies".</p>
<p>The WHO also said it had transferred more than 2,600 of its experts from various programmes, including polio and tuberculosis, to work with Indian health authorities to help respond to the pandemic.</p>

<p>The country of 1.3 billion has become the latest hotspot of a pandemic that has killed more than 3 million people worldwide, even as richer countries take steps towards normality with accelerating vaccination programmes.</p>
<p>The US and Britain <a>rushed ventilators and vaccine materials</a> to help India weather the crisis, while a range of other countries also pledged support.</p>
<p>Since the virus that causes COVID-19 first surfaced in China in late 2019, the disease has killed more than 3.1 million people out of at least 147 million infected, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.</p>
<p>Tedros on Monday lamented that global new case numbers have been rising for the past nine weeks straight.</p>
<p>"To put it in perspective," he said, "there were almost as many cases globally last week as in the first five months of the pandemic."</p>
<p>The United States remains the worst-affected country, with some 572,200 deaths and over 32 million infections, followed by Brazil and Mexico.</p>
<p>But India, in fourth place, has in recent days been driving the global caseload.</p>
<p>The country, which has recorded over 195,000 deaths, registered 2,812 new deaths and 352,991 new infections on Monday alone - its highest tolls since the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>"The exponential growth that we've seen in case numbers is really, truly astonishing," Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead on COVID-19, told reporters.</p>
<p>She warned that India was not unique, pointing out that a number of countries had seen "similar trajectories of increases in transmission".</p>
<p>"This can happen in a number of countries ... if we let our guard down," she said.</p>
<p>"We're in a fragile situation."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Indian crisis has taken a toll on the Covax programme aimed at providing equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, with a particular focus on 92 poorer nations.</p>
<p>But once cases started surging, New Delhi froze exports - including to Covax - to prioritise India.</p>
<p>This has left Covax short 90 million doses that had been intended for 60 low-income countries in March and April, the WHO and Gavi said.</p>
<p>"Those have not been made available given the crisis in India. Now they're being used domestically," Gavi chief Seth Berkley told the briefing.</p>
<p>Covax, he said, was "looking at other options" while waiting for the supplies to resume.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Covax partners have appealed to countries that have excess vaccine doses to share them with the programme.</p>
<p>Berkley said that it was "early days" on those discussions, but so far France, New Zealand and Spain had vowed to share some of their doses.</p>
<p>To date, some 40.8 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been distributed to 118 countries and territories through Covax.</p>

<h1> Commentary: What happened to India’s Covaxin COVID-19 vaccine? </h1>
<div> <p>Vaccine triumphalism may have driven Covaxin’s approval and use in India. But this might end up undermining India’s global pharmaceutical status, says Aarti Betigeri.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aarti Betigeri </a> </div> </div>
<p>CANBERRA: India has taken great pride in Covaxin, its first home-grown COVID-19 vaccine developed early in the pandemic, which had been hailed as a success story of the immense capabilities of the country’s pharmaceuticals sector.</p>
<p>The problem is, Covaxin still has not been authorised by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use.</p>
<p>Since his election to office in 2014, one of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s key policy platforms has been “Make in India” - an emphasis on Indian manufacturing. </p>
<p>Most recently, he has trumpeted the success of the locally developed and manufactured Covaxin, the mainstay of India’s vaccination programme alongside Covishield, the WHO-approved Indian-manufactured version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.</p>
<p>But amid the hubris surrounding India’s manufacturing processes and somewhat successful vaccine rollout has been muffled concern about whether Covaxin’s fast-tracked national approval could end up hurting India instead.</p>
<p>There are questions about the lack of clinical trial data and whether there is sufficient transparency surrounding a vitally important part of India’s roadmap out of its COVID-19 situation.</p>
<p>Phase 3 data have not been published in a respected peer-reviewed journal – meaning there is not yet clear evidence of Covaxin’s efficacy against COVID-19. </p>
<h2>NOT RECOGNISED FOR INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL EXEMPTIONS</h2>
<p>In early January this year, Covaxin was authorised for emergency use in India, even though Phase 2 data had not been published nor peer-reviewed and Phase 3 trials were in progress.</p>
<p>National regulators, wanting to swiftly vaccinate a large population, made the decision to do so, triggering scepticism and questions from experts at the time.</p>
<p>The Indian media had reported in January that the WHO is set to approve it “soon”, then again in April, June, July and now September.</p>
<p>Covaxin was developed by Bharat Biotech, an Indian pharmaceutical company with a portfolio that includes 16 other vaccines, in partnership with the government medical research body, the Indian Council of Medical Research.</p>
<p>The vaccine works similarly to CoronaVac, the Chinese-developed Sinovac vaccine. Both are inactivated virus vaccines and use a complete but modified virus particle that cannot infect cells but will still stimulate an immune response.</p>
<p>Unlike mRNA vaccines, Covaxin can be kept at ordinary refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, rather than sub-zero storage.</p>
<p>There is also confusion and scepticism over the novel language used for Covaxin’s approval “in clinical trial mode” among the medical and scientific community. </p>
<p>I spoke to Dr Azim Khan, a public health professor at the US-based School for International Training (SIT). He is concerned that the secrecy and mixed messaging over Covaxin is building mistrust in the vaccine. </p>
<h2>PITFALLS OF VACCINE TRIUMPHALISM</h2>
<p>According to Dr Khan, India has already shown that it has been a world leader in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>A WHO decision has been promised in mid-September for now, but the delay in approval and the lack of publicly available Phase 3 data has eroded Indians’ confidence in their pharmaceutical sector.</p>
<p>This does not augur well for a country wanting to use its vaccine success as a springboard to global achievement. </p>

<h1> Commentary: India’s Taliban problem is really about China and Pakistan </h1>
<div> <p>Beyond the Taliban regime to its northwest, India grapples with a nuclear-armed, terrorism-supporting state to its west and a rival superpower to its northeast, says Shashi Tharoor.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Shashi Tharoor </a> </div> </div>
<p>NEW DELHI: In the weeks since the Taliban’s theocratic terrorists returned to power in Kabul, the people of Afghanistan, particularly its women and girls, have been subjected to unimaginable suffering as the world’s attention turns to other issues.</p>
<p>But many other countries, and especially India, have reason to worry.</p>
<p>The Taliban’s victory, following 20 years of unsuccessful American-led “nation-building” efforts in Afghanistan, will not only greatly embolden their fellow militants, but will also shake up the region’s geopolitics.</p>
<p>For evidence of the destabilising impact of Kabul’s fall, just look at the reactions of Afghanistan’s neighbours.</p>
<p>When the Taliban ruled the country from 1996 to 2001, their “Islamic Emirate” functioned as a wholly owned subsidiary of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency.</p>
<p>This time, Pakistan’s control is supposedly a little less absolute, but that did not prevent ISI chief Faiz Hameed from travelling to Kabul soon after its fall to preside triumphantly over the formation of the new Taliban government.</p>
<h2>OVERTURES FROM BEIJING</h2>
<p>Less overtly but arguably more importantly, China has been working to make the best of a delicate situation.</p>
<p>There is even talk of extending the CPEC to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The warm overtures appear to be mutual, with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Afghanistan’s new first deputy prime minister, calling China a “trustworthy friend”, despite its systematic persecution of its own minority Muslim population.</p>
<p>China’s priority vis-a-vis Afghanistan is to ensure that the Taliban offer neither support nor refuge to Uyghur dissidents from Xinjiang and do nothing to disturb the functioning of the CPEC.</p>
<p>With the Taliban government desperately in need of patronage – 80 per cent of the previous Afghan government’s US$5.5 billion budget was financed by external assistance – China seems ideally suited to fill the breach.</p>
<h2>AFGHANISTAN-PAKISTAN-CHINA AXIS A RISK FOR INDIA</h2>
<p>These regional dynamics, with Pakistan and China becoming increasingly close, should be of enormous concern to Indian policymakers.</p>
<p>Pakistan is a long-term adversary that has actively funded and fomented armed militancy against India, hosting (among others) the organisers of the murderous 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.</p>
<p>China, meanwhile, is a systemic rival to India and poses economic, military, and strategic threats. Any Afghanistan-Pakistan-China axis involving policy coordination is a major risk for India.</p>
<p>The Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan gives Pakistan not only the “strategic depth” its military has long sought against India, but also a useful recruiting ground for more militants and terrorists, should the ISI seek to deploy them again.</p>
<p>The last time the Taliban were in power, India made common cause with Russia and Iran in actively supporting the Panjshir Valley insurgency of the Northern Alliance under the late Ahmad Shah Massoud.</p>
<p>This time, however, an increasingly pro-Chinese Russia has taken a neutral stance on Afghanistan’s issues with India.</p>
<p>Iran, under its recently elected hardline president, Ebrahim Raisi, seems willing to accept the new Islamic emirate as long as the Taliban refrain from the anti-Shia persecution that characterised their previous reign.</p>
<p>If Afghanistan’s Shia Hazaras and culturally Persian-influenced Tajiks and Uzbeks are saved the worst of what the Taliban inflicted upon them a quarter-century ago, Iran may stay neutral.</p>
<p>Both Iran and Russia are, in any case, pleased that the United States has received its comeuppance in Afghanistan.</p>
<h2>INDIAN DIPLOMATS IN TOUCH WITH TALIBAN</h2>
<p>India could try to reach out to the new government in Kabul, despite recently denying that its external affairs minister met with Taliban representatives in Doha in June.</p>
<p>Other Indian diplomats certainly were in touch with Taliban officials, two of whom – Baradar and Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, the deputy foreign minister – are in the new Afghan government.</p>
<p>Moreover, the end of the US troop presence in Afghanistan reduces America’s logistical dependence on the Pakistani security establishment, depriving the ISI of support and resources.</p>
<p>India has invested US$3 billion in Afghanistan – in dams, highways, electricity grids, hospitals, schools, and even the parliament building. With all this now in Taliban hands, Indian policymakers may be forgiven for feeling despondent.</p>
<p>And Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has done itself no favours with its consistently anti-Muslim rhetoric and domestic policies, which are likely to stoke resentment across the Islamic world.</p>
<p>India now has a Taliban regime to its northwest, a nuclear-armed, terrorism-supporting state to its west, and a hostile superpower to its northeast, and it faces ongoing threats to its territorial integrity.</p>
<p>In this environment, maintaining national security and regional stability will pose an unprecedented challenge for Indian diplomacy in the months and years ahead.</p>

<h1> Can acai prevent heart disease? What you should know about this on-trend fruity treat </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Anne-Marie Lim </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: If you have ever made a New Year’s resolution to eat more healthily, you may have googled “superfoods” and chanced upon acai.</p>
<p>The fruit from Brazil saw a popularity boom in the early 2000s in the United States and has made its way to Singapore, where images of acai bowls topped with strawberries, banana and granola are a draw for health-conscious customers.</p>
<p>Acai (pronounced ah-sah-ee) is widely touted as a superfood rich in antioxidants, fibre and fats that are good for the heart.</p>
<p>But does it mean your S$10 or S$15 acai bowl or smoothie can help to stave off heart disease and aid in weight loss, as some have claimed?</p>
<p>Acai is a palm that grows in the river systems of the Amazon, from Bolivia to Brazil.</p>
<p>There are two main varieties of the acai palm, whose scientific name is Euterpe oleracea, and its fruit — about the size of a large blueberry — contains a single seed. The ripe fruit is either deep purple or green.</p>
<p>This may surprise some people, but the answer is no.</p>
<p>Acai, in its original form, has an earthy beetroot taste tinged with a hint of dark chocolate, said Jacqueline Koay, the founder of Gratefood Company, which supplies organic acai berry and other plant-based foods for customers in Singapore.</p>
<p>In the Amazon delta, local communities eat the fruit very differently, chiefly with fish.</p>
<h2>SO WHY IS AN ACAI SMOOTHIE SWEET?</h2>
<p>Usually, the acai that people eat in cafes is sweetened. “For the cafes we see around town, they all have to sell the sweetened acai, otherwise it wouldn’t be delicious because acai on its own isn’t sweet,” said Koay.</p>
<p>She first encountered acai around 2014 in Sao Paulo, Brazil, when she was a cabin crew member. Staff at the hotel where she was residing recommended acai after she had constipation from eating too much meat.</p>
<p>They said acai was “very high in antioxidants … very healthy, and the locals ate it all the time for breakfast and even for lunch”, she recalled.</p>
<p>Gratefood also sells unsweetened acai, which is more popular with people who buy take-home packs of the pulp to make their own treats.</p>
<h2>IS IT REALLY FULL OF ANTIOXIDANTS?</h2>
<p>Acai berries start to ferment, however, right after they are harvested. This means they are not readily transportable and must be processed where they are grown, said Emily Niemeyer, a professor of chemistry at Southwestern University in Texas.</p>
<p>They are soaked in water to soften the skin and pulp, which are separated from the seed and then frozen, said Koay. Even in many parts of Brazil, acai is consumed frozen, she added.</p>
<p>The antioxidant properties vary widely in the various forms of acai supplements, like capsules, frozen pulp, liquid and powder.</p>
<p>Niemeyer was involved in a study that looked at 20 of these supplements. It found that over half of the supplements contained little or no acai fruit or had concentrations of acai chemical components that were substantially lowered by water.</p>
<p>The kinds of antioxidants in acai can also be found in strawberries, blueberries and raspberries, she said.</p>
<p>“(As with) a lot of those deep-purple fruits and vegetables … when you see that purple colour in there, it’s generally indicative (of) high levels of these anthocyanins.”</p>

<h2>HOW DID IT BECOME POPULAR, THEN?</h2>
<p>Acai boomed in the US after celebrity doctor Nicholas Perricone listed it as a “superfood” in his 2003 book on looking younger and living longer, according to a 2011 report in The New Yorker.</p>
<p>He appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show in the year following the book’s publication and talked about the fruit’s benefits.</p>
<h2>IS ACAI A TRUE SUPERFOOD? IS THAT WHY IT’S EXPENSIVE?</h2>
<p>“Superfood” is mostly a marketing term, and no one set of criteria defines it.</p>
<p>Koay, who advocates a “holistic approach” to diet, agreed that the portrayal of acai as a superfood is “marketing”, and said it is not right for sellers to claim that it fights cancer or helps with weight loss.</p>
<p>She said acai is “not very expensive”, however, with prices of Gratefood’s frozen pulp comparable to prices of blueberries or at a juice bar.</p>
<p>A 400-gramme box of Gratefood’s pasteurised frozen acai pulp sells for upwards of S$12 (S$3 per 100g pack), while 125 grammes of fresh blueberries cost upwards of S$3.50 at NTUC FairPrice.</p>
<p>The fact that acai grows only in specific regions, and the processing costs, could be factors in its selling price.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that the flesh makes up only a small part of the berry — the seed makes up about 80 per cent — said Hope Johnson, a senior lecturer at the Queensland University of Technology in Brisbane.</p>
<p>Then there are other factors. “If you’re making big claims that it’s sort of this mystical, healthy thing, then … there’s also this premium that you can charge,” said Johnson, who researches food and agricultural law, regulation and governance.</p>
<p>“In fact, if you’re trying to convince people that you have a special product that has special benefits, then that price premium is part of that selling point.”</p>
<p>According to the US’ National Centre for Complementary and Integrative Health, there is “no definitive scientific evidence” to support the use of acai for “any health-related purpose”.</p>
<p>“No one food product is going to give you amazing health outcomes or the perfect body or rewind the clock (on ageing),” said Johnson.</p>
<p>Instead of eating so much of one food, people should consume wholegrains and vegetables of “different colours and varieties” and follow national dietary guidelines, she added.</p>

<h1> How an illegal logger’s switch to a greener job shows a way to save Indonesia’s forests </h1>
<div> <p>A climate finance scheme in Central Kalimantan is protecting peat forests while funding more viable livelihoods and better education. The programme Insight finds out more.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Neo Chai Chin </a> <a> Lewa Pardomuan </a> </div> </div>
<p>CENTRAL KALIMANTAN: He began illegally cutting trees when he was 13 or 14, after completing elementary school.</p>
<p>Central Kalimantan native Alianur had to help his parents out, so he accompanied his father on trips despite the risk of getting caught by the forestry police. Treks into the forest took two hours, he recalled.</p>
<p>The lack of education forced him to continue on this path. When he had a family of his own, logging missions meant being away from his wife and children for a month at a time.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I worked with friends, but sometimes I was alone, and the risk was quite high,” the 40-year-old told <a>the programme Insight</a>. “Inside, the forest was really calm. We could only hear the birds chirping.”</p>
<p>Three years ago, he decided to switch to making coconut sugar.</p>
<p>He received training by a company called Rimba Makmur Utama, which manages about 157,000 hectares of land including peat forests in Central Kalimantan. That is more than twice the size of Singapore.</p>
<p>And the company has adopted a climate finance model that could play an important role in saving Indonesia’s, and the world’s forests.</p>

<p>‘STRONGEST DEFENCE AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE’</p>
<p>Forests are the "strongest defence against climate change", said Kiki Taufik, global head of advocacy group Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s forest campaign.</p>
<p>But between 2001 and 2019, Indonesia lost 9.6 million hectares of forests, according to data from the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. About 56 per cent of it happened in pulp and paper, palm oil and logging concessions, he said.</p>
<p>The country is now losing about 0.4 million hectares of forests a year, noted scientist Herry Purnomo of the Centre for International Forestry Research.</p>
<p>Rimba Makmur Utama, however, protects and restores the peat forests within its Ecosystem Restoration Concession granted by the government — in a project called Katingan Mentaya, named after two rivers that flow there.</p>
<p>Peatlands are made up of partially decomposed plant matter and store large amounts of carbon, which is released into the atmosphere if the land is drained or burned.</p>

<p>Rimba Makmur Utama also protects the habitats of species such as the Bornean orangutan and creates sustainable employment for local residents like Alianur.</p>
<p>“We can provide better livelihoods for them, better education, better health,” said chief executive Dharsono Hartono, who co-founded the company in 2007.</p>
<p>In doing so, it has avoided over 30 million tonnes in carbon emissions.</p>
<p>In general, forest carbon credits cost between US$5 and US$10 each.</p>
<p>Although 2020 was dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic, Dharsono said it was a good year as clients continued to buy credits, certified by third parties.</p>
<p>“More and more, customers understand the value of protecting nature,” he said. “Of course, we still have a long way to go.”</p>
<p>WHAT MORE MUST INDONESIA DO?</p>
<p>Ruandha Agung Sugardiman, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry’s director general of climate change, said Indonesia aims to further reduce its annual rate of deforestation to 250,000 hectares by 2030.</p>
<p>“This is an extraordinary effort, especially on the part of law enforcement. Our main emphasis is on forest and land fires,” he said.</p>
<p>Spatial technology has made it easier to identify areas that have been illegally logged.</p>
<p>“Based on satellite images, we’d send our team and conduct an investigation on the ground. We’d know the size of the areas affected by illegal logging, the amount of wood and we can immediately calculate the damage,” he said.</p>
<p>“Big companies won’t be able to escape because of the extremely heavy sanctions. It could be administrative sanctions or criminal sanctions.”</p>
<p>Indonesia also aims to rehabilitate 12 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 using funds from its state budget and international supporters, said Ruandha. In addition, it aims to restore two million hectares of peatland by 2030.</p>
<p>Environmentalists said the authorities are heading in the right direction, but challenges such as transparency in land permits, enforcement and business interests persist.</p>

<p>The lack of transparency and public access to Indonesia’s land concession maps also make it difficult to know where exactly various concessions lie — coal mining or oil palm, for instance — where they overlap and where community areas are, he cited.</p>

<p>In the meantime, projects such as Katingan Mentaya are making a difference.</p>
<p>Citrus farmer Aliansyah, 55, used to clear land using the slash-and-burn technique, but stopped five years ago after he received training in alternative land-clearing methods.</p>
<p>“If you clear the land by burning it, the plants can only grow once. If we do it organically, the trees would grow well,” he said. “I support that approach.”</p>
<p>These days, Alianur gets to spend more time with his family in Sampit district and no longer has to worry about getting caught by the police.</p>
<p>In his former life, he was nabbed twice and said he had to pay bribes of around 500,000 rupiah each time to avoid jail.</p>
<p>Amid the pandemic, he can earn around four million rupiah a month — demand for coconut sugar, produced in Katingan Mentaya’s buffer zone and used in cooking and baking, has held up.</p>
<p>“If forests vanish, maybe people in Kalimantan will vanish too,” he said.</p>
