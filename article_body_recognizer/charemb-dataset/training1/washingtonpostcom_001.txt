<div><p>The debris of Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol now belongs to history</p></div>
<div><div><p>Serrano is again working with highly combustible material. His aim, he says, is a personal sense of objectivity, not condemnation.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Insurrection was always the goal.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Is this film a parody, or satire? Could its studied ambiguity be misconceived and embraced as a genuine piece of Trump propaganda?</p></div></div>

<i>I also find it curious that these “constant posters” rarely notice my personal posts. Maybe I'm not looking at this correctly, but I see social media as a way of connecting with family and friends, not as a vehicle for divisiveness.</i>
<div><div><p><i>I see it as a give-and-take. Ideally, we would both notice, “like” and sometimes comment on one another’s posts. What do you think?</i></p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>It may give a neater look</b> to the table, which makes it an issue for the hostess. Miss Manners only gets involved if the alternative is calling an ambulance for Grandpa Kevin, whose eyesight is not his strongest feature.</p></div></div>
<div><p><i>On the day of the event, she called to tell me she would be keeping her ticket, as her conflict had been resolved. She kept saying that she was sorry for the confusion, but as she was now able to attend, she was keeping her ticket.</i></p></div>
<div><div><p><i>I just told her to enjoy herself and that I understood, and got off the phone. Personally, I am not feeling good about the turn of events. It has left a bad taste in my mouth.</i></p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amy Dickinson</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 12:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Dear Amy: </b></i><i>During the current climate of hibernation and cautious socialization, it’s appropriate to prioritize your family’s well-being.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>But may I say something in defense of hard-working hosts as well?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>After a two-year hiatus, we restarted our annual Christmas party.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Asking guests to “vaccinate or hibernate” and other clear measures were taken. And of course, anyone uncomfortable should have politely declined.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I still ran into the same rudeness that has befuddled me since I began hosting social gatherings years ago, so I thought I’d share a few ground rules that should be revisited.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Maybe during this downtime, we’ve forgotten the “duties of a good guest":</i></p></div></div>
<p><i>You’re a guest, so act like one. Be a sparkling conversationalist. Or wear a festive sweater we can discuss. Bring a fun gift or story to tell. Guests DO have an obligation to not sit silent and sullen. It’s a party, folks.</i></p>
<div><div><p><i>If you cannot make it, immediately and politely decline the invitation. A lot of time and resources go toward planning a party and your hosts will appreciate this.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Parties are not akin to restaurant reservations that you can cancel at the last minute when something more attractive comes along.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>The coronavirus pandemic has created a decline in the social skills of our young.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Let’s lead by example in demonstrating how to be a good guest.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>— Harried Hostess</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Harried:</b> I appreciate your “good guest” tips. Now, I’d like to add to/rebut some of them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amy’s “duties of a good guest":</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pay attention to your health. Always remember that people you come in contact with at a party might also have an elderly/compromised/unvaccinated family member in their daily lives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Don’t proselytize or publicly challenge other guests’ health-related choices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Don’t offer me a share in your stash of online hydroxychloroquine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wear a mask if you want to.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Introduce yourself by name to people you haven’t met and ask them a question or two. Listen to their responses.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Don’t bring along your dog, unless invited.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Put your phone away, unless you are showing me pictures of your uninvited dog.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you are feeling sad, lonely, pensive or not particularly “sparkling” on the night of the party — you can sit next to me.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><i>My complaint is not with them, but with so many grandmas around who quiz me about my lack of grandchildren.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I usually answer them by saying I don’t know what my adult kids’ plans are.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>This is followed by being inundated with pictures of their grandchildren.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I am happy for them, but just want to yell STOP.</i></p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>Not a Grandma: </b>You might offer a more definitive statement by responding, “Oh, I think that ship has sailed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Your real complaint seems to be the fact that you are overwhelmed by looking at pictures of other people’s grandchildren.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><i>This year was the first year since my childhood lists to Santa that I actually provided a gift list.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>It was amazing, I wrote down how I wanted silver, so my grandpa went and gave silver coins for everyone in the family.</i></p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Carolyn Hax</div></div>Advice columnist </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 12:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><a><i>Adapted from an online discussion.</i></a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>When I asked why he was with me if he felt that way, he laughed and said because I was hot and it made his friends jealous.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>— My Boyfriend Thinks I’m Boring</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>My Boyfriend Thinks I’m Boring: </b>He seems nice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even if he just made that all up, then you have to reckon with the fact that when this guy gets angry, he becomes a verbally abusive jerk. And then tries to charm-wash it all away.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But, ahem: “He's pushed me to 'loosen up' before.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, instead of wondering whether he ever loved you, it's time to ask yourself whether you really love him — and why.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You don't stay because you think you owe someone forgiveness; you stay because you feel your best with this person.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Readers' thoughts:</p></div></div>
<p>· Maybe he did make it up, but regardless, he’s demonstrated that’s where his mind goes when he’s out to hurt someone. There are people to whom it would never occur to go there, no matter how badly they feel provoked.</p>
<div><div><p>If I could go back in time, I would break up with him then and there. Instead we got married, and his verbal abuse slowly escalated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Your uneasy feeling is your instinct trying to protect you. Please listen to it and get away from this guy. Divorcing a person who is capable of being that nasty is a nightmare.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>· Oh, honey. He told you who he is. Believe him.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Tim Carman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022|Updated January 4, 2022 at 4:58 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>Homemade vs. the Internet</a>.”
<div><div><p>Gurjar, then 30, was hired at an annual salary of $50,400. Tane, then 24, received $72,000.</p></div></div>
<a>Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list</a>.) Cohen, like the Resnicks, is named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
<div><div><p>Gurjar and Henry-Bohoskey said they had hoped Cohen, despite his youth, would become a mentor. But, according to the lawsuit, Cohen “became an immediate and active participant in the abuse,” an allegation he denies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cohen, the plaintiffs allege in their suit, at one point discouraged Gurjar from having a child, implying work comes first. (Cohen denied he said this; he said he was talking about how he didn’t want to have children.)</p></div></div>
<b> </b>alleged in interviews. But when they complained they were overwhelmed, they would find little relief. Worse, they said, Cohen or the Resnicks would accuse them of not being team players or “tone police” their attitudes.
<div><div><p>Cohen, the women allege in the suit, would also brush off their complaints about Giora Stuchiner, Feedfeed’s art and experiential director until 2020, an allegation Cohen denies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Several current Feedfeed employees told The Post that Stuchiner never used the word “gangbang” or directed it at the account manager.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>already had a strained relationship with Stuchiner because he had described Bushwick, where Feedfeed has an office and where Henry-Bohoskey used to live, as “sketchy” in the comments to an
<a>Instagram video</a>. At the time, Henry-Bohoskey alleged, she told Stuchiner the remark came off as racist given the many families of color in the area.
<p>“I felt like I was on the spot and I couldn’t <i>not</i> answer him,” Henry-Bohoskey said. She said she gave him a brief history on newly freed Blacks, their relationship with watermelon and how Whites stigmatized the fruit.</p>
<div><div><p>“I regret it to this day,” Henry-Bohoskey said about answering the question.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They have never relinquished their control over the mundane,” said Molly Adams, former digital food director, who quit in September.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Berger said the company disagreed with the overtime claims, but “to the extent there was any inadvertent underpayment during their employment, we wanted to make sure they were compensated.”</p></div></div>
<p>Former employees said in interviews that the Resnicks’ leadership could be mercurial, that editorial procedures and duties could change without warning, leaving employees feeling as if the ground was constantly shifting under their feet.</p>
<div><div><p>“A lot of times [Julie’s] ask would be like, ‘Can you just pull something out of thin air with all the free time that you have?,’” said Tane, who was laid off early in the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<p>But shifting on the fly is the nature of the digital media industry, Berger said. “Feedfeed employees have always been encouraged to speak with their supervisors and/or the Resnicks if they have concerns about their workload,” he added.</p>
<div><div><p>In testimonials provided by the company, some current employees praise the founders.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>“The Resnicks hire people they believe in and who have the creativity and knowledge to move the company forward.”
<div><div><p>“We understand if you want to move on and find a new job as an art director at a different organization,” Julie wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Having the minimum experience on paper doesn’t make one qualified for a job,” Berger responded.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gurjar and Henry-Bohoskey allege in their complaint that discrimination played a role in their slow advancement, while they watched White employees rise faster and higher. But Berger disputed that.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>told The Post. But driven by the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020
<b> </b>following George Floyd’s murder, she began reading more about systemic racism, decolonization and social justice. She started standing up for herself and for racial diversity at Feedfeed.
<div><div><p>“The world wants food media companies to rightfully hire more diverse staff. We have that diversity,” Dan wrote. “So why would we not be leveraging it.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>“crazy rich Asians” comment and Stuchiner’s heated exchange with the account manager, among other incidents. It was co-signed by Henry-Bohoskey, Tane and Dolfi.
<b> </b>from the Resnicks on her shoots than another photographer on staff.
<div><div><p>“It would just be so ridiculous, like asking her to source things in a pandemic that are like, ‘Do you have edible flowers? Can you find gold dust?’ Just crazy stuff,” Dolfi told The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was crying all the time. I was not able to eat. I was not functioning very well,” Gurjar said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Dec. 23, she quit. Two months later, she started as an associate food editor at Bon Appétit, which<a> had gone through a racial reckoning in 2020</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About a month later, on Jan. 29, as Henry-Bohoskey was training the person she thought was her replacement, she also resigned, even though<b> </b>she was pregnant and would sacrifice state-mandated maternity leave.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was worth it,” she said. “I was just so miserable.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Devlin Barrett</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 7, 2021 at 11:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The Justice Department has closed the latest federal investigation into the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till in rural Mississippi, a case that horrified the country and galvanized the civil rights movement.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Till, a Black 14-year-old visiting from Chicago, was murdered after he was accused of whistling at and making sexual advances toward a White woman, Carolyn Bryant, during an interaction at Bryant’s grocery store in Money, Miss.</p></div>
<div><p>Federal authorities reopened the case three years ago, after a new book reported that Bryant had denied in an interview that Till had made any advances. In theory, that could have meant she lied in decades-old court proceedings.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Justice Department officials met Monday with members of Till’s family to inform them of the decision to close the case.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How the mother of Emmett Till sparked the civil rights movement</p></div>
<div><div><p>Till was kidnapped on Aug. 28, 1955, tortured and shot. His mangled body was found days later in the Tallahatchie River and taken to Chicago for burial. Thousands waited in line to bear witness.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Photographs of Till’s corpse — which at his mother’s insistence was kept in an open coffin for the world to see — became some of the most consequential images of racial violence against African Americans.</p></div>
<div><div><p>A 2017 book, “The Blood of Emmett Till,” by historian Timothy Tyson, includes the first-known interview with Bryant.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The book said Bryant told Tyson that Till had not come on to her sexually, a disclosure that directly contradicted her testimony six decades earlier, when she told a jury that Till grabbed her by the waist and uttered obscenities.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“That part’s not true,” Tyson quotes Bryant, now in her late 80s, as saying. “Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Read the FBI’s explanation for why it closed the probe in the Emmett Till case</p></div>
<div><div><p>Tyson said years ago that someone from the FBI contacted him a few months after his book was published and he gave the FBI agent “everything he wanted to see.” His research materials were subpoenaed, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>The death and history of Emmett Till fades in this Mississippi town</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>He said he does not know why Donham decided to talk to him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve wondered that myself, but I can’t read her mind,” Tyson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Federal and state officials have reinvestigated the murder case in recent decades, but none of the probes have resulted in new charges.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2004, the Justice Department was asked to consider prosecuting other subjects who may have been involved in Till’s slaying. The FBI reopened the investigation, and Till’s body was exhumed in 2005.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But officials later decided it had no jurisdiction because the statute of limitations had expired on potential federal crimes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2007, the case was referred to the state prosecutor for Mississippi’s Fourth Judicial District, but a grand jury declined to issue new charges.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>It is rude to</b> inquire of a would-be gift-giver if one should expect a bill. This is unfortunate, given how many people these days appear to be confused about the underlying concept.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Dear Miss Manners:</b> My brother-in-law passed away suddenly, and his wife is planning to have a "celebration of life" memorial. That's fine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>However, she and her husband were party people, and so are their friends. The memorial she is planning is described as a "happy" party.</p></div></div>
<p>Much of the rest of the family doesn't want to drive all the way there and back (six hours each way) just to sit around watching people drink. There's some discussion of having a more somber (and sober) memorial closer to home for the family.</p>
<div><div><p>I think this shows disrespect to our lost loved one and his wife (though I'd prefer to attend that memorial myself). Suggestions on what we should do?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Picking a fight</b> with the principal mourner after a funeral is no more productive than picking a fight with a bride. Less so, as the mourner is often more sympathetic -- and more likely to burst into tears.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The distant relatives may send heartfelt condolences -- and apologies -- in place of themselves. As a closer relative, you may have to frown and bear it, especially if your brother-in-law’s wife is also your sister.</p></div></div>

<div> <div> <h1>Ask Amy: Mom wears a thong; daughter want to follow suit</h1> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div> By Amy Dickinson </div> <div> <div> Amy Dickinson <div> Email Bio Follow </div> </div> </div> </div> <div> November 11, 2017 </div> </div> </div>
<p> <b>Dear Amy:</b> I am a 31-year-old mom. My daughters are 7 and 5.</p>
<p>When we go to the beach, I always wear a thong or G-string bottom. My daughters have started to scrunch their bathing suit bottoms so their suits look like mine.</p>
<p>When we were shopping for new suits, my 7-year-old asked for a thong or G-string suit, just like the ones I wear.</p>
<p>She could not find one in the girls’ department and was very disappointed. My mother suggested that I buy a regular suit and take it to a seamstress and have it altered.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s appropriate for a 7-year-old to wear a thong or G-string bathing suit bottom. What do you think?</p>
<p><b>Wondering Mom: </b>A good and basic rule to remember (in this and all things) is: If you're wondering if something is appropriate, then it probably isn't. This applies to behavior and bathing suits.</p>
<p>The reason your daughters couldn’t find a thong or G-string bathing suit bottom in the girls’ department is because in this culture thongs and G-strings are considered “sexy,” and thus not suitable for children.</p>
<p>Children should be dressed in ways that make it comfortable for them to swim and play. They are not mini-adults and are not old enough to understand the sort of objectification that often accompanies the suit that you choose to wear.</p>
<p>And while I agree that this objectification is wrong, you should protect your daughters from it while they are young.</p>
<p> <b>Dear Amy:</b> My husband, his parents and his sister rotate hosting duties for Thanksgiving every year. It’s our turn.</p>
<p>My husband mentioned the restaurant plan to his mother, and she immediately said that they would not be participating. She wants a “traditional” Thanksgiving and said we were “lazy” for hosting at a restaurant.</p>
<p>She also told my sister-in-law that we must have money to waste and is trying to convince her to host Thanksgiving herself, instead of coming to the restaurant with us.</p>
<p>My sister-in-law is trying to make everyone happy and hasn’t committed to anything. My mother-in-law has dug in and refuses to discuss the topic with us anymore.</p>
<p>I am hurt by this reaction. However, I do not feel we should change our plans because of her, or just give in, when our intention was to do something nice. What should we do?</p>
<p><b>Wondering:</b> You need to realize that it's possible that if you announced to your mother-in-law that you were hosting at your home but would be serving lobster instead of traditional turkey, she might have a problem.</p>
<p>Many people have a specific vision of what this holiday is supposed to be about, and her vision seems to be one of you, laboring over a roasting pan, basting a turkey.</p>
<p>But if it’s your turn and whether you want to host this at a steakhouse, a Chinese restaurant or at the Tim Hortons on the highway, then your family should give it a try.</p>
<p>I’m not sure why Americans are so dug in about this particular meal; families can gather and bicker in many different dining environments. (You could also probably achieve your basic goals by having this meal catered at your home.)</p>
<p>I have two children. One needed to stay on a strict schedule, and the other didn’t. But families do need to learn how to go with the flow.</p>
<p><b>Experienced Parent:</b> Veering from a schedule can cause problems for some children, but family life is really all about balance. This was a time when the parents' needs should have allowed for some flexibility.</p>

<div><h1>Ask Amy: I refuse to provide a gift list for relatives, but they keep insisting</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amy Dickinson</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>December 21, 2021 at 12:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Dear Amy: </b></i><i>I was raised to not ask for gifts on special occasions such as Christmas, but to instead appreciate whatever someone wishes to give me, including no gift at all.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>This means that I don't make gift lists, even when someone asks.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I have been in a relationship with a man for almost a decade. We have one young child, with a second on the way.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>His family is a “list” family.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Since the beginning of our relationship, I have expressed I will not partake in this list-making for birthdays and Christmas.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>After the first few years, I learned that my partner had been making a list for me behind my back and giving it to them.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I was pretty upset and asked him to stop.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>This year I was asked directly again by one of his family members on an entire family group text to provide a list for me and our daughter.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I specifically stated I was raised not to make lists and will be teaching our children the same — so no lists for me or them!</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I mentioned that we have many hobbies and like trying new ones.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I also mentioned that I'd like to teach my children that it is not about the gifts, and that we'd be happy receiving anything or nothing.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I found out soon afterward that my partner again went behind my back — and made lists for me and our child (after they again asked him).</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I am at a loss. I feel a lack of trust and disrespect toward me trying to instill certain values in my children.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I am very upset and do not know how to handle this.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Please share your opinion.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>— Against Gift Lists</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Against:</b> What you don’t seem to understand is that many people simply don’t know where to start.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, by refusing to provide any guidance at all, you are making this whole process harder for these family members.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A lot of people really do want to give gifts that children will genuinely enjoy. But is your child into Legos or graphic novels? Do they love the science center or want to learn the violin?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Do they have a special wish or a collection the in-laws could add to?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This seems to have become a control thing for you, even though your goal seems to be the opposite.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is obvious that your partner's family does not know you very well, but by wanting to give you a gift you would need or enjoy they are trying to please you.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Letting them know the things you like (“I'm really into gardening this year”) will help to build a connection with them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Your children will be raised with extended families that have different styles. That's not a bad thing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Your attitude toward this so far doesn't seem to demonstrate tolerance, grace or gratitude: core values that you are obviously — and laudably — passing along to your children.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Dear Amy: </b></i><i>I have a somewhat trivial question, but maybe it’s a nice break from the heavy topics you usually cover.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Like just about everybody else in the world, when getting together with friends we often pass around various photos taken on our phones.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I have one friend who has the habit of taking the phone, looking at the picture, then scrolling through the rest of the photos.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I find this to be presumptuous and kind of an invasion of privacy.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I've taken now to showing the photo but hanging on to my phone.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Am I being too picky?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>— Just Curious</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Curious: </b>I’m certain I’ve probably done this, usually assuming there is another photo like the one I’m being shown, but from a different angle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I agree with you that this presents privacy concerns and is not polite.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We should all keep this in mind when sharing photos and videos in a group setting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you have identified one friend who consistently does this, you could gently point it out: “Would you mind not scrolling through the rest of my photos? I’ve got a screenshot of my nuclear codes on there.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Dear Amy:</b></i><i> “</i><a><i>Upset</i></a><i>” wrote to you about a conflict between a married couple about how to spend Christmas.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>So, your advice to this couple is that they should work things out as if they were in a holiday movie?!</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>And maybe Jimmy Stewart could stop by to guide them.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>— Not Convinced</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Not: </b>Absolutely. That’s the whole idea.</p></div></div>
