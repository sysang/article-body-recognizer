<div><div><p>“From June 1-Dec 29, the Front Range has been the warmest on record (by far),” tweeted Russ Schumacher, Colorado’s state climatologist on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Between June and November, Colorado’s statewide temperatures ranked in the top 10th percentile.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The combination of warm and dry conditions led to worrisome indicators of fire danger.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Rip-roaring winds</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gusts exceeded 70 mph at Boulder Airport on Thursday afternoon, and even topped 100 mph at more open, exposed areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These types of downslope wind storms, sometimes called Chinooks, are not uncommon in the Colorado Front Range. But this event was on the strong end of the spectrum.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Climate change connections</div></h3></div></div>
<p>This historic and devastating fire isn’t a one-off event, but fits into a pattern toward larger fires in both Colorado and other parts of the West in recent years, as well as an expansion of the fire season to practically year-round.</p>
<div><div><p>Scientists have published numerous studies tying more extreme fire behavior to higher temperatures and more intense drought, both linked to human-caused climate change.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“With CLIMATE CHANGE, there is no FIRE SEASON anymore,” tweeted Mike Nelson, chief meteorologist for Denver7, the city’s ABC affiliate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This fire disaster also casts light on the danger of building and development into the zones prone to wildfire or what scientists call the wildland-urban interface, which is becoming more vulnerable with climate warming.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Climate change only increases the risk from fire to people residing along this perilous interface.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our warming climate is enabling more opportunities each year human activities / infrastructure are providing ignitions,” tweeted Phil Higuera, a professor of fire ecology at University of Montana.</p></div></div>

<a><b>Winter storm warning</b></a>
<b> for the District and adjacent counties from 1 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday; </b>
<a><b>winter weather advisory</b></a>
<b> for Loudoun County and western Montgomery and western Howard counties and points north *</b>
<div><div><p><b>Key points</b></p></div></div>
<li>Precipitation to move in between midnight and 3 a.m., starting as rain but changing to sleet and then snow during the predawn hours as temperatures quickly drop.</li>
<li>The snow should taper off during the mid-afternoon hours from northwest to southeast. Total amounts of 3 to 6 inches are most probable in the immediate area, with more south and less north.</li>
<div><div><p><b>11 p.m. — Be prepared for heavy burst of snow in the morning, very difficult driving conditions. Chance of “boom” snow scenario increasing.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We’ll be back with coverage starting at 5 a.m. Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Tune in at facebook.com/jason.samenow</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>5:30 p.m. — We are slightly increasing our snowfall forecast</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest afternoon model simulations project the following amounts for the District:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>American (GFS): 10-15 inches</li><li>European: 9-10 inches</li><li>High-resolution Canadian: 7-8 inches</li><li>High-resolution NAM: 4-8 inches</li><li>HRRR: 6-8 inches</li><li>NAM: 2-4 inches</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>As noted earlier, these models incorrectly assume all snow will stick so we need to cut them back by about at least 25 to 33 percent to gain a more realistic sense of how much will actually accumulate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2:55 p.m. — Winter weather advisory upgraded to winter storm warning for District and surrounding counties</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A winter storm warning is also in effect farther south in north central Virginia and southern Maryland, where 5 to 8 inches of snow is predicted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A winter weather advisory covers our northern and northwest areas, including Loudoun, western Montgomery, western Howard and Frederick counties, where 1 to 3 inches are most likely.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Our forecast, explained below (and shown above), is generally consistent with the National Weather Service’s warnings and advisories and anticipated amounts. Our predicted totals are slightly less but not meaningfully.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Original story from 1:30 p.m.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We’re projecting about 2 to 6 inches of snow in the immediate area, but amounts could easily end up above or below that range. The heaviest amounts, potentially topping 6 inches, are most likely south of Washington.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The storm has the potential to bring the most snowfall to parts of the region since January 2019, when 6 to 12 inches fell.</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C.'s second-warmest December on record caps fifth-warmest year</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Amounts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While we’re forecasting 2 to 6 inches in the area, model simulations present a range of between an inch and more than a foot in portions of the region.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just a slight nudge north in the storm track could even bring such totals into the immediate D.C. area and northern suburbs. This possibility is reflected in our boom scenario.</p></div></div>
<div><p>January should bring colder weather and snow chances to D.C. area</p></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s how much snow different models project for the District:</p></div></div>
<ul><li>American (GFS): 16-18 inches.</li><li>HRRR: 10-12 inches.</li><li>European: 10-12 inches.</li><li>Canadian: 10 inches.</li><li>High-resolution Canadian: 8-10 inches.</li><li>NAM: 2-4 inches.</li><li>High-resolution NAM: 1-3 inches.</li></ul>
<div><div><h3><div>Storm timeline</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>11 p.m. to 2 a.m.:</b> Rain moves in from south to north. Temps falling to near 40.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2 a.m. to 6 a.m.</b>: Rain changing to sleet and snow. Temps falling toward the low 30s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>6 a.m. to 10 a.m.:</b> Snow, moderate to heavy at times. Temps in the upper 20s to low 30s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>10 a.m. to 2 p.m.:</b> Snowy with gusty winds over 25 mph. Temps in the upper 20s to low 30s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>1 to 4 p.m.:</b> Snow tapers to flurries from northwest to southeast. Breezy with clearing skies to the west. Temps in the low to mid-30s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Storm impacts and SchoolCast</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s possible our southern areas could face a Category 4 “major” event, while it’s more of a Category 2 “disruptive” event in our northern suburbs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow will initially be heavy, wet and pasty, great for snowballs and packing, but should transition to a somewhat drier consistency as temperatures fall toward 30 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Washington’s most significant weather events of 2021</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Forecast challenges and uncertainty</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The major forecast problems that will affect how much snow falls and where are:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>1) How much the warm ground and initially mild temperatures hold down accumulations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>3) Whether the sharp cutoff in significant snow accumulation occurs near the Beltway or closer to the Mason Dixon line. The models have been jumping around on how far north the northern edge of that corridor may set up.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>Key points</b></p></div></div>
<li>Snow has ended across the region. Totals around the immediate area mostly ranged from 5 to 10 inches, with up to a foot in our far southern areas. Amounts in our northern and far western suburbs were less, around 2 to 5 inches.</li>
<li>Reagan National Airport’s 6.7 inches were the most from a snowstorm since Jan. 2019.</li>
<li>Slushy areas to refreeze Monday night with lows near 20 degrees; another chance of snow Thursday night</li>
<div><div><p><b>Updates</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>3:15 p.m. — The forecast looking ahead brings another snow chance Thursday night</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This update ends our coverage of today’s snowstorm. Thanks for following along and stay safe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2:50 p.m. — Map of snow totals</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The National Weather Service has a preliminary list and interactive map with snowfall totals across the region. Here’s a zoomed in snapshot of the amounts in our area:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are some key observations:</p></div></div>
<li>In the immediate D.C. area and to the east and northeast, amounts were mostly between 5 and 10 inches</li>
<li>Amounts increased to 6 to 12 inches south and southeast of the Beltway</li>
<li>West of Fairfax County and north of Rockville, amounts decreased to 2 to 5 inches</li>
<li>Little or no accumulating snow fell north (or west) of southern Frederick and southern Carroll counties.</li>
<li>Airport totals: Reagan National — 6.7 inches; Dulles 3.9 inches; BWI Marshall — 6.8 inches</li>
<li>Highest total? Glendie in Stafford County with 13.4 inches</li>
<div><div><p>Our next and final update, coming around 3:15 p.m., will preview the forecast for the next few days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2:15 p.m. — Winter storm warning discontinued as snow ends</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Except for far Southern Maryland, radar shows all the snow has ended in the region and the winter storm warning has been discontinued.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We’ll post two more updates in the next hour rounding up snowfall totals and previewing the forecast ahead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>1:25 p.m. — Snow is ending in immediate area. 6.7 inches posted at Reagan National Airport, most since 2019.</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>Radar shows snow has ended along and west of Interstate 95 and is rapidly tapering off to the east. The only remaining accumulating snow is occurring in southern Maryland where it should gradually ease over the next couple of hours.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Reagan National Airport checked in with 6.7 inches of snow as of 12:45 p.m., according to observer Mark Richards. That is the most snow to fall in a single storm since Jan. 13, 2019, when the airport posted 10.3 inches.</p></div></div>
<div><p>While the snow is ending, the gusty winds are not. And with the snow caked to trees and power lines, new outages are possible until winds ease this evening and tonight. Gusts to 20 to 30 mph remain possible through the afternoon.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Here are some updated power outage numbers:</p></div></div>
<li>In Virginia, 430,000 customers are out statewide, with the greatest concentration in central and northern Virginia. Stafford County has 45,000 customers out, Fairfax County 40,000 and Prince William 27,000.</li>
<li>In Maryland, 70,000 customers are out statewide, with the greatest concentration in southern Maryland. Prince George’s, Calvert, Charles and St. Mary’s counties each have between 10,000-15,000 customers out.</li>
<div><div><p><b>12:35 p.m. — Jackpot snows hit Interstate 95 corridor</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Typically, in Mid-Atlantic storms, the heaviest snow falls north and northwest of I-95. In this event, it’s been the opposite. In Frederick, Md., there’s been no accumulation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are some select totals through 12:30 p.m.:</p></div></div>
<li>Fredericksburg: 12 inches</li>
<li>Springfield: 10-11 inches</li>
<li>SE Washington: 9 inches</li>
<li>Baileys Crossroads: 9 inches</li>
<li>Annapolis: 7 to 9 inches</li>
<li>Arlington: 6 to 9 inches</li>
<li>NW Washington: 7 inches</li>
<div><div><p><b>11:40 a.m. — Powerful storm continues to unload heavy snowfall, cut power</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As apparent by the above satellite image, this storm is a powerhouse. The combination of heavy snow and strong winds continues to generate downed trees and power outages across the region.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Power outages numbers are escalating:</p></div></div>
<li>About 50,000 customers are without power in Maryland, mostly in Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary’s counties.</li>
<li>Nearly 350,000 customers are without power in Virginia, with the greatest concentration in north central Virginia, including Stafford and Culpeper counties. Nearly 25,000 customers are without power in Fairfax County.</li>
<div><div><p><b>10:45 a.m. — Snow totals up to 8 inches south of D.C., generally 3-6 inches in immediate area. A bit more coming.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are a few select snowfall totals:</p></div></div>
<li>Silver Spring: 4-5 inches</li>
<div><div><p>In Southern Maryland and north central Virginia, totals generally range from 6 to 8 inches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>10:10 a.m. — Heavy, wet snow causing mounting power outages in north central Virginia, Southern Maryland and the District</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Outages are also starting to mount in Southern Maryland (about 10,000 customers without power) and even in the District (25,000 customers without power).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>9:35 a.m. — Storm near peak, with very heavy snow falling</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Snow is walloping the D.C. area, falling at rates of one to two inches per hour. The visibility has dropped below half a mile and winds are gusting to 20 to 30 mph.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Based on reports from readers and the National Weather Service, snowfall amounts generally range from about 2 to 5 inches, with the highest totals south and southeast of Washington. Here are a few select totals:</p></div></div>
<li>Northwest Washington: 2.5-3 inches</li>
<div><div><p><b>8:45 a.m. — Trouble on the roads</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We’re seeing increasing reports of very slow going on the roads and, in some areas, stopped traffic. We continue to advise folks to stay home for the next few hours as snow accumulates at a rapid clip on all surfaces.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some photos:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>8:25 a.m. — Snow falling heavily, roads snow-covered</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Temperatures in most spots have fallen to 31 or 32 degrees with the increase in snowfall intensity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s not only snowy but also windy. Reagan National Airport has clocked gusts from 25 to 30 mph in moderate to heavy snow in the past half-hour with visibility down to one-quarter to one-half mile.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Your best bet for the next few hours? Stay off the roads.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>7:40 a.m. — Snow becoming heavy, starting to stick to road surfaces</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We’ve even had our first report of thundersnow in Southern Maryland, near Lusby. Thundersnow will be possible in the region, especially from the District south over the next few hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>7 a.m. — Awaiting the heavier snow, arriving over next one to two hours</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Light to moderate snow continues falling, mostly accumulating to grassy areas. Air and ground temperatures, from 32 to 34 degrees, are still a bit too high for much accumulation on paved surfaces.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But over the next one to two hours, snowfall will increase in intensity from southwest to northeast causing temperatures to drop and this will result in deteriorating travel conditions and roads becoming snow-covered.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You can get a sense of what this storm is capable of by looking toward the southwest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>6:20 a.m. — Storm is just getting started; potential for very heavy snow and hazardous travel between 8 and 11 a.m.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>5:45 a.m. — Snow has rapidly developed over last hour, accumulation forecast bumped up</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Conditions will rapidly deteriorate over the next few hours as snow continues and temperatures, currently 32 to 34 degrees, drop a few more degrees.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Here’s what made Monday’s snowstorm so severe</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Jason Samenow</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Jeff Halverson</div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022|Updated January 4, 2022 at 12:16 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Jason Samenow</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Jeff Halverson</div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022|Updated January 4, 2022 at 12:16 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>Both sides of I-95 south of D.C. still blocked after snowstorm; drivers stranded overnight</p></div>
<div><div><p>The snow intensity Monday morning was simply too much for trees and road crews to handle.</p></div></div>
<p>In less than 30 minutes, bare, wet pavement turned white as snowfall rates leaped to one to three inches per hour. Visibility was reduced to less than a quarter-mile. In just a few hours, half a foot of snow had piled up in many locations.</p>
<div><p>Because temperatures hovered near freezing as the flakes poured down, they were heavy and wet — perfect for packing snowballs but perilous for tree limbs. As winds gusted over 30 mph, branches snapped under the snow’s heft.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How much snow fell across the region</div></h3></div></div>
<p>In the immediate Washington area, within about a county radius of the District, five to 10 inches were most common. But to the south, totals ballooned as high as 12 to 16 inches in the area around Fredericksburg and in parts of Southern Maryland.</p>
<div><div><p>The snowfall in the immediate Washington region was notable on several counts:</p></div></div>
<li>The 6.9 inches observed at Reagan National Airport was the most from a single storm in nearly three years (since Jan. 13, 2019).</li>
<li>More snow fell in a single day at National Airport than in the two previous winters combined (5.4 and 0.6 inches).</li>
<li>It was the third-biggest first snowfall of a season on record at National Airport, tied with a storm on Nov. 30, 1967. The biggest first snowfall on record was the 1987 Veterans Day storm.</li>
<li>It was the most snow on record the day after temperatures reached 63 degrees or higher.</li>
<li>The snowfall set Jan. 3 records at all three major airports. In additional to National Airport’s calendar day record of 6.9 inches, Dulles and BWI Marshall airports posted Jan. 3 records of 3.9 and 6.8 inches.</li>

<div><div><h3><div>Why so much snow fell</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The satellite image from 9 a.m. Monday shows a textbook “Hatteras Low” with an extensive band of precipitating cloud north of the warm front (warm front is shown by solid red line).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In north-central Virginia and Southern Maryland, where power outages were most numerous Monday, the ratios were around 7 to 1.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Farther north and west of the District, where colder surface air was emplaced, ratios were closer to 10 to 1, and the snow took on a slightly drier texture, particularly later in the evolution of the coastal storm.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The forecast was passable, though too conservative and late-coming</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>This snow event sort of snuck up on forecasters. For days, computer models showed a storm developing to the south but did not simulate much precipitation reaching the D.C. area.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you look at how much snow fell vs. how much we predicted, you see a pretty good match for the northern half of the region. We accurately predicted where heavy snowfall would start and stop.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>We’re still digging out from Monday’s storm, but it’s already time to begin tracking the next possibility for snow Thursday night.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Computer models simulate a probable period of snow arriving sometime late Thursday night (probably after 7 p.m.) and continuing into Friday morning (ending before 10 a.m.).</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here’s what made Monday’s snowstorm so severe</p></div>
<div><div><p>It’s too soon to predict exactly how much snow and where, but we can offer some probabilities for different amounts of snow in the District:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Chance of at least one inch: 60 percent</li><li>Chance of at least three inches: 30 percent</li><li>Chance of at least six inches: 5 to 10 percent</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Model discussion</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p><span>Picture-perfect scenes from Monday’s storm in Washington</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>The Canadian model snowfall pattern is similar to the American, with slightly lesser amounts of mostly two to three inches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The NAM model takes the storm on track that would produce up to two to six inches throughout the region, with the heaviest snow probably occurring north and west of the city because temperatures are coldest there.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“We gave up so many odd-man rushes trying to keep pucks in or just being on the wrong side of the puck,” Dowd said. “I think that just overshadowed our in-zone time a little bit.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Defenseman John Carlson brought the Capitals (20-6-8) within one with a snipe from the right dot with 46.6 seconds left in the first. It was Washington’s first four-on-four goal of the season.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Washington Capitals defenseman Martin Fehervary will play in a top-four role Saturday night against the Philadelphia Flyers, replacing Nick Jensen on the second pair with Dmitry Orlov. Jensen is a healthy scratch.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fehervary said he felt “pretty good” on Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Great opportunity, like you said, at the beginning of the season there were some injuries and it is a great opportunity for me to get into the lineup and I’m really happy about this chance,” Fehervary said.</p></div></div>

<div><p>It was his second goal of the season, matching his total from his first 141 games with the Capitals. Jensen, 31, has been one of team’s best players on a defense that began the season with its fair share of question marks.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But to start this season, Jensen has flashed his strengths. He had a rating of plus-2 in Monday’s back-and-forth affair, and he is averaging 20:04 of ice time, up from 17:36 over the previous two seasons.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jensen’s new running mate on defense is Dmitry Orlov. They have combined for seven points in six games; Jensen has those two goals and an assist, and Orlov <a>scored at New Jersey on Thursday</a> and has three assists.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jensen said he is focused on his timing and not giving up odd-man rushes and breakaways. He’s also trying to join the rush as often as possible.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Ovechkin will not receive supplemental discipline from the NHL for his hit on the Senators’ Nick Paul in the second period Monday. No penalty was called on the play.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ovechkin scored two goals in Ottawa, his sixth and seventh of the season. With 737 career goals, he is four shy of Brett Hull for fourth on the NHL’s all-time list.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Depleted Capitals can’t hold a two-goal lead and suffer a 3-2 loss to the visiting Kings</p></div>
<div><div><p>But instead, the coaches decided they wanted to keep him around. Craig Ramsay, Slovakia’s head coach, said there was just “something about him” that made Ramsay keep the dynamic, young player on the roster.</p></div></div>
<p>Ramsay remembers Fehervary’s attentiveness the most. Even though there was often a language barrier, Ramsay said Fehervary would look back at him, nod and say, “Okay, yeah, I can do that.” Then, he would go out and deliver.</p>
<div><div><p>There was no questioning or complaining, no wondering why something should be done differently than he anticipated. Fehervary accepted the challenge, no matter what it was.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Fehervary’s journey to the NHL has helped his development. Beyond the world championships, he also was able to spend time in the Swedish league and the American Hockey League after he was drafted in the second round in 2018.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Washington assistant general manager Ross Mahoney said Fehervary’s “character, effort, attitude [and] competitiveness” jumped out in the early stages of scouting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I can’t recall watching a game where I thought Martin’s effort wasn’t where it should be — it was always unbelievable,” Mahoney said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bruce Boudreau, now the head coach of the Vancouver Canucks, coached both Dmitry Orlov and Carlson, defensemen who were high draft picks and then made an immediate impact with the Capitals.</p></div></div>

<p>In early December, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said it would be up to the players to decide whether they wanted to participate in the Olympics. Bettman said the league wanted to act in “good faith” and let the players make the call.</p>

<div><div><p>The decision raises many questions that will need to be addressed over the coming days and weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With the Olympic break no longer needed, the league must figure out how to reschedule games that have been postponed. Many NHL arenas have been booked for other events in February, which could present difficulties.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, national hockey federations have to determine their Olympic rosters without the mainstays they had been expecting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And NHL veterans who might have been viewing the Beijing Games as their last shot at participating in the Olympics must cope with the disappointment of another opportunity missed.</p></div></div>

<a>coronavirus</a> cases and a wave of postponements in the league. The announcement,
<a>while expected</a>, still shut the door on many of hockey’s brightest stars — and opened up plenty of new questions.
<div><p>“Unfortunately, given the profound disruption to the NHL’s regular-season schedule caused by recent COVID-related events . . . Olympic participation is no longer feasible,” Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement.</p></div>
<a>notably Alex Ovechkin</a>, the Russian star and captain of the Washington Capitals, who released a lengthy statement expressing his disappointment.
<div><p>Svrluga: The NHL skipping the Olympics makes sense — and is a crying shame</p></div>
<div><div><p>NHL players last participated in the Olympics during the 2014 Sochi Games, <a>where Canada won the gold medal</a>. The NHL and the NHL Players’ Association expect they will return for the 2026 Games in Italy.</p></div></div>
<p>Luc Tardif, president of the International Ice Hockey Federation, said in a statement Wednesday that despite the shock of the decision, the federation “always operated with the understanding that this was a scenario that might occur.”</p>
<div><div><p>In the NHL, attention turns to a complex and shifting schedule, which is now expected to include rearranged games in what had been the Olympic break in February.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The NHL’s coronavirus surge will keep its players out of the Olympics. Here’s what to know.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Many arenas have been booked for other events in February, which could present multiple challenges. The NHL has started to reach out to teams and arenas to reschedule games, but there is not a firm plan in place.</p></div></div>
<a>according to its website</a>. Washington did not comment on the revised schedule or potential venue problems.

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Samantha Pell</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 9:04 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The other dad, who was there with his daughter, Lyla, told Howe he played hockey. Howe thought he must have misunderstood.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Oshie <a>had long been focused on hockey</a>.He played as a kid; he played in college. He was in the NHL. He was a star for the U.S. Olympic team. His life was at the rink. He had few obligations off the ice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All of this meant making friends, quite plainly, was hard.</p></div></div>
<a>seven seasons with the Capitals</a>, he has deeper ties to the Washington community, including a strong group of dad friends.
<a>broke his collarbone in 2019</a>, an injury that ended his postseason with the Capitals. Instead of playing for Washington, which
<a>ultimately lost to Carolina in the first round</a> of the Stanley Cup playoffs, he spent time with dads from Leni’s school. During the
<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic, the families helped one another out, going on Costco runs and finding toilet paper when stores were empty.
<div><div><p>At first, some of the fathers needed time to understand what Oshie did for a living, just as Howe did. A couple didn’t know anything about hockey. One went to his first game after he met Oshie.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I really thought about hockey 24/7, and it wasn’t good for me mentally,” he said. “I think it is about finding the right balance and good balance in life.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>It’s a balance Oshie, now years removed from that first day of preschool, seems to have found. He has won “dad of the year,” a team-voted award each season, Backstrom said, and “takes care of everyone.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I think with his energy, too, he is so social and makes the kids feel welcome,” Backstrom said. “He is great. Dad of the year.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Caps find a way to force overtime but then fall short in their duel with the Devils</h1></div>
<h2>What to know from Sunday’s 4-3 loss, which was their seventh overtime defeat this season</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Samantha Pell</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 6:19 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 6:52 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Capitals center Lars Eller had the puck on his stick for the potential game-winner just moments earlier, but the puck rolled on him, and he missed the net.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ll take 20 of those a year if I could,” Sheary said of Blackwood’s giveaway. “Kind of a fortunate bounce.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We gave up so many odd-man rushes trying to keep pucks in or just being on the wrong side of the puck,” Dowd said. “I think that just overshadowed our in-zone time a little bit.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Defenseman John Carlson brought the Capitals (20-6-8) within one with a snipe from the right dot with 46.6 seconds left in the first. It was Washington’s first four-on-four goal of the season.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Samsonov, playing in his third consecutive game, made 33 saves to keep the Capitals within striking distance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what to know from Sunday’s loss:</p></div></div>
<div><p>Last time out: Alex Ovechkin scores winner, then adds one more for good measure vs. Red Wings</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>More roster moves</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Friday’s win in Detroit</a> with a non-covid illness. Forward Michael Sgarbossa also was back in the lineup, and Aliaksei Protas was sent to the Capitals’ American Hockey League affiliate in Hershey, Pa.
<div><p>Defensemen Justin Schultz and Nick Jensen and forward Daniel Sprong were activated from the covid list. Jensen briefly left the game in the first period after blocking a shot by Severson but played normal minutes the rest of the way.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Center of attention</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>He has averaged 17:01 of ice time and has three assists.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Capitals still have played only one game with their four top centers: Backstrom, Evgeny Kuznetsov, Eller and Dowd. Sgarbossa filled in Sunday, serving on the third line.</p></div></div>
<div><p>NHL fan spotted staffer’s mole from the stands. Now he’s cancer-free, and she has a med school scholarship.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Power outage</div></h3></div></div>
<a>set the NHL record for career power-play goals in Friday’s win over Detroit</a>.
<a>an overtime loss at Chicago</a>. The previous time a Capitals player other than Ovechkin scored on the power play was defenseman
<a>Dmitry Orlov’s game-winner Nov. 28 at Carolina</a>.
<div><div><p>Washington managed just one shot on its lone power play Sunday.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The Washington Capitals have adjusted on the fly throughout their coronavirus-ravaged season. Their lineup has changed frequently, and in moments when the team has looked close to 100 percent, more adversity has arrived.</p></div></div>
<a>who had a rocky 2020-21 campaign but has avoided injury and illness this season</a>, left the ice.
<div><div><p>Capitals Coach Peter Laviolette did not have updates on Orlov or Samsonov after practice.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How preschool helped Caps star T.J. Oshie develop a work-life balance in Washington</p></div>
<a>Sunday’s overtime loss to New Jersey</a>, but McMichael played. Laviolette didn’t offer any details on the severity of Oshie’s and Backstrom’s ailments.
<div><div><p>“We got time to work on things and go over things and just parts of the system along with compete and speed,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Fehervary returns</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s great to see guys [back],” Carlson said. “No one wants to be away from the guys. No one wants to be away from the rink. It takes a toll on guys.”</p></div></div>
<a>returning to Washington after battling injuries and virus issues</a>. He has one assist in three games.
<div><div><p>Laviolette said Kempny has played well, but he is content with the six defensemen the Capitals had to start the season: Carlson, Fehervary, Jensen, Orlov, Trevor van Riemsdyk and Justin Schultz.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Kemps has been a contributor,” Laviolette said. “I think it all comes down to the roster and what we have available for space and how we manage that. But he’s done a good job; he’s played well.”</p></div>
