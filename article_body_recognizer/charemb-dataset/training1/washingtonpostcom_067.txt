<div><div><p>In a searing speech — and his most direct challenge to Trump — Biden vowed to defend American democracy and said Jan. 6 represents not its end but rather a rebirth of “liberty and fair play.”</p></div></div>
<p>Here’s what to know:</p>

<li>Trump had planned to hold a news conference to mark the first anniversary of the Capitol attack but announced this week that he was canceling it.</li>
<li>Senior Biden administration officials have concluded that the government’s Jan. 6 preparations were hampered by a lack of high-level information-sharing and a failure to anticipate how bad the day could be.</li>

<div><div><p>The event was solemn and brief, lasting less than 10 minutes. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders stood in the front row; it was not immediately clear whether any Republicans attended.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By David J. Lynch</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 26, 2021 at 4:23 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>A deepening freight logjam is defying President Biden’s hopes of restoring normal cargo movements, hampering the economic recovery and threatening consumers’ holiday shopping plans.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At APM Terminals’ Pier 400 in Long Beach, Calif., the largest such privately owned facility in North America, nearly half of the 2,000 available appointments for truckers went unused Friday, according to Maersk, which owns the site.</p></div>
<div><div><p>John Porcari, the administration’s port envoy, who helped develop the initiative, said it would reduce port congestion. But some retailers fear they will get stuck with the tab.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside America’s broken supply chain</p></div>
<div><div><p>More than 30 million tons of cargo now rests aboard vessels idling outside U.S. ports, economists at Goldman Sachs said Tuesday. The investment bank said port congestion will not ease until the second half of next year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The gridlock is contributing to inflation that is lasting longer than the Federal Reserve expected while denting corporate profits, despite accelerating economic growth.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Consumer and industrial companies alike have cited supply chain headaches in recent earnings calls.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The White House is keenly aware that fallout from supply woes that Biden calls “significant” has become a political liability — and officials are struggling to identify solutions for largely private-sector problems.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a recent CNN town hall, the president said he “absolutely, positively” would consider using National Guard units to alleviate cargo backlogs, a move that few logistics experts expect to happen.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Porcari last month facilitated a decision by the neighboring Southern California ports to extend their hours, with some terminals operating around-the-clock at least a few days each week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the initial results have been disappointing. The 77 container ships anchored in Southern California’s San Pedro Bay on Tuesday exceed the 56 that were there when Biden announced the longer hours.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Biden keeps many Trump tariffs in place, disappointing importers</span></p></div>
<div><p>Truckers have been reluctant to take advantage of the late-night and predawn appointments for collecting containers, either because they lack the necessary chassis to hold the cargo or their customers’ warehouses are full.</p></div>
<p>The new surcharges, which the L.A. and Long Beach ports announced late Monday, were developed with Porcari, the administration’s ports specialist. The fees will be spent on investments to boost capacity and ease bottlenecks, the ports said.</p>
<div><div><p>Until those chassis can be unloaded and returned to the port to collect fresh loads, the backlog will linger, he said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Amid huge shortage, new truck drivers train for some of supply chain’s toughest jobs</h1></div>
<h2>Trucking industry moves 70 percent of nation’s freight but struggles to retain workers</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By David J. Lynch</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 16, 2021|Updated December 16, 2021 at 10:31 a.m. EST</div></div>
<b> </b>the other half of the instructor team here at SAGE Truck Driving School, yells encouragement.
<div><div><p>Turning such untrained talent into drivers who can safely command a 40-ton load at highway speeds takes four to six weeks of classroom instruction, observation, and practice behind the wheel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What it really boils down to is: Tell them, tell them and keep telling them,” Hanlon said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Inside America's Broken Supply Chain</p></div>
<div><div><p>In February, the federal government for the first time will begin requiring that all new commercial driver license (CDL) applicants be trained in a registered facility using a standard curriculum.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is going to further negatively impact an already crippled supply chain,” said Kelly Krapu, director of safety for TrueNorth Compliance Services in West Fargo, N.D.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Department of Transportation disputes that view and promises that regulators will work with industry representatives to ensure a smooth process.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The government edict comes as driving schools scramble to make up for pandemic closures. SAGE last year fell about 20 percent short of its typical output of 4,000 new drivers, said Chris Thropp, the company’s president.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“We’re very busy right now at the vast majority of our schools,” said Thropp, 61, a former corporate attorney who joined SAGE nearly a quarter century ago. “We’ve definitely seen an uptick in interest.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no one reason for the driver shortage, which means there is no one solution,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If that time was cut in half, all of those drivers would be that [much] more productive and you might not need more trucks on the road,” said Todd Spencer, the association’s president.</p></div></div>
<p>The $1 trillion infrastructure legislation <a>President Biden</a> signed last month includes a pilot apprenticeship program for drivers between the ages of 18 and 21, promotes the hiring of female truckers, and authorizes a compensation study.</p>
<div><div><p>Despite the long-term plateau in wages, trucking enjoys a reputation as a good-paying blue-collar occupation. Billboards along the nearby Lehigh Valley Thruway advertise truck driving jobs for $31 per hour, plus signing bonus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Through the first half of this year, states issued a monthly average of roughly 50,000 new licenses, 14 percent higher than the pre-pandemic rate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He’s heard that one trucking company is paying drivers up to $2,200 per week. Four of his friends have already landed jobs with FedEx. Eventually, he plans to run his own freight business.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Trucking is where it’s at. That’s what everybody tells me,” Nivar said. “The ball’s in my court, the way I see it.”</p></div></div>
<a>trucking companies</a> instead accept high turnover and the headache of near-constant recruitment, said Burks, who drove a tractor-trailer for a decade before becoming an economist.
<div><div><p>Some would-be drivers insist they are unfazed. Cameron Thomas, 26, and his wife, Reina, 24, started<b> </b>their training five days after getting married. They are eager to start a life together in the cab of a tractor-trailer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We already love spending time together,” Reina said. “And it would be good for money with both of us doing it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Federal safety regulations limit truck drivers to 11 hours per day behind the wheel. The Thomases figure they can keep their truck moving almost constantly if one of them sleeps while the other drives.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From ports to rail yards, global supply chains struggle amid virus outbreaks in the developing world</p></div>
<div><div><p>SAGE emphasizes one-on-one training. Hanlon, who said his father taught him to drive a truck using “the yell-and-scream method,” takes a calmer approach.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Riding shotgun as Mason Mott, 18, steers a tractor trailer around the campus of Lehigh Career and Technical Institute, Hanlon mixes gentle correctives with praise.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mott was inconsistent in his earlier parking attempts and concedes he has a tendency to fumble the clutch on the 10-speed manual transmission. But Hanlon is reassuring.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s all right. You got to make mistakes to learn,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wearing a baseball cap and hoodie, Mott successfully pilots the truck on several laps of the college, as Hanlon alternates between mild rebukes (“both hands on the wheel unless shifting”) and encouragement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Finally, after Mott executes a tight left turn back into the lot, Hanlon applauds. “Beautiful! Very good. Good job. Perfect,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, inside a beige single-story building nearby, Sugeidy Sanchez, 24, is receiving her new-student briefing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A small Christmas tree, decorated with tiny white lights, sits on Borowski’s desk as he delivers a safety lecture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Think of these orange [traffic] cones out there as your brother, sister or children. If you run over one, you’ve killed someone,” Borowski said. “Try not to kill the cones.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sanchez nods. Eight members of her family are truck drivers, so she understands what the job entails. An uncle, who quit long-haul driving after just six months, tried to talk her out of it, saying the grind would exhaust her.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Sanchez, the mother of a daughter, 6, and a five-month old son, wants to make as much money as she can, as quickly as she can. Then, she will buy her own truck and stay closer to home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m looking for something to bring more money into my family,” she said. “I feel this is it.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Peggy McGlone</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>A few months after taking the reins of one of the smaller Smithsonian museums in July, Ngaire Blankenberg removed 18 Benin Kingdom Court Style works from their cases, saying their presence was harmful.</p></div></div>
<p>“We need to develop trust and transparency among our core constituents in order to build a 21st-century African art museum,” she said. “A huge impediment to that conversation is to have stuff you shouldn’t have.”</p>
<div><p>A new Smithsonian initiative aims to help America deal with the history and legacy of racism</p></div>
<div><p>The panel is examining past collecting standards through a moral rather than legal lens. The new guidelines will require Smithsonian museums to dig into the circumstances behind their acquisitions and make an effort to address any wrongs.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The review will bring the entire institution in line with the practices he put in place at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which <b/>opened in 2016 with Bunch as its founding director.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is a moment to say, ‘We can be better,’ ” Bunch said. “By accepting our troubled past, we can point to a better future.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>works stolen by Nazis from Jewish families; in the early 2000s, Italian officials used the courts to force the return of antiquities.

<b> </b>and protests around the country that led to
<div><div><p>The display was meant to celebrate the royal court’s rich artistic tradition of metalworks, including bronze plaques and sculptures, and ivory carvings that date to the 1300s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That historical context was not enough for Blankenberg.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My strategy is to create a space of recognition for global Africans — a place where we feel belonging, kinship and inspired by art as defined by us,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian’s first Black leader, on the challenge of making it ‘a place that matters’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Buyers also worked regularly with dealers and often relied on their reputations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Buyers didn’t ask that many questions before agreeing to a sale,” said Victoria Reed, curator for provenance at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. “Today, we see there is a tremendous risk to that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is giving voice to individuals, communities and institutions that have not always had a voice,” Kreamer said. “Engagement with communities will be part of curatorial practice going forward.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Blankenberg, the question of legal ownership is not the central concern.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The important thing is not so much this option or that option but who gets to decide,” she said. “Is there an equitable conversation between source communities and museums to decide what happens to the objects?”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Because of Smithsonian-wide staff shortages related to the region’s coronavirus surge, the National Museum of African Art is open only on Saturdays and Sundays until Jan. 19.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Smithsonian is on a massive search for six new museum directors. Their work could reshape the institution for generations.</p></div>

<h1>Red, right to the liberated heart</h1>
<h2>Martin Puryear’s sculpture at Glenstone is an invitation to reflect on freedom and coercion</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By <div><div>Sebastian Smee</div></div></div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Dec. 22, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>It was an amazing show, but none of the other pieces crystallized in my memory quite like this. So I was happy when it turned up in the collection of Glenstone Museum.</p>
<p>Was it the color that made this piece so memorable?</p>
<p>Other works in Puryear’s 2014 show suggested shackles used on slave ships. In both cases the sculptures were abstracted and simplified. Some were hollow, others solid, and the materials (Puryear is a master craftsman) kept changing.</p>
<p>No such ambiguity exists here. The form is clearly a liberty cap. But the color red, and its association with revolutionary extremism, might remind us that extremes of freedom are never far from extremes of domination.</p>
<p>Whether it’s guns or vaccines, wealth redistribution or education, it seems we can never get the balance between liberty and coercion right. When it banned slavery in February 1794, France was still in the grip of the Terror.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Washington Post Staff</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>April 13, 2020</div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is our goal for the conversations on The Post?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Share your personal experiences and how they’ve shaped your opinion.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Our community includes readers from across the United States and abroad. We have the comments because we want to hear your unique perspective on an article or column we published. What’s your opinion and why?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Join in discussions and build on top of ideas.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s easy for conversations online to turn into a sounding board where readers simply post their stance on an issue, but the best discussions come from responding to what others have already shared.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Send questions you have about our reporting or writing at The Post.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>See a problem? Suggest a correction.</b></p></div></div>
<a>submit a correction request here</a>.
<div><div><h3><div>What type of posts should I avoid?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Partisan stereotypes or generalizations.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The best comments avoid generalizing groups of people. Comments stating “all conservatives” or “all liberals” do little to provide thoughtful conversations about the issues at hand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Vulgar language, name-calling or personal attacks.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Comments posted must be appropriate for all ages. Any profanity or cursing is prohibited. That includes any attempts to curse with special characters (!@#) or spacing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Discuss and criticize ideas. We don’t allow comments that intend to intimidate, demean or harass other readers in any way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>“Troll,” “snowflake” and other dismissive behavior.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Speculation, misinformation, impersonation.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Conversations around the news often focus on what will happen next. That being said, we caution readers from jumping to conclusions or making grand accusations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We don’t allow posts that include falsehoods or purposely spread inaccurate information. Likewise, don’t post any comments that misrepresent your affiliation or identity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Off-topic, the caps lock, low-effort commentary.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We’ll also take efforts to remove low-effort commentary. Three or four words in a post provides little insight, argument or opportunity for discussion.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Posts inciting or encouraging violence.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We’ll remove comments that contain or advocate for illegal or violent acts in any way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We also don’t allow posts that infringe upon or violate the copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights of any person.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Duplicate comments or advertising.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Conversations on The Post are for issue-based discussions. Promoting, selling or advertising with a comment will result in a suspension or ban. Some exceptions are made for fundraising sites that relate to the specific article.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How do I join the conversations on The Post?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Before you can start posting, you need to create an account with The Post, verify your email address and create a display name, which will appear with any comment you write. <a>Here’s a guide on how to create an account</a>.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If I write a post, what name will appear?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Can I edit or delete a post I wrote?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Once you send a post, you have five minutes to edit or delete what you wrote. After that, the post will only be removed if it goes against the rules in place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, with the solution above, we’re prioritizing the need to clarify or eliminate typos while also ensuring readers retain ownership for what they submitted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>I read a comment that violated the rules listed here. What should I do?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Our team moderates discussions 24/7, but we rely on the community to help police discussions. If you see a post against the rules, use the flag button to report it. Reports go directly to our team, so be judicious.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Alternatively, readers can block posts from other commenters by muting them. To do this, click their display name and select “Ignore.” You can unmute a reader by going to your profile.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>I posted a comment and got a notification that it is under review. Why?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Some articles may have pre-moderated discussions in order to ensure readers abide by the rules in place. If this is the case, readers will get a notification when they send a comment and the post will appear if it follows the rules above.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>I posted a comment and it was removed. Why?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>When does The Post turn off comments on an article?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>We will close the comments section before an article has published or shortly after if we believe the discussion will probably go against the rules set above.</p></div></div>
<div><p>We will also lock an ongoing discussion on an article if comments submitted continue to go against the community rules. In these cases, readers can typically see what has been submitted but will no longer be able to submit new posts.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In the majority of other cases, the discussion on an article closes 3 days after it was originally published.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What does it mean if I am suspended or banned?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Suspensions and bans only preclude readers from posting in discussions on The Post. If you are suspended or banned, you will still be able to read all of The Post’s reporting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Due to the volume of messages we receive, we cannot respond to requests to appeal bans or explain suspensions. If you are banned, do not attempt to create a new account after being banned. We will also ban the new account.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is a featured comment?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Is there a way to see my past comments on The Post?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>On every comments section, there’s a “My Profile” tab with a collection of past comments you’ve made. From there, you can see how many replies and likes your comments got from other readers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Is there a way to see the best conversations happening on The Post?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Great question. Every week, we collect some of the most interesting and topical comments on The Post and send a newsletter called Read These Comments, which you can <a>subscribe to here.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>I still have more questions. Where can I send them?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Thank you in advance for taking the time to read the rules in place.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s a reason we took the time to write up this overview. A better understanding of the rules allows us to have thoughtful, open conversations about journalism from The Post, and that’s the goal.</p></div></div>
