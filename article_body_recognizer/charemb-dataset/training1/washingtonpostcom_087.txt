<div><div><p>“You can’t really go wrong if you only surround yourself with quality, which is a philosophy I’ve always subscribed to,” Finn, 49, says later over lunch at a nearby Chinese restaurant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He adds, grinning: “It makes me look better.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The uptick also involves more frequent use of the 1,164-seat Eisenhower Theater for touring musicals, and longer runs for some of them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>First glimpse of Kennedy Center’s much delayed expansion unveiled</p></div>
<div><div><p>“You could never in a million years have had all five of those superstars on the stage,” Rutter says. “He was able to pull that off. Before Jeffrey, we couldn’t have done that.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Kennedy Center Honors felt different, and it was all because of ‘Hamilton’</p></div>
<p>“Footloose” is not particularly fondly remembered; based on the 1984 teen-oriented movie about a town that bans dancing, it opened on Broadway in 1998 and ran for 709 performances, benefiting at the time from the popularity of the title.</p>
<p>But Finn trusts his gut, and this show felt right for the Eisenhower. “What I produce is what I like to see,” he says. “The barometer for me is, would I want to sit through that show? Would I buy a ticket for that show?”</p>
<div><div><p>Ticket sales have been brisk for the Broadway material Finn has been championing. The gut, in other words, has been pretty good.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Theater is coming back to the Kennedy Center — with a vengeance. With masks on and fingers crossed, the performing arts center will begin on Oct. 13 to roll out musicals and plays at a pace breathtaking even in far healthier times.</p></div>
<div><div><p>If the robust roster sounds as if someone at the Kennedy Center is dreaming, well, many a starved (and covid 19-immunized) theatergoer is liable to think: dream away.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is looking into the future and believing that more and more of the country is vaccinated so that herd immunity is developed,” said Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“But we’re not going to do anything that isn’t safe. . . . And we’ll see how people respond.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Asked whether he and Rutter will be on pins and needles as the phone lines and website open up today, Jeffrey Finn, the arts center’s vice president and executive producer of theater, had a one-word reply: “Yes.”</p></div>
<div><p>How Jeffrey Finn tries to sniff out Broadway-worthy winners</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It became apparent that Jeffrey was going to be able to do much more than you might normally be able to,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The popular Broadway Center Stage series, which produces three weekend-long concert-style revivals each season of musicals of various vintages, will also continue, Finn said, with dates and titles still in the works.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“The goal was absolutely to be able to have an exciting season for people to return to,” Finn said. “For me, it’s pure exhilaration. I can’t wait.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Peter Marks</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 10, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The way Briga Heelan fell into the role of a Cinderella singing Britney Spears’s music has all the earmarks of a fairy tale with a 21st-century twist.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It felt like it came from the sky and just smacked me across the face,” Heelan said. “I just opened an email one day and it was like, ‘Is this a real project? WHAT?’ ”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Brittany Spears’s conservatorship is terminated after 13 years</p></div>
<div><div><p>“The only thing I was told was that she loves fairies,” Hartmere said of Spears. “And I was like, ‘That’s it, that’s what we’ve got to go on.’</p></div></div>
<p>“I knew the songs that everybody else knew,” Hartmere added. “I didn’t know the deep cuts. She literally has a song [called] ‘Cinderella.’ I was like, ‘All right, I have to do this.’ ”</p>
<div><p>The dilemma for Shakespeare theaters: Increasing sales without selling their souls</p></div>
<p>The demand, too, to find material with broader appeal has compelled the company to widen its theatrical gaze. Built in 2007, the Shakespeare’s $89 million Sidney Harman Hall has been consistently difficult to sell out with classical offerings.</p>
<div><div><p>“That hall seats 750 people, and we’ve always been striving about how to justify having it as a space,” Godwin explained.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The key to this,” Leveaux said, “is that it was not going to be, as it were, some sort of pop songs popping up out of a landscape that shouldn’t be containing them.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It turns out that we are able to marry these songs that we cherish to a new set of ideas and concepts. And they take on a whole new life.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>“I watched it every day after school,” Olivera said of the video version of “Into the Woods,” first broadcast in 1991. “Mostly just Act One,” she added, “because Act Two scared my brother.”</p></div>
<div><p>There will never be another Sondheim</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s just a gift being here today,” said Christopher Michael Richardson, who sang “Good Thing Going” from “Merrily We Roll Along.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“To be here with so much of my D.C. family, giving honor to someone who has brought me together with many of these people. You know, many of these people I wouldn’t have met if I was not doing Sondheim.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>‘The Lehman Trilogy’ has been a critical standout on Broadway this fall. Its superb cast sheds light on how that happened.</h1></div>
<h2>Simon Russell Beale, Adrian Lester and Adam Godley talk about the rigors and pleasures of more than three hours onstage every night</h2>

<i>(This conversation has been condensed for clarity and length.)</i>
<div><div><p><i><b>Q: </b></i><i>Simon, did you know the story of Lehman Brothers before you signed on?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Q: </b></i><i>But the gist of the show is not about being an economics major, understanding the financial system.</i></p></div></div>
<div><p>With the opening of 'The Lehman Trilogy,' Broadway just got a lot smarter</p></div>
<i>Adrian, you joined the company for Broadway. [Beale and Godley were in previous versions at the </i>
<a><i>Park Avenue Armory</i></a>
<i> and in London’s West End.] It’s your Broadway debut. What was it that made you want to do this?</i>
<div><div><p><i><b>Q: </b></i><i>Adrian, I’ve seen you do </i><a><i>“Othello”</i></a><i>; I assume you’ve done “Othello” twice in a day. So come on!</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Lester</b>: I got to leave the stage!</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Beale</b>: That’s a good point! We are locked in!</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Q: </b></i><i>I think we should explain. You’re in an essentially revolving glass cube that is modern, set in the offices, presumably, of a fading Lehman Brothers.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Godley</b>: The conceit is that everything we use, any practical prop that we have, is something that would be in that room in 2008.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Q: </b></i><i>I was struck by the morality play aspect of the story. It starts as a company that [brokers the sale of] cotton, which we all know has a deeply troubled history in this country.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Godley</b>: But it’s often presented without judgment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Q: </b></i><i>But do you have to love the character you’re playing when you’re doing it every night?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Beale</b>: I mean, I’m very shortsighted, so …</p></div></div>
<div><p><b>Lester</b>: I have a habit doing Shakespeare, where if I have to address the audience, I find a face. I find faces. It’s just the thing in me that I want to talk to someone. And other actors have told me that I’m just mad.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Godley</b>: You can hear the quality of listening. You can really tell when people are engaged as a quality of attention and silence, even though there are 1,000 people sitting there. You hear it and you can really feel it.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Every new year, diet messages seem to rain down along with the confetti right after the ball drops.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From the blitz of ads to the guilt-laden chatter among friends, you can’t escape them. While most diets have been rebranded as “lifestyle” plans, scratch their veneer and you get the same strict rules and body shaming.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The problem is, that shift is often framed as repentance, with punishing food rules that are big on promises but are ultimately unsustainable, even damaging.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Instead, consider a different approach: Make targeted, smaller-but-pivotal changes to put yourself on a lifelong path to well-being.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>Women allege racism, sexism at food media company Feedfeed</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Tim Carman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022|Updated January 4, 2022 at 4:58 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>Homemade vs. the Internet</a>.”
<div><div><p>Gurjar, then 30, was hired at an annual salary of $50,400. Tane, then 24, received $72,000.</p></div></div>
<a>Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list</a>.) Cohen, like the Resnicks, is named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
<div><div><p>Gurjar and Henry-Bohoskey said they had hoped Cohen, despite his youth, would become a mentor. But, according to the lawsuit, Cohen “became an immediate and active participant in the abuse,” an allegation he denies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cohen, the plaintiffs allege in their suit, at one point discouraged Gurjar from having a child, implying work comes first. (Cohen denied he said this; he said he was talking about how he didn’t want to have children.)</p></div></div>
<b> </b>alleged in interviews. But when they complained they were overwhelmed, they would find little relief. Worse, they said, Cohen or the Resnicks would accuse them of not being team players or “tone police” their attitudes.
<div><div><p>Cohen, the women allege in the suit, would also brush off their complaints about Giora Stuchiner, Feedfeed’s art and experiential director until 2020, an allegation Cohen denies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Several current Feedfeed employees told The Post that Stuchiner never used the word “gangbang” or directed it at the account manager.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>already had a strained relationship with Stuchiner because he had described Bushwick, where Feedfeed has an office and where Henry-Bohoskey used to live, as “sketchy” in the comments to an
<a>Instagram video</a>. At the time, Henry-Bohoskey alleged, she told Stuchiner the remark came off as racist given the many families of color in the area.
<p>“I felt like I was on the spot and I couldn’t <i>not</i> answer him,” Henry-Bohoskey said. She said she gave him a brief history on newly freed Blacks, their relationship with watermelon and how Whites stigmatized the fruit.</p>
<div><div><p>“I regret it to this day,” Henry-Bohoskey said about answering the question.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They have never relinquished their control over the mundane,” said Molly Adams, former digital food director, who quit in September.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Berger said the company disagreed with the overtime claims, but “to the extent there was any inadvertent underpayment during their employment, we wanted to make sure they were compensated.”</p></div></div>
<p>Former employees said in interviews that the Resnicks’ leadership could be mercurial, that editorial procedures and duties could change without warning, leaving employees feeling as if the ground was constantly shifting under their feet.</p>
<div><div><p>“A lot of times [Julie’s] ask would be like, ‘Can you just pull something out of thin air with all the free time that you have?,’” said Tane, who was laid off early in the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<p>But shifting on the fly is the nature of the digital media industry, Berger said. “Feedfeed employees have always been encouraged to speak with their supervisors and/or the Resnicks if they have concerns about their workload,” he added.</p>
<div><div><p>In testimonials provided by the company, some current employees praise the founders.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>“The Resnicks hire people they believe in and who have the creativity and knowledge to move the company forward.”
<div><div><p>“We understand if you want to move on and find a new job as an art director at a different organization,” Julie wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Having the minimum experience on paper doesn’t make one qualified for a job,” Berger responded.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gurjar and Henry-Bohoskey allege in their complaint that discrimination played a role in their slow advancement, while they watched White employees rise faster and higher. But Berger disputed that.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>told The Post. But driven by the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020
<b> </b>following George Floyd’s murder, she began reading more about systemic racism, decolonization and social justice. She started standing up for herself and for racial diversity at Feedfeed.
<div><div><p>“The world wants food media companies to rightfully hire more diverse staff. We have that diversity,” Dan wrote. “So why would we not be leveraging it.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>“crazy rich Asians” comment and Stuchiner’s heated exchange with the account manager, among other incidents. It was co-signed by Henry-Bohoskey, Tane and Dolfi.
<b> </b>from the Resnicks on her shoots than another photographer on staff.
<div><div><p>“It would just be so ridiculous, like asking her to source things in a pandemic that are like, ‘Do you have edible flowers? Can you find gold dust?’ Just crazy stuff,” Dolfi told The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was crying all the time. I was not able to eat. I was not functioning very well,” Gurjar said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Dec. 23, she quit. Two months later, she started as an associate food editor at Bon Appétit, which<a> had gone through a racial reckoning in 2020</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About a month later, on Jan. 29, as Henry-Bohoskey was training the person she thought was her replacement, she also resigned, even though<b> </b>she was pregnant and would sacrifice state-mandated maternity leave.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was worth it,” she said. “I was just so miserable.”</p></div></div>
