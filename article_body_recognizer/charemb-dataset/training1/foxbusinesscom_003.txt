<h1>Meta appealing UK ruling ordering it to sell Giphy</h1>
<h2>Facebook owner says British watchdog's 'decision to block the deal is wrong on the law and the facts'</h2>
<div><div><div> close</div> <div><div> video</div></div> <div><div><h2>Market expert on Meta stock</h2> <p>Evercore ISI senior managing director Mark Mahaney on Meta, formerly known as Facebook, and his outlook for shares.</p></div></div></div></div>
<p><a>Facebook</a> owner Meta Platforms, Inc. says it is appealing a United Kingdom watchdog's ruling ordering the social media giant to sell New York-based animated picture platform Giphy over antitrust concerns.</p>
<p>Last month, Britain's Competition and Markets Authority ordered Meta to unwind its reportedly $400 million acquisition of <a>Giphy</a>, which was completed in May of 2020 while Meta was still named Facebook.</p>

<p>Meta is now pushing back against the order.</p>
<p>"We are appealing the CMA’s GIPHY decision and will seek a stay of the CMA’s order to divest," the social media giant said in a statement on Thursday. </p>
<p>META WARNS 50,000 FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM USERS MAY HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY PRIVATE ‘SURVEILLANCE-FOR-HIRE’ FIRMS</p>
<p>A person familiar with the deal told FOX Business that Giphy approached Facebook (and other potential buyers) about being acquired, not the other way around.</p>

<p>"This foreign action to block acquisition activity of two U.S.-based companies is unprecedented, and startling," Small Business Entrepreneurship Council president and CEO Karen Kerrigan said in a statement following CMA's ruling.</p>

<h1>Crypto donations hit records: Season of Generosity</h1>
<h2>The top cryptocurrency donated on Crypto Giving Tuesday 2021 was ethereum</h2>
<div><div><h2>NFT Charity auction 'Right-Click, Give!' kicks off </h2> <p>Blankets of Hope co-founder Mike Fiorito and Blockchain attorney Philip Berg discusses the NFT Charity auction, Right-Click, Give and the hidden fees for investors.</p></div></div>
<p>Donating <a>cryptocurrencies</a> to charitable organizations is on the rise in this holiday <a>season of generosity</a>, according to numbers from crypto donation platform The Giving Block.</p>
<p>The platform, founded in 2018, fields donations from <a>crypto</a> investors to their choice of more than 1,000 nonprofits, such as Operation Smile, Catholic Charities U.S.A. and People for the Ethical Treatment Animals. </p>

<p>BITCOIN PRICE MOVES ABOVE $50,000 IN HOLIDAY WEEK</p>
<p>The Giving Block's biggest fundraising event of the year, <a>Crypto Giving Tuesday</a> held on Nov. 30, absolutely shattered last year's event by raising $2.4 million in the 24-hour period — that's up 538% from the one-day event last year.</p>
<p>The Number One crypto donated via the site was ethereum at more than $1.2 million, followed by bitcoin at over $885,000. Donors gave roughly $294,000-worth of USD Coin, nearly $9,000 in uniswap and another $5,000 in tezos.</p>

<p>Like other charitable donations, giving via digital assets comes with its own tax benefits. The Giving Block asks donors, "Why give your crypto to the IRS when you can give it to a charity instead?" </p>

<p>Donors can give crypto to a non-profit rather than the government through The Giving Block, share the tax receipt with their accountant and get it appraised. Then, donors are able to secure their tax write-off and capital gains exemption.</p>
<p>As for reaching the $100 million mark in donations this year, Duffy says it's going to be tight, but there are still a few days left of the campaign, which ends at midnight on Friday.</p>
<p>"So much of it depends on the donations that come in this week," he noted. "Let's hope the whales come out in full force this week!"</p>

<p>Telus told FOX Business in a statement that the company "is proud of the valuable work our teams perform to support a positive online environment."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Williams asks that TikTok "restore [Frazier] immediately to her prior responsibilities." He also told us, "As the case is a proposed class action, we do anticipate representing additional content moderators."</p>

<h1>Kirk Douglas’s long-time Beverly Hills home, complete with Hollywood Walk of Fame, listed for $7.49M</h1>
<h2>Placed in a trust in 1990, the Douglases bought the property in 1976 for $400,000</h2>
<a>Beverly Hills</a> home of Hollywood legends Kirk and Anne Douglas and its garden pathway of pavers signed by Tinseltown’s
<a>biggest stars</a> has hit the market for $7.495 million. The 1920s property, which is in The Flats neighborhood that’s hidden from the street by tall hedges, is close to Rodeo Drive and the Beverly Hills Hotel.
<p>It was listed on Dec. 6 by Rochelle Altas Maize of Nourmand Associates.</p>
<p>Placed in a trust in 1990, the Douglases bought the property in 1976 for $400,000, according to its listing on Redfin.</p>
<p>Ms. Maize said the couple lived in the house until their deaths: He died in 2020 at 103, and she passed away this year at 102.</p>
<p>Set on a little more than a third of an acre that features mature trees and gardens, the estate includes a single-story 4,648-square-foot main house and a two-story guest house.</p>

<p>The main house, which has four bedrooms and six bathrooms, is relatively modest for a celebrity couple of such stature, Ms. Maize said.</p>

<p>"They entertained a lot, and I was told that Kirk would have people autograph cement pavers at dinner parties," she said. "There are 22 stones—some were from their previous property."</p>
<p>When she toured the property, she spent over an hour stepping through the stars, photographing and writing down the autographed names.</p>
<p>"It’s like Grauman’s Chinese Theatre’s Hollywood Walk of Fame on steroids," she said, adding that it’s "iconic and special."</p>

<h1>Eminem's home invader allegedly said he was there to kill the rapper, officer testifies</h1>
<h2>The alleged intruder's attorney said that his client denies ever saying that</h2>

<p><a>Eminem</a>'s alleged home invader shared an ominous message with the rapper after his entry to the property, according to police.</p>
<p>In early April, Eminem, born <a>Marshall Mathers</a>, awakened to <a>find a man standing behind him</a>, Clinton Township police officer, Adam Hackstock, said in a testimony on Wednesday, according to the <a>Detroit Free Press</a>.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old musician originally believed the alleged intruder to be his nephew, but he was later identified to be Matthew David Hughes, Hackstock said.</p>
<p><a>EMINEM CONFRONTED, DETAINED INTRUDER AT DETROIT-AREA HOME: REPORT</a></p>
<p>During the <a>preliminary examination</a>, Hackstock alleged that "when Mr. Mathers asked [the intruder] why he was there, he was told by Mr. Hughes that he was there to kill him."</p>
<p>Hughes' attorney, Richard Glanda, told Fox News that his client denies ever saying that.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure where [the officer's statement] came from," he said, also adding that "there was no physical contact between the two in the house."</p>

<p>Hughes was charged with first-degree home invasion and malicious destruction of property and has been in custody since the invasion, according to the Free Press. He also appeared in court on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mathers was not present, but his attorney watched the proceedings via video, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>An arraignment will take place on Sept. 28 after Judge Jacob Femminineo Jr. found probable cause to continue with a trial.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in Hackstock's testimony, he said that he arrived at the property to find a security guard wrestling with Hughes on the ground. He also said that Hughes reportedly muttered "friend" and said he lived nearby.</p>
<p>Hackstock also testified that Mathers led Hughes, who he states was unarmed, through his home to the exit during the incident.</p>

<p>Hughes is being held on a $50,000 cash bond, and the judge denied a request to lower the bail, stating that Mathers' fame was not a factor in his decision, according to the Free Press.</p>
<p>The prosecutor told the court that Hughes is apparently homeless, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Hughes' attorney, who was appointed by the court, reportedly sought a competency evaluation but was turned down by his client.</p>
<p>“In my opinion, I think there’s some sort of mental issues involved here,” Glanda said outside of the courtroom.</p>

<h1>Inflation not hurting homebuilder sentiment: NAHB CEO</h1>
<h2>Homebuilder sentiment held steady in December</h2>
<h2>Inflation not impacting appetite for new homes: NAHB CEO</h2>
<p>National Association of Home Builders CEO argues the pandemic has led to consumers changing their preferences for homes, opting for new homes that can be modified to include outdoor space and a gym.</p>
<p>National Association of Home Builders CEO Jerry Howard noted on Wednesday that rising <a>inflation</a> doesn’t seem to be hurting homebuilder sentiment, arguing that new houses can't be built fast enough amid strong demand. </p>
<p>Howard provided the insight on "<a>Varney Co.</a>" shortly after it was revealed that homebuilder sentiment held steady in December.</p>
<p>The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index this month rose one point to 84. The number ties the highest reading of the year that was posted in February.</p>
<p>The index can range between 0 and 100 with any print over 50 indicating positive sentiment. Any reading above 80 signals strong demand.</p>
<a>news release</a> that despite concerns over inflation and ongoing production bottlenecks, home builder confidence edged higher for the fourth straight month due to strong consumer demand and limited existing inventory.
<p>NAHB Chairman Chuck Fowke said, "Finding workers, predicting pricing, and dealing with material delays remains a challenge." </p>
<p>He urged policymakers "to work on supply chain improvements and controlling costly inflation." </p>
<p>NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz noted that "the most pressing issue for the housing sector remains lack of inventory." </p>
<p>He acknowledged that "building has increased, but the industry faces constraints, namely cost/availability of materials, labor and lots." </p>
<h2><a>New homes can't be built fast enough amid strong demand: NAHB CEO</a></h2>
<p>National Association of Home Builders CEO Jerry Howard says the pandemic has prompted more people to want to build new homes with more space, which is contributing to soaring demand.</p>
<p>Dietz also noted that while 2021 single-family starts should end the year 24% higher compared to pre-COVID levels, <a>higher interest rates in 2022</a> will likely put a damper on housing affordability.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Howard told host <a>Stuart Varney</a> that the <a>coronavirus</a> pandemic has prompted more people to want to build new homes with more space, which is contributing to the soaring demand.</p>
<a>Federal Reserve</a> on Wednesday
<a>announced plans</a> to accelerate the wind down of its aggressive bond-buying program, opening the door to interest rate liftoff in the first half of next year as policymakers seek to combat the hottest inflation in four decades.
<p><a><u>INFLATION WILL LIKELY GET WORSE BEFORE IT STARTS IMPROVING, GOLDMAN WARNS</u></a></p>
<p>The two-day policy setting meeting is the first since <a>Chairman Jerome Powell</a> conceded that inflation has been higher and longer-lasting than U.S. central bank officials initially anticipated. </p>
<p>Powell previously said policymakers wanted to conclude the bond-buying program before raising interest rates from near-zero, where they have sat since March 2020.</p>
<div><h2><a>NAHB CEO warns of never before seen 'unusual circumstances' for new homes</a></h2> <p>National Association of Home Builders CEO Jerry Howard describes how supply chain issues are affecting consumers who are building new homes. </p></div>
<p>Howard stressed the demand for new homes "is fueled, in a large part, by coming out of the pandemic and people want, for the first time in years, what existing homes can’t give them." </p>
<p>"They want more house," he continued. </p>

<p>A man who broke into <a>Eminem’s</a> suburban Detroit home and allegedly told the rapper "he was there to kill him" has been sentenced to five years probation and time served.</p>
<p>Matthew Hughes, 28, was sentenced last week by a Macomb County Circuit Court judge under a plea and sentencing deal with county prosecutors, the <a>Macomb Daily</a> reported. He was released after serving 524 days in the county jail.</p>
<p>Hughes said little at the hearing and made confusing statements in his presentencing report, said his attorney, Richard Glanda.</p>
<p>Eminem, who agreed with the outcome, did not attend the hearing.</p>

<p>In resurfaced video footage obtained by <a>The Daily Mail</a>, Hughes can be seen at the home seemingly ringing the doorbell before waiting outside. Mathers reportedly sold the home two years prior to Hughes' visit.</p>
<p>Per the outlet, after being asked to leave, Hughes was found in the property's gatehouse. He was arrested for breaking and entering and served 90 days in jail.</p>
<p>According to a <a><u>TMZ report</u></a> in May, citing police records, Hughes also reportedly went to another property in June.</p>

<h1>Instagram tightens teen protection measures ahead of Senate hearing</h1>
<h2>Instagram will pause creating version of platform for children</h2>
<p><a><u>Instagram</u></a> said on Tuesday it will be stricter about the types of content it recommends to teens in the photo-sharing app and will nudge them toward different areas if they dwell on one topic for a long time. </p>
<p>In a blog post, the social media service announced a slew of changes for teen users. Instagram head Adam Mosseri is due to testify in a Congressional hearing on Wednesday about protecting kids online. </p>
<p>Instagram and its parent company Meta Platforms Inc, formerly Facebook, have been under scrutiny over ways their services could cause issues around the mental health, body image and online safety of younger users. </p>

<p>The blog also said that on Tuesday, Instagram was launching its 'Take a Break' feature in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, which reminds people to take a brief pause from the app after using it for a certain amount of time. </p>
<p>It said in March next year Instagram would launch its first tools for parents and guardians to see how much time their teens spend on the app and set time limits. </p>
<p>An Instagram spokeswoman said it would continue its pause on plans for a <a><u>version of Instagram for kids</u></a>. Instagram suspended plans for the project in September, amid growing opposition to the project. </p>
<p>State attorneys general and lawmakers had also raised concerns about the kids-focused app. </p>

<p>FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange, recently left its imprint on the city with a $200 million sponsorship and naming rights deal for the Miami Heat’s NBA basketball arena. </p>
<p>Mitterlehner says Miamicoin is genius with the coin "creating more revenue for the city, without having to tax anyone for anything." </p>
<p>Seventy percent of the mining benefit from Miamicoin goes to the miner, as opposed to 100% in the case of bitcoin, with the remaining 30% going in a digital wallet for the city. </p>

<p>New York City is following Miami's lead with Mayor-elect Eric Adams announcing his city will soon have a CityCoin of its own. </p>
<p>Suarez said he sees his city’s growth as a generational opportunity with the center of gravity of the country shifting southeast to be what he calls the epicenter of capital. </p>
<p>"We are in the epicenter of five mega markets — South America, Silicon Valley, New York, the Middle East and Europe," Suarez said. "There's no one of those markets that's closer to the five than we are." </p>
<p>Suarez plans to give Miami residents the opportunity to have digital wallets so they can use or save bitcoin of their own. </p>
<p>Bitcoin has selected the city as the host of its 2022 conference in April.</p>

<h1>Jack Dorsey's Block Inc. hit with lawsuit for name change</h1>
<h2>Block Inc., formerly known as Square, said name change would distinguish its corporate entity from its businesses</h2>
<h2>Twitter's product development problem a challenge for Dorsey's replacement: Tech expert</h2>
<p>Evercore ISI Senior Managing Director Mark Mahaney discusses the future of Twitter following the departure of Jack Dorsey and censorship questions facing new CEO Parag Agrawal.</p>
<p><a>Jack Dorsey's</a> Block Inc., formerly known as Square, has been slapped with a <a>trademark infringement lawsuit</a> from HR Block following its recent name change announcement. </p>
<p><a>SQUARE CHANGES NAME TO BLOCK, DAYS AFTER CEO JACK DORSEY LEAVES TWITTER</a></p>
<p>The tax preparer argues the fintech startup's name change will "improperly capitalize on the goodwill and consumer trust" that has been cultivated since 1955. </p>

<p>HR Block emphasizes that Block Inc is a direct competitor in several areas of financial services, including through its <a>acquisition of Credit Karma Tax</a>, also known as Cash App Taxes, in November 2020.</p>
<p>"In the two weeks since the name change was announced, there already have been numerous indications that consumers are drawing a link between the companies due to Block, Inc.’s choice to co-opt the Block name," the company added. </p>
<p>"Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same," Dorsey added. "No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy."</p>
<p>Square, Cash App, TIDAL and TBD54566975 will continue to maintain their respective brand names, while Square Crypto will be renamed to Spiral.</p>
<p>A Block Inc. representative did not return FOX Business' request for comment on HR Block's lawsuit.</p>

<p>The former first lady launched a venture this week selling NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, on her website in exchange for a Solana token, currently valued around $180 each.</p>
<p>Aaron Dorfman, president and CEO of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, says when a company says "a portion of the proceeds" will go to charity without indicating specifically what amount, "It's a huge red flag."</p>
<p>"It means that charity is not a serious part of their plan," Dorfman said. "It's a marketing ploy."</p>
