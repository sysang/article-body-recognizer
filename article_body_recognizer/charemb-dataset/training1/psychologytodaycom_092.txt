<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Time Management</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Time management is the ability to plan and control how someone spends the hours in a day to effectively accomplish their <a>goals</a>.</p> </div> </div>
<h2> How to Streamline Your Time </h2>
<a>social life</a>, hobbies— it is important to establish clear
<a>goals</a> and priorities in order to set aside non-essential tasks that can eat up time and to monitor where the time actually goes.
<div> <h3> How can the workplace be structured to help manage tasks? </h3> </div>
<a>management</a> can be related to
<a>attention</a> problems, or difficulties with
<a>self-control</a>. To counter these behaviors, organizational psychologists promote the idea of setting up work environments that boost efficiency and
<a>productivity</a>. An optimal surrounding that emphasizes
<a>a conducive workspace</a> is key.
<div> <h3> What are effective time management skills? </h3> </div>
<a>Cutting</a> out sleep and trying to add hours into each day won't help, and neither will maintaining a lengthy and disorganized to-do List. However,
<a>streamlining life</a> and knowing one’s strengths and weaknesses are better starting points. For example, a procrastinator must face his tendency to delay and not hide from it.
<div> <h3> Does goal-setting make a difference in optimizing time? </h3> </div>

<h2> How to Integrate Work and Life </h2>
<div> <h3> What is a good balance between work and personal life? </h3> </div>
<a>being more deliberate about how one spends time</a> away from work can help make time, in general, more valuable. Of course, there are certain mandatory actions that must take place, the most important of which is the need for optimal self-care.
<div> <h3> How does a person maintain good boundaries between work and home life? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>It is critical to clearly communicate one's preferences: Keeping separate email accounts, one for work and one for home, is an example. Plus, <a>the desired boundary</a> must be shared with family and coworkers as well.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> How can a person better cope with task-related stressors? </h3> </div>
<a> Breaking down tasks and taking on one thing at a time</a> can help; focusing on just one assignment through to completion will help movement toward the next task.

<h2> What Is a Functional Family? </h2>
<div> <h3> Do stable households perpetuate positivity? </h3> </div>
<a>anger</a> felt by one person can reverberate throughout an entire household. In fact, negative

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Humor</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<a>laughter</a>, humor can be serious business. From its most lighthearted forms to its more absurd ones, humor can play an instrumental role in forming social bonds, releasing tension, or attracting a mate.
<div> <h3> What makes something funny? </h3> </div>
<a>theories of what makes things funny</a> focus on the role of tension-relief, suddenly “getting” how incongruous details fit together, and other factors.
<div> <h3> Why are some people funnier than others? </h3> </div>
<a>people who are funnier</a> than most may exhibit qualities such as a willingness to take risks when making jokes and a sensitivity to how their attempts at humor are perceived.
<a>More gifted comedians</a> might also be more intelligent, on average.
<div> <h3> What does a sense of humor reveal about you? </h3> </div>
<a>personality traits seem to correspond with the style of humor</a> people tend to use. Research suggests those who are drawn to humor as a way to affiliate with people or to support their own well-being are likely to rate higher on the traits of
<a>openness to experience</a>. More agreeable and
<a>conscientious</a> people also seem less likely to use humor in a disparaging or offensive way.
<div> <h3> Why do I laugh at inappropriate moments? </h3> </div>
<a>Laughing</a> during a funeral or at any other typically unfunny time isn’t necessarily a sign of disregard for others.
<a>Inappropriate laughter may be a response</a> to tension or other uncomfortable feelings stirred by awkward or sad situations, a hard-to-control release valve for the unpleasantness.
<div> <h3> What is gallows humor? </h3> </div>
<a>Gallows humor</a>, or black humor, involves subjects (such as death) that are threatening or highly negative in some other way. This kind of humor
<a>can feel good and provide relief</a> in the face of dark and disturbing circumstances, including for those who are regularly immersed in them, such as soldiers and hospital staff.
<div> <h3> Is humor related to mental illness? </h3> </div>
<a>relationship between humor and depression</a>, for example, with
<a>depressed</a> people being more likely to use self-deprecating humor and less likely to use positive styles of humor.

<div> <h3> How can I be funnier? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Some tips for <a>becoming a funnier person</a> include practicing joke-telling, taking comedic risks (knowing that some jokes will fail to get a laugh), and, of course watching, listening to, and reading the work of comedians.</p> </div>
<div> <h3> Do women prefer men with a sense of humor? </h3> </div>
<a>among the traits women have indicated they most desire</a> in a romantic partner, and they appear to prioritize it more, on average, than men do. Funniness may be attractive in part because it advertises a potential mate’s
<div> <h3> How do I know if I'm funny? </h3> </div>
<a>attention</a> to how people laugh (if they laugh) in response to jokes: Does the laughter seem involuntary or forced? There’s some evidence people can
<a>tell the difference between the kinds of laughter.</a>
<h2> The Benefits of Humor </h2>
<div> <h3> Does humor relieve stress? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the social benefits of humor? </h3> </div>
<a>from defusing tense situations to strengthening social bonds</a> between new or long-time friends (it’s sometimes called a “social lubricant”). A sense of humor may even serve as a kind of
<a>“social radar,”</a> helping one detect and connect with like-minded people.
<div> <h3> Is humor beneficial for romantic relationships? </h3> </div>
<a>make a relationship more satisfying</a>, and the use of
<a>positive humor could help in resolving conflict</a>. However, humor can be aggressive or insulting rather than positive and playful, and the repeated use of negative humor (
<a>like teasing</a>) might weaken a bond instead.
<div> <h3> Is laughter good for your health? </h3> </div>
<a>the evidence is largely inconclusive</a>.
<div> <h3> Can humor be harmful? </h3> </div>
<div> Win-win social interactions are highly prized but difficult to achieve. It’s easy to sympathize with characters who fall short of their objectives. </div>

<p>Deception refers to the act—big or small, cruel or kind—of encouraging people to believe information that is not true. Lying is a common form of deception—stating something known to be untrue with the intent to deceive. </p>
<h2> The Many Forms of Deception </h2>
<div> <h3> What kinds of lies do people tell? </h3> </div>
<a>Self-serving lies</a>, on the other hand, help liars get what they want, make them look better, or spare them blame or
<div> <h3> How do I lie to myself? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is gaslighting? </h3> </div>
<a>Gaslighting</a> is a pernicious form of manipulation in which someone is deliberately told false information with an intent to harm—specifically to undermine their sense of reality. Lies are used as weapons in an effort by one person to
<a>exert control over another</a>. The tactic is commonly deployed by abusers, narcissists, cult leaders, and dictators.
<div> <h3> How are delusions different from lies? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> How to Spot Deception </h2>
<a>inaccurate beliefs</a> about signals of lying—for example, that fidgeting is always a giveaway.
<div> <h3> How do I know when I’m being lied to? </h3> </div>
<a>body language</a> or facial expressions. But observable signs of lying can be unreliable. Researchers do find that
<a>some people lie more than others</a>. Studies show that children under two never lie and that lying peaks in
<a>adolescence</a>, when social relationships take on heightened importance.
<div> <h3> How do I know when I’m lying to myself? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is lack of eye contact always revealing? </h3> </div>
<a>the lie to that belief</a>. In fact, researchers have found that people make more eye contact when lying than when telling the truth.
<div> <h3> What are body language signals of lying? </h3> </div>
<a>nonverbals</a> should be seen as alerts to possibly concealed or suspicious information that requires further probing.
<div> <h3> Can speech give clues to deception? </h3> </div>
<a>ramble more</a>, present few verifiable facts, and seem less certain of the facts. In speech, overuse of
<a>little utterances </a>like um, ah, you know, right?, I mean can be clues to the cognitive load involved in lying.
<div> <h3> Are lie detector tests reliable? </h3> </div>
<a>the polygraph test</a>, is based on the theory that lying alters normal psychophysiological patterns that can be detected by sensitive machinery. Although popular in
<a>crime</a> dramas and movies, the test has long been controversial, with no evidence that there are definitive fluctuations in physiology. Evidence suggests that those with certain
<a>psychiatric</a> disorders, such as antisocial
<a>personality disorder</a>, cannot be accurately measured by polygraph or other common lie-detection methods.

<a>knowingly inflict harm</a> are widely regarded as immoral. But sometimes lying is done for good purposes. People may lie to protect others—so-called
<a>altruistic lies,</a> such as when a doctor tells a family that their father died a peaceful death when he in fact did not. Some lies are told to help people achieve their goals, such as when a spouse tells a

<a> a way of maintaining control</a> or to avoid disappointing others. Or their lies may be a form of wishful thinking.
<div> <h3> Has fake news always been a problem? </h3> </div>

<h1> Mindfully Listen: 3 Potent Ways to Connect and Influence </h1>
<h2> Listening to others is key to building strong bonds and influencing others. </h2>
<li>Listening carefully to one another is how we build strong bonds and earn each other's trust.</li>
<li>When we're listening, it's possible to feel more connected to others than when we're talking.</li>
<li>We don't have much influence on others until we connect to their experience and they feel heard.</li>
<p>What has helped me navigate this is noticing when my attention wanders as I would in my <a>mindfulness</a> practice and pivot back to listening–what I believe is the most important interpersonal skill. </p>
<a>fear</a> and rarely enters a child's heart. No wonder recidivism rates are so high in correctional prison systems. Anyway, I digress.
<a>mindfulness</a> and other practices, to notice when we’re operating from our habitual tendencies–like when you're prepping your rebuttal rather than listening.
<p>This <a>bad habit</a> has become all too common in our politically polarized country. The key is to approach conversations, especially if you know they'll be challenging, with presence and care.</p>
<p>Here are three simple yet powerful tips rooted in my 12 years of mindfulness training as well as being a doctor of relational <a>psychotherapy</a>.</p>
<p>As you work on this with important people to you, you can check in with your body and mind. How does it feel to be genuinely interested? What are you learning that you may not have known otherwise? Try to get a sense of that feeling. </p>
<p>Ironically, like my father, Daniel Linder, LMFT taught me, I often feel most connected to others when I'm listening more than talking. </p>
<p>As you may have gathered, showing care, warmth, vulnerability, and flexibility is essential to curiosity.</p>
<p>2. Letting the other(s) influence you. It helps to listen to the other in the way you'd like to be listened to. For most, this means letting your words affect, change, and influence the other.</p>
<p>3. Establish positive intention or "goodwill."</p>
<a>forgive</a> your misses, and vice versa.
<a>openness</a>, and care, when we’re willing and able to not only listen but actively show the other's influence on our decisions and establish goodwill, it opens sacred doors to deeper connection and understanding.
<p>What's more important than that? I would love to hear how it goes for you.</p>
