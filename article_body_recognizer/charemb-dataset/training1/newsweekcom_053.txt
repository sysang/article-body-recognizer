<div> News Indonesia <a>Planes</a> <a>Aircraft</a></div>
<p>Investigators determined the crashes were caused by a computer system that tipped the noses of the aircrafts down while in flight, an issue that pilots could not override. Boeing had completed technical upgrades on the planes to remedy the flaw.</p>
<p>The Transportation Ministry said in a statement that the lifting of the ban is effective immediately and came after a regulator evaluation of the aircraft system changes, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>"Several flight operators have stated that they have carried out airworthiness orders for 737 MAX aircraft, in accordance with FAA provisions and will prepare training and simulators at the nearest facility, in Singapore," Riyanto said.</p>
<p>The lifting of the ban was effective immediately and it follows the evaluation of changes to the aircraft's system by regulators, the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ethiopian Airlines said Monday that it will resume flights with the Boeing 737 Max aircraft in February, <a>BBC</a> <a>reported</a>.</p>
<a>European Union</a> regulators gave permission in January. Brazil and Canada also have given approval.
<p>Anton Sahadi, whose 24-year-old cousins Muhammad Rafi Ardian and Rian Ariandi died in the 2018 crash, said that he regrets the government decided to let the 737 Max fly again.</p>
<p>"The government has to ensure that the aircraft meets safety standards so that similar incidents don't happen again," Sahadi said.</p>
<p>"I do not see the urgency yet for Boeing's 737 Max aircrafts to fly again in Indonesia. Families of victims still have not finished the process of resolving problems with Boeing," he said.</p>
<p>Sahadi was referring to complaints by some families of crash victims that a $2.5 billion settlement between Boeing and the U.S.</p>
<p>Department of Justice excluded them from involvement in negotiating their compensation.</p>

<a>Weibo</a>, heavily armed police and additional officers in hazmat gear are seen escorting four men through the city of Jingxi in Guangxi, a region bordering Vietnam.
<p>Weibo users were critical of the display. Some said it called back to similar public humiliation events known as "struggle sessions," common during Mao Zedong's decade-long Cultural Revolution.</p>
<p>Zhengguan News said the event took place on Tuesday and involved four men who were caught smuggling foreign nationals across the border into China in violation of the country's COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether Huang and Bi, who were formally charged on December 20, were among those paraded through Anning on Tuesday. Posts on Weibo showed similar shaming events have taken place this month in the form of public court hearings.</p>

<p>While the number of Bosnians vaccinated against COVID-19 remains low, the same cannot be said for the country's prison population, which boasts a vaccination rate almost three times higher than the nation's rate as a whole.</p>
<p>Vaccine hesitancy has led to only about 27 percent of Bosnia's population of 3.3 million receiving the shot. But among the approximately 2,000 inmates across the country's 13 prisons, more than 80 percent are vaccinated.</p>
<p>"Many members of my family got infected, including my mother, so I think that masking up and getting vaccinated is the way to go," Fahro Kahriman, an inmate at Zenica, said.</p>
<p>In the early days of the pandemic, when most of the world faced shortages of personal protective equipment, Zenica prisoners were put to work sewing face masks as part of the prison's work program.</p>
<p>The prison produced over 10,000 masks, primarily for in-house use, but also for the Justice Ministry to distribute to other correctional facilities, Kahrić said. The program has continued along with the pandemic.</p>
<p>In the past, Zenica prison was notorious for its poor human rights record, but substantial reforms were made in the decade it has been under regular monitoring by relevant European and Bosnian human rights bodies and officials.</p>
<p>Sewing masks is "a way to spend quality time in prison and, at the same time, to contribute to the society," Kahriman said.</p>
<p>Bosnia, which has a population of 3.3 million, has reported nearly 290,000 virus cases and more than 13,300 COVID-19 deaths in the pandemic, some of the worst infection and mortality rates in Europe.</p>
