<a>Twin studies</a> suggest that about 50% of variations in loneliness are explained by
<a>genetics</a>. Personal attributes matter. For example,
<a>research</a> has found a link between the
<a>neuroticism</a> and loneliness. Age appears to be a factor.
<a>early studies</a> have noted the ‘internet paradox’ by which Internet use, ostensibly facilitating communication, nonetheless predicts lower communication levels with family and friends as well as increased loneliness.
<a>anxiety</a> may use the Internet as an avoidance strategy, thus eroding their social skills and social ties to negative effect.

<h1> Is Solitude Something You Enjoy or a Way of Avoiding Others? </h1>
<h2> Solitude that you want has nothing to do with loneliness. </h2>

<a>anxious</a> or uncomfortable when you are with others or regret something you said.
<a>loneliness</a>. In contrast, spending time alone because you enjoy it has nothing whatsoever to do with loneliness.
<p>Two Motivations for Solitude</p>
<p>The professors asked the participants about 14 possible reasons for spending time alone. Each question started with, “When I spend time alone, I do so because…” Participants indicated how important each of the reasons was to them.</p>
<p>The positive reasons for spending time alone were:</p>
<li>It sparks my creativity.</li>
<li>I feel energized when I spend time by myself.</li>
<li>It helps me stay in touch with my feelings.</li>
<li>It helps me gain insight into why I do the things I do.</li>
<li>Being alone helps me to get in touch with my <a>spirituality</a>.</li>
<li>I can engage in activities that really interest me.</li>
<p>The people-avoiding reasons for spending time alone were:</p>
<li>I feel anxious when I’m with others.</li>
<li>I feel uncomfortable when I’m with others.</li>
<li>I don’t feel liked when I’m with others.</li>
<li>I feel like I don’t belong when I’m with others.</li>
<li>I can’t be myself around others.</li>
<li>I regret things I say or do when I’m with others.</li>
<p>Why Your <a>Motivation</a> Matters</p>
<p>Special strengths of people who like their time alone</p>
<p>The college students who were especially likely to enjoy their time alone experienced more personal growth. The college students who were especially likely to spend time alone for negative reasons experienced less personal growth.</p>
<p>What the Results Do and Do Not Mean</p>
<a>sexual orientation</a> could elicit negative reactions from people who are not open-minded.
<p>We should not jump to conclusions about people who spend a lot of time alone. Many of them get a lot out of their solitude and are not experiencing the loneliness or depression that is currently the cause of so much concern.</p>

<h1> The Brain as a Prediction Machine: The Key to Consciousness? </h1>
<h2> Part 1: Expectations shape many key features of brain and behavior. </h2>
<li>Psychology has focused on how the past causes our present behavior. But the future can cause the present too, via prediction and simulation.</li>
<li>The brain constantly makes predictions. Consciousness enhances the brain's ability to form predictive models of the environment and the self.</li>
<li>Faulty top-down influence of expectation on perception shapes illusions, weird beliefs, anxiety, depression, psychosomatics, and more.</li>
<a>memory</a>) and present-oriented cognition (perception) and less on future-oriented/prospective cognition (expectation, anticipation).
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: vexworldwide | AdobeStock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Understanding the brain as a prediction machine may help explain consciousness.</p>
<a>brain evolved</a> as an adaptation enabling organisms to better perceive and control
<a>the environment</a> and their own internal state. Consciousness further enhances this ability by modeling the environment and the self.
<sup> 3</sup> it’s important to first understand
<p>More evolved brains, such as human ones, can integrate past sensory experiences to form representations of things that are not presently “out there”—predictive simulations.</p>
<p><a>Beliefs </a>are a form of predictive modeling.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>When you’re a brain inside a dark skull, guessing what’s presently out there is a form of prediction.</p>
<p>Anil Seth, a <a>neuroscientist</a> at the forefront of the serious science of consciousness,<sup>5</sup> explained and developed the concept of the brain as a prediction machine in his book Being You: A New Science of Consciousness.</p>
<p>As Seth explained in his popular TED talk:</p>
<p>According to this theory, what we perceive is strongly shaped by top-down expectations / predictions, not just by bottom-up sensory input.</p>
<p>How do the brain's thousands of representations/models produce a feeling of unitary consciousness?</p>
<a>Intelligence</a>. Each model operates as a reference frame, physically stored in a tiny cortical column.
<sup>9</sup> These complementary reference frames provide “what” and “where” information; acting all together, they provide information about how the different aspects of the object relate to each other.
<p>Understanding the central role of expectations in cognition is key to understanding many quirks of human functioning.</p>
<p>The fact that expectations fundamentally shape perceptions and beliefs explains many of the brain’s most successful features, as well as its many problematic bugs.</p>
<a>self-deception</a> as much as they are responsible for deceiving others.
<a>depression</a>, the most common mental disorders, are characterized by, and some would say partly caused by, faulty expectations of, or predictions about, the future—overestimation of threat or failure.
<p>Expectations (combined with and shaped by setting/context) also play a major role in the very different ways in which individuals experience psychedelics.<sup>14</sup></p>
<a>unconscious</a> biases in processing bodily sensations play an important role in functional neurological disorders (conversion disorders),
<sup>15</sup> and in other psychosomatic disorders. And expectations most certainly play a central role in the ubiquitous phenomenon of
<p>Finding purpose in a Godless world</p>
<sup>17</sup> that the idea that events in nature might be purpose-driven has generally been considered unscientific—teleology has effectively been banished by science. Teleology
<sup>18</sup> is the idea that design and purpose are inherent in nature. Teleological views of nature predominated in pre-scientific religious worldviews.
<a>psychoanalytic</a> and behavioral, steered clear of teleology, emphasizing past causation of present behavior and excluding the possibility that any aspect of the future could cause the present.
<p>But, as Seligman et al. concluded:</p>
<a>purpose-driven</a>. Even the simplest organisms are, by definition, goal-directed. A purposeless universe became infused with purpose, and for humans,

<a>What Actually Is a Belief? And Why Is It So Hard to Change?</a>”
<div> <p>5. The serious science of consciousness needs to be differentiated from the plethora of consciousness pseudoscience that for years has cluttered the field and confused even educated laypeople.</p> </div>
<div> <p>6. The brain employs a process of <a>Bayesian reasoning</a> in doing this—a process of updating prior assumptions, i.e. revising the probabilities, when a new fact is learned or new evidence is observed.</p> </div>

<h1> How Our Brain Computes Attraction </h1>
<h2> New research sheds light onto how our brains combine the features of attraction. </h2>
<a>evolutionary psychology</a> study this issue in a variety of creative ways.
<a>Attraction</a> is an incredibly personal issue. Even though there are some statistical trends, we all have our unique attraction profile. For example, almost everyone places some value on both
<a>intelligence</a> and kindness. When it comes to physical features, height is reliably seen as attractive in men, while a
<a>low waist-hip ratio</a> is usually seen as attractive in women.
<a>vocal qualities</a>, and resemblance to features found in our opposite-sex parents (for heterosexual attraction).
<a>Scent</a> seems to play a role, as well, but usually not in a way that we can actually articulate. The point is: it's complicated.
<a>testosterone</a> levels (in both women and men), and even through women's menstrual cycles.
<p>For more details on this study, how and why it was done, you can listen to <a>Episode #09</a> of my podcast, "This World of Humans," in which I discuss all of this and more with Conroy-Beak. You can read the original research paper <a>here</a>. </p>
<p>At least when it comes to attraction, our brains really are capable of multidimensional computation.</p>

<h1> Dating a Man Who Is Separated but Not Yet Divorced? </h1>
<h2> Learn some of the cues you need to be aware of. </h2>
<p>There are many factors that can affect these triangulated relationships, and how they are combined can affect the outcome in different ways.</p>
<a>divorce</a> is inevitable. When that happens, they may not be as susceptible to any new relationship.
<p>Here are some of the cues you need to be aware of:</p>
<p>The man in those unfinished relationships may be temporarily available to a new partner, but is highly likely to go back to his other relationship.</p>
<p>Time the Prior Relationship Has Existed</p>
<a>boredom</a>, neglect, too much hostility without reparation, or just plain growing apart.
<a>intimacy</a>. These attachments can bring people back together after a separation in ways that new relationships are less likely to do.
<p>Quality Men Who Are Truly Torn</p>
<li>Whether or not that separated man talks well of his established partner. No blame, no attacks on character, and no created rationale for why he had to leave or how bad she was for leaving him.</li>
<li>His indecisive state of whether or not he’s doing the right thing.</li>
<li>Any promises that do not materialize in the time committed.</li>
<li>Hostility, judgment, or invalidation of “women.” You will be next.</li>
<li>How, and in what way, he has tried to make that prior relationship work. Did they go to couple’s <a>therapy</a>?</li>
<li>How clear he is on why the prior relationship didn’t work, his part in it, and how much he wants to, or feels obligated to, stay connected to her.</li>

<h1> 8 Behaviors That Signal a Relationship Is in Trouble </h1>
<h2> How couples can see darkness looming early enough to turn things around. </h2>
<p>I have spent the last four decades helping both established and newly-in-love couples understand the kinds of behaviors that signal potential relationship damage.</p>
<p>Whether they newly-in-love partners or those in a committed relationship, all intimate partners need to be on the watch if either of them begins to behave in any of the following eight ways.</p>
<p>1. The Distribution of Resources Change</p>
<p>The resources of an intimate relationship include finances, time, affection, availability, and interest. How those resources are shared by each partner is an indication of how fair and valuable they feel to each other. </p>
<p>When love is new, the resources that feed the relationship are freely given and willingly shared. Sadly, as love loses its initial fantasy and luster, the partners often become more self-serving and feel entitled to those resources.</p>
<p>They may begin to complain more that they are not getting what they feel they should and that the changes signal less interest or care from the other.</p>
<p>These are the kind of statements that are clear warning signs:</p>
<li>“You’re never available anymore when I need you.”</li>
<li>“You spend more time now with your friends than you do with me.”</li>
<li>“You’re at work much longer hours. Are you having an affair?”</li>
<li>“Who are you texting so much of the time?”</li>
<li>“We used to do so many things together. Now, you’re always tired. But, when other things come up that you’re more interested in, you suddenly have the energy to do them.”</li>
<li>“Why are you spending money on so many things that have nothing to do with us?”</li>
<li>“We always used to cuddle in the mornings before work. You’re out of here before I can even wake up.”</li>
<p>These kinds of comments reflect the changes in priority that the partners once had for each other. They reveal that other interests are using up resources that were once first set aside for the relationship.</p>
<p>2. A Partner Seems Preoccupied</p>
<p>Bids for connection, availability, fulfillment, inquiry, and affection seem to fall on deaf ears. One or both partners are preoccupied with whatever is more important at the time than being fully present for each other.</p>
<p>These are the kind of expressions that are clear warning signs:</p>
<li>“I walk out of the shower stark naked and you don’t even look up.”</li>
<li>“When I ask you about work, you just give me summations or curt answers like you are uninterested in sharing what’s going on there. You used to consult me about your decisions and wanted my input.”</li>
<li>“I’ve asked you three times about where you want to go for dinner, and you don’t even look up or you just tell me to figure it out. We used to think it was fun to plan these things together.”</li>
<li>“I shouldn’t have to tell you what I need. You used to know. Now you want me to send you a manual when I know you already have that information.”</li>
<li>“We never cuddle or talk in bed anymore. You’re just reading or staring into the ceiling. Don’t I matter to you anymore? Please tell me what’s going on.”</li>
<li>“Hello? Is anyone in there?”</li>
<li>“What’s going on, honey. You seem so preoccupied and it feels like you’re shutting me out.”</li>
<p>3. A Partner Quickly Shuts Down Communication</p>
<p>When love is new, most couples are deeply interested in each other’s thoughts, feelings, and needs. Attempts at communication are met with focus, presence, and patience. Each new idea is met with curiosity and sustained interest.</p>
<a>unconscious</a>, that effectively stops the other partner from continuing to make an effort to connect.
<p>Just imagine any one of these responses to your reaching out to share something with your partner. Would they make you want to continue sharing what you were thinking or feeling?</p>
<li>“That’s a really stupid idea.”</li>
<li>“You’re always complaining about your mother’s behaviors. What are you doing to make her act that way?”</li>
<li>“You’re making a mountain out of a molehill.”</li>
<li>“Why do you let these stuff like this even bother you. Just let them go.”</li>
<li>“I’ve heard you complain about these things over and over. Get real about what to expect.”</li>
<li>“This conversation is really boring.”</li>
<li>“I think you’re way too reactive here. Give the other guy a break.”</li>
<li>“Let me tell you how you should have handled this.”</li>
<li>“If you’d just learn to listen, maybe people would open up more to you.”</li>
<p>4. Partners Become More Negatively Reactive</p>
<p>Passion and enthusiasm are wonderful characteristics and normally enhance a relationship. They stem from a person’s love, interest, and participation in the things of life that make them alive and excited.</p>
<p>However, they share an emotional kinship with a dark twin. When levels of intensity are intertwined with negative reactivity, the partner on the other end is likely to be squelched and beaten down.</p>
<p>Without that honesty, it is up to the other partner to figure out when it is okay to connect, or to risk the curt and dismissive reaction.</p>
<p>These are typical comments that should be heeded as warning signs:</p>
<li>“Why do you always pick the wrong time to talk to me?”</li>
<li>“I can’t listen to your crap right now.”</li>
<li>“What makes you think that you can bother me whenever it’s convenient for you?”</li>
<li>“Come and talk to me when you have something important to say.”</li>
<li>“You know I don’t want to talk when I’m in the middle of something.”</li>
<li>“You’re so incredibly needy. Can’t you talk to someone else about this for a change?”</li>
<li>“You’re wearing out your welcome with your constant demands. I told you I don’t want to talk about it right now.”</li>
<p>5. A Partner Is Secretive</p>
<a>authenticity</a>, and honesty are crucial behaviors that are prominent in every good relationship I’ve seen. They are the hallmarks of open communication that help couples know each other deeply, along with what to expect, and how to handle it.
<p>The partners feeling they are being excluded from the truth often express these kinds of words:</p>
<li>“You’re coming home later and later at night from the office? Is something going on?”</li>
<li>“We used to lie in bed and talk in the mornings. Now you’re up, showered, and out before I even wake up? Where are you going?”</li>
<li>“You’re going out with your girlfriends for dinner again? Last week you didn’t come home until eleven and you were staggering. Did someone else bring you home?”</li>
<li>“There are several withdrawals for cash from our bank account last month. What did you use them for?</li>
<li>“Your best friend called here last night looking for you. You told me you were out to dinner with him. Where were you?”</li>
<li>“Somebody is texting you in the middle of the night? When I reach for your phone, you grab it away from me and tell me it’s just a nuisance call. Three times this week? C’mon. Who is it?”</li>
<li>“You changed your password on your IPad without telling me. That’s never happened before. Are you hiding something?”</li>
<p>6. The Relationship Feels Stagnant</p>
<a>boredom</a>. In new relationships, the continuous flow of new information keeps both partners interested and interesting.
<p>The following are examples of reaching out for more excitement:</p>
<li>“Honey, we never do anything really fun anymore.”</li>
<li>“You seem so into yourself these days. You hardly share your life with me like you used to. What’s going on with you?”</li>
<li>“We seem so routine and mechanical in our sex life. Are you feeling the same way? Do you want something different?”</li>
<li>“I’ve asked you so many times not to just have the same conversation every time we go out to dinner. We need to be more stimulating to each other, don’t you think?”</li>
<li>“Can we please set aside some time and plan a real vacation, just the two of us? We’re really in a rut, and I’m worried.”</li>
<li>“I hate to say this, babe, but I’m really bored with our relationship. I’m not blaming either of us, but I really need something different to look forward to. Same-old, same-old is just not <a>cutting</a> it anymore for me.</li>
<li>“You sure are the hit of the party when we’re out with other people. No one would want to date the guy I live with.”</li>
<p>Successful conflict resolution is one of the pillars of a quality relationship. Partners who know how to identify and willingly attack differences and problem without pre-judgment or assumption, learn from their disagreements.</p>
<a>athletic</a> or business team, they go over what happened, talk about each of their accountability in what went wrong, figure out how they can do it better next time, and promise each other they will do their best to keep those agreements.
<p>This is what people sound like when their negative interactions are getting more prominent:</p>
<li>“I’m sick of trying to settle anything with you. We just keep going over the same sick arguments and it never gets any better.”</li>
<li>“Are you going to play the martyred card again, so I’ll end up the bad guy again? Why don’t you just skip the pretense and tell me you don’t like me, okay?”</li>
<li>“Haven’t we had this same go-around a hundred times. We both know you’re going to walk out the door when you can’t get your way. Why don’t you just do it right now and get it over with?”</li>
<li>“I don’t know why I even try to talk to you. You never listen and you always think you’re right anyway.”</li>
<li>“Don’t just walk in here and start belly-aching. I’m sick of your constant complaining when you don’t even ask what’s going on first?”</li>
<p>8. You’ve Stopped Touching as Much</p>
<a>sexual</a> interaction, or just being near each other. Most couples, over time, find a balance between each other’s needs and try to work out any differences.
<p>These are the typical expressions of someone who is missing touch:</p>
<li>“Sweetheart, what’s the matter? You pull away every time I reach out for you. Are you angry at me?”</li>
<li>“Please tell me if you aren’t attracted to me anymore. It’s really hard to see you turn over in bed without the hugs we used to have.”</li>
<li>“When I ask for a hug, you seem to give me a perfunctory quick one. Am I asking for too much?”</li>
<li>“You’re having a little trouble getting aroused. Are you having a problem you need to tell me about?”</li>
<li>“Hey. If you’re not interested in me, who’s in the picture?”</li>
<li>“I’m starting to feel like a needy person around you like there’s something wrong with me. I miss touching but you don’t seem to. Please, please just tell me if there is a reason you are so distant?”</li>
<li>“Okay, babe. No sex except on the weekends, now?. What the hell is going on?”</li>
<p>If instead, there is sabotage, broken promises, assumptions without bases, withholding, betrayal, <a>emotional abuse</a>, retaliation, sabotage, or evasive illusions, that couple may find themselves too far into the destruction process to come out.</p>
