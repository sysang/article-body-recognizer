<p>He was a doorbell ditcher. </p>
<p>A TikTok user says she caught her husband cheating on her after inspecting footage taken by their doorbell security camera. </p>
<p>Kaylie Kristina — known on the social media app as @kaylie271 — shared shocking footage from the camera purportedly showing her spouse sneaking his scantily clad mistress out of their marital home back in October. </p>
<p>“When your husband is too sick to go on the family trip you planned,” Kristina captioned the initial clip.</p>
<p>The black and white footage, taken just after 10 p.m., suggests that the man and his mistress have just enjoyed a secret tryst inside the family residence. </p>
<p>The man is seen bidding the woman farewell on the front steps of the home, sharing a tender kiss and squeezing her derrière.</p>
<p>The woman is wearing only a T-shirt and a tiny pair of shorts as she holds her car keys and waves goodbye after locking lips. </p>
<p>Kristina added the hashtags “#cheater” and “#garbage” to the incriminating footage. </p>
<p>The devastated wife first shared the footage two months ago to her TikTok account, where it quickly went viral and was viewed more than 5 million times. </p>
<p>“He thought the camera was disabled,” Kristina wrote in the comments section, explaining her husband’s brazen behavior. She added that her beau had even installed the security device himself. </p>
<p> “Locks have been changed and he no longer resides here,” she posted several days later. </p>
<p>Kristina hasn’t let her spouse back in the house in the intervening months, recently re-sharing the doorbell camera clip. </p>
<p>She also posted a video update in response to a follower who asked whether she has forgiven her unfaithful husband. </p>
<p>Kristina has recently updated her TikTok bio to read: “Taking out the trash.” It appears to be a dig at her estranged spouse. </p>
<p>She did not disclose whether he is still seeing his mistress. The Post has reached out to Kristina for comment. </p>

<h1> Woman quarantined at home discovers her boyfriend cheating on NYE</h1>
<div> January 3, 2022 6:41pm <div> Updated <div> January 4, 2022 11:42am </div> </div> </div>
<p>A British woman was in for a tragic surprise on New Year’s Eve 2020 when she found her boyfriend in bed with another girl.</p>
<p>Manchester resident Ally Newsham, now 30, had been dating her beau Ross Thaker, now 32, for almost two years. </p>
<p>Thaker told Newsham that he was at a pal’s house on New Year’s Eve while she was quarantining at home alone. </p>
<p>She explained what went down to HotSpot Media, and said she was “crushed” that she couldn’t be with her man to ring in 2021.</p>
<p>“When he didn’t reply to my texts, I knew something wasn’t right. After I found out he’d been having sex with someone while I was celebrating alone, I felt sick to my stomach,” the account manager said.</p>
<p>She opted to make herself pretty and drink a bottle of Prosecco while stuck in isolation. While watching the fireworks, she waited for any sign of communication from Thaker, which she never received.</p>
<p>“Then, at midnight, he didn’t even wish me [a happy New Year]. I was so upset with him, I just went to bed,” Newsham noted. The next day, when she tried to call Thaker, another woman answered his phone.</p>
<p>She burst into tears after the woman abruptly hung up on her. “I couldn’t believe Ross had done this to me. I felt so betrayed,” she said. Her boyfriend texted her soon after, saying he loved her. </p>
<p>Newsham’s epic reply: “He says whilst lay in another woman’s bed.” </p>

<h1> Twitter tracks down mystery couple in viral proposal photos</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> June 24, 2021 7:56pm <div> Updated <div> June 24, 2021 7:56pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>For a refreshing twist, Twitter banned together to do some good.</p>
<p>A photographer visiting San Francisco’s Sutro Baths captured a heartwarming wedding proposal. The problem? She didn’t know the couple — so she turned to Twitter for help. </p>
<p>Valerie Contreras was visiting her friends in the Bay Area who took her to watch the sunset and snap some photos of the ocean on June 19.</p>
<p>When they got to the beach, they noticed a couple walking around all dressed up. Contreras told The Post that she suspected an engagement was going to happen as she watched the man walking around the area continuously touching his pocket.</p>
<p>That’s when the Texas-based photographer decided to set up her gear “and sure enough, the beautiful moment happened.” </p>
<p>“It was honestly such a genuine and feel-good moment,” Contreras said of the emotional moment. “They both looked so happy and in love.”</p>
<p>While the pair had clearly found love, Contreras, who was far away using her zoom lens, was on a mission to find the lovebirds to give them the sweet snaps. And since she didn’t know the happy couple, she took to Twitter.</p>
<p>“I literally thought to myself, ‘I’ll have Twitter help me find them,’ and they did,” she said.</p>
<p>The now-viral tweet now has over 691,000 likes and 94,000 retweets since Contreras posted the photos on June 21 with the caption: “HELP ME FIND THIS COUPLE!”</p>
<p>She followed up, tweeting: “I would really love to send them all the photos I was able to get from their special moment.”</p>
<p>In the end, Contreras thanked the Twitterverse: “You all are… powerful humans… I can’t believe we found them thank you all so much!!!”</p>
<p>Contreras also posted the pictures to Instagram where she updated her followers on the journey to find the mystery couple.</p>
<p>Johnson and Winn met through their Sacramento church a little over two years ago when he offered to help Winn, who is a teacher, grade papers.</p>
<p>The Ohio native told The Post that he “knew very early on that I wanted to marry her and finally began planning the proposal about a month ago.”</p>
<p>Remembering the emotional moment, Johnson said he was “hoping neither one of us fell into the water as it’s really windy in San Francisco and the walkway to the spot was very small.”</p>
<p>But once the couple was in the perfect spot, he knew it was destiny.</p>
<p>“I had a really warm feeling because I was about to tell the love of my life that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her and I knew she would be really happy and excited,” he said.</p>
<p>Johnson had hired a photographer to capture the special moment but was happy to have the extra, candid shots — and the well wishes.</p>
<p>“We were so surprised by the number of people congratulating us and sending us warm wishes. We also were stunned by how they located us within only a couple hours,” he said, adding the couple has “no complaints.” </p>
<p>Johnson told <a>SFGate</a> that he and his now-fiancée were together when she got a text from a friend, informing them that they had gone viral.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how the internet works, and I don’t know how they found us, but it was like finding a needle in a haystack,” Johnson said.</p>

<h1> Woman goes ‘psycho’ using tampon serial numbers to catch cheating boyfriend</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 4, 2022 6:08pm <div> Updated <div> January 5, 2022 11:17am </div> </div> </div>
<p>A British woman has gone to extreme lengths to uncover whether her boyfriend was cheating on her after she found a wrapped tampon that wasn’t hers concealed in his home. </p>
<p>Lois Saunders, 23, took to TikTok on Monday to reveal she found the menstrual product alongside a tube of mascara stuffed under a closet in the college dorm room of her lover, Finn. </p>
<p>“I’ve just found a tampon and a mascara under Finn’s wardrobe, and he’s in denial that he’s had a girl here,” Saunders states in the clip, which has gone viral on the social media site. </p>
<p>Finn claimed he had no idea who the sanitary item belonged to, saying it must have been left behind by the dorm’s previous occupant. </p>
<p>In the clip, a jilted Saunders is seen reaching for the Tampax stuffed in a crack under the closet, saying there isn’t enough dust on it for it to have been lying there for a long period time.</p>
<p>In a move that would surely impress Nancy Drew, the brainy blond decided to contact Tampax manufacturer Procter Gamble and send Tampax the serial number on the box to find out when the tampon was made.</p>
<p>She shared screenshots of her correspondence with the companies in the TikTok clip. </p>
<p>A Tampax representative soon responded to Saunders’ email, writing: “Based on the code … the tampon was made December 11, 2019.”</p>
<p>The rep added that the tampons do not have an official expiration date, but have a shelf life of five years. </p>
<p>Saunders told her TikTok followers that the date of the tampon’s creation far preceded the date that Finn moved into his dorm room, and she was seemingly satisfied that her man was not cheating on her. </p>
<p>“We were just laughing about it together, because it was a bit of a joke,” Saunders said in a follow-up video, revealing that she had only recently begun seriously dating her beau.</p>
<p>“He had obviously never swept under the wardrobe … I believe him. We are still together, and very happy!” she further declared.</p>
<p>However, some of Saunders’ followers weren’t laughing at her behavior, with one even branding her a “borderline psycho.”</p>
<p>“Finn, run! Red flag!” one male viewer wrote. </p>
<p>“There’s nothing that men hate more than a woman who not only doesn’t trust, but then goes snooping. Because she has to be right,” another man commented. </p>
<p>A third bluntly stated: “This is why I’m gay,” and a fourth mused A third added: ‘I’m not sure if this is genius or borderline psycho.”</p>
<p>However, there were thousands of other followers who were wowed by Saunders’ sleuthing. </p>
<p>“If I ever get kidnapped, ask her to solve my case!” one impressed fan wrote. </p>
<p>Another chimed in: “The lengths us girls go to. Men have no idea what we’re capable of. They could never.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some were left unsatisfied by Saunders’ detective work, claiming it did not necessarily absolve Finn of infidelity. </p>
<p>“DNA fibers from the mascara is the only next possible step,” a viewer hilariously quipped, mocking Saunders’ elaborate investigation. </p>

<p>Even dolphins need a helping hand sometimes.</p>
<p>In the footage, Silva can be seen piloting the boat to the area and visually locating the dolphin. Silva could only get the boat so close, so he had to turn the engine off and drift towards the panicked animal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he was able to get close enough to grab the net with a long pole. After pulling the dolphin in close to the boat, Silva began cutting it free from the net with his knife.</p>
<p>After cutting some net away, the dolphin tried to swim off while still being partially tangled. After the dolphin briefly disappeared under the boat, Silva was able to get regain control and finish cutting the net away.</p>
<p>While he was able to free the dolphin without the animal suffering any injuries, Silva appeared to have cut his finger during the ordeal. Once the dolphin was freed, however, he didn’t seem to mind the injury.</p>

<h1> Baby Shark is the first YouTube video to cross 10 billion views</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 12:27pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 12:52pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“Baby Shark,” which weaseled its way into our homes and ears, has hit a major milestone.</p>
<p>The YouTube video featuring the children’s tune finally amassed 10 billion views, making it the first clip on the platform to do so.</p>
<p>Since it passed the record-breaking marker, it garnered another 8.7 million views as of Friday.</p>
<p>” ‘Baby Shark Dance’ became the first video in history to hit 10 billion views on YouTube,” the Pinkfong company, creator of the video, tweeted, along with a call for fans to share their favorite dance moments.</p>
<p>“Ten billion views doo doo doo doo doo doo,” the tweet continued to the tune of the popular track.</p>
<p>The original video, posted in 2016, features the singing of then-10-year-old Hope Segoine and was an instant hit amongst kids everywhere. </p>
<p>Three years later, it earned a coveted spot on the <a>Billboard Hot 100’s Top 40</a>, and in 2020, the video was crowned as the “<a>most viewed</a>” on YouTube.</p>
<a>debuted an animated series</a> with Nickelodeon Animation Studio called “Baby Shark’s Big Show!” Since its premiere, it has garnered more than 26 million viewers across Nickelodeon’s various channels.
<p>Despite originally being recorded for kids, the catchy track expanded its audience last year after it appeared in the popular Apple TV+ show “Ted Lasso.”</p>
<p>In the series, one of Lasso’s soccer players earns his own fan chant to the tune: “Jamie Tartt, doo doo doo doo doo doo.”</p>
<p><a>Pinkfong said</a> it “achieved more views than the entire human population with its video.”</p>
<p>“Baby Shark,” complete with its own dance, is “one of the most notable cultural phenomena generating tremendous amounts of engagement across the world,” according to the parent company.</p>

<h1> Petition to oust Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg renews bid for recalls in NY</h1>
<div> January 12, 2022 5:58pm <div> Updated <div> January 12, 2022 7:27pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>An online petition seeking the ouster of embattled Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg is gaining traction over his controversial policies to downgrade or not prosecute certain crimes.</p>
<p>More than 1,800 people had signed on to the change.org petition as of 5 p.m. Wednesday with the heading: “REMOVE MANHATTAN DA BRAGG. DEMAND A RECALL ELECTION NOW.”</p>
<a>Curtis Sliwa</a>, the GOP candidate for mayor last year — calls for an amendment to the state constitution to allow for a recall election of Bragg.
<p>That revision would require approval of the state Legislature and then voters via a ballot referendum and take several years.</p>
<p>Unlike California, New York does not have a recall provision for voters to remove an elected official before their scheduled re-election.</p>
<p>More immediately, they said Gov. Kathy Hochul could initiate a proceeding under the public officers law to remove Bragg, which would require an extensive investigation and findings of wrongdoing or misconduct.</p>
<p>“While DA Bragg experiments with dangerous policy, Manhattan’s most vulnerable citizens and business owners remain at risk.”</p>
<p>They called it “deeply irresponsible” for Bragg to say prosecutors should only seek incarceration as a “last resort” when prosecuting crimes.</p>
<p>“T<code>o</code> not seek carceral sentence other than for homicide exposes Bragg’s ignorance, and inability to defend and protect his constitution,” Giuliani and Sliwa said.</p>
<p>They said it’s about time that New York allowed for a recall provision of an elected official as California does.</p>

<h1> NFL continues to reward rotten, me-first behavior</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 18, 2021 5:09pm <div> Updated <div> December 18, 2021 5:09pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Believe it or not, I’ve never been an NFL team owner, GM or head coach. I swear. You can look it up. </p>
<p>Yet, I’m convinced that I can do what none of the above have: Prevent my team from losing even one game for selfish, self-absorbed in-game behavior. </p>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin is widely heralded as among the best in the business. Yet, during his 14 years at the wheel, the Steelers have succeeded or tried to succeed in losing games to rotten post-play conduct. </p>
<p>Including a Super Bowl. </p>
<p>In the 2009 Super Bowl, the Cardinals led the Steelers, 23-20, when Ben Roethlisberger, with under a minute left, completed a pass to wide receiver Santonio Holmes, a career me-first guy as later would be seen here after joining the Jets. </p>
<p>Holmes was tackled at the Cards’ 6, clock running. Instead of hustling to the new line of scrimmage, Holmes, with no awareness beyond himself, rose and ran further downfield in a look-at-me/ain’t-I-special routine. </p>
<p>With 35 seconds left, the winning TD was caught … by Holmes, who was voted the game’s MVP despite his effort to become the biggest fool in NFL history. </p>
<p>Now, call me a curmudgeon (or a crab), but if I were Tomlin, on the first day of practice to start the 2010 season, I’d have gathered my team, shown them how the Super Bowl was nearly lost, then addressed my troops: </p>
<p>“See this? It’s never to happen again on my watch. We shall never surrender 15 penalty yards, let alone risk the loss of any game, to such garbage. And I don’t want any of you guys to risk lasting infamy.” </p>
<p>Apparently, that never happened. Tomlin’s Steelers continued to be a team that allowed games to be determined by rotten, me-first behavior. </p>
<p>Thursday night, Dec. 9, the Steelers, with no timeouts left, trailed the Vikings, 36-28, 37 seconds left. On 4th-and-1 from Minnesota’s 44, Roethlisberger hit WR Chase Claypool at the 34, first down, clock running. </p>
<p>Roethlisberger was unable to stop the clock until 24 seconds remained. Fox’s Joe Buck and Troy Aikman either missed it or ignored it. </p>
<h2>Worst teams get most fan-friendly NFL kickoff times</h2>
<p>Last week’s early games included the 5-7 Saints at the 3-9 Jets, the 4-8 Seahawks at the 2-10 Texans (a noon start in Houston), and the 5-7 Falcons at the 5-7 Panthers. </p>
<p>The 4:25 window included an East Coast game, the 7-5 Bills at the 9-3 Buccaneers, with a night game hosted by 9-3 Green Bay, outdoors. </p>
<p>By midseason, sunshine games, those most welcomed by ticket-buyers and PSL-owners/suckers, are top heavy with miserable teams. </p>
<p>In ESPN transplant Adam Amin, Fox has another play-by-player who would have us believe that stats make games when games make stats. Another who would ignore what he has seen all game to read off a stat sheet. </p>
<p>Sunday, the Jets down by 10 to the Saints and in fourth quarter-desperate mode, went for it on fourth-and-6 from midfield. Amin then saw fit to illuminate us with, “The Jets are one-for-one on fourth down today.” </p>
<p>What did that previous fourth down play have to do with this one? Absolutely nothing. And Zach Wilson next threw incomplete. </p>
<p>But Amin is certainly not alone in such misleading and irrelevant game-in-a-vacuum statistical folly. </p>
<p>Dr. George M. Beard wrote that such matter is “the home not so much for the abjectly ignorant as of the fractionally educated; not of the raw, but of the underdone, the paradise of non-experts.” </p>
<p>Beard wrote that in 1879 in “The Psychology of Spiritualism.” </p>
<p>By the way, reader E.C. was thrilled to see Ohio State’s basketball team on TV, wearing “their traditional black uniforms.”</p>
<h2>Have to pay up to see Rangers</h2>
<p>So Tuesday’s Rangers-Avalanche game could only been seen by those who coughed up a monthly fee to receive an extra-pay ESPN tier, the first of three Rangers games this season to be so hidden from view. </p>
<p>The NHL has adopted the old drug-addicted prostitute business model: “Do anything you want to me, mister, as long as you pay me.” Gary Bettman would call this “Growing the game”? </p>
<p>So when the Knicks took a total of 91 3s, making 33 of them, in consecutive home losses to the Bucks then Warriors last week, exactly what was their strategy? Wherein was the beauty, let alone the value, of the games? </p>
<p>And when Steph Curry <a>broke the 3-point record</a> by making 5 of 14 vs. the Knicks while the Warriors totaled 15-of-40, the game, starring 82 3-point heaves, made less sense than it did history. </p>
<p>Attention all mute buttons! For a third consecutive Sunday, Fox has assigned Mark Schlereth to smother a Jets or Giants game in whistle-to-snap pigskin palaver. Sunday he has been chosen to wreck the Cowboys-Giants telecast. </p>
<p>I’ve awakened to become woke! No longer will “lady bug” appear in this column. From now on, it’s “non-binary bug.”</p>

<h1> Inequality created by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas the antithesis of fair play</h1>

<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 24, 2021 12:37am <div> Updated <div> December 24, 2021 1:31am </div> </div> </div>
<p>As I watched the MiraLAX Irritable Bowel Bowl on ESPN, it struck me that The Age of Reason is long gone. We’re now stuck in The Age of No Good Reason. </p>
<p>This column has assiduously avoided presidential politics and policies unless they intersect with sports. </p>
<p>During his presidential campaign, Joe Biden issued this vow: “I promise you, there is no reason to suggest that there should be any right denied your [transgender] daughter. … None. Zero.” </p>
<p>Upon his inauguration, he reaffirmed his inflexible position on biological males competing in women’s sports: </p>
<p>“Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room or school sports.” </p>
<p>I’m left to lean on the visceral, the first-person “what-if.” </p>
<p>The latest case of gone-too-far has been witnessed by the record-smashing performances of University of Pennsylvania female swimmer Lia Thomas, a former also-swam on Penn’s male team as Will Thomas. </p>
<a>making their disapproval known.</a> Thomas’s successes as a female swimmer don’t come close to the minimal standards of passing the stink test. They reek of race-fixing —
<a>the antithesis of fair play. </a>
<p>Still, unless they abjectly apologize for their inability to abandon common sense, these logical naysayers risk being tossed into that vat of intolerant evil “haters,” then boiled as transphobic. </p>
<p>Not bad. Of course, after such inactive activism to promote or sustain fair play, the conspirators could face even presidential censure. But such are the risks in a world gone nuts. </p>
<h2>Selfish Mike Leach blasts ‘selfish’ players</h2>
<p>The Quote of the Bowl Season belongs to Mississippi State coach Mike Leach. On the trend of star players declining to play in bowl games to protect their safety, thus their draft status and NFL signing money: </p>
<p>Admirable sentiments, to be sure, except perversely comical coming from Leach. </p>
<p>At Washington State, his teams accounted for 29 arrests — the most in the nation during his time. </p>
<p>Small surprise that NBC studio regular Rodney Harrison interviewed Snoop Dogg as part of NBC’s Sunday night Saints-Buccaneers package. </p>
<p>Or perhaps Harrison wasn’t inclined to bring up any of that under the pretense that if Dogg is plenty good enough for Goodell, he’s plenty good enough for all of us. </p>
<p>Imagine, there are still some golf fans who were surprised over the weekend that NBC pretended that no other duo competed in the father-son event than Tiger Woods and Son. </p>
<p>Some golf fans even seemed upset that host Dan Hicks would drool so much syrupy baloney about Woods that our TV screens would need a squeegee man. </p>
<p>But TV, despite piles of growing evidence to the extreme contrary, is sticking to its 25-year story that Woods is the finest human to walk the Earth. </p>
<p>What’s in a name? Which network, in a full-screen graphic this week, almost impossibly displayed Ralph Houk as “Ralph Houck”? That’s right, the MLB Network. </p>
<p>Reader Rich Meyerson asks why New York NFL audiences have every Sunday been punished by the presence of yak-in-the-box Mark Schlereth. Is there a message within? Yes. It’s a sign to repent, sinners, repent! </p>
<p>Where does the time go? Thanks to CBS, we learned this week that San Diego State won it first bowl game “since 2019.” Last year, SDSU turned down bowl invites due to COVID. </p>
<p>Reader Bruce Desatnick: “The problem with the Jets and Giants is that both already stink next season.” Still, a lot has to do with how they make out in the mock drafts. </p>
<h1> John Madden passed up his chance to stop the NFL’s decay</h1>
<div> January 6, 2022 8:19pm <div> Updated <div> January 6, 2022 8:19pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Land of Woulda-Coulda-Shoulda lies in a vast, barren wasteland — the desolate site of the Crypts of Lost Opportunities.</p>
<p>John Madden passed on Dec. 28. Long celebrated as the best of TV analysts for his “Booms!” his appearances in beer ads, travel on buses and his Thanksgiving Day feasts, I understood his popularity. To a point.</p>
<p>If only he could have applied his presence to the good and welfare of football. He didn’t.</p>
<p>Thus, to me, he was first in a continuing series of disappointments among those who would have, could have and should have made a difference.</p>
<p>Madden actually chose to applaud some perps.</p>
<p>Late in a game his team was winning, Deion Sanders intercepted a pass, then needlessly, mindlessly tried to lateral it. Madden logically should have knocked Sanders’ senselessness.</p>
<p>Instead, he claimed that this play proved Sanders to be “the most entertaining man in football.”</p>
<p>The only on-field personnel Madden knocked were defenseless game officials. Yet Madden had a rotten grasp of NFL rules.</p>
<p>As a pre-Roger Goodell NFL VP told me, Madden, when told he was bashing officials for correctly enforcing rules, Madden’s reply was, “Then change the rules.”</p>
<p>Madden was never known as a grateful or gracious employee. During his 14 years at CBS, he depended on lower-rung insiders to do his weekly biddings.</p>
<p>When he left for Fox and a record $6 million per, he didn’t bother to thank any of them, those who helped Madden become TV star John Madden.</p>
<p>While at Fox, which adding to his enormous wealth, he publicly stated he’d one day like to call “Monday Night Football” on ABC.</p>
<p>Madden’s <a>top-selling video game</a> came with twisted elements designed to desensitize the young in no further need of twisting.</p>
<p>One edition included the package-printed come-on: “Sack the quarterback! Send him to the hospital!”</p>
<p>That appeared with the game as an ambulance racing onto the field to scoop up the QB, running over players as it went, leaving those players to drip computerized red blood.</p>
<p>In my second long conversation with Madden, I asked if this met with his approval, his sense of football as a sport. He didn’t like the question.</p>
<p>“What do you want me to do, have all the games recalled?”</p>
<p>No, but how did you allow such content to be sold under your name?</p>
<p>Madden replied that he had no say in the matter. I replied that he should have the first and last word in anything sold in his name.</p>
<p>That was our last conversation.</p>
<p>But just as I’d have a tough time ignoring Madden’s passing, I won’t write what I don’t believe. Take it or leave it, it’s just my version of a tough-to-write, unpopular truth. </p>
<h2>Reasonable criticism now gets you fired</h2>
<a>several times mildly criticizing MLB commissioner Rob Manfred</a>, who hasn’t even earned legitimate mild praise, is both disturbing and unsurprising.
<p>MLBN is likely guilty of crimes committed by nearly all networks and teams that control the networks on which they appear: treating viewers, often subscribers, as morons.</p>
<p>It’s called good faith. Mostly forbidden, good faith has never cost any network even one viewer.</p>
<p>That ended, never to return, with the Garden’s sale to the Dolan Family in 1995.</p>
<a>can insist he’s not a house man</a>, but there’s too much evidence to the contrary.
<p>For years, most everything on ESPN and ESPN Radio have become transparent promotions of ESPN goods. WFAN has become a sports gambling station to reflect ownership’s investments in sports gambling.</p>
<p>The sacking of Rosenthal, who maintains his Fox weekend gigs, will allow MLB Network more time to promote what now seems to matter most: MLB’s daily gambling lines and the Manfred-certified Top 100 Bat Flips.</p>
<a>You’re done</a>.” But Goodell is more likely to invite Brown to perform at halftime of the Super Bowl.
<p>In a 91-82 loss to the Clippers last week, the Celtics shot 4-for-42 on 3-pointers. Adam Silver is no dope. How much longer before he makes an executive decision to return basketball to NBA games?</p>

<h1> Networks foolishly love Alex Rodriguez – and we are paying the price</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 8, 2022 2:29pm <div> Updated <div> January 8, 2022 2:31pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>‘Hey, Rocky, watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat! … Wrong hat.”</p>
<p>And now, in its latest attempt to reinvent the flat tire, ESPN will fine-tune “Sunday Night Baseball” by adding a Manning-style supplemental broadcast featuring Michael Kay and Alex Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Still, based on Rodriguez’s appearances here, there and everywhere, both ESPN and Fox still feel as if we adore him, when there’s far more evidence, especially among intelligent baseball fans, to the polar contrary.</p>
<p>ESPN and Fox have their fingers on a pulse that doesn’t beat.</p>
<p>But perhaps it’s us, not him. Perhaps it’s just a matter of perspective, one we can’t share with Rodriguez being that we’re from different worlds with radically different rules, rewards and punishments.</p>
<p>Perhaps many are left flabbergasted by Rodriguez’s sustained popularity within ESPN and Fox because we never walked in his shoes.</p>
<p>After all, how many of us have been in a position to invest millions of dollars, cultivated from years of making millions of dirty drug dollars, on an NBA team?</p>
<p>Was his illegal drug use essential to creating his fame and fortune, enough to designate him as the voice and face of baseball on two of MLB’s national networks? Enough to buy a big chunk of the Minnesota Timberwolves?</p>
<p>Logic tells us it made a huge difference — he didn’t think those PEDS made him better at crossword puzzles.</p>
<h2>Goodell admits Supe act not suitable for families</h2>
<p>There have been too many times, lately, when I can’t believe that what I’m about to write can possibly be true. For instance, right here and now:</p>
<p>And Goodell’s good with it. Last week, he even made a wisecrack about it.</p>
<p>Goodell appeared with Eli and Peyton Manning on their in-game Monday night show, and Peyton popped the chops-busting question:</p>
<p>Goodell: “I don’t think I could tell you a single title without violating your rules on using language on air, so I think I’m going to have to pass on that one.”</p>
<p>In other words, he acknowledged that Snoop Dogg’s act is X-rated, not the least bit suitable for the Commissioner of the NFL to address in detail.</p>
<p>But come the Super Bowl, Goodell has certified Snoop’s vulgar act as well as the acts of other unprintably vulgar and salacious, crotch-grabbing rappers Eminem and Kendrick Lamar, as meeting the NFL’s standards and blessings.</p>
<p>So Goodell knows what’s coming. Again. And he’s good with it, has fun with it. He’s shameless. Perhaps he’ll demonstrate the courage of his convictions by holding his crotch while presenting the Lombardi Trophy.</p>
<h2>Buck the analytics Buck!</h2>
<p>Those who have watched Buck Showalter successfully manage teams hope he was mostly teasing when he said he’ll rely on both analytics as well as his long-conditioned instincts to manage the Mets.</p>
<p>Last year, the Mets’ Edwin Diaz blew six saves and went 5-6 — far too many decisions for a designated closer — due to preseason-scripted analytics.</p>
<p>I can’t see Showalter excuse fundamental failings, starting with running to first base and swinging from the heels on 0-2 pitches.</p>
<p>Consider: A team that can win, say, six more games by playing smart baseball under a manager who insists on such, also loses six fewer games, a swing of 12 games.</p>
<h1> More proof Roger Goodell doesn’t care about NFL fans</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 12:43am <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 12:44am </div> </div> </div>
<p>One-stop shopping. Five minutes and out.</p>
<p>Similar incidents have happened and for many years, yet this one was different, begging for cutting viewers a break, as sticking with the usual plan benefitted no one.</p>
<p>Or, if not, CBS would defy illogical broadcasting rules to allow its audience to witness the final three minutes in a big game and, as advertised, perhaps the last game played by Ben Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>Whatever, I’d have chosen common sense over abuse of an audience that had already invested more than three hours in watching a game’s outcome to throw in a few more minutes to complete its mission and tacit promise.</p>
<p>What was Goodell going to do, publicly complain that CBS treated its viewers right by best serving all audiences? Punish CBS by not cashing its checks?</p>
<p>And just before CBS was forced to leave that OT game, Mike Tomlin’s Steelers again risked losing — or not winning — a game to a player who had no better idea of what was going on other than his bloated sense of self.</p>
<p>With 3:27 left in OT, Pittsburgh receiver Diontae Johnson, after being shoved out of bounds by safety Geno Stone, tried to start a sideline fight! The game? Didn’t matter to him!</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, that sideline carried Goodell’s latest social messaging reminding viewers, for a second straight season, that those who watch NFL games are mostly presumed to be uncivilized bigots.</p>
<p>The Eagles, condemned by the NFL and ESPN to play a late-night winter game instead of an afternoon game on a wide-open Saturday, are among those Goodell “good investments” PSL teams.</p>
<p>This playoff weekend, more “It’s All About Our Fans”:</p>
<p>The best eligible climate in which to play an outdoor January night game, Tampa, will host Eagles-Buccaneers on Sunday — at 1 p.m. Huh?</p>
<p>The worst climate to play an outdoor January night game, Buffalo, will host Patriots-Bills on Saturday — at 8:15 p.m., when it’s expected to be no warmer than 10 degrees. Brilliant, Roger, brilliant!</p>
<p>At more than $60 million per year to reach such decisions, if Goodell were any better to NFL fans, he’d buy back their “good investments” PSLs at 3 cents on the dollar.</p>
<h2>Who’s Rex to Judge anyone?</h2>
<p>ESPN’s Rex Ryan this week ripped Joe Judge for a lack of class. That’s rich.</p>
<p>Ryan then sent Enemkpali, a two-seasons NFL sub, to serve as a coin-toss captain for the Bills before a game against the Jets — a classless, unprofessional, childish move.</p>
<p>With Dobie gone, it won’t be the same down at the Gillis Grocery Store. Think I’ll go downtown with Maynard and watch ’em tear down the old Endicott Building.</p>
<h2>Too many useless analysts, too few good ones</h2>
<a>who hadn’t stopped speaking all game</a> — often noting that the Giants have no offense — had chosen silence after Golladay’s premature surrender.
<p>He first explained Patrick Mahomes, the 2018 NFL MVP: “[Coach] Andy Reid has developed this offense around Patrick Mahomes’ versatility.” Who knew?</p>
<p>After the game, ESPN analyst Randy Moss noted the Chiefs’ go-ahead touchdown was “a game-changer.”</p>
<p>Two nights later, during the Georgia-Alabama CFP championship, Herbstreit chose to talk the entire game, rendering anything that might have been worth hearing lost to his own devices.</p>
<p>But there are now more analysts like that than ever before. Why? If I knew, you’d be the second to know!</p>
<p>It’s hard to explain to those unfamiliar with both, but before the Raiders had Fred Biletnikoff, <a>the Jets had Don Maynard</a>. Both were lanky, almost scrawny big-play, deep-end, sure-hands, mostly sideline receivers.</p>
<p>And both had the same style — no style. They just caught the ball. And if you didn’t realize how good they were after that, that wasn’t their problem.</p>
<p>But that was well before TV showed receivers making 6-yard catches, then rising to make first-down gestures, in slow-mo replays — before TV mindlessly decided to try to destroy the game.</p>

<h1> Trump says he tried to ‘f–k’ a married woman in 2005 video</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> October 7, 2016 4:40pm </div>
<p>Its release created a sensation just two days before the next presidential debate in St. Louis — and caused several high-profile Republicans to turn on him. Some even told him to step down.</p>
<p>“You know, I moved on her, actually,” Trump is heard saying of a woman — later identified as “Entertainment Tonight” host Nancy O’Dell — as the bus pulls into a studio parking lot.</p>
<p>“I moved on her and I failed. I’ll admit it,” he continues. “I did try and f- -k her. She was married.”</p>
<p>“That’s huge news,” Bush, now a co-host of NBC’s “Today” show, responds, sounding bewildered.</p>
<p>“I moved on her very heavily. In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. She wanted to get some furniture. I said I’ll show you where they have some nice furniture,” Trump adds to laughter.</p>
<p>“I moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there, and she was married. And then all of a sudden I see her, she’s not got the big phony t- -s and everything.”</p>
<p>Trump had been scheduled to make a cameo on the soap opera and wore a microphone as “Access Hollywood” trailed him.</p>
<p>“Your girl’s hot as s- -t, in the purple,” Bush is heard saying, apparently of Zucker.</p>
<p>“And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything . . . Grab them by the p- - -y.”</p>
<p>The two men come into view as they exit the bus to meet Zucker.</p>
<p>“How about a little hug for The Donald?” Bush asks the soap-opera star. “He just got off the bus.”</p>
<p>As Zucker complies and air-kisses him, Trump comments, “Melania said this was OK.” Trump married Melania, his third wife, in January 2005.</p>
<p>Trump appeared to confirm the validity of the recording on Friday and offered a rare apology. </p>
<p>“This was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago. </p>
<p>Bill Clinton has said far worse to me on the golf course — not even close,” he said in a statement. “I apologize if anyone was offended.”</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton quickly slammed her rival. </p>
<p>Trump appeared to confirm the validity of the recording on Friday and offered a rare video apology — before launching an attack on the Clintons.</p>
<p>“Anyone who knows me, knows these words don’t reflect who I am. I said it. I was wrong, and I apologize,” Trump said on the video released late Friday.</p>
<p>“I never said I’m a perfect person nor pretended to be someone that I’m not. I’ve said and done some things I regret and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them,” Trump said.</p>
<p>“I said some foolish things but Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.”</p>

<h1> Former Trump aide confirms president’s voice on ‘Access Hollywood’ tape</h1>
<div> December 3, 2017 6:09pm <div> Updated <div> December 4, 2017 1:51pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“It’s clear that it is,” David Bossie told NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday when asked if that was Trump’s voice on the tape.</p>
<p>Trump reportedly has been casting doubt on whether the vulgar 2005 conversation with TV host Billy Bush was actually real.</p>
<p>Since then, Trump has told a senator: “We don’t think that was my voice,” <a>the New York Times reported</a>.</p>
<p>But Bossie said he’s not disputing the validity of the tape.</p>
<p>“And I don’t think he … does either,” Bossie said of Trump.</p>

<p>Bush recounted several of the sexual harassment allegations against Trump, including those of Jill Harth and Kristin Anderson, stating that he believes the women.</p>

<p>CBS and the NFL Network’s Nate Burleson has the potential to be the next Michael Strahan — a former football player who crosses over into entertainment.</p>
<p>Burleson is making the next step in the process as he will be the New York correspondent for Billy Bush’s new comeback entertainment program, “Extra Extra,” when the show launches in September, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>Burleson, 37, has also signed a new two-year extension with CBS to continue on “The NFL Today,” his agent, Mark Lepselter confirmed. He will still be a co-host on the NFL Network’s acclaimed “Good Morning Football.”</p>
<p>“It elevates Nate where he is becoming more and more of a transcendent, crossover talent,” Lepselter said of the “Extra Extra” role.</p>
<p>Strahan is the measuring stick as he is on a host of programs, including Fox’s NFL pregame show and ABC’s “Good Morning America.”</p>
<p>Trump went on to be elected president, while Bush lost his job on “The Today Show.” “Extra Extra” will air on Fox 5 in New York.</p>
<p>Burleson, who is married with three children, may have been able to do more for “Extra Extra,” but with his morning show and Sunday responsibilities it was impossible.</p>
<p>“We had to modify his role,” Lepselter said.</p>
<p>“Extra Extra’s” senior executive producer, Lisa Gregorisch-Dempsey said she has been eyeing Burleson for some time and believes he is a “crossover star” and called him a “force of nature.”</p>
<h1> NYC townhouse Billy Bush was forced to give up amid scandal to list for $16M</h1>
<div> August 27, 2021 1:12pm <div> Updated <div> August 27, 2021 5:00pm </div> </div> </div>
<a>was forced to sell</a> his newly purchased Manhattan townhouse back in 2016. 
<p>Located in the upscale Chelsea neighborhood, the townhouse is expected to hit the market again in the coming week for $16 million, The Post has learned. </p>
<p>Bush, 49, initially purchased the home in December 2015 for $8.8 million and sold it at a loss a year later for $7,425,000 following a few price cuts, property records show. </p>
<p>Made up of six floors, the seven-bedroom, 11-bathroom property was last purchased in March 2020, at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and has been undergoing several renovations since. </p>
<p>Among the extensive changes taking place are:</p>
<li>Installation of an elevator </li>
<li>Fully excavated cellar with options for a home gym, theater and sauna/spa </li>
<li>Double-height ceiling from the fourth and fifth floors to allow for the projection of movies/concerts/sporting events </li>
<li>Multiple private terraces, balconies, rear yard with BBQ station and paved upper roof deck </li>
<li>Smart home audio-video automation and Wi-Fi boosters throughout the home for optimal internet connectivity, all controlled from a smartphone </li>
<li>Whole-house humidification system </li>
<li>Energy-efficient home with superior waterproofing and hydronic heating and cooling system </li>
<li>Extra sound barriers and insulation in the floors </li>
<li>Steel structure and sustainable home to last generations</li>
<p>The transformation features a 10-foot, gated front courtyard with a stoop (pending approval), two private terraces and three additional balconies, according to the listing. </p>
<p>Renovations are expected to be finished in the coming months, according to the developer Innovative Design Development.</p>
<p>Measuring 7,640 square feet of interior space and coupled with approximately 1,065 square feet of exterior space, the home boasts an abundance of rooms, including a roof deck. </p>
<p>A private elevator serves the garden level through to the penthouse floor.</p>
<p><a>Diane Sender</a> of Compass holds the listing. </p>
<p>Bush was fired from “Today” after an infamous tape surfaced of him <a>engaging in crude talk</a> with then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. He moved back to Los Angeles after the controversy. </p>
<a>was hired to host “Extra Extra,”</a> replacing Mario Lopez on an updated version of the entertainment show “Extra.” In September of that year, he and his estranged wife, Sydney Davis,
<a>finalized their divorce</a> after 20 years of marriage.
<a>he told Men’s Health</a> that, after his “Today” show exit, he drank heavily and
<a>was booted</a> from “Today” in 2017 over allegations of inappropriate behavior.
<p>Early last year on Dennis Quaid’s <a>“The Dennissance” podcast,</a> Bush <a>claimed to be</a> a much-changed man since his own very-public scandal unfolded. </p>
<p>“I’m a much nicer person. I’m much more curious about other people’s experiences,” he shared. “I only take the good out of it at this point.”</p>
<p>He also called the hot mike incident “such an ugly moment,” adding, “It’s humiliating, it’s embarrassing, it’s s – – tty. There’s no denying the moment is a terrible moment.”</p>

<h1> Netflix raising prices to offset programming costs, debt</h1>

<p>Consumers will have to shell out a little more dough if they want to Netflix and chill. The streaming giant is raising its US prices by 13 percent to 18 percent.</p>
<p>News of the hike, to take effect in March sent shares up 6.5 percent, to $354.64, on Tuesday as investors showed confidence in CEO Reed Hastings’ growth plan.</p>
<p>Under the price rise, Netflix’s most popular plan will see the largest hike, to $12.99 a month from $10.99, which is still lower than rival HBO, which charges $15 a month.</p>
<p>Netflix’s top-tier plan, which allows streaming on four screens in high definition, will increase to $15.99 from $13.99 a month, while the cost of its basic plan will rise to $8.99 from $7.99.</p>
<p>The hike, which Mahaney estimates could add $2.4 billion in quarterly revenue, comes as Netflix is facing increased costs for content as well as likely competition from Disney, ATT’s Warner Media, Amazon, and Apple.</p>
<p>As competition ramps up, the value of content is also on the rise. In 2018, Netflix spent more than $8 billion on content, and it expects to spend more than that this year.</p>
<p>Deep-pocketed rivals are not only jockeying to produce the most compelling original content, but they are also battling to secure the rights to reruns of popular shows.</p>
