<h1> Creative Tings: How 3 Singaporean sisters found success supporting each other </h1>
<div> <p>A shared love for design, influenced by their artist father, spurred Pamela, Rebecca and Renee Ting to find their own artistic niche with Scene Shang, Beyond The Vines and the Singapore Art Book Fair. Yes, they’re related.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Melissa Stewart </a> </div> </div>
<p>It is mid-afternoon and the Ting sisters are gathered at Scene Shang’s flagship store on Beach Road, the furniture store owned by eldest sister Pamela Ting. It’s the first photoshoot they’ve had together in a while.</p>
<p>In the creative space, the Ting sisters are known for their own individual pursuits. “But I don’t think many people know that we’re related,” said Rebecca.</p>

<p>As for Renee, her love for books stemmed from a novel given to her by Pamela. “It was Lighthousekeeping by Jeanette Winterson. Over time, this love for books evolved into a love for art books,” the 29-year-old shared.</p>
<p>Through the Singapore Art Book Fair, Renee hopes to grow the market for art books in Singapore and Asia, as well as support local artists.</p>
<p>Life may have taken the Tings on different paths, but the trio share an unbreakable bond that has seen them through childhood and adulthood. “We are sisters by chance, but we are friends by choice,” said Rebecca, as her sisters nod in unison.</p>

<p>SISTERHOOD THROUGH THE YEARS</p>
<p>Renee adds that the three of them were not the typical “girly girls” growing up. “We were always the loudest table in the restaurant,” she laughed.</p>
<p>“At some point, we made a conscious decision to get to know one another for who we are, as opposed to people we just see every day," Renee elaborated. </p>

<p>When Rebecca first launched Beyond The Vines with her husband, she recalls turning to elder sister Pamela for help and advice. </p>
<p>Pamela describes having a “fluid exchange” of help and advice between her sisters. “For example, if I need contacts in the art industry, I can easily go to Renee for help.”</p>
<p>"Beyond support, there’s also a lot of respect between us,” Renee added. “We’re all so individualistic and independent, and we respect that the other person knows what they’re doing and if anything, we’re here for them.”</p>
<blockquote> <p>Beyond support, there’s also a lot of respect between us. We’re all so individualistic and independent, and we respect that the other person knows what they’re doing and if anything, we’re here for them. </p> </blockquote>
<p>A SAFE SPACE WITH ONE ANOTHER </p>
<p>Despite managing their own busy schedules, the sisters still manage to find time for each other. “We are quite spontaneous, we don’t really plan out dates to meet,” Pamela shared.</p>
<p>Renee added: “Sometimes, I’ll invite them over to play with my cats, or we would have dinner at Becky’s and play with her kids.”</p>
<p>Above all else, there’s a strong sense of admiration the sisters have for each other. “Pam takes everything in great stride, she always seems very unfazed. She really is our da jie, who watches out for us,” said Renee on her eldest sister.</p>
<p>She continued: “For Becky, I’m always amazed at how she excels in everything. Even more so because she’s a mother of two kids on top of running her business.”</p>
<p>“I feel the same about Ren and Pam,” Rebecca added. “They are each very strong women. In our private lives, we know what each of us has gone through. But there’s so much resilience in them.”</p>
<p>Pamela shares that each of her sisters “epitomises what a woman should be”. “They are both very independent with their own thinking, but there’s still so much respect in how they treat others,” she said.</p>
<p>Evidently, the sisters share a unique bond which Rebecca says they "don't take for granted". Having found success in their chosen career paths, we ask the sisters if they would one day come together to start something as a trio. </p>
<p>“We thought about it, but I instinctively say no. But you never know! Never say never,” Pamela answered. “I feel like we’re too much alike, and too different at the same time,” Renee chipped in.</p>
<p>For now, the Tings are content with the current state of their relationship. As Pamela shared, "I think we are good supporting each other with our own things. When we come together, we share our different experiences and we learn from them.”</p>
<p>And as female business leaders, the Tings believe in the importance of "creating a space for support" for fellow women entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>What her sisters have done with their respective businesses is something Rebecca says she finds very inspiring. </p>

<h1> Sex And The City actor Chris Noth denies sexual assault accusations </h1>
<div> <p>Two women told the Hollywood Reporter that Noth's return in the series sequel, And Just Like That, had triggered memories of their experiences with him years ago.</p> </div>
<p>Sex And The City actor Chris Noth denied sexual assault accusations reported by the Hollywood Reporter on Thursday (Dec 16), saying his encounters with two women in 2004 and 2015 were consensual.</p>
<p>Noth plays the romantic partner Mr Big, or Big, in the HBO television series and its new sequel And Just Like That.</p>
<p>Exercise bike company Peloton on Thursday removed a social media ad it had released earlier this week featuring Noth's character.</p>
<p>It said in a statement it was previously unaware of the accusations against Noth and said that "every single sexual assault accusation must be taken seriously".</p>
<p>Noth issued his statement in response to the Hollywood Reporter story in which two women, using pseudonyms, described sexual incidents with him in Los Angeles and New York in 2004 and 2015.</p>
<p>"It’s difficult not to question the timing of these stories coming out. I don’t know for certain why they are surfacing now, but I do know this: I did not assault these women," he added.</p>
<p>Both women told the Hollywood Reporter that Noth's return to the Sex And The City franchise had triggered memories of their experiences with him years ago.</p>
<p>Reuters could not reach the two women for comment.</p>
<p>One, using the name Zoe, said she was 22 when she met Noth while working for a company in 2004 where celebrities had business. She said he invited her to the pool at his apartment building and later kissed her and had sex with her against her will.</p>
<p>The other woman, using the name Lily, was a server at a New York nightclub where Noth asked her on a date in 2015. She said she later went with him to his apartment where they had sex but she left feeling "totally violated".</p>
<p>Neither encounter was reported to police at the time.</p>
<p>Noth, 67, is best known for playing the on and off romantic interest of Sarah Jessica Parker's writer character Carrie Bradshaw in the Sex And The City TV series and movie.</p>
<p>In And Just Like That..., which premiered on HBO Max last week (HBO Go in Singapore), the first episode finds Mr Big happily married to Bradshaw but (spoiler alert) dying of a heart attack while exercising on a Peloton bike.</p>
<p>Scores of men in entertainment, politics and business have been accused of sexual misconduct in recent years following the rise of the #MeToo movement in 2017.</p>

<h1> 3 Singapore women launch pre-loved kids' clothing platform </h1>
<div> <p>New online marketplace PreLouLou lets parents who care about sustainability buy and sell pre-loved and past-season designer clothes for children – no haggling necessary.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Celine Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>Hands up if you’ve tried to sell something – whether it’s a brand new jar of moisturiser, a piece of furniture, a maternity dress or baby shoes your kid never wore – on local resale platforms such as Carousell. </p>
<p>And then you ended up annoyed, frustrated and doing way more work than you intended to, or have time for.</p>
<p>Accepted items will be listed within 10 days, and if they’re sold, the seller will receive 60 per cent of the selling price within 28 working days of the item being shipped (and not returned).</p>
<p>The question, though, is whether local parents are willing to pay for second-hand clothes for their precious little ones. </p>
<p>This is not lost on many young parents, who are increasingly conscious of their part in the mind-boggling and unsustainable practice of buying throwaway kids’ clothes and products.</p>
<p>And the founders of PreLouLou are hoping the winds of change and the current burgeoning resale market will help their brand and their cause. </p>
<p>"I think the greater challenge isn’t setting up the business, but getting our parent community in Singapore to embrace buying pre-loved and trusting our platform to deliver both quality and affordability for their children," said Wang.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Women </a> </p> <h5> From bin to skin: Meet the Singaporean who makes face masks from food waste </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> From bin to skin: Meet the Singaporean who makes face masks from food waste </h1>
<p>Didi Gan’s quest for an all-natural, non-toxic N95 mask and home disinfecting solutions led her to intercept heaps of nut waste on their way to landfills. CNA Women speaks to her in this first instalment of our women in sustainability series.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Annie Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>How can we better protect ourselves and the ecosystem?</p>
<p>The biomedical graduate from the University of Melbourne looked at the pile of nut shells on her dining table and had a moment of inspiration. What if food waste could be transformed into a powerful yet gentle antimicrobial solution?</p>
<p>With that, Gan founded NE Innovations, leaving her job as a managing director of a textile mill in Malaysia. </p>
<p>Six months later, she launched the first all-natural N95 and CE-certified mask. More than a year later, she launched a disinfecting solution for surfaces and hands. </p>
<p>These were formulated with cashew nut waste and other food-grade ingredients.</p>
<p>TRANSFORMING TRASH INTO REUSABLE MASKS</p>
<p>The 34-year-old remembers how she spent her childhood at her family’s melon seed shop in Chinatown, which has since closed. Every afternoon after school, she would mould “cakes” out of nut waste. </p>
<p>Little did she imagine that this childhood game would one day inspire her to create a pandemic solution. </p>
<p>Fast forward to early 2020 when the virus was raging in Wuhan: Gan began searching for natural antimicrobial solutions for use in masks. </p>
<p>She couldn’t find any. Instead, she found that many manufacturers use toxic heavy metals to line masks.</p>
<p>Determined to create her own natural and safe solution, Gan began to experiment with food waste, including melon seed waste, orange peels and durian husks for antimicrobial properties. </p>
<p>Based on her research, she developed an edible, non-toxic molecular coating known as VIKANG99.</p>
<p>“It forms a chemical structure that continually gives out reactive oxygen species, a natural occurring phenomenon in our body cells. This inactivates bacteria and viruses by destroying their cell walls,” she explained. </p>
<p>On how she sourced for sustainable ingredients, Gan said she buys cashew nut waste from Intersnack, a cashew nut processing company.</p>
<p>“Intersnack produces 100,000 metric tonnes of cashew nuts each year, which generates 2,500 metric tonnes of waste. This would otherwise end up in landfills or be incinerated. Why not use it to make something powerful against COVID-19?”</p>
<p>The iron from soya beans and chitosan from crab shells are sourced from China.</p>
<p>It took her six months and four formula tweaks to get her mask N95-certified, meaning it meets the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health standard of filtering at least 95 per cent of airborne particles. </p>
<p>In addition, it is also CE-certified, meaning the product complies with EU requirements for medical face masks. Costing between S$300,000 and S$400,000, RD was so expensive that Gan did not draw a salary for four months.</p>
<p>Finally, in August 2020, the Vi-MASK (from S$15.90) was launched. The three-layer reusable mask protects its wearer against 99 per cent of viruses and bacteria for up to 30 washes. </p>
<p>Its first layer is fortified with VIKANG99 antimicrobial technology to inactivate the virus upon contact. The second layer filters virus, bacteria, dust, pollen and allergens like a surgical mask. </p>
<p>They are even exported as far as German towns Mistelgau and Bad Berneck, located in Bayreuth.</p>
<p>Gan was also motivated by her five-year-old daughter Emma to develop a gentle, non-toxic and baby-safe hand sanitiser. “My daughter has bad eczema, and cries when she has to use toxic alcohol sanitisers in school,” Gan said.</p>
<p>To ensure the disinfectant is gentle on the ecosystem, Gan even conducted her own home experiments, spraying it on her houseplants and into her fishbowl to ensure that it would not harm living organisms. </p>
<p>The product has been used at the Singapore Zoo, River Safari and Night Safari to coat high touchpoint areas.</p>
<p>“This product can be sprayed directly on food by the retailer or consumers, to continuously deactivate the virus for 24 to 48 hours,” she said. </p>
<p>To upcycle more food waste, Gan is also working with Insectta, a local black soldier fly farm which uses the insect to convert food waste into chitosan, a key ingredient in her antimicrobial solutions. </p>
<p>Why is sustainability such a big part of Gan’s pandemic solutions? </p>
<p>“You see the world change over the years and you really worry for your kids,” said the mother-of-two. “In 30 years, will they even see a blue sky? Will they have fruits to eat? Will there still be fishes in the ocean?” </p>
<p>“I believe it will make a difference if people use the right things in the right amount, even when it comes to COVID-19 solutions and food waste. If we each play our part, our kids will have a better, cleaner and happier future,” she said.</p>

<h1> What's the secret to living longer? Take it from someone who just turned 80 </h1>
<div> <p>A health writer who has hit a birthday milestone shares what she's learnt over the years about the things that might help us live longer.</p> </div>
<p>When a 50-ish woman at my Y learned that I was about to turn 80, she exclaimed, “80 is the new 60, and you set a great example for the rest of us!”</p>
<p>At least, I’m in good company:</p>
<p>— Dr Anthony Fauci, national infectious disease guru, is five months my senior, sharp as a tack even under withering political fire;</p>
<p>— Nancy Pelosi, 81-year-old Speaker of the House, also stands up well against fierce opposition;</p>
<p>— Anthony Hopkins, 83, Oscar winner for The Silence of the Lambs and a frequent nominee, won again this year for The Father;</p>
<p>— Morgan Freeman, also 83, acts with a voice of distinction bested only by his formidable talent. He has four upcoming movies and a TV series.</p>
<p>— Bernie Sanders, former presidential hopeful who will be 80 in September, remains a force to be reckoned with in the US Senate;</p>
<p>— Paul Simon, a month younger than Mr Sanders, has won 12 Grammys as a singer and songwriter in a now six-decade career. He recently sold his songwriting catalog to Sony for around US$250 million.</p>
<p>The list goes on. As my late husband, who didn’t make it to that milestone, would have said, “80 – not a record, but not a bad average.”</p>
<p>The cohort of Americans who have lived for eight or more decades is rising steadily and projected to grow faster than the cohort of youngsters under 18 for at least the next 40 years.</p>
<p>Assuming most people would opt for a long and fulfilling life, nature permitting, what does this take? What accounts for the growing number of octogenarians and beyond who are accomplished and still accomplishing?</p>
<p>Having been raised to save, all my life I’ve shopped sales and bargains and parlayed the monetary rewards into scholarships for deserving students and fabulous nature, hiking and cycling trips for me, family and friends.</p>
<p>If and when I finally retire, I’d like to work as a volunteer with young children. They lighten my step, warm my heart and enrich my soul. Their joie de vivre and innate curiosity foster hope that the world of the future will be a better one.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Living longer? Here’s what working for 60 years should look like </h1>
<div> <p>As Singaporeans lead longer lives and face an age of disruption, we need a new work paradigm, say two observers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tomas Klvana </a> <a> Michael Netzley </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Human capital has become a hot topic with Singapore proudly earning the top spot in the World Bank’s <a>Human Capital Index</a> (HCI).</p>
<p>Scoring 0.88, this top ranking means that a child born today can be expected to achieve 88 per cent of her human capital potential by the age of 18. This, in turn, is read as an indicator of future prosperity. </p>
<p>Considering that Singapore’s journey began only 53 years ago, achieving the top spot is nothing short of remarkable.</p>
<p>Singaporeans especially are living longer lives, <a>the third longest</a> in the world, according to a recent World Health Organisation report.</p>
<p>In this context, can it be that people might work until their 70s or even 80s?</p>
<p>A 60-year working career is looming large, yet we are not quite ready.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Here’s what Singapore’s human capital index in a world of disruption should look like, a commentary</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: My generation has a fear of missing out - on a disrupted future, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>According to authors of The 100-year Life, Professors Lynda Gratton and Andrew Scott, and their research published in MIT Sloan Management Review: </p>
<p>Given the rapid progress in genetics, these are only conservative estimates.</p>
<p>EVERYONE AS AN ENTREPRENEUR</p>
<p>What changes do we need to make in order to succeed in the radically new career paradigm? Two decisive elements are involved.</p>
<p>First, our societies must reexamine the prevailing attitude towards ageing, get rid of the dead weight of ageism and related prejudices.</p>
<p>We will also need help from governments and corporations, as the new framework for working life will get refashioned. Meanwhile, let’s start with ourselves.</p>
<p>In our working life, we will be expected to have a more flexible outlook and expectations. Gone are the days of working for one company for several decades.</p>
<p>Competitive global markets and the onwards rush of scientific discovery will soon – by way of artificial intelligence, robotics, microbiology and communication – make it close to impossible to predict what work will look like in 10, 20 or 30 years.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Internet, long distance conferencing, webinars and online courses make this easier for nearly everyone and function as great levelers of erstwhile structural disadvantages.</p>
<p>What kinds of skills should we acquire? In a multigenerational workforce, self-awareness and emotional intelligence (EQ) would be especially prized, leading to success in the working context easily encompassing four or five generations.</p>
<p>Physical exercise, sleep and a healthy diet will be the three pillars undergirding the edifice of productivity, especially in the last decades of our job exertion.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Head out and enjoy Singapore's nature spots, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>STAY TUNED-IN, DON’T DISENGAGE</p>
<p>One additional trick to ignite the spark in later years is about being present not just physically, but also mentally. The key that unlocks the door is openness to outside influences.</p>
<p>Senior employees should resist a temptation to “give up on the world”. Staying tuned-in will help us eventually to keep and foster our creative impulses into older age.</p>
<p>Naturally we will not be able to do all of this on our own. Governments play a role too. They must pay close attention to demands of the job market in order to reform and fine-tune educational systems.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Time for Singapore universities to switch gears, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>Changes must emphasise lifelong learning, developing self-awareness and emotional intelligence, fostering adaptability, and developing a sense of mastery, creativity and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>While specific training offered through SkillsFuture will most certainly help and play a critical role, these broader life capabilities will likely prove to be the more important tools that ageing workers will need. </p>
<p>In parallel, governments can also help corporations with incentives and structures for mental and cognitive agility diagnostics and training, for improving physical fitness, and promoting healthy nutrition.</p>
<p>Last but not least, public policies will be needed to combat job market ageism, foster a multigenerational workforce, improve emotional intelligence, and offer adult development that exchanges insights between generations.</p>
<p>Older workers can bring their wisdom to decision making, for example, while younger workers can become impactful allies through reverse mentoring. </p>
<h3><a>READ: People ready to retire later but preparing older workers will require more than reskilling, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>CUSTOM-MADE LIFE, CUSTOM-MADE WORLD OF WORK </p>
<p>Employers need not wait for the Government. They are in many ways best positioned to immediately lead and demonstrate a shifting mindset.</p>
<p>A good beginning might be refitting workplaces to the needs of ageing workers – and there are already salutary examples to follow, such as the ergonomic adjustments BMW has implemented in its plant in the German state of Bavaria.</p>
<p>By redesigning workspaces, in cooperation with ageing workers, BMW aims to accommodate ageing workers and increase productivity.</p>
<p>Additionally, Chief Human Resources Officers should pay attention to the new trend in which ageing workers might be part time employees, project workers, gig workers, or even full-time workers into their 70s or even 80s.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Tricky human resource questions best dealt with facts instead of feelings, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>With the rise of digital technology, our lives have increasingly abandoned once proven templates and taken on a more custom-made mode, reflecting our unique needs, desires and abilities.</p>
<p>The world of work will have to catch up to this nimbleness and flexibility. These changes are on such a large scale that no one societal pillar will be able to entirely solve the problem. </p>
<p>Exciting times are around the corner.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Women </a> </p> <h5> Medical checks women need in their 20s, 30s, 40s to nip health issues in the bud </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Medical checks women need in their 20s, 30s, 40s to nip health issues in the bud </h1>
<div> <p>The best defence for your health is regular screening. Here's a look at the yearly checks you should go for.</p> <p>In partnership with UOB.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>You schedule medical appointments for your loved ones, accompany them to said appointments and make sure they take their medicine in a timely manner. </p>
<p>As adept as many women are at taking care of others, there is one important area that has become a blind spot – your very own health. Take, for instance, health checks. How long have you been postponing yours? </p>
<p>To give you a better idea what those yearly contributions of blood, urine and other bodily fluids are for, CNA Lifestyle checks in with the doctors. </p>
<p>Here’s a look at the tests you need, depending on your age. </p>
<p>There’s another reason why the breast scans aren’t quite necessary at this stage: “When a young woman with no personal health insurance is found to have such lumps, she will have problems finding insurance coverage for her breasts,” said Dr Lee. </p>
<p>“My advice for any women is for them to have their personal health insurance first before contemplating breast screening.”</p>
<p>TESTS YOU'LL NEED IN YOUR 20S</p>
<p>Blood test: The diabetes and hyperlipidaemia that Dr Chan mentioned can be screened out with a simple blood test. Here are the healthy numbers you should be aiming for when it comes to your post-fasting blood glucose and cholesterol levels:</p>
<li>Glucose level: Below 6.1 mmol/L (prediabetic: 6.1 mmol/L to 6.9 mmol/L; diabetic: 7 mmol/L or higher)</li>
<li>Total cholesterol: 200 mg/dL or below</li>
<li>Triglycerides: Less than 149 mg/dL</li>
<li>LDL (bad) cholesterol: Less than 100 mg/dL</li>
<li>HDL (good) cholesterol: 50 mg/dL or higher</li>
<p>Furthermore, a blood test can screen for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and is encouraged in the following scenarios, advised Dr Susan Logan, a senior consultant at National University Hospital’s Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology:</p>
<ul><li>You've had a new partner in the past three months </li> <li>You've had more than a partner within 12 months </li> <li>You did not use barrier protection</li> <li>You have a previous history of STI</li> </ul>
<p>Blood pressure test: This screens for hypertension; a healthy reading is below 130/80mmHg.</p>
<p>Not only that, it can also screen out fungal or bacterial infections, said Dr Koh.</p>
<p>Urine test: This tests for blood, protein and infection, said Dr Pang. “It can sometimes pick up conditions such as kidney stones and kidney problems that cause leaking protein.” </p>
<p>Unusual thyroid levels can cause “very light or very heavy menstrual flow, very irregular periods, or absent menstrual periods”, she said. Doctors can then determine if there is a need to test for further gynaecological problems like fibroids.</p>
<ul><li>Normal: 0.5 to 4.1 mU/L</li> <li>Low: Lower than 0.5 mU/L</li> <li>High: Higher than 4.1 mU/L</li> </ul>
<p>If you're worried about the cost of these tests, there are ways to get around it. The UOB Lady's Savings Account, for instance, offers complimentary health screening. </p>
<p>It also provides free cancer coverage of up to S$200,000 for six female cancers, including breast, cervix, uterus, fallopian tube, vagina/vulva and ovary. </p>
<p>The 30s are the reproductive years, so the health checks will often be about maximising fertility, said Dr Logan, who is also a co-lead for Women's Health at Alexandra Hospital. </p>
<p>While you may be in a committed relationship now, it doesn't hurt to test for STIs either. Herpes, for instance, is life-threatening to newborns; gonorrhoea can cause miscarriages and preterm labour. </p>
<p>To guard against cervical cancer, you may want to consider an HPV test in addition to a Pap smear for more thorough screening against cervical cancer. </p>

<p>HPV test: While the Pap smear detects abnormal cells that could turn into cervical cancer, the HPV test can tell the presence of two strains of HPV, which is responsible for about 70 per cent of cervical cancer cases. </p>
<p>Liver function test: Get yourself tested if there are symptoms such as jaundice or risks like congenital Hepatitis B, said Dr Logan.</p>
<p>Thyroid test: See In Your 20s.</p>
<p>Numbers that shouldn’t rise (weight, cholesterol and glucose levels, blood pressure, etc) will start to climb and can lead to issues such as diabetes and hypertension.</p>
<p>Due to the prolonged exposure to oestrogen, women in this age group are also at a higher risk of breast cancer. According to a 2010 study on Singaporean women, the highest rates are reported between the ages of 45 and 49.</p>
<p>Thyroid checks are prudent to get as well. Symptoms that you think are related to impending menopause may be caused by a thyroid disorder instead. In fact, the condition is often diagnosed between the ages of 45 and 55, according to Mayo Clinic.</p>
<p>TESTS YOU'LL NEED IN YOUR 40S</p>
<p>Blood test: See In Your 20s. </p>
<p>Pap smear: See In Your 20s. </p>
<p>Mammogram: In addition to regular breast self-examination, you should also schedule yearly mammograms once you reach 40. “Breast cancer is the No 1 female cancer, so this is an important screening test for women,” said Dr Koh. </p>
<p>Thyroid ultrasound: Other than the thyroid function test (a blood test really), there is also a thyroid ultrasound scan that can catch what the blood test misses, said Dr Koh.</p>
<p>HPV test:See In Your 30s.</p>
<p>Pelvic ultrasound: Uterine and ovarian growths, including fibroids, ovarian cysts and cancer, are fairly common, said Dr Koh. “The ultrasound scan provides a visual overview to exclude such pathologies.”</p>
<p>Bone density test: Osteoporosis leading to fractures is a common cause of disability and death later in life, cautioned Dr Koh. “It is important to pre-empt the situation by doing a bone density test.”</p>
<p>Scans are usually done on the hip and spine as these areas are the most likely to fracture. According to the World Health Organization, the results are reported in T-scores – the higher, the better.</p>
<ul><li>Normal: -1.0 or above</li> <li>Low bone density: -1.0 and -2.5</li> <li>You have osteoporosis: -2.5 or below</li> </ul>
<p>Your doctor can advise you on further tests or actions to take should your test or scan results show abnormalities.</p>
