<div><div><p>On its last day of business in 2021, the Senate confirmed dozens of President Biden’s judicial nominees waiting to get to work.</p></div></div>
<p>Not a single one of them went to the local D.C. courts — despite the fact that the D.C. Superior Court and Court of Appeals are dealing with an unprecedented 17 judicial vacancies, roughly one-fourth of all the courts’ judicial seats.</p>
<div><div><p>In response, the local courts are issuing an urgent call to action.</p></div></div>
<p>“This has led to a long-standing vacancy crisis within the local D.C. Court System, regardless of which party controls the Senate, and we have now reached a point in which we find it necessary to sound the alarm,” Buchanan said.</p>

<b> </b>Senators are often far more focused on confirming federal judges and other nominees within the president’s administration, she said.

<div><div><p>Allen stressed that the challenges created by the vacancies aren’t just limited to criminal cases; other judicial matters involving families, estates and marriages are also affected.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A criminal judge might be handling a family court calendar — this problem keeps escalating,” Perry said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Perry applauded Norton’s legislation, noting its similarity to how local D.C. legislation can be passively approved by Congress if there is no action after 30 working days.</p></div></div>
<a>nominee</a> Loren L. AliKhan, the D.C. solicitor general, described the backlog as “the first-, second-, third- and fourth-biggest problem facing the District.”
<div><div><p>“I have absolutely no faith that Joe Biden’s radical far-left nominees will uphold the rule of law,” Scott said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In closing out his statement, Buchanan urged the Senate to act “immediately” to confirm the pending D.C. judicial nominees upon returning to Washington in the new year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Please,” he wrote. “The time to act is now.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Meagan Flynn</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022|Updated January 4, 2022 at 5:21 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was cold,” he said in an interview around 10 a.m. Tuesday about his overnight experience being stranded on the interstate. “It was very cold.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Some people are running out of gas,” Kaine said Tuesday morning. “If you run out of gas, then what do you do as a family?”</p></div></div>
<p>Officials said later in the day that they hoped I-95 would be cleared and open again by Tuesday night and that they had been sending emergency crews to try to reach still-stranded motorists, while pledging a full investigation of what went wrong.</p>
<div><div><p>Kaine said he left Richmond at around 1 p.m. Monday for a pressing voting rights meeting later that day with other lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol, believing he had plenty of time. The commute typically took him two hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This time, it would take him nearly 27 hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With multiple senators absent,<b> </b>the Senate delayed roll call votes on Monday, and on Tuesday afternoon decided to delay votes again until Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<p>“The only nourishment I had — if you count it as nourishment — is two cups of coffee and a Dr Pepper,” Kaine said. “I’ll deal with hunger rather than eat a lot of food and have to worry about bathrooms.”</p>
<div><p><span>Schumer says Senate will vote by Jan. 17 on changing rules if GOP continues to block voting rights legislation</span></p></div>
<p>Overnight, as temperatures dipped below freezing, Kaine said he would turn the engine on for 10 minutes or so to heat up the car, then turn it off for an hour to conserve fuel. He tilted his head back and tried to sleep in the driver-side seat.</p>
<div><div><p>It didn’t work, at least not for long.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I would nap for 15 or 20 minutes — usually I’d wake up because I got too cold,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine accepted one and saved it for later. At 10 a.m., he said he was planning to peel it momentarily.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine said he talked to Northam mainly to ask what people were supposed to do if they ran out of gas or needed help. Kaine had been able to refuel in Fredericksburg but feared that others might be in more dire situations.</p></div></div>
<p>“That was one of the things I wanted to find out. How should we let people know if they need help?” He repeated the phone number that Northam and VDOT have been encouraging motorists to call if they’re in trouble: 1-800-FOR-ROAD.</p>
<div><div><p>He was then inching toward exit 136 near the Stafford airport, still waiting to hear the state’s outlook on the unfathomable traffic jam, trying to decide whether to get off the road.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ultimately, he found his way off the interstate onto Highway 1, which was also still clogged with cars.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At 3:45, he finally arrived on Capitol grounds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t always have a feeling of joy when I see the Capitol,” Kaine told reporters upon arriving, “but I did today.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>I-95 reopens in Virginia after winter storm forced closure that stranded motorists </h1></div>
<h2>Highway crews had spent much of the day towing dozens of vehicles that had been abandoned or run out of gas</h2>

<div><div><p>They missed a family funeral in New York and subsisted on Diet Dr Pepper, cheese crackers and gingersnap cookies while their gas tank neared empty.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“That is something that we will look at,” Parker said. “We have to weigh that with the fact that people want to get to where they want to get to, and we can’t necessarily predict the outcome of each storm.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>A state police spokeswoman said the agency had received no reports of deaths or injuries as a result of the massive backups.</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C. region races to restore power, dig out icy roads a day after big snowstorm</p></div>
<div><div><p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said Tuesday that emergency crews were using highway express lanes to reach stranded motorists and get them to warming shelters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said he had the National Guard on standby but had not deployed it because the challenge was in reaching vehicles, not a lack of personnel or equipment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Analysis: Here's what made Monday's snowstorm so severe</p></div>
<div><div><p>But some motorists said they aren’t to blame for what they saw as government officials’ poor planning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m not angry at the snow,” Schorr said. “I’m just upset at the way they handled it.”</p></div></div>
<p>Most frustrating, she said, was the lack of communication from state and local officials as she and her husband took turns catnapping overnight in their Mazda. Finally, on Tuesday morning, they received a push alert on their phones from Virginia.</p>
<div><div><p>“It was a catastrophe for people,” he said. “Our road guys are first-rate, and I’ve never heard of anything quite like this occurring in Virginia.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It seems like they weren’t taking it seriously,” she said. “It seems like they didn’t think it was the emergency that it was.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine said he left Richmond about 1 p.m. Monday for a voting-rights meeting later that day. Traffic would stop for five or six hours, then move slowly for a time, and stop again.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overnight, stranded in below-freezing temperatures, he said he would heat the car as much as he could, then turn the engine off for an hour to conserve fuel while he tried to sleep.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overnight, he said, a man traveling with his family from Florida back home to Connecticut walked car-to-car, delivering souvenir Florida oranges to hungry people who hadn’t eaten in hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was a lot of good neighborly spirit last night,” he said, later arriving at the Capitol following a 27-hour commute.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Photos of the snowstorm that blanketed the D.C. region</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Two chicks, one truck,” Rusher said. “We’re hard to miss.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They encouraged stranded motorists to approach other tractor-trailer drivers, who carry food and water for long hauls.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said she directed her mother to leave at Exit 140 and head to Stafford Hospital, where she eventually spent the night before taking a bus to an emergency shelter at Stafford High School.</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C.-area forecast: Sunshine bursts back today before another chance of snow Thursday night</p></div>
<div><div><p>Then they decided they would push the trees out of the way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was kind of like a survival mode,” Hildenbrand said. “We just felt: ’I need to get off this highway.’”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After much effort, the men said they managed to shove the trees far enough apart that their four-wheel-drive truck made it over at least a foot of snow and ice.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Sydney Page</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 8:19 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 9:05 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Casey Holihan and her husband, John Noe, had been stranded on Interstate 95 in Virginia for about 16 hours when they got an idea.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The couple spotted a Schmidt Baking Company truck just a few cars ahead of them about 9 a.m. Tuesday. At that point, they estimated, it had been approximately 37 hours since they had last eaten.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were starving,” said Holihan, 23, who at the time was at a standstill near Quantico. “People around us were very much struggling as well. We could hear kids crying.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They reached the customer service line and left their phone number with a representative.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I didn’t think it would actually work,” Holihan said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>I-95 partially reopens in Virginia after winter storm forced closure that stranded motorists</p></div>
<div><div><p>What happened next stunned her: Just 20 minutes later, Chuck Paterakis, one of the owners of HS Bakery, which operates Schmidt Baking Company, called the couple directly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He advised them to go to the truck, then instructed the driver to offer up two products — one package of rolls and one loaf of bread — to any person who wanted them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was an easy decision,” Paterakis said. If he had been stuck out there on the road with no food, he added, “I would want someone to offer their products.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The couple was traveling south on I-95, heading from their home in Ellicott City, Md., to visit Noe’s family in Newport, N.C.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Along with the truck driver, Ron Hill, Holihan and Noe started grabbing loaves of bread off the truck and <a>distributing them to the surrounding vehicles</a>. Others swiftly joined their efforts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We started going door to door and we got to help a lot of people,” Holihan said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For about an hour, they walked gingerly along the ice-slicked roads and handed out about 300 packages of bread.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Some people said this was a saving grace for them,” Holihan said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To them, Paterakis’s generous gesture was the most memorable part of an otherwise awful experience.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He didn’t have to help us. He could have made a profit off that bread,” Holihan said. “It was really heartwarming.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since the start of the <a>coronavirus</a> pandemic in March 2020, he added, the company has donated close to 3 million loaves of bread to people in need in the Baltimore-Washington area.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My father and mother taught us how to work hard and give back to the community,” he said. “My parents would be very proud.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although it was a seemingly endless, mostly miserable road trip, connecting with others who were also stranded and bringing them sliced bread from the back of a truck were silver linings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Everyone was so thankful,” Holihan said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>We needed a break from cancer. So we drove an RV across the country and learned some unexpected things.</a></p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Natanson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 6:47 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>At about 8 a.m. Tuesday morning, Safwan Aziz and John Hildenbrand hit their breaking points.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The problem was that two massive trees had fallen during the snowstorm, blocking the welders’ way out. Each one easily weighed several hundred pounds, the men said. They were laden with heavy snow and frozen to the ground.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Now, Aziz and Hildenbrand decided, they would push the trees out of the way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was kind of like a survival mode,” Hildenbrand said. “We just felt: ‘I need to get off this highway.’ ”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just wanted,” Aziz said, “to get the hell away from that road.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sen. Tim Kaine was stranded on I-95 for nearly 27 hours</p></div>
<div><div><p>Knocking on strangers’ car windows in the predawn darkness, Hildenbrand and Aziz felt the stirrings of an odd sense of community.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One man darted into his car, produced several cans of Pepsi and cut off their tops to make impromptu mugs. He filled them with Aziz and Hildenbrand’s coffee and began handing them out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was a little later, with the sun high in the sky, that the two men had the same crazy idea about the trees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As they took Exit 140, Aziz noticed a man sitting in a truck labeled VDOT, for Virginia Department of Transportation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He was just sitting there in his car all warm and cozy, didn’t look like he had a care or concern about all the miles of traffic he was looking at,” Aziz said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite their lack of sleep, the two men decided to head straight for their original destination in South Carolina.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aziz felt grateful for the cold beer, the good food and the fact he wasn’t driving anymore. And for one extra thing, too.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s a good thing John and I are such good friends, because it should be illegal to have to spend 36 hours” trapped in a car with another man, Aziz said. “A good looking-woman? Maybe. But a man? No way.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said Tuesday that emergency crews were using highway express lanes to reach stranded motorists and get them to warming shelters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said he had the National Guard on standby but had not deployed it because the challenge was in reaching vehicles, not a lack of personnel or equipment.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“I’m not angry at the snow,” Schorr said. “I’m just upset at the way they handled it.”</p></div></div>
<p>Most frustrating, she said, was the lack of communication from state and local officials as she and her husband took turns catnapping overnight in their Mazda. Finally, on Tuesday morning, they received a push alert on their phones from Virginia.</p>
<div><div><p>“It was a catastrophe for people,” he said. “Our road guys are first-rate, and I’ve never heard of anything quite like this occurring in Virginia.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It seems like they weren’t taking it seriously,” she said. “It seems like they didn’t think it was the emergency that it was.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine said he left Richmond about 1 p.m. Monday for a voting-rights meeting later that day. Traffic would stop for five or six hours, then move slowly for a time, and stop again.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overnight, stranded in below-freezing temperatures, he said he would heat the car as much as he could, then turn the engine off for an hour to conserve fuel while he tried to sleep.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I would nap for 15 or 20 minutes — usually I’d wake up because I got too cold,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overnight, he said, a man traveling with his family from Florida back home to Connecticut walked car-to-car, delivering souvenir Florida oranges to hungry people who hadn’t eaten in hours.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Meagan Flynn</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022|Updated January 4, 2022 at 5:21 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was cold,” he said in an interview around 10 a.m. Tuesday about his overnight experience being stranded on the interstate. “It was very cold.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Some people are running out of gas,” Kaine said Tuesday morning. “If you run out of gas, then what do you do as a family?”</p></div></div>
<p>Officials said later in the day that they hoped I-95 would be cleared and open again by Tuesday night and that they had been sending emergency crews to try to reach still-stranded motorists, while pledging a full investigation of what went wrong.</p>
<div><div><p>Kaine said he left Richmond at around 1 p.m. Monday for a pressing voting rights meeting later that day with other lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol, believing he had plenty of time. The commute typically took him two hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This time, it would take him nearly 27 hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With multiple senators absent,<b> </b>the Senate delayed roll call votes on Monday, and on Tuesday afternoon decided to delay votes again until Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<p>“The only nourishment I had — if you count it as nourishment — is two cups of coffee and a Dr Pepper,” Kaine said. “I’ll deal with hunger rather than eat a lot of food and have to worry about bathrooms.”</p>
<div><p><span>Schumer says Senate will vote by Jan. 17 on changing rules if GOP continues to block voting rights legislation</span></p></div>
<p>Overnight, as temperatures dipped below freezing, Kaine said he would turn the engine on for 10 minutes or so to heat up the car, then turn it off for an hour to conserve fuel. He tilted his head back and tried to sleep in the driver-side seat.</p>
<div><div><p>It didn’t work, at least not for long.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine accepted one and saved it for later. At 10 a.m., he said he was planning to peel it momentarily.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine said he talked to Northam mainly to ask what people were supposed to do if they ran out of gas or needed help. Kaine had been able to refuel in Fredericksburg but feared that others might be in more dire situations.</p></div></div>
<p>“That was one of the things I wanted to find out. How should we let people know if they need help?” He repeated the phone number that Northam and VDOT have been encouraging motorists to call if they’re in trouble: 1-800-FOR-ROAD.</p>
<div><div><p>He was then inching toward exit 136 near the Stafford airport, still waiting to hear the state’s outlook on the unfathomable traffic jam, trying to decide whether to get off the road.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ultimately, he found his way off the interstate onto Highway 1, which was also still clogged with cars.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At 3:45, he finally arrived on Capitol grounds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t always have a feeling of joy when I see the Capitol,” Kaine told reporters upon arriving, “but I did today.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Michael Laris</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 7:30 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 7:20 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The precise timeline of the meltdown was still coming into focus, but Virginia transportation and law enforcement officials offered this timeline of events that led to extensive backups on Interstate 95.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• 3 a.m. Monday: The winter storm begins as rain.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• 5 to 6 a.m. Monday: The storm switches to snow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• Morning Monday: State police troopers and wreckers start responding to stranded vehicles around the state.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• 8:20 a.m. Monday: State police receive their first calls about jackknifed tractor trailers on I-95 in the Fredericksburg area.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• 1 to 2 p.m. Monday: Snow stops in the area, and skies clear up. State officials are hopeful they can make progress moving vehicles but have little success.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• Afternoon Monday: A long queue forms as traffic inches along I-95.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• After 5 p.m.: VDOT says traffic was still flowing on I-95, though very slowly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• About 6 p.m. Monday: VDOT brings in more wreckers, tow trucks and personnel to the scene to move vehicles out of the way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• About midnight early Tuesday: VDOT says there is a “complete blockage” of traffic, with the limited movement coming to a halt as icing worsens.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• Early hours of Tuesday: VDOT crews and contractors tow vehicles off I-95.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• About 4 a.m. Tuesday: VDOT decides to close I-95 to help workers get cars off the highway so they can use heavy equipment to cut through up to four inches of ice that had frozen to the roadway in some areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• 8 a.m. Tuesday: VDOT formally shuts down the already blocked I-95 to keep other motorists from entering and to help others make their way off the highway.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• 7 p.m. Tuesday: Lanes of I-95 reopened.</p></div></div>
