<p>Singapore is not unique in this regard. Globally, groups claiming to represent the voices of men allegedly losing out to gender equality norms have been pushing back calls for greater protection of women’s rights.</p>
<p>To be clear, many men here in Singapore stand for gender equality. Those who oppose it are, fortunately, in the minority.</p>
<p>Based on the 2020 World Values Survey polling over 2,000 Singaporean respondents, only 21 per cent of men surveyed agreed a university education is more important for a boy than for a girl. </p>
<h2>DIFFERENCES IN ATTITUDES OVER GENDER EQUALITY</h2>
<p>Demographic and income differences can explain part of this split in attitudes. </p>
<p>Highly educated and younger respondents from affluent backgrounds were more likely to support gender equality compared to other demographic groups, the same survey found. </p>
<p>Greater exposure to news around gender equality and an increasingly gender-neutral curriculum in their formal education, equip these respondents with knowledge to approach outmoded gender stereotypes. </p>
<p>They grew up when home economics became compulsory for all lower secondary school pupils since 1997. More of their parents are likely to be dual-income households.</p>
<p>But such variations over what gender equality looks like also stems from differing viewpoints on whether this requires an imposed uniformity of roles between both sides.</p>
<p>The thinking goes: If gender equality means that men and women must be subject to the same, equal standard, why do women need concessions like maternity leave or different standards in athletic competitions? Why should they be given these benefits?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, there is a need to differentiate between “sex” and “gender”. </p>
<p>In sports and athletics, where biological differences result in some differences between the sexes, the creation of women’s sports with different standards recognises fair competition based on equitable standards. </p>
<p>Championing gender equality means providing equal opportunities for both sexes to pursue their aspirations. Imposing blind uniformity in rules or policies, on the hand, might end up disadvantaging women instead.</p>
<p>But interestingly, while women have long been the stay-home spouse, even norms here are shifting. In 2017, the Manpower Ministry found stay-home dads have doubled to 1,500 from 700 in the preceding decade.</p>
<h2>TENSIONS WITH EARLY ATTITUDES</h2>
<p>The influence of early socialisation cannot be discounted in shaping gender expectations. We learn about gender roles as children, including societal, cultural, and even religious expectations on how the sexes should behave.</p>
<p>It then seems natural for families, men, and women to behave in such a gendered manner.</p>
<p>A 2017 Insight report on Family and Work by the Ministry of Social and Family Development bears this out. </p>
<p>About 96 per cent of married working women polled said they were equally or primarily responsible for care-giving duties, compared to 43 per cent of married working men. </p>
<p>They also tend to spend more time on household chores even though they also work outside the home. Men however were more likely to contribute finances to maintain the family. </p>
<p>But as society slowly shifts from traditional gender roles to more progressive ones, this child – now an adult – finds his beliefs on families, men and women challenged and even deconstructed.</p>
<p>This dismantling evokes discomfort and may be even more severe when some religious beliefs of gender, held as unchangeable truths, are redefined.</p>
<p>Yet, Singapore’s cultural-religious sphere has evolved to provide more equitable spaces for women at a time when society did not.</p>
<p>Today, other forms of cultural relearning and expansion are taking place.</p>
<p>Through movements such as Dads for Life, many men have come to embrace more equitable gender roles in their families, especially in caregiving duties.</p>
<p>Religious communities too have used their platforms to reach male followers to educate them on gender relations within a religious perspective.</p>
<h2>MAKING FURTHER PROGRESS IN GENDER EQUALITY</h2>
<p>While many low-hanging fruit have been plucked in Singapore’s journey to empower and support women, the road ahead might be less clear. </p>
<p>Moving forward to enhance the participation of women as part of the Government’s White Paper on Women’s Development mean those who do not hold the same values might find themselves being excluded or mocked for their views.</p>
<p>This is where tolerance, respectful dialogue and education are needed to find a common middle ground. </p>
<p>There is a tendency to think men with concerns over gender equality are an impersonal, faceless albeit angry bloc of people. But dismissing their views could inadvertently increase opposition towards the cause of gender equality. </p>
<p>In moving across this river, Singapore should tread carefully and feel the stones, accepting three premises to avoid the move towards gender equality becoming a flashpoint for heated cultural debates.</p>
<p>First, there is an urgent need to address issues on gender inequality in society. While policy reforms can be quickly passed by Parliament, cultural change happens at a much slower pace.</p>
<p>Greater sensitisation of gender equality and individual acceptance require time. Sociologists call this “lagged adaptation”, where men may express more egalitarian ideas of gender, but lack the skills or will to act upon these ideas.</p>
<p>Second, societal discourse requires we lay aside stereotypes to debate issues rather than identities. </p>
<p>Organisations like Dads for Life and PPIS provide resources and safe, educational, and respectful spaces to learn about the changing roles of men and women in society.</p>
<p>Communities like these present men with role models who have accepted new masculinity norms, learned to negotiate this with their partners and thrived in the process. </p>
<p>Such engagement strategies help shift perspectives, even among those with more traditional notions of gender, perhaps among older members of our extended family.</p>
<p>Hearing personal explanations of changing gender roles and expectations from a family member might make the message a little easier to swallow – as it can be contextualised and supported with examples the recipient can better relate to.</p>
<p>Third, while advocacy for gender equality matters, these must move beyond a zero-sum game of “rights” and “privilege” and focus instead on how implementing equitable social systems benefits all segments of society.</p>
<p>These should recognise that some social groups might have different ways of understanding gender equality, given Singapore’s multicultural and multireligious Singapore context.</p>
<p>Singular, homogenous progressive explanations of gender equality should make room for inclusive, diverse but tolerable nuances on the scale of equality. </p>
<p>This includes providing resources for pro-women and pro-gender equality cultural and religious groups to define gender equality norms within the boundaries of their culture or faith.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Sleeping women can’t consent to sexual activity </h1>
<div> <p>A molest case involving a SMU student demonstrates problematic attitudes regarding consent, says AWARE’s Shailey Hingorani.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Shailey Hingorani </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: A fog of confusion hovers over sexual consent and what it really looks like. </p>
<p>Even if we write off the defence’s arguments as last-ditch attempts to escape punishment, they are disturbingly echoed in many social media comments made since the judgment was announced. </p>
<p>This confusion over consent worries many women’s rights activists, because acts of sexual violence are defined primarily by a lack of consent. </p>
<p>Yet while most people would agree, in theory, on the basic principle that “no means no”, the perpetrator’s testimony and the comments on social media show an incomplete understanding of how even an expressed “no” plays out in reality. </p>
<p>Worse, in this case, the woman was unable to consent because - as the judge noted - she was asleep when Lee started performing the sexual act on her.</p>
<p>A common thread that runs between the perpetrator’s testimony and netizens’ comments relates to how the victim’s behaviour earlier in the night was “misleading”. </p>
<p>The perpetrator testified in court that he thought the whole night was “a progressive thing” and that she was “okay with my advances”. </p>
<p>His testimony repeats a common misunderstanding about consent: That consenting to one activity once constitutes consent for other activities, or for the same activity at other times. </p>
<p>Yet consenting to kiss someone doesn’t give them the permission to fondle you. Having sex with someone in the past doesn’t mean consenting to sexual activities in the future.</p>
<p>The perpetrator should have sought consent again with each “progressive” physical or sexual activity. </p>
<p>Another aspect of the confusion over consent in this case is what one netizen calls the “signals” the victim was sending: “If she was uncomfortable with his advances, why didn’t she leave?” </p>
<h2>“STOP” DOESN’T MEAN CARRY ON</h2>
<p>Still, how is it possible for someone to hear “stop” and understand it as “carry on”?</p>
<p>Researchers call these “sexual scripts” - outdated narratives where men initiate and pursue sex and women are gatekeepers responsible for limiting and saying no. </p>
<p>These scripts assume that men have an uncontrollable desire for sex, something we saw in the SMU case too. The perpetrator wanted “release” in a “moment of lust” - playing into the male stereotype of an unmanageable libido.</p>
<h2>ASKING FOR CONSENT IS NOT UNROMANTIC</h2>
<p>Yet there are many ways of phrasing the consent question that do not “kill the mood”. For example, “does this feel nice? Do you like this?” </p>
<p>It’s not that women don’t know how to clearly assert non-consent, which implies that crimes like sexual assault are simply cases of miscommunication. As this SMU case very powerfully shows, even explicit refusals are often ignored or overruled. </p>
<p>Such problems have led some, like the police commissioner of New South Wales in Australia, to suggest the need for an app for couples to establish and record mutual consent before engaging in sex. </p>
<p>Yet critics argue that this approach promotes a contractual understanding of sexual relations. Consent cannot be deduced from an app and it cannot be negotiated ahead of time. It’s about communication in the moment. </p>
<p>A better method might be the acronym used widely by women’s organisations around the world: Consent is as easy as FRIES - it should be Freely given, Reversible, Informed, Enthusiastic and Specific. </p>
<p>Making sure you understand this before engaging in sexual activity is probably easier and way more effective than an app.</p>
<h2>AN ACTIVE DEFINITION OF CONSENT</h2>
<p>Some jurisdictions have already strengthened consent legislation. </p>

<p>Parents and teenagers also suggest including consent as one of the mainstays of sexuality education in schools, so that stereotypical sexual scripts can be debated.</p>
<p>Let’s not keep using the disturbing trope of Prince Charming kissing a sleeping Snow White as a template for real-life sexual interactions. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Women in China are buying their way out in fighting stigma of being single </h1>
<div> <p>Burberry shades, LV bags and Macbooks may be the solution for the 7 million single women in Urban China to fight the social stigma of shaming "leftover women", says researchers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chih-Ling Liu </a> <a> Robert Kozinets </a> </div> </div>
<p>LANCASTER, United Kingdom: In China, if you are female, educated and unmarried by the age of 27, people might use a particular term – “Sheng-nu” – to describe your social status. It translates simply as “leftover women”.</p>
<p>The label was deliberately invented to curb the rising number of single women in a traditional society which sometimes views not marrying as a moral transgression. Some even consider it a threat to national security.</p>
<p>Indeed, portrayals of single women as lonely, desperate, overqualified and intimidating appear regularly in Chinese media and news outlets. Research has shown that the “sheng-nu” stigma has pressurised many women into marriage.</p>
<p>But others are fighting back.</p>
<p>Partly as a result of the expansion of mass education since the economic reform of the 1980s, women in China appear to be increasingly confident about their place in modern society.</p>
<p>The 7 million single women aged 25 to 34 in urban China are among the largest contributors to the country’s growth. Women now contribute some 41 per cent to China’s GDP, the largest proportion of any country in the world.</p>

<h2>NO SHAME IN SINGLE LIFE</h2>
<p>One 33-year-old woman told us:</p>
<p>She continued: “I want the best of everything in life. My sunglasses are from Burberry, my handbag is from Louis Vuitton, my laptop is from Apple.”</p>
<p>“I show that I’m not miserable and I lead a great life. [My relatives] can then leave my parents alone.”</p>
<p>And a 30-year-old explained: “The more people want to laugh at you, the more glamorous you need to look in front of them. When you look glamorous, people become more tolerant of you [and your family].”</p>
<p>An IT developer of 35 recalled: “When I bought my mother a golden ring, she was over the moon. My father was very poor when they got married, so she never received a ring from him. I wanted to show both of them that I can afford many, many things.”</p>
<p>The marketplace is also capitalising on the rise of singlehood and its economic muscle.</p>
<p>China’s “Singles’ Day”, invented in 2009 by the e-commerce giant Alibaba as a kind of anti-Valentine’s celebration for single people, has overtaken Black Friday to become the biggest annual shopping festival in the world.</p>
<p>Held on Nov 11 every year (the date was chosen because of the four number ones in the date 11.11), 2021 has seen record levels of spending.</p>
<p>Japanese beauty company SK-II has also seen a growth in sales after it launched a series of popular videos featuring successful professional women who have chosen not to marry.</p>
<p>Of course, not all single women in China can afford to demonstrate this kind of spending power. But our study suggests that for those who can, a new sense of economic liberty helps to define themselves and their place in Chinese society.</p>
<p>The chance to spend money on themselves – and often on gifts for their parents – helps to positively redefine their single status as something to be proud of.</p>
<p>Through conspicuous consumption, they promote themselves as morally upright, economically independent, successful citizens. The women in our study are deploying the power of the market to counteract the “sheng-nu” stigma and its spread.</p>
<p>As another woman commented: “Single women really should go out more, especially when they are not bound by family life. Go out and see new scenery, experience a new life. You might realise there is another possibility to live.”</p>
<p>Despite its rise in contemporary China and Hong Kong, the act of protesting can lead to imprisonment and severe consequences.</p>
<p>For stigmatised “sheng-nu” women, direct confrontation in the form of social activism could lead to serious professional or legal consequences.</p>
<p>Instead, consumption and economic power has become a way for these women to build legitimacy for an alternative lifestyle.</p>
<p>Their struggle pits the modernising and global power of the contemporary market against the traditional cultural authority and media power of China’s modern party state.</p>
<p>And in a surprising turn of events, it looks like the single women are winning.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Must we choose between being a parent or employee when kids fall sick? </h1>
<div> <p>When I became a mother, asking to take childcare leave came with a pang of guilt and fear, says Sher-li Torrey.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sher-li Torrey </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: “My child is sick, can I take a day off?” can be simple but dreaded words.</p>
<p>It seems a perfectly reasonable request, in today’s society where it’s common to have two working parents with young children.</p>
<p>Yet, when I first became a mother, I couldn’t help but feel a pang of guilt and fear each time I needed to bring my baby to see the doctor.</p>
<p>What if my boss felt I was away too often? What if my small team of five was frustrated at having to cover my duties yet again? </p>
<p>Worse still for parents who have heeded the national call to have more children – if one falls ill, you can be sure the rest aren’t far behind.</p>
<h2>WORKING PARENTS’ PRE-COVID DILEMMA</h2>
<p>When I enrolled my firstborn in childcare, the first few months saw the baby adjusting to the new environment and being sick fairly often. </p>
<p>That meant many last-minute, early morning calls to my manager, requesting a day off. This constant tension between motherhood duties and a fear of being penalised for having less face-time at work led me to seek more flexible work arrangements.</p>
<p>Before COVID-19 measures forcibly transformed the way we work, many supervisors equated job dedication to visibility in the office and occasionally questioned the glaringly empty cubicle. </p>
<p>I was constantly exhausted, finding ways to balance precious time, energy and days of leave, especially when my child fell sick near crunch time for important projects.</p>
<p>It’s estimated that each young child will have six to eight colds a year. Imagine how many off days we’d need with two or more kids?</p>
<p>That’s when we realise parents’ worries about asking for time off and adding to the burden of our already-stretched teammates are all too real.</p>
<h2>JUGGLING WORK AND SICK CHILDREN AMID COVID-19</h2>
<p>When COVID-19 made work-from-home arrangements the default for those who could, it also threw us more balls to juggle when our hands were already full.</p>
<p>Many of us found ourselves incessantly code-switching between being a caring parent and a productive employee. When home-based learning was rolled out, we adjusted to our new “work-schoolday”.</p>
<p>It was a terribly stressful time. One mother I know created a family timetable, with parents’ and childrens’ schedules side by side, to literally get everyone on the same page. Many parents found, or at least tried, ways to organise the days.</p>
<p>One of my kids took her Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) last year, and I was conducting training workshops on top of my usual work duties. So, we drew up a timetable, trying to impose structure for very chaotic days.</p>
<p>It worked for a while – until the Wi-Fi in the house suddenly stopped working and none of us could follow our carefully plotted day.</p>
<p>During that period, I recall many frantic WhatsApp messages from fellow parents, especially those scheduled to return to the office after work-from-home was announced to no longer be the default from Aug 19. </p>
<p>Many had to request for a leave of absence, drawing on childcare leave or annual leave, or revert to a work-from-home arrangement to care for their child. </p>
<p>Another mother I knew was issued two consecutive quarantine orders – one child after the other. At the height of the situation, I had more than 10 personal contacts who accompanied their children at the hospital or their quarantine facility.</p>
<h2>REMOTE WORKING STILL A SILVER LINING FOR WORKING MUMS AND DADS</h2>
<p>But there is some good to be found for all that COVID-19 has upended in our lives.</p>
<p>Employers and managers have become far more open to accepting remote work as a viable and desired arrangement for employees whose roles allow it.</p>
<p>It means we don’t always need a whole day off, depending on how sick the child is. In between the child’s periods of rest, we can still work effectively as long as goals are clearly defined and the employee is committed to his job duties. </p>
<p>In October, Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah said in Parliament it will be “difficult” to extend current childcare leave entitlements for parents to cover all days of their child’s home-based learning.</p>
<p>A more fluid work arrangement can better ease the burden of working parents.</p>
<p>It gives us one less hoop to jump through in more scenarios, such as when the kids are sick or potentially exposed to illnesses, such as COVID-19, Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease, norovirus or other common germs.</p>
<p>The constant tension of being the best caregiver to our kids and effective contributors at work is very real. </p>
<p>COVID-19 has made things more challenging, but the last 21 months have proven that working parents can navigate both roles. All we need is some empathy and support.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Single and secure? Does family life come at the expense of financial freedom? </h1>
<div> <p>So many factors can change how much we need for financial freedom. What’s important is to make active efforts to earn, save and better invest our money, says financial trainer Ng Wai Chung.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Christopher Ng Wai Chung </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Family plays a declining role in Singaporeans’ journey to a better life.</p>
<p>At least according to AXA Insurance Singapore when it released findings of its Better Life Index 2021.</p>
<p>Fellow financial bloggers alerted me to this interesting finding that millennials viewed financial freedom as a more important purpose in life than having a happy family. </p>
<p>Unsurprising perhaps, when 2020 census data from the Department of Statistics showed a rising proportion of singles, particularly those aged 25 to 34.</p>
<p>My own experience reflects this: More than a decade ago, I worked aggressively to live within my investment income as a bachelor and grew it further to support my wife and two children. </p>
<p>In fact, my family of four had no breadwinner in the four years I pursued my law degree. </p>
<p>Today, even though we can live comfortably on investment returns, I continued with my business to set aside savings for the kids’ education and our future healthcare needs. </p>
<p>But just how much do we need to put for a happy, fufilled family life of comfort?</p>
<p>Financial advisors say you should focus on the safe rate of withdrawal - a staple in retirement planning that states we can spend the amount equivalent to 4 per cent of savings at retirement for 30 years without running out of money. </p>
<p>Going by this, someone with S$1 million in investments could spend S$40,000 annually, inflation-adjusted, for about 30 to 40 years.</p>
<h2>SINGLES HAVE TOTAL CONTROL BUT ALSO ALL THE RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
<p>There is no running way from the fact that the greatest advantage of singlehood is total control over personal finances. </p>
<p>Yes, I was crazy frugal. But I felt a sense of achievement at age 32, when I could sustain all my expenses, including taxes and parents’ allowance, with only investment dividends. </p>
<p>Sometimes good financial planning can start with small steps. One fewer cup of bubble tea a week can save S$200 every year. </p>
<p>In a recent study, the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy estimated that a single person aged 55 to 64 in 2021 spends S$1,768 monthly, or S$21,216 yearly, on basic needs. </p>
<p>This is a great baseline to aim for as a Gen Z fresh graduate starting to save and invest. Applying the safe withdrawal rate, one can sustain this level of spending for 30 years with S$530,400. </p>
<p>Can you get there before getting married, such that everything you earn can be channeled to housing and household needs without worrying about whether there’s enough to retire? </p>
<p>It’s a challenging feat for most. Say you can set aside S$2,000 monthly, you’d still need a tough and risky 14.1 per cent return on investment to accumulate S$500,000 within a decade.</p>
<p>But this is possible for thrifty, single professionals who can set aside salary increments and bonuses.</p>
<h2>COUPLES SHARE AND LIGHTEN THE LOAD</h2>
<p>The financial consequence of getting married of course is that expenses go up. My wife worked and we remained a frugal couple, so it took little time for investment income to catch up. </p>
<p>In the same study, a couple at age 65 in 2021 would need a basic budget of S$2,419 monthly, or S$29,028 yearly, lower than that for two singles. Couples can derive economies of scale living together, the most obvious being housing-related costs. </p>
<p>The target sum for financial freedom would be S$725,700, or S$362,850 each equally divided, and likely a more realistic goal for many. It’s a useful data-point for young couples to start planning even if they likely spend more than retirees. </p>
<p>Examining these numbers, my ambition as a bachelor might have been extreme. A single professional today can start saving less aggressively and update their strategy to share the load with a like-minded soulmate when the time comes. </p>
<p>So marriage need not be a trade-off to pursuing financial freedom and could actually make it more easily attainable together. </p>
<h2>TIME-LIMITED CHALLENGES FOR FAMILIES </h2>
<p>Things change when children come into the picture but there’s no need to fear.</p>
<p>My wife and I decided to have our first child after making plans to grow our investment income and she quit her day job to look after our daughter full-time. </p>
<p>We tried to live only within the dividends, which meant little “excess savings” and we struggled to put funds into her Child Development Account. </p>
<p>My colleagues were puzzled by my reluctance to touch my salary. But when we occasionally “overspent” and had to dig into my pay, it felt like a step back from being financially free. </p>
<p>The study also calculated a budget of S$6,426 monthly or $77,112 yearly for a family of four with one child aged between seven and 12 and a teenager aged between 13 and 18. </p>
<p>To sustain such spending for 30 years, the family would need $1,927,800. But it might not be meaningful to peg financial planning to a young family as expenses tend to go down after children leave the nest.</p>
<h2>FINANCIAL FREEDOM STILL WITHIN REACH</h2>
<p>There are so many factors that might change how much we need for financial freedom.</p>
<p>Would you spend this much as you get greyer? Might you have future goals of upgrading to a bigger house? Will adult children continue to live with you? </p>
<p>The sandwiched class will also have more complex needs, juggling eldercare and parenting.</p>
<p>Perhaps the key thing to remember is many of us cycle through all three life stages described – each with its own demands and considerations.</p>
<p>We can save more by changing retail habits, such as buying clothes infrequently from mass fashion chains and thrift stores, or finding alternative family outings like libraries, parks and museums at close to no cost. </p>
<p>We can look for better investment returns - higher than the 4 per cent safe withdrawal rate but often at a similarly higher risk.</p>
<p>An achievable start can be saving S$30,000 for investment, which translates into S$100 in passive investment income every month. </p>
<p>Making a deliberate attempt to achieve financial freedom doesn’t have to come at the expense of setting up a family. </p>
<p>The best time to start aiming for financial freedom is 20 years ago. The second best time is right now.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Will the Tengah New Town be the new eco-friendly standard for HDB? </h1>
<div> <p>As cities gear up for a warmer planet, public housing will need to address climate change and this goes beyond just installing energy efficient lights, says a researcher.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Harvey Neo </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: When the Housing and Development Board (HDB) began building flats for a growing population in 1960, it had a single purpose: To house as many people as possible in low-cost and clean homes.</p>
<p>Six decades later, 80 per cent of residents live in HDB flats. But the type of flat, the way it is built and the motivations of what it means to live in an HDB estate have transformed and the flat of the future is decidedly sustainable.</p>
<p>It started 10 years ago when Punggol was declared Singapore’s first eco-town. Since then, three more have been added under the HDB Green Towns Programme: Choa Chu Kang, Nee Soon and Tampines will be liveable eco-towns by 2030.</p>
<p>The <a>Green Towns Programme</a> offers a roadmap for the retrofitting of existing new towns to reduce the annual energy consumption in HDB towns by 15 per cent over a 10-year period, beginning from 2020.</p>
<p>In committing 70 per cent of HDB blocks for solar panel installation by 2030 to generate 648 GWh of clean energy annually, it is estimated that carbon emissions will be reduced by 324,000 tonnes per year.</p>
<p>Reducing carbon emissions, using renewable energy and protecting the natural environment and its diversity, are indicators used by the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city to assess eco-friendliness.</p>
<p>Other indicators used include “social harmony and progress” which is measured by the proportion of residents actively involved in community and social groups and the success in transitioning the economy to one which is greener.</p>
<p>Although the specific measures and strategies to bolster the eco-friendliness of a city differ from city to city, they are invariably tied to one or more of these common indicators.</p>
<h2>WHAT MAKES AN ECO-TOWN?</h2>
<p>This ideal vision of an eco-town is nestled in the masterplan of Tengah, dubbed “Forest Town”, which draws on a slew of sustainable planning principles to create an ecological town of unprecedented depth and scope. </p>
<p>Tengah Town will house five districts and will include the creation of a 100m wide and 5km long forest corridor. Walking and cycling paths will create Singapore’s first car-free town centre. </p>
<p>How resources are used will change too. For instance, the use of a rainwater harvesting system where rainwater collected at the roof tops of a block is treated by a water treatment system using membrane technology.</p>
<p>Potentially this can amount to 850 cubic metres annually and can used for washing void decks and refuse chutes. In these flats, residents can also grow edible food crops along their corridors, in line with HDB guidelines. </p>
<p>A resident living in a district in Tengah, can expect to live quite differently. </p>
<h2>REMOVING GREEN SPACES TO MAKE WAY FOR ECO-TOWNS</h2>
<p>What is interesting too is Tengah used to serve as training ground for the Singapore Armed Forces. </p>
<p>Their opposition however failed to gain public traction. A likely reason is that this area has not been accessible to the public for many decades so there is a less palpable sense of loss since it was a site which was protected to begin with.</p>
<p>In contrast, the plan to develop a 33ha site in Ulu Pandan generated much more debate as it would controversially remove an entire green space which the community has been visiting for many years. </p>
<p>Compared to Tengah, the green site in Ulu Pandan has been heavily used by people as recreation space. </p>
<p>Objections to developing these eco-towns from existing green spaces offer no easy answers. But it is important to compare if there will be an improvement in overall environmental performance of the site after the construction of the eco-town. </p>
<p>In the case of Ulu Pandan, there are some who believe the ecological merit of the green site is higher than to build housing over it, even if the housing achieved a Building and Construction Authority’s Green Mark Platinum rating. </p>
<p>Some have also emphasised the intangible value of the site as a symbolic landscape of the community.</p>
<p>As it turned out, an Environmental Baseline Study (EBS) conducted by an HDB-appointed external consultant concluded that there was an uneven distribution of biodiversity between the eastern and western parts of Ulu Pandan. </p>
<p>Returning to one of the key indicators for eco-friendliness, there is little biodiversity to protect in the eastern half of the site whilst a stronger case can be made to conserve the western half. </p>
<p>So, the plan to enhance the effectiveness of the site as an ecological connector and to transform and beautify Ulu Pandan Canal is a fair compromise. </p>
<p>The concept of an eco-friendly city has multiple dimensions (such as the reduction of carbon emissions, resource and energy conservation and environmental protection), none of which is reducible to just one dimension.</p>
<p>But the case of Ulu Pandan also shows we need to take the protection of non-economic dimensions, such as flora and fauna or enriching our diversity, seriously. </p>
<p>In an ideal world all the rich greenery can be kept intact but in reality, some of it has to make way for housing, so planning a town around sustainable principles is a good middle ground.</p>

<h1> Commentary: The struggle to care for a loved one with dementia is a painful reality </h1>
<div> <p>By 2030, one in every five people above 60 may suffer from dementia. This means the struggle for care will only get worse, says SUSS' Amberyce Ang.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Amberyce Ang </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: In a recent letter to the media, a woman outlined what it is like to care for and live with her mum with dementia. </p>
<p>Her mother has become prone to violence and she had trouble retaining domestic help. Admitting her mother into an institution was a last resort for the family. </p>
<p>Anguished stories like this are not new. Caregivers end up caught in a tight spot with no easy choices when it comes to caring for their loved ones with dementia.</p>
<p>MOH has said the average waiting time for nursing homes can be a month. In reality, depending on which homes you are looking at, this can be much longer.</p>
<p>The home therefore often ends up the option that makes the most financial, practical and emotional sense for many families. But caring for their loved ones at home has its own set of challenges.</p>
<p>I often see clients facing tough choices. Ms Lim* is an only child and both her parents have dementia. She cannot afford to place both in a local nursing home and doesn’t qualify for government subsidies based on per capita household income.</p>
<p>Based on her income, the cost would come to S$3,000 per parent including nursing home fees and medical expenses.</p>
<p>So she opted to send her father to a care home in Johor Bahru while her mother stayed with her.</p>
<p>Her kitchen cabinets have translucent doors so her mother can easily search for items, as this helps PWDs with memory recall difficulties who can be disoriented by closed compartments. </p>
<h2>NEED FOR APPROPRIATE, SKILLED CAREGIVERS</h2>
<p>But technology alone cannot provide care for a PWD, especially if their physical needs escalate. This is why families often turn to migrant domestic workers (MDWs).</p>
<p>Female FDWs may find it difficult to help male PWDs who are heavier, and certain tasks such as bathing might also be embarrassing for both parties.</p>
<p>Hiring a MDW is often an unsustainable short-term solution without appropriate training. PWDs can easily become aggressive and lash out when triggered by discomfort or frustrations that they are unable to articulate. </p>
<p>Experienced and trained live-in helpers can recognise the triggers and de-escalate dangerous situations. But this is often a tight pool of workers, with high demand and cost.</p>
<p>Mr Ong said he would have to pay a MDW at least S$1,000 but believes that families may be willing to pay if it is easier to source a male helper and obtain MOM’s approval.</p>
<h2>EASING CAREGIVER BURDEN </h2>
<p>Families sometimes simply give up looking for help and leave their jobs, put on a brave face and end up stressed or burnt out.</p>
<p>Today, one in 10 seniors above the age of 60 has dementia. This is set to rise to one in five by 2030. More of us will become caregivers, and we’re going to need more support.</p>
<p>What can we do as a nation to support caregivers? </p>
<p>In May last year, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) announced that no tender was given to Singapore’s first dementia village near Sembawang Park. </p>
<p>The sole bid price of $S15 million was too low, said the URA at the time. The idea was to have a safe home environment for people with varying stages of dementia. </p>
<p>The fact that this didn’t get off the ground shows that aged care policymakers have to find a way to balance cost, land lease length and demand so that assisted living can be commercially viable. </p>
<p>But they are closely monitored and cared for by full and part-time geriatric nurses and specialists, who “work” in the village as cashiers, grocery-store attendees and other roles in daily life.</p>
<h2>RAMPING UP DEMENTIA-FRIENDLY COMMUNITIES </h2>
<p>One step in this direction has been Kampung Admiralty, the first integrated community for the elderly where they can live in their own flats and have access to medical care for a fee. </p>
<p>It is also heartening to see that there are outreach and education efforts within the Woodlands community to help seniors with dementia who are lost. This includes training volunteers and SMRT staff.</p>
<p>For PWDs living alone or with their spouses, integrated communities like Kampung Admiralty can fill the gap in the meantime. </p>
<p>While there are more plans to increase these communities, we can work on easing caregiver burdens now. </p>
<h2>BUILDING SINGAPORE’S HEARTWARE </h2>
<p>For now, many elderly dementia patients are likely to live at home so the most impactful factor is each one of us - neighbours and residents in the community who look out for them. </p>
<p>Town councils or committees in various estates can offer platforms such as notice boards at lift lobbies for these families to share their needs and seek assistance to look out for their PWDs. </p>
<p>The work to support such families has to intensify, so that we will hear less anguished stories of caregivers and their loved ones suffering.</p>

<h1> Commentary: How to raise a lifelong learner, rather than a child who simply aces exams </h1>
<div> <p>With the imminent release of the PSLE results, a researcher discusses how preparing children for life—not just exams—requires us to relearn learning by thinking long-term and outside the (academic) box.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Heng Tang Tang </a> </div> </div>
<p>Ideally, learning should be about self-improvement, personal growth, or enjoyment. But this requires a shift in the way we think. </p>
<p>For deep and long-term understanding, children need time to interact with concepts, find out how they relate to what they already know and apply concepts to the real world. </p>
<h2>EVERYONE PLAYS A PART </h2>
<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has over the years tried to reshape our thinking about and relationship with learning. </p>
<p>But parents and teachers are critical in making this a reality. </p>
<p>That is, when parents engaged their children by talking and guiding - but not forcing or telling them what to do - children showed self-regulation in learning, low anxiety, high self-concept, persistence and performance.</p>
<p>NIE Associate Professor Nie Youyan and her colleagues also found that in Singapore classrooms where teachers emphasised learning, task mastery and self-improvement, students showed greater interest, enjoyment and self-efficacy. </p>
<p>Conversely, data revealed that classrooms organised around mutual competition and tests - or external motivations - were negatively correlated with academic achievements.</p>
<h2>HOW TO RELEARN LEARNING</h2>
<p>Given this start in self-directed learning, we can now do more to encourage metacognition, or thinking about one’s thinking. </p>
<p>For instance, in reviewing homework, instead of explaining how to rectify a mistake, enhance metacognition by asking the child to articulate the steps leading up to the mistake and what help they think they need to get it right. </p>
<p>Next, we can provide some clues and encourage them to solve the problem themselves. </p>
<h2>GOING BEYOND SCHOOL WORK AND EXAMS </h2>
<p>The final piece in the learning puzzle is that we mistakenly think that learning is just about school work. Parents may think children spending time with their toys or friends at the playground is not useful for learning.</p>
<p>These are dispositions and skills that will serve them well in unfamiliar circumstances and in the long run. </p>
<p>Knitting, someone said, requires perseverance and creativity. Indeed, this underscores the importance of adult support and open-mindedness to children’s pursuit of their interests in shaping their learning. </p>
<p>Educational philosopher John Dewey wrote: “Give the pupils something to do, not something to learn; and the doing is of such a nature as to demand thinking, or the intentional noting of connections; learning naturally results”.</p>
<p>Learning, Dewey argues, is experiential in nature and one way we can do better is to vary the learning experiences of children beyond pen and paper practice. This would require creativity and a commitment to relearning learning on our parts.</p>
<p>Only in relearning our relationship with learning can we help ourselves and our children be prepared for life at large.</p>

<h1> Commentary: What can you do if your parents or siblings refuse COVID-19 vaccination? </h1>
<div> <p>Relationships are coming under strain, especially in families where there are divergent views about COVID-19 protocols and vaccination. These are never easy to resolve, says clinical psychologist Dr Annabelle Chow.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Annabelle Chow </a> </div> </div>
<p>Take Sarah* for instance. She is the main caregiver of her elderly mother. Besides the mental strain of caregiving, Sarah experiences anxieties over her unvaccinated siblings visiting their mother. </p>
<p>She tried explaining to her siblings that they might endanger the health of their elderly mother who has pre-existing allergies, but they are adamant the vaccines are unsafe. </p>
<p>Pleas for them to get vaccinated often turned into arguments, causing a rift in their relationship.</p>
<p>Then there’s Mike* who has been talking to his parents for months trying to persuade them to get their jabs. But these conversations often become heated, creating tension.</p>
<p>His parents are religious and believe that vaccines are harmful. As a result of their arguments, Mike’s relationship with his parents has become very strained.</p>
<p>Tension and conflict are unavoidable realities in every family setting. Family members can hold strong but opposing views on many issues: Money, politics, chores, romantic partners, tastes and preferences. </p>
<p>But few issues come with a similar measure of gravity and consequence as the decision to take or decline COVID-19 vaccinations, both within the family and externally.</p>
<h2>WHY FAMILY CONFLICTS ARE DIFFERENT</h2>
<p>As fissures form between family members with strong and polarising views, it can end up in deeply upsetting consequences – active conflict, avoidance, a “cold war” stand-off or even estrangement are all situations we see in our practice. </p>
<p>During a pandemic however, the ultimate consequence of choosing or declining vaccination is serious illness or death.</p>
<p>Even if unvaccinated family members are spared these dire outcomes, vaccination-differentiated rules disrupt family life and relations among members with different vaccination statuses.</p>
<p>While we cannot wish away differences in attitudes, beliefs (some of them deeply held) or behaviours, it helps if we know how to navigate some of the trickier conflicts, without having to sacrifice the relationship altogether.</p>
<h2>DON’T SHAME OR LECTURE</h2>
<p>Many conflicts become intractable because family members do not possess all the information available to the other members. For example, some older persons have suspicions over the effectiveness and risks of taking a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>Quite often, they get this information from their group of friends or community. </p>
<p>There’s a caveat though: We find that overloading a person with information that conflicts with personal views can be futile. It can end up in an information tit-for-tat that goes nowhere.</p>
<p>Quite often, individuals can make opposing conclusions even with the same set of facts. </p>
<p>An MIT study in March found that COVID-19 sceptics had marshalled and presented sophisticated data visualisations using datasets from official government sources to argue against wearing masks as a precautionary measure. </p>
<p>This study illustrates that facts alone do not lead to one conclusion – as individuals we can interpret information in vastly different ways.</p>
<p>Ask them to share their reasons for their beliefs. Try to actively listen to what their needs and concerns are and acknowledge their viewpoint makes sense to them.</p>
<p>For instance, it is reasonable to be hesitant to inject unknown chemicals into their bodies or to be worried about the side effects after hearing troubling stories. All fears are relative but real.</p>
<p>Next, it is helpful to explore common concerns and priorities. Find points of agreement – because that helps reduce the idea that they are adversaries.</p>
<p>Lastly, always politely ask for permission before sharing unsolicited information. If they express an unwillingness to have a conversation, respect their wishes.</p>
<p>Even if we are declined an opportunity to do so, we can still politely state the reasons or motivations behind our desire to share, for instance: “I am concerned that you might fall seriously ill if you do not vaccinate.” </p>
<p>But shaming, pressuring or lecturing them for having an opinion different to yours is the surest way to shut down all conversation.</p>
<p>But if your family member is still not persuaded despite your best efforts, a lack of compromise does not mean that there cannot be family harmony or that you are not free to set limits.</p>
<p>In fact, allowing each member to voice their thoughts and agree on certain limits helps families reduce conflict and maintain good relations.</p>
<p>Communicate your concerns and set limits of engagement.</p>
<p>In the context of the pandemic, engagement boundaries might involve no home gatherings to prevent transmission among the unvaccinated, no family meals outside or no travelling together until every member is vaccinated.</p>
<p>Ensure everyone is aware of the limits and agrees to abide by them.</p>
<p>From my family sessions, I observed a common method of conflict resolution is the “midway” compromise: Attempting to meet each other some but not all the way.</p>
<p>For example, if a family member wants to go for a nature walk while the other member does not, the family might decide to take a shorter walk at the air-conditioned domes at Gardens by the Bay instead.</p>
<p>But conflicts about medical conditions and procedures are more difficult to navigate and reach realistic compromises on compared to other types of conflict.</p>
<p>When presented with polar opposite views between full or no vaccination, and the smorgasbord of other non-approved therapeutic and home remedies in between, many might explore middle ground options for the sake of family harmony. </p>
<p>It must be categorically stated that strongly held lay opinions are not a replacement for validated research. Real and grave consequences can arise from misinformation. </p>
<p>For instance, a Singaporean senior who doubted the efficacy of the vaccines was hospitalised after taking ivermectin, and many Americans attempted to self-medicate by drinking disinfectants, which is potentially fatal. </p>
<p>This means there are clear red lines – no one should look to compromise or find a middle ground by doing something evidently harmful. </p>
<p>These are certainly not easy times for families but with some effort, sympathy and a common goal of caring and loving each other, conflicts can be resolved.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why is it okay for newly married people to move out, but not singles? </h1>
<div> <p>It is not wasteful, impractical and unfilial for a young single to move out. Perhaps, we should stop treating singles like “adult children”, says Annie Tan.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Annie Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: A young single friend of mine recently moved out. Her mum’s reaction was a mix of disapproval and a sense of abandonment. </p>
<p>Two soon-to-be-married couple friends rented a place when their build-to-order (BTO) flat was delayed around the same time. Their parents not only approved but blessed them with a new refrigerator to get them started. </p>
<p>These are common scenarios in Singapore today. Young people leave their parents’ to live on their own.</p>
<p>Singles, however, seem to be getting a lot more flak for it. When 26-year-old account executive Cherie Lim shared her reasons for renting a co-living space in a CNA story, many netizens blasted her for being wasteful, entitled and ungrateful. </p>
<p>Some also suggest this is a Western concept Singaporeans should not adopt. </p>
<p>And yet things are vastly different in Singapore because of our small geographical size and sky-high housing prices. Singles stay with their parents until they get married. </p>
<p>This norm is so deeply ingrained, moving out without getting married raises eyebrows and spurs questions about whether family ties are coming under strain. </p>
<h2>COMING OF AGE DURING THE PANDEMIC</h2>
<p>Instead of wagging the finger at such youths, Singapore society should embrace these changes with confidence. Each generation has questioned norms and challenged the status quo. </p>
<p>The pandemic brought our focus to living arrangements, family dynamics and what YOLO (“you only live once”) means to each person.</p>
<p>Across different societies and eras, the coming-of-age rite usually involves leaving the nest and at least temporarily separating from parents – no matter how beloved. </p>
<p>In the before-COVID times, there were so many uncontroversial avenues to flex our independence and find ourselves without renting a co-living space. </p>
<p>Many of my peers also took long trips, or stayed in university dormitories, studied overseas, or moved to new cities for a new job. </p>
<p>Today’s youth are robbed of many such experiences – dorm-living, graduation trips and first-day-at-the-office experiences.</p>
<p>Many will move from school into the work force without leaving that little desk in their childhood bedroom. Starting work can feel like yet another final year project with no clear demarcation.</p>
<p>In that light, moving out to rent may be less this generation’s “selfish pursuit of new experiences” but a reflection of the pandemic-spurred existential crisis and the hero’s journey of our times. </p>
<p>Perhaps it embodies a desire to reclaim back a sense of time, milestones and significant rituals. </p>
<p>“Adulting”, a term coined by this generation, and often used irreverently or ironically, has further lost its meaning in the pandemic world. Surely drawing a pay cheque or getting married are part of this process but not the full story?</p>
<h2>ADULTHOOD IS NOT DEFINED BY MARRIAGE</h2>
<p>This brings us to another cultural peculiarity – getting married in Singapore is somehow loosely synonymous with adulthood and moving out, so much so that when you apply for a new HDB, it is often assumed that you are getting married. </p>
<p>BTOs are not even made available for singles under 35 and they are a huge financial commitment.</p>
<p>But why should becoming an adult necessarily equate to getting married? This conundrum is amplified when fewer are choosing to get married, and many do so later in their 30s. </p>
<p>With more mature singles, perhaps it is time we view singlehood differently. “Single adults” are “adults”. They should not be treated like “adult children”.</p>
<p>They too need a place of their own to grow and come into their own – a concept that should not be reserved only for married people. </p>
<p>The last thing we need is to treat them like infantilised adults. I have friends who have never cooked because their mum has a certain way of doing things in the kitchen. </p>
<p>Friends also tell me that they need to ask permission to buy furniture or bulky electronics – and rightfully so because it is not their own place. </p>
<p>You may say they are blessed, and you would be right. But this can give way to a tendency to define oneself as someone’s child instead of the values, interests and life goals you have.</p>
<p>Sure, they could pitch in at their family homes and unearth new responsibilities. But decade-long habits can be hard to change for both parent and adult child. </p>
<p>Moving out can be the needed impetus to cut the umbilical cord and rewrite familial roles. </p>
<p>We might even surprise ourselves. My friend’s mother was hesitant when she moved out. A year later, she realises her daughter is not only fine but happier. Now, she encourages others to do the same.</p>
<h2>DIFFERENT WAYS TO SHOW FILIAL PIETY</h2>
<p>That is not to say that children should neglect aged parents. Filial piety is the bedrock of Asian societies. </p>
<p>Moving out in young adulthood, provided one does not have ailing parents, can be an investment in self-development for a more fruitful return to our parents in their old age when they truly need us. </p>
<p>Today, my widowed father lives with me in my marital home and we have a harmonious relationship. </p>
<p>His foresight in allowing me the time and space to do so go off has paid off. It has made me a more grateful daughter, a more patient mother, and generally a more self-aware person.</p>
<p>Those few months apart redefined our relationship and allowed him and I to see each other with new eyes. </p>
<p>Spending some time apart may help youth more easily transition from “adult child” to “adult”, draw new boundaries, create more age-appropriate family dynamics and discover a healthier model for intergenerational relationships.</p>
<p>Isn’t that why we bring up children in the first place? We hold their hands and guide their first steps so that one day they may find their wings and seek out new horizons. </p>
<p>Indeed, youth will find ways to pursue and proclaim their individuality, with or without our blessings. They should not be made to feel guilty for it by bystanders if they have earned it for themselves. </p>
<p>As a mother, I too am prepared for my kids to leave me to seek new worlds. It will be heart-breaking to let them go, but it will also fill me with deep pride.</p>
<p>This is not a clash of Western and Eastern culture. </p>
<p>Afterall, at the end of the day, families are knit together by love; not by rules, judgement or physical walls.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Post PSLE, what if a 12-year-old wants an Instagram or TikTok account? </h1>
<div> <p>This question must be asked in many households and parents are fearful of all the negative consequences of heavy social media use. Mum of a tweenager, June Yong, writes of this dilemma.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> June Yong </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: When it comes to social media, parents of teens may find themselves lodged between a rock and a hard place.</p>
<p>Unlock the floodgates and you might find it hard to regain control once it’s been given. Hold onto the keys tightly and your teen might grumble at you daily – until you eventually cave. Or worse, set up secret accounts elsewhere.</p>
<p>A friend and I have been discussing when to allow our 12-year-old daughters access to social media. Since the PSLE ended, our girls have been asking for the green light to their own Instagram accounts. </p>
<p>About a third of the teen girls said Instagram made them feel worse about their bodies, leading the social media giant to conclude: “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.” </p>
<p>The problems with teens and social media have been increasingly documented, with top concerns including that it commands too much of their time and attention, and has negative impacts on a child’s self-esteem and mental health. </p>
<p>In a critical time of their life, teens are bombarded with posts which researchers say affect their attitudes and feed their anxieties. </p>
<p>Yet, social media is the lubricant of how we communicate, the intractable platforms of our lives, a kind of a digital diary that showcases all the things we find joy in. </p>
<p>Are we down to a matter of when, and not if? How do we teach our 12-year-olds to navigate the social media minefield – with its related issues of cyberbullying, body image issues and sexualisation?</p>
<h2>SETTING SMART LIMITS ON SMARTPHONES</h2>
<p>Smartphones are designed to be addictive and who better than adults to know this is true?</p>
<p>Posts likely to yield similar reactions were more likely to show up on your feed, and to contain misinformation, spam, or clickbait.</p>
<p>In order to play safely on this “battleground” some parents impose strict time limits. May Cheo, a HR practitioner in her 40s, sets aside a digital detox day for her younger daughter, Anya (13) who started using social media this year. </p>
<p>Her daughter has to keep her phone away for the whole day, except for pockets of time before or after meals to check if there are urgent messages on homework. </p>
<p>This discipline should apply to parents but rarely do. With COVID-19 still raging and work-from-home still a reality for many of us, it’s so much easier to hand them a phone and keep them out of our hair. </p>
<p>Setting consistent and clear rules on social media use is not easy but the opposite – letting a young child loose without boundaries would make it near impossible to rein in the habit after it is already formed. </p>
<p>Yet, despite the effort and time this needs, there’s no running way from the fact that parents are the key gatekeepers of our children’s digital lives. </p>
<p>I look at it this way. I would never set my daughter behind the wheel of a car without giving her training and supervision. We can apply the same wisdom to social media.</p>
<p>Navigating social media safely requires not only considering how mature our children are and active parental monitoring, but mutual understanding on how such apps work.</p>
<p>We recently watched The Social Dilemma on Netflix as a family to highlight to our children the potential dangers around social media use and to teach them explicitly what these apps are designed for. </p>
<p>The documentary was most striking for its dramatisation of the life of a depressed teenage girl and her never-ending search for online approval. The comments she received about her looks often seep into real life and continue to haunt her. </p>
<p>Such documentaries may be a good place to start critical conversations. By giving our children a glimpse into their raison d'être, they can appreciate how social media has been developed to hold our attention and whet our appetite for more.</p>
<h2>ARMING KIDS WITH EMOTIONAL SKILLS</h2>
<p>But to focus solely on avoiding social media for as long as possible, without due consideration of the emotional needs driving us there in the first place, seems to be sidestepping the issue. </p>
<p>There are deep and real human needs that push us to continually engage with our smart phones and social media, such as the need for belonging, connection, esteem and autonomy.</p>
<p>For teen girls, the desire to be seen and validated is particularly strong at a stage where they are still forming and negotiating their identity. </p>
<p>So perhaps whenever our teens pick up their smartphones, we could ask them: What am I needing at this moment when I pick up this phone?</p>
<h2>BUILDING UP OTHER AREAS</h2>
<p>Perhaps the best balm against the fear of our children being sucked into a social media black hole is quality family time. Time spent with them doing things that build up all their other interests. </p>
<p>The social media tide is not going to turn anytime soon, nor should we expect tech companies to do anything other than gun for more reach and revenue. </p>
<p>So parents have to play a much larger role in this – laying small but important planks of understanding, human connections and emotional skills. </p>
<p>Only then can we hope to ride this wave as safely as we can. Start now when your 12-year-old asks for an Instagram account.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Parental concerns brewing ahead of approval for COVID-19 vaccinations for kids under 12 </h1>
<div> <p>Parents are already thinking whether to vaccinate younger children aged five to 11, and we need to have this conversation, says NUH paediatrician Dr Lee Le Ye.</p> </div>

<p>SINGAPORE: Parents in Singapore with kids aged five to 11 will have to make a big decision very soon.</p>
<p>As a mother, I can understand the conflicts and concerns that parents have. Choosing to get that jab for our young ones just doesn’t seem straightforward.</p>
<p>On one hand, we celebrate that a vaccine is finally available for children as we know mass vaccination of the world population is our ticket out of the pandemic. Most of Singapore’s eligible population have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Many countries have also launched successful vaccination campaigns, including for adolescents after published clinical trial data demonstrated vaccine efficacy at preventing symptomatic infection in children aged 12 to 15. </p>
<p>Several also rolled out or recommended vaccinating younger age groups or are currently deliberating it. In the United States, more than 2.6 million children between five to 11 have already received their first dose.</p>
<p>Will we do the same with younger children when the time comes?</p>
<h2>CONTENDING WITH POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS AND RISKS</h2>
<p>On the other hand, many parents can’t help but wonder whether the vaccine is safe. With no long-term data on the effects of vaccines, parents are concerned about possible side effects. </p>
<p>These are unknowns that can only be addressed after real-world vaccination programmes are established. These are known as Phase 4 data used in all medicines and vaccines developed previously.</p>
<p>Besides allergic reactions which manifest within the study period, there is particular concern about the increased risk of myocarditis or pericarditis. To date, the incidence of myocarditis appears to be higher in adolescent and young adult males. </p>
<p>But Singapore data has shown low rates of serious adverse events – about 0.006 per cent of almost 10 million doses administered as of Oct 31 according to the Health Sciences Authority.</p>
<p>Parents might also have to contend with the practical challenge of limiting young energetic children’s activities and physical movements for two weeks after vaccination – not an easy feat.</p>
<p>On top of that, younger children will naturally be afraid of vaccination and needles. Parents may find it more difficult to manage children who have yet to reach the maturity to understand the need and rationale for the vaccine.</p>
<h2>WEIGHING THE RISKS AND BENEFITS</h2>
<p>But parents are also savvy enough not to think of risks in isolation. Are the benefits of vaccination worth its risks? Don’t children have a lower risk of developing severe disease?</p>
<p>But it would be oversimplified to say children can get infected with little consequence.</p>
<p>Specifically, among adolescents hospitalised for COVID-19 in the US, 70.6 per cent had at least one underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>Vaccinating children who are vulnerable and with underlying medical conditions will certainly help reduce their own risk of severe illness and deaths.</p>
<p>Another major concern is the multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) linked to COVID-19, as well as the risk of long-COVID. </p>
<p>Singapore has recently experienced its second wave of COVID-19, and children have not been spared from infection, with at least 1,732 cases in children below 12 from Nov 9 to 15.</p>
<p>However, there are low numbers of children who require oxygen, intensive care or intubation. It is fortunate no child or adolescent in Singapore has died due to COVID-19 to date. </p>
<p>It can lower the extent of transmission as well as the possibility of infection for both adults and children. Isolating young children alone for home recovery will be challenging and a caregiver will need to be available. </p>
<p>Reducing infection in children can also reduce the risks of them infecting their grandparents or parents who are unable to take the vaccines due to other underlying conditions like cancer treatment or severe allergies.</p>
<h2>CONSIDER THE MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN</h2>
<p>In a way, Singapore and many parents have already adopted a cocoon strategy to protect our little ones – parents, older siblings, childcare teachers, pregnant women as well as lactating women are getting vaccinated. </p>
<p>Parents can also consider vaccinating the most vulnerable children first, such as those with underlying respiratory and cardiac issues, immunocompromised children, and certainly children of healthcare professionals or frontliners.</p>
<p>It is also worth vaccinating children living with immunocompromised household members at higher risk of life-threatening COVID-19.</p>
<p>Parents whose children have yet to complete their basic childhood immunisation due to disruptions like last year’s circuit breaker should complete them first. </p>
<p>Only then will they be able to make sound decisions to protect their families and give our children a chance to return to the playgrounds and group activities.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Parents and students are anxious over the release of the PSLE results. So are teachers </h1>
<div> <p>Crossing this milestone is a big deal for teachers when students’ scores can feel like a report card for them, says NIE’s Jason Tan.</p> </div>

<p>SINGAPORE: Thousands of parents and students are anxiously awaiting the release of this year’s Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results due today. </p>
<p>While Singaporeans are used to this annual rite of passage, how many pause to consider how teachers feel?</p>
<p>Emotions, normally running high on the day the results are released, have been exacerbated by the widespread effects of the pandemic.</p>
<p>There is nervousness each year about the release of the PSLE results, when they can feel like a report on teachers’ effectiveness in examination preparation. </p>
<p>But teachers of this year’s PSLE cohort have had an especially trying time amid the turbulence engendered by the pandemic on school life.</p>
<p>They and their students, along with the students’ parents, have endured almost two years of disruption to pre-COVID school routines.</p>
<p>Teachers had to assume a multiplicity of roles. One is that of a healthcare worker guiding students through the observance of safe management measures.</p>
<p>These measures, both within and outside of schools, along with the curtailment of co-curricular activities, likely had adverse effects on students’ peer socialisation.</p>
<p>Primary schools have been more badly affected than secondary schools and pre-university institutions by the scaling back of co-curricular activities as most students were unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Consequently, a key focus for teachers has been the monitoring of students’ mental and emotional well-being, especially in the lead-up to this major national examination. </p>
<p>A second role that has preoccupied teachers is that of being healthcare ambassadors.</p>
<p>Third, teachers had to adapt to the implementation of home-based learning (HBL). They had to become adept at preparing alternate sets of face-to-face and online learning materials.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) has acknowledged that HBL is an inadequate substitute for face-to-face lessons in school.</p>
<p>Teachers had to engage in what it terms “curriculum recovery”, or the process of re-teaching topics covered during HBL, in a bid to catch up with the pace of curriculum coverage.</p>
<p>This despite “common last topics” being removed from the PSLE, as the MOE did last year, to relieve the stress on students, parents and teachers. </p>
<p>At the same time, teachers had to play the role of educational equity advocates by ensuring the learning needs of students from financially disadvantaged or emotionally vulnerable families are not unduly compromised.</p>
