<h2> Understanding Comorbidity </h2>
<div> <h3> Why is there debate over the term comorbidity? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is psychiatric comorbidity? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Psychiatric comorbidity means that there is the coexistence of multiple psychiatric disorders. For example, a person with schizophrenia may also suffer from any of these disorders: panic, PTSD, OCD, generalized anxiety, social anxiety.</p> </div>
<div> <h3> Why does insomnia often accompany other conditions? </h3> </div>
<a>insomnia</a> and other conditions seem to go hand in hand for many people. One of the most common combinations is
<a>insomnia</a> and depression. However, just a few sessions of talk
<a>cognitive-behavioral</a> therapy for insomnia, can help on both fronts, addressing insomnia and depression. In fact, lifting insomnia will help lift depression.
<div> <h3> What are some common comorbidities? </h3> </div>
<p>• <a>Eating disorders</a>: anxiety disorders, mood disorders, <a>self-harm</a>, and substance use disorders. </p>

<h2> Substance Use and Comorbidities </h2>
<div> <h3> What comes first, a substance use disorder or mental illness? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>A person can be first diagnosed with either a substance use disorder or a mental illness. Sometimes they occur concurrently, or they can occur one after the other.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What do co-occurring disorders and dual diagnosis mean? </h3> </div>
<a>substance abuse</a> disorder and a mental illness at the same time, such as schizophrenia or depression. The term dual diagnosis describes the same condition.
<div> <h3> Why is there overlap in co-occurring disorders? </h3> </div>

<div> <h3> Why does trust matter for relationships? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is it important to have trust in a workplace? </h3> </div>
<a>Workers in low-trust organizations</a> are less likely to speak up or to help others who need it, which can weaken morale and the company’s bottom line.
<div> <h3> How does trust improve society? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can most people be trusted? </h3> </div>
<a>whether or not most people can be trusted</a> all of the time. However, the belief that most people are generally trustworthy, known as “generalized trust,” appears to be correlated with higher
<a>intelligence</a>, better health, and overall life satisfaction.
<div> <h3> What is the connection between trust and moral character? </h3> </div>
<a>first impression</a> and, ultimately, a healthy and rewarding relationship.
<div> <h3> Are humans hardwired to trust others? </h3> </div>
<a>neuroscience research on the mechanisms of trust</a> suggests that human brains are naturally prone to trusting others. In one study, brain regions associated with positive emotions and
<a>decision-making</a> lit up when someone trusted a close associate to play a game fairly, indicating that feelings of trust trigger social reward centers in the brain.

<div> <h3> Are certain personality traits predictive of trustworthiness? </h3> </div>
<a>conscientiousness</a>, consistently predict trustworthiness. Other personality characteristics also play a role; for instance,
<a>guilt</a>-proneness, or one’s tendency to anticipate feeling guilt after wrongdoing, is 
<a>highly predictive of trustworthiness in one study.</a>
<div> <h3> Is it possible to be too trusting? </h3> </div>
<a>openness</a>. Williams Syndrome, a rare disorder sometimes called
<a>the “opposite of autism,”</a> leads those who live with it to treat everyone, even strangers, as trustworthy, which can lead to negative consequences.
<h2> The Roots of Distrust </h2>
<div> <h3> Does anxiety make it harder to trust other people? </h3> </div>
<a>anxious participants actually found it more difficult to recognize untrustworthy people</a>, and continued to collaborate with them even when their behavior did not warrant it.

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Synesthesia</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<h2> Understanding Synesthesia </h2>
<p>Synesthesia can enhance cognitive abilities such as <a>creativity</a> and <a>memory</a>, as it’s easier to make connections between concepts. Renowned creative minds such as Vincent Van Gogh and Vladimir Nabokov claimed to have synesthesia.</p>
<p>Synesthesia can be associative, so senses are connected and associated in a person’s mind, or projective, when the images and colors are projected into reality.</p>
<div> <h3> What is a synesthete? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How common is synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>It is estimated that approximately 3 to 5 percent of the population has some form of synesthesia and that women are more likely to become synesthetes than men.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Are you born with synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<a>childhood</a>. Research has shown signs of a genetic component; there is some debate over whether everyone is born with some degree of synesthesia, or if it’s a special perception of the world that only some individuals share.
<div> <h3> Can you suddenly become a synesthete? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In rare cases, synesthesia can develop later in life, either temporarily from the use of psychedelic drugs, <a>meditation</a>, and sensory deprivation, or permanently,<a> from head trauma</a>, strokes, or brain tumors.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the benefits of synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<a> more vivid mental imagery</a> than non-synesthetes. Some say this is associated with greater connectivity in the brain. Synesthetes also demonstrate
<a> more creative thinking</a>, discovering that metaphors come easily.
<div> <h3> Is synesthesia a mental illness? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>No, synesthesia is not an illness or<a> mental disorder</a>. Rather, it’s a fresh way of experiencing the world through a mixing of the senses that is unique to the individual.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h3> Does synesthesia run in families? </h3> </div> <div> <div> <p>Yes, there does seem to be a genetic component to synesthesia, which can be passed down from parent to child.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Who discovered synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The earliest mentions of synesthesia were recorded by 19th-century scientist Francis Galton, although research<a> would not begin in earnest</a> until the late 20th century.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> The Different Types of Synesthesia </h2>
<a>mental imagery</a> associated with synesthesia (which explains the popularity of cooking and baking shows).
<p>While nearly any sensory combination is possible in synesthesia, here are some of the most well-known ways it manifests:</p>
<li>Auditory-tactile synesthesia occurs when a sound prompts a specific bodily sensation (such as tingling on the back of one’s neck).</li>
<li>Chromesthesia occurs when certain sounds (like a car honking) can trigger someone to see colors.</li>
<li>Grapheme-color synesthesia occurs when letters and numbers are associated with specific colors.</li>
<li>Lexical-gustatory synesthesia occurs when hearing certain words triggers distinct tastes.</li>
<li>Number form occurs when a mental map of numbers involuntarily appears whenever someone thinks of numbers.</li>
<li>Ordinal linguistic personification is a kind of synesthesia where ordered sequences (e.g., the days of the week) are associated with personalities or genders.</li>
<li>Spatial sequence synesthesia involves seeing numbers or numerical sequences as points in space (e.g., close or far away).</li>
<div> <h3> Can you have multiple types of synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Many synesthetes have more than one type of synesthesia. It is estimated that 4 percent of humans have some form of synesthesia, though the percentage who have multiples types is much smaller.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the most common types of synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the rarest types of synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<a> Swimming-style synesthesia,</a> or seeing colors when watching or thinking about a specific swimming stroke, is also unusual.
<h2> Do You Have Synesthesia? </h2>
<div> <h3> How do I know if I have synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<a> see the letter “A”</a> as pink, or maybe the smell of gasoline looks like a brown fog.) These are some examples of how synesthesia might manifest, which involve cross-talking between your senses.
<div> <h3> How do you test for synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h3> Is it possible to self-diagnose synesthesia? </h3> </div> <div> <div> <p>For certain types of synesthesia, you can take the Synesthesia Battery, an online test, to help confirm.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Can you have mild synesthesia? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Yes, some synesthesia experiences are more mild than others. For example, associated synesthesia is generally less intense and disruptive than having different sensory combinations projected into reality.</p> </div> </div>
