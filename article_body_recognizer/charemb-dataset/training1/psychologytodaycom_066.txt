<h1> Red Flags to Watch Out for in Therapy </h1>
<h2> When to move on and find a new therapist. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Therapy? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Red flags in therapy include violations of confidentiality, boundaries, and licensure, among others.</li>
<li>Therapy can be ineffective when the therapist is unable to communicate or lacks the training to treat a patient’s specific problem.</li>
<li>Patients can raise concerns with their therapist directly. If the problem can’t be resolved, the patient should find a new therapist.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: VGstockstudio/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Therapy</a> is a delicate process. The ability to share one’s thoughts, feelings, and past experiences requires a strong foundation of trust.
<p>Here are the signs of a harmful or ineffective therapist, and what to do if you encounter them.</p>
<h3>8 Red Flags to Watch Out For</h3>
<a>fear of heights</a>, but the therapist repeatedly asks intrusive questions about their
<a>sex</a> life, that would cross the line. The same goes if a therapist asks specific questions about where a patient lives or tries to run into the patient outside of therapy.
<p>“Stepping over the line of professionalism is a red flag,” says psychologist <a>Ryan Howes, Ph.D. </a>“You can talk about it with the therapist at first, but if you don’t get a satisfying answer, get out.” </p>
<p>2. Violations of Confidentiality</p>
<p>3. Violations of Licensure</p>
<a>Lying</a> about being licensed or practicing without a license would be a clear red flag. (An exception to this rule would be trainees in a clinic, who may be working under a supervisor’s license.)
<p>4. Excessive Self-Disclosure </p>
<a>Elinor Greenberg, Ph.D.</a> “It should carefully be targeted for the patient’s benefit.”
<p>5. Ineffective Communication</p>

<p>6. Lack of Appropriate Training</p>
<p>A good therapist will still need to ask follow-up questions to clarify and understand your experience. But if a therapist explicitly passes judgment on you and your choices, or makes you feel embarrassed or ashamed, this is a red flag.</p>
<p>8. False or Specific Promises</p>
<h3>The Importance of Communication</h3>
<p>Still, it’s natural to feel nervous about raising uncomfortable topics or critiques. But mental health professionals are trained to discuss the therapeutic process, so it may be easier than you think.</p>
<h3>How to Voice Your Concerns</h3>
<a>cutting</a> it wrong, you’d want to tell them. In therapy it’s hard and it feels like there’s a power differential, but a mature therapist should take that in stride and want to hear that feedback.”
<h3>Green Flags that You’re on the Right Track</h3>
<a>anxiety</a> at the beginning, but feeling a sense of understanding,
<a>empathy</a>, and acceptance is a green flag, Howes says. Another is feeling hopeful after a session—feeling
<a>optimistic</a> that with time, change is possible.
