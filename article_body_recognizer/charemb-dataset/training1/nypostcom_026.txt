<h1> Proposed law would strip SUNY’s authority to OK new charter schools in New York</h1>
<div> January 10, 2022 7:48pm <div> Updated <div> January 10, 2022 8:08pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A key state lawmaker overseeing New York City schools has introduced legislation that would block the opening of new charter schools in the Empire State, advocates claim.</p>
<p>The bill unveiled by state Sen. John Liu (D-Queens) would strip the State University of New York Board of Trustees of its authority to greenlight new charter schools.</p>
<p>SUNY officials now have dual authority with the state Board of Regents to issue charter school applications, but Liu’s bill calls for the Regents to approve any charter recommended by SUNY.</p>
<p>“Taking authority away from SUNY trustees would make it much harder for charter schools to open,” the former three-term Republican governor said. “If the bill passes [the Legislature], Gov. Hochul should veto it.”</p>
<p>They typically have a longer school day and school year and staffers in most charters are not union members. </p>
<p>“This bill simply puts SUNY on the same level playing field as other charter authorizers,” Liu said.</p>
<p>Liu said the state Education and the Regents — not SUNY — are the experts on K-12 education.</p>
<p>“What does SUNY know about primary and secondary education? They have their hands full running their colleges and universities,” the senator said.</p>
<p>But James Merriman, CEO of the NYC Charter School Center, said, “This bill would weaken a nationally recognized accountability model by effectively eliminating SUNY and its highly respected board as an authorizer.”</p>
<p>“New York state has one of the most admired public charter school sectors in the country — but this legislation would take us backwards by narrowing parent choice and providing students fewer public school options.”</p>
<p>Columbia Law School professor James Liebman, who has conducted research on charter schools, said, “This bill is a solution to a problem that doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p>Liebman noted that SUNY’s Charter School Institute has a reputation of rigorously reviewing charter school applications and monitoring progress and closing those that perform poorly. </p>
<p>But the bill did receive support from several teachers’ unions.</p>
<p>SUNY trustees are appointed by the governor.</p>
<a>considered the </a>father of the state’s charter school movement, told The Post Monday.
<p>“This power play is not about helping kids. It’s about keeping the support of the unions. It’s disappointing.”</p>
<p>Pataki had pressured state lawmakers to back the charter school law back then by linking it to their wish for long-sought pay raises.</p>
<p>Liu said he expects his revision to the charter school law to pass the Senate after clearing the education committee on Monday. Assembly Education Committee Chairman Michael Benedetto (D-Bronx) will carry the measure in that legislative body.</p>
<p>But the Regents have also fought with SUNY over the opening of two new charter schools in struggling <a>Long Island </a>school school districts.</p>
<p>The dispute over Liu’s bill points to another problem, charter advocates say. The Democratic-controlled Legislature<a> has refused </a>to pass a law to lift the cap to open more charter schools in the city.</p>
<a>for the needy </a>in Harlem,
<a>a second-chance </a> high school in Queens to aid struggling students in danger of dropping out and another other program
<a>focusing on </a>science, math and engineering.
<p>Asked if lawmakers would would relax or eliminate the cap in the 2022 legislative session, Liu said, “Don’t hold your breath.”</p>

<h1> Gov. Hochul mustn’t cave to NY’s spendaholics when she lays out her budget</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 15, 2022 9:09pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 11:59am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul can use her budget presentation Tuesday to prove she’ll be a responsible governor — by avoiding new expenses that lack funding down the road, and instead plugging existing out-year holes.</p>
<p>And this year, the radicals are looking to spend even more, and not just on wholly unaffordable items like single-payer health care. Hochul’s No. 1 task: Don’t dig the hole deeper.</p>
<p>Another recession is inevitable sooner or later, the CBC also rightly warns, yet the state’s rainy-day reserves are insufficient to weather the storm. Hochul needs to shore them up.</p>
<p>School aid, too, is off the charts: New Yorkers spend double the national average per student on education, yet student achievement is far from the top. (Hochul can get far bigger bang for the buck by supporting charter schools.)</p>
<p>If Hochul wants to attract business and promote growth, her best bet would be to lower taxes and roll back counterproductive regulations.</p>
<h1> Glenn Youngkin defends ban on ‘racially divisive’ critical race theory in Virginia</h1>
<div> January 16, 2022 7:44pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 7:45pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Youngkin made the remarks following a decision to issue an executive order banning school lessons that define racism as an institutional problem deeply embedded in American society. </p>
<p>“There’s not a course called critical race theory,” Youngkin said on “Fox News Sunday.”</p>
<a>Youngkin defeated Terry McAuliffe</a>, a former chair of the Democratic National Committee, in November in a race that centered around the issues of critical race theory and parents’ rights to have a say in what their children’s education.

<h1> NY school district sorry for homework calling Mexicans ‘ugly,’ Americans ‘pretty’</h1>

<div> January 17, 2022 10:32am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 10:46am </div> </div> </div>
<p>A Buffalo-area school district has come under fire after a teacher asked her students to translate sentences from English to Spanish that called Mexicans “ugly,” according to reports.</p>
<p>Sixth-graders at Mill Middle School in the Williamsville Central district received a worksheet in Spanish class that prompted them to translate several sentences, CNN reported.</p>
<p>“You (friendly) are Mexican and ugly,” read one of the sentences, while another read, “You (politely) are pretty and American,” the outlet reported.</p>
<p>The “friendly” and “politely” referred to formal and informal ways of saying “you” in Spanish, the Buffalo News reported.</p>
<p>District parent <a>Allison Wainick</a> said she was stunned by the assignment’s “blatant racism.”</p>
<p>Wainick, who is Hispanic and was born in Colombia, declined to identify the teacher, the Buffalo News reported</p>
<p>She told the paper she raised concerns about the assignment with principal Lori Jonas before the winter recess — but declined to say what she thought of the response.</p>
<p>Wainick’s husband, Marcelo Florencio, also told the paper that he was “extremely disappointed with Mill Middle for letting the disgusting and inexcusable language such as this to be presented in the classroom.</p>
<p>“I believe there is no place for it in school or our children’s lives,” said Florencio, a native of Latin America whose kids are multi-ethnic.</p>
<p>Wainick also posted a photo of the assignment on the private Facebook page of the Williamsville Parent Education Connection and asked, “Is this a typical Spanish homework assignment in WCSD these days?”</p>
<p>Other parents expressed their dismay.</p>
<p>“I am absolutely disgusted that this was handed out and I am so sorry for any student who received it,” said one parent, according to screengrabs of the page shared with the Buffalo News.</p>
<p>The district responded to the outcry on its official Facebook page.</p>
<p>“This assignment created by the teacher and provided to students was unacceptable,”<a> it said</a>.</p>
<p>“We are addressing the situation to ensure this does not happen again. The District does not condone any instructional material that denigrates our students, families, culture, or beliefs,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“Our goal as a District is to create an intentionally welcoming learning environment, celebrating our community and its diversity. This assignment fails to meet our standard and will be dealt with appropriately,” the district added.</p>
<p>District spokesman Nick Filipowski told the Buffalo News that officials would have no further comment, including whether the teacher is facing any discipline.</p>
<p>Several people who say they are parents of district students or went to Mill Middle themselves said on social media that school officials have received complaints about offensive and potentially racist behavior by teachers for years, CNN reported.</p>
<p>“Wow. I complained about this assignment at Casey middle…3 years ago. Nothing was done,” one person reportedly wrote.</p>
<p>“Many calls were made and unfortunately fell on mostly deaf ears (with the exception of one amazing guidance counselor that has since retired),” the user added.</p>
<p>Meny Marquez, a Mexican parent whose two children attend the district’s South High School, said he believes that the teacher should face disciplinary action.</p>
<p>“I just know that all the Latin American families in the school district are very offended,” he told CNN.</p>

<h1> High priority: Kathy Hochul vows to launch NY’s legal marijuana industry Cuomo stalled on</h1>
<div> August 25, 2021 7:17pm <div> Updated <div> August 25, 2021 7:17pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul vowed that getting New York’s budding marijuana sales program off the ground will be a high priority.</p>
<p>Scandal-scarred ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the state Legislature approved the law back in March that legalized the sale of weed in New York.</p>
<p>The Senate must confirm the appointments.</p>
<p>The appointments are necessary to set up and approve new rules and licensing for firms and employees in the emerging marijuana industry — from cultivation to sales.</p>
<a>at the MTA</a>. He was ticked off after lawmakers blocked legislation to split the top MTA leadership positions into two posts — and a spokesman even suggested the transit agency appointments and cannabis ones were linked
<p>Hochul on Wednesday promised to clear the logjam.</p>
<p>“We look forward to working with the legislature to keep this process moving forward,” the Hochul rep said.</p>
<p>It’s more than a token gesture.</p>
<p>Hochul has discussed her desire to move on the cannabis appointments with Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D-Yonkers) and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx).</p>
<p>“They have spoken about the need to make appointments to the board,” said Mike Murphy, a spokesman for Stewart-Cousins.</p>
<p>Heastie also said that Hochul made clear that implementation of the marijuana program would be a priority during a private meeting he attended with the new governor and Stewart-Cousins on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“She did say that that was something that she wanted us all to concentrate on — and we agreed,” Heastie said.</p>
<p>Under the law, New York will charge a 13 percent excise tax on marijuana sales, with 9 percent going to the state and 4 percent to local governments.</p>
<p>A wholesale tax will be charged based on potency — a cent per milligram on edibles, eight-tenths of one cent on concentrated cannabis and a half-cent per milligram on flowers or buds.</p>
<p>New York officials estimate that marijuana sales could generate $350 million a year in tax revenue for government coffers and create jobs for residents in disadvantaged communities.</p>
<p>Massachusetts has been selling cannabis at local pot shops since the fall of 2018 — with many customers crossing the border from upstate New York.</p>
<p>New Jersey and Connecticut also recently passed laws legalizing the sale of marijuana for recreational use and are moving to set up rules for the new industry.</p>

<h1> Gov. Cuomo signs bill legalizing recreational marijuana in New York</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> March 31, 2021 11:09am <div> Updated <div> March 31, 2021 12:50pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday signed a bill legalizing recreational marijuana in New York.</p>
<p>The move comes after the state Legislature green-lit the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act after hours of debate late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Certain parts of the new law go into effect immediately.</p>
<p>Anyone with a previous marijuana conviction that would now be legal under the law will have the rap expunged or be resentenced.</p>
<p>The law takes cannabis off the list of controlled substances and allows those who are 21 and older to use the drug freely. Legal marijuana could be sold in licensed dispensaries as soon as next year.</p>
<p>The bill also establishes the Office of Cannabis Management to implement a regulatory framework that covers medical, adult-use and cannabinoid hemp. It also expands the state’s existing medical marijuana and cannabinoid hemp programs.</p>
<p>But it will be some time before stores hawking legal weed appear in the state. </p>
<p>Cities, towns, and villages may opt-out of allowing adult-use cannabis retail dispensaries or on-site consumption licenses by passing a local law by December 31, 2021, or nine months after the effective date of the legislation.</p>
<p>The localities, however, cannot opt-out of the adult-use legalization of cannabis.</p>
<p>Two mayors on Long Island have already vowed to do so in their municipalities.</p>
<p>The adult-use cannabis industry in the state has the potential to bring in $350 million in annual taxes and create 30,000 to 60,000 jobs across the Empire State, officials have said.</p>
<p>All cannabis taxes will be deposited in the state’s special cannabis revenue fund with 40 percent going to education, 40 percent to the Community Grants Reinvestment Fund and 20 percent to the Drug Treatment and Public Education Fund.</p>
<p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio hailed the passing of the bill during his City Hall press briefing shortly before Cuomo signed it into law.</p>
<p>“Last night the state Legislature made history and acted to right a wrong and legalize marijuana the right way,” de Blasio said, adding, “This is a hugely important moment for the state of New York.”</p>
<p>But NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea expressed concerns with the long-term effects and the impact on crime that the legalization of recreational weed would have.</p>
<p>“I worry about what it means for New Yorkers,” Shea told PIX 11 in an interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>The commissioner called it a “significant shift,” as he explained that legalization would mean it is “not going to be a police matter” anymore.</p>
<p>“You pass new laws, you always worry about the unintended consequences,” he said. </p>
<h1> Gov. Hochul’s $216B budget could bring casino gambling to NYC</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 1:40pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 1:53pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul played the ace up her sleeve Tuesday by including a plan that could bring legal casino gambling to New York City in her $216.3 billion budget proposal.</p>
<p>Hochul’s record-breaking spending plan allows the state Gaming Facility Location Board to issue a Request for Applications to open three new gambling parlors in addition to the four already operating upstate.</p>
<p>Budget director Robert Mujica said “no specific designation that they have to be in New York City,” but said it was likely the focus of applications would be on the downstate area.</p>
<p>“There will be a competition for them,” he said of the new licenses.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s announcement followed the launch of legal, app-based sports betting across the Empire State earlier this month.</p>
<p>Assemblyman Gary Pretlow (D-Mount Vernon), chairman of the Standing Committee on Racing and Wagering, hailed Hochul’s plan.</p>
<p>“I love it!” he said.</p>
<p>“We can issue licenses this year and raise anywhere from $1 billion to $2 million in revenues. There will be more jobs and income tax revenues. It’s a win-win-win.”</p>

<p>The Partnership for New York City, the Big Apple’s largest business advocacy organization, will meet with progressive Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg to voice their concerns over details of his stay-out-of-jail free card for criminals.</p>
<p>Some members of the group are so angered by Bragg’s new policies that they are also discussing efforts to recall the newly elected prosecutor, The Post has learned.</p>
<a>Long Island congressman Tom Suozzi</a>, who is running against governor Kathy Hochul in this year’s Democratic primary.
<a>the city crime rate soars.</a>
<p>“I have never heard so much spontaneous upset,” Wylde told The Post. “My members are saying ‘what is this?’ I told Bragg that our members are very upset.”</p>
<p>Wylde immediately emailed Bragg demanding a meeting with the group to clarify his policies. The meeting is set for January 21.</p>
<p>Others say they would rather fight back against the progressives and have launched recall movements.</p>
<p>“Bragg is very bad,” said one NYC business leader who is looking into the Manhattan DA recall effort. “He’s going to be our focus.”</p>

<h1> De Blasio calls on Kathy Hochul to require vaccines for MTA workers</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> November 23, 2021 1:03pm <div> Updated <div> November 23, 2021 3:50pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday called for Gov. Kathy Hochul to require that MTA workers be vaccinated against COVID-19, as he declared New York City’s inoculation mandates have provided “absolute proof” they’re effective.</p>
<p>“It’s worked with a New York City workforce, it can work for the MTA as well,” he added. “We have absolute proof that this effort worked, and it had a tremendously helpful impact on fighting back COVID.”</p>
<a> temporary shuttering</a> of some fire companies due to FDNY members taking sick leave and not getting their shots.
<a>currently subject to a weekly-test-</a>or-vaccine rule, which took effect in October, though the state-run agency
<a> is not checking</a> each worker’s test results.
<p>“So I appreciate the advice that’s coming our way. That’s fine,” the governor continued. “We have a good relationship. But if we have a problem, I’ll address it, but we’re doing an outstanding job.”</p>
<p>Earlier, MTA acting Chairman Janno Lieber brushed aside the mayor’s proposal, lamenting comments he viewed as “poking at” Hochul, while insisting the agency is “confident” in its prevailing pandemic-related policies.</p>
<p>The head of the transportation workers union took a shot at de Blasio, whose tenure in City Hall concludes at the end of the year.</p>
<a>recently taken steps</a> toward launching
<a>a longshot bid</a> to beat out Hochul in the 2022 Democratic primary. State Attorney General Letitia James, who
<a>last month announced</a> her entry into the gubernatorial race, ripped the “state government” over the weekend for its handling of high levels of coronavirus cases in pockets of the Empire State.
<p>Asked Tuesday morning about James’ statement, de Blasio stuck to talking up his own proposal.</p>
<h1> Subway worker shortage threatens NYC’s push to bring workers back to offices</h1>
<div> June 20, 2021 5:35pm <div> Updated <div> June 20, 2021 5:36pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>An MTA worker shortage could derail New York’s push to lure workers back to Manhattan offices — with mass subway cancelations and overcrowded cars.</p>
<p>As around-the-clock services resume and workers return to their commutes, the Big Apple’s public transportation agency is struggling to man the trains, internal records obtained by The Post show.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday marked a pandemic high of over 2.5 million trips, according to official MTA stats — but transit dispatchers had to cancel a whopping 114 scheduled trips because they could not find anyone to drive.</p>
<p>A lack of subway operators or conductors forced the cancellation of 5,355 trains through the first 18 days of June — which is already more than four times the number of canceled services in June 2020. </p>
<p>More than 8,000 scheduled trips were nixed in May, the internal documents show, with June on pace to record more than 8,700 canceled trains. </p>
<p>In pre-pandemic times, just 500 or so of the MTA’s 200,000-plus monthly scheduled trips were canceled because of a lack of workers, sources said.</p>
<p>Compounding the problem, officials have now been forced to spread out the trains that do make it out of the terminal, sources said — which in turn increases wait times and crowding.</p>
<p>“The subway’s convenience hinges on frequent service,” said Danny Pearlstein of Riders Alliance. “Without it, people will choose other modes or continue working from home.”</p>
<p>Insiders said the shortage stems from the COVID-19 pandemic, which killed over 150 transit workers and spurred many hundreds more to retire. </p>
<p>Officials also instituted authority-wide hiring and wage freezes as they mulled <a>massive budget cuts</a> due to depleted ridership.</p>
<p>“The hiring hasn’t kept pace with regular attrition, let alone the attrition because of COVID.”</p>
<p>As a result, Loegel said, “more and more scheduled trips need to be canceled.”</p>
<p>The MTA experienced a net loss of over 2,800 employees since the start of the pandemic, according to official figures. The worker shortage has also plagued MTA bus operations, <a>The Post reported in April</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, New York <a>lags behind</a> other US cities when it comes to workers returning to the office.</p>
<p>Transit management has tried avoid train cancelations by paying out overtime, but sources said it will take months to get the workforce up to size.</p>
<p>Conductors require up to three months of training, while train operators require up to eight — meaning a motorman hired today won’t be driving trains until the beginning of next year. </p>
<p>“You can’t just hire someone and put them on a train,” said Lisa Daglian of the MTA’s in-house advisory council. “There’s an entire process, and that timeline can’t be diminished.”</p>
<p>MTA spokesman Tim Minton on Sunday confirmed the staff shortage’s adverse impact on ridership. </p>
<p>Still, Minton noted that subway “performance continues at historic highs,” and pointed <a>to public stats</a> that show bus performance changed little since September.</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt ongoing crew shortages, as well as some challenging issues with our tracks and signals, had an impact on service in recent weeks,” the rep, Tim Minton, said in a statement. </p>
<p>“We continue to prioritize reliability for our riders and are working as quickly as possible to hire and train new crews as we recover from an unprecedented hiring freeze.”</p>

<p>With a huge new wave of COVID-19 hitting the nation, the coronavirus is once again taking its toll on every aspect of American life, from major sports leagues stopping play to a spike in infections in states from coast to coast. </p>
<p>In New York state, record case counts of over 20,000 per day have hit this week, causing testing lines to stretch for blocks in the five boroughs and causing calls for help from FEMA. </p>

<h1> MTA says to expect longer waits due to COVID crew shortages</h1>
<div> January 2, 2022 5:33pm <div> Updated <div> January 2, 2022 9:55pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Multiple subway lines will be out of commission for the first workday of the year on Monday as COVID-19 surges among the MTA’s workforce, transit officials said.</p>
<p>Other train and bus routes have also suffered delays and cancellations, according to the MTA’s public social media feeds. Friday alone saw 56 scheduled bus runs canceled on the @NYCTBuses Twitter account.</p>
<p>Transit officials have declined to say how many workers have been sidelined by Omicron. Sources across the authority estimate the number to be several thousand.</p>
<p>“The infection rate is very high,” said one insider. “It doesn’t take Dr. Fauci to know that.”</p>
<p>The same hotline also crashed in March 2020, when at least 8,700 employees missed work due to either having or being exposed to COVID-19. Low workforce availability forced the MTA to scale back service, leading to longer wait times for riders.</p>
<p>Call line wait times were no more than five minutes on Sunday, the MTA said.</p>
<p>“When there are operational issues that create hiccups for employee hotline information service, we fix them and continue to provide all necessary support,” Donovan said in a statement.</p>
<a>pandemic hiring freeze</a> that officials do not expect to have recovered from until well into the new year.
<a>are not required</a> to be vaccinated. Gov. Kathy Hochul and MTA leaders in November — before the Omicron wave hit — defended that approach by pointing to low in-house COVID positivity rates.
<a>depends on rider fares</a> — reverted its own desk workers to working from home part-time through Jan. 15, according to a company wide memo obtained by The Post.
<p>More than 170 MTA employees have died from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<h1> Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg likening farebeating to toll evasion is ludicrous — and sends a dangerous message</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 4:41pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 7:23pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“The thesis is clear: The status quo’s not working,” Bragg added. </p>
<a>asked</a> in October 2019, when the MTA began watching live feeds to spot fare evaders.
<p>Similarly, it makes no sense to promote turnstile jumping by signaling to everyone that it’s OK. This is the real effect of Bragg’s hands-off policies: Fare evasion, the MTA says, is at an all-time high. </p>

<h1> ‘Fear is real, justified’: New Yorkers blast Adams on subway crime ‘perception’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 4:52pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 7:49pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Perceive this, Mr. Mayor!</p>
<p>An Upper West Side lawyer said she’s been spending about $500 on Uber rides a month amid the recent spate of shoving incidents that<a> led to the slaying of a woman</a> in the Times Square station on Saturday.</p>
<p>“The fear is real,” said the 31-year-old woman, who gave her name as Monica.</p>
<p>“When you hear incidents that women are being thrown onto the subway tracks you’re scared.”</p>
<p>She added: “Eric Adams can say what he wants to promote ridership but the fear is justified. He needs to do his job, not gaslight New Yorkers.”</p>
<p>Manhattan resident Sam Bennet, 33, said Adams “sounds like a typical politician: big ideas and no legitimate plan.”</p>
<p>“The subways are becoming more and more despicable,” said Bennet, who works for a luxury goods company.</p>
<p>“I’ll continue wasting money on Ubers. This whole situation is f—ked up.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those still brave enough to venture underground said they do so warily, with Hannah Topliff, 25, of Kips Bay saying, “You can’t relax or act timid on the subway — it’s too dangerous.”</p>
<p>“I always stand by a pole on the subway platform, so I can’t be pushed onto the tracks,” she said.</p>
<p>“Saturday’s random attack emphasized that I need to keep standing by a pole while waiting for my train.”</p>
<p>Priscilla Hoffman, 80, said she follows the same strategy whenever she’s “forced to take the subway.”</p>
<p>“I hate the subway. I’m afraid of the hostile homeless,” said Hoffman, who’s lived on the Upper West Side for nearly 50 years.</p>
<p>“The city deteriorated after they took the homeless out of the shelters and put them up in hotels during the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Inwood super Raul Guzman, 67, was at the Dyckman Street station to escort his 20-year-old granddaughter to her job at a Harlem restaurant.</p>
<p>“When I can, I go with her,” he said in broken English.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Adams tried to downplay the death of Michelle Go, 40, who was pushed beneath the wheels of an R train in one of the city’s busiest stations around 9:40 a.m. the previous day.</p>
<p>Adams, a former NYPD transit cop, said statistics show that “New Yorkers are safe on the subway system” while repeatedly invoking the notion of “the perception of fear.”</p>
<a>unprovoked, random slaying</a> is a homeless ex-con with a
<a>history of mental illness</a> — identified by cops as Simon Martial, 61 — who
<a>told reporters he did it </a>“because I’m God.”
<p>Late Monday afternoon, some cops received orders to conduct at least two subway station inspections each shift.</p>
<p>In a prepared statement, an NYPD spokesperson said, “Each day, the Department deploys over 1000 extra officers into the transit system to keep New Yorkers safe.”</p>
<p>Sgt. Edward Riley also said that since Adams’ announcement, “there have been approximately 22,000 Citywide Subway station inspections by Transit and Patrol Officers.”</p>
<p>“The added numbers of station inspections creates an omnipresence that riders, at all hours, can see and feel as they make their way to school, work, or home,” Riley said.</p>
<p>But a Brooklyn cop said, “It doesn’t matter how many cops you put in the subway system.”</p>
<p>“There are not enough cops to cover every station, 24 hours a day,” the cop said.</p>
<p>“It would make more sense to stop these people from fare-beating. If you stop them from coming in, they can’t push innocent people.”</p>
<p>A Manhattan cop echoed that sentiment, saying: “If you don’t control the gate, you can’t control the subway.”</p>

<h1> Yvette Mimieux, ‘The Time Machine’ actress, dead at 80</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 7:53pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 8:17pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Yvette Mimieux, star of the 1960 sci-fi flick “The Time Machine,” has passed away at 80.</p>
<p>She died in her sleep from natural causes on Tuesday morning, her family’s rep confirmed to Deadline. </p>
<p>Mimieux just celebrated her 80th birthday on Jan. 8.</p>
<p>In 1974, she penned a thriller script for Aaron Spelling entitled “Hit Lady.” She played the eponymous assassin in the ABC TV movie.</p>
<p>She also starred in 1976’s “Jackson County Jail,” an edgy crime thriller which had her wrongfully imprisoned and accused of murdering a guard who assaulted her.</p>
<p>During her career, she was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards.</p>
<p>She eventually retired from acting in 1992 after her final TV movie, “Lady Boss.” </p>
<p>Mimieux was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1942 to a French father and Mexican mother. She had two siblings, a sister and a brother.</p>
<p>Mimieux made six movies before she was 21 and gained a reputation for portraying “sensitive” roles. “I suppose I had a soulful quality. I was often cast as a wounded person,” she told the <a>Washington Post </a>in 1979. </p>
<p>She was also known to be extremely private — even in death. No services are planned for the actress, according to Deadline. </p>

<h1> Kyle Richards says goodbye to $6.1M Bel Air home</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 4:10pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 6:38pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>After five years, Kyle Richards and Mauricio Umansky have finally sold their seven-bedroom, nine-bathroom Bel Air abode for $6.1 million, The Post can confirm. </p>
<p>The “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” stars initially listed their sprawling estate for $7 million back in 2017, but were forced to drop the price to $6.495 right before the holidays.</p>
<p>Despite several renovations, Richards and Umansky are still expected to walk away with a profit. They initially purchased the home for $3.05 million back in 2011. </p>
<p>Last year, as they continued to search for a buyer, “RHOBH” co-star Sutton Stracke rented the home from the couple. </p>
<p>The residence almost caught fire due to a fireplace accident, which the castmates later joked about during the Season 11 reunion.</p>
<p>“[Sutton] was a great tenant, although she did almost burn my house down,” Richards told Andy Cohen at the time. “They just did a walk-through, and they were like, ‘Um, the house was almost burned down.’ “</p>

<h1> Andrew Whitworth’s wife savagely trolls JJ Watt after Rams playoff win</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 1:53pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 1:59pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Andrew Whitworth’s wife, Melissa, has a sharp memory, and she wielded it against J.J. Watt on Monday night.</p>
<p>On Oct. 3, after the Cardinals defeated the Rams 37-20 in Week 4 in Los Angeles to bring Arizona to 4-0, Watt posted the meme from the Quentin Tarantino movie — with himself and Chandler Jones.</p>
<p>To the victor go the spoils, and Melissa Whitworth is taking full advantage of the opportunity. </p>
<p>Whitworth, who played through an ankle injury on Monday night, and the Rams take on the Packers in Green Bay on Sunday.</p>
<h1> Ben McAdoo interviewing with Panthers for chance to fix Sam Darnold</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 5:13pm </div>
<p>Can one New York failure save another? The Panthers want to know the answer.</p>
<p>Carolina will interview Ben McAdoo for its offensive coordinator position on Tuesday, The Athletic reported, making it possible the former Giants head coach will be tabbed to fix former Jets quarterback Sam Darnold.</p>
<p>McAdoo, who was fired in late 2017 following a 2-10 start and much-loathed benching of Eli Manning in favor of Geno Smith, worked as a consultant for the Cowboys this season after spending a year as Jacksonville’s quarterbacks coach.</p>
<p>The Panthers are seeking an offensive mind who will prove better than Joe Brady, whom Matt Rhule had hired and then fired in early December while Darnold and the offense flatlined.</p>
<p>“When we protect him and he gets the ball out quick,” Fitterer told reporters, “he looks like a good NFL quarterback.”</p>
<p>Now it’s possible the Panthers give him the latest chance to solve a quarterback the Jets couldn’t.</p>
<h1> Odell Beckham puts playoff demons in past to power Rams’ dominant win</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 12:17am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 1:15am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Odell Beckham Jr. would learn that just because you can be celebrated for a one-handed catch for the ages doesn’t mean that you can’t be thrown overboard following an infamous Boat Trip the previous weekend in Miami. </p>
<p>You can go from hot to cold in a blink of an eye. </p>
<p>Beckham caught four passes for 28 yards, didn’t catch a potential touchdown pass and added a pair of other drops as Manning lost his last shot at a third Super Bowl championship in that 2017 playoff loss in Green Bay. </p>
<p>And Beckham lost his last shot at becoming a New York legend. </p>
<p>His return to the postseason waited until Monday night’s NFC wild-card game against the Cardinals, following an unfulfilling stop in Cleveland with Baker Mayfield. </p>
<p>Dream Teams never guarantee that dreams do come true. </p>
<p>Sean McVay had a Super Bowl dream, and it featured Matthew Stafford replacing Jared Goff and Von Miller joining Aaron Donald and Beckham joining Cooper Kupp. </p>
<p>Dream night at SoFi Stadium for the Rams. </p>
<p>Dream night for McVay, even without his two successful first-half challenges. </p>
<p>Dream night for Stafford (13-for-17, 202 yards, 2 TDs, 0 INTs, 6-22-1 TD rushing). </p>
<p>And dream night for OBJ. </p>
<p>OBJ caught a fade for a 4-yard TD against Marco Wilson in the left corner of the end zone that ignited the Rams’ 34-11 victory over the Cardinals. Caught it with two hands, too. </p>
<p>“Not trying to downplay the moment, it feels very good to get the win,” Beckham said, “but I think our eyes are all focused on something bigger.” </p>
<p>He caught a 31-yard bomb down the left sideline to the Cardinals 2 to position Stafford for the 1-yard QB sneak that made it Rams 14, Cardinals 0. </p>
<p>To that point Monday night, OBJ (4-54-1 TD) had 40 passing yards while Kyler Murray had 28. </p>
<p>Stafford: “Probably could’ve thrown it lefty, too. He’s a freak.” </p>
<p>Miller: “There’s really not much he can’t do.” </p>
<p>Miller contributed a sack while Donald was doing disruptive Donald things — one unnecessary roughness penalty, but plenty of necessary roughness — that cut Murray down to size, as well as sighs. </p>
<p>So yes, Bring on Tom Brady. </p>
<p>Bring on the defending-champion Bucs on Sunday at 3 p.m. at Raymond James Stadium. </p>
<p>“Respected what he did in the past, but it’s a whole new year,” Donald said. </p>
<p>For McVay, it will be a chance to soothe some of the pain from losing Super Bowl LIII to Brady and Bill Belichick in 2019, and this time he will bring a better quarterback to the NFC Divisional Round. </p>
<p>“What a team effort,” Stafford said. </p>
<p>It was McVay’s second challenge — a violent hit on A.J. Green by safety Nick Scott after the ruled catch — that kept Murray backed up at his 4 following a Johnny Hekker punt that had been formed at the 1. </p>
<p>Under pressure from blitzing linebacker Troy Reeder, Murray suffered a shocking meltdown. He held the ball too long in the end zone before attempting a panicked underhand fling that became a 3-yard pick-six gift for CB David Long. </p>
<p>And because he had Beckham on a night when Kupp was mostly a double-teamed decoy. </p>
<p>“He’s a great asset to our team,” Akers said. </p>
<p>Murray, without the semblance of a running game, without DeAndre Hopkins (torn MCL), looked lost. </p>
