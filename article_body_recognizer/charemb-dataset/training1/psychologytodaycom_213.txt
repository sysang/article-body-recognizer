<h2> The Roots of Invalidation </h2>
<div> <h3> Can invalidation lead to poor emotional regulation? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is approval-seeking related to seeking validation? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is praise different from validation? </h3> </div>
<a>praise</a> can feel validating, it does not address the person’s interior landscape.
<div> <h3> Why does forced gratitude feel invalidating? </h3> </div>
<a>gratitude</a> is not an honest behavior. Telling a child, for example, that they should stop thinking what they are thinking and
<a>be grateful</a> only goes so far—comparing a child with others who live in poverty isn’t a winning strategy. There is a point where forcing gratitude becomes delegitimizing. A person cannot be responsible for feeling grateful.

<div> <h3> How can I learn to be more self-validating? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can I learn to be more validating of others? </h3> </div>
<a>empathy</a>. If a person is struggling, help them identify how they feel, and what triggered the feeling as well. Show some empathy even if you feel you are the target of their negativity.
<div> <h3> Is it common to seek approval and validation online? </h3> </div>
<a>approval-seeking online</a> is unfulfilling, it just makes you crave for more. The best way to counter this

<p>Vaping is the term for smoking an electronic cigarette. The device heats liquid, containing nicotine and other chemicals, into a vapor that can be inhaled. They can resemble cigarettes, flash drives, pens, and other objects.</p>

<p>Vaping is dangerous for adolescents, as nicotine can disrupt healthy brain development, which continues until around age 25. Vaping is also not safe for pregnant women, because nicotine can harm both the expectant mother and the developing fetus. </p>
<div> <h3> What does nicotine do to the brain? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What’s the connection between vaping and lung disease? </h3> </div>
<p>The CDC recommends that no one begin using e-cigarettes who doesn’t currently use tobacco products. But those who used e-cigarettes to quit smoking may want to continue in consultation with a doctor.</p>
<div> <h3> What causes EVALI? </h3> </div>
<p>Lung injury appears to be associated with vaping THC, the compound in marijuana that produces the feeling of being high, rather than nicotine. EVALI was also linked to devices that were homemade or acquired from off-brand, underground sources.</p>
<p>Vaping has spread through teen social circles with remarkable speed. One reason is that e-cigarette companies, most notably Juul Labs, directed marketing effortstoward teens, many of whom had never picked up a cigarette.</p>

<p>Dissociation can be terrifying for those who experience it, as well as for their loved ones. But seeking treatment can help people regain their sense of self and lead a fulfilling life.</p>
<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Symptoms and Diagnosis </li> <li> Causes and Risk Factors </li> <li> Treatment and Support </li> </ul> </div>
<h2> Symptoms and Diagnosis </h2>
<p>There are three main dissociative disorders, as listed in the DSM-5. They are Dissociative Identity Disorder, Dissociative Amnesia, and Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder.</p>
<div> <h3> What does it feel like to dissociate? </h3> </div>
<p>Naturally, dissociating often feels scary, especially if the experience feels profound and uncontrollable.</p>
<div> <h3> What does dissociation look like in children? </h3> </div>
<p>Dissociative symptoms like dramatic, abnormal changes in mood, personality, or age, acting in socially inappropriate ways, or insisting on being called by another name can lead to misdiagnoses of psychotic or behavioral disorders.</p>
<p>Underlying all of these symptoms is a tendency for the child to separate parts of themselves, or fragment. This fragmentation is often the result of experienced trauma, which, for children, is often abuse or neglect in the home.</p>
<div> <h3> Is it bad to dissociate? </h3> </div>
<p>Dissociating isn’t always negative. Detaching from reality can be positive, such as in a flow state, or neutral, such as when daydreaming or “spacing out” during a walk.</p>
<p>But in many cases, especially those in which dissociation occurs due to trauma, the experience is deeply distressing, both in the moment and in the aftermath.</p>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Causes and Risk Factors </h2>
<p>Trauma is one of the central reasons why dissociation and dissociative disorders emerge. When faced with tremendous physical or emotional pain, an individual may unconsciously distance themself from the experience.</p>
<div> <h3> What sets dissociation in motion? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do dissociative disorders develop? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is dissociation adaptive? </h3> </div>
<h2> Treatment and Support </h2>
<p>No medications are specifically approved to treat dissociation, but antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs can help with accompanying symptoms.</p>
<p>With support and treatment, individuals can manage dissociation and greatly improve their daily lives.</p>
<div> <h3> How can you help someone who is dissociating? </h3> </div>
<a>skin-brushing is particularly helpful in staying connected to their body and reducing dissociation.</a>
<p>If the person dissociates regularly, ask about their past experience and potential triggers so that you can be ready to help in the future, and explore whether you can help them <a>seek mental health care</a>.</p>
<div> <h3> Can I manage dissociation myself? </h3> </div>
<a>distressing episodes of dissociation,</a> it’s important to seek help. Support and treatment is available, and
<a>finding a therapist</a> can help begin that process. But in the moment, a few strategies can help you stay grounded:
<p>• Engage your senses: For example, name five things you can see or squeeze an ice cube to connect to the world and your sensations.</p>
<p>• Pay attention to your breathing: Feel the air move in through the nose and out through the mouth.</p>
<p>• Focus on an object: Choose a photo, keepsake, or piece of jewelry that can help tether you to your memory and identity.</p>
<div> <h3> What should a therapist do if a patient dissociates? </h3> </div>
<a>fear</a> of how the client will respond, it’s crucial to address dissociation to help the client move forward. The therapist can ask about the cues, topics, or triggers that led to the episode, and explore how to
<a>replace dissociating with healthier coping mechanisms.</a>
<div> <h3> Which techniques can help treat Dissociative Identity Disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>dissociation, six therapeutic tools proved most valuable:</a> building trust between therapist and patient, responding non-defensively, flexible facing, exploring
<a>hypnosis</a> to face traumatic memories without their full force, illustrating the healing process through stories, and asking the patient before addressing different personality states.

<h2> Displacement in Therapy and Mental Health </h2>
<p>Defense mechanisms crop up for everyone from time to time; displacement only interferes with mental health when it becomes habitual or interferes with daily life, such as a job or relationship.</p>
<p>Displacement may relieve distress or preserve self-esteem in the moment but damage well-being over time. The reaction can exacerbate personal problems or relationship conflict while failing to address the underlying problem.</p>

<h2> Displacement in Everyday Life </h2>
<div> <h3> Can displacement affect relationships? </h3> </div>
<a>Displacing emotions onto a friend or romantic partner</a> can drive conflict in relationships. Intense reactions may hurt the other person and fail to resolve the distressing situation. Displaced anger or
<a>aggression</a> is a common example of this. Another is someone who lacks a fulfilling relationship and devotes lots of time and
<a>attention</a> to another person, as a sort of “placeholder” partner.

<p>Defense mechanisms are unconscious strategies whereby people protect themselves from anxious thoughts or feelings.</p>
<p>Defense mechanisms aren’t inherently bad—they can allow people to navigate painful experiences or channel their energy more productively. They become problematic, however, when applied too frequently or for too long.</p>

<h2> 10 Major Defense Mechanisms </h2>
<p>Projection: Attributing one’s unacceptable feelings or desires to someone else. For example, if a bully constantly ridicules a peer about insecurities, the bully might be projecting his own struggle with self-esteem onto the other person.</p>
<p>Denial: Refusing to recognize or acknowledge real facts or experiences that would lead to anxiety. For instance, someone with substance use disorder might not be able to clearly see his problem.</p>
<p>Repression: Blocking difficult thoughts from entering into consciousness, such as a trauma survivor shutting out a tragic experience.</p>
<p>Regression: Reverting to the behavior or emotions of an earlier developmental stage.</p>
<p>Rationalization: Justifying a mistake or problematic feeling with seemingly logical reasons or explanations.</p>
<p>Reaction Formation: Behaving or expressing the opposite of one’s true feelings. For instance, a man who feels insecure about his masculinity might act overly aggressive.</p>
<p>Sublimation: Channeling sexual or unacceptable urges into a productive outlet, such as work or a hobby.</p>
<p>Compartmentalization: Separating components of one’s life into different categories to prevent conflicting emotions.</p>

<h2> Theories of Defense Mechanisms </h2>
<p>Many of Freud’s ideas have not stood up to modern scientific scrutiny. But psychological defenses have proven to be an enduring concept, one that researchers and clinicians continue to explore today.</p>

<div> <h3> Why did defense mechanisms evolve? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are defense mechanisms unhealthy? </h3> </div>
<a>humor</a> to diffuse an uncomfortable situation. Or someone in an emotionally draining profession, such as a counselor for
<a>suicidal</a> individuals, may decide to compartmentalize their work to better function in daily life.
<h2> Defense Mechanisms in Everyday Life </h2>
<div> <h3> When do individuals develop defense mechanisms? </h3> </div>
<a>defense mechanisms might occasionally reappear</a> to alleviate the stress.
<div> <h3> Which defense mechanisms can hurt relationships? </h3> </div>
<a>we turn to defenses</a> to manage those emotions. Yet this can lead to more anxiety by driving a wedge into the relationship, so it’s valuable to reflect on whether you or your partner use certain defenses. These include:
<p>• Projection: Do you blame your partner for your own flaws? Rather than admit it, do you accuse your partner of being messy or careless?</p>
<p>• Denial: Do you pretend that negative experiences haven’t occurred? Do you close your eyes and think that everything is going to be fine, even when your partner seems upset?</p>

<div> <div> <a> Why Certain People Get So Defensive </a> </div> <div> A close work or personal relationship with a highly defensive person can cause severe stress and frustration. These relationships lack validation and fairness. </div> </div>
<div> Our defenses must be invisible to us, for if were we to become aware of them and how we use them to alter reality, we would no longer be able to believe our distorted reality. </div>
<div> Because most defense mechanisms are frozen in time and space, and don’t know how old you are, they act like “parentified children,” sabotaging efforts to reach coveted adult goals. </div>

<div> <h3> Do emotions differ across cultures? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does culture affect how we think about happiness? </h3> </div>
<a>culture can influence how one thinks about happiness.</a> Research indicates that people in different cultures vary in how much value they place on happiness and how much they focus on their own well-being. Culture may also affect
<a>how people believe happiness should be defined and achieved</a>—whether a good life is to be found more in individual self-enhancement or through one’s role as part of a collective, for example.
