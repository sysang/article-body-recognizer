<div><div><p>Later, we are chatting with a trio of 50-something hikers from Flagstaff, when one of them interrupts herself: “Just so you know: There’s a bighorn sheep walking across the cliff right behind you.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But when we march out of Monument Creek at 7:30 a.m., with cool mist billowing down from the rim, I’m optimistic. Kai sets a brisk pace as the trail lurches up from the wash, then levels for the long haul.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But when we round the next bend it becomes clear just how far the trail goes before doubling back toward the river. Alas, they are at least an hour ahead.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>So how do the locals do ski season? I spent four days finding out.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>How to lock down lift tickets</div></h3></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>How to save money on skis</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you’re going to ski more than a day or two, Dahlby said it’s also a good idea to buy multi-resort season passes like IKON — although those must be purchased well in advance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I rented my gear online from JHMR, which came with a 20 percent discount. I heard later that you can sometimes find cheaper rates on a rental by going to shops in town (although JHMR owns many of them).</p></div></div>
<div><p>Winter is right around the corner. Are you ready for ski and snowboard season?</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How to find an affordable room</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Many tourists prize direct access to ski resorts, but Dahlby recommends staying in town. Not only are you more likely to find a better room rate, you will get a taste of local culture.</p></div></div>
<a>Cache House hostel</a> for an affordable (for me) $80 a night. Then I moved to the Lodge at Jackson Hole, a modest place surrounded by strip malls that runs more than $500 per night during the high season. It cost me about $170.

<div><div><p>In the back of Rachele’s office at Jackson Hole Mountain Guides, he says the annual glut of visitors does not diminish his experience on skis.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>A guide to road tripping with a baby, in 9 highway-tested steps</h1></div>
<h2>The back seat is your new best friend</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div>Staff writer </span></div></span></div><div>November 13, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The “poop-tastrophe” at the Canadian border — as one of her children coined it — still haunts Nasreen Stump. And then there was the carsickness episode in a rental car in Seattle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve put a lot of miles in with a lot of kids, and had a lot of unfortunate experiences along the way,” said Stump, a mother of four in Texas who writes for the family travel site TravelingMom.com.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The following nine tips are lessons only a parent with some miles under their belt could deliver.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Should you travel with kids during the pandemic? Consider these 6 trip scenarios.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Get your car checked before you leave</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Need an oil change, tire replacement or air-conditioner check? Get that done before heading out. When there’s a fussy baby on your lap and all your bags are strapped to the roof, an auto repair shop is the last place you want to end up.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Digitize your packing list</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Have that stash of your medicines ready,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And don’t forget a bag with extra personal protective equipment and hand sanitizer.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Can you still cancel a flight at the last minute? Your holiday travel questions, answered.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Throw the ETA out the window</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Google Maps says you’ll arrive in six hours? What a fun fantasy! Your GPS is not the boss of the baby.</p></div></div>
<p>American Academy of Pediatrics spokeswoman Dina DiMaggio, a doctor at Pediatric Associates of NYC and at NYU Langone Health, <a>recommends</a> stopping every two to three hours for feeding, diaper changing and taking a break from the car seat.</p>
<div><div><p>Dirty diapers or meltdowns might require more frequent stops, so patience is key.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lanin suggests mapping out pit stops in advance, and being realistic about how much time they’ll add to your trip.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Babies and toddlers are not great at being stuck in the same place for hours and hours on end,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Timing the drive to avoid traffic is also a good idea, Stump said. Ever sat in a traffic jam with a screaming baby? It’s not great!</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to travel with your pet this holiday season</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Join baby in the back seat</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stump recommends bath toys and books for road trips because they can be inexpensive and “really easy to sanitize.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Make your car a rest stop</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maybe some parents with an unvaccinated, too-young-to-mask baby feel comfortable strolling into a rest stop, sitting in the food court and using a diaper changing station in the restroom. My family is not.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Keep the baby’s schedule consistent</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>If the kid naps every three hours, try to maintain that timeline in the car. If white noise is helpful, bring a portable machine or use an app. Do they have a favorite bedtime song or book or cuddly toy? Keep those handy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How my wife and I have traveled with our kid, from 12 weeks old to toddler</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Know your lodging needs</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They should call ahead multiple times or travel with something for the baby to sleep in, just in case,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Prepare for a mess (or two)</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Both Stump and Lanin offered the same one-word advice: “buckets.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Have you seen how babies and toddlers throw up?” Lanin said. “They don’t aim.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A good receptacle is important for kids who get queasy from carsickness or the stomach flu. Stump likes a collapsible beach bucket because it folds up flat for easy storage.</p></div></div>
<a>Montreal</a>, she added layers of protection to the car. That includes waterproof covers that are meant for babies to wear over cloth diapers and replacement covers for an infant seat.
<div><div><p>“Never again on a road trip without backups on those things,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Always, always check the fridge</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>My toughest lesson came on an otherwise stress-free morning. I congratulated myself on being ready to check out of the hotel early — with two dogs and a 7-month-old — on the final leg of a trip home to D.C. from Florida.</p></div>

<header><div><h1>You asked: How do I find a coronavirus test in a foreign country? </h1></div><h2>By The Way Concierge offers a first-person look at following the U.S. in-bound testing rule</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 17, 2021|Updated December 17, 2021 at 12:58 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p><i><b>“Please explain how you can obtain a coronavirus test for reentry to the U.S. when you do not know the location, cost, procedure or language to get this service.” </b></i>— <i><b>Philip B., Ijamsville, Md.</b></i></p></div>
<a>must show results of a negative rapid or PCR test</a> they took within one day of flying into the United States. The rule, which was
<a>updated</a> in December following the discovery of the
<a>omicron variant</a>, applies to vaccinated people, too. If you’ve recovered from a case of covid-19 in the past 90 days, you can provide a doctor’s note from a licensed health-care provider.
<div><div><p>Your airline is supposed to review your test result before you get on the plane home, and if you don’t have it or did it incorrectly, you may be denied boarding.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here’s the thing: The international tourism industry — from hotels to destinations to airlines — needs travelers again. That means if you’re going somewhere people want to travel, you should be able to get a test.</p></div>
<a>Drew Binsky</a> — who has been to more than 15 countries during the pandemic — told me finding a test in some places has been difficult (he specified Mauritania and Afghanistan), but never impossible.
<div><p>“As soon as you arrive in any country, your mission should be to find out WHERE and HOW to get tested before you leave,” Binsky said via Instagram message from Palau. “Usually they will know at the airport.”</p></div>
<div><p>What Americans need to know about finding a coronavirus test abroad</p></div>
<a>“COVID-19 Information” page</a> that includes a testing section where you will find advice on getting a test, whether results are reliably available, how much it should cost and more.
<a>this BinaxNOW kit</a> with me to France this summer. A friend had told me that the same test didn’t work for her once, so I brought a backup. I also knew that if it didn’t work, I would be able to get a test at a pharmacy or the airport.
<div><div><p>Of course, you don’t have to pack your own test. Many hotels offer to arrange testing to take some of the stress off travelers, but the specifics will vary from property to property.</p></div></div>
<div><p>American tourists are back in Europe, but so are covid restrictions</p></div>
<div><div><p>If the hotel, doctor or clinic offers results only online or via email, Smith recommends travelers request a physical copy to take to the airport as a backup, as well as taking a photo of them to keep on their phone.</p></div></div>
<a>TravelBash</a>, says her biggest advice for clients is to know exactly what tests you need (not just for the United States, but also any country you’re transiting through) and to arrange your test as soon as possible.
<div><div><p>“As soon as you get to the resort, schedule it,” Nichols says.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Passport delayed? 5 places you can go without one.</p></div>
<a>LaVon Travel Lifestyle</a>, says she has heard of many people denied boarding because of ill-timed tests.
<a>recommend buying covid-specific travel insurance</a> to cover the unknown (if you test positive, if your travel plans go haywire, if you need to be hospitalized). We’re still in a pandemic,
<a>new variants bring new complications</a>, and it’s impossible to predict how your trip will go.
<div><div><p>“Changes are happening fast, and changes may also happen while you’re traveling,” Layne says.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>You asked: My Airbnb host won’t refund me. How can I get my money back? </h1></div><h2>In this installment of By The Way Concierge, we return to refund woes </h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>June 17, 2021 at 12:55 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<i><b>“Airbnb host refused to refund me even though Airbnb has asked multiple times. Am I entitled to a refund? I have met all the Extenuating Circumstances besides canceling the reservation myself.”</b></i>
<i><b>Melissa K., Lynnfield, Mass.</b></i>
<div><p>Submit your travel dilemmas</p></div>
<div><div><p>That last part is important. Sometimes people are eligible for a refund under that Extenuating Circumstances policy, but if they cancel at the wrong time — i.e. too early or too late — they lose that eligibility.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Everything you need to know for the return of travel</p></div>
<div><div><p>At that point, you’re at the mercy of the host. It’s <a>not impossible</a> to get an Airbnb host to give you a refund, but it could be an uphill battle.</p></div></div>
<a>Thrifty Traveler</a>, told me. “Airbnb has expanded its policies, some for ‘extenuating circumstances’ in the last year, but it seems that’s clearly not enough to help out travelers when owners don’t play nice.”
<div><div><p>In the case that your host agrees to a full or partial refund — and is actually willing to go through with it — then you can contact Customer Support, which will process your refund.</p></div></div>
