<p>1. Its clinical name. Bipolar Disorder is sometimes referred to by its older clinical name, Manic Depression. Bipolar Disorder is a <a>mood disorder</a> that greatly interferes with the quality of life for a child or adult.</p>
<p>2. There are three types of Bipolar Disorder.</p>
<a>mania</a> as well as a single episode of depression. Symptoms are very intense and if left untreated often require hospitalization.
<li>Bipolar II: Sometimes called "soft bipolar," Bipolar II involves a less intense form of mania, called hypomania. To qualify for this disorder, a person has to have had an episode of hypomania and an episode of depression.</li>
<li>Cyclothymia: People with Cyclothymia experience symptoms of hypomania and symptoms of mild depression. The episodes of Cyclothymia tend to be shorter, but are chronically present for at least two years.</li>
<p>3. Mania. This involves, at its core, an elevated state of mood and energy or activity. The type of Bipolar Disorder diagnosis will depend on the texture of the mania:</p>
<a>hypersexuality</a> occur. Mania can also elevate to extreme levels where disorientation, incoherence, delusions,
<a>paranoia</a>, and violence erupt. Mania greatly interferes with daily living.
<a>hypomanic</a> episode, and an extremely sad or hopeless state is called a depressive episode.
<p>5. Mixed States. Individuals can experience mania/hypomania and depression at the same time. This is called a mixed state. Children and adults in a mixed state may feel very sad or hopeless while also feeling extremely energized.</p>
<p>6. Cycling. There are two types of mood elevation cycles that individuals who have a type of Bipolar Disorder move through.</p>
<li>Rapid cycling: This type of cycle includes episodes of mood elevation and depression followed by another cycle of mood elevation and depression four or more times per year.</li>
<li>Ultrarapid cycling: Unlike rapid cycling — where episodes occur every few months — children and adults can experience abrupt cycling of mania/depression or hypomania/depression weekly or even hourly.</li>
<a>Medication</a>. Scientific research urges medication
<a>management</a> as a vital part of the treatment of Bipolar Disorders. Specifically, the use of a
<a>antidepressant</a> medications are recommended in all phases of treatment — for children as well as adults.
<a>Psychotherapy</a>. Along with medication management, psychotherapy is recommended to manage Bipolar Disorder.
<a>Evidence-based therapies</a> such as
<a>Cognitive Behavioral</a> Therapy, Psychodynamic Psychotherapy, Family-Focused Therapy, Interpersonal Psychotherapy, and Psychoeducational Approaches are recommended.
<a>chronic illness</a>. Learning how to take care of one's self is important. In addition to eating well, keeping a healthy
<a>sleep cycle</a> and exercising, creating time to nurture one's mind, body, and soul is helpful.

<h1> Best Practices for Identifying and Treating Bipolar Disorder </h1>
<h2> How to avoid common pitfalls when diagnosing and treating bipolar disorder. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Bipolar Disorder? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist to treat bipolar disorder</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Most estimates suggest that about 2% of adults have <a>bipolar disorder</a>, but depending on the epidemiological data used, some studies put the figure as high as 10%.</p>
<p>There has also been a surge of children diagnosed with bipolar in recent years. The trend has led to earlier and more effective treatment in many cases, but it has also raised concerns about overdiagnosis.</p>
<p>Ensure Depression Isn’t Really Bipolar</p>
<a>mood disorder</a>, and should not assume that symptoms of depression necessarily mean that depression is the correct diagnosis. Likewise, it’s important to ensure that cyclical depression is not incorrectly diagnosed as bipolar disorder.
<p>Consider Other Diagnoses</p>
<a>mindful</a> that not all symptoms that mimic bipolar are due to bipolar, and that a bipolar diagnosis does not necessarily rule out other diagnoses.
<a>attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder</a> (ADHD),
<a>traumatic brain injuries</a>,
<a>personality disorders</a>, and numerous other conditions may mimic bipolar.
<p>Choose the Right Pharmacological <a>Therapy</a></p>
<p>People with bipolar disorder typically need pharmacological therapy, but choosing the right drug or drug combination often requires some trial and error. Some general principles include:</p>
<li>Start with mainline treatments.</li>
<li>Start with a low dose, and gradually increase depending on tolerance and response.</li>
<li>Don’t add multiple drugs at once.</li>
<li>Discuss treatment options with the patient, and actively encourage them to provide feedback.</li>
<p>Monitor for Side Effects and Efficacy</p>
<p>Bipolar <a>relapse</a> rates are high, and the reason for this remains poorly understood. Research indicates that after a year, more than a third of people with well-controlled bipolar will relapse. At two years, relapse rates are above 60%.</p>
<p>Discuss Psychosocial Aspects of Bipolar</p>
<a>stress</a>, and other challenges often figure prominently. So while bipolar is a biochemical disorder, it also has deep psychosocial roots. Clinicians should discuss the role of environment, lifestyle, and
<a>social life</a> in bipolar, and encourage patients to identify common triggers for mood swings. Patients who are experiencing heightened levels of stress may need more frequent appointments and additional support to manage bipolar symptoms.
<p>Recommend Therapy and Lifestyle Changes</p>
<p>Therapy is critical for the effective treatment of bipolar, for several reasons:</p>
<li>Therapy offers psychoeducation that can improve medication compliance.</li>
<li>Therapy can help patients better cope with the challenges of bipolar.</li>
<li>Therapy may offer useful lifestyle remedies for managing bipolar.</li>
<li>Therapy can help friends and family support a loved one with bipolar.</li>
<li>Therapy offers immediate support for crises that might trigger a <a>manic</a> or depressive episode.</li>

<a>suicide</a>. Researchers have found signs of
<a>chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a>, a disease caused by repetitive brain trauma, in
<a>76 of 79 deceased NFL players </a>including Dave Duerson, Junior Seau and other football players who had lost their lives to suicide. The phenomenon even has its own
<a>Wikipedia entry</a>. (Sadly,

<p>But what about the people who don’t die? Like football players, are they at risk for suffering long-term psychological distress? Or are these consequences reserved for people who have experienced more severe forms of brain injury?</p>
<p>What is a traumatic brain injury?</p>
<a>Phineas Gage</a>, a man whose brain was pierced by a tamping iron during a railroad construction accident, also had a TBI. A stroke, on the other hand, would not be a TBI, since the damage originates internally rather than externally.
<p>Unfortunately, these latter symptoms often go ignored.</p>

<a>four times more likely to develop a mental illness</a>. People who had received a TBI were 65 percent more likely to develop schizophrenia, 59 percent more likely to develop depression and 28 percent more likely to develop
<a>bipolar disorder</a>. This study is the largest of its kind and involved following 1.4 million Danish citizens born between the years 1977 and 2000.
<a>found</a> that mice that had sustained a TBI demonstrated increased depressive symptoms as well as higher-than-normal levels of neural inflammation. (I have previously written about
<a>mental illness’ surprising link to inflammation</a>). Yet
<a>another study</a> found that experiencing depressive symptoms after a head injury is more common than not — the prevalence of depression after TBI is greater than 50 percent.
<p>The most frightening piece of research, however, was published earlier this year: People who had received a concussion in the past were <a>three times more likely to fall victim to suicide.</a></p>

<a>most people treat concussions:</a> a short visit to the emergency room, bed rest, and painkillers. They were not war veterans or football players. They were individuals who left a car accident with just a headache and a sore neck, or a student

<a>therapy</a> patients and their family members can have any number of reactions when first introduced to the diagnosis of
<a>bipolar disorder</a>. Disbelief and
<a>denial</a> are typical responses, but they may also believe they did something bad to bring bipolar into their lives. Or that there is something distinctly flawed with who they are as human beings. They may have carried a sense of
<a>shame</a> for years, not fully prepared to deal with the reality of a chronic mental illness. But the truth is, nobody is at fault for having bipolar disorder.
<a>psychotic</a> symptoms? Did anyone need serious
<a>hormonal</a> changes, such as during
<a>postpartum</a> women, or can be the result of self-
<a>medication</a> with drugs or
<a>hypomania</a> and depression, they're simply in a baseline mood zone. Moods can swing rapidly or slowly through baseline, so it’s important to understand that bipolar disorder is always present in the
<a>genetics</a> and neurology of the individual, whether the symptoms of bipolar are presently active or not. Once bipolar disorder is accurately identified, it has been and always will be a part of that person’s life.
<p>That may seem like bad news to many. If you have bipolar, you may feel like cursing your ancestors for such a fate.</p>

<h2> Here's how to tell the difference between the two. </h2>

<a>self-harm</a>, or suicidal thoughts or actions that could have occurred at any time in life. There certainly may be other explanations for these, such as early life
<a>trauma</a> or severe loss and
<a>grief</a> experienced during these formative years. But if explosive behaviors or deep depression occurred at different times, especially with little or no provocation, it can point to underlying bipolar disorder.

<a>psychotic</a> symptoms, such as hallucinations, should be reported immediately, as these can be life-threatening. Any
<a>antidepressants</a> will either likely be eliminated at this point, or possibly paired with a mood stabilizing or antipsychotic drug to keep a lid on mania.

<a>bipolar disorder</a>, a serious
<a>psychiatric</a> condition that often begins in
<a>manic episodes</a> involving euphoria, inflated
<a>self-image</a>, high irritability and agitation, decreased desire to sleep, racing thoughts or impulsive, often destructive behaviors. They also can go through periods of profound depression, which can include feelings of low

<a>DNA</a>. As the brain develops, these genetic factors affect how the brain handles
<a>hormonal</a> changes, as well as increased social and academic pressures that can all become catalysts for bipolar symptoms. But pre-pubescent children can also express symptoms of bipolar.
<a>Self-harm</a> and early problems with
<a>substance abuse</a> are also common, and should be immediately addressed with the proper treatment professionals.

<h1> You Have to Feel to Heal: Emotional Awareness </h1>
<h2> Suppressed emotions can be dangerous and damage your memory. </h2>
<li>Repressed/suppressed emotions fire up the nervous system even more than expressed unpleasant ones. </li>
<li>Since we cannot escape our consciousness, we have a relentless source of pain unique to humans. </li>
<li>Allowing yourself to feel emotional pain is a necessary step in rerouting your brain away from it. </li>

<h3>The consequences of repression/suppression</h3>
<a>repression</a>/suppression of emotions keep your flight-or-fight response fired up, but it also can cause brain damage. The hippocampus is an important structure in your brain that is at the center of
<a>positive thinking</a>. Both of those block connection to your emotions.
<a>abyss of pain</a>, but they often end up leading a life that they never knew was possible. It is moving onto these more enjoyable neurological circuits that creates healing.
<p>Being aware of our inborn tendency to be judgmental is another important awareness that will be discussed next. You will see that the need to engage in this process is a way of avoiding emotional awareness. </p>
<h3>Questions and considerations</h3>
<li>Have you ever wondered why you don’t want to feel unpleasant emotions? You are being physically threatened. It is because they are painful because pain has a common neurological circuitry, whether the pain is mental or physical.</li>
<li><a>Anxiety</a> is the sensation generated by your body’s chemistry when you are in flight or fight. It is intended to be so unpleasant that you are forced to take action to escape. We will do almost anything to avoid it.</li>
<li>It is ironic that the main strategy we use, suppression/repression is the worst choice. In addition to depleting your life energies, it can cause damage to your brain. You do have to feel to heal.</li>
<li>Consider your situation. You may be suffering from physical pain, but what about your anxiety? Which one is more challenging to deal with?</li>
<li>Fortunately, as you solve your mental pain, the physical symptoms usually abate. </li>

<h1> The Guilt of Living with Chronic Pain </h1>
<h2> Questioning the legitimacy of a person’s pain induces guilt and worsens pain. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Coping With Guilt </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>One in five people suffer from chronic pain conditions, such as lower back pain, migraine headaches, fibromyalgia, and arthritis pain.</li>
<li>Chronic pain patients may feel guilty or even feel like a fraud when others, including doctors, question the legitimacy of their pain.</li>
<li>Health providers need to validate and reassure chronic pain patients while working with them to find treatments that work.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: jane_lopatkina/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Danijela Serbic</a> and colleagues, in press in the British Journal of Health Psychology, suggests
<a>chronic pain</a> is associated with “pain and pain interference, functional impairment, and poorer psychological and social functioning.”
<p>But why should chronic pain patients feel guilty? How does guilt affect pain symptoms? And how can we help pain patients avoid guilty feelings?</p>
<p>Before we consider some answers provided by the study, let's first define chronic pain.</p>
<p>Pain is an aversive experience, usually involving unpleasant sensations (e.g., tight, sharp, burning, tender, or throbbing sensations) and negative emotions (e.g., <a>fear</a>, <a>anger</a>, sadness, distress).</p>
<a>irritable bowel syndrome</a>, post-surgical pain, neuropathic pain (e.g., related to diabetes), cancer pain, arthritis pain, and
<a>one in five</a> people around the world and is linked with
<a>depressed</a> mood, negative changes in
<a>identity</a> and social roles, and disability. It is also highly costly—in terms of medical costs, informal care provided by the family, absenteeism or reduced
<a>productivity</a> at work, etc.
<h3>Chronic Pain and Guilt</h3>
<p>Many people living with chronic pain experience pain-related guilt. Why? Let us look at the research.</p>
<p>Synthesis of the qualitative evidence revealed these guilt-related themes:</p>
<p>The results of the quantitative synthesis were grouped into the following categories:</p>
<li>Pain and pain interference: Pain-related guilt was positively associated with pain behaviors and with pain interference with relationships, sleep, work, etc.</li>
<li>Functional impairment: Guilt correlated with worse physical functioning and greater fatigue and disability.</li>
<li>Psychological functioning and coping strategies: Pain-related guilt was linked with diagnostic uncertainty, lower pain acceptance, and greater pain <a>catastrophizing</a> (more magnification, rumination, and helplessness).</li>
<li>Psychological functioning and emotions: People who experienced pain-related guilt tended to feel <a>anxious</a>, depressed, and angry.</li>
<li>Social functioning: Guilt correlated with <a>social isolation</a> and perceived criticism (e.g., by treatment providers).</li>
<li>Demographics: Here, the results were inconsistent. While one investigation found women felt more pain-related worry and guilt, another investigation found no <a>gender</a> differences.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: artbykleiton/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In summary, guilt in chronic pain patients is linked with worse pain, physical functioning, social functioning, and psychological adjustment.</p>

<p>So, how can we help those living with chronic pain reduce their guilt?</p>
