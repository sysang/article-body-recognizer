<p>There is also an inherent value in preserving this rugged frontier.</p>
<p>“We think it’s important to show leadership on this issue and really drive forward as fast as we can. Some distillers will get there much sooner than that. We think it’s ambitious but achievable.”</p>
<p>While renewable energy technologies come into play, already Glengoyne has proven innovative in the way it cares for its local environment, a picturesque valley with sweeping mist.</p>
<p>“In many ways the wetlands are a wonder. It’s an amazing technology that has been right under our noses for generations. We’re utilising the power of plants, so that’s really important. They’ve been underappreciated,” he said.</p>
<p>“This product comes from the land of fresh air and wild wilderness. I do not see the story of scotch whisky being a polluting story,” Dallas said.</p>
<p>“We are proud of where we come from and our landscapes. If scotch whisky can be part of the vanguard of making this a greener landscape and economy then that is something to be proud of. It’s our duty to lead the charge.” </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Philippine typhoon survivors wish for roofs and food at Christmas </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>ALEGRIA, Philippines: Father Ricardo Virtudazo stands in a pool of water in his typhoon-hit church in the southern Philippines delivering Christmas Day mass to dozens of devotees whose wishes this year were for new roofs, food and fine weather.</p>
<p>More than a week after Typhoon Rai cut a swathe through the archipelago, killing nearly 400 people and leaving hundreds of thousands homeless, survivors clung to family and faith after their homes - and planned festivities - were wiped out.</p>
<p>"What's important is all of us are safe," said Joy Parera, 31, attending Christmas mass with her husband at San Isidro Labrador Parish church in the town of Alegria, on the northern tip of Mindanao island.</p>
<p>A light rain soaked the pews and white tiled floor of the damaged church, which has been left with a gaping hole in the roof after Rai ravaged the area.</p>
<p>Devotees wore masks as they gathered inside the church festooned with Christmas decorations and prayed for a better year.</p>
<p>"We still have hope," Virtudazo told AFP.</p>
<p>"In spite of the calamities they experience, they still have faith in God."</p>
<p>Christmas is one of the most important events on the Christian calendar and in the Catholic-majority Philippines, families typically gather to share a meal.</p>
<p>But the widespread destruction caused by Rai in the southern and central regions of the country has dampened celebrations as many survivors plead for drinking water and food.</p>
<p>Mindanao, Siargao, Dinagat and Bohol islands are among the most devastated by the storm, which knocked out electricity, tore off roofs, shredded wooden buildings, felled concrete power poles and uprooted trees.</p>
<p>The scale of the damage, lack of mobile phone signal or internet in many areas, and depleted government coffers after the COVID-19 response were hampering efforts to distribute aid.</p>
<h2>"WE'LL MAKE DO WITH SPAGHETTI"</h2>
<p>Nardel Vicente said his Christmas wish was for someone to help him buy a new roof for his house in Alegria after it was wrecked by Rai, which hit the country on Dec 16 as a super typhoon.</p>
<p>Jobless and with little money to spare, Vicente said his family would not be able to prepare a festive meal this year.</p>
<p>"In previous years we had spaghetti, pork, chicken - whatever we could afford between us," the 38-year-old said.</p>
<p>But he added: "That's ok - we're alive. It's better than welcoming Christmas with a dead loved one."</p>
<p>Marites Sotis usually serves up meat, spring rolls and salad for her family.</p>
<p>"We won't have those this year because they cost a lot of money," Sotis, 53, told AFP in the coastal municipality of Placer where the storm felled most of her family's coconut trees.</p>
<p>"We'll make do with spaghetti."</p>
<p>Some survivors in nearby Surigao City have been standing on roads for days begging for money and food from passing motorists after failing to receive a scrap of government assistance.</p>
<p>Inaga Edulzura, 41, said she hoped to get a packet of spaghetti to cook for her family. Otherwise, they would "make do with sliced bread".</p>
<p>"Our only request is that there's fine weather on Christmas Day to give us some cheer," she told AFP.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> ‘I could only cry and scream’: Instances of bride kidnapping in rural Indonesia prompt calls to abolish practice </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Kiki Siregar </a> </div> </div>
<p>JAKARTA: Ms Melati was feeding her 11-month-old son outside of her brother’s house on Sumba island last month, when a group of men suddenly approached her. </p>
<p>They dragged her away from her child. </p>
<p>Ms Melati, not her real name, screamed, thrashed and tried to free herself from the more than a dozen men who she did not know.</p>
<p>“I felt I was almost dying. I could only cry and scream,” the 23-year-old told CNA.</p>
<p>“There was nothing I could do. There were many of them,” she recounted.</p>
<p>Her brother and father, who were in her brother’s house at the time of the incident, saw Ms Melati being carried away.</p>
<p>They tried to free her, but were outnumbered by the perpetrators.</p>
<p>Ms Melati was taken to a pickup truck. As the vehicle drove away, a few men held her feet and hands tightly to prevent her from jumping off the vehicle.</p>
<p>She tried to bite the men who held her, but to no success as they maintained a tight grip.</p>
<p>The men did not tell her what was happening, but as a Sumbanese, Ms Melati guessed that she was a victim of a local practice known as ‘capture and wed’, a form of bride kidnapping.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Driven by passion, young vet travels across Indonesia to rescue large marine animals</a></h3>
<p>They eventually arrived at a house where many people had already gathered.</p>
<p>Ms Melati was then carried into an empty room, where she was free to move as it was unlocked.</p>
<p>She thought about running away. But as there were too many people in the house, she decided to stay put and hope that her family would rescue her.</p>
<p>At night, she was introduced by the owners of the house to a man they said was her groom-to-be.</p>
<p>“The man looked at me,” Ms Melati recounted.</p>
<p>“He then told his parents: ‘Yes, I like her. I would like to marry her.’</p>
<p>“But I then screamed: ‘I don’t like you! I have a baby! I have a partner!’”</p>
<p>Ms Melati spent the night alone in the room unable to sleep, afraid of what the perpetrators would do next to her.</p>
<p>Fortunately, at midday the following day, her relatives came with the police and human rights activists to free her. The perpetrators apologised and she was taken home.</p>
<p>Instances of bride kidnapping are not unknown in Sumba, East Nusa Tenggara province. </p>
<p>The phenomenon has gained attention in Indonesia recently, after a video circulated online last month. </p>
<p>In the now viral video, a woman, not Ms Melati, was seen being carried by five shirtless men who held her tightly while she cried.</p>
<p>While Ms Melati and activists demand that the practice be abolished as it is a violation of women’s rights, others note that the issue is not so straightforward. </p>
<p>Gender roles have been entrenched, while enforcement can be problematic. </p>
<p>“I’M NOT CONVINCED IT CAN BE ENTIRELY ABOLISHED”: LOCAL PARLIAMENTARIAN</p>
<p>Head of East Sumba parliament Ali Oemar Fadaq said that the ‘capture and wed’ practice has long been a debatable issue on the island.</p>
<p>“It does not happen often (in East Sumba). It is also debatable if someone claims it is a tradition. But it does occur,” Mr Fadaq told CNA.</p>
<p>He said that several incidents had ended with the women marrying the men, but he is not aware if such practices have ever ended in a divorce.</p>
<p>Mr Fadaq said he knows such couples who are happily married.</p>

<p>Even though he is against it, Mr Fadaq said it is hard to prevent bride kidnapping because nobody knows when it happens.</p>
<p>“It can happen in villages, everywhere. I am not convinced that it can be entirely abolished because we cannot control it.</p>
<p>“It just happens suddenly at a place and then it becomes viral because nowadays people have handphones,” Mr Fadaq said.</p>
<p>To prevent it from happening, Mr Fadaq said the government must work hard to educate people that it is not allowed for women to be abducted. </p>
<p>The incident in the viral video happened in Central Sumba on Jun 16, just a week before Ms Melati was abducted, according to activists and local authorities.</p>
<p>A 21-year-old woman was taken from her uncle’s house by five men to a neighbour’s house.</p>
<p>The video shows the victim screaming while being carried by the men, but the abductors ignore her objections.</p>
<p>Activists familiar with the matter told CNA that the woman and her family were initially against the practice.</p>
<p>However, after talking with the family of the groom-to-be, the woman in the video who has been named as R by local media, is believed to have agreed to the union. </p>
<p>A cousin of R, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told CNA that she met R two days after the kidnapping. </p>
<p>“R said that initially, on the first day, she wanted to run away. But after two days, she decided to accept N (the groom-to-be) as her husband.</p>
<p>“At first I didn’t believe it, but after I asked her several times and her answer was still the same: ‘I accept N’, then I believed her,” the cousin said.</p>
<p>The cousin also pointed out that if R had wanted to escape, it would have been possible since her parents’ house was nearby.</p>
<p>Head of West Sumba police, who also is responsible for Central Sumba, Grand Commissioner Adjutant Khairul Saleh told CNA that they have investigated the viral video and questioned eight witnesses.</p>
<p>“Both parties have accepted that the woman would marry the man whom the perpetrators appointed.</p>
<p>“They claimed they love each other,” said Grand Commissioner Adjutant Saleh.</p>
<p>Since nobody filed an official police report, he said the authorities cannot pursue the case further legally but will continue to monitor it.</p>
<p>ACTIVISTS SAY BRIDE KIDNAPPING IS A VIOLATION OF WOMEN’S RIGHTS</p>
<p>Ms Aprissa Taranau, the chairwoman of the Sumba chapter of the Alliance of Women with Theological Education in Indonesia (Peruati) said she has looked into the ‘capture and wed’ practice and found seven cases in the last four years.</p>
<p>The cases involved women aged 16 to 30. Five ended with the women being freed, while two ended in marriages.</p>
<p>The 16-year-old was allegedly snatched when she was with her mother. </p>
<p>She was also allegedly raped multiple times, according to Ms Taranau’s research. She said that other cases may have gone unnoticed.</p>
<h3><a>READ: UN chief declares women's inequality 'stupid' and a global shame</a></h3>
<p>Ms Herlina Ratu Kenya, the secretary of the Sumba chapter of Peruati has condemned the practice.</p>
<p>“It is a crime which uses tradition as an excuse,” she told CNA.</p>
<p>Peruati has started an online petition urging the governor of East Nusa Tenggara to issue a regulation prohibiting marriages by abductions. More than 20,0000 people have signed the petition.</p>
<p>Ms Siti Aminah Tardi, commissioner of Indonesia’s National Commission of Violence Against Women (Komnas Perempuan), has also criticised the bride kidnapping practice.</p>
<p>She characterised the practice as an act of sexual violence, adding that female victims suffer from the deprivation of their rights.</p>
<p>“There must be a comprehensive step to eradicate practices of violence against women in the name of tradition or customs in society.</p>
<p>“Public education and law enforcement need to be done by the state and society in order to be able to provide essential security for women,” Ms Tardi added.</p>
<p>Is bride kidnapping part of the local culture? </p>
<p>Mdm Norlina Rambu Jola Kalunga, chancellor of Christian University Wira Wacana Sumba, said it is not so.</p>
<p>She said that in Sumba’s tradition, marriage is sacred because it unites two people and two families.</p>
<p>Over time, there have been different forms of marriages. Among them is a situation where cousins may marry each other, but it must be done properly, she said.</p>
<p>“The woman would wear a traditional sarong and those who would carry her would also wear traditional sarongs,” said Mdm Kalungan who studied sociology and anthropology.</p>
<p>“So in that practice, the woman is respected. But over time, there seems to be a shift where women are carried without their consent which in my opinion is a form of harassment,” Mdm Kalunga said.</p>
<p>To end the practice, she said it is important to educate people that men and women have the same rights. And this education has to start at home.</p>
<p>“Formal education and non-formal education also have a very crucial role. So everyone must work together to teach the value of human dignity, especially women’s and childrens’ rights which are often violated,” she stated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Minister of Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection I Gusti Ayu Bintang Darmawati visited Sumba on Jul 3 to better understand the issue.</p>
<blockquote><p>Menteri Bintang: Kasus Viral Penculikan Terhadap Perempuan dan Anak di Sumba Harus Dihentikan dan Tidak Boleh...</p>Posted by <a>Kementerian Pemberdayaan Perempuan dan Perlindungan Anak</a> on <a>Friday, July 3, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>During the visit, the minister signed a memorandum of understanding between the provincial East Nusa Tenggara government and the regional government of Sumba showing their commitment to end the practice.</p>
<p>Mr Nahar, a senior official with the ministry of women empowerment and child protection told CNA that the MOU is being drafted into a legal instrument.</p>
<p>“This document will be the basis for the four districts (West, Eastwest, Central and East Sumba) to draw up action plans to end violence against women and children,” said Mr Nahar, who like many Indonesians goes by one name.</p>
<p>Ms Tardi of Komnas Perempuan said what Indonesia needs is a sexual violence eradication Bill.</p>
<p>In early July, the Bill was dropped from this year’s priority list of Bills needed to be discussed by the House of Representatives Legislation Body.</p>
<p>While activists continue to monitor further developments, Ms Melati has slowly recovered from the incident.</p>
<p>After returning home, she did not dare to leave her house for a week out of fear that someone would kidnap her again.</p>
<p>After receiving psychological support and reassurance that the police are still monitoring her case, she resumed her daily routine.</p>
<p>She has forgiven the perpetrators as they are distant relatives and she wants the families to have a harmonious relationship.</p>
<p>Despite that, she wants the practice to be abolished in Sumba forever.</p>
<p>“It should be abolished because I fear for other women who may experience the same thing as I did. Please end it.”</p>

<li> <a> CNA Eyewitness</a> <ul> <li> Send us a news tip </li> </ul> </li>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Indonesian army ends 'virginity tests' on female cadets </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>JAKARTA: The Indonesian army has ended a controversial practice of virginity tests on women who apply to become cadets, according to its chief of staff, a move welcomed by activists who have long campaigned against it.</p>
<p>The military previously said the tests were important in determining recruits' morality. The World Health Organization has said they have "no scientific validity" and the appearance of a hymen was not a reliable indicator of intercourse.</p>
<p>Andika Perkasa, the Indonesian army chief of staff, told reporters on Tuesday (Aug 10) that such tests no longer took place in the army.</p>
<p>"Whether the hymen was ruptured or partially ruptured was part of the examination ... now there's no more of that," he said, in comments that were confirmed by a military spokesman.</p>
<p>Andika last month said that the army selection process for male and female recruits must be equal.</p>
<p>The navy conducted pregnancy tests on women applicants, but no specific virginity tests, its spokesperson Julius Widjojono said on Wednesday, adding "both men and women undergo the same examinations".</p>
<p>Indan Gilang, an air force spokesperson, said female reproduction tests were undertaken to check for cysts or other complications that could impair recruits' ability to serve, adding that "virginity tests" did not exist in the force's terminology.</p>
<p>Human rights groups welcomed the announcement that the army had ceased the practice.</p>
<p>"There was never any need for the tests," said Andy Yentriyani, head of the National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas Perempuan).</p>
<p>Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher at HRW, said it was "the right thing to do", adding the practice was "degrading, discriminatory and traumatic".</p>
<p>He said HRW had spoken to more than 100 female military recruits who underwent the tests, one of whom said she was subjected to it in 1965.</p>

<p>BANGKOK: With coronavirus deaths rising in Myanmar, allegations are growing from residents and human rights activists that the military government, which seized control in February, is using the pandemic to consolidate power and crush opposition.</p>
<p>In the last week, the per capita death rate in Myanmar surpassed those of Indonesia and Malaysia to become the worst in Southeast Asia. </p>
<p>The country’s crippled health care system has rapidly become overwhelmed with new patients sick with COVID-19.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Singapore will send 200 oxygen concentrators to Myanmar to help fight COVID-19</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, medical workers have been targeted after spearheading a civil disobedience movement that urged professionals and civil servants not to cooperate with the government, known as the State Administrative Council.</p>
<p>“With the oxygen, they have banned sales to civilians or people who are not supported by the SAC, so they’re using something that can save the people against the people," she said. "The military is weaponising COVID.”</p>
<h3><a>READ: Myanmar floods, coup complicate growing COVID-19 outbreak</a></h3>
<p>Myanmar’s Deputy Information Minister Zaw Min Tun did not respond to questions about the allegations, but with growing internal and external pressure to get the pandemic under control, the leadership has been on a public relations offensive.</p>
<p>In the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper this week, several articles highlighted the government’s efforts, including what it called a push to resume vaccinations and increase oxygen supplies.</p>
<p>Senior Gen Min Aung Hlaing, the head of the government, was cited as saying that efforts were also being made to seek support from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and unspecified “friendly countries". </p>
<p>“Efforts must be made for ensuring better health of the State and the people,” he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of people in the community who have died of the disease and cannot be counted.”</p>
<h3><a>READ: UN warned of 'dire' COVID-19 situation in Myanmar</a></h3>
<p>“The problem is the junta cares more about holding on to power than stopping the pandemic.”</p>
<p>Myanmar is one of the region’s poorest countries and already was in a vulnerable position when the military seized power, triggering a violent political struggle.</p>
<p>As civil disobedience grew after Suu Kyi’s removal, public hospitals were basically closed as doctors and other staff refused to work under the new administration, instead running makeshift clinics for which they faced arrest, if caught.</p>
<p>Some have returned to public hospitals, but the Mawlamyine doctor interviewed by AP said it was too dangerous.</p>
<p>“I could be arrested by the junta anytime if I returned to the hospital,” added the doctor, who was part of the disobedience movement and has been treating patients with supplies he has scrounged.</p>
<p>According to Tom Andrews, the UN Human Rights Council’s independent expert on human rights in Myanmar, government forces have engaged in at least 260 attacks on medical personnel and facilities, killing 18. </p>
<p>At least 67 health care professionals had been detained and another 600 are being sought.</p>
<p>The rapid rise in COVID -19 illnesses is “extremely concerning, particularly with limited availability of health services and oxygen supplies,” said Joy Singhal, head of the Red Cross’ Myanmar delegation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Andrews urged the UN Security Council and member states to push for a “COVID cease-fire". </p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian declined to comment directly earlier this week on the report of the delivery to the KIA, noting instead “the epidemic is a common enemy to all mankind.”</p>
<p>The Global New Light reported Myanmar received another 1 million doses purchased from China.</p>
<p>Lee said if the government is trying to use vaccines and other aid to its advantage by positioning itself as the solution to the pandemic, it's too late.</p>
<p>“The people know now and it’s been too long,” she said. “COVID was not manmade but it got out of proportion because of complicity and deliberate blockage of services — there’s no going back.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Myanmar troops arrest 18 medics for treating 'terrorists' in church </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Myanmar's military has arrested 18 medics for providing treatment to patients who were members of "terrorist organisations", a state-run newspaper said Wednesday (Nov 24), referring to outlawed anti-junta groups.</p>
<p>Troops made the arrests during a raid on Monday on a church in Loikaw in eastern Kayah state, where they discovered 48 patients who were receiving treatment, seven suffering from COVID-19.</p>
<p>"It was learned that unofficial medical treatment was being provided to the injured persons and patients from the terrorist organisations," said the Global New Light of Myanmar, the junta's mouthpiece.</p>
<p>The report did not name the organisations. It said the 18 medics arrested would be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<p>Myanmar's healthcare system has been close to collapse since the army overthrew an elected government in a Feb 1 coup.</p>
<p>Many medical workers joined a civil disobedience movement and have refused to work in military-run hospitals in protest at the junta's rule.</p>
<p>Many healthcare facilities and workers have been targeted by security forces, according to human rights groups.</p>
<p>The military has appealed to doctors to return to work.</p>
<p>Some of the four doctors, four nurses and 10 nursing aides arrested at the church had previously been charged with incitement over their refusal to work, the report said.</p>
<p>Close to 1,300 civilians have been killed and more than 10,000 arrested since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), which has been tracking post-coup events in Myanmar.</p>
<p>The military has dismissed the AAPP's data, which has been cited by the United Nations, and accuses it of bias. A junta spokesman last week said 200 soldiers have been killed during the conflict.</p>

<p>Breathless, fevered and without the extra oxygen that could help keep them alive, the new COVID-19 patients at a hospital near Myanmar's border with India highlight the threat to a health system near collapse since February's coup.</p>
<p>To help her tend the seven COVID-19 patients at Cikha hospital, day and night, chief nurse Lun Za En has a lab technician and a pharmacist's assistant.</p>
<p>Mostly, they offer kind words and paracetamol.</p>
<p>"We don't have enough oxygen, enough medical equipment, enough electricity, enough doctors or enough ambulances," Lun Za En, 45, told Reuters from the town of just more than 10,000. "We are operating with three staff instead of 11."</p>
<p>Myanmar's anti-COVID-19 campaign foundered along with the rest of the health system after the military seized power on Feb 1 and overthrew elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose government had stepped up testing, quarantine and treatment.</p>

<p>Services at public hospitals collapsed after many doctors and nurses joined strikes in a Civil Disobedience Movement in the forefront of opposition to military rule - and sometimes on the frontline of protests that have been bloodily suppressed.</p>
<p>Around 150 health workers have been arrested. Hundreds more doctors and nurses are wanted on incitement charges.</p>
<p>Neither a junta spokesman nor the health ministry responded to requests for comment. The junta, which initially set fighting the pandemic as one of its priorities, has repeatedly urged medics to return to work. Few have responded.</p>
<p>A worker at one COVID-19 quarantine centre in Myanmar's commercial capital, Yangon, said all the specialist health workers there had joined the Civil Disobedience Movement.</p>
<p>"Then again, we don't receive new patients any more as COVID test centres don't have staff to test," said the worker, who declined to give his name for fear of retribution.</p>
<p>In the week before the coup, COVID-19 tests nationally averaged more than 17,000 a day. That had fallen below 1,200 a day in the seven days up to Wednesday.</p>
<p>Myanmar has reported more than 3,200 COVID-19 deaths from over 140,000 cases, although the slump in testing has raised doubts over data that shows new cases and deaths have largely plateaued since the coup.</p>
<p>Now, a health system in crisis is raising concerns about the likely impact on the country from the wave of infections with variants that is sweeping through India, Thailand and other neighbours.</p>
<p>Patients with COVID-19 symptoms started showing up at Cikha hospital in mid-May. It is only 6km from India, and health workers fear the illness could be the highly infectious B16172 strain - though they lack the means to test for it.</p>
<p>Twenty-four cases have been identified in Cikha, said Lun Za En. Seven were so serious they needed hospitalisation - a sign of how few cases had likely been detected.</p>
<p>Stay-at-home orders have now been declared in parts of Chin state, where Cikha is located, and neighbouring Sagaing region.</p>
<p>The WHO said it was trying to reach authorities and other groups in the area who could provide help, while recognising the difficulties in a health system that was precipitously reversing years of impressive gains.</p>
<p>"It is not clear how this will be resolved, unless there is a resolution at the political level addressing the political conflict," said Jost.</p>
<p>Refusing to abandon the sick, Lun Za En said she decided not to join the strikes.</p>
<p>"The junta will not take care of our patients," she said.</p>
<p>Across Myanmar, some striking doctors have set up underground clinics to help patients. When Myanmar Red Cross volunteers established three clinics in Yangon neighbourhoods, they quickly had dozens of patients.</p>
<p>At best, such options can provide basic care.</p>
<p>"Eighty percent of the hospitals are public health hospitals," said Marjan Besuijen, head of mission for the Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid group. "As MSF or others we can't step in, it's too big."</p>
<p>Although military hospitals have been opened to the public, many people fear them or refuse to go on principle - including for coronavirus vaccinations in a campaign the ousted government had launched days before the coup.</p>
<p>"I am very worried that these new infections will spread all over the country," said Lun Za En. "If the infection spreads to the crowded cities, it could be uncontrollable."</p>

<p>WASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden has yet to agree to a time and place of fresh talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Psaki also refuted criticism leveled by Putin on Thursday that the US and its allies have been the aggressor in the Russia-Ukraine border escalation.</p>
<p>“Well facts are a funny thing and facts make clear that the only aggression we’re seeing at the border of Russia and Ukraine is the military buildup by the Russians and the bellicose rhetoric by the leader of Russia," Psaki said.</p>

<h1> Commentary: As US withdraws, Russia confronts an awkward dilemma in Afghanistan </h1>
<div> <p>For Russia, Afghanistan has posed a conundrum, requiring it to work with many regional players to keep the Taliban in check, says NTU’s Christopher Cheang.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Christopher Cheang </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The US’ impending withdrawal from Afghanistan and rapid territorial gains by the Taliban leave Russia in a dilemma.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the power vacuum might threaten the security of Central Asian allies and by extension, Russia’s, in the near future.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: The US’ hasty exit from Afghanistan is a gift to the Taliban</a></h3>
<p>RUSSIA’S ATTITUDES TOWARDS AFGHANISTAN</p>
<p>Secretary of the powerful Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev’s recent speech at a security conference in Moscow in June best reflects Russia’s perception of the situation there.</p>
<p>Patrushev claimed that the production of drugs, “a powerful resource base for terrorists” had increased more than 40 times during the Western military presence there.</p>

<p>LIMITATIONS OF RUSSIA’S INFLUENCE ON AFGHANISTAN’S FUTURE</p>
<p>While it has serious differences with the NATO military power there, Russia grudgingly recognises that the Western military presence had somewhat stabilised Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Yet Russia remains more concerned about terrorist groups gaining a foothold in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>"Moreover, ISIS is deliberately and purposefully establishing itself in the northern provinces of Afghanistan on the border with our allies,” he said.</p>

<p>WORKING THROUGH MULTILATERAL CHANNELS</p>
<p>Since Russia cannot master the situation in Afghanistan on its own, it has been working with China, India, Pakistan and Iran. They too have security and other interests, in seeing a stable Afghanistan.</p>
<p>This approach can be gleaned from the July meeting of the SCO Foreign Ministers in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. (Russia and China are the leading members of the SCO. The others are Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, India and Pakistan.)</p>
<p>They also called for “political dialogue and an inclusive peace process conducted and led by the Afghans themselves,” welcoming the inter-Afghan peace talks in Doha and other platforms.</p>
<p>China is a key player in the stabilisation of Afghanistan. It sees Afghanistan as a part of its Belt and Road Initiative and already has some projects there.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Taliban too has expressed China’s important role there; its spokesman Suhail Shaheen was quoted as saying on Jul 7 that “China is a friendly country that we welcome for reconstruction and developing Afghanistan".</p>
<p>He also added that the Taliban would no longer allow Uighur separatist fighters or Al-Qaeda or any other terrorist group to operate from Afghanistan.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: India cosying up to Pakistan is latest move in a regional chess game with China</a></h3>
<p>Judging by Afghanistan’s long history of conflict, the influential roles played by its neighbours and in the last 20 years, by the US and NATO, in its political destiny, Afghanistan has become a real challenge for Russia.</p>
<p>Unlike the US, geographical proximity, longstanding historical, political, economic and security ties with Central Asia will not allow Russia to simply ignore the realities an unstable Afghanistan poses to their common security.</p>
<p>Finally, as a great power, Russia would not let its image and prestige suffer by allowing Afghanistan to fester into a security threat.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Russia won't be deterred in Ukraine by sanctions </h1>
<div> <p>"Unprecedented sanctions" will not be nearly enough to deter Russian aggression in Ukraine, according to this US foreign policy expert.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> David Cortright </a> </div> </div>
<p>SOUTH BEND, Indiana: The Biden administration is threatening harsh, “high impact” sanctions against Russia if it invades Ukraine.</p>
<p>US intelligence officials say Russia has been preparing for a potential invasion by amassing tens of thousands of troops along the border and engaging in other aggressive tactics.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held a virtual summit on Monday(Dec 7) to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>Policymakers claim that sanctions are an effective means of achieving policy goals. But is that true? Are new measures against Moscow likely to be successful?</p>
<p>Research on sanctions that I and others have conducted has shown that yes, they can sometimes be effective.</p>
<p>But there are serious problems with additional US sanctions on Russia.</p>
<h2>UNILATERAL SANCTIONS RARELY WORK</h2>
<p>While it’s unclear what new sanctions the US might unleash, early reports suggest they may target Russia’s financial system, including its biggest banks and ability to convert rubles into dollars.</p>
<p>Such sanctions would be meant to punish Russia’s economy, Putin allies and the country’s wealthier residents.</p>
<p>For these or similar sanctions to be effective the United States would need allies. Past US measures against Russia have often been unilateral and without the support or participation of other major states or the United Nations.</p>
<p>Such unilateral sanctions are seldom successful. In an increasingly globalised world economy, unilateral sanctions face huge obstacles – even when imposed by the world’s largest economy.</p>
<p>The rare instances when unilateral American sanctions worked involved countries that have extensive trade relations with the US, clearly not the case with Russia.</p>
<p>Russia is low on the list of US trading partners, and previous sanctions on Moscow have further reduced commercial relations with the US. Russia is not dependent on US trade and thus is unlikely to submit to American economic pressure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when a targeted country faces sanctions, it can seek commercial ties elsewhere.</p>
<p>This was the case with Cuba. When the US imposed an embargo on its former trading partner after the revolution in 1959, Havana turned to Moscow for help and became a part of the communist bloc. Sanctions had no impact in changing Cuban policy.</p>
<p>In recent years, Russia has been increasing its commercial relations and energy cooperation with China, which will make it less susceptible to US economic pressure.</p>
<p>There are reports that European allies have been convinced by US intelligence assessments that the threat of more sanctions is warranted – but whether all EU members will agree to go along with them is another matter.</p>
<p>Russia supplies Europe with much of its natural gas, assuring access to trade and revenues regardless of US measures.</p>
<p>Germany and other European countries have expressed concern about Russian activity against Ukraine. And the EU has imposed some sanctions against Russia after the takeover of Crimea.</p>
<p>But in recent years, the European Union has favoured diplomatic strategies rather than economic sanctions to decide the future of Ukraine.</p>
<h2>IT CAN’T BE ALL STICK AND NO CARROT</h2>
<p>This raises a second factor influencing the effectiveness of sanctions: The importance of combining penalties with diplomatic bargaining.</p>
<p>My research with economic sanctions expert George Lopez shows that sanctions work best when more coercive measures are coupled with some kind of a carrot to incentivise compliance.</p>
<p>The offer to lift sanctions can be an effective bargaining chip for persuading the targeted regime to alter its policies.</p>
<p>This was the case in the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, when the offer to lift sanctions served as an inducement for Serbia to end its aggressive policies against Bosnia and accept a political settlement in their long-running conflict.</p>
<p>The use of sanctions and incentives was also successful in achieving the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.</p>
<p>Rigorous US, United Nations and EU sanctions were combined with an offer to lift sanctions if Iran complied with demands to restrict its nuclear program and accept intrusive inspections.</p>
<p>The International Atomic Energy Commission verified that Iran kept its side of the bargain and significantly curtailed its nuclear program, and UN sanctions were removed in 2016.</p>
<p>The Trump administration unilaterally abandoned the agreement in 2018, however, and imposed new “maximum pressure” sanctions on Iran. The deal collapsed, and Iran resumed its prohibited enrichment activities.</p>
<p>Negotiations are underway now to restore the agreement. The US has offered to ease sanctions if Iran accepts renewed restrictions on its nuclear program, but the two sides have not been able to reach agreement.</p>
<p>The US policy of withdrawing from the Iran deal and reimposing unilateral sanctions abandoned a multilateral diplomatic approach that was working.</p>
<p>Biden’s threat of new sanctions on Russia is unlikely to have much of an impact on Putin’s behaviour unless European states support and participate in the decision.</p>
<p>An alternative approach might be to support European attempts to negotiate a solution to the Ukraine crisis, using the offer to ease current sanctions as an incentive for reducing the pressure on Kiev.</p>

<h1> Commentary: China’s divide-and-conquer strategy isn’t fooling anyone anymore </h1>
<div> <p>Recent actions involving Australia and New Zealand reveal the country’s modus operandi can be effective but will have broader, corrosive implications for China, says Christian Le Miere.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Christian Le Miere </a> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: Exactly 500 years ago, the Italian Renaissance philosopher, Niccolo Machiavelli, published his treatise, The Art of War. </p>
<p>In it, the chief protagonist, Lord Fabrizio Colonna, declared: “A Captain ought, among all the other actions of his, endeavour with every art to divide the forces of the enemy.”</p>
<p>Half a millennium later, this principle seems to describe one of China’s foreign policy dictums.</p>
<p>Case in point? Australia. The country has come under the Chinese radar in recent months.</p>
<p>A second round of curbs were rolled out in early November, with live lobster, timber and more delayed at the borders, though formal notices on bans were not issued.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Can China produce grape wine as fine as the French?</a></h3>
<p>A SPAT BETWEEN NEW ZEALAND AND AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>But punitive sanctions on Australia are only part of the divide-and-conquer story.</p>
<p>Here’s exhibit B: China signed a trade deal with New Zealand in January to upgrade an existing free trade agreement, removing or cutting tariffs on many of the very same goods Beijing just sanctioned from Australia.</p>
<p>The overall messaging is clear: Anger Beijing and we will punish you. But stay on Beijing’s good side and we will reward you.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Taiwan is becoming the biggest test in US-China relations</a></h3>
<p>And the strategy is effective. It’s challenging for countries benefiting from greater access to the world’s second-largest economy to give up that reward.</p>
<p>That same month, Australia and New Zealand had an extremely rare diplomatic spat recently.</p>
<p>It was a remarkable statement that underlined the growing tensions in the usually rock solid trans-Tasman relationship.</p>
<p>A PATTERN OF COERCIVE DIPLOMACY</p>
<p>But Beijing is relatively unusual in the manner in which it undertakes this coercion, using disproportionality, extra-legal processes, and deniability.</p>
<p>Through obfuscation and manipulation, it wants to condition countries to consider China’s interests.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Trump’s playbook on China in the South China Sea has some lessons for the Biden administration</a></h3>
<p>In the Australia case, for example, technocratic reasons for the sanctions rather than government policy were given by China, from alleged mislabelling of wine to delayed quarantine inspections and claims of beetle infestations in timber.</p>
<p>China’s track record on this has been consistent. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to a Chinese dissident led to an unofficial ban on Norwegian salmon exports in 2013.</p>
<p>The arrest of a Chinese fishing trawler captain by Japan saw an unofficial export quota on rare earth metals in 2010.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: After a stormy few years, verdict on Trump’s trade war with China is clear</a></h3>
<p>Mongolia too saw an increased in import taxes followed a 2016 visit by the Dalai Lama. The Chinese Foreign Ministry even went as far to say: “We hope Mongolia has taken this lesson to heart.”</p>
<p>In all these infractions, China punishes each nation disproportionately in a bid to deter similar actions, while simultaneously using unofficial avenues to avoid being labelled as a bully.</p>
<p>Worryingly, the use of such coercive diplomacy has been expanding rapidly in recent years: A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in September 2020 tabulated more than 150 instances of Chinese economic coercion between 2010 and 2020.</p>
<p>From 2010 to 2017, the number of cases of such coercion never rose above 20 each year; by 2019, it was nearly 60.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Major countries are concerned about implications of China's rise. So is China</a></h3>
<p>This growing use of coercion is a key part of China’s divide-and-conquer strategy, alongside incentives and diplomatic attempts to drive wedges in multilateral grouping.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: They already have jet bombers and super missiles. Will Chinese fighter jets be more powerful than America’s soon?</a></h3>
<p>These activities are encouraging a more united stance among regional states, with a broad pushback against China now being facilitated by a more engaged US. </p>
<p>With a strong bipartisan consensus in the US for a more hawkish policy towards China and a new administration, the US is adopting a traditional leadership role in this key strategic area.</p>
<p>In doing so, the US is bringing together allies that might otherwise be looking to compete with each other for China’s favour.</p>
<p>China’s divide-and-conquer strategy could be counterproductive, as states grow conscious of such tactics and cooperate with each other to hedge against China across various fields of engagement – trade, regulation, defence and security.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: To its own detriment, the US still doesn’t understand China</a></h3>
<p>The consequences for Beijing are serious.</p>
<p>A more hostile international environment, with rival states coalescing into alliances and groupings designed to thwart China’s ambitions of becoming a global superpower and achieve sustainable growth could arise.</p>
<p>That would be unfortunate indeed not just for the world but for China, if such a divide-and-conquer strategy creates a more bifurcated and antagonistic international order inimical to China’s rise.</p>

<p>BALTIMORE: US President Joe Biden said on Thursday (Oct 21) the United States would come to Taiwan's defence and had a commitment to defend the island, though the White House said later there was no change in policy towards the island.</p>
<p>China expressed its displeasure anyway, with a foreign ministry spokesman saying the country has no room for concessions on its core interests.</p>
<p>China urges the United States "not to send the wrong signals to the forces of Taiwan independence, to avoid seriously harming Sino-US ties and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait," spokesman Wang Wenbin said in Beijing.</p>
<p>Taiwan's presidential office, responding to Biden's remarks, said their position remains the same, which is it will neither give in to pressure nor "rashly advance" when it gets support.</p>
<p>Taiwan will show a firm determination to defend itself, presidential office spokesperson Xavier Chang said in a statement, noting also the Biden administration's continued concrete actions to show its "rock-solid" support for Taiwan.</p>
<h2>"MOST POWERFUL MILITARY"</h2>
<p>Biden said people should not worry about Washington's military strength because "China, Russia and the rest of the world knows we're the most powerful military in the history of the world".</p>
<p>Military tensions between Taiwan and China are at their worst in more than 40 years, Taiwan's Defense Minister Chiu Kuo-cheng said this month, adding that China will be capable of mounting a "full-scale" invasion by 2025.</p>
<p>Taiwan says it is an independent country and will defend its freedoms and democracy.</p>
<p>China says Taiwan is the most sensitive and important issue in its ties with the United States and has denounced what it calls "collusion" between Washington and Taipei.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters earlier on Thursday, China's United Nations Ambassador Zhang Jun said they are pursuing "peaceful reunification" with Taiwan and responding to "separatist attempts" by its ruling Democratic Progressive Party.</p>
<p>"We are not the troublemaker. On the contrary, some countries - the US in particular - is taking dangerous actions, leading the situation in Taiwan Strait into a dangerous direction," he said.</p>
<p>"I think at this moment what we should call is that the United States to stop such practice. Dragging Taiwan into a war definitely is in nobody's interest. I don't see that the United States will gain anything from that."</p>

<p>NEW DEHLI: It was war — a war of words in Alaska, as United States and China sat down to talk for the <a>first time in March</a> under the Joe Biden administration.</p>
<p>For those tracking US-China relations outside the states, any expectations of a reset in ties <a>have been buried</a>, while the shock is yet to wear off.</p>
<p>It was quite the show—negotiations cheekily dubbed “Anchor-rage” by media and twitter commentators alike.</p>
<p>The plummeting Sino-US ties impact all geographies and for those watching closely this did not come as a surprise though it may have made strategic options clearer.</p>

<p>THE QUAD IS MOVING FORWARD</p>
<p>Juxtapose this with the contrasting images that came out from the much talked about Quad Summit held virtually just before the Alaska meeting. Indian Prime Minister Modi, called the summit “a coming of age of the Quad".</p>
<p>This could only happen if all sides built on each other’s strengths. Capacity-building would be the thrust of the agenda. The mandate would be to sharpen collective aims, set timeframes and avoid duplication of effort.</p>
<p>Practically, these efforts would identify collective challenges and tackle them through concrete workplans and activities via multilateral channels under the ambit of the Quad.</p>

<p>REAL BENEFITS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES</p>
<p>It’s reflective that Quad countries have internalised the understanding that while divergences can be managed, synergising individual approaches for delivering solutions to global challenges is the need of the hour.</p>
<p>This isn’t a sudden development, but a work in progress. </p>

<p>PUTTING THE BLUEPRINT INTO ACTION</p>
<p>These are just a few examples, but it's clear the blueprint for delivering results in the Indo-Pacific is certainly being put into action.</p>
<p>This week, India has joined its Quad partners - Australia, Japan and the US - in a French-led naval drill in the Bay of Bengal for the first time to improve Indo-Pacific maritime security. </p>
<p>While the security logic to the Indo-Pacific was always clear, the Quad’s multi-arena capacity building attempts are a sign that the socio-economic logic to the Indo-Pacific is also being ironed out now.</p>
<p>The Quad showed up, now it will have to deliver on its chosen mandate.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why AUKUS is gaining acceptance in the Indo Pacific </h1>
<div> <p>The Australia-US-UK pact facilitates Asian countries' pursuit of cooperation in other areas without worrying about the larger looming regional security challenge, says New Delhi-based expert Shruti Pandalai.</p> </div>
<p>NEW DELHI: It has been a fortnight of high-powered diplomacy for the Indo Pacific and its leading players. </p>
<p>He said: “The Quad is an effort of cooperation, between four countries … all impelled by a sense of responsibility towards the global commons … mind you each one has made an extra effort ... It wasn’t something pre-destined.” </p>
<p>He added that there were many “trilaterals out there” with the Indo Pacific being a “big and complicated region” and the right thing to do is for countries to be “open to all of them” instead of seeing shadows. </p>
<h2>DAMAGE CONTROL OVER AUKUS </h2>
<p>These words seem prophetic coming at a time when the debate around the newly announced Anglo-Saxon AUKUS security pact and its impact on transatlantic alliances has reached fever pitch. </p>
<p>As news broke, the coalition of the willing had to work hard to iron out some discordant notes with the French openly calling the pact a “betrayal”.</p>
<p>After all, France is among the leading partners of the Quad grouping working together on multiple fronts to check Chinese expansion in the region and shore up capacity-building.</p>
<p>Some tensions have eased, with French president Emmanuel Macron mending the rift with UK prime minister Boris Johnson through a phonecall over the weekend.</p>
<h2>OPPORTUNITES AND MANY BUILDING BLOCKS</h2>
<p>From New Delhi’s perspective, the long view on these tectonic shifts in the Indo Pacific is sobering. </p>
<p>After a bloody Himalayan confrontation last year, China looms large on India’s land and maritime borders not to mention its West Asian neighbourhood with the Taliban’s return to Afghanistan. </p>
<p>Amid concerns among Asian friends that AUKUS could set off a new arms race in the region while allowing China to gain from geopolitical dissonance, India has been working with its partners to set the record straight on multiple fronts.</p>
<h2>SHORING UP INDO-PACIFIC SECURITY</h2>
<p>Foreign policy observers have highlighted how this the new arrangement pushes the region towards becoming more open, inclusive and engaged, such that no one country dominates. </p>
<p>For one, any doubts over Australian commitment to assessing China through a strategic lens and overcoming its tendency to bow to economic pressures in its China policy now stand redressed.</p>
<p>This push for security cooperation in the region could also have positive knock-on effects if it encourages major Asian powers to step up regional security engagements. </p>
<p>Prime minister Modi was notably among the first leaders to speak with French president Macron after the transatlantic feud last week. </p>
<p>Short of naming China, efforts at UNGA, the AUKUS arrangement and Quad Leadership Summit are all aimed at augmenting collective strengths to push back against unilateralism and expansionism in the Indo Pacific. </p>
<p>India has often argued that limiting the Quad mandate to just hard security limits buy-in, where broadening the scope of cooperation could dampen sharp competition. </p>
<p>S Jaishankar, speaking at the Carnegie event, made the case that the “more platforms you have, the more people work with each other, the larger the consensus and that’s good”. </p>
<p>In this context, AUKUS is a win for Asian countries worried about having to choose sides and ASEAN concerned about big power geopolitics scuttling the regional grouping’s ability to press on with functional and economic cooperation. </p>
<p>But navigating these alliances and geopolitical sensitivities will be key as balance is restored in the Indo Pacific.</p>

<div> <p>The US has lost moral authority with latest U-turn on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, says Tunc Kaplan.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tunc Kaplan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Monday (Nov 18) that the United States no longer considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank a violation of international law.</p>
<p>This unilateral decision reversed four decades of American policy and removed what has otherwise been an important barrier to Israeli designs of annexing occupied territory.</p>
<h3><a>READ: In new pro-Israel shift, US no longer calls settlements illegal</a></h3>
<p>These countries — all American allies — went on to say: “All settlement activity is illegal under international law, and erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace.”</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has also said it completely rejects Washington’s statement, and the Arab League held an emergency meeting of foreign ministers earlier in the week over the issue.</p>
<p>Palestinian chief negotiator, Saeb Erekat, said the Palestinians would take a series of measures to oppose the US decision, including calling for a UN Security Council debate.</p>
<p>"We are going to the [UN] General Assembly and we will ask ... the International Criminal Court to open an official judicial investigation", he added.</p>
<p>In doing so, the United States is abdicating its so-called moral leadership, rendering toothless its proclamations should another country choose to disregard international law.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: The US that no longer bothers about diplomacy</a></h3>
<p>Since then, Washington has continued to denounce Russia’s actions, while maintaining sanctions against it. US denunciation of the Russian move continues, with the latest coming as recently as February this year.</p>
<p>Many international law experts and scholars have scrutinised the legal arguments against the latest US move and have picked it apart.</p>
<p>In a commentary for The Washington Post, Fareed Zakaria opined that: “The Trump administration has also given up on support for broad-based norms and values”.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Small state doesn’t mean a weak state</a></h3>
<p>This move is worrisome for small states like Singapore, where the rule of law has been a cornerstone of not only domestic and economic policies, but also foreign policy.</p>
<p>It is internationally recognised norms of good state behaviour that have helped to create a conducive, peaceful environment for Singapore.</p>
<p>It was barely in October this year when Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon spoke at length in a lecture about why the rule of law is an “existential necessity” for the Republic.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Sundraresh Menon's commentary, Rule of law is an 'existential necessity' for Singapore</a></h3>
<p>Even larger states in Asia, such as Malaysia, have found the latest US pronouncement problematic.</p>
<a>blatant disregard</a> of international laws and multiple United Nations’ resolutions.
<p>“We are no longer safe. If a country wants to enter our country and build their settlements, that is legal. We cannot do anything”, he added.</p>
<p>The latest US position thus has the effect of re-igniting the debate on Thucydides’ oft-(mis)quoted axiom: “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must”.</p>

<h1> Commentary: How China will try to subdue Taiwan – without firing a bullet </h1>
<div> <p>The US is once again warning that China might invade Taiwan, but a more gradualist approach by Beijing seems more likely, says Christian Le Miere.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Christian Le Miere </a> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: Twenty-five years ago, war over Taiwan seemed imminent.</p>
<p>Chinese missiles flew in the direction of Taiwan and a US aircraft carrier sailed through the Taiwan Strait in a defiant signal of resolve.</p>
<p>Rather, China is more likely to pursue a gradualist approach, slowly eroding Taiwanese sovereignty. Rather than a bloody war, China will most probably look to “salami slice” its way to reunification. </p>

<p>For Beijing, focused on defence of its own borders and often consumed by internal instability, from the Great Leap Forward to the Cultural Revolution, an invasion of Taiwan seemed like an unwise task.</p>
