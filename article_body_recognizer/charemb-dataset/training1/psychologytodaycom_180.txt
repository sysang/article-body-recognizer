<p>To be diagnosed with Tobacco Use Disorder, two of the following symptoms must be identified: </p>
<li>Tobacco is taken in larger dosages and or for a longer period of time than intended</li>
<li>There is a persistent desire and or failed attempts to reduce tobacco use</li>
<li>A large amount of time goes into procuring or using tobacco</li>
<li>An overwhelming desire or urge to use tobacco</li>
<li>The inability, due to tobacco use, to maintain obligations for one's job, school, or home life</li>
<li>Continued tobacco use in the face of social-interpersonal problems that result from, or are made worse by, the use of the <a>stimulant</a></li>
<li>Tobacco use becomes prioritized to such an extent that social, occupational, and recreational activities are either given up on completely or are reduced drastically</li>
<li>Tobacco use occurs even in situations where it becomes physically hazardous</li>
<li>The use of tobacco continues even though one knows the physical and psychological risks and problems associated with it</li>
<li>A considerable increase in the amount of tobacco is needed to achieve the desired effect, or the same amount of tobacco no longer produces the desired effect</li>
<li>Withdrawal symptoms characteristic of tobacco use are present, or tobacco is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms</li>
<div> <h3> What are the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal </h3> </div>
<p>Cessation of nicotine use is followed by a withdrawal period that may last a month or more and includes symptoms that can quickly drive people back to using it. Nicotine withdrawal symptoms may begin within a few hours after use, and include:</p>
<p>• Irritability </p>
<p>• Sleep disturbances </p>
<p>• Cognitive and attentional deficits </p>
<p>• Increased <a>appetite</a> </p>
<p>Symptoms generally peak within the first few days and may subside within a few weeks, though for some people, they may persist for months or longer.</p>

<a>stress</a>. If someone is to overcome the
<a>addiction</a> to nicotine, they will likely have to change the behaviors they associate with smoking.
<p>Research suggests that a person should quit smoking gradually to lessen the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Rates of <a>relapse</a> are highest in the first few weeks and months and diminish considerably after three months.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that pharmacological treatment combined with psychological treatment, such as psychological support and skills training to get through high-risk situations, results in some of the highest long-term abstinence rates.</p>
<p>Smoking cessation can have a major positive impact on a person's health; for example, a 35-year-old man who quits smoking will, on average, increase his life expectancy by about five years.</p>

<div> <h3> Can the lungs heal after quitting smoking? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The lungs can heal and repair themselves to a degree, though they will not return to normal fully. There will likely be continued discoloration of the lungs. However, it is still better to quit.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Why does the chest hurt after quitting? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Nicotine withdrawal can result in some tightness of the chest. The muscles may also become sore from coughing. This tightness will likely pass after a few days.</p> </div> </div>

<p>Using pharmacological treatments can increase the odds of success. However, a combination of pharmacological and behavioral treatments—for example, combining the nicotine patch with group therapy—further improves chances.</p>

<p>According to the DSM-5, inhalant-use disorder is diagnosed when repeated use of inhalants leads to clinically significant impairment or distress, or when a problematic pattern of intoxication develops.</p>
<p>The disorder may be diagnosed when at least two of the following symptoms are present over a 12-month period:</p>
<li>a strong craving or urge to use inhalants</li>
<li>a strong desire to cut down on inhalant use, or unsuccessful efforts to do so</li>
<li>spending a lot of time obtaining, using, or recovering from the effects of an inhalant</li>
<li>continuing to use inhalants despite problems they cause in major areas of life, such as work, school, family life, or personal relationships</li>
<li>giving up important social, career, or recreational activities because of inhalant use</li>
<li>using inhalants repeatedly despite awareness of the physical hazards</li>

<p>Immediate Treatment During a Crisis</p>
<p>If someone is experiencing an adverse reaction while under the influence of hallucinogens, it is important that they receive help as soon as possible. Quick responses can save lives. In the meantime, those around them can:</p>
<li>Focus on preventing the user from harm and on keeping them safe</li>
<li>Decrease external stimulation and agitation</li>
<li>Calm the user; move and speak in a reassuring manner</li>
<li>If possible, remain with them; this may mean staying with them for several hours</li>
<li>Call an ambulance and stay with the person until the ambulance arrives</li>
<li>Ensure adequate air by keeping crowds back and opening windows</li>
<li>If the person is <a>unconscious</a>, turn them on their side and gently tilt their head back so their tongue does not block the airway</li>
<li>If breathing has stopped, give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation; if there is no pulse, apply CPR</li>

<div> <div> <h1>Gambling Disorder (Compulsive Gambling, Pathological Gambling)</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Betting the farm can actually be a serious problem for some people. Compulsive and habitual gambling can destroy a person's life. He likely suffers personal problems and financial ruin, with problem gambling sometimes leading to a life of crime. </p>
<p>A compulsive, or pathological, gambler is someone who is unable to resist his or her impulses. This can lead to severe consequences. The urge to gamble becomes so great that tension can only be relieved by gambling more and more.</p>
<p>Sufferers are often unaware, or in <a>denial</a>, of having a problem. The step toward addressing the gambling is admitting there is a problem. For some people, this awareness comes only when they reach rock bottom.</p>
<p>This was formerly a compulsive disorder, and now considered an <a>addiction</a> disorder in the <a>DSM-5</a>.</p>
<p>How do you know if you are a compulsive, or pathological, gambler?</p>
<p>Signs and symptoms as cataloged by the <a>DSM-5</a>:</p>
<li> <p>Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the fol­lowing in a 12-month period:</p> </li>
<li> <p>Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money to achieve the desired excitement.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble).</p> </li>
<li> <p>Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, <a>anxious</a>, depressed).</p> </li>
<li> <p>After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (“chasing”one’s losses).</p> </li>
<li> <p>Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or <a>career</a> op­portunity because of gambling.</p> </li>
<li> <p>Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling.</p> </li>
<li> <p>The gambling behavior is not better explained by a <a>manic episode</a>.</p> </li>
<a>divorce</a>, job loss, and prison time. The
<a>stress</a> of gambling can also lead to heart attacks in people at risk for them. The right treatment can help prevent many of these problems.
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Causes as cataloged by the DSM-5:</p>
<a>bipolar</a>, and anxiety disorders. Females also have a later age at onset of the disorder and seek treatment sooner, although rates of treatment seeking are low among individuals with gam­bling disorder regardless of gender.
<p>Compulsive gambling is treatable. Recognizing the problem is the first step toward treatment.</p>
<a>Psychotherapy</a> in the form of individual or group settings can help. For some people, support groups such as the 12-step Gamblers Anonymous are useful. This program adheres to abstinence principles similar to that of substance abuse and alcohol use.
<li>Medications: In combination with psychotherapy, the individual may benefit from <a>antidepressants</a>, mood stabilizers, opioid antagonists, or narcotic antagonists.</li>
<a>relapse</a> does happen. But with the right treatment, the chronic gambler can gain control over life.

<p>Once ingested, caffeine is absorbed and distributed quickly. After absorption, it passes into the brain. Caffeine does not accumulate in the bloodstream nor is it stored in the body. It is excreted in the urine hours after it has been consumed. </p>
<a>addiction</a>, the fact that overuse causes physical and psychological symptoms and that withdrawal symptoms develop when people stop drinking caffeinated beverages indicates the substance has addictive qualities.
<p>Symptoms of caffeine withdrawal can include:</p>

<p>Caffeine is defined as a drug because it is a central nervous system stimulant. Regular use of caffeine may cause a mild physical dependence.</p>
<p><a>Pregnant</a> women and people with coronary heart disease or peptic ulcers may be advised by their health care provider to restrict or avoid using caffeine.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>Alcohol Use Disorder </h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Alcohol is commonly used to celebrate, relax, or socialize with others. When someone drinks in excess, however, or drinks as a way to cope with stressors or avoid problems, it can create physical and psychological risks. </p>
<p>Alcohol Use Disorder is defined by the <a>DSM-5</a> as a problematic pattern of drinking that results in clinically significant impairment or distress, which takes the form of two or more of the following situations within a 12-month period:</p>
<li>Drinking more than intended, or doing so for a longer period of time than intended</li>
<li>Continually wanting or attempting unsuccessfully to cut down or stop drinking</li>
<li>Spending a lot of time getting alcohol, drinking, or recovering from its effects</li>
<li>Having a strong desire or urge to drink</li>
<li>Failing to fulfill major work, school, or home responsibilities due to drinking</li>
<li>Continuing to drink even though it is causing relationship troubles with family or friends</li>
<li>Prioritizing drinking by giving up or <a>cutting</a> back important activities</li>
<li>Drinking in situations in which it is physically dangerous</li>
<li>Continuing to drink even though one has a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that drinking has likely caused or made worse</li>
<li>Needing much more than was once needed to get the desired effect from alcohol, or not experiencing the same effect when drinking the same amount</li>
<li>Having withdrawal symptoms (trouble <a>sleeping</a>, shakiness, restlessness, nausea, sweating, a racing heart, a seizure, or sensing things that are not there) or drinking to relieve or avoid such symptoms</li>
<p>Alcoholism, or alcohol dependence, had been considered the most severe form of <a>alcohol abuse</a>. The DSM-5 integrates alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence into a single disorder with mild, moderate, and severe sub-classifications. </p>
<p>Mild: The presence of two to three of the above symptoms</p>
<p>Moderate: The presence of four to five of the above symptoms</p>
<p>Severe: The presence of six or more of the above symptoms. </p>
<p>When someone has been drinking alcohol to excess regularly and suddenly stops, they may experience alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms include:</p>
<p>Various health consequences are associated with alcohol abuse, including:</p>
<li>Increased incidence of cancer, particularly cancer of the larynx, esophagus, liver, and colon</li>
<li>Acute and or chronic pancreatitis—an inflammatory disease of the pancreas</li>
<li>Cirrhosis of the liver—fibrotic changes in the liver</li>
<li>Alcoholic neuropathy—degenerative changes in the <a>nervous system</a> affecting nerves responsible for sensation and movement</li>
<li>Alcoholic cardiomyopathy</li>
<li>Nutritional deficiencies</li>
<li>Fetal alcohol syndrome in the children of women who drink during <a>pregnancy</a></li>
<li>Alcohol-related <a>dementia</a></li>
<li>Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome or Wernicke's encephalopathy—a syndrome of the central nervous system that results in confusion, loss of balance, and loss of vision</li>

<a>substance abuse</a> by peers.
<p>The risk of abusing alcohol increases if individuals use drinking to numb themselves to their problems, to cope with anxiety, fears, or mood issues, or to enhance their <a>creativity</a>. Impulsivity is also linked to alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>Abstinence from alcohol is strongly recommended for those who:</p>
<li>Have tried cutting down but could not stay within their set limits </li>
<li>Have been diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder or are experiencing symptoms of one</li>
<li>Have a physical or mental condition that is caused or worsened by drinking</li>
<li>Are taking a <a>medication</a> that interacts with alcohol</li>
<li>Are or may become pregnant</li>
<p>Others may benefit from the <a>harm-reduction</a> approach, aimed at helping individuals reduce the impact of the consequences associated with drinking.</p>
<a>diet</a> with vitamin supplements is important.
<a>psychiatric</a> conditions, such as depression or
<a>psychotherapy</a> is often part of the harm-reduction approach.
<p>Seeking Help for Someone Who Is Unwilling</p>
<li>Stop all "coverups." Family members often make excuses or try to protect someone with a drinking problem from the consequences of drinking.</li>
<li>The best time to talk about drinking is shortly after an alcohol-related problem has occurred. Choose a time when the person is sober, both parties are fairly calm, and there is a chance to talk in private.</li>
<li>Be specific. Tell the person that there are worries about the drinking. Use examples of the ways in which it has caused problems, including the most recent incident.</li>
