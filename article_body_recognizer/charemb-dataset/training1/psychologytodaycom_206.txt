<h2> Rationalization in Therapy and Mental Health </h2>
<p>Many instances of rationalization can be relatively harmless. Producing a rationale that makes yourself feel better, even if it’s not completely honest, is sometimes a helpful coping strategy. </p>
<div> <h3> Why do people rationalize? </h3> </div>
<p>Rationalizing that contradiction with thoughts such as, “This company is just really close-minded,” or, “Taking time off will be a great opportunity” reduces that psychological discomfort.</p>
<div> <h3> What are the different types of rationalization? </h3> </div>
<p><a>Rationalization can take two forms:</a> “Sour grapes” refers to an explanation that avoids difficult information and “sweet lemons” is an explanation that makes the situation seem more palatable.</p>
<div> <h3> How is rationalization addressed in therapy? </h3> </div>
<p>A therapist may observe instances in which a person consistently offers seemingly confusing excuses or reasoning, and then ask questions to understand if the patient may be obscuring deeper emotions.</p>
<div> <h3> How can people stop rationalizing? </h3> </div>
<a>overcome this defense mechanism</a> is to develop the ability to accept the truth without that harming your entire
<a>identity</a>. Even if you failed to achieve a goal or faced bitter rejection, acknowledge the loss and recognize that everyone makes mistakes or faces obstacles at times.

<p>The prisoner's dilemma is a game used by researchers to model and investigate how people decide to cooperate—or not. </p>
<p>Imagine that Prisoner A and Prisoner B are charged with a <a>crime</a> and detained separately, and each has the chance to give a confession. Neither prisoner knows what the other will choose to do. There are several possible outcomes:</p>
<ul><li>If only one prisoner confesses, the confessor is set free, but the non-confessor serves a three-year sentence.</li> <li>If neither prisoner confesses, both serve a one-year sentence.</li> <li>If both confess, both serve two years.</li> </ul>
