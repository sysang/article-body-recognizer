<p>Locale. Some students do better in warm weather, others in a four-season climate. Some are wise to attend a college within laundry distance of home while others, for example, those with over-controlling parents, are wise to go further away.</p>
<a>Politics</a>: Some students are better off at a college with a decidedly liberal or conservative culture. A
<a>education</a> with renewed interest and, often, a career they’re eager to pursue.
<a>wisdom</a> requires pitting the value of a college’s name against the core criterion: What is a wise use of the college-bound student’s time and the family’s money?

<li>In some cases, Omicron "obsession" is merely a healthy fascination.</li>
<li>Other times, Omicron obsession is an ill-advised way to deal with fear of COVID or the result of unhealthy schadenfreude.</li>

<h3>Why the "obsession" and what to do . . . if anything</h3>
<p>Here are some reasons why people so-google "Covid" and "Omicron" and what, if anything, to do about it..</p>
<a>more worrisome variants including those not yet here</a>, and that vaccination and even boosting far from guarantees immunity.
<p>Schadenfreude. That’s feeling pleasure in another’s troubles. Schadenfreude can be felt for many reasons, for example, feeling that the unvaccinated deserve COVID, or resenting humankind because the person's life is difficult.</p>
<a>wise</a> to stop comparing yourself to others and instead accept yourself or take steps to improve?
<p>If thinking about COVID has become an obsession, might one or more of these ideas rein it in? Or should you consider your interest in COVID not an obsession but a harmless fascination?</p>

<p>Many lists of self-help books are of all-time bests: for example, Atomic Habits, How to Win Friends and Influence People, and The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.</p>
<h3>How to Change: The Science of Getting From Where You Are to Where You Want to Be</h3>
<h3>Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: The Workbook</h3>
<p><a>This is for the troubled person</a> who likes upbeat nuggets. It's basically just the author's notes from the past few years. Four of its messages are:</p>
<li>Sometimes, you don't need to leave the forest; just learn to live in it. </li>
<li>We aren't always at the world's mercy.</li>
<li>Our mind might make prisons, but it also gives us keys.</li>
<li>The hardest question I'm ever asked is, "How do you stay alive when you don't have a life?" You stay alive for other versions of you. For other people, yes, but also for the people you will be.</li>
<p>Novelist Ann Patchett (Bel Canto) <a>penned this collection of essays</a> about <a>friendship</a>, love, family, and loss. I am a fan of the essay form, especially when the writing is crystalline, as it is in this collection.</p>
<h3>Miracle and Wonder: Conversations With Paul Simon</h3>
<a>It's available only as an audiobook</a> because it intersperses Simon's music as he explains how experimenting and tinkering are core to his
<a>creativity</a>. Miracle and Wonder may be useful not just for creatives but for all of us.
<h3>Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know</h3>
<h3>What Happened to You?: Conversations on Trauma, Resilience, and Healing</h3>
<p><a>This is by Oprah Winfrey</a> in conversation with psychiatrist Dr. Bruce Perry. It will be valued by people who want to revisit their past <a>trauma</a>, and by people who want to better understand people who do.</p>
<h3>Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life</h3>
<a>philosophy</a> into thoughtful life advice.
<a>It's especially relevant</a> to people who tend to have an external
<a>locus of control</a> (blame others for their failures) and even more if they have a
<a>substance abuse</a> problem, which Peterson admits he has struggled with.
<h3>Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals</h3>
<a>this book encourages us to do less:</a> to prioritize and then leave space to savor moments. The author, Oliver Burkeman, makes the case that less is more. I'm not sure everyone should follow that—Sometimes more is more.

<h1> What Can You Still Believe In? </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective: Here are some under-considered possibilities. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Kirt Edblom, Wikimedia, CC 2.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>When we were young, there was more we believed in.</p>
<a>wise</a> to tell the truth. Our candor can subject us to the 3Cs: Censure, Censor, and Cancel.
<p>We believed in professional sports teams, whose players were loyal to their team through thick and thin. Now, already super-wealthy players will jump to another team for some more money.</p>
<h3>What can we believe in?</h3>
<p>It’s harder to live without pillars to lean on. Fortunately, there are less-often-considered things we can still believe in.</p>
<p>People who you can trust to be wise. If we've carefully decided with whom to spend time and to get to know better, we may have come to know people who are thoughtful and kind. They are people to believe in.</p>
<p>Lasting love. Many people find that the love they felt in the infatuation phase descended into something far less. But if you’ve found lasting love, that is to be believed in.</p>
<p>Your dog and maybe cat. Some cats and most dogs are quite loyal and sweet. They're easy to believe in. Indeed many people including <a>famous ones, admit to preferring dogs to people</a>.</p>
<p>Writers or books. My favorite author is Pat Conroy, author of The Prince of Tides and Beach Music. My favorite columnists are Thomas Friedman on the Left and Victor Davis Hanson on the Right.</p>
<p>Creative outlet. We have good reason to believe in the power of creative expression, whatever comes most naturally to you: visual art, performing art, writing, craftwork, whatever.</p>
<p>Principles to live by. Some people believe deeply in redistribution, meritocracy, utilitarianism, <a>productivity</a>, or work-life balance. What foundational principle(s) do you believe in?</p>
<p>Well-curated media. It’s easier to believe in media that present issues in full dimension. For example, these sites: Intelligencesquaredus.org, FairForAll.org, and C-SPAN.org.</p>
<p>Good charities. Of course, some charities spend too much on fat executive salaries and other administrative costs, but a good charity, especially a small local one at which you can see the benefit, is something to believe in.</p>
<p>Your favorite inanimate objects: Perhaps it's a comforting possession such as a cozy chair, pillow, blanket, shower head, or item of sentimental value such as a piece of jewelry or your photo album.</p>
<a>spiritual</a> side, are questioning their beliefs, not just about God and religion, but about the issues mentioned above. Perhaps one or more of the possibilities listed will provide you with some comfort and joy.

<h1> "You're Weird": When Being Peculiar Is to Be Venerated </h1>
<h2> How to appreciate someone else's differences instead of dismissing them. </h2>
<ul> <li>It's not uncommon for people to take different approaches to life.</li> <li>Instead of dismissing their perspective, get curious about it.</li> <li>Ask them why they make certain decisions and embrace open-mindedness.</li> </ul>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Kaz Vorpal/Flickr/CC 2.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>We claim to celebrate diversity, but some people stop celebrating when a person’s behavior departs from the standard. That can be true even when that departure is benevolent.</p>
<p>Here's an example. One of my clients brought his wife to a coaching session during which she called him "weird." Here's a paraphrase of what she said and my client's response. I’ve changed irrelevant details to protect my clients' anonymity.</p>
<a>anxiety</a> reduction. And I get good results and share what I know with other people in talks, and now I’m writing a book: What Actually Works in Reducing Anxiety.

<h1> 21 Movies to Curl Up With </h1>
<h2> Comfy visual chestnuts for the psychologically attuned. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Jan Vasek, Pixabay, Public Domain</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>These films are old chestnuts but not so old that they feel dated.</p>
<p>Lest the list be too idiosyncratic to my taste, films are included only if they have an average Amazon user review of 4.5 or higher. They average 4.8.</p>
<p>The Sound of Music. It has it all: supreme music, acting, a love story we care about, the iconic performance by Julie Andrews, and a powerful anti-Nazi message.</p>
<p>Fiddler on the Roof. Another music- and humor-leavened examination of a tough psychological issue: parents (Chaim Topol and Norma Crane) seeing their children adopt values that are very different from their own.</p>
<p>Moonlight. This is the coming-of-age story of a black gay <a>teen</a> (Ashton Sanders) triumphing over his drug-infested neighborhood. It won the Oscar for best picture.</p>
<a>Neurotic</a> Jew (Woody Allen) and insecure Midwesterner (Diane Keaton): A match made in heaven? Not quite. A psychotherapist would have a field day with those two. Indeed, Allen’s character is in his 15th year of
<a>psychoanalysis</a>: “I would have killed myself but I was in analysis with a strict
<a>Freudian</a>, and if you kill yourself they make you pay for the sessions you miss.” We laugh and may wryly nod. The American Film Institute rated it the second funniest romantic comedy of all time. (Charlie Chaplin's City Lights was ranked #1.)
<p>E.T. E.T. symbolizes “The Other,’ forbidding yet if you take a little time to know him, he's lovable. That may not be as easy in real life. Masterfully rendered by Steven Spielberg.</p>
<p>Parasite. This South Korean, Robin-Hoodesque black comedy is about a poor family that inveigles itself into a rich family's life. It won the Oscar for best picture.</p>
<p>Mary and Max. This animated adult film again honors the challenged, in this case, two obese people, one with <a>autism</a>. The film explores issues of <a>anxiety</a>, <a>depression</a>, and <a>suicide</a>.</p>
<a>bipolar disorder</a>, is released from a
<a>psychiatric</a> hospital. Jennifer Lawrence, who has an unnamed disorder, convinces him that it would be healing to enter a dance
<a>optimistic</a> look at a mentally ill person. Jack Nicholson, whose character has
<p>The Prince of Tides. Nick Nolte tries to deal with his Southern dysfunctional family with the help of psychiatrist Barbra Streisand. The film derives from Pat Conroy’s screenplay and book of the same title.</p>
<p>The Illusionist. This well-executes the time-honored romantic theme of two would-be lovers, (Edward Norton and Jessica Biel) separated by social class. Norton is a magician and ghostly machinations intervene.</p>
<a>cutting</a>-edge technology. Ironically, the film was lauded for its use of cutting-edge technology.
<p>Sleepless in Seattle. A <a>lonely</a> man (Tom Hanks) meets the girl of his <a>dreams</a> (Meg Ryan) by chance. Yeah, yeah, it’s sappy, but don't be Grinchy at the holidays. Embrace your inner sappiness.</p>

<h2> A Personal Perspective: Being psychologically attuned can make the difference. </h2>
<li>It can help to write each visitor's prime motivators for attending and any hot-button issues. </li>

<p>Many people are hosting family or friends at this time of year. Here are some thoughts on how to make the visit more fun than fraught.</p>
<a>politics</a>, COVID, whatever. Also, note any hot-button issues and whether you plan to discuss or skirt them.
<a>bonding</a>. But in other cases, for example, a long-unhealed family wound, this may not be the best time to address them. You don’t want the
<p>Of course, not all planned activities need to be psychologically oriented, but a few might be. Those have the bonus of being doable indoors in case winter weather precludes outdoor activities. Here are examples: Ask people to:</p>
<li>Tell their life story. Perhaps even set a timer for five or ten minutes, so people can be comfortable knowing how long they have the floor.</li>
<li>Say what they’re <a>grateful</a> for, thinking about these days, or looking forward to.</li>
<li>Give a 5- or 10-minute talk on whatever they care deeply about.</li>
<p>When it's time for them to leave, parting can be such sweet sorrow. You may maximize the sweetness by, as you say goodbye, revisiting the sweet, not necessarily any sorrowful.</p>
<p>Hosting friends or family at the holidays holds potential for in-the-moment pleasures and fond memories. I hope these ideas help you actualize that potential.</p>

<h1> Should You Bother With New Year's Resolutions? </h1>
<h2> The case for and against, plus ideas for boosting your chances of success. </h2>
<li>It can be hard to resolve to improve yourself. At the New Year, you may get the impetus, because many other people are making resolutions.</li>
<li>If you'll likely break your resolution, that could demotivate you to set goals at other times of the year.</li>
<li>There are myriad ways, psychological and practical, for boosting your chances of keeping your resolution.</li>

<h3>Boosting your chances of keeping a resolution</h3>
<p>Would any of the following make you more likely to keep your resolution at least for a while?</p>
<a>procrastinator</a> but your live-in partner is rather inert, that’s not the best role model. Or s/he abuses substances and you’re trying to cut down or quit.
<p>Then there are behavioral approaches to keeping a resolution:</p>
<li>Breaking your resolution into baby steps.</li>
<li>Telling a friend your resolution. You might be more motivated to stick to it because you don’t want to have to tell your friend that you failed.</li>
<li>Daily or weekly, report your progress or lack thereof to that friend or on social media.</li>
<li>Use the Stickk app. Here is how it works: If you don’t achieve your goal by your selected date, the money you've committed goes to the friend or nonprofit of your choice.</li>
<li>At least for starters, do you want to choose an easier goal?</li>
<li>Do you want to limit yourself to one resolution, so your efforts can be focused?</li>

<h1> 30 Smart Ways to Soothe Yourself </h1>
<h2> Side-effect-free self-comforters may be especially helpful at the holidays. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Clker-Free-Vector Images/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Self-soothers have gotten a bad rap, associated with substance abuse, overspending, overeating, and even <a>self-injury</a>, which releases a small amount of opioids.</p>
<p>But in our <a>stressful</a> times, and the holidays can be particularly so for some people, self-soothing is important, especially if you’re subject to getting overwhelmed.</p>
<p>1. Take three slow, deep breaths. Want to try that now?</p>
<p>2. Have a massage, even if it’s just to gently run your fingers over your other hand. Or use an electric massager.</p>
<p>3. Picture your most comforting image: for example, a fern-lined creek, clouds floating, a baby <a>sleeping</a>.</p>
<p>4. Listen to your favorite comforting music, perhaps something that has sentimental significance for you, like something you danced to or that your parent used to sing to you.</p>
<p>5. Look at photos, yours or those you find in a Google images search.</p>
<p>6. Hug yourself, a stuffed animal, or, yes, someone.</p>
<p>8. Gaze at a scented candle. Some people say that beeswax is healthier.</p>
<p>9. Stare at a fireplace. Don’t have one? YouTube has videos of crackling fireplaces as well as aquariums that are accompanied by comforting music.</p>
<p>10. Enjoy a low-calorie food you like. Don’t rush; savor it.</p>
<p>11. Swaddle yourself in a blanket, maybe a weighted blanket. Some people say it feels like a hug.</p>
<p>12. Hum or sing your favorite comforting song. If it creates an earworm (a song you can’t get out of your head), that may be additionally soothing.</p>
<p>13. Curl up in a comfy chair, maybe even a rocking chair.</p>
<p>14. Escape with a book, maybe in the aforementioned chair.</p>
<p>15. Rewatch a favorite funny or emotional movie or TV show.</p>
<p>16. Write in your journal. Or work on a blog post, article, or even that would-be Great American novel.</p>
<p>17. Take a walk, perhaps in nature.</p>
<p>18. Write, call, or get together with a friend.</p>
<p>19. Pet your dog or cat.</p>
<p>20. Go to your garden or where your houseplants are: plant, trim, or just look. You can do that even in winter. No houseplants? Want to get and nurture a few?</p>
<p>21. Drive somewhere, perhaps on a road with nice scenery and little traffic.</p>
<p>22. Have a warm drink, such as hot cocoa, coffee, or tea, especially a calming herbal tea like peppermint.</p>
<p>23. Take a shower or bath, maybe even a bubble bath.</p>
<p>24. Do something crafty: draw, knit, take photos, whatever.</p>
<p>25. Savor your daily routine, perhaps just your bedtime or morning ritual.</p>
<p>26. Savor your favorite hard candy.</p>
<p>30. Think of or even picture something you’re looking forward to.</p>

<h1> Mind Games We Play on Ourselves </h1>
<h2> Some mind games can be helpful, but not all. </h2>
<li>Helpful mind games can include creating an artificial deadline, suppressing a negative thought, and pretending you’re your best self.</li>
<li>Harmful mind games can include hypermonitoring your health, zoning out, and deliberately triggering others.</li>
<li>It’s helpful to become aware of both helpful and harmful mind games you may be using.</li>

<p>We sometimes play mind games with ourselves. Some are helpful, others not.</p>
<p>If you use these and find them of value, great. If not, do you want to try one or more?</p>
<p>Pretending you’re your best self. Like most people, you’re insecure, at least in some situations. So as you’re facing something scary, you pretend you’re not your insecure you but your most justifiably confident self.</p>
<p>So, is there a helpful mind game that you want to be sure you continue to use? Is there a harmful mind game you want to banish from your mind? Not a bad New Year's resolution.</p>

<h2> A Personal Perspective: Psychological questions to answer, movies to watch. </h2>
<div> <h3>Key points</h3> <ul> <li>This may be a particularly good year to skip the standard New Year's Eve blow-out party.</li> <li>There are questions to ask yourself and others that are particularly appropriate today.</li> </ul> </div>

<h3>Activities for psychologically oriented people</h3>
<p>Ask and answer one or more questions.</p>
<p>Whether you'll be alone or with people, consider asking and answering these:</p>
<li>In five or ten minutes, tell your life's most emotionally significant moments.</li>
<li>Tell or show something. Or try the extended version of that: Give a five- or ten-minute talk on whatever you care deeply about.</li>
<li>What's an important way you act like one of your parents?</li>
<li>What's one thing that men need to better understand about women and vice-versa?</li>
<li>If you were the COVID czar, what would be your first edict in 2022?</li>
<li>What one thing would you most want to accomplish in 2022?</li>
<li>As we enter the new year, should you make a resolution? If so what, and what could boost your chances of keeping it?</li>

<li>Failure is the opportunity to begin again more intelligently. – Henry Ford</li>
<li>You wanna fly? You got to give up the sh*t that weighs you down. — Toni Morrison</li>
<li>You don’t have to see the whole staircase. Just take the first step. — Martin Luther King Jr.</li>
<li>It isn’t always a change of scenery needed to make life better. Sometimes it simply requires opening your eyes. – Richelle Goodrich</li>
<li>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. – Walt Disney</li>
<p>I selected them only on those criteria but it turns out that all of them arguably send a standard Hollywood liberal message. That, in itself, might make for an interesting topic of conversation, although perhaps too heavy for New Year's.</p>

<h3>Responding to a Prospect's Email or Voicemail</h3>
<p>Recently, I wrote this response to a prospect's query. In italics, I note the embedded principles.</p>
<p>This prospect is a burned-out English teacher with a background in musical theatre.</p>
<p>Hi Tom (name changed to protect the person’s anonymity),</p>
<p>(finding common ground ): I too love good books. My favorite is All The Light We Cannot See, and I have a pile of books next to my bed. (A bit of candid revelation can be <a>bonding</a>.)</p>
<li>Changing the way you teach English: different books, dressing up in costume, or as I did,: having my class act out scenes or a short play. (Three examples is often optimal: That gives choices but not so many that it's overwhelming.)</li>
<li>Teaching a different subject or grade level.</li>
<li>Trying to get a job at a school with more motivated kids.</li>
<li>Providing an after-school musical theatre program, whether self-employed or at some children's theatre program at your school or an outside one.</li>
<li>Something outside the world of teaching or theatre, yet to be determined. (If the prospect chooses that option, it suggests s/he would benefit from career counseling.)</li>
<p>What do you think? (J.W. Marriott called those the four most powerful words.)</p>
<p>Even though I sent my response Sunday, the day after Christmas, the person responded in ten minutes, requesting an appointment.</p>

<h1> Potentials and Limits of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective on iconic psychologist Albert Ellis's assertions. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Therapy? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Oliver Kepka, Pixabay, Public Domain</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p><a>Cognitive-behavioral</a> therapy is today's dominant <a>psychotherapy</a> modality, and Albert Ellis is one of its founders and most respected exponents. Here are some of his assertions, my yes-ands, and yes-buts.</p>
<p><a>Happiness</a> is experienced largely in striving towards a goal, not in having attained things,</p>
<p>Convince yourself that worrying about many situations will make them worse.</p>
<p>Even when people act nastily to you, don't condemn them or retaliate.</p>
<p>Again, easier said than done although worth aspiring to. When someone does something evil, your reflexive response may be to get sad or mad, but it’s what you next that matters. Try to distract yourself to something constructive or fun.</p>
<p>Even injustice has its good points. It gives me the challenge of being as happy as I can in an unfair world.</p>
<p>Viewing injustice as merely a challenge to be happy may be unrealistic or even undesirable— Outrage can fuel efforts to right a wrong.</p>
<p>Decide your problems are your own. Do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. </p>
<a>trauma</a>, but usually it's wise to quickly move forward. For example, I've known dozens of Holocaust survivors and, on average, the ones that kept revisiting the horrors were less happy than those who focused on taking steps forward.
<p>The trouble with most therapy is that it helps you feel better, but you don't get better. You have to back it up with action, action, action.</p>
<a>psychoanalysis</a>. Moving quickly to behavior change can not only improve your practical life but reduce the emotional pain—Behavior change can precede emotional change.
<p>There are three musts that hold us back: I must do well, you must treat me well, and the world must be easy.</p>
<p>By honestly acknowledging your past errors but never damning yourself for them, you can learn to use your past for your own future benefit.</p>
<p>The attitude of unconditional self-acceptance is probably the most important variable in (clients') long-term recovery.</p>
<p>I don’t agree. Not fully accepting oneself drives a person to improve.</p>
<p>Most of what we call <a>anxiety</a> is overconcern about what someone thinks of you.</p>
<p>Often that's not true, for example, regarding the common <a>fear of death</a> or dying.</p>
<p>The art of love... is largely the art of persistence.</p>
<h2>Therapy Essential Reads</h2>
<div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Turning the Tables: Shifting From Victim to Perpetrator</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Red Flags to Watch Out for in Therapy</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div>
<p>By not caring too much about what people think, I'm able to think for myself and propagate ideas that are very often unpopular. </p>
<a>wisdom</a>, so it's worth considering, although not always accepting, what others might think.
<p>Like all approaches, cognitive-behavioral therapy has strengths and limitations. The wise practitioner and client know that fixing often requires more than one tool.</p>

<h1> Honoring a Playful Nature </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective: A key to being a helpful counselor, coworker, or friend. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pxhere, CCO, Public Domain</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Perhaps paradoxically, many of my career counseling clients are play-centric. With such clients as well as with playful coworkers and friends, I’ve found it helpful to infuse playfulness.</p>
<p> I embed in italics other counseling and communication principles I used.</p>
<p>Chris: I don't know. (She laughed nervously:) It just seemed like work.</p>
<a>intuition</a> said I should try to capitalize on her playfulness:) Would it help to picture yourself as the ringmaster of a three-ring circus?
<p>Chris: I like that metaphor. Work has always been a sideshow for me but now I need to take charge and tame that lion.</p>
<p>Marty: (It’s often helpful to go to the well until it runs dry:) Anything else about that metaphor that works for you?</p>
<p>Chris: (Her voice dropped:) Well, like a ringmaster, I need a little showmanship.</p>
<p>Marty: (Of course, it helps to note not only the words but changes of voice.) I noticed your voice quaver a bit when you said that.</p>
<p>Chris: I’d be embarrassed to sell myself.</p>
<p>Marty: Why do you think so? (<a>Embarrassment</a> at job searching usually is caused by <a>fear</a> of imposing or embarrassment at having to look for work, but not always, as was the case here:)</p>
<p>Chris: Because what I mainly bring to the HR department (her previous jobs were in HR) are storytelling and metaphor development. Those don't connect directly to the bottom line, which is what they mainly care about.</p>
<p>Marty: Is there a way you could legitimately connect storytelling and metaphor to the bottom line?</p>
<p>Chris: It’s squooshy but I believe it increases employee morale and retention.</p>
<p>Marty: Sometimes, indirect benefit to the bottom line is enough so maybe that would work, but do you want to think of a category of employer that might more value a storyteller and who comes up with apt metaphors? </p>
<p>(I could have come up with the following solution but it’s usually <a>wise</a> to try to get the ideas to come from the person. Only if that fails is it time to ask if s/he'd like a suggestion.)</p>
<p>Chris: <a>Marketing</a> departments and marketing consulting firms.</p>
<p>Chris: I still think I’d feel embarrassed.</p>
<p>Chris: Yes. Right before I’m going to work on my job search, I need to sing a song, make an origami crane, something like that, and when I’m writing, have fun music on.</p>
<p>Marty: Okay, let’s be silent for another 30 seconds and get in touch with how you’re feeling about the plan.</p>

<h1> Honoring the Serious Person </h1>
<h2> Personal Perspective: Upbeat people are fun, but seriousness has its pluses too. </h2>
<li>It's tempting to avoid serious types of people.</li>
<li>If only because we claim to welcome diversity, we need to give our time to and even perhaps honor serious people.</li>
<li>Attempting to cheer them up may well backfire; it's often better to make the most of their natural demeanor.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Usman Yousaf/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>People vary in temperament from playful to serious. An effective communicator adapts to reflect that. Doing so is helpful whether you’re a friend, coworker, salesperson, or romantic partner.</p>
<p>The previous installment discussed the merits of the playful person. Here we turn to the serious person. Here’s a composite of one drawn from my clients and other people I know.</p>
<a>DNA</a>. I’m most comfortable talking about and doing tasks, no-nonsense. And when I’m relaxing, I'd rather watch C-SPAN than Comedy Central and read Psychology Today than People.
<h3>Interacting with a serious person</h3>
<a>wise</a> to aim toward acceptance of differences.
<p>You might even encourage the serious person. For example, consider revealing something serious and important about yourself or the world, and maybe even ask their advice: “So, what do you think?”</p>

<h1> Lies We Tell Ourselves </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective: Nine common self-delusions. </h2>
<li>It can be helpful to be aware of self-delusions that we should shed.</li>
<li>Sometimes a little excess optimism may fuel us to bigger accomplishments than clear-eyed rationality would allow.</li>
<li>Unvarnished realism isn’t always wise, but neither are unexamined lies we tell ourselves. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Kalhh/pxhere, public pomain</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Sometimes it’s healthy to delude ourselves. Facing all our fears head-on could yield more unhappiness than benefit. And a little excess optimism may fuel us to bigger accomplishments than clear-eyed rationality would allow.</p>
<p>But it can help to be aware of whether you want to curb, indulge, or even increase your “irrational exuberance."<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>To that end, here are nine possible lies we tell ourselves:</p>
<a>lying</a> to themselves when they say they deserve better. How about you?
<a>trauma</a>, bad society, bad luck, or other externalization. There may be some truth to those, but the question is: "Is your explanation of your sloth significantly a lie you’re telling yourself?"
<a>Wise</a> One think of your child? And does that suggest that you need to praise more, do more to help your child improve, or mostly just accept your child for who s/he is?
<p>9. Perhaps most important: other (specify.) There are myriad other ways we can fool ourselves. Think about your behaviors and beliefs in your work life and personal life. Are you telling yourself any lies?</p>
<p>Unvarnished realism isn’t always wise, but neither are unexamined lies we tell ourselves. As you review those nine potential sources of self-delusion, is there at least one lie you’re telling yourself that you’d like to shed?</p>

<h1> 7 Escapes from Stress </h1>
<h2> Most people need some escape from life's stresses. Are your escapes serving you? </h2>

<p>To try to cope with life, many of us use self-soothers, play <a>mind-games on ourselves</a>, even <a>lie to ourselves.</a></p>
<a>wise</a> to escape feelings of anxiety, but other times it's not. But it's unquestionably wise to consciously decide whether, how, and how much to escape.
<p>To that end, would you like to maintain, increase, decrease, or not use these escapes?</p>
<p>Extended travel: This might include trekking to a far-away wedding or to the Himalayas in search of enlightenment.</p>
<p>Solohood: Even <a>extroverts</a> need some alone time to recharge or for some freedom to do what they want, when they want, how they want. But some people escape further—they make solohood their way of life.</p>
<p>Some other form of escape (Specify):</p>
<p>It's easy to get overwhelmed by all the possibilities for escape. So, as you review your answers to the above, you might aim to find just one that you'd like to use more, less, or stop.</p>

<h1> How to Become Special </h1>
<h2> Five options to consider. </h2>
<li>Often, the most practical approach for becoming more special is to build on your existing strengths.</li>
<li>Another way to be more special is to become expert in a career microniche.</li>
<li>You also can differentiate yourself by building into your professional or personal life an interest or distinctive part of your personality. </li>

<p>Whether in our work or personal life, most people want to feel special, not just be like everyone else.</p>
<p>I had a client today (I change irrelevant details to protect anonymity) who runs a small architecture firm. She lamented feeling ordinary. Here’s a paraphrase of what she said and the essence of the exchange that followed:</p>
<p>Client: I was hoping to be special but so far, I’m not—Another architect could do what I do. And my firm isn’t doing that well.</p>
<p>Me: It seems there are two options. The first is to build on your strengths and skirt your weaknesses so, in toto, you are special and in a good way. The other option is to consider if there might be a better-suited career.</p>
<p>Client: We should talk about both of those options but let’s start with what I might do if I stay as an architect.</p>
<p>Me: What would you say are your main strengths and weaknesses as an architect?</p>
<p>Client: I’m good with details like project specs and the production work, but I'm bad at selling and the vision thing.</p>
<p>Me: Is it realistic to rejigger your job description to emphasize your strengths?</p>
<p>Me: Do you think it’s worth trying to improve your selling or the vision thing?</p>
<p>Client: I don't think so.</p>
<p>Me: Then, is it realistic to hire someone to handle the selling, and when a project needs a bold vision, to hire someone as a consultant?</p>
<p>Me: Then maybe a bit of low-risk exploration would be wise. Is there anyone who comes to mind who could fill one or both of those roles with whom you should chat?</p>
<p>Client. I can think of two.</p>
<p>If all that leads you to conclude it's worth considering a career change, in our next session, we can explore what might be wise options. How does that sound?</p>
<p>Yes, build on strengths. Per that example, my clients have most often found that building on strengths, even if they're just slivers of strength, not world-beating, is the most likely route to being special and feeling special.</p>
<p>But there are other approaches that may work as well or better for you. Examples:</p>
<a>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a> is poor, its typology is helpful: All of us are either more thinking- or feeling-centric,
<a>extroverted</a> or introverted, judging or perceiving. I'd add abstract or sensory, Do you stand out in one of those characteristics? Could you build on that to make you more special?
<p>So, turning to you, think about yourself at work and in your personal life. Would you like to be more special in either? If so, do any of the above hold promise for you?</p>
