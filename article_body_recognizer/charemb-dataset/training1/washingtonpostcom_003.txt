<h2>To celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, we asked Asian chefs and celebrities what role food plays in their lives</h2>

<p>My moments of joy are around the dining table, starting with rice, whose aroma is my favorite in the world: the signal that dinner will soon be ready.</p>
<p>In the Asian American Pacific Islander community, food is how we show love. It’s how we communicate, how we cope and find comfort. Instead of hugs, my family piles more into your bowl.</p>
<p>[8 tips about Asian cooking from Martin Yan, Grace Young and other experts]</p>
<b> </b>“embarrassed about bringing it to school. But as I turned into a young adult, I really missed those flavors that reminded me of my mom’s table and kitchen.”
<a>history of discrimination</a> in the United States and the
<a>uptick of anti-Asian attacks</a> during the pandemic, I decided to focus on how food connects and comforts so many of us during this time.
<p>[<a>Perspective | How Asian restaurants helped me heal after a hate-crime attack</a>]</p>
<p>We also asked readers about the Asian dishes bringing them comfort. <a>Read their stories here.</a></p>
<p>“Something I will be chasing for the rest of my life is to be able to re-create the dishes that my mom cooked to her level,” said Christine Ha, chef of two Houston restaurants.</p>
<b> </b>in the kitchen. She couldn’t go near the knives or the oven and only did “some small tasks like rolling egg rolls or mixing the filling for egg rolls,” the second-generation Vietnamese American said.
<p>But when her mother died when she was 14, leaving no recipes behind, she missed the flavors that reminded her of her mother’s table and kitchen. During college,<b> </b>she set out to re-create her mother’s cooking by memory.</p>
<p>Her comfort dish is fried rice, something her mom occasionally made “sauteing<b> </b>up some rice in a skillet, maybe with some Chinese sausage and egg and green onion.”</p>
<p>Ha made headlines as the first blind contestant on Fox’s “MasterChef” in 2012, a fact she embraces when she introduces herself, even naming her first restaurant <a>The Blind Goat</a>.</p>
<p>This includes speaking up for her Asian American community. She hasn’t personally come across racist incidents, but her staff has.</p>

<p>Food is “the most powerful equalizer and diffuser against discrimination, against hatred,” said Martin Yan, an Asian American who appeared on television before celebrity chefs were commonplace.</p>
<p>Hot pot is also the perfect meal to eat together when everything is open again after the pandemic, Yan said.</p>
<a>Graham Kerr’s “The Galloping Gourmet” </a>and
<a>Julia Child’s “The French Chef.”</a> His motto is
<a>“If Yan can cook, so can you!”</a>
<p>[<a>Martin Yan's Chicken and Asparagus Stir-Fry</a>]</p>
<p>His father’s life wasn’t easy. In Portland, Ore., even after running a cafe and small jewelry store, he could not buy property as a Chinese immigrant, so he and the family returned to Guangzhou.</p>
<p>He did not return to the United States until he attended the University of California at Davis on a church sponsorship and started teaching cooking classes.</p>
<a>n/soto</a>, which features bento boxes with collaborations. Among others, she has worked with
<b> </b>Los Angeles’ Japanese American National Museum and supported the Little Tokyo Community Council, which provided other restaurants with
<b> </b>grants during the pandemic.
<p>When Hamza Khan hit a “random rough patch in life,” he needed to find something to get him through.</p>
<b> </b>one episode that he felt spoke directly to him: When
<a> chef Ana Ros of Slovenia</a> introduced a dish made with local marble trout, sea asparagus and anchovy water.
<p>“Just making desserts keeps me grounded,” Khan said.</p>
<p>His parents were understanding.</p>
<a>YouTube</a> to create tutorials. He was already on
<a>Instagram</a> and “pictures just seemed like a really easy thing to do.” On
<a>Twitter</a>, he found community among
<b> </b>fellow Muslims and South Asians.
<p>“You start to realize, oh, we’re not alone,” Khan said.</p>
<p>Besides testing recipes, he’s using social media to connect with other South Asian bakers, who advise him on<b> </b>how to perfect his skills, such as how to make croissants.</p>
<p>“I wanted to see who I was and how I want to put that on the plate.”</p>
<p>After months and months of attempts at croissants, he put his own spin on them with <a>pistachios</a>, a common ingredient in South Asian and Arab cultures, he said.</p>
<p>His comfort food reminds him<b> </b>of where he was raised.</p>
<p>After living in both Pakistan and the United States, he is not surprised by the recent attacks on Asian Americans.</p>
<p>“I think the smartest thing I ever did in my life was taking the time to go home and learn my family’s recipes,” said Grace Young, a food writer in her 60s who has worked in food development and styling since her 20s.</p>
<p>At first, her parents, then in their 70s and 80s, were hesitant to teach her, because they were not professional cooks.</p>
<p>[Five basic rules for woks from Grace Young]</p>
<p>So naturally, Young’s comfort food, wok-seared bok choy with shiitake mushrooms, goes back to her family.</p>
<p>Like her father, she also frequently visited Chinatown for food and noticed when Chinatown in Manhattan was becoming deserted last year because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>[<a>Asian American businesses are defending themselves against rise in anti-Asian violence</a>]</p>
<p>She ended up documenting “the last day Chinatown was Chinatown” on March 15, producing <a>an oral history with videographer Dan Ahn</a> on how Manhattan’s Chinatown was impacted by the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We’ve lost legacy restaurants and shops that have been a part of Chinatown. They’re not just places to eat and shop, but they hold your memories and they were pillars of the community,” Young said.</p>

<p>So when it came time to name his new book, Koy of course thought of food and dubbed it “Mixed Plate.”</p>
<p>His book dives into how he grew up and became a comedian, but also how to make the food he grew up with, from lumpia to pancit. It includes a recipe for one of his favorites, chicken adobo, his comfort food now.</p>
<a>“Easter Sunday.”</a> “I still remember the flavor that popped off in my mouth. I was like, ‘Oh my God, what is this?’…
<b> </b>because once you try it, you fall in love with it. It’s a no-brainer.”
<p>But growing up he found that his family’s food was not always easy to introduce to schoolmates, especially when his mom used a Cool Whip container to pack Filipino food for school lunches.</p>
<p>“The older you get, you start telling your stories. You start realizing that you weren’t alone,” said Koy, whose full name is Joseph Glenn Herbert.</p>
<p>When Jiyeon Lee thinks of comfort food, she remembers cooking with her mother and grandmother in the South Korean countryside.</p>
<p>It’s her third restaurant, after two failed attempts with a sushi spot and a cafeteria inside an<b> </b>office building. But this is also her second career, after immigrating to America at 28, and after shooting to fame as a pop star.</p>
<p>This led to restaurants in America, and the “little butterflies” returned like at the beginning of her singing career.</p>
<a>March killing of eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at three spas</a>, she said: “That tragedy that happened in Atlanta, it was such a shock to the Asian community.”
<p>“I’ve lived in Atlanta for 21 years, but I never really feel racism toward Asians. … Ignorance, yes … but not violence,” she said.</p>
<p>Still, to be on the safe side, she says, she carries pepper spray when she walks her dog at night.</p>
<p>Preeti Mistry does not shy away from speaking out.</p>
<p>Before the racial reckoning came down hard on the <a>food industry</a>, singling out such institutions as <a>Bon Appétit</a>, the chef was vocal about issues of inclusion and identity.</p>
<a>“Your Korean Dad”</a> on TikTok for his wholesome takes on life, is one of the subjects of their new podcast, “
<a>Loading Dock Talks</a>.”

<b> </b>queer intelligence and the immigrant experience.
<p>In the episode featuring Cho, the two reminisced about how their immigrant parents assimilated.</p>

<b> </b>learn and grow their businesses. “I think that it is important that I have to have a desire to fight for my business, for my team, for my family, because this drive, I can do my part and help my staff and help the economy.”
<p>Her comfort food is what her mom gave her to recover during tough times, a dish known at her restaurant as "Super Soup.”</p>
<p>“It is not like Thailand, where we were taught to welcome foreigners. We look at foreigners as better than us,” she said. “If you just come from America, we want to be like you, you’re above us.”</p>
<p>But she hopes that food will be that “good example of how we do business … We are trustworthy. We are good. We share food and we also share the way we do business and treat people the right way.”</p>
<p>His family spent the last three generations in Hawaii, with his grandparents immigrating from the Philippines as teenagers. So when he thinks of food, it’s “always through the lens of Hawaii and Filipino.”</p>
<p>It includes a “perfect hamburger patty, a fried egg and gravy all over,” on top of a bed of Simeon’s favorite ingredient.</p>
<p>“I could never go a day without rice,” said Simeon, 39, who laughs at the thought. “I love rice beyond anything.”</p>
<p>Like its food, Hawaii itself is often misunderstood.</p>

<div><div><h1>‘Not enough has happened’: Protesters reflect on what has changed — and what hasn’t </h1><h2>About US caught up with protesters we profiled during the 2020 protests after the murder of George Floyd. </h2></div></div>
<span><div><span><div>By <div><div>Rachel Hatzipanagos</div></div></div>,</span></div><div><span><div><div><div>Marian Liu</div></div></div> and </span></div><div><span><div><div><div>Kanyakrit Vongkiatkajorn</div></div></div></span></div></span>
<p>Protesters sought not only justice for Floyd, but wide-ranging reforms including the defunding of police and reallocating money for law enforcement to mental health, social services and other resources.</p>
<p>[Voices of protest: Why this movement matters ]</p>
<p>Few communities have embraced the bold changes demonstrators were seeking.</p>
<p>“Not enough has happened,” said Xavier Brown, 20.</p>
<p>But the conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin of murder in Floyd’s death did give protesters hope that progress is being made, albeit slowly.</p>
<p>Some protesters have uplifted their lives, while others have faced harassment.</p>
<p>“We can protest and we’ll keep protesting. The next generation will protest until we get some justice in this country, because we aren’t going anywhere,” Williams said.</p>
<p>Following is how some of the protesters are doing a year later.</p>
<p>After Floyd’s death, Brown protested to express the pain that he was feeling.</p>
<p>A year later, after a dozen protests, Brown is still planning and participating<b> </b>in protests.</p>
<p>And, while Brown said not enough change has occurred, with a new case of police brutality in the headlines "every other week,” awareness has increased.</p>
<p>“Black Lives Matter became one of the largest social movements that this world has ever seen,” said Brown, a sophomore at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>[Five Americans ponder the impact of George Floyd’s death and Derek Chauvin’s trial]</p>
<p>The protests have also helped Brown to find community. The Oakland native admits that he does not always feel safe.</p>
<p>“Sometimes when I’m out protesting, honestly, I feel more safe than other times, because I know that I have people around me that truly believe the same thing as me … that we’re all in this together,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition to protesting, he’s also working on releasing his own music and art, and selling shirts that say, “Our future is bright, stand by our side” in support of Black organizations.</p>
<p>“It is sometimes overwhelming when you’re constantly fighting for your life,” Brown said. “You kind of want to have something that promotes Black excellence, that promotes that we’re good.”</p>
<p>Littlewolf peacefully protested in Minneapolis last year with many others, including babies and elders, as police rained down rubber bullets on them.</p>
<p>[George Floyd’s America: Examining systemic racism and racial injustice in the post-civil rights era]</p>
<p>It was “a healing process that needed to happen where the community can be together in that same space,” Littlewolf said.</p>
<p>When Anniston Weber, 22, first held a Black Lives Matter protest in her small Kansas town last June, she wasn’t entirely surprised to see Trump supporters show up, revving their engines and yelling racial slurs at protesters.</p>
<p>“It shows that there are people in this town that are openly bigoted, even if we don’t like to admit it,” Hays said at the time.</p>
<p>“I was very vocal about being in support of changing the mascot … and that kind of put a target on my back,” Weber said.</p>
<p>A group of residents formed a Facebook group where people shared Weber’s home address and discussed strategies to get her fired from her job, she said. It got bad enough that she had to ask the police to patrol her home for a few weeks.</p>
<p>“I was terrified,” Weber said. “I got several Facebook messages of people calling me to go kill myself, that I was a nuisance to the area and that I should leave if I hate it here so much.”</p>
<p>This weekend, she is helping organize the first-ever Juneteenth celebration in her town. But things are slow to change.</p>
<p>Zach Rosenberg said he had thought the protests would be a tipping point for changes in policing reform, but things haven’t changed as quickly as he had hoped.</p>
<p>“I really feel like the protests helped to accelerate what has been a really long-term change in American society toward policing and the criminal justice system,” said Rosenberg. But, he knows that it will be a long-term process.</p>
<p>“We’re going to see, unfortunately, a lot more George Floyd’s and Breonna Taylors’ before these issues get solved in any really meaningful way. ”</p>
<p>The Hmong activist, who has since participated in a dozen protests, said it was “extremely complicated” when one of four of the officers charged in Floyd’s death was a Hmong.</p>
<p>The community came together again at protests in “support and solidarity,” said Yang, when only 10 miles away from the Derek Chauvin trial, another Black man, Daunte Wright, was killed by police during a traffic stop.</p>
<p>[A year after George Floyd’s death, Minneapolis remains scarred, divided]</p>
<p>And when Chauvin’s guilty verdict was read, many community members were gathered in George Floyd Square, near the site where Floyd was killed. Just being there is cathartic now, Yang said.</p>
<p>“It’s a place where you can celebrate, grieve together and hold each other,” Yang said. “There was loss and now there’s like a reclaiming.”</p>
<p>Cedric Caschetta would not have expected that a Black Lives Matter protest he organized in small-town Indiana last year would change his life. At the protest, he was met with gun-toting residents, and a video of the encounter went viral.</p>
<p>“After the protests and seeing the actual amazing involvement of the community, it drove me to want to do more and be a part of more,” Caschetta said.</p>
<p>Caschetta was drawn to the larger protests in Washington, D.C., and visited and participated. While in the nation’s capital, he visited Howard University and the school made such an impression on him that he decided to transfer.</p>
<p>“I knew if I took this risk, regardless of what happened, that I could, reap the benefits of having an HCBU education,” he said</p>
<p>“It's cool to see the different choices of food that I have, and it's so cool that I can drive 20 minutes and be in a different state,” Caschetta said.</p>
<p>“Over the next year, I think there will be more of a push [for change] because the younger generation is getting out of high school. They’re getting wiser,” Caschetta said. “Our voices need to be heard.”</p>

<div><div><div>Jan. 5, 2022</div></div></div>
<a>attacks</a>, I was all too familiar with the scenario and how it could easily escalate into violence. I had recently interviewed 61-year-old
<a>Noel Quintana</a>, whose face was slashed cheek-to-cheek with a box knife while he was on his way to work on the New York subway. Another victim I spoke to,
<a>Iona Cheng</a>, was tackled to the ground as she delivered a Christmas gift near Oakland’s Jack London Square — not far from where I used to hang out with friends growing up
<b> </b>so many times in my life — when I was repeatedly asked where I was from or told to go back there — I avoided conflict at all costs. Like many immigrants, I had long believed that the nail that sticks up gets hammered down.
<p>[<a>Have you ever felt the need to Anglicize your name to fit in? Tell us your story.</a>]</p>
<a>traditional immigrant family</a>, I learned Mandarin first. Then, starting in kindergarten, I had to take English-as-a-second-language classes and speech therapy, and had a rough time fitting in. So, I
<b> </b>became a journalist with hopes of squashing stereotypes. But while I was proactively calling out
<a>racism</a> in my stories, I wasn’t doing the same in my personal life — not even with my own name.
<b> </b>I was no exception: Over the years, I’d essentially erased the middle two words of the name on my birth certificate: Marian Chia-Ming Liu.
<a>hate crimes</a> against Asian people jumped 73 percent. According to a
<a>Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White</a>.”
<a>Atlanta spa shootings</a> were released in March of last year, there was a movement on social media to not only say their names but to also pronounce them correctly. The Asian American Journalists Association even released a
<a>torn off doors</a> at Columbia University dorms, Chinese students got together and made
<a>a video explaining what their names meant</a>.
<b> </b>He further dared me to drop my American name in lieu of my Chinese one. But that doesn’t tell my whole story either. Instead I’m going to start by telling folks I have a Chinese name and how to properly pronounce my last name.
<b> </b>is Marian Chia-Ming Liu. Chia is pronounced with a J, like Jiā. Liu like Leo. And yes, it includes all four words. I’m proud of it all, because it represents my complete self, Asian and American.

<div><div><p>The appointments are the first major management changes under Buzbee, who took over leadership of The Post at the end of May after the retirement earlier this year of her predecessor, Martin Baron.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The changes involve editors whose names appear immediately under Buzbee’s in The Post’s published management chart, known as its masthead.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Chris Wallace leaves Fox News for a CNN streaming show: ‘I’m ready for a new adventure’</h1></div>
<h2>The veteran anchor’s abrupt departure is a blow to Fox, which often pointed to his tough, nonpartisan interviewing style as proof of the network’s journalistic bona fides</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Paul Farhi</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Amy B Wang</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Jeremy Barr</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 12, 2021|Updated December 12, 2021 at 2:43 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>CNN announced the news about two hours after Wallace offered an abrupt farewell to viewers of “Fox News Sunday,” the interview program he has hosted for 18 years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wallace will host a program on CNN Plus, the streaming service CNN will launch early next year.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From 2020: Chris Wallace is uniquely qualified to interview Trump — and uniquely independent at Fox News</p></div>
<p>Wallace frequently appeared on other Fox shows throughout the week, and his “Fox News Sunday” was carried on Fox affiliates across the country. But on Sunday morning, he said that this week’s installment would be his last.</p>
<div><div><p>Wallace’s departure from Fox is the third major change among cable-news personalities in the past eight days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He joined Fox in 2003, at a time considered to be a coup for a cable-news network that had only just passed its seventh birthday and that was eager to establish itself as more than just a fount of conservative commentary.</p></div></div>
<a>whom he fiercely grilled in 2018</a> about attacks on journalists who had criticized the regime, much to Putin’s visible annoyance. He was lauded for a
<a>tough July 2020 interview of Trump</a>, pushing back against Trump’s false or misleading data points regarding the
<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic and other topics.
<div><p>From 2015: 'I certainly think my style is adversarial': Chris Wallace on moderating the presidential debate</p></div>
<a>Fox laid off political editor Chris Stirewalt</a> amid criticism from Trump’s camp that the network had prematurely called Arizona for Biden on election night, a ruling that proved to be accurate. Last month, two on-air guest commentators,
<a>Jonah Goldberg and Stephen Hayes, quit Fox</a> over concerns about a
<a>NPR reported</a> last month that Wallace, along with Baier, had raised objections with network executives about Carlson’s “Patriot Purge” series. Yet Wallace has remained publicly discreet and has
<a>long bristled</a> when asked by interviewers about the work of his Fox opinion colleagues.
<p>While Cameron has emerged as a critic of Fox’s programming decisions, he noted that Wallace chose to stay out of the fray. “He was very cautious about getting into those types of discussions, for the most part,” Cameron said.</p>
<div><div><p>Fox issued a simple statement on Sunday about Wallace’s departure: “We are extremely proud of our journalism and the stellar team that Chris Wallace was a part of for 18 years.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It has not yet named a permanent replacement for Wallace as host of “Fox News Sunday.” A number of Fox journalists will rotate in the position until a permanent host is named, the network said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Photographer Amy Harris is fighting a subpoena issued by the Jan. 6 select committee that would compel her phone carrier, Verizon, to turn over her phone records from the weeks surrounding the riot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s not clear why the committee wants Harris’s phone records. But her attorneys called the demand “invasive” and “sweeping” in a lawsuit filed in federal court late Wednesday afternoon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some of Harris’s photos of the ensuing violence were published in The Post, the Guardian and the Cincinnati Enquirer.</p></div></div>
<p>The lawsuit argues that Harris's phone records could reveal who she had spoken to in the course of her reporting and thus violates her right under the First Amendment and other laws that protect journalists from revealing confidential sources.</p>
<div><p><span>Fox News hosts urged Meadows to have Trump stop Jan. 6 violence, texts show</span></p></div>

<a>This CEO Is Out for Blood</a>,” the headline read.
<div><div><p>Emblematic of the gushy, overly credulous business and tech journalism ascendant at the time, Fortune’s story touched off a media stampede that transformed Holmes, then 30, into a business superstar.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now the same article might help send her to prison.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Holmes is on federal trial in San Jose for <a>11 counts of fraud</a> after Theranos effectively shut down in 2018. A jury is expected to begin deliberations as soon as Friday; if convicted, she faces up to 20 years in prison.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Elizabeth Holmes trial is the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley</p></div>
<b><b/></b>The Fortune article has been a key part of the state’s case against Holmes, as has testimony and interview recordings supplied by Roger Parloff, the story’s author. Parloff has maintained for years that Theranos
<b> </b>Holmes also told Parloff about partnerships Theranos had allegedly developed with major pharmaceutical companies and the U.S. military.
<div><div><p>“It sounds incredible,” Parloff told Holmes after she described Theranos’s compact blood-testing computers, in a recorded interview played back at the trial.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is one of those special things,” Holmes replied.</p></div></div>
<a>USA Today</a>, among others, profiled her. NPR, Fox Business, CNN, CNBC and CBS News put her on the air. Glamour magazine named Holmes one of its
<a>a flattering story </a>on Holmes, too).
<a>“The Next Steve Jobs.”</a>
<div><p>Perspective: Elizabeth Holmes used every trope in the book</p></div>
<a>John Cook</a>, a former executive editor of Gawker Media. (A scrappy constellation of blogs, Gawker went out of business in 2016 as a result of
<a>a lawsuit </a>funded by Peter Thiel, a tech billionaire who had objected to its coverage).
<a>essay </a>published by Fortune in 2015: “How Theranos Misled Me.” He left Fortune the next year and is now a senior editor at
<a> Lawfare,</a> a blog about national security issues.
<div><div><p>Others, however, have no such regrets.</p></div></div>
<a>a 6,000-word story </a>in December 2014 that was nearly as laudatory as Parloff’s, though with a few caveats noting the company’s secrecy and a paucity of evidence for its claims.
<div><div><p>A New Yorker spokesperson stood by that story last week, calling it “appropriately skeptical.”</p></div></div>
<a>spiraling losses </a>were revealed in 2019 and the company became the
<a>subject of a criminal investigation</a>.
<div><div><p>In any event, the adoration of Holmes and Theranos came to an abrupt end more than a year after Fortune published its article, when Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou began looking into the company.</p></div></div>
<a>front-page story </a>in 2015 and subsequent reporting turned up irregularities and questionable practices at the company. It led in 2018 to his best selling book, “
<a>Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</a>.” Apple
<a> announced last week </a>that it will produce a movie based on the book, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes.
<p>Carreyrou’s stories eventually contributed to Theranos’ insolvency and helped set in motion the trial now concluding in Silicon Valley. They suggest their own lesson: the best way to drive out bad journalism is with a better kind.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paul Farhi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 24, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>With a fierce new variant of the coronavirus on the loose, White House reporters are urging press secretary Jen Psaki to move her daily briefings online — but it’s an idea Psaki has been cool to so far.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The White House Correspondents’ Association has proposed holding the daily briefings on Zoom or some other online platform to avoid face-to-face contact in the White House’s cramped briefing room.</p></div></div>
<a>in a speech earlier in the day</a> that omicron cases are likely to be widespread in many workplaces, including at the White House.
<p>Portnoy urged reporters “not directly tasked by their managers with being at the White House to please not come in.” He also wrote that his organization had suggested Zoom to Psaki, but “no changes are expected at this time.”</p>
<div><div><p>Thursday’s in-person briefing at the White House was sparsely attended, possibly reflecting both the approach of the Christmas holiday and Portnoy’s memo urging reporters to avoid the briefing room.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Psaki greeted reporters by quipping that “only the bold and the brave” were covering the briefing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From March 2020: A ‘strange and eerie time’ for White House reporters — and a risky one, too</p></div>
<div><div><p>Last year, before the widespread availability of coronavirus vaccines, the organization established a rotation among news organizations, limiting briefings to just 14 reporters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Psaki appeared to favor this approach, saying, “we are open to considering a request to go back to the smaller-sized briefings.”</p></div></div>
<p>But such limits are voluntary and impossible to enforce. President Donald Trump ignored the 14-person limit last year and <a>invited writers from outlets that were loyal to him</a>, such as One America News, the Epoch Times and Gateway Pundit.</p>
<a>came back negative</a>, the White House said on Wednesday.
<div><div><p>“We are committed to doing everything we can to keep the press corps, our staff and of course the president safe while also ensuring the media has access to the briefing room,” Psaki said in her statement.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paul Farhi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 27, 2021 at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Rieger reported the grim news. Then, just before signing off, she lost it, breaking into sobs on live television.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The first words she’d say were, “Forgive me. . . ”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was never easy. Sometimes, knocking on that door, she would say to herself, “Please don’t let me in, please don’t let me in. . .”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nearly every time, they let her in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Once, she knocked on the door of a family whose son was missing. The teenager had been involved with a gang. The father talked at length about his boy, his dreams for his future, his hope for his safe return.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Afterward, Rieger and her cameraman drove around the corner. Both cried. They knew the boy probably wouldn’t be coming home. He didn’t.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Telling this story, Rieger thinks again about this father and son. She starts to choke up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rieger and her former co-anchor, Susan Kidd, used to have a rule: No eye contact with each other while reporting the more heartbreaking stories. They knew one or the other, or both, might crack.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think you have to be open and transparent,” Rieger says. “It’s vital to let them see what you feel. Let them see you. You have to be honest.”</p></div></div>
<p>“Too many TV anchors work too hard at trying to act authoritative, or real, or empathetic no matter the story,” said Sherwood, also now retired. “With Wendy, you got the feeling that she just sat down and talked to you.”</p>
<p>She fell into news by happenstance, trying to make a few extra dollars, after a theater friend who worked in local radio told her the station needed a news reader. Rieger got the job and started doing newscasts on weekends. She was hooked.</p>
<div><div><p>“I always thought if he ever becomes free, I’m going to pounce on him like a sumo wrestler,” Rieger said. “I was not raised to be reserved.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They began a relationship after he filed for divorce last year. Last month, they were married.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then, in early May, she started seeing strange things: a map materializing in her bedroom, starbursts emanating from friends’ heads, a sentence floating across the side of a mountain in the Blue Ridge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rieger was startled and amazed by these hallucinations, but an MRI revealed something deadly serious: a golf-ball-size mass on a lobe of her brain. A renowned surgeon, Pascal Zinn, operated five days later.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In retrospect, she says the operation to repair her heart was like “a trip through a McDonald’s drive-through” compared with brain surgery.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nevertheless, she was back on the air six weeks after the cancerous mass was removed. Zinn told her he got “99.9 percent” of it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then they cued up Vance’s taped tribute to her. “Okay, you guys just destroyed me,” Rieger said. “To see our beautiful Vance, who we miss so much. . .”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And then she did what came naturally. Wendy Rieger cried tears of memory, gratitude and joy.</p></div></div>

<p>NPR has decided it won’t “Tell Me More” much longer.</p>
<p>The broadcaster has canceled its daily news-discussion program “Tell Me More,” the latest in a series of the NPR’s failed efforts to produce programs aimed at minority audiences.</p>
<p>Washington-based NPR said Tuesday that the cancellation was a financial decision, triggered by the need to close a persistent budget gap.</p>
<p>After seven years on the air, the program was carried by just 136 of the more than 800 noncommercial stations affiliated with NPR.</p>
<p>NPR will save about $4.4 million with the cuts announced Tuesday and the recent buyouts, reducing the newsroom staff by about 9 percent, said Kinsey Wilson, its executive vice president.</p>
<p>The president of the National Association of Black Journalists, which advocates greater newsroom diversity, said NPR didn’t put enough effort behind promoting the program.</p>

<div><p>At the same time, ratings have taken a hit, with stay-at-home orders keeping many devoted listeners out of their cars, and thus away from their radios, raising concerns about the effect on public donations to hundreds of member stations.</p></div>

<div><h1>A whistleblower’s power: Key takeaways from the Facebook Papers</h1><h2>Interviews with dozens of current and former employees and a trove of internal documents show how the social media company inflamed real-world harms </h2></div>

<b> </b>college student in northern India.
<div><div><p>Here are key takeaways from The Post’s investigation:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Zuckerberg’s public claims often conflict with internal research</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The documents also show that Zuckerberg’s public statements are often at odds with internal company findings.</p></div></div>
<p>Facebook spokeswoman Dani Lever denied that Zuckerberg “makes decisions that cause harm” and dismissed the findings, saying they are “based on selected documents that are mischaracterized and devoid of any context.”</p>
<div><p>The case against Mark Zuckerberg: How Facebook’s CEO chose growth and free speech over safety</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Facebook dropped its guard before the Jan. 6 insurrection</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>By the time Facebook tried to reimpose its “break the glass” measures, it was too late: A pro-Trump mob was storming the U.S. Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook officials said they planned exhaustively for the election and its aftermath, anticipated the potential for post-election violence, and always expected the challenges to last through the inauguration of President Biden on Jan. 20.</p></div>
<div><p>Inside Facebook, Jan. 6 violence fueled anger, regret over missed warning signs</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Facebook fails to effectively police content in much of the world</div></h3></div></div>
<a>meticulously studied</a> its approach abroad, and is well aware that weaker moderation in non-English-speaking countries leaves the platform vulnerable to abuse by bad actors and authoritarian regimes.
<div><div><p>Facebook’s Lever said the company has made “progress,” with “global teams with native speakers reviewing content in over 70 languages along with experts in humanitarian and human rights issues.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>How Facebook neglected the rest of the world, fueling hate speech and violence in India</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Facebook chooses maximum engagement over user safety</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Zuckerberg has said the company does not design its products to persuade people to spend more time on them. But dozens of documents suggest the opposite.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Facebook took years to implement a simple fix for anger and misinformation</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The company’s data scientists eventually confirmed that “angry” reaction, along with “wow” and “haha,” occurred more frequently on “toxic” content and misinformation.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Five points for anger, one for a ‘like’: How Facebook’s formula fostered rage and misinformation</p></div>

<h3>Read the series: Facebook under fire</h3>
<p>The trove of documents show how <a><b>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg</b></a> has, at times, contradicted, downplayed or failed to disclose company findings on the impact of its products and platforms.</p>
<a><b>at least 650,000 posts attacking the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s victory</b></a> between Election Day and Jan. 6.
<p>Facebook engineers gave <a><b>extra value to emoji reactions, including ‘angry,’</b></a> pushing more emotional and provocative content into users’ news feeds.</p>

<div><div><p>But now the public-radio giant is contending with an exodus of the very same talent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some see a pattern — and a problem. Cornish’s announcement, in particular, unleashed a public airing of grievances from within NPR about its treatment of minority journalists.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Garcia-Navarro tweeted, “I’m sad to see this happening but it is not unexpected.” She and Sanders declined to elaborate, as did Cornish.</p></div></div>
<div><p>NPR may be ‘public’ radio, but it’s feeling the economic pain of the pandemic. More trouble lies ahead.</p></div>

<a>Leila Fadel</a>. Martinez was appointed in May, and Tong was named in June. Fadel, a former Washington Post reporter, was named last week.
<div><div><p>But Garcia-Navarro pointedly disputed this in her tweet. “People leave jobs for other opportunities if they are unhappy with the opportunities they have and the way they have been treated,” she wrote.</p></div></div>
<a>programs aimed at minority audiences</a>, such as “News and Notes,” and “Tell Me More,” the latter hosted by Michel Martin, who went on to become the weekend host of “All Things Considered.”
<a>data compiled by ratings firm Nielsen for NPR and shared last year with The Post</a>. NPR has grown its podcasting arm in recent years, which executives have said helps fulfill the organization’s goal to reach younger, more diverse audiences.
<div><div><p>But people familiar with NPR say its management hasn’t done enough to provide opportunities to minority journalists, especially women.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Public-media executives often assume she’s paying significantly more to hire away their employees. She says that’s not the case.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why your favorite new NPR show might sound a lot like a podcast</p></div>
<div><div><p>She said she regularly hears from public-radio staffers of color who say they deal with daily slights and resistance to their ideas, despite a sense they got their jobs to help expand the audience.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lara declined to characterize the issue as a crisis or problem but acknowledged that it was “important” to maintain a diverse workplace.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>NPR’s internal statistics</a> show that its workforce is 62 percent White, 15 percent Black/African American, 12 percent Asian American and 7 percent Latino or Hispanic.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Joseph Brown dreads every single execution he has to witness.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Oklahoma death row inmate convulsed, vomited during lethal injection, witness says, as state resumes executions</p></div>
<div><p>From 2019: Most states have the death penalty. Few actually carry out executions.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The pandemic has also made things somewhat complicated for journalists covering executions; Alabama this month said <a>it would only allow one media witness, citing covid-19 concerns</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>has witnessed more than 400 executions in Texas</a>.
<div><div><p>Because of that record, Graczyk has become a national expert on executions; he told the AP’s Murphy that he could only remember one other time that someone vomited while being executed.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At one Texas execution, there were no media witnesses; the state forgot to escort Graczyk and Brown into the chambers to see 41-year-old Quintin Jones’s death by lethal injection in May, <a>blaming a miscommunication error</a>.</p></div>
<div><div><p>It was something that “never should have happened,” Brown said, noting that policies have been changed to make sure they aren’t forgotten again.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“An execution is the greatest punishment that the justice system can levy,” Brown said. It shouldn’t simply be that “people go into a black box and die,” he said.</p></div></div>
