<h1> What Can Make Children Shy </h1>
<h2> What research tells us about the biology (and parenting) of shy kids. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Shyness? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Certain elements of temperament, including shyness, can be detected as early as 4 months of age, suggesting it's largely inborn.</li>
<li>But just because temperament has a biological basis doesn't mean it's set in stone.</li>
<li>Supportive parents can help shy children thrive—not by forcing them to be outgoing, but by helping them manage anxiety surrounding socializing.</li>
<a>social anxiety</a> when I’m around new people or when I’m in large professional settings, like academic conferences, where meeting new people is the whole point.
<p>What makes a person shy or outgoing? Is shyness something that we’re born with, or is it something we develop based on our experiences with other people?</p>

<a>childhood</a>, and babies’ responses to the mobile at 4 months of age predict how shy or social they will be into
<p>Does this mean that the environment plays no role in producing shyness? And is shyness anything to be concerned about in the first place?</p>

<a>attention</a> when they break the rules since they don’t easily feel anxious on their own (Kochanska, 1997).

<h1> 4 Steps to Cultivate the Habit of Saving Money </h1>
<h2> Research in setting goals, saving every day, and making saved money visible. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: After fifty years by Lotte Meijer Unsplash Licensed Under CC BY 2.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>saving at least 15% of your income consistently</a> for several decades (depending on how long you expect to live). In the Bankrate survey, only 16% of participants reported saving more than 15%.
<a>saving money is difficult</a>, while
<a>spending in an undisciplined way</a> is gratifying. Many people set lofty goals to save money, say for a wedding or a down-payment on a house,
<a>fail to reach them</a>, then feel dispirited and give up. Saving money regularly by
<a>making it part of your lifestyle</a> is far more effective.
<p>This is easier said than done. If you already have a saving-oriented lifestyle, that’s great. But for the majority who don’t save habitually, how are they supposed to cultivate the habit of saving money?</p>
<p>In this blog post, I want to suggest a four-step approach to cultivate the habit of saving money eventually adopting a saving lifestyle.</p>
<h3>1. Start with a specific saving goal of building an emergency fund.</h3>
<a>crucial early step in habit formation</a>. People can only form new habits when they have adopted particular behavior patterns. To begin, there must be some underlying
<a>motivation</a> to behave. Remember how you learned to drive a car. In the beginning, you had a focused goal of passing the driving test which drove you to learn driving.
<h3>2. Save something every single day, even if it is just a dollar or two.</h3>
<a>excellent review chapter</a> about research on the Psychology of Habit:
<a>habit formation</a>. With each repetition, small changes occur in the cognitive and
<a>neural</a> mechanisms associated with procedural
<a>memory</a>. Through Hebbian learning of repeated connections, cognitive associations between context cues and a response are strengthened gradually so that people are prepared to repeat performance when the context cues are encountered again.”
<p>This tip goes against the advice of many experts to automate savings, but the truth is if you want to form a saving habit, you have to take your financial decisions into your own hands.</p>
<h3>3. Make your savings visible.</h3>
<p>While the first two tips are about the process of forming a saving habit, the next two tips are about supporting the newly-forming habit.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: 100 dollars by Pepi Stojanovski Unsplash Licensed Under CC BY 2.0</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>resilient</a> habit is to make both habitual actions and resulting rewards visible and tangible. When a
<a>teenager</a> is learning to drive, the autonomy, the flexibility and the improvement in lifestyle are
<a>top of mind</a> and encourage persistence. Similarly, saving visibly and seeing savings accumulate, whether it is in a glass jar or in an online savings account every day
<a>supports habit formation</a>. Visible signs of progress provide
<a>positive feedback</a> and encourage the individual to continue.
<h3>4. Regardless of your income, consistently spend less than you make.</h3>
<a>attention</a> to your spending, and enact ways to curb it and bring it in line with your income, is critical.
<a>Research has shown</a> that people with a strong saving habit are frugal and find spending money to be painful. Cultivating a saving mindset and habit requires abandoning a spending mindset.
<p>There you have it. These are the four steps to cultivate a saving habit: Set an emergency fund goal, save money every day, do so in a visible and tangible way, and monitor spending to bring it below the level of your income. </p>

<p>Before your head hits the pillow, you make a mental note to exercise tomorrow morning. The next thing you know your alarm is going off. You hit snooze. Twice.</p>
<p>It’s too late to exercise now; you tell yourself you will do it after work. But when work ends, you’re tired and you want to watch your favorite show instead.</p>
<p>You are likely aware of the fact that good intentions do not always lead to action. Perhaps you lack <a>motivation</a>?</p>
<p>In my last post of this series, I discussed what to do if <a>capability </a>is an issue. In this part we focus on motivation with three techniques: widening the options, the behavioral contract, and temptation bundling.</p>
<p>Change can seem unappealing if you go to black-and-white <a>decision-making</a>. Stop thinking in terms of only having two options and think of the plethora of choices you have at hand.</p>
<p>If you think the path to fitness means buying a fancy piece of home exercise equipment, joining a gym, or joining boot camp-style classes, you need to <a>widen your view </a>on the available options.</p>
<p>If you want to stop doing something, or start doing something, find a cause to donate to. Make the behavior crystal clear:</p>
<p>· I will work out three times this week</p>
<p>· I will walk 8,000 steps every day</p>
<p>· I will lift weights twice per week</p>
<p>Put down a monetary amount that you are comfortable with but not happy about losing. Find a friend to check in daily or weekly. If you break your contract, you need to ante up.</p>

<h1> Permanent Weight Loss Motivation: What It Takes </h1>
<h2> Research reveals how some people manage to step off the diet treadmill for good! </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Motivation? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Your doctor warns your weight could become a serious health concern. Your partner insists you join a gym or start a weight loss program together. You make a deal with yourself to eat healthier so you can impress your friends and family.</p>
<p>The Two Types of Weight Loss Motivation</p>
<p>There are two major categories of weight loss motivation which produce radically different results: intrinsic vs. extrinsic, or motivation from within vs. motivation from outside yourself. </p>
<p>Below I summarize the research on extrinsic vs. intrinsic motivation to better arm you for inevitable rough spots and begin to give you a glimpse of how you can power through.</p>
<a>dieting</a> or fasting are extrinsically motivated. So are most "diet betting" programs and those which involve accountability to others, etc.
<p>There are two subtypes of extrinsic motivation: <a>Guilt</a> Avoidance and People Pleasing. </p>
<p>Guilt avoidance is an effort to avoid feeling humiliated that you don’t look like others and/or how society as a whole thinks you should (Durayappah-Harrison, 2015). </p>
<p>People pleasing, on the other hand, is derived more from the desire to win approval. </p>
<p>Two examples from my own life serve to illustrate.</p>
<a>body image</a>” (Teixeira, 2006), all of which, in turn, support long-term weight maintenance.
<a>self-esteem</a>, as well as a higher likelihood of unhealthy coping behavior. (Georgiadis, Biddle Stayrou, 2006).
<p>Shifting from Extrinsic to Intrinsic Motivation with Time</p>
<p>Ultimately, your goal is to move from “should” to “want to!” (Silva, 2010).</p>
<p>Also, as you move along your journey try to stop asking “how much weight can I lose.” Instead, try to ask “what kind of person will I become and why will that make me proud?”</p>
<a>free will</a> (autonomy), not merely to comply with goals imposed by others and/or society as a whole.

<h1> 12 Ways to Beat Procrastination </h1>
<h2> Strategies that really work, especially if your issue is "cyberslacking." </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Procrastination? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Diego Cervo/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Procrastination</a> can lead to
<li>When I work, even after I make a decision, I delay acting upon it.</li>
<li>I delay before starting on work I have to do.</li>
<li>At work, I crave a pleasurable diversion so sharply that I find it incredibly hard to stay on track.</li>
<li>When a work task is tedious, again and again I find myself pleasantly daydreaming rather than focusing.</li>
<li>I give priority to lesser tasks, even if there is something important I should do at work.</li>
<li>When I have an excessive amount of work to do, I avoid planning my tasks, and find myself doing something totally irrelevant.</li>
<li>I take long coffee breaks.</li>
<li>I delay some of my tasks just because I just do not enjoy doing them.</li>
<li>I text (or use Facebook messenger, etc.) at work.</li>
<li>I spend more than a half hour on <a>social network</a> sites at work per day.</li>
<li>I read news online at work.</li>
<li>I do online shopping during working hours.</li>
<p>In the Dutch study, the one key factor predicting procrastination was <a>boredom</a>. Work that was under-stimulating and didn’t provide enough mental engagement was most likely to create conditions ripe for procrastination. </p>
<p>With this in mind, here are the 12 items on the PAWS turned into practical steps for implementing change:</p>
<li>If you delay in making decisions, give yourself timelines. Then ease yourself into them so that you don’t set unrealistic targets, but set achievable ones that help you perform more efficiently.</li>
<li>The delays you may make before starting your work or chores can have value—if they ease you into the proper mindset. However, as with the previous item, set limits on how long you give yourself to prepare before launching into the task.</li>
<li>Prioritizing is one of the best ways to avoid procrastination, but if you’ve got your priorities reversed, reward yourself for completing important (but difficult) tasks when you get them done on time.</li>
<li>Don’t let the thought that a task is too insurmountable keep you from ever starting it. When you have a lot of work to do, break it down into manageable chunks.</li>
<li><a>Cutting</a> down on breaks is easy if you have something to look forward to afterward. That break can be your reward instead of the distraction that prevents you from ever getting started. </li>
<li>Mundane tasks, at home or at work, can’t be avoided entirely, but the more quickly you complete them, the more quickly you can get back to doing what you truly like.</li>
<li>Texting people when you’ve got something else you need to do is an activity that you need to limit. Save your texting for after you’ve finished what you need to do, or at least after you’ve finished a part of it.</li>
<li>It’s easy to fall into the trap of reading the news online, and losing track of time. Reserve a certain part of your day for keeping up with the news and stick to it. You can also read the news while you’re having a coffee break.</li>

<h1> Don’t Feel Motivated? Play The Impossible Game </h1>
<h2> Learn to take action even without motivation. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>The Acceptance Game</div> <div>Source: CC/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Difficult thoughts and feelings often prevent us from doing what we actually care about. And when this inner resistance threatens to take over, you may want to play the Impossible Game.</p>
<p>The moment you notice an inner resistance to taking a useful action, the game begins.</p>
<p>You can then decide to give in to your resistance, and remain in your comfort zone. Or, you can choose to challenge yourself and do the seemingly impossible.</p>
<p>This means you allow yourself to feel the discomfort, hear your negative self-talk, and take action anyway. You do exactly what your mind says you cannot do, thus doing the “impossible.”</p>
<p>What This Looks Like in Practice:</p>
<ul><li>You wake up early in the morning, feel drowsy, and just want to hit the “Snooze” button and go back to sleep. But instead, you play the Impossible Game and challenge yourself to get out of bed as fast as possible.</li> </ul>
<ul><li>You enjoy a hot shower, and already dread the moment you have to get out. So you play the Impossible Game, and challenge yourself to turn the shower all the way to cold.</li> </ul>
<ul><li>You are about to get lunch, and crave the chocolate chip muffin you have been eyeing ever since you entered the café. Instead of buying it, however, you challenge yourself to order an apple.</li> </ul>
<ul><li>You come home after a long day at work, and just want to unwind on your couch while watching Netflix. Instead, however, you challenge yourself to reading five pages from the book on your nightstand.</li> </ul>
<p>The opportunities to play are endless, and it starts the moment you notice an inner resistance to useful action.</p>
<p>By playing the Impossible Game, you exercise your acceptance muscles and you create healthy variation. You practice your skill to make room for difficult thoughts and feelings, while learning to take action anyway.</p>
<p>Doing this bumps life out of the rut, out of well-grooved habits of resistance. And there you are one tiny step closer to being able to do what you want.</p>
<p>Think of it as training a broadly useful skill. Anything worth doing comes along with inner resistance—whether we talk about working, exercising, or caring for your relationships.</p>
<p>By doing new things—doing the impossible—you learn to overcome the limitations of your own mind, and you increase the odds of acting more in line with your <a>goals</a> and values in the future.</p>
<p>Evolving depends on variation and selecting what works, and what could be more unexpected than doing the impossible?</p>
<h2>A Quick Word of Caution!</h2>
<p>The more you play the game, the more you might feel empowered. While this is a great bonus, it’s not the intended outcome. Keep your eye on doing the impossible, not anything that might or might not follow.</p>
<p>We don’t play to feel better, but to learn to take action with difficult thoughts and feelings, if they are there.</p>
<p>Like all good games, this game is best played playfully. Games are supposed to be fun! Don’t let that Dictator Within turn it into something SERIOUS even if it might be useful. It’s not a drudge. It’s just a silly challenge.</p>
<p>Keep your participation voluntary. Only you get to decide whether you want to play or not.</p>
<p>The Impossible Game is a daily challenge and a frequent reminder that you can go beyond your self-set boundaries whenever you make the choice.</p>
<p>Hold it lightly. Pursue it passionately. Why not?</p>

<p>If your 2020 resolutions are long abandoned, you’re not alone. People are quick to set ambitious goals but often fail to follow through.</p>
<p>In her new book, Clearer, Closer, Better, New York University psychologist Emily Balcetis offers tips for harnessing the quirks of perception to make it easier to finish what you started.</p>
<p>PT spoke with her about some of the strategies outlined in the book.</p>
<p>What do we get wrong about setting goals?</p>
<a>motivation</a> to meet them. Find the sweet spot where it’s moderately challenging and inspiring, but not impossible to achieve.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: (c) Yulia Nar</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>What should we focus on to help sustain motivation?</p>
<a>self-concept</a>, looking back at past successes is more motivating. It signals that this is a goal you can finish. If the goal is core to who you are, looking forward at the work to come may be more motivating and inspiring.
<p>What other strategies can help us keep on track?</p>
<p>You apply that concept to an interesting example in your book. How can materializing influence voter turnout?</p>
<p>How can we avoid temptations that might derail our progress?</p>

<h1> How to Generate Momentum </h1>
<h2> When motivation alone doesn't bring desired change. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: freestockphotos</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Momentum is the impetus gained by a moving object. It is not only an aspect of physics, it is also a feature of human experience that is often overlooked, underrecognized, and as a result, underutilized.</p>
<a>motivation</a> as the exclusive means to change.
<p>Motivation is the why of change. Momentum is the how.</p>
<a>Depression</a> may encourage us to steer clear of conflict or avoid facing difficult issues by telling us that we “can’t handle” the negative emotions we experience when we think, speak, or act on our own behalf. In
<p>Human beings are in constant flux. Who we are and what we do will always be dependent on our moment-to-moment choices. In other words: we are free.</p>

<p>The next time you are feeling stuck remember that your desire to get unstuck is part of a momentum already present in your life. That momentum, if harnessed, can fuel powerful change. The following are some ways to harness that power: </p>
<p>Generating momentum toward desired change:</p>
<li>Recognize and amplify your motivations for change. Know why you want to develop this new habit or to curb an old habit. Remain open to the growth or transformation of your motivation over time.</li>
<li>Identify the dynamics in your life that support the problem and then identify the dynamics that support the change you prefer.</li>
<li>Focus on growing those dynamics that undermine the problem even if they seem unrelated (Example: I might focus on preparing healthier meals for myself in my effort to reduce my tendency to avoid having difficult conversations at work).</li>
<li>Tell the story of your adventure as it unfolds. Make this effort significant by accentuating it in your inner monologues and in social interactions where appropriate.</li>

<h1> 4 Psychological Tricks to Reach Your Goals </h1>
<h2> These four hacks that will help you reach your goals instead of abandoning them. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Motivation? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Motivation</a> is a tricky thing. But just because you’ve struggled in the past doesn’t mean you can't find success in the future. Motivation is like an engine you can tune. As long as you tinker with it the right way, it'll perform better.
<p>Let’s look at four psychological tricks for puttering with your particular motivation engine as you set your goals for 2020.</p>
<p>1. Set a learning goal instead of a performance goal.</p>
<p>Usually, when we set goals, we think of what we want to achieve, what thresholds we want to be able to say we crossed.</p>
<ul><li>Lose 20 pounds</li> <li>Run a marathon</li> <li>Get a promotion at work</li> </ul>
<p>These goals are specific and concrete. That’s good, but research shows that setting long-term performance goals based on achievement outcomes may not be as effective as <a>setting goals for new skills you want to learn</a>.</p>
<a>felt more satisfied</a> by the end of their program and earned higher GPAs compared to their peers who set achievement-based goals like earning good grades.
<a>improving your nutrition knowledge</a> by learning five new healthy lunch recipes. Not only does this offer a more specific target, it feels a lot more attainable.
<p>2. Make sure the goal is attached to a life value.</p>

<p>3. Make the goal about a challenge, not a threat.</p>
<p>If your goal is based on intimidation, you’re less likely to achieve it than if it's <a>based on a challenge</a>. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>Threat: If I don’t decrease my blood pressure, I’ll likely have a heart attack.</p>
<p>Challenge: I want to decrease my blood pressure so I can improve my quality of life.</p>
<p>Threat: I need to step up with my studying because I’ll fail the semester if I don’t.</p>
<p>Challenge: I need to create a new study routine for myself so I can become the type of student I want to be.</p>
<p>Threat: I have to figure out how not to push my new boss’s buttons so I don’t continue to have a rocky relationship with her.</p>

<p>Challenge: I want to reset my relationship with my new boss by learning new communication skills.</p>
<p>4. Sign a contract with someone.</p>
<p>Who have you told about your goals? How much detail did you share?</p>
<a>high success rate</a>. The contract works on each person for different reasons. Maybe it served as a
<a>memory</a>-jogger, provided more social support, or helped them to problem-solve. The key takeaway is that singing the contract helped.
<p>So, go ahead and look forward to a 2020 challenge, but be sure to base it around your values for a higher chance of success. </p>

<p>He responded plainly: “They're not important anymore. So, I don't display them.”</p>
<p>Many people think they know what <a>extrinsic motivation</a> really is.</p>
<p>They think it’s bonuses.</p>
<p>They think it’s recognition.</p>
<p>They think it’s award trips.</p>
<p>They think of all those trophies that end up in a duffle bag.</p>
<p>Hopefully, they pay you.</p>
<p>But you would do it even if they didn’t pay you to do the work because you enjoy doing it so much. You are intrinsically motivated to do it.</p>
<p>How to Leverage Extrinsic Motivation</p>
<p>In fact, most do not. And largely for one of three reasons.</p>
<ul><li>Expectancy</li> <li>Instrumentality</li> <li>Valence</li> </ul>
<p>Those terms are a little academic, and fairly outdated, so let’s translate a bit.</p>
