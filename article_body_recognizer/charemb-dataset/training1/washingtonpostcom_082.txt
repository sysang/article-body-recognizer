<div><p>The day before the first anniversary of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, a Democratic super PAC is launching a six-figure ad buy that ties Republican allies of former president Donald Trump to the deadly events of that day.</p></div>
<div><p>Priorities USA Action on Wednesday announced the release of two short digital ads, to run in battleground states with the intention of targeting “voters who are consuming less political news since Donald Trump left office.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>One ad, “<a>Coup</a>,” opens with footage of Trump casting doubt on the integrity of the 2020 election and saying Republicans were needed to “take care of the election frauds.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The 30-second ad also briefly highlights some of the Republican House and Senate candidates Trump has endorsed for 2022 midterm elections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Donald Trump is putting people in place now to dictate the outcome of the next presidential election in Congress and in states all around the country,” the narrator adds.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Every single chaotic, disastrous day of the Donald Trump presidency reminds us that your vote to defeat him was absolutely right,” a narrator states in this ad. “The only way to stop Trump is with your vote.”</p></div>
<p>The ads use slightly different approaches, but both seek to cast the midterm elections as a referendum on Trump — and on those the former president supports — even though he will have been out of office for nearly two years by then.</p>
<a>recent report by the Democratic think tank Third Way and ALG Research</a> warned that Democrats should take heed in the midterms.
<div><div><p>“We have an obligation to prevent those who enabled this tragedy from holding power ever again,” Aneesa McMillan, the deputy executive director of Priorities USA, said in a statement.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob is seeking information from Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), one of former president Donald Trump’s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jordan has previously said that he cannot recall how many times he spoke with Trump on Jan. 6 but that they spoke at least once.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Also on Wednesday, a federal judge denied a motion by Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, for a temporary restraining order against the select committee over subpoenas it has issued against him.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>He asked Jordan to meet with the panel on Jan. 3 or 4, 2022.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The American people deserve a full and accurate accounting of what happened on January 6th,” Thompson <a>wrote</a>. “We aim to make informed legislative recommendations taking account of all relevant facts.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>A spokesman for Jordan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<a>contacted Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) for information</a> about his communications with Trump White House officials.
<div><div><p>Perry on Tuesday rebuffed the committee’s request for communications and voluntary testimony, declaring in a statement that he “will continue to fight the failures of the radical Left.”</p></div></div>
<p>“I stand with immense respect for our Constitution, the Rule of Law, and the Americans I represent who know that this entity is illegitimate, and not duly constituted under the rules of the U.S. House of Representatives,” Perry said.</p>
<div><div><p><b/>In the months since the Capitol attack, Jordan has given conflicting answers about his communications with Trump that day.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In July, Jordan said he was not certain exactly when on Jan. 6 he spoke with Trump. Then, in an August interview with Politico, Jordan confirmed for the first time that he spoke with Trump “more than once” on Jan. 6.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Earlier this month, Jordan declined to say whether he participated in a Jan. 5 briefing with Phil Waldron, a retired U.S. Army colonel who was working with Trump’s outside lawyers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During that briefing, Waldron shared a 38-page PowerPoint presentation that outlined proposals to challenge the 2020 election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The panel’s efforts to investigate the Jan. 6 attack received a boost Wednesday when a federal judge denied a motion by Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, for a temporary restraining order.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>President Biden on Thursday signed into law the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a bipartisan bill that bans imports from China’s Xinjiang region unless the importer can prove they were not made with forced labor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday that U.S. companies “should never feel the need to apologize for standing up for fundamental human rights or opposing repression.”</p></div></div>
<a>legislation</a> applies to “all goods, wares, articles, and merchandise mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part” in Xinjiang, a sprawling region in China’s far west where, beginning in 2017, the Chinese government
<a>has carried out a mass “reeducation” campaign</a> against Uyghurs and members of other ethnic groups.
<a>a move earlier this year</a> by the Trump administration to issue a sweeping ban on imports of cotton or tomato products from Xinjiang — although enforcement of those sanctions is proving challenging.
<div><div><p>Scholars estimate that more than 1 million people in Xinjiang were detained in camps, with some released, some transferred to prison and others pressured to work in factories.</p></div></div>
<div><p>China has repeatedly denied that any forced labor has taken place in Xinjiang, although it acknowledges “vocational training programs” for residents whom officials considered susceptible to separatism or religious extremism.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Reasons for detention <a>could include such supposed infractions</a> as wearing a headscarf or a long beard, having more than two children or traveling overseas for vacation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement Thursday, Pelosi said that with the legislation’s enactment, Biden and Congress “have taken a strong step to combat the exploitation of forced labor in Xinjiang.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rubio called the legislation “the most important and impactful action taken thus far by the United States to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for their use of slave labor.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>By his own accounts, Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.) has escaped death twice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On a winter morning in December 1969, Rush said police shot down his door, the day after officers fatally shot Fred Hampton, a fellow Black Panther activist, in Chicago.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) predicted Republicans would move to impeach President Biden “whether it’s justified or not” if they retake the House in this year’s midterm elections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The White House responded Tuesday by calling on Cruz to work with Democrats toward bipartisan agreement on policy matters instead of “name-calling” and making political predictions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cruz’s comments, which he made during a podcast appearance late last month, underscore the extent to which <a>rising partisan hostility</a> has paralyzed Washington.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During the “Verdict With Ted Cruz” <a>episode</a>, the senator was asked whether he thinks there is any chance a Republican House would impeach Biden, given that Democrats had twice impeached President Donald Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cruz added, “That’s not how impeachment is meant to work, but I think the Democrats crossed that line.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think there’ll be enormous pressure on a Republican House to begin impeachment proceedings,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump last year became <a>the only American president to have been impeached twice</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>first impeached him</a> in December 2019 on charges that he abused his office and obstructed Congress in relation to his attempts to withhold military aid to Ukraine and pressure its government to investigate Biden. Trump
<a>was impeached again</a> last January on the charge of incitement of insurrection, after his false claims of a stolen election led a crowd of his supporters to violently storm the Capitol.
<div><div><p>Both times, Trump was acquitted by the Senate. No House Republicans voted for Trump’s first impeachment, while 10 joined with Democrats for the second.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the podcast interview, Cruz argued that there are “potentially multiple grounds to consider” for impeaching Biden, including “the utter lawlessness” of his “refusal to enforce the border.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Asked Tuesday about Cruz’s remarks, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the senator should work with the White House and congressional Democrats on immigration reform rather than making accusations.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) announced Tuesday that she will not run for reelection, in the 25th retirement by a House Democrat as the party faces tough odds in the midterm elections.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“You made me your congresswoman,” she said. “It has been a tremendous honor and privilege to be your voice in Congress and to fight for our communities and issues in Washington, D.C., on a national platform.”</p></div>
<div><p>How redistricting is shaping the 2022 U.S. House map</p></div>
<p>Late last month, Michigan’s independent redistricting commission approved new maps that will define the state’s congressional districts for the next 10 years. The state will have <a>13 districts</a>, one less than it currently has.</p>
<div><div><p>In her video announcing her retirement, Lawrence alluded to the battle over the state’s new districts, emphasized the importance of representation, and urged voters to continue supporting Black candidates.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Rep. Bobby Rush to retire after three decades in Congress but vows he is ‘not leaving the battlefield’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Earlier Tuesday, another prominent Black lawmaker, Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.), <a>announced that he will retire</a> after 30 years in Congress.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lawrence said that while she is not certain what her next step will be, her “journey is far from over” and that public service “will be the guiding light.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans cited Lawrence’s retirement as a signal that Democrats are worried about their party’s midterm prospects.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It sure seems like a lot of senior House Democrats don’t think they’ll be in the majority after the midterm elections,” National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Mike Berg said in a statement.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Lawrence’s Democratic colleagues hailed her work on Capitol Hill and in her community.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said in a statement that with Lawrence’s retirement, “Congress is losing an incredible public servant, trailblazer and leader.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The event was solemn and brief, lasting less than 10 minutes. Pelosi and other Democratic leaders stood in the front row; it was not immediately clear whether any Republicans attended.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Michigan school district requires clear backpacks after shooting, a common step questioned by experts</h1></div>
<h2>The move is one of several new safety measures being implemented after the Oxford attack</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paulina Firozi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 5:52 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Middle and high school students in a Michigan school district will be required to use clear backpacks on campus, one of numerous new safety measures announced weeks after a deadly school shooting at Oxford High School.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Clear backpacks will be provided for all middle- and high-schoolers, the district announced Wednesday in a message to the community.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Elementary school students will not be required to use the backpacks, but they will keep their bags in lockers or cubbies during the day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Criminologists and school safety experts said such backpack rules are common after shootings and other tragic events, but some say the policy is not the best way to address the problems that lead to gun violence in schools.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Please help me’: Kids with guns fueled a record number of school shootings in 2021</p></div>
<div><p>Schools are in an “impossible position right now, faced with rising threats of gun violence,” said James Densley, a professor of criminal justice at Metropolitan State University and a co-founder of the Violence Project.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Young people with guns drove a record number of school shootings last year — there were at least 42 acts of gun violence on K-12 campuses during regular hours, according to <a>data tracked by The Post</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Schools “are in this position of having to do something, and they’ve got to try and build trust with parents and community members and be seen to be doing something about this,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The clear-backpack requirement often is one visible signal meant to show schools are taking safety seriously, experts said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And it’s a signal that may help in some ways.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It could be reassuring for students, Densley said: “Almost like a placebo effect. ‘I can see inside, and there’s not a gun there. That makes me feel safe.’ ”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the other hand, he said, it could remind them “that this was the site of a school shooting. … Constantly reminding them of the fact that classmates were victims of violence could be re-traumatizing.”</p></div></div>
<a>analysis Child Trends published in 2020</a> that said at the state level, “most school safety laws passed after high-profile school shooting incidents primarily focus on preparing for, not preventing, such events.”
<div><p>How can schools detect potentially violent students? Researchers have an answer.</p></div>
<div><div><p>She pointed to the Oxford <a>shooting</a>, and the alleged gunman, a 15-year-old who had <a>come to the attention</a> of school officials for worrying behavior in the days before the deadly attack.</p></div></div>
<div><p>After Michigan school shooting, experts question what could have prevented it</p></div>
<div><div><p>Densley credited Oxford Community Schools for the additional measures it had announced, including making available trauma specialists and training for staffers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You want trauma-informed practices as you build these robust assessment protocols so we can prevent this type of violence from occurring,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the message to the community, the Oxford superintendent noted resources and encouraged their use. An <a>FAQ page on the district website</a> includes a list of where community members can access mental health resources.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This has been a challenging time for our community, and I want to encourage our Wildcats and their families to utilize the many resources and services for coping with trauma,” Throne said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>More than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters in 2021</h1></div>
<h2>As climate-fueled extreme weather intensified last year, more than 80 percent of Americans experienced a heat wave. The impacts of fires and severe storms also spread.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Sarah Kaplan</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Andrew Ba Tran</div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 1:05 p.m. EST|Updated today at 9:11 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes</a> in the suburbs of Denver. In between,
<b> </b>Americans suffered blistering heat waves, merciless droughts and monstrous hurricanes. People collapsed in farm fields and drowned in basement apartments; entire communities were obliterated by surging seas and encroaching flames.
<a>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, even before officials calculate the final toll of wildfires, drought and heat waves in the West.
<p>While the Federal Emergency Management Agency identified fewer climate-related disasters in individual counties last year, it declared eight of these emergencies statewide — the most since 1998 — encompassing 135 million people overall.</p>
<div><div><p>There is little doubt that the future will be worse. <a>Steadily rising temperatures</a> heighten the risk of wildfires, turbocharge rain storms, exacerbate flooding and intensify drought.</p></div></div>
<a>surged to near-record highs last year</a>. The Build Back Better bill, which contains the
<a> biggest clean energy investment in U.S. history</a>, stalled in Congress. The United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, produced pledges that put
<a>global average temperatures on track</a> to rise about 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century — a degree of warming that would transform once unthinkable disasters into near-annual occurrences.
<p>2022 begins with two crucial questions still unanswered: Will the United States invest in ways to make extreme weather less destructive? And will the country lead the world in curbing warming before it becomes impossible for humanity to adapt?</p>
<div><p>Cold, heat, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes: The year in weather disasters</p></div>
<div><div><p>These questions loom over Louisville, Colo., Mayor Ashley Stolzmann, who lost much of her town to wildfire on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When I lay awake the first night, not able to sleep from the fire, when I was evacuated from my house,” she said, “the first thing I thought of is: I need everyone to reduce their carbon emissions.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colorado residents still reeling from mass shooting now contend with Marshall Fire disaster</p></div>
<div><div><p>“To lose whole neighborhoods is just so very sad and devastating and unexpected,” Stolzmann said in an interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fires like that are not supposed to happen in densely populated suburbs. They’re not supposed to ignite in December, long after the first snows of the winter have usually fallen.</p></div></div>
<a>lasts more than a month longer</a> than it did four decades ago.
<div><p>“More people are living in more flammable landscapes,” said Chelsea Nagy, a research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Earth Lab. “More people are going to be interfacing with disaster.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Post’s analysis of federal data shows that about 15 percent of Americans live in a county that experienced a declared fire disaster this year, a number that has been steadily increasing since 2018.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is a testament to the way climate change “has loaded the weather dice against us,” climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe said.</p></div></div>
<a>sickened fish and emptied wells</a>. In California, the Dixie Fire
<a>burned an area larger</a> than New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas combined. More than 90 percent of the United States west of the Rockies was in drought last year.
<div><p>The Post also analyzed heat wave data from roughly 7,500 NOAA temperature monitors across the nation, finding that 80 percent of Americans live in a county that experienced at least one day of abnormally high temperatures last year.</p></div>
<a>fluctuations in the polar vortex</a>, allowing tongues of cold air to lash out into lower latitudes. Other studies indicate that
<a>warmer winter temperatures</a> provided fuel for the late-season thunderstorms that gave rise to December’s twisters.
<div><div><p>“It’s such an outlier, we don’t have anything to compare it to. How do you put statistics on that?” Wehner said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet people can change even faster than the climate, Wehner said, giving the United States a chance to adapt.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We need to build safety nets, a sense of belonging, a sense of shared space to deal with this,” she said. “It’s not only technical solutions.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, there are limits on people’s capacity to adapt, Wehner said, since disasters will become exponentially worse for every incremental increase in temperature.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Please keep all of these folks, and especially these children, in our prayers,” Mayor Jim Kenney (D) said at an emotional news conference. “Losing so many kids is devastating.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>The siblings each had multiple children, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, but it remains unclear whether all of them were home at the time or how many of them may have died.
<div><div><p>“Everybody is still in shock,” Purifoy said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Firefighters said they arrived at the three-story, 2,300-square-foot rowhouse, operated by the Philadelphia Housing Authority, in the 800 block of North 23rd Street about 6:40 a.m. and saw flames shooting up from the second floor.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a news release Wednesday night that revised the number of dead, the city said firefighters removed “one child from the building, but the child did not survive.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Witnesses told local media that they were awakened by screams coming from the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Loved ones, many warmed by blankets, formed a prayer circle nearby. Vanessa Price, 46, said she was a cousin of a family that lived in the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s our brothers, sisters, daughters,” she said of the fire victims. “We just got to keep them in prayer.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Price said it was particularly sad that so many were children. “They didn’t get a chance to experience life,” she said. “It’s a loss people don’t want to wake up to.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>United and Delta said they would cancel dozens of flights on Christmas Eve, citing staff shortages from the omicron-fueled surge in coronavirus cases sweeping the country.</p></div></div>
<div><p>On Thursday, United Airlines said in a statement that it was canceling 120 flights on Friday because the fast-spreading coronavirus variant has had “a direct impact on our flight crews and the people who run our operation.”</p></div>
<div><p>The airlines said they were working hard to accommodate as many passengers as possible. The disruption comes as many people who had to cancel trips and getaways last year because of the pandemic are trying to make up for lost time.</p></div>
<p>According to data from the Transportation Security Administration, since Dec. 16, more than 2 million people have passed through its security checkpoints almost daily — approximately double the number recorded on the same days last year. </p>
<div><div><p>TSA recorded 2,081,297 passengers on Wednesday, which surpassed the number of travelers reported the same day in 2019, before the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even as the omicron variant pushes some to reconsider their holiday trips, the company has not seen an increase in customer cancellations, said Kimberly Gibbs, a United spokeswoman.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>New York City officials announced Thursday that they are scaling back plans for a full-strength New Year’s Eve celebration at Times Square as infections surge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>De Blasio said in a statement that the modifications would “keep the fully vaccinated crowd safe and healthy as we ring in the New Year.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In mid-November, the mayor had blown on a noisemaker while announcing the return of the legendary celebration: “We can finally get back together again,” he said. “It’s going to be amazing.”</p></div></div>
<p>But the rise of the omicron variant has scuttled large gatherings once again. The Rockettes ended their Christmas Spectacular early. Many Broadway shows canceled performances. The Critics Choice Awards ceremony scheduled for Jan. 9 was postponed.</p>
<a>saying</a> they are “the kind of functions, in the context of covid, and particularly in the context of omicron, that you do not want to go to.”
<p>De Blasio’s office warned that additional New Year’s Eve precautions could be announced in the coming days if deemed necessary. It noted that celebrations can be watched from home on a <a>live webcast</a> or on a <a>new app, VNYE</a>.</p>
<h2>U.S. now reporting more infections than during delta summer surge</h2>

<a>Moderna </a>vaccines say additional doses provide significant protection against infection by omicron.
<div><p>In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that omicron made up 73 percent of new cases from Dec. 12 to 18. Detection of the first omicron infection in the country was <a>announced </a>Dec. 1.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Researchers at the University of Washington have <a>projected </a>that the United States could mark a high of some 2.8 million new daily infections in late January, dwarfing numbers from last winter.</p></div></div>
<a>a South African study</a>, which has not been peer reviewed, showed omicron was 80 percent less likely to lead to hospitalizations than delta. On the same day, researchers at
<a>Imperial College London</a> also said there was less risk of hospitalization for omicron than delta.

<div><div><p>Italy on Thursday slightly tightened its coronavirus rules, mandating outdoor masks and closing dance clubs for the next five weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As part of the moves adopted Thursday, Italy also said that unvaccinated people would not be allowed to have counter service at cafes — essentially revoking the daily rite of having an espresso at the bar.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The moves came hours after the country announced 44,595 new coronavirus cases — the highest daily total of the pandemic — as well as 168 deaths, the highest 24-hour figure since May.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even before Thursday, the unvaccinated had been barred from restaurants and many other indoor activities.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There are 1,000 covid-19 patients in Italian intensive care units, compared with about 4,000 at several earlier peaks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Italy had maintained an outdoor mask mandate this year but dropped it as conditions improved. Greece and Spain also reinstituted outdoor mask mandates this week.</p></div></div>
