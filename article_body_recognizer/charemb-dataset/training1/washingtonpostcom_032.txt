<a>Barca</a>, the popular wine bar on Alexandria’s waterfront in Virginia, pitched a soiree with appetizers, a paella buffet, a pair of drink tickets and “the best seat in the house” for Old Town’s annual firework display for $159.

<div><h1>How Virginia’s I-95 fiasco led to a 93-year-old driver’s 39-hour odyssey</h1></div>
<h2>James Murphy got trapped on an icy Interstate 95 and then got lost. A radio reporter, travel planner, police officer and hotel workers helped him on his way.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Katherine Shaver</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 7:17 p.m. EST|Updated today at 7:58 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Murphy left Albany, N.Y., about 8:30 a.m. Monday. He didn’t get to sleep again — or eat another meal following a brief Monday lunch break — until almost 11 p.m. Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If not for a half-dozen people who went above and beyond,” Kathleen said Wednesday, “he’d probably still be sleeping in his car.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>I-95 reopens in Virginia after snowstorm forced closure that stranded hundreds of motorists</p></div>
<div><div><p>“He’s 93,” she said, “but good Lord, we can’t stop him.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While heading through Northern Virginia on I-95 in the early evening, her father later recounted, he suddenly hit a wall of traffic that would eventually stretch for miles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He wouldn’t budge for another 17 hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was nowhere to go,” he said. “All I could do was sit there and try to stay warm.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Was he ever bored? Tired? Hungry?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Yes,” he said. “But there’s nothing you can do about it, so you just put up with it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In all the hours that she checked in by phone, Kathleen said, “he never complained, not once.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was very, very worried,” Kathleen said. “My dad is a very strong, smart and stable guy, but it was alarming for me. He’s 93. He’s my person in the world.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Calls grow for examination of how Virginia handled a snowstorm that paralyzed I-95</p></div>
<div><div><p>With her father still stuck early Tuesday morning, Kathleen emailed the radio station’s traffic tip line. She was surprised when traffic reporter Mary DePompa wrote back, saying she wanted to help.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>DePompa said later it was the worst meltdown she’d seen in 20 years of traffic reporting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We began to feel like a crisis help line,” DePompa said. Unable to tell motorists when the standstill would end, she said, “I just let people talk. … It was awful.”</p></div></div>
<p>When Kathleen’s email said her father was 93 and stranded in the cold alone, “I thought, ‘I’ve got to help her,’” DePompa said. “Put yourself in her shoes. Could you imagine if that was your dad?”</p>
<div><div><p>DePompa suggested Kathleen direct her father to a gas station or church for assistance after he got off the highway. She tried to help determine his exact location and plot routes around the mess.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Timeline: How a snowstorm brought I-95 to a standstill for 48 miles</p></div>
<div><div><p>Angela Stott, branch manager at Murphy’s home AAA office in Albany, said she understood the frantic tone in Kathleen’s voice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The first thing I thought of was what if this was my father,” Stott said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stott’s colleague eventually found a hotel room at a conference center in Warrenton, Va., while Stott studied mapping software for the best route.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Murphy was on the phone with Kathleen, Howser said, and “just seemed done.” He said he’d been stuck on I-95 “forever” and was trying to reach his hotel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My heart went out to him,” Howser said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re 93 or 25. It’s terrible to be in your car for so long with no resources.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By Wednesday afternoon, he was nearing Charlotte. Traffic had slowed to a crawl again, but he didn’t seem to mind. He arrived at his destination Thursday evening.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The weather is nice here,” he said while in North Carolina. “I’m doing fine.”</p></div></div>

<p>The world’s biggest consumer electronics trade show known as CES feels weird this year, with far fewer attendees gracing the Las Vegas conference halls where consumer tech companies show off their latest and greatest (almost) every January.</p>
<div><div>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</div></div>
<p>As always, some of the industry’s plans are raising eyebrows. People still don’t have legal protections for the personal data they generate in normal old smartphone apps, yet consumer tech is marching forward into virtual reality.</p>
<div><p>What it’s like at one of the world’s biggest tech trade shows as omicron surges</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Garments made for gaming — and the metaverse</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The age of the metaverse is nearly upon us, according to some of the biggest names in tech. But what good is palling around with people in a sprawling, interconnected virtual space if you can’t feel the “world” around you?</p>
<div><div><p>That’s where the smart — and sometimes painful — garments from <a>Owo</a> enter the picture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>At last, augmented reality glasses that don’t look (that) ridiculous</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>But what’s a wearable like this actually meant to do? The software on the prototype we saw was far from finished, but it mentioned the ability to control phone calls, view photos and even display text on a virtual teleprompter.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Spacious space abodes</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some CES presenters are thinking forward to when people live in entirely connected homes. Sierra Space is thinking about when people live in giant inflatable houses on the moon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A fitness tracker for your cat</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The pet’s place in the family is changing,” says Caudron. “It’s no longer a dog-master relationship. We think of ourselves as parents and our dogs as a member of the family.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A projector that works in unexpected places</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Even now, in the middle of the strangest CES on record, companies have devoted big chunks of the show floor to showing off their flashiest, best TVs. But for Samsung, one of its biggest new products might actually be one of its smallest.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A robot that nibbles your fingers and warms your heart</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>True comfort is priceless, and for some people, that kind of peace only comes when animals or babies cutely gnaw on them. If that’s you, a tiny product from Japan just might be the best impulse buy of your life.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aoki hopes to usher Amagami Ham Ham through a crowdfunding campaign in a few months, and — assuming that’s successful — he aims to sell the robot in Japan and abroad for the equivalent of about $30.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The biggest tech trends to watch for in 2022</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A robot that probably upsets you</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Humanoid robots are getting more lifelike, but only compared to their predecessors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just take the Ameca robot from Engineered Arts, a true-to-scale, metal-and-plastic robot person who blinks, shrugs and grimaces just like you and me — if you and me were stilted human facsimiles.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h4><div>Tech giants swore off donations to those who denied Biden’s win. Their cash is still likely getting through.</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>A year later, major companies in the sector have largely stuck by the letter of their word, not giving funds altogether or to those specific candidates for much of the 2022 election cycle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But critics on the left say many of these organizations violated the spirit of the commitments by donating to GOP national organizations, which made no such assurances about who will or won’t receive the funds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This means their money could still end up supporting the candidates they rebuffed. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s one of the many issues for which tech companies are still answering to policymakers about their actions leading up to and in the wake of the insurrection at the Capitol. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It also shows that while some Republican tech critics are urging their colleagues to stop taking money from Silicon Valley as a sign of protest, that movement has been slow to gain steam.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now, companies are again facing pressure from liberal watchdogs to honor or expand their donation halts, signaling that scrutiny is likely to live on beyond the anniversary.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s a breakdown of how much companies have stuck to their commitments, according to federal disclosure filings reviewed by The Technology 202, confirming past reporting:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Verizon: Like ATT and Google, the wireless carrier pledged to halt contributions to objectors and has not made any since, but it did contribute $15,000 apiece to the NRCC and NRSC.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spokespeople for Oracle, ATT, Verizon, Comcast and T-Mobile did not return requests for comment on the donations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Few companies, however, have explicitly said whether they plan to swear off donations for certification objectors for good, leaving open the possibility they quietly resume in the future.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h4><div>Lawmakers say Google rival's critique of the search giant shows the need for legislation</div></h4></div></div>
