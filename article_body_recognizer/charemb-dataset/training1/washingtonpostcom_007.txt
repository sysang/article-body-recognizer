<div><div><h3><div>Banneker continues its ascent</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>After her team fell to Dunbar in the 2020 D.C. Interscholastic Athletic Association final, Banneker girls’ coach Abby Sondak had a hard time accepting the loss.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite setting a school record for conference wins (11) and boasting the DCIAA player of the year (guard Alyson Jefferson), the Bulldogs lost by nearly 30 points.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Losing is a part of the game, but to lose in the manner that we did to Dunbar for a second time was heartbreaking,” Sondak said. “It just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That taste lingered for some time, given that DCIAA competition was canceled last year because of the pandemic. Sondak and a new group of Bulldogs are finally getting a chance this winter to wash it away.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After the first half of the season, Banneker (7-2) is alone atop the DCIAA even though the team returned just two players from that 2020 squad.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Banneker has dominated when playing District teams that are not private schools, winning those games by an average score of 51-13.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Washington Post Staff</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Montgomery County Public Schools announced Sunday that all indoor track events scheduled to be held at Prince George’s Sports and Learning Complex will be canceled as the facility is converted into a vaccination site.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are deeply hurt by this update,” Wootton Coach Harold Warren said. “So hopefully, you know, we have to find a way of still getting [the athletes] to stay uplifted and stay committed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The announcement comes as coronavirus case numbers <a>continue to rise throughout the area</a> and Maryland works to make vaccines easily available to residents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because facilities equipped for indoor track events are hard to come by, Montgomery County coaches are scheduling smaller outdoor meets hosted by schools starting Jan. 12.</p></div></div>
<p>Warren said cold weather could pose problems for athletes competing outside during the winter. But the smaller meets, which are expected to include five schools each, will allow more athletes from each school to participate for the time being.</p>

<div><div><h3><div>Swimming and diving</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Grace Zifcak is one of the top divers in the state. It wasn’t by choice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was a gymnast until I was 15 years old. Then a tree fell on me and I broke my neck,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now a senior, Zifcak hopes to place in the top five at Maryland’s state meet at the end of February before she heads to the University of Kansas in the fall.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I’m looking forward to doing this further in college, and I hope we have the rest of our season with covid and everything,” Zifcak said. “That would be tragic if that was taken away from us our senior year.”</p></div>
<div><div><p><i>— Spencer Nusbaum</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Wrestling</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bob Seidel took the helm at St. Mary’s Ryken this season, looking to guide the defending Washington Catholic Athletic Conference champion to the next level.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And through these first few weeks, the Knights have continued to establish themselves as a dominant program in the area. They took first place at both the South River and Louisa duals, powering them to a 15-0 record.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have a great group of talented wrestlers who are coming in with wrestling backgrounds and are really willing to put in the work,” Seidel said. “It’s starting to pay off.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Seidel, a New Jersey native, came to Leonardtown after coaching at Colts Neck (N.J.) and Waialua (Hawaii) and wrestling at the University of Virginia. He inherited a young squad: Nine of his starters are freshmen or sophomores.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The youth has blended with the upperclassmen, including nationally acclaimed junior captains Clayton Gabrielson and Mason Buckler and senior T.J. McCauley, who have been instrumental to their coach’s transition.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“All three of those guys have helped me on and off the mat conveying the message we want as a program: ‘Do everything right — on the mat, in the classroom and in life,’ ” Seidel said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Hockey</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Friday, Alexandria City/Wakefield will host Woodbridge in a battle of the top two teams in the Capital Scholastic Hockey League.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Alexandria City/Wakefield has been dominant all season, boasting a 6-0-0 record to top the CSHL’s North division. The team most recently defeated Lake Braddock/Fairfax, 7-5, on Dec. 17.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Scott Allen</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 27, 2021 at 9:25 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><i>A look at the good (Hail!) and bad (Fail!) from the Washington Football Team’s </i><a><i>56-14 loss</i></a><i> to the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hail: Rodney Harrison’s frankness</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I feel bad for Terry McLaurin,” Harrison said of Washington’s No. 1 wideout, “because he’s always had to play with garbage quarterbacks and he’s a top-10 receiver and talent.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Brewer: In one half of football and fighting, Ron Rivera’s rebuild descended into chaos</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Fail: Getting humiliated in prime time</b></p></div></div>
<a>Seattle Seahawks</a> this season, but Sunday night’s beatdown brought back awful memories of the franchise’s
<a>59-28 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles</a> on “Monday Night Football” in 2010. Washington trailed that game 35-0 early in the second quarter and 45-14 at halftime.
<div><div><p><b>Hail: Big-man touchdowns</b></p></div></div>
<a>on a similar play earlier in the day</a>, Washington should make it a point to get a big man in the end zone over the next two weeks, because copying the Cowboys when it came to
<a>having custom benches on the sideline</a> worked out so well. Speaking of …
<div><div><p><b>Fail: Cooler heads and cooling benches</b></p></div></div>
<a>second-quarter altercation</a> between Washington defensive linemen and former Alabama teammates Jonathan Allen and Daron Payne.
<div><div><p>“S--- happens,” Allen, who threw a punch at Payne, said afterward. “Brothers fight.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During NBC Sports Washington’s postgame show, Brian Mitchell <a>offered an impassioned take</a> on the benches, which Washington should really have left behind as a late Christmas present for Jerry Jones.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hail: Randy Gregory</b></p></div></div>
<a>similar scene on the grass at FedEx Field</a> two weeks ago, when Gregory gave Heinicke a huge smile after the quarterback was knocked down on another incompletion. It’s a wonder that Gregory wasn’t penalized for taunting Sunday night.
<div><div><p><b>Fail: Defending Dak Prescott</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>How Washington went from playoff contender to big mess in five days</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hail: John Bates</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Fail: Washington’s tackling</b></p></div></div>
<a>52-yard touchdown run</a> earlier in the day, which is not a look anyone should aspire to replicate.

<div><div><p>“I’ll take 20 of those a year if I could,” Sheary said of Blackwood’s giveaway. “Kind of a fortunate bounce.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We gave up so many odd-man rushes trying to keep pucks in or just being on the wrong side of the puck,” Dowd said. “I think that just overshadowed our in-zone time a little bit.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Defenseman John Carlson brought the Capitals (20-6-8) within one with a snipe from the right dot with 46.6 seconds left in the first. It was Washington’s first four-on-four goal of the season.</p></div></div>

<a>taking a six-day pause</a>. Here’s a look at the new policies in place in each league:
<div><div><h3>NFL</h3></div></div>
<p>Amid surging coronavirus cases, the <a>NFL significantly altered its protocols</a> in the latter portion of the season, changing how quickly players can return to their teams in the event they test positive, and how often players are tested.</p>
<a>reduced to five days</a> for both vaccinated and unvaccinated players after the
<a>Centers for Disease Control and prevention issued new recommendations</a>, so long as the players are 24 hours removed from having a fever while other symptoms “have resolved or improved,” the NFL told teams in a memo.
<div><div><p>Vaccinated players who test positive can return to their teams before the five-day isolation period is over if they produce two negative tests. Unvaccinated players who test positive must remain in isolation for all five days.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Jerry Brewer: The NFL’s new covid approach is smart for making money — and bad for public health</p></div>
<div><div><p>The NFL has declined to mandate vaccines or booster shots for its players, though it has encouraged players to get them.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3>NBA</h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The NBA also <a>altered its coronavirus protocols</a> in mid-December. The new regulations call for increased mask usage and additional testing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Covid could turn the NBA's Christmas showcase into a dud</p></div>

<div><div><p>Last week, four days before the NBA’s annual <a>Christmas Day showcase</a>, Commissioner Adam Silver <a>told ESPN</a> that there were “no plans right now to pause the season.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This virus will not be eradicated, so we have to learn to live with it,” Silver <a>continued</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Injuries and covid complicate NBA all-star voting</p></div>
<div><div><h3>NHL</h3></div></div>
<a>will force NHL players to miss the Beijing Olympics</a>. The league continues to make schedule changes, including

<div><div><p>The league’s recently unveiled <a>enhanced protocols</a> resemble the ones used during the 2020-21 season. They apply to both vaccinated and unvaccinated players.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All members of a team’s traveling party will be tested daily instead of every third day, though they are not subject to testing on their days off or for 90 days after a positive test.</p></div></div>
