<p>Cheney initially raised that criticism on Wednesday, prompting Pelosi (D-Calif.) to ask the White House to repudiate remarks she felt were "beneath the dignity of the debate" over how to proceed in Iraq.</p>
<p>"She accused me of questioning her patriotism. I didn't question her patriotism. I questioned her judgment," Cheney said during a trip to Australia.</p>
<p>Cheney's comments are part of an increasingly testy effort to counter those Democratic initiatives.</p>
<p>Pelosi's call to the White House was fielded by chief of staff Josh Bolten: the speaker apparently did not get to talk to President Bush about the matter.</p>
<p>Far from a repudiation, the message from the White House is that Cheney was not out of line, but evaluating policy on the merits.</p>
<p>"The Vice President out of line? Absolutely not," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said yesterday aboard Air Force One on the way to North Carolina. "He was questioning the merits."</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Marianna Sotomayor</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Jacqueline Alemany</div></span></div></span></div><div>May 12, 2021 at 6:48 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><p>House Republicans began Wednesday by quickly ousting Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) from her leadership post because she continues to challenge former president Donald Trump over his false claim that the presidential election was stolen.</p></div>
<div><p>Cheney, 54, has called her decision to publicly fight Trump a matter of principle, warning that allowing him to falsely claim that the election was stolen amounts to an attack on democracy and is destructive to the GOP and its values.</p></div>
<div><p>Inside Liz Cheney’s plan to take on former president Donald Trump</p></div>
<div><p>The day also produced a muddled message about what moving on will mean for the party and to what degree Trump will be willing to forget the past and embrace GOP leaders’ plan of winning over voters with a focus on the future.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Trump publicly reveled in Cheney’s ouster.</p></div></div>
<p>“Liz Cheney is a bitter, horrible human being. I watched her yesterday and realized how bad she is for the Republican Party. She has no personality or anything good having to do with politics or our Country,” he said in a statement.</p>
<div><div><p>And despite Trump’s repeated claims that the election was stolen from him and the vote earlier in the day to remove Cheney, McCarthy said that no one is questioning the legitimacy of Biden’s win.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think that is all over with,” McCarthy told reporters following a meeting at the White House with the president and congressional leaders. “We’re sitting here with the president today.”</p></div></div>
<a>signed on to a Texas lawsuit</a> seeking unprecedented judicial intervention in disallowing millions of votes and the election results from four key swing states that went for Biden.
<div><div><p>Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a leading member of the staunchly conservative House Freedom Caucus, said that while he recognizes Biden as president, he still cast doubt on the vote that landed him the White House.</p></div></div>
<p>“Under our system and the way it works, he’s the president,” he said. “I do think we should look at the election results, but yeah, he’s the president of the United States. I’ve said that all along.”</p>
<div><div><p>Shortly after disposing of Cheney, several House Republicans appeared at a hearing examining the events of Jan. 6 and accused Democrats of unfairly blaming Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Andrew S. Clyde (R-Ga.) said what took place that day was not an insurrection and compared it to <a>a normal day</a> on Capitol Hill.</p></div></div>
<div><p>41 minutes of fear: A video timeline from inside the Capitol siege</p></div>
<a>Trump loyalist</a>. Trump and Republican leaders have endorsed her candidacy for conference chair.
<div><p>Elise Stefanik said she was one of the ‘most bipartisan’ members of Congress. Then she went all in on Trump’s false election claims.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I think she’s liberal,” said Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), who does not plan to support her candidacy.</p></div></div>
<p>“I stand by my statement on the House floor in January, and I stand by my statement that there are serious issues related to election irregularities in the state of Georgia, as well as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin,” she said.</p>
<div><div><p>Some in the conference said the party should not rush to vote on Cheney’s successor and are promoting the idea of Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) challenging Stefanik, a move his office said he had not ruled out.</p></div></div>
<p>“While not ruling anything out, Congressman Roy has never sought a position in conference leadership,” a Roy spokesman said. “But if the position must be filled, then this must be a contested race — not a coronation.”</p>
<div><p>The ‘GOP Impeachment 10’ try to navigate Cheney’s demise and their own futures</p></div>
<div><div><p>“There are but two parties now: patriots and traitors,” said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), chair of the House Democratic Caucus, referring to a quote from Ulysses S. Grant regarding the Civil War.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Liz Cheney was canceled today for speaking her mind,” Buck said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But her standing inside the party that her father once helped lead as vice president quickly fell because of her continued clashes with Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney’s few remaining allies in the conference bemoaned the decision to remove her and said there was no real debate during Wednesday’s meeting and that the day’s business was dispatched with quickly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a sad day,” said Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some of Cheney’s opponents disagreed and instead chose to taunt the former party leader.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey, goodbye Liz Cheney,” tweeted freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn (N.C.), who was a featured speaker <a>during the Republican National Convention</a> last summer.</p></div></div>

<h2>Key findings of The Post’s Jan. 6 investigation</h2>
<h6><b>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</b></h6>
<li>Alerts were raised by local officials, FBI informants, social media companies, former national security officials, researchers, lawmakers and tipsters.</li>
<li>One of the biggest efforts to come out of Sept. 11, 2001 — a national network of multi-agency intelligence centers — spotted a flood of Jan. 6 warnings, but federal agencies did not show much interest in its information.</li>
<li>The FBI limited its own understanding of how extremists were mobilizing when it switched over its social media monitoring service on the last weekend of 2020.</li>
<h6><b>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</b></h6>
<li>Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was left rattled by Trump’s firing of senior Pentagon officials just after the election and sought to put guardrails on deployment of the National Guard.</li>
<h6><b>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</b></h6>
<li>The U.S. Capitol Police had been tracking threatening social media posts for weeks but was hampered by poor communication and planning.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</b></h6>
<h6><b>Escalating danger signs were in full view hours before the Capitol attack but did not trigger a stepped-up security response</b></h6>
<li>Hundreds of Trump supporters clashed with police at the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial on the morning of Jan. 6, some with shields and gas masks, presaging the violence to come.</li>
<li>D.C. homeland security employees spotted piles of backpacks left by rallygoers outside the area where the president would speak — a phenomenon the agency had warned a week earlier could be a sign of concealed weapons.</li>
<h6><b>Trump had direct warnings of the risks but stood by for 187 minutes before telling his supporters to go home</b></h6>
<b> </b>House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, other Republican lawmakers and numerous White House advisers to urge the mob to disperse, a delay that contributed to harrowing acts of violence.
<h6><b>His allies pressured Pence to reject the election results even after the Capitol siege</b></h6>
<li>John C. Eastman, an attorney advising Trump, emailed Pence’s lawyer as a shaken Congress was reconvening to argue that the vice president should still reject electors from Arizona and other states.</li>
<li>Earlier in the day, while the vice president, his family and aides were hiding from the rioters, Eastman emailed Pence’s lawyer to blame the violence on Pence’s refusal to block certification of Biden’s victory.</li>
<h6><b>The FBI was forced to improvise a plan to help take back control of the Capitol</b></h6>
<li>After the breach,<b> </b>the bureau deployed three tactical teams that were positioned nearby, but they were small, specialized teams and did not bring overwhelming manpower.</li>
<li>As the riot escalated, acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen scrambled to keep up with the deluge of calls from senior government officials and desperate lawmakers.</li>
<h6><b>Republican efforts to undermine the 2020 election restarted immediately after the Capitol attack</b></h6>
<b> </b>setting in motion a chaotic process that further sowed doubt in the results and a wave of similar partisan investigations in other states.
<h6><b>False election claims by Trump that spurred the Capitol attack have become a driving force in the Republican Party</b></h6>
<li>They include 10 candidates running for secretary of state, a position with sway over elections in many states.</li>
<h6><b>Trump’s attacks have led to escalating threats of violence</b></h6>
<li>Election officials in at least 17 states have collectively received hundreds of threats to their personal safety or their lives since Jan. 6, with a concentration in the six states where Trump has focused his attacks on the election results.</li>
<li>Ominous emails and calls have spiked immediately after the former president and his allies raised new claims.</li>
<h6><b>First responders are struggling with deep trauma</b></h6>
<ul><li>Those who tried to protect the Capitol are contending with serious physical injuries, nightmares and intense anxiety. “Normal is gone,” said one Capitol Police commander.</li></ul>

<p>Soon after abortion rights groups gathered outside the Supreme Court on Wednesday, antiabortion activists began to surround them. Standing shoulder to shoulder, they formed a wall with five-foot banners featuring graphic photos of aborted fetuses.</p>
<div><div><p>“Murderers! Murderers!” yelled one antiabortion activist. “Jesus will smite you for your murderous ways.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Abortion rights activists shouted back. “You don’t even know the word of God,” said Jerri Riley, 66, who drove to the protest from her home in Tulsa. “I’ve been a Christian my entire life.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch has explicitly called on the court to use this case to overturn the 48-year-old precedent establishing a constitutional right to an abortion.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>U.S. Capitol Police arrested 33 people for blocking traffic near First Street NE and Constitution Avenue. The arrests did not disrupt the rallies in front of the Supreme Court, <a>police said</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I am positively surprised. Honestly, I was expecting more on the pro-choice side,” said Savannah Benton, a student at Liberty University who opposes abortion.</p></div></div>
<a>a recent Washington Post-ABC News poll</a> found that Americans support the landmark abortion decision in
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> by a 2-to-1 margin. By a similar margin, the public opposes the Texas law restricting abortion.
<div><div><p>To kick off the day of protests, a group of four abortion rights activists took Mifepristone, a pill that can be taken to end a pregnancy, at 7:45 a.m. in front of the Supreme Court.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>None of the protesters were pregnant, said Amelia Bonow, co-founder of the abortion rights group Shout Your Abortion, who orchestrated the demonstration. (Taken correctly, Mifepristone is<a>widely regarded</a> as safe.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We reject the idea that this court ever could have told us not to end our own pregnancies,” Bonow said. “We are going to help each other have safe abortions forever, whether abortion is legal or not.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Abortion opponents began playing the oral arguments on large speakers outside the Supreme Court at 10 a.m. The Supreme Court’s live stream is a <a>new feature</a> introduced during the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The state of Mississippi presented its arguments <a>first</a>, and the antiabortion crowd grew quiet as Mississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart started to speak.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the abortion rights side, speakers continued to take the podium, shouting to drone out the solicitor general’s arguments.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We protest being strong-armed,” said Mira Rivera, a rabbi, speaking into a microphone. Then she started chanting: “Justice! Justice!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mary Lynn Damare, 67, an abortion rights supporter who flew to D.C. from her home in Southaven, Miss., tried to ignore the heckling, proudly holding a sign that read: “Mississippi women say: We won’t go back!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What frightens me about the antiabortion crew,” she said, “is how much they care about children before they’re born and don’t seem to care a wit after they’re born.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s been encouraging throughout the semester to see this case come up,” said Delia Tuttlebee, a 19-year-old freshman at Mississippi College, a private Baptist college in Clinton, Miss.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The new Twitter account looked like it came from a smiling blond woman who lives in D.C., retweeting neighborhood news about a Thanksgiving giveaway, a bald eagle sighting and bike lanes near Lincoln Park.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She wrote in her bio that she was a journalist who recently got a dog and loved avocados. She included the hashtag “#DCStatehood.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then she finally sent the first tweet of her own: “HAPPENING NOW,” she wrote on Saturday. “About 500 men with riot shields are marching in #WashingtonDC.”</p></div></div>
<a>and disinformation researchers</a> say.
<div><div><p>The group did not have a permit, according to National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst.</p></div></div>
<a>remains an attractive location</a> for these hate groups, as it has for generations, including when
<a>white-robed Ku Klux Klan members marched down</a> Pennsylvania Avenue in 1925.
<div><p>D.C. police confirmed that the Patriot Front group marched from Virginia to the Capitol and that officers monitored the protest to “ensure the demonstration remained peaceful.” There were no incidents or arrests, police said.</p></div>
<a>both stemming from the “Great Replacement Theory,”</a> the conspiratorial idea of an engineered demographic replacement of White Christians that is frequently repeated by right-wing pundits such as Fox News’s Tucker Carlson.
<div><div><p>Rousseau could not be reached.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A post-Charlottesville rebrand</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Patriot Front’s name is an attempt to make its message more palatable to the masses after its group was associated with the Charlottesville murder.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since then, white supremacist groups have argued over the most effective way to spread their hateful messaging. For Patriot Front, that has mostly been through distributing fliers and posters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There were more than 5,000 cases of white supremacist propaganda in 2020, a near doubling from the prior year,<a> the ADL found</a>. The Patriot Front accounted for more than 80 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This paranoia came after the public blowback to the Unite the Right rally, Squire said, showing the ways hate groups and leaders like Rousseau took some lessons from four years ago and apply them today.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Organizing for optics</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>At least 1,500 people retweeted the fake account “reporting” of the march, according to an archive of the Twitter account. The message was amplified — and in that way, experts said, it was a success.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the same time, the media arm of another white supremacist organization embedded with Rousseau’s group. They shot videos and posted them in far-right chat rooms.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Thomas, why are we marching in D. C.?" the person behind the camera asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rousseau’s supporters, including Mike Peinovich, more commonly known by his pseudonym “Mike Enoch,” a popular far-right podcast host, praised the rally. But many other right-wing figures had their doubts.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>More than 40 House Democrats call for Boebert to be stripped of committee assignments over anti-Muslim attacks</h1></div>
<h2>A letter from five caucus chairs said there must be ‘consequences when Members of Congress demonize an entire religion and promote hate from their positions of public trust’</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Mariana Alfaro</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Marianna Sotomayor</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Felicia Sonmez</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 2, 2021 at 4:54 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>“There must be consequences when Members of Congress demonize an entire religion and promote hate from their positions of public trust,” they wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spokespeople for Boebert and McCarthy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Omar said the story was “made up” and called for Boebert to be disciplined by House leaders.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And while the Democrats’ Thursday letters target Republican leadership, no decision has been made by Democratic leadership to strip Boebert of her committee assignments.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some Democrats have begun to privately argue that if they punish Boebert for her comments, regardless of how dangerous they are, they would spend the rest of their term censuring Republicans for other problematic remarks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During an interview Thursday on MSNBC, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) brushed off a question on whether Democratic leadership has had conversations about Boebert’s behavior.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hoyer said he did no anticipate a vote “certainly this week, or possibly next week” on Boebert’s committee assignments.</p></div></div>
<div><p>During a news conference Tuesday, Omar <a>played</a> to reporters a threatening voice mail that she said she received after Boebert accused her of “anti-American and antisemitic” rhetoric in a video posted on social media.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Omar and two other Muslim lawmakers in the House — Carson and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) — urged McCarthy to make clear that such attacks will not be tolerated within his party’s ranks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We cannot pretend that this hate speech from leading politicians doesn’t have real consequences,” Omar said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>McCarthy has remained mum about Boebert’s behavior.</p></div></div>

<div><p>But little has been said publicly by party leaders or rank-and-file members about whether they find the source of this feuding problematic: Islamophobic attacks by some Republicans against a Democratic congresswoman who is Muslim.</p></div>
<div><p>The party’s focus on the political ramifications of the infighting rather than the substance of the disagreement has led civil rights groups and Democrats to charge that Republicans are embracing, or at least enabling, bigotry.</p></div>
<div><p>House GOP leaders face calls to confront Islamophobia among their ranks</p></div>
<div><div><p>He then defended Boebert, saying that she publicly apologized for her remarks and called Omar to discuss the issue.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We should work together and talk to one another. In disagreements when something goes astray, you apologize for it, exactly what Lauren Boebert did,” McCarthy said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Boebert’s apology was more complicated than McCarthy described.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Omar then hung up on Boebert.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Minnesota congresswoman said earlier this week that she has received death threats that she attributes to Republican attacks on her.</p></div></div>
<p>This has led to charges from Democrats that McCarthy has become so consumed with securing the GOP votes he will need to become speaker if Republicans take back the House in 2023, that he will tolerate any behavior by members of his conference.</p>
<div><p>Would-be speaker Kevin McCarthy walks the Trump tightrope, pursuing a GOP House</p></div>
<div><p>But the GOP leaders are not alone in their silence about the Islamophobic remarks — most rank-and-file Republicans have avoided criticizing Boebert and Greene and instead focused their remarks on the need to stop the infighting.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.) said that while comments from Boebert, Greene and like-minded colleagues remain a “big distraction,” their remarks should not be seen as reflective of the entire Republican Party.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Weeks after Holocaust Museum visit, Rep. Greene makes new Nazi-era comparison in opposing vaccination push</p></div>

<div><p><span>A MAGA squad of Trump loyalists sees its influence grow amid demands for political purity among Republicans</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Several moderate Republicans in competitive districts refrained from criticizing McCarthy for his handling of the week’s fracas and said they were not concerned by the rising influence of the far-right flank.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think he’s given the right message: Stay united — this fight is against them,” Malliotakis said referring to Democrats</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mace, however, said it’s a mistake for the party not to call out incendiary or bigoted comments — regardless of who is making them.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Moreover, Republican leaders did not seem to heed the calls by Democratic leaders to hold their own to account.</p></div></div>
<div><p>House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) echoed Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in his defense of Boebert, suggesting that Republicans would not take action, given that the freshman congresswoman apologized publicly in a tweet.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The hesitancy to condemn Boebert, after Democrats swiftly censured and removed Gosar from his committee assignments, has motivated Omar’s allies to escalate their demands to also punish Boebert.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In this moment, we’re looking for equitable outrage,” Pressley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pressed on why Democratic leaders have not moved as quickly to punish Boebert, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday that he expects the House to hold her accountable, but he did not mention how or when.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pressley agreed, telling reporters, “I’m confident there will be action taken, and there must because inaction is to be complicit in Islamophobia.”</p></div></div>
<a>CNN’s Jake Tapper</a> over the weekend that she was “very confident” that Pelosi would take action against Boebert.
<div><p>There is also an acknowledgment that punishing Republicans may only embolden some of them, helping them fundraise with their base. Even so, members of the group backing the resolution hope leadership will listen to them and act.</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Marianna Sotomayor</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 21, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Liberals are furious.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What you need to know about Joe Manchin’s hold on the Democratic agenda</p></div>
<p>Whether liberals’ public pronouncements that they are done scaling back their priorities is just pique talking or a firm decision will be just as key to what the party can accomplish as whether Manchin comes back to the negotiating table.</p>
<div><div><p>Bowman and a handful of other liberals voted against the spending for roads, bridges and broadband, arguing it was their only leverage for keeping people like Manchin at the table.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now, these lawmakers are taking an I-told-you-so stance.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“No one can really be promised a Manchin vote,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” adding that fellow Democrats had been “strung along” by the senator.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) tried to project optimism Monday during an event in her hometown of San Francisco, noting that Democrats have to keep trying to find a way forward.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Talks have begun on narrowing the scope of the roughly $2 trillion proposal in hopes of preventing a complete failure — and a list of broken promises to voters.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Manchin’s private offer to Biden included pre-K, climate money, Obamacare — but excluded child benefit</p></div>
<div><div><p>But liberal leaders said they don’t see much of a point in negotiating with Manchin, portraying him as untrustworthy and never clear about what he is willing to support.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Instead, they plan on pushing Biden to take unilateral action through executive orders.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But even if Biden were to aggressively use executive orders to implement liberal priorities, he would not be able to accomplish nearly as much as Congress could through legislation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that while Biden is not hesitant to use the presidential power, “the benefit of legislation is obviously it makes it permanent.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>She added that liberals should not lose faith in the negotiations, telling reporters the president’s message to them is, “We need to work together to get this done, and he’s going to work like hell to get it done.”</p></div>
<div><p>Democratic bitterness, rage follow Manchin’s ‘no’ on Biden bill</p></div>
<div><div><p>Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Monday that the Senate would vote on the bill.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Neither that delay, nor other recent pronouncements, will deter us from continuing to try to find a way forward,” he wrote to his colleagues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think I still represent the centrist wing of a Democratic Party that has compassion but also has reasonability,” he said in the radio interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He also said liberals should stop pretending the party has big majorities in both chambers and can do whatever it wants.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This has nothing to do with his constituents. This is about the corruption and self-interest of a coal baron,” Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) tweeted Sunday.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Manchin cites a blind trust to justify climate votes. But much income from his family’s coal company isn’t covered.</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>But the group is also directing blame at Democratic leaders for pushing the infrastructure bill through without first passing the Build Back Better agenda.</p></div></div>
<p>Bowman echoed that sentiment and said it was time for senior Democrats to start paying more attention to members who represent voters who put Biden in the White House rather than moderates from states or districts where he is less popular.</p>
<div><div><p>Some liberals who went along with the plan to pass the infrastructure bill, counting on Biden to deliver on their priorities, said they still have hope.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Manchin's private offer to Biden included pre-K and climate funds but would have cut expanded child tax credit</p></div>
<div><p>Inflation pinch challenges Biden agenda</p></div>
<div><div><p>That left uncomfortable choices on Democrats’ horizon. Would they have to slash their plans to expand Medicare benefits to cover hearing or eliminate their proposal to invest billions in affordable housing?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Could they afford to provide seniors and people with disabilities with home-based care while at the same time pursuing the fuller spectrum of child-care spending that they would like?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And how might they seek any extension of the federal program that provides monthly payments to millions of Americans with children, given Manchin’s opposition to the idea and the spending it would entail?</p></div></div>
<div><p>Manchin says he 'cannot vote' for $2 trillion spending package</p></div>
<p>With the legislative process sputtering back to life, the discussions only affirmed what has been obvious to some Democrats for months: The $2 trillion bill that they once hoped to adopt by Christmas was never going to become the law of the land.</p>
<div><div><p>But Democrats’ initial blinding rage began to subside by Tuesday, as they all returned to work on a bill that may determine the fate of their majority in the next election.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Liberal lawmakers don't want to talk about scaling back their ambitions because of Sen. Manchin</p></div>

<div><p><span>The child tax credits are ending. Some families say they will face hardships without them.</span></p></div>

<div><div><p>“If I had gotten elected in my 30s like so many of the White folks did, I may have retired by now, but I didn’t get to until my 50s because the laws worked against me,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hoyer’s office declined to comment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Once more unto the breach: Pelosi strives to deliver an agenda that has divided her caucus, testing her power</p></div>
<div><div><p>The focus on diversity as a key attribute for the leadership team helps cement Jeffries as the front-runner to lead Democrats into the new era.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” last month whether he had heard the rumors that he could replace Pelosi, Jeffries laughed and politely said, “It’s an honor to be able to chair the [Democratic] caucus.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>But members of the Squad do not appear to be overly focused on the potential changing of the guard atop the party.</p></div></div>

<p>“He’s brilliant, he’s smooth, but he is fearless,” said a member supportive of Jeffries. “I mean, if we are fighting for something, I want Hakeem Jeffries on my side because he will go to the mat on an issue.”</p>
<div><div><p>“This is no time to speculate on future leadership elections,” Kathryn Alexander, Clark’s communications director, said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Rep. Jayapal has emerged as a forceful leader of House liberals</span></p></div>
<div><p>Aguilar, who serves as the Democratic caucus vice chair, has told members close to him that he hopes to run for the third spot in leadership, which could be majority whip or caucus chairman depending on whether Democrats keep the House.</p></div>
<div><div><p>There are other possible candidates just now mulling what they should do.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jayapal has gained prominence this year for maintaining cohesion among members of the progressive caucus, which gave it more clout in negotiations with leadership over Biden’s agenda.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Numerous members noted that they had either been reached out to by or heard that Reps. David N. Cicilline (R.I.), Debbie Dingell (Mich.), Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) and Schiff are interested in top spots.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All members interviewed agreed that Pelosi will be hard to replace, but some said that may be an opportunity as much as a problem.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>During his speech, even McCarthy acknowledged the outcome.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t know that this speech is going to make a difference,” McCarthy said just after 3 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><p>House readies Friday vote on spending package after GOP’s McCarthy delays process late into the night</p></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, a long policy debate on legislation aimed at reshaping programs ranging from child care to vision benefits for the elderly devolved into a mutual show of utter disdain.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just a few years ago, when he was a lieutenant in GOP leadership circles, McCarthy was the jovial one who built friendships with many Democrats in the House gym and on bike rides across the capital region.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pelosi’s office blasted an email to reporters with the subject header “Is Kevin McCarthy OK?” that compiled other biting tweets about the Republican leader’s “meandering rant.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Speaking Friday morning, Pelosi touted the bill, but her most appreciated words seemed to be, “As a courtesy to my colleagues, I will be brief.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Later, at a Capitol news conference after the bill’s passage, she told reporters she had not listened to McCarthy’s remarks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki did not hesitate to offer her take on McCarthy’s speech when asked about it during her daily briefing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump, meanwhile, offered praise for McCarthy in a statement Friday, saying he had done a “great job” in speaking “to properly oppose Communism.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An hour later, Democrats kept walking out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re leaving you, Kevin,” one Democrat yelled as a handful, from a boisterous Democratic corner of the chamber, departed, having grown tired of his speechifying.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m okay. I’ll be here,” McCarthy shot back at Democrats for the dozenth time that evening.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For how long?” one Democrat shouted across the aisle, exasperated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The second-biggest program in the Democrats’ spending plan gives billions to the rich</p></div>
<div><div><p>Some of his claims wildly defied the facts, but they all dripped with disdain for Democrats and their agenda.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republicans sitting behind McCarthy broke into applause as he railed against “one-party rule for one year” and claimed that Thanksgiving next week would cost “more than it ever has.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s all right. I got all night,” McCarthy said before announcing he was planning to dissect the 2,000-page bill section by section.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Several Democrats shouted back, “So do we!” One Democratic woman said, “We’ve been waiting for this a long time.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The sneers continued. When the snickering and whispers grew too loud, McCarthy would often look at the presiding speaker, Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), and inform him that “the House is not in order.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The more McCarthy requested he slam down the gavel to corral Democrats’ attention, the less quickly Aguilar would indulge him.</p></div></div>

<p>As Democrats began to laugh and chat among themselves, an irritated McCarthy, having talked already for roughly 45 minutes, taunted Democrats by reminding them that Pelosi may soon kick them off their committees, given that she values decorum.</p>
<div><div><p>McCarthy also used his time to speculate when Pelosi would step down as the top Democrat, musing that she probably would not stick around too much longer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Yeah she will,” Beatty shot back.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I want her to hand that gavel to me,” said McCarthy, who hopes to be speaker if Republicans take back control of the House in the next Congress.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>No vote, she told them, would be held at that late — or early — an hour.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He wants to do it in the dead of night,” Hoyer told reporters a few minutes later regarding the timing of the vote. “We are going to do it in the day.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hoyer slated the House to return to session Friday at 8 a.m., at which point Democrats hope to finish the final minutes of debate and hold a vote to pass the ambitious legislation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But nothing could be done to stop McCarthy, who looked at the near-empty Democratic side of the aisle, and a quickly thinning crowd of Republicans behind him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t know if they think because they left I’m going to stop,” McCarthy said. “I’m not.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He ticked through several amendments, breezing past Pelosi’s 8 hour, 7 minute record for the longest speech, before finally looking around to ask if he had secured his spot in House history.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You broke the record,” Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) exclaimed as the Republican side of the chamber erupted in cheers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In reflection, McCarthy noted how his 8 hour, 32 minute-speech garnered good reactions and bad, but said he never expected a Democrat telling him how to act on the House floor.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Don Young is the rare Republican who’s not afraid of Trump — or of saying he needs to ‘shut up’</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paul Kane</div></div>Reporter </span></div></span></div><div>December 2, 2021 at 1:30 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Don Young knew the call would not end well, as the Alaska Republican forcefully rejected Donald Trump’s plea to oppose the more than $1 trillion infrastructure legislation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>How did the former president take the news?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Not well,” Young recalled, but there wasn’t any shouting. “No, no, no, no, no.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Young, 88, the longest-serving member of Congress, thought about all the contradictions he saw in Trump, particularly the chaotic style that made him a politically toxic figure.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think his policy is just so good,” Young said during a 45-minute interview this week. “Just shut up — that’s all he has to do. He’s not going to. I know that.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tensions rise among Republicans over infrastructure bill and whether any agreement with Biden should be tolerated</p></div>
<div><p>Yet during his decades-long career, Young has already defeated the FBI, both congressional ethics committees, the <a>coronavirus</a> and every political challenger since his 1972 loss to a congressman who was probably dead at the time.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He has gone from being a powerful chairman of two committees to an outsider who sits — literally every day Congress is in session — on the very back bench of the House chamber.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I know where to go to get drinks when you’re in the middle of the desert,” Young said, “and most of us, they die of thirst. So I believe I’m good at what I do.”</p></div></div>
<p>These actions make him an outlier in the Trump era, when most Republicans bend over backward not to anger the former president, particularly when Trump and his allies are promising to support GOP primary challengers against anyone deemed disloyal.</p>
<div><p>Trump issued a statement Saturday calling for “good and SMART America First Republican Patriots to run primary campaigns against Representatives Tom Rice, John Katko, Don Bacon, Don Young, Fred Upton” and several others.</p></div>
<div><div><p>All told, Trump highlighted 11 Republicans who had taken some action of betrayal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If they want to campaign against me, have at it,” Young said with a laugh.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trust is a key ingredient in ‘functional institutions’ — and Congress is fresh out of it</p></div>
<div><div><p>And, yes, former House speaker John A. Boehner told the truth in his memoir, “<a>On the House</a>.” Young once pulled a knife on him over a dispute about pork-barrel projects.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This part right here” he said. “If I hit you with that, I mean, you’re going down. I don’t have to cut you. That’s just like being hit with a baton.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He got 412 votes, with just eight opposing, for the final version of the bill.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But those big-spending days also put Young in the investigative crosshairs. Federal prosecutors brought cases against several close allies in Alaska and pored over his record of delivering projects for those that helped him politically.</p></div>
<a>House Ethics Committee </a>undertook a long probe of allegations that he misspent political funds for personal use, ending with a fine.
<div><div><p>But Young was unbeatable.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In 2008 Alaska’s lieutenant governor, Sean Parnell, challenged Young in the primary. The incumbent narrowly won — in a much closer race than the one in 1980, when Young thumped Parnell’s father, who was a Democrat.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Last year <a>Democrats poured millions into the race</a> against Young, believing that he was finally vulnerable. He won by almost 10 percentage points.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of his already-announced 2022 opponents is Nick Begich III, the Republican grandson of Nick Begich, who was a Democratic congressman in 1972 when a plane carrying him and the House majority leader went missing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Democrats worry whether voters are getting what they wanted out of a Biden presidency</p></div>
<div><div><p>Begich, who was not officially pronounced dead for decades, defeated Young in the 1972 race, but the following year Young won the special election to succeed him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Young is dismissive of the rabble-rousers in the GOP caucus who are talking about blocking Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) from ascending to House speaker if Republicans win the majority.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But his lingering health issue now is a back problem that came from a horse accident when he was a teen, sometimes making it difficult to walk.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He talks about “God’s will and the people’s will” for next year’s campaign, when he will be 89, promising that if he loses, he’s still going to have fun.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ll get an airplane. Someone can fly it for me,” Young said. “And we’ll land on lakes and catch fish and have a hell of a good time.”</p></div></div>
