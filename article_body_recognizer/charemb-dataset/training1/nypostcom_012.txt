<p>Catherine’s program also recommends setting up a “speed bump” to force you to think before engaging with your phone.</p>
<p>Writer Kevin Roose put a rubber band around his device and changed his lockscreen to show three questions: “What for?” “Why now?” and “What else?”</p>
<p>You could put this on a piece of paper under the rubber band.</p>
<p>Before we became so reliant on our phones for everything, we used to write down lists on paper.</p>
<p>Get a calendar to jot down plans and reminders, start writing your shopping list on a pad and choose actual books instead of electronic versions. It all helps cut down on screen time.</p>
<h2>Set a scrolling window</h2>
<p>If you find you are constantly reaching for your phone, set yourself specific times of the day when you are allowed a few minutes of screen time.</p>
<h2>Keep tabs on your time</h2>
<p>You can find out how much time you are spending on your phone in “Settings”.If the amount horrifies you, aim to reduce it slowly.</p>
<p>You could start by cutting it down by 20 minutes a day, or challenge yourself to halve it over the course of a week.</p>
<p>You could set time limits on your phone, not just for total screen time but for individual apps as well.</p>
<p>Don’t use your phone at mealtimes, even if you are alone.</p>
<p>And don’t take it with you into the bathroom.</p>
<p>Research shows countless germs are spread up to 6ft around a bathroom from a single flush of the toilet with the lid open. Now think of those germs on your phone, which you put next to your face . . . </p>
<p>Instead of getting frustrated with predictive text or ending up in a ten-minute messaging thread, why not spend that time actually talking to them and hearing their voice?</p>
<p>A study at the University of Texas revealed people feel more connected when they speak on the phone, instead of messaging.</p>
<p>Plenty of us turn to our phones for a few minutes of distraction with a game or a puzzle.</p>
<p>Instead, get yourself a puzzle book and stretch those grey cells using that.</p>

<h1> ATT, Verizon change 5G rollout plans after airlines protest</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 4:13pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:14pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>ATT and Verizon said Tuesday they would alter their planned rollout of 5G service to avoid airports after US airline CEOs warned the deployment could have “catastrophic” consequences for travel.</p>
<p>The companies changed their plans for the 5G deployment, which was set to take place Wednesday, after the airline executives demanded the Biden administration intervene in the dispute.</p>
<p>“We are launching our advanced 5G services everywhere else as planned with the temporary exception of this limited number of towers,” the statement added.</p>
<p>Verizon said it also planned to launch its 5G network as planned Wednesday, but noted it has “voluntarily decided to limit our 5G network around airports.”</p>
<p>Aviation officials have expressed concern that the rollout of 5G C-band networks could cause safety issues by interfering with sensitive aircraft equipment, including instruments that measure altitude on some planes.</p>
<p>In their letter, the airlines requested for 5G networks “to be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate 2 miles of airport runways at affected airports as defined by the FAA.”</p>
<p>The White House said it was working to achieve a resolution to the dispute.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to reaching a solution around 5G,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday.</p>

<h1> Adidas serves up floating tennis court in Great Barrier Reef</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 4:38pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:38pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Adidas is building a giant, floating tennis court just off the coast of Australia — and it says it’s trying to raise awareness of pollution in the oceans by doing so.</p>
<p>True to its message promoting cleaner oceans, the court was built using recyclable plastic materials. It was then donated to a local school.</p>
<p>Adidas has put its brand name behind a campaign to end the dumping of plastic waste in the oceans.</p>
<p>To attract publicity for the eco-friendly tennis court, the company trotted out Australian Olympic stars Ian Thorpe and Jessica Fox.</p>
<p>“By 2050, there will be more plastic than fish in our oceans,” Thorpe said. </p>
<p>“It’s a problem that has reached unfathomable proportions.”</p>
<p>Adidas has also pledged to manufacture products using eco-friendly means. The company says it will eliminate virgin polyester from production by 2024.</p>
<p>A favorite of sports apparel brands, polyester gives fabrics greater elasticity and absorbs less moisture, making it easy to wear for athletes. </p>
<p>But polyester is sourced from petroleum and is not biodegradable.</p>
<p>Adidas has pledged to use recyclable materials for 90% of its apparel lines by the year 2025, according to Elle.</p>
<p>Since 2019, <a>Adidas has manufactured tens of millions of pairs of sneakers</a> using recycled plastic recovered from the ocean.</p>
<p>It has also vowed to reduce its carbon footprint by 30% by the year 2030.</p>
<p><a>Adidas’ rivals in the apparel space</a> have also vowed to move toward sustainability in marketing their products.</p>
<p>Nike has rolled out Nike Grind, an initiative inviting customers to return their old and used Nike shoes so that the material can be recycled and repurposed into other products.</p>
<h1> Twitter posts celebs’ inspirational tweets on billboards</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 5:53pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 5:57pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Twitter wants to inspire the masses with a billboard ad campaign featuring tweets from celebrity athletes and entertainers who made their dreams a reality.</p>
<p>The tech giant on Tuesday rolled out the “manifestation” ad campaign in eight locations across the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>It includes old tweets from 12 athletes and celebrities including singers Demi Lovato and Megan Thee Stallion; <a>Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes</a>; NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace; and X Factor winner Niall Horan. </p>
<p>The real-life tweets that were posted before they hit stardom are superimposed on images featuring the celebrities “who manifested their dreams.”</p>
<p>The ad campaign is part of a charitable endeavor in which Twitter will donate $1 million to nonprofits on behalf of the stars, including Boys and Girls Club, Destination Crenshaw, The 3-D Foundation, and UNICEF Canada.</p>
<p>“When I grow up, I want to be a more successful version of me,” Issa Rae tweeted back in 2010.</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 5</div> </div> </div>
<p>Rae eventually achieved stardom for her work on the YouTube web series Awkward Black Girl and years later on the HBO series Insecure.</p>
<p>“I need a team bc I promise rap gone take off for me,” Megan Thee Stallion tweeted in 2014. Four years later, her rap videos went viral on social media, leading to a bestselling studio album.</p>
<p>Another billboard features Matthew A. Cherry, the former football player and Oscar winner who tweeted in June 2012: “I’m gonna be nominated for an Oscar one day. Already claimin it.”</p>
<p>Cherry won the Academy Award for the short film Hair Love in 2020.</p>
<p>Lovato correctly predicted in a tweet from 2010 that “one day, I’m going to sing the national anthem at a super bowl.”</p>
<p>She performed the Star Spangled Banner before kickoff of Super Bowl LIV at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami in February 2020.</p>

<h1> Manhattan hot spots offer devilishly deep discounts to lure cocktail lovers in January</h1>

<div> January 18, 2022 8:09pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 8:10pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>January is always the slowest month of the year for the city’s bars and restaurants – and the omicron variant that’s washed over the city means 2022 is even worse than usual.</p>
<p>According to the latest poll from the Independent Restaurant Coalition, sales at restaurants decreased at nearly all outlets across the country last month – at 98% of those that responded. </p>
<p>And sales dropped by at least half compared to the same time last year at 58% of the 1,169 restaurants polled. </p>
<p>Some of those restaurants say they’re in danger of closing, the national coalition says, but some others aren’t taking the January blues without putting up a fight – and a drink special.</p>
<p>Anton’s Cafe and Wine Bar in the West Village, for example, is offering 25 cent Manhattans and martinis for lunch customers on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays throughout January. </p>
<p>Co-owner Nick Anderer made the announcement on his Instagram account and over the weekend, the charming café across from the legendary White Horse Tavern on Hudson Street was all abuzz about the weekday deal. </p>
<p>“There’s a two-limit drink order per person, but of course that’s not stopping anyone from ordering a third at regular price,” a staffer quipped, as Side Dish tucked into a perfectly prepared herb omelet. </p>
<p>And while the old-school restaurant has not become a scene of over-the-top inebriated daytime antics, lunch reservations are now full – even with a waitlist, a staffer said.</p>
<p>“We wanted to create a fun New York moment by borrowing a classic New Orleans tradition,” Anderer told Side Dish. </p>
<p>In the meantime, other Big Apple restaurants are also launching creative cocktail draws in hopes of tempting the sometimes-sleepy winter crowds.</p>
<p>“There are happy hours and bottomless brunches, but we thought this would be a fun way to incentivize people to come back,” he said. </p>
<p>The special deal kicked off on Jan. 15 and runs Tuesdays through Saturdays, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. (during sunset hours) until the end of February. </p>
<p>“We’re lucky to be able to experience an incredible Manhattan sunset every evening at Daintree,” said Tom Rowse, marketing manager of Parched Hospitality Group.</p>
<p>“The sun goes down early in winter, and we wanted to provide something to look forward to — oysters and a cocktail from this stunning vantage point,” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, hospitality industry bigs are trying to persuade New York lawmakers to make permanent the “to-go” cocktails that <a>Gov. Kathy Hochul has thrown her support behind making permanent</a>.</p>
<p>The popular program that launched under emergency powers of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo during lockdown has become a vital source of income to the industry and a way to raise the spirits of many New Yorkers stuck at home. </p>
<p>Mayor Eric Adams says he supports the return of to-go cocktails. But liquor laws are controlled by the state. </p>
<p>Legislation still needs to be introduced, to go through the legislative process, to get passed and to get signed into law by the governor, says Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance. </p>

<h2>H’wood remakes get redux</h2>
<p>So who else is in this one? Andrew Saffir — who does all the bigtime movie screenings — answered: “I don’t know. I only know Boris Karloff isn’t.”</p>
<p>More. Gary Oldman, who’s jazzed up a crate of Harry Potter movies: “I met the cast as kids. Now some are married. Grown up.” Yeah, but still has fans.</p>
<p>“Return to Hogwarts” — Harry Potter’s 20th Anniversary — is casting a spell on HBO Max.</p>
<p>Coppola: “It dealt with invasion of privacy and its erosive impact on victims and perpetrators. I conceived it 50 years ago. The idea still resonates today.”</p>
<p>“Convo” got three Oscar nominations but lost. Winner that year was “Godfather II.” Also, in case you missed it, that was also Coppola.</p>
<h2>His supper cost a song</h2>
<p>Don’t go anywhere. I got more. Jackie Gleason’s TV cash register <a>“The Honeymooners.” </a>Coming back to CBS in a female-driven remake. Lady writer. Lady director.</p>
<p>Understand, Gleason was then TV’s No. 1 comedy star. Earning millions. ”Honeymooners,” his weekly show, on for years, was the big number.</p>
<p>In those days, before credit cards, guys had access to cash. No questions asked, Joey peeled off $3,000. That very night we all had dinner together in a restaurant. Gleason blew the whole $3,000 on hiring a band to serenade Joey.</p>

<p>Minnelli, 75, remembered her late mother and father, Vincente Minnelli, and how Garland helped Liza overcome her stage anxiety.</p>
<p>Garland and Vincente, star and director of “Meet Me in St. Louis,” married in 1945 and divorced in 1951. Garland died in 1969 at age 47 from an accidental barbiturate overdose.</p>
<p>EGOT winner Minnelli sat down with “CBS Sunday Morning” alongside her friend Michael Feinstein and looked back on her time in the spotlight.</p>
<p>“I thought my mother was perfect, perfect,” Minnelli said. “Every little thing she did. But my father – there was no one in the world like my father, and I’m so much like him.”</p>
<p>The “Cabaret” star recalled that in November 1964, she performed alongside her mother at the London Palladium when she was just a teenager. Minnelli had some stage fright and Garland helped her through.</p>
<p>After Garland’s death, it was tenor singer Charles Aznavour who taught her how to hone her musical skills.</p>
<p>Aznavour was also the one who taught Minnelli the famous jazz hands move for her Oscar-winning turn in the <a>Bob Fosse musical “Cabaret.”</a></p>
<p>In the interview, Minnelli even gives viewers a sweet taste of her voice, performing a quick tune by George and Ira Gershwin, with Feinstein on piano.</p>
<p>Minnelli explained that while she doesn’t perform so much in public anymore, she still loves to. </p>
<h1> Jessica Chastain’s rough upbringing gave her ‘a lot of resentment’</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 2:38pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 3:48pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Jessica Chastain’s childhood struggle was real.</p>
<p>The star of “The Eyes of Tammy Faye,” 44, recalled her troubled upbringing and how it made her a stronger person today. </p>
<p>“When people see me, I think they expect a different background than I have,” the Northern California native recently told the Times. </p>
<p>Chastain grew up with four siblings and a single mom. She was the product of a teenage pregnancy, and her family often encountered financial hardships. </p>
<p>She wanted to pursue her passion for acting and had to work at a performing arts school in order to take classes there since “there was no way my family could afford it.” </p>
<p>“There were people that saw I was struggling as a kid, and they helped me,” she added. “And that’s why I ended up where I am now.”</p>
<a> two kids</a> with husband Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo.
<p>She previously opened up to the <a>Irish Times</a> in 2017regarding her “very difficult upbringing,” adding, “I did grow up with a single mother who worked very hard to put food on our table. We did not have money.”</p>

<h1> ‘Matrix Resurrections’ revolution: Inside the franchise’s sprawling influence</h1>

<p>In 1999, Keanu Reeves chose the red pill to go down the rabbit hole — and modern cinema and pop culture would never be the same. </p>
<p>Even in the landscape of that unforgettable year in film, “The Matrix” was a wholly unique blend of cyberpunk sci-fi, superhero thriller and mind-bending existential drama. </p>
<p>The subsequent chapters of the franchise that would follow in 2003, “The Matrix Reloaded” and “The Matrix Revolutions,” expanded the Wachowskis’ vision, though neither lived up to the promise of the original. </p>
<p>But hope springs eternal. So ahead of the release of the latest installment, “Resurrections,” in theaters and on HBO Max on Dec. 22, we look at the sprawling influence matrix of “The Matrix.” </p>

<h1> Delta posts $408M loss as 8,000 workers test positive for COVID-19</h1>
<div> January 13, 2022 10:45am <div> Updated <div> January 13, 2022 10:45am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Delta Air Lines posted a net loss of $408 million in its final quarter of 2021 and warned of upcoming challenges as the Omicron variant drives a surge of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>The airline canceled more than 2,000 flights since Christmas Eve due to worker shortages and bad winter weather, CEO Ed Bastian said. Approximately 8,000 employees tested positive for COVID-19 over the last four weeks.</p>
<p>In total, US airlines have canceled more than 31,300 flights since Dec. 24 according to tracking data from FlightAware. The total amounted to about 7% of their planned schedules over that period.</p>
<p>Delta cited higher costs from fuel and Omicron-related disruptions in its fourth quarter results. Shares rose 3% in early trading.</p>
<p>Executives expect the airline to post another loss in its first fiscal quarter of 2022 as Omicron saps travel demand in January and February. Despite the setback, Delta expects to achieve profitability for the full year, according to CFO Dan Janki.</p>
<p>“Despite expectations for a loss in the March quarter, we remain positioned to generate a healthy profit in the June, September and December quarters, resulting in a meaningful profit in 2022,” Janki said.</p>
<p>Delta’s fourth-quarter results topped Wall Street’s expectations. Adjusted earnings per share was 22 cents, topping an expected 14 cents. Quarterly revenue was $9.47 billion, beating a projected $9.21 billion.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, Delta projected its total revenue will be 72% to 76% of what it was in the same quarter prior to the pandemic. Flight capacities will be an estimated 83% to 85% of pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<h1> Adidas reportedly planning to sell Reebok amid COVID-19 struggles</h1>

<p>Adidas is looking to sell its struggling Reebok business after holding onto the American sneaker brand for more than a decade, reports said Thursday.</p>
<p>The German sportswear giant has set up an internal team to pursue the sale and aims to close a deal by March of next year, when CEO Kasper Rorsted plans to present a five-year strategy for Adidas, according to Germany’s Manager Magazin.</p>
<p>But an internal review of whether to dump Reebok is still in its early stages, and Adidas will decide in the coming months whether to move forward with a sale, Bloomberg News reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>An Adidas spokesperson said the company does not comment on “market rumors.” The reports sent its Frankfurt-listed stock price up as much as 3.5 percent Thursday to 284.20 euros ($335.97).</p>
<a>Adidas has said</a>. Its revenues plunged 42 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 33 percent drop in Adidas’s overall sales.

<h1> Patrick Mahomes, Chiefs rout Steelers in Ben Roethlisberger’s likely last game</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 12:03am <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 12:45am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Byron Pringle caught touchdown passes from both Mahomes and Kelce, and Jerick McKinnon and Tyreek Hill also reeled in scoring catches as the Chiefs (13-5) began their pursuit of a third straight AFC championship in fine style.</p>
<p>They scored on six straight possessions during the middle part of the game, shut down Roethlisberger and the rest of the Pittsburgh offense, and turned next Sunday night’s divisional-round game against Buffalo into appointment viewing.</p>
<p>The Bills had a similarly easy time with their 47-17 victory over New England on Saturday. Buffalo and Kansas City met for the AFC title last season that Kansas City won before falling to Tampa Bay in the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Judging by the final score, you’d never guess the first quarter was all about defense: The Steelers ran 14 plays and went 12 yards, while the Chiefs had more punt return yards (70) than they had from scrimmage (62).</p>
<p>Made sense that the first points would be scored on defense, too.</p>
<p>The play must have awakened Mahomes, who earlier had thrown his first pick in six career home playoff games.</p>
<p>Or maybe it just made Mahomes angry.</p>
<p>In the span of less than six minutes, Mahomes and the Chiefs had turned a seven-point deficit into a 21-7 lead.</p>
<p>It wasn’t quite the 23-0 halftime advantage the Chiefs had in their December blowout of the Steelers, but it sure felt that way. Roethlisberger was 5 of 14 for 24 yards in the first half and Pittsburgh had 55 yards total offense.</p>
<p>Not much of a retirement party if Roethlisberger indeed calls it quits.</p>
<p>Hill got his TD catch eventually; it came after Steelers rookie Najee Harris lost a fumble for the first time all season.</p>
<p>Mahomes and the rest of the Chiefs had provided enough of their own.</p>
<h1> Gov. Hochul to bring back NY’s controversial ‘drinks-to-go’ initiative</h1>
<div> January 5, 2022 2:34pm <div> Updated <div> January 5, 2022 3:11pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Cheers! Booze on the run is making a comeback.</p>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul said Wednesday that she’ll reinstate the state’s popular “Drinks-to-Go” initiative, which allowed bars and restaurants to sell adult beverages for takeout.</p>
<p>In her first state of the state address, Hochul said the move is necessary to help struggling businesses during the surge of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>“To help offset these costs we’ll provide a tax credit for COVID-related purchases like outdoor heating and seating,” the governor said.</p>
<p>Selling drinks on the run was a popular alternative for bars and eateries during the height of the pandemic last year, allowing them to stay in business despite having to shut down dining rooms and indoor dining areas.</p>
<p>The state quietly extended the practice in March, but state lawmakers let a proposed renewal lapse in June, shutting down takeout drink operations.</p>
<p>“It sucks,” Scott Wexler, executive director of the Empire State Restaurant and Tavern Association, said at the time.</p>
<p>“Glad we’re moving past the crisis, but the failure of the Assembly and Senate to provide real help to restaurants and taverns means we face recovery with one hand tied behind our back.”</p>
<p>Polls showed that <a>nearly 80 percent of New Yorkers</a> favored the practice.</p>
<p>Lisa Hawkins, spokesperson for the Distilled Spirits Council, praised Hochul for again allowing to-go drinks.</p>
<p>The New York Restaurant Association also chimed in, saying it was “thrilled” by the move.</p>
<p>“Governor Hochul has listened to New Yorkers, and we will fight with her to allow alcoholic beverages with takeout and delivery,” association President and CEO Melissa Fleischut said in a statement. </p>

<div> January 18, 2022 1:49pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 1:49pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission and a group of states including New York, Tennessee and North Carolina have reportedly launched an investigation into Meta’s Oculus unit.</p>
<p>Representatives for the FTC and North Carolina attorney general declined to comment. Meta and the New York and Tennessee attorneys general did not immediately return FOX Business’ request for comment. </p>
<p>Meta, who bought Oculus in 2014 for $2 billion, sells the Oculus Quest 2 headset for $299. Oculus receives a 30% cut from developers on its app store, according to its developer agreement. </p>
<p>Reality Labs head Andrew Bosworth noted in an October Facebook post that the Oculus Quest and Oculus Quest App would be rebranded to the Meta Quest and Meta Quest App in early 2022.</p>

<p>Remote learning has been a failure for low-income kids relying on faulty laptops and iPads from the city Department of Education — which offered no technical support to the struggling families, according to a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Five parents, who say they’re too poor to pay for high-speed Internet or quality computers for their kids, claim in the court papers their children have been academically left behind when they were forced to use the malfunctioning equipment.</p>
<p>Some of the children whose parents are fighting in court did not receive any devices for months into remote learning, according to the court papers. </p>
<p>One mom of three, identified only as S.M. in court papers, said when her kids’ devices finally did show up, they couldn’t access the Internet. </p>
<p>Other families in the suit said they were falsely told Internet companies would connect the laptops and iPads online for free — only to be asked to pay monthly fees they couldn’t afford.</p>
<p>Even with the city sticking to in-person learning in the 2021-2022 school year, remote classes — such as for some snow days, or Election Day — have now been baked into the academic calendar, the anonymous parents said in court papers. </p>
<p>“Many students continue to struggle with device and Internet issues on this day,” according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The city also has no system to repair or replace broken equipment, the parents charge. </p>
<p>The families behind the lawsuit still “have devices that are inadequate,” said Legal Services NYC spokesman Seth Hoy.</p>
<p>“Our clients continue to pay out of pocket for internet service they cannot afford, and their children have not received education services that compensate for their lost education during remote learning days,” he added.</p>
<p>“There are no outstanding device requests at this time,” said spokeswoman Sarah Casasnovas, who said the DOE will review the lawsuit. “Families can continue to request one if they need.”</p>

<h1> Why rebooting ‘The Honeymooners’ is a crappy idea</h1>

<p>So here we go again, from the sublime to the ridiculous — TV-style.</p>
<p>Just as we’re getting psyched for WPIX/Ch. 11’s annual New Year’s Eve marathon of “The Honeymooners,” falling on the 60th anniversary of its swan song, comes word that CBS will reboot the series.</p>
<p>Somewhere, Ralph Kramden hears this news — face contorting, eyes popping — bellows like a stricken cow and pirouettes into one of his fainting swoons.</p>
<p>(OK, so the show’s ratings trailed off in Season 1 before it found new life in syndication. But still.)</p>
<p>So what’s the point in trying this exercise again?</p>
<p>That’s wrong on so many levels.</p>
<p>Just wait until O’Connor, up in TV heaven, hears they’re remaking his iconic gem — and blows one of Archie’s trademark raspberries.</p>

<h1> Gov. Hochul proposes massive $216B budget fueled by COVID relief</h1>

<div> January 18, 2022 12:16pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 12:33pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul proposed a $216 billion budget plan Tuesday that leans on billions in federal COVID-19 relief and revenue from tax hikes on the wealthy enacted by her predecessor.</p>
<p>It includes a hefty 7 percent, or $2.1 billion, boost in education spending and provides $1.2 billion in bonuses to nurses and other health care workers to address a staffing shortage during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Hochul, who is running to keep the governor’s seat, benefited from being able to access billions of dollars in COVID-19 federal emergency funding sent to the state over the past two years.</p>
<p>Revenues to the state treasury also bulged from increased income taxes on wealthy New Yorkers and businesses <a>approved by the </a>legislature and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo last year.</p>
<p>The overall budget, which includes federal funds, is $4 billion higher than last year.</p>
<p>The budget includes $2.2 billion for property tax relief and $2 billion for pandemic recovery initiatives. She would accelerate scheduled income taxes cuts for middle- and lower-income earners.</p>
<p>The budget includes a $1 billion health care transformation fund.</p>
<p>There’s $350 million in pandemic relief to aid impacted businesses and theater and musical arts venues.</p>
<p>Many of the proposals were first laid out in her recent state of the state address.</p>
<h1> Heed the pleas of the subway-shover’s sister: Stop letting the severely mentally ill roam loose and untreated</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 7:58pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 7:58pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Even if you don’t have a loved one plagued by mental illness who refuses to get help, you have to feel for Josette Simon, the sister of the man known as Simon Martial, 61, who has admitted to the horrific Times Square murder of Michelle Go.</p>
<p>“I remember begging one of the hospitals, ‘Let him stay,’ because once he’s out, he didn’t want to take medication, and it was the medication that kept him going,” Josette, 65, told The Post.</p>
<p>“There was nothing I could do,” she weeps. “And they let him out in the street.</p>
<p>He did state prison time after robbery and attempted robbery convictions. “Get him some help,” she pleads. “I’m not saying let him out, but get him some help.”</p>
<p>“It’s not only my brother,” she warns. “I don’t think enough people look at mental illness like a disease, like cancer, AIDS or anything else. It’s an illness.”</p>
<p>An illness that requires the authorities to act — not to leave these unfortunates roaming the streets and subways, some of them ticking time bombs.</p>
<a>called on Mayor Eric Adams</a> to move now to change the city’s approach. And state lawmakers should be expanding Kendra’s Law; instead, self-appointed “advocates” make it a political struggle even to renew it every few years.
<p>It’s long past time for the public to tell the advocates to shove it, so we can start getting the severely mentally ill the help they need — and protecting the public from them.</p>

<p>Running time: 126 minutes. Rated R (violence and pervasive language.) In select theaters and on HBO Max.</p>
<p>However, the stark final words on-screen in director Shaka King’s movie don’t give you the warm fuzzies — they knock you flat on the floor. </p>
<p>O’Neal, while deceitful and selfishly motivated, just wants his felony charges dropped. He never predicted the scheme to clear his name would escalate to murder and result in him becoming forever marked a traitor to the cause. </p>
<p>In one of the film’s most rousing sections, Hampton hollers, “I am a revolutionary!” to the crowd, and, captivated, they roar the message back at him. If Kaluuya starts a cult called the Danielites, sign me up.</p>
<p>Particularly insightful is his offstage persona as he woos his eventual fiancée Deborah Johnson (Dominique Fishback): quiet and bashful, just a regular guy. Being a leader, at times, means being a good actor. </p>

<p>Before there was Page Six Sean, there was Page Six Ron.</p>
<p>But there’s one story Rangers great Ron Duguay had never shared before, now revealing for the first time how he ended up in Gene Simmons’ bed with Cher after a night out at Studio 54.</p>
<p>“This is gonna be an exclusive thing because I’ve never been a kiss-and-tell type of guy,” Duguay said on the debut episode of “Up In The Blue Seats,” The Post’s New York Rangers podcast.</p>
<p>The moment Duguay references was captured perfectly by The Post’s Vernon Shibla at Studio 54, Cher resting her head on Duguay’s right shoulder with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>The two then went back to Minnelli’s table, where she said she and her husband were going back to their house. “C’mon, we’re going,” Cher told Duguay.</p>
<p>They were sitting in the lobby of Minnelli’s apartment building, waiting roughly 30 minutes for her arrival before Cher began to get angry. She had enough, so she and Duguay got in a taxi.</p>
<p>“Where are we going?” Duguay asked.</p>
<p>“Just come with me, son,” Cher answered.</p>
<p>“Fill in the blank,” Duguay says on the podcast. “And I said, ‘I’m happy to just be here.'”</p>
<p>Duguay looked around at the gold records on the wall of the house, but he noticed they weren’t Cher records, but rather those of KISS. Cher then told Duguay they were at Simmons’ house.</p>
<h1> Jessica Chastain could win her first Oscar for ‘Eyes of Tammy Faye’</h1>
<div> September 14, 2021 10:04pm <div> Updated <div> September 15, 2021 11:57am </div> </div> </div>
<p>TORONTO — Another title for the movie “The Eyes of Tammy Faye” could be “Behind the Mascara.”</p>
<p>Throughout the enlightening biopic about husband-and-wife televangelists Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker, which premiered Sunday at the Toronto International Film Festival, Tammy Faye’s makeup gets thicker and thicker as the years go by.</p>
<p>After a while, the cover-up, rouge and mile-long eyelashes are no longer beauty enhancements, but a protective shield against the reality of her crumbling life.</p>
<p>The garish ’80s give way to the drab, T-shirt-and-jeans ’90s and, in the end, the bronzed woman looks like… well, let’s just say she looks like somebody who has never cracked the spine of a Bible before.</p>
<p>Tammy Faye, to say the least, was one of a kind.</p>
<p>Oops. They meant “fraud is good”!</p>
<p>The “secular news media” catches up to their scheme, the facade cracks and their careers are over.</p>
<p>Tammy Faye died in 2007. Chastain’s revelation of a performance will give her new life — and the voice she never had.</p>

<h1> Sundance 2021 was the only virtual movie festival to get it right</h1>
<div> February 4, 2021 4:56pm <div> Updated <div> February 4, 2021 6:27pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Welcome to Sundance: Couch Edition!</p>
<p>The biggest surprise of the 2021 entry of this 43-year-old independent film festival was that it didn’t feel dramatically different from years past, even though it was mostly virtual due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>No other film festival in the past 12 months — Tribeca, Venice, New York or Toronto — can confidently say the same. </p>
<p>Sundance has a huge advantage over its competitors, however: mystery.</p>
<a>Hustlers</a>” premiered. At Sundance, you’re just as likely to encounter “
<a>Call Me by Your Name</a>,” a rapturous love story, as you are “Swiss Army Man,” a little-known flick in which Daniel Radcliffe pals around with a farting corpse. Every time the lights go down is a gamble.
<a>John and the Hole</a>” and the unbearable “
<a>Cryptozoo</a>.” But there was also the riveting “
<a>Mass</a>,” the life-affirming “CODA” and the mind-blowing “
<a>Misha and the Wolves</a>” — films everybody will be talking about in the coming months.
<p>OK, so the virtual indie experiment worked. Does that mean that thousands of coastal elites will stop schlepping to chilly Park City to pack into a high-school auditorium with Ethan Hawke? Doubtful. </p>
<a>were having to use risky new tactics</a> to decide what to buy for Netflix or Sony.
<a>for a record-breaking $25 million</a>.
<p>Plus, Sundance is a swimming pool full of cash for Utah. Last year, <a>the festival reported that out-of-state visitors spent $135 million</a> there over the two-week-long gathering.</p>
<p>That’s some cold comfort.</p>

<p>It’s been two hella long years since The Weeknd released his blockbuster “After Hours” album in March 2020, just after the pandemic had shut down the world.</p>
<p>So it’s no wonder that the pop superstar looks as if he’s aged decades on the cover of his new LP, “Dawn FM,” which arrived early Friday morning. The struggle has been real.</p>
<p>But “Dawn FM,” playing like a sequel of sorts to “After Hours,” is actually designed to help you emerge from the darkness into the light.</p>
<p>Clearly, <a>someone forgot to tell Omicron</a> about this “transition” we’re supposed to be having.</p>
<p>(And if you’re wondering about Carrey’s connection to The Weeknd, the two are mutual fans and neighbors in Los Angeles who struck up an unlikely friendship a couple years ago.)</p>

<h1> ‘Scream’ review: Slasher rehash is less scary than Midtown</h1>
<div> January 12, 2022 3:08am <div> Updated <div> January 12, 2022 3:08am </div> </div> </div>
<p>The fifth “Scream” movie doesn’t try to reinvent the squeal.</p>
<p>Unlike the rebooted “Halloween” and “Candyman,” which successfully dragged their franchises into the present with added social commentary, the tired teen slasher film is stuck in the past. And proud of it.</p>
<p>Though “Scream” is set in the modern day, it’s a cinematic time machine to 2000. The whole time you feel like you’re surrounded by Beanie Babies while gorging on Pizza Bagels and listening to the Backstreet Boys. </p>

<p>Running time: 116 minutes. Rated R (strong bloody violence, language throughout and some sexual references.) In theaters Friday.</p>
<p>The heroine’s backstory is a groaner. A should-be devastating development is totally unmoving. And when you think you know who is behind the Ghostface mask, you’re probably right.</p>
<p>Ah, oh, the meta jokes. They got out of control in the later sequels, and Cinq drowns in them.</p>
<p>The big gag here, for example, is to mock the recent rise of critically-acclaimed (and, um, better) horror films. </p>
<p>Can Ghostface murder me, too?</p>
<p>The rest of the story follows the worn-out old pattern.</p>
<p>And Barrera, who was wonderful in “In The Heights,” has an earnest intensity that will give her a long career. It’s fun seeing her kick ass with Neve Campbell, Cox and Arquette, whose chemistry is a sure thing at this point.</p>
<p>Yet as much as “Scream” references the aughts films and celebrates the slasher genre, it forgets the most important part — the original was actually scary.</p>

<p>“B Positive” co-star Annaleigh Ashford revisits her Broadway roots in the CBS sitcom’s new opening credits — reminiscent of a splashy musical stage number. </p>
<p>The new opening credits can vary episode-to-episode. “It gives the editors and producers a lot of variety about what they can use,” Ashford said. “There are many different versions of what we filmed.</p>

<h1> Joss Whedon said he was ‘powerless’ to avoid ‘Buffy’ affairs, denies misconduct</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 7:31pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 9:05am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Director Joss Whedon has addressed allegations of his abusive behavior for the first time in a new interview, denying any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe that,” he added, shaking his head, in response to a costume designer’s accusation that he’d grabbed her arm. “I know I would get angry, but I was never physical with people.”</p>
<p>He also denied an allegation from a “high-level member of the ‘Buffy’ production team” that he reportedly once made out with an actress on the floor of an office.</p>
<a>scathing letter</a> she published 
<p>The reporter laughed in response to the comment, to which Whedon retorted: “I’m not actually joking.”</p>
<p>Representatives for Whedon did not return The Post’s request for further comment.</p>
<p>Trachtenberg, meanwhile, came out to say there “was a rule” that Whedon was “not allowed in a room alone with” the now-35-year-old actress, who was 15 at the time she starred in the show.</p>
<p>Both <a>David Boreanaz</a> and Sarah Michelle Gellar <a>stood in solidarity</a> with their co-stars.</p>
<a>Gellar, 44, wrote</a>. “I stand with all survivors of abuse and am proud of them for speaking out.”
<a>Whedon also denied allegations made by “Justice League” stars</a> Ray Fisher and Gal Gadot. The director said Fisher, 34, is a “bad actor” and chalked 36-year-old Gadot’s issues up to a communication issue.
<p>He claimed, “English is not her first language, and I tend to be annoyingly flowery in my speech.”</p>
<p>Whedon told the magazine that he feels as though he’s properly reckoned with any errors he made and now is simply continuing to face an onslaught of baseless abuse at the hands of the public.</p>

<p>After cheekily indicating that her breasts should also be indemnified, Klum clarified that it was actually a “client who insured” her stems and not her.</p>
