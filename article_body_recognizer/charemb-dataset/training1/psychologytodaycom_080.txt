<h2> How to Fight Catastrophic Thinking </h2>
<div> <h3> What are some examples of catastrophic thinking? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is catastrophic thinking a sign of? </h3> </div>
<a>social anxiety disorder</a>,
<a>obsessive-compulsive disorder</a>, or other conditions—each of which is diagnosed based on a broader list of symptoms. One can also engage in catastrophic thinking without having a diagnosable disorder.
<div> <h3> How do I stop blowing things out of proportion? </h3> </div>
<a>among other active ways of responding.</a> After identifying a catastrophic thought, it may help to
<a>may also help you stop catastrophizing.</a>
<div> <h3> How can I stop worrying about the worst-case scenario? </h3> </div>
<a>To handle catastrophizing</a> about the future, it may be helpful to think through the most plausible consequences of a real or anticipated mistake, accident, unexpected obstacle, or other misfortune.
<a>About the feared catastrophe, you can ask</a>: How bad would it really be? Would it really be something you couldn’t recover from? A future problem
<div> <h3> Can therapy help with catastrophic thinking? </h3> </div>
<a>psychotherapy</a>, including forms of
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy (CBT), can provide concrete coping skills with the guidance of a trained therapist. A therapist with training in CBT can help an individual work through anxiety or other challenges in part
<a>by identifying and reality-testing cognitive distortions</a>, including catastrophic thinking.
<div> <h3> Who created the term “catastrophize”? </h3> </div>
<a>coined by psychologist Albert Ellis</a>, the founder of
<a>rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)</a>. REBT, which is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy, aims to help people identify, challenge, and replace self-defeating thoughts, of which catastrophic thoughts are one kind. 
<div> <h3> Do children catastrophize? </h3> </div>
<a>forms of thinking that can burden children and teens</a>, not just adults. For example, a school-age child may worry about the worst-imaginable consequences of a failure such as getting a poor grade on a test or not making a sports team.

<h2> Catastrophizing and Chronic Pain </h2>
<div> <h3> Why does catastrophizing make the effects of pain worse? </h3> </div>
<a>stress</a> and anxiety. For some,
<a>catastrophizing may also discourage physical activity</a>, which can be a valuable part of the
<a>management</a> of certain forms of chronic pain. 
<div> <h3> How can you reduce pain catastrophizing? </h3> </div>
<a>cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</a> and
<a>acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</a> (which involves elements of CBT and
<a>mindfulness</a>) may help improve quality of life for someone who has chronic pain,
<a>in part by helping the person challenge any catastrophic thinking</a>. Informal tactics such as
<a>bringing awareness to catastrophizing and reframing the thoughts</a> can also be helpful.

<p>2. Question the catastrophe.</p>
<a>worrying</a> about it does you no good.
<a>negativity</a>, it stops being so scary.
<p>3. Overcome your <a>fear</a> of failure.</p>
<a>goals</a> you’ve achieved. Remind yourself that you have been successful at things in the past, even small things. When you remind yourself that you have succeeded before, you can help shift towards a challenge mindset.
<p>4. Find the benefits of past challenges and failures.</p>
<p>Part of what makes challenges, well, challenging is that we become myopic and only focus on the bad without seeing the good. So how do you find the benefits of failure?</p>
<a>perfectionism</a>. Try to really search for as many benefits as you can think of. Ask yourself these questions to help you.
<li>Were there, or will there be, any positive outcomes that result from this situation?</li>
<li>Are you grateful for any part of this situation?</li>
<li>In what ways are you better off than when you started?</li>
<li>How did you grow and develop as a result of this situation?</li>
<p>5. Emotionally distance yourself from challenges.</p>
<a>feel better</a> when bad things happen.
<a>stressful</a> conflict you had with another person. Be sure to choose something very specific. For example, recall when “You got into a fight with John about forgetting your birthday.” Try not to think about fights with John in general.
<p>Now re-imagine the stressful event from an outside observer’s point of view—for example, from the point of view of a stranger on the street or a fly on the wall.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these questions to practice being a fly on the wall:</p>
<li>Would the observer be able to understand why you are upset?</li>
<li>Would the observer be able to see the other person’s point of view?</li>
<li>How would the observer evaluate the situation?</li>
<li>Might this observer view the situation differently than you do?</li>
<p>6. Remember, this too shall pass.</p>
<a>stressful situations</a>, try to look back at the situation from sometime in the future.
<ul><li>In five years, what will you be doing?</li> <li>How will you be spending your time?</li> <li>How will you be feeling?</li> <li>How will you feel about this particular event?</li> </ul>
<p>7. Find the silver linings.</p>
<p>8. Practice reappraisal while streaming movies.</p>
<a>plan to practice the next time you stream a movie or show</a>. Before watching a sad or emotional movie or scene, read these instructions:
<p>9. Find the benefits in life.</p>
<a>feel relaxed</a> and have more time to devote to other things you enjoy. With some practice, you can find the benefits to just about any situation.
<a>gratitude</a> that I wasn’t driving on the freeway when it happened, especially since I spend about 10 hours per week commuting. I was so
<a>happy</a> that my car retained 3rd gear, so I didn’t have to get it towed. And my husband was in the car with me, so I was glad he was able to help me get it to an auto shop that same day.
<a>positive mindset</a>. As a result, I handled this challenge quickly and easily and got on with my life.
<p>You can practice this on social media. If you post about a negative experience, add at least one benefit to your post.</p>
<p>11. Use your negative emotions to propel you forward.</p>
<a>positivity</a> and decrease negative emotions. But it’s important to remember that negative emotions are completely normal and healthy. Besides, negative emotions have benefits too.
<a>grief</a> help communicate to others that we need their support and
<a>kindness</a>. Negative emotions like
<a>anger</a> can help motivate us to
<a>attention</a> to see if your negative emotions are trying to lead you in a positive direction. Then decide for yourself: Will you follow?
<p>If you need help understanding your negative emotions, you could take some time alone to reflect or <a>talk to a therapist</a> or life coach.</p>

<p>JA: How do you personally define complex trauma?</p>
<a>caregiving</a> system, and is generally understood to begin in
<a>adolescence</a>. The exposures associated with complex trauma include, but are not limited to: abuse (physical,
<a>sexual</a>, verbal, emotional), emotional and physical neglect, witnessing
<a>domestic violence</a>, witnessing community violence, and victimization due to racial/cultural
<a>discrimination</a>. Complex trauma exposure can also be understood as occurring when significant developmental needs went unmet, such as due to chronic caregiver impairment (e.g. parental mental health and/or
<a>substance abuse</a> struggles). As a result of chronic, relational trauma, the developmental impact is significant and affects the individual’s emotional, cognitive, behavioral, interpersonal, and physical functioning throughout the lifespan.
<p>JA: What are some of the factors that contribute to complex trauma or put someone at risk?</p>
<a>parenting</a> become overwhelming, thereby putting the next generation at risk. This cycle is complicated further by the neurobiological impact of trauma. The chronic activation of the body’s
<a>attention</a> in her home. And although these behaviors were essential to earlier-life survival, they inhibit the survivor’s ability to live, love, work, and parent in adulthood…and the cycle of risk (potentially) continues.
<p>JA: How did you first get interested in complex trauma?</p>
<a>psychiatric</a> diagnoses. As it turns out, the existing labels and diagnostic structure in place to understand such children are severely limited—we have diagnoses that capture child and adult mood swings,
<a>anxiety</a> symptoms, disruptive behaviors, and negative interpersonal styles, and often all of the above are assigned to any given individual with a complex trauma history.
<a>humor</a>, and most of all—a sense of common humanity. One of my heroes is Father Gregory Boyle, who talks about working with human suffering with an awareness of kinship and accompaniment—a sense that we are all in this journey together.
<p>JA: What is the connection between complex trauma and resilience?</p>
<a>therapy</a>, support, and sometimes
<a>medication</a>—to develop a whole new set of less-survival-based, more engaged life skills.
<p>JA: What are some ways people might work through complex trauma?</p>
<a>attachment</a>/relational work, building capacity to self-soothe and regulate distress, identifying and nurturing parts (often dissociative) of self and
<a>identity</a> that have been impacted by trauma, and processing/making-meaning of
<a>traumatic</a> life experiences. In addition to traditional trauma therapy, however, there are amazing interventions that are helping survivors befriend and rehabilitate the ways that trauma is stored in the body, through
<a>meditation</a>, yoga, dance, drama, and other embodied practices.

<h1> Why Some Children Are Orchids and Others Are Dandelions </h1>
<h2> Many children are able to thrive in any environment, while others may flourish only under the most favorable conditions. New findings reveal the complex interplay of factors that creates "dandelion" and "orchid" kids. </h2>

<h4>HOW DO KIDS COPE? To get a sense of how school-age children think about resilience, PT asked a few how they cheer up others or whether they have a go-to strategy for themselves. Their portraits follow.</h4>

<p>So, are orchids born that way, or do they become orchids by way of early life experience? Our first hint at an answer came from the very first moments of postnatal life.</p>

<p>Winston Churchill once said, "A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty." Research shows that, on average, human beings are hardwired to be more optimistic than not. </p>
<h2> What Does It Mean to Be Optimistic? </h2>

<div> <h3> What are some of the benefits of being optimistic? </h3> </div>
<a>management</a>, improved immune and cardiovascular function, and greater physical functioning. Optimism helps buffer the negative effects of physical illness and
<a> is associated with better health outcomes</a> in general. Optimists tend to look for meaning in adversity, which can make them more resilient.
<div> <h3> How does optimism affect romantic relationships? </h3> </div>
<a> can lead to high expectations</a> that are impossible for anyone to fulfill. Couples with too much optimism may also fail to develop the problem-solving skills they need during difficult times. This can lead to low relational quality.

<a> is called optimism bias</a>. While an optimistic viewpoint can be helpful in motivating people to take chances and pursue their
<a>dreams</a>, a dose of realism about the risks involved can make success more likely.
<div> <h3> Who is more likely to be optimistic: men or women? </h3> </div>
<a>gender</a> differences in what they are optimistic about. Men, for example, have been found to hold more optimistic views about the economic future. During economic downturns, however, the gender difference disappears.
<div> <h3> How can optimism help protect against doubt and despair? </h3> </div>
<a> Optimism gives them hope</a> that they have some
