<h2> The Basics of Behaviorism </h2>
<div> <h3> Who first came up with behaviorism? </h3> </div>
<a>child development</a> and was (in)famous for conducting the “Little Albert” experiment, now widely seen as unethical. Though his work is still taught to psychology students, some argue that his
<a>legacy should be rethought</a>.
<div> <h3> What is classical conditioning? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is operant conditioning? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the difference between methodological behaviorism and radical behaviorism? </h3> </div>
<a>“Radical behaviorism,”</a> devised by B.F. Skinner, argues that thoughts and feelings represent “inner behavior” and can be studied and modified, just like external behaviors. 
<div> <h3> Does punishment help teach good behavior? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What was the Little Albert experiment? </h3> </div>
<a>identity</a> of “Albert,” the child’s true identity—and the aftereffects of the study—remain debated.
<div> <h3> Where is behaviorism used today? </h3> </div>
<a>therapy</a>, for example, aims to weaken conditioned responses to certain feared stimuli. Applied behavior analysis (ABA), a therapy used to treat autism, is based on behaviorist principles. Behaviorism also shows up in
<a>organizational psychology</a>, particularly in the use of rewards and punishments to modify employee behavior.

<h2> Why People Like Behaviorist Approaches to the Mind </h2>
<div> <h3> Can behaviorism be useful during therapy? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can teachers use behaviorism to help students master skills? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can people use behavioral modification to change others’ behavior? </h3> </div>
<a>“rewarding” a partner with affection</a> when they complete a needed chore. Evidence suggests, however, that such “conditional regard” can backfire in
<h2> The Criticisms of Behaviorism </h2>
<div> <h3> Why did behaviorism start to lose popularity? </h3> </div>
<a>memory</a>, started to gain steam in the 1960s. Psychologists of the time were frustrated by the limits of behaviorism and felt that it was unable to truly explain the complex realities of human behavior. An influential critique by linguist
<a>Noam Chomsky</a> is credited with dismantling much of behaviorism’s influence.
<div> <h3> What are some critiques of behaviorism? </h3> </div>
<a>free will</a>. Some modern applications of behaviorism—most notably applied behavior analysis—have been criticized for modifying behavior at the expense of personal agency; some have suggested that the use of
<a>behaviorist techniques to treat autism</a>, in particular, can be harmful.
<div> <h3> What are the criticisms of applied behavior analysis (ABA)? </h3> </div>
<a>autistic</a> individuals to behave in neurotypical ways, even when it does not benefit them. They also argue that it 
<a>does not address the underlying reasons for autistic behaviors</a>—using reinforcement to get an autistic person to stop hand-flapping, for example, does not target his
<a>motivation</a> for doing so in the first place, and thus leaves him with an unmet internal need.

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors</h1> <p>Dermatillomania, Skin Picking, Onychophagia, Nail Biting, Skin Excoriation, BFRB</p> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<a>impulse control disorders</a>, and obsessive compulsive disorder, but most experts agree that they differ significantly from all three. Certain BFRBs are currently categorized as “
<a>obsessive-compulsive</a> and related disorders” in the
<a>DSM-5</a>. Regardless of how the behaviors are categorized, they are difficult for individuals to control.
<div> <h3> Why do I pull my hair or pick at my skin? </h3> </div>
<a>Individuals with BFRBs report different “triggers” for the behaviors</a>. Many people pick or pull when they’re
<a>anxious</a>, for instance—often finding that doing so provides temporary relief. But others report that they pick, pull, or scratch without noticing, or while engrossed in another activity like reading or watching TV. 
<div> <h3> Why can’t I stop pulling out my hair? </h3> </div>
<a>out of their control</a>. Treatment—and self-compassion—can help people reduce the frequency of the behaviors or stop them entirely.
<div> <h3> When do BFRBs typically start? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Body-focused repetitive behaviors usually begin in <a>late childhood or during the teen years</a>. In rare cases, they may develop in adults or in younger children. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Do BFRBs run in families? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The disorders are thought to have a genetic component—and often run in families—and may also be influenced by early environment, <a>stress</a>, and temperament.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Do BFRBs only affect women? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>No; <a>men develop BFRBs as well</a>. However, the disorders do appear to be more common in women. About 90 percent of adults who seek help for BFRBs are female. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What does it feel like to have a BFRB? </h3> </div>
<a>or bald spots</a>. They frequently cause extreme emotional distress, particularly if the disorder is undiagnosed or kept secret. BFRBs, when severe, can impair someone's ability to socialize or to function at work.

<h2> How to Manage and Treat BFRBs </h2>
<a>medication</a>, and select supplements—most notably N-acetylcysteine, an amino acid. While for some, these options are highly effective, overall, they have a long-term success rate of less than 20 percent.

<p><a>Find a therapist who specializes in body-focused repetitive behaviors.</a></p>
<div> <h3> What is the best treatment for body-focused repetitive behaviors? </h3> </div>
<a>may also be highly effective for recognizing behavior patterns and managing the negative emotions</a> associated with BFRBs. 
<div> <h3> Does medication help? </h3> </div>
<a>Medication is generally considered less effective than behavioral treatments at treating BFRBs</a>. But some drugs have shown promise, particularly for individuals with co-occurring anxiety,
<a>depression</a>, or OCD. These include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (
<a>SSRIs</a>), clomipramine, naltrexone, and olanzapine.
<div> <h3> What strategies can I use to stop pulling out my hair on my own? </h3> </div>
<a>self-help</a> strategies have helped people with BFRBs manage the behaviors on their own. These include using an object to occupy the hands during times when pulling occurs;
<a>wearing gloves or mittens to make picking harder</a>; and joining a support group to connect with others with BFRBs.
<h2> Managing Shame and Stigma </h2>
<p>Although BFRBs affect millions, they are not well-understood and are rarely portrayed in the media. As a result, the behaviors are often seen as little more than “bad habits” that could be stopped using <a>willpower</a>.</p>
<a>intimacy</a>, and daily functioning.
<div> <h3> I feel so ashamed because of my disorder. How can I manage these feelings? </h3> </div>
<a>guilt</a> and shame with a loved one or therapist can be immensely helpful. Many with BFRBs also find comfort simply in learning that they are not alone. For this reason,
<a>support groups and online resources can be especially useful in reducing shame</a>.
<div> <h3> Will I pull out my hair for the rest of my life? </h3> </div>
<a>need to manage and treat them for their entire lifetime</a>. But improvement is possible, and many with BFRBs have developed treatment plans and coping mechanisms that have greatly reduced—or even eliminated—their need to pick or pull. 
<div> <h3> Should I tell my friends or family about my body-focused repetitive behavior? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why have so few people heard of BFRBs? </h3> </div>
<a>better understanding of the disorders' roots</a> is critical for adequate treatment, especially because experts theorize that different subtypes may require different approaches.
<div> <h3> Can I go to a hair salon with trichotillomania? </h3> </div>
<a>emotionally draining for people with trichotillomania</a>. Looking online to
<a>find a hairstylist who is comfortable with BFRBs</a> can provide peace of mind and allow people with trich to look and feel their best.

<a>psychiatric</a> disorders and can in fact be a part of healthy, loving relationships.
<a>dating</a> back hundreds of years. But until the latter part of the 20th century, many people, particularly in the Western world, believed that an interest in BDSM reflected mental illness, sexual deviance, or a history of abuse or sexual
<a>trauma</a>. More recent research, however, has suggested that people who engage in BDSM (also sometimes referred to as kink) are no more likely to be mentally unwell than the rest of the population.
<div> <h3> Is BDSM sex common? </h3> </div>
<a>Sex that incorporates elements of BDSM</a> is more common than many think. One study, for example, found that 30 percent of people had tried
<a>spanking</a> during sex and nearly a quarter had tried dominant/submissive roleplay. Another study found that 47 percent of adults reported experimenting with at least one aspect of BDSM.
<div> <h3> Is BDSM dangerous? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What kind of people enjoy BDSM? </h3> </div>
<a>people who enjoyed BDSM</a> were less neurotic, more
<a>extraverted</a>, more open, and less sensitive to rejection than those who didn’t.
<div> <h3> Do people who like BDSM have a history of abuse or trauma? </h3> </div>
<a>PTSD</a> than the general population. On the other hand, there are some people who report practicing BDSM as a way of working through their past trauma.
<div> <h3> Are women or men more interested in BDSM? </h3> </div>
<p>It’s hard to know for sure. <a>Some studies</a> have indicated slightly more men than women report engaging in BDSM, but some researchers caution that social stigma may lead to survey respondents not being entirely truthful. </p>

<h2> BDSM and Mental Health </h2>
<a>national survey</a> of Australian adults, for instance, found that those who participated in BDSM were no more likely than others to have experienced
<a>sexual abuse</a> or to be unhappy or
<a>Dutch study</a> found that BDSM practitioners showed greater subjective well-being than a control group.
<div> <h3> Is an interest in kink a mental disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can BDSM be good for partners’ mental health? </h3> </div>
<a>romantic relationships</a>—and particularly those who take the dominant role—have lower
<a>rejection sensitivity</a>, and greater
<a>sexual satisfaction</a> than controls.
<div> <h3> What’s the difference between BDSM and paraphilias? </h3> </div>
<a>Paraphilias are sexual interests that are “atypical”</a>; by this definition, certain aspects of BDSM (such as extreme sadism or masochism) could be considered paraphilias. However, the
<a>DSM</a> currently defines paraphilic disorders as sexual practices that are “atypical” and cause the individual distress or involve non-consenting others. Thus, BDSM alone is not considered a paraphilic disorder.
<div> <h3> My therapist judges me for enjoying BDSM. What should I do? </h3> </div>
<a>Therapy patients who feel as if their therapist is shaming them</a> for consensual, non-dangerous sexual practices—BDSM or otherwise—should feel empowered to end
<a>therapy</a> and find a new clinician. 
<div> <h3> How do I find a kink-friendly therapist? </h3> </div>
<a>search for kink-friendly therapists using the Psychology Today Therapy Directory</a>, which allows them to filter by specialty. Patients are also free to ask their therapist directly if they are kink-friendly, if they are comfortable doing so. 
<h2> BDSM in Relationships </h2>
<div> <h3> How can partners cultivate trust in a BDSM relationship? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are all BDSM relationships abusive? </h3> </div>
<a>humiliation</a>, physical restraint, and/or an apparent lack of control, it is not synonymous with abusive relationships or sexual practices. Many people in long-term,
<a>loving relationships practice BDSM</a>. In some cases, however, relationships that engage in BDSM can also be abusive.
<div> <h3> How can someone recognize abuse in a consensual BDSM relationship? </h3> </div>
<a>fear</a> their partner, do not trust that their boundaries will be respected, and feel unable to communicate their concerns should seek help immediately.
<div> <h3> I want to try BDSM, but my partner is uncomfortable with it (or vice versa). How can we navigate this? </h3> </div>

<h2> What Is Authenticity? </h2>
<div> <h3> How do researchers define authenticity? </h3> </div>
<p>The concept is still debated today, but psychologists Michael Kernis and Brian Goldman developed an Authenticity Inventory in 2000 comprised of four key factors:</p>
<p>1. Self-awareness: Knowledge of and trust in one's own motives, emotions, preferences, and abilities.</p>
<p>2. Unbiased processing: Clarity in evaluating your strengths and your weaknesses without <a>denial</a> or blame.</p>

<a>bias</a> or judgment discrepancy in which our impression of a person dictates the assumptions we make about that individual. For example, people will more readily blame an unattractive person for a
<a>crime</a> than an attractive one. Now there’s evidence that beauty,
<a>intelligence</a>, and other positive characteristics may go hand in hand.
<h2> The Truth About Beauty </h2>
<div> <h3> Is it important to be beautiful? </h3> </div>
<a>beautiful is best</a>. In fact, even children are drawn to aesthetically pleasing faces, as opposed to unattractive and asymmetric ones.
<div> <h3> Is life easier when you are attractive? </h3> </div>
<a> the more attractive you are</a> the higher chance of getting to the head of the line. Plus, the better-looking student is considered more competent and enjoys higher grades, as well.
<div> <h3> What are the disadvantages of being beautiful? </h3> </div>
<a>likely to be hired</a>. These people are also often the target of
<a>jealousy</a> and exclusion. And in the
<a>dating</a> scene, a person with extraordinary looks will get passed over as unattainable.
<div> <h3> Why do we hire attractive people? </h3> </div>
<a>preference for attractiveness</a> can be found across domains, including
<a>politics</a>, media, and the legal field. Beautiful people are also hired sooner, get promotions more quickly, are higher-ranking in their companies, and receive extra benefits and perks on the job.
<div> <h3> Do beautiful people earn more money? </h3> </div>
<a>attractive people earn more</a> than people with below-average looks, which adds up to a significant amount of money over a lifetime. The public would rather deal with a good-looking shop clerk rather than a less visually appealing one.
<div> <h3> What is the halo effect? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>The <a>halo effect</a> causes a trait, such as beauty, to drastically color your perception of all other traits. If you think someone is beautiful, you are also likely to assume they’re smart, ambitious, and interesting.</p> </div>

<div> <h3> What do women find attractive in men? </h3> </div>
<a>value status and resources</a> at least as much, focusing on the question of whether a man will help them raise and support their future children.
<div> <h3> What do men find attractive in women? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Heterosexual men more strongly desire women with <a>hourglass-shaped</a> figures as well as feminine features. These characteristics are considered markers of health and fertility.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Do people think they’re better looking than they are? </h3> </div>

<div> <h3> Why do I look better in the mirror than in photographs? </h3> </div>

<div> <h3> How can I help a girl or a young woman feel good about her looks? </h3> </div>
<a>identity-shaping qualities</a> that offer a depth of character. These things can be developed: intelligence,
<a>imagination</a>, critical thinking,
<a>empathy</a>. Attention to these characteristics can help girls and young women feel good about themselves and will have a more profound effect than just being pretty.
<div> <h3> What makes someone physically attracted to you? </h3> </div>
<div> <article> </article> <p>What men and women tend to prefer when it comes to beauty may seem mysterious, but science does explain a lot of it. For example, we are drawn to symmetry, a skinny waist in women, and height in men.</p> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is symmetry considered attractive? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is waist-to-hip ratio important? </h3> </div>
<p>A <a>skinny waist</a> and curvy hips in women is preferred, this shape indicates a good environment for future child-bearing and a higher likelihood of giving birth to healthy children. And the smaller the waist is, the more attractive the woman.</p>
<div> <h3> Why do we prefer the left side of the face? </h3> </div>
<a>preferred by portraitists</a>.
<div> <h3> Why are baby faced adults considered attractive? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why are tall men attractive? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Women prefer tall men, as height can signal <a>status and power;</a> the truth is, taller people do actually earn more. And tall men are more likely to win the popular vote in presidential elections and to be re-elected once in office.</p> </div>
<div> <h3> Why are the eyes important in beauty? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The <a>limbal ring</a> is the circle around the iris, this line separates the colored part of the eye from the white part. This ring fades as we age. Therefore, prominence of the ring signifies youth, health, and beauty.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the lumbar curve? </h3> </div>
<a>pregnancy</a> shifts a woman's center of gravity forward, men would be attracted to women with a
<a>lower back curvature</a> that would minimize the pressure on the spine created by carrying a fetus.
