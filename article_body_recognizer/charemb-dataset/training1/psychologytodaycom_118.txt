<h2> Why Teamwork Matters </h2>
<a>goals</a> to be met and customers to be satisfied.
<div> <h3> Why do humans cooperate? </h3> </div>

<h2> How to Improve Teamwork </h2>
<div> <h3> Is it possible to teach teamwork skills? </h3> </div>
<a>building emotional intelligence</a>, and imparting specific strategies for collaborating successfully.
<div> <h3> What makes a team successful? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the most effective strategies for improving teamwork in an organization? </h3> </div>
<a>strategies used by effective teams.</a> Though team-building interventions are often derided, research shows that some—particularly those that improve trust and communication—can improve team effectiveness.
<div> <h3> How does group trust affect teamwork? </h3> </div>
<a>higher levels of trust</a> boost morale and trigger better performance. However, research suggests that when teams are forced to trust each other too quickly, or do so without evidence, it can have a negative effect on
<a>decision-making</a> and outcomes.
<div> <h3> How do I lead a productive team? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do I manage someone who doesn’t work well with others? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> I prefer to work on my own. How can I learn to work on a team? </h3> </div>
<a>team player</a> is about managing emotions—whether frustration,
<a>embarrassment</a>. Practicing
<a>emotional regulation</a> will go a long way toward better teamwork.
<h2> How Communication Affects Teamwork </h2>
<a>emotional intelligence</a>, come more naturally to some than others; fortunately, most people can learn to become better communicators with practice.
<div> <h3> How can teams communicate more effectively? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is nonverbal communication important for teamwork? </h3> </div>
<a>Nonverbal communication</a>—including gestures, facial expressions, and tone of voice—can help or hinder a team’s
<div> <h3> Does emotional intelligence affect teamwork? </h3> </div>
<a>intelligence</a> is a skill that enables people to better understand their own emotions as well as the emotions of those around them. Research suggests that
<a>teams with greater average emotional intelligence</a> are more effective than less emotionally savvy teams. The skill can help teams navigate conflict, evenly divide work, and develop long-term trust.

<h1> The Evidence on Kids, Sleep, and School Start Times </h1>
<h2> Research shows starting school later is better for kids. </h2>

<a>demonstrates</a> that when young people begin
<a>puberty</a>, their biological clocks shift; they typically become sleepy later—as late as 11 p.m.—and need to sleep later in the morning to get the recommended 8 to 10 hours of sleep each night.
<p>Yet the vast majority of middle and high schools in the U.S. begin before 8 a.m. If you factor in travel time, it means many young people have to wake up in the early morning hours.</p>
<a>risky behaviors</a> (such as drinking,
<a>smoking</a> tobacco, and using drugs), and
<a> perform poorly in school</a>.
<a>recommended</a> delaying start times for middle and high schools to 8:30 a.m. or later.
<p>But in many school districts, middle and high schools still begin early. If you are a parent or <a>caregiver</a>, what can you do?</p>
<p>Practice <a>good sleep hygiene</a> to set an example for your child. That means leaving screens out of the bedroom and avoiding them an hour before bedtime, only using your bed for <a>sleeping</a>, and <a>cutting</a> out caffeine after 2 p.m.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Once kids enter puberty, their bodies naturally want to go to sleep later and wake later. Helping your teens to get at least eight hours of sleep each night can help them to be happier and healthier.</p>

<h1> Anxiety and Depression in College Students </h1>

<p>Many of us think of college as a wondrous time of new experiences and great freedom to explore new ideas and find one’s true self.</p>
<a>college students</a> at alarming rates. As noted in the latest Center for Collegiate Mental Health
<a>report</a>, anxiety and depression are the top reasons that college students seek counseling.
<p>Research shows that nearly 1 in 5 university students suffer from anxiety or depression.</p>
<p>So why are these disorders so prevalent in our college students? As a professor of psychiatry and a practicing psychiatrist who has experience with mental health problems among college students, I see a number of factors.</p>
<p>Excessive use of social media and technology may engender <a>impaired social interactions</a> and an increased sense of <a>isolation</a>.</p>
<a>competition</a> between one’s real life and one’s
<p>Several other studies have found evidence that excess smartphone use is associated with <a>sleep disturbance</a>, depression, anxiety, and overall <a>stress</a>.</p>
<a>study</a> found that almost 50 percent of college students indicated they woke up at night to answer text messages. The same study found that the more people use technology during their
<a>sleeping</a> hours, the poorer the quality of their sleep and the higher their rates of depression and anxiety.
<p>But there are other culprits, such as the desire to get into a good college — and stay in college with good grades. To attain these <a>goals</a>, it is not uncommon for students and their parents to seek chemical assistance.</p>
<a>psychiatric</a> assessment to make an accurate diagnosis and determine the most appropriate treatment, if one is necessary. The conversation often stops there.
<a>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a>, there is considerable risk when they are used for other reasons. It is well-known that the side effects of
<a>Ritalin and Adderall</a> include anxiety and depression. This risk is even higher in people taking the medicine for an unapproved reason or who do not take the medicine as prescribed.
<p>College students who reported being victims of <a>cyberbullying</a> in high school — which has <a>nearly doubled</a> in the past decade — also had significantly higher rates of anxiety and depression.</p>
<a>Cigarette smoking</a> has been associated with significantly more sleep problems in college students and increased risk for depression and anxiety. Fortunately, the rate of cigarette
<a>e-cigarette</a> use continues to decline with the rate of past-month use declining to around 16 percent of college students in 2016.
<a>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a> also have much higher rates of anxiety and depression. It is
<a>estimated</a> that between 2 to 8 percent of college students struggle with symptoms of this disorder.
<p>Moreover, while going to college can be exciting for many, for some the adjustment is hard with profound <a>homesickness</a> and separation anxiety. These students are at very high risk for depression and anxiety.</p>
<a>rising cost of college</a>, including the
<a>fear</a> of not getting a job after college and having to move back in with Mom and Dad after graduation, are
<a>associated</a> with increased risk for depression and anxiety in college students.

<a>creativity</a>. I do not mean to blame parents who are concerned and who want the best for their children. However, sometimes failing or not getting an A on a test can be more instructive and instill a sense of
<a>resilience</a> and the ability to “bounce back.”
<p>So what do we do to curtail anxiety and depression among college students?</p>
<h3>Help, hotlines, and hope</h3>
<a>study</a> that looked at mental health service use in university students found that even when universal access to mental health care is provided, most students with mental disorders do not get treatment.
<p>The good news is that if we are proactive there is a solution that is cost-effective and that can work, but only if there is buy-in at every level of the particular university and society.</p>

<h1> What We Know About Distance Learning </h1>
<h2> Research demonstrates the best ways to learn from home. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: shangarey/Adobe Stock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Schools across the nation have been closed for weeks, and many are attempting to teach students from home as the nation works to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Despite the struggles, there is some evidence that distance learning can be effective for young people. Two recent systematic reviews take a careful look at how technology can help—and hinder—learning for young people.</p>
<p>First, for K-12 students, although simply giving a computer to a child did not improve learning outcomes, it did improve computer proficiency and some cognitive skills.</p>
<p>The review also looked at online classes. It found online-only courses—where students never met in person—were not as effective as courses where students had the opportunity to meet in person, at least some of the time.</p>
<p>Clearly, meeting with students in person is not a possibility for the millions forced to practice social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. What about if students can only learn online?</p>

<h1> Does Homework Serve a Purpose? </h1>

<a>anxious</a> to complete the assignment, but that was more to get it off their busy plate. Which brings us to the essential question — does homework serve a purpose?
<a>homework does serve a purpose</a>. They often cite that homework helps prepare students for standardized tests, that it helps supplement and reinforce what’s being taught in class, and that it helps teach fundamental skills such as
<a>time management</a>, organization, task completion, as well as responsibility (extracurricular activities and work experience can also teach those fundamental skills).
<a>stress</a> to health risks. For example, one study in the
<a>Journal of Educational Psychology </a>showed that when middle school students were assigned more than 90 to 100 minutes of daily homework, their math and science test scores began to decline.

<a>depression</a>, anxiety, and early
<a>burnout</a>. Too many teens are already running on empty. With
<a>more than half</a> of teens reporting school and homework as a primary source of their stress, it’s evident that academic pressure is becoming a burden.
<a>the University of Phoenix College of Education </a>teacher survey, high school students can get assigned up to 17.5 hours of homework each week. To top it off, a
<a>Today </a>article reported that teachers often underestimate the amount of homework they assign by as much as 50%. Now that’s a huge miscalculation, and our nation's youth have to suffer the consequences of those errors.

<p>The homework debate will likely continue until we take a good, hard look at our current policies and practices. What side of the line do you stand on when it comes to homework? Perhaps you’re somewhere in the middle?</p>
<p>Please weigh in with your thoughts. I am always eager to hear students’ voices in this discussion. If you are a student, please share what’s on your plate and how much time you spend doing homework each night.</p>

<p>The nature and nurture of creativity.</p>
<p><a>Anthony D. Fredericks Ed.D.</a></p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2>Did Your Teachers Like You?</h2> <p>The beliefs our teachers had about creativity may determine our creative capabilities as adults. Interestingly, philosophy and classroom practices are often in conflict.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Why Failing Is Necessary for Creativity</a></h2> <p>There's a common misconception that failure is to be avoided at all costs. The reality is that the acceptance of failure often determines how creative we can be.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Someone Doesn't Have to Be Smart to Be Creative</a></h2> <p>Creativity involves habits of mind, more so than innate intelligence. In short, IQ is not the most important determinant of a creative life.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>How a New Mindset Can Dramatically Improve Your Creativity</a></h2> <p>What you believe about the creative process often determines how creative you are. Change your mindset, and you can ignite your creativity. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Awful Truth About Creativity</a></h2> <p>We often embrace the myth that a sudden strike of creative inspiration will solve any challenge. As a result, we often wait in vain.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Need a Creativity Boost? Try Laughing!</a></h2> <p>Exciting things happen when you include more humor in your everyday activities. Your creativity will sparkle, and your innovative spirit will shine. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Why Kindergartners Are Better Creative Thinkers Than Graduate Students</a></h2> <p>Rarely are we taught how to solve problems. As a result, we defer to an incomplete and insufficient process. There's a better way!</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>How to Jump-Start Your Creativity Using Mindfulness</a></h2> <p>Are you looking for a way to revitalize your creative spirit? Mindfulness offers dynamic possibilities for re-kindling your latent creativity.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>What's Killing Your Creativity at Work?</a></h2>
<p>Ever been "shot down" when suggesting a new idea? Interestingly, that negativity has a decided effect—one sufficient to quell both our imagination and corporate inventiveness.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>How Education Quashed Your Creativity</a></h2> <p>The more education you get, the less creative you become. An obsession with the "right answers" in most classrooms puts the brakes on our creative instincts.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>5 Creativity Strategies Nobody Told You About</a></h2> <p>If you're looking for some strategies to spice up your "Creative IQ," here are some of the best. They're simple, fun, and will generate a plethora of dynamic ideas.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why You Should Daydream More</a></h2> <p>Looking for an easy way to stimulate your creative output? Daydreaming may be your answer. It worked for you as a child; it can work for you as an adult.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>You Don't Have to Be Smart to Be Creative</a></h2> <p>There is a common belief that you can’t be creative unless you have a high I.Q. Let’s retire that myth once and for all.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<p>In-class physical exercise programs are a win-win for students and educators because these activities facilitate better academic performance without reducing the amount of time spent learning in the classroom.</p>
<p>The main takeaway of this meta-analysis is that weaving physical activity into school lessons is linked to better test scores than having students sit still through an entire class.</p>

<a>analyzed data</a> from thousands of people in the U.S., U.K., and Germany and found no significant correlations between birth order and traits such as

<a>Brent Roberts</a> found only very small associations between birth order and

<h3>It’s not an excuse for cheating, because it rarely (if ever) occurs.</h3>
<a>cheat on</a> their partners, engage in risky sex acts at a cost to their mental and physical well-being, and blow up their lives for a one-night stand. Sex can be damaging. But can it be addictive? You won’t find “
<a>sex addiction</a>” in the current
<a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM-5), used to make diagnoses in the U.S. The World Health Organization has added “compulsive
<a>sexual</a> behavior disorder” to its diagnostic guide, but does not use the “A” word.
<a>addiction</a> can be judged based on six criteria, says
<a>Mark Griffiths</a>, a psychologist at Nottingham Trent University in the U.K. who researches addiction. The object in question—heroin, gambling,
<h3>3. LEFT-BRAINED OR RIGHT-BRAINED?</h3>
<h3>You do not have a dominant brain hemisphere.</h3>
<p>The right and left hemispheres do specialize in different mental functions. But the notion that individuals rely more heavily on one or the other glosses over the complexity of the left-right relationship.</p>
<h3>Tailoring education to “visual learners” or “auditory learners” doesn’t make sense.</h3>
<a>Harold Pashler</a> and colleagues suggested in a
<a>Susan Gelman</a>, who co-authored a recent
<a>study</a> on people’s beliefs about the concept of learning styles. “Or, they may not try to learn a certain skill because they think it doesn’t match the way their brain works.”
<a>stress</a> that there are evidence-backed techniques for enhancing learning that could apply to virtually everyone. Some strategies work well for most students, says psychologist
<a>memory</a>. Unsubstantiated ideas about what differentiates students could distract from what boosts all of them.
<h3>5. MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES</h3>
<h3>“Intrapersonal intelligence,” “musical-rhythmic intelligence,” and others are not equivalent to intelligence as captured by an IQ test.</h3>
<a>general intelligence</a>. General intelligence, which IQ tests reliably assess, has proven a robust predictor of such life outcomes as educational attainment and later success.
<h3>6. 10,000 HOURS of PRACTICE</h3>
<h3>Deliberate practice alone will not an expert make.</h3>
<a>K. Anders Ericsson</a> and colleagues conducted a
<a>a 2014 meta-analysis</a>, psychologist
<a>Brooke Macnamara</a> and colleagues examined more than 80 studies of performance across domains that included sports, music, and
<a>education</a>. They found that deliberate practice accounted for at most about one-quarter of performance differences. In a later
<a>paper</a>, they reported that among athletes classified as “elite,” practice explained only about 1 percent of the variation in performance.

<a>empathy</a>. Men, on average,
<a>perform better</a> on tasks in which they mentally rotate an object, while women can
<a>better remember</a> the location of objects. Evolutionary theorists postulate that sex differences arose because male and female hominids faced different reproductive and survival pressures.

<a>Georgia Hodes</a>, is that “boys and girls, particularly adolescents, had different responses to experiencing post-
<p>Sex differences can be important in the development of medications, too, Hodes points out—past efforts show that a drug tested on male animals won’t necessarily work for human females.</p>
<h3>8. THE DEPRESSION GENE</h3>
<h3>There is no single gene for depression, schizophrenia, or any other psychiatric disorder.</h3>
<a>depression</a>, or an autism spectrum diagnosis is to some degree dictated by
<a>genetics</a>. “You have a much higher risk of having depression if you have a sibling or parent with depression, and the same is true for schizophrenia and basically all
<a>psychiatric</a> conditions,” says
<a>Kevin Mitchell</a>, a neurogeneticist at Trinity College Dublin. Accordingly, since at least the early 1990s, researchers in psychiatry have searched for specific genes that have a major influence on a person’s risk for mental disorders.
<a>reported</a> that none of 18 “candidate genes” for major depression—genes that past studies had suggested might have a meaningful association with the disorder—showed any such associations.
<a>ADHD</a> is increased. Your risk of autism is increased. There’s a shared genetic basis for all these things.”

<h1> Homeschooling: Is It the Best Option for You and Your Child? </h1>
<h2> 10 benefits and 10 pitfalls of this increasingly popular educational choice. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Graham Knott/Flickr</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h2>What Is Homeschooling?</h2>
<p>There are many homeschooling styles, models, and approaches. These include Montessori, Classical, Charlotte Mason, Unschooling, and Eclectic, among others, each of which has strengths and advocates, as well as drawbacks and detractors.</p>
<h2>Why Do Parents Homeschool Their Kids?</h2>
<h2>What Are the Benefits of Homeschooling?</h2>
<a>creativity</a> breaks as needed.
<li>Safety, warmth, and nurturing: You can provide your child with a supportive learning environment at home, where there is no <a>bullying</a>, <a>racism</a>, violence, or other <a>psychological abuse</a>.</li>
<a>competition</a> or performance schedule would disrupt regular schooling.
<li>Continual learning for you: By taking on a teaching role, you will also be expanding your own knowledge and understanding.</li>
<li>Finding like-minded others: Increasing numbers of parents are homeschooling their kids, forming networks and support groups that can enrich your life as they help you provide the schooling you want for your child.</li>
<li>Academic achievement: Most research findings show that structured homeschooling leads to higher achievement test scores than regular schooling.</li>
<h2>What Are the Potential Pitfalls of Homeschooling?</h2>
<li>Conflicting responsibilities: Teachers and parents have different roles in children’s lives. If you are trying to fill both these roles, you may find yourself filling neither one as well as you could otherwise do.</li>
<li>Restricting your child’s experience: It’s almost impossible for homeschoolers to replicate what’s on offer at the local school by way of diversity of opinion, attitudes, culture, and more.</li>
<li>Constraining your child’s learning: It is hard for homeschooling parents to provide the diversity of learning experiences and teachers that children get at school.</li>
<a>stressful</a>, for both you and your child. If you are homeschooling, you might find it increasingly hard to be patient and reasonable when your child is restless or challenging.
<li> Purchasing school supplies: You will need to continually find resources, books, and learning materials that would otherwise be supplied by your local school.</li>
<li>Motivating your child’s curiosity: Keeping your child’s curiosity bubbling isn’t always easy. Like their parents, some kids find it easier than others to stay intellectually engaged and enthusiastic.</li>

<h2> Understanding Executive Function </h2>
<div> <h3> What are the different executive functions? </h3> </div>
<a>he human mind contains seven different executive functions</a>. These include self-awareness, inhibition, nonverbal working memory (
<a>short-term memory</a> related to sensory and spatial information), verbal working memory (short-term memory related to speech and language),
<a>emotional regulation</a>, motivational regulation, and planning and problem-solving. 
<div> <h3> Is executive functioning related to intelligence? </h3> </div>
<a>general intelligence</a> scores; some researchers have even proposed that
<div> <h3> How long does it take for the executive functions to fully develop? </h3> </div>
<a>into the mid-20s or even early 30s</a>. Children and teens who lag behind their peers in executive functioning may find that they have fewer challenges once they enter adulthood.

<h2> Problems with Executive Function </h2>
<div> <h3> What is executive function disorder (EFD)? </h3> </div>
<a>DSM-5</a>, though executive function-related symptoms do appear in other DSM conditions.
<div> <h3> What causes poor executive functioning? </h3> </div>
<a>prenatal exposure to drugs or alcohol</a>, early
<a>trauma</a>, or other factors. Sometimes, there is no discernible cause.
<div> <h3> What are signs of poor executive functioning? </h3> </div>
<a>executive functioning challenges</a> will find it more difficult than others in their age group to remember information, plan and execute tasks, keep items and information organized, and maintain
<a>motivation</a>. They may also struggle with emotional, impulse, or attentional control.
<div> <h3> Is executive function disorder (EFD) the same thing as ADHD? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is it possible to have both ADHD and executive function disorder (EFD)? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Executive function disorder, or EFD, is not an official diagnosis. However, it is possible—and in fact, quite likely—for someone with ADHD to also have significant challenges with executive functioning.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is my child so disorganized? </h3> </div>
<a>some children who wish to be organized but find it difficult may have poor executive functioning</a>. These children may struggle with the motivation, problem-solving, and planning that are required for staying organized.
