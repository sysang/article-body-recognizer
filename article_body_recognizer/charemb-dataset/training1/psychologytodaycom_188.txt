<a>dating</a> or other attempts to escape single life. It is a celebration of living single and all that single people contribute.
<p>Here are 20 of the reasons why we need Unmarried and Single Americans Week. (For a version of this list that includes links to relevant references, click <a>here</a>.)</p>
<p>2. We need it, because what it means to live single has changed dramatically over the past half-century, but our perceptions have not caught up. Bogus stereotypes rule, and they need to be dethroned.</p>
<p>4. We need Singles Week to underscore another message: Single life is not just a “good-enough” life. In more than 20 scientifically established ways, single life can be even better than married life.</p>
<a>discrimination</a>, and there are tax penalties, pay disparities, and other high and discriminatory costs to living single.
<a>sibling</a>, a nephew, or a close friend.
<p>10. We need it, because we have untapped political potential. For too many years, single people have been voting at lower rates than married people. If that changed, so would some of the most regressive policies in the nation.</p>
<a>Friendship</a>, not marriage, is the key relationship of the 21st century.
<a>social life</a>, something that people of all marital statuses can appreciate — that solitude can be sweet.
<p>16. We need Singles Week to urge people not to use “alone” and “unattached” as synonyms for single — those words are demeaning and untrue.</p>
<a>depressed</a> — even if they were still with the same romantic partner a year after the study started.
<p>20. We need to value single people, because that’s what progressive nations do. They look for the people who have been marginalized and diminished, and invite them into the center of society. That way, we can all live happily ever after.</p>

<h1> For Asexuals, Gays, and Lesbians, Adolescent Romance Is Especially Depressing </h1>

<a>depression</a>, drinking, and delinquencies, adolescents who do not become romantically involved are better off. That's what I wrote about in my
<a>previous post</a>. (Full reference to the study is below.)
<a>original post</a>, plus the fact that my post on
<a>ASEXUALS</a> from late 2009 has been one of the most popular of all of my posts, I've reconsidered.
<a>attraction</a> to either sex or attraction to people of the same sex. Depression deepened even more for them if they became romantically involved.
<p>The authors offered no possible explanations for why that might be. So if you have some ideas you are willing to share, please post them in the comments section.</p>

<a>happiness</a> and filled out a standardized measure of
<a>depression</a>. Other questions were also included. For example, during the first interview, they were asked how much they hoped they would be romantically involved during the coming year.
<p>The answer to that question is yes. Depression increases for those who become romantically involved for the first time. It increases for those who remain involved with the same person during the year or so in question.</p>
<p>Both male and female teens become more depressed if they become romantically involved than if they do not, but the increase in depression is even greater for the females.</p>
<p>Guess who else becomes especially more depressed over the course of the two interviews? Those who said that they very much wished they would be romantically involved in the next year (regardless of whether their wish comes true).</p>
<p>Happiness is not just the opposite of depression; it is measured separately. For girls, their happiness takes a hit if they become romantically involved. For boys, levels of happiness do not change with romantic involvement.</p>

<p>But it does not bring them happiness. Instead, they become more depressed, report more drinking problems, and engage in more delinquent behaviors than their peers who do not become romantically involved.</p>

<h1> Respect (or the Lack Thereof) in Relationships </h1>
<h2> Several forms of respect are needed to maintain healthy relationships. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Relationships Matter </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>It's a near-truism that healthy relationships are based on mutual respect, but it can be hard to nail down what respect means.</li>
<li>"Respect" is elusive in part because the term can denote several different psychological attitudes (or correlative behaviors).</li>
<li>Maintaining a healthy relationship requires the presence of several kinds of (mutual) respect.</li>
<a>intimate partner violence</a> she endured during her first
<a>marriage</a>. The violence began before they tied the knot. Her abuser Conor had convinced her to quit her job at the magazine Seventeen and leave New York City.
<p>Only days before their wedding, Steiner was struggling to finish a writing assignment in her small office when her computer froze. Frustrated, she cursed at the computer and slammed a fist on her desk.</p>
<p>The next thing she remembers is Conor storming into her office. To her dismay, she felt him place his hands around her neck:</p>
<blockquote> <p>His hands tightened around my throat. ... My eyes began to water. My body began to writhe involuntarily. <a>Panic</a> spread across my chest. (2009. p. 83) </p> </blockquote>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Karolina Grabowska/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Just before she passed out, Conor let go and left. Despite her initial shock and <a>fear</a>, Steiner quickly wrote off the "incident" as a "one-off" and went on to marry Conor—a very dangerous man.</p>
<h3>Respect Prevents Relationships From Turning Toxic</h3>
<p>It is obvious—even from the short quote above by itself—that Steiner and Conor's relationship was extremely toxic. But the worst was still to come.</p>
<p>Conor's physical, verbal, and sexual attacks on Steiner speak to his complete lack of respect for her.</p>
<p>It is a near-truism that mutual respect is essential for our relationships (romantic or otherwise) to thrive and that a lack of mutual respect can leave our relationships in tatters, or worse.</p>
<p>Despite knowing how important (mutual) respect is for keeping relationships from becoming malignant, most of us would be hard-pressed to say what we mean by respect.</p>
<p>To further complicate matters, more than one kind of respect bears on a relationship's health (or lack thereof). But this raises an intriguing question: Do all relationships (romantic or otherwise) call for the same kind(s) of respect?</p>
<h3>Kantian Respect: Respect Owed Equally to All Humans</h3>
<a>morality</a>, Kant argued that it's a fundamental moral maxim that all people are owed equal respect in virtue of their shared humanity, irrespective of their achievements, abilities, and qualities.
<p>As I have argued elsewhere, because domestic violence expresses a complete lack of Kantian respect, it is a form of dehumanization (Brogaard, 2020).</p>
<h3>Respect as Deep Admiration</h3>
<p>But through his nasty words and violent actions, Conor revealed that he also completely lacked other kinds of respect that are equally important for keeping relationships in a decent shape.</p>
<p>Another form of respect that is crucial to preventing relationships from turning toxic is respect in the sense of deep admiration—or holding someone in high esteem. This form of respect is salient in a sentence like:</p>
<p>"I respect her for her unwavering commitment to fighting economic inequality." </p>
<h3>Respect as Politeness or Civility</h3>
<p>Still another kind of respect that is crucial to keeping relationships civil is respect in the sense of politeness or civility. This form of respect is salient in a sentence like:</p>
<p>"I always try to show respect for others, e.g., saying 'thank you,' 'please,' and holding the door for them."</p>
<a>romantic relationship</a> from going sour, or worse.
<p>In contrast to Conor, Steiner respected her romantic partner in all the ways that matter to preventing a romantic relationship from ending up in ruins, or worse.</p>

<p>But Steiner lacked a different kind of respect for Conor, which could have helped protect her from his violence. We can call this kind of respect apprehensive respect, as it involves an element of caution or apprehension.</p>
<p>When we encourage others to respect the sea, it is apprehensive respect we have in mind. Similarly, we normally consider it prudent to have apprehensive respect for guns, fireworks, and crocodiles.</p>
<p>But it is equally commendable to adopt an attitude of apprehensive respect toward violent people like Conor, especially if you live with them.</p>
<p>There are still other forms of respect that matter to the health of relationships (romantic or otherwise). We dive into the five kinds of respect that all non-toxic relationships share in common in our next post.</p>

<h1> The Psychology of Feeling Sad About Not Having Children </h1>
<h2> Why do some people, but not others, find it painful not to have kids? </h2>
<li>“When people I know are <a>pregnant</a>, I feel sad.”</li>
<li>“When I see families with children, I feel left out.”</li>
<li>“I can’t help comparing myself with friends who have children.”</li>
<li>“The holidays are especially difficult for me because I don’t have children.”</li>
<li>“Family gatherings are especially difficult for me because I don’t have children.”</li>
<h3>Reasons for Not Having Kids</h3>
<p>Answers to other questions allowed the researchers to classify the women into four categories of reasons for not having children:</p>
<li>They have biomedical barriers (i.e., they meet the medical definition of <a>infertility</a>).</li>
<li>They face situational barriers (for example, they are not financially ready or they think their partner would not be a good parent).</li>
<li>They want to have kids and have no barriers; the authors believe that these women plan to have children later.</li>
<a>divorced</a> or separated, and always-single – did not differ in how badly they felt about not having kids.)
<h3>The Importance of Being a Parent and Social Pressures</h3>
<p>Let’s go a step further and explore the reasons for the pain. The authors examined two possibilities – the importance of motherhood to the women and the social pressures they faced.</p>
<p>The importance of motherhood was measured by agreement with statements such as:</p>
<ul><li>“I always thought I would be a parent.”</li> <li>“Having children is important to my feeling complete as a woman.”</li> <li>“I think my life will be more fulfilling with children.”</li> </ul>
<p>Two statements referred to social pressure:</p>
<ul><li>“It is important to my parents that I have children.”</li> <li>“It is important to my partner that we have children.”</li> </ul>
<p>(It would have been useful to include questions about perceived pressures from friends, from media messaging, from dynamics in the workplace, and so forth.)</p>
<a>judged a lot more harshly</a> than single people who wish they were coupled.
<a>identity</a> as a woman, then not getting that – not having children – really hurt.
