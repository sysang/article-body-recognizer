<div><div><p>The last time anyone reported seeing 7-year-old Harmony Montgomery was Oct. 1, 2019 — more than two years before police say they learned she had disappeared from a home in southern New Hampshire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Manchester is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to Harmony’s recovery, and police are accepting tips at 603-203-6060. Local business executives are offering an additional $10,000 reward.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Police over the weekend visited a home on the city’s west side, where Aldenberg said Harmony was once seen. The current homeowner is unrelated to the case, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sorey often seemed worried about her daughter and frequently said she could not reach her, Miller said. He said he and his husband recently made their own effort to reach Harmony’s father through social media but did not hear back.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Miller said his family had not given up on reuniting Jamison and his sister.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We even still get Christmas gifts for her and stuff,” Miller said. “We’re holding on to the ones that we have right now because it’s that important for us to have that relationship.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>A 3-year-old disappeared from a playground a week ago. She’s still missing.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Manchester police have discussed the case with the FBI, which is not investigating, Aldenberg said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the division for children and families, declined to answer questions about the case.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harmony is described as White, about 4 feet tall and 50 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and glasses. She is blind in her right eye.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although more than two years has passed since Harmony disappeared, Aldenberg said, his department is operating under the assumption that she is alive.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I’m in rescue mode right now. This is not a recovery,” he said Monday. “All efforts are focused on that Harmony is alive, and we are going to do everything that we can to find her in that condition.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>On the first morning of the new year, Andrew Koch was working at his computer in Pittsburgh when a thunder-like sound rumbled through his home.</p></div></div>
<p>He felt it in his chest more than he heard it, Koch said Tuesday. Only after Allegheny County, Pa., tweeted that there was “no explanation” for the loud noise did he check whether his home security cameras had captured the boom.</p>
<div><div><p>“If it had been clear, there would have been something 100 times brighter than the full moon moving from north to south in the Pittsburgh sky,” Cooke said. “That would have been pretty cool to see.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>When the scientists saw that an infrasound station had recorded noise around the same time as the Geostationary Lightning Mapper, the mystery appeared to be solved.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It left no doubt that what was located over western Pennsylvania on New Year’s Day was a bolide breaking apart,” Cooke said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>While meteor explosions tend to prompt fears of falling, flaming rocks, Cooke said damage caused by the blast’s pressure is a much more realistic concern. Movies about meteor explosions, he added, are usually not accurate.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But Cooke said he can’t speak to the specific imagery in “Don’t Look Up,” which is streaming on Netflix. He hasn’t seen it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Rocks falling out of the sky, that’s work,” Cooke said. “So I wait for it to come on cable.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Please keep all of these folks, and especially these children, in our prayers,” Mayor Jim Kenney (D) said at an emotional news conference. “Losing so many kids is devastating.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>The siblings each had multiple children, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer, but it remains unclear whether all of them were home at the time or how many of them may have died.
<div><div><p>“Everybody is still in shock,” Purifoy said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Firefighters said they arrived at the three-story, 2,300-square-foot rowhouse, operated by the Philadelphia Housing Authority, in the 800 block of North 23rd Street about 6:40 a.m. and saw flames shooting up from the second floor.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a news release Wednesday night that revised the number of dead, the city said firefighters removed “one child from the building, but the child did not survive.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Witnesses told local media that they were awakened by screams coming from the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Loved ones, many warmed by blankets, formed a prayer circle nearby. Vanessa Price, 46, said she was a cousin of a family that lived in the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s our brothers, sisters, daughters,” she said of the fire victims. “We just got to keep them in prayer.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Price said it was particularly sad that so many were children. “They didn’t get a chance to experience life,” she said. “It’s a loss people don’t want to wake up to.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Alice Wright, 80, said she cried in her home before walking three blocks to the scene of the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just wanted to see what I could do,” said Wright, a lifelong Philadelphian. “Provide clothes — something.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Red Cross said it is providing emergency assistance for a family of five people displaced by the fire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The blaze was brought under control about 50 minutes after the firefighters arrived, officials said. Officials had not determined the fire’s origin or how smoke detectors failed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The home had a number of working smoke detectors, powered by lithium batteries meant to last 10 years, at its last inspection, Murphy said, but several were not operating at the time of the fire.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Everybody in this neighborhood gets along,” he said, standing by his porch with a cigar in hand. “It’s a good place to raise kids.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Section 230: The little law that defined how the Internet works</h1></div>
<h2>Often called the law that ‘created the Internet,’ the legal section is under fire again. So what is it?</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Lerman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 30, 2020</div></div>
<div><p>Trump, Republicans seize on new stimulus debate to take aim at an old foe: Big tech</p></div>
<p>The law has been a point of contention between Trump and social media companies all year. The president even signed an executive order in May intended to pave the way for federal regulators to punish tech companies for how they moderate content.</p>
<div><p>Facebook and Twitter take unusual steps to limit spread of New York Post story</p></div>
<div><div><p>So what is this law, anyway?</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trump readies executive order targeting Facebook, Google and Twitter, sparking widespread criticism about threats to free speech</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is Section 230?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The key portion of Section 230 is only 26 words long and reads, “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Why does it matter?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it was not designed to keep online forums neutral, Keller said. In fact, she said, it was meant to encourage companies to keep an eye on the conversations on their sites.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Section 230 “was very specifically crafted to get platforms to moderate content,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it also means that companies get to moderate that content however they see fit, with little regulation to confine them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Why should we care now?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Trump says Twitter is trying to ‘silence’ conservatives. His growing number of followers suggests otherwise.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Who wants Section 230 to be changed?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Democrats and Republicans both have expressed concern over the limits of 230 in recent years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some Republicans have pushed back on the immunity tech companies have to take down most types of content, asserting that companies are acting with bias toward conservatives.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>FCC push to rethink legal protections for tech giants marks major turn amid months of political pressure</span></p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How did the provision come to be?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wanting to circumvent that and encourage companies to moderate their sites, Section 230 was created.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The idea behind 230 was that the platforms were much better suited to come up with the rules of the road than the government,” Kosseff said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The idea was that people would use whichever sites suited them and had rules they agreed with. Of course, that was years before the rise of dominant social media sites with billions of users.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some have criticized tech companies for hiding behind the law and taking a hands-off approach to moderating content on their sites, rather than using the law to be more engaged in moderating, as its creators had envisioned.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>She pointed to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg as the enforcer of this system, arguing that he controls the most important decisions made at the company.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Former Facebook employee Frances Haugen revealed as ‘whistleblower’ behind leaked documents that plunged the company into scandal</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Until the incentives change, Facebook will not change. Left alone, Facebook will continue to make choices that go against the common good, our common good,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think the time has come for action, and I think you are the catalyst for that action,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told Haugen during the hearing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook Crisis: Interview with John Tye, Whistleblower Attorney</p></div>
<div><p>Congress is not as clueless about Facebook as it seems</p></div>
<p>After weeks of silence on Haugen’s revelations, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushed back on her testimony in an email to employees on Tuesday, writing that it’s “just not true” that the company prioritizes profit over safety.</p>
<div><div><p>He said he was particularly concerned about the questions being raised about Facebook’s impact on kids, and he committed to doing more research on the issue and making research publicly available.</p></div></div>
<p>“Facebook could do substantially more to detect more of those children, and they should have to publish for Congress those processes … they could be much more effective than probably what they’re doing,” Haugen said.</p>
<div><p>Zuckerberg’s apologies have been a staple of Facebook scandals. Now, the company offers defiance.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“People stay or leave the company based on what they get paid, and if you hurt MSI, a bunch of people aren’t going to get their bonuses,” Haugen said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Facebook could shift to posts being ranked in other ways, such as chronologically, and still remain profitable, she said. That argument resonated with lawmakers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She proposed changing Section 230 to make Facebook responsible for “the consequences of their intentional ranking decisions.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“No apology, no admissions, no acknowledgment, nothing to see here, we are going to deflect it and go sailing,” said Blumenthal, referencing the CEO’s frequent social media photos of his activities on the water.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Blumenthal is hopeful that Haugen’s decision to speak will inspire other tech workers who wish to expose similar concerns.</p></div></div>

<div><p>So it may come as a surprise to some that aggressive antitrust enforcement is not in fact one of Haugen’s recommendations. “I’m actually against the breaking-up of Facebook,” she said in Tuesday’s hearing.</p></div>
<div><div><p>That’s not to say there aren’t very good arguments out there for breaking up Facebook. It’s just that such an intervention would be unlikely to solve, on its own, the problems Haugen is most concerned with.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), the committee’s top Republican, said of issuing subpoenas: “It should be discussed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Klobuchar said just getting more information from the company won’t be enough, though.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We can investigate and investigate. We need action,” she told The Post.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Haugen said she believes Facebook would still be a profitable company if it did away with engagement-based ranking, which prioritizes content that users are most likely to click on or react to.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A lot of the changes I’m talking about are not going to make Facebook an unprofitable company,” she said. “It just won’t be a ludicrously profitable company like it is today.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She argued that if Facebook were less toxic and had more oversight, there’s a possibility Facebook could be more profitable over the long term.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>That often plays out as a battle of analogies: To get our heads around what type of problem Facebook represents, we naturally turn to disruptive technologies and problematic industries of the past.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Whistleblower Frances Haugen and lawmakers at Tuesday’s hearing have repeatedly compared Big Tech to Big Tobacco — as purveyors of products that are addictive and profitable but ultimately bad for us.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When we realized Big Tobacco was hiding the harms, that caused the government to take action,” Haugen said, calling on lawmakers to do the same with Facebook.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook is like chairs. No, telephones. No, cars. No …</p></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who chairs the Senate consumer-protection subcommittee, has said Facebook is “facing a Big Tobacco moment, a moment of reckoning.”</p></div></div>
<p>It’s becoming clear that Facebook’s path to wide acceptance is unlikely to avoid regulation. Now the question is exactly what laws, if any, could make us as comfortable with Facebook as we are with telephones and the printing press.</p>

<div><div><p>The hearing has reconvened. So far, Frances Haugen has come across as measured and credible, even noting at several moments that she did not work on specific issues that she was being questioned about.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Brian Boland, a former Facebook vice president who resigned last year, criticized the response as not transparent.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div>By Cristiano Lima12:08 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<div><div><p>Senators have repeatedly pressed Facebook executives to pledge that the company will not retaliate against the whistleblower behind the recent string of damaging leaks, since revealed to be Frances Haugen.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But while one Facebook official committed to the company not seeking retribution, another left wiggle room for the tech giant to come after Haugen for disclosing internal research.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That leaves the door open for Facebook to potentially take legal action against Haugen for disclosing the documents to the Wall Street Journal, which based a series of reports on her leaks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Haugen, who revealed her identity on “60 Minutes,” has filed complaints against Facebook to the Securities and Exchange Commission, alleging the company misled investors, according to CBS.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>According to her lawyers, she has sought whistleblower protections with the SEC.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Section 230: The little law that defined how the Internet works</h1></div>
<h2>Often called the law that ‘created the Internet,’ the legal section is under fire again. So what is it?</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Lerman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 30, 2020</div></div>
<div><p>Trump, Republicans seize on new stimulus debate to take aim at an old foe: Big tech</p></div>
<p>The law has been a point of contention between Trump and social media companies all year. The president even signed an executive order in May intended to pave the way for federal regulators to punish tech companies for how they moderate content.</p>
<div><p>Facebook and Twitter take unusual steps to limit spread of New York Post story</p></div>
<div><div><p>So what is this law, anyway?</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trump readies executive order targeting Facebook, Google and Twitter, sparking widespread criticism about threats to free speech</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is Section 230?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The key portion of Section 230 is only 26 words long and reads, “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.”</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Why does it matter?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it was not designed to keep online forums neutral, Keller said. In fact, she said, it was meant to encourage companies to keep an eye on the conversations on their sites.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Section 230 “was very specifically crafted to get platforms to moderate content,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it also means that companies get to moderate that content however they see fit, with little regulation to confine them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Why should we care now?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Trump says Twitter is trying to ‘silence’ conservatives. His growing number of followers suggests otherwise.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Who wants Section 230 to be changed?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Democrats and Republicans both have expressed concern over the limits of 230 in recent years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some Republicans have pushed back on the immunity tech companies have to take down most types of content, asserting that companies are acting with bias toward conservatives.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>FCC push to rethink legal protections for tech giants marks major turn amid months of political pressure</span></p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How did the provision come to be?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wanting to circumvent that and encourage companies to moderate their sites, Section 230 was created.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The idea behind 230 was that the platforms were much better suited to come up with the rules of the road than the government,” Kosseff said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The idea was that people would use whichever sites suited them and had rules they agreed with. Of course, that was years before the rise of dominant social media sites with billions of users.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some have criticized tech companies for hiding behind the law and taking a hands-off approach to moderating content on their sites, rather than using the law to be more engaged in moderating, as its creators had envisioned.</p></div></div>

<p>“I had a Black friend. I liked her and I think she liked me, too,” tweeted state Rep. Patricia Morgan, who is White. “But now she is hostile and unpleasant. I am sure I didn’t do anything to her, except be White.”</p>
<div><div><p>She added: “Is that what teachers and our political leaders really want for our society? Divide us because of our skin color?<b> </b>#CRT”</p></div></div>
<div><p>A White teacher taught White students about White privilege. It cost him his job.</p></div>
<div><p>Morgan, who is considered one of the most prominent Republicans in Rhode Island, previously served as minority leader of the state house, the first woman to hold the title. She ran for governor in 2018 but lost in the GOP primary.</p></div>
<a>RI H6070</a>, failed to pass in June.
<a> Providence Journal </a>in April. “Dr. Martin Luther King’s ‘I Had a Dream Speech’ said we should not judge anyone by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.”
<div><div><p>Morgan told The Post that she believes her support of the bill cost her the friendship of her “Black friend,” whom she did not name.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was really happy to see her and we always joked with one another,” she said. “She’s a bright, smart, strong woman. I really like her.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That changed, she said, when Morgan ran into her at a recent Christmas party and felt like she was being ignored.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was saddened that there was a coldness,” Morgan said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>I’m your black friend, but I won’t educate you about racism. That’s on you.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Democrats and Republicans were quick to denounce Morgan’s “Black friend” tweet. Those critics included Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi (D).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no place for divisive remarks by any House member,” Shekarchi said in a <a>statement</a>. “I condemn any such comments.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Republican state Rep. Barbara Ann Fenton-Fung echoed Shekarchi. The GOP lawmaker tweeted a photo and quote from South African Nobel Peace Prize-winning icon Desmond Tutu, who died Sunday, and urged Morgan to do better.</p></div></div>
<a>wrote</a>. “Patty, want more friends? Stop looking at the color of their skin instead look at the size of their heart.”
<div><p>Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, a Democrat who is running for governor, <a>tweeted</a> that Morgan’s comments do not reflect the diversity of Rhode Island, which she called “the strength of our state.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Her comments are ignorant and embarrassing,” Gorbea wrote. “Rhode Island deserves leaders who bring people together, not recklessly divide us.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The BLM RI PAC called on Shekarchi to remove Morgan from all her state House committees, saying her tweet was “offensive and deeply insulting to the Black and Brown community.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Anything less than these substantive actions is another tacit acceptance of racism from the General Assembly that can no longer be tolerated,” the PAC <a>tweeted</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Lofton lost consciousness at the Sedgwick County Juvenile Intake and Assessment Center and never regained consciousness before he died, the report states.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Rev. Maurice W. Evans, the spokesman for Lofton’s parents, put it more bluntly: “This position is used to submit an animal. It’s not how you handle a human being.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Officials with the Sedgwick County Department of Corrections, the officers’ employer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<p>Bennett said the investigation conducted by agents with the Kansas Bureau of Investigation and the Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Office is ongoing. He added that his office anticipates completing its review of the autopsy report by next month.</p>
<div><div><p>Officials with the Sedgwick County Department of Corrections, the officers’ employer, declined to comment and shared Bennett’s statement in an email.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The autopsy also found that Lofton, who Hart said weighed 135 pounds “soaking wet,” had tested positive for the <a>coronavirus</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Evans and Hart said Lofton’s family is pushing for all evidence to be released to the public. Hart said authorities triggered “a cascade of errors” that eventually led to the teen being placed in the prone position.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“What type of threat was that child? Why would they put him the in prone position?” he said. “They literally suffocated this kid.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Evans noted that “the level of heartbreak has been indescribable” for the family over the past few months. He remains infuriated over how the 17-year-old died.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t want this to be glossed over as him dying in the prone position. They violently beat and killed a child, let’s not sugarcoat it,” he said. “This is a crime against humanity.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Since it was first detected in southern Africa late last year, the highly contagious coronavirus variant has sparked restrictions on business activity in several countries.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Portraits from inside the wild, messy, confounding, overheating economy of 2021</p></div>
<div><p>“The mood in the market is that it’s not going to be that big a deal economically,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist for TD Securities. “The hope is it’ll be over in a month.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>With omicron threatening, the hotel limited attendance to 15 to 20 percent of capacity and sent non-guests home at 11 p.m., said Adam Zembruski, program director for Hospiamo, an adviser to the Horton’s owners.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So far, four out of the hotel’s roughly 25 workers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and managers are eyeing additional restrictions if needed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s an everyday conversation. We could close the bars. We talked about that just last night,” he said earlier this week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the virus poses an acute problem for businesses that deal with the public, manufacturers also are crafting new strategies to keep their machines turning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Business is good at J.V. Manufacturing, a die and component maker in Natrona Heights, Pa. As orders flooded in over the past year, the company added about 40 new employees, taking its payroll to 137 workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now the company is considering an increased push for robotics and digitization to make production less vulnerable to missing workers, she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I definitely think it’s here to stay,” she said of the virus. “It’s just about finding a way to balance it, finding what risks are worth taking and what risks aren’t worth taking.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There aren’t more people to come to help right now,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Last on the rung’: Africa deals with fallout from a Made-in-the-USA supply chain crisis</p></div>
<div><div><p>Elsewhere, executives worry about a possible resurgence of global <a>supply chain bottlenecks</a> triggered by harsh coronavirus clampdowns in China, where the government maintains a “zero-covid” policy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The greatest risk to the U.S. economy is how non-U.S. governments choose to respond to it,” said Frances Donald, global chief economist and strategist for Manulife Investment Management.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The company purchased scores of masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, and spread its workers across two shifts in a bid to avoid infections. Later, it added air-quality monitors and filtration devices to meet a shifting threat.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a result, Habco went months before seeing its first worker test positive and had only a handful idled before omicron appeared. In the past few weeks, more employees tested positive as the variant ran wild in Connecticut.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re doing everything we can to protect our employees,” he said. “My concern is more what I can’t control.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Habco’s production depends upon a number of local parts suppliers. If just one or two of their workers are taken ill, it might paralyze their production of critical components, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Throughout the pandemic, Habco gave employees plenty of time to deal with family responsibilities. But as the virus appears to be evolving into a less lethal form, Montanari wonders how long that stance can be sustained.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve got a business to run,” he said. “I’ve got customers who need product and they don’t care about my employees’ child-care problems.”</p></div></div>

<a>anti-LGBTQ</a> hate crimes. While

<div><div><p><a>Our key finding</a> is that, regardless of one’s party identification, greater animus toward African Americans, Hispanics, Muslims, <i>or</i> the LGBTQ community predicted substantially greater support for Trump.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>SAN FRANCISCO — The sister of a slain federal officer is suing Facebook’s parent company Meta, alleging it bears responsibility for her brother’s killing during racial justice protests in 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Facebook facilitated the hateful far-right<b> </b>“boogaloo” movement, leading an adherent to murder officer Dave Patrick Underwood, the lawsuit filed in a California Superior Court late Wednesday alleges.</p></div></div>
<div><p>An officer was gunned down. The killer was a ‘boogaloo boy’ using nearby peaceful protests as cover, feds say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The suit alleges wrongful death and a survival action for the pain and suffering Underwood endured before he died, citing alleged general negligence and negligent design by Facebook.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Facebook pushed back against the allegations on Thursday.</p></div></div>
