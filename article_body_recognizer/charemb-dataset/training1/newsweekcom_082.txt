<a>according</a> to The New York Times.
<p>"This case is about a black Muslim immigrant," protester Ahmednur Abdirahman told the paper. "They are worried about disappointing the white community. For that reason, justice was not served today."</p>
<p>While Noor was initially sentenced to more than 12 years in prison, he was not given the harshest possible sentence. The former officer was eligible for up to 25 years in prison on his original murder conviction and up to 10 years for manslaughter.</p>
<p>On Thursday, a jury in Minnesota found former police officer Kim Potter guilty of first and second-degree manslaughter in connection with the fatal shooting of Daunte Wright.</p>
<p>The 12-member jury's decision came after it had deliberated for nearly 30 hours.</p>
<p>Potter had been charged with two counts— first and second-degree manslaughter — after shooting and killing Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota in April.</p>
<p>Potter had maintained that the shooting was accidental and that she meant to grab her Taser, but mistakenly grabbed her gun and fatally shot Wright during a traffic stop.</p>
<p>Potter's attorney, Earl Gray, contended that a mistake isn't a crime and said that Wright was to blame for trying to flee from police, arguing that he "caused his own death."</p>
<p>Prosecutors urged the jury to find her guilty, arguing that the death of Wright, a Black man, had been preventable.</p>
<p>"This was a colossal screw-up, a blunder of epic proportions. It was precisely the thing she had been warned about for years, and she was trained to prevent it. It was irreversible, and it was fatal," Eldridge added.</p>
<p>Civil rights attorneys representing Wright's family released a statement responding to the verdict on Thursday.</p>
<p>"We must now turn our attention to ensuring that Kim Potter receives the strongest and most just sentence possible," the attorneys added.</p>
<p>However, prosecutors have said that they will try to get more jail time in this case.</p>
<p>Following the jury's verdict, Potter's attorneys argued that she shouldn't be held without bail before her sentencing hearing, and said Potter wouldn't commit another crime.</p>
<p>"It is the Christmas holiday season," Potter's attorney, Paul Engh, said according to the Associated Press. "She's a devoted Catholic, no less, and there is no point to incarcerate her at this point in time."</p>
<p>However, Judge Regina Chu did not accept that request.</p>
<p>"I cannot treat this case any differently than any other case," she said.</p>
<p>Update 12/23/2021, 3:35 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with additional information about the court hearing Thursday, and a statement from attorneys representing the Wright family.</p>
