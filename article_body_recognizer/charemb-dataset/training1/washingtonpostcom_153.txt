<div><p>2021 Holiday Gift Guide: Ideas for everyone on your list</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Union Market District</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>This NoMa neighborhood is always teeming with people. Union Market itself features more than two dozen food vendors, and the streets surrounding it have more than enough to keep you entertained, full and shopping all day long.</p></div></div>
<a><b>the Village DC</b></a> (1272 Fifth St. NE), where you can snack on a seasonal cinnamon sugar Cronut (warmed, of course). The coffee shop has plenty of vegan and gluten-free options for weary shoppers, as well as a large selection of teas and coffees.
<a>the Other Cat</a> (embroidery and alcohol ink art),
<a>Niftee Nest</a> (African print decor and gifts) and
<a>London Wick Candle Co</a>. (Don’t worry if you miss Neighbors at Union Market, it also will run pop-ups at the Brookland Arts Walk Dec. 4 and 18.)
<div><p>9 spots for outdoor ice skating in the D.C. area</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Old Town Alexandria</div></h3></div></div>
<p>With cobblestone streets and colonial-era architecture, Old Town Alexandria is always picture perfect. But it really shines during the holidays, and not just because of the illuminated streets and Christmas wreaths decorating stately homes.</p>
<a><b>Boxwood</b></a> (128 S. Royal St.), and then head over to
<div><p>Where to find holiday markets around the D.C. area</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Hyattsville</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Downtown Hyattsville’s funkier, edgier side makes it the perfect place for hard-to-shop-for friends. (Free parking through the holidays is an added bonus.)</p></div></div>
<a><b>Pyramid Atlantic Art Center </b></a>(4318 Gallatin St.) is known for its
<b>the Shops at SoHy</b> building (5132 Baltimore Ave.), but they flow together seamlessly. While you’re wandering through the maze of shelves that make up
<a><b>My Dead Aunt’s Books</b></a>, a used bookstore with well-stocked African American and local-interest sections, your eye might be caught by the vintage kimonos and brooches at
<a><b>Suffragette City</b></a>, or a shelf of 1950s barware. There are bins of 1960s records to flip through, and restored furniture that you might just want to bring home yourself.
<a><b>Sangfroid Distilling</b></a> (5130 Baltimore Ave.), which specializes in fruit brandies and Dutch gin;
<b>Franklins Brewery </b>(next to the General Store), where sours and maltier beers, such as Rubber Chicken Red, are stars; and
<a><b>Streetcar 82 Brewing</b></a> (4824 Rhode Island Ave.), which has an expansive outdoor patio and was
<a>founded by a trio of Gallaudet graduates</a>.

<a>Describing their sound </a>as post-emo and queer metal, Spring Silver explores their innermost feelings with experimental, danceable and genre-melding methods. On their song “Plead Insanity,” which features vocals from producer and musician
<a>PaperJam</a>’s third issue at Lost City Books. The D.C. DIY music zine and the Adams Morgan bookstore teamed up for a previous zine launch; this one also features a musical performance from

<div><div><p>The cause was end-stage renal failure, said her sister Gwenda Motley. Dr. hooks had been on the faculty of Berea College since 2004, serving as distinguished professor in residence in Appalachian studies.</p></div></div>

<a>Betty Friedan’s</a> 1963 bestseller “The Feminine Mystique.”
<div><div><p>The fourth of seven children, Gloria Jean Watkins was born in Hopkinsville, Ky., on Sept. 25, 1952. Her father was a janitor for the Postal Service, and her mother worked as a maid for White families across town.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I began to feel estranged and alienated,” she wrote, “from the huge group of white women who were celebrating the power of ‘sisterhood.’”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Survivors include a brother and four sisters.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>New Year’s Eve</b></p></div></div>
<p>Whether you view New Year’s Eve as a cause for celebration, an “Amateur Night” full of sloppy revelers in overcrowded bars or somewhere in between, there are a few things you need to remember before heading out on Friday night:</p>
<div><p>This year, New Year’s Eve might look a lot like every other night</p></div>
<div><div><p>Some bars still put time limits on tables, especially outdoors. Double-check before you make that 9 p.m. reservation, because you might not be able to keep your seats until midnight.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><a><b>Chicken and Whiskey</b></a>: The “hidden” whiskey bar in the back of the 14th Street rotisserie chicken joint features music from DJ Welby, beginning at 8 p.m., and a midnight margarita toast.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><a><b>Pitchers and A League of Her Own</b></a>: The multilevel Adams Morgan LGTBQ bar is turning its dance floor area into a Times Square viewing party amid <a>coronavirus</a> concerns, but plans to be open otherwise.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Richie Moriarty’s spirited path to starring in CBS’s ‘Ghosts’</h1></div>
<h2>As a kid in Rockville, he had them rolling in the aisles at the school talent show. It took a lot longer to find his next hit.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Anying Guo</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><i>A previous version of this story omitted Sasappis, one of the characters in “Ghosts.” This story has been updated.</i></p></div></div>
<a>a video of the performance</a> on YouTube, he added subtitles.)
<div><p>This was his first foray into performance after moving to Rockville, Md., at age 5, and though he has never really done stand-up again, he remembers that flicker of joy when hearing an audience respond to his jokes in real time.</p></div>
<div><p>His love of performance has led to an acting<b> </b>career, dabbling in a little bit of everything — improv, commercials, voice-over work — before landing a role as Pete on the CBS comedy<b> </b>“Ghosts.”</p></div>
<b> </b>(“It’s very comfortable, though,” says Moriarty, who just has to watch how he walks through doorways.)
<b> </b>“I hate getting walked through,” Pete observes. “It’s probably the worst pain I can think of. No, wait —
<i>arrow through the neck.</i> That beats it.”
<div><div><p>Show creators Joseph Wiseman and Joe Port were likewise captivated by Moriarty. He was one of the first actors they saw for Pete, and saw how Moriarty could play up Pete’s dorkiness without painting him into caricature.</p></div></div>
