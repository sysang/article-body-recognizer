<div><p>At-home covid tests and omicron: What you need to know</p></div>
<b> </b>to add a throat swab has been gaining attention on social media recently, at the same time that concerns have been rising about the efficacy of at-home tests. The FDA

<b> </b>symptoms appear to be starting earlier in people infected with omicron, “there is a chance the virus isn’t yet growing in the nose when you first test,”
<a>tweeted</a> epidemiologist and testing expert
<a>Michael Mina</a>, a vocal advocate of rapid testing who recently left his academic and research positions at Harvard and is now chief science officer for the biotech software company eMed.
<div><div><p>“Virus may start further down,” Mina continued. “Throat swab + nasal may improve chances a swab picks up virus.”</p></div></div>
<a>Eric Feigl-Ding</a>, an epidemiologist and senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists, agreed. “#Omicron is very different from all other variants,” he
<a>tweeted</a>. “We need to adapt to changing testing strategies.”
<div><div><p>Those research papers were released as preprint articles, meaning formal peer review of the work has not been completed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Feigl-Ding also said other countries, such as <a>Canada</a> and the <a>United Kingdom</a>, have authorized testing options that use throat swabs along with nasal swabs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the FDA, which issues emergency use authorizations for coronavirus tests, has strongly discouraged deviating from the specific instructions that accompany test kits.</p></div></div>
<p>“The FDA advises that COVID-19 tests should be used as authorized, including following their instructions for use regarding obtaining the sample for testing,” the federal agency said in an emailed statement to The Post on Wednesday.</p>
<a>recommends</a> that throat swabs should be collected by a trained health-care provider.)
<div><div><p>Other epidemiologists and testing experts echoed the FDA’s warning and said testing guidance should not change until there is more data.</p></div></div>
<p>“There’s a lot of work under the hood that has to be done for these companies to pivot to a new sampling method,” said <a>Albert Ko</a>, an infectious-disease physician and epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health.</p>
<a> Yuka Manabe</a>, who runs the Center for Innovative Diagnostics for Infectious Diseases at Johns Hopkins University, emphasized that it is “not the way the tests were designed to be used.”
<div><div><p>At this point in the pandemic, Manabe’s recommendation for testing is simple: “You should use at-home tests as the instructions for use tell you to use them,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is an interesting topic, but requires careful investigation and any test differing from manufacturer claims need to be rigorously validated before implementation,” LeBlanc said.</p></div></div>
<a>Matthew J. Binnicker</a>, the director of clinical virology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. “I don’t know what that false positive rate becomes with a throat swab included in the mix,” he said.
<a>noted</a> that while the strategy does “likely improve sensitivity,” it “may potentially cause a slightly greater number of false positives.” He recommended not eating or drinking 30 minutes before swabbing.

<div><div><p>Journalists and union leaders decried Monday’s development — the latest in a saga of corporate consolidation and changing ownership in an industry suffering from accelerating rounds of cutbacks and layoffs.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Still, “it really scares me” to think of an Alden takeover, she said, citing its reputation for cost-cutting. “This will lead to fewer journalists and less journalism,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Experts shared her sentiment. “Lee ran their properties in a very tight way,” Edmonds said, “but Alden will go further.”</p></div></div>
<a> Roanoke newsletter</a>, said an Alden takeover of more than a dozen Lee-owned news outlets in Virginia would be “devastating.”
<div><div><p>“It’s really a dark day for anyone who cares about having reliable sources of news and information in their communities,” he said.</p></div></div>
<a>Pew Research Center</a>. But Alden’s cuts have been more aggressive — more than 70 percent of unionized staffers, according to data from the Communications Workers of America union. And its circulation losses
<b> </b>have been steeper, according to Alliance for Audited Media.
<div><div><p>The letter Alden sent Monday is a nonbinding proposal; the company said the offer would be an all-cash deal and it would not need financing, or an outside loan, to close the deal.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>During the Great Resignation, we’ve seen workers of all ages and experience levels increasingly willing and able to walk away from toxic workplaces and managers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, a few high-profile employers in sports, entertainment and other fields have been ridding themselves of employees whose behavior is ruining the work environment for everyone else.</p></div></div>

<div><p>General abuse or intimidation that might have been excused in bygone days as “perfectionism” or “just part of the job” is increasingly being seen for what it is: needless, destructive and counterproductive.</p></div>
<b> </b>Readers responding to a
<a>recent column </a>on rude, condescending and aggressive colleagues and managers shared examples of how they and their employers deal with them.
<b> </b>their behavior comes across as rude or overbearing. As a commissioned Air Force lieutenant recently out of college, Lisa Gossett of Manassas, Va., supervised personnel with lower rank, but greater age and experience.

<div><div><p>Prehn learned that people had been complaining about her boss for years, but management’s response was to shuffle the boss from office to office.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I had been reporting the abuse to my supervisor for two years only to discover that he was afraid of the bully himself and neglected to take it further for fear of retaliation,” she said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Meghan Leahy</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 9:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A: </b> This is a hot topic for many parents, myself included. I know putting young children to bed can feel like herding cats, but there is a whole other challenge when it comes to bedtime and tweens. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although you can mostly get a little kid to go to sleep, you truly learn that you have no control over your children when you try to force a tween to sleep. You simply cannot. And the battles that ensue are brutal.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Before working on a solution together, get serious about one topic: technology. We know that the blue light, endless gaming and rewards of social media create temptation, which will always trump good intentions and, therefore, sleep.</p></div>
<div><div><p>And as much as possible, get your children to move their bodies. Sunlight and exercise do more for sleep than any rule you make, so do your best to ensure that they are physically tired. Good luck.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><i>Obviously, I am not a primary mourner, since I was not a family member or close friend, but I want to be respectful. I am not sure if black-bordered stationery is over the top in this case.</i></p></div></div>
<div><p>She doubts that the survivors here are using black-bordered paper, and would be surprised if you could even find any. But you need not try. Using it would be the written equivalent of showing up at the funeral covered in black veils.</p></div>
<div><div><p>What would be of comfort to the widow is a heartfelt letter testifying to her late husband's kindness and expressing your last appreciation. Surely your son will also write such a letter.</p></div></div>
<div><p><i><b>Dear Miss Manners</b></i><i>: When seated at a restaurant at which one’s cutlery is wrapped in the napkin (linen or otherwise), does one unwrap the cutlery upon being seated, upon ordering or when the food is served?</i></p></div>

<div><div><p><b>Who are these “others”</b> who sit around concocting ridiculous etiquette rules, unsupported by either practicality or common sense?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Of course you put your napkin on your lap after being seated, even though it requires you to set your own flatware. There is no point in waiting until you have something to mop up.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Ask Amy: Married man questions platonic friend’s intentions</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amy Dickinson</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 12:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Dear Amy</b></i><i>: I am a 39-year-old married man. I made a friend two years ago at work. She is 39, divorced and lives alone. Our friendship built up over time and is solid.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I once felt that she wanted to give me a long hug but then walked away. (This was a very strong vibe.)</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I had a quick and honest talk about her behavior. She confirmed that things are platonic, but I can’t shake off these vibes.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>During some conversations, the look in her eyes does tell me that something is up.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>She has anxiety and depression and is on meds.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>How should I manage this?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Should I assume that she isn’t having feelings?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I am not someone who gives up on friends, but at the same time, I can’t handle it if she develops feelings for me.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>— KK</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An analogy I appreciate is to envision a structure — a house — where you and your wife are inside together. When others seek a friendship with you, they should knock on the door and be invited in.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Do not share deep and personal intimacies of your own life with her. Refrain from commenting too deeply when she confides in you.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Do not communicate with her outside of work.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Establishing firmer boundaries should help your friend to transition to a more appropriate relationship with you. It is important for her to recognize that you should not be her only friend and confidant.</p></div></div>
<p>It is important for you to recognize that any time you feel uncomfortable, you have the right (and responsibility) to respond in a way that protects you and your own interests, regardless of your perception of the other person’s needs.</p>
<div><div><p><i><b>Dear Amy:</b></i><i> I am fully vaccinated and had a booster shot, but I do not believe it is anyone’s business except for my medical providers.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I don’t want my response to sound as aggressive as that, however.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Can you help me with a friendlier, more diplomatic response?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>— Trying to Save Friendships</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Trying: </b>Like you, I believe in anyone’s right to hold their vaccination status privately, and I have guarded my own.</p></div></div>
<p>And then my rural hometown became the nexus point of an invasive viral spike and a family member became ill. And now I believe that — if answering this simple question helps someone else to feel less anxious and vulnerable — then, okay!</p>
<div><div><p>We now know that vaccination does not totally prevent the spread of this virus, but it helps.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You can politely answer, “I’d rather not disclose my own status, and I understand if that means we won’t be able to see one another for a while, but I look forward to seeing you when things settle down.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Given that many restaurants and public venues are now requiring proof of vaccination to enter, you may be facing a lonely few months, but your privacy and your principles will remain intact.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Ask Amy: Your friend has a drinking problem, and you don’t know what to do</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amy Dickinson</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 12:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Dear Amy</b></i><i>: My friend is a drunk. This is disgusting to watch.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>At several points over the years, when I have traveled with her, she has found ways to drink as a passenger in my car — often from a “water bottle” that has vodka in it.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>If I were stopped by police and they found open liquor within reach inside my car, I would be immediately fired from my job.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I have discussed this with my friend, but she has still violated my trust.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>She has gone to rehab, tried cold turkey and been hospitalized. She lost her job because of her alcoholism.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>She is an educated, vivacious, loving, caring friend who stood at my side when life kicked me in the head and heart as I dealt with the loss of my mother, and as other friends backed away.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I love our friendship.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I recently hosted a holiday celebration. I thought I was on alert, but I didn’t notice how much she was drinking.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I looked across the table and saw (once again) the half-opened eyes, mouth agape with food dribbling out, down her dress and onto the floor. Her face was almost in her plate. She spent the night passed out on my couch.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I have reached my limit. I spoke with her the next morning. She apologized profusely, but I realize that means nothing.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I would be mortified to be in that state of inebriation, but she doesn't seem to have any shame at all.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I want to include her when I entertain or go out with other friends, but I don’t want to watch her get drunk or have to take care of a drunk.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I don’t want to have to lock up my liquor when she is at my home.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I shouldn’t have to be the “liquor police” with her.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>What is there left to do?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>— Disgusted</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Disgusted:</b> You say that your friend has no shame, and yet you seem determined to shame her.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Think of her as an addict, not a “drunk.” Shelve your disgust and replace it with compassion for someone who has a disorder that is raging out of control. Look at all she has lost!</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You cannot save her from her addiction. But you needn't enable it, either.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stop chastising her. Tell her that you love her and that you value the gift of her friendship, but that she has relapsed, and you are worried about her. (Relapse is extremely common).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She needs professional help and rehab, as well as your ongoing compassion. Offer to research options with her, and encourage her to enter a program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i><b>Dear Amy:</b></i><i> I am blessed to have retired before the age of 50.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I am now in my mid-50s, and my life is great, but my in-laws think I should go back to work.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>We had a fairly okay relationship before my retirement, but now when I am around them, they tell me I am too young to retire, and this has caused a disconnect in our relationship.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I didn’t know there was an age requirement on retiring, as long as you are financially secure.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>How can I respond to this?</i></p></div></div>

<div><div><p>They might say, “Our folks never retired!” which would give you some insight into their backstory and point of view.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There is nothing wrong with a little disconnect between the generations, but I hope you won’t let this difference of opinion grow into anything more than that.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>— Letting Go Is Hard to Do</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Letting Go Is Hard to Do: </b>It is hard, I know, to let go of a bad first impression. It’s hard to see a friend with a guy you dislike.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Canning the nasty comments, though? Not hard. Which suggests you don't want to. Which means the question here is, why?</p></div></div>
<div><p>Maybe your friend is the one you have to let go. Not dump, but release, in the sense of accepting that she can't just drop everything for you anymore. She may still be your center, but you're not hers. Painful, maddening, sad, normal.</p></div>
<div><div><p>If you love your friend, then stop. Stop looking for missteps, stop aching to be right, and realize the best thing for your friend, and therefore for your friendship, would be for you to be wrong.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even if you are right and he's awful and the marriage tanks, then your friend will need someone to grieve with her — and she won't come to you if your unspoken “I told you so!” is whooping around the room.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now that I think about it, I'll adjust my first suggestion — don't let go of her. Let go of you, of your personal stake in their failure. Maybe then you'll find yourself more willing to embrace them both as they are.</p></div></div>
