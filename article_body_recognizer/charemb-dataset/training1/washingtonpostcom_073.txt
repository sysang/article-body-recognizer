<div><h1>Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian’s first black leader, on the challenge of making it ‘a place that matters’</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Peggy McGlone</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>August 30, 2019</div></div>
<p>He has a reputation as an affable storyteller and a leader with the smarts of a professor and the demeanor of your next door neighbor. So there was little doubt that Lonnie Bunch III would be a new kind of leader for the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<div><div><p>But would he be open to questions? Even this early in his tenure?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The following conversation has been edited for clarity and length.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>You are now leader of the world's largest complex of museums. How do you make or continue to make the Smithsonian Institution relevant? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>How do you do that? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>Can you give me an example from the National Museum of African American History and Culture that illustrates this vision? </p></div></div>
<b>Q: </b>Museums are grappling with questions of diversity and equity, and making all audiences feel welcome. Do you think it is important for visitors to see themselves reflected in the collection, in the staff? Can the Smithsonian accomplish this?
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>The Smithsonian staff is not fully integrated, though. It has a mostly African American security force, while the curators and other higher-paid positions are mostly white. How do you feel about that? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A: </b>You would never hear me say that the Smithsonian has the diversity that it needs. Are we where I want us to be? Not yet. <b/></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>The public response to African American Museum has been overwhelmingly positive. Did that surprise you?</p></div></div>
<div><p><b>A: </b> I’m overwhelmed by the way people respond. I knew it would be good. I knew that because these folks that worked for me were really good. But the way that it’s become this pilgrimage site . . .</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>It has made you into a celebrity, and that's not that typical for the museum world. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A: </b>That visibility continues to be the thing that is hardest for me. It’s also the thing that tells me that we really did touch the people the way we wanted to touch them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>What is the role of government in the arts and in museums in particular? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>The Smithsonian has managed to dodge the attacks that have targeted the National Endowment for the Arts and other federal cultural agencies. Why is that? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>You're the first historian, and the first individual unit director, in more than a half-century, to become secretary. How will you not play favorites?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>In your memoir, you're critical of some of interactions you had with secretaries you worked for. How will your inside knowledge help you, and do you view those battles differently now? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>What have the first months been like? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>How does this job compare to being founding director of the African American Museum? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A: </b>The most important work I’ll ever do was building that museum. Probably the most complicated work is this. So they’re both challenging in different ways.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>Does that make them harder to achieve? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>You grew up in Belleville, New Jersey, a blue-collar, mostly white town on the northern border of Newark …</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A: </b>I would say blue-collar <i>overwhelmingly</i> white town.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>How did your upbringing shape you, and does it still influence you?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>In your memoir, you recall a moment of frustration with a Smithsonian colleague and you write, "I almost went 'New Jersey' on him." What does that mean? </p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q: </b>Did you face any backlash on those decisions?</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>In July, The Post and the ICIJ first reached out to the Denver Art Museum about six relics linked to Latchford. In September, the museum removed the relics from the museum’s collection.</p></div></div>

<p>For decades, Douglas Latchford cut a romantic figure: The genial Englishman was an explorer of jungle temples, a scholar and a connoisseur seduced by the exquisite details of ancient sculpture.</p>
<p>“The sculpture and architecture created by the Khmer to honor their gods and their rulers are among the major artistic masterpieces of the world,” he wrote in the first of the three, “Adoration and Glory.”</p>

<div><h4>Key questions to better understand the offshore system</h4></div>
<div><div><div><h4> What is the offshore system?</h4><p>The offshore financial system offers privacy, which can provide an opportunity to hide assets from authorities, creditors and other claimants, as well as from public scrutiny.</p></div></div></div>
<h4> Why is it called offshore finance?</h4>
<div><div><div><div><h4> Is this legal? </h4><p>Offshore providers are typically established according to the laws of the country where they are located. But some clients have used offshore services in ways that are not legal.</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>While Latchford’s family members said the trusts were formed for tax purposes and estate planning, the secrecy surrounding them poses difficulties for investigators seeking to find and repatriate items that he may have looted.</p>
<p>“We will never give up pursuing the return of our heritage,” said Phoeurng Sackona, the Cambodian minister of culture and fine arts.</p>
<div>(Patrick Aventurier/Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images)</div>
<p>U.S. investigators continue to pursue the return of items from the Latchford operation, said two people close to the probe who were not authorized to discuss it.</p>
<p>The items identified by the reporting team probably represent only a small portion of those that were tied to Latchford and wound up in museums, because many such sales are private.</p>
<p>Museum officials said that they follow industry ethics guidelines, and that the standards for acquiring antiquities have evolved over the years.</p>
<p>Museums have been reluctant to return relics to their countries of origin, even items that displayed clear signs of looting, such as statues with severed feet.</p>
<p>The promised return covers only a portion of the relics Latchford handled. Many others were sold long ago, and neither those relics nor the financial proceeds from their sale will be part of any Latchford donation.</p>
<p>The collection included many items with well-documented ownership history, her statement said. The trusts were not used to obscure the origin of looted antiquities or the proceeds of their sale, it said.</p>
<p>Neither she nor her husband has been accused of wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Even among the exceptional personalities using offshore companies and trusts — the ultra-wealthy, compromised politicians or others seeking to elude authorities — Douglas Latchford stood out.</p>
<p>In the article, Latchford detailed the dangers of exploring ancient Khmer temples in a landscape still bearing the marks of warfare.</p>
<p>“Almost immediately,” Latchford wrote, “we found ourselves in the depths of the jungle walking along narrow overgrown paths flanked by ‘skull and crossbones’ on a red background, warning us of land mines.”</p>
<p>As a child, Latchford, who was born in Mumbai to a British banker and his wife in 1931, was fascinated by tales of abandoned temples in Rudyard Kipling’s “The Jungle Book,” he told interviewers.</p>
<p>It was a genuine obsession, friends said.</p>
<p>Latchford’s infatuation with Khmer artwork coincided with a hot market for antiquities looted from Cambodia and neighboring Thailand and Laos. All three countries were part of the Khmer Empire, which flourished from the 9th to 15th centuries.</p>
<p>“Many even justified the removal of artifacts from Cambodia as acts of rescue and presented collectors as saviors,” Chiu said.</p>
<p>Items that would fetch millions of dollars in the West were sold for a pittance by armed groups and desperate Cambodian villagers.</p>

<p>In the middle of the illicit trade was Latchford, who, according to prosecutors, trafficked in antiquities from the early 1970s until at least 2010.</p>
<p>“Hold on to your hat, just been offered this 56 cm Angkor Borei Buddha, just excavated, which looks fantastic. It’s still across the border, but WOW.”</p>
<p>None of this was widely known, however, until Latchford’s fall from grace began in 2011, the year he turned 80.</p>

<p>In relying on companies and trusts created in secrecy jurisdictions, Douglas Latchford joined an array of figures in the art world who have employed such entities to hold assets, often while engaged in theft or fraud.</p>

<div><div><p>Because the tragic events at the heart of the museum were witnessed by billions, visitors were going to bring their own stories to the exhibits. The museum decided to embrace their versions as part of a larger whole.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The minute you personalize history it is no longer something that happened to somebody else, at a distant point in time that has nothing to do with me,” Greenwald said. “It is now visceral and personal and real.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>A few months after taking the reins of one of the smaller Smithsonian museums in July, Ngaire Blankenberg removed 18 Benin Kingdom Court Style works from their cases, saying their presence was harmful.</p></div></div>
<p>“We need to develop trust and transparency among our core constituents in order to build a 21st-century African art museum,” she said. “A huge impediment to that conversation is to have stuff you shouldn’t have.”</p>
<div><p>A new Smithsonian initiative aims to help America deal with the history and legacy of racism</p></div>
<div><p>The panel is examining past collecting standards through a moral rather than legal lens. The new guidelines will require Smithsonian museums to dig into the circumstances behind their acquisitions and make an effort to address any wrongs.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The review will bring the entire institution in line with the practices he put in place at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which <b/>opened in 2016 with Bunch as its founding director.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is a moment to say, ‘We can be better,’ ” Bunch said. “By accepting our troubled past, we can point to a better future.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“It is giving voice to individuals, communities and institutions that have not always had a voice,” Kreamer said. “Engagement with communities will be part of curatorial practice going forward.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Blankenberg, the question of legal ownership is not the central concern.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The important thing is not so much this option or that option but who gets to decide,” she said. “Is there an equitable conversation between source communities and museums to decide what happens to the objects?”</p></div>

<p>And you get not just Emmett Till, the human cautionary tale whispering his warnings across six decades, but Till as he was in life, a brash, fun-loving boy who sang street-corner doo-wop badly and loved Jack Benny.</p>
<p>So “The Blood of Emmett Till” is a work critical not just to our understanding of something that happened in America in 1955 but of what happens in America here and now. It is a jolting and powerful book.</p>
<p>But it might have been even better.</p>
<p>“I want to tell you,” she tells Tyson. “Honestly, I just don’t remember. It was fifty years ago. You tell these stories for so long that they seem true.” </p>
<p>There is a small moment, though, when Bryant unburdens herself of an admission that any person with a spark of decency would consider self-evident.</p>
<p>“Nothing that boy did,” she tells Tyson, “could ever justify what happened to him.” </p>
<p>It hardly satisfies the need to see her wrestle with what she did. But it is, perhaps, the best she can do, even now.</p>

<header><div/><div><div><a>National Security</a></div></div><div><h1>Justice Department closes Emmett Till investigation without filing charges</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Devlin Barrett</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 7, 2021 at 11:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The Justice Department has closed the latest federal investigation into the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till in rural Mississippi, a case that horrified the country and galvanized the civil rights movement.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Till, a Black 14-year-old visiting from Chicago, was murdered after he was accused of whistling at and making sexual advances toward a White woman, Carolyn Bryant, during an interaction at Bryant’s grocery store in Money, Miss.</p></div>
<div><p>Federal authorities reopened the case three years ago, after a new book reported that Bryant had denied in an interview that Till had made any advances. In theory, that could have meant she lied in decades-old court proceedings.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Justice Department officials met Monday with members of Till’s family to inform them of the decision to close the case.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How the mother of Emmett Till sparked the civil rights movement</p></div>
<div><div><p>Till was kidnapped on Aug. 28, 1955, tortured and shot. His mangled body was found days later in the Tallahatchie River and taken to Chicago for burial. Thousands waited in line to bear witness.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Photographs of Till’s corpse — which at his mother’s insistence was kept in an open coffin for the world to see — became some of the most consequential images of racial violence against African Americans.</p></div>
<div><div><p>A 2017 book, “The Blood of Emmett Till,” by historian Timothy Tyson, includes the first-known interview with Bryant.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The book said Bryant told Tyson that Till had not come on to her sexually, a disclosure that directly contradicted her testimony six decades earlier, when she told a jury that Till grabbed her by the waist and uttered obscenities.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“That part’s not true,” Tyson quotes Bryant, now in her late 80s, as saying. “Nothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Read the FBI’s explanation for why it closed the probe in the Emmett Till case</p></div>
<div><div><p>Tyson said years ago that someone from the FBI contacted him a few months after his book was published and he gave the FBI agent “everything he wanted to see.” His research materials were subpoenaed, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>The death and history of Emmett Till fades in this Mississippi town</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>He said he does not know why Donham decided to talk to him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve wondered that myself, but I can’t read her mind,” Tyson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Federal and state officials have reinvestigated the murder case in recent decades, but none of the probes have resulted in new charges.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2004, the Justice Department was asked to consider prosecuting other subjects who may have been involved in Till’s slaying. The FBI reopened the investigation, and Till’s body was exhumed in 2005.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But officials later decided it had no jurisdiction because the statute of limitations had expired on potential federal crimes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2007, the case was referred to the state prosecutor for Mississippi’s Fourth Judicial District, but a grand jury declined to issue new charges.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>More than 65 years after Emmett Till packed his bags to visit relatives in Mississippi, the red brick Victorian house where he grew up has been designated a historic landmark by the Chicago City Council.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Emmett Till’s mother opened his casket and sparked the civil rights movement</p></div>
<div><div><p>The murder demonstrated the grip of racism, segregation and white supremacy on the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A few days after Emmett arrived in Mississippi, he and his cousins went to buy candy at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market. Emmett allegedly whistled at Carolyn Bryant, a White woman who worked at the store.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That night, on Aug. 28, 1955, the woman’s husband, Roy Bryant, and his half brother, J.W. Milam, drove to the home of Emmett’s great-uncle, Mose Wright, and demanded the boy come out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Emmett’s uncle “led the men throughout his home with flashlights until they found Emmett in a bed, sleeping,” according to the PBS report. “They woke him up and told him to get dressed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When <a>Mamie Elizabeth Till-Mobley</a> heard the news her only child had been lynched, she insisted authorities send his body home to Chicago.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Emmett Till’s body was swollen beyond recognition. His teeth were missing. His ear was severed. His eye was hanging out. The only thing that identified him was a ring.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then the mother asked for an open casket at his funeral.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>NEW YORK — Any critical assessment of “Tina,” the new Broadway musical superheated by the sizzling essence of Tina Turner, begins and ends with another dazzling entity by the name of Adrienne Warren.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Emmett Till’s body was swollen beyond recognition. His teeth were missing. His ear was severed. His eye was hanging out. The only thing that identified him was a ring.</p></div></div>

<p>The murder of 14-year-old Emmett Till and an all-white jury's decision to exonerate the two white defendants -- after about an hour of deliberations -- was considered a defining moment in the growing civil rights movement.</p>
<p>Mrs. Till-Mobley continued to speak out about her son, but many black leaders felt her greatest role came at the height of her pain: the decision to have an open coffin.</p>
<p>The press took pictures of Till with a bullet in the skull, an eye gouged out and his head partially crushed. His body had been found floating in the Tallahatchie River, identifiable only by the ring Till wore that belonged to his late father.</p>
<p>Mrs. Till-Mobley said her son had a stutter and often had to whistle to make certain sounds.</p>
<p>The white woman's husband, Roy Bryant, was enraged. He and his half brother, J.W. Milam, found Till at a shack, where he was staying with relatives, and led him away at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Later, Bryant and Milam said they beat Till but left him alive. The jury found them not guilty, the case was not reopened and the two men later died.</p>
<p>Mamie Elizabeth Carthan was born in Hazelhurst, Miss., and grew up in Chicago. She was a 1956 cum laude graduate of Chicago Teachers College and in 1975 received a master's degree in administration and supervision from Loyola University in Chicago.</p>
<p>She taught special education in Chicago elementary schools. In recent years, she worked with writer Christopher Benson on a book about her son, "The Death of Innocence," scheduled to be published this fall by Random House.</p>
<p>"People have told me to let this thing die, even people in my own family," she told the Associated Press last month. "But people need to be aware."</p>
<p>Her husband and Emmett's father, Louis Till, died in the mid-1940s. Her marriage to Lemorris Bradley ended in divorce.</p>
<p>Her third husband, Gennie "Gene" Mobley Jr., whom she married in 1957, died in 2000.</p>
<p>Survivors include two stepdaughters; six grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.</p>

<header><div><div>Washington Capitals</div></div><div><h1>After a bumpy start, Capitals defenseman Nick Jensen has become a steadying force</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Samantha Pell</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 3:02 p.m. EST|Updated today at 3:54 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Thoughts raced through Jensen’s head: Could he play in the NHL? Would he get sent to the minors?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now, nearly three years after the Capitals acquired Jensen from the Detroit Red Wings at the 2019 trade deadline, he’s flourishing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Jensen had a strong campaign last season and continued his steady play into this one, averaging, 19:31 of ice time. He has three goals and seven assists in 32 games, and his plus-minus of plus-19 is one of the best in the league.</p></div>
<div><p>From October: Capitals defenseman Nick Jensen has carried over his strong finish to last season</p></div>
<a>healthy scratch </a>at points in the 2019-20 season, raising questions about his future in Washington. Now it’s all about working on the finer points of his game.
<div><div><p>At his low points, he tried to leave his struggles at the rink.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jensen is highly self-aware of his in-game skills. He knows he is not a player who will force offense, nor does the team need or want him to. Jensen is more focused on maximizing each shift and being a dependable defender.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the offensive zone, he knows he excels when he’s moving his feet, cycling the puck and keeping his head up. If he’s staring at the puck and worried about losing it, he knows his confidence is starting to slide.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A look at the Capitals’ long climb toward an all-time goal differential of zero</p></div>
<p>“You are the last guy back on the blue line, and if you have the confidence to do it, try to shake and bake a guy at the blue line, that is a pretty good sign … [and] probably right where I find most of my confidence,” Jensen said.</p>
<p>Some of that comes from the change in coaches from Todd Reirden to Peter Laviolette. MacLellan said Laviolette has more confidence in Jensen than the previous staff did, allowing Jensen more leeway and flexibility as he adjusted to a new system.</p>
<div><div><p>This season, Jensen’s solid play has continued with Dmitry Orlov.</p></div></div>
<b>Note:</b> Forwards T.J. Oshie and Nicklas Backstrom returned to practice Thursday after both missed
<a>Sunday’s overtime loss to New Jersey</a> with a non-covid-19 illness. Orlov also returned to practice after sitting out Wednesday with an upper-body injury.
<p>Laviolette said Orlov should be available for Friday’s game at St. Louis. Laviolette said he didn’t know whether Oshie or Backstrom would travel for the Capitals’ two-game road trip; Washington visits Minnesota on Saturday.</p>
<div><div><p>Forwards Alex Ovechkin, Evgeny Kuznetsov and Carl Hagelin and defenseman John Carlson also missed Thursday’s practice. The Capitals said all four took “maintenance days.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p><i><b>Dear Amy: </b></i><i>During the current climate of hibernation and cautious socialization, it’s appropriate to prioritize your family’s well-being.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>But may I say something in defense of hard-working hosts as well?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>After a two-year hiatus, we restarted our annual Christmas party.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Asking guests to “vaccinate or hibernate” and other clear measures were taken. And of course, anyone uncomfortable should have politely declined.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>I still ran into the same rudeness that has befuddled me since I began hosting social gatherings years ago, so I thought I’d share a few ground rules that should be revisited.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Maybe during this downtime, we’ve forgotten the “duties of a good guest":</i></p></div></div>
<p><i>You’re a guest, so act like one. Be a sparkling conversationalist. Or wear a festive sweater we can discuss. Bring a fun gift or story to tell. Guests DO have an obligation to not sit silent and sullen. It’s a party, folks.</i></p>
<div><div><p><i>If you cannot make it, immediately and politely decline the invitation. A lot of time and resources go toward planning a party and your hosts will appreciate this.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Parties are not akin to restaurant reservations that you can cancel at the last minute when something more attractive comes along.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>The coronavirus pandemic has created a decline in the social skills of our young.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Let’s lead by example in demonstrating how to be a good guest.</i></p></div></div>
