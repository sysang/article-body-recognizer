<p>"Jason was and is my best friend, and other than our ideas for family ultimately not being aligned, the amount of respect and love we have for each other will not change going forward," Stause partially wrote in a statement.</p>
<a>announced</a>: "While Chrishell and I are no longer together, we remain best friends and we will always love and support one another. She was the most amazing girlfriend I've ever had, and it was the happiest and most fulfilling relationship of my life.

<p>Stause was previously married to "This is Us" star <a><u>Justin Hartley.</u></a> Hartley filed for divorce in 2019 after two years of marriage.</p>
<p>He cited irreconcilable differences as his reason for the split. Stause's reaction to the divorce filing was previously documented on "Selling Sunset."</p>

<h1>Detroit cops rescue puppies trapped in abandoned home's mattress spring</h1>
<h2>Detroit Police Officers H. Kourani and G. Rogers say the puppies could have died in the cold if they hadn't been found</h2>
<p>It was the day after Christmas, at an abandoned house, and something seemed off, Detroit police have announced.</p>
<p>A malnourished new mother was scavenging for food outside the vacant home, with her two young puppies inside, including once who’d gotten its neck tied up in a mattress spring as temperatures were expected to drop below freezing Sunday.</p>
<p>Around 5 p.m., two officers with the city’s 11th Precinct, identified as H. Kourani and G. Rogers, were called to respond to a report of a "vicious dog" in the area.</p>

<p>TULSA COPS RESCUE, ADOPT ‘ABANDONED CHRISTMAS PUPPIES’ LEFT IN ZIPPED UP DUFFEL BAG</p>
<p>But the dog they found was "nowhere near that," Kourani told Fox News Digital. She was friendly and noticeably underweight. However, she did look like she’d recently given birth.</p>
<p>"Their stomachs and their mammary glands get very swollen and enlarged because they're filled with their milk for their puppies," Rogers told Fox News Digital. "So it was something I immediately recognized."</p>
<p>They first worked to gain the mother’s trust, feeding her treats until she warmed up to them. </p>
<p>Once the officers had earned her trust, they could go inside and look for the puppies without the mother perceiving them as a threat.</p>

<p>"As soon as we turned that first corner into the living room, we saw a tiny brown puppy laying on top of a beat-up mattress," Kourani said.</p>
<p><a><u>FAMILY FINDS KITTEN TRAPPED IN ENGINE BAY WHILE DRIVING, ADOPTS IT</u></a></p>
<p>That one, rescuers later told Fox News Digital, is a girl. After the officers picked him up, they found her brother inside the mattress, caught up in a spring with the coil around his neck, Rogers said. But she didn’t have a knife or pliers handy.</p>
<p>"I just used all my force to break it off his neck," she said. "He did whimper a little bit once I got it off, but I think that was a sense of relief."</p>
<p>The officers said a veterinarian told them the puppies likely wouldn’t have survived the night if they hadn’t been rescued. </p>
<p>"Whether it’s an animal life or human life, we’re always going to do our best to try to protect and preserve it as much as possible," Kourani said.</p>
<p>Rogers said she’s an experienced animal rescuer, volunteering for rescues when she was younger and adopting her own dog from the Michigan Humane Society.</p>
<p>"I don’t know if it’s a blessing, but my precinct calls me the dog whisperer because I’ve always had a passion for dogs," she said. </p>
<p>"Her body condition was very bad when we got her, so she definitely needs to put on some weight," Sumpter told Fox News Digital Tuesday. "But she seemed otherwise healthy."</p>
<p>The puppies, which have not yet received names, are about two or three weeks old, Sumpter said.</p>
<p>They need to remain with their mother until around eight weeks old, she said, in order to properly socialize and grow. Then the rescue will try and find them adoptive homes.</p>
<p>Detroit Pit Crew’s in-house veterinarian is expected to give the mother another checkup on Monday. The group is also running an online fundraiser for the dogs that’s attracted about $1,000 in donations so far.</p>
<p>The Detroit rescue happened just hours after officers in Tulsa, Oklahoma, rescued and adopted a litter of puppies abandoned in a zipped-up duffel bag left on a QuikTrip convenience store county on Christmas night.</p>

<h1>California mom says daughter 'died in my arms' after police accidentally shot her at LA clothing store</h1>
<h2>Los Angeles police released body camera footage and surveillance video from inside the North Hollywood store</h2>
<p>The mother of a teen girl who was accidentally struck by a police bullet Thursday in the dressing room of a <a><u>Los Angeles</u></a> <a><u>Burlington Coat Factory</u></a> described holding her daughter in her arms as she died.</p>
<a><u>Valentina Orellana-Peralta</u></a>, 14, were trying on dresses for Christmas in a changing room when they heard loud noises.

<p><a><u>LAPD RELEASES VIDEO OF MOMENTS LEADING UP TO FATAL SHOOTING OF SUSPECT, GIRL, 14, AT BURLINGTON STORE</u></a></p>
<p>Police fired on a suspect who allegedly attacked several women in the store, and a bullet ricocheted off the floor and pierced the wall of the dressing room, striking Orellana-Peralta in the chest.</p>
<p>"Her body went limp," said Peralta, standing beside her husband and the girl’s father, Juan Pablo. "I tried to wake her up by shaking her, but she didn’t wake up…she died in my arms and there was nothing I could do."</p>

<p>"We’ll have to take it to her grave so she can skate with the angels," he said. The other gifts he bought her for Christmas will also be placed at her grave.</p>

<p>"She wanted to be here in the United States because this was the land of opportunity," her father said.</p>
<p>On Monday, police released body camera footage and surveillance video from inside the North Hollywood store that showed the chaos unfold before the suspect and child were killed.</p>
<p>The suspect, Daniel Elena Lopez, 24, is shown arriving at the store on a bicycle at around 11 a.m. and using a bike lock to smash a computer and glass railing. He then tried to rob a woman, smacking her with the metal lock, police said.</p>

<h1>Los Angeles family of five missing amid child neglect probe; newborn tested positive for cocaine, police say</h1>
<h2>Witnesses told police the parents fled with the children just before Christmas and may have been headed to Nevada</h2>
<p>Police were looking for a <a>Los Angeles</a> family of five Monday that disappeared amid a <a>child</a> neglect and drug investigation after the couple's 3-week-old child tested positive for <a>cocaine</a>. </p>
<p>The Los Angeles Police Department said Arely Anaya and Luis Avalos, the parents of a newborn, a 4-year-old and a 5-year-old may have fled to Reno, <a>Nevada</a> last week, according to witnesses. </p>
<div> <div><p> Luis Avalos (LAPD)</p></div></div>
<p>The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services contacted the LAPD on Monday to advise the department about a drug and child neglect investigation involving the children. </p>
<p>Arely Anaya and the newborn who was born on Dec. 2, both tested positive for cocaine, prompting the notification to DCFS. </p>
<p>The agency unsuccessfully tried contacting the parents several times throughout the first half of December, the LAPD said. </p>
<div> <div><p> Arely Anaya (LAPD)</p></div></div>
<p>"The parents were made aware of DCFS intention to remove the children from the home and place them in protective custody," police said. "The parents no longer responded to phone calls, nor answered their door for DCFS."</p>
<p>Social workers notified the police that they were seeking a court order to place the children in protective custody and an arrest warrant for the parents. </p>
<p>When police officers visited the family home in the San Fernando Valley, they weren't there. </p>
<p>"Witnesses advised they were aware of the DCFS investigation and knew the parents were worried their children would be taken away," the LAPD said. </p>

<h1>Why MSNBC's Claire McCaskill feels Garland could 'go down in infamy as one of the worst attorney generals'</h1>
<h2>Former Democratic senator urged Garland to hold Trump accountable for Jan. 6</h2>
<h4><a>Media top headlines December 28 </a></h4>
<a>Claire McCaskill</a>, who is now an MSNBC analyst, said Monday that
<a>Attorney General Merrick Garland</a> would "go down in infamy as one of the worst attorney generals in this country’s history" if former President Trump isn’t held accountable for the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.
<p>McCaskill - who wanted to lay out facts "like an opening statement" - declared that Trump "watched TV all day long for four years" and therefore must have been watching the chaos of Jan. 6 unfold in real time. </p>
<p>MSNBC'S MCCASKILL MOCKED FOR CLAIMING NEW JULY 4 RITUAL WILL BE WATCHING CAPITOL RIOT VIDEO: 'WHAT THE F---'</p>
<p>"He watched all the channels," McCaskill told MSNBC colleague Nicolle Wallace.</p>
<p>"That’s what this committee is going to lay out," she said. "That’s where Merrick Garland is either going to rise to the occasion or go down in infamy as one of the worst attorney generals in this country’s history."</p>
<p>McCaskill was defeated in 2018 in her bid for a third term by Hawley. She joined MSNBC in 2019. </p>
<p><a>HAWLEY SAYS GARLAND WILL GO DOWN AS 'ONE OF THE WORST' AGS IN US HISTORY</a></p>
<p>"We’re going to start a new family tradition in my family. On the Fourth of July and every Fourth of July going forward, we’re going to watch that video that The New York Times put together of January 6," McCaskill told MSNBC’s Willie Geist. </p>
<p>McCaskill's brazen claim that she would watch the video every July 4, for the rest of her life, was quickly mocked. </p>
