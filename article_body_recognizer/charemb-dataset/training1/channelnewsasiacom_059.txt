<h1> What’s in your toothpaste? 5 things to know for your teeth’s sake (and your children’s) </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Anne-Marie Lim </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Brushing of teeth is a habit acquired as children, but how many of us know what toothpaste we should use, or why young children should not swallow the substance?</p>
<p>Tristan Peh, a dentist with 17 years’ experience, fielded some of your questions, and his replies may make you brush more carefully, visit your dentist regularly and read toothpaste labels more closely in future. Here are five things to know.</p>
<h2>1. WHAT TOOTHPASTE SHOULD I BUY?</h2>
<p>Look for one that contains at least 1,000 parts per million of fluoride, said Peh of St Andrew’s Dental Surgeons. Fluoride can help to prevent and even reverse tooth decay, he said.</p>
<p>“If there’s any initial decay, it actually helps to re-mineralise (and) strengthen the tooth surface.”</p>
<h2>2. WHAT IF I HAVE SENSITIVE TEETH, OR TEETH I WANT TO WHITEN?</h2>
<p>To relieve tooth sensitivity, it is good to get toothpaste with potassium nitrate because of our teeth’s dentinal tubules: Small, hollow channels that travel from the inside of each tooth through its middle layer, the dentine.</p>
<p>Teeth get more sensitive when the enamel surface wears away and dentinal tubules are exposed. Potassium nitrate helps to cover the tubules up, thereby reducing sensitivity, said Peh.</p>
<p>If you are looking at whitening toothpaste, pick one that contains either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, he said.</p>
<p>Do-it-yourself whitening remedies, such as charcoal or baking soda, come with risks. The substances may be abrasive and wear out the tooth surface. “If you brush away the enamel, the dentine exposed can lead to sensitivity,” he said.</p>
<p>“If you have extensive wear, even if you use toothpaste for sensitive teeth, it might not even help. So you might (be looking at) either fillings or maybe crowns later on.”</p>

<p>Whitening treatment administered by dental professionals deliver more predictable results and a faster whitening process.</p>
<h2>3. SHOULD I BRUSH BEFORE OR AFTER BREAKFAST?</h2>
<p>It does not really matter, according to Peh. If you brush after breakfast, however, and had consumed acidic food or drinks such as coffee, it would be helpful to wait half an hour before brushing.</p>
<p>Alternatively, rinse your mouth out before brushing. This is because the acids weaken the surface of the teeth; brushing may then wear away the surface, said Peh.</p>
<h2>4. SHOULD I REALLY NOT RINSE AFTER BRUSHING, AS A DENTIST ADVISED ON TIKTOK?</h2>
<p>After brushing for two minutes — the duration that would enable us to clean all tooth surfaces — and spitting out your toothpaste, it is up to you to rinse out your mouth or not, said Peh.</p>
<p>Not everyone can bear the taste of toothpaste in the mouth after brushing, he noted.</p>
<p>Besides, there is more than one way to prevent tooth decay: By brushing and flossing well, using fluoridated toothpaste and limiting sugar intake, he cited.</p>
<h2>5. HOW MUCH TOOTHPASTE SHOULD CHILDREN USE?</h2>
<p>For children younger than three years old, use a rice-grain amount or a smear of toothpaste, said Peh. For children less than eight years old, use a pea-sized amount of toothpaste.</p>
<p>Children below the age of eight should spit out their toothpaste. This is because excessive intake of toothpaste when permanent teeth are developing can lead to dental fluorosis — white stains on the teeth.</p>

<h1> Will skipping breakfast lead to hair loss? 6 common hair care mistakes we all make </h1>
<div> <p>It’s all about depriving your hair of nutrients. Mind how often you brush and how tight you tie your locks, too, says a trichologist.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tan Wei Lin </a> </div> </div>
<p>Hair loss is an issue that affects both men and women, and a problem that can be very difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Unlike having damaged hair or greying hair – which can be improved with haircare products and concealed with hair dye – hair that is lost sometimes will not grow back, even with professional treatment.</p>
<p>“Hair loss occurs when the follicles are weakened and, most of the time, it has got a lot to do with internal health issues, which can be anything from hormonal imbalance, stress and nutritional deficiencies to genetic predisposition,” she said.</p>
<p>But there are also instances in which your hairstyling, haircare or personal habits can cause it to happen.</p>
<p>Here, she explains how small things like not knowing how to properly use conditioner can cause hair fall, and she reveals how hair loss can be affected by factors we didn’t expect.</p>

<p>MISTAKE 1: NOT SHAMPOOING OFTEN ENOUGH</p>
<p>How often should we wash our hair then? It really depends on one’s unique scalp and hair condition. You’ll likely need to shampoo more often if you have an oily scalp or when the weather is hot.</p>

<p>MISTAKE 4: USING THE WRONG TYPE OF SCALP PRODUCTS</p>
<p>Scalp care is a product category that has seen exponential growth of late. But do we really need to add things like a scalp exfoliant or serum to our haircare routine?</p>
<p>“Products designed for the scalp, particularly leave-in serums or tonics, should leave your scalp feeling clean and light. Beware of those that leave any residue or cause your scalp to itch or feel sensitive,” she advised.</p>

<p>MISTAKE 5: TYING YOUR HAIR TOO TIGHTLY</p>
<p>Pulling your hair into a tight ponytail or updo – and wearing such hairstyles too frequently – results in mechanical trauma that will weaken the hair roots.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Palestinians, Israeli forces clash near West Bank outpost </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>TEL AVIV, Israel: Israeli forces clashed with Palestinians in the West Bank in an area that has seen a recent uptick in friction, the Israeli military and Palestinian medics said.</p>
<p>The clashes late on Saturday (Dec 25) were part of days of tension in the area surrounding a West Bank settlement outpost and a spike in violence elsewhere in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.</p>
<p>During the clashes, the military said, hundreds of Palestinians threw rocks and burned tires and shots were fired in the area. The military said forces responded with live fire and “riot dispersal means”, typically tear gas and stun grenades.</p>
<p>The military also said shots were fired from a passing vehicle toward a military post near the West Bank city of Nablus, which is south of Homesh. It was not clear if the shooting was related to the clashes.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Red Crescent said 10 people were wounded by live fire. The Palestinian Health Ministry said one of them, a 17-year-old, was seriously wounded. Dozens of others were wounded by rubber bullets.</p>
<p>A soldier was lightly wounded, the military said.</p>
<p>Homesh, in the northern West Bank, was dismantled as part of Israel’s withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005. But in recent years, Israeli settlers have returned to pray and established an unauthorized outpost at the site.</p>
<p>On Thursday, thousands of Jewish nationalists marched to Homesh to mark the end of the mourning period for Dimentman and on Friday, Israeli forces dismantled structures that settlers had erected at the outpost.</p>
<p>According to Israeli media reports, Jewish settlers were expected to march again to the outpost on Saturday night, drawing calls on Palestinian social media for nearby villagers to be on alert.</p>
<p>Israel captured east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the territories are now home to over 700,000 Israel settlers. Most of the international community considers Israeli settlements illegal obstacles to peace.</p>
<p>The Palestinians seek east Jerusalem and the West Bank as parts of a future independent state.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Living </a> </p> <h5> Does this happen when you open your closet? Here's how to control it </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <p> Living </p> <h1> Does this happen when you open your closet? Here's how to control it </h1> <div> <p>With all due respect to Marie Kondo, it isn’t just about getting rid of things. Here’s what the experts know that you may not.</p> </div> </div>
<p>But there is a solution – and it isn’t just about getting rid of clothing. If you design your closet to suit your needs, you can maximise space and make your storage more functional.</p>
<p>We asked a few of them to share some of their wisdom.</p>
<h3><a>READ: How filthy is your workspace since you went on leave? The toilet seat might be cleaner</a></h3>
<p>This doesn’t require extreme decluttering or wasteful purging, but if you have clothing you haven’t worn in more than a year – and it’s not something you’re reserving for special occasions – it’s probably time to let it go.</p>
<p>Lisa Adams, the chief executive of Los Angeles-based LA Closet Design, said she itemises the remaining pieces by creating an inventory on a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>CONSIDER ALTERNATE STORAGE SPACES</p>
<p>If it looks like you still have too much stuff to fit in your bedroom closet, consider whether some of it could be stored elsewhere.</p>
<p>“If your family is the kind of family where everyone takes their shoes off when they come in the door, maybe you need an entry closet for coats and shoes rather than taking the space of your master closet for things like that,” Baxter suggested.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Your cluttered home could be stressing you out, researchers learn</a></h3>
<p>Or, think about using free-standing furniture for additional storage space. “The easiest thing is to buy a chest of drawers for your bedroom,” said Carolyn Musher, the vice president of sales at California Closets, in New York.</p>
<p>If you’re pressed for space and “you have room for drawers outside of the closet,” she added, “you should not be wasting the space inside of your closet.”</p>
<p>DESIGN THE PRIMARY COMPONENTS</p>
<p>By introducing more rods, more shelves and – if you have the space – a few drawers, you can store more in an orderly way.</p>
<p>Opening the closet door should feel as good as stepping into a store. “The goal is to be able to shop your closet,” Musher said. “You want to be able to walk in and see everything you own,” without digging through piles.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Maximising closet space can be so challenging that even professional interior designers sometimes call on specialised closet designers or organisation experts to help.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Working from your inventory, identify how much space you need for hanging longer items like dresses and shorter items like shirts, while building in a little extra space for new arrivals.</p>
<p>For shorter items, “double-hang is the way to go,” Musher said, “because you really open up the space.”</p>
<p>She typically leaves 100cm to 107cm between the floor and a low rod, she said. Then she adds a shelf above it and measures another 100cm for a higher rod.</p>
<p>Her rule of thumb for other items? “If it doesn’t go on a hanger, it goes on a shelf,” she said. “But if it falls off a shelf, it needs to go in a drawer.”</p>
<p>That means most bulky things, like sweaters and jeans, should be folded and stacked on shelves, but underwear, socks, pajamas and T-shirts can go in drawers.</p>
<p>Shelves should be a minimum of 30cm deep, she said, “but ideally, you want your clothing shelves to be 35cm to 40cm deep.”</p>

<p>MAKE SPACE FOR SHOES AND BAGS</p>
<p>Your shoes don’t have to live in a pile on the floor, or in boxes. Lining them up in rows on shelves will help keep things tidy while making it easier to find what you want to wear.</p>
<blockquote> <p>If it doesn’t go on a hanger, it goes on a shelf. But if it falls off a shelf, it needs to go in a drawer.</p> </blockquote>
<p>“They create a little pocket for everything,” she said, “and keep everything in its place.”</p>
<p>ADD FUNCTIONAL ACCESSORIES</p>
<p>Once the primary components of your closet are in place, there are any number of accessories and extras that can make it easier to use.</p>
<p>Adams, of LA Closet Design, sometimes includes a slide-out surface for folding clothes. She also builds hanging sections in small pockets of leftover space for scarves and jewellery.</p>
<p>“It’s the thing I always put in every closet, no matter what,” she said. “There are so many uses for it.”</p>
<p>Inside drawers, she adds dividers to keep underwear, socks and bras in separate compartments.</p>

<p>Sweater boxes are good for storing and protecting out-of-season clothing on high shelves, Lomonaco said. And if you choose clear ones, it will be easy to see what’s inside.</p>
<p>Even your hangers are worth some attention. “Using a slim hanger really helps you fit more in a tiny space,” Lomonaco said. “And having uniformity in hangers really just helps keep a consistent feel throughout the closet.”</p>
<p>A label maker can also be useful. The organisers at Horderly often label closet-rod dividers, bins and baskets to help their clients keep things organised over time.</p>
<p>FINISH WITH A PERSONAL TOUCH</p>
<p>Schuster, for instance, painted her walk-in closet blue, mounted framed art on the wall and placed a generous ottoman on a sheepskin rug.</p>
<p>“When you get dressed in the morning, or undressed at night, you want it to feel like home,” she said. “Feeling good in your space is why I do what I do, and the closet is part of that.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Saudi-led coalition hits Yemen rebel camp in ramped up air war </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>RIYADH: The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said on Sunday (Dec 26) it struck a Huthi rebel camp in the capital Sanaa, as it intensified an aerial bombing campaign against the Iran-backed insurgents.</p>
<p>The coalition, which backs Yemen's internationally recognised government against the Huthis in a civil war, said it destroyed weapons storehouses in the rebel-held capital, according to the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA).</p>
<p>"The operation in Sanaa was an immediate response to an attempt to transfer weapons from Al-Tashrifat camp in Sanaa," it said in a statement, adding it "destroyed weapons warehouses".</p>
<p>The coalition is scheduled to hold a news conference on Sunday at which it has said it will show evidence of involvement by Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah militia in the Yemeni conflict.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has long accused Iran of supplying the Huthis with sophisticated weapons and its Hezbollah proxy of training the insurgents, charges the Islamic republic denies.</p>
<p>Yemen has been wracked by civil war since 2014 pitting the government against the Huthis who control much of the north.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people have been killed, in what the United Nations has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>The coalition launched a "large-scale" military operation against the Huthis on Saturday, the Saudi authorities said, after missiles fired by the rebels killed two people in the kingdom, the first such deaths in three years.</p>
<p>Those air raids left dead three civilians, including a child and a woman, Yemeni medics told AFP.</p>
<p>The coalition maintains its operations are carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law, repeatedly urging the Huthis against using civilians as human shields.</p>
<p>It said it will present during Sunday's news conference "evidence of involvement of Lebanon's terrorist Hezbollah in Yemen and use of (Sanaa) airport to target the kingdom", according to SPA.</p>
<p>The coalition has intensified its air strikes on Sanaa, targeting earlier this week the airport, whose operations have largely ceased because of a Saudi-led blockade since August 2016, with exemptions for aid flights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the insurgents often launch missiles and drones into Saudi Arabia, targeting its airports and oil infrastructure.</p>
<p>The UN estimates Yemen's war will have claimed 377,000 lives by the end of the year through both direct and indirect impacts.</p>

<h1> Stress, smoking and bad diets equals grey hair – can you still reverse the process? </h1>
<div> <p>While genes play a role, the rest of it is really up to you. Experts explain the science behind premature grey hair, and why there’s hope just yet. If you start early.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lorraine Robert </a> </div> </div>
<p>While ash grey is a trendy hair colour to sport right now, the very sight of white or grey strands of hair peeking from our lustrous mane would still get many of us whining about our ageing looks.</p>
<p>So when the greys aren’t welcome, can we possibly reverse the process? The long and the short of it is – perhaps, but within limits.</p>
<p>Melanocytes on these cells produce and distribute melanin (a pigment that determines our natural hair colour) which is then transferred to the keratinocytes that make up the cells in the hair shaft.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Genes account for about 30 per cent of hair’s greying, with the remaining 70 per cent due to other factors.</p> </blockquote>
<p>What are the common causes of grey hair? “Genetics play a role when greying starts with common signs of grey visible during middle age," shared Peggy Goh, Principal Trichologist at DRx Medispa.</p>
<h3><a>READ: How to instantly look younger: Hair tips from celebrity stylist David Gan</a></h3>
<p>REVERSING THE GREYING PROCESS</p>
<p>The crucial question is: Can you really turn the greying process around and get your natural colour back without hair dye? While the experts say it may be possible, they emphasise that this really depends on a variety of factors.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Keeping a healthy lifestyle and lowering stress levels may get you your dark locks back.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Goh stated that one of the key contributing factors to premature greying is oxidative stress that can occur when there is an imbalance of free radicals and antioxidants in the body. </p>
<p>“Uncontrolled oxidative stress can accelerate the ageing process and may contribute to the development of several conditions, premature greying is a common barometer to overall wellbeing,” she said.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Bleach or highlights? How to choose the right colour for your hair type and texture</a></h3>
<p>Stress, smoking and an unbalanced diet can cause hair to turn grey prematurely. So in these instances, keeping a healthy lifestyle and lowering stress levels may get you your dark tresses back. </p>
<p>In fact, Goh advised that getting sufficient rest to re-energise and de-stress may help. “Managing and adopting a lifestyle that reduces oxidative stress plays a key role,” she explained. </p>
<p>Diet, too, plays a vital role. Eating foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids and zinc such as fish, seeds as well as leafy greens like kale and broccoli, can help in reversing the greying process.</p>
<p>Some haircare brands have developed products and treatments that claim to be able to help you get your natural colour back. But again, some have been known to work more effectively with premature greying and not greying due to ageing. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Ladies, here’s a step-by-step guide to getting rid of hair split ends once and for all</a></h3>
<p>There is a higher chance of preventing grey hair than reversing it, so if your hair hasn’t started turning white, take heed:</p>
<p>Consistent exercise can help to stave off ageing by keeping your blood circulation going and ensuring that your bodily functions are healthy.</p>
<p>Adequate restful sleep as well as taking time to relax will help your body rejuvenate and contribute to healthy hair. </p>
<p>TREAT YOUR HAIR WITH CARE</p>
<p>Goh advised using haircare products that are free of harsh ingredients such as paraben, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) and sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), and also to avoid over-washing your hair.</p>
<p>“Be mindful of the products you use to wash, dye, and style your hair. Bleaching and harsh shampoos can lead to damage and early white hair,” said Tan.</p>
<p>“Smoking has adverse effects on the body and contributes to white hair,” said Tan. Stub it out as smokers have been known to have a higher chance of going grey.</p>

<p>VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis bemoaned Italy's plunging birthrate on Sunday (Dec 26), warning that the decline represented a threat to the future of the country.</p>
<p>Births in Italy last year hit their lowest level since the unification of the nation in 1861, the national statistics office said this month, with the figure falling for a 12th consecutive year.</p>
<p>"The demographic winter is a real worry, at least here in Italy," the pope said in his weekly address in front of St Peter's Basilica.</p>
<p>"It seems that a lot of people have lost the wish to have children. Lots of couples prefer to remain childless or to have one child only. ... It's a tragedy ... which runs counter to our families, our country and our future."</p>
<p>There were 404,892 births in Italy last year, the ISTAT statistics office said, down 15,192 from 2019. There were 746,146 deaths in 2020 as the population fell to 59.3 million.</p>
<p>ISTAT said the slump in births had continued this year, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic appeared to be a factor in the decline.</p>

<div> <section> <div> <p> Advertorial </p> <h1> Reimagining the cafe experience at home </h1> <div> <p>Andrea Chong and Hanli Hoefer share how they have brought home brewing to the next level with Nespresso Vertuo Next.</p> </div> </div> </section> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Brand Studio </a> </div> </div>
<div><div> <h6> Brought to you by </h6> </div> </div>
<a>Nespresso Vertuo Next</a>, the latest addition to Nespresso’s range of coffee machines.
<p>THE MINIMALIST – LESS IS MORE</p>
<p>When Ms Chong and her husband laid eyes on a heritage property two years ago, its black and white facade spoke to the digital content creator immediately. </p>
<p>Instead of rushing to furnish the space extensively, Ms Chong was guided by her personal philosophy of minimalism.</p>
<p>“Less is more, but it certainly doesn’t have to be boring,” said Ms Chong. “To me, minimalism is living with intention and accessorising purposefully.”</p>
<p>“Minimalist living is all about finding joy in what you keep,” Ms Chong added. </p>
<p>In line with her philosophy, Ms Chong appreciates how the Nespresso Vertuo Next offers a wide range of coffee styles in one machine. </p>
<p>"It can help you brew over 30 blends across various cafe-inspired styles. So if you love an espresso like my husband, or you just want iced coffee like myself, the Vertuo Next can do it for you. It’s a dream for any minimalist,” she said. </p>
<p>A feature of Nespresso Vertuo Next she appreciates is the barcode scanning technology that delivers the perfect cup every time.</p>
<p>Ms Chong said: “With the touch of a button, the machine detects the barcode on your capsules to optimise the amount of water needed, as well as the ideal temperature to brew your coffee.” </p>
<p>A specialty of her home cafe? An iced mint latte, using mint grown in her herb garden. It’s an indulgence she often savours while working at the outdoor dining area. </p>
<p>“With this new coffee machine, I feel like I’m working at a cafe since I can have my coffee anywhere I want,” she reflected.</p>
<p>"I love nature, I love being outdoors. So I figured that I was going to try bringing as much of the outdoors into my home as possible,” she said. </p>
<p>"I try to live as sustainably as possible with a zero-waste mindset. For example, I use leftover coffee grounds as compost,” she said. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the Vertuo Next, Nespresso's most sustainable machine yet, has found resonance with Ms Hoefer.</p>
<p>“More than half of the Vertuo Next is made from recycled plastic, and it’s got a quick 30-second heat-up time with two-minute auto shut-off, which basically means this machine has a smaller carbon footprint,” she explained.</p>
<p>After a long day on set or at a studio, you’ll often find Ms Hoefer on her balcony enjoying her go-to coffee – the Reverso. </p>
<p>“It’s a simple and easy way to enjoy a creamy cup of coffee. All it needs is a dash of milk before you extract your coffee over it because the crema is already infused with a milky taste,” she shared. </p>
<p>The green enthusiast pairs her cuppa with oat milk as it has a lower environmental impact compared to dairy milk. </p>
<p>Dotted with rescued plants and planters, the balcony is Ms Hoefer’s version of an indoor garden cafe, a space where she can relax and enjoy the stillness.</p>
<p>She said: “This is my ‘me corner’ – where I read, drink my coffee and meditate. And when my friends come over, this is where we hang out and catch up.”</p>

<li> <a> CNA Eyewitness</a> <ul> <li> Send us a news tip </li> </ul> </li>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Climate crisis puts oil in the crosshairs, but dependence persists </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>PARIS: The climate crisis has put the end of oil onto the agenda, but achieving that is a colossal task given the world economy's deep dependence on petroleum.</p>
<p>"In 2021, several developments showed clearly that (the petroleum) industry doesn't have a future," said Romain Ioualalen at the activist group Oil Change International.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency warned in May that an immediate halt to new investment in fossil projects is needed if the world is to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and to stand any chance of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. </p>
<p>The call was a revolution for an agency created in the wake of the first 1970 oil shock to protect the energy security of rich, oil-consuming nations.</p>
<p>Another major moment in 2021 was the emergence at the <a>COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow</a> of a coalition of nations that pledged to phase out oil and gas production, although no major oil and gas producing nation joined that group.</p>
<p>"It is no longer taboo to talk about the end of the extraction of hydrocarbons during international climate summits," said Oil Change International's Ioualalen.</p>
<p>And fossil fuels - which still represent 80 per cent of energy consumed - were explicitly blamed for driving climate change, which was not the case when the Paris climate pact was reached in 2015.</p>
<p>More recently, environmental defenders scored a symbolic victory when oil giant Shell decided to exit the development of the controversial Cambo oil field off Scotland saying the investment case was "not strong enough".</p>
<p>"We've known for several years that the end of crude oil ... is near," said Moez Ajmi, an energy specialist at professional services firm EY.</p>
<p>"But is the world ready to live without oil? It is still very dependent in my view."</p>
<p>The IEA also believes that oil demand is still set to rise. It expects it to reach its pre-pandemic level of just under 100 million barrels per day next year.</p>
<p>With crude prices having rebounded in the past months, oil producers are rolling in cash and can afford to pursue new projects.</p>
<p>"Any talk of the oil and gas industries being consigned to the past and halting new investments in oil and gas is misguided," OPEC leader Mohammed Barkindo said recently.</p>
<p>The head of French oil firm TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne, said he's "convinced the transition will take place because there is a real awareness, but it will take time."</p>
<p>He believes the issue is being approached from the wrong end. Instead of focussing on reducing oil, attention should be shifted towards consumption.</p>
<p>Demand for fossil fuels "will decline because consumers have access to new products like electric vehicles," said Pouyanne.</p>
<p>In the first half of the year, electric vehicles accounted for 7 per cent of global auto sales, according to BloombergNEF. While that is still a small percentage, it is growing fast.</p>
<h2>"TRANSFORMATIONAL YEAR"</h2>
<p>Oil Change International's Ioualalen said that arguments put forward by oil companies and producing nations are cynical and focus on the short term.</p>
<p>"They're trying to justify an unsustainable trajectory at any cost," he said.</p>
<p>"We're still far from a decarbonised economy, of course, but it is the energy system investments that are made today that will lead us there," said Ioualalen.</p>
<p>Whatever the horizon for the end of petroleum, industry players are still only willy-nilly preparing for it as pressure upon them mounts.</p>
<p>US oil majors ExxonMobil and Chevron were long holdouts but finally announced this year investments into the energy transition.</p>
<p>"2022 has the potential to be a truly transformational year," said Tom Ellacott, senior vice president for corporate analysis at energy research and consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie.</p>
<p>"It's clear that sitting on the decarbonisation sidelines isn't an option" given the increasing pressure on the oil industry.</p>
<p>Experts believe that 2022 will see more investment in wind and solar power as well as technology to capture carbon emissions from fossil fuel power plants and factories.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Somali President, PM trade accusations over delays to ongoing elections </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Parliamentary elections began on Nov 1 and were supposed to be completed by Dec. 24, but one newly elected lawmaker said that as of Saturday only 24 of 275 representatives had been elected.</p>
<p>"The Prime Minister is posing a serious threat to the electoral process and overstepping his mandate," the office of President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed said in a statement on Sunday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Mohamed Hussein Roble's office later put out its own statement saying the president had spent "so much time, energy and finances in frustrating the national elections" and was "derailing the electoral process."</p>
<p>The United States late on Sunday called for a credible and rapid conclusion to the elections.</p>
<p>"The United States is deeply concerned by the continuing delays and by the procedural irregularities that have undermined the credibility of the process", the US State Department said.</p>
<p>Newly elected parliamentarian Mohamed Sheikh Mursal said only 24 lawmakers had been confirmed as elected as of Saturday, one day after the process had been due to be completed.</p>
<p>Under Somalia's complex indirect electoral process, regional councils are meant to choose a senate. Clan elders are then meant to pick members of the lower house, which then picks a new president at a date not yet fixed.</p>
<p>In April, factions of the security forces allied to Mohamed and Roble seized areas of the capital, as the prime minister and opposition both opposed a move to extend the president's four-year term by another two years.</p>
<p>Clashes between the two groups forced between 60,000 and 100,000 people to flee their homes.</p>
<p>The confrontation was resolved when the president put Roble in charge of security and of organising the delayed elections.</p>
<p>Roble's Sunday statement said he would hold meetings on Monday to find ways to speed up the election.</p>
<p>President Mohamed's office also said he would hold a separate meeting on the elections and "agreeing on a capable leadership to spearhead timely, and transparent elections" without offering more details on how long the process might take.</p>

<p>This year, December looks a little different. With Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) options available to the twice-jabbed, leisure travel is once again on the table. </p>
<p>Even if you think dusting off your passports is a wee bit premature but still want that well-deserved year-end vacation, Singapore’s bounty of hotel options and local attractions can equally confer a sweet retreat.</p>
<p>If nippy weather and snow-covered anything set you into the full swing of Christmas, then head to the northerly regions for a visit.</p>
<p>When it comes to snow, Canada has it in spades. Ontario’s Niagara Falls is unmissable, best paired with the nearby Winter Festival of Lights featuring three million lights and over 75 twinkling displays to dress up those holiday photos. </p>
<p>If more idyllic and leisurely holidays are your fancy, then France beckons with its easy flair. The alpine slopes are an obvious choice, but if you’re looking for sweater weather, then pick Marseille for a laidback provincial food adventure. </p>
<p>Your ticket to a discounted holiday deal starts here with Citi credit cards.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Getting kids involved with preparing meals helps expand their vocabulary and appetite to learn more </h1>
<div> <p>Everything from grocery shopping and cooking to setting the table and enjoying the meal can be a teachable moment, says an American psychologist.</p> </div>

<p>PITTSBURGH, Pennsylvania: Reading, writing and maths are often thought of as subjects that children learn in school.</p>
<p>But as a psychologist who researches how families can help support learning at home, I have found that children can also learn those skills through everyday tasks and chores.</p>
<p>One of these chores is preparing a meal – everything from grocery shopping and cooking to setting the table and enjoying the meal.</p>
<p>Our research shows this is especially true for Latino families living in the US, many of whom are new to school systems in the US but for whom family dinners are a central part of the day.</p>
<p>Our study included 248 Latino parents with kids in kindergarten. Some parents were given a set of tips – described below – on how to support children’s language, literacy and maths at home while selecting, preparing and eating food.</p>
<p>Parents were asked to use these tips for at least a month. Other parents were not given these tips.</p>
<p>Our study found that the children whose parents were given these tips had larger vocabularies and more motivation to learn both one month after using the tips and even five months later.</p>
<p>These children were also better storytellers and were better able to control their behaviour and pay better attention compared with children whose parents were not given these tips.</p>
<p>Busy parents in particular loved these tips because they were easy to follow and to fit into their regular schedules and did not require extra work or special materials.</p>
<p>Parents can ask their children to write out the grocery list before they go food shopping.</p>
<p>While older children can use letters and numbers – for example, “2 cereal boxes, 10 bananas,” younger children might be encouraged to draw pictures of the items their parents want to buy or to use a combination of letters, numbers and pictures.</p>
<p>A 2017 study found that the more parents let their children try out writing and reading letters and numbers on their own while making grocery lists, the better the children’s reading and maths skills are later.</p>
<p>Once back from the store, parents can ask children to use their grocery list to check whether the parents bought everything on the list. This is a great way for children to practise writing, reading and maths.</p>
<h2>2. COOKING AND SETTING THE TABLE</h2>
<p>Gathering and mixing the ingredients for cooking or setting the table are opportunities for kids to practice maths in a playful and familiar way.</p>
<p>We found that practising maths with children during these household chores can also increase kids’ motivation to learn maths.</p>
<p>Ask your child questions such as: Can you get five apples from the fridge? I added four cups of milk plus one more – how many are there in total? How many plates and forks do we need today?</p>
<h2>3. TELL STORIES AT MEALTIME</h2>
<p>Parents can use family dinner and other meals to encourage children to tell stories about their day. Telling stories about past or future events is a great way to build skills like vocabulary and story comprehension that are needed to read.</p>
