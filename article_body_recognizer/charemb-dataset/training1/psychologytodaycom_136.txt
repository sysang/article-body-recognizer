<h1> The Power of Being Unafraid of Singlehood </h1>
<h2> Research on the securely single personality. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Relationships Matter </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>People who are unafraid to be single have high standards for their partner and relationship.</li>
<li>After a relationship ends, people who are unafraid to be single are less likely to pine or initiate contact with their ex-partner.</li>
<li>People who are unafraid to be single have healthy personalities. For example, they tend to be less neurotic and less sensitive to rejection.</li>
<p>Turns out, they probably are. And they are worse off for it.</p>
<a>Fear</a> of Being Single Scale.” They then conducted a series of studies to see how fearfulness about being single — or the flip side, fearlessness — matters. The title of their original research report says it all: “
<a>Settling for Less Out of Fear of Being Single</a>.” Additional
<a>research</a> has been conducted since then.
<p>The “Fear of Being Single Scale” includes items such as these:</p>
<li>“I feel <a>anxious</a> when I think about being single forever.”</li>
<li>“It scares me to think there might not be anyone out there for me.”</li>
<li>“If I end up alone in life, I will probably feel that there is something wrong with me.”</li>
<h3>Strength of Personality: People Who Are Unafraid to Be Single Have Psychologically Healthy Personality Profiles</h3>
<li>They are less <a>neurotic</a>.</li>
<li>They get their feelings hurt less often.</li>
<li>They are less sensitive to rejection.</li>
<li>They are less <a>lonely</a>.</li>
<li>They are less <a>depressed</a>.</li>
<li>They are a bit more open.</li>
<li>They are a bit more <a>extraverted</a>.</li>
<li>If they have a romantic partner, their <a>self-esteem</a> does not depend on whether their partner is being nice to them.</li>
<h3>The Skillful Navigation of Romantic Relationships: People Unafraid to Be Single Are Really Good at That</h3>
<p>People who are unafraid of being single have standards:</p>
<li>When they are in an unsatisfying romantic relationship, they are more likely to break it off than are people who are afraid of being single.</li>
<h3>Navigating the End of Romantic Relationships: People Unafraid to Be Single Are Better at That, Too</h3>
<p>People who are unafraid of being single are at a <a>distinct advantage </a>if they are in a romantic relationship that ends.</p>
<li>In the month following a breakup, people who are unafraid of being single are less likely to try to renew contact with their ex, and they also experience less longing for their ex.</li>
<li>Long after their breakup, they are less likely to continue pining for their ex.</li>
<h3>A Profile of Skills and Advantages, Rather Than Deficits and Disadvantages</h3>
<a>stereotyped</a> in negative and demeaning ways. It can take a lot of psychological strength to stand up to all that
<a>singlism</a>. Single people who succeed at doing so, and remain fearless about living single, have all sorts of skills and advantages that have long gone unrecognized.

<h1> How Your Beliefs About Single People Can Affect Them </h1>
<h2> The subtle ways stereotypes can become self-fulfilling prophecies. </h2>
<li>Studies confirm that people's expectations of others can be conveyed nonverbally and shape others' behavior.</li>
<li>Those who who believe that singles are miserable, lonely, and desperate to find The One can get single people to doubt themselves.</li>
<li>For some, being single is their most meaningful, fulfilling, and authentic life.</li>
<p>When I talk about people’s stereotypes about singles, one of the reactions I sometimes get is, “So what?” Why, the skeptics are asking, should I care about what other people think, even if it is negative and wrong.</p>
<h3>Early Studies of Expectancy Effects</h3>

<li>They taught those students more material and more difficult material.</li>
<li>They gave those students more opportunities to show what they knew – for instance, by waiting longer for an answer before moving on to the next student.</li>
<p>In other contexts (such as medical settings or courtrooms), the particular ways in which expectations are conveyed may differ, but the point gets across and behavior is shaped.</p>

<h1> Why Fewer People Find Fulfillment in Romantic Relationships </h1>
<h2> For married Americans, a drop from 31 percent to 13. </h2>
<p>Earlier this year (2021), the Pew Research Center asked a representative sample of adults in the U.S. this question:</p>
<blockquote> <p>“What about your life do you currently find meaningful, fulfilling or satisfying? What keeps you going and why?”</p> </blockquote>
<p>Participants’ answers were coded into 16 categories. Below are the percentages of people who mentioned each category as a source of meaning or fulfillment in 2021, for the US and averaged across all 17 places.</p>
<p>1. Family and children: 49 percent US, 38 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>2. Friends and community: 20 percent US, 18 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>3. Material well-being: 18 percent US, 19 percent all 17 places:</p>
<p>4. Occupation and <a>career</a>: 17 percent US, 25 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>5. <a>Spirituality</a>, faith, and religion: 15 percent US, 2 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>6. Society and institutions: 14 percent US, 14 percent all 17 places:</p>
<p>7. Physical and mental health: 11 percent US, 17 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>8. Hobbies and recreation: 10 percent US, 10 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>9. Freedom and independence: 9 percent US, 12 percent all 17 places:</p>
<p>10. Romantic partner, romantic love: 9 percent US, 4 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>11. Service or civic engagement: 7 percent US, 3 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>13. Nature and the outdoors: 4 percent US, 5 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>14. Travel and new experiences: 3 percent US, 3 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>15. <a>Retirement</a>: 3 percent US, 2 percent all 17 places</p>
<p>16. <a>Pets</a>: 3 percent US, 1 percent all 17 places</p>
<h3>In the US in 2021, Only 9 percent Found Fulfillment in a Spouse, Romantic Partner, Marriage, Dating, or Romantic Love</h3>
<a>divorced</a>, or had always been single, the percentage who found meaning or fulfillment in a romantic partner or romantic love decreased from 2017 to 2021. But the decline was most striking for the married people:
<li>From 31 percent in 2017 to 13 percent in 2021: Married people</li>
<li>From 21 percent in 2017 to 16 percent in 2021: People living with a romantic partner</li>
<li>From 9 percent in 2017 to 3 percent in 2021: People who had always been single</li>
<li>From 8 percent in 2017 to 1 percent in 2021: Divorced people</li>
<p>Overall, in the US, romantic themes did not even rank in the top half of the sources of meaning and fulfillment. Nine of the 16 categories were mentioned more often, and one of them, freedom and independence, was mentioned just as often.</p>
<h3>More Than Twice as Many Americans Found Meaning in Friends Than in Romantic Partners</h3>
<a>romantic relationships</a>, social lives, and spending time with others in their network. That’s more than twice as many as found meaning in romantic relationships (9 percent).
<p>Australians were most likely to find meaning and satisfaction in friends and community (28 percent), followed by adults in the Netherlands and New Zealand (25 percent each) and Sweden and the UK (24 percent each).</p>
<a>single at heart</a>. Research shows that
<a>single people invest more in their friends</a> than coupled people do, and they enjoy payoffs in
<a>self-esteem</a> following that investment. People who
<a>choose to be single</a> value their friends even more than single people who do not want to be single.
<h3>Over Time, More Americans Found Meaning and Fulfillment in Freedom and Independence</h3>
<p>Only one other category showed a bigger increase over time, the very broad category of “society, places, and institutions.” The percentage of people finding meaning in that category increased from 8 percent to 14 percent.</p>

<h1> Is It Harder to Be a Single Man or a Single Woman? </h1>
<h2> Men seen as immature, and women ignored and disempowered. </h2>
<li>Historically, gender differences in living single were rooted in the roles assigned to men and women in traditional marriages. </li>
<li>Employers prefer to interview married men over single men, and to want to pay the married men more.</li>
<li>Many inequities commonly identified as sexism are, in fact, rooted at least as deeply in singlism.</li>

<h1> For Single People, Gift-Giving Is Rarely Reciprocal </h1>
<h2> The complicated psychological dynamics of giving. </h2>
<li>When one friend is single and has no kids and the other is married and has kids, gift-giving is often not reciprocal. </li>
<li>The psychological dynamics of gift-giving imbalances are complicated. </li>
<li>Some new practices are emerging that help recognize and celebrate single people. </li>
<p>Single people have many <a>achievements and milestones</a> worth celebrating, but those accomplishments are rarely commemorated with gifts from others. Sometimes they are not even acknowledged.</p>
<a>shame</a> Carrie for buying expensive shoes. Carrie, who had spent thousands of dollars celebrating Kyra’s
<a>marriage</a> and children, wasn’t having it and responded memorably. Legions of single women rejoiced.
<a>singlehood</a> and gift-giving in blogs, columns, advice columns, and radio shows, then analyzed them. They described their findings in “
<a>It’s my turn now: How and why ‘single’ women complain about non-reciprocal gift-giving</a>,” published in a recent issue of Sociology.
<p>Kravel-Tovi and Lahad quoted an advice columnist, herself married with children, who was asked about all the gifts that single people give to their friends and relatives who marry. She told single people that they should just suck it up:</p>
<a>career</a> showers, social clubs, and registries specifically catering to singles.” That, I think, is one of the most important answers: We need to acknowledge and celebrate single people’s milestones and accomplishments.

<p>According to the <a>DSM-5</a>, individuals with BPD exhibit some or all of the following symptoms:</p>
<li>Efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment.</li>
<li>Intense bouts of anger, <a>depression</a>, or <a>anxiety</a> that may last only hours or, at most, a few days. These may be associated with episodes of impulsive <a>aggression</a>, <a>self-injury</a>, and drug or <a>alcohol abuse</a>.</li>
<a>career</a> plans, jobs, friendships,
<a>identity</a>, and values. Sometimes people with BPD view themselves as fundamentally bad or unworthy. They may feel

<p>Although the cause of BPD is unknown, both environmental and genetic factors are thought to play a role in predisposing people to BPD. The disorder is approximately five times more common among people with close biological relatives with BPD. </p>
<p>Studies show that many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse, neglect, or separation as young children. Forty to 71 percent of BPD patients report having been sexually abused, usually by a non-<a>caregiver</a>.</p>
<div> <h3> Is childhood trauma a cause of borderline personality? </h3> </div>
<a>trauma</a>. Research elsewhere shows similar evidence, where about 80 percent of people with BPD experience childhood emotional neglect, physical abuse, or 
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy (CBT), and psychodynamic psychotherapy, have been studied and proven to be effective ways to alleviate symptoms.
