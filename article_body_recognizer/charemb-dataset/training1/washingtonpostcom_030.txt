<div><h1>Could 2022 be a better, healthier year? Ten reasons to be cautiously optimistic.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steven Petrow</div></div>Contributing columnist </span></div></span></div><div>December 30, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>

<div><div>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</div></div>
<div><div><p>Not so fast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Incredibly, more Americans have died of this virus in 2021, with vaccines readily available, than in 2020. Suddenly, it seems, the light at the end of the tunnel has dimmed if not gone out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Facing yet another year of illness and death, how could any of us be optimistic about 2022? Why should anyone be optimistic? Why should anyone believe things will ever get better?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And yet, there is reason for hope — 10 reasons, in fact.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Who’s resilient? Why you are.</b></p></div></div>
<b> </b>overcoming challenges, recovering and bouncing back from adversity — as they did before the pandemic, according to the
<a>University of Michigan National Poll on Healthy Aging</a>. And 15 percent said they actually felt more resilient.
<div><div><p>“Adversity is painful,” Friedman said, “but it can also make us stronger and better.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>We’ve learned what precautions to take to once again (mostly) live our lives.</b></p></div></div>
<a>This is not March 2020</a>.” Nearly two years into the pandemic, we better understand how to take care of ourselves and our loved ones: get vaccinated and boosted, wear masks indoors, keep a distance and get tested.
<b/>Starting in January, the federal government plans to distribute hundreds of millions of
<a>free at-home tests</a> and to expand coronavirus testing sites across the country. And this month, the Food and Drug Administration
<a>approved two pills</a> that high-risk patients with coronavirus can take at home to greatly reduce their chances of being hospitalized.
<div><p>With omicron, many vaccinated Americans will at some point test positive. Here’s what to do.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Free coronavirus vaccines and booster shots are (finally) widely available</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>Your questions about coronavirus vaccines, answered</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>The success of mRNA vaccines bodes well for cancer treatments.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>And we’re winning the war on cancer — slowly.</b></p></div></div>
<a>American Cancer Society</a>. When it comes to lung cancer, the No. 1 cancer killer,
<a>five-year survival rates</a> have improved due to immunotherapies and targeted therapies.
<div><div><p>Five years ago in December, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which dedicates $1.8 billion in funding for cancer research over seven years — and cancer patients are now benefiting.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p> <b>Scientists are regaining trust.</b></p></div></div>
<a>report published in November by Wellcome Trust</a>, a health research foundation in London. Around the world, 43 percent of people surveyed in 113 countries said they trust scientists “a lot,” an increase from 34 percent in 2018.
<div><div><p> <b>The FDA approved a new shot to prevent HIV.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Some employers are offering more health benefits.</b></p></div></div>
<a>employers and human resources professionals</a> found an uptick in offerings this year.
<div><p>One reason so many are quitting: We want control over our lives again</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Finding community online can be a very good thing.</b></p></div></div>
<a>Teletherapy options</a> grew exponentially amid the pandemic, which many therapists say has made it easier for those struggling with mental health issues to seek help and make it to their appointments. No worries about parking.
<div><div><p><b>Being outdoors is good for our health.</b></p></div></div>
<a>outside more</a>, according to multiple studies. Those benefits include lower blood pressure and reduced stress, improved mood, and decreased anxiety and depression, better focus and even quicker healing.
<a>One study</a> reported patients who spent time outdoors upon discharge after surgery required fewer painkillers, had fewer complications and experienced shorter hospital stays. And don’t forget the Japanese practice of
<a>shinrin-yoku or forest bathing</a>, which could improve cardiovascular and mental health.

<div><h1>‘I’m not drinking right now.’ You don’t need to have a problem to take a break.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Melissa Urban</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>December 30, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s not just me; millions of people are getting curious about sobriety.</p></div></div>
<a>spikes in alcohol sales</a>, the past few years have also brought an increased demand for beverages with low or no alcohol. More people are mentioning “
<a>nonalcoholic beverages</a>”on social media, doing searches for “
<a>benefits of quitting drinking</a>” and ordering craft mocktails. In August, Gallup found that 60 percent of U.S. adults reported drinking alcoholic beverages, down from 65 percent in 2019 and on the
<a>low end of rates</a> reported over the past two decades.
<div><div><p>More and more people are starting to look at the role alcohol plays in our lives and ask, “Is this still serving me?” And many of us are taking a good, hard look and saying, “Not really, no.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One night on the couch with my now-husband, I questioned out loud whether I even needed alcohol in my life any more. I rarely drank at that point, and when I did, I enjoyed it less than I used to.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Why don’t you take some time off?” he suggested. I immediately agreed, deciding I wouldn’t drink that month along with the rest of the September Whole30’ers.</p></div></div>
<a>LaCroix</a> and zero-proof cocktails all month long, citing my Whole30-esque commitment.
<div><div><p>About mid-October, I realized that technically my experiment was over — I was so happy with how things were going I didn’t even notice.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It turns out, all I needed in social settings were those two little words: “right now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of the biggest challenges to maintaining any health commitment is the social pressure, and the pressure around alcohol is intense. (I’ve heard it said that alcohol is the only drug we have to justify not using.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Let’s rate your options on an effectiveness scale of 1 to 10. (Yes, I made this up, but I have over a decade of experience here, and it’s accurate.)</p></div></div>
<b>●Fake drinking, like ordering a sparkling water with lime and pretending it’s a vodka tonic:</b>
<b> 2/10.</b> Please don’t do this — you’ll feel like a self-conscious impostor all night, and the risk of getting caught and having to explain yourself twice-over (or drink a real vodka soda you don’t want) is too great.
<div><div><p>Perhaps the most surprising part, however, was the impact those two little words had on my self-awareness and self-confidence.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I’m not drinking right now.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Her recovery went far beyond surgeries and physical therapy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Running into trouble: Eager pandemic exercisers rack up injuries</p></div>
<p>Allen, too, said that her devastating injuries led her to reevaluate what running meant to her and how she was going to approach healing from a mental perspective, in addition to all the physical rehabilitation and surgeries she would undergo.</p>
<div><div><p>But there are ways of training your mind and spirit and recalibrating your expectations to ease the fear and insecurity of returning to your sport, and enlarge your appreciation of it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Address your fears</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gonzalez helps athletes understand their mental response to injuries with the metaphor of a windup toy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why athletes should treat the brain like a muscle</p></div>
<div><div><p>No matter its source, fear needs to be addressed if athletes are going to return to their sport, said Julia Kim, a clinical psychologist at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Understand your 'why'</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Part of finding that path back to your sport is also remembering why you are doing it, she said. Some play a sport by choice while others see it as a core part of their identity.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“People who do reasonably well do so because they can adapt,” Kim said. “It’s because they’re not doing it because they need it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you see sport as the only way to feel good about yourself, you could benefit from developing other ways. If physical activity is your outlet for stress, find other outlets, Kim advised.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Need a quick stress reliever? Try one of these surprising science-based strategies.</p></div>
<p>“We should all have several ways in our tool kit on how to cope with stress,” Kim said. “Because if you take one away, let’s say you’re sidelined, then what? And typically, we actually need several backups.”</p>
<div><div><p>Kim understands the frustration of injury. She is a longtime cyclist who has had many surgeries. She said she is frustrated when she cannot bike.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“But it’s not that it affects who I am or how I think of myself,” Kim said. “It’s that ability to adapt. You’re not going to adapt when you feel you have to have it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Accept and adapt</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said she has worked with many athletes who took a long time to accept that they need to adapt to other sports or activities.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She advises athletes to use everything they were putting into their performance into their recovery.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Allen said her hero’s journey back to running felt like putting on armor and discovering how she was strong in ways besides running.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I realized the strength in asking for help and relying on a community and the process of healing and training,” she said. “And you know, to me, that almost means more than a finishing time.”</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Juli Fraga</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 2, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>When it comes to relationships, friendships are more than social ties. For many of us, friends are strong sources of emotional support, especially when tragedies knock life off track.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Eloise Skinner, an entrepreneur in London can relate.</p></div></div>
<p>“At the start of the pandemic, my friends made a collective effort to connect via Zoom, but as life ramped up, our hangouts faded,” she says. With fewer chats and starting a new job, Skinner began to feel distant from some of her pals.</p>
<div><div><p>Rekindling friendships requires action, and reaching out can be challenging, says Marisa Franco, a clinical psychologist and friendship expert.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why you always think your friends are mad at you — even when they’re not</p></div>
<div><div><p>Despite some trepidation, many people are eager to see friends and socialize. But navigating these relationships in the age of covid can feel like driving to a new destination without a map.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For those looking to rekindle friendships and start anew this year, taking small steps can help, Ayers says. Here are some expert-backed tips to help guide you.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Manage social worries</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>To rebuild social stamina, flex this muscle slowly. “Hang out with someone you feel comfortable with and create a time limit around the interaction,” the psychologist suggests.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The pandemic has been hard on friendships. Here’s how to reconnect.</p></div>
<div><div><p>For their first in-person get-together, Skinner and her best friend merely met for a walk and coffee. “It was a nice way to catch up, and we didn’t feel any time pressure,” she says.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And while social anxiety can be jarring, this fearful feeling rarely reflects how friends perceive us.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Adjust expectations</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>The friendship checkup: How to reevaluate relationships and take steps to repair them</p></div>
<div><div><p>“With one of my besties, our friendship definitely changed,” says Sarah Sati, a mindfulness educator in Northern California.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Friendships are imperfect, and reconnecting can stir up feelings of disappointment and frustration,” clinical psychologist Patricia E. Zurita Ona says. Adjusting expectations is one way to handle these tough emotions.</p></div>
<p>Accept that differences may arise, Zurita Ona says. Start by acknowledging the feeling and ask yourself, “What does this emotion want me to do?” Then ask, “Is this action consistent with how I want to show up as a friend?”</p>
<div><div><p>Zurita Ona explains that emotions are signals that prompt behaviors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For instance, anger can compel confrontation while disappointment might feed avoidance. Clarifying our feelings can help turn reactions into well-meaning responses, Zurita Ona says.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Practice self-compassion</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Many friendships have changed during the pandemic because the pandemic has changed us,” Franco says. But when friendships shift, we may be quick to label ourselves as “bad friends.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Be kinder to yourself. Research shows it could make you healthier.</p></div>
<p>Finally, decide how you want to show up in the situation. When the relationship with her workout buddy stalled, Sati didn’t beat herself up. “Instead, I made a conscious choice to align with friends who share my values,” she says.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Joy Seek</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spending time with friends can help us weather rough patches. Along with companionship, research shows that supportive friendships are good for physical health, emotional well-being and longevity.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Struggling to find happiness while you’re stuck at home? Experts say contentment is enough.</p></div>
<div><div><p>To reap these benefits, Greif recommends “dwelling in affection.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Emotions are one of the building blocks of relationships, including friendships, and form the basis for long-lasting connections,” Zurita Ona says.</p></div></div>

<p>Research published in JAMA Network Open suggests that testing menstrual blood is as accurate as conventional HPV screening — and better at identifying negatives and identifying certain subtypes of HPV than commonly used testing methods.</p>

<div><div><p>Researchers collected used menstrual pads from 120 premenopausal patients in Wuhan, China. All had already been diagnosed with types of HPV that are considered high-risk because of their likelihood to grow into cancer.</p></div></div>
<p>A DNA analysis of the blood on the pads allowed the researchers to accurately pinpoint high-risk HPV status in 94.2 percent of the patients. The analysis was better at detecting HPV strains and infection with multiple strains than cervical testing.</p>

<a><h2>With omicron, many vaccinated Americans will at some point test positive. Here’s what to do. </h2></a>
<p>From at-home care to evaluating an emergency, here's what to do if you get a breakthrough coronavirus infection.</p>
<a><h2>Your questions on the coronavirus, answered: JJ shot and booster vs. omicron?</h2></a>
<p>We know that Johnson Johnson recipients who got boosted with an mRNA shot are well protected against the delta variant. But omicron is far more slippery.</p>
<a><h2>Your questions on the coronavirus, answered: What home supplies should you have if someone is infected?</h2></a>
<p>It’s a good idea to keep some basic supplies at your home if you do get a case of covid-19 that doesn’t require hospitalization.</p>
<a><h2>What you need to know about the coronavirus variants</h2></a>
<p>Scientists are racing to learn more about the omicron variant after the World Health Organization designated it a top-level "variant of concern."</p>
<a><h2>Your questions about covid-19, answered: Are vaccinated people who have breakthrough infection less contagious?</h2></a>
<p>The vaccinated do appear to be less contagious than the unvaccinated — or at least contagious for a shorter period of time.</p>
<a><h2>Your questions about covid, answered: Is there reliable data about Russian vaccines?</h2></a>
<p>Peer-reviewed data indicates the shots, which are used in several dozen countries, work well in preventing severe illness. But questions linger about the quality of the research.</p>
<a><h2>Your questions about covid-19, answered: Can children get the 2nd dose later than 3 weeks?</h2></a>
<p>Three weeks is the recommended interval between the children’s shots, but health officials and experts say it’s okay to get the doses four, five or even six weeks apart.</p>
<a><h2>Your questions on the coronavirus, answered: What covid-illnesses are covered as disability?</h2></a>
<p>Qualifying for disability benefits — including for an illness caused by covid-19 — can be a complex, sometimes laborious process.</p>

<a>news release</a> Wednesday. Families Together said one of the members “sustained serious injuries and was sent to the hospital in an ambulance” but that both workers “are expected to make a full recovery within a few days.”
<a>Orange County Register</a>. Jahanbani recounted to the
<a>Los Angeles Times</a> that it took multiple people at the clinic to pry Apollo away from a medical assistant he was beating up and that seven police officers were needed to restrain the man over about 15 minutes.
<div><div><p>Apollo, of Poway, Calif., was arrested and booked into the Orange County jail Thursday on suspicion of battery and resisting arrest, according to police. He was released on bail Friday, records show.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We know the case is now in the hands of the District Attorney’s office and we hope it proceeds in enforcing the full extent of the law,” Rossel said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Apollo did not respond to a request for comment. It’s unclear whether he has an attorney.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>After Apollo walked into the clinic without a mask before 10 a.m., workers asked him to put a mask on, according to police. When Apollo refused, he was asked to leave.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“He said, ‘I don’t need a mask, I don’t have the virus, and you are the ones making people sick,’ ” Jahanbani, 37, told the Register. “And just every type of profanity you can imagine.”</p></div>
<div><p>At one point, Apollo pinned down the medical assistant, who declined to be publicly identified in local media, and landed “a few pretty strong punches” to the official’s head, chest and back, Jahanbani told the Times.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It was one of my biggest fears coming true,” Jahanbani said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He was shouting, ‘You’re a part of this, too!’ at the officers,” Jahanbani told the outlet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Families Together said it was “extremely saddened” by the attack but that nothing would stop its workers from administering vaccine doses to people who want them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re proud of the strength and bravery of our team, and while this incident has shaken us, we will not be deterred from our mission to keep our community safe and healthy,” the group wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jahanbani told the Register that he was ready to forgive Apollo for the attack — and hopes he understands why vaccination is necessary to help stop the spread of the virus.</p></div></div>
<p>“This isn’t a man-made problem,” Jahanbani said. “It’s happening to humanity, and we all have to unite together against it. We all want things to go back to normal, and that’s why we’re doing this.”</p>
