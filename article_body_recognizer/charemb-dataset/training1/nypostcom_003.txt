<h1> Woman who binged 32 sushi rolls at all-you-can-eat buffet rushed to hospital</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 12:29pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 1:58pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>This California woman was on a roll. </p>
<p>Danielle Shapiro, 24, wanted to get her money’s worth at a $50 all-you-can-eat sushi buffet at Sushi 85 restaurant in Mountain View, California, last month.</p>
<p>But after indulging a little too much, including 32 rolls of sushi, her uncooked delights left her feeling a bit raw inside. </p>
<p>Following the binge, Shapiro was rushed to the emergency room with severe stomach pains. That’s where she was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease, commonly known as acid reflux.</p>
<p>Shapiro shared the experience in a TikTok on Dec. 23, in which she shows off the mountains of food she consumed in one sitting, and the subsequent trip to the hospital that left her with IVs in her arms.</p>
<p>Her warning to sushi lovers has since gone viral with over 11.3 million views.</p>
<p>“All you can eat sushi gone wrong… ,” she captioned her snap. In a video shared on Dec. 22, she went into greater detail about her experience.</p>
<a>Mayo Clinic</a>. Acid reflux is extremely common, and can happen to virtually anyone, as
<a>about 60 million</a> Americans experience symptoms in any given month, while
<a>researchers estimate</a> about 20% of people in the US suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease.
<p>Symptoms include heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation of food or sour liquid and difficulty swallowing.</p>
<p>Following treatment, Shapiro admitted it took several days to recover and feel normal again.</p>

<h1> Michael Phelps: NCAA’s Lia Thomas issue shows need for level playing field</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 6:33pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 12:57pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Michael Phelps says the controversy surrounding NCAA swimmer Lia Thomas is “very complicated.”</p>
<p>Thomas, a transgender swimmer on the women’s team at the University of Pennsylvania, competed for three years as a male. NCAA bylaws permit transgender athletes to compete as women if they have undergone testosterone suppression for a year.</p>
<p>Phelps, appearing with CNN’s Christiane Amanpour last week, spoke to the issue as one of doping, saying he doesn’t believe he’s competed in a fair field in his whole career.</p>
<p>Thomas has been demolishing female competition. There is a chance she could not only win national championships, but compete for all-time NCAA records set by Olympic gold medalists Missy Franklin and Katie Ledecky.</p>
<p>None of Thomas’ teammates have spoken on the record about their opinion on the matter, though some have chosen to do so anonymously to voice their concerns. </p>
<p>Phelps, who won 13 individual gold medals as an Olympic swimmer, continued to advocate for a level playing field in swimming.</p>

<h1> Netflix hikes subscription prices in US and Canada by $1-$2 a month</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 4:03pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 4:03pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Inflation isn’t just hitting consumer goods, it’s also hitting Netflix. </p>
<p>The Los Gatos, Calif.-based company has raised its monthly subscription prices by $1 to $2 a month in the US depending on the plan, in order to help it pay for programming costs, the company said. </p>
<p>Shares of the streaming giant jumped over 2 percent following the announcement Friday.</p>
<p>The monthly cost for the basic plan increased to $9.99 from $8.99, while the standard plan jumped to $15.49 from $13.99 and the premium plan rose to $19.99 from $17.99, according to Netflix’s website.</p>
<a>2020</a>. Wall Street has been banking on Netflix to increase prices as
<a>new subscriber growth slows</a>. The price hikes also reflect the company’s confidence that customers will not cancel the service due to a small price increase.
<a>told</a> Reuters. We’re updating our prices so that we can continue to offer a wide variety of quality entertainment options. As always we offer a range of plans so members can pick a price that works for their budget.”
<p>The company said the new rates will apply to new subscribers immediately. Existing customers will receive an email about the price increases 30 days before they see it on their bills.</p>
<h1> Billy Bush ‘livid’ over ‘Today’ snub in 70th anniversary video</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 14, 2022 5:07pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 5:07pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Billy Bush is said to be “livid” over his exclusion from a video aired Friday commemorating the 70-year history of the “Today” show. </p>
<p>Bush was fired from “Today” in 2016 after footage leaked from his former show “Access Hollywood,” in which he <a>engaged in lewd talk in an outtake with Donald Trump</a> in 2005. </p>
<p>The infamous tape ended Bush’s stint on NBC’s powerful morning show after a mere two months — and according to Bush himself, sent him down <a>a spiral marked by months of heavy drinking, loafing on the couch and crying</a>.</p>
<a>even the disgraced Matt Lauer.</a>
<a>ousted from NBC in 2017</a> amid accusations of
<a>sexual misconduct and assault,</a> appeared briefly a few times in the video — including one snippet of Lauer on 9/11 and another reporting from Egypt, standing in front of the Sphinx wearing khaki shorts and shades.
<a>accused of anally raping a young staff member</a> while on a work trip — but chose not to include Billy, you know something is very wrong.”
<p>NBC declined to comment. Bush didn’t return requests for comment.</p>
<p>The show even unearthed old black and white clips featuring the likes of Frank Blair, John Chancellor and Barbara Walters.</p>
<p>“It is like Billy never existed,” the source said, calling NBC a network of “mean girls.” </p>
<p>In TV circles, Bush, who now hosts entertainment show “Extra,” is called “Bully Bush” by some for his demanding ways.</p>
<p>“The ‘Today’ show is like an old girlfriend he can’t quit,” the source said. “He’s obsessed. He needs to let it go.”</p>

<h1> Don’t expect MLB labor talks to help out fans</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 15, 2022 2:44pm <div> Updated <div> January 15, 2022 2:44pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>As Mike Tyson said, “Everyone has plans until they get hit.”</p>
<p>Several issues from the MLB-MLBPA negotiations have already been agreed upon. That is, they’ve been dismissed under the polite designation NSGAD — neither side gives a damn.</p>
<p>You suppose either side, heading in, bothered with, “We’d better throw something in this for fans, something to curry favor with those who ultimately count the most?”</p>
<p>From the movie, “Fat Chance.”</p>
<p>If only I could weasel my way in, to be the public advocate in these discussions. What fun we’d have. Some proposals:</p>
<p>1. Fans discovered in Dumpsters or restrooms trying to avoid payment to the second game of two-admission doubleheaders will be sentenced to wear one of Peter Rosenberg’s gravy-stained pro wrestling T-shirts.</p>
<p>2. The total elimination of 1 p.m. Saturday games as they mostly attract families with kids.</p>
<p>3. Full rain checks for delays that exceed eight hours, the next day’s dawn or the kickoff of the Army-Navy game.</p>
<p>4. The profit on all drinks and food sold to patrons is not to exceed 250 percent per pour or item. Artificial cheese squirts applied as nacho toppings will carry expiration dates — not for the goo, but for those who eat it.</p>
<p>5. Half-priced parking during all away games.</p>
<p>And now both parties must fight for their cuts of fans’ guaranteed losses and licensing fees as per Rob “Seven Innings” Manfred-certified, bad-odds gambling.</p>
<p>I don’t care how and when this MLB crisis ends, all I know is that the most significant party — The Game’s fans — will not be consulted or considered. You will be ignored. Again.</p>
<p>That’s my plan while awaiting MLB’s next punch in the face.</p>
<h2>Sanders’ past casts shadow on Jackson St.</h2>
<p>Recall Bishop Sycamore, the high school football team that this season played on ESPN despite its non-existence as a legit school? It made national news and, for ESPN, well-earned embarrassment — despite being downplayed on ESPN.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Sanders left a lot of kids, seeking athletic scholarships to colleges, and a few remaining employees in the lurch.</p>
<p>Yet Jackson State didn’t see Sanders’ scandalous recent past as a deterrent from hiring him as its head coach.</p>
<p>Now, as Sanders somehow has been able to land top recruits to Jackson State, raising questions as to whether Sanders and the school, as others allegedly have done, have dangled NIL money to influence or bribe recruits.</p>
<p>College coach Sanders, ostensibly a graduate of Florida State, has vehemently denied that with, “We ain’t got no money!”</p>
<p>And, according to Post colleague Andrew Marchand, they’re going to dangle as a purchasing enticement a studio-show possibly starring often indecipherable, crotch-grabbing, public speaker of unfiltered vulgarities, Marshawn Lynch.</p>
<p>Yep, that should do it! The worst they can do is the best they can do.</p>
<h2>Don’t be so friendly, Francisco</h2>
<p>Reader Richard Kelly has an idea for new Mets manager Buck Showalter: Have Francisco Lindor, “the zillionaire .230 hitting shortstop, stop yukking it up at second base with opponents who just hit a bases-clearing double.”</p>
<p>For once I’m with Charles Barkley. <a>Kyrie Irving is impossible to root for</a>. And Barkley should know.</p>
<p>Can’t even watch the U.S. Olympic figure skating trials on NBC without get-rich-quick sports gambling ads.</p>
<p>Nightmare Saturday night. I dreamed I was so rich I wrote big checks to Antonio Brown. I woke up in a sweat, but thoroughly relieved to not have that kind of dough.</p>
<p>Lots of fond recollection to my farewell here Friday to actor Dwayne Hickman, who played Dobie Gillis, CBS 1959-63, and died last Sunday at 87.</p>
<p>When Milton was asked if he was running for school office on behalf of the junior class, he replied, “No, on behalf of the ruling class.”</p>

<h1> Russell Wilson wouldn’t talk Seahawks future on ‘Manningcast’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 5:40pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 5:40pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>There was reportedly an agreement for Russell Wilson not to be asked about his future with the Seahawks on Monday night’s “Manningcast.”</p>
<p>Wilson appeared on the ESPN2 simulcast of the Rams-Cardinals playoff game with Peyton and Eli Manning, and never addressed the elephant in the room: whether he wishes to return to the Seahawks in 2022.</p>
<p>“It appears there was an agreement not to ask Russell Wilson his Seahawks future/hoopla about it on the Peyton Eli Manning telecast of Rams-Cardinals,” the Tacoma News-Tribune reported.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, NFL Network reported Wilson wants to “explore his options” this offseason. </p>
<p>Wilson, late in the season, made remarks that indicated he planned to stay in Seattle.</p>
<p>“We’ve always thought I would be here,” Wilson said. “That’s been always my goal, to win multiple Super Bowls, and my plan is to be here and do that. You take every day and you just enjoy the moment.”</p>
<p>The Seahawks finished 7-10 this season, last in the NFC West and without looking like they will be a championship contender in the immediate term. </p>
<p>Wilson has two years remaining on his contract and a no-trade clause, so Seattle would have to work to accommodate him on a destination if they decided they would like to ship him off for a bounty of draft picks and do a total rebuild. </p>
<p>For those into tea leaf-reading, Wilson ended the segment with the Mannings with a “Go Hawks!”</p>

<h1> Microsoft buying scandal-ridden Activision-Blizzard for $69B</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 9:19am <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 5:22pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Microsoft said Tuesday that it plans to buy the scandal-ridden developer behind Call of Duty and World of Warcraft for $68.7 billion in cash, marking what would be the biggest gaming deal in history.</p>
<p>“This is the biggest tech MA deal ever,” Ives told The Post. “Microsoft is not messing around.” </p>
<p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the deal would “usher in a new era of gaming that puts players and creators first and makes gaming safe, inclusive and accessible to all.”</p>
<p>Activision-Blizzard CEO <a>Bobby Kotick allegedly helped hide sexual misconduct and once threatened to have his own assistant killed</a>, according to the Wall Street Journal. </p>
<p>The stream of revelations caused Activision-Blizzard’s share price to tank from more than $100 per share at some points in early 2021 to less than $60 in December. Microsoft is now paying $95 per share. </p>
<p>To be sure, it’s unusual for a CEO who sells a company to stay on, people close to the deal add.</p>
<p>“He’s not going to report to a division head at Microsoft,” a person close to Kotick said. “He was smart to make it all-cash so he can just walk away.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Activision-Blizzard has fired or pushed out more than three dozen lower-level employees and disciplined about 40 others in connection to the sexual misconduct scandal, the <a>Journal reported on Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>The deal will give Microsoft ammunition in the escalating war for control over of the so-called “metaverse” — a growing world of <a>virtual reality that has been popularized by Mark Zuckerberg</a>. </p>
<p>“Gaming is the most dynamic and exciting category in entertainment across all platforms today and will play a key role in the development of metaverse platforms,” Nadella said. </p>
<p>The deal is set to be the largest in a series of high-profile acquisitions by Microsoft in recent years. </p>

<h1> Spain starts cracking down on crypto ads, may put limits on ‘influencers’</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 12:58pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 12:58pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Regulators in Spain are tightening the rules on how social media influencers and others can advertise for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The government in Madrid said it would require “influencers” with more than 100,000 followers on social media to give at least a 10-day notice in advance before posting messages urging people to invest in any digital coins.</p>
<p>Crypto advertisers must show the content of their messages to the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), which is Spain’s equivalent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, according to Reuters.</p>
<p>Anyone promoting cryptocurrencies must also include a disclaimer warning their followers of the potential risk in investing, as per the new regulations.</p>
<p>In November, the CNMV used its official Twitter account to post a note of caution in response to soccer star Andrés Iniesta.</p>
<p>Iniesta, a former player with national powerhouse FC Barcelona, told his 25 million followers that he started trading in cryptocurrency using the Binance exchange.</p>
<p>But the CNMV replied to the tweet, saying that “cryptoassets, being unregulated products, carry some significant risks.”</p>
<p>Celebrities with massive social media followings have promoted cryptocurrency. In some cases, that has led to lawsuits.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Kim Kardashian and boxer Floyd Mayweather were named in a lawsuit filed with Los Angeles federal court accusing them of misleading their fans into buying crypto as part of a “pump and dump” scheme.</p>
<p>Kardashian and Mayweather were accused of making “false or misleading statement” while promoting a crypto token sold by EthereumMax, or EMAX.</p>
<p>Kardashian promoted an ad for EthereumMax last June on her Instagram account, when she had 250 million followers.</p>
<p>“Are you guys into crypto???? This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends told me about the ethereum max token!” Kardashian wrote.</p>
<p>The posts by Kardashian and Mayweather helped catapult the value of EthereumMax by a whopping 1,300% before dipping to “an all-time low” just a month afterward, it has been alleged.</p>
<p>Those who purchased EthereumMax between May 14 and June 27 of last year were named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.</p>
<p><a>US officials are also trying to figure out how to regulate the global cryptocurrency market</a> that is valued at north of $3 trillion. </p>
<p>Top economic policymakers from some of the world’s leading bodies, including the International Monetary Fund, have called for regulations of digital coins.</p>
<h1> Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky says he’ll work remotely and stay in a new rental every 2 weeks</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 4:08pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:08pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Airbnb’s CEO and co-founder says he’ll work remotely and move from city to city every couple of weeks — staying, appropriately enough, at a different Airbnb rental.</p>
<p>“Starting today, I’m living on Airbnb,” Brian Chesky tweeted on Tuesday. “I’ll be staying in a different town or city every couple of weeks.”</p>
<p>Chesky, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes to be around $12.5 billion, plans to migrate from one Airbnb to another.</p>
<p>The San Francisco resident, who insists he will return to the Bay Area “often,” tweeted his plans to decamp to Atlanta this week before going on to other destinations.</p>
<p>Chesky, 40, said he’s doing it because “it’ll be fun, but more importantly it will help us improve the experience for people who can now live anywhere.”</p>
<p>He cited his company’s own data showing a sharp increase in the number of long-term rentals since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“From July to September, 1 in 5 nights booked on Airbnb were for stays of a month or longer, and nearly half of nights booked were for stays of a week or longer,” Chesky tweeted.</p>
<p>He added: “In the past year, 100,000 Airbnb guests booked stays of 3 months or longer.”</p>
<p>“I think the pandemic has created the biggest change to travel since the advent of commercial flying,” he tweeted. </p>
<p>Chesky predicted that this year will see people “spreading out to thousands of towns and cities, staying for weeks, months, or even entire seasons at a time.”</p>
<p>“More people will start living abroad, others will travel for the entire summer, and some will even give up their leases and become digital nomads,” he tweeted.</p>
<p>“Cities and countries will compete to attract these remote workers, and it will lead to a redistribution of where people travel and live.”</p>
<a>Future Workforce Pulse Report</a>.
<p>The constant movement is likely to be accelerated by the “Great Resignation” which saw more than 20 million Americans quit their jobs in the second half of 2021, according to government data.</p>
<p>Airbnb has capitalized on the trend. Last November, the company reported record-high profits as the number of bookings surpassed its pre-pandemic figures.</p>
<p>The company reported revenue of $2.2 billion in the third quarter of 2021 — a 36% increase from the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>Last May, Chesky told shareholders that employees won’t need to return to the office until September 2022 or beyond.</p>
<p>In November, he said that Airbnb will institute a permanent “flexible” policy allowing employees to work remotely.</p>
<p>Shares of Airbnb fell by 3.4% on Tuesday after the Gordon Haskett research group downgraded the company’s stock.</p>

<h1> Netflix warns of slower subscriber growth ahead</h1>
<div> July 20, 2021 7:13pm <div> Updated <div> July 20, 2021 7:13pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Streaming giant Netflix blamed the pandemic for “lumpiness” as it predicted a slowdown in new subscriber growth on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Shares of the Los Gatos, California-based firm, known for hits like “Stranger Things,” “Bridgerton” and “The Crown,” sank nearly 2 percent in after-market trading. </p>
<p>Netflix said it brought in 1.5 million new subscribers in the second quarter, besting estimates of 1 million, but cautioned of slowing growth ahead. </p>
<p>Netflix said in the third quarter, it expects to add 3.5 million subscribers, falling short of analysts’ estimates of 5.5 million. </p>
<p>The slowdown comes at a time when rivals like HBO Max, Disney+, Amazon Prime Video and AppleTV+ are ramping up their offerings of new movies and shows, giving the streaming giant a run for its money. </p>
<p>Despite the ramped up competition, Netflix said its global subscriber tally is over 209 million, much higher than any of its competitors to date. </p>
<p>For the second quarter, Netflix reported net income of $1.35 billion or earnings a share of $2.97 on revenue totaled $7.34 billion. Analysts had been looking for EPS of $3.16 on revenue of 7.32 billion. </p>
<p>Despite the hiccup, Netflix remained optimistic, as a large amount of its new slate of content had been pushed into the second half of 2021 and 2022. </p>
<p>The company said if it hits its subscriber forecasts, it will have added more than 54 million paid subscribers in the past 24 months, which is “consistent” with its pre-COVID annual rate of net additions.</p>
<p>The company called out “Sweet Tooth” a new DC comic-inspired show, as well as “Shadow and Bone,” a fantasy series based on the popular Grishaverse book series, for bringing in new subscribers in the quarter. </p>
<h1> NY probe of NBC News began with Matt Lauer’s firing in 2017, source says</h1>
<div> May 5, 2020 1:18pm <div> Updated <div> May 5, 2020 10:41pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>State officials are investigating allegations of sexual misconduct and related cover-ups at NBC News — and have interviewed potential witnesses including Megyn Kelly, The Post has learned.</p>
<p>Kelly — who left NBC News with her $30 million contract intact following a “blackface” row in 2017 — sat down with investigators in January, according to a source familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Both Kelly and former NBC News anchor Linda Vester, who was also interviewed in January, are being represented by employment lawyer Doug Wigdor, the source said.</p>
<p>“The testimony and investigation seem to be centered on harassment and retaliation for raising other issues of harassment in the workplace, for wanting to report on issues like Matt Lauer and Harvey Weinstein,” the source said.</p>
<p>The probe is being handled by a group of officials called the “Weinstein unit,” <a>according to the Daily Mail</a>.</p>
<p>The name apparently stems from journalist Ronan Farrow’s claim that NBC executives stymied his efforts to expose sexual misconduct allegations against the since-disgraced movie mogul.</p>
<p>Farrow’s reporting was later published by the New Yorker and helped prompt criminal charges for which Weinstein is serving a 23-year prison sentence.</p>
<p>Vester, who in 2018 alleged that legendary network newsman Tom Brokaw repeatedly tried to kiss her during the 1990s, confirmed to The Post that she was interviewed for several hours on Jan. 7.</p>
<p>“In my case, they wanted to know who in management was involved in any effort to kill my story, to keep it from getting published in the Washington Post and Variety magazine,” she said.</p>
<p>Vester said investigators also asked “whether I had any information that this led all the way up to Andy Lack,” the NBC News chairman who was unexpectedly <a>ousted on Monday</a>.</p>
<p>Lack announced Lauer’s firing at the time and last year denied any prior knowledge of the alleged misconduct when Nevils went public in Farrow’s book “<a>Catch and Kill</a>.”</p>
<p>The book detailed Nevils’ claim that Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.</p>
<p>In a memo to NBC News staffers, Lack said network brass didn’t learn of Nevils’ allegations until she went to the company’s human resources department two days before Lauer was fired.</p>
<p>“Any suggestion that we knew prior to that evening or tried to cover up any aspect of Lauer’s conduct is absolutely false and offensive,” he added.</p>
<p>Lack also had a “relationship” with a young associate producer, Jennifer Laird, and turned “hostile” toward her when things ended, according to the book.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Attorney General Letitia James declined to comment but did not deny the existence of the investigation.</p>
<p>An NBC spokesman said the network was unaware of the AG’s probe and said Lack declined to comment.</p>

<h1> Charles Barkley rips Nets, Kyrie Irving over his part-time status</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 8, 2022 12:24pm </div>
<p>From Kyrie Irving’s refusal to be vaccinated to the Nets relenting and allowing their point guard to return on a part-time basis, Charles Barkley has all sorts of problems with Brooklyn. </p>
<p>After Irving’s season debut in the Nets’ win in Indiana on Wednesday, the TNT analyst ripped both the star and team on Thursday for enabling this unconventional marriage. </p>
<p>Of course, by the time he debuted, Brooklyn was whole again (with the exception of Joe Harris). </p>
<p>Barkley has personal issues with Irving’s choice not to be vaccinated — “which is silly and stupid” — and his unwillingness to do so for the good of the team. </p>
<p>“When you’re on a team, you have to make sacrifices for the team to win,” Barkley said. </p>
<p>The Nets won their first game with Irving back then <a>lost at home to the Bucks on Friday without him. </a></p>
<p>Barkley’s stance was not unanimous. Kenny Smith pointed out that Irving is not choosing to play only road games, but it is New York City’s mandate that is keeping him away. </p>
<p>“Vaccination is more than a political stance at times, too,” Smith said. “It’s a personal choice.”</p>

<div> January 16, 2022 2:37pm <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 2:45pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Seahawks’ season may be over, but the chatter about quarterback Russell Wilson’s future is continuing to ramp up.</p>
<p>Wilson is said to want to explore his options this offseason, NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported Sunday, following a disappointing year in Seattle, which saw the Seahawks finish the season at 7-10.</p>
<a>his football future has been widely speculated</a>, Wilson said earlier this month that he wishes to remain in Seattle.
<a>according to Pro Football Talk</a>. “That’s been always my goal — to win multiple Super Bowls, and my plan is to be here and do that. You take every day and you just enjoy the moment.”
<a>It was reported</a> in early January that the Seahawks have no plans to trade Wilson. He was open to waiving his no-trade clause to the Cowboys, Bears, Saints and Raiders last offseason and The Post confirmed last month he 
<a>would consider waiving the clause for the Giants</a>.

<h1> Metaverse clothing, travel, plastic surgery: Experts predict life in 2030</h1>
<div> January 8, 2022 8:08am <div> Updated <div> January 8, 2022 5:05pm </div> </div> </div>
<a>tactile-responsive haptic gloves</a>, the at-home traveler can touch the Parthenon in Athens or taste the rich foam of a Korean dalgona coffee.
<p>You wouldn’t even have to be you. Members of the metaverse could prowl the Brazilian rainforest as a jaguar or take the court at Madison Square Garden as LeBron James. The only limits are your imagination.</p>
<p>By 2030, “a large proportion of people will be in the metaverse in some way,” predicts <a>Melanie Subin</a>, a director at <a>The Future Today Institute</a> in New York City.</p>
<p>Some will simply use it “only to fulfill work or educational obligations,” she said. Others “will live the majority of their waking hours ‘jacked in.’”</p>
<p>Using a “blend of physical and behavioral biometrics, emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and personal data,” the metaverse will be able to create a customized and enhanced reality for each person, she said.</p>
<p>In the future, “AR wearables may be as pervasive as smart phones are today,” said Patrick Cozzi, who runs the 3D tech company <a>Cesium</a> and is heavily involved in enhancing the metaverse.</p>
<p>But the current version of the metaverse, for now, is somewhat less grand.</p>
<p>Still, some aspects of the future metaverse are already coming to life.</p>
<p>Recording artists have embraced VR via “Fortnite,” a streaming- and cosplay-friendly game where avatars gather en masse on a magical island.</p>
<p>The agency said its most popular tourist attractions would be recreated in the virtual space on a platform it plans to launch, starting in 2023.</p>
<a>Journal of Virtual Worlds Research</a>. “The key factor is having global standards that would facilitate this.”
<p>“We hope to be able to buy a virtual shirt in world A and take the shirt to world B,” he explained.</p>
<p>Because the metaverse frequently involves physical activity — whether you’re chasing aliens or taking a yoga class — it also provides real-world benefits, said Catherine Allen, who runs the company <a>Limina Immersive</a>.</p>
<p>“It takes away the risk of certain activities and you can push yourself out of your comfort zone,” she said.</p>
<p>Digital fashion is also hot, as luxury brands scramble to meet the demand for jazzing up avatars by creating virtual dresses you’ll never actually wear and shoes you can’t put on your real-life feet. And no demographic is being ignored.</p>
<p>Ralph Lauren is hawking beanies and down jackets for the grade-school set on Roblox, the cartoon-like game with 150 million participants and a $38 billion valuation.</p>
<a>ridiculously expensive</a> Birkin bag, has entered the metaverse. On Dec. 17,
<p>Real estate agencies are going as far as acquiring — and selling — virtual land. </p>
<a>Decentraland</a>, an online environment where users can exchange cryptocurrencies for 90,000 parcels of land, has exploded in popularity of late. In November, Tokens.com
<p>Doctors are also taking full advantage of the emerging technology.</p>
<p>Surgical residents at UConn Health are donning Oculus headsets and practicing procedures via VR, placing pins in virtual broken bones and learning from mistakes before they actually perform any operations.</p>
<p>“It’s like having a GPS navigator in front of your eyes,” said Dr. Timothy Witham, director of the Johns Hopkins Neurosurgery Spinal Fusion Laboratory.</p>
<p>Plastic surgery will also be less of a guessing game, Subin said.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for companies creating the metaverse is figuring out how to engage all five senses.</p>
<a>Hyo Kang</a>, a professor of digital arts and sciences at the University of Florida. “And there are a limited number of devices/tools that support simulating smells and tastes.”
<p>The metaverse faces some real-world challenges, too.</p>
<p>Another potential problem is the wear and tear on users who spend countless hours roaming the metaverse.</p>
<p>Whirling around your house while wearing a headset poses an actual threat, she said, because you can crash into walls or furniture. “A man in Russia died by being impaled by a glass coffee table,” said Allen of Limina Immersive.</p>
<p>Most people involved in the metaverse are optimistic about what’s coming next — and hope for a rapid development of its technology. But they also recognize that not every promising application is right around the corner.</p>
<p>“In building the metaverse, we may be facing the most exciting and difficult technical challenge in history,” Cozzi of Cesium said.</p>
<p>“In some ways, the metaverse is already here, but some achievements are on a 10-year horizon, and other advancements may be 50 years away.”</p>
<p>“If you’re asking when we’ll all be running around like Neo in the Matrix,” she said, “I think we’re looking a bit further out than 2030.”</p>

<h1> Feds signal crackdown on cryptocurrency after volatile week</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> May 21, 2021 8:05am <div> Updated <div> May 21, 2021 3:45pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department are turning up the heat on cryptocurrency, signaling a crackdown could be coming after several days of volatility in the sector.</p>
<p>Fed chair Jerome Powell said in a rare video message posted Thursday that cryptocurrencies, which have grown to have a market cap of nearly $2 trillion, pose some risks to both individual investors and the broader financial system. </p>
<p>He also distinguished between volatile cryptocurrencies and so-called stablecoins, which are tied to the value of other currencies such as the US Dollar.</p>
<p>“As stablecoin’s use increases, so must our attention to the appropriate regulatory and oversight framework,” Powell said, noting that businesses that process crypto payments could be a point of more regulation. </p>
<p>He said the Fed will publish a discussion paper this summer on the benefits and risks of establishing a CBDC, and will seek public comment.</p>
<p>“We think it is important that any potential CBDC could serve as a complement to, and not a replacement of, cash and current private-sector digital forms of the dollar, such as deposits at commercial banks,” Powell added.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department, meanwhile, said it’s taking steps now to regulate the crypto world. It announced Thursday that it will require any transfer worth $10,000 or more to be reported to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>The regulatory attention comes after weeks of speculation that the Biden administration was preparing action on the crypto market, which has ballooned in popularity and value in recent months. </p>

<p>The Art Deco building at 45 W. 81st St., whose rooms overlook the American Museum of Natural History, was unloaded by its longtime family owner to John Young’s Emmut Properties, according to industry sources.</p>
<p>Boasting sun-drenched rooms with sweeping views of Midtown, the Excelsior was also a popular tourist haunt on Thanksgiving, as its rooms offered prime views of the inflating of balloons for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p>
<a>wrote in a Daily News op-ed last month</a>. “This bill is forcing us to make the financial decision to sell our properties rather than lose more and more money every day waiting for tourists to come back so we can reopen.”
<p>Contacted by The Post on Tuesday, Krakowski asked to be called back “in a couple of hours.”</p>
<p>Messages left for the buyer and brokerage were not returned by press time.</p>
<p>That, in turn, resulted in “some ownership groups being forced to take very hard financial decisions including sales and conversions to alternative use,” he noted.</p>
<h1> Airbnb CEO: ‘Travel will never, ever go back to the way it was’</h1>
<div> June 29, 2020 3:28pm <div> Updated <div> June 29, 2020 5:15pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Flights are out. Road trips are in.</p>
<p>Brian Chesky, co-founder and CEO of Airbnb, predicts that the coronavirus pandemic will permanently alter the way we travel, increasing the preference for driving at the expense of airlines.</p>
<a>Axios</a> in a Zoom interview from his San Francisco home. “There are sometimes months when decades of transformation happen.”
<p>The industry is undergoing even bigger change than it experienced during 2008’s Great Recession, he says. As a result, he sees the present and future of travel being more local and less plane-based.</p>
<a>decimated</a> by the coronavirus. While air travel will eventually recover, Chesky predicts, the localization of vacation preferences will not.
<p>“People will, one day, get back on planes,” he says. “But one of the things that I do think is a fairly permanent shift is … a redistribution of where travelers go.”</p>
<p>Mass tourism cites such as Rome, Paris and London will have less appeal to weary pandemic survivors, while national parks and small, nearby communities will become <a>increasingly popular destinations</a>.</p>
<p>“I think that’s going to get smaller as a percentage of travel in the future, and I think it’s going to get somewhat displaced, or at least balanced, by people visiting smaller communities,” Chesky says.</p>
<p>As well, when people travel, it is now much more likely to be for pleasure and not for business.</p>
<p>“I think a lot of people are going to realize they don’t need to get on an airplane to have a meeting. I mean, I met you in an office, but now we’re on Zoom,” Chesky concludes.</p>

<h1> Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky tongue-tied as IPO leaves him $6.5 billion richer</h1>

<p>Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky was at a loss for words when his company went public Thursday — but he wasn’t at a loss for wealth.</p>
<p>The massive initial public offering drove the 39-year-old’s net worth up to about $11 billion, giving him a larger fortune than record executive David Geffen and hedge-fund tycoon Steve Cohen, the ranking shows.</p>
<p>Chesky appeared speechless on Thursday when a TV interviewer told him Airbnb’s share price was set to open at more than double the listing price of $68.</p>
<p>Chesky noted that Airbnb’s shares would have been priced at just about $30 apiece when it secured a debt financing in April as the coronavirus crisis hammered its business.</p>
<p>Chesky co-founded the company in 2008 with his former roommate, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, who each own smaller stakes giving them fortunes of about $9.8 billion, according to the <a>Billionaires Index</a>.</p>
<p>Airbnb’s highly anticipated IPO gave the company a market value of $86 billion — outpacing established rival Booking Holdings. The Priceline.com owner had a market cap of roughly $85 billion as of Friday morning.</p>
