<h1> Five Insights on Gratitude </h1>
<h2> New research explores the complex relationship between gratitude and health. </h2>

<p>Every so often, psychologists attempt to condense the current state of knowledge in a given research area into a single review paper.</p>
<a>gratitude</a> and human health.
<a>attention</a> over the past decades," state Jans-Beken and her team. "With this updated review, we aimed to summarize the current research regarding state and trait gratitude associated with human health."
<p>Analyzing over 50 studies across multiple domains of research, the scientists came to five key conclusions regarding the relationship between gratitude and health. </p>
<p>Conclusion #1: Gratitude facilitates social well-being.</p>
<a>study</a>, for instance, found that keeping a gratitude diary increased grade students' sense of belonging. Moreover,
<a>studies</a> conducted by the psychologists Adam Grant and Francesca Gino found that expressions of gratitude by managers motivated their employees to be more productive in their daily work.
<p>Conclusion #2: Gratitude is associated with higher levels of emotional well-being.</p>
<a>happiness</a>, life satisfaction, and flourishing. Studies have shown a positive association between expressions of gratitude and emotional well-being. One
<a>study</a>, for instance, found that a gratitude intervention improved happiness in a sample of adult women (but not as much as a
<a>mindfulness</a> intervention). Another study
<a>found</a> that the "Three Good Things" intervention — an intervention in which people write down three things that went well for them at the end of each day ⁠— increased flourishing in a sample of elderly adults.
<p>Conclusion #3: Grateful people are less likely to exhibit psychopathologies.</p>
<a>Research</a> by Salces-Cubero found that a gratitude intervention was successful in reducing negative affect and increasing psychological
<a>resilience</a> in a sample of older adults. Other
<a>studies</a> have found beneficial effects of gratitude interventions at the three-month follow-up mark, suggesting that gratitude interventions can have long-lasting positive effects.
<p>Conclusion #4: Not all gratitude interventions are successful.</p>
<a>study</a> found that gratitude journaling increased "meaningfulness" and academic engagement in a sample of college undergraduates. Another
<a>study</a>, however, found no benefit of a gratitude intervention on academic engagement compared to other interventions. Furthermore, it is unclear whether gratitude interventions can reliably reduce
<p>Conclusion #5: Gratitude may have modest beneficial effects on physical health and bodily functions.</p>
<a>study</a> found that keeping a gratitude journal did not improve heart rate or systolic blood pressure, but did improve diastolic blood pressure. Another
<a>study</a> showed no effect of a gratitude intervention on pain among people with chronic back issues. A 2011
<a>study</a> found that focusing on things to be grateful about before bed each night increased pre-sleep calmness, but no more than other exercises such as distraction exercises.

<h1> How Many Ways Can We Measure Well-Being? </h1>
<h2> Reconsidering how we think about the subject. </h2>
<p> Posted October 12, 2017 </p>
<a>devoted to the study of well-being and personality strengths</a>. And when you research these positive psychology topics,
<a>In 2016, three scientists reviewed the usefulness of 99 approaches to assess well-being.</a> Ninety-nine! In the list were measures of overall quality of life, serenity,
<a>spiritual</a> concerns, emotional balance, autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth initiative, positive relations with others, purpose in life, self-acceptance,
<a>self-esteem</a>, occupational well-being, physical well-being, economic well-being, and so on. Exhausting to read. More importantly, it led my colleagues and I to think—how many dimensions of well-being are there?
<a>The latest sensation</a> in well-being theories is PERMA. Dr.
<a>I am still trying to figure that out for myself</a>.) The value of this five-dimensional model is clarified in
<a>a journal article</a> authored by Martin Seligman and his graduate students:
<p>Just as we do not have a single indicator telling us how our car is performing (instead, we have an odometer, a speedometer, a gas gauge, etc.), we suggest that we do not want just one indicator of how well people are doing</p>
<a>are being used</a> to evaluate business organizations and entire schools and universities. If PERMA is being used as a determination of whether a program works, then the measure should be on solid footing.
<a>model of well-being</a> created in 1984 by Dr. Ed Diener. A model
<a>described</a> succinctly as three parts (frequent positive emotions, infrequent negative emotions, and a mental evaluation that life is generally satisfying):
<a>Longo et al., 2016</a>) that suggests well-being is best conceptualized as one single factor consisting of unique facets rather than the presence of unique types of well-being.

<a>24 strengths</a>—such as curiosity,
<a>stress</a> test their models to see if what already exists suffices and if new contributions will offer added value. This is the beauty of science. Ask good questions. Test them. Iterate as often as needed. But this is my scientific lens.
<p>A well-being framework can be useful to trigger conversation without being practical from a strict measurement perspective. This raises some interesting questions that might be outside the province of scientific testing.</p>
<p>Let us separate the scientific contribution from the psychological value of thinking about oneself through the prism of positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. </p>
<p>My hope is that we retain a healthy level of skepticism, constantly asking questions, testing them, and over time, gaining a better handle of the complexity of the human condition.</p>

<h1> What Are the Building Blocks of a Good Life? </h1>
<h2> These 5 elements can change your life for the better. </h2>
<a>bipolar</a> illness, patients may experience excessive happiness. The diagnostic criterion of
<a>mania</a> includes a persistently elevated or expansive mood and inflated
<a>self-esteem</a>. This is a bad thing. It has negative consequences like irresponsible spending or reckless
<a>attention</a> until recently. In 1998,
<a>Martin Seligman</a> was the President of the
<a>American Psychological Association. </a>He had a successful
<a>depression</a> and was known for his work on the theory of “
<a>learned helplessness</a>” as a model for depression. Yet the singular
<a>focus on illness</a> troubled him:
<p>Seligman set out to change that. He broke new ground by <a>founding</a> the modern field of <a>Positive Psychology.</a></p>
<p>Positive psychology has flourished over the past two decades, leading to a greater understanding of optimal human functioning and <a>resilience</a>.</p>
<a>Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being,</a> outlines his groundbreaking theory of well-being known as the PERMA model. The theory holds that the following five elements are the building blocks of a good life:
<p>1. Positive Emotion (P) </p>
<p>Positive emotions such as peace, <a>gratitude</a>, satisfaction, pleasure, inspiration, hope, curiosity, awe, and love are life-enhancing. A “dose” of positive emotion creates an upward spiral of positivity.</p>
<p>When we’re truly engaged in a situation, task, or project, we experience a state of flow: time seems to stop, we lose our sense of self, and we concentrate intensely on the present.</p>
<p>3. Positive Relationships (R) </p>
<p>We are “social beings,” and good relationships are essential for wellbeing. Strong social connections are linked with good physical and mental health and are also protective against stressors.</p>
<p>Meaning comes from serving something larger than ourselves. It puts life in perspective. It may be a religion, a cause, or an overriding sense of purpose that we belong to something bigger.</p>
<p>5. Accomplishment/Achievement (A) </p>
<p>Mastering a skill, achieving one’s goal, and living life in concert with one’s values is important for well-being. Working towards a goal is rewarding in itself.</p>
<p>The good news is that all five elements of PERMA can be cultivated.</p>
<p>Your assignment: get more PERMA in your life today.</p>

<h1> Humanistic and Positive Psychology </h1>
<h2> Is it time to build bridges between humanistic and positive psychology? </h2>
<li>Humanistic psychology developed to address how psychoanalysis and behaviourism did not consider the full range of human functioning.</li>
<li>Abraham Maslow used the term positive psychology to call for greater attention to both positive and negative aspects of human experience.</li>
<li>It is time for humanistic and positive psychology to come together to share ideas and methods.</li>
<p>Positive psychology has been successful in drawing attention to the fact that psychologists had overlooked what makes life worth living.</p>
<h3>The origins of humanistic psychology</h3>
<a>psychoanalysis</a> and behaviourism had not been concerned with the full range of functioning. As Sutich and Vich (1969), editors of the influential, Readings in Humanistic Psychology, wrote:
<p>Likewise, John Shlien, a Harvard psychologist and one of the early pioneers of person-centered psychology, originally writing in 1956, said:</p>
<h3>First references to "positive psychology"</h3>
<p>Maslow seems to be the first to use the term positive psychology. Maslow wanted to create a psychology that was based not only on those who were dysfunctional but also upon those who were fully living the extent of their human potential.</p>
<p>Now that positive psychology has become established, it is time for humanistic and positive psychology to come together to share ideas, methods and to learn from each other.</p>
<p>In my forthcoming book, I explore some of these issues in relation to person-centered <a>psychotherapy</a>.</p>

<li>Most people are <a>resilient</a>.</li>
<li>Happiness, strengths of character, and good social relationships are buffers against the damaging effects of disappointments and setbacks.</li>
<li>Crisis reveals character.</li>
<li>Other people matter mightily if we want to understand what makes life most worth living.</li>
<li>Work matters, as well, if it engages the worker and provides meaning and purpose.</li>
<li>Money makes an ever-diminishing contribution to well-being, but money can buy happiness if it is spent on other people.</li>
<li>As a route to a satisfying life, eudaimonia trumps hedonism.</li>
<li>The "heart" matters more than the "head." Schools explicitly teach critical thinking; they should also teach unconditional caring.</li>
<li>Good days have common features: feeling autonomous, competent, and connected to others.</li>

<h1> Actions Speak Louder Than Words In Therapy, Too </h1>
<h2> Why your "head" and your "heart" will follow your "feet." </h2>
<li>Behavior change is a core component of successful therapy.</li>
<li>Shifts in attitudes and beliefs can follow changes to behavior.</li>

<p>This is because, as we are often told, actions speak louder than words. And when it comes to changing zones of our psychological experience, nothing has the power of corrective action except, in some cases, <a>medication</a>. </p>

<h3>How Cognitive Dissonance Leads to Behavior Change</h3>
<a>cognitive dissonance</a>; the mental discomfort experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values.
<p>Fundamentally, there are two ways a person can reduce cognitive dissonance. One is to change or discard one of the opposing beliefs. The other is to make or keep one’s behavior consistent with one or the other belief.</p>

<h1> How to Stop Procrastinating </h1>
<h2> The vividness of your mental imagery can influence your decisions. </h2>
<p>Life is full of possible distractions. You are probably reading this while knowing you should be doing something else—your day job, your tax return, maybe your child's homework. But you are wasting time on the internet instead.</p>
<p>Anyone who is offering a silver bullet to beat procrastination is <a>lying</a>, because there is no such silver bullet. But there is one very useful shortcut in these situations, which has a fair amount of empirical support. </p>
<a>Experiments</a> in the “construal level theory” paradigm show that when we choose between two options, the vividness of these two options is the most important predictor of how we decide. If a smoker is deciding between
<a>smoking</a> a cigarette and not smoking one, the smoking option brings up very vivid and detailed (and emotionally charged)
<a>mental imagery</a>. Meanwhile, the non-smoking option doesn’t bring up any mental imagery at all—or if it does, it is not at all detailed and not at all vivid (of just sitting there, not smoking).

<h1> Still Smoking? These Strategies Can Help You Quit </h1>
<h2> Use anchors, tapping, and visual cues to stop quickly and easily. </h2>
<li>Approximately 34 million people still smoke in the US, despite the health risks and astronomical cost.</li>
<li>Proven psychological techniques can make quitting smoking easier. Your mind and body will respond to visual, verbal, and taste anchors you set. </li>
<li>You can motivate yourself to quit smoking by spending the money you saved on a special reward at the end of the process. </li>

<a>advertising</a>, putting warning labels on packs, observing cancer deaths in other smokers we know, and taxing the per-pack price to astronomical levels, many people (who probably started young) still can’t quit without help.
<a>shame</a> or get shamed by people who see them smoking in public. Many want to quit but have tried and failed, repeatedly.
<a>peer pressure</a>, to keep your weight down, or as a stress reliever — look around you. Are your peers still smoking? Probably not. Is your weight lower than when you started smoking? Probably not. Is your life any less
<a>stressful</a> because of your daily cigarette habit? Probably not.
<h3>The power of positive self-talk</h3>
<a>self-talk</a> matters when it comes to breaking long-standing habits, especially those that are chemically driven, like cigarettes,
<h3>What to expect after you quit smoking</h3>
<a>sleeplessness</a> — will all be temporary physical conditions. These too shall pass, in a shorter time than you first believe.
<h3>The importance of anchors</h3>
<a>childhood</a> experience? Ever eat food that reminds you of your grandmother’s kitchen or a favorite family trip? These anchors are memorable. When used properly, can create a new set of
<a>neural</a> pathways to help you become a former smoker.
<h3>Recommended tools to help you quit smoking</h3>
<p>Here are some anchors and tools to help you stop smoking when you ready to make that life-saving, life-improving step: </p>
<li>Now ask yourself, who do you want to quit smoking for? This could include your spouse or partner, co-workers, children or grandchildren, or even as a way to win a bet with a friend who challenges you to quit and believes you won’t.</li>
<a>confidence</a> that you are on the right path to becoming and staying a former smoker.
<li>Use nicotine gum and lozenges if you need them temporarily, but don’t substitute a <a>vape</a> pen for your cigarettes. The oral habit and the ability to blow smoke (water vapor) can lead you back to cigarettes.</li>

<div> <div> <div> <h3> <a>David Kyle Johnson Ph.D.</a> </h3> <div> <a>A Logical Take</a> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h1> The Logic of the COVID “Lab Leak" Hypothesis </h1>
<h2> Discovered in Wuhan with lab workers hospitalized. Is this a smoking gun? </h2>
<li>The lab leak hypothesis doesn’t suggest that the virus was intentionally engineered for public release.</li>
<li>But it is not surprising that a naturally occurring coronavirus emerged near a lab that studies them. </li>
<li>It doesn't help that China doesn't have the best track record when it comes to being open and forthcoming.</li>
<a>tweeted</a> that his estimation of the “lab leak” hypothesis jumped from 40 percent to 60 percent, meaning that he now thinks it is more likely than not.
<p>But is that really reasonable? Let’s look at the logic of the argument and relevant evidence.</p>
<p>The scientific evidence against the lab leak hypothesis. </p>
<a>leaked to the outside world. </a>
<p>But the evidence against the lab leak hypothesis is pretty strong.</p>
<a>it would take 50 years for RaTG13 to naturally mutate into SARS-CoV-2</a>. Since RaTG13 was only
<a>first discovered in 2013</a>, obviously it cannot be the "parent" of SARS-CoV-2.
<a>lying</a> about what viruses they were studying, and that the first identified outbreak of COVID happened close to the WIV makes some think that they must be. “Isn’t that just too much of a coincidence?” Not really, it turns out.
<a>horseshoe bats</a> that harbor SARS-type viruses live near there, and SARS-CoV-1 reached humans by crossing over from those bats through other animals:
<a>Himalayan palm civets and raccoon dogs</a>.) Thinking “the WIV must have caused the outbreak” is like thinking a scientific outpost studying the melting ice caps is what is causing them to melt.
<p>Third, there is reason to think that this is exactly what happened. We now know that</p>
<li>The December 2019 meat market outbreak was just the tip of the iceberg, with <a>more than 1000 cases</a> throughout the city alongside the (initially reported) 174 severe cases linked to market.</li>
<li>There were already <a>multiple (13) variants</a> in Wuhan by December 2019 (meaning that the virus was circulating at least as early as October 2019).</li>
<li>Someone was infected with COVID elsewhere in (<a>rural</a>) Hubei province as far back as <a>November 17, 2019</a>. </li>
<p>Not only do we now know that the Wuhan wet market was not the crossover event, we know SARS-CoV-2 was circulating outside Wuhan before it was finally identified there by the WIV. This makes the Wuhan lab leak theory much less likely. </p>
<p>Hospitalized lab workers </p>
<p>What about those three WIV lab workers who went to the hospital in November 2019? At least three things are relevant here. </p>
<a>intelligence</a> expressed a range of views about the strength of the report's supporting evidence, with one unnamed person saying it needed '
<a>further investigation and additional corroboration</a>'." It’s not even clear if the hospitalizations happened. (It contradicts other reporting that said all the WIV workers
<a>tested negative</a> for COVID antibodies.)
<li>The report doesn’t even say what they went to the hospital for. If they weren’t all there for COVID-like symptoms, this evidence is irrelevant.</li>
<li>We’d also need to know: three out of how many workers? How unlikely would it be, at any given time, during that time of the year, for three WIV workers to be in the hospital? Is this an aberration, or a common occurrence?</li>
