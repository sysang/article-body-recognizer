<p>A group of Republican Maryland legislators and voters is suing the state over the allegedly partisan <a>congressional</a> redistricting plan Democrats in the <a>state legislature</a> passed following the 2020 Census. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, backed by the outside group Fair Maps Maryland, was filed Thursday morning in state court. It argues that the congressional map passed by Democrats is gerrymandered in violation of the Maryland constitution. </p>
<p>The term "cracking" used in redistricting means splitting up a certain bloc of similar voters to water down their electoral power and prevent that political group from being able to elect a representative. </p>

<h1>Rep. Byron Donalds details his first year in Congress and how 'crazy' 2021 was</h1>
<h2>The Republican says his New Year's Resolution on Capitol Hill is 'do no harm' to the country</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Rep. Byron Donalds on his first year in Congress and how 'crazy' 2021 was</a></h4> <p>Florida lawmaker lays out the three issues Republicans should run on in 2022.</p></div></div>
<p>Rep. <a>Byron Donalds</a>, R-Fla. sat down with Fox News Digital to discuss his first year in <a>Congress</a> and what fellow Republicans should aim for ahead of the 2022 midterms. </p>
<p><a><u>REP. BYRON DONALDS CALLS MANCHIN KILLING BUILD BACK BETTER ‘GREAT NEWS FOR THE COUNTRY': THAT BILL WAS ‘TRASH’</u></a></p>
<p>"The members see each other on the floor, but other than that you don't really see the other members of Congress," Donalds said, adding that there's "very little communication across the aisle."</p>
<div> <div><p> Photographer: Dylan Hollingsworth/Bloomberg via Getty Images (Dylan Hollingsworth/Bloomberg via Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>Donalds, who was speaking at Turning Point USA's AmericaFest in Phoenix told Fox News his New Year's Resolution in Congress is "do no harm," comparing it to doctors taking the Hippocratic Oath.</p>
<p>The lawmaker blamed the American Rescue Plan for the ongoing labor shortages and that extending unemployment and child tax credits, insisting it did not need to get passed since there was still unspent CARES Act money from the Trump administration. </p>

<p>Looking ahead to the 2022 midterms, the Florida representative told Fox News the three issues Republicans should run on in order to retake the House and Senate are securing the border, fiscal responsibility and deregulation. </p>
<p>And to summarize 2021, he chuckled and called it a "crazy, crazy year."</p>

<p><a>WILL THE JAN. 6 COMMITTEE SUBPOENA A SITTING MEMBER OF CONGRESS?</a></p>
<p>Jordan wasn’t as recalcitrant as Perry.</p>
<p>During an appearance on Fox, Jordan said he had "real concerns" with the committee, arguing it altered documents. Jordan said he would "review" the request from the committee for his communications.</p>
<p>In October, Jordan told the House Rules Committee that he "had nothing to hide" regarding any investigation into the melee.</p>
<a>Trump</a>. The committee has questions about alleged efforts to coordinate a delay in the certification of the
<a>Electoral College</a> on January 6. The committee wants to know what Perry and Jordan may have known ahead of the riot. The committee is also interested in communications between Jordan and Mr. Trump on the day of the riot.
<p>Here’s the problem for the committee:</p>
<a>White House</a> Advisor Steve Bannon said he wouldn’t cooperate with a subpoena issued by the panel. The House moved quickly told hold Bannon in contempt of
<a>Congress</a> – sending the citation to the
<a>Justice Department</a> for potential criminal prosecution. Five days later, the DoJ announced it would prosecute Bannon. His trial comes next July.
<p>STATE LEGISLATORS, VOTERS SUE MARYLAND OVER ALLEGEDLY GERRYMANDERED CONGRESSIONAL MAP HELPING DEMOCRATS</p>
<p>This is background to underscore the conundrum facing the 1/6 committee and the House if Perry and Jordan are unmovable.</p>
<p>Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states that lawmakers are "privileged from Arrest" during the execution of their official duties and "that shall not be questioned in any other Place."</p>

<p>A spokesman for the 1/6 committee said the panel would "consider using other tools" to get compliance. But there’s no legal or historical precedent to subpoena and enforce a subpoena of a sitting Member.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the House would go this route if Perry and Jordan hold out. But it could be an option.</p>
<p>It’s different with Perry, Jordan and perhaps others.</p>
<p>And we can’t predict the future for this one – because there’s not a lot of past to go on.</p>

<p>The Jan. 6 committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News. JPMorgan Chase declined to comment.</p>
<p>Republicans argue the committee is more of a political witch hunt than a serious investigation, particularly after Pelosi refused to seat picks from Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on the committee. </p>

<h1>Texas lawmaker says Dem voting rights bill an assault on democracy: We're 'tired of the swamp games'</h1>
<h2>VP Harris said US will be 'off the map as a role model' if Republicans sink voting rights bill</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Rep. Chip Roy says Democrats moving toward a federal takeover of US elections</a></h4> <p>Texas Congressman says Americans are waking up to Democratic 'swap games' on 'Fox News Primetime.'</p></div></div>
<p>Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas chastised the <a>White House's</a> efforts to advance the <a>Democrats</a>' sweeping voting rights legislation on Monday, calling it an "assault" on the U.S. election system and a "threat" to democracy at large.</p>
<p>"The American people are tired of the swamp games and Democrats are starting to show exactly how they feel about our democracy," Roy told <a>"Fox News Primetime"</a> Monday evening.</p>
<a>assertion </a>during a wide-ranging interview with CBS' "Face the Nation," that America would
<a>lose its "role model" status</a> if
<a><u>Congress</u></a> fails to pass voting rights legislation in the new year. After their efforts to pass an elections bill were stymied by
<a><u>Republicans</u></a> in 2021, Democrats are reportedly
<a>gearing up for a frontal assault</a> on the legislative filibuster to push the legislation past the finish line.
<p><a>HARRIS SAYS US WILL BE ‘OFF THE MAP’ AS A ROLE MODEL IF VOTING RIGHTS LEGISLATION SINKS</a></p>
<p>Roy chastised Harris for spearheading the election overhaul legislation, arguing that she and <a>President Biden</a> have waged war with "the rule of law."</p>

<p>"The elections are the very things the American people are going to seek to use next year and they know it they want to do everything they can to try to stop the American people for standing up in defense of this great country," Roy said.</p>
<p><a>KAMALA HARRIS CITES 'NOT GETTING OUT OF DC MORE' AS HER 'BIGGEST FAILURE' AS VP</a></p>
<p>"The small businesses, the local communities, the people out here in real America who are actually fighting to save their country. Democrats want to stand as roadblocks in that."</p>
<p>Harris said on Sunday that while most Americans likely don't see voting rights as an "urgent" matter, the more the administration spotlights it, the more people will realize that some are "suppressing the right of the American people to vote."</p>
<p>Roy called her motivations "a lie."</p>

<h1>Pelosi defends lawmakers trading stocks despite media exposé of conflicts</h1>
<p><a>Nancy Pelosi</a> simply tried to wave away any suggestion of conflicts of interest.</p>
<p>A journalist at her weekly briefing asked about a bombshell report in Business Insider that 49 members of <a>Congress</a> have violated federal law with their prodigious stock trading. Not to mention 182 senior Hill aides.</p>
<p><a>BIDEN URGED TO BOW OUT WHILE DEMOCRATS SEEK ALTERNATIVE FOR 2024</a></p>
<p>Should this sort of thing be allowed?</p>
<p>Sure, said the House speaker. "Because this is a free market," and "a free-market economy, they should be able to participate in that."</p>
<div> <div><p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., meets with reporters at the Capitol in Washington. (Associated Press)</p></div></div>
<p>That is such an inadequate answer on so many levels. In fact, CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin called it "one of the most disappointing," and "disgraceful" comments he’s heard on the issue.</p>
<p>"What a disgusting comment," former government ethics chief Walter Shaub told Fox News. "This is the opposite of government ethics."</p>
<p>Yet the brief exchange was all but lost, drowned out by all the Jan. 6 investigation news and other stories.</p>
<div> <div><p> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., conducts a news conference on Capitol Hill. (Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>Business Insider ran an <a>exposé</a>, prompting the question to the speaker, saying that 49 members of Congress – along with 182 senior Hill aides – violated a federal conflict-of-interest law. This, by the way, has been a bipartisan practice.</p>
<p>Among the findings: Almost 75 lawmakers holding stocks in Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson Johnson, which make the <a>Covid</a> vaccines, were trading those stocks in the early weeks of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Another 15 lawmakers overseeing defense policy actively invest in <a>military</a> contractors.</p>
<p>And some members who rip "the media" invest in such companies as the New York Times, Disney, Comcast, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
<p>The list goes on, from tobacco to <a>Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p><a><u>PANDEMIC FATIGUE DEFIES VIRUS DEATHS FOR THOSE ACHING FOR NORMALCY</u></a></p>
<p>This undermines faith in government. I don’t see why any member of Congress should be allowed to trade individual stocks, as opposed to diversified mutual funds.</p>
<p>At least one prominent <a>Democrat</a> agrees. <a>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez </a>tweeted that it’s "absolutely ludicrous" for members to be able to own and trade stocks "with the info we have."</p>
<div> <div><p> U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. </p></div></div>
<p>Now insider trading is a hard rap to prove, requiring evidence that the person traded on non-public information and intended to break the law.</p>
<p><a><u>SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES</u></a></p>
<p>"We have a responsibility to report," Pelosi said at the presser. "If people aren’t reporting, they should be."</p>
<p>But the 45-day delay obviously doesn’t allow for real-time media scrutiny – and violators, when they’re caught, may pay minimal fines.</p>
<p>The only recent prosecution came in 2019, when then-<a>Republican</a> U.S. Rep. Chris Collins pleaded guilty to notifying his son about confidential information he’d obtained about a drug company’s failed trial, causing the stock to plummet.</p>
<p>I’m surprised Pelosi, whose husband owns millions in stocks, was so dismissive of a situation that reeks of unfairness.</p>

<p>It’s almost like a three-ring circus, a series of headline-grabbing trials that have grabbed public attention.</p>
<p>One involves sexual abuse. Another centers on alleged medical fraud, and also <a>sex</a>. And a third focuses on what’s alleged to be a racially charged hoax.</p>
<a>Kyle Rittenhouse</a>, because his case had cameras in the courtroom. And nothing drives public interest — and television segments — like being able to see a defendant breaking down or subjected to fierce cross-examination.

<p>Sunny Balwani, who was also a top Theranos executive, wanted to "<a>kill the person</a>" she was:</p>
<p>"He impacted everything about who I was. And I don’t fully understand that."</p>
<p><a>DEMOCRATS WANT BIDEN TO CHANGE HIS STYLE, BUT THAT’S NOT HAPPENING</a></p>
<p>Her boyfriend, who was about 20 years older, told her that eating only certain foods would make her "pure," that she shouldn’t sleep much and maintain a "very disciplined and intense lifestyle," according to a Washington Post account.</p>
<p>"When she failed to live up to his expectations, Holmes said, Balwani would yell at her and sometimes force her to have sex with him when she didn’t want to."</p>
<p>Sorry, but didn’t she have free will? Holmes was the founder and CEO. Whether he influenced her or not, isn’t she responsible for claiming non-existent medical breakthroughs and misleading investors?</p>
<a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who sexually abused young girls, and charges that Maxwell, his partner and onetime girlfriend, recruited them. With Epstein, who once hobnobbed with such people as Bill Clinton,
<a>Donald Trump</a> and Prince Andrew, having killed himself in prison, Maxwell is the only remaining target for justice to be done.
<p>They were "partners in crime," a federal prosecutor said, and Maxwell got the girls to trust her and then "served them up."</p>
<p>But Maxwell’s lawyer told the jury that her client is being used as a "scapegoat": "Ever since Eve was tempting Adam with the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behavior of men."</p>

<p>It will be up to a jury to determine whether Maxwell’s conduct rises to the level of a criminal offense. But there is plenty of evidence she was Epstein’s enabler. </p>
<p>Finally, <a>Jussie Smollett</a> is on trial? The disorderly conduct charges seem like overkill, three years after the onetime "Empire" star was involved in a hoax that riveted the nation’s attention.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: He still refuses to admit it was a hoax. As a result, Smollett faces up to three years in prison.</p>
<p>"They agreed they should bruise him a little bit to make it look good," the special prosecutor said. What’s more, police say the brothers were paid $3,500 to stage the attack.</p>

<p>But Smollett’s lawyer argued — wait for it — that the crime was committed against his client: "Jussie Smollett is a real victim. The brothers did not like him."</p>
<p>It’s unreal how many hours of investigation have been consumed by this overhyped episode that the media initially bought into and trumpeted. Now it will be settled in a courtroom.</p>
<p>I’ve covered many trials in my career. Most are marked by long stretches of boring testimony and droning expert witnesses, sometimes punctuated by a few moments of drama. Without television cameras, they tend to be relegated to the inside pages.</p>
<p>But the verdicts will be big news, if only because each case is notorious in its own way.</p>

<h1>Omicron fuels global worries, political partisanship and media hype</h1>
<h2>There is so much we don’t know about omicron, which has now surfaced in 30 countries</h2>
<h4><a>Will Chris Cuomo be sidelined at CNN for good?</a></h4>
<p>Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz reports on the CNN anchor's suspension from the network 'indefinitely' following revelations of his involvement with brother Andrew Cuomo's sexual harassment probe.</p>
<p>The <a>omicron</a> era has begun, and with it the same political arguments that have grown as tiresome and troubling as the <a>coronavirus</a> itself.</p>
<p><a>Joe Biden</a> isn’t doing enough! Joe Biden is doing too much! The <a>Democrats</a> are just looking for an excuse to lock down the country. The Republicans don’t care about people dying.</p>
<p>And maybe the whole thing is just a hoax!</p>

<p>Plus, <a>Anthony Fauci</a> is an evil guy who wants to give people shots forever. And can we please stop with the Nazi references?</p>
<a>vaccination</a> sites, available boosters for all adults (which should have been done months ago), at-home virus tests covered by insurance and mandatory testing for international travelers.

<p>"It's a plan that I think should unite us," Biden said. "I know Covid-19 has been very divisive in this country, has become a political issue, which is a sad, sad commentary."</p>
<p>And here’s the contrast: <a>Donald Trump</a>, calling in Thursday to <a>"Fox Friends,"</a> said the vaccines work well but "people don’t want to take them because they don’t trust Biden, they don’t trust the administration."</p>
<p>There is so much we don’t know about omicron, which has now surfaced in 30 countries, with several confirmed cases in the U.S. Is it more deadly than the <a>delta variant</a>? Would existing vaccines offer some protection? Would boosters help?</p>

<h1>Why de Blasio’s heavy-handed vaccine mandate probably won’t last</h1>
<h2>The vaccine mandate wouldn’t take effect until Dec. 27 — and he leaves office four days later</h2>
<p><a>Bill de Blasio</a>’s vaccine mandate in <a>New York</a> is nothing less than a grandstanding move by a lame duck and may last only a few days.</p>
<p>One telltale sign: He announced it Monday on MSNBC, which seems to be the primary venue for most of his policy pronouncements. He’s the "Morning Joe" mayor.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that de Blasio, whose presidential campaign utterly fizzled, is now planning to run for New York governor.</p>
<p>But his decision to impose a <a>vaccine</a> mandate on the city’s private businesses wouldn’t take effect until Dec. 27 — and he leaves office four days later.</p>

<p>OMICRON FUELS GLOBAL WORRIES, POLITICAL PARTISANSHIP AND MEDIA HYPE</p>
<p>What’s more, the incoming Democratic mayor, <a>Eric Adams</a>, has already said "we need to revisit" some of de Blasio’s mandates. He was on vacation in Ghana and a statement said he would evaluate the new rule after taking office.</p>

<p>"Omicron is here, and it looks like it’s very transmissible," the mayor said in the television interview. But what experts don’t know is whether it’s more deadly than Covid-19 or the delta variant, or relatively mild.</p>
<p>President Biden’s mandate would cover large <a>businesses</a>, but it has been blocked in court.</p>
<p>Just under 90 percent of New York adults have already gotten at least one shot, so this is as much about headlines as health care.</p>
<p>How exactly would de Blasio enforce this? Hire a new army of vax police? He couldn’t exactly answer that by when asked by Mika Brzezinski, other than to muse about cooperation.</p>
<div> <div><p> New York, New York (iStock) (iStock)</p></div></div>
<p>The city already requires employees and customers at restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>That amounts to undue pressure on parents who may well be vaccinated themselves but are understandably hesitant about having children as young as 5 get the shots.</p>
<p>A New York Times reporter quoted Kathryn Wylde, head of a major city business group, as saying: "We were blindsided. There’s no forewarning, no discussion, no idea about whether it’s legal or who he expects to enforce it."</p>

<h1>It’s Biden’s Washington, but the press can’t get enough of Trump</h1>
<h2>Developments in Trump World keep stealing the spotlight</h2>
<p><a><u>President Biden</u></a> is dealing with a wide array of global problems, from ordering a diplomatic <a><u>boycott</u> </a>of the Beijing Olympics to warning <a><u>Vladimir Putin</u></a> on Tuesday against an invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<a><u>Christmas</u></a>, or ever.
<p>But there are all kinds of developments in this other universe known as <a><u>Trump World</u></a> that keep stealing the spotlight.</p>
<p>We have never had a situation where a former president generated so much news more than a year after being defeated at the polls — which, of course, remains a major point of contention for Trump partisans.</p>

<p>There is a synergy here between Donald’s dogged determination to stay in the news and media outlets — whose audiences love to hate Trump — that pounce on every development.</p>
<p><a><u>WHY DE BLASIO’S HEAVY-HANDED VACCINE MANDATE PROBABLY WON’T LAST</u></a></p>
<p>Trump is newsworthy, of course, because he’s the dominant figure in the <a><u>Republican Party</u></a>, is trying to knock off non-loyalists in the midterms and may well run for his old job in 2024.</p>
<p>But then there’s also the investigative machinery that always seems to shadow Trump, led by the <a><u>Democratic</u></a>-dominated Jan. 6 committee.</p>
<p>On that front alone, the subpoena battles generate a near-constant flow of headlines.</p>
<p>Marc Short, who was Pence’s chief of staff, is cooperating, however, with the Pence World view being very different than that of the Trumpists.</p>
<p>As awful as the Capitol riot was, a battalion of journalists is aggressively pursuing the notion that the former president may well succeed next time.</p>
<div> <div><p> Donald Trump and Joe Biden remain competitors for media attention. (Associated Press)</p></div></div>
<p>"Trump’s Next Coup Has Already Begun," says an Atlantic <a><u>cover story</u></a>.</p>
<p>"The Trump Conspiracy Is Hiding in Plain Sight," <a><u>warns</u></a> New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie.</p>
<p>Meadows, by the way, is out with a book that, we learned via the Times, says Trump’s oxygen dropped to dangerously low levels when he contracted Covid last year. A CNN medical analyst has already proclaimed that Trump was "in danger of dying."</p>

<a><u>deep dive</u></a> on the more than 500 people Trump came into contact with in the week after the initial test. And others say Trump feels betrayed by Meadows (as he did after books by Stephanie Grisham, John Bolton and other former aides).
<p>But wait, there’s still more Trump news! Devin Nunes is resigning his seat in Congress to become CEO of Trump’s new media company and battle online "censorship."</p>

<p>That’s a remarkable move, given that the Trump loyalist is in line to chair the Ways and Means Committee in a Republican House.</p>
<p>But this highlights yet another probe: Federal regulators are looking into the proposed merger between the Trump firm and a shell company that was formed to take it public.</p>
<p>Trump told his ex-spokesman Sean Spicer on Newsmax that the SEC investigation is a "witch hunt" that could lead to "pure communism" in this country. Shades of Bob Mueller.</p>
<p>And keep in mind there’s the ongoing probe of the Trump Organization, which was supposed to spell big trouble for the founder after CFO Allen Weisselberg was charged, but ... hasn’t so far.</p>
