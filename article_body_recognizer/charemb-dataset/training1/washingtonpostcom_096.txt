<div><div><p>Europe’s top human rights court Thursday ruled inadmissible a man’s discrimination claim against a Belfast bakery for declining his pro-gay marriage cake order because of its owners’ religious beliefs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The <a>ruling </a>ended a years-long legal battle that had raised questions about civil rights, religious freedoms and sexual orientation in Northern Ireland, a region of Britain.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The saga also mirrored similar, <a>high-profile cases</a> in the United States where bakeries and other businesses in recent years have refused to cater same-sex weddings.</p></div></div>
<a>ultimately lost</a> the original case and a subsequent appeal. In 2018, however, Britain’s Supreme Court ruled in favor of Ashers, saying that the bakery had not discriminated against Lee because of his sexual orientation.
<a>reported</a>. “Their objection was to the message on the cake, not to the personal characteristics of Mr. Lee.”
<div><div><p>Lee said Thursday that he was disappointed that the case was dismissed on a “technicality.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“None of us should be expected to have to figure out the beliefs of a company’s owners before going into their shop or paying for their services,” he said.</p></div></div>
<a>Irish Times </a>quoted the deputy director of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, a Northern Ireland-based rights group that was a third-party intervener in the case, as saying the ruling was a “missed opportunity” for the ECHR.
<div><p>The court, Daniel Holder said, could have used the decision to “clarify its case law on sexual orientation and discrimination in the private sector, particularly when it is said to relate to the message rather than the customer."</p></div>

<p>JERUSALEM — Israel's fastest-in-the world vaccine campaign, which reached half its citizens as of Sunday, is offering other countries the first real-life look at how mass inoculation can bend the trajectory of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<div><p>Israel’s scientific results have allowed health officials to open the inoculation program to pregnant women and nursing mothers, while the findings also showed that it was safe for those with food allergies and autoimmune diseases.</p></div>
<a>the fastest per capita pace of any country</a>. More than 3.3 million have gotten both shots.
<a>against emerging variants of the virus</a>. And experts are split on what the studies show about how contagious people remain after they are vaccinated, a key issue in slowing the infection’s spread.
<div><div><p>Still, the run of upbeat reports has reassured health officials who watched anxiously as the new vaccines were deployed within months, instead of the years that vaccine development has usually taken.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s science on steroids,” said Eran Segal, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Publication of that study is waiting on journal editors, but other scientific results — and the experience of hospital administrators — have confirmed that fewer elderly people are flooding into the covid wards.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Another major study, conducted jointly by Israel’s Ministry of Health and Pfizer and reported by the Israeli news site Ynet last week, showed a 93 percent plunge in serious covid disease and death among the vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To determine the vaccine’s impact across the population, health experts are parsing Israel’s trove of data by age, gender, location and health histories going back 20 years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Analysts can create virtual control groups so it’s possible to compare hundreds of thousands of vaccinated people with unvaccinated people who share the same profiles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Israel’s rapid vaccine deployment is being closely watched around the world, as other nations grapple with their own uneven rollouts amid growing public frustration over health restrictions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even in Israel itself, vaccination seems to be racing against an increasingly daunting foe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Officials are loosening Israel’s third national lockdown and have launched a “green passport” system that grants the vaccinated special access to concerts, gyms and other once-routine parts of life.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Miriam Berger</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Steve Hendrix</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 30, 2021|Updated December 30, 2021 at 3:57 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>New CDC guidelines were spurred by worries omicron surge could lead to breakdown in essential services</p></div>
<div><p>Israel on Wednesday dropped its mandatory seven-day quarantine for vaccinated people exposed to omicron amid fears that the rate of isolation was leading the country, which has already banned foreign travelers, into a de facto lockdown.</p></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> infections from 10 to seven days alongside two negative results from at-home rapid antigen tests, which are less reliable than PCR tests. A government minister said Wednesday there were no plans to reduce the isolation period further.
<div><div><p>But others have cautioned that there’s much still unknown about when and to what extent an individual with omicron remains contagious.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Public messaging has also centered on the day-to-day implications, with officials warning that hospitals, school systems and many businesses could collapse unless less stringent isolation protocols are implemented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Ontario on Thursday said that most infected people could shorten isolation from 10 to five days if they were fully vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Quebec on Tuesday went further and
<b> </b>changed its rules to allow some medical staff exposed or infected with the virus to continue working, warning that it could otherwise soon have 10,000 health-care workers off the floor and in isolation.
<div><div><p>Authorities in Germany, where individuals who test positive or have a close exposure must quarantine for two weeks, are also weighing changes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Italy recorded nearly 100,000 coronavirus cases Wednesday, about double the peak from any previous wave. The government has banned New Year’s Eve celebrations and shut nightclubs for the next month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A number of people, including children who are in contact with covid-19 positive people, lose their income and valuable school time while staying at home without symptoms,” <a>said a government statement</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>the government said</a>, leading to a policy recall on Tuesday. The government said it would reinstate the old rules as it further deliberated.
<div><p>Healthy, boosted people unlikely to develop severe omicron infections, but jury’s out on older, at-risk populations</p></div>
<div><div><p>The emphasis on needing shorter or no quarantines to keep economies going has opened governments up to criticism that they are crafting policies around their own interests.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Quebec, it was these stark realities that led health authorities to class medical workers differently.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In previous waves, we wanted to identify and remove at-risk employees as quickly as possible,” he added. “With the current level of vaccination, we have to do otherwise. We have no choice.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Israel on Monday began a two-week trial of a <a>fourth vaccine dose</a>, after rolling out booster shots starting this summer.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Israel begins trial of fourth coronavirus vaccine dose ahead of planned national campaign</p></div>
<div><div><p>Some officials, however, have recommended easing travel restrictions, citing that the economically punitive measure cannot stop omicron once it’s there.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The moment infections are spreading, there is no point in stopping entry from abroad,” Heath Minister Nitzan Horowitz said in an interview with Israel’s KAN public broadcasting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But critics say the government should focus on community-level infection controls, rather than policies that appear based on business or political pressures.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Easy-to-take antiviral pills, authorized just before Christmas, were hailed as a potential turning point in the fight against the <a>coronavirus</a> because of the medicines’ ability to keep high-risk people out of the hospital.</p></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<b> </b>supply of the pills, especially Pfizer’s Paxlovid, means
<div><div><p>“Due to the complex chemistry . . .to make the pill, it takes months literally to make a pill, " he said. But he stressed the medication is “already saving lives.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She added that physicians are “always happy for any help we can get, but it’s very hard to get these early therapies into the regular population.”</p></div></div>
<a>Pfizer’s Paxlovid</a> and
<a>Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics’s molnupiravir</a> — as omicron began to overtake delta as the most
<a>prominent variant</a> of the novel coronavirus in many parts of the country. The antiviral pills, alongside the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab, are among the few outpatient treatments shown to be effective against the omicron variant.
<div><p>About <a>65,000 courses of Paxlovid</a>, which reduced hospitalizations and death for high-risk people with covid-19 <a>by nearly 90 percent in clinical trials</a>, have been distributed to states on the basis of a population formula.</p></div>
<a> results from a clinical trial fell short of expectations</a>. Still, the drug reduced hospitalizations and deaths by about 30 percent when given within five days of symptom onset.
<div><div><p>Ralph Rogers, an infectious-disease physician in Rhode Island who specializes in the care of immunocompromised patients, is among the lucky doctors who<b> </b>managed to get access to the new drugs.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>immune systems, have a much higher risk of developing severe covid-19 that could result in hospitalization or death. He said he has prescribed Pfizer’s Paxlovid to several of them.
<div><div><p>But the supply of the pills cannot keep up with demand. When Rogers tried to place an order for Paxlovid on Monday morning, the pharmacies that had been dispensing the drug last week were out of stock.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Sunday urged the federal government to prioritize states that are experiencing sharp increases in coronavirus infections and hospitalizations rather than distributing the pills according to population formulas.
<div><div><p>“Right now, New York will not have enough of these pills to meet the health demand,” Schumer <a>said at a news conference</a>. “The pills should go where the surges are.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Given the limited supply, Rogers said doctors must decide who stands to benefit the most from the pills, which must be given within five days of the onset of symptoms.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’d be great if we could wait and see and if they get worse,” Rogers said, “but the treatment is really most effective when it’s given early.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>State health departments determine where to allocate their share of the<b> </b>pills — with most opting to make the drugs available through select pharmacies by prescription.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Maryland health officials said on Monday that because of shipping delays, they have received only a small portion of their allotment so far.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Stretching out the supply is less of a problem than getting the products on the shelves of pharmacies,” said health department spokesman Andy Owen.</p></div></div>
<a>multistep process</a> of five to six months’ duration to produce the active pharmaceutical ingredient in its pills.
<div><p>The first packs of Paxlovid were shipped from Pfizer’s distribution center in Memphis beginning on Dec. 23, shortly after the FDA authorized the drug. Hundreds of thousands of packs will be shipped in early 2022, Longley said.</p></div>
<div><p>Merck provided hundreds of thousands of molnupiravir courses to the federal government in the last days of 2021, said company spokeswoman Melissa Moody. Production will ramp up to make 1 million courses over the next few weeks, she added.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Public health experts have continued to emphasize that coronavirus vaccines and booster shots remain the most effective way to prevent severe infection and death in most people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The new antiviral pills are not the only<b> </b>prevention and early <a>treatment options</a> for people at a heightened risk of developing severe covid-19, but they are the only therapy that can be taken at home.</p></div></div>
<a>providing</a> about 50,000 courses of AstraZeneca’s monoclonal antibody Evusheld, which was
<a>authorized by the FDA </a>last month for prevention of covid-19 in immunocompromised individuals
<b> </b>who have had bad reactions to vaccines or cannot mount a response from vaccination. Nearly 50,000 units of GlaxoSmithKline’s monoclonal antibody sotrovimab
<a>will be made available</a> to states this week.
<a>still shipping</a> Regeneron and Eli Lilly’s monoclonal antibodies, which are effective against other virus variants. All of those monoclonal antibodies are given intravenously in a hospital setting.
<p>Another option is Remdesivir, which has been used for inpatient treatment and recently has <a>shown promise in preventing hospitalizations</a> if given shortly after symptoms develop, but the drug must be administered in a clinical setting<b>.</b></p>
<a>data tracked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, the delta variant still accounts for more cases in other areas of the country
<div><div><p>She said that she and her colleagues could not yet prescribe the antiviral pills but that she expected doctors to get access to them within days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They can’t come soon enough,” Iovine said. “It’s just a matter of if we can get these drugs out and to people in time, before omicron really takes over the entire country.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<a>Coronavirus</a> cases are spiking across much of the United States, which has seen a 27 percent rise in new cases in the past week,
<a>according to a Washington Post analysis</a>. The seven-day average of cases is 168,981, surpassing the peak of the delta-variant surge in early September. Some states have seen cases soar as the omicron variant has taken hold,
<a>according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>.
<p>Florida’s seven-day average of new daily cases has more than tripled during the past week. According to the CDC, the omicron variant accounted for more than 95 percent of new cases between Dec. 12 and 18 in the region that includes Florida.</p>
<b> </b>the sharpest increase in hospitalizations per capita during the past week, followed by Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Connecticut.
<div><div><p>Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement the new antiviral pill was “a major step forward.”</p></div></div>
<a>newly authorized monoclonal antibody from AstraZeneca</a>, used to prevent infections in people who do not respond to vaccines, may also
<a>remain effective against the omicron variant</a>.
<a>1 million a day</a>, those pills could be used up quickly, even though they are authorized only for people 12 and older who are at high risk of severe covid-19 because of age or underlying medical conditions.
<p>The United States has made an advance purchase of <a>10 million packs of Paxlovid</a> at a cost of about <a>$5.3 billion</a>, along with about 3.1 million treatment courses of the Merck drug, molnupiravir, at a cost of <a>$2.2 billion</a>.</p>

<div><div><p>Madeb said that this week, he requested 900 doses of sotrovimab, the antibody that remains effective against the omicron variant. That would be enough, he said, for nine days.</p></div></div>

<div><p>New CDC guidelines were spurred by worries omicron surge could lead to breakdown in essential services</p></div>
<div><p>Israel on Wednesday dropped its mandatory seven-day quarantine for vaccinated people exposed to omicron amid fears that the rate of isolation was leading the country, which has already banned foreign travelers, into a de facto lockdown.</p></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> infections from 10 to seven days alongside two negative results from at-home rapid antigen tests, which are less reliable than PCR tests. A government minister said Wednesday there were no plans to reduce the isolation period further.
<div><div><p>But others have cautioned that there’s much still unknown about when and to what extent an individual with omicron remains contagious.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Public messaging has also centered on the day-to-day implications, with officials warning that hospitals, school systems and many businesses could collapse unless less stringent isolation protocols are implemented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Ontario on Thursday said that most infected people could shorten isolation from 10 to five days if they were fully vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Quebec on Tuesday went further and
<b> </b>changed its rules to allow some medical staff exposed or infected with the virus to continue working, warning that it could otherwise soon have 10,000 health-care workers off the floor and in isolation.
<div><div><p>Authorities in Germany, where individuals who test positive or have a close exposure must quarantine for two weeks, are also weighing changes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Italy recorded nearly 100,000 coronavirus cases Wednesday, about double the peak from any previous wave. The government has banned New Year’s Eve celebrations and shut nightclubs for the next month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A number of people, including children who are in contact with covid-19 positive people, lose their income and valuable school time while staying at home without symptoms,” <a>said a government statement</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>the government said</a>, leading to a policy recall on Tuesday. The government said it would reinstate the old rules as it further deliberated.
<div><p>Healthy, boosted people unlikely to develop severe omicron infections, but jury’s out on older, at-risk populations</p></div>
<div><div><p>The emphasis on needing shorter or no quarantines to keep economies going has opened governments up to criticism that they are crafting policies around their own interests.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Quebec, it was these stark realities that led health authorities to class medical workers differently.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In previous waves, we wanted to identify and remove at-risk employees as quickly as possible,” he added. “With the current level of vaccination, we have to do otherwise. We have no choice.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Some officials, however, have recommended easing travel restrictions, citing that the economically punitive measure cannot stop omicron once it’s there.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The moment infections are spreading, there is no point in stopping entry from abroad,” Heath Minister Nitzan Horowitz said in an interview with Israel’s KAN public broadcasting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But critics say the government should focus on community-level infection controls, rather than policies that appear based on business or political pressures.</p></div></div>

<div><p>JERUSALEM — A fourth shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine generated a fivefold boost in antibodies a week after the jab, according to preliminary results of a study made public by the Israeli government Tuesday.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The findings offer one of the first looks at how effective a second booster shot might be at reducing the health impact of the omicron variant spreading rapidly around the globe.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Israel now offering fourth covid shot to anyone 60 and older</p></div>
<p>Critics had said the move was premature in the absence of data on a second booster’s safety and effectiveness. Some researchers didn’t rule out that repeat doses of the same vaccine could dampen the body’s immune response.</p>
<div><div><p>“The fourth shot acted just like the first and second shots,” said Sheba spokesperson Steve Walz. “A few people had low fevers, a few had sore arms but nothing more than that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The head of Britain’s lead advisory body on vaccinations warned Monday that too many booster rounds would divert resources from the broader effort to reach as many people as possible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Public health officials in Israel said the new findings added welcome information about the likely effectiveness of a fourth Pfizer shot. But some cautioned that the strategy of offering the additional booster was premature.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s kind of the right answer to the wrong question,” Levine said of the new study results. “That it raises the antibody levels is good news, but first we need to know if there is a need for another shot.”</p></div>

<div><h1>Israel rolls out Pfizer covid pill, using digital health records to identify those most at risk</h1></div>
<h2>The country is among the first to put the new coronavirus treatment into use</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steve Hendrix</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:58 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a very promising drug,” said Ian Miskin, an infectious-disease specialist who oversees the Paxlovid program at Clalit. “This gives us something to turn to when everything else has failed.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The first shipment of a reported 20,000 courses of Paxlovid arrived at Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport last week, making the country one of the first to obtain a supply.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pfizer would not comment on the specifics of its agreements with Israel. A spokesperson said Israel received Paxlovid early because the country was one of the first to give it regulatory clearance.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Some governments are easing rules for isolation, citing dangers of economic and health-care strains from omicron spread</p></div>
<div><div><p>To flatten the curve, physicians are targeting patients who have tested positive and have underlying risk factors but are not yet seriously sick. There’s a window of a few days to find and treat those who fit the bill.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before these conversations even occur, computers cross-tabulate reports of positive coronavirus tests with existing medical files, then flag those individuals who might be most at risk and most likely to benefit from the drug.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And so, he recalled, the sore throat and fever he developed last week were scary. The positive coronavirus result that arrived by text message late Friday was terrifying. He feared he might end up on a ventilator.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They said I was a perfect case but that it was totally up to me,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>His temperature had climbed, and his throat was burning by the next day when his wife ran out to meet a taxi on the street. She came back with a 30-pill course of medication, six a day for five days. He took the first three immediately.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Within 17 hours, his symptoms were almost gone, he said. “Now I’m just tired,” he said. “It’s like I went from covid to mononucleosis.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The fast rollout of the drug has once again made Israel a test case, a role the country has played several times during the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<a>world watched closely when Israel began administering the first shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine</a> on a national scale in late 2020 and again when it launched booster shots in 2021 and
<a>a second round of boosters </a>for some this week. Pfizer,
<a>under an agreement with the government</a>, has collected anonymous data on vaccine performance from the electronic health records of almost all of Israel’s 9 million residents.

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Adela Suliman</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 7:51 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s Nadal vs. Djokovic — but not on the tennis court.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Nadal, speaking Thursday after winning a match at the Melbourne Summer Set ATP 250 tournament, <a>told</a> reporters that Djokovic knew the risks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It’s normal that the people here in Australia get very frustrated with the case because they have been going through a lot of very hard lockdowns,” Nadal said. Djokovic “makes his own decision,” he added.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If you are vaccinated, you can play in the Australian Open and everywhere,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Novak Djokovic thought he’d aced Australian immigration. It now looks like a fault.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic, 34, who won the Australian Open last year, was <a>detained</a> by officials at the airport amid growing outrage over a decision to award the athlete a visa and medical exemption from vaccination requirements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australia, once known for its tough <a>“covid zero”</a> policies to keep the virus at bay, is now grappling with the <a>omicron variant</a> and one of the world’s sharpest spikes in infections.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Nadal</a> and <a>Djokovic</a> have previously tested positive for the coronavirus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Djokovic situation has spawned debate on social media along with <a>memes</a>, as <a>airlines</a> offer the player a ride home and others <a>refer</a> to him as “Novax Djokovic.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Rules are rules, and there are no special cases,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters Thursday, as he thanked border officers and confirmed that Djokovic’s visa had been canceled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our government’s strong border protection policies, and particularly in relation to the pandemic, [have ensured] Australia has one of the lowest death rates of covid anywhere in the world,” he said.</p></div></div>
<p>Tennis star <a>Novak Djokovic is facing deportation</a> after his travel visa for Australia was canceled.</p>
<p>Djokovic, whose vaccination status is unknown, arrived in Melbourne with a medical exemption to the <a>mandatory coronavirus vaccination</a> to compete in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>News of Djokovic’s vaccine exemption was <a>met with skepticism and pushback</a> from other quarters in the sport.</p>
<p>Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said earlier that Djokovic would be “on the next plane home” if the tennis star could not prove why he needed an <a>exemption from getting vaccinated</a>.</p>

<div><div><p>SYDNEY — When tennis star Novak Djokovic arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, he stepped off the plane into a different country than the one where he’d won the Australian Open a year earlier.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Rules are rules’: Australia cancels Novak Djokovic’s visa amid vaccine exemption uproar</p></div>
<div><p>After initially distancing himself from the saga, Prime Minister Scott Morrison seemed to embrace his government’s decision to turn away the tennis player, who he said lacked a medical exemption required of unvaccinated visitors.</p></div>
<a>bungled vaccine rollout</a> to a diplomatic
<a>spat with France</a> to its latest handling of an omicron surge, ahead of what is expected to be a tight electoral contest between Morrison’s conservative coalition and the opposition Labor party.
<div><p>Novak Djokovic’s vaccine exemption for Australian Open is met with skepticism</p></div>
<a>Indian cricketers</a> were able to visit last year. Djokovic was one of several dozen overseas tennis players allowed in a year ago for the Australian Open, which he won for the third year in a row.
<div><div><p>But a lot has changed in the past 12 months, said Steve Georgakis, an expert in the history and sociology of sport at the University of Sydney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With relatively few cases and a sports-mad populace, Australia carved out exceptions early in the pandemic to keep the games going even as most industries ground to a halt, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our sport in many ways continued uninterrupted,” he said. “It’s this great unifier of who we are, it brings people together, and it has brought our nation together.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Allowing big business to break the rules is not what Australian sport is all about,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other big change is that after a slow start, roughly 94 percent of eligible Australians are vaccinated, leaving little popular sympathy for Djokovic, who has said he <a>opposes vaccination</a> and vaccine mandates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That Djokovic was arriving in Melbourne, which has endured more time in lockdown than any other city on earth and seen the most deaths in Australia, added to the outrage.</p></div></div>
<a>movie posters</a> about people trapped at airports. One satirical website
<a>quipped</a> that Djokovic had instead decided to enter a tournament on Manus Island, where Australia detained asylum seekers.
<div><div><p>The initial decision to grant the tennis star a visa “didn’t pass the pub test,” meaning the average Australian wouldn’t agree with it, said Georgakis.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘A search for villains’: As Australia’s outbreak grows, so does covid shaming</p></div>
<div><div><p>The government “really misunderstood the Djokovic situation,” he said. “They look really silly now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While unvaccinated Australians are allowed to return to the country (with two weeks in hotel quarantine), visa holders must be vaccinated or have a medical exemption.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Morrison said Thursday that Djokovic did not have a “valid” medical exemption, suggesting that authorities in Victoria state, where Melbourne is located, and Tennis Australia were responsible for the mix-up.</p></div></div>
<p>“All I can say is that the evidence [for] medical exemption that was provided was found to be insufficient,” the prime minister said. But Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley shot back, saying his state wasn’t to blame.</p>
<div><div><p>“Someone issued Novak a visa, and it wasn’t the Victorian government,” Foley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government is now taking heat from Serbia, Djokovic’s home country, a few months after an embarrassing fallout with France over a canceled submarine deal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic is reportedly being held at a Melbourne hotel where detained asylum seekers have complained of maggots, though Minister for Home Affairs Karen Andrews refused to say where he was on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<p>The tennis star’s attorneys on Thursday won a last-minute bid to prevent his deportation, with a judge approving a temporary injunction that allows Djokovic to stay in Australia until at least Monday, when a further hearing will take place.</p>
<div><div><p>Djokovic has won the Australian Open nine times, more than any other player, and is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most Grand Slam titles. At the moment, his bid to break that record has been slammed shut.</p></div></div>

<p>The two men have strikingly different views of the kind of country Chile should be. José Antonio Kast, a former lawmaker from the right-wing Christian Social Front, opposes abortion, is critical of migration and promises law and order.</p>
<p>Gabriel Boric, a lawmaker with the left-wing I Approve Dignity coalition, wants to reform systems that many in Chile believe are the source of inequality in the prosperous South American nation: education, health care and government pensions.</p>
