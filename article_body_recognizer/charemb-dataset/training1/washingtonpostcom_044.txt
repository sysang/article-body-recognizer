<div><div><p>Bragg, the city’s first Black district attorney, said these changes will not only make people safer but also “free up prosecutorial resources to focus on violent crime,” according to the memo.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Data, and my personal experiences, show that reserving incarceration for matters involving significant harm will make us safer,” he wrote.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Garland vows to prosecute Jan. 6 riot criminals 'at all levels,' whether at the Capitol or not</p></div>
<div><div><p>While Bragg has discretionary authority to implement the new policies, he said he looked forward to holding “discussions” and working with the union and other parties in the following weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We urge judges to not stand in the way of these long overdue and necessary reforms,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added his assistant district attorneys would seek no more than a maximum of 20 years in prison for most crimes, except for extraordinary circumstances, and would never ask for a life sentence without parole.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, Bragg instructed prosecutors to consider the impacts of incarceration on public safety, communities and the financial costs, as well as the “racially disparate use of incarceration.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paulina Villegas</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 6:22 p.m. EST|Updated today at 9:11 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>On New Year’s Eve,<b> </b>deputies in St. Lucie County, located along the state’s Atlantic coast north of Palm Beach, responded to a call reporting an attempted suicide. When they arrived they learned it involved one of their own.</p>
<div><div><p>Deputy Clayton Osteen was hospitalized and taken off life support on Jan. 2, St. Lucie County Sheriff Ken J. Mascara said in a <a>statement</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the devastating news did not end there. On Tuesday, Mascara said Deputy Victoria Pacheco, who shared a 1-month-old son with Osteen, had died by suicide.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The deaths of the deputies, who Mascara described as “young, ambitious,” sent shock waves<b> </b>through the law enforcement agency.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Words cannot express the tremendous loss we all feel,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to a request for more details Thursday, but Mascara said earlier this week he hoped the deaths bring attention to the many challenges officers face while on duty.</p></div></div>
<a>report</a> found that first responders experience several barriers to access mental health treatment, such as stigma, a culture of not seeking help and a general lack of knowledge about mental health and treatment.
<b> </b>stressful work conditions first responders often experience “can contribute to the development of new mental health conditions or exacerbate preexisting mental health conditions.”
<div><div><p>The report also noted a lack of comprehensive national data on first responder mental health.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although the circumstances of the Florida deputy deaths remain unknown, the events have prompted broader discussions among current and former police officers about the impact the hardships of the job have on mental health.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“People don’t understand what we take home with us,” retired police officer Dana Bennett told WPTV, a local TV station. “When one of us hurts, we all hurt.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last week, a <a>Hillsborough County</a> deputy who had been with the agency for over two decades, also died by suicide, the sheriff of the Tampa-area county announced.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In 2020, the federal government passed the Law Enforcement Suicide Data Collection Act in hopes of a better understanding and prevention of suicides among current and past law enforcement officers of federal, state and local agencies.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Blue H.E.L.P., an organization that works to bring awareness to suicide and mental health issues in law enforcement, recorded 969 suicides of police and corrections officers since 2017.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A lifelong resident of Fort Pierce, Fla., Osteen joined the force in 2019 and was named<b> </b>deputy of the year in 2020, according to an <a>obituary</a> posted by the family on the website of Haisley Funeral Home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Previously, he served in the Marine Corps. He died at the age of 24.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He absolutely adored his significant other and mother of his child. But of all his accomplishments, he was most proud of being a dad,” said the obituary who described him as “one hell of a funny guy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On <a>Facebook</a>, friend Ray Tourville lamented Osteen’s death.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>According to WPTV, Pacheco, 23, joined the sheriff’s office in 2020 and received an award last year for her efforts in saving someone who overdosed on drugs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pushaw also pointed to data that shows 30 percent of first responders are affected by conditions like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement posted on a <a>GoFund</a><a>Me </a>page set up to support Osteen and Pacheco’s baby, the victims were described as “joy-filled, first-time parents excited about their growing family.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><a>World</a></div><div><h1>How the crisis in Kazakhstan unfolded</h1></div></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ruby Mellen</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 1:11 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s how, in less than a week, anger over rising fuel prices led to a deadly crackdown in the country of 19 million people.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here’s what you need to know about Kazakhstan’s unrest and Russian intervention</p></div>
<div><div><h3>Saturday: The cost of fuel skyrockets</h3></div><a>Return to menu</a></div>
<div><p>Kazakhstan, an oil-rich nation and one of the largest in the world by area, lifted price caps on liquefied petroleum gas, which is used to operate most vehicles. The move caused the price of fuel to skyrocket, roughly doubling overnight.</p></div>
<div><div><p>That sparked anger, especially in the less wealthy western region of Mangistau, where protests began to take hold over the weekend.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Protests in Kazakhstan are relatively rare; the government rules with an iron fist and has used violence to crack down on opposition. In 2011, police <a>fired</a> on demonstrators in Mangistau, killing more than a dozen people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3>Tuesday: Countrywide demonstrations</h3></div><a>Return to menu</a></div>
<p>Father of the Nation Nursultan Nazarbayev, 81, has ruled Kazakhstan for three decades, since the country gained independence in 1991. He handpicked Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as his successor as president in 2019, but has kept a firm grip on power.</p>
<div><div><p>Protesters shouted “Old man, go away!” as they rallied in frigid temperatures.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3>Wednesday: Escalation</h3></div><a>Return to menu</a></div>
<div><div><p>On Wednesday, the demonstrations got more heated. Protesters attempted to pull down a statue of Nazarbayev.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They set fire to government buildings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They also stormed the airport.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Russian troops intervene in protest-roiled Kazakhstan, where security forces have killed dozens of demonstrators</p></div>
<div><div><h3>Wednesday night: Tokayev calls on Russia</h3></div><a>Return to menu</a></div>
<div><div><p>With the Internet and messaging apps in much of the country blocked, Tokayev took to the state airwaves to call the demonstrators “international terrorists.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He called on Russia to help quell the protests.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Here’s what you need to know about Kazakhstan’s unrest</p></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, the alliance dispatched about 2,500 peacekeepers to Kazakhstan, the group’s secretary general, Stanislav Zas, told the Russian state new agency RIA. The report did not give a breakdown on nationalities.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The stakes are especially high for Russia, effectively the leader of the alliance, as its presence risks alienating a public that is demanding a change in Kazakhstan’s regime but has yet to show any anti-Russian sentiment.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He added: “Kazakhstan will test Russia’s actual capabilities. It will be both distracting and sobering.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There were been multiple reports of gunfire around the city throughout the day, and on Thursday evening Almaty police reported that additional “terrorists” were killed outside the Almalinksy district police station.</p></div></div>
<p>At least eight law enforcement officers have been killed, according to the Interior Ministry. More than 1,000 people have been injured in the protests, the Health Ministry said Thursday, 400 of whom have been hospitalized, with 62 in intensive care.</p>
<div><div><p>Kazakhstan’s Internet was blacked out Thursday and national banking services reportedly were suspended.</p></div></div>
<p>“It is a very awkward attempt to explain this threat in a very clumsy way so that it complies with the condition of the treaty that outlines the possibility of an intervention if one of the parties is under threat,” Dubnov added.</p>

<div><div><p>As the United States hurtled toward new coronavirus pandemic records on Thursday, experts debated the utility of some long-standing metrics to measure the impact of covid-19.</p></div></div>
<p>Here’s what to know</p>
<li>The omicron variant represented 95 percent of all U.S. coronavirus cases for the week ending Jan. 1, according to the CDC. This chart shows how fast the variant is spreading around the world.</li>
<li>Global coronavirus infections have reached a pandemic high, with 9.5 million new cases reported last week, the World Health Organization said Thursday.</li>

<div><div><div>By Brittany Shammas2:38 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<div><div><p>Omicron is unlikely to be the coronavirus’s last variant of concern, World Health Organization officials said Thursday, noting the virus will continue to mutate as it circulates.</p></div></div>
<p>Speaking during a news briefing, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said there is “still a lot of energy in this virus.” When the delta variant emerged, he said, some scientists wondered how it could adapt further when it had become so fit.</p>
<div><div><p>“And yet, we’ve seen a further variant emerge that is even more transmissible than delta, which was itself more transmissible than previous variants,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging-disease and zoonosis unit, said the question is what kinds of mutations happen in the future — and what their effect on the severity of the virus will be.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no inevitability that the next variant will be less severe or more severe,” she said. “We just have to see what happens as this virus evolves.”</p></div></div>

<h2>Record 4,000 children hospitalized amid omicron surge</h2>
<div><div><div>By Andrew Jeong12:52 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<p>More than 4,000 children were hospitalized with covid-19 across the nation Wednesday, Washington Post figures show, marking a new high that towers above previous peaks set during the summer when the delta variant was driving up infections.</p>
<div><p>The tally, which includes confirmed as well as suspected pediatric covid-19 patients, reflects a steep rise in infections in that group. Less than two weeks ago, on Christmas, fewer than 2,000 children were in hospitals with covid. </p></div>
<div><div><p>The seven-day average of pediatric hospitalizations was slightly lower at 3,713. Hospitalizations of adults are also rising rapidly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, patients who have been more recently infected appear less likely to be hospitalized or put in intensive care, according to preliminary studies.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>even when accounting for vaccination status, according to
<a>a recent study</a> done by researchers from Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine.
<div><div><p>But even with less severe symptoms, the increase in the number of covid-19 patients can still overwhelm hospitals and result in more patients with serious illness, <a>health experts say.</a></p></div></div>

<a>pressed</a> the White House to more aggressively help to vaccinate the world, saying that too little has been done to tamp down the risk of virus variants emerging abroad.
<div><div><p>The Biden administration also has been widely criticized for failing to move faster to acquire and distribute hundreds of millions of rapid coronavirus tests, <a>passing on opportunities</a> last year to do so.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Legal news service sues Virginia for access to online court records</h1></div>
<h2>Lawyers have remote access to court records in Virginia and Maryland, but the public does not, unlike most states and federal court</h2>

<a>Virginia law</a> prohibits online access in all counties for non-lawyers, unless they are parties to a case, because confidential information might be in a filing. But attorneys for CNS contend that
<a>state law</a> does not prohibit such access and that Virginia is interpreting the law overbroadly.

<b> </b>public access to the online records is unconstitutional.
<b> </b>The remote system developed by the state Supreme Court is called the Officer of the Court Remote Access, or OCRA — seeming to exclude members of the public from the start.
<div><div><p>The law also states that any data remotely accessed may not be “redistributed to any third party,” and subscribers must ensure that “such data is not made available to the general public.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>El Shafee Elsheikh, who is facing a January trial in Alexandria federal court, is accused of being part of a notorious quartet of ISIS hostage-takers, known as “The Beatles” because of their British accents.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Full interview with ISIS militant linked to killings of hostages</span></p></div>
<div><p>Elsheikh told the interviewers Emwazi had burned the body of another American journalist, Steven Sotloff, because the ground was too hard for a burial and he was afraid of spending too long outside, according to the court record.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Elsheikh also spoke in detail about the death of British aid worker David Haines, an FBI agent testified in court during a November hearing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Foley was a friend, he explained: “It was too close to home.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Only a brief portion of Langan’s interview with Elsheikh has been released; prosecutors plan to use more of it at trial.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Three officials in the SDF came to Alexandria court in person to rebut Elsheikh’s claims of torture, the first time anyone from the U.S.-allied Kurdish fighting force has appeared in an American court.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The testimony offered a rare, if limited, perspective on the detention centers where thousands of former Islamic State supporters are held.</p></div></div>
<p>“Our own families and our own communities lack electricity,” the man in charge of coordinating with international allies testified. “We are a war zone ... the general population, we’re not able to access medications.”</p>
<div><div><p>But the SDF leaders denied hurting Elsheikh in any way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Moreover, he added, the SDF didn’t have the capacity to translate English-language media interviews into Arabic or Kurdish and so had no stake in what detainees told Western reporters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have no idea what’s going on” in the media interviews, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Defense attorney Nina Ginsberg suggested that he might be reluctant to acknowledge abuse because he could lose his job.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My job?” he asked incredulously. “My job is all hardship.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ellis agreed in court that the SDF officials had reason to understate problems in their prisons, but he said that didn’t “come close” to showing Elsheikh was forced into confessions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Prosecutors said Elsheikh made no complaint to the Red Cross of abuse during his detention; he was given a medical examination when taken into U.S. custody that showed only a “prostration mark” from praying.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>in court. “The victims in this case, those are the individuals that were tortured, that were beaten, that were given threats.”

<h2>Robert S. Palmer watched and cheered rioters, then joined front of mob and hurled a fire extinguisher, plank and long pole at police</h2>

<div><p>Red Flags: Law enforcement agencies failed to heed mounting warnings about violence on Jan. 6.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Palmer said, “I’m really, really ashamed of what I did.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said that while in jail he saw footage of himself on an MSNBC news program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was horrified, absolutely devastated to see myself on there,” Palmer said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In a letter to the judge last month, he wrote, “I realize that we, meaning Trump supporters, were lied to by those that at the time had great power, meaning the sitting president as well as those acting on his behalf.”</p></div>
<div><p>About 50 minutes later, Palmer made his way down to the heart of the battle, prosecutors said, holding a wooden plank and then throwing it at officers. It landed atop a riot shield. Palmer was not accused of directly injuring anyone.</p></div>

<div><div><p>Palmer later gave media interviews portraying himself as a victim and that he had done nothing wrong.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chutkan asked him about his online post last month, seeking to raise money for his defense, in which he said he was acting in self-defense.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When you threw the fire extinguisher and the pole,” the judge asked, “were you acting in self-defense?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No, ma’am, I was not,” Palmer replied.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Later, Palmer said: “The officers were so brave to stand there and take the stuff they did. I’m just very ashamed to be a part of that. … It was a lie. It should never have happened.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Chutkan said, “I don’t know if your remorse now is genuine or not. It sounds like it is. Your actions after your plea undercut that argument.”</p></div></div>
