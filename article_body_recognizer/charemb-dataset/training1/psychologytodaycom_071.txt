<li>Inability to engage in typical back and forth conversation</li>
<li>Inability to reciprocate social or emotional feelings</li>
<li>Not seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or achievements with others</li>
<li>Failure to develop and maintain peer relationships</li>
<li>Inflexibility about specific routines or rituals</li>

<a>comorbid</a> conditions many adults with ADHD struggle with, such as
<a>insomnia</a>. Though therapy and medication work well in concert, some adults find that just one approach in isolation is sufficient to control their symptoms. Many adults also focus on lifestyle changes, such as exercising more regularly or starting a

<div> <div> <h1>Specific Phobia</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>The <a>DSM-5</a> divides specific phobias into five broad categories:</p>
<li>Animals, such as a fear of spiders, dogs, or bugs.</li>
<li>The natural environment, such as fear of heights or thunderstorms.</li>
<li>Blood, injury, and injection, such as a fear of needles or medical procedures.</li>
<li>Situational, such as a fear of flying or riding in elevators.</li>
<li>Others, such as a fear of vomiting or choking.</li>
<p>Globally, Asian, African, and Latin American countries report significantly lower rates of specific phobias, at between 2 to 4 percent, according to the DSM.</p>
<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Symptoms </li> <li> Causes </li> <li> Treatment </li> </ul> </div>
<li>Deep fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation, which may result in crying, stiffening, escaping the situation, or a panic attack.</li>
<li>The object or situation always provokes almost immediate fear or anxiety.</li>
<li>The individual actively avoids the object or situation.</li>
<li>The danger posed by the object or situation is not proportional to the fear that is experienced.</li>
<li>The phobia disrupts the person's daily life.</li>
<p>In children, a specific phobia generally prompts crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging.</p>
<p>Many individuals with a specific phobia will change their lifestyles to avoid their fear as much as possible; for example, moving to a region where certain animals are rare or where there is no subway.</p>
<p>For a diagnosis of specific phobia to be made, the symptoms must persist for at least six months and not be due to social anxiety, separation anxiety, agoraphobia, post-traumaticstress disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder.</p>
<div> <h3> What are the most common phobias? </h3> </div>
<p>There are many specific phobias, some of which are widespread among the population, many of which are rare, and some of which are so idiosyncratic that no terminology describes them. Some of the most common phobias include:</p>
<p>Arachnophobia: the fear of spiders</p>
<p>Trypanophobia: the fear of injections</p>
<p>Agoraphobia: the fear of not being able to escape from a place</p>
<p>Nyctophobia: the fear of the dark</p>
<p>Ophidiophobia: the fear of snakes</p>
<p>Coulrophobia: the fear of clowns</p>
<p>Acrophobia: the fear of heights</p>
<p>Aerophobia: the fear of flying</p>
<p>Cynophobia: the fear of dogs</p>
<p>Astraphobia: the fear of thunder and lightning</p>

<p>While the exact cause is unknown, certain factors and personality traits appear to increase one's risk of developing specific phobias. Neuroticism and frequent worries may also increase the risk.</p>
<p>Certain specific experiences can elevate the risk as well, such as having overprotective parents, losing a parent, sexual or physical abuse, and trauma related to the specific fear.</p>
<p>Genetics may also play a role; individuals who have a first-degree relative with a specific phobia are more likely to have that same specific phobia.</p>

<div> <h3> Do specific phobias affect men and women differently? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are specific phobias the result of evolution? </h3> </div>
<p>Cognitive-behavioraltherapy (CBT) combined with exposure therapy is the leading approach for treating specific phobias. CBT interventions help change the thinking and behaviors that cause distress in specific situations.</p>
<p>Medications such as beta-blockers are sometimes used to reduce anxiety, primarily in the short-term, such as when a feared situation is necessary or unavoidable.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>Separation Anxiety</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Separation anxiety refers to excessive <a>fear</a> or worry about separation from home or an <a>attachment</a> figure.</p>
<a>DSM-5</a>. This condition occurs equally in males and females.
<p>Symptoms of separation anxiety disorder include:</p>
<li>Excessive distress when separated from the home or <a>attachment</a> figures</li>
<li>Worry about losing or harm coming to major attachment figures</li>
<li>Excessive worry about experiencing an unexpected negative event (getting lost, becoming ill) that leads to separation from attachment figures</li>
<li>Refusal to leave home, school, work, or another place because of <a>fear</a> of separation</li>
<li>Persistent fear about being alone or without major attachment figures at home or other places. In children, this may look like clinging behavior or staying close to the parent around the house. </li>
<li>Refusal or reluctance to sleep away from home or to go to sleep without attachment figures nearby</li>
<li>Nightmares involving themes of separation from home or major attachment figures</li>
<li>Repeated physical complaints such as headaches and nausea when separation has occurred or is anticipated</li>
<div> <h3> When should separation anxiety disorder be considered a problem? </h3> </div>

<a>divorce</a>, or some disaster that separates an individual from their loved ones. Additionally, having parents who are overprotective or intrusive might lead to separation anxiety disorder.
<div> <h3> Is there a genetic factor in separation anxiety disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>While the precise role of the genetic factors involved in separation anxiety disorder has not been established, research has shown that the condition might be heritable.</p> </div> </div>
<a>psychotherapy</a>, changes in
<a>parenting</a> techniques for adolescents (and for
<a>anxious</a> adults with children), and anti-anxiety medications. Treatment for certain cases may involve family
<a>education</a> and family therapy.
<p>For younger children, a parent or <a>caregiver</a> can take the following actions:</p>
<li>Try to schedule departures after naps and mealtimes since the child will be more susceptible to separation anxiety when tired, hungry, or sick.</li>
<a>confidence</a>: "I know you don't want me to go away right now, but I will be back after school." Do not tease: "You're so silly to cry about it." Do not sound annoyed: "You make me feel so mad when you cry like that."
<li>Stay calm, matter-of-fact, and sympathetic: "I know you are upset that I have to go into the kitchen, but I need to cook dinner." </li>
<li>Create feelings of security for the toddler by providing lots of love and <a>attention</a>. Young children learn faster when they receive necessary attention and affection than by the parent's taking a "learn the hard way" attitude.</li>
<li>Do not sneak away from the child. It might be tempting, but this approach will only lead to more difficulty during the next departure.</li>
<li>Parents also need to maintain control over their own anxieties. If the child senses or sees a parent's distress when they leave, it will signal to the child that something is wrong.</li>
