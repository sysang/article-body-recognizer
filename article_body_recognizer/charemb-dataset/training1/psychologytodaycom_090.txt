<h1> 6 Tips for Happiness </h1>
<h2> How about “happiness” as a goal for the new year? </h2>
<li>The cash and prizes we spend most of our time and effort to obtain are nothing more than window dressing. They don’t bring happiness. </li>
<li>If we think negative thoughts, our outlook will reflect that. If we choose to think positive thoughts, that too will manifest. </li>
<li>People who are grateful for what they have tend to focus on their strengths rather than their weaknesses.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: smrm1977/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>addiction</a> treatment, failing relationships, etc.
<p>So what is the answer to all of this unhappiness? (The real answer, not the surface answer of looking good in the eyes of others.) The simple truth is that there is no single answer, but most people find the following suggestions helpful:</p>
<h3>1. Accept Imperfection—in Yourself and Others</h3>
<h3>3. Turn “Love” Into an Action Word</h3>
<h3>4. Stop Judging Yourself and Others</h3>
<h3>5. Choose Happiness Over Negativity</h3>
<h3>6. Find and Express Gratitude</h3>
<a>stressed</a> out, less likely to get stuck in
<a>depression</a>, and more likely to recover from serious life issues (e.g., illness, addiction). So gratitude is powerful medicine, no matter what ails us.

<p>Leveraging psychology for college student success</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2>The Unexpected Effects of Nudging</h2> <p>Even the best-designed nudges can lead to unexpected outcomes. But there are lessons we can learn from interventions that did not work as intended.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Healthier College Students Through Texting</a></h2>
<p>College students engage in all kinds of risky behaviors, from smoking to excessive alcohol use. Could colleges use text messaging as a way to motivate students to be healthier? </p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>How to Get College Students to (Maybe) Check Their E-mail</a></h2> <p>College students have at least one thing in common: They don't check e-mail. Customizing your messaging will prevent students from tuning you out.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Nurturing a Culture of Growth</a></h2> <p>Programs that teach a growth mindset are great—but if we want these beliefs to persist we need to build growth mindsets into our homes, our schools, and our workplaces.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Eliminating the Pitfalls of Higher Education</a></h2> <p>Video games are more fun with obstacles. College should not be the same way. Innovative programs are eliminating the traps that lead students to a Game Over.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Growth Mindsets Around the Globe</a></h2> <p>Growth mindsets are a major force in modern education, but what do we know about how mindsets impact students outside of the U.S.? Recent studies shed light on this question.</p> </div>
<h2><a>6 Tips for Keeping Your New Year’s Resolution</a></h2>
<p>Want to succeed at your New Year's resolution this time? Here are six tips derived from behavioral science to help you get started, stick to your plan, and handle setbacks.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Why Interventions Work Is as Important as If They Work</a></h2> <p>Evaluation of a new program is often more concerned with if it works rather than why it works. But asking "why?" can provide a lot of hidden benefits.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>#NudgeTheVote</a></h2> <p>Half of America won't vote tomorrow. Behavioral science offers strategies for getting more people (including yourself) to show up to the polls.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Secret to Getting A’s? Getting More Z’s</a></h2> <p>Many college students are not getting enough sleep to be at their best. These evidence-based strategies can help them sleep better.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Innovative Ways to Help First-Generation Students Thrive</a></h2>
<p>Graduating more first-generation students is key to reducing economic inequality. Three recent interventions provide unique approaches to helping these students succeed.</p>
<div> <h2><a>We Need More Behavioral Research at Community Colleges</a></h2> <p>More interventions for community college students are leveraging behavioral science. But we need researchers to study how interventions work in this context.</p> </div>
<h2><a>The Power of Stories to Teach and Motivate STEM Students</a></h2>
<p>STEM students learn all about scientists like Einstein, Newton, and more. But what they learn about these famous figures may affect whether they, too, want to pursue science.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>3 Ways a Growth Mindset Benefits Companies and Employees</a></h2> <p>Think growth mindsets just affect students in the classroom? Think again. Whether your employer has a growth mindset can impact both you and them.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Why Your Students Should Journal Before a Test</a></h2> <p>Students can't succeed in math when their math anxiety takes over. A simple, 10-minute writing exercise can help students set aside those intrusive thoughts.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>3 Ways to Get More Students to Visit Career Services</a></h2>
<p>Study shows that many college graduates never take advantage of Career Services. Behavioral science offers ideas for getting more students to sit down with a career counselor.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Using Self-Affirmation to Support Struggling Students</a></h2> <p>Students underperforming in the classroom? A short exercise could alleviate the threat impairing their performance.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Behavioral Science on the Homepage</a></h2> <p>College websites say a lot about who belongs there, and not all of it is intentional. Leveraging social psychology in your website's design may help increase student success.</p> </div>
<h2><a>3 Ways Behavioral Science Is Impacting College Students</a></h2>
<p>A group of student success experts recently took to the stage to discuss how their campuses are leveraging behavioral science to bolster persistence and graduation.</p>
<h2><a>Helping College Students Cross the Finish Line</a></h2>
<p>Many college students leave school only a few credits from a degree. A new study shows that proactive nudges for near completers could prevent more of them from falling just short.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Put Down That Beer and Pick Up Your Phone</a></h2> <p>Colleges have tried a million ways to reduce students' binge drinking. Could behavioral science offer another approach?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How to Talk to Students About Why STEM Matters</a></h2> <p>A few lessons on how to talk to STEM students about why what they're learning matters and motivate them to pursue science.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Can Nudging Help Students who are Homeless and Hungry?</a></h2> <p>An increasing number of college students attend classes despite lacking food, shelter, or both. Can behavioral science provide some solutions?</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Would Anyone Want to Major in STEM?</a></h2> <p>Why should college students major in STEM? Intriguing research suggests that it's about more than career prospects and starting salaries.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Nudges in the Wild: Merely Exposing Children to College</a></h2> <p>In Claremont, California, just walking down the street could change how children there think about going to college.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Upward Spirals of Support for College Students</a></h2> <p>How can we get college students to adopt new behaviors to succeed in school? Lessons from positive psychology suggest a new approach.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Believing in Change for More Than Good Grades</a></h2> <p>Efforts to foster growth mindsets have taken hold in higher education. But it might be time for us to think beyond growth mindsets to help college students thrive.</p> </div>

<h2> <a>Using Self-Persuasion to Improve Educational Equity</a> </h2>
<p> Colleges use inspirational student stories to encourage more underrepresented students to attend. But a moment of self-persuasion may be necessary to internalize that message. </p>
<h2> <a>3 Strategies to Help College Students Find Employment</a> </h2>
<p> College students need to be ready for the job market, both now and when they graduate. These simple interventions can motivate their search and help them land the job. </p>

<p>I was about 10 years old when my parents decided to move our family across town. Why?</p>
<p>As I got older, things changed. I listened to my parents debate whether to buy a new car, how they were going to vote that November, and which relative should host Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>By the time I was in high school, my dad showed me the decision-making process he used at work—writing down pros and cons on a sheet of paper, along with the assumptions behind them, questioning everything before arriving at an answer.</p>
<p>Don’t make all of life’s big decisions behind closed doors. </p>
<p>Do talk openly about decisions and how you’re thinking them through. Show kids how you consider multiple options before making a choice. Let them see you weigh pros and cons, debate risks and probabilities.</p>

<h1> Does Personalized Marketing Work? </h1>
<h2> 5 factors can render tailored advertisements ineffective. </h2>
<li>Personalized matching is when marketers tailor aspects of their message or its delivery to the recipient.</li>
<li>Advertisement are sometimes rendered less effective when recipients respond negatively to personalized matching.</li>
<li>Backfire effects fall into five categories: invasion of privacy, attempt at manipulation, unfair judgment, known content, and weak arguments.</li>

<a>have reservations</a> about targeted advertising that might cause them to avoid such ads and resist their influence. Given how widespread personalized advertising has become, just how susceptible to influence are we?
<a>our research team</a> at Ohio State University recently reviewed decades of psychology and
<a>consumer behavior</a> research studies on the effectiveness of different types of personalization for changing consumers’ attitudes and behavior. The
<a>review</a> is published in the Journal of Consumer Psychology.
<p>As it turns out, although personalized marketing <a>can be effective</a>, it is not always effective and can even backfire. Here are some things for skeptical consumers to be aware of when it comes to personalization.</p>
<h3>What Is Personalized Matching?</h3>
<a>goals</a> (i.e., a message-to-recipient match).
<a>showing </a>that a Republican politician has more success than a Democrat in persuading Republican voters to support a policy (and vice versa), and that
<a>powerful</a> (vs. low power) sources are more persuasive to powerful (vs. low power) recipients (and vice versa).
<h3>When Does Personalized Matching Backfire?</h3>
<a>when companies obtain consent</a> to collect and use their data.
<a>Attempt at manipulation</a>. Matching backfires if consumers believe marketers are attempting to
<a>control or manipulate</a> them in some way. The most
<a>marketing savvy consumers</a> are especially resistant to manipulation. Thus, learning about the psychology of
<a>persuasion</a> can help consumers protect themselves.
<a>Unfair or stereotypic judgment</a>. Matching backfires when consumers view an ad as targeting them based on an unfair or stereotypic judgment about them, such as about their
<a>gender identity</a>, age, race, or weight. Invasiveness, manipulation, and stereotyping should be avoided for obvious ethical reasons. But sometimes matching is ineffective simply because consumers find it to be annoying.
