<h1> 5 Insights About Being Courageous at Work </h1>
<h2> Being competently courageous is about commitment and practice, not personality. </h2>
<li>Courageous behavior is a choice anyone can make, not just the responsibility of those with some imagined personality type or characteristic.</li>
<li>Courageous behaviors in workplaces take many forms (beyond whistleblowing and other major acts). Opportunities are ubiquitous.</li>
<li>Like any behavioral skill or useful mindset, competent courage comes from routine, deliberate practice.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Photo credit: Klaus Vedfelt / DigitalVision / Getty Images</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Choosing Courage</a> (Harvard Business Review Press, 2021), I briefly share five of them here.
<a>ethnicity</a>, nationality, religious commitment, income level and so many other dimensions we use to categorize people. Sure, some people are more
<a>risk-taking</a>. That, however, does not necessarily translate into actions taken on behalf of others, or actions done with sufficient skill to make a positive difference.
<a>stressful</a> situations precisely because they’ve spent years training to effectively own this kind of responsibility. All of us can make the same choice.
<p>Insight 2: <a>Fear</a> doesn’t mean you can’t or shouldn’t act courageously. It means the stage is set.</p>
<a>wrote</a>: “The absence of fear is not courage; the absence of fear is some kind of brain damage.” We need to accept that courage is about taking action despite our fears.
<p>For most people, what comes to mind first are economic or <a>career</a> risks. We’re afraid that if we push the envelope too far, we could get fired, blackballed, held back, or otherwise negatively impacted financially.</p>
<p>So, yes, there are lots of fears. But acknowledging fear doesn’t mean a courageous act is impossible. It means the stage is set.</p>
<p>Remember, if there’s no perceived risk to an action, it’s not courageous! Courage is about what we do despite acknowledging we’re afraid. It’s about not turtling.</p>
<p>Insight 3: “Truth to power” acts might be the prototype of courageous action in the workplace, but they’re far from the only behaviors commonly seen as courageous.</p>
<p>Whether it’s about speaking honestly to our direct bosses or skip-level leaders, or using our own judgment in ways that might <a>anger</a> authorities, or defending others from those in power, we know we might be courting trouble.</p>
<a>data</a> also show that the behaviors seen as courageous in many places are also positively related to individual, group, and organizational well-being.
<p>Insight 4: The moment matters, but so does what you do before and after.</p>
<p>Insight 5: Courageous acts aren’t only the biggest and scariest things you can think of, and not the right place to start anyway.</p>
<p>If you ask people about something courageous they could do at work, they’re likely to tell you about something that involves risking their job or important relationships.</p>
