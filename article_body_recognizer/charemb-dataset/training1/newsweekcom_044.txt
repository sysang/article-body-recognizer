<p>The legislators say their goal is to provide parents in the state with more transparency on who is teaching their children in public schools and the chance to have more input on what is taught and why.</p>
<p>Currently, Indiana is one of 42 states where school board elections are nonpartisan.</p>
<p>House Education Committee Chairman Bob Behning, a Republican, said candidates would be allowed to choose whether they were publicly identified with a political party.</p>
<p>"I would argue that putting an R or D behind your name does not necessarily identify exactly where you're going to be in terms of school policy," Behning said. "I do see some value, maybe, in allowing candidates to self identify."</p>
<p>The issues poised for Indiana's legislative session that starts January 4 come amid complaints from conservatives across the country about public schools.</p>
<p>Others in the Republican-dominated Indiana Legislature, however, want to go further.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Bob Morris of Fort Wayne said he has heard many complaints about closed school board meetings and "limited opportunities" for the public to engage in school decisions.</p>
<p>Republican lawmakers in other states are pushing legislation to ban the teaching of "critical race theory," which has become a catch-all term for efforts to teach that systemic racism remains a persistent problem in the U.S.</p>
<p>Indiana legislative leaders don't appear set to go that far.</p>
<p>Republican House Speaker Todd Huston has said he expects a bill "ensuring that parents have more insight and input into the curricular materials and surveys being used in their schools."</p>
<p>Tom Simpson, a Yorktown School Board member who is president of the Indiana School Board Association, said he believed most school board meetings have remained civil as meeting attendance and participation has increased during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Potter, 49, testified Friday and told the jury she was "sorry it happened" and "didn't want to hurt anyone."</p>
<p>Prosecutor Erin Eldridge told the jurors during closing arguments Monday that the case isn't about if Potter is sorry, it is about her actions.</p>
<p>"Of course she feels bad about what she did…but that has no place in your deliberations," she said.</p>
<p>Defense attorney Earl Gray told the jury that Potter didn't know she was holding her gun after she meant to grab her Taser during a traffic stop that "was chaos."</p>
<p>During her testimony Friday, Potter said she announced the Taser warning after she saw the fear on another police officer's face, but said she didn't want to hurt anyone.</p>
<p>Potter testified she doesn't remember exactly what she said during the incident or the events after the shooting, and those details in her memory are "missing."</p>
<p>Potter said if she was alone that day instead of training another officer, she probably wouldn't have pulled Wright over for an expired license plate and having an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror.</p>
<p>The defense rested their case Friday, and the jury began deliberations around 1 p.m. Monday.</p>
<p>Eldridge said during closing arguments in Potter's manslaughter trial that Wright's death was "entirely preventable. Totally avoidable."</p>
<p>"She drew a deadly weapon," Eldridge told the court. "She aimed it. She pointed it at Daunte Wright's chest, and she fired."</p>
<p>Gray, though, argued that Wright "caused the whole incident" because he tried to flee from police during a traffic stop.</p>
<p>"Daunte Wright caused his own death, unfortunately," Gray argued.</p>
<p>"Playing the video not at the right speed where it showed chaos, playing it as slow as possible…that's the rabbit hole of misdirection," Gray said.</p>
<p>As prosecutors have done throughout the three-week trial, Eldridge stressed that the former Brooklyn Center police officer was a "highly trained" and "highly experienced" 26-year veteran and said that she acted recklessly when she killed Wright.</p>
<p>"She made a series of bad choices that led to her shooting and killing Daunte Wright," Eldridge said. "This was no little oopsie. This was not putting the wrong date on a check.…This was a colossal screwup. A blunder of epic proportions."</p>
<p>"Carrying a badge and a gun is not a license to kill," she said.</p>
<p>Eldridge also downplayed testimony from other officers who either described Potter as a good person or said they saw nothing wrong in her actions: "The defendant has found herself in trouble, and her police family has her back."</p>
<p>"I remember yelling, 'Taser, Taser, Taser,' and nothing happened, and then he told me I shot him," Potter, who is white, said through tears. Her body camera recorded Wright saying, "Ah, he shot me," after the shooting.</p>
<p>Potter's attorneys argued that she made a mistake but also would have been justified in using deadly force if she had meant to because of the potential harm to the other officer, then-Sgt. Mychal Johnson, if he had been dragged by Wright's car.</p>
<p>Wright's death set off angry demonstrations for several days in Brooklyn Center. It happened as another white officer, <a>Derek Chauvin</a>, was standing trial in nearby Minneapolis for the killing of <a>George Floyd</a>.</p>
<p>Judge Regina Chu told jurors that intent is not part of the charges against Potter and that the state doesn't have to prove she tried to kill Wright.</p>
<p>For second-degree manslaughter, the state must prove that she acted with culpable negligence, meaning she consciously took a chance of causing death or great bodily harm.</p>

<p>Anne Milgram, the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, said Sunday that officials have seized enough doses of fentanyl in the past year to "kill every single American," as the nation grapples with 100,000 opioid deaths.</p>
<p>Speaking on Face the Nation, Milgram said the agency has collected 15,000 pounds of the powerful synthetic opioid that has been fueling drug overdoses across the country.</p>
<p>In other cases, drug traffickers are lacing cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and even marijuana with the deadly substance in an effort to make their products more addictive.</p>
<p>Milgram said the DEA is currently investigating cartels, traffickers, and social media in order to understand "the full network, from Mexico to Main Street, that is causing harm and is killing Americans."</p>
<p>In the meantime, the DEA administrator urged parents to discuss the growing prevalence of fentanyl with their children.</p>

<div> World Crocodile <a>Wildlife</a> <a>Australia</a></div>
<p>A video showing a crocodile over 12 feet long being dragged from a river in Australia has been viewed more than 2,500 times on YouTube.</p>
<p>Northern Territories resident Nathan Langer uploaded the video on his channel Hunting NT as a warning to anyone venturing to Buffalo Creek, north of Darwin, the capital city of the region.</p>
<p>The video shows two wildlife rangers dragging the croc from the murky waterway onto a boat. Langer shouts over to the rangers asking if the reptile is four meters long. They correct him saying that it is just 3.5 meters long.</p>
<p>The actual measurement of the crocodile was almost exactly halfway between the two estimates with it measuring 3.78 meters, or 12.4 feet, 9News reported.</p>
