<h1> Kevin Rooney is suddenly doing it all for Rangers</h1>

<div> November 25, 2021 3:32pm <div> Updated <div> November 25, 2021 8:40pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Morgan Barron, currently with the Rangers’ AHL affiliate in Hartford, best captured the essence of Kevin Rooney earlier this season, when the 22-year-old was asked if he was frustrated starting the season in the minors.</p>
<p>“He’s just one of the guys in the dressing room that I can look at, who’s done it the right way.”</p>
<h1> Rangers finding blue-collar identity</h1>
<div> October 22, 2021 7:43pm <div> Updated <div> October 22, 2021 10:54pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Regarding the Rangers, going for the sweep of their four-game road trip, which concludes Saturday afternoon at Ottawa:</p>
<p>1. So maybe it’s the NHL team that should be called the Wolf Pack, because when one Ranger is challenged on the ice, his four teammates immediately descend to lend support and protection.</p>
<p>The same happened when Ryan Reaves was involved at the side boards. And of course, when Sammy Blais was elbowed in the face by Matt Benning, Dryden Hunt was there for the cause.</p>
<p>It is a long season. The Rangers are going to need to sprinkle in a few more goals along the way. They may need to find someone who can do that for them. The marathon has a way of exposing the truth about a team. There are miles and miles to go.</p>
<a>play is coming at him fast and hard</a>. The Rangers are trapped in their own end as often as not when the 21-year-old Swede is on the ice. He has not yet been dynamic with the puck at either end.
<p>If the hierarchy believes that Lundkvist belongs in Hartford for a spell, if it is determined that Zac Jones would provide more at the moment for the Rangers, then that is the way general manager Chris Drury must go.</p>
<p>Oh, and please, can we all please stop with the comparisons to Fox. Yes, both Lundkvist and Fox play the right side, they both are undersized by traditional standards and they have similar styles.</p>
<p>But Fox — in Lundkvist’s words two days ago — “is the best defenseman in the whole world.” And Fox has been even better this year than last year. A second straight Norris Trophy is hardly out of reach.</p>
<p>Two years ago, when the power play clicked at nearly 30 percent over the final three months of the year, Panarin was almost always stationed in the left circle, from where his off-wing one timer was a lethal weapon.</p>

<h1> Ryan Reaves helping physical fourth line spark streaking Rangers</h1>
<div> December 6, 2021 7:20pm <div> Updated <div> December 6, 2021 7:20pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Upon hearing that Adam Fox recently said the Rangers feel safer with Ryan Reaves on the ice, Reaves could only point to the obvious. </p>
<p>“If he didn’t say that, I would have not done my job for sure,” he said. “That’s what I’m here for.” </p>
<p>This is, indeed, a group well aware of its identity. </p>
<p>That has an effect of wearing teams down, and letting opposing defensemen know they can’t get away with everything. Ryan Lindgren described playing against a line like that as taking a toll on defenders. </p>
<p>“You kinda know in the back of your head, if you’re going back to get the puck, you’re gonna take a hit,” Lindgren said. “Those guys do a great job.” </p>
<p>Reaves noted that he hasn’t fought as much this season as in the past, when he played with the Golden Knights and Blues. But that’s not for lack of trying. </p>
<p>In the past, Reaves has played for coaches who do things the other way. He described sitting for 15 minutes, his legs seizing up once he gets on the ice, then committing a turnover and getting yelled at. </p>
<p>“Well,” he said, “it’s impossible to play [in that situation].” </p>
<p>Gallant’s approach, he said, lends itself to playing with confidence. </p>
<h1> The wild journey that led Artemi Panarin to Rangers stardom</h1>
<div> January 6, 2020 7:00am <div> Updated <div> January 6, 2020 7:00am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Now, there is everything.</p>
<p>Artemi Panarin is poised to become a star like so few Rangers have before him. He has the chance to hold the Big Apple in the palm of his hand. It is almost unimaginable considering where he came from — and what he had to do to get here.</p>
<p>“A million stories,” Rangers team president John Davidson told The Post. “It’s fascinating.”</p>
<p>But Manhattan is still a very long way from Korkino, Russia.</p>
<p>As he first told the story to The Athletic, there is a big difference between poor and poverty. Panarin had the essentials, but getting by wasn’t easy.</p>
<p>Vladimir was a celebrated hockey player but never made it out of Korkino, yet he wanted Artemi to play, and wanted him to make it out.</p>
<p>“I think he has great respect for who really helped him as a child,” Davidson said.</p>
<blockquote><p>No idea I [would] play in the NHL five years ago, six years ago. I was thinking that I don’t have [a] chance at that. I wasn’t drafted. — Artemi Panarin</p></blockquote>
<p>He remembered grabbing his sweater after that goal and screaming, “Korkino!”</p>
<p>Panarin went on to establish himself in the KHL, winning a championship with SKA St. Peterburg and drawing the attention of NHL clubs. He signed an entry-level deal with the Blackhawks in April 2015, and the dream was realized.</p>
<p>“No idea I [would] play in the NHL five years ago, six years ago,” Panarin said. “I was thinking that I don’t have [a] chance at that. I wasn’t drafted.”</p>
<p>“So,” he said with a smile and a shrug, “good luck for me.”</p>
<p>So just after Davidson left to take over the Rangers, Panarin followed by signing a seven-year, $81.5 million deal. With so many of the Rangers’ previous free-agent signings having blown up in their face, there was a ton of pressure.</p>
<p>“He always been a great player in this league, and right from the minute he got here. But he’s better than I thought he was going to be.”</p>
<p>“He’s got an unbelievable personality, and the guys completely love him,” Strome said. “He’s been super special for me, and this group.”</p>
<p>After one of his first preseason games, Panarin was chatting with a couple reporters, asking if his English was getting better. It was, he was told.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, “I have seven years to get better.”</p>
<p>That is a promising thought for the Rangers, who already marvel at how hard he works, how dedicated he is to getting better, and his outright love for the game.</p>
<p>“He’s got the smile on the face, the twinkle in the eye — but he’s a competitor. He’s a big-time competitor.”</p>
<p>And to think of where it all started, to where he is now, to where it all might go — it’s nothing short of astounding.</p>
<p>“My life really changed in the last three, four years,” Panarin said. “It’s good. Very good.”</p>

<h1> Rangers fueled by Chris Kreider’s career year: ‘Always been there for us’</h1>

<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 16, 2022 8:30pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 3:25pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>This just might be the year for Chris Kreider.</p>
<p>After fending off the Flyers’ lone power play in the most recent win, the Rangers have been perfect on the penalty kill in seven of their last nine games and 11 of their last 14.</p>
<h1> Gerard Gallant pushing all the right buttons for Rangers</h1>
<div> December 8, 2021 8:04pm <div> Updated <div> December 8, 2021 8:04pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>What once was a team that played not to make a mistake has become a team that competes with unwavering trust in its strengths and talent.</p>
<p>After the Rangers went down 2-1 in the first period of their eventual 6-2 victory over the Blackhawks on Tuesday night in Chicago, however, Gallant evidently felt his team needed a reminder.</p>
<p>Even after acknowledging he had to give the Rangers a bit of a push in between periods on Tuesday, Gallant still made a point to express his trust in his players.</p>
<p>“But I don’t got to say nothing really, they’re professional hockey players,” he said. “They know that we can do better than what we did in the first.”</p>
<p>While the Rangers continue to learn how to maintain the same compete level from puck drop until the end of regulation, the team has made strides in cleaning up its end-of-game play to close out opponents.</p>
<p>The Rangers have totaled nine goals in the third period in the last five contest, and, as play began Wednesday, had 30 goals in the final frame this season — tied for fourth in the league.</p>
<p>“At the start of the year, our third periods were the problem,” Mika Zibanejad said. “I think our third periods are starting to get a lot better. And that’s a good sign.”</p>
<h1> Bryce Aiken talks everything Seton Hall, ‘brother’ Kyrie Irving, Jersey Pride</h1>
<div> January 1, 2022 1:05pm <div> Updated <div> January 1, 2022 1:05pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Senior Seton Hall guard Bryce Aiken takes a shot at some QA with Post columnist Steve Serby:</p>
<p>Q: When you hear Jersey Pride, what does that mean to you?</p>
<p>Q: How would you compare New Jersey guards with New York City guards?</p>
<p>A: New Jersey guards definitely got more game (laugh).</p>
<p>Q: You’re gonna piss off a lot of New York City guards, I hope you realize that.</p>
<p>A: (Laugh) All respect to ’em, but New Jersey guards got more game.</p>
<p>Q: What do you like best about this Seton Hall team?</p>
<p>Q: You think this team is capable of winning a championship?</p>
<p>A: Nah, I don’t think that — I know that.</p>
<p>Q: How does visualization help you?</p>
<p>Q: Do you visualize cutting down the nets on the last Monday night of the season?</p>
<p>A: Nah, but I visualize (chuckle) me smiling. Which means I won the game.</p>
<p>Q: From your Twitter: “Nobody changed the world by listening to what the rest of the world was telling them to do.”</p>
<p>Q: “It you want to look good in front of thousands, you have to outwork thousands in front of nobody.”</p>
<p>Q: Your on-court mentality?</p>
<p>Q: Passionate and fearless?</p>
<p>A: You can’t play this game and be fearful in any way. That’s a limitation that you place on yourself. And I love the game. Once I get out there on the court, I don’t think, I just let the energy take me.</p>
<p>Q: Describe your style of play.</p>
<p>A: I pride myself on skill and finesse. I like to do a lot of moves, I do … just be creative out there on the floor and kinda express myself in the way that I feel on a given day.</p>
<p>Q: What did Kyrie Irving mean years ago when he said about you: “He has this old-school feel”?</p>
<p>A: He probably meant that I was just mature for my age. I played kinda beyond my ears and had an understanding of the game that most people didn’t have at that age.</p>
<p>Q: How do you explain the bond you’ve had with Kyrie?</p>
<p>A: Very simple. It’s my brother.</p>
<p>Q: In what way was he a mentor to you?</p>
<p>A: Every way, honestly. Just as any big brother would be.</p>
<p>Q: The best piece of advice he ever gave you.</p>
<p>Q: “Your limitations don’t exist in my world.”</p>
<p>A: There is no such thing as a limitation in the universe. As long as you walk with God all is possible.</p>
<p>Q: “Vision without execution is just a hallucination.”</p>
<p>A: A thought or an idea can just remain a thought or an idea in your head. Millions and millions of people in history probably had tremendous thoughts but they just never acted on it. At some point you just gotta take a chance and run with it.</p>
<p>Q: “If there isn’t a way then make one.”</p>
<p>A: Yup. There’s always a way. Like I said, limitations don’t exist. You just gotta find what works.</p>
<p>Q: “Continue to make noise until they can no longer ignore you.”</p>
<p>Q: Has there been one unfair criticism that bothered you?</p>
<p>Q: “The world is changed by your example, not your opinion.”</p>
<p>Q: The Big East conference?</p>
<p>A: Super-talented. Really, really deep this year. So it’s definitely a battle, and it’s fun. You get the best out of each other on a given day and you just gotta respect the game, respect competition, hats off to the other team.</p>
<p>Q: This Villanova team and why is Villanova a perennial power?</p>
<p>A: I’ve seen ’em play one or two times, they’re definitely a gritty team that likes to get after it, so that’ll be an exciting game.</p>
<p>Q: Harvard coach Tommy Amaker?</p>
<p>Q: Was your best moment at Harvard scoring 44 points against Columbia?</p>
<p>Q: The biggest obstacle or adversity you had to overcome?</p>
<p>Q: You can go one-on-one with any guard in NBA history.</p>
<p>Q: You can pick the brain of any guard in NBA history.</p>
<p>Q: What would you ask him?</p>
<p>A: I would just ask him of applying the discipline on a daily basis … really what his routine was, not to get on the court, but to prepare himself mentally to be at the level that he was day in and day out.</p>
<p>Q: How big a thrill was it for you meeting him in high school?</p>
<p>A: Oh my God, it was one of the best moments of my life.</p>
<p>A: I think of a lot of historic talent that has passed through that school, a lot of individuals that came before me that kind of paved the way, so super-thankful for them.</p>
<p>Q: The Eagles winning the Super Bowl?</p>
<p>A: I was excited for the organization. That was super dope to be able to witness them win that championship. My oldest brother is a big, big Eagles fan ever since we were young, so that’s where I got my fandom from.</p>
<p>A: Mansa Musa; Kobe Bryant; Michael Jackson.</p>
<p>A: “The 11 Laws of God” by Ra Un Nefer Amen.</p>
<p>A: It’s changed, I’m vegan now.</p>
<p>Q: How has it helped you?</p>
<p>A: Health is way better, energy level is a lot higher, a lot more clarity in the mind, it helps with focus, concentration, sleep.</p>
<p>Q: Why is Bryce Aiken not scared to be different?</p>
<p>Q: What do you mean oddly enough?</p>
<p>Q: Do you aspire to an NBA career?</p>
<p>A: Yeah, absolutely. It was always a dream of mine as a kid.</p>
<p>Q: Life after basketball?</p>
<p>A: Just want to help change the world. In whatever way that I’m called to do so.</p>
<p>Q: Why is that so important to you?</p>
<p>A: Because there’s a lot of change that needs to happen, and there’s a lot of growth that we can have as a human race. There’s a lot of division, and I just want to see people come together and love one another.</p>
<p>Q: One last Twitter quote: “Who are you going to be when it’s all over?” Who if Bryce Aiken going to be when it’s all over?</p>
<p>A: A creative genius, for the world to appreciate.</p>
<p>Q: Coming home to play for Seton Hall?</p>

<p>Q: Who dubbed you Joe Cool?</p>
<p>Q: But Joe Cool is a good nickname.</p>
<p>A: Yeah, it’s better than David W. Gibson (laugh).</p>
<p>Q: How would you describe your mentality on the field?</p>
<p>Q: Which one of the four was your sweetest Super Bowl win?</p>
<p>Q: That was the John Candy game.</p>
<p>A: He was standing on the sideline. I had met him a number of years before that. We had some private meetings ’cause he was trying to get me to go to Canada. … He owned the Argonauts for a while.</p>
<p>Q: Why was he on the visiting sideline?</p>
<p>A: I don’t know. I think he just had a field pass.</p>
<p>Q: What was the key to being clutch for you?</p>
<p>Q: How did that ’86 Giants defense compare to the ’85 Bears defense?</p>
<p>Q: When you think of Lawrence Taylor, what do you think of?</p>
<p>Q: Describe the Jim Burt hit that knocked you out of the game in a 49-3 loss to the Giants in the divisional round of the playoffs in the 1986 season.</p>
<p>Q: Describe he Leonard Marshall hit in a 15-13 NFC Championship game loss after the 1990 season, which essentially ended your 49ers career.</p>
<p>Q: How crushing was that loss? You were going for a threepeat.</p>
<p>A: We had some good battles with them, and it was tough sleddin’ as it was that day. … It was sad not to be able to go again with that team.</p>
<p>Q: How often over the years have you watched “The Catch” by Dwight Clark in the 28-27 NFC Championship win over the Cowboys on the way to your first Super Bowl?</p>
<p>Q: What amazes you most about Tom Brady?</p>
<p>A: That he’s still playing (laugh). He just makes a team better, obviously, and he’s been so consistent about the way he’s played over the years, I think that’s the most impressive thing about him.</p>
<p>Q: Can you imagine the hype over a Brady-Bill Belichick Super Bowl?</p>
<p>A: (Laugh) Yeah, it’s been crazy. I got a lot of noise from saying that I thought [Mac Jones] fit the 49er system. Not that I don’t think Trey [Lance] is qualified, I just thought that the other guy fit what the 49ers do in a system.</p>
<p>Q: Is Eli Manning a Hall of Famer?</p>
<p>A: I think he gets in, for sure. … The things that guys that are in ahead of him, he’s done more than most. I don’t see any reason why he doesn’t get in.</p>
<p>Q: Should Phil Simms be in?</p>
<p>Q: What do you think of Justin Herbert.</p>
<p>A: Big, strong, stands in there, he can make all the throws.</p>
<p>A: He’s got a lot of grit.</p>
<p>A: He’s fun to watch. You see someone like that come around every 40, 50 years (chuckle), whatever it might be. But he’s pretty special in the things that he can do.</p>
<p>Q: What made Jerry Rice great?</p>
<p>Q: How much tension or friction was there between you and Steve Young?</p>
<p>A: When you’re competing with someone, it doesn’t matter who it is … it’s hard enough getting yourself ready every week to try to help prepare somebody else at the same time.</p>
<p>Q: What do you think of the roughing the passer rule nowadays?</p>
<p>Q: If you could pick the brain of any quarterback in NFL history, who would it be?</p>
<p>Q: Could you have played for Lombardi?</p>
<p>Q: Could you have played for Bill Parcells?</p>
<p>Q: How do you think Simms would have done playing for Bill Walsh?</p>
<p>Q: Simms would have had success with Bill Walsh.</p>
<p>Q: Describe the chicken soup game at Notre Dame, the 1979 Cotton Bowl against Houston when you were the Comeback Kid.</p>
<p>Q: What is your biggest regret?</p>
<p>Q: You were happy with your “Cool Under Pressure” docuseries?</p>
<p>A: It was fun to do. Brings back good memories and bad memories (laugh), injuries and all those things.</p>
<p>Q: What is the biggest surprise viewers will have?</p>
<p>A: Two surprises. My kids’ stuff, when they talk about some of their memories, and I think the footage from when I was young.</p>
<p>A: Yeah, but I can’t tell ya (smile).</p>
<p>Q: What are you most proud of about your career?</p>

<div> January 14, 2022 10:28pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 10:30pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The NFL playoffs kick off Saturday afternoon with Raiders-Bengals, and Post columnist Steve Serby caught up with Las Vegas wide receiver Hunter Renfrow for some QA: </p>
<p>Q: Sum up Raiders interim head coach Rich Bisaccia. </p>
<p>Q: You guys would like to play for him next year? </p>
<p>A: Without a doubt. I think we need to get that narrative going more and more. </p>
<p>Q: What do you like best about this Cardiac Kids Raiders team? </p>
<p>Q: What makes Derek Carr tick? </p>
<p>Q: How would you describe his leadership style? </p>
<p>Q: Mad Maxx Crosby? </p>
<p>Q: What does your 103-catch season mean to you? </p>
<p>A: It’s cool to be mentioned with Darren and Tim Brown, and those guys, but for me, I could care less. That’s not why I play the game. </p>
<p>Q: What are you most proud of as a receiver? </p>
<p>Q: If I wanted to build the perfect receiver, what should I take from Hunter Renfrow? </p>
<p>Q: Why did you have to walk on at Clemson? </p>
<p>Q: Describe the feeling of catching that 2-yard TD pass from Deshaun Watson with one second left against Alabama that won Clemson the 2016 national championship. </p>
<p>Q: Were you the first read? </p>
<p>A: I was. It’s interesting, we ran that play for the first touchdown in the spring game that year. So it was the first touchdown and the last touchdown so it was pretty neat. </p>
<p>Q: Tell me about the doubters and how that motivates you. </p>
<p>Q: Can you give me an example of a time where you needed the motivation? </p>
<p>Q: Your on-field mentality? </p>
<p>A: My mentality is just to take what they give me. Don’t do too much. </p>
<p>Q: Do you study guys like Cooper Kupp and Davante Adams? </p>
<p>Q: If you can pick the brain of any receiver in NFL history? </p>
<p>A: Being a Raider, probably Freddie B [Biletnikoff]. I do get to ask him a lot of questions ’cause he’s at practice a lot. I’m kinda spoiled. </p>
<p>Q: If you can test your skills against any cornerback in history? </p>
<p>A: Probably no one good, ’cause I want to win (chuckle). Growing up, Darrelle Revis was the best. And Charles Woodson, being a Raider legend, would be pretty cool as well. </p>
<p>Q: Are you aware there were 16 receivers drafted ahead of you in 2019? </p>
<p>A: I was not. I knew there was a bunch. </p>
<p>Q: Do you track any of their careers? </p>
<p>Q: Deshaun Watson? </p>
<p>A: When I think of him, I think of just him being poised all the time and just laser-like focus when the game’s on the line. He got better as the game went. </p>
<p>Q: Trevor Lawrence? </p>
<p>Q: How good can he be? </p>
<p>Q: Tee Higgins, you’ll be facing him on Saturday. </p>
<p>Q: You played with Dexter Lawrence at Clemson. </p>
<p>A: Great guy, loves to compete, and really just a big teddy bear if you get to know him. </p>
<p>Q: Do you think you could have played Major League Baseball? </p>
<p>Q: What drives you? </p>
<p>A: Family. My daughter, my wife and then my brothers and sisters and extended family and all that. Everyone involved. </p>
<p>A: Probably Sammy Watkins. He went to Clemson, he was like my favorite receiver. He was just like a legend to me. </p>
<p>A: Raider fans are loyal. They don’t even know sometimes why they’re cheering, they’re so loyal. </p>
<p>Q: (Brewers outfielder) Hunter Renfroe the baseball player? </p>
<p>A: I’ll get some people tweeting at me and he’ll get some people tweeting at him whenever we have good games. That’s how we know our counterpart had done well. </p>
<p>Q: Three dinner guests? </p>
<p>A: Jesus Christ; George Washington; Alexander The Great. </p>
<p>Q: Favorite movie? </p>
<p>A: “The Patriot.” </p>
<p>Q: Favorite actor? </p>
<p>A: Chicken fingers and rice and gravy. </p>
<p>Q: What kind of atmosphere are you expecting in Cincinnati? </p>
<p>A: Cold (laugh). But it’s kinda like taking a test, you get so locked in that you don’t even realize what’s going on around you. </p>
<p>Q: How would you characterize the mindset of your team right now? </p>
<p>A: The mindset of our team is anything can happen. Let’s go win this week and then just take one week at a time. </p>

<p>Five-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro Steelers defensive tackle Cam Heyward takes a timeout for some playoff QA with Post columnist Steve Serby.</p>
<p>Q: What does it mean to be a Pittsburgh Steeler?</p>
<p>Q: Do you believe your late father is proud of you today?</p>
<p>Q: What was it about your father that made you so proud of him?</p>
<p>Q: Describe your on-field mentality.</p>
<p>A: I’m gonna give you 110 percent. I’m one of those people that I’m not gonna settle for anything less from others, but for me, I have to play with a lot of energy and I have to set the tone.</p>
<p>Q: If you could pick the brain of any defensive linemen in NFL history, who would it be?</p>
<p>A: Well, I already get to do this a little bit, I get to talk to “Mean” Joe [Greene] every now and then. I think that’s the ultimate defensive lineman. Besides him, I would say Reggie White.</p>
<p>Q: What is the best piece of advice Mean Joe ever gave you?</p>
<p>Q: Who is one quarterback in NFL history you wish you could have sacked?</p>
<p>Q: Why does Pittsburgh love Ben Roethlisberger right now?</p>
<p>Q: What makes T.J. Watt, T.J. Watt?</p>
<p>Q: What makes Mike Tomlin, Mike Tomlin?</p>
<p>A: His consistency in his message in the fact that he’s able to challenge players individually and collectively. He gets the most out of his group.</p>
<p>Q: Describe Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes.</p>
<p>Q: Describe former teammate Ryan Shazier.</p>
<p>Q: What was that moment like on the field when he suffered his spinal contusion four years ago?</p>
<p>A: It broke my heart. To see, really my brother, not able to get up, and laying there, it was one of those scenes I’ll never forget. But after that, to see him work, and tell me, “I’m gonna walk again,” was pretty special.</p>
<p>Q: Former Jets and now Buccaneers nose tackle Steve McLendon?</p>
<p>A: Underrated, but great locker room guy.</p>
<p>Q: Former Steelers linebacker James Harrison?</p>
<p>Q: What was Antonio Brown like as a teammate?</p>
<p>A: You know, I didn’t have a lot of problems with Antonio Brown. It’s unfortunate the way it ended here in Pittsburgh. I would have loved for him to remain a Pittsburgh Steeler all those years ago.</p>
<p>Q: How about Le’Veon Bell?</p>
<p>A: Same thing. Those guys were great players for us. Won us a lot of games, and are Steeler greats because when they stepped on the field, there was probably nobody stopping those two.</p>
<p>Q: You’ve had asthma since childhood.</p>
<p>Q: Describe your grandmother.</p>
<p>A: She’s awesome. She lives right in the city of Pittsburgh. She was a Steeler fan before I was a Steeler, and she’s been sending me Steeler stuff since I was a little kid. But she was a teacher here, and I love her to death.</p>
<p>Q: How good a basketball player were you?</p>
<p>A: I loved basketball growing up. I was gonna play in college [Ohio State] until we made it to the national championship my freshman year, and then I was exhausted after that, so I completely shut that down after that.</p>
<p>Q: What’s meant more to you: the Pro Bowl or the Walter Payton Man of the Year award?</p>
<p>Q: How long do you want to play?</p>
<p>A: As long as my body stays healthy, and I’m able to play at a high level, I think I can play a lot longer.</p>
<p>A: LeBron [James], Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, my dad.</p>
<p>A: “Heavyweights” with Ben Stiller, “Cinderella Man.”</p>
<p>Q: Favorite singer/entertainer?</p>
<p>Q: Why do Steelers fans travel so well?</p>
<p>Q: How pumped up is your 6-year-old son Callen for this game?</p>
<p>Q: What did you make of Roethlisberger saying, “We have no chance?”</p>
<p>A: I think he was referring to we’re perceived as having no chance. And the way we see it as, no one’s giving us a shot, but we’re gonna come ready to play.</p>
<p>Q: What would be your message to Steelers Nation?</p>
<p>A: Be loud. And we’re gonna give it all we got.</p>

<p>New York state lawmakers have tentatively agreed to extend Mayor de Blasio’s authority to oversee the New York public school system for the remainder of his term in office, sources said Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Under the deal, mayoral control will be renewed through June of 2022. De Blasio’s term ends at the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The three-year extension is a boost for de Blasio, who previously had to keep coming back to Albany every year for one or two-year renewals when hostile Republicans controlled the state Senate.</p>
<p>Now more friendly Democrats control both houses of the Legislature — the Senate and Assembly — and Gov. Cuomo backs the extension.</p>
<p>“We will continue mayoral control for the next three years,” said Assembly Education Committee Chairman Mike Benedetto (D-Bronx).</p>
<p>There will be tweaks to the law to encourage more parental involvement, he said.</p>
<p>Benedetto said the mayor would be required to appoint at least one more parent to the 13-member panel for educational policy. The mayor will continue to make a majority of appointments to the policy board.</p>
<p>The mayor also will be required to give ten days notification before removing any member from the policy board, he said.</p>
<p>Assemblyman Felix Ortiz (D-Brooklyn) said the amended law is a “win-win” that will hold the mayor accountable, “especially for any misstep on part of the chancellor.”</p>
<p>Ortiz said the mayor made a convincing case for renewal while lobbying in Albany on Tuesday.</p>
<p>John Liu, who chairs the Senate’s New York City education panel, said a mayoral school control deal is in the works for inclusion in the state budget to be adopted April 1.</p>
<p>“Extension of mayoral control must and will come with greatly expanded input from public school parents,” Liu said in a statement.</p>
<p>The state Legislature abolished the much-maligned, often divided old Board of Education in 2002 and instituted a system of mayoral control under Mike Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Under mayoral control, the Department of Education is overseen by City Hall like any other agency. The mayor appoints the schools chancellor.</p>
<p>The mayor also appoints eight of the 13 members of the policy board, giving him sway over education policy. The appointees serve at his pleasure.</p>
<p>Mayoral control gave both Bloomberg and de Blasio the authority to make major changes — some controversial.</p>

<h1> De Blasio gets 2-year extension of mayoral control</h1>

<p>It took a special session of the state legislature and two extra days of meetings , but Mayor de Blasio finally got an extension of mayoral control of the city’s schools.</p>
<p>And it was for two years, meaning he won’t have to implore Albany for another extension in 2018.</p>
<p>The state Senate voted 48-2 Thursday afternoon to approve the extension — more than 12 hours after the Assembly voted for it in a pre-midnight session.</p>
<p>Gov. Cuomo quickly signed it to beat the midnight Friday deadline when the mayor’s authority over the school system would have expired.</p>
<p>While the state budget provided additional aid to charters, a bill that would have lifted the cap on their number died in the Assembly.</p>
<p>GOP Sen. Terrence Murphy was one of two votes against the extender, saying he had issues with de Blasio’s lack of transparency.</p>
<p>“I didn’t want to give him one year, let alone two,” said Murphy, who represents the Hudson Valley.</p>
<p>He was one of the Republicans de Blasio tried to defeat in his 2014 effort to restore control of the body to the Democrats.</p>
