<h1> Why So Many People with Autism Have Eating Disorders </h1>
<h2> Approximately 20 percent of people with eating disorders have autism. </h2>

<li>Approximately 20 percent of people with eating disorders (EDs) may also have autism, research finds.</li>
<li>Issues like sensory processing, rigid thinking, peer pressure, and emotional regulation difficulties increase the risk of EDs.</li>
<li>Treatment options should consider how autism symptoms affect therapeutic interventions.</li>

<a>disordered eating</a>, including binging and purging. I was overfed by my mother from a young age and discovered that food calmed me down long before I started school. My
<a>emotional eating</a> became extreme binge eating by the age of 8. By the time I was a
<a>teenager</a>, I’d either be binging or following such restrictive eating regimes that eating has never, ever been a natural or worry-free activity.
<h3>Why Are People with Autism at Such High Risk of Developing Eating Disorders?</h3>
<p>1. <a>Emotional regulation</a> issues</p>
<sup>3</sup> Many people develop eating disorders as a coping mechanism for anxiety or difficulties with emotional expression and communication.

<p>Autism is characterised by intense levels of interest and focus on particular subjects, and developing an unhealthy obsession with food can fit with this general autistic profile.</p>

<h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities—Series Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Death—and its close relative, trauma—may trigger perceptions that subvert the normal bounds of space and time. The fascinating evidence merits serious investigation.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 12</a></h2> <p>A life-threatening emergency can, in some cases, produce a veritable distress signal that communicates what is being experienced, physiologically and/or emotionally.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 11</a></h2> <p>Some dreams can serve as a virtual x-ray, indicating what’s happening in the body. The process illustrates how life-threatening trauma may generate its own distress signals. </p> </div>
<h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 10</a></h2>
<p>It’s possible that searing trauma – experienced by humans or other creatures similarly endowed – produces effects that are simultaneously physical, emotional, and spiritual.</p>
<div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 9</a></h2> <p>The deeply felt nature of people-pet relations often manifests in anomalous reports. This may reflect the way other animals apprehend feelings and their emotional bond with people.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 8</a></h2> <p>Beyond the five senses we humans know, some of the sensory capacities more prominent in other creatures may be intimately connected with health, danger, and emotion generally.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 7</a></h2> <p>A person who is highly sensitive to her or his feelings—and to others’ feelings—is likely to be extra sensitive to her or his environment. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 6</a></h2>
<p>Many creatures are known to become agitated before natural disasters. Emotional information – warnings – may be what they’re able to derive through infrasound or other means. </p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 5</a></h2> <p>Elephants are able to detect and use infrasound, which radiates below the threshold of human hearing. Infrasound can travel vast distances unimpeded by land, air, or water.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 4</a></h2> <p>Orcas have a unique ability to ‘transmit’ a sense of who they are—and ‘probe’ the people they’re with.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 3</a></h2> <p>Dolphins and killer whales possess a seeming capability to read minds that human beings neither possess nor suspect.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 2</a></h2> <p>When elephants encounter their dead, they become quiet and tense.They also become agitated at the imminent death of a fellow. These behaviors are suggestive of mourning and grief.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Unimagined Sensitivities, Part 1</a></h2> <p>While it would seem to be the end of sensitivity, death actually conjures up an amazing range of accounts that are highly relevant to sensitivity, in humans and many other animals.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Living Closer to the Bone (Part 7)</a></h2> <p>Sentient creatures share a profound connection, with one another and with nature. The concept of soul can be understood in context of this innately felt connection with creation. </p> </div>
<h2><a>Living Closer to the Bone (Part 6)</a></h2>
<h2><a>Living Closer to the Bone (Part 5)</a></h2>
<div> <h2><a>Living Closer to the Bone (Part 4)</a></h2> <p>Some animals have truly distinctive personalities. The passing of one such pet created an enduring mystery while also hinting at the spiritual nature of emotion-laden family ties.</p> </div>

<a>gifted</a> children, people who are highly
<a>empathetic</a>, children with
<a>sensory processing disorder</a>, and at least some individuals with autism—are more likely than most to report anomalous perceptions.
<a>One study</a> was quite large, with nearly 800 participants.
<a>A second study</a> found self-reported anomalous experiences significantly higher among a ‘
<a>neurodiverse</a>’ group (primarily individuals with high-functioning autism) than a ‘neurotypical’ group.
<a>A third study</a> directly compared the extent of anomalous perceptions reported by individuals with high-functioning autism against a matched, non-
<a>autistic</a> group. Of the former, 41% said that their anomalous perceptions had been spontaneous and recurrent since
<a>fourth research team</a> went so far as to suggest that “anomalous perception may be experienced by the majority of high-functioning adults” on the autism spectrum.
<p>In my next post, we'll see how children with high-functioning autism may be primed to have even more puzzling perceptions. </p>

<h1> Can a Person With Autism Fall in Love? </h1>
<h2> People with autism can form deep, loving, lasting romantic connections. </h2>
<li>Widespread stereotypes suggest that people with autism are incapable of feeling romantic love. </li>
<li>In reality, people with autism can experience romantic love and often attach considerable value to their close relationships.</li>
<li>Difficulties in these relationships tend to involve an attachment to routines, social interaction challenges, and communication issues.</li>
<li>Relationship management strategies can help autistic people and their partners have fulfilling, loving relationships.</li>
<p>Can people with autism fall in love?</p>
<p>The worry that people with autism will find it difficult to either love someone or sustain a long-term relationship is usually based on the following reasons:</p>
<ul><li>empathy issues</li> <li>social issues</li> <li>routines and rigid thinking</li> <li>communication issues.</li> </ul>

<p>When someone with autism does find someone they want to be with, however, they might find it hard to be in a relationship–and their partner might find it difficult to accommodate some of their needs.</p>

<p>Relationships tend to be hard for most people. When autism is added into the mix, they can be even tougher.</p>

<p>Having a plan in place isn’t going to stop the meltdowns, but it can help mitigate the fallout and help autistic adults, and others, normalise those meltdowns that are a part of their autistic experience.</p>

<h1> Trust on the Spectrum </h1>
<h2> Autism affects how a person relates to others, which can make trusting hard. </h2>
<p>“All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust.” </p>
<p>“Trusting is hard. Knowing who to trust, even harder.” </p>
<a>Bullying</a>, harassment, and abuse are the reality of many
<a>autistic</a> people's lives; being different can be dangerous in a world that rewards
<a>conformity</a>. The health of people with ASD is generally poorer, the
<a>life expectancy</a> is lower, and
<a>suicide rates</a> are higher for ASD adults.
<a>education</a> can make functioning almost impossible.

<a>marriage</a>. One couple saw me because of communication problems, but much of it stemmed from the husband, who had traits of autism and
<a>ADHD</a> and constantly misread or missed his wife’s signals. He would go on and on about his work problems and not realize that her expression was pained or disapproving, sending the message, “I don’t care, I am
<a>bored</a> to tears with what you are saying.” She also got frustrated when he missed her messages. She would have a hard day and complain, but what she was saying was, “pay
<a>attention</a> to me.” This was too indirect for him.

<h1> High-Functioning Autism and Apparent Memories of Past Lives </h1>
<h2> Why might a grim end to someone's life be "remembered" by an autistic child? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Autism? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to help with autism</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>A 2018 study profiled three young children who claimed to have memories of a past life; later, they were diagnosed with high-functioning autism. </li>
<li>The odd physical characteristics these kids presented were consistent with their apparent recollections of this other life.</li>
<li>A violent or unnatural end to someone's life seems to figure prominently in the reports of many such children. </li>
<li>Several reasons have been proposed to explain why individuals with high-functioning autism report anomalous perceptions, versus others with ASD. </li>
<a>last post</a>, research is beginning to document children on the autism spectrum who report a range of intriguing perceptions. In 2018, a pair of Sri Lankan researchers
<a>memory</a> of being a monk who lived in a remote forest monastery. The other two kids presented their own symptoms of autism, specifically a
<a>fear</a> of loud noises, avoidance of eye contact, and repeated demands (in the girl’s case) to have her parents only buy her clothes, shoes, and toys that are red. All three kids shied away from social contact, a prime characteristic of autism.
<a>70 percent of these cases</a>, the life being remembered ended violently or unnaturally. Taking the Sri Lankan paper on face value, one might venture to suggest that autism itself—or at least the mild or high-functioning kind (previously known as
<a>Asperger</a>’s syndrome)—could have its source in past life trauma.

<h1> The Twice-Exceptional Adult </h1>
<h2> We often hear about "2e" children but what about adults? </h2>

<p>Dr. Peters: Why are more adults seeking understanding, and finding out they are twice-exceptional?</p>
<a>authenticity</a> and self-awareness. There is a greater acceptance of the diversity of what it means to be human. The greater acceptance of gay
<a>marriage</a> and the greater awareness of
<a>transgender</a> people's experiences are all a part of a shift toward authenticity. And the willingness of adults to acknowledge and explore their gifts and challenges is another indication of that shift toward authenticity.
<p>Many adults are not identified as kids because they are twice-exceptional (2E) and their gifts help overshadow the challenges. Some adults have “stealth dyslexia” which often goes undiagnosed with standardized tests.</p>
<p>Dr. Peters: How has awareness around twice-exceptionality changed in our social landscapes?</p>
<a>Parenthood</a> gave us a glimpse into the lives of an adult and a
<a>teenager</a> on the autism spectrum. The boy had been diagnosed with
<a>Asperger</a>’s Syndrome (high functioning autism), and the adult saw himself in the boy, which led him to seek out his own diagnosis.

<a>bullying</a> and caused him to be labeled as lazy, Spielberg also credits dyslexia with forcing him to slow down and re-read scripts so that he ends up with an ever greater understanding of the direction he’ll take the story.
<p>Dr. Peters: What symptoms or life issues usually prompt an adult to seek diagnoses, when older, to problems they have struggled with lifelong?</p>
<a>executive functioning</a> skills such as organization, focus,
<p>A sense of <a>loneliness</a>, or the inability to develop and maintain significant social relationships, might prompt adults to see what role Asperger’s Syndrome or other challenges might play in their lives.</p>
<p>Dr. Peters: How does a diagnosis of a 2e condition as an adult affect their personal and professional life and what do they need to know?</p>
<p>Dr. Peters: What do you suggest to an adult who feels they may be on the spectrum or have another learning disability?</p>

<p>What makes autism unique?</p>
<a>neurodiversity</a> and a "cure" makes me think this is something worth talking about.
<p>The "High Functioning" <a>autistic</a> group says, "We don't need to be cured. We just need tolerance and understanding."</p>
<p>The Highly Impaired group says, "Enough with the understanding! We need some cures, fast!"</p>
<p>Parents of affected kids say, "I want my kid to have a good life, whatever that means or takes."</p>
<p>And then there's the conflict with the parents. They say, "My kid has this terrible condition," and high functioning adults see that as an indictment of themselves. After all, they live with the so-called "terrible condition" every day.</p>
<p>What can we do to resolve this strife? I have a fairly simple solution.</p>
<p>First, stop talking about a "cure for autism," and "getting rid of autism."</p>
<p>Second, talk about finding fixes for specific components of autistic disability, like speech impairment.</p>
<p>It seems to me that one change in focus could go a long way to resolve the controversy.</p>

<p>Can today's autism advocacy groups embrace this concept? Time will tell.</p>

<li>Why should I spend half a day on an autism study? There’s nothing wrong with me.</li>
<li>I’m not going to let you evaluate me and tell me there’s something wrong. I’m fine.</li>
<li>If I let you evaluate me, who knows how the data will be used against me. No way.</li>
<li>You have no right to ask me to do anything.</li>
<p>Outside of the autism community, the enthusiasm for a project like this appears to be near zero.</p>

<h1> The Latest Evidence on Autism Diagnoses and Treatment </h1>

<p>Last month, the American Academy of Pediatrics published <a>a new clinical report</a> on autism spectrum disorders that summarizes the body of evidence that has developed over the past 12 years.</p>
<p>The first notable fact in the report is that autism rates continue to rise: About one in every 59 children in the U.S. is diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder, up from one in 88 children just eight years ago.</p>
<a>regression</a> in language or social skills – that is, they lose abilities they once had learned – when they are between 18 and 24 months old, according to the report. Researchers don’t understand why this occurs.
<p>Some of the most effective interventions, the report finds, address specific autism behaviors and identifies triggers for them.</p>
<a>attention</a> to medical conditions that often occur with autism spectrum disorders but can be treated separately, such as
<a>attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</a>, intellectual disabilities, sleep problems, seizures, and
<a>anxiety</a>. The evidence shows that when caregivers and medical professionals can address these other problems, it can improve children’s overall ability to function and quality of life.
<p>The take-home message: The medical community is learning more about autism and how to best diagnose, treat, and support people with autism spectrum disorders.</p>
