<h1>Celebrities who served in the military</h1>
<h2>Stars like Pat Sajak, Jimi Hendrix and Hugh Hefner served for a time</h2>
<p>It's Veterans Day, which means it's time to honor those who have served in the <a>military</a>.</p>
<p>It may not seem like a natural shift in careers, but there are actually many <a>famous faces</a> who have served in the military over the years.</p>
<p>Many of their experiences vary, and they have served across various branches and at different times in their lives.</p>
<p>From musicians to actors and beyond, here are nine stars who served their country:</p>

<p>Adam Driver is among the stars to have served their country, though his experiences may not have been very helpful in preparing to appear in "Star Wars."</p>
<p>He enlisted after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but was medically discharged after a biking accident before ever being sent to war, according to <a>GQ</a>.</p>

<p>"I took to it immediately when I arrived there," he previously told Interview. "I did three years, eight months, and ten days in all, but it took me a year and a half to get disabused of my romantic notions about it."</p>

<h1>Former soldier flies solo with adaptive paragliding program</h1>
<h2>Project Airtime is free for everyone</h2>
<h4><a>Utah-based non profit offers paragliding free of charge for those who 'need a lift' </a></h4>
<p>Project Airtime offers free paragliding sessions to anyone from individuals with special needs, people suffering with illnesses, and those who are wheelchair-bound to veterans free of charge.</p>
<p>A former <a>soldier</a> left paralyzed from a skydiving accident last year is one of a handful of people who have learned to paraglide on their own with Project Airtime. </p>
<p>Before being introduced to the Utah-based <a>adaptive paragliding program,</a> Brenden Doyle had spent about nine years in the U.S. Army. </p>
<p>In January 2020, he was left paralyzed from the waist down after a landing accident. Seven months later, he started flying with Chris Santacroce and his team, who have spent the last six years helping a range of individuals reach new heights. </p>
<div> <div><p> Brenden Doyle trains to paraglide on his own with Project Airtime (Nicole Mickelson)</p></div></div>
<p>The nonprofit takes individuals with special needs, people with brain and spinal cord injuries or other illnesses, their caregivers, the elderly and veterans paragliding for free. </p>
<p>Santacroce told FOX News that they are looking for anyone who just "needs a boost" or is willing to "rise to the occasion." </p>
<p>At the beginning of his journey with the nonprofit, Doyle started flying tandem, as most Project Airtime participants do. But Doyle didn't just want to sit along for the ride. He wanted more. </p>
<p>"When I got injured, a lot of my independence was stripped from me. To be able to do the things I love myself is way better than just being along for the ride," Doyle told Fox News. </p>
<p>Typically, a pilot and passenger get strapped in and fly for roughly 20 to 30 minutes "depending on how much fun they're having," Santacroce said, adding that "some people are quite happy to go for 15 minutes." </p>
<p>He's even had a handful of participants – like Doyle – that have gone on to fly solo over the years. </p>
<p>Santacroce created the program six years ago, but he's been a full-time paragliding professional for nearly three decades. For 13 years, he was also a Red Bull athlete where he showcased free-flying sports. </p>
<p>OFF-DUTY CALIFORNIA COP SAVES CHOKING BABY ON WAY HOME FROM MOVIE THEATER</p>
<p>Over 10 years ago, Santacroce injured his spinal cord while attempting one of his tricks, landing him in a wheelchair for a couple of weeks. </p>
<div> <div><p> Project Airtime, a adaptive paragliding program, offers free flying sessions to dozens of people in Salt Lake City, Utah. (Nicole Mickelson)</p></div></div>
<p>"I always did this trick where you sort of drag your wingtip on the ground and then straighten up and land," he said. "And one day I just was out flying [and] I got it wrong." </p>
<p>Spending time in the wheelchair changed his perspective on life. </p>
<p>In light of getting a "second chance," he recalled asking himself one very important question: "What am I supposed to be doing with my life?" </p>
<p>"The answer was quite clear," he said. </p>
<p>When Santacroce isn't running Super Fly paragliding, which offers equipment sales, paragliding lessons, tours and clinics, he dedicates his time to Project Airtime, reminding those, that no matter what, they can still "have a radical experience." </p>
<div> <div><p> Project Airtime, a adaptive paragliding program, offers free flying sessions to dozens of people in Salt Lake City, Utah. </p></div></div>
<p>They also have chairs around the country, in Seattle; Bend, Oregon; and Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>Santacroce says it's the best thing he has ever done. For his participants, however, it means infinitely more. </p>
<p>They "just want to have freedom and they want to be able to pursue this stuff and not be at a disadvantage," Santacroce said. </p>
<p>And when they're in the air, "they're at zero disadvantage compared to the next guy," he added. </p>
<p>In fact, it can even feel liberating for those who spend much of their time in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>"They get to leave that chair at least behind. And that doesn't happen very often," he said. "So they find themselves quite at ease and they find themselves in the grips of a brand new experience." </p>
<p>For a lot of people, "they tend to forget their disability altogether," he added. </p>

<h1>The history of Santa Claus, his red suit and stand-out pop culture moments</h1>
<h2>From Coca Cola to 'Miracle on 34th Street' and that iconic MM's commercial, it's safe to say Santa has made his mark</h2>

<p>You might know <a>Santa Claus</a> lives in the North Pole with Mrs. Claus and a team of reindeer and elves, but do you actually know where this legendary <a>Christmas</a> character comes from?</p>
<p>Historians believe the lore of Jolly Old Saint Nick actually began with Saint Nicholas, an early Christian bishop who’s said to have been generous and kind toward <a>children</a> in 3rd and 4th century <a>Myra</a>.</p>
<p><a>HOW BIG IS SANTA CLAUS? HERE’S HOW TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR KIDS</a></p>
<div><p> Historians believe the lore of Jolly Old Saint Nick actually began with Saint Nicholas, an early Christian bishop who’s said to have been generous and kind toward children in 3rd and 4th century Myra (modern-day Turkey). (iStock)</p></div>
<p>The Saga of Saint Nicholas made its way to the U.S. and it eventually received national attention in the late 1700s with the influx of Dutch immigrants in New York.</p>
<p>By the early 19th century, American merchants, artists and writers began to move away from the historic saint in favor of fantastical tales.</p>
<p>SANTA MAKES MONEY AND MAGIC AT THE MALL </p>
<div><p> Saint Nicholas reportedly wore red robes while he lived a life of piety. Historians theorize that these red robes contributed to the evolution of Santa, whose name comes from the Dutch nickname for Sint Nikolaas –Sinter Klass. (iStock)</p></div>
<p>The <a>New York Public Library</a> credits John Pintard, Washington Irving, Clement Clarke Moore and Thomas Nast for transforming the beloved saint’s tall and slim image to the stout and jolly Christmas character the world recognizes today.</p>
<p><a>PHOTOS OF KIDS ON THE PHONE WITH SANTA, 1947</a></p>
<div> <div><p> Washington Irving and Clement Clarke Moore both wrote of a gift-giving Saint Nicholas. The fictional character eventually evolved into the Santa Claus character the world knows today. (iStock)</p></div></div>
<p>Nast’s most famous Santa portrait was created in 1881 and is titled "Merry Old Santa Claus." The drawing shows a rosy-cheeked and white-haired Santa holding a pipe and an armful of toys along with a sack, pocket watch and mistletoe.</p>

<p>Subsequent depictions in the U.S. have rarely deviated from Nast’s drawings. If you don’t believe us, take a look at a few of Santa’s stand-out pop culture moments, and you be the judge.</p>

<p><a>Tesla Inc</a>. is restricting access to the games available in its vehicles, disabling a feature that allowed people to <a>play games </a>on a front touch screen while driving, according to the top U.S. auto safety regulator.</p>
<p><a><u>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</u></a></p>
<p>The reversal comes after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, concerned about possible driver distraction,<a> launched an investigation into the feature</a> earlier this week.</p>
<p>For roughly a year, people have been able to play games on the front touch screen of some Teslas while the vehicles were in motion, the agency said. Previously, people were only able to do so while parked, according to NHTSA.</p>

<p>NHTSA has said it received a consumer complaint about Tesla’s in-car gaming earlier this year. The agency said it isn’t aware of any crashes or injuries linked to the feature.</p>

<a>Moscow</a> court on Friday slapped
<a>Google</a> with a nearly $100 million fine and also fined
<a>Facebook’s</a> parent company Meta $27 million over their failure to delete content banned by local law, as Russia seeks to step up pressure on
<p>The Tagansky District Court ruled that Google repeatedly neglected to remove the banned content, and ordered the company to pay an administrative fine of about 7.2 billion rubles (about $98.4 million).</p>
<p>Google said it would study the court documents before deciding on its next steps.</p>
<p>Later Friday, the court also slapped a fine of nearly 2 billion rubles ($27.2 million) on Meta for failure to remove banned content.</p>
<p>Russian courts had previously imposed smaller fines on Google, Facebook and Twitter this year, and Friday's rulings marked the first time the size of the fine was calculated based on revenue.</p>
<p><a>HERE'S WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN GOOGLE, FACEBOOK AND AUSTRALIA</a></p>
<p>The agency said that Facebook and Instagram have failed to remove 2,000 items despite the courts’ requests to do so, while Google has failed to delete 2,600 such items.</p>
<p>It warned that they may face more revenue-based fines for failure to delete the banned content.</p>
<p>Russian authorities have steadily ramped up pressure on social media platforms, accusing them of failing to purge content related to drug abuse, weapons and explosives and extremist views.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, authorities criticized tech companies for not deleting announcements about unsanctioned protests in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.</p>

<p>Struggling with grief? Too much debt? On the verge of divorce? <a>Churches</a> are ready to deliver a digital intervention, with help from Big Data.</p>

<a>Google</a> ads linked to particular search terms, such as around loneliness. People can submit their name and contact information through the pages, and Gloo passes on the details.
<p>More than 30,000 churches have signed up for its platform, Gloo said. The company said that accounts for about 10% of U.S. churches. Clients include free and premium users, and the average premium customer pays $1,500 a year.</p>

<p>For some churches, the online ads are part of an effort to keep their congregations going, with the pandemic accelerating years of falling attendance.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of people who are in pain and isolated," Mr. Frazee said. "If you don’t come to church, the church will come to you."</p>
<p>Gloo said it was started with a moral imperative to give churches access to the same kind of data and technology used by major corporations.</p>
<a>California</a> and other state privacy laws and the privacy policies of companies like Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google.

<p>Once they enter their information, Gloo’s platform pairs the user with a local church client. Gloo said it selects the church based on proximity, the programs offered by the church and capacity.</p>

<h1>Elizabeth Holmes trial: Jury to begin second week of deliberations in case against embattled Theranos founder</h1>
<h2>Holmes is charged with 11 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy</h2>
<p>The California jury weighing the fate of embattled <a>Theranos</a> founder <a>Elizabeth Holmes</a> will return on Monday from a brief holiday break to begin its second week of deliberations in a trial that has captivated Silicon Valley. </p>
<p>Holmes, 37, faces 11 <a><u>criminal</u></a> charges alleging that she duped investors and patients by hailing her company’s blood-testing <a><u>technology</u></a> as a medical breakthrough when in fact it was prone to wild errors.</p>
<p><a>JURY IN ELIZABETH HOLMES TRIAL HEARS REPLAY OF HER BOASTS</a></p>
<p>The jury, made up of eight men and four women, has been meeting in a San Jose, California, federal courthouse to mull Holmes’ fate based on the reams of evidence showcased during the high-profile fraud trial.</p>

<p>ELIZABETH HOLMES' JURY UNSUCCESSFULLY TRIES TO STUDY AT HOME</p>
<p>Holmes spent <a>seven days on the witness stand </a>acknowledging she made some mistakes and decisions she regretted while staunchly maintaining that she never stopped believing Theranos was on the verge of revolutionizing health care.</p>
<p>For years, Holmes promised Theranos would be able to scan for hundreds of diseases and other health problems with just a few drops of blood taken with a finger prick instead of relying on vials of blood drawn from a vein.</p>

<p>It was such a compelling concept that Theranos raised more than $900 million and struck partnerships with major retailers Walgreens and Safeway. Holmes herself became the subject of cover stories on business magazines.</p>
<p>But unknown to most people outside Theranos, the company’s blood-testing technology was flawed, often producing inaccurate results that could have endangered the lives of patients.</p>
<p>After the flaws were exposed in 2015 and 2016, Theranos eventually collapsed and the Justice Department filed a criminal case in 2018 that charged Holmes with 11 felony counts of fraud and conspiracy.</p>
<p>If convicted, Holmes could face up to 20 years in federal prison.</p>

<p>The jurors have provided few clues about how their deliberations have been going so far. During their first week discussing the case, they sent two notes to U.S. District Judge Edward Davila.</p>
<p>Their first asked if they could take home the jury instructions to review them, a request that Davila swiftly rejected.</p>
<p>After listening to the recordings again on Thursday, the jurors left the courtroom without returning Holmes' gaze from across the courtroom.</p>
