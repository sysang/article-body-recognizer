<li>Introverts are less likely to talk just for the sake of talking, but speak when they believe they have something significant to say.</li>

<p>The most effective approach is to ignore the behavior and pretend you don't notice it. If it doesn't appear to affect you, there is not much in it for them, and they may stop the behavior because of your lack of a reaction.</p>
<p>When ignoring passive-aggressive behavior is not feasible, perhaps because it strongly affects you psychologically, the best you can do is to maintain distance from the person as much as possible.</p>

<a>Big Five</a> can be assessed using a number of different questionnaires. Still, scientifically validated personality tests tend to have some features in common.
<a>as short as 10</a> items and as long as a couple of hundred (longer tests tend to provide more reliable results), and the items can be single adjectives or full statements about one’s nature.
<p>For example, the second version of the Big Five Inventory includes the following statements, along with several dozen others, each of which is used to assess one of the Big Five traits:</p>
<li>Is complex, a deep thinker. (<a>openness</a>)</li>
<li>Is reliable, can always be counted on. (<a>conscientiousness</a>)</li>
<li>Is talkative. (<a>extroversion</a>)</li>
<li>Is compassionate, has a soft heart. (<a>agreeableness</a>)</li>
<li>Keeps their emotions under control. (<a>emotional stability/neuroticism</a>)</li>

<p>Traits are the building blocks of personality. So what is a trait? In short, it’s a relatively stable way of thinking and behaving that can be used to describe a person and compare and contrast that person with others. </p>
<h2> The Big Five Personality Traits </h2>
<a>Big Five Personality Traits</a>.
<div> <h3> What is openness? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is conscientiousness? </h3> </div>
<a>Conscientiousness</a> is a person’s tendency to control impulses and act responsibly and productively. It may be reflected in a person’s preference for keeping things in order, dependability at work, or punctuality.
<a>Grit</a>, a much-talked-about trait concept involving steady persistence toward a goal, is related to conscientiousness.
<div> <h3> What is extroversion? </h3> </div>
<a>Introversion</a> is the opposite of extroversion. (
<a>Shyness</a>, not included in the Big Five, is similar, but not the same as introversion.)
<div> <h3> What is agreeableness? </h3> </div>
<p><a>Agreeableness</a> is a person’s degree of positivity and helpfulness toward other people. Facets of agreeableness include one’s respectfulness toward others, compassion, <a>altruism</a>, and tendency to trust others.</p>
<div> <h3> What is neuroticism? </h3> </div>
<h2> HEXACO and Honesty-Humility </h2>
<p>For more on honesty-humility, see <a>HEXACO</a>.</p>
<p>For more, see <a>Dark Triad</a> and <a>Personality Disorders</a></p>
<div> <h3> What is narcissism? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p><a>Narcissism</a> is generally one’s sense of self-importance and entitlement relative to others. High narcissism may be reflected in attention-seeking or an excessive need for admiration.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is psychopathy? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p><a>Psychopathy</a> captures a lack of empathy, remorse, and impulse control, along with other specific facets. Someone who is highly psychopathic may tend to hurt others without feeling bad or taking responsibility.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is Machiavellianism? </h3> </div>
<p>Machiavellianism refers to a person’s tendency to treat others in a calculating way, including using manipulation in order to achieve goals. It is named after Niccolò Machiavell, the 16th-century author of the book The Prince.</p>
<div> As hard is it is to believe, there's an idea that people high in psychopathy have the redeeming quality of boldness, but new research suggests that they’re really just plain mean. </div>
