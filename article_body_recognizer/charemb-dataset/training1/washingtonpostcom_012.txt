<div><div><p><i>Paul A. Friedman is the founder and executive director of Safer Country, an Alexandria-based gun-violence prevention nonprofit working to keep guns out of unsafe hands.</i></p></div></div>
<a>Safer Country</a>, joined with Fairfax County Board of Supervisors Chair Jeffrey C. McKay (D), two other supervisors and the commonwealth’s attorney to
<a>announce a countywide red-flag law public awareness campaign</a>. The idea is to let people know they can prevent a gun tragedy by contacting law enforcement when they observe someone acting in a way that signifies real danger.
<a>thirty states</a> have a “stand your ground” law. Only 19 and D.C. have a version of a
<a>red-flag law</a>, also called an extreme risk order. Virginia became the 19th when it passed its red-flag law in early 2020. Since then, there have been 34 attempts to use the law in Fairfax County. In a county with
<a>1 million people</a>, it seems likely that not enough people know about a law that gives them the power to act.
<a>website</a> and a slogan Safer Country recommended: “Prevent a Gun Tragedy — Speak Up!”
<a>This law saves lives</a>. In one high-profile case,
<a>Fred Guttenberg</a>, whose daughter,
<a>Jaime</a>, was killed in the Feb. 14, 2018, mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.,
<a>told me</a>, “If red-flag laws had been in existence before [the shooting], my daughter would be alive today.” He also
<div><div><p>With red-flag laws, we can create a safer country, even if we have to work county by county. Let’s all wave that flag and save lives.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Micaela Edelson</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 2:37 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Micaela Edelson is an environmental writer based in Boulder, Colo., at the Oakley Art House residency.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>BOULDER COUNTY, Colo. — I woke to the wind singing against the southern window of the old farmhouse on Thursday last week. In the distance, horses were whinnying.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was 11:45 a.m. when the neighbor knocked on the door.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Did you see the smoke?” We had not. “I called the firefighters, and they’re on their way.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Within an hour, the fire seemed to slow down. The smoke was light gray again, flames no longer visible. We watched from the back door. Lunchtime entertainment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then, easy as breathing, the fire blew up again. Racing over the hill to the east. Neighbors were getting their horses to safety. We left too.</p></div></div>
<a>Marshall Fire</a> — the one visible from my backyard on Dec. 30, the one my neighbor reported and the one I thought had slowed within an hour — ravaged on.
<a>Salem, Ore.</a>, as blue skies succumbed to thick gray smoke that then turned dark crimson.
<a>Nine people were killed</a>, more than 1 million acres burned, more than 4,100 homes were lost, half a million evacuated. But, luckily, I sat safe in my living room, cursing the ash falling outside and lamenting a climate-fated future.
<div><div><p>The Marshall Fire felt different. Maybe because, from the porch, I could see the flames devouring familiar land. Maybe because a wildfire in winter is so <a>strange</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>missing</a> and feared dead in the Marshall Fire. Nearly 1,000 homes destroyed. My roommate’s workplace burned.
<div><p>We drove three miles in the opposite direction. Unsure about the fate of our quaint farmhouse. The property’s owner had conducted controlled burns during the summer to deprive a wildfire of fuel. Had that been protection enough?</p></div>
<div><div><p>After the adrenaline rush of packing, driving, phoning, warning, a kind of stupor sets in. Then comes the sad sense of the widespread destruction.</p></div></div>
<i>will</i> they fare? I could have lost my home, but I have a car I was able to pack with belongings, and I have a remote job that will allow me to continue working. Along with grief comes guilt.
<div><div><p>But ours still stands. Was it just luck, a trick of the wind? Maybe the summer burns had done their job. Would the house be safe next time?</p></div></div>
<p>Now it’s <a>snowing</a> in Boulder County. The white blankets the charred land — in places, it almost looks like Christmas. But the snow can’t hide the blackened ruins, can’t conceal the menace. Winter fire will come again.</p>

<div><div><p>Among the advisers who have testified are former chief of staff Marc Short and former press secretary Alyssa Farah. According to Axios, Short reportedly would not have done this without Pence’s direct approval.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As Axios reports, Pence’s advisers “have been particularly cooperative” as the committee focuses on what Trump “was doing during the more than three hours the Capitol was under attack.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Be that as it may, what makes this truly interesting is what the committee really wants to know from Pence and his confidantes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>First, let’s recall an underappreciated but important fact: As the violence raged, Pence <a>adamantly refused entreaties</a> by his security detail to be removed from the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<a>requested</a> from the National Archives all documents and communications regarding Pence’s “movements and protection” on that day, an apparent effort to shed light on that question (among other things).
<a>pressured at least one GOP senator</a> to keep seeking the delay
<i>while</i> the violence continued.
<a>meant to secure that delay</a>.
<div><div><p>That fizzled, and the pressure on Pence to secure that delay continued.</p></div></div>
<a>announced</a> that he would not go along with the scheme. A big question is whether, this having been established, Trump and his allies came to see the violence as an instrumental way of securing the delay that Pence had refused to execute.
<div><div><p>Hearing from Pence and his advisers on this point would be highly illuminating, to say the least.</p></div></div>
<a>has poked holes in this story</a>: Pence did apparently try to find a way to execute that scheme, even discussing it with former vice president Dan Quayle, before concluding he could not.

<a><h2>The brutal racial politics of the Indian Child Welfare Act</h2></a>
<p>The nation has abundant reasons to regret its mistreatment of Native Americans, but the cost of this law, in broken bodies and broken constitutional principles, has been exorbitant.</p>

<a><h2>In an acrimonious time, some welcome fresh attention to Socrates and the art of civilized arguing</h2></a>
<p>Socrates — and his method of civil arguing — deserves a fresh look as an acrimonious year ends.</p>
<a><h2>Farewell, 2021, year of weird speaking</h2></a>
<p>George Orwell wrote that “the great enemy of clear language is insincerity.” Today, the enemy of clarity is the scary sincerity of progressives who are politically inflamed about everything.</p>
<a><h2>National conservatives and racial identitarians have a common enemy: Individualism</h2></a>
<p>Here's why the nation's intellectual climate may undergo climate change of its own in 2022.</p>
<a><h2>The Supreme Court has a fresh chance to rein in police lawlessness</h2></a>
<p>Sixty million Americans live in the states covered by the two circuit courts that have turned a federal officer’s badge into a license for lawlessness.</p>
<a><h2>The malicious, historically illiterate 1619 Project keeps rolling on</h2></a>
<p>The project serves a progressive agenda to convince Americans that the nation will be built back better when it has been instructed to be ashamed of itself and is eager to discard its disreputable heritage.</p>
<a><h2>Build Back Better would make Biden’s annus horribilis even worse</h2></a>
<p>Two Democratic senators stand between the president and what could be the worst of his self-inflicted wounds.</p>
<a><h2>If Trump runs in 2024, he may find Chris Christie ready to rumble</h2></a>
<p>More than a smidgen of pugnacity might be needed by a Republican presidential candidate attempting to hold Donald Trump voters while winning back those repelled by him.</p>
<a><h2>The goodness of Bob Dole</h2></a>
<p>The melancholy dimension of his life was not that he failed to attain the presidency, for which he was not well-suited, but that in 1996 in quest of it, he left the Senate he loved and where he excelled.</p>
<a><h2>Democrats should temper their expensive enthusiasms with a clear-eyed look at the electorate</h2></a>
<p>Here are some data points about voters that the party's kamikaze caucus should ponder as it contemplates a (properly scored) $4 trillion-plus Build Back Better gusher amid rising inflation.</p>

<a><h2>Now showing, Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom star in ‘Reversal of Fortune: 2021’</h2></a>
<p>The two Californians and potential future presidential rivals have had a head-spinning past year. He's up and she's down. Here's why.</p>
<ul><li><a>Voices Across America</a></li></ul>
<a><h2>Los Angeles needs a new mayor who will pull it out of the muck of inept governance</h2></a>
<p>Elected officials are lining up for the job, but there may be an opening for a non-politician.</p>
<a><h2>After the embarrassing recall results, maybe now California Republicans will wise up</h2></a>
<p>Why does the GOP keep winning gubernatorial races in deep-blue Massachusetts but must resort to trying to use the side door to the governor's mansion in the Golden State?</p>
<a><h2>Whether Newsom wins or not, his political instability is on full display</h2></a>
<p>How does the California governor differ from San Francisco's sinking Millennium Tower? An enormous amount of money might stave off disaster.</p>
<a><h2>In gubernatorial debate, will California Republicans self-destruct?</h2></a>
<p>The shame is that, if not for the GOP’s intraparty sour grapes, California’s Sept. 14 election would be a good dry run for next year’s congressional elections.</p>
<a><h2>With his fortunes improving, while proposing spending a fortune, Newsom wants to speed up the recall</h2></a>
<p>The governor's polls are looking better, and his opposition isn't getting traction.</p>
<ul><li><a>Opinions</a></li></ul>
<a><h2>Why a California recall is unlikely to draw Schwarzenegger-level star power</h2></a>
<p>Caitlyn Jenner is planning to run, but politically-minded Matthew McConaughey and Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson are looking elsewhere.</p>
<a><h2>The conservative effort to oust Newsom could backfire </h2></a>
<p>The petition looks likely to succeed. But even if voters opt to dump the governor, his replacement could end up being an even more liberal Democrat.</p>
<a><h2>What Gavin Newsom could learn from Arnold Schwarzenegger </h2></a>
<p>The governor appears increasingly likely to face California voters in the fall. Here's how he can avoid seeing his career terminated.</p>
<a><h2>NBC’s ‘Mr. Mayor’ treats life in Los Angeles as a joke. The reality is deadly serious.</h2></a>
<p>Comedy is all about timing. And there’s nothing funny about the current state of Los Angeles.</p>
