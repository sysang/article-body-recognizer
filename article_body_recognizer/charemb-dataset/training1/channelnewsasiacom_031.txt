<h1> ‘No one wanted to employ me’: How women can return to the job market after a career gap </h1>
<div> <p>From coping with self-doubt to dealing with employer biases, CNA Women asks the experts about practical ways to re-enter the workforce if you’ve taken a work hiatus, whether it's maternity leave or a child-caring break.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sharon Salim </a> </div> </div>
<p>There are several reasons why women take a career break – and it isn't just working mums who do so to care for their kids.</p>
<p>Some women need to put their career on hold to take care of ageing or sick parents, and some want to pursue further education, said Sabrina Ho, the founder of Half The Sky, a career platform focused on women.</p>
<p>“Whatever the reason for taking a break, it can seem daunting for them to return to work after some time off because of internal and external perceptions about women who take career breaks,” said Ho.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> There are younger girls who are smarter than me. I look bad. I cannot do it. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>By internal perceptions, Ho is referring to how the women perceive themselves, such as their anxiety and self-doubt, and questioning whether they are still “up to par” with their skills or are “competitive enough” to return to work.</p>
<p>External perceptions include employer biases that these women might face in returning to work. For example, companies may want candidates with more recent work experience, said Ho.</p>
<p>CHALLENGES OF RETURNING TO WORK</p>
<p>This was what Shirley Woon, 55, experienced when she decided to return to work after taking a 16-year career gap to care for her children.</p>
<p>Woon told CNA Women that in trying to find a job after such an extended break, the “strongest emotions” she felt were fear and anxiety. </p>
<p>“I have lost touch. There are younger girls who are smarter than me. I look bad. I cannot do it. What would they think of me?” she recounted.</p>
<p>Woon left her full-time job to care for her son full-time in 2000, before her second child was born in 2004.</p>
<p>She then followed her husband to the US and Shanghai from 2008 to 2012 for his work assignments. Her kids were eight and four then. </p>
<p>The family returned to Singapore in late 2012 and that was when Woon decided she wanted to “live out the rest of her life” meaningfully. So at the age of 46, she enrolled in a master’s degree in counselling. </p>
<p>But her biggest challenge, she told CNA Women, was that “no one wanted to employ me”.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Because I had been home for so long, my CV was not updated. Self-confidence was low. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Woon described the two years that she was looking to re-enter the job market as “frightening”.</p>
<p>“Because I had been home for so long, my CV was not updated. Self-confidence was low,” she said. </p>
<p>Not wanting to give up, she started her own private counselling practice in 2016, and published her first book titled Bleeding Hearts last year, which looks at self-harm as a coping behaviour.</p>
<p>Today, Woon is a psychotherapist and the founder of The Blue Pencil, a counselling service focused on couples, young adults, children and families. </p>
<p>Her difficulties in getting a job after a career hiatus isn’t unheard of. </p>
<p>Forty per cent of the managers surveyed confessed that they were “generally wary” of hiring women of childbearing age.</p>
<p>The situation is similar in Asia.</p>
<p>According to a 2017 White Paper by recruitment agency Robert Walters Singapore, 65 per cent of women in Asia have taken a career break at some point in their lives. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Sometimes, women returning to work might even have to accept a lower salary. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>When it came to returning to the workplace, the women cited financial reasons (35 per cent), the desire to learn new skills (28 per cent) and lack of fulfillment by staying at home (18 per cent) as reasons. </p>
<p>However, the survey also found that 46 per cent of hiring managers in Asia had not employed any returning women in the previous year. </p>
<p>Said Helen Ng, the co-founder of recruitment firm Ansa Search: “From our years of experience in recruitment, we’ve seen that women going through a transition in their family lives often get the shorter end of the stick.</p>
<p>“For instance, they might be passed over for promotions or their bosses might assume that they are not up for a bigger job.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, women returning to work might even have to accept a lower salary as companies could assume that a request for “flexible hours” means that they will not be as committed to their jobs as they used to be,” said Ng.</p>
<p>‘I NEEDED A BREAK FROM THE KIDS’</p>
<p>This was how Michelle Choy, 46, felt after diving straight into becoming a full-time homemaker after she graduated with a degree in occupational therapy in 2000. </p>
<p>She fell pregnant in 1998 while studying for her university degree overseas, and got married after her first daughter was born. </p>
<p>The couple went on to have a second child before returning to Singapore in 2000. This led to her staying home for two years to care for her two daughters. </p>
<p>There was no social media then, she told CNA Women, so it was just staying home with the kids. </p>
<p>“After I had my third child in 2002, suddenly it became too much. I needed a break from the kids for my sanity,” said Choy, adding that being a stay-at-home mum was “very exhausting” and “isolating”.</p>
<p>A few months after her third child was born, she decided to look for a job. </p>
<p>STRUGGLING TO WORK FULL-TIME </p>
<p>Plus, she felt she needed to have more flexibility in her working hours.</p>
<p>This led to her opening her own slimming centre with her husband in the same year. </p>
<p>The business however, fell victim to SARS in 2003, which quickly depleted the couple’s finances – leaving them and their three young children “penniless”.</p>
<p>To support her family, Choy took on a range of part-time jobs, from being an insurance agent to baking 3D cakes. </p>
<p>She also went on to have three more children, and with a large brood aged one to nine years to care for, working full-time was just not possible. </p>
<p>While both Woon and Choy successfully founded companies of their own, both women pointed out their struggles in returning to the workplace after spending a significant number of years away from it.</p>
<p>ADJUSTING TO THE NEW ROLE OF MOTHERHOOD </p>
<p>Even if your career hiatus doesn’t stretch into years, taking a shorter break, such as maternity leave, may also have its challenges.</p>
<p>While those four months may seem like a short sabbatical and you’re more than ready to return to your job after, picking up right where you left off, the reality may not be that straightforward. </p>
<p>Women returning to work after maternity leave often feel a significant impact: Work has moved on since they were last in the office, and sometimes, new people may have joined the company or your team in your absence.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> You will find yourself with less time and energy to do the same jobs that you used to do. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Often, returning working mums have to deal with challenges at home too, as the family gets used to a new baby and new routines. </p>
<p>Sher-li Torrey, the founder of Mums@Work, told CNA Women that the focus for women returning from maternity leave is mainly finding the balance between the new role of motherhood and continuing to be an efficient employee.</p>
<p>She said some of the biggest challenges these women face include adjusting their personal expectations of what can (or cannot be done) at work. “You will find yourself with less time and energy to do the same jobs that you used to do,” said Torrey.</p>
<p>You will also need to adjust the expectations of your boss and co-workers. For example, motherhood may rob you of the time needed to socialise with your colleagues outside of work.</p>
<p>And working late nights may no longer be an option, Torrey added.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may even need to consider having alternative career paths that will not jeopardise bonding time with your children.</p>
<p>PRACTICAL STEPS TO RE-ENTER THE JOB MARKETIf you’re ready to return to the workplace,there are practical ways to increase your chances of getting job interviews. Experts recommend the following: </p>
<li>Consider part-time work to build your confidence. “Short-term assignments can often provide an excellent foot in to help you assimilate into the workforce, establishing a network and building connections,” said Ng of Ansa Search. </li>
<p>EXPLAINING YOUR CAREER GAP TO POTENTIAL EMPLOYERS </p>
<p>Women who take career breaks to focus on their families don’t intend to stop working for good – which is why it is hard for them to anticipate the difficulty of explaining a career break to a potential employer, said Ho.</p>
<p>“And it’s a shame how many women have to face the perception that caregiving is not a valuable asset – that it’s not a skill that should be acknowledged in a woman who longs to return to work,” she added.</p>
<p>So be honest with yourself – and your prospective employer, who are often able to pick up red flags from answers that don’t tally. </p>
<p>For instance, if you have taken a break to settle some personal matters, focus on your kids or accompany your husband for his work assignments overseas – just share that that was the case, advised Soh.</p>
<p>Ho added that it’s also good to share what you did, what you learned, and the challenges you faced while you were away from work. </p>
<p>“Employers look for a positive and confident mindset from women wanting to come back to work. Confidence suggests that they are willing to get back in the game and build on the gaps that may have grown,” explained Ho. </p>
<p>It’s almost like nailing your first date, said Ng from Ansa Search, as explaining your career break can “make or break” the deal.</p>
<p>“On a first date, we want to make a great first impression,” she said, adding that the same applies for people who have taken a career break. </p>
<p>Firstly, advised Torrey, don’t apologise for the break. Instead, focus on how you have spent time looking at that area of your life and how you are now ready to re-embark on your career path.</p>
<p>“Working mums are some of the most highly effective and productive individuals I’ve seen as they have to multi-task within the time that they have,” added Soh of Robert Walters Singapore. </p>
<p>Torrey said that although it will be hard to justify relevant skills to employers, you can highlight these: </p>
<li>Your attitude in wanting to learn, re-learn, change and adapt.</li>
<li>Your motivation in prioritising your career – you will be more motivated than before, compared to someone else at a different life stage.</li>
<li>Your maturity and stability: Employers appreciate workers above 40 years old for their self-awareness and maturity.</li>
<p>HOW TO TALK ABOUT REMUNERATION</p>
<p>Now that you’ve been offered a job, how do you make sure that you are accepting something that is aligned to what you want and need?</p>
<p>Look at the remuneration package along with your working hours so that you can still have time for your family. </p>
<p>“You don’t wish to price yourself out of the market and neither would you want to accept a lowball offer,” Ng added.</p>
<p>“Some returning women settle for less than satisfactory pay packages, in exchange for other competing factors – such as the workplace’s proximity to their homes, flexible hours and/or something that’s not too taxing,” she added.</p>
<p>Ng recommends that you begin with the end in mind, by looking for a recruiter to guide you through the interview process, which includes salary negotiations.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Working mums are some of the most highly effective and productive individuals I’ve seen as they have to multi-task within the time that they have. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>If you prefer to not work with a recruiter, you can still do your own research on, say, the company’s competitors and ask around to gather market intelligence in the field.</p>
<p>According to Ng, the best way to negotiate your offer is to do it verbally, over the phone or in person (not via email or WhatsApp). Prepare to substantiate your request with solid facts as well.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, remember to take a step back to reflect if it’s truly something that you’re happy with, suggested Ng.</p>
<p>“If it’s not in the ballpark you had in mind, don’t take no for an answer. Be bold in negotiating for a better package.”</p>
<p>“(But) do it with grace, humility and some common sense and you’d be surprised that some companies do have some leeway to improve their initial offer.”</p>

<h1> Gender equality at work: What Singapore companies are doing for women </h1>
<div> <p>Is my manager biased against me? Will I still get that long overdue promotion if I get pregnant? From job openings to moving up in your career, here’s what to look for when it comes to equal opportunities in the workplace.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sharon Salim </a> </div> </div>
<p>A colleague shared that when she was pregnant with her last child while at her former company, she debated how to tell her supervisor. It wasn’t a question of when to let her know but the best way to break the news. </p>
<p>So she booked an early morning meeting with her boss and said: “I have something to tell you. I’m pregnant. Again.” She was so overwhelmed with guilt that she broke down and cried.</p>
<p>That’s just one of many stories you hear whenever women gather to talk about work and motherhood. Being afraid to share pregnancy news with employers is not unheard of in Singapore.</p>
<h3><a>READ: The Big Read: Gender equality in Singapore remains elusive amid entrenched attitudes about women’s roles</a></h3>
<p>She was referring to her personal experience with a former supervisor who “sat her down” before her wedding and asked her to hold off pregnancy for the first two years of her marriage. </p>
<p>WHAT DOES A GENDER-INCLUSIVE WORKPLACE LOOK LIKE?</p>
<p>Time and time again, you hear women bemoaning the fact that leadership positions in their companies tend to be filled by men and that women’s voices are not heard enough in policy-making. </p>
<p>A gender-inclusive workplace is one that offers, among other things, equal opportunities in areas like job roles, where promotions are based on merit and where platforms exist to help encourage a diversity of voices. </p>
<a>its first nationwide study on the gender pay gap</a>, said that women earned 6 per cent less in 2018 compared to a male counterpart holding the same job in the same industry, and who had the same academic background and age.
<h3><a>READ: How women can deal with prejudice from other women at work (yes, it happens)</a></h3>
<p>When it comes to identifying “attractive” workplaces, most people are drawn to benefits ranging from comprehensive health insurance coverage to generous compensation packages. </p>
<p>Additionally, women also appreciate a family-friendly work culture that allows for flexi-work when needed, as well as awareness by line managers of unconscious biases in the workplace.</p>
<p>The mother of three wants to nurture a culture where women have equal opportunity to achieve their long-term potential in their career and still make a meaningful contribution at home.</p>
<p>Here are some areas that point to a company’s gender-inclusive policies. </p>
<p>IT EMPHASISES TRAINING AND MENTORSHIP </p>
<p>A company that makes upskilling its employees a priority, along with having a nurturing culture that focuses on mentorship would benefit women. </p>
<p>Mentorship programmes at consumer goods giant the Procter Gamble (PG) Singapore office involve men as allies to remove bias and help women progress in their careers.</p>
<a>raising the awareness of imposter syndrome</a>.
<p>IT PROVIDES A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR WOMEN TO SPEAK OUT </p>
<p>Women are too hard on themselves, said Joan Chan, Head of People Capability Delivery at Standard Chartered Singapore.</p>
<p>Chan, who coaches employees at the bank as well as in her personal capacity, told CNA Lifestyle about women employees who “felt discriminated against” when they came back from maternity leave or a long-term illness. </p>
<p>They grew worried when their line managers did not assign them more work, although it was because the supervisors themselves had wanted to give these women more time with their newborns.</p>
<p>According to Chan, having open communication with your line manager may help to remove pre-conceived perspectives that may not be true. Being positive is also beneficial – believe that there are good intentions behind every behaviour, Chan said. </p>
<p>“Women do not want their employers to have the misconception that being pregnant means it would affect our work capabilities,” shared Rena Teng, Head of Strategic Corporate Communication, Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore and ASEAN South Asia.</p>
<p>She told CNA Lifestyle: “I remember working the hardest when I was pregnant only because I didn’t want my team members to think that I was holding them back.”</p>
<h3><a>READ: 90 per cent of people are biased against women: New analysis on gender equality</a></h3>
<p>Geraldine Kor, Managing Director of South Asia and Country Managing Director Singapore at Telstra, said one of the ways her company fosters diversity of thought is to encourage and challenge employees to express alternative viewpoints. </p>
<p>“Irrespective of gender, we also recognise the importance of creating a safe and conducive environment to empower our employees to freely voice their opinions and challenge stereotypes,” Kor added.</p>
<p>IT IS SERIOUS ABOUT RETAINING TALENT FOR THE LONG-TERM </p>
<p>Standard Chartered Singapore launched a campaign in June aimed at creating greater awareness when it comes to mitigating unconscious biases, especially in hiring and talent development. </p>
<p>“Overcoming biases is not a one-time awareness exercise. It’s an ongoing journey and all of us need to continue to work at it,” says Standard Chartered Singapore’s Thng. </p>
<p>The company is also doing a full review of its global parental leave policies this year, Francis added. “We want to invest in the long-term careers of our female employees,” she said.</p>
<p>IT ALLOWS PARENTS TO SHARE THE WORKLOAD</p>
<p>PG has also put new family-friendly policies in place. Starting in January, secondary caregivers such as fathers can take up to eight weeks of shared parental leave over a period of 18 months. </p>
<p>Since 2019, British beverage company Diageo too, has provided progressive parental leave packages that apply to its Singapore office, offering 26 weeks of paid leave, regardless of the parent’s gender or status as a primary or secondary carer. </p>
<p>IT IS INTENTIONAL IN MAKING SURE WOMEN CAN BE IN LEADERSHIP ROLES</p>
<p>Across the offices in the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific, as well as Singapore, PG wants to have 50 per cent of its management teams filled by women by 2022. As of May this year, they have attained 48 per cent. </p>
<p>Similarly, Diageo is on track to hit its global target of having 50 per cent of its leadership roles filled by women, including in Singapore. It achieved a rate of 30 per cent in 2020. </p>
<p>Ensuring equal opportunities also starts when new staff are recruited. Revolut says its women employees already make up half of their new hires in Singapore while 60 per cent of the leadership team are women. </p>
<p>To ensure more women are represented at every level of the business, especially in leadership roles, the company is hoping to be more flexible in the recruiting process, such as allowing remote working for roles that are open globally. </p>
<p>Editor’s Note: This story has been edited to reflect clarifications from PG on their leave policies. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Thailand sends refugees back to Myanmar as clashes continue </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MAE SOT, Thailand: Thailand has sent over 600 Myanmar refugees who fled fighting between the military and ethnic rebels back across the border, according to a senior Thai official who said on Sunday (Dec 19) clashes were continuing.</p>
<p>Provincial Governor Somchai Kitcharoenrungroj had told Reuters in the afternoon: "More people are willing to go back as they are worried about their property there."</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson, urged Thailand not to rush refugees back to Myanmar.</p>
<p>"Everyone knows the Myanmar's military deliberately targets civilians with deadly force when it goes into the field, so it's no exaggeration to say these refugees are literally fleeing for their lives," Robertson said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Myanmar's military junta did not answer his phone on Sunday. The army denies targeting civilians.</p>
<p>The Aid Alliance Committee, a Thai-based Myanmar migrants group, said about 1,000 displaced people were camping along the Myanmar border at various points waiting to cross into Thailand.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, Reuters reporters had seen dozens of refugees who had been sheltering at a local Thai school being put into three trucks to be sent back across the frontier.</p>
<p>"I fled from Mae Htaw Talay. There was artillery falling into my neighbourhood," a refugee who asked not to be named said while standing in a truck about to leave for the border. "I walked across the water to this (Thailand) side."</p>
<p>Kitcharoenrungroj, the Tak province governor, said that 623 refugees had been sent back and 2,094 remained on the Thai side, adding that all would be returned if they were willing.</p>
<p>Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb 1, triggering protests and sporadic clashes in the countryside between anti-junta militia and the army.</p>
<p>Fresh fighting broke out last week between the Karen National Union (KNU), Myanmar's oldest rebel force, and the military, forcing thousands from Myanmar's Karen state to flee.</p>
<p>Some crossed the narrow river between Myanmar and Thailand in boats while others waded through chest-high waters while holding children.</p>
<div> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h5> Myanmar rebel group calls for no-fly zone to protect civilians </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Myanmar rebel group calls for no-fly zone to protect civilians </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MAE SOT, Thailand: Myanmar's oldest rebel force wants international help to establish a "no-fly zone" near the Thai border, after warning there was a danger of clashes with the army resulting in civilians being targeted by air strikes.</p>
<p>There has been an escalation in fighting recently between the army and the Karen National Union (KNU), prompting <a>thousands of people to seek refuge in Thailand</a>.</p>
<p>About 3,400 people have taken shelter in Thailand over recent days, Thai authorities said. Thousands more are stranded on the Myanmar side of the border, waiting to cross.</p>
<p>In a statement released this week, the KNU warned of a "high possibility" of military air strikes on civilians.</p>
<p>"These air strikes won't target military bases but civilian bases as in schools, hospitals, houses and villages," the head of the KNU's foreign affairs department, Saw Taw Nee, told Reuters, citing his experience from previous bouts of fighting.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Myanmar's military junta did not answer calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>The KNU urged the international community to identify a no-fly zone by seeking an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>Last month, the UN Security Council, in a rare statement that was agreed by its 15 members, expressed concern over violence across Myanmar and urged the military to exercise utmost restraint.</p>
<p>International efforts to end the conflict in Myanmar since a February coup have been limited to diplomatic initiatives and attempts to exert economic pressure through Western sanctions.</p>
<p>Since the military overthrew the civilian government led by Aung San Suu Kyi, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) has said that more than 1,300 people have been killed by the security forces.</p>
<p>The military has said the figures from AAPP, a monitoring group cited by the United Nations, are exaggerated.</p>
<p>The latest fighting had been triggered by the army's attempts to arrest people in the Lay Kay Kaw area, said Saw Taw Nee.</p>
<p>"They came and checked on the town which we allow. However, they didn't keep their promise and arrested people which we totally don't accept," he said.</p>
<p>The KNU said three of its fighters and 15 government soldiers had been killed in the clashes. Reuters could not independently verify the account.</p>

<h1> The Singapore tech guru teaching young girls how to engineer the future </h1>
<div> <p>CNA Lifestyle's National Day series pays tribute to the can-do spirit of Singapore women. In our second instalment, get to know Dr Ayesha Khanna, co-founder and CEO of ADDO AI.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tracy Lee </a> </div> </div>
<p>Earlier this year, the Singapore government rolled out a special work visa called Tech.Pass, with the aim of attracting 500 top talents in technology fields.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with Singapore’s education system that it can’t produce its own top tech talent, I asked Dr Ayesha Khanna, co-founder and CEO of artificial intelligence solutions firm and incubator ADDO Ai.</p>
<p>Singapore’s education system is excellent, the 47-year-old added, but “it needs to evolve”.</p>
<p>And the good news is, it is evolving. At all levels, kids are being given creative space and technical knowledge alongside mathematics and humanities subjects.</p>
<p>A GROUNDBREAKING FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR</p>
<p>She also co-founded the Hybrid Reality Institute, a research and advisory group established to analyse the social and economic impact of accelerating technologies.</p>
<p>She moved to Singapore in 2012 with her husband Parag, a geopolitical strategist and academic, and co-founded ADDO Ai in 2017, taking on the role of CEO.</p>
<p>In that same year, Forbes ranked it one of four leading artificial intelligence companies, and in 2018, named her one of Southeast Asia’s groundbreaking female entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>“At ADDO.ai, we build very large platforms for companies (to gather data). We organise this gold mine of data, and use machine learning then to help them automate and optimise their services.”</p>

<h3><a>READ: Kids and coding: Let's give our children control over their imagination</a></h3>
<p>“And the only way to be agile is to have most of your processes be digital, and to use data to understand what is happening to your business at every level ... and to be able to predict and forecast what will be needed and how to adapt to it.”</p>
<p>As for her charity, all the classes were moved online. Its Empower programme, which was previously available only at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, expanded its reach to all polytechnics across Singapore.</p>
<p>“No matter which part of my life, digital became increasingly important, but the quality of time spent offline was also appreciated a lot,” she noted. </p>
<p>While she and her family used to travel a lot for work and play, the pandemic brought a halt to their globetrotting.</p>
<p>“So even though we were inside the house a lot, we spent a lot of time talking to each other, discussing the news, trying to work on new projects and also learning to enjoy everything that Singapore has to offer,” she said.</p>
<p>And how will the world look in future?</p>

<h1> Left homeless after her father's death, she now empowers women to start businesses </h1>
<div> <p>Huda Hamid's family was thrown into a dire financial situation when she was 21. Today, she helps single mothers and women from low income households become financially independent.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Melissa Stewart </a> </div> </div>
<p>Social entrepreneur Huda Hamid has one message for women: You don't need a lot of resources in order to start your own business. In fact, it doesn’t take much to try and turn your life around.</p>
<p>Her mother’s name was registered as a partner in the family’s business. But according to Huda, “she didn’t know how to operate it”. In essence, she was only a partner in name. </p>
<p>The company was in debt, and the burden of repaying those debts fell onto her mother’s shoulders. But without any business skills or knowledge, it wasn’t long till she was declared bankrupt, and the family had to give up their HDB flat.</p>
<p>“We had nowhere to stay,” Huda, the youngest of four siblings, recalled, a tinge of sadness in her voice. “We were relying on the sympathy of our relatives. We would spend three days here, three days there.”</p>

<p>BIRTH OF FEMPRENEUR SECRETS </p>
<p>Eventually, Huda’s family managed to secure a rental flat for their lodging. “After leading Blissful Studios to success, I decided that it was time to go out there and teach others what I know,” she said. </p>
<p>While still running Blissful Studios, she started Fempreneur Secrets in 2017, an online training platform that helps women grow their own businesses. Its mission is to create a community of economically independent female entrepreneurs worldwide.</p>
<p>Through Fempreneur Secrets, Huda runs the Fearless Fempreneur Academy programme, which helps instill women with the confidence they need to start a business. </p>
<p>“We teach them basic business knowledge, as well as sales and marketing knowledge. We also go a little bit deeper to help them identify their niche, or what we call their ‘superpower’,” Huda said.</p>
<p>"Even if they don't end up starting a business, the skills we teach them can still help them excel in their careers, as entrepreneurship skills are applicable in other aspects of life," she said. </p>
<p>Huda shared the story of a 19-year-old Singaporean beneficiary, who is unable to leave her house due to a medical condition. With Huda's help, she can now contribute to her family's income.</p>
<p>“She can only work from home, so I helped her to plan out what kind of business she can do, and gave her the confidence to launch it. She dreams of becoming a chef, and now she runs an online FB home business,” Huda shared.</p>
<blockquote> <p>We want to help women not only in Singapore but in the rest of Asia to upskill themselves so they don’t remain where they are.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Aside from her work with Fempreneur Secrets, Huda regularly volunteers with the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce (SMCCI). “We build programmes for women entrepreneurs, and we support initiatives to raise funds for charity,” she said.</p>
<p>One of the organisations that SMCCI works with is Persatuan Pemudi Islam Singapura (PPIS), also known as the Singapore Muslim Women’s Association, a non-profit organisation that helps less privileged women, children and families.</p>
<p>“From time to time, I also get requests to do pro bono training sessions for women from marginalised homeless communities in Asia,” Huda shared.</p>
<p>What drives Huda to do the work that she does is being able to interact with women from all walks of life. “I love speaking with them and seeing them succeed. When they feel empowered, the whole community is empowered."</p>
<p>Quoting Bangladeshi social entrepreneur Muhammad Yunus, founder of Grameen Bank, Huda added, “When a man builds a business, the business prospers. But when a woman builds a business, the community prospers".</p>
<p>"A key trait of women is our compassion, and our desire to change the lives of people around us, whether it’s our loved ones, our neighbours, or our community. This is our strength as women, and we should embrace it," she shared. </p>

<p>In March this year, Huda emerged as one of six winners of the 2020 Young Social Entrepreneurs Global programme (YSE Global).</p>
<p>The company was awarded a grant of S$20,000, which Huda says will help the company “expand its outreach to more communities in Singapore and all over Asia”.</p>
<p>Future plans include getting other women entrepreneurs to conduct sessions with Fempreneur's community members. As Huda puts it, “I believe that my knowledge alone is not sufficient”.</p>
<p>As for Huda herself, she has now gone back to school to complete her degree in marketing. Looking back on how far she has come, she has no regrets.</p>
<p>“It has been a journey, but I wouldn’t change anything. Everything that happened to me in life, no matter how sour those experiences were, have shaped me to become the person I am today,” she said with a smile.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Myanmar airstrikes displace more people along Thai-Myanmar border </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BANGKOK: Myanmar's military carried out more airstrikes on a rebel-controlled area near the Thai border, the rebel group said on Friday (Dec 24), in the latest escalation of violence that has sent hundreds <a>fleeing into Thailand</a>.</p>
<p>The Karen National Union (KNU) said the military launched at least two airstrikes and fired some artillery rounds on an area under its control near the Thai-Myanmar border late on Thursday.</p>
<p>A Reuters reporter at Mae Sot, a Thai border town some 15km from where the air strikes reportedly took place, heard several explosions on Thursday evening at around 11pm local time.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Myanmar's military junta did not answer calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military ousted a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb 1, triggering protests and sporadic clashes in the countryside between anti-junta militia and the army.</p>
<p>KNU spokesman Saw Taw Nee told Reuters that the airstrikes have further displaced more civilians living in the area, and repeated his group's call for the international community to established a <a>no-fly zone</a> in the area.</p>
<p>Thailand's foreign ministry spokesman Tanee Sangrat said at a press conference on Friday that Thailand was concerned about the latest violence in Karen state that also impacted Thai people living along the border.</p>
<p>Several foreign envoys to Myanmar, including from the European Union, Britain and the United States, issued a joint statement on Friday calling for an end to "indiscriminate attacks" in Karen state and elsewhere by the military.</p>
<p>"The recent attacks on civilians in Karen state, including the shelling of villages, are a violation of International Humanitarian Law and must stop," they said.</p>

<h1> He went from web developer to furniture maker: A more fulfilling life making chairs </h1>
<div> <p>In search of a more balanced lifestyle, Shibui Furniture Collective's Kim Choy shared how he decided to turn his woodworking hobby into a career. Find out why in this instalment of CNA Lifestyle’s Creative Capital series.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aun Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>He took the time, though, to rethink his craft and his business. Today, he is focusing on chairs, as opposed to larger furniture formats.</p>
<p>The chair designs he has come up with have been selling well, both in Singapore and overseas. He tells us he has a new curriculum in mind for his classes and he is embarking on other new professional challenges. </p>
<p>WHEN DID YOU FIRST DISCOVER A LOVE FOR WOODWORKING?</p>
<p>It all started when I wanted to tinker with things physically instead of digitally. My previous profession as a web developer required me to deal with coding, even on weekends. I wanted a more balanced lifestyle so I looked for ways to unplug. </p>
<p>I tried working with metal but it didn’t really work out, hence I moved on to wood. I found this new hobby to be very empowering, so much so that it got me to delve deeper whenever each weekend came around.</p>
<p>HOW DID YOU LEARN THE CRAFT?</p>
<p>I am mostly self-taught and I learnt mainly through books with a lot of trial and error. I also visited craftsmen in Japan to get points of references when I hit a hurdle in using Japanese hand tools. </p>
<p>WAS THERE A PARTICULAR MOMENT WHEN YOU REALISED YOU WANTED TO BE A PROFESSIONAL WOODWORKER AS OPPOSED TO TREATING IT AS A HOBBY?</p>
<p>I think it was a decision built up over time. Being a web developer over the years took a lot out of me, so much so that it created a void that I had to constantly rely on woodworking to fill up. </p>
<p>I was also naive and wanted to prove to and challenge myself that if I could be a self-taught web developer and make a successful career out of it, I should be able to do it with woodworking.</p>
<p>WAS IT DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH YOURSELF?</p>
<p>Yes, I would say it was quite a difficult process to establish myself back then. I had set high expectations for myself as a designer/maker in Singapore but the reality was I could not attract enough clients to do so. </p>
<p>Even when I had inquiries coming in, it would be clients who would assume I was available for all kinds of assignments and willing to do it at rock bottom prices. </p>
<p>LOOKING BACK, WHAT DO YOU KNOW NOW THAT YOU WISH YOU KNEW WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED THE BUSINESS?</p>
<p>Developing my design skills was something I wish I had been more deliberate about when starting out. I think figuring out your own style is paramount to one’s success as a designer-maker. I have to confess I’m on a catching-up game in this aspect.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE YOUR FAVOURITE KINDS OF THINGS TO MAKE/DESIGN?</p>
<p>In order, chairs first, followed by stools, benches and tables.</p>
<p>ARE CHAIRS WHAT YOU ARE BEST KNOWN FOR?</p>
<p>I think I’m best known for being sensitive to the materials I use and always having the constant pursuit of deeper understanding of my subjects.</p>
<p>The handwoven rattan seat which can take up to 15 hours to weave – depending on the weaving pattern – is extremely comfortable to sit on. Even though they are produced in small batches, I’ve had a successful run of it so far. </p>
<p>The number of orders has exceeded my expectations and shipping out a pair of chairs to Melbourne at the start of the year was the icing on the cake.</p>
<p>WHAT HAS BEEN THE MOST FULFILLING PROJECT TO DATE?</p>
<p>AND WHAT HAS BEEN THE MOST DIFFICULT?</p>
<p>I had an order for two chairs and a stool in white oak and every item had steam-bent components. Bending the wood was the easy part once I figured out the optimal steaming duration.</p>
<p>The drying process was what almost broke me because as the parts dried, they started to have drying defects. Even though the cracks were somewhat cosmetic – there was no strength reduction – I still considered them rejects. </p>
<p>WHAT WOULD BE A DREAM COMMISSION FOR YOU?</p>
<p>It would be designing and making a big dinner table set with a mixture of side and dining chairs.</p>
<p>THREE YEARS AGO, IN AN INTERVIEW, YOU SAID THAT SINGAPOREANS LACK AN APPRECIATION FOR CARPENTRY. HAS THAT CHANGED?</p>
<p>Looking back at the interview, I think I might have used the terms woodworking and carpentry interchangeably. But I guess I was referring to woodworking, as furniture-making falls outside of the term carpentry.</p>
<p>HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOUR BUSINESS?</p>
<p>Before the pandemic I was on the mend from a table saw accident that had resulted in the loss of two digits from my left hand. Shortly after coming back to work, hoping to catch up on income loss, COVID-19 came along. </p>
<p>During the extension of lockdown, I thought it would be wise to close down the business for the time being and move the workshop back home. Unfortunately it was not possible … I had no choice but to fulfil the contract. </p>
<p>I had a strong desire to move towards being a chairmaker after the accident because making chairs would allow me to avoid the machine that had harmed me but wasn’t sure of the decision as it’s a different realm of woodworking altogether. </p>
<p>The pandemic lockdown offered downtime for me to think about it and during the two months of lockdown staying at home, I managed to complete prototypes of my first chair and stool.</p>
<p>Skipping all the diatribe on 2020, I would say the pandemic has provided itself as a catalyst for change. Without the added pressure from the pandemic, I guess I wouldn’t have had the courage to change direction.</p>
<p>WILL YOU BE RESTARTING WORKSHOPS ANYTIME IN THE FUTURE? </p>
<p>Yes! But it’s too early to share more details. I’m juggling a few things at the same time and things can be very fluid. But one thing for sure is that the workshop curriculum will be going through a major overhaul. It’s going to be pretty exciting.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON FOR 2022 THAT WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING? </p>
<p>I am mostly excited about being part of a bigger project where I will be working with a renowned designer. I hope to rise to the challenge of working with someone who has experience working with established manufacturers.</p>
<p>There is also a group exhibition where I am involved with other artists from various fields to come up with objects to re-interpret life in the pandemic.</p>
<p>I also hope to finish prototyping a few chair designs and hopefully launch them as a collection. These have taken a backseat for quite some time and I think 2022 will finally be the time for realisation.</p>
