<header><div/><div><h1>Most of the Caribbean is under a ‘Level 4’ travel warning. Islands still want visitors.</h1></div><h2>The CDC has given more than 20 destinations its do not travel warning </h2></header>

<div><p>As winter approaches and travelers start dreaming of warm weather, the Caribbean beckons. But 19 months into the pandemic, much of the region is struggling with the delta variant surge and insufficient access to coronavirus vaccines.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Late last month, the <a>Pan American Health Organization</a> warned that health systems in some Eastern Caribbean islands were becoming overwhelmed with the increase of cases and shortages of workers and supplies.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>are characterized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as “Level 4” because of very high rates of covid-19, which means the public health agency recommends avoiding travel.
<div><div><p>Those countries and territories include such popular spots as Jamaica, Puerto Rico, Aruba, the U.S. Virgin Islands and, as of Monday, Barbados. In all, more than 20 destinations are listed as Level 4.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The CDC's do not travel list, explained</p></div>
<div><div><p>In the Bahamas, for example, visitation through August increased nearly 50 percent from last year to more than 612,000 as airlines increased service.</p></div></div>
<div><p>I. Chester Cooper, the Bahamas’ deputy prime minister and the minister of tourism, investments and aviation, said in an emailed statement that the country is optimistic that a “robust holiday season” is possible.</p></div>
<div><div><p>That is the balance the entire region has been trying to find as destinations have reopened with a variety of entry procedures.</p></div></div>

<a>grid online</a> with various protocols to try to help potential visitors keep track.
<div><div><p>“We know it’s been challenging and we have lobbied for harmonization across the region as much as possible,” Ledesma said. “Every destination has different limitations or requirements.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“And many clients are concerned that policies will change quickly, and they may be stuck or lose their investment,” he said in an email.</p></div></div>
<a>travel advisories</a>. While there was a dip of interest in the summer after Europe’s reopening and during hurricane season, he said interest in the region moving into the fall and holiday period is “robust.”

<div><p>This historic San Juan walking tour is an architecture lover’s dream</p></div>
<div><div><p>Within the Caribbean, the foreign travel advisories are viewed with some frustration. Ledesma <a>wrote</a> in September that the industry has gone to great lengths to protect visitors and those who work in the tourism industry.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Clive Landis, who chairs the covid-19 task force at the University of the West Indies in Barbados, said the recent change from Level 3 to 4 in Barbados doesn’t change anything about entry or exit protocols.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>A grandpa called his budget hotel room the ‘Waldorf Astoria.’ He finally stayed in a real one — in Rome. </h1></div>
<h2>A 91-year-old’s sense of humor during Texas winter storms turned into a trip of a lifetime</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 25, 2021 at 4:21 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>When Ezell Holley and his family called their budget hotel ‘the Waldorf Astoria’ after winter storms forced them out of their homes earlier this year, it became an inside joke.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Seven months later, it turned into the trip of a lifetime.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A Texas grandpa escaped the cold at a budget hotel nicknamed the ‘Waldorf Astoria.’ Then an actual Waldorf Astoria found out.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He didn’t have to wait quite that long. The border started to reopen to American travelers in May, and the Holley family headed over late last month.</p></div></div>
<p>While family members had vied to be the guest to accompany Holley, in the end they all went — grandpa, Alex and her parents — some of them paying their own way. When they arrived, there was another surprise: Grandpa got the penthouse.</p>
<p>“One of the highlights was when we arrived at the hotel, they had the whole hotel management and staff out to greet us,” he said in an interview Monday. “And that was a big surprise and made me feel like I was royalty.”</p>
<div><div><p>In a <a>video</a> that his granddaughter included in a follow-up news segment, he explores the room in awe. “Oh my lord, this is luxury,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A local's guide to Rome</p></div>
<div><div><p>Alex said in an interview Monday that the woman who was showing them around even teared up at his reactions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were all emotional watching him see this,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The digs included hot tubs inside and out, a star-decorated ceiling, Andy Warhol art, an oversized Karl Lagerfeld sofa and sweeping patio views that included the Vatican.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never lived like this,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His granddaughter replied: “You’re living like it now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Glenn Holley, Ezell’s son, said champagne flowed and “all you had to do was think of something and it seemed to appear.” His father was mystified, though, when a worker showed up at night to turn down the bed.</p></div></div>
<div><p>It was a trip Ezell never thought he’d get to take again after visiting decades ago, when he was in the Army and stationed in Germany. His son had been planning a return trip to surprise him, but the pandemic got in the way.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Speaking about the trip on the air this month, Alex said the original circumstances that landed her family in the non-Waldorf hotel were stressful and scary.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“So we’re just so glad that now we can replace it with this memory,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She added: “We’re going to sit on this one for a while. Who knows if we’ll live like that again?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Ezell, who turns 92 in December, isn’t ready to put his <a>passport</a> away.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I hope to travel some more,” he said. “I still feel good. I haven’t decided definitely where I want to go next. I had thought about going to Africa, but I don’t know.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Hotel guests in towels and bathing suits fled for cover inside two resorts south of Cancún Thursday after gunmen allegedly from rival drug cartels exchanged fire on the beach.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>AP reported 15 attackers arrived by boat in Puerto Morelos, Mexico, wearing ski masks and left the scene on the water. Authorities detained eight suspects with guns, according to AP.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Guests are telling me they were playing volleyball on the beach, gunman approached firing gun,” Sington <a>tweeted</a>. AP reported that guests at Azul Beach Resort shared similar scenes on social media.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In an emailed statement, Hyatt said the hotel has ramped up security measures and that authorities gave the go ahead to resume business Thursday evening after they completed investigations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“As soon as the situation occurred, the hotel team immediately engaged local authorities and took steps in an effort to ensure the safety of guests and colleagues,” the statement said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Passport expiration dates were probably the last thing on people’s minds during the past year-plus of border closures, stay-at-home orders and slashed flight schedules.</p></div></div>
<a>warning</a> wait times could be 12 to 18 weeks.
<div><div><p>That is because of continued delays caused by the pandemic, the Associated Press <a>said</a> last week. The news agency reported a backlog of 1.5 million to 2 million passport requests.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For many U.S. citizens, that means hoped-for summer vacation plans might have to change.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Peter Vlitas, executive vice president of supplier relations at Internova Travel Group, said travel advisers are frequently hearing from desperate clients.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Every day, we have literally dozens, if not hundreds, of customer saying, ‘Can you help me expedite a passport?’ ” he said. “And the honest answer is ‘no.’”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Instead, travelers without a valid passport are choosing domestic destinations near and far, from Florida to Hawaii and Alaska — and many places in between. But there are other, more far-flung locales to choose from.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Travelers should, of course, check for local covid-19 restrictions; make sure to have the required forms of identification including proof of citizenship; and research every step of the journey to avoid potential border issues in transit.</p></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Who did the ban affect?</div></h3></div></div>

<a>Foreign nationals</a> must be fully vaccinated and show proof of a negative rapid or PCR coronavirus test within three days of boarding their flight to the United States. “Self-tests” can be used if they

<div><div><p>The country’s largest airlines have lost or damaged at least 15,425 wheelchairs or scooters since they were required to start reporting those numbers to the government at the end of 2018.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That number <a>plummeted</a> to 3,464 in 2020, or about 9.5 a day. In the first quarter of this year, passengers <a>reported</a> that 712 devices, or nearly eight a day, were mishandled.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>The problem with BYOB on flights</h1></div><h2>You can bring your own alcohol, but it better stay in your bag</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>July 8, 2021 at 10:39 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>When airlines cut back on alcohol service on flights during the pandemic, some passengers figured they would still find a way to partake, do-it-yourself style.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Big problem for the BYOB crowd: That solution is very much against the rules.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Over the past few months, the agency has proposed fines against 13 passengers for behavior including consumption of alcohol that wasn’t served by the airline during a flight.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Airline passengers are behaving worse than ever. One proposed solution? Ban alcohol.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Transportation Security Administration <a>has pointed out</a> fliers can carry on alcohol as long it is 3.4 ounces or less, can fit in a quart-sized bag and is under 70 percent alcohol by volume.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Duty-free alcohol can go in <a>carry-on</a> bags, but busting that open during a flight is also a non-starter.</p></div></div>
<a>loophole</a> in the past: Passengers could ask a flight attendant to pour a drink from the traveler’s own stash. At one time, JetBlue even said publicly that in-flight crew would be happy to do so, Condé Nast Traveler
<div><div><p>Likewise, American Airlines said gate agents will not let customers carry open containers with alcohol onto a plane, and flight attendants will not pour personal alcohol. Southwest, United and Delta have similar rules.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Airlines have seen an unprecedented rise in disruptive passengers. Experts say it could get worse.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Gilbert Ott, founder of the travel blog <a>God Save The Points</a>, has written about airline BYOB in the past — and has done it successfully in places including the United Kingdom and United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In the U.S., it was always this kind of wink-and-a-nod thing,” he said. He said JetBlue was especially amenable to serving alcohol he had brought on board.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But that was “B.C.,” he said, before covid-19. Airlines cut back on alcohol sales in the early days of the pandemic, and some have continued to suspend them amid a rise in unruly passenger behavior.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think so much has changed with the air rage now that it’s just a completely different proposition,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ott said he is not sure how widely known it is that air travelers aren’t allowed to guzzle their own mini bottles during a flight.</p></div></div>

<div><p>A Southwest flight attendant lost two teeth after being assaulted on a flight. The passenger was arrested.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I think it could get worse as more and more mask restrictions are lifted throughout the country,” said Jeff Price, professor of aviation management at Metropolitan State University of Denver.</p></div></div>

<a>announced</a> that vaccinated people did not need to wear a mask indoors or outdoors in many scenarios. The
<a>requirement</a> to wear a mask in airports and on planes, trains and other forms of transportation did not change.
<div><div><p>“There is just this level of confusion that also comes into play,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The return of international flights in greater numbers could also lead to more incidents, said Doug Drury, professor of aviation at the University of South Australia.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When borders reopen and long-haul travel returns we may see some events related to mask requirements on 6- to 17-hour flights,” he said in an email.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The vast majority of cases reported to the FAA involve refusal to follow the federal mask mandate, which is in place until Sept. 13. But experts say there are many factors playing into the rise of unruly passengers.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Air travel is already stressful,” Bor said. “Here’s a new stress that’s been thrown into the system.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Preexisting divisions in the United States aren’t helping. Nelson said flight attendants have found that there are regional patterns to bad behavior.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There tends to be greater incidents where you are flying out of a place where local and state leaders have said that the pandemic is a hoax, that masks are not necessary, all of those things,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Price said a portion of the traveling public feels “emboldened” to ignore instructions from authorities.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A maskless airline passenger blew his nose into a blanket. He now faces a $10,500 fine.</p></div>

<div><div><p>Mask tensions have piled on top of anger that flight attendants were seeing among passengers before the pandemic, Nelson said, as people chafed at sitting in ever-shrinking seats, closer to neighbors in economy sections.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Air rage incidents are on the rise. First-class sections aren’t helping.</p></div>
<a>said</a> it had gotten reports of more than 66,000 incidents between 2007 and 2017.
<a>“air rage,”</a> frequently fueled by drugs or alcohol, has ebbed and flowed over the past few decades, said Thomas, who has written books about the subject and runs the website
<a>announced</a> a zero-tolerance policy for bad behavior on planes in the days after the Capitol riot on Jan 6. The flight attendants union
<a>said</a> at the time that those who stormed the building should not be allowed to get on flights home.
<div><div><p>During a town hall meeting late last month, FAA chief Steve Dickson said he was “appalled” at the behavior the agency had seen on planes and warned of “hefty fines and possible jail time.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Covid-19, we all know, has been a trying time for everyone,” Dickson said. “But that’s no excuse for leaving good behavior in the airport or at the airplane door.”</p></div></div>
<a>publicized</a> several fines against unruly passengers in recent months. Airlines have added disruptive passengers to their own lists of banned travelers. Some have
<a>extended</a> their suspension of alcohol sales — a move flight attendants and other observers applauded.
<div><p>Airline passengers are behaving worse than ever. One proposed solution? Ban alcohol.</p></div>
<div><div><p>But experts think there are more steps that authorities can take, like providing more education about why masks are still required on planes and restricting alcohol in airports as well as on planes.</p></div></div>
<p>Nelson said most important is that everyone involved in air travel — flight attendants, captains, airlines, the FAA and Transportation Security Administration — constantly communicate the rules and expectations for the flying public.</p>
<div><div><p>Still, no one can really say what will end the current run of bad behavior.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When will this stop?” Drury asked. “That is a great question. Maybe when civility returns.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 4, 2021 at 1:46 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p><i>This story has been updated.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There is no requirement for air travelers within the United States to be vaccinated against covid-19. But depending on which airline you fly, there might be a mandate for employees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what American Airlines and other major U.S. airlines are requiring for employees.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Fauci says he supports vaccine mandates for air travel. Will it actually fly?</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Alaska Airlines</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Of the Alaska and Horizon employees who have shared their status, about 75 percent are vaccinated, the company said last month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We believe having as many people as possible vaccinated is the best path for protection against covid-19, and we will continue to strongly encourage our employees to be vaccinated,” Lane said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>American Airlines</div></h3></div></div>
<p>A follow-up memo on Friday said the government had provided those details, and all American U.S.-based employees — as well as some international crew members — would have to be vaccinated with no option to choose testing instead.</p>
<a>reported</a> last month that unvaccinated employees at American will not be eligible for special leave if they have to quarantine because of the virus; they would have to use their own sick time or leave.
<div><div><p>“Up to this point, we haven’t put people in that position of having to choose whether or not they are vaccinated or employed,” he said. “That’s coming, though.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Path Forward: The Airline Industry with American Airlines Chair CEO Doug Parker</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Delta Air Lines</div></h3></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> test every week while community case rates are high, chief executive Ed Bastian
<a>announced</a>. Those employees also will be subject to a $200 monthly surcharge on their health-care plans starting Nov. 1.
<div><div><p>“This surcharge will be necessary to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company,” Bastian wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As of Sept. 30, coronavirus pay protection will be provided only to vaccinated workers who get a breakthrough infection, the memo said.</p></div></div>
<a>82 percent </a>as of last month. The company also has offered incentives such as paid time off and cash giveaways.
<div><div><p>On Monday, Durrant said the airline is evaluating the administration’s plan. So far, 84 percent of employees have been vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Frontier Airlines</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The low-cost carrier <a>said</a> in August that all direct employees must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 1. Those who choose not to get the shot, or can’t, will need to show proof of a negative coronavirus test “on a regular basis.”</p>
<div><div><p>“The good news is that the vast majority of our employees have already taken this important step and have gotten vaccinated,” chief executive Barry Biffle said in a <a>news release</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>International travel is about to get more complicated for unvaccinated Americans</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Hawaiian Airlines</div></h3></div></div>
<a>reported</a> this past month. Those who are approved for medical and religious exemptions will be required to have regular tests, the paper said. Hawaiian did not respond to questions seeking more details.
<div><div><h3><div>JetBlue Airways</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Southwest Airlines</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>After a “thorough review” of Biden’s vaccine order, Southwest said Monday that employees must be vaccinated or be approved for an accommodation by Dec. 8 to stay with the company.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Previously, the airline said it strongly encouraged employees to get vaccinated. The airline is not testing unvaccinated employees at this point and did not share the percentage of its employees who have been immunized.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In September, the carrier said it would offer about two days of pay to workers who are — or become — fully vaccinated and share proof by Nov. 15.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Starting Nov. 16, employees will have to be vaccinated to be eligible for up to 10 days of quarantine pay if they become infected or are forced to quarantine for work-related exposure.</p></div></div>
<div><p>United Airlines becomes first carrier to mandate vaccine for U.S.-based employees</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>United Airlines</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>All U.S.-based employees at United must be fully vaccinated by Oct. 31, with a deadline of Sept. 27 for at least a first shot, the airline announced last month. And the potential penalties are strict.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“If you have not received and reported at least one shot or have not been granted an accommodation extension, United will start the separation process as early as September 28,” United said in an update to employees.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The carrier said recently that aside from the “small number” of employees who have asked for an exemption, more than 97 percent of its U.S. employees are vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Workers had to submit an application for an exemption for medical or religious reasons by Aug. 31. Those who were granted exemptions will have to go on temporary leave starting Oct. 2; it’s not clear when that leave will end.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Six employees filed a class-action lawsuit against United over the exemptions, Reuters <a>reported</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re reviewing this complaint in greater detail but at this point, we think it’s without merit,” spokeswoman Leslie Scott said in an email.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>Couple finds their luggage is overweight because of stowaway dog </h1></div><h2>Icky, their five-pound chihuahua, almost made it onto a Southwest flight to Vegas </h2></header>

<div><div><p>For the first time in history, travelers had a reason to applaud checked baggage fees.</p></div></div>
<p>Like most people, the Owenses wanted to avoid the fee, so they opened up their suitcase to rearrange their belongings. That’s when they discovered Icky, their five-pound rescue chihuahua, hiding inside one of Jared’s cowboy boots.</p>
<div><p>“Just coming out of the boot is Icky’s little bitty head bobbing up and down with her tongue out,” Jared said. “I wish there would have been a picture of our faces when we opened that up and saw that.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>The couple, naturally, was stunned.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was just surreal,” Kristi said. “Are we really seeing our dog in our suitcase right now? Is this happening?”</p></div></div>
<div><p>4 flight attendants (and a pilot) share their skin-care tips for flying with masks</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Owenses were mortified, and they were worried that airline staff would think they hid their dog on purpose.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>“</b>We were just looking for a little romantic getaway, a little escape,” Kristi said. “We’ve got a really busy house. We’ve got two children, three dogs, a rabbit, a lot of fish.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So how did it happen?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kristi packed the night before the trip, and Jared added his belongings to the suitcase the morning of the flight.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“And the last things I packed were those boots,” Jared said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“She didn’t make a peep,” Kristi said.</p></div></div>
<p>“[Southwest employees] were great about it. They helped us do everything we could to get our bags checked,” Jared said. “We went outside to make phone calls, and Cathy even came back outside a couple of times to check on us.”</p>
<div><div><p>When Jared’s uncle arrived at the airport, the Owenses handed off Icky through the window and scrambled to make their flight. They ultimately made it to Vegas and saw the Icky incident as a good omen.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We won money, so …” Jared said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>8 terrifying campsites to book this Halloween — if you dare</p></div>
<div><div><p>Icky was lucky to be found. Pulling off the stowaway attempt could have been fatal for the chihuahua.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If she does want to travel with her owners on a future flight, Icky can do so legitimately. For a <a>$95 fee each way</a> on Southwest, the Owenses could let Icky burrow in a pet carrier underneath an <a>airplane seat</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Southwest allows small dogs and cats to travel in-cabin,” said Southwest spokeswoman Alyssa Foster, who added that she has never heard of a situation like Icky’s in her decade working at the airline.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re<b> </b>super grateful,” Kristi said. “She’s super spoiled now — not that she wasn’t before, but it’s a little extra now.”</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>Alaska Airlines is getting rid of plastic bottles and cups for water</h1></div><h2>The change will remove an estimated 22 million plastic cups and 32 million plastic bottles from flights through 2022</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Natalie B. Compton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 3, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>In an effort to curb in-flight waste, Alaska Airlines is getting rid of single-use plastic bottles and cups for water beginning Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Instead of plastic bottles, the airline will use Boxed Water Is Better, a brand that uses 92 percent plant-based cartons. For now, Alaska Airlines will continue using plastic cups to serve other beverages, such as soda and alcohol.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In 2019, Alaska Airlines, which is the fifth-largest U.S. carrier, started looking into what single-use items onboard had the biggest environmental impact.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Conversations around plastics began before the coronavirus pandemic but were accelerated when Alaska started giving passengers individual bottles of water in lieu of its normal refreshment service.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>Battles are being waged over airline refunds. Passengers aren’t always winning.</h1></div><h2>Travelers are still struggling to get money back from trips the pandemic thwarted </h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 13, 2021 at 5:39 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Since global travel shut down in March 2020, thwarted passengers have been asking a version of the same question: Where’s the money for the trip I couldn’t take?</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic, the department received an average of 17,420 aviation complaints a year, with just over 8 percent related to refunds.
<a>Consumer Reports Advocacy.</a> “We have put more energy into this single issue than any other airline issue that we have advocated for over the last 18 months or so.”
<div><div><p>He said the organization started collecting stories from people who were having refund problems in March 2020 and were “inundated.” Complaints from people struggling to get their money back continue today.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re talking about people that have booked as recently as a month ago,” McGee said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to cancel your flights, Airbnbs and more because of the delta variant</p></div>
<a>Southwest’s over the weekend</a> — resulting in more than 2,000 cancellations — typically put a new focus on the subject. Carriers are legally obligated to provide refunds if they cancel or significantly change a flight.
<div><div><p>In the months after the onset of the pandemic, the Department of Transportation said, airlines had a hard time processing the volume of refund requests that they received.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Many airlines were also initially reluctant to provide the required refunds,” the department’s report said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nine airlines, according to the department, amended their policies to make it clear to passengers when they are entitled to a refund, and they are providing those refunds as required.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Thousands of passengers who had initially been denied refunds have received or are receiving the required refunds,” the report said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The department is also starting the process of exploring rules that would enhance consumers’ rights if a flight is operating but a passenger decides not to fly because there are government restrictions.</p></div></div>
<p>Advocates say another category of traveler is left out: people who were sick with covid-19 and couldn’t travel, those whose events were canceled, and travelers who were under a doctor’s order or public health guidelines not to fly.</p>
<div><div><p>“In that category, airlines have generally refused to provide a cash refund,” said Paul Hudson, president of the passenger advocacy group <a>FlyersRights</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>You asked: The airline rescheduled our flight. What can we do?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Experts say those who believe they are owed a refund but haven’t had any luck should take these steps:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Take it to the DOT</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Travelers can file a complaint with the Department of Transportation on its <a>website</a>. The department suggests first giving the airline a chance to resolve the issue at the airport or after you file a complaint with the carrier.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Keep trying with the airline</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>McGee said his “all-bold, all-caps advice” is to be persistent. He said the success stories he hears usually come from people who try — by calling or other means — five, six or seven times.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You can’t make one call and expect to have it done,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Complain on social media</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Turn to the credit card company</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>If the airline did not provide a service, consumers can dispute the charge on their credit card — though this option is time-sensitive. McGee said travelers should always book with a credit card so this remains an option.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Ask an advocate</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>FlyersRights offers tips on resolving refund issues. It has a hotline set up at 877-FLYERS-6.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While consumer advocates said they are glad to see the DOT’s report — and have met with officials to press for passengers’ rights — they want to see the department do more.</p></div></div>
<p>“There’s a lot of people who simply do not want to fly,” McGee said. “The amount of the refunds can vary tremendously ... and people need that money. They don’t need airlines to earn interest on that money.”</p>

<header><div><h1>Vacationers are flying first-class more. But why?</h1></div><h2>Business travelers once filled the first rows. Now it’s a different type of flier. </h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>October 21, 2021 at 5:20 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<p>Amanda Millwood has never flown first class. But next month — thanks to a flight credit from 2020 and a cheaper-than-expected price — she will sit in the front of the plane for a weekend trip from Birmingham, Ala., to New York.</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s kind of a ‘treat yourself’ kind of thing,” said Millwood, an executive assistant. “I lucked out that my credit was big enough that I could fly first class.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The 37-year-old said she is usually envious of the extra room that first-class passengers have. But the seat she chose comes with another perk: No one sitting next to her.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Airline classes are complicated. Here’s how to know which one you need.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Andrew Nocella, chief commercial officer for United, said the amount of “premium leisure” business had been “amazing.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“What we’ve seen over the last few months in particular is more of a willingness to spend a few extra dollars to upgrade to a premium seat in the main cabin or to fly in the first-class cabin,” he said Wednesday.</p></div>
<div><p>Will business travel ever be the same?</p></div>
<div><p>Business travel started to creep back in the summer, but the surge of <a>coronavirus</a> cases caused by the delta variant put the brakes on that return for a while — leaving the seats favored by corporate types up for grabs.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Leisure travel in the United States, on the other hand, has roared back to life. And at least some of the people who are getting away are sitting on untouched travel budgets, flight credits or miles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The flight deals alert service <a>Scott’s Cheap Flights</a> has seen more demand for the higher-end seats, with some customers upgrading to premium economy and taking advantage of business-class deals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Willis Orlando, member operations specialist at Scott’s Cheap Flights, said the attitude is often “I’ve been waiting to travel a year and a half; I’m splurging.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Denise Milano Sprung, of Long Island, booked first-class tickets from New York to Orlando for herself, her husband and their two teenage sons over the summer for a Disney trip and found the prices not too much higher than economy.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I wanted my sons to be a little bit separated from other people,” said Sprung, marketing director for the wealth-management firm her husband, Larry Sprung, founded. “I did buy that one for the space.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Battles are being waged over airline refunds. Passengers aren’t always winning.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Because of a cancellation on the Las Vegas trip, the couple was upgraded above first class to “Delta One,” with seats that allow passengers to lie down.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It did make a five-hour flight — where you get up at 5 in the morning — much nicer,” Sprung said.</p></div></div>
<p>Chris Lopinto, founder of the research tool and subscription service <a>ExpertFlyer</a>, said travelers even in these odd times shouldn’t go into a flight expecting an upgrade, though they may be able to place bids to pay for upgrades.</p>
<div><div><p>He said if passengers want to use miles to pay for higher-end seats, they should do the math to make sure the cost in miles makes sense: “You never want to get less than a penny per mile for sure,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m a decidedly back-of-the-cabin guy,” he said, “but I’ve been very tempted quite frequently.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A Southwest Airlines employee was taken to a hospital after a passenger assaulted her during the boarding process at Dallas Love Field Airport on Saturday, airline officials said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>According to the Dallas Police Department, 32-year-old Arielle Jean Jackson boarded the New York-bound flight about 12:40 p.m. and soon after began a “verbal altercation” with a flight attendant at the back of the plane.</p></div>
<b> </b>with aggravated assault, Juan Fernandez, a Dallas police spokesman, said Sunday.
<div><div><p>It was unclear whether Jackson had retained a defense lawyer.</p></div></div>
<p>“Southwest Airlines maintains a zero-tolerance policy regarding any type of harassment or assault and fully supports our Employee as we cooperate with local authorities regarding this unacceptable incident,” the statement said.</p>

<div><div><p>Last week, the FAA announced $225,287 in civil penalties against 10 airline passengers for alleged unruly behavior, including onboard three Southwest flights.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The man was arrested at the arrival gate and fined $26,787, according to an FAA <a>news release.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This month, the FAA announced it had referred more than three dozen unruly passengers to the FBI for potential criminal prosecution in hopes of curbing the uptick in violent behavior on planes this year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Let this serve both as a warning and a deterrent: If you disrupt a flight, you risk not just fines from the FAA but federal criminal prosecution as well,” FAA Administrator Stephen Dickson said in a news release.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><h1>The CDC’s do not travel list, explained </h1></div><h2>The agency’s travel advisories can differ from the State Department’s. Here’s how to make sense of them.</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>August 30, 2021 at 1:07 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Every Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention delivers news for travelers — namely, which destinations they should avoid because of covid-19.</p></div></div>
<a>others</a> were put on that list, and the week before,
<a>St. Maarten</a> were added. Earlier this month, countries including France, Iceland and Greece found themselves in that “Level 4” category, which signifies that covid-19 is very high and people should stay away.
<div><div><p>At the same time, the State Department issues its own <a>travel advisories</a>, which factor in the CDC’s recommendations but also include other threats such as terrorism, civil unrest, crime and natural disasters.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Understanding the State Department’s updated travel advisories</p></div>
<div><div><p>But to navigate all the advice, experts say, travelers must read the details — and understand what the warnings describe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What are the CDC’s levels?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>designation</a> of your destination, the agency says everyone should be fully vaccinated before traveling.
<div><div><p>One step up, at Level 3, the CDC says all unvaccinated travelers should avoid nonessential travel. For destinations marked as Level 4 or unknown, the agency says Americans should avoid traveling there altogether.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How are the levels decided?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The CDC’s destination-specific recommendations are <a>based</a> on the number of new cases reported per 100,000 people over the past 28 days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That metric is more useful than a case count alone because it gives a better idea of someone’s risk of getting infected, said Lise Barnard, a health-intelligence analyst at risk management firm <a>Crisis24</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>People who are especially vulnerable to severe illness should also weigh their own risks, she said, even when traveling to a place that is rated at a lower level.</p></div></div>
<div><p>American tourists are back in Europe, but so are covid restrictions</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How are the State Department’s levels different?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Each State Department travel advisory specifies why a country is placed in a given level and what health, safety or security concerns to keep in mind.</p></div></div>
<p>“In our travel information, we warn people not to visit certain high-risk countries and areas both because of local conditions and because we are limited in our ability to provide consular services in those places,” the department said.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>What are other sources to check?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Virk, of Mayo Clinic, recommended checking country-specific information about covid-19 on the World Health Organization’s <a>website</a>. She also said travelers should talk to a travel medicine expert to help them assess their risks.</p>
<div><div><p>“This is particularly important for individuals who have comorbidities that potentially increase the risk of severe COVID-19,” she said in an email.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The State Department publishes broader <a>country information pages</a> in addition to its travel advisories.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Those pages also include <a>links </a>to each embassy’s covid-19 page, which include entry and exit requirements, testing availability, vaccine information, curfews and other pandemic-related information.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What 6 health experts say about traveling amid the delta variant</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What are the risks of leaving the U.S.?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>And, the CDC says, travel increases the chance of contracting and spreading the virus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Travelers need to be aware that they can spread disease at their destination among people who may not have the same access to vaccinations and quality medical care,” the CDC’s Shockey said.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><h1>Flying with kids: 6 questions about mask rules, answered</h1></div><h2>Everything you need to know before your next family flight</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Sampson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>September 28, 2021 at 4:20 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Around the time his son was turning 2 last year, Chris Hassan started seeing stories about families with young kids getting removed from planes because their young children wouldn’t wear masks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were really stressed about that,” said Hassan, who lives in Brazil and writes about family travel for the website Upgraded Points.</p></div></div>
<a>mandate</a> — continue to be a stress point for parents of young children. Kids under 2 don’t have to wear one (and shouldn’t, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says). But once they turn 2, it’s a different story.
<div><div><p>“Anyone over 2, boom: You have to wear a mask,” said Hassan, who has <a>written</a> about the rules on U.S. and foreign airlines.</p></div></div>
<a>said</a> on social media that her son had never worn a mask before was forced to leave a plane before takeoff when the boy couldn’t keep his face covered.
<div><p>We may not have to wear masks on planes forever. But should we?</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is the rule for children and masks on planes?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>According to the TSA’s <a>mandate</a>, which is in effect through January, everyone 2 and older has to wear a face covering in airports, planes, trains and other forms of transportation.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The mandate <a>says</a> masks can be removed briefly to eat, drink or take medication, but it warns: “Prolonged periods of mask removal are not permitted for eating or drinking; the mask must be worn between bites and sips.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If TSA’s age limit is lower than a foreign air carrier’s age limit, the TSA age requirement applies and the younger child must wear a mask,” spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said in an email.</p></div></div>
<div><p>That means foreign tourists who may have traveled under less-strict rules outside of the United States will need to prepare young kids to mask up for any visit to the country once the widespread travel ban is lifted in early November.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Who enforces the rule?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because masks are required in airports and on planes, airline employees throughout the air travel process are tasked with reminding passengers about the rules.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On board, flight attendants are the ones interacting with passengers and reminding them about mask rules.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Why cloth masks are on some airlines’ no-fly lists</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What kind of mask do kids have to wear?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Are there mask exemptions for kids?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>says</a> that is “not meant to cover people with disabilities for whom wearing a mask might only be difficult.” The agency notes that asthma probably does not qualify a traveler for an exemption.
<a>website</a>. Delta says passengers who are not able to wear a mask must go to the airport early to go through a “Clearance-to-Fly” process that can take more than an hour.
<a>approach</a>” that includes submitting a request form at least seven days before departure and proof of a negative test.
<p>Southwest also <a>requires</a> an application for an exemption seven days before traveling, with a doctor’s note. Passengers may also need a private medical screening over the phone and must test negative within three days of traveling.</p>
<div><div><p>JetBlue says it is a “very rare case” when a traveler qualifies for a medical exemption to mask rules. Passengers are asked to contact the airline “well in advance of travel” for instructions.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Airlines have seen an unprecedented rise in disruptive passengers. Experts say it could get worse.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What can happen if kids refuse to wear a mask on a plane?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Airlines warn that anyone who fails to wear a mask could be denied boarding, removed from the plane, subject to penalties under federal law or prohibited from flying the carrier in the future.</p></div></div>
<a>instances</a> involving families that were forced off a plane after a child — often aged 2 or 3 — could not keep a mask on. In the instance mentioned earlier, a woman
<a>said</a> she and her group, including her 2-year-old son, had to get off an American Airlines flight after he couldn’t keep a mask on.
<div><div><p>And JetBlue spokesman Derek Dombrowski said in an email that crew — “many who are parents themselves” — are aware that kids might find it hard to always keep their masks on in some circumstances.</p></div></div>
