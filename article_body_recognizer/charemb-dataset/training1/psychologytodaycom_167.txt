<p>Here are 3 things that you can do to develop <a>resilience</a>. </p>

<h1> You Really Don’t Have to Gain Weight During the Holidays </h1>
<h2> Plan ahead to eat without losing control — here's how. </h2>
<p> Posted December 3, 2019 </p>
<p>Holidays and events where food is center stage can be a real challenge with respect to remaining in control of eating. I have treated eating disorders for decades and I’m often asked: How does one not go crazy with eating during the holidays?</p>
<p>Conscious, <a>mindful</a> eating is about the only thing that really works to maintain a comfortable weight and control the potential for overeating. Here are some suggestions for managing your eating and weight, pre and post-holidays.</p>
<a>unconscious</a> eater and helps slow down the trajectory of unconscious eating.
<p>4. Plan to eat only the foods you love. Eating something that you merely “like” isn’t good enough for the body to register that you’ve eaten well and achieve satiation so as much as possible, eat foods you really love.</p>
<p>Finally, mindful, conscious and planned eating are the key ingredients of what can be a great holiday! </p>

<h1> Dating in the Time of Pandemic </h1>
<h2> Why now is a great time. </h2>
<a>online dating</a> platform is the means to an end, with the added advantage of having more time and forced distance to learn more about the other.
<p>Some tips before the search:</p>
<p>1. Take some time to list for yourself what qualities are necessary for you in a partner.</p>
<p>2. Be clear about what you are looking for. Are you looking for a long-term relationship, or are you looking for something else? Be ready to communicate that to whomever you meet.</p>
<p>3. Have you learned from relationships in the past? Why did they not work out? Soul-search your issues—what propels and repels your connections—and be open to working on them with a therapist.</p>
<p>4. Do you have the patience to deal with the process of dating, or are you in a rush? Be honest with yourself.</p>
<p>So how is it done? Some tips for how:</p>
<p>1. Explore the available dating websites for one which is a good fit and feels user-friendly to you.</p>
<p>5. Plan virtual dates. Share a virtual meal, get dressed as if you're meeting, share your respective ideas of things you enjoy. There will be a future time for that.</p>
<p>6. If you're in a rush, or if they are in a rush, question the motives. Lasting connections take time.</p>

<h1> The Secret to Changing Your Behavior </h1>
<h2> Even if we can't even stop touching our faces during a pandemic </h2>
<a>Motivation</a> is key to any new, changed behavior.
<p>Here are some tips to facilitate change.</p>
<a>smoking</a>, I will feel better and not have to worry so much about dying from lung disease." "If I exercise, I will feel better about me." "If I have better work-home balance, my life will feel more satisfying.”
<li>Create your own accountability. Set your own goals like for example, exercising once a week, and keep track of your progress. Setting small, manageable goals is the key.</li>
<li>Reward your steps however small. You need to be your own cheering squad. For example, recognize that you did make progress such as keeping to exercising once a week.</li>
<li>Don’t judge in terms of win versus fail. Attempts matter. Plenty don’t even try, and trying at all is huge. Getting closer to a goal is better than staying safe and where you were.</li>
<p>Change takes time. The reality is that most likely everyone hasn’t completely stopped touching their faces; we're probably just touching them less but with cleaner hands. And we all might even not touch our faces at all at some point.</p>

<li>Catch yourself going into <a>catastrophic thinking</a>. Remind yourself of where and who you are and not where you might be. The worst- case scenario mostly never happens.</li>
<li>Hard times trigger past experience. Remind yourself that what’s happening is now and not then.</li>
<li>Remember that being okay is about your internal state. It is the lens through which we see and experience the world which informs our perceptions. Work on your own peaceful state which leads to</li>
<li>Remind yourself of the blessings and good things in your life even if it’s hard to find good things at the moment</li>

<h1> Do People With a Spiritual Core Cope Better? </h1>
<h2> That seems to be the case in my therapy experience. Why is that? </h2>
<a>marriage</a>, loss of work, severe financial issues, family problems, difficult relationships—compounded by this COVID year. And yet, some have fared better than others.
<a>therapy</a> to help reinforce coping abilities and learn additional coping strategies. A pretty concise
<a>definition of spirituality</a> is “an awareness of the metaphysical, the religious, or the sublime. In practice,
<a>spirituality</a> includes participation in organized religion, contemplation,
<a>meditation</a>, prayer, reflection, and activities fostering self-growth and connections with others and with nature.”
<p>So, what’s that about and why does it help people cope better?</p>
<p>With a spiritual core comes faith that things larger than ourselves are possible. And that includes solutions.</p>
<p>The power of hope is essential in facing adversity. The belief that things never stay the same and can get better is key.</p>
<p>Being part of a larger community helps, too. Uniting with others of similar beliefs is strength in numbers, and the ability to join others is comforting.</p>
<p>And finally, people thrive in the face of awe and beauty and majesty. And they cope better.</p>
