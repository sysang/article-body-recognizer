<p>Some have grown into established tech titans in their own right, graduating from start-up to unicorn and even so-called superapp status in less than a decade.</p>
<p>One early success story has been US-listed e-commerce and gaming player Sea, which after listing in 2017 at US$15, has risen 20 times, making it the largest Southeast Asian listed company by market cap at US$166 billion.</p>
<p>Leveraging its regionally leading ride-hailing business, Grab moved into food and groceries deliveries, digital payments, and is pushing into areas such as insurance, lending, wealth tech, and Buy Now Pay Later.</p>
<p>Grab has attributed its ability to find success across a highly complex and diverse region to its emphasis on a hyperlocal approach.</p>
<p>Given its track record, Grab is well-positioned to capture a good portion of a total addressable market - estimated by Euromonitor to grow from US$52 billion today to US$130 billion by 2025 across the three categories it covers.</p>
<h4> <div>What are the implications of making food deliverers full-time employment? Grab Singapore's Managing Director Yee Wee Tang explains the impact for the business and consumers on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:</div> </h4>
<h2>GRAB’S RECENT EARNINGS SHOW RESILIENCE IN MOTION</h2>
<p>Grab has proved its worth in navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hit Southeast Asia especially hard. Cities in Vietnam went into <a>total lockdown</a> between July and September. Food delivery services were suspended.</p>
<p>While its ride-hailing business were hit hard by mobility restrictions across the region, this has been more than offset by the blistering growth in its food delivery business, highlighting the benefits of its superapp strategy.</p>
<p>A key positive was the increasing average spend per user, defined as GMV per monthly transacting user, which increased by 43 per cent, reflecting a deeper engagement with customers.</p>
<h2>SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES AHEAD</h2>
<p>On earnings calls, Grab has regularly pointed to its nascent groceries delivery business in GrabMart and more recently GrabSupermarket as a key area of focus, with both growing exponentially.</p>
<p>Grab Financial Group will also expand its services to include digital banking in Singapore, where it has secured a license in a joint venture with Singapore Telecommunications.</p>
<p>The region is not without competitive threats.</p>
<p>Grab's ride-hailing and delivery rival Gojek, especially strong in its home territory Indonesia, is also aiming to IPO in early 2022 under GoTo Group, a merger between Gojek and e-commerce player Tokopedia.</p>
<p>While GoTo has direct e-commerce exposure through Tokopedia and a stake in a digital bank in Indonesia called Bank Jago, it lacks the regional exposure that Grab has, with smaller operations in Vietnam and Singapore. </p>
<p>Sea could prove more troublesome as it has more recently <a>launched ShopeeFood</a> in Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam and looks set to roll that out across the region.</p>
<p>After Sea’s success, Grab may be the beacon the region has been waiting for to bring Southeast Asia onto the global stage.</p>
<p>The Grab listing will provide a benchmark for the valuation of other Southeast Asian start-ups planning to go public in the US in the near future.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Can we finally fix iPhones at neighbourhood shops without voiding warranty? </h1>
<div> <p>Apple's self-repair policy reversal might mean users get cheaper repairs and a new Apple experience, says Nanyang Business School’s Eunsoo Kim.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Eunsoo Kim </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Sometimes, all Apple users want is to get their iPhone repaired - without long wait times or costly tabs nudging them into thinking replacing it with the latest model might actually be more worthwhile.</p>
<p>Can they now rejoice? Apple announced on Nov 17 it’ll release self-service repair kits next year, starting with the most common parts like screens, batteries and cameras.</p>
<p>All brands try to control customer experiences from start to end, to ensure positive encounters, maintain long-lasting relationships, and establish brand loyalty.</p>
<p>And Apple has been strict on imposing this in repairs. You make an appointment to visit its “Genius Bar” – three in Singapore - or authorised service providers, where certified technicians use only genuine Apple parts. </p>
<p>By restricting the use of unauthorised parts often by claiming this could compromise consumer safety, Apple can meticulously maintain product quality while maintaining sales. </p>
<p>Bringing customers into physical stores can also further immerse them in its carefully curated product universe.</p>
<p>News of this dramatic policy reversal has sent ripples of excitement among Apple fans and “right to repair” advocates, allowing consumers to potentially engage a third-party technician or make repairs themselves with original parts.</p>
<p>But does this mean users can now pop into their heartland handphone shops for a cheaper quick fix?</p>
<h2>WILL SELF-REPAIR BE CHEAPER OR WITHIN WARRANTY?</h2>
<p>No one knows yet how much the self-repair kits and genuine parts will cost. So it’s uncertain how much value users can get out of self-repair.</p>
<p>But even on the assumption that it’ll continue to be cheaper to get repairs done in a third-party shop with Apple kits, this will certainly entail some manner of trade-off.</p>
<p>Such trade-offs in repair policy are not unheard of - even Samsung has them.</p>
<p>A phone call with Samsung’s service centre and the warranty policy on their website provided guidelines that subtly direct customers to choose its repair service or to choose stores using authorised Samsung parts. </p>
<p>Another clause in the same section of the warranty is on replacement with unapproved parts. Samsung may charge for repair services or even restrict it if authorised parts weren’t used. </p>
<p>While Samsung is less prescriptive about repair services, customers need to take responsibility if the damage is occurred by seeking repairs outside the company’s preferred setting.</p>
<p>So when we see out-of-warranty repair costs displayed on Apple’s website – S$669 for iPhone 12 and iPhone 13, users will definitely want to keep an eye on how much Apple will price the self-service kits.</p>
<p>If Apple changes its policy, chances are it might introduce terms similar to Samsung’s – to entice users to stay within their management.</p>
<h2>APPLE REPAIRS AS A BRAND NEW PRODUCT AND EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>Make no mistake, even if this is a more customer-friendly policy change, Apple will still see advantages from a marketing standpoint.</p>
<p>This new initiative diversifies its intangible repair service by adding a tangible self-service repair product. Apple plans to distribute not just the authorised parts but also the manuals and tools for customers </p>
<p>Apple can also better segment customers seeking repairs, matching various needs with repair services and products. </p>
<p>An experience or culture of self-repair can be amplified and expand online Apple communities such as through sharing tips, teardowns and guided how-to videos.</p>
<p>Consumers who don’t enjoy reading fine disclaimer prints about their warranty or don’t mind paying Apple’s prices to avoid uncertainties with independent repair shops will return to the Apple store.</p>
<p>Such customer segmentation will likely reduce demands on Apple’s repair service personnel. Wait times will become more manageable in-store for those in need of serious repairs or for product purchases. </p>
<p>At the same time, Apple will maintain or even see an increase in its revenue stream by converting part of its manual-intensive labour into “authorised parts products.” </p>
<h2>EARLY DAYS FOR APPLE SELF-REPAIR, BUT BETTER THAN NONE</h2>
<p>This timely move may pre-empt potential regulatory action from the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) involving unlawful “right to repair” restrictions,” which made it official for the agency to investigate unlawful repair restrictions.</p>
<p>Whatever Apple’s intention, having this additional option for repairs is better than none. </p>
<p>Perhaps one day we’ll indeed be able to get our Apple products repaired easily and more affordably right in our neighbourhood stores.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Being a middle manager has been exhausting and miserable </h1>
<div> <p>Burned out supervisors sure could use some help from company leadership and subordinates, NUS Business School’s Yan Liuxin and Sam Yam Kai Chi highlight.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sam Yam Kai Chi </a> <a> Yan Liuxin </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Middle managers have borne the brunt of work during the pandemic. </p>
<p>They attended more virtual meetings to hear top management’s decisions and then to communicate these to subordinates. They ensured ground operations continued smoothly in compliance with changing regulations. </p>
<p>They motivated their employees, at a time when they themselves may feel overwhelmed. </p>
<p>So it’s little wonder they are feeling burned out. </p>
<p>This group also had the lowest scores in productivity and overall satisfaction. </p>
<h2>ORGANISATIONS MUST PAY ATTENTION TO HOW MIDDLE MANAGERS ARE DOING</h2>
<p>Do their organisations appreciate their hardships? We would urge more to take a harder look at how their middle managers are faring. </p>
<p>Much is at stake when such supervisors are the true engines of business who keep the massive machinery going and keep people together. </p>
<p>Doing so requires that they not only continue to engage and proactively guide direct reports, but also act as true partners to company leadership – all in a time of great uncertainty and potentially conflicting demands from various stakeholders.</p>
<p>Likewise, academic research has revealed the behaviours and leadership of middle managers are more accurate tell-tale signs of how well a unit is performing. </p>
<h2>BURNOUT CAN TRICKLE DOWN</h2>
<p>Managers unable to handle the transition well could conversely impact followers.</p>
<p>The idea that “e-managers” can sometimes turn unethical and abusive is not new. In the past when WFH is mostly a flexible work arrangement option that is voluntary, research has already raised ethical concerns for e-leaders. </p>
<p>For example, e-managers may load their remote workers with too much work, given the lack of a clear distinction between office hours and non-working hours. </p>
<p>Managers can also turn toxic in pushing subordinates to work harder and demanding they stay contactable even after work hours - practices harmful for employee well-being. </p>
<p>Perhaps they’re trying to seize back authority after a loss of direct sight of over their subordinates with remote working. </p>
<p>Research as early as 2002 already suggests that a major reason managers are reluctant to implement WFH is their fear of losing control and hesitance over delegating to their subordinates.</p>
<p>Managers unwilling to delegate may even become more controlling and autocratic to maintain a sense of power, especially if they face pressure to perform from top leadership. </p>
<p>Such counter-productive managerial behaviours arise when there is a lack of trust, a gap in expectations, and miscommunication between supervisors and employees. </p>
<h2>HOW WORKERS CAN DEAL WITH A DEMORALISED SUPERVISOR</h2>
<p>What if this sounds like your boss? Fret not.</p>
<p>Employees can fight back the gloom simply by being more proactive in seeking feedback from their manager. </p>
<p>Such exchanges allow both employees and managers to better understand each other’s goals, capabilities and motivations. </p>
<p>This two-way street of working has shown to build trust, respect, and mutual respect effectively.</p>
<p>Employees who proactively seek feedback reassure managers that they are attentive and motivated, tackling a common primary concern that a lack of active monitoring would lead workers to slack off.</p>
<p>A study on healthcare professionals in Wuhan, China during the first wave of the virus shows being active and choosing to shape conditions around one’s work during a crisis can boost mental well-being and resilience. </p>
<h2>TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS</h2>
<p>What can companies do to arrest depleting morale and improve the overall organisational climate? </p>
<p>One suggestion looms – giving people flexibility in where they work. </p>
<p>As Singapore potentially looks to ease restrictions after Oct 24, many may wonder how much freedom they have in deciding where to work – and whether they can make daily decisions about going back to the physical office or continue to telework. </p>
<p>Asynchronous work may be our reality. Few want a pure WFH arrangement or rigidity in having to lug themselves back to the office. </p>
<p>Of course, not all work and roles can afford to. But we hope people take comfort in the idea that there are some easy ways for employees and middle managers to stay positive amid the stress from the pandemic. </p>
<p>Of course, the pressure should not be placed on employees’ shoulders alone. In a post-COVID era, middle managers also need to explore and develop new skills to adapt to new leadership demands. </p>

<h1> Commentary: How do you react when your boss sends messages after office hours? </h1>
<div> <p>Many of us cannot “switch off” if we feel expected to be responsive after work and clearer boundaries for after-hours work communication can help, says business lecturer Jennifer Lajom.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jennifer Lajom </a> </div> </div>
<p>PERTH: “Working hours 8.30am to 5pm.” A clause stipulating office hours like this one is something we will probably find in most of our employment contracts.</p>
<p>But what goes glaringly unstated for many of us is the expectations of “after-hours availability” - the perceived expectations to accommodate work issues beyond regular hours. </p>
<p>Why do we still do that? </p>
<p>Most of us are aware that detaching from work and “mentally switching off” helps us recover used-up energy and prevents emotional exhaustion and burnout.</p>
<p>In Singapore, an industry-led coalition, the Alliance for Action, introduced in September new initiatives for better work-life harmony, including resources to guide companies in setting clearer boundaries for after-hours work communications.</p>
<p>And yet sometimes, we just can’t help it. </p>
<h2>WE SHOULD KNOW OUR OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH WORK</h2>
<p>Research shows employees vary in their approach to setting boundaries, based on how they think about their relationship with work and specifically, how interrelated work and life are.</p>
<p>Some workers are “integrators”, more eager to blur the boundaries of work and life and more agile in switching between tasks at any time.</p>
<p>Others are “segmenters” who seek to demarcate domains that compete for their time, managing responsibilities by allocating time blocks to keep them separate.</p>
<p>And when the integrators hold sway, you might find after-hours work communications creeping in insidiously.</p>
<h2>POWER IMBALANCE WHEN YOUR BOSS IS THE SENDER</h2>
<p>This is a scenario most of us are familiar with. Here’s a pre-COVID example: If your boss sends a work text or email after hours or during the weekend, don’t we all feel the same anxious expectation to reply quickly? </p>
<p>We naturally think the boss’ request is urgent and important and that not replying will surely downgrade our standing in their eyes. We could be seen as lazy, unreliable or even careless.</p>
<p>This is the phenomenon of “email urgency bias”. A recent study showed how senders and recipients have different expectations of how fast their emails should be addressed. </p>
<p>Recipients tend to overestimate expectations over how fast they respond. Many think a faster response indicates better performance and might end up seeing after-hours work communications as more stressful than senders intended them to be. </p>
<p>This can interfere with home responsibilities and disrupt precious time to rest and recover.</p>
<h2>HOW EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES CAN MANAGE AFTER-HOURS WORK COMMUNICATION</h2>
<p>Employees should not be left alone to exercise self-control on whether they should check work emails or reply to that weekend text. Senders, especially supervisors, need to meet them halfway.</p>
<p>When matters are not urgent, we sometimes shoot them off at odd hours for fear of forgetting to do so later or because we function better at night after the kids finally fall asleep.</p>
<p>Rather than overhaul the way both work or expect that integrators conform to the boundaries set by segmenters, setting expectations on how they respond to each other may hold the key to this wicked problem. </p>
<p>It can be as simple as senders mindfully being explicit about expected actions to their communications and timelines to reply. Or senders composing late-night emails and tapping on programmable functions to send them out during office hours. </p>
<p>Managers should also reflect on how existing habits of after-hours work communications can impact the organisation. </p>
<p>Are employees affected by unstated and possibly unfounded expectations? Could it demoralise staff and fuel attrition? To what extent do such communications actually contribute to performance and business goals?</p>
<p>Take a leaf from the Royal Plaza on Scotts, where workers can switch off under company policy by using the emoji of a smiley wearing sunglasses to respond to those trying to contact them after hours. </p>
<p>Such initiatives provide opportunities for both organisations and employees to mutually manage boundaries without compromising performance and outcomes.</p>
<h2>RESPECTING EMPLOYEES A WIN-WIN FOR COMPANIES</h2>
<p>Let’s also not forget work-related stressors can have knock-on effects on family relationships.</p>
<p>Studies have shown how ambiguous role expectations, time demand and work overload can contribute to tensions at home. But the silver lining is that having supportive managers has also been shown to reduce work-family conflict. </p>
<p>We often hear quips that there is no work-life balance, only work-life integration until there is only work. But it does not have to end up this way with clearer boundaries.</p>

<h1> Commentary: We need some give-and-take when it comes to after-hours work communications </h1>
<div> <p>Many of us are expected to be “on” 24/7 since shifting to working from home, but workers are pushing back and don’t want to be contacted after hours. Is this feasible? Mayank Parekh has suggestions.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Mayank Parekh </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: We are approaching 18 months since Singapore first implemented circuit breaker measures on Apr 7, 2020. This brought to a grinding halt the daily commute for many, as working from home became the default. </p>
<p>Initially, employees relished the flexibility and productivity supposedly increased. </p>
<p>But the true test soon became clear: The blurring of lines between work and home resulted in the realisation that mental wellness has been neglected all this while. </p>
<p>As companies course-corrected and employee well-being programmes rapidly gained popularity, mental wellness soon became a hot topic.</p>
<p>For employees working from home there is a recognition that remote work could lead to longer work days for employees without them realising it. Bloomberg reports that people who work from home clock in three hours more each day than before. </p>
<p>Employees are being encouraged to build regular breaks into their day, take personal time off, leave their desks when they needed to re-charge, plan time to socialise with co-workers and check in on one another. </p>
<p>But are they really zero-sum? There is a quiet stirring the answer is no. </p>
<p>Labour Member of Parliament Melvin Yong (Radin Mas) even suggested adopting a “right to disconnect” law to help employees have protected time to rest and recharge, citing that France is one country which successfully implemented such a legislation.</p>
<p>Mr Yong argued that rest is linked to worker productivity.</p>
<p>In reality, things are not so simple. There must be give and take on both sides. </p>
<p>Locally based employees of global multinational corporations that operate across time zones are often required to attend after-hours conference calls. Those in essential services need to always remain contactable. </p>
<p>This has nothing to do with a 24/7 work culture and everything to do with exigencies of service. For instance, working longer hours to meet a deadline or to attend to unforeseen crisis events are part of many people’s job scopes.</p>
<p>But this does not mean employees should simply accept that their work and personal lives will always meld and they have no choice in the matter. </p>
<p>Increasingly, workers are realising that while they may have to attend to after-hours calls, texts or emails, they want greater flexibility in their work hours.</p>
<p>For instance, some prefer to block out time during the day to focus on their kids as they juggle home-schooling or childcare, and then come back to complete work assignments in the evening hours. </p>
<p>But the challenge remains as to how much of this flexibility leads to an unhealthy expectation of staff to be “always on”? What is the threshold that makes this unacceptable? </p>
<p>Traditionally, the relationship between employer and employee is governed by an employment contract. The employer provides compensation and tenure in return for fulfillment of job responsibilities, usually supported by an employee handbook. </p>
<p>Employees, on the other hand, want to be treated fairly and with respect. They want the flexibility to decide where and when work gets done, so long as the work is done. They seek meaning and purpose in work that aligns to their personal values. </p>
<p>So how can the two meet in the middle? </p>
<p>Perhaps in addition to a traditional employment contract, companies should think about adding a social contract that binds both parties to an agreed set of rules of behaviour.</p>
<p>Patagonia, a 40-year-old American company that manufactures and retails outdoor clothing is one example. It offers flexible work hours and job sharing. </p>
<p>The founder, when he was in active leadership, took months off every year, during which he was unreachable. Granted, this may not be feasible nor practical in some contexts. </p>
<p>It means the leadership has to walk the talk: If bosses say they will respect a staff’s personal time off, it should be adhered to with as little exception as possible.</p>
<p>In other words, this give-and-take is critical to more sustainable long-term growth.</p>
<p>In today’s tight labour market, a compelling social contract may just be the “beyond profits” strategy needed in organisations to attract, retain and sustain talent. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Why companies don’t seem to get what employees really want </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Leong Chee Tung </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: By January next year, workplace regulations should ease and people should be able to return to physical offices. </p>
<p>But what has happened over the last one and a half years will mean that when companies examine and recalibrate a new work model, they may find things will never get back to business as usual.</p>
<p>On the surface, one would expect that employees would hold onto their current roles during a period of economic turmoil. </p>
<p>All contributing to the "Great Resignation Wave" that affects organisations globally.</p>
<h2>WHY MONEY ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH</h2>
<p>Even in the best of circumstances, high performers in many companies are likely to feel a sense of stagnation (unless there is proactive intervention from the employer), and this is only exacerbated by the effects of the pandemic. </p>
<p>The situational change caused by the pandemic has opened up new possibilities of work that most of us didn’t think possible before.</p>
<h4> <div>Listen to Leong Chee Tung explain what’s behind worker unhappiness despite greater attention on workplace well-being and what managers should do on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:</div> </h4>
<p>This rapid change in the working context has also led to a major shift in employee expectations - and not all organisations are aware of how to respond or what to offer to make them stay. </p>
<p>In the past, if an employee wanted to quit or move, leaders would rely on improving perks, benefits, and compensation as the primary instrument for retaining employees. Except that those things are not the only things that employees want anymore.</p>
<p>If this type of organisational response continues, it’s unlikely The Great Resignation Wave will abate anytime soon. What then are the underlying reasons for this employer-employee disconnect?</p>
<h2>GAP IN EXPECTATIONS AND THE SCIENCE OF LISTENING</h2>
<p>In a large, complex, and now increasingly remote organisational setup, it is almost impossible to get into the granular details of an individual employee’s needs, wants, and aspirations. </p>
<p>This is because most setups use conventional feedback tools like annual surveys or an informal “DIY” approach to troubleshoot the issues. </p>
<p>The problem with this is authentic feedback can fall through the cracks. A good example is the typical exit interview most companies conduct. </p>
<p>Companies which don’t conduct regular employee surveys tend to rely on exit interviews to understand the reason behind the employee resignation. But exit interviews are rarely reliable due to two things. </p>
<p>First, employees tend to be biased as they likely have mixed feelings about their departure - they might not feel invested in the company’s future anymore or they’re not being honest so they don’t “burn bridges”. </p>
<p>Second, the data captured is only from a point in time, and fails to reflect the employee’s full experience, especially the crucial months leading up to the exit decision.</p>
<p>This pattern recognition over time means companies can take meaningful action early to prevent voluntary resignation from other employees in the future.</p>
<p>But for this to happen, there must first be trust, without which no amount of talking will help - and this applies both ways. </p>
<h2>DEALING WITH COGNITIVE BIASES</h2>
<p>We come across instances where cognitive biases can blind leaders to what exactly is going on, even if they try to listen to their staff. </p>
<p>There are three key types of biases, based on numerous behavioural economics studies:</p>
<p>Inside view bias – where the leader or manager’s judgement is clouded by their close familiarity with the organisation and many years of tenure. Typically, this manifests as a feeling that “in my company, employees have always prioritised …”</p>
<p>All three biases share a common theme – there is a dissonance between how employees feel (and what they might even express), and what leaders choose to hear, understand, and act on. </p>
<p>Fostering communications between leaders and employees must be the number one priority for employers as offices reopen and employees go through yet another shift in their workplace experience. </p>
<p>The forecasted HR trends in 2022, is a good resource and it throws up several measures organisations can take to start improving work culture and employee experience in their workplaces. </p>
<p>At the top of their list if they want to avoid talent walking out is to adopt a proper listening strategy that is not a pencil-pushing exercise and to take meaningful follow-up actions as a result. </p>
<p>As offices reopen, the economy is revitalised, and new opportunities emerge, top talents across industries are at risk of attrition. Companies need to work doubly hard and start prioritising the employee experience. </p>
<p>Wages, benefits, future progression are important but ultimately, it comes down to how well companies can listen to their employees and how they can execute meaningful follow-up actions.</p>

<h1> Commentary: For workers, quitting a job is all about taking back control </h1>
<div> <p>Faced with the option of diving into the uncertainty of quitting one’s job, or the certainty of drowning in one’s work, many are choosing to jump, says documentary storyteller OKJ.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ong Kah Jing </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: "I've quit my job". </p>
<p>It's a statement that is becoming increasingly common in our society.</p>
<p>What was once a sign of resignation, and perhaps even something that was to be frowned upon, is now increasingly viewed as a necessary act to gain back control of one's life and circumstances.</p>
<p>Arguably, it is more intriguing that stereotypically kiasi (“scared to die”) Singaporeans are taking such leaps of faith with no guarantees and at great personal costs.</p>
<h2>QUIT YOUR JOB OR DROWN IN IT</h2>
<p>Taking a leap of faith at any life stage can be a vulnerable and harrowing experience. But one may be compelled to dive head-first into uncertainty when the alternative is the seeming certainty of drowning.</p>
<p>And drowning in the proverbial sense is all too familiar to many of us in this "new normal", with increasing demands from the workplace to adapt, pivot and upskill.</p>
<p>For a case in point of a job role that keeps expanding, look no further than teachers. Their workload has "more than doubled" since the pandemic, said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing in Parliament.</p>
<p>COVID-19 may have changed many facets of our lives, but it does not change the fact there are still only 24 hours in a day. </p>
<p>This pressure on our teachers – to go beyond their job scope and beyond quantifiable measures of sacrifice for the sake of people and country – has been felt amongst many other professions.</p>
<p>Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary revealed that 1,500 healthcare workers resigned in the first half of 2021 compared to about 2,000 annually pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>This is perhaps a sign of the road ahead and the phenomenon known as the "Great Resignation".</p>
<h2>BEHIND THE GREAT RESIGNATION</h2>
<p>An Oracle survey found nearly seven out of 10 Singaporeans felt this year to be the most stressful at work and a Kisi's Global Work-Life Balance Index ranked Singapore as the second most overworked city in the world in 2021, just behind Hong Kong. </p>
<p>Such sentiments are not missed by the Government, with Labour MP Melvin Yong proposing in October 2020 a "right to disconnect".</p>
<p>In a review of COVID-19’s impact on mental health, the Institute of Mental Health found 8.7 per cent of the surveyed Singapore population met the criteria for clinical depression, 9.4 per cent for anxiety, and 9.3 per cent for mid to severe stress.</p>
<p>It identified gaps such as sub-optimal mental health resources and a lack of trained professionals in meeting the demands of the workforce.</p>
<p>However, to simply pin the blame on COVID-19 for an impending "Great Resignation" may be misplaced, because while a blaze may be caused with a spark, it cannot be ignited without tinder.</p>
<h2>AN UNSTABLE BARTER BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND WORKERS</h2>
<p>Before the COVID-19 era, there had already been signs that pointed us towards a destabilising workplace culture in Singapore. </p>
<p>Working within one's stipulated working hours was agreed upon in contract but people were expected to answer the call of duty if work bled outside of 9am to 6pm.</p>
<h4> <div>Listen to HR experts explain what’s behind worker unhappiness despite greater attention on workplace well-being and what managers should do on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:</div> </h4>
<p>NUS Business School's Dr Wu Pei Chuan highlighted in a CNA commentary that job satisfaction has been low, at less than 40 per cent, since 2017.</p>
<p>One might think such sacrifices can be best compensated with wages and other material gains, but it seems the modern workforce values other aspects of life.</p>
<p>In a 2021 Singapore's 100 Leading Graduate Employers survey on 13,989 undergraduates and recent graduates, 61.5 per cent of its respondents believed that personal fulfilment is more important than a large pay slip.</p>
<p>But perhaps what is more telling is that 72.7 per cent of respondents are prepared to accept salary cuts in the course of their career.</p>
<p>A job may entail an exchange of value, but that value is no longer measured in mere dollars.</p>
<p>There seems to be a reckoning on the horizon as Singapore enters the third year of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Employers in Singapore are eager to attract and retain talent. They might be willing to meet the evolving needs and wants of their staff, as the demands and expectations of a hybrid workplace change too.</p>
<p>Quitting without any roles lined up will not be feasible for everyone and it’s up to individuals to weigh their options carefully.</p>
<p>But it is this pragmatism that should also spur us as a community to share our experiences from the “Great Resignation”. Because as we collectively grow from the lessons, the less naïve we will be about it.</p>
<p>All things considered, perhaps this is part of the light at the end of the tunnel that we are still navigating through.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Work colleagues need new ways to feel like a team again </h1>
<div> <p>It’s hard to feel like part of a team without the human connection of grabbing coffee and making small talk, and that may be bad news for innovation, says Sam Neo.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sam Neo </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Ever hit the office pantry for your third coffee break on a tough day and run into a colleague who offered much-needed insight on a challenging project? </p>
<p>Or someone who cheered you up chatting about weekend plans?</p>
<p>We used to complain we spent more time with colleagues than our own family, yet now we’re really starting to miss them.</p>
<p>Sure, we have plenty of work interactions – Zoom calls, Slack chats – but what we miss isn’t coffee or even the small talk, but the human connection in those moments. </p>
<p>Separated in our home offices today, we can no longer pop into our teammate’s cubicle to share ideas, ask for help and offer tips in exchange - worse still for new hires who’ve not met the team in real life. </p>
<p>At the start of the pandemic, employees focused on connecting with people they were already closer to and allowed more distant networks to fade. Their analysis showed that even such team interactions have since started to diminish.</p>
<p>Many of us just don’t really feel like part of a team anymore.</p>
<h2>BEDROCK OF INNOVATION AND SENSE OF BELONGING</h2>
<p>What happens then as hybrid working persists, with few chances for teams to meet and bond?</p>
<p>Innovation is the lifeblood of companies. We know that when people come together - to brainstorm, meet deadlines, or even share a joke – they hit on ways to solve problems and improve things. And companies flourish. </p>
<p>It’s for this reason Steve Jobs filled Apple’s Cupertino headquarters with large spaces and meeting nooks to maximise chance encounters and casual discussions. </p>
<p>Another Microsoft-commissioned study found European business leaders reported a decrease in innovation, possibly because it’s difficult for ideas to thrive when teammates feel disconnected from each other.</p>
<p>As one of the researchers put it: “When you lose connections, you stop innovating”.</p>
<p>Perhaps we took team bonding somewhat for granted before the coronavirus hit. We had plenty of opportunities for informal bonding in an office with face-to-face interactions where we pick up on social cues and conversational nuances. </p>
<p>According to pioneering research in the 1960s by psychologist Albert Mehrabian, at least 70 per cent of all communication is nonverbal. So it’s not surprising virtual conversations feel transactional and less spontaneous.</p>
<p>And who can forget those mandatory corporate team bonding events? They might seem contrived or superficial, but such activities let employees learn the best ways to communicate with our colleagues. </p>
<p>Teammates create shared experiences and references through non-work conversations – even in an escape room or craft workshop. Camaraderie gives us a sense of purpose and belonging.</p>
<p>Based on the research at MIT’s Human Dynamics Laboratory, socialisation can account for more than 50 per cent of “positive changes in communication patterns”.</p>
<h2>DELIBERATE EFFORT NEEDED FOR VIRTUAL BONDING</h2>
<p>For now, companies have had little choice but to engage teams virtually. So leaders must be deliberate about finding ways to spark informal interactions among employees.</p>
<p>One way is to leave a part of weekly meetings agenda-free or hold virtual coffee or “fireside” chats without any structured content to create a space for less formal interactions within teams.</p>
<p>At GitLab, a software company that remarkably has been working remotely since it started in 2014, employees can take “virtual coffee breaks” with colleagues over Slack. </p>
<p>They even use a bot called Donut to pair random teammates for coffee breaks, to capture the serendipity of the watercooler moment.</p>
<p>The Android Trello app’s engineering team meets for lunch over videoconferencing once a month and can claim up to US$25 to eat out, order in or even cook up a storm.</p>
<p>Managers at professional services company Deloitte Singapore are encouraged to organise something to “energise everybody at the start of the day”, such as online yoga sessions. </p>
<p>Prudential Singapore also has a “Focused Friday” since 2019, encouraging employees not to arrange afternoon meetings and use the time instead to focus on learning, innovation or personal wellness.</p>
<p>The trick looks to be this: Being deliberate and disciplined about setting aside time to form new virtual rituals and replace the in-person ones we’ve lost.</p>
<h2>BUILDING TEAMS IN THE HYBRID WORK ERA</h2>
<p>In my experience speaking to HR leaders across the region, there is one clear consensus - nothing beats physical interaction. A LinkedIn poll I recently did showed employees preferred the same.</p>
<p>Humans crave connection and we do it best in person, especially after a prolonged period of restrictions without a clear view of the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>If and when employees return to the office with some caution, leaders must be equally deliberate in creating opportunities for physical meetups.</p>
<p>What works is when activities are truly independent of work. It signals to employees they are allowed to slow down, forget about deadlines and organisational charts to focus on building genuine connections.</p>
<p>One pre-pandemic experience I recall was a tea appreciation session. I started out sceptical at first but ended up thoroughly enjoying the deep conversations and getting to know my colleagues more than I ever could at work.</p>
<p>If leaders are insincere in helping teams, you can bet employees sense it immediately. </p>
<p>Employees may feel obligated to turn up, to avoid looking bad or being passed over for recognition later, but they’ll just get the activities over and done with – a waste of time and opportunities for actual bonding.</p>
<p>Good organisations stand out because they take the time to understand their employees’ needs – the introverted ones may be more energised by remote working, while the extroverted can’t wait to see everyone back in the office.</p>
<p>So, though Singapore maintains restrictions on large gatherings and a default work-from-home arrangement for now, all hope is not lost. </p>

<h1> Commentary: How to spot the slackers at work winging it </h1>
<div> <p>We are bad at assessing others’ skills and performance but true slackers will always slip up, says the Financial Times' Emma Jacobs.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Emma Jacobs </a> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: “This one is going to be pretty special,” teased the Australian reporter’s Instagram post. How right he was.</p>
<p>Accompanying a television crew to interview Adele, the British pop star, he discovered too late that he had missed an email containing the preview of her <a>new album, 30.</a></p>
<p>Talking about the album was the entire reason for their encounter. “This is the most important email I have ever missed,” he said. The interview was binned.</p>
<p>The story emerged on the same day that UK prime minister Boris Johnson delivered a speech ostensibly about the UK creative industries to the CBI, the UK’s largest employers’ group.</p>
<p>Instead, he lost his place in his notes — pleading “forgive me” — and swerved into talking about Peppa Pig. I’m no expert on public speaking but asking the audience for forgiveness might be an error.</p>
<p>As examples of winging it go, these were both spectacular fails, criticised for being unprofessional and disrespectful.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> <a> Adele tops UK music charts record-breaking comeback album "30" </a> </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>We’ve all been at meetings, watched panels or seen speeches where participants are bluffing, having failed to do their homework.</p>
<p>However, beware the faux-wingers (FWs). Anyone who has been to school will be all too familiar with the person who rocks up to an exam claiming not to have done any revision, concealing the fact they studied hard.</p>
<p>Falling for an FW’s spin is a mistake that might cause you to fall flat on your face. One classic FW tool is spontaneity. It looks effortless but can be hard work.</p>
<p>I called an FW friend I’ve known since university, where he would procrastinate by evaluating different types of biscuits. Today he is a senior barrister.</p>
<p>Another friend prepares sports stars to go on television. He works with two sportspeople (frustratingly, he won’t name and shame) who have very different attitudes.</p>
<p>One puts the work in and appears fluent and natural at press conferences, the other puts no effort in and clumsily and inaccurately tries to parrot the words he has been fed.</p>
<h2>NO EXCUSE FOR FAILING TO COVER THE BASICS</h2>
<p>Only to see him do exactly the same thing — and the same speech — at another function.</p>
<p>On many occasions, the prime minister would appear to be a classic FW. Those at the top of their professional game may be permitted some genuine winging, not needing as much prep because they are experienced.</p>
<p>But as demonstrated by Johnson’s recent performance (which appears to be a case of genuine winging) and the Adele interviewer, there is no excuse for an experienced professional who fails to cover the basics.</p>
<p>It can be hard to tell the fake from the genuine winger. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, an organisational psychologist who has researched confidence, says we are not very good at assessing performance, either in ourselves or others.</p>
<p>And, as he says, the more “inept you are, the less good you are at evaluating your performance”. (In other words, the Dunning Kruger effect.)</p>
<p>One of the paradoxes of the modern world of work, Chamorro-Premuzic says, is that “the more complex, skilled and well-paid your job is, the harder it is for others to tell if you are performing well or not”.</p>
<p>In other words, greater complexity makes performance harder to judge.</p>
<p>Those who are overconfident often end up doing too little work: They might pull it off, but there is a strong chance they won’t successfully wing it.</p>
<p>“Having less confidence can enhance performance as it means you prepare and study”, Chamorro-Premuzic points out.</p>
<p>Which for all the worriers out there (like me) is a great comfort.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Burnout isn’t just exhaustion. Workers can also feel cynical or inadequate </h1>
<div> <p>Employers, take note: There’s more to burnout which corporate wellness initiatives alone cannot solve, say SMU researchers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tina Ng </a> <a> Andree Hartanto </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Nike, LinkedIn and Bumble gave workers a paid week off. Citigroup banned work calls on Friday. Scotland is set to trial a four-day work week without a loss of pay.</p>
<p>Evidently, the huge wave of resignations spurred by the pandemic has forced companies to confront burnout, implementing “burnout breaks” to curb the loss of productivity that comes with working too much.</p>
<p>Though initiatives like “mental health weeks” are widely appreciated, they merely scratch the surface and do not solve the issue. To truly put out the flames of burnout, a precise diagnosis of the problem is critical.</p>
<p>This is especially true in Singapore, the world’s most fatigued country where one in two workers feels exhausted and 58 per cent feel overworked, according to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index published in May.</p>
<h2>NOT JUST ABOUT STRESS AND WORKLOAD </h2>
<p>We might think burnout is the same as exhaustion – the result of sitting at our desk for too long, attending too many Zoom meetings and never catching a break.</p>
<p>But there’s more to it. Researchers Christina Maslach and Michael P Leiter found that besides exhaustion, burnout comprises cynicism, where you dread and detach emotionally from work, along with inefficacy, where you feel incompetent and stuck.</p>
<p>More recent psychological research highlights the differences in how people experience burnout.</p>
<p>Exhausted employees still believe in themselves and their work, but are simply too lethargic to attend to it.</p>
<p>Those struggling with inefficacy have enough energy and care about their job, but don’t feel validated by their contributions.</p>
<p>These are different from those whose burnout experience is dominated by cynicism, where the problem lies in them feeling disconnected from the job.</p>
<p>If exhaustion is the main symptom of burnout, organisations and workers should focus on managing workload and building a culture of rest.</p>
<p>This state of persistent fatigue arises when employees have too much to do, with too few resources and little control over their environment.</p>
<p>An always-on, 24/7 organisational culture drains employees and give them little opportunity to recharge. When this kind of overload is a chronic job condition, employees find themselves too depleted to do even simple tasks.</p>
<p>To better align employees’ job demands and capabilities, set reasonable expectations. Give employees enough time or information for tasks.</p>
<p>Providing support and flexibility, for instance in work hours, can also make employees feel a greater sense of control over their work. </p>
<p>Reducing job demands is only half of the picture when it comes to relieving exhaustion. For employees to feel truly recharged, giving time to enjoy leisure activities is key.</p>
<p>But this is often not enough. If the overall work culture promotes presenteeism, employees will be discouraged from taking leave or utilising wellness perks.</p>
<h2>SUPPORT EMPLOYEES’ GOOD WORK</h2>
<p>Another form of worker burnout is feeling unproductive, unaccomplished and incompetent. They do not feel confident they are contributing meaningfully.</p>
<p>Bosses need to provide regular and constructive feedback so employees are certain they’re on the right path. Employers must ensure contributions are seen and valued.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean doling out constant praise, but giving credit where it’s due.</p>
<p>A study by renowned psychologists Adam Grant and Francesca Gino found people thanked for their efforts experienced significant increases to their self-worth and social value – an antidote to the feelings of inadequacy.</p>
<p>The study also found that gratitude made people more trusting and willing to help each other, which can bolster employee’s abilities to contribute meaningfully.</p>
<p>Writing the gratitude letter encouraged people to focus their attention on what was going well which they might have taken for granted. Create spaces in the office that promotes the voluntary, spontaneous expression of gratitude for example.</p>
<p>This could take the form of an online “Gratitude Wall”, where employees can express appreciation for their peers, whether it’s for their help on an overwhelming project or simply for checking in.</p>
<h2>REMOVE STRESSORS FROM THE WORKPLACE</h2>
<p>If employees dread and withdraw from work, it’s likely the result of a work environment pervaded by interpersonal conflict, unfairness and lack of participation.</p>
<p>On a deeper level, employees may emotionally detach from work because they do not feel like what they’re doing aligns with their values. </p>
<p>When stressors like discrimination and unfairness are the reason for employee’s withdrawal, promoting a fair and inclusive work culture is key.</p>
<p>Employees should also be able to report discrimination and bias. Though employers will not be able to eliminate every grievance and argument among colleagues, they still need to enforce mechanisms for reporting and resolving such issues. </p>
<p>By removing such stressors, employees will be better able to focus on their work.</p>
<p>Moreover, employers should support employees’ efforts in job crafting: Changing aspects of their job to better align with their needs, abilities and preferences while still staying in the same role.</p>
<p>By reframing office tasks and relationships, job crafting makes work more meaningful to us, bolstering our sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. </p>
<p>Workers should speak to their supervisors to find out how they can focus on tasks that involve their passions. For example, a dentist who values educating others could devote more attention to educating patients on healthy dental habits.</p>
<p>Cultivating relationships is another means of job crafting. For instance, workers can be asked to coach new or less experienced colleagues, which can foster higher quality connections and make work feel more fulfilling.</p>
<p>Making provisions for employee satisfaction and wellbeing has never been more pertinent. It is especially important for employers to support those who see a future for themselves in the organisation but are hindered by burnout.</p>
<p>For employees who do choose to leave, exit interviews are a useful research tool. Gaining feedback will enable employers to adjust employee benefits and corporate culture to yield long-term employee engagement and high performance.</p>
<p>It is encouraging that more attention has been paid to mental health since the pandemic. That said, we need a shift in perspective that emphasises the individuality of our experiences to stem the dissatisfaction we feel at work.</p>
<p>Rather than adopt one-size-fits-all approach to burnout, we need a human-centred one that encompasses an accurate diagnosis and targeted strategies.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why workers are seduced by the cult of ‘optimal busyness’ </h1>
<div> <p>An attraction toward busyness may be seen as a status symbol of sorts, but researchers found this drive went far deeper - the buzzing feeling was itself inherently addictive.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Joonas Rokka </a> <a> Ioana Lupu </a> </div> </div>
<p>LYON, France: The consultant was on her way to a demanding client meeting when she realised she had had a miscarriage. But she did not interrupt her day. Instead, she went on to complete the meeting at her client’s offices.</p>
<p>The woman, who works at an elite professional service firm in London, was one of the professionals we interviewed as part of our recent study of the work life of highly educated professionals.</p>
<p>When we began our study in 2014, we set out to investigate how workers in demanding jobs managed their work-life balance.</p>
<p>But soon after we started the interviews, we realised we needed to revise our focus, because it became clear that our interviewees were not seeking to balance their work and private life.</p>
<p>Instead, we found these workers were driven by a compulsion to be busy at all times, which meant they were also willing to sacrifice their family lives in important ways.</p>
<p>As one of our participants told us: “You become a little bit of a junkie for a deadline and work. It’s quite hard to switch off”.</p>
<p>While a common narrative in research and the media is that people want to slow down their lifestyles these days, our findings reveal a strikingly different story.</p>
<p>The desire to work fewer hours among our interviewees was uncommon. Instead they were in pursuit of something else: “Optimal busyness”.</p>
<h2>THE QUEST FOR OPTIMAL BUSYNESS</h2>
<p>We interviewed 81 people who work in some of the biggest consulting and law firms in London. Half of the workers were women, half were men, and nearly all of them had at least one child.</p>
<p>All of the professionals we interviewed suffered from time famine – constantly having too little time to do what they had to do.</p>
<p>To deal with this problem, they were drawn toward a compelling state of busyness, one in which they felt in control of their time.</p>
<p>We call this “optimal busyness” – an attractive, accelerated temporal experience that is difficult to achieve and maintain.</p>
<p>Overall, we identified three different kinds of experiences of busyness: Optimal busyness, excessive busyness, and quiet time.</p>
<p>Optimal busyness is an elating and enjoyable temporal flow in which the workers felt at their best and most productive.</p>
<p>This buzzing feeling gave them adrenaline and positive energy, which was exciting. When they were in this state, they felt nothing could stop them, and that they could, for example, save a company from going bankrupt.</p>
<h2>IS BUSYNESS A BADGE OF HONOUR?</h2>
<p>Such an attraction toward busyness can be understood as a kind of status symbol or badge of honour, a phenomenon that has been described in previous research.</p>
<p>But we found that this drive went far deeper than mere social signalling. The desired buzzing feeling was itself inherently addictive. One participant told us:</p>
<p>“I love the intensity of it, usually. I get a buzz out of it, that’s why I do the job that I do. I like it.”</p>
<p>When the energising buzz of optimal busyness continued for too long without break, it became unbearable.</p>
<p>Connection with family was often the first casualty. One participant went on a work trip and despite promises to call her family in the evening failed to do so – for the entire week.</p>
<p>We observed a similar pattern in the case of quiet time – that is, when the busy work period was suddenly interrupted by downtime, or typically, a holiday period.</p>
<p>Quiet time was experienced as something undesirable and meaningless. It also caused boredom and even depression. The thought of a slower pace at work was a source of concern. </p>
<p>One told us: “When I don’t have deadlines I get bored. I’m much less productive because I like working on adrenaline.”</p>
<p>As well as interviewing busy knowledge workers, we also spoke to some of their partners. One partner said: “My wife is terrible. If she wakes up to go to toilet in the middle of the night, she checks her emails – even at 3am.”</p>
<h2>THE CONDITIONS FOR OPTIMAL BUSYNESS</h2>
<p>On one hand, workplaces produce the conditions that drive the quest for optimal busyness.</p>
<p>Busy working culture soon absorbed them and normalised unnatural working hours.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we found individuals themselves were also creating the conditions for optimal busyness. Some boosted their capacity to work with coffee, drugs or physical exercise.</p>
<p>Others went as far as isolating themselves in a hotel room so they could work without interruptions.</p>
<p>A common strategy was for workers to think: “This is only a short period and once I am through I will relax”. For most, the relaxation never happened.</p>
<p>For decades, scholars have observed the persistence of long working hours, overwork, and time famine. These problems are ingrained in many professional work contexts, not only in consulting, audit or law firms.</p>
<p>Academia is another striking example: Studies consistently show that researchers’ poor mental well-being is linked to increased performance expectations, competitive ethos, and meticulous metrics that produce non-stop busyness.</p>
<p>The individuals we studied, albeit in an arguably extreme context, were often unaware what was happening to them. </p>
<p>Perhaps it is time for us all to reflect on how and why we are so addicted to feeling busy.</p>

<h1> Commentary: In Singapore, talented workers can’t wait to quit. They’re just waiting for right offer </h1>
<div> <p>The Great Resignation Wave is more a Great Reshuffling of Talent. Organisations must keep their best engaged with new opportunities, says ADP’s Yvonne Teo.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Yvonne Teo </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: You know what’s a real generational change when it comes to work life? The fact that long gone are the days when employees began their careers at and retired from the same company. </p>
<p>On average, people will change jobs 12 times in their lifetime in the US.</p>
<p>While the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19 initially had employees holding off on career changes, many are now taking the plunge, almost two years into the pandemic. </p>
<p>This wave of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs, dubbed the “Great Resignation”, has been described as a backlog of pent-up resignations. </p>
<p>At a first glance, Singapore appears to be bucking the global trend. Many businesses have been spared from dramatic spikes in turnover rates. In fact, resignation rates in the first two quarters of 2021 have stayed below pre-pandemic rates. </p>
<p>But if global trends hold true, it’s only a matter of time before Singapore sees a new wave of resignations soon. </p>
<p>To fill vacant roles, employers may consider hiring remote overseas talent. Others may take a long-term approach to nurture local talent, by hiring and training fresh graduates or less experienced employees.</p>
<h2>REALITY REMAINS THAT WORKERS FEEL DISENGAGED</h2>
<p>Left unchecked, low engagement is an early indicator of eventual burnout and high turnover rates. This pattern is also observed in other research.</p>
<p>In ADP’s annual workplace survey, People at Work 2021, Singapore workers expected themselves to stay at their current organisation for an average of 3.35 years, down from 3.61 the previous year. </p>
<p>Younger millennials, aged 25 to 34, had one of the largest decreases in their projected employment term, from 3.5 to 3.05 years.</p>
<p>The same survey found that approximately one in three respondents from this age group were more interested in contract work, due to concerns about the relative security of traditional full-time employment.</p>
<p>Battered by two years of pandemic-related anxiety, along with unclear boundaries and expectations from bosses during WFH, experts have also suggested that “apocalyptic thinking” could be driving employees to quit. </p>
<p>There are common threads running throughout employees’ reasons for resigning, including the ever-present spectre of burnout – leading employees to pursue deeper meaning and satisfaction with life.</p>
<p>All these mean the Singaporean workforce seems to be handling the challenges thrown their way, but are largely “going through the motions” and not especially engaged at work.</p>
<p>Employees are dreaming of carving out new career paths for themselves, and they are more willing than ever to take risks along the way.</p>
<h2>THE GREAT RESHUFFLING OF TALENT</h2>
<p>Perhaps a new way to look at The Great Resignation would be as a reshuffling of talent - a natural progression from fast-tracking our workforce’s learning and development.</p>
<p>Rather than seeing high turnover rates as a threat, employers could view this as a sign that employees are hungry for fulfilment and career growth defined on their own terms, and figure out how to provide these new areas of job satisfaction.</p>
<p>For employees who are seeking new horizons, companies should offer breadth, depth and accessibility in learning and development opportunities. Healthy challenges can prevent boredom at work. </p>
<p>Organisations should create opportunities for employees to advance their career, be it through “stretch assignments”, specially assigned to push employees beyond their comfort zone, or job rotations to try out new areas of work.</p>
<p>One strategy that businesses can deploy to keep things dynamic for stagnated teams is to introduce exchange programmes, where employees swap ideas and pick up new skills for projects or roles usually handled by other colleagues.</p>
<p>This keeps ideas fresh, encourages greater collaboration, and could open new career paths or responsibilities within the same organisation.</p>
<h2>GROWING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEARNING</h2>
<p>Adequate training and support must be provided in the bid to increase productivity, and even when employees are able to take on a wider range of tasks with their newfound skills, employers should take caution that they aren’t being overburdened.</p>
<p>About two in three Singapore survey respondents in ADP’s People at Work 2021 survey indicated that they had taken on more responsibilities or taken on new roles due to COVID-19 disruption. </p>
<p>Yet, almost a third (27 per cent) of these respondents stated that they received no additional training or renumeration from their employers.</p>
<p>It is vital for companies to understand that higher productivity should not result from additional work hours, but from a combination of improved processes, effective upskilling, and respect for employees’ well-being.</p>
<p>Employees too should feel appropriately appreciated for their work. In addition to competitive salaries, the most attractive employee entitlements in a post-pandemic workplace will offer personal autonomy of one’s work-life balance.</p>
<h2>GIVE EMPLOYEES FLEXIBILITY IN TAKING LEAVE</h2>
<p>Take annual leave for example. With snap COVID-19 restrictions derailing plans and schedules, and possibly creating last-minute work tasks, employees need greater flexibility in choosing when to take breaks. </p>
<p>Employees should be assured of having a good support system where teammates can willingly and easily cover each other’s work demands. </p>
<p>Companies need to build a culture of trust and collaboration that empowers employees. Actively consulting employees on working processes – including leave approval and task allocation – is a great opportunity to build such a culture.</p>
<p>The highly volatile post-pandemic era demands greater agility from both employees and employers. Employees are searching for purpose-driven careers that offer flexibility and fulfilment. </p>
<p>Employers who can support this hunger for growth within their organisations will be able to build a highly driven and engaged workforce – one with a greater staying power. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Why COP26 summit ended in failure and disappointment </h1>
<div> <p>A last-minute wording change has severely hampered global efforts over the past two weeks to set sustainable climate goals, “phasing down” instead of “phasing out” coal, says two climate researchers.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Robert Hales </a> <a> Brendan Mackey </a> </div> </div>
<p>BRISBANE: After two hard-fought weeks of negotiations, the Glasgow climate change summit is, at last, over.</p>
<p>All 197 participating countries adopted the so-called Glasgow Climate Pact, despite an 11th hour intervention by India in which the final agreement was watered down from “phasing out” coal to “phasing down”.</p>
<p>At the summit’s outset, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged countries to “keep the goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius alive”, to accelerate the decarbonisation of the global economy and to phase out coal.</p>
<p>So, was COP26 a failure? If we evaluate this using the summit's original stated goals, the answer is yes, it fell short.</p>
<p>Two big ticket items weren’t realised: Renewing targets for 2030 that align with limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, and an agreement on accelerating the phase-out of coal.</p>
<p>But among the failures, there were important decisions and notable bright spots. So let’s take a look at the summit’s defining issues.</p>
<p>The goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius this century, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Catastrophic impacts will be unleashed beyond this point, such as sea level rise and more intense and frequent natural disasters.</p>
<p>But new projections from Climate Action Tracker show even if all COP26 pledges are met, the planet is on track to warm by 2.1 degrees Celsius – or 2.4 degrees Celsius if only 2030 targets are met.</p>
<p>Despite the Australian government’s recent climate announcements, its 2030 target remains the same as in 2015. If all countries adopted such meagre near-term targets, global temperature rise would be on track for up to 3 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Technically, the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit is still within reach because, under the Glasgow pact, countries are asked to update their 2030 targets in a year’s time. However, as Sharma said, “the pulse of 1.5 is weak”.</p>
<p>And as Australia’s experience shows, domestic politics rather than international pressure is often the force driving climate policy. So there are no guarantees Australia or other nations will deliver greater ambition in 2022.</p>
<p>India’s intervention to change the final wording to “phase down” coal rather than “phase out” dampens the urgency to shift away from coal.</p>
<p>India is the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, after China and the United States. The country relies heavily on coal, and coal-powered generation is expected to grow by 4.6 per cent each year to 2024.</p>
<p>India was the most prominent objector to the “phase out” wording, but also had support from China.</p>
<p>And US climate envoy John Kerry argued that carbon capture and storage technology could be developed further, to trap emissions at the source and store them underground.</p>
<p>Carbon capture and storage is a controversial proposition for climate action. It is not proven at scale, and we don’t yet know if captured emissions stored underground will eventually return to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>And around the world, relatively few large-scale underground storage locations exist.</p>
<p>And it’s hard to see this expensive technology ever being cost-competitive with cheap renewable energy.</p>
<p>In a crucial outcome, COP26 also finalised rules for global carbon trading, known as Article 6 under the Paris Agreement.</p>
<p>However under the rules, the fossil fuel industry will be allowed to “offset” its carbon emissions and carry on polluting. Combined with the “phasing down” change, this will see fossil fuel emissions continue.</p>
<p>Despite the shortcomings, COP26 led to a number of important positive outcomes. The world has taken an unambiguous turn away from fossil fuel as a source of energy.</p>
<p>And the 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming target has taken centre stage, with the recognition that reaching this target will require rapid, deep and sustained emissions reductions of 45 per cent by 2030, relative to 2010 levels.</p>
<p>What’s more, the pact emphasises the importance to mitigation of nature and ecosystems, including protecting forests and biodiversity.</p>
<p>This comes on top of a side deal struck by Australia and 123 other countries promising to end deforestation by 2030.</p>
<p>The pact also urges countries to fully deliver on an outstanding promise to deliver US$100 billion per year for five years to developing countries vulnerable to climate damage.</p>
<p>It also emphasises the importance of transparency in implementing the pledges.</p>
<p>Nations are also invited to revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>In support of this, it was agreed to hold a high-level ministerial roundtable meeting each year focused on raising ambition out to 2030.</p>
<p>The US and China climate agreement is also cause for cautious optimism.</p>
<p>Despite the world not being on track for the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal, momentum is headed in the right direction. And the mere fact that a reduction in coal use was directly addressed in the final text signals change may be possible.</p>
<p>But whether it comes in the small window we have left to stop catastrophic climate change remains to be seen.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Singapore’s plans to import clean electricity could meet resistance abroad </h1>
<div> <p>Importing electricity helps Singapore meet energy needs and climate goals, but such plans are contingent on benign political conditions within exporting countries, say researchers.</p> </div>
