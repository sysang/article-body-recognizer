<p>Nutrients fuel the body and brain's energy needs. This fuel allows humans to function and flourish—to breathe, to speak, to play, to learn, and to reproduce.</p>
<p>Humans evolved under very different circumstances than today; sustenance was often in short supply, and it was advantageous to snatch up sugars and fats that could provide a boost of energy.</p>
<p>These evolutionary roots are at odds with the modern world, in which food is, in many places, overabundant. Cravings can be difficult to control. Rules can be difficult to maintain.</p>
<p>Food also carries cultural, social, and economic weight. Holidays and gatherings, for example, highlight food as the main event, which can change the meaning of a meal.</p>
<p>Food can elicit an array of psychological challenges, often related to weight management, eating disorders, and body image. Yet there are numerous ways to address these challenges and cultivate a healthy lifestyle.</p>

<h2> Healthy Approaches to Diet and Weight Management </h2>
<p>Many people struggle with diet and weight management at times. But this relationship isn’t set in stone—there are always ways to change and improve it.</p>

<a>positive relationship with food</a> often involves shifting your thoughts and behaviors. First, become aware of why you are eating. If you are eating due to

<h2> Struggles of Diet, Weight, and Body Image </h2>
<p>A good diet contributes to optimal health, but not everyone has a positive relationship with food. Some people battle with their plate, with body image challenges and obsessions joining the fight.</p>
<p>The act of eating is often rife with strong emotions like boredom, stress, and guilt. Looking for relief, people may gradually adopt unhealthy patterns, such as a cycle of on-and-off, short-term dieting, emotional eating, or disordered eating.</p>
<div> <h3> What causes emotional eating? </h3> </div>

<a>anxiety</a> about diseases or food purity. The difference between anorexia and orthorexia, some argue, is that those with anorexia primarily

<a>masks a traditional eating disorder</a>.
<h2> The Best Foods for the Brain </h2>
<p>A healthy brain is fed by a balanced diet and a variety of nutrients. But a few foods provide a special boost.</p>
<p>Through omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins, these foods play a role in maintaining memory and concentration as well as staving off cognitive decline, stroke, and neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s.</p>
<div> <h3> What is nutritional psychiatry? </h3> </div>
<a>Nutritional psychiatry</a> asks questions such as how to create a healthy diet, which foods could be added or removed from a diet to benefit mental health, and the relationship between the
<a>microbiome</a> and mental illness.

<div> <h3> Can certain foods protect against dementia? </h3> </div>

<a>double</a> that of women who earned college degrees.
<a> in unsafe behaviors</a> like carrying a weapon.
<a>several</a> mechanisms that explain why the amount of education a person receives is such an important determinant of well-being. Take, for example, why better grades seem to lead to better life choices. Robert Hahn and Benedict Truman
<a>health benefits</a> of education are compounded by the health benefits of
<a>income</a>, with the two being highly correlated. More education means greater access to economic resources; people with a college degree can expect to earn nearly $1 million
<a>Slowly</a>. In 2015, the U.S. graduation rate hit
<a>82 percent</a>, and American students are
<a>performing better</a> in math and science, though they remain in the middle of the pack internationally. The problem is that these positive outcomes are
<a>not being shared</a> by everyone. The achievement gap
<a> between racial groups</a>, particularly
<a>between white and black students</a>, remains wide. This is reflected in recent ACT scores, where black students performed at a significantly lower level than many of their peers, often failing to earn minimum,
<a>less likely</a> to graduate than their white peers. There are several ways to account for these troubling disparities. The first is economic. Data have shown
<a>a correlation</a> between racial achievement gaps and the racial socioeconomic divide; gaps between white and black students tend to be
<a>wider</a> in wealthier communities. An
<a>analysis</a> found that sixth graders in wealthier school districts are four grade levels above children in poorer districts. There are also social reasons for these gaps. Black children are
<a>more likely</a> to have difficult childhoods; the attendant challenges are compounded by the fact that the mothers and fathers of these children are
<a>less likely</a> than white parents to have degrees themselves.
<a>emotional self-regulation</a>, and interactional abilities, are critical components of health.” This is very much in keeping with the World Health Organization’s

<p>Mental disorders account for a significant portion of the global disease burden.</p>
<a>About 15 percent</a> of the world’s diseases are mental illnesses. The challenge of mental disorders is especially acute in the U.S., where an estimated
<a>one in five adults</a>—about 44 million people—experience mental illness each year. Depression is one of the most common mental illnesses, affecting
<a>an estimated 300 million people </a>around the world. Depression is so widespread that the WHO has projected that, by 2030, it will be the leading cause of the global disease burden.
<a>differences of opinion</a> within the mental health field about the characteristics of these disorders, as well as
<a>changes</a> to how we study them across populations and
<p>Mental disorders are shaped by contemporary social conditions.</p>
<a>our childhood experiences</a>, and our access to material resources. Income,
<a>for example</a>, is one of the most significant influences on health and is linked to a number of common mood-
<a>From 2009 to 2013</a>, 8.7 percent of people with annual incomes below
<a>the federal poverty line</a> reported experiencing “serious psychological distress,” compared with the lower levels of psychological distress reported by individuals with higher annual incomes.
<a>discrimination</a>, which can undermine the health of often-targeted groups, like
<a>racial minorities</a>, and the LGBT population. For example, state laws allowing businesses to discriminate against
<a>same-sex</a> couples have been linked with

<a>higher mortality rates</a> than people without them, which can be linked to co-occurring physical challenges, like heart disease, diabetes, and HIV. Mental disorders also drive mortality risk through their link to
<a>over 800,000 lives</a> around the world each year. The lifelong threat of mental illnesses points to the importance of addressing these diseases early, while the brain is
<a>linked</a> with an up to 4.5 times higher risk of
<a>psychiatric</a> problems, and low birth weight (less than five pounds.) has been linked with a 2.5 times greater risk of adult psychiatric problems. Exposure to toxic substances in early life,
<a>such as lead</a>, can also threaten mental health—higher blood lead levels
<a>have been associated with</a> a higher risk of major depressive disorder and panic disorder in young adults. By preventing these hazardous childhood exposures, we could do much to improve mental health.
