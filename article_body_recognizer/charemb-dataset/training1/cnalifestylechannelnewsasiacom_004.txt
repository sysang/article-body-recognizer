<h1> How to win over fast food-loving kids with your homecooking </h1>
<div> <p>In this week’s Chubby Hubby, Portly Papa column, Aun Koh finds out that the fight to keep the kids from getting addicted to fast food is real – just be careful about creating a little food snob.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aun Koh </a> </div> </div>
<p>Like every other kid in the country, my own tiny terrors have a thing for visiting certain fast food franchises. Which drives my wife and me nuts.</p>
<p>Because all kids love pizza, my wife’s relative ordered a whole bevy of pies from a local pizza delivery service. To their credit, the pies did smell pretty good. But they didn’t look all that appetising.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Chubby Hubby, Portly Papa: School holidays are extremely good for business</a></h3>
<p>“It’s pizza, honey,” said mama. “You like pizza. Have a bite.” He did (I wouldn’t have). Then he spat it out and declared, “This pizza’s not good!” in a very, very loud voice.</p>
<p>Looking around, I did notice that none of the other kids seemed to have a problem with the ’za and were digging in excitedly. Suffice it to say, we made a very quick, very sheepish exit.</p>
<p>Of course, what I have never told T1 is that the burgers we make at home are chock full of what we call at home “secret vegetables”. Because my little monsters, like so many others, are averse to greens, I like to hide them in their foods.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was able to convince her that we could play a game and keep it a secret from her gor gor.</p>

<p>They looked the trays up and down, and all around, and looked back at me. I could tell something was wrong. Yet, I was sure I made everything perfectly.</p>
<p>“Papa,” piped up T2, “But where are our toys?”</p>

<h1> Commentary: A tax on sugary drinks not enough on their own to halt obesity in Asia </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Asit K Biswas </a> <a> Kris Hartley </a> </div> </div>
<p>Governments are striking back at obesity risk factors, including unhealthy foods. Singapore, which might have as many as one million residents with diabetes by 2050, now requires soda producers to <a>reduce sugar content</a>.</p>
<p>Obesity and other lifestyle-related diseases have now become a “silent" long-term challenge that will cost governments in healthcare liabilities and lost productivity.</p>
<p>But improving public health requires more than piecemeal legislation: Governments must promote lifestyle changes through education and improve access to healthy foods.</p>
<p>NOT A “RICH ONLY” DISEASE</p>
<p>A recently published study of 98,000 adults in China argues that linking obesity only to affluence is simplistic, and that geographic variations in China’s "nutritional transition” explain differences in public health.</p>
<p>Alarmingly, two out of five adults in the Asia Pacific are either overweight or obese. The World Heath Organisation estimates that roughly half of the world’s share of adults with diabetes live in Asia.</p>
<p>The cost of obesity in Asia Pacific is estimated to be roughly US$166 billion (or S$226 billion) annually.</p>
<p>Among Southeast Asian countries, healthcare and productivity losses from obesity are highest in Indonesia (US$2 billion to US$4 billion), Malaysia (US$1 billion to US$2 billion) and Singapore (US$400 million).</p>
<p>For China, home to 110 million adults with obesity and potentially 150 million by 2040, the prevalence of obesity increased 15 times between 1980 and 2015.</p>
<p>Between 2005 and 2015, yearly national income loss due to heart disease, stroke and diabetes increased more than six-fold in India and seven-fold in China. Statistics about child health point to a grim future.</p>
<p>In India, one quarter of urban youth entering middle school are obese and 66 per cent of children have an elevated risk for diabetes, while China is home to the world’s largest population of obese children.</p>
<p>Large local governments implementing sugar taxes include Cook County in Illinois, Chicago and Philadelphia, while San Francisco and Seattle plan to implement similar taxes in 2018.</p>
<p>Berkeley, California, a city with many high-earning and educated residents, was America’s first to implement a sugary beverage tax, in November 2014.</p>
<p>According to a study, sales of sugary beverages in Berkeley declined by 10 per cent during the first year of the tax and raised roughly US$1.4 million in revenue. The city applies proceeds in part to child nutrition and community health programmes.</p>
<p>Although Berkeley is an exceptional case, the spirit of the city’s approach – including the smart use of revenue – can be a guiding principle for Asian cities.</p>
<p>While soda consumption has slumped in the developed West, markets are growing rapidly in Asia.</p>
<p>Malaysia, which faces a national obesity crisis, is studying Mexico’s tax on sugary beverages as a model for one of its own.</p>
<p>Brunei introduced a tax on sugary beverages in April this year, and the Philippines senate is now debating an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages.</p>
<p>In Thailand, <a>a tax levy</a> on sugary drinks was instituted in September 2017, and will rise gradually over the next six years.</p>
<p>India’s western Maharashtra state banned so-called “junk food” in school canteens over concerns about childhood obesity, and Hong Kong will soon introduce a labelling scheme for pre-packaged foods in schools.</p>
<p>Despite the adoption or consideration of taxes on sugary drinks in many cities around the world, it is not clear whether such taxes positively affect health outcomes.</p>
<p>From a policy research perspective, long-term studies are needed to determine life-long health impacts, and research across cases is needed to determine the sensitivity of consumption to incremental increases in tax rates.</p>
<p>Gathering information is an important early step - an example is India’s nutrition atlas, which offers a state-by-state comparison on a variety of public health indicators, including obesity.</p>
<p>Another concern in sugar taxes is socio-economic equity: Taxes on cheap, unhealthy foods can impact low-income populations.</p>
<p>For example, in 2011 Denmark adopted a far-reaching “fat tax” that covered all products with saturated fats. After only one year the tax was scrapped, as were plans for a sugar tax, due to concerns about price burdens for consumers.</p>
<p>Taxes on sugary beverages must complement broader initiatives that incentivise healthier lifestyles. A 2016 study of obesity in India argues that related policy must consider nuanced socio-cultural factors over a "one-size-fits-all” approach.</p>
<p>Following Berkeley’s example, governments should apply soda tax revenue to nutrition and physical education programmes, and include information about sugar in school curricula.</p>
<p>The approach should consider local conditions, enhance education, and provide access to healthy alternatives. That is the basis for a durable solution to Asia’s obesity epidemic.</p>

<h1> Commentary: It’s fast food galore at Jewel Changi Airport. Aren’t parents troubled by our kids’ junk food intake? </h1>
<div> <p>Many have flocked to AW and Shake Shack at Jewel Changi Airport. But maybe parents ought to take a step back to think about limiting our kids’ junk food intake, says mum June Yong.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> June Yong </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: News of AW opening at Jewel Changi Airport have taken the nation by storm, or should I say by a flurry of curly fries and frothy root beer.</p>
<p>Advertisements by fast food joints usually capitalise on similar emotions.</p>
<p>They feature images of happy couples and families to tap our innate desire for love and connection. Images of cute babies trigger a release of endorphins. Toys and ice cream draw the hearts and minds of young children.</p>
<p>With health-consciousness on the rise, such advertising typically also feature fresh, crisp greens to sell the idea that their products are healthy and wholesome.</p>
<p>Although most of us try to curb the consumption of fast food in our daily diet, sometimes convenience and hearing our children’s shouts of hurray tear down the defences of even the best of us.</p>
<p>Around 44 per cent of Singaporeans eat fast food one to three times per week in 2018, according to Statista. A similar percentage (39 per cent) consumes it less than once a week.</p>
<p>There were 477 fast food outlets in Singapore in 2016, generating operating receipts of over S$1 billion, according to Singstat.</p>
<p>It’s not surprising that fast food ranks quite highly on the Singaporean agenda, given our busy lifestyles and the proliferation of fast-food outlets.</p>
<p>Plus, the unbearable heat of some afternoons make it extra tempting to duck into the first joint you can find, just to hide from the heat.</p>
<p>But should we be allowing these things to sway us from our resolve to eat healthily as a family, and more importantly inculcate good food habits in our young?</p>
<p>Ask anyone and they’d tell you that fast food isn’t the best kind of food to include in your diet. But exactly why is it so bad?</p>
<p>The term “fast food” generally refers to foods that are rich in energy (read: calories) but low in important nutrients.</p>
<p>But hasn’t fast food changed its ways to keep up with the times?</p>
<h3><a>READ: Add more plants, and less meat to your meals. Here’s why, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>Could these multi-national companies expand their menu variety even more and make changes to their food sourcing and preparation, such as limiting the amount of salt they sprinkle over French fries?</p>
<p>This is what a recent Forbes story suggested while highlighting the financial-moral conundrum that surrounds the global fast food industry: It provides jobs for locals, but also contributes to a rise in obesity levels in the country.</p>
<p>One solution put forward is to “slow down” the sector by using more local produce and expanding the availability of healthy and affordable options.</p>
<p>The calorie count of mains has increased by 90, while the portion size grew by 39 grams, another research in the Journal of the US Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.</p>
<p>Can we really imagine a world where fast food is more sustainable for life, and for growing children?</p>
<p>THE TYRANNY OF CONVENIENCE</p>
<p>It’s hard to deny – fast food is an attractive option for busy families, even when most of us regular joes do our best to put healthy food on the table for the most part of the week.</p>
<p>It is an easy win because of the taste, affordability, speed, and convenience (it can even be delivered to your doorstep). </p>
<h3><a>READ: Healthier options ‘killing the hawker vibe’? Why so resistant, Singaporeans? A commentary</a></h3>
<p>For some families where parents have to work extended or odd hours to put food on the table, it’s almost impossible to whip up a wholesome home-cooked meal in less than 30 minutes. </p>
<p>In such situations, instant noodles or a ham and cheese sandwich could likely be a daily affair. How can children from lower-income families get the nutrition they need in order to function well in school?</p>
<p>We all know that nutritious food is essential for the healthy development of a child. With the right conditions and resources, we would try to feed our children the most nutrient-dense foods we can provide.</p>
<p>Yet in our time-stretched and stressful realities, it is easier said than done.</p>
<p>Wendell Steavenson, in a Financial Times article, puts it succinctly: “…the rise of fast-food, vending machines, takeaways and online delivery services all encourage a food culture of constant, instant gratification.” </p>
<p>Although I try my best not to make fast food a regular feature in our diet, there is a small part of me that holds fond memories of dining out at McDonald’s when I was young. A hotcakes happy meal would make my Saturday complete, in my young mind.</p>
<p>As a family, we do eat fast food on occasions, even though I spend a fair amount of that time lecturing the kids about how unhealthy fries and nuggets are – all while being aware of how hypocritical it sounds since I’m also digging in. </p>
<p>We limit their intake of store-bought juices to two to three times a week. And we don’t allow soft drinks at all, citing the convenient excuse that it is not only high in sugar but it also causes bloatedness.</p>
<p>So most of us have this love-hate relationship with fast food but it isn’t the only thing that irks us. Because of the long hours children spend in school, we’re also expected to pack healthy snacks for them daily.</p>
<p>Snack planning can be a stressful affair. Apart from a handful of healthier options like nuts or whole-wheat buns, I fret over what to provide that would be palatable and unspoilt by noon the next day.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Want to fight the sugar problem? Start counting calories, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps the problem lies not only in how readily available fast food is, but also how hard it is to find wholesome foods on the go.</p>
<p>Healthy eating is a daily dilemma, and at the moment it appears that no one is winning.</p>
<p>Even for families who eat clean and healthy, there are areas where we are willing to settle for less.</p>
<p>But as a wise friend once said, we should aim to eat well 70 per cent of the time, and allow some wriggle room for indulgences.</p>
<p>Now with the opening of Jewel Changi Airport, the indulgence of the moment might just be an icy glass of root beer float, or maybe a juicy burger at Shake Shack.</p>
<p>And while there’s nothing wrong with rewarding ourselves, let’s be more aware of how fast or slow our daily diet is – and aim to dial back on the frenetic pace of life and food.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Overweight yet undernourished? The hidden effects of junk food consumption </h1>
<div> <p>Despite societies around the world getting more affluent, problems related to lack of essential nutrients in our diet are creeping back, says NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s Mary Chong.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Mary Chong </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The recent news of a teenager <a>going blind</a> from living on chips and crisps for years have taken readers by storm.</p>
<p>Is this just an extreme case of a food oddity, or could this happen to more individuals?</p>
<p>From the eyes of a nutrition professional, this is a classic case of micronutrient deficiencies, or simply put, a lack of essential vitamins and minerals required by the body for proper growth and development.</p>
<p>THE PENDULUM SWINGS TO THE OTHER SIDE</p>
<p>While shocking to see in this day and age, micronutrient deficiencies was commonplace a century ago, when our forefathers lived on a staple diet of mostly refined white rice and little meat.</p>
<h3><a>LISTEN: The Pulse: We love fast food fads yet want to stay healthy</a></h3>
<p>As society progressed, food became more abundant and affordable, allowing people to consume a greater variety more likely to meet their needs for these micronutrients. Ironically, this has also swung the pendulum to the other end.</p>
<p>Plentiful food choices have also led to overconsumption of calories, particularly from highly processed foods, which are high in added sugars and fats and low in micronutrients – otherwise known as “junk food”. </p>
<p>In recent years, problems related to micronutrient deficiencies are creeping back.</p>
<p>UNDERNOURISHED BUT OVERWEIGHT</p>
<p>As such, the World Health Organisation (WHO) now recognises the coexistence of undernutrition along with overweight and obesity - the double burden of malnutrition - as a global health issue.</p>
<p>There may be tell-tale signs such as dry skin, hair loss, fatigue, slower wound healing, but these are often brushed off as passing inconveniences.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: How instant noodles became a symbol of workaholics everywhere</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Aren’t parents troubled by our kids’ junk food intake?</a></h3>
<p>As the body taps into its own reserves, it can sometimes take extended periods to become depleted of certain micronutrients.</p>
<p>The only way to reveal one’s levels of vitamins and minerals is through blood tests, but these are not typically included in routine blood checks, which test for test for high blood cholesterol and blood sugar levels, unless requested.</p>
<p>EXCESS NUTRIENTS CAN BE PROBLEMATIC TOO</p>
<p>Can taking dietary supplements solve the problems related to micronutrient deficiencies?</p>
<p>Taking multivitamin and mineral supplements can help supplement our diet, particularly for vegetarians or vegans who exclude meat from the diet and are thus at higher risk of vitamin B12 deficiency.</p>
<p>However, dietary supplements should not be a substitute for eating a healthy, balanced and varied diet. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Want to fight the sugar problem? Start counting calories, a commentary</a></h3>
<h3><a>Commentary: Take your cardio from the shops to the great outdoors</a></h3>
<p>Too much of certain micronutrients may interfere with nutrient absorption, cause side effects or lead to toxicity, which can be dangerous.</p>
<p>In fact, unlike micronutrients and other substances found in fruits, vegetables, fish and other healthy foods that work together to keep us healthy, those found in pills will not provide the same synergistic effect.</p>
<p>TOO MUCH REFINED STARCHES AND SUGARS</p>
<p>Today, we are constantly being bombarded with new, trendy food products including fast foods, snacks and fanciful sweetened drinks being advertised and rolled out into the market.</p>
<p>It is easy to be swept away and live on a diet rich in refined starches and sugars and lacking in nutrient-dense foods. Ironically, despite the abundance of food, the quality of our diet have regressed to standards similar to decades back.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Sweeter than soda? The hidden sugars in bubble tea</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: That cup of fresh fruit juice could contain as much sugar as a soft drink</a></h3>
<p>When faced with too many food choices, we have to be even more discerning and conscious of what we choose to have on our plate.</p>
<p>Trendy foods can often blind us from good “old-fashioned” meals comprising of a staple, some meat, some vegetables and fruits – a varied, balanced combination more likely to help us meet our nutritional needs.</p>
<p>As the adage goes “You are what you eat”. If we eat junk constantly, why should we expect our health to turn out any differently?</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> 209 new COVID-19 cases reported in Singapore; 104 new Omicron infections confirmed </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 209 new COVID-19 cases as of noon on Sunday (Dec 26), of which 100 were imported.</p>
<p>There was also one fatality, taking the country's death toll from coronavirus complications to 822, according to the latest infection statistics on the <a>Ministry of Health's (MOH) website</a>.</p>
<p>Sunday's case count was down from the 248 infections reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Among the new cases reported on Sunday, 109 were locally transmitted, comprising 105 in the community and four in migrant workers' dormitories.</p>
<p>Separately, MOH's website also showed that 104 new Omicron variant infections were confirmed on Sunday, comprising 73 imported cases and 31 local cases.</p>
<p>The daily new COVID-19 cases and new confirmed Omicron cases are presented as two separate sets of data on MOH's website.</p>
<p>In an earlier statement on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore, MOH said a total of <a>546 confirmed Omicron cases</a> have been detected in the country as of Saturday. This figure comprises 443 imported cases and 103 local cases.</p>
<p>The weekly infection growth rate on Sunday was 0.58, up from Saturday's 0.56. This refers to the ratio of community cases for the past week over the week before.</p>
<p>The growth rate has remained below 1 since Nov 13. A figure below 1 means that the number of new weekly COVID-19 cases is falling.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, Singapore has recorded 277,764 COVID-19 cases since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<h2>HOSPITALISATIONS AND VACCINATIONS</h2>
<p>The intensive care unit (ICU) utilisation rate was 50.1 per cent, up from the 49.6 per cent reported on Saturday. </p>
<p>There were 377 patients in hospital, with 43 requiring oxygen supplementation.</p>
<p>In the ICU, eight patients required close monitoring while 18 patients were critically ill.</p>
<p>As of Saturday, 96 per cent of Singapore's eligible population - those aged 12 and above - have completed their full vaccination regimen under the national vaccination programme.</p>
<p>About 36 per cent of the total population have received their vaccine booster shots.</p>

<a>health and well-being</a>. That is why Simmons has spent over 150 years trying to improve the mattress, as science discovers the intricacies of what makes for restful sleep.
<p>It started with an invention by Canadian engineer James Marshall – the manually made wrapped coil spring. This was later improved upon by Simmons’ top engineer John Franklin Gail, which gave the world its first pocketed spring coil.</p>
<p>FIT FOR ROYALTY, MADE FOR EVERY BODY</p>
<p>Simmons founder Zalmon G Simmons had the heart of an entrepreneur. His passion to improve bedding and his pioneering attitude carried across to his teams, and eventually saw breakthrough with the introduction of coil springs in 1900.</p>
<p>Simmons’ dedication today continues to be about innovation in comfort. It is the first mattress company to introduce king- and queen-sized versions, and to design non-flip and negative ions mattresses.</p>
<p>This legacy now shows up fully with the newest concept store at Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ Mall).</p>
<p>IT’S ALWAYS SPRINGTIME AT SIMMONS</p>
<p>Along with the opening are fully imported mattress models on display, each fitted with some of the best features in the portfolio yet.</p>
<p>For Mediacorp artiste Pierre Png, the Beautyrest mattress from Simmons gets his vote. "After a long, gruelling day at work, I want to have uninterrupted sleep. My choice? The Simmons Beautyrest mattress – it’s the DNA of sleep!"</p>
<p>Looking to spring into the new year with increased energy and vitality? Invest in a mattress that best suits you for a good night’s sleep with expert recommendations from dedicated Simmons retail consultants, now available at PLQ Mall.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Omicron cases to recover at home, community facilities as Singapore eases approach to managing COVID-19 variant </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Johannes Tjendro </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore will ease its approach to managing COVID-19 cases infected with the Omicron variant from Monday (Dec 27). </p>
<a>home recovery</a> or treated at
<a>community care facilities</a> depending on their clinical presentation, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) late on Sunday night.
<p>"In the last week, we had several unlinked Omicron cases as well as <a>clusters in the community</a>. This was not unexpected given the high transmissibility of the variant."</p>
<p>Based on the authorities' "updated understanding", Omicron cases will be <a>allowed to follow Protocols 1-2-3</a> as with other COVID-19 cases, said MOH.</p>
<a>antigen rapid tests (ART)</a>, to discharge from the third day onwards.
<a>health risk warning</a> instead of being quarantined for 10 days, and those currently in quarantine will be progressively discharged over the next few days. They would have to self-test with ART daily before leaving their homes.
<a>TraceTogether</a>, and tight ringfencing of vulnerable settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, MSF elderly homes and preschools," said MOH.
<p>It added: "The adjustments in our approach for managing local Omicron cases will allow us to focus our healthcare resources on severe cases and protecting the vulnerable settings.</p>
<p>"It also allows us to go back to having a single streamlined approach to manage COVID-19, regardless of COVID-19 viral strains, which will facilitate operations on the ground and compliance to the protocols."</p>
<h2>EXPECT RAPID DOUBLING OF CASES</h2>
<p>As of Saturday, Singapore has detected 546 confirmed Omicron cases comprising 443 imported cases and 103 local cases, said MOH.</p>
<p>In the last week, there were 13 unlinked community Omicron cases and 78 Omicron cases from local linked community transmission.</p>
<p>According to MOH, the Omicron variant has been detected in more than 110 countries, mainly in Africa and Europe.</p>
<p>Available data thus far suggests that Omicron infections face reduced risks of hospitalisation and severe disease compared to Delta infections, said the ministry.</p>
<p>"Locally, our Omicron cases have so far not been severe as well – none has required intensive care or oxygen supplementation, although this may be partially due to most cases being fully vaccinated and from younger age groups," it added.</p>
<p>"There should be better protection against severe infection and death due to cellular immunity and other factors," said MOH.</p>
<p>"It is therefore important for us to press on with our <a>booster vaccination programme</a> to enhance protection against infection and severe disease."</p>
<p>The ministry said it expects a new wave of local cases "soon" given the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>"However, the peak of the wave can be blunted and we can avoid overwhelming our healthcare system again if everyone plays their part to get their vaccinations and booster doses, self-test regularly and self-isolate if tested positive," said MOH.</p>
<p>In particular, those who have <a>recently arrived from overseas</a> or been in contact with an infected person should reduce their social interactions.</p>
<p>"In the coming days and weeks, we should expect more community cases, and rapid doubling of cases. This is again a process we need to go through, in order to live with COVID-19.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Unvaccinated people to be barred from returning to workplaces, even with negative test result </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Unvaccinated workers will no longer be allowed to <a>return to the workplace</a> from Jan 15, even if they have a negative pre-event testing (PET) result, the Ministry of Health announced on Sunday (Dec 26).</p>
<p>The ministry had said in October that unvaccinated people would not be allowed to enter the workplace from January 2022, <a>unless they had tested negative for COVID-19</a>.</p>
<p>“Following the review and discussion with tripartite partners, we have decided to remove the PET concession for unvaccinated persons to return to the workplace from Jan 15, 2022,” said MOH in a press release issued at 11pm.</p>
<p>Partially vaccinated workers – those who have taken at least one dose of vaccine but are not yet fully vaccinated – will be granted a grace period until Jan 31 to complete the vaccination regime, the ministry said.</p>
<p>During the grace period, they can enter their workplace with a <a>negative PET result</a>.</p>
<p>"This change will help to protect unvaccinated individuals and to create safer workplaces for everyone," MOH said.</p>
<h2>VACCINATION REQUIRED FOR NEW WORK PASSES, PR APPLICATION</h2>
<p>Vaccination also will be a condition for the approval or grant of new long-term passes, work passes, as well as permanent residence from Feb 1 next year. </p>
<p>Vaccination will also be required when renewing existing work passes.</p>
<p>At the point of application, MOH said employers of work pass holders will be required to make a declaration that their employees and their dependants are fully vaccinated upon arrival in Singapore.</p>
<p>Those unable to produce the necessary documentation will be denied boarding or entry into Singapore unless prior exemptions have been granted. </p>
<p>Should they test negative, they will be required to complete the full vaccination regimen in Singapore or face revocation of their passes, said MOH. </p>
<p>Those who are under 12 years old are exempt from this vaccination condition, while those aged 12 to below 18 years old have to make a declaration to complete the full COVID-19 vaccination regimen after arriving in Singapore.</p>
<p>Pass holders who are medically ineligible for vaccination must submit a doctor's memo at the point of application and undergo a medical review upon arriving in the country.</p>
<p>Those who are not registered in the NIR will have to complete the full vaccination regimen in Singapore to fulfil the vaccination condition before they can be granted PR or long-term passes.</p>
<p>Children under the age of 12, as well as those medically ineligible for vaccination, will be exempt from this requirement.</p>
<h2>SECOND ROUND OF DISTRIBUTION OF TEST KITS</h2>
<p>To support the increased number of employees returning to their workplace from 2022, a second round of voluntary distribution of <a>antigen rapid test (ART)</a> kits will be conducted for workplaces.</p>
<p>From Jan 1, the unvaccinated would have to pay for their own PET tests before they are barred from workplaces from Jan 15. Partially vaccinated individuals would also have to pay for their own PET tests until such time they are fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Applications will open from Jan 3 to Jan 31, the ministry said, adding that more details will be announced soon.</p>
<p>All firms are encouraged to implement regular testing for employees, to help detect COVID-19 infections early, it said.</p>

<section> <div> <p> Wellness </p> <h1> ‘Worry burnout’ is real – here's how to spot the signs and combat it </h1> <div> <p>After a long period of stress, it's normal to feel numb and hopeless. Here's what you can do.</p> </div> </div> </section>
<p>Nearly two years into a drudging, dragging pandemic, each crumb of news about the Omicron variant can feel like too much to process.</p>
<a>the psychological term for an all-consuming exhaustion and detachment</a>, floated around the popular lexicon in
<a>reference to work </a>for years, but became even more of a buzzword as it
<a>seeped into all the corners </a>of people’s lives during the pandemic.
<p>“When you’re dealing with long and unending uncertainty and trauma, there’s only so much you can handle,” said Thea Gallagher, a clinical psychologist and assistant professor at NYU Langone Health.</p>
<a>natural and man-made disasters</a>, Dr Gallagher said, acute stress often leads to exhaustion and hopelessness over time. Australia, for example, has experienced more and more climate-related natural disasters, but scientists
<a>identified a pervasive sense of “issue fatigue”</a> about climate change in the population there from 2011 to 2016: The Australians surveyed became less likely to report that they had thought about climate change or talked about it with their friends.
<p>We spoke to experts about the signals and symptoms of “worry burnout” – and ways to combat it.</p>
<p>WHAT CAUSES WORRY BURNOUT?</p>
<p>WHY YOU WANT TO BREAK THE ‘WORRY BURNOUT’ CYCLE</p>
<p>Refusing to worry might be a protective impulse, experts said, a coping mechanism to shield your mind from added stress. But when we’re so burned out we stop caring about measures that might beat back the virus, we put ourselves in danger.</p>
<a>“pandemic fatigue”</a> as a key obstacle to getting people to comply with COVID-19 precautions.
<a>In January of this year,</a> researchers found that, as the pandemic wore on, people reported less adherence to social distancing measures.
<p>SPOT THE SIGNS OF ‘WORRY BURNOUT’</p>
<p>“If we spend all of our time worrying, it’s like turning our engine on, putting our car in neutral, slamming on the gas and wondering why we don’t go anywhere,” he said.</p>
<p>YOU’RE ANGRIER THAN USUAL: Anger can also crop up when we’re emotionally expended, Dr Neal-Barnett said – we might lose our temper more quickly or find ourselves more impatient.</p>
<p>Putting together an action plan – to speak with a therapist, to safely socialise with friends, to take moments for mindfulness – can help us feel rested and restored.</p>
<p>“The days of trying to push through the tiredness are over,” Dr Neal-Barnett said. “That’s just not in our best interests anymore.”</p>
<a>a simple, on-the-go breathing exercise</a>; the Times also has a
<a> beginner’s guide to meditation</a>. These techniques won’t make the pandemic go away, but they can help us back away from the edge.
<p>If you still gravitate back to worry, the best thing you can do, she said, is to try to cut off the cycle as soon as possible and look for activities and routines that help you relax.</p>
<p>“A lot of people have this myth that worrying is helpful in some way, and it’s just not,” she said.</p>
