<div> <div> <div> <h2>Is Love Best When It's Fresh? </h2> <p>The connection between love and time has always fascinated lovers, who ask themselves if their love will endure. The answer is complicated.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>How Sex Robots Could Change Our Love Lives</a></h2> <p>Could robots be more satisfying lovers than their human counterparts? Answering this question requires clarifying the nature of emotions and romantic love.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Patience Can Be Essential for Romantic Relationships</a></h2> <p>Romantic love is often described as both patient and impatient. Does this paradoxical description make sense?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Is Rebound Sex Really So Bad?</a></h2> <p>A common reaction to romantic breakups is rebound sex, shortly after separation. A popular view considers such sex as harmful; some empirical studies doubt this view.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Seductive Power of a Sexy Voice</a></h2> <p>What is the role of seeing and hearing in generating sexual attraction? And what is the most seductive part of the body?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Is Ambivalence Beneficial When Choosing a Romantic Partner?</a></h2>
<p>In ideal love, we choose our partner with no indecision or doubts. However, to develop a flourishing romantic bond, combining decisiveness with some hesitance is valuable.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Is Casual Sex Really So Bad for You?</a></h2> <p>Recent studies indicate that superficial romantic encounters are valuable. Do they also suggest the advantage of casual sex over enduring love? </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>So, You Want to Impress Her? Make Her Laugh</a></h2> <p>Humor and sexiness are often more romantically attractive than wisdom and beauty.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Living in the Shadow of Your Resume or Eulogy</a></h2>
<p>Two groups of a potential partner’s characteristics are: (a) those described in their resume, and (b) those mentioned in their future eulogy. Which one matters more in love?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Does Imagination Enhance Romantic Relationships?</a></h2> <p>Various studies have confirmed the value for relationships of imagination expressed in idealization and sexual fantasies.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>An Unexpected Key to the Most Successful Relationships</a></h2> <p>Sensitivity is essential in romantic relationships. Nevertheless, too much romantic sensitivity can be harmful and a limited degree of indifference is required. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>What's the Point of Sexual Regrets?</a></h2> <p>Our love lives are full of romantic regrets, ranging from our choices of unsuitable partners to missed romantic opportunities. Do those regrets have a functional value?</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Healthy Relationships Need Boundaries</a></h2> <p>Nurturing, rather than preventative behavior, is the most efficient method of self-control in profound love.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Does Genuine Love Benefit from Moderate Passion? </a></h2> <p>Why intense passion isn't the only component of a successful relationship.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Navigating Feelings of Romantic Inferiority</a></h2> <p>Unlike occasional achievements, a person’s ongoing success can sometimes be harmful to one’s partner and relationship.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>When It Comes to Love, Little Things Mean a Lot</a></h2> <p>Anyone can produce big romantic gestures, but it's through small, daily actions that genuine lovers maintain truly loving relationships.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How Picky Should You Be About a Romantic Partner?</a></h2> <p>Here are 4 ways to develop a healthy pickiness, which increases the chances of finding a suitable partner. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>What Makes a Good Flirt? </a></h2> <p>Flirting is an enjoyable and playful romantic game encompassing many contradictory aspects, which an ambitious flirt must master in order to be successful.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Why "Love Like in the Movies" Can Be Dangerous</a></h2> <p>Romantic Ideology assumes the eternal and exclusive nature of love and consequently creates major difficulties for many. Is this ideology still valuable?</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Some Couples Love Having Sex Outdoors</a></h2> <p>The most comfortable and easy location to have sex is in bed. Why, then, do so many people prefer to have sex outdoors?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>“During My Marriage, My Only Affairs Were with My Exes”</a></h2> <p>Why are people attracted to their exes? Is renewal of romantic bonds for sexual satisfaction a good idea?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Why Women in Couples with Large Age Gaps Face So Much Criticism </a></h2>
<p>Derogatory terms like cougar and gold-digger are directed solely at women in relationships with big age gaps. Why does society adopt such double standards? </p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Some People Refuse to Kiss During Casual Sex</a></h2> <p>Intimate kissing is central in romantic and sexual experiences. Why, then, do some people avoid it during casual encounters?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>How Self-Esteem and Self-Confidence Power the Most Fulfilling Relationships</a></h2>
<p>Romantic thriving is more than surviving; it nurtures our values and capacities, and it's influenced by attitudes like self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-fulfillment.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>"I Have Not Fallen in Love for Years"</a></h2> <p>Falling in love is an exhilarating experience for most people. Why then, do so many people fear falling in love? </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Should Couples Really Share Their Sexual Histories?</a></h2> <p>Self-disclosure is important in romantic relationships, but should it include one’s sexual history? </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>'I Fall in Love Fast and Without Measuring Risks'</a></h2> <p>There are people who fall in love quickly, easily, and frequently. Does this way of falling in love promote an enduring, profound love?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>'He Fears That My Lover Is Better Than Him'</a></h2> <p>Issues of comparison feature heavily in both thought and emotions. Is comparison, which often leads to envy and jealousy, less poisonous in open romantic relationships?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Driving Me Crazy</a></h2> <p>Many romantic relations are unsettled and therefore not entirely fulfilled. Why is the passion in these relations so strong, and can we speak about exciting calmness?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>On Junk Food and Junk Sex</a></h2> <p>Sex and food are connected in many ways; are they also similar in terms of morality?</p> </div> </div> </div>

<a>bias</a> in evaluating social interactions. Lonely people pick up on
<a> signs of potential rejection</a> more quickly than do others, perhaps better to avoid it and protect themselves. People who feel lonely need to be aware of this bias so as to override it in seeking out companionship.

<h3>Communities and Wellbeing</h3>
<a>Human Flourishing Program</a> at Harvard, we have studied various aspects of communities, communal wellbeing, social participation, and their role in flourishing. We have published on the role of social support in
<a>healthy aging</a>, on the role of
<a>social cohesion</a> in wellbeing, on the effects of
<a>depression</a>, and on the role of
<a>religious communities</a> play in human flourishing, including preventing depression and
<a>suicide</a>, extending longevity, improving marital outcomes, facilitating
<a>forgiveness</a>, and hope. The size of the effects of religious community participation tend to exceed those of other forms of social participation. With regard to effects on
<a>cardiovascular disease</a>, the effects of religious service participation are larger than for any other social participation indicator examined, including
<a>marriage</a>, time spent with friends or family, hours spent in other community groups, or even their composite.

<a>loneliness</a>, and rebuild communities. We hope that this new initiative will strengthen our work on this important topic further, and offer some small contribution towards enhancing and encouraging community life.
<h3>Re-Establishing and Strengthening Communities</h3>

<h1> 5 Small Ways to Reconsider Your Life's Meaning </h1>
<h2> In defense of not following your dreams. </h2>
<li>It is easy to look back on your life and see loss, failure, and disappointment. </li>
<li>Try measuring your life by different metrics of success. </li>
<li>Learn to regard your life tenderly as the attempt of an imperfect person to make good decisions.</li>
<p>Here are five factors to consider when reconstructing your life’s purpose.</p>
<h3>1. Do you have enough of what you need to live?</h3>
<p>Look for the places of plenty in your life. Do you have enough food to eat every day and clean water to drink? Do you have a place to live, however imperfect it may be? Are you safe? Are your vital organs intact and functioning?</p>
<h3>2. To whom do you matter?</h3>
<a>Loneliness</a> does not mean you are alone. Today, let it be enough that you are a small part of a social web, and are connected to others, in small and imperfect ways.
<h3>3. For whom are you responsible?</h3>
<a>boring</a> and grinding reality of daily labor as an adult. After all, it probably does not come close to your
<p>The fact that anyone else could feasibly do the work you do doesn’t take away from the fact that you did it. Today, let it be enough that your existence, in a tiny and imperfect way, improves and eases the lives of others.</p>
<h3>4. For whom have you made sacrifices?</h3>
<a>dreams</a> that you gave up along the way. OK, that feels bad. But I would guess, quite confidently, that you had a rather compelling reason not to follow through on your plans. Perhaps you gave up your dream due to the
<a>happiness</a> and safety of someone you cared about.
<a>decision-making</a> process, was a seed of kindness and consideration for others.
<a>shame</a> or try to eradicate. Today, let it be enough that you have made some decisions, however imperfect, from a place of personal sacrifice and compassion.

<div> <h3> Is gratitude an emotion? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is gratitude a feeling? </h3> </div>
<p>Gratitude is both a temporary feeling and a dispositional trait. In both cases, <a>gratitude involves a process</a> of recognizing, first, that one has obtained a positive outcome and, second, that there is an external source for that good outcome.</p>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Why Gratitude Matters </h2>
<a>happiness</a> and fosters both physical and psychological health, even among those already struggling with mental health problems. Studies show that practicing gratitude curbs the use of words expressing negative emotions and shifts inner
<a>attention</a> away from such negative emotions as resentment and
<a>envy</a>, minimizing the possibility of ruminating, which is a hallmark of
<div> <h3> Does gratitude reduce stress? </h3> </div>
<a>insomnia</a> less, have stronger immune systems, experience healthier relationships, and do better academically and professionally. Overall it can boost both
<a>your mental and your physical health</a>.
<div> <h3> Are grateful people less depressed? </h3> </div>
<a>reducing negative affect</a> and increasing mental
<a>resilience</a> in a group of older adults.
<div> <h3> Can gratitude help you engage in better self-care? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>One study suggests that spending only a few minutes engaging in <a>a gratitude activity</a>, such as writing a letter of gratitude to a loved one, can motivate you to make healthy food choices.</p> </div> </div>
<h2> How to Cultivate Gratitude </h2>
<a>narcissism</a> are similarly thieves of gratitude. In fact, the cultivation of gratitude may be at least a partial remedy for narcissism.
<div> <h3> How do you practice gratitude? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What makes a person feel grateful? </h3> </div>
<a>experience and express gratitude</a>. It can be something as simple as a healthy spring shower, just because the rain washes everything clean. Engaging in a more specific act, such as volunteering to help others, makes people feel good about themselves.
<div> <h3> Is gratitude contagious? </h3> </div>
<p>Gratitude is a social emotion and the <a>expression of gratitude</a> toward others compounds its benefits. The emotion literally pays itself forward. And it almost does not matter whether the gratitude is communicated or reciprocated by others.</p>
<h2> Tips to Foster Gratitude </h2>
<li>Keep a journal of or in some way note big and little joys of daily life.</li>
<li>Write down "three good things"—identify three things that have gone well for you and identify the cause.</li>
<li>Write thank-you notes to others.</li>
<li>Think about people who have inspired you and what about them was most significant.</li>
<li>Engage in "mental subtraction." Imagine what your life would be like if some positive event had not occurred.</li>

<h1> The Wu-Wei Paradox: Striving Less Generates More Success </h1>
<h2> A wu-wei mindset promotes effortless action and non-striving flow states. </h2>
<li>Wu-wei is an ancient philosophical stance that emerged from Taoism; the non-striving mindset of wu-wei facilitates "effortless action." </li>
<li>Mindfulness practices that promote wu-wei mental states encourage flow and the effortlessness that athletes experience "in the zone."</li>
<li>Implicit motor learning is key to wu-wei; it's easier to sustain a non-striving mindset when coordinated movements happen automatically. </li>
<div>Source: daphnusia/Shutterstock</div>
<p>A wu-wei mindset involves letting go and not overthinking; this mental state (also known as Mushin) facilitates flow state experiences and a sense of effortlessness, which opens the door to peak performance.</p>
<a>Kee et al., 2021</a>) conceptual overview of the "wu-wei alternative" in the Asian Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology examines the power of a non-striving mindset in the context of "flow, nonduality, Zen, Mushin,
<a>motivation</a>, goals, and implicit learning."
<a>mindfulness</a> in sport psychology, we would like to convince colleagues in the field to consider the wu-wei alternative," first author Ying Hwa Kee said in a January 2022
<a>news release</a>. "Improving athletes' performance is only one aspect we look at. Further understanding of wu-wei and non-striving could well add new dimensions to the way that 'success' in sport is perceived."
<h3>Frictionless flow: How a wu-wei mindset facilities superfluidity</h3>

<a>Superfluidity and the Synergy of Your Four Brain Hemispheres</a>").
<p>Since the 1990s, when I first read Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's seminal book, Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, I've been on the lookout for specific ways to increase one's odds of experiencing flow in sports and other life pursuits.</p>
<h3>Non-striving mental states benefit from the automaticity of implicit learning.</h3>
<p>By not overly involving cerebral cognitive systems, an athlete increases the likelihood of experiencing frictionless flow. As Kee et al. explain:</p>
<a>stressful</a> situation might cause the individual to return to the cognitive process more readily (i.e., overthinking, causing the actions not to flow freely)."
<a>neural</a> networks can facilitate the automaticity associated with implicit learning (see: "
<a>The Brain Mechanics of Superfluid Coordination</a>").
