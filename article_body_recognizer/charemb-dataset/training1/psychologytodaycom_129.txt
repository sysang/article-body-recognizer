<h1> How to Choose Effective Self-Help Resources </h1>
<h2> Find lots of proven options here. </h2>
<p> Posted September 20, 2017 </p>
<p>It seems that just about everyone has read a self-help book, attended a support group or surfed online for health information at one time or another.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: dizanna/CanStockPhoto</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>psychotherapy</a>. Formal therapy sessions may only comprise an hour or two each week, so using self-help options can add a substantial amount of time between therapy sessions for engagement in therapeutic activities.
<p>But is self-help effective?</p>
<p>So, how do you find effective self-help resources?</p>
<p>However, I’m not always aware of resources for some specialized topics and therefore I don’t immediately have a solid reference upon which to base an informed recommendation.</p>
<p>This is where the “Self Help That Works” book really shines. The overall goal of the book is to help people select effective self-help resources and to assist professionals in recommending them to their patients.</p>
<p>Additionally, a dagger symbol is used if a particular resource was rated negatively by the professionals. Well-established support groups for each topic are also listed but not rated.</p>
<p>The topics covered in the chapters are quite diverse, including:</p>
<li>Interpersonal issues such as abuse, <a>bullying</a>, and violence</li>
<li>Developmental issues related to adults and older adults, and <a>parenting</a> of infants, children, and adolescents</li>
<li>Relationship issues such as <a>marriage</a>, <a>divorce</a>, <a>gender</a>, and <a>sexuality</a></li>
<li>Self-improvement topics including <a>assertiveness</a>, <a>career</a> issues, communication, <a>spirituality</a>, and <a>stress</a> <a>management</a></li>
<p>Another extremely helpful feature in the book is guidelines for consumers to use when considering various self-help resources. These very practical tips include:</p>
<li>Don’t choose a resource based solely on its <a>advertising</a>.</li>
<li>Make sure the resource’s claims are specific and reasonable.</li>
<li>Look for resources which clearly state their limitations. </li>
<li>Review the author’s professional credentials.</li>
<li>Study any available research supporting the self-help resource.</li>
<p>The book concludes with strategies for mental health professionals to successfully include self-help resources along with traditional therapy. Among these many helpful suggestions, practitioners are reminded to:</p>
<li>Don't devalue self-help.</li>
<li>Take time to learn about self-help options.</li>
<li>Get feedback from patients about their self-help experiences.</li>
<li>Offer support with more difficult self-help techniques.</li>
<li>Recommend self-help measures that have been supported by research.</li>
<p>I use the “Self-Help That Works” book as a go-to reference for selecting effective self-help interventions. It’s a treasure trove of useful information and is highly recommended.</p>

<h1> What’s at the Root of Performance Anxiety? </h1>
<h2> How fear and anger become physical symptoms. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Anxiety? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist to overcome anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pexels/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>stage fright</a>”--Barbra Streisand, Beyonce, Adele, Emma Stone, David Beckham, Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey, Thomas Jefferson, Warren Buffett, and Mahatma Gandhi, to name a few.
<p>Those who are not famous struggle with performance anxiety too. These include business executives, writers, academics, lawyers, and even mental health professionals.</p>
<p>I struggled with stage fright as a student at Juilliard and suffered from self-doubt whenever I played piano in public. So I practiced harder. My mentors and teachers reassured me that I “should not worry”.</p>
<p>These reassurances did not help. I felt alone and confused. People did not want to talk about stage fright, acting as if it were contagious. I performed despite my anxiety, but the experience was exhausting, mystifying and unsettling. </p>
<p>Some Symptoms of Performance Anxiety</p>
<p>Today, performance anxiety is less stigmatized, but it continues to debilitate and demoralize many people. Performance anxiety has both physical and psychological symptoms such as</p>
<li><a>Memory</a> insecurity</li>
<li><a>Humiliation</a> and dread about making mistakes</li>
<li>Shame at not being “perfect” in front of an audience</li>
<li>Worry about what people think</li>
<li><a>Fear</a> of disappointing others</li>
<li>Concerns about looking “weird” or “stupid”</li>
<li>Constant rumination or circular thinking</li>
<p>Fear Leads to "Fight or Flight"</p>
<p>When people are frightened and feel attacked, they try to defend themselves. Unfortunately, the fight can turn into an attack on the self. Forgetting what one knows, one believes the audience will not appreciate them or laugh at them.</p>

<p>Her parents <a>divorced</a> when she was very young. Cindy could not understand her mother’s <a>depression</a> or her father’s disappearance. She assumed she played some role in their break up and felt guilty and responsible. </p>
<p>Cindy used the following two ego defenses to protect herself from anxiety:</p>
<p>She denied her anger because she feared anger caused people to leave her.</p>
<a>anxious</a> when she was performing, fearing that an “imperfect” performance would cause an audience to disapprove of her.
<p>James became a cellist over the objections of his parents who believed musicians “wound up eating cat food in New York.” He persisted in his studies but developed a pain in his bow arm.</p>

<p>How to Manage Performance Anxiety</p>
<p>Here are some important things to remember about performance anxiety:</p>
<li>There is no such thing as a “perfect” performance. Perfection exists in our minds, <a>fantasies</a>, and wishes.</li>
<li>Feeling anxiety does not mean you aren’t an excellent performer</li>
<li>Anxiety is a cue to develop curiosity about one’s reactions and actions.</li>
<li>Shame is a complex feeling about yourself and also a fear of audience rejection. It can be dealt with by understanding the source of your emotional discomfort.</li>
<li>Appreciate that intense self-criticism comes from the mind of the performer. It is not necessarily the way the audience feels.</li>
<li>Physical symptoms such as cold hands, tense stomach and headaches are some of the ways the body conveys clues about psychological concerns.</li>

<h1> Self-Help Tips for Worrying </h1>
<h2> Tactics for reducing anxiety. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: MaxPixels, Public Domain</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>There are two categories of worrying: about a specific issue or general worrying. Here are suggestions for each.</p>
<p>First, the obvious: Is there anything you can do now to reduce or even eliminate the worry? Examples:</p>
<a>online dating</a> profile? Take a class likely to attract an appropriate partner? Ask friends to set you up with a well-suited person? Improve your appearance?
<a>Public speaking</a> may be the most common
<a>fear</a>. These may reduce it:
<li>Don’t memorize your talk. Plan it but then reduce it to an outline that fits on an index card or four. Not being tied to a script is relaxing. Just talk, connecting with your audience.</li>
<li>Be authentic. Just speak your truth in your conversational style, perhaps a little more slowly. No phony motivational speaker persona.</li>
<li>Know that mistakes are no big deal. Most people will remember only the overall impression. If you are prepared and authentic, it’ll be okay, even if you screw-up some.</li>
<p>Now let’s assume you’ve done what you want to reduce or eliminate the worry's rational basis. Ask yourself and perhaps write how you’d deal with the best-, moderate-, and worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Apart from specific worries, many people go through life with free-floating anxiety. They’re like the cartoon character who walks around with a cloud overhead, worrying they’ll be deluged by some havoc.</p>
<p>Routine. A life of predictable routines can be comforting.</p>
<p>Eliminate sources of stress:</p>
<li>A work-life in which you lack control or have a difficult boss or tasks</li>
<li>A <a>stressful</a> living situation</li>
<li>People who too often stress you out. All of us should spend time with relaxed people who bring out the best in us. But for people who are <a>anxious</a>, it’s especially important.</li>
<p>Use calmers. For example,</p>
<li>Listen to calming music, perhaps one or more of those suggested in <a>this article.</a></li>
<li>Every so often, take a few deep breaths.</li>
<li>Stare for a minute at the view outside your window, in your garden, or at a YouTube aquarium, which comes with calming music, for example,<a> this.</a></li>
<li>In <a>a separate article, </a>I offer <a>self-help</a> tips that can be useful not just in addressing anxiety, but sadness and <a>anger</a>.</li>

<h1> 3 Strategies for Self-Talk </h1>
<h2> Simple ways to begin training your inner coach. </h2>
<li>Consider self-talk to be your inner coach; training your coach can help when needed most.</li>
<li>Self-talk is more than just saying "Be positive." Use specific motivational, supportive, instructional, and challenging inner dialogue.</li>
<li>Any skill requires practice. Select a specific aspect of self-talk and rehearse throughout the day.</li>
<p>Before I had decades of experience in the world of sport psychology, I was a basketball player.</p>
<p>So I tried something new—I brought my coach to me. </p>
<p>Without even knowing it, I was using self-talk to train my inner coach.</p>
<p>Here are three simple ways to begin training your inner coach:</p>
<p>1. Match your inner coach to where you’re at, age and experience-<a>wise</a>.</p>
<p>2. Your inner coach should be context-specific.</p>
<p>3. Your inner coach gets stronger and more personalized through deliberate practice.</p>
<p>To improve self-talk, you can deliberately employ your inner coach and then monitor how that approach worked. This is called “deliberate practice,” the act of rehearsing a skill or behavior purposefully and systematically. </p>
<a>coaching</a> style (challenging v. supportive), and the right timing to deploy phrases.
<p>And practicing this skill matters. A favorite quote of mine from the movie The American President demonstrates why: </p>
<a>self-image</a>, such as, “you’re blowing it,” or, “everyone can see you don’t belong here.” Being proactive in developing your inner coach prevents these thoughts from being able to seize the microphone easily.
<p>Whatever your role, we all navigate relational, personal, and social issues. Those who train self-talk are able to take on more of life’s challenges—with the inner coach who’s always by our sides.</p>

<h1> 3 Go-To Strategies for Resilience </h1>
<h2> From simply surviving to thriving. </h2>
<li>Each person finds a way to navigate life's challenges. Resilience skills can help propel us forward to thriving and growth. </li>
<li>Connect and tap into the support of those around you, and fuel your resilience with embracing opportunities to learn from your challenges. </li>
<li>When in doubt, turn to your inner coach for supportive reminders that you will persevere. </li>
<p>As a performance psychologist and entrepreneur, a woman working in a male-dominated field, and a single mother of two daughters, I’ve heard this line more times than I can count: “I don’t know how you do it!”</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve heard it too—most busy professionals trying to juggle a lot at once have. And layered over the challenges of the pandemic (loss of child care, workspace, social support, etc.), it seems to be a widely circulated sentiment.</p>
<p>Through that reflection, I was able to gain awareness of and double down on my core sources of strength. I share them with you here and encourage you to undertake this reflection yourself, so you’re ready the next time you get the statement.</p>
<h3>1. Prioritize Social Connection From the Start</h3>
<h3>2. Be an Active Optimist, Especially in Tough Times</h3>
<a>optimism</a>. Quite simply, it refers to a mindset and action taken to increase the odds that things will turn out well (as opposed to passive optimism, which means hoping things will turn out well).
<p>When taking life’s punches, consider asking these questions: </p>
<ul><li>“How can this make me stronger, or help me grow?” </li> <li>“How can this make me more <a>forgiving</a>?”</li> <li>“What can I learn from this?” </li> </ul>
<p>This is how I practice active optimism—turning my sights and focus to the things that have gone well or sparked <a>gratitude</a> for me that day, and attempting to draw lessons for the future from those that did not.</p>
<h3>3. Train My <a>Inner Coach</a> to Be With Me Always</h3>
<a>coaching</a> myself to “just dig in” and be efficient and focused.

<h1> Stop Playing Small: Embrace Your Inner Power </h1>
<h2> How to make it through the perfect storm. </h2>
<li>When life's "storms" hit, it is easy to be immobilized by fear.</li>
<li>Tapping the reflective wisdom of your social support can help you "see" through the storm. </li>
<li>Strategies such as perspective taking, leveraging your strengths, self-talk, and stepping with confidence can help you embrace your inner power.</li>
<p>There’s a quote I’ve repeated to myself so often that I no longer need to read it. I wouldn’t say it’s my “favorite” quote, but it is the one that speaks to me during hard times:</p>
<p>“You have three strikes against you,” he said bluntly. “You’re an attractive woman, you’re smart, and you don’t have an agenda. People don’t know what to do with that.”</p>
<h3>1. It’s Not Always About Me</h3>
<a>burnout</a>. You can’t “self-care” yourself through an overwhelming workload, or unsupportive partnership, or lack of childcare.
<h3>2. Not Only Should I Keep Believing in Myself, But I Should Also "Double Down"</h3>
<p>In my <a>career</a>, I’ve often taught elite performers a concept called “active <a>optimism</a>.” Beyond just hoping for a good outcome, active optimists take action to make it more likely that the good outcome will occur.</p>
<a>Happiness</a>) as well as other brief strength-based questionnaires can help to illuminate your personal strengths.
<h3>3. I Had to Change What I Was Saying to Myself </h3>
<a>self-talk</a> impacts action. If you’re playing small, your
<a>self-talk</a> can become a mess. Just as someone can walk off a basketball court after missing a shot saying “I suck,” it can be easy to slip into negative, self-blaming dialogue around a personal issue or poor work performance.
<p>But how do you shift the negative “I’m a failure” inner chatter to something more useful?</p>
<p>Connect a physical cue. Over time, I practiced breathing through the negative self-talk and imagining those thoughts floating out of my mind. The more I did this, the easier it became to stop and redirect in the moment.</p>
<h3>4. I Can Choose How to React to Someone—Whether to Stand Up Straight or Shrink</h3>
<a>confidence</a> and expertise, that says much more about them than me. I’m not willing to shrink myself down and play small in most scenarios anymore—because it doesn’t play to my strengths.
<h3>5. You Can Set a Personal Record and Still Lose the Race</h3>
<p>Eyes on your own lane, pursue the <a>dreams</a> that are aligned with your values, and celebrate your own achievements.</p>
<p>There’s one final line of that Mandela quote:</p>
<blockquote> <p>As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.</p> </blockquote>
<p>I share my own experiences of “playing small” with you to hopefully help you notice situations in which you might be doing the same—and encourage you to throw back your shoulders and be as tall as you can be.</p>
<p>And when your own perfect storm hits, I hope you have a friend who will RSVP “yes” to your pity party—then blow it up once they arrive.</p>

<h1> 5 Ways to Communicate as a Transformative, Resilient Leader </h1>
<h2> Don't just recover from a crisis, bounce forward. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Resilience? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Transformative, resilient crisis leaders empower others to not only bounce back, but bounce forward and grow through crises.</li>
<li>Leveraging up supportive relationships is a key pillar in growing through crisis.</li>
<li>Strength comes from honoring team members and empowering them as people, rather than simply a collection of skills.</li>
<p>Recently, the phrase, “your job will be posted before your obituary,” went viral. And the sad reality is, it went viral because so many people can relate to the sentiment. </p>
<p>But the truth is, <a>research</a> shows individual actions cannot mitigate organizational factors that lead to burnout and employee loss. The call is coming from inside the house. </p>
<a>leadership</a>, you can seize this time and find ways to make your team feel valued for who they are, not just what they do. Transformative,
<a>resilient</a> leaders understand that adversity can provide a rationale to take risks that would otherwise seem unjustifiable—and change a culture in previously unimagined ways.
<p>My mentor, Dr. George S. Everly, <a>has written about</a> what every leader should know regarding crisis and growth. Here, I want to hone in on one of our five pillars of transformative, resilient leadership: building supportive relationships.</p>
<p>Here are the five elements of supportive relationships that transformative leaders should strive to enact in their workplaces:</p>
<p>Worker shortages. Childcare issues. Supply chain breakdowns. The list of crises leaders have dealt with in the past few years is overwhelming, yet one of the top things a leader can do for their team is to model composure, calm, and an even temper.</p>
<h3>2. Reliability/Trustworthiness</h3>
<p>To quote from our book: “Think of reliability as consistency. Consistency yields predictability. Predictability engenders trust. Trust is a key characteristic of high-performing organizations, especially those enduring a crisis.” </p>
<p>We can boil this down to a few simple, yet powerful, actions:</p>
<ul><li>Do what you say you’re going to do.</li> <li>If you must break a promise, clearly and promptly explain why.</li> <li>Show genuine kindness to your team members, both to their faces and behind their backs.</li> </ul>
<a>stress</a>, 106 percent more energy, 50 percent higher
<a>productivity</a>, 13 percent fewer sick days, 76 percent more interpersonal connectedness, and 29 percent more life satisfaction.
<h3>3. Accepting Responsibility for Your Actions</h3>
<a>self-efficacy</a> from team members, you, as a leader, can improve the collective efficacy of the group. It starts at the top.
<p>The steps for a transformative, resilient leader are:</p>
<li>Recognize the work of team members (you might sit down at the end of each week and think about what each person contributed).</li>
<li>Call them out and honor them for it (whether in person or via a weekly meeting or email).</li>
<li>Help them feel important for the work they contributed (explain how their work pushed the collective goal forward).</li>
<li>Share credit for the successes of the collective (make it clear how each person’s efforts are building toward one goal).</li>

<p>These steps, repeated consistently, create a workplace with a shared <a>identity</a> and collaborative environment.</p>
<p>A few strategies for that are to:</p>
<li>Create buddy and mentoring systems to pair people with more knowledge and expertise with those who can benefit from them.</li>
<li>Purposefully mix expertise levels on teams, with the goal of the more experienced team members pulling up the newer ones to their level.</li>
<li>Model how to give constructive criticism with suggestions for moving forward. It’s your responsibility to show that criticism—and even failure—can be a springboard for growth if taken to heart.</li>

<h1> No Shame in Your Game: How to Use Data to Reach Your Goals </h1>
<h2> The power of a balanced critique. </h2>
<li>Each interaction provides us valuable lessons, if we choose to tap them.</li>
<li>The "balanced critique" is a simple, nonjudgmental review offering takeaway action steps to help us improve in any aspect of our life.</li>
<li>The challenge: Remove the judgment and find the power in growing from your experiences.</li>
<p>What thoughts run through your head after an interview or personal interaction that didn’t go exactly as planned? Here are some phrases that might sound familiar:</p>
<p>“That was a terrible presentation.”</p>
<p>“I shouldn’t have said that thing about her sister, that was dumb.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, what a bad workout.”</p>
<p>One thing all these statements have in common is that they imply judgment.</p>
<a>shame</a> about the stats on their team’s performance. They want nothing more than to improve and put that feeling behind them. But ironically, it’s often removing the emotion that allows them to take the first step to get back on track.
<p>With my clients, I’ve taught them how to use a very simple, yet extremely effective tool: the balanced critique.</p>
<p>A balanced critique is an evaluation process that is designed to be non-judgmental and strip the emotional reaction to a performance or interaction out. It asks you to consider only two elements:</p>
<ul><li>What is one specific thing you did and want to keep doing?</li> <li>What is one specific thing you want to do differently?</li> </ul>
<p>The power of the balanced critique comes from the incremental improvements it helps us make over time. For example, after a presentation at work, you could sit down at your desk and complete the exercise:</p>
<ul><li>Keep doing: I made good eye contact with people throughout my talk.</li> <li>Do differently: Leave more time for questions at the end.</li> </ul>
<p>Rather than a broad dictate like, “do better,” you now have two clear actions to focus on for your next presentation. </p>
<p>The balanced critique can also apply to your personal life. After a tough night trying to get your kids in bed and asleep at a reasonable hour, before you collapse onto the couch with Netflix, you can get some data for the following evening:</p>
<ul><li>Keep doing: Read another chapter of Little Women together.</li> <li>Do differently: Pull the shades before I start reading so it’s darker in the room.</li> </ul>
<p>Even with something personal that can be quite emotional (believe me, I have two daughters myself!), repeat after me: it’s just data. </p>
<a>goals</a>, when emotion is threatening to overwhelm or derail action.
<a>athlete</a> something to keep doing, and something to do differently.
<p>In the same way, this exercise can help you identify two actions at the end of each day to implement the next. The following night, complete another non-judgmental evaluation of that day, get your two actions for the next day, and so on. </p>
<p>By seeing your performances as data rather than things to be judged, you can take action to improve them in the future. In effect, you can become a data scientist on the things that matter most to you.</p>

<li>steals or begs for food or money</li>
<li>appears to lack needed medical or dental care, immunizations, or glasses</li>
<li>is consistently dirty and has severe body odor</li>
<li>appears to lack sufficient clothing for the weather</li>
<li>abuses alcohol or other drugs</li>
<li>states that there is no one at home to provide care</li>
