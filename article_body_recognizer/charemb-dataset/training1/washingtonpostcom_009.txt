<div><p>Blackistone: Don’t listen to MLB owners spin. Just watch their behavior.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Will MLB standardize the baseball?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>from Insider,</a> based on the work of
<a>physicist Meredith Wills</a>, found that MLB used two different baseballs during the 2021 season — and that players, executives and coaches didn’t know about it. MLB, which owns ball manufacturer Rawlings,
<a>had announced before the season</a> that it would change the ball to shorten its flight somewhat and increase the number of balls put in play.
<a>one player publicly floated a conspiracy theory</a> about MLB’s motives for altering the ball.
<a>MLB announced its crackdown on the use of sticky, grip-enhancing substances</a>, players complained
<a>that they used those substances because the balls are too slippery to control safely</a> and wondered aloud what MLB would rather see — a reduction in sticky stuff usage or more players taking fastballs to the head.

<div><div><p>Angel Reese scored a game-high 22 points and added 12 rebounds for Maryland. Miller finished with 17 points in 31 minutes off the bench. Ali Patberg led the Hoosiers with 18 points.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Miller was particularly aggressive in the second half, and her nine third-quarter points helped Maryland get back into the game.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Just trying to get back for my teammates but also listening to my body,” Miller said. “My body felt pretty good today, so I continue to play.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Frese called Miller “terrific” but added that it is taking time for the team to adjust to having her on the floor.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Gene Wang</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 11:36 p.m. EST|Updated today at 11:47 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>The Virginia men’s basketball team produced a second straight offensive uprising, and its pack-line defense was stifling down the stretch in a 75-65 victory over Clemson on Tuesday night at Littlejohn Coliseum in Clemson, S.C.</p></div>
<div><div><p>After the Tigers made a pair of free throws to get within one, Virginia reeled off seven straight points capped by Kihei Clark’s three-pointer to expand the lead to 67-59 with four minutes to play.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Oklahoma QB Caleb Williams will enter transfer portal but may stay with Sooners</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Cavaliers shot 54.3 percent and outrebounded Clemson 28-23. It was Virginia’s second straight game scoring in the 70s on the heels of a 74-69 win at Syracuse on Saturday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hunter Tyson led the Tigers (9-5, 1-2) with 15 points on 5-for-8 shooting, and David Collins added 14.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Virginia was unable to protect an eight-point lead late in the first half and trailed 37-36 at halftime after it committed three turnovers in the final four minutes and had two players get saddled with their second fouls in that span.</p></div>
<p>A turnover by Franklin led to a jumper from Nick Honor that drew the Tigers within 34-33, and Reece Beekman turned it over on Virginia’s ensuing possession. Al-Amir Dawes capitalized by sinking an open three-pointer to put Clemson ahead.</p>
<div><div><p>The advantage reached 34-26 before Clemson rallied in a first half featuring eight lead changes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what to know about Virginia’s win:</p></div></div>
<div><p>Another Alabama-Georgia showdown brings with it more fretting about college football domination</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A marked improvement</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Cavaliers are still seeking consistent contributions from their reserves but got a combined 15 bench points after posting a 17-0 deficit in that statistic in the first game against Clemson.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Caffaro provided a spark in the first half, scoring six points with a perfect shooting line, in place of starting center Kadin Shedrick, who picked up his second foul with 15:27 to play.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Caffaro finished with eight points, including an emphatic one-handed dunk in the second half over Alex Hemenway, after entering averaging 2.9 points and earning playing time primarily for his gritty defense and hustle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kody Stattmann scored all five of his points in the second half to go with two rebounds and two assists. Fellow guard Taine Murray added two points and a rebound.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Getting to the rim</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Franklin in particular did not settle for contested jumpers, instead beating his defender off the dribble and drawing fouls. He made all four of his free throws and added four rebounds.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Highlights from Alabama’s win over Cincinnati in the Cotton Bowl</p></div>
<a>No. 3 Georgia</a> in its quest for yet another trophy.
<div><div><p>Once Cameron Latu caught a nine-yard touchdown pass on the following series, another title game appearance for the defending champions had been safely assured.</p></div></div>
<a>Ahmad “Sauce” Gardner</a> and Coby Bryant.
<div><div><p>“They gave us all we could handle in this game tonight,” said Saban, whose team still held the Bearcats to a 2-for-15 clip on third and fourth downs.</p></div></div>

<a>loss at Texas AM</a> — one that players now say could have been the turning point of their season — and then there were
<a>narrow escapes against Auburn</a> in a game that required four overtimes and
<a>against Florida</a>, a team that went on to fire its coach.
<div><div><p>Yet now, the Crimson Tide is back to the familiar place where it often finishes the season — in a national championship game.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Chuck Culpepper</div></div>Reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 4:59 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Now the college football country settles in for another week of yakking about whether college football might be in some sort of existential trouble.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s going to be fun — or not.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Can a national sport thrive indefinitely if all of its titles keep getting shoveled toward one corner of a vast country and if the same teams from the Southeast keep showing up on the big stage?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maybe it can, if the people keep watching. They certainly sustain bowl games between 6-6 teams, even if that’s only through plopping deeply into the couch with the digestive onslaught of some holiday meal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Those games differ from January 2020, when there came a splash of variety: a Clemson-LSU championship game, which meant there were actually <i>a whole three states</i> between the contestants.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The first College Football Playoff championship game, in January 2015, pitted Ohio State against Oregon. It seemed fresh and bright, not to mention a resurgence of the Big Ten to counter the crowing of the SEC.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Alabama machine ends Cincinnati’s storybook season</p></div>
<div><div><p>Well, it was some funky outlier.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The whole thing looked like a ratification of a chasm.</p></div></div>
<p>Erick All, the Michigan tight end who made one of the biggest plays of the year with his touchdown romp up the sideline at Penn State, noted the truth. “The margin of error is really low,” he said. “We found that out today.”</p>
<div><div><p>Errors glared more than errors usually would because they just weren’t affordable.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A lot of those guys will be playing on Sundays,” Michigan offensive lineman Andrew Vastardis said.</p></div></div>
<a>per Rivals.com</a>. That follows
<a>on 2021</a>, when Alabama finished No. 1 and Georgia No. 5;
<a>on 2020</a>, when Georgia finished No. 1 and Alabama No. 3;
<a>on 2019</a>, when Georgia finished No. 1 and Alabama No. 2;
<a>on 2018</a>, when Georgia finished No. 1 and Alabama No. 7; and
<a>on 2017</a>, when Alabama finished No. 1 and Georgia finished No. 3. They get recruits, so they win, so they get recruits.
<div><div><p>It can make you wonder something: What the hell happened to Alabama in 2018?</p></div></div>
<div><p>A story about ashes in Green Bay reveals a remarkable life well-lived</p></div>
<div><p>Beyond that, it can make you wonder just how many Alabama-Georgia title bouts we have coming. Georgia Coach Kirby Smart is just getting going at 46; Alabama Coach Nick Saban always looks like he’s just getting going at 70.</p></div>
<div><div><p>They often do happen to be there.</p></div></div>
