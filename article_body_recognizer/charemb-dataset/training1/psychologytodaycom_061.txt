<a>psychotherapy</a> settings who have the sense that something is very wrong with them. But they often report not understanding why they feel that way. In looking back to
<a>childhood</a>, I often hear reframes like “But nothing happened.” “I had a pretty good childhood.” “I didn’t have any
<a>trauma</a>.” So why do you feel that way?
<a>attention</a> to them anymore. Just like the paper cut, you have learned to accept them as part of life. But they still cut just as deep.
<p>Some people actually argue against me and feel invalidated when I say that nothing is wrong with them. “Your problem is that you think you have a problem” is a line I like to use.</p>
<p>You might have beliefs like:</p>
<li>“I’m too emotional”</li>
<li>“I feel vulnerable and like a child when sitting in front of my boss”</li>
<li>“She doesn’t respect me.”</li>
<li>“I’m not special”</li>
<li>“They look down on me and don’t like me”</li>
<p>But statements like this do not have any inherent truth. What happens is that any information that confirms the belief, like small comments from your spouse, will be accepted.</p>
<p>And, they initiate self-fulfilling prophesies.</p>

<a>attachment</a> styles in particular are vulnerable to participating in these types of self-fulfilling prophesies. This is because anyone with an insecure attachment style is likely to suffer from some degree of internalized
<p>It is well documented that people with <a>anxious</a> and fearful attachment styles have negative beliefs about themselves in relationships. These shame-based beliefs will often result in some level of defensive reaction if they are pointed out.</p>
<a>unconscious</a> of their existence. But just watch how defensively a dismissing person reacts to negative interpersonal feedback and you will see the shame coming out clearly.
<p>Here is what you can do to start unpacking that shame and building up an authentic and positive self-image:</p>
<p>1. Stop defending yourself. You don’t always owe other people an explanation.</p>
<p>a. Sometimes when you defend yourself, you give yourself and the other person the message that there is indeed something wrong with you.</p>
<p>2. If someone shames you, simply repeat back to the other person what they said.</p>
<p>a. “My dish towels are an odd color and you want to know why I chose them.”</p>
<p>b. “My outfit makes my thighs look big.”</p>
<p>c. “My beard makes me look old.”</p>
<p>3. Be overt in stating that the other person is shaming you and consider using <a>humor</a> to show the other person how small they are being.</p>

<p>Recommendations for all attachment styles</p>
<li>Know your own emotional system; how accurate it is and how closely your emotions correspond to what is really going on in the social environment.</li>
<li>Learn to control/regulate your emotions; if you are more avoidant, learn to raise the intensity of your emotions. If you are more preoccupied, learn to lower the intensity.</li>
<li>If you are impulsive, learn to delay action and take time outs before initiating or agreeing to have sex.</li>
<li>Communicate and ask questions to get a greater perspective and understanding of the other person's view of things.</li>
<li>Learn to separate your emotions and perceptions from those of your dating partners.</li>

<p>Find out what the context is and what the task is, and be ready to switch set. </p>
<p>You don’t have to completely change your attachment style in order to step out of it and walk in someone else’s shoes for a few minutes.</p>
<p>In order to be able to switch set when it comes to your attachment style:</p>
<li>Remember that you are not your attachment style. It is simply a set of overlearned ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving that has become automatic over time.</li>
<li>Let go of being right and focus on what is going to work for you. If you are attached to your rightness, you will become rigid in your thinking and not be able to switch set.</li>
<p>So, don’t put too much pressure on yourself to think you have to make some monumental change and keep it that way for life. All you have to do is practice, one small set at a time.</p>

<a>John Bowlby</a> and Mary Ainsworth, the hallmarks of a secure attachment figure is that he or she is consistent, available, warm, and responsive — particularly when we are feeling
<a>stressed</a> or in need of support. Being a friend and providing these secure-base functions may be easy enough for the 55% of us with secure attachment styles. But if we are one of the 45% with insecure attachment styles (
<a>fearful</a>), we might struggle either with our friendship expectations or with our ability to provide a secure base to others.
<p>Remember: the quality of a relationship lies in the time you have with that person, not in how the relationship ends. Never judge the quality of a friendship by its ending.</p>
<a> fearful attachment style</a> (both include high levels of attachment anxiety), you are likely to have a stronger need for closeness in your relationships. You may have a chronic feeling of
<a>loneliness</a> and really want a “best friend” and confidante. You also may be overly attuned to subtle cues that you are being left out or marginalized (i.e., not that important) in your friend group.
<a>anger</a> may also have been accompanied by a feeling of
<a>shame</a> because of the belief that there must be something wrong with you, and then shame about yourself because you are so bothered by your friend’s seeming rejection.
<p>This pattern may have happened to you or maybe you have observed one or more of your friends acting this way toward you and you were the perceived offender.</p>

<h1> Radical Acceptance as a Tool for Change </h1>
<h2> Let go of guilt, be decisive, and still get what you want in relationships. </h2>
<p>But criticism never changes anything. Instead, try practicing “radical acceptance” as a means of letting go of the past and growing into the self you want.</p>
<p>You did the deed, and nothing can change that. If you can accept this, it will be easier for you to make needed changes and correct your future behavior…and it will hurt a lot less.</p>
<p>Those of us who were raised in less secure environments may have...</p>
<li>had negative behaviors critiqued without corresponding corrective action.</li>
<li>been ridiculed or shamed for the behavior as if it emanated from something inside of us.</li>
<li>experienced threats of parental withdrawal or abandonment.</li>
<li>not had the behavior pointed out at all and received no feedback or corrective response.</li>

<p>We can layer all kinds of other theories of learning and <a>motivation</a> on top of this example, but it really can be this simple.</p>
<p>1. Initiate an “extinction paradigm”: You need to unlink the feared conditioned stimulus (CS) of being vulnerable and needy from the conditioned response (CR) of rejecting relationship partners and running away.</p>
<li>a. Don’t run. Quiet the brain. Tolerate the extreme (phobic) response to closeness.</li>
<li>b. Realize that the story you are telling yourself about your emotions is something you are probably making up after the fact to explain your own irrational behavior.</li>
<p>Now, go practice, and remember that training animals to engage in new behaviors takes time.</p>

<h1> Understanding the Other: Mentalizing with Attachment Theory </h1>
<h2> Understanding other people's worldviews without having to agree with them. </h2>
<p>The steps to reading someone else’s experiences go like this:</p>
<p>Decenter: Put your story aside for the moment while you prepare to listen to the other person’s experience.</p>
<p>1. Listen to the other person’s experience and ask questions to get at what it is like to be them. You might ask things like:</p>
<li>How did it feel for you to see X?</li>
<li>What is your emotional experience around this?</li>
<li>And how does that fit in with where you see yourself in the world?</li>
<li>If X happens, will that seem like something that would make you feel <a>anxious</a> (scared, angry?)</li>
<li>How are you experiencing this interaction with me right now?</li>
<p>2. Reflect back (verbally and via facial expression)</p>
<li>You’ve seen a lot of X in your life.</li>
<li>I know it’s pretty distressing for you to see.</li>
<li>It seems like this might have a negative impact on you.</li>
<li>I can see why, from what you’ve told me, this might be troubling to you.</li>
<li>I know… you’re not used to us interacting like this (said with a lighthearted smile).</li>
<p>3. Pay <a>attention</a> to your body to get the fullest data set.</p>
<li>See if your <a>right brain</a> can pick up on what they are feeling at the present moment. (Remember that the anxiety, <a>anger</a>, etc. that you might feel could be theirs.)</li>
<p>4. Repeat back to the other person your understanding of their experience, but when it comes to inferring motives, keep it on how they feel and see the world—not looking at it from an adversarial position.</p>
<p>You don’t have to agree or live on the same planet to be able to mentalize another person. Just remember to leave their emotions in their body when you come back home to your side of the street.</p>

<h1> Getting Over a Breakup With (Attachment) Style </h1>
<h2> Learn to let go of that bad relationship without regret or heartache. </h2>
<p>“You Don't Know What You've Got 'Til It's Gone”</p>
<p>People have great difficulty getting over lost relationships… even if they didn’t value those same relationships highly while they were in them.</p>
<p>Consider the following real-life examples:</p>
<p>“I can’t keep myself from thinking that he was the one.”</p>
<p>Said by a preoccupied woman about a dismissing man who repeatedly devalued and distanced from her, broke up with her multiple times, and made her feel unloved and depressed.</p>
<p>“If only I had played things differently, we would still be together. I know that she’s the one I want to be with.”</p>
<p>Said by a dismissing man who a week earlier was stating that he had lost interest in his girlfriend, had gotten back on <a>dating</a> platforms, and was actively talking about being with other women.</p>
<p>“If I had just been different, he would have wanted me.”</p>
<p>Said by a fearfully attached woman about a man who said he loved her while simultaneously <a>cheating on</a> her with upwards of six other women.</p>
<p>These kinds of statements will be familiar to most readers… and most of us have said things like this in our own lives. But…</p>
<p>Each of these statements violates the rules of reason, is illogical, and is an example of “counterfactual thinking.”</p>
<a>dreams</a> of a permanent love relationship, having a different outcome might evoke counterfactual thinking.
<a>attachment</a> styles might be able to adaptively apply this type of simulation because they have (a) learned (through
<a>childhood</a> relationships with healthy adult role models) logical and predictable rules for how relationships work and what outcomes might be expected, and (b) the
<a>emotion regulation</a> needed to look at upward counterfactual simulations without being flooded by intolerable negative emotions.
<h3>The "gold medal" illusion</h3>
<p>Here is what the research has to say:</p>
<p>If you win a silver medal in the Olympics, you should be happier than if you win bronze… right?</p>
<p>In their seminal research, Medvec, Madey, and Gilovich 1995) showed that it is actually the bronze medalist who is happiest.</p>
<h3>How to get over a breakup</h3>
<p>When trying to get over the end of a relationship…</p>
<p>Instead, take a deep breath and feel your feet on the ground. Breathe. Feel your heartbeat. Feel the pain… and stick with the facts. All you really know is what happened and where you are now.</p>

<h3>New research from the field of epigenetics is providing evidence that fearful attachment can be related to genetic changes passed down from one generation to the next (Ein-Dor, Verbeke, Mokry Vrticka, 2018). </h3>
<a>Epigenetics</a> is the study of how changes in the way
<a>genes</a> are expressed are passed down from one generation to the next. For example, your parent may have been traumatized and passed on a Complex
<a>PTSD</a> presentation to you even if you never directly experienced trauma yourself. In this respect, there is a great deal of overlap between the symptoms of Complex PTSD and fearful attachment.
<a>stress</a> response systems look similar to those found in samples of people with PTSD. Lehrner and Yehuda, 2018, reviewed research showing that gene expression can even skip a generation. If your grandmother was traumatized when
<a>pregnant</a> with your mother, then your gene expression may result in your emotional system looking like that of someone with PTSD (or fearful attachment).

<h1> Finding an Attachment-Based Therapist </h1>
<h2> What to look for in a therapist when you want to work on your attachment issues. </h2>
<p> Posted February 7, 2021 </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Attachment? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>psychotherapy</a> is not new. But it has recently come into vogue. This has resulted in the proliferation of websites, blogs, podcasts, videocasts, and therapists all promoting themselves as experts providing attachment-based advice and interventions.
<p>Do I really need an expert in attachment theory?</p>
<a>anxiety</a>. Attachment styles are specific patterns that can be used to help people understand themselves and others.
<p>If, on the other hand, you have come to realize that the problem is not all “those other people” out there causing you problems, and that your struggles probably originate from something within you, then you may want to go deeper.</p>
<p>In talking with a prospective therapist, ask them if they can work with:</p>
<li>Mentalizing and reflective functioning</li>
<li>Attachment styles as patterns of <a>emotion regulation</a></li>
<li>Developmental patterns that underly each of the styles</li>
<li>How you can have different combinations of traits and styles</li>
<li>How they can use all this information to map out a course of change</li>
<li>If they will formally assess your attachment style</li>
<h3>The goal of attachment-based therapy should not be to change your attachment style. Anyone who tells you they can deliver on that is over-promising.</h3>
<p>A good therapist will help you do this by engaging you as a partner in the change process and being fully transparent as they follow Bowlby’s (1988) recommendations of:</p>
<li>(a) providing clients with a secure base</li>
<li>(b) exploring past attachments in close relationships</li>
<li>(c) exploring the relationship with the therapist in the here and now</li>
<li>(d) linking past experiences with present ones</li>
<li>(e) revising internal working models and schemas</li>

<p>I combine these steps with proving to the client a rich <a>education</a> in attachment and underlying processes so that they can stop blaming, understand themselves and others, and practice new ways of being in relationships with other people.</p>

<h1> Changing Your Story: How to Live a Happy Life </h1>
<h2> How to change the story and experience of who you are. </h2>
<li>To change your life, you first need to know who you are and what you are.</li>
<li>Moving past the superficial, and the stories about yourself that others have told you, you can connect with your particular story.</li>
<li>With those questions answered, you can begin to rewrite your story by engaging in the process of narrative reconstruction.</li>
<h3>For change to happen, you need to know who or what you are actually trying to change.</h3>
<p>Try answering this question — say it out loud or write it down: What are you?</p>
<a>ADHD</a>), you might not believe in your ability to change it. You can of course pursue medical interventions including
<a>medication</a>. But these interventions are likely to be compensatory and not change the underlying deficit.
<p>Now answer the question (again out loud): Who are you?</p>
<a>childhood</a> by adults who taught you the basic rules about the world (it is safe and secure… or hostile and scary). This early programming formed the base of your personality.
<p>You can call this act of changing your story narrative reconstruction.</p>
<p>Here are some of the core activities that I do with my clients:</p>
<p>1. Recover (remember or reassemble) the story that your elders and the world gave you in childhood.</p>
<p>a. Write out on a timeline with key events and memories that stand out to you. Try to put it in chronological order as best you can.</p>
<p>b. Recover the experience and the meaning (self-referential thoughts, feelings and <a>memory</a>) and core beliefs about yourself that came out of these various experiences.</p>
<p>c. Imagine interacting with yourself as a child and giving the child a different way of interpreting the events and the related core beliefs that they instilled.</p>
<p>2. Do not give other people’s story of you (you’re so <a>neurotic</a> and emotional! ... or cold and indifferent!) more weight than your own story of you (I am an open and honest person).</p>
<p>3. Create and write your own moral code.</p>
<p>a. For example: “I am rigorously honest even when it hurts me. I stand up in appropriate ways for the rights of people (including me). I am bold and determined.”</p>
<p>4. Create various avatars or archetypes and try them on for size. Imagine being this person and playing a role.</p>
<p>a. Examples: the <a>wise</a> person, wild woman, warrior, wizard, shaman, scholar.</p>
<p>Without stepping fully out of your life, you can change your narrative and try other ideas about yourself on for size. Remember: You write the story. So you can keep what you want of the old and step out boldly to write the new. </p>

<h1> Dismissing Attachment and Narcissism </h1>
<h2> Are people with dismissing attachment really narcissists? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Attachment? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>People often wrongly assume that their partner is a narcissist because they have a dismissing attachment style.</li>
<li>The research neither supports nor rejects a relationship between dismissing attachment and narcissism.</li>
<li>Instead of automatically assuming narcissism is the problem, people should dig deeper and take more time getting to know others.</li>
<h3>The Research on Dismissing Attachment and Narcissism</h3>
<h3>1. Some of the research cited is not actually research.</h3>
<p>It is a set of ideas that researchers suggest would be good to study in the future. Some of the studies that were cited in blogs did not actually find a relationship between dismissing attachment and narcissism at all.</p>
<h3>2. Online search results do not clearly agree. </h3>
<h3>3. When research has detected a relationship between dismissing attachment and narcissism, the relationship has been very weak. </h3>
<h3>4. People need to know how to understand research findings.</h3>
<a>anxious</a> styles get a score if we fill out the survey!).
<p>So, those studies that find correlations between dismissing attachment and narcissism report results from people who, for the most part, do not have dismissing attachment styles and are not narcissists. Go figure?!</p>
<h3>5. There are a similar number of studies out there showing a relationship between anxious/preoccupied attachment and narcissism as there are showing a relationship between dismissing attachment and narcissism.</h3>
