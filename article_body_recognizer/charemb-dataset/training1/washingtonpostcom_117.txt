<div><h1>The worst defenses of Trump on the Capitol riot</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>January 15, 2021 at 12:53 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>On Jan. 6, misinformation promoted by President Trump and his allies fomented a violent attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in Washington. And since then, similar misinformation has been used to try to explain it all away.</p></div>
<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>Let’s run through some of them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>It was antifa or other provocateurs</div></h3></div></div>
<a>promoted by Trump and his allies</a>, despite there being
<a>no real evidence to back it up</a>. The idea was simple: This wasn’t all it was cracked up to be, and some ne’er-do-wells were just trying to make Trump look bad.
<a>turned out to be wrong and was corrected</a>. Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.) baselessly speculated the same day as the attack that it was a “false flag” event. Axios even reported this week that
<a>Trump has been pushing this narrative behind closed doors</a>, with his Twitter ban perhaps being all that’s preventing him from directly sharing it with the world.
<a>no evidence tying antifa to the riots</a>. The FBI said the day after the attack that it had
<div><div><p>This video is well worth a watch:</p></div></div>
<a>used the arrest to again point the finger at alleged antifa involvement</a> and talked about it on his podcast. Donald Trump Jr. liked a tweet highlighting Sullivan’s role.
<div><div><p>Yet the narrative persists and has landed with force, with a poll this week showing 74 percent of Republicans <a>believe antifa was indeed involved</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The supporters weren’t actually acting on Trump’s behalf</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Also during the impeachment debate this week, Rep. Brian Mast (R-Fla.) highlighted a variation of the above theory: the idea that, whoever these people were, they weren’t acting on Trump’s behalf or, more directly, at his request.</p>
<div><div><p>As <a>Philip Bump wrote</a> afterward, though, while nobody had indeed been brought to answer that question in the House’s proceedings, there are examples of those who participated citing Trump’s invitation.</p></div></div>
<a>at the request of the President</a> that all ‘patriots’ come to D.C. on January 6, 2021.” His lawyer also told CNN on Thursday night that his client “
<a>felt like he was answering the call of our president</a>” and that “he was there at the invitation of our president.”
<a>because of Trump’s tweet previewing a “wild” protest</a>. Another told journalist Ronan Farrow that, “The President asked for his supporters to be there to attend.”
<div><div><p>There are also videos of those involved citing Trump’s invitation.</p></div></div>
<a>approved of the scenes in real time</a>.
<div><div><h3><div>The preplanning by some shows Trump didn’t incite</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another prevalent argument is that the increasing evidence of preplanning by some involved in the attempted insurrection suggests Trump didn’t actually incite them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>This is, in many ways, a straw-man argument. Whether Trump bears any responsibility for <a>his comments at the rally that preceded the storming of the Capitol</a>, that’s hardly the only thing he did which has been cited as a cause.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If these federal law enforcement agencies had prior knowledge that this was a planned attack then POTUS didn’t incite anything,” said Trump Jr.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“How does the President incite an attack that was preplanned and already underway before his speech was concluded?” Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) asked rhetorically Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) added: “We know that this was preplanned and it started while the president was speaking. Why is that not in the articles of impeachment?”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Others have promoted similar arguments about the apparent preplanning. “If so, Trump didn’t instantaneously incite them to violence on Jan. 6,” said conservative journalist David Martosko. “Am I wrong here?”</p></div>
<a>lamented that they hadn’t gone as far as Democrats in fighting </a>for their ideals.

<div><span><div><span><div>By David A. Fahrenthold</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Josh Dawsey</div>, </span></div><div><span><div>Shayna Jacobs</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Jonathan O'Connell</div></span></div></span></div>
<div><div><p>Accountant Donald Bender, of the firm Mazars, appeared before <a>a grand jury</a> that was impaneled this fall by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. (D) to weigh potential criminal charges, the people said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The people who described these interviews spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing investigation.</p></div></div>
<a> widely different valuations for the same property</a> at the same time. In some cases, for instance, the Trump Organization provided low valuations to property-tax officials, while telling lenders that the same property was worth much more.
<div><div><p>Bender’s first appearance before the grand jury was brief, the people said. But they said he could return for more testimony in the coming weeks.</p></div></div>
<a>already obtained millions of pages</a> of Trump-related documents from Bender’s firm, after a court battle that went to the Supreme Court twice.
<div><div><p>Now, they have sought testimony from a man who could serve as a human road map to that data.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This line of inquiry appears separate from <a>the felony charges filed over the summer </a>against the Trump Organization’s longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, and two Trump corporate entities.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump himself has not been accused of any crime.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Spokespeople for Vance and New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), who is collaborating with Vance on the criminal probe, declined to comment. So did attorneys for Bender and Trump, and spokespeople for Mazars and Deutsche Bank.</p></div>
<div><div><p>There are two separate long-running investigations of Trump’s financial practices in New York state.</p></div></div>
<a> seeking to take a deposition of Trump </a>himself in early January.
<div><div><p>If Vance or Bragg ever seeks to file charges against Trump himself, the burden of proof will be high. They would need to do more than simply prove the Trump Organization’s numbers were wrong.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They would need to show <i>why </i>they were wrong — to prove that Trump intended to deceive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That is a small circle. Weisselberg was in it. But so far, there has been no indication that he has cooperated with the district attorney’s investigation. Weisselberg’s lawyer declined to comment Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now, prosecutors appear to have expanded their focus to a small set of outside advisers who were not Trump employees but still handled details of Trump’s finances.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last year, for instance, James’s investigators interviewed Sheri Dillon, an outside attorney who worked with Trump on tax and real estate issues, according to<a> court filings</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Vrablic, meanwhile, dealt with many of Trump’s largest business loans<i>. </i>Vrablic left Deutsche Bank in December 2020, <a>according to regulatory filings</a>. Vrablic said at the time that the departure was her decision.</p></div>
<div><div><p>When Vrablic met with Vance’s staff, one of the people said, prosecutors asked her about Trump’s personal role in dealing with the bank. An attorney for Vrablic declined to comment.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Beginning in at least 2003, Bender’s firm has also compiled Trump’s “<a>statements of personal financial condition</a>” that the future president circulated among journalists and others to brag about his finances.</p></div>

<p>While the public may have been surprised by what happened on Jan. 6, the makings of the insurrection had been spotted at every level, from one side of the country to the other. The red flags were everywhere.</p>
<li>Law enforcement officials did not respond with urgency to a cascade of warnings about violence on Jan. 6</li>
<li>Pentagon leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power</li>
<li>The Capitol Police was disorganized and unprepared</li>
<li>Trump’s election lies radicalized his supporters in real time</li>
<div>View all key findings</div>
<p>Intelligence officials certainly never envisioned a mass attack against the government incited by the sitting president.</p>
<p>When that failed, he turned his focus to Jan. 6, historically a pro forma ritual by Congress.</p>
<p>His words triggered rapid action by angry supporters who made plans to go to the nation’s capital, fusing together in a dangerous call-and-response.</p>
<p>Come to Washington, Trump tweeted to his supporters on the Saturday before Christmas, issuing a clarion call for them to gather and protest on Jan. 6: “Be there, will be wild!”</p>
<div><div><p>His supporters immediately responded on the pro-Trump forum TheDonald.win under a thread titled “TRUMP TWEET. DADDY SAYS BE IN DC ON JAN. 6TH.”</p><div>2</div></div></div>
<p>Trump primed his base to view Pence as either a would-be hero or villain, depending on the path the vice president took.</p>
<p>“I hope Mike Pence comes through for us,” he declared at a rally in Georgia two days before the joint session, adding: “If he doesn’t come through, I won’t like him as much.”</p>
<p>Trump’s supporters not only knew where the president wanted them to gather on Jan. 6. They knew whom to target.</p>
<p>Again and again, as the pivotal day approached, top law enforcement officials fielded warnings of what was to come, but failed to respond in kind.</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, leaders had acute fears about widespread violence, and some feared Trump could misuse the National Guard to remain in power, new accounts reveal.</p>
<p>DHS said in a statement that it is participating in ongoing investigations about the security failings and “leveraging lessons learned to enhance its ability to prevent future acts of violence.”</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said the Defense Department “continues to cooperate with the Congress as they examine the events of that day.”</p>
<b> </b>bureau’s work leading up to Jan. 6 as proactive and aggressive. In interviews and statements, they insisted much of the alarming online chatter
<b> </b>agents saw was largely “aspirational” and therefore protected First Amendment free speech — not the detailed evidence of planning needed to launch an investigation or foresee a mass attack on the Capitol.
<p>In a statement, Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich disputed The Post’s investigation as “fake news” and falsely cast people who entered the Capitol that day as “agitators not associated with President Trump.”</p>
<h3><div>102 days to go</div></h3>
<p>The violent events of Jan. 6 had been months in the making.</p>
<p>Trump’s first allusion to the notion that Congress could determine the winner of the presidential race came more than a month before voters went to the polls, on Sept. 26, at a rally outside Harrisburg, Pa.</p>
<p>While the line didn’t register in Harrisburg, congressional Democrats in Washington took note.</p>
<p>Trump’s remark in Pennsylvania confirmed Democratic suspicions. The next day, Pelosi sent a letter to her caucus revealing that a backup plan was already underway.</p>
<p>“The Constitution says that a candidate must receive a majority of the state delegations to win,” Pelosi wrote. “We must achieve that majority of delegations or keep the Republicans from doing so.”</p>
<p>Three days after the Harrisburg rally, Trump made a more menacing declaration at the first presidential debate.</p>
<p>Biden pressed Trump to specifically condemn the Proud Boys, a far-right group known for street brawls with liberal protesters. When Wallace sought an answer, Trump said, "Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.”</p>
<p>On Parler, the social media network popular with conservatives and hate groups, the leader of the Proud Boys, Enrique Tarrio, responded almost immediately:</p>

<p>As Trump made misleading and false claims warning about voter fraud, Hodgkins grew concerned. He had never heard of tactics like “vote harvesting” or seen so much voting by mail.</p>
<p>“Previous elections we didn’t have that kind of thing go on,” he said.</p>
<h3><div>63 days to go</div></h3>
<p>In the wee hours of the morning after the election, as it appeared that he could be in danger of losing, Trump stepped before supporters in the East Room<b> </b>and falsely claimed that the election was rigged.</p>
<p>The next day, Trump tweeted that he “claimed” a win in Pennsylvania, falsely asserting that the state wasn’t allowing vote observers.</p>
<b> </b>used Sharpie pens to mark their ballots. County officials had debunked the rumor, but that didn’t matter.
<p>Holt felt his first pang of worry about where it would all lead when he was monitoring video from Maricopa on Nov. 4. He could see some protesters openly brandishing rifles and handguns.</p>
<p>“You had folks with very extreme views armed,” Holt said. “It wasn’t just an airing of grievances, but some went with intention to intimidate.”</p>
<h3><div>53 days to go</div></h3>
<p>As Trump refused to concede, angry supporters and self-styled militias geared up to fight. Quickly, plans for a “Million MAGA March” in Washington on Nov. 14 galvanized figures known for their hard-edge rhetoric.</p>
<p>Rhodes urged all citizens to be ready to fight while Trump “is commander in chief and has a narrowing window” to act.</p>
<div><div><p>Racine would go on to pass the information to the mayor and other elected D.C. officials, and asked McCord to keep his office updated. The prosecutors flagged it for the FBI’s Washington Field Office.</p><div>13</div></div></div>
<p>On Nov. 14, Mendoza and her team lined up outside the Capitol near dusk and watched as Proud Boys and other protesters paraded across the Capitol grounds. It seemed to her that they were eyeing her officers, sizing them up as they walked past.</p>
<p>As night dragged on, the extremists and groups of counterprotesters began to scuffle — they were soon brawling in the street between the Capitol and the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Mendoza and her crew repeatedly waded into the melee to separate the warring sides. Punches flew. Officers were pushed through the crowd.</p>
<p>By the time it ended, one person was stabbed, four officers were injured, police took eight firearms off protesters, and more than 20 people had been arrested, many for inciting violence.</p>
<p>The fighting was so intense that Mendoza could barely move when she awoke the next morning. The next night, she texted a colleague who had been there:</p>
<p>He was recovering, too, but wrote he’d toasted the job they’d done keeping it from getting worse — attaching a picture of an empty tumbler beside a bottle of Scotch.</p>
<h3><div>48 days to go</div></h3>
<p>But the president was so enamored with the conspiracy theories that he asked advisers if the government could research them — particularly whether foreign countries such as China hacked the vote.</p>
<p>Yes, Trump could exaggerate, Hodgkins knew, but the growing number of voices agreeing with the president was convincing.</p>
<p>He soaked up false allegations of election fraud on Fox News and the right-wing website Daily Caller. He took notice of Stop the Steal rallies popping up around Tampa.</p>
<p>The new movement helped Hodgkins shake off his post-election funk. He wrote a $10 check to the Trump campaign and attended a campaign meetup.</p>
<p>He was ready to help the cause.</p>
<h3><div>36 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Though it was clear that Trump’s rejection of the election was stirring his supporters to action, senior law enforcement officials at the FBI and Justice Department were feeling boxed in.</p>
<p>The president was increasingly irate that officials would not support his unfounded claims of voter fraud. Trump’s threats to Wray rankled. The FBI chief wasn’t looking for any more confrontations with the president.</p>
<p>“We can stop this whenever we want, but we’d rather not do that. It’s not our place,” said one senior official at the time.</p>
<b> </b>optimistic about that, although he felt that as long as Trump’s lawyers were focused mostly on state-related election issues, the Justice Department could steer clear of the fray.
<p>In the latter half of November, some Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), privately pressed Barr to make some kind of public statement knocking down the baseless claims about massive vote count errors.</p>
<p>Barr put them off, but on Nov. 23, he privately told Trump the claims of major problems with voting machines were nonsense.</p>
<b> </b>official recalled, and shift the burden of proof back to the president’s lawyers. Instead, it marked the beginning of the end of Barr’s tenure. Two weeks after the statement, he announced he would leave the job.
<p>Soon, Ali Alexander, Amy Kremer and Trump’s other backers were promoting a second rally in D.C. for Dec. 12 — two days before members of the electoral college would meet in state capitals across the nation.</p>
<p>A New Hampshire Proud Boys group leader calling himself “biggdaddy” promoted the event on Parler and told members not to miss making history to “support our President.”</p>
<p>Rhodes published a national call for Oath Keepers to travel to D.C., specifically calling on law enforcement officers to join the cause, noting they were allowed to carry concealed weapons.</p>
<p>“We especially need LEO and military veterans with pertinent backgrounds for security (combat arms veterans, for example), or civilian equivalents,” Rhodes wrote.</p>
<p>Discussions Holt could see on the social network service MeWe suggested the number of militants who would be traveling to D.C. this time was far greater than in the previous month.</p>
<p>“They’re meeting up with like 750 Proud Boys over there,” wrote one user on a chat group for self-described Three Percenters in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The longtime Republican official stood before the television cameras at a Dec. 1 news conference at the state Capitol, his voice shaking with anger: “It. Has. All. Gone. Too. Far.”</p>
<h3><div>25 days to go</div></h3>
<p>On Dec. 12, just as they had a month earlier, thousands of pro-Trump supporters and protesters converged on D.C., including what police estimated were — as advertised in advance by extremists <b> </b>— about 700 Proud Boys.</p>
<p>“This isn’t over, this is just beginning,” Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson told the crowd.</p>
<p>Alexander told those assembled that if the electoral college endorsed Biden’s victory, his Stop the Steal organization would turn its attention to pressuring Republicans to object to the certification on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Trump flew over the crowd in a helicopter and cheered on his supporters.</p>
<p>With nightfall came chaos.</p>
<p>Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader, paraded a Black Lives Matter banner that someone had ripped from the side of Asbury United Methodist Church, a historic Black church in downtown Washington, and he and others <a>set it on fire</a>.</p>
<p>Within the FBI, many would draw the wrong lesson from that night — that the principal danger posed by Proud Boys or other extremist groups was street clashes. It would prove to be a grave miscalculation.</p>
<p>“Jan. 6 will be the MPD’s problem,” one federal law enforcement official said in December, referring to the D.C. police and echoing an oft-repeated and widely held belief within the FBI at the time.</p>
<p>As it turned out, much of the planning for Jan. 6 was preparation for the wrong kind of violence, in the wrong place.</p>
<h3><div>19 days to go</div></h3>
<p>By mid-December, the <a>electoral college</a> had met and formalized Biden’s victory. Trump had just one more move: disrupting Congress’s count of the votes on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>The exhortation, more than almost any other words or action by Trump after the election, seemed to electrify his most devoted followers in chat groups and<a> websites like TheDonald.win</a>. Some took it as an order.</p>
<p>Among the messages the informant flagged from a MeWe chat group for members of the self-styled militia:</p>
<div><div><p>Here, in a short, simple government form, was a warning about a threat identifying a potential place, period of time and a specific target: a senator from Utah.</p><div>20</div></div></div>
<p>Of the combined tips, an FBI official wrote: “None of these sites have specifics on what they’re going to do once they overturn the DC police. These sites are wanting to do this ‘because it will stop the steal.’ ”</p>
<p>By Tuesday morning, Dec. 22 – less than 48 hours after the first call was recorded in the FBI’s system — the threat assessment was closed, marked at the top: “Does not warrant further investigation at this time.”</p>
<p>Romney’s office could not locate a record that it had been alerted about the tip. An FBI official noted that the tip was shared with the Capitol Police.</p>
<b> </b>fundraising arm of the Republican Attorneys General Association, which
<a>sent robocalls</a> urging people to go to D.C. for the day’s events.
<div><div><p>Stop the Steal also secured permitted space for a rally on the east side of the Capitol on Jan. 6. The organization had applied under a different name.</p><div>23</div></div></div>
<p>On extremist chat groups, Brookie, Holt and McCord saw a new tone of desperation take hold. Trump supporters were going further than before — talking about being citizen soldiers who might have to die for their cause.</p>
<p>Holt focused on the explicit talk of violence, writing in his report that Oath Keepers were “ramping up” pressure on their peers to join them in settling the election by force, “preferably with guns.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is going to happen unless we MAKE it happen,” began an exchange he highlighted in the report, which was passed along to the FBI.</p>
<p>“How much more of this s--- do you need to see … There is only one way. It’s not signs. It’s not rallies. It’s f---ing bullets!” read the post from a person identifying as an Oath Keeper.</p>
<p>Holt and Brookie soon spotted a shift from threats to planning.</p>
<p>At the White House, Pence began telling advisers that he knew he was in the crosshairs — Trump would expect him to act.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, the White House chief of staff was also spurring on a looming confrontation between Trump and his vice president.</p>
<h3><div>16 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Still, D.C. officials relied on it for intelligence, and Harvin assigned an analyst to each new permitted protest that might turn violent and tasked them with gaming out whether the city would be able to handle it.</p>
<p>The Jan. 6 assignment went to the office’s most junior analyst, who quickly became<b> </b>spooked about what he saw. Almost daily, he brought Harvin disturbing new posts found online.</p>
<div><div><p>Extremists from different parts of the country were now coordinating logistics. They were mobilizing an informal army, exchanging tips about how to smuggle weapons into D.C., where to meet, what to wear, he noted.</p><div>28</div></div></div>
<b> </b>Someone could plant an improvised explosive device near the Capitol,
<b> </b>he said. With law enforcement distracted, extremists might then band together and attack government buildings, maybe even the Capitol.
<p>Even as the meeting went on, Trump returned to Twitter and further egged on his supporters:</p>
<p>[Tune into a special Washington Post Live conversation with Donell Harvin and Clint Hickman on Nov. 2]</p>
<p>For their part, Pentagon leaders were not looking for a role in Jan. 6 security.</p>
<h3><div>7 days to go</div></h3>
<p>The shutdown had been months in the making. The bureau advertised in early 2020 that it wanted to sign a new contract for “social media alerting,” describing the service as “mission-critical.”</p>
<p>Donohue was especially worried by the volume of well-known white-supremacist groups whose members said they planned to come, as well as a sense among them that they had the approval of, if not a direct order from, the president of the United States.</p>
<p>All the while, Trump was keeping the pressure up, seeking a soft spot in the system.</p>
<div><div><p>“We have the full support of Trump and Giuliani,” she added.</p><div>34</div></div></div>
<b> </b>It was from a man who said he was an operator at the White House switchboard, calling to inform Hickman that the president wanted to speak to him.
<div><div><p>Now — after midnight in Washington — the president appeared to want to talk to the Maricopa County chairman.</p><div>35</div></div></div>
<p>Hickman again did not respond: “My mom always warned me nothing good happens after midnight.”</p>
<h3><div>6 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Hodgkins put his blue Trump tights on for a New Year’s Eve party.</p>
<p>“As it got closer to Jan. 6, the people I talked to said it was important,” Hodgkins said. “That it was going to be a historical event, maybe the biggest political turnout ever in Washington.”</p>
<div><p>By New Year’s, Sandlin was in touch with around a dozen other Trump supporters making similar plans, including a 34-year-old Idaho man named Josiah Colt and a 31-year-old Las Vegas resident named Nathaniel DeGrave.</p><div>36</div></div>
<div><div><p>Other ominous messages were posted on Parler, which had recently begun communicating with the FBI after its attorneys had decided some posts were so threatening that they required law enforcement notification.</p><div>37</div></div></div>
<b> </b>informant in the Midwest characterized the talk among members of self-proclaimed militias as heavy on planning to travel to D.C., and said the tone had become significantly more “anti-law enforcement.”
<p>“Broad claims and online chatter often lack specificity or detail about concrete plans and participants and, therefore, are not susceptible to disruption,” said an FBI official.</p>
<h3><div>3 days to go</div></h3>
<p>Miller, the acting defense secretary, couldn’t believe the Justice Department wasn’t more concerned.</p>
<p>In the hours that followed, Rosen and the upper tier of the Justice Department would vow to resign should the president push forward with installing Clark.</p>
<p>Still, Clark encouraged Trump. “Mr. President, we can do this,” he told Trump. “We can get it done. History is calling.”</p>
<p>After a three-hour standoff, Trump dropped the idea as unworkable, leaving only one person left who could help him set aside the election and retain the White House: Pence.</p>
<p>Unaware of the high-stakes moment playing out at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, officials at the Capitol were reaching their own fire-alarm moment.</p>
<p>Donohue and Farnam, of the Capitol Police, were sweating the final intelligence assessment for Jan. 6.</p>
<p>For weeks, their analysts had catalogued comments on TheDonald.win and other sites in which Trump supporters had discussed confronting members of Congress and police.</p>
<div><div><p>“Anyone going armed needs to be mentally prepared to draw down on” law enforcement officers, read a post highlighted back in a Dec. 21 internal report.</p><div>40</div></div></div>
<p>It had been a day after that when the FBI told Capitol Police it wasn’t investigating similar threats about overrunning police and arresting lawmakers.</p>

<p>It seemed a menacing signal: Angry people knew where the two leaders lived and were willing to break the law to get their message across. The number of officers assigned to each leader was increased, and the details were issued assault weapons.</p>
<p>Donohue and Farnam made a grim prediction in their final internal report: Jan. 6 would be far more dangerous to the Capitol and its occupants than the pro-Trump rallies in November and December.</p>
<p>Sund agreed not to press for a deployment — unaware of the new threat assessment being prepared by his own intelligence unit that very day.</p>
<h3><div>2 days to go</div></h3>
<div><div><p>David Bowdich, the No. 2 official at the FBI, heard him out but did not sound concerned. Don’t worry, he told the senator, the FBI was on top of it.</p><div>43</div></div></div>
<p>That day, the National Park Service allowed the number of people expected under a permit filed for the rally at the Ellipse to balloon from 5,000 to 30,000.</p>
<p>On Twitter, Trump kept hyping the event.</p>
<p>In short, Sena wrote in an email to all 80 fusion centers, “a significant number of individuals plan to or are advocating for others to travel to Washington, DC to engage in civil unrest and violence.”</p>
<b> </b>surprised that the chief wasn’t on the call. But even for those on the call, many didn’t hear a major shift in Donohue’s risk forecast or fresh cause for alarm.
<p>It was part of a pattern of miscommunication, poor planning and sloppiness inside the department that left Capitol Police completely ill-equipped for what was to come.</p>
<p>Over at the Pentagon, officials remained worried about the level of preparedness.</p>
<p>Eastman’s allies, including Giuliani and former White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon, were huddled blocks away in a makeshift war room at the Willard Hotel, conferring about how to<b> </b>put the plan into motion.</p>
<b> </b>believed his legal theory would clear a path for Pence to overturn the election results, Eastman admitted that he thought it probably wouldn’t work. Furious, Cipollone exploded, berating the lawyer.
<b> </b>on his plan to disrupt the electoral college count. Eastman said that it was an “open question” whether Pence had the ability to unilaterally decide which votes to count.
<p>“You heard him say that, right?” Pence said to the president. Trump did not seem to be paying attention.</p>
<p>The vice president said the law seemed to leave him no choice but to preside over the formalization of Biden’s victory. But, Pence assured the president, he was still willing to read any materials on the topic that Trump wanted him to see.</p>
<h3><div>38 hours to go</div></h3>
<p>On Jan. 5, Hodgkins got off work in Tampa around 12:30 a.m. He’d slept only a couple of hours when he got up, collected his bag and a red Trump flag on a pole, and left for the bus terminal in Sarasota.</p>
<p>His spirits were tempered by a text from his mother, accusing him of being blind to reality.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon, in Des Moines, Douglas Jensen prepared to go, too.</p>
<p>As Trump’s supporters converged on Washington, his allies anticipated the unrest that would follow. “All hell is going to break loose tomorrow,” Bannon told listeners of his podcast on Jan. 5.</p>
<p>Across the city, officials charged with the nation’s security had wildly different expectations about what the next day would bring.</p>
<p>Miller also packed a gym bag with an extra set of clothes to bring to the Pentagon, on the off chance the situation spiraled out of control.</p>
<p>At Justice, Rosen told much of his staff they could work from home, reflecting a general sense of unease about possible traffic disruptions and disorder, but no serious concern that democracy itself could be at risk.</p>
<p>All day, a crowd kept growing blocks from the White House, where Trump surrogates took turns at a microphone declaring the election results were about to be overturned.</p>
<a>situational information report</a> describing alarming calls for violence circulating on TheDonald.win — it included more talk of the “MAGA Cavalry” and people heading for D.C.

<p>The report noted people had shared maps of tunnels underneath Congress, and planned rendezvous spots in the eastern part of the United States to travel together to Washington.</p>
<div><div><p>To some inside the FBI, that cautionary language was a telling example of how the bureau tempered its reaction to threats of violence from White, middle-aged and middle-class Americans.</p><div>52</div></div></div>
<p>While the memo was shared widely at low levels of various agencies, it was not flagged to the leadership of law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>Outside the FBI, the bureau’s handling of the report sent the message that it was not particularly concerned.</p>
<h3><div>18 hours to go</div></h3>
<p>Inside the Oval Office on the evening of Jan. 5, the Colonnade door swung open, filling the room with the frigid night air, but also the sound of the president’s supporters, gathered a couple blocks away.</p>
<p>Still, the president did not seem deflated after Pence’s departure.</p>
<p>Scavino, perched in a chair by the crackling fireplace, read it back:</p>
<p>Trump was getting warmed up. He and Scavino workshopped a second tweet:</p>
<p>The crowd outside suddenly roared loudly. “They’re fired up. They’re fired up,” Trump said. The president looked at Scavino: He didn’t want violence the next day, he said.</p>
<p>Soon a third tweet finished his thought:</p>
<p>For nine weeks, the coda to Trump’s presidency had blared like a siren song. His false claims of election fraud had lured followers to act on their worst instincts. A wave of them had come to Washington, and more were on the way.</p>
<p>Trump turned to an aide and asked what he thought the crowd wanted to hear at the next day’s rally. The aide suggested Trump should highlight all of his accomplishments. “I mean, you’ve had an incredible four years,” he said.</p>
<p>“No, no,” Trump interrupted. “These people are upset. They’re angry.”</p>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Politics</a></div></div><div><h1>Biden’s ‘Summit for Democracy’ includes countries that hardly seem to qualify</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ashley Parker</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>John Hudson</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 6, 2021 at 8:16 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>But on Thursday, Pakistan will join about 110 other countries at a two-day “Summit for Democracy” convened by President Biden, with the goal of rallying the nations of the world against the forces of authoritarianism.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The White House has been less than clear about how it made such calls for the event, which is being overseen by <a>Shanthi Kalathil</a>, coordinator for democracy and human rights at the National Security Council.</p></div></div>
<p>Asked about the criteria, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday, “Inclusion or an invitation is not a stamp of approval on their approach to democracy — nor is exclusion a stamp of the opposite of that, of disapproval,”</p>
<div><div><p>Some of the excluded countries aren’t buying that, however; leaders of Hungary, for one, complain that they are being penalized for their closeness to former president Donald Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Hungarian Embassy in Washington said the Biden administration’s decision was “disrespectful.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But that is not how a lot of countries are viewing it. They see Biden, like a global Santa Claus, declaring that specific countries are naughty or nice, and will be treated accordingly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And the patterns can be hard to discern. Trump did speak flatteringly of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has emerged as something of a model for some in the MAGA movement.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> pandemic. The White House is also inviting activist and business groups, and officials have been engaging nongovernmental organizations for roughly six months, the senior administration official said.
<div><div><p>While the White House is in charge of organizing the summit — and navigating the various diplomatic land mines — it is leaning on the State Department to incorporate the civil society leaders.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Beyond Kalathil, other officials playing roles include Robert Berschinski, the National Security Council’s senior director for democracy and human rights, and Kourtney Pompi, a senior policy adviser at the State Department.</p></div>
<a>Axis of Evil</a>” (Iran, Iraq and North Korea) in the global fight against terrorism.
<div><div><p>The angry op-ed, Mitchell said, underscored that an invite to the summit — and the designation of being democracy-friendly — is viewed as significant globally.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The exclusion of China, and the inclusion of Taiwan, has infuriated Beijing, an outcome the Biden administration anticipated. But some Asian allies, worried about how China might view their participation in the summit, are also uneasy.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Not only is China very hostile towards it, but a lot of countries inside Asia, even democracies, are ambivalent,” said a senior U.S. administration official.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even local or state-level events, such as a <a>Republican-led overhaul of the electoral process in Wisconsin</a>, have prompted alarm among democracy activists.</p></div></div>
<a>Washington Post op-ed Saturday</a> that the United States would not tolerate behavior like Wisconsin’s in another country.
<div><div><p>Yet in some ways, Biden’s efforts to wrestle with the issue domestically make the summit more critical, some experts said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added: “This is way for us to say, ‘Wait a second. It does matter. And we’re actually showing you how this works in terms of having a major summit.’ ”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The idea of the inquiry quickly became partisan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it was rejected by most House Republicans and subsequently blocked by Senate Republicans.</p></div></div>
<div><p>House Democrats then decided to create a special investigative committee, and the House passed a resolution establishing one on a 220-to-190 vote on June 30, with two Republicans joining Democrats in voting in favor of the panel.</p></div>

<div><div><p><b>What has the House Select Committee done?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The task of wading through this torrent of information has been divided among five teams that the committee initially put together for its staff of about 40:</p></div></div>
<li>One team, dubbed “Inside the Fence,” is devoted to understanding the preparation and response to the event by federal and local law enforcement.</li>
<li>A second, called “follow the money,” is examining the funding for demonstrations against the election results.</li>
<li>A third is investigating online misinformation and extremist activity.</li>
<li>A fourth is looking at the pressure campaigns in Washington and in state capitols to overturn election results or delay certification of electors.</li>

<p>At 2:12 p.m. on Jan. 6, supporters of President Trump began climbing through a window they had smashed on the northwest side of the U.S. Capitol. “Go! Go! Go!” someone shouted as the rioters, some in military gear, streamed in.</p>

<p>Even as he did so, Trump did not move to act. And the message from those around him — that he needed to call off the angry mob he had egged on just hours earlier, or lives could be lost — was one to which he was not initially receptive.</p>
<div><p>“It took him awhile to appreciate the gravity of the situation,” Graham said in an interview. “The president saw these people as allies in his journey and sympathetic to the idea that the election was stolen.”</p></div>
<b> </b>And the man who had long craved the power of the presidency abdicated many of the responsibilities of the commander in chief.
<div><div><h3><div> 'Fight for Trump' </div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The day began ominously, with a “Save America March” on the Ellipse devoted to perpetuating Trump’s baseless claims that somehow the 2020 election was stolen from him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The president, too, ended his speech with an exhortation, urging the crowd to give Republicans “the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue,” he concluded.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What Trump said before his supporters stormed the Capitol, annotated</p></div>
<div><div><p>By then, West Wing staffers monitoring initial videos of the protesters on TV and social media were already worried that the situation was escalating and felt that Trump’s tweet attacking Pence was unhelpful.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the president himself was busy enjoying the spectacle. Trump watched with interest, buoyed to see that his supporters were fighting so hard on his behalf, one close adviser said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Conway also told the aide that she had received calls from the D.C. mayor’s office asking for help in getting Trump to call up the National Guard.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Shortly after 2:30 p.m., the group finally persuaded Trump to send a tweet: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement,” he wrote. “They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Twitter missive was insufficient, and the president had not wanted to include the final instruction to “stay peaceful,” according to one person familiar with the discussions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div> 'You're very special' </div></h3></div></div>
<p>McCarthy did eventually reach Trump, but later told allies that he found the president distracted. So McCarthy repeatedly appeared on television to describe the mayhem, an adviser said, in an effort to explain just how dire the situation was.</p>
<div><div><p>At one point, <b/>Trump worried that the unruly group was frightening GOP lawmakers from doing his bidding and objecting to the election results, an official said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Trump aides did three takes of the video and chose the most palatable option — despite some West Wing consternation that the president had called the violent protesters “very special.”</p></div></div>
<p>Amid the chaos, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) had implemented a 6 p.m. curfew for the city, and as darkness fell, the Secret Service told West Wing staff that, save for an essential few, everyone had to leave the White House and go home.</p>
<div><div><p>At 6:01 p.m., Trump blasted out yet another tweet, which Twitter quickly deleted and which many in his orbit were particularly furious about, fearing he was further inflaming the still-tense situation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Thirteen minutes later, at 6:14 p.m., a perimeter was finally established around the Capitol. About 8 p.m., more than six hours after the initial breach, the Capitol was declared secure.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The following evening, on Thursday, Trump released another video, the closest advisers say he is likely to come to a concession speech.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>His calls for healing and reconciliation were more than a day too late, many aides said. Yet as Trump watched the media coverage of his video, he grew angry.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The president said he wished he hadn’t done it, a senior White House official said, because he feared that the calming words made him look weak.</p></div></div>

<h1>A sprawling investigation: What we know so far about the Capitol riot suspects</h1>

<b> </b>for continuing to warn that Trump’s rhetoric led to violence, and some GOP lawmakers
<a>have echoed</a> the former president in attempting to minimize the destruction that day.
<p>In fact, the ongoing criminal probe has swept up at least 411 suspects in what federal officials have called an unprecedented domestic attack on a branch of the U.S. government.</p>
<a>their first guilty plea and cooperation deal</a>, charged about
<b> </b>75 people with assaulting police and filed conspiracy charges against members of two far-right extremist groups. Those charged publicly so far with federal crimes hail from 259
<p>Yet even as prosecutors build cases alleging prior planning and coordination, the majority of those facing criminal charges were not known members of self-styled militias or other organized extremist groups, the filings show.</p>
<div><div><section><div><h3>How they have been charged</h3></div></section></div></div>
<p>The Jan. 6 riot has produced one of the most sprawling and complex investigations in the FBI’s history. In scale and scope, officials have said, only the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks is comparable.</p>
<b> </b>of the charges filed are potential felonies, and slightly more than half of the people charged face at least one felony.
<h4>Potential felony charges filed so far</h4>
<p>[<a>Hundreds of people stormed the Capitol. Most won’t face hefty prison terms, legal experts say.</a>]</p>
<p>As the charged cases proceed through the courts, the prosecutors will have to spell out how much of their evidence points to planning by some of the attackers, how much was spontaneous and what remains uncertain about the origins of the riot.</p>
<div><div><section><div><h3>Ties to political or extremist groups</h3></div></section></div></div>
<p>More than 50 people charged in connection to the Capitol riot have known affiliations with a political or extremist group, according to court records, and they account for nearly all the <a>conspiracy charges</a> brought so far by prosecutors.</p>
<p>The two far-right organizations that have come under the most scrutiny from the FBI for their alleged roles in the assault on Congress are the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.</p>

<div><div><section><div><h3>Suspects with government and military backgrounds</h3></div></section></div></div>
<a>military backgrounds</a>. Of those, four are currently serving in a part-time capacity in the National Guard or Army Reserve. On Thursday, federal prosecutors
<a>charged </a>a Marine Corps officer with five counts, including assaulting and obstructing police during a civil disorder — the first known active-duty service member charged in the case.
<p>At least 17 of those charged were current or former members of law enforcement, including two former New York City police officers and two current officers from Rocky Mount, Va.</p>
<div><div><section><div><h3>A fraction remain detained</h3></div></section></div></div>
<p>At least 53<b> </b>defendants are currently detained — about 13 percent of the total who have been charged in federal court and nearly one-quarter of the 230 who face felony charges.</p>
<p>For example, about half of Jan. 6 defendants charged with assaulting police remain held, about 30 of 75.</p>
<p>About a dozen are alleged members or associates of extremist groups such as the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>All defendants jailed pending trial are men except for one transgender woman, and nearly three-fourths are in their 30s and 40s, with the rest evenly split between older and younger, with a median age of 37.</p>
<p>About 15 are U.S. military veterans, and one is a former police officer.</p>
<p>The youngest defendant held is 21 — alleged Oregon Proud Boys member Jonathanpeter Klein, who has pleaded not guilty and sought release to home detention, arguing he is not a flight or safety risk.</p>
<p>The oldest person jailed is Lonnie L. Coffman, 70, of Falkville, Ala., accused of parking a pickup truck with 11 molotov cocktails and five loaded weapons on Capitol Hill. He has pleaded not guilty to firearms charges.</p>
<p>All of those currently detained face felony charges punishable by at least a year in prison, except one misdemeanor defendant, who is appealing his detention order.</p>
