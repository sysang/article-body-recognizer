<h1>VA loans: What are they, and how do you get one?</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>For active and retired military service members, a VA loan could be the ticket to securing an affordable mortgage loan with low rates and no down payment. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>If you’re a current service member, veteran or an eligible family member looking to buy a home or refinance your current mortgage, a VA loan could be the ticket to saving a considerable amount of money. </p>
<p>A VA loan is a type of mortgage loan backed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs that comes with several benefits to borrowers. </p>
<h2>VA loan vs. conventional mortgage</h2>
<a>private mortgage insurance</a> (PMI) and come with no down payment requirements. These two mortgage types differ in other ways, too.
<li>PMI: VA loans don’t require private mortgage insurance. </li>
<li>Interest rates: VA loans are still subject to a credit check but often offer lower interest rates than conventional home loans. </li>
<li>Lending policy: VA loans are reserved for eligible military service members, veterans and service member spouses. You’ll also need a VA-backed home loan Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and must meet lender credit, income and other requirements. </li>
<h3>Conventional home mortgage loans</h3>
<li>Down payment: Lenders typically want homebuyers to make a down payment of at least 20% of the loan total. </li>
<li>PMI: Lenders require <a>private mortgage insurance</a> on conventional home loans with a down payment of less than 20% of the loan amount.</li>
<li>Interest rates: Your credit score and history, loan length and other factors affect the interest rate on a conventional loan.</li>
<li>Lending policy: Qualifying for a conventional home loan depends primarily on meeting a lender’s underwriting requirements, including credit score and history, debt-to-income ratio and other factors.</li>
<p>Credible allows potential homebuyers to <a>compare mortgage rates</a> easily.</p>
<h2>Qualifications you’ll need for a VA loan</h2>
<li>If you’re currently on active duty, you must have served 90 consecutive days of active service.</li>
<li>If you’re a veteran, you must have served at least 90 days of active service, depending on when you served.</li>
<li>If you are or were in the Reserves or National Guard, you must have served at least six years and meet other requirements.</li>
<li>You are the spouse of a service member that has died in the line of duty or because of a service-related injury.</li>
<p>The VA offers several home loan programs to help borrowers buy a home, fix up an existing home or refinance a current mortgage loan. Below are the options currently available through the VA. </p>
<h3>VA interest rate reduction refinance loan (IRRRL)</h3>
<h3>VA Native American Direct Loan (NADL) </h3>
<p>VA loans typically take up to 55 days to process, similar to other types of mortgages. The specific time may depend on your lender and its loan volume. </p>
<p>Looking for a home loan? Credible can help you <a>compare mortgage rates</a>.</p>
<a>no down payment required.</a>
<p>To qualify for full entitlement, you must meet one of the following requirements:</p>
<ul><li>Never used your home loan benefit</li><li>Paid a previous VA loan in full and sold the property</li><li>Used your home loan benefit but had a short sale and repaid the loan in full</li></ul>
<p>Keep in mind that VA loan limits don’t restrict how much you can borrow, only how much of the loan is guaranteed by the federal government. Private lenders set loan limits based on your credit history, income, assets and other factors. </p>
<p>When you take out a VA loan, you must pay an additional VA loan funding fee. </p>
<p>Lenders charge this one-time fee to help lower the cost of the loan for U.S. taxpayers. VA loan borrowers that meet specific program requirements aren’t required to pay a funding fee. As of Jan. 1, 2020, funding fees for each VA loan type are:</p>
<ul><li>VA-backed purchase and construction loans: 1.4% to 3.6%</li><li>VA-backed cash-out refinancing loans: 2.3% to 3.6%</li><li>Native American Direct Loan (NADL): 0.5% to 1.25%</li><li>Other VA loans: 0.5% to 2.25%</li></ul>
<p>The cost of the funding fee depends on factors such as the loan type, amount borrowed, down payment amount and whether it's your<a> first time </a>using a VA loan. </p>
<h3>Qualifying as a surviving spouse</h3>
<p>If you’re the surviving spouse of a veteran, you may be eligible for a VA loan. To qualify, your veteran spouse must meet one of the following requirements: </p>
<li>Died during service or from a service-connected disability and you didn’t remarry</li>
<li>Died during service or from a service-connected disability and you didn’t remarry before you were 57 or before December 16, 2003</li>
<li>Had been totally disabled and then died (in some cases, the disability doesn’t need to be the cause of death)</li>
<p>If qualified, you can apply for a COE and proceed through the loan approval and home buying process through a private lender. </p>
<h3>VA property requirements</h3>
<li>Appropriate electric, heating and cooling systems</li>
<li>No wood-destroying insects</li>
<li>Adequate sewage disposal</li>
<li>Reasonable accessibility</li>
<li>Appropriate ventilation in the attic and crawl space</li>
<p>VA loans are a great option for active service members, veterans and their spouses, and can make <a>buying a home</a> a much more viable option.</p>

<h1>Putin wants US and allies to guarantee NATO won't expand east</h1>
<h2>Tensions soar as Russian troops amass near Ukraine</h2>
<p>The <a><u>Russian</u></a> president on Tuesday reiterated his demand for guarantees from the U.S. and its allies that NATO will not expand eastward, blaming the West for "tensions that are building up in Europe." </p>

<p>Putin charged Tuesday that if U.S. and NATO missile systems appear in Ukraine, it will take those missiles only minutes to reach Moscow. </p>
<p>Putin noted that NATO has expanded eastward since the late 1990s while giving assurances that Russia’s worries were groundless. </p>

<h1>Cash-out refinance vs. home equity loan: Which to pick</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>Cash-out refinancing and home equity loans can both help you turn your home equity into cash. One replaces your existing mortgage loan, while the other is a second loan. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>What is a cash-out refinance?</p>
<p>A <a>cash-out </a><a>refinance </a>replaces your existing mortgage loan with a new one. Your new loan will be larger than your current one, and you’ll take the difference between the two balances in cash.</p>
<p>The requirements for a cash-out refinance depend on your mortgage lender and loan product, but, generally, to qualify for a conventional loan you’ll need a minimum of:</p>
<ul><li>Credit score: 640 to 700</li><li>Debt-to-income ratio: 36% to 45%</li><li>Equity: 20%</li></ul>
<a>compare refinance rates and terms</a> from multiple lenders all in one place. Get prequalified in just a few minutes, and start saving on interest today.
<p>What is a home equity loan?</p>
<a>home equity loan</a> is a type of second mortgage. These are loans against your
<a>equity </a>in the home, and once you close, you’ll get the balance of the loan in cash. You’ll then pay it back (in addition to your existing mortgage) month after month until you’ve paid in full.
<p>Again, the minimum <a>requirements for a home equity loan</a> will vary by lender, but here’s what you can generally expect:</p>
<ul><li>Credit score: 620</li><li>Debt-to-income ratio: 43%</li><li>Equity: 15 to 20% </li></ul>
<p><i>Learn More: </i><a><i>Personal loan or home equity loan: Which is better?</i></a></p>
<p>How cash-out refinancing and home equity loans are similar</p>
<p>Both cash-out refinances and home equity loans let you turn your home’s equity into cash. </p>
<p>Aside from this, they also have the following things in common:</p>
<li>You can use the proceeds however you like. There’s no limit to how you can spend your money once you’ve closed on the loan.</li>
<li>You’re paid immediately. You’ll receive a lump sum payment no matter which product you choose to go with.</li>
<li>You’ll pay the loan off monthly. In both cases, you’ll pay your loan off monthly, just as you do your current mortgage.</li>
<p>How cash-out refinancing and home equity loans are different</p>
<p>The main difference between these two options is that cash-out refinancing requires just one monthly payment, while home equity loans require two (your existing mortgage plus the home equity loan payment).</p>
<p>Here are some other ways the two products differ:</p>
<li>Interest rates: Cash-out refinances can have lower interest rates than home equity loans.</li>
<li>Closing costs: With home equity loans, your lender will usually pay many of your closing costs. This is not the case with cash-out refinances.</li>
<li>Impact on original loan: A cash-out refinance fully replaces your existing mortgage loan and its monthly payment. A home equity loan is an additional mortgage on top of your current one.</li>
<a>Visit Credible today to explore current refinancing options</a> and find a loan that’s right for you.
<p>When to choose a cash-out refinance</p>
<p>A cash-out refinance might be your preferred option if:</p>
<li>You want just one single monthly payment. If you’re not able to manage a second monthly payment in addition to your primary mortgage, a cash-out refinance may be your best bet.</li>
<li>You want a lower interest rate. Cash-out refinances generally come with lower interest rates than home equity loans. If interest rates are lower than what’s on your current loan, you’ll save even more.</li>
<p><a>Consider using an online marketplace like Credible</a> during your search for a cash-out refinance. They can help make sure you’re getting a great rate and lender for your needs. </p>
<p>When to choose a home equity loan</p>
<p>Generally, a home equity loan will work better for you if:</p>
<li>You’re happy with the terms on your current mortgage. If a cash-out refinance would mean getting an interest rate much higher than your current one, a home equity loan may be a better option.</li>
<li>You think you’ll sell the home in the near-term. Since refinances come with more closing costs, they might not make sense if you plan to sell soon (you may not recoup the expenses before then). In this scenario, a home equity loan may be best.</li>
<li>You only need a small amount. Because of the higher closing costs on refinances, home equity loans are also better for smaller expenses — especially if you know you can pay it off quickly.</li>
<p>An alternative to cash-out refinancing and home equity loans</p>
<a>home equity lines of credit</a> — are a third way to tap your home equity. These are similar to home equity loans in that they’re borrowed in addition to your existing mortgage. The difference is that your funds aren’t distributed to you in a lump sum.
<p>Instead, HELOCs function more like credit cards. You can draw funds from your line of credit as needed, usually over a period of 10 years. Once that period expires, you’ll start repaying the money spent, plus interest.</p>
<p>A HELOC is typically best if:</p>
<li>You’re not sure how much cash you need or you want to use it for a variety of expenses. HELOCs let you withdraw cash as you need it — much like a bank account or credit card.</li>
<li>You’re comfortable with a variable interest rate. Unlike refinances and home equity loans, HELOCs usually come with variable rates that can rise over time.</li>
<li>You don’t want to start paying off the loan right away. You won’t start paying down the balance until your draw period expires — usually around 10 years.</li>
<p>If you’re deciding between a home equity loan or HELOC vs. a cash-out refinance, be sure to consider your goals, budget, and unique financial situation. All three options can be smart ways to access your home equity.</p>

<h1>Refinancing for home improvements: how does it work?</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>A cash-out refinance takes the equity you’ve built up in your home and turns it into cash. It can be a low-cost option to pay for home improvements. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>Spring and summer are usually the busiest times of the year for homebuying, but the housing market isn’t the only thing that’s hot right now — so is the market for home renovations. </p>
<p>If <a>home renovations</a> are on your wish list and you don’t have enough cash on hand to cover them, you’re not out of luck. There are several options for funding home improvements, including refinancing your home.</p>
<p>With <a>Credible</a>, you can compare mortgage refinance rates and prequalify in just three minutes.</p>
<h2>Can I refinance for home improvements?</h2>
<p>If you have equity in your home, you can turn some of that equity into cash with a <a>cash-out refinance</a>.</p>
<p>In a traditional mortgage refinance, you don’t take any equity out of the home. Instead, you pay off your current mortgage with a new loan — usually to get a lower interest rate or switch from an adjustable-rate to a fixed-rate mortgage.</p>
<a>yours to use as you wish</a>, including paying for home renovations.
<h3>How much can I borrow by financing for home improvements?</h3>
<p>The amount you can borrow in a cash-out refinance depends on the value of your home and how much equity you have. Typically, homeowners aren’t able to withdraw all their equity.</p>
<p>Most lenders limit the loan-to-value (LTV) to 80%, meaning after your cash-out refinance, you must still have 20% equity remaining.</p>
<p>Lenders may have different maximum CLTVs for second homes, investment properties, and multi-unit housing, so check with your lender for their rules and limitations.</p>
<p><a>HOW TO BUY A HOUSE IN 2021: 8 TIPS FOR WINNING THE COVID HOMEBUYING SEASON</a></p>
<h2>What are the pros and cons of refinancing for home improvements?</h2>
<a>biggest asset</a>, and your mortgage may be the largest debt you ever take on. Plus, it’s where you live. That’s why you should carefully consider the
<a>home renovations</a>, those renovations may increase the resale value of your home and, in turn, create more equity. Just keep in mind that not all home improvements increase home values.
<p>Possible tax benefits: Mortgage interest can be tax-deductible if you itemize your deductions. Plus, the cash you take from your equity isn’t considered taxable income.</p>
<p>Reviewing mortgage refinance rates on <a>Credible </a>could help you find a lower rate for financing your home improvement project.</p>
<h2>Should I refinance for home improvements?</h2>
<p>The decision to take a cash-out refinance for home renovations is a personal one. It depends on your overall financial situation, your goals, and how much equity you have in your home.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re considering a cash-out refi to get a lower interest rate and you have upgrades you want to do, cashing out equity can be a <a>smart way</a> to achieve both those goals. </p>
<p>However, if the interest rate on the new loan would be higher than the rate you’re currently paying, you should explore alternatives to refinancing or wait until you have enough money saved to pay for the renovation in cash.</p>
<h2>How can I qualify for a home improvement refinance?</h2>
<p>While the exact requirements vary from lender to lender, home improvement refinance loans backed by Fannie Mae require:</p>
<li>A minimum credit score of 640</li>
<li>A maximum debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of 45%, meaning all your monthly debt payments, including your new mortgage payment, must be less than 50% of your monthly gross income</li>
<p>Check out <a>Credible </a>to compare mortgage rates and see if you can qualify for a mortgage refinance.</p>

<p>In his recent statements, Putin outlined the Kremlin’s concerns about Ukraine hosting NATO offensive weapons systems if it becomes a member of the Alliance, an outcome Moscow views as an unacceptable threat to Russia’s security. </p>
<p>Putin also said last Tuesday that even if Russia’s requirements for security guarantees are met, Russia cannot trust U.S. assurances. </p>
<p>The Kremlin’s recently proposed U.S.-Russia treaty on security measures is full of un-meetable demands that intentionally violate the fundamentals of U.S. foreign policy, which seeks to prevent Russia from emerging as a rival power in Eurasia. </p>
<p>Washington believes that post-Soviet states, such as Ukraine, have the right to develop as democracies, while Moscow views them as its security buffer and sphere of influence.</p>
<p><a>PUTIN WANTS US AND ALLIES TO GUARANTEE NATO WON'T EXPAND EAST</a></p>
<p>Putin is therefore building a case for taking action against Ukraine regardless of how the US responds to his demands. "We were lied to. Blatantly," Putin stated in his staged press conference with the Russian and foreign media. </p>
<p><a>A US-RUSSIA WAR OVER UKRAINE WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC</a></p>
<a>large scale high intensity conflict with Russia.</a> On the same day, Foreign Minister Lavrov accused the U.S. of trying to
<a>provoke a "tiny war" in Ukraine</a>, in order to later blame Russia.
<p>Regretfully, the Biden administration’s "experts," like Obama’s before them who fecklessly sought a "reset" with Russia, are likely to fall into Putin’s trap.</p>

<p>If you're still drawing a blank as 2021 wraps up, here's a short glossary:</p>
<p>The metaverse broadly refers to shared, immersive digital environments which people can move between and may access via virtual reality or augmented reality headsets or computer screens.</p>
<a>Microsoft</a> (MSFT.O) to Match Group (MTCH.O) have discussed their roles in building the metaverse. In October,
<a>Facebook</a> (FB.O) renamed itself Meta to reflect its new metaverse focus.
<p>Web3 is used to describe a potential next phase of the internet: a decentralized internet run on the record-keeping technology blockchain.</p>
<p>This model, where users would have ownership stakes in platforms and applications, would differ from today's internet, known as Web2, where a few major tech giants like Facebook and Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google control the platforms.</p>
<p><a>NFT IS 2021 WORD OF THE YEAR AMID CRYPTOCURRENCY SURGE, COLLINS DICTIONARY SAYS</a></p>
<p>Tech companies waxed lyrical this year about tools for live audio conversations, rushing to release features after the buzzy, once invite-only app Clubhouse saw an initial surge amid <a>COVID-19</a> lockdowns. </p>

<p>Non-fungible tokens, which exploded in popularity this year, are a type of digital asset that exists on a blockchain, a record of transactions kept on networked computers.</p>
<p>In March, a work by American artist Beeple sold for nearly $70 million at Christie's, the first ever sale by a major auction house of art that does not exist in physical form.</p>
<p>Decentralizing, or the transfer of power and operations from central authorities like companies or governments to the hands of users, emerged as a key theme in the tech industry.</p>

<p>A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is generally an internet community owned by its members and run on blockchain technology. DAOs use smart contracts, pieces of code that establish the group's rules and automatically execute decisions.</p>
<p>In recent months, crowd-funded crypto-group ConstitutionDAO tried and failed to buy a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution in an auction held by Sotheby's. </p>

<p>GameFi is a broad term referring to the trend of gamers earning <a>cryptocurrency</a> through playing video games, where players can make money through mechanisms like getting financial tokens for winning battles in the popular game Axie Infinity.</p>
<p>The term covers all cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin, ranging from ethereum, which aims to be the backbone of a future financial system, to Dogecoin, a digital currency originally created as a joke and popularized by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.</p>
<p><a><u>APPLE CEO TIM COOK TALKS CRYPTOCURRENCY FUTURE</u></a></p>
<p>Tesla released a test version of its upgraded Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, a system of driving-assistance features - like automatically changing lanes and make turns - to the wider public this year.</p>
<p>The name of the much-scrutinized software has itself been contentious, with regulators and users saying it misrepresents its capabilities as it still requires driver attention.</p>
<p>"Fabs," short for a semiconductor fabrication plant, entered the mainstream lexicon this year as a shortage of chips from fabs were blamed for the global shortage of everything from cars to gadgets.</p>

<h1>Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey appear to mock ‘Web3,’ the latest buzzword in tech</h1>

<div><div><h2>Crypto investors make 2022 predictions</h2> <p>Pomp Investments founder Anthony Pompliano analyzes the ‘monetary and technology revolutions’ in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. </p></div></div>

<p>"It’s somewhere between a and z," replied Twitter’s former CEO, seeming to make a thinly-veiled jab at a16z, a venture capital firm that has invested heavily in blockchain and cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>The term "Web3" is used broadly to refer a decentralized internet that will run on the record-keeping technology blockchain, rather than on centralized services. </p>

<p>In this model, users would have ownership stakes in platforms and applications and would supposedly contrast with today’s model – Web2 – where a few major players like Facebook and Alphabet’s Google control the platforms. </p>
<p>Musk's and Dorsey’s tweets sparked a debate among critics who disagreed with their conclusions on Web3. </p>

<p>Dorsey later downplayed the notion that Web3 will ever be truly decentralized as venture capital firms and their limited partners will be in the driving seat. </p>

<p>However, wireless industry group CTIA has argued that nearly 40 countries are already safely using 5G C-band transmissions. </p>

<h1>Swedish COVID vaccine pass microchip maker addresses privacy concerns</h1>
<h2>Over 4,000 Swedes have similar chip implants for a wide range of uses</h2>
<h2>Omicron detected in all 50 states</h2>
<p>St. Joseph’s Institute for Autoimmune Diseases director Dr. Bob Lahita discusses the transmissibility of the omicron variant and the anti-viral COVID pills that were recently authorized by the FDA for emergency use.</p>
<p>The Swedish developer of a <a>COVID-19</a> <a>vaccine</a> passport <a>chip</a> that individuals implant in their skin has addressed privacy concerns over putting sensitive information in such an easily accessible form. </p>

<p>That same technology could allow another person to steal the information, but to do so they would need to use a smartphone and get it close to the implant to steal the information by activating the chip. </p>
<p>Sjoblad also assured that the chip cannot transmit a person’s location – another significant privacy concern. </p>

<p>"They don't have a battery, they cannot transmit a signal by themselves, so they are basically passive," Sjoblad said. "They sit there asleep."</p>
<p>Over 4,000 Swedes have opted for similar chip implants over the past few years, which can carry a variety of information such as business cards, public transport cards or even car key fobs, according to <a>NPR</a>. </p>
