<div><div><p>Nathan Asher was scrolling through pages and pages of therapists. Starting in January, just shy of a year into the pandemic, they were looking for someone who could help with what felt like a crescendo of anxiety.</p></div></div>
<div><div>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</div></div>
<div><div><p>But every search, Asher would come up short.</p></div></div>
<p>“I didn’t need an addiction therapist, I didn’t need a faith therapist, I didn’t need a relationship therapist,” they said. “I was calling and sending emails and very rarely would I get a reply back.”</p>
<div><p>A youth mental health crisis was already brewing. The pandemic made it worse, surgeon general says.</p></div>
<a>impact</a> on communities of color.
<div><div><p>For some young people, increased demand for online therapy meant providers were booked and unavailable in times of need.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It took three months before Asher was able to find a therapist “because all of the telehealth therapists were full, and a lot of normal therapists were not wanting to make the switch to teletherapy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When they finally found someone to connect with, the therapist suggested Asher get an evaluation for ADHD. That evaluation wouldn’t happen until June.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You start to realize, ‘Wow, this system is not made to support me,’ ” Asher said. “This system is not made to be accessible.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even before the pandemic, “we were in the middle of a children’s mental health crisis,” said Nathaniel Counts, a senior vice president of behavioral health innovation for Mental Health America.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said in the decade before the pandemic, rates of adolescent major depressive episodes surged, and rates of children presenting in the emergency department for self-harm and suicidal ideation were increasing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then the pandemic hit, bringing its own set of burdens.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In big ways and small, the enduring public health crisis may have dramatically changed the daily world of a child or teen.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Some of it is just broadly this generation being a bit more open in talking about their struggles,” she said. “And the plethora of the social world and the Internet makes those conversations more public.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>So Pittala, now an 18-year-old senior at Newark Charter School in Delaware, started a chapter of Bring Change to Mind, a national nonprofit with student-led clubs at high schools across the country.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The group started meeting virtually, an outlet for members to talk about any struggles or anxiety related to school. At the time, there was plenty fueling that stress.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She described the pandemic for teenagers as “pretty lonely.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was just really unmotivating and exhausting. It felt miserable at times,” she said.</p></div></div>
<p>“If you have really strong mental health and social emotional programing in schools that’s focusing on health promotion, that’s going to help create an environment that is more supportive of all children,” Beers said.</p>
<a>submitted a letter</a> to the Senate Finance Committee calling for support for children’s mental health. The group said the letter was in response to an
<a>earlier request</a> from lawmakers for input on ways to “develop bipartisan legislation to address barriers to mental health care” amid worsening trends during the pandemic.
<div><div><p>In his recent advisory, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy said it would take an “all-of-society” effort to address mental health, and urged action.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It would be a tragedy if we beat back one public health crisis only to allow another to grow in its place,” Murthy said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It wasn’t really a good year for any of us, you could say — all this stress and anxiety,” she said. “When covid hit, it just hit all of us pretty hard.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She remembers thinking she’d have just a couple of weeks off school. Then her aquatic club team practices were canceled. The in-person school year vanished.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It really left me in a state of isolation,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She found solace in her family and her little siblings. She also found comfort in the club meetings that provided a place to talk openly about mental health.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said she wishes “more people just validated the feelings of people who need to talk and who need help.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Counts said he believes young people should also be “directly engaged” with coming up with solutions for meeting youth mental health needs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The world of children is changing so rapidly, far more rapidly than I think adults can grapple with,” he said. “Only young people really have that kind of fundamental insight into what it is they need.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Having an understanding of mental health and trauma can also help people communicate what they are feeling, she said, and can help families and friends pay attention to signs and express concerns they may have about loved ones.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Briggs-King added: “My mama used to say, ‘You know better, you do better.’ ”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! Our sympathies go out to all of the motorists who were stranded on Interstate 95 in Virginia during the snowstorm, <a>including Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.)</a>. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Manchin voices support for the climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act</div></h4></div></div>
<a>statement</a> in which he asserted that BBB would “risk the reliability of our electric grid” and would spur the transition to clean energy “faster than technology or the markets allow.” 
<div><div><p>Jamal Raad, executive director of the environmental group Evergreen Action, told The Climate 202 that Manchin's comments on climate were “certainly encouraging.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Sinema isn't standing in the way</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before Manchin's comments, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said that Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.), another moderate who has raised concerns about some aspects of BBB, has not complained about the climate language to him.</p></div></div>
<a>interview with the Arizona Republic</a> in September. Sinema told the publication that “we know that a changing climate costs Arizonans. And right now, we have the opportunity to pass smart policies to address it.”
<div><div><h5><div>‘Hell and high water’</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Democrats on the call yesterday also cited recent climate disasters as proof of why passing the legislation cannot wait.</p></div></div>
<a>scientists said was fueled by extreme climate conditions</a>, while Schatz alluded to the rising sea levels that threaten Hawaii.
<div><div><p>“We're going to get this done, come hell or high water,” Schatz said. “Because right now we have both hell and high water.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A <a>recent Washington Post analysis</a> found that 1 in 3 Americans lived through a weather disaster last summer, including hurricanes, floods, heat waves and fires.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Durbin acknowledges delay</div></h5></div></div>
<p>Still, Senate Majority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) <a>said yesterday</a> that the Senate would pause work on BBB until Democrats have considered voting rights legislation, pushing a vote until the second half of January at the earliest.</p>
<div><p>“We are focused on voting rights, as we should be,” Durbin told reporters. “And I think the White House is joining us in that effort, and clearly we’ll return to Build Back Better as soon as that is done.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Raad of Evergreen Action said he felt “immense frustration” that BBB has been delayed repeatedly “and that it hasn't been moved along at the same speed as the bipartisan infrastructure bill.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That's a real concern,” he said, “because as anyone knows, the later you get into an election year, the harder it is to get anything done.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>More than 40 percent of Americans live in counties hit by climate disasters in 2021</h1></div>
<h2>As climate-fueled extreme weather intensified last year, more than 80 percent of Americans experienced a heat wave. The impacts of fires and severe storms also spread.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Sarah Kaplan</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Andrew Ba Tran</div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 1:05 p.m. EST|Updated today at 9:11 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes</a> in the suburbs of Denver. In between,
<b> </b>Americans suffered blistering heat waves, merciless droughts and monstrous hurricanes. People collapsed in farm fields and drowned in basement apartments; entire communities were obliterated by surging seas and encroaching flames.
<a>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, even before officials calculate the final toll of wildfires, drought and heat waves in the West.
<p>While the Federal Emergency Management Agency identified fewer climate-related disasters in individual counties last year, it declared eight of these emergencies statewide — the most since 1998 — encompassing 135 million people overall.</p>
<div><div><p>There is little doubt that the future will be worse. <a>Steadily rising temperatures</a> heighten the risk of wildfires, turbocharge rain storms, exacerbate flooding and intensify drought.</p></div></div>
<a>surged to near-record highs last year</a>. The Build Back Better bill, which contains the
<a> biggest clean energy investment in U.S. history</a>, stalled in Congress. The United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, produced pledges that put
<a>global average temperatures on track</a> to rise about 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century — a degree of warming that would transform once unthinkable disasters into near-annual occurrences.
<p>2022 begins with two crucial questions still unanswered: Will the United States invest in ways to make extreme weather less destructive? And will the country lead the world in curbing warming before it becomes impossible for humanity to adapt?</p>
<div><p>Cold, heat, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes: The year in weather disasters</p></div>
<div><div><p>These questions loom over Louisville, Colo., Mayor Ashley Stolzmann, who lost much of her town to wildfire on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When I lay awake the first night, not able to sleep from the fire, when I was evacuated from my house,” she said, “the first thing I thought of is: I need everyone to reduce their carbon emissions.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colorado residents still reeling from mass shooting now contend with Marshall Fire disaster</p></div>
<div><div><p>“To lose whole neighborhoods is just so very sad and devastating and unexpected,” Stolzmann said in an interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fires like that are not supposed to happen in densely populated suburbs. They’re not supposed to ignite in December, long after the first snows of the winter have usually fallen.</p></div></div>
<a>lasts more than a month longer</a> than it did four decades ago.
<div><p>“More people are living in more flammable landscapes,” said Chelsea Nagy, a research scientist at the University of Colorado at Boulder’s Earth Lab. “More people are going to be interfacing with disaster.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Post’s analysis of federal data shows that about 15 percent of Americans live in a county that experienced a declared fire disaster this year, a number that has been steadily increasing since 2018.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is a testament to the way climate change “has loaded the weather dice against us,” climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe said.</p></div></div>
<a>sickened fish and emptied wells</a>. In California, the Dixie Fire
<a>burned an area larger</a> than New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago and Dallas combined. More than 90 percent of the United States west of the Rockies was in drought last year.
<div><p>The Post also analyzed heat wave data from roughly 7,500 NOAA temperature monitors across the nation, finding that 80 percent of Americans live in a county that experienced at least one day of abnormally high temperatures last year.</p></div>
<a>fluctuations in the polar vortex</a>, allowing tongues of cold air to lash out into lower latitudes. Other studies indicate that
<a>warmer winter temperatures</a> provided fuel for the late-season thunderstorms that gave rise to December’s twisters.
<div><div><p>“It’s such an outlier, we don’t have anything to compare it to. How do you put statistics on that?” Wehner said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet people can change even faster than the climate, Wehner said, giving the United States a chance to adapt.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We need to build safety nets, a sense of belonging, a sense of shared space to deal with this,” she said. “It’s not only technical solutions.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, there are limits on people’s capacity to adapt, Wehner said, since disasters will become exponentially worse for every incremental increase in temperature.</p></div></div>
