<h1>Nissan's new camping vans are too cool for the USA</h1>
<h2>Mountain Base and Myroom are two takes on the same idea</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Test drive: 2022 Nissan Frontier</a></h4> <p>The 2022 Nissan Frontier combines new styling and tech with a proven platform and leaps near the front of the midsize class, says Fox News Autos Editor Gary Gastelu</p></div></div>
<p><a>Nissan</a> is living its best <a>#vanlife</a> … in Japan.</p>
<div> <div><p> The Nissan Mountain Base is an off-road work station. (Nissan)</p></div></div>
<p>The automaker has revealed two camping van concepts it will be debuting at January's Tokyo Auto Salon show.</p>
<div> <div><p> The Nissan Myroom's conventional exterior hides a hotel room inside. (Nissan)</p></div></div>
<p>The Mountain Base and Myroom are based on the NV350 Caravan minivan that's not sold in the U.S.</p>
<div> <div><p> The Nissan Mountain Base has a built-in table and work bench. (Nissan)</p></div></div>
<div> <div><p> The Nissan Myroom is equipped with a bed, sofa, shelves and drawers. (Nissan)</p></div></div>
<p>The Myroom is more of a chic hotel on wheels, with a light wood-trimmed interior, couch, mattress, storage under the floor, drawers and, oddly, a magazine rack-style bookshelf.</p>

<h1>Truckers frustrated by looming Biden vaccine mandate for cross-border Canada shipments</h1>
<h2>Canada and US impose vaccine requirements for cross-border travel</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>American truck drivers who transport goods into Canada are frustrated by looming vaccine requirements, and some remain concerned the mandates could hinder the <a>supply chain crisis</a>. </p>
<p>Republicans on the Hill remain concerned that President Biden’s vaccine mandates could have negative impacts on the trucking industry and the supply chain crisis. </p>
<div> <div><p> Sen. Steve Daines speaks during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington on Feb. 24, 2021. (Michael Reynolds/Pool via AP)</p></div></div>
<p>OSHA VACCINE, TEST RULES WILL PROTECT WORKERS, HELP ECONOMY: LABOR SECRETARY MARTY WALSH</p>
<p>In a Wednesday roundtable with northern-border state truck drivers, Montana Republican Sen. Steve Daines said he thinks "these overreaching vaccine mandates will shutter Montana businesses and force Montanans out of work." </p>
<p>"It’s going to hurt our Montana trucking businesses and make this inflation and supply chain crisis even worse," he added. </p>
<p>Hanson said he was lucky to be able to report that 99% of his drivers had gotten the shots in their arms.</p>
<p>Another trucking company that ships produce out of California up to Canada said all of its drivers had gotten vaccinated as well.</p>
<p>"They weren’t real happy about it, but they said they still have to feed their families," the official said. </p>
<p>"Some drivers have done it under protest," Hanson said during the roundtable, adding that "the biggest driver behind that protest is because it’s a mandate."</p>
<p>Daines said his frustration is rooted in the fact that migrants entering the country are not subject to the same vaccine requirements. </p>
<p><a>SUPREME COURT TO HEAR ORAL ARGUMENTS ON CHALLENGES TO BIDEN VACCINE MANDATES</a></p>

<p>Other industry officials present at the roundtable expressed frustration with what they argued were arbitrary guidelines, asking why the line was drawn at businesses with 100 employees or more. </p>
<p>Republicans have pushed back on the vaccine mandates issued under the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), arguing mass layoffs or resignations could further hinder supply chain issues and inflation.</p>
<p>But Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said last month that the majority of truckers will not actually be affected by the sweeping mandate because, for the most part, they work solo in the cab of their truck. </p>
<p>The <a>OSHA guidelines</a> have an exemption for workers "who do not report to a workplace where other individuals such as co-workers or customers are present."</p>
<p>Chris Spear, president and CEO of the American Trucking Associations, <a>championed</a> this carveout last month and called it "an enormous victory for our association and industry."</p>
<div> <div><p> People arrive at City Hall in protest of COVID-19 vaccine mandate in New York City Oct. 25, 2021. (REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz)</p></div></div>
<p>Spear said the exemption would give the trucking industry "the relief it needs to keep critical goods moving, including food, fuel, medicine and the vaccine itself."</p>
<p>While Spear championed the carveout, he has helped lead a suit currently in the Supreme Court challenging the sweeping vaccine mandates. </p>
<p>But Daines argued the exemption only shows that the regulation is illogical to begin with. </p>
<p>"Creating carveouts for some companies and not others shows how arbitrary and senseless this mandate really is," he told Fox News. "I am doing all I can to reverse this mandate and look forward to the Supreme Court taking this issue up."</p>

<h1>Personal loan interest rates creep up, but 5-year rates still lower than this time last year</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>The latest trends in interest rates for personal loans from the Credible marketplace, updated weekly. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>Borrowers with good credit seeking <a><u>personal loans</u></a> during the past seven days prequalified for rates that were higher for 3-year fixed-rate loans and 5-year fixed-rate loans compared to the previous seven days.</p>
<p>For borrowers with credit scores of 720 or higher who used the Credible marketplace to select a lender between Dec. 20 and Dec. 26:</p>
<li>Rates on 3-year fixed-rate loans averaged 11.77%, up from 11.30% the seven days before and up from 11.29% a year ago.</li>
<li>Rates on 5-year fixed-rate loans averaged 14.78%, up from 14.38% the previous seven days and down from 15.14% a year ago.</li>
<a><u>consolidate and pay off credit card debt</u> </a>and other loans. They can also be used to cover unexpected expenses, like
<a><u>medical bills</u></a>, take care of a major purchase, or
<a><u>fund home improvement projects</u></a>.
<p>Whether a personal loan is right for you often depends on multiple factors, including what rate you can qualify for. Comparing multiple lenders and their rates could help ensure you get the best possible personal loan for your needs. </p>
<p>It's always a good idea to <a><u>comparison shop on sites like Credible</u></a> to understand how much you qualify for and choose the best option for you.</p>
<p>Here are the latest trends in personal loan interest rates from the Credible marketplace, updated weekly. </p>
<h2>Personal loan weekly rates trends</h2>
<p>The chart above shows average prequalified rates for borrowers with credit scores of 720 or higher who used the Credible marketplace to select a lender. </p>
<p>For the month of November 2021:</p>
<ul><li>Rates on 3-year personal loans averaged 11.32%, down from 11.33% in October.</li><li>Rates on 5-year personal loans averaged 14.25%, up from 13.85% in October.</li></ul>
<a><u>you can use an online tool like Credible</u></a> to compare options from different private lenders. Checking your rates won't affect your credit score.
<p>In November, the average prequalified rate selected by borrowers was: </p>
<ul><li>8.92% for borrowers with credit scores of 780 or above choosing a 3-year loan</li><li>29.04% for borrowers with credit scores below 600 choosing a 5-year loan</li></ul>
<p>All Credible marketplace lenders offer fixed-rate loans at competitive rates. Because lenders use different methods to evaluate borrowers, it’s a good idea to request personal loan rates from multiple lenders so you can compare your options. </p>
<h2>Current personal loan rates by credit score</h2>
<p>Depending on factors such as your credit score, which type of personal loan you’re seeking, and the loan repayment term, the interest rate can differ. </p>
<p>As shown in the chart above, a good credit score can mean a lower interest rate, and rates tend to be higher on loans with fixed interest rates and longer repayment terms. </p>
<h2>How to get a lower interest rate</h2>
<p>Many factors influence the interest rate a lender might offer you on a personal loan. But you can take some steps to boost your chances of getting a lower interest rate. Here are some tactics to try.</p>
<p>Generally, people with higher credit scores qualify for lower interest rates. Steps that can help you <a><u>improve your credit score</u></a> over time include:</p>
<li>Pay bills on time. Payment history is the most important factor in your credit score. Pay all your bills on time for the amount due.</li>
<li>Check your credit report. Look at your credit report to ensure there are no errors on it. If you find errors, dispute them with the credit bureau.</li>
<li>Lower your credit utilization ratio. Paying down credit card debt can improve this important credit-scoring factor.</li>
<li>Avoid opening new credit accounts. Only apply for and open credit accounts you actually need. Too many hard inquiries on your credit report in a short amount of time could lower your credit score.</li>
<h3>Choose a shorter loan term</h3>
<p><a><u>Personal loan repayment terms</u></a> can vary from one to several years. Generally, shorter terms come with lower interest rates, since the lender’s money is at risk for a shorter period of time.</p>
<a><u>finding a cosigner</u></a> with good credit could help you secure a lower interest rate.
<p>Just remember, if you default on the loan, your cosigner will be on the hook to repay it. And cosigning for a loan could also affect their credit score.</p>
<h3>Compare rates from different lenders</h3>
<p>But don’t worry: Comparing rates and terms doesn’t have to be a time-consuming process.</p>
<p>Credible makes it easy. Just enter how much you want to borrow and you’ll be able to <a><u>compare multiple lenders</u></a> to choose the one that makes the most sense for you.</p>
<a><u>4,500 positive Trustpilot reviews</u></a>
<u> </u> and a TrustScore of 4.7/5.

<h1>Oregon caller to Biden defends ‘Let’s go, Brandon’ remark, claims he’s now getting threats: report</h1>
<h2>Jared Schmeck claims he was joking and meant no disrespect -- though he thinks Biden 'can be doing a better job,' a report says</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>A caller from Oregon who tagged on "Let’s go, Brandon" when ending his <a>Christmas Eve</a> phone chat with <a>President Biden</a> last week now says he’s being "attacked" for what he claims was a "joke."</p>
<p>"And now I am being attacked for utilizing my freedom of speech," Jared Schmeck, 35, a former Medford <a>police officer</a>, told The Oregonian newspaper Saturday.</p>
<p>Schmeck said he has been receiving vague but threatening phone calls after his call to Biden on Friday was live-streamed and reported in the media.</p>
<blockquote><p>"I am being attacked for utilizing my freedom of speech."</p> — Jared Schmeck, caller to President Biden</blockquote>
<p>"I understand there is a vulgar meaning to ‘Let’s go, Brandon,’ but I’m not that simple-minded, no matter how I feel about him," Schmeck told the news outlet. </p>
<p><a>DAD TELLS BIDEN, ‘LET’S GO, BRANDON' DURING CHRISTMAS EVE CALL – AND BIDEN RESPONDS</a></p>
<p>The livestreamed call drew media attention in part because Biden responded, "’Let’s go, Brandon,’ I agree," even though the phrase has been used by the president’s critics to mock him.</p>
<p>But Schmeck, a father of four, claimed Saturday he had no ill feelings toward the president, even though he believes Biden "can be doing a better job."</p>
<p>Schmeck added he "stood 100% behind what I did and what I said," according to the paper.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, I have nothing against Mr. Biden," Schmeck said in the same interview with The Oregonian, "but I am frustrated because I think he can be doing a better job. I mean no disrespect to him."</p>
<blockquote><p>"At the end of the day, I have nothing against Mr. Biden, but I am frustrated because I think he can be doing a better job."</p> — Jared Schmeck, caller to President Biden</blockquote>
<p>Despite his criticism of Biden, Schmeck told the newspaper he did not consider himself a "Trumper," but instead a "free-thinking American and follower of Jesus Christ."</p>
<p>Schmeck said he and his family were following their tradition Friday of calling in to the NORAD Santa Tracker on Christmas Eve, and didn’t know the call would be livestreamed.</p>
<p>A voice on the other end said first lady Jill Biden would be accepting calls but Schmeck said he assumed it would be a recording of the first lady, not a live phone call, according to The Oregonian.</p>
<p>Then, when the president and first lady started speaking with the family, Biden was interested to learn that one of Schmeck’s sons was named Hunter, the same name as the president’s son.</p>
<p>The Bidens and the Schmecks then chatted about items that the Schmeck children hoped to receive for Christmas, with Schmeck adding he himself hoped for "a quiet night."</p>
<p>"Lots of luck, dad," the president responded, sparking laughter among the group.</p>
<p>As the call ended, Jill Biden wished the Oregon family a Merry Christmas and Jared Schmeck responded: "I hope you guys have a wonderful Christmas as well. Merry Christmas and Let’s go, Brandon!"</p>
<p>Soon afterward, Schmeck’s wife posted an Instagram message, according to The Oregonian.</p>
<p>"My husband may or may not have just told joe and jill Biden ‘let’s go Brandon’ on the phone,’" the message said, with two crying emojis added. </p>
<p>In addition, the newspaper reported, Schmeck also posted a video of their conversation with the Bidens on his YouTube channel, with the caption, "We talked to President Joe Biden on Christmas Eve! #letsgobrandon"</p>
<p>Whether Schmeck has contacted law enforcement about his claims of threatening calls remained unclear.</p>
<p><a>CLCIK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP</a></p>
<p>The Oregon man said he resigned from the Medford police force in 2018 but declined to discuss why, the newspaper reported. He now works for an electric company, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>"Let’s go, Brandon" started as an errant report by an NBC Sports reporter about a crowd’s chant at a NASCAR race won by driver Brandon Brown. The crowd was actually saying "F--- Joe Biden."</p>
<p>Brown recently <a>told Sports Business Journal</a> that he has struggled to acquire corporate endorsement deals because of the phrase. </p>
<p>Brown also wrote <a>an op-ed in Newsweek last week</a>, claiming he preferred to stay focused on auto racing, not politics.</p>
