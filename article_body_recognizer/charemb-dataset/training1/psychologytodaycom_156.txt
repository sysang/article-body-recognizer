<h1> Gifted Adult Therapy: The Wounds of Being 'Too Intense' </h1>
<h2> Have you been told you are too much, too sensitive, or too serious? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Therapy? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Are you an <a>emotionally intense</a> and <a>highly sensitive person</a>?</li>
<li>Are you a fast learner?</li>
<li>Do you often feel out-of-place in the world?</li>
<li>Do you get excited easily, and your creative inspirations keep you up at night?</li>
<li>Do you 'absorb' other people's feelings and energies to the point where crowds and social settings are overwhelming for you?</li>
<li>Do you set extremely high standards for yourself or are deemed as a <a>perfectionist</a> by those around you? Do you challenge authority?</li>
<li>Do you have a strong autonomous drive and a need to work independently?</li>
<li>Do you get frustrated when you witness injustice or corruption in the world and struggle to tolerate other people's ignorance or apathy?</li>
<li>Do you downplay your achievements and abilities to appear 'normal' so others won't attack you?</li>
<p>If you resonate with some of the above questions, then you may be a gifted person without knowing it. Therapy for gifted adults is a relatively unknown specialty, often unrecognised by mental health professionals trained in traditional psychology.</p>

<p>From a young age, being extraordinarily intense might have brought you many invisible woundings. You might have been labelled as 'gifted', but that does not mean you had the right understanding and support to help you find your way in life.</p>
<a>parentified'</a>— with the roles between parents and child reversed.
<p>Even when no one tried to harm you, your natural competence and intuitiveness may have caused you to take it upon yourself to ease the distress and solve problems for those around you.</p>
<p>Your gifted <a>trauma</a> does not just disappear as you become an adult. If it remains unhealed and unprocessed, it may show up in the following self-sabotaging emotional and behavioural issues:</p>
<a>career</a> opportunity, avoid
<a>intimacy</a>, or become extremely socially
<a>Conformity</a>. With the speed of your operation, intellectual depth, and the complexity of your inner life, it is difficult for you to walk the conventional life path dictated by mainstream society. However, you may be forced to take up stereotypical
<a>gender</a> roles or make career choices that are not true to your nature. If due to social adaptations, you have silenced your true self, you may experience an intense
<a>mid-life</a> or quarter-life crisis, or be faced with depression or a critical illness later in your life.

<h1> Could You Have High-Functioning BPD? </h1>
<h2> The psychology of high-functioning borderline personality disorder. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Nate Neelson/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Although in recent years, public awareness of borderline personality disorder (BPD) has increased, many people afflicted with this painful, invisible diagnosis remain misunderstood and misjudged. </p>
<p>Most information on BPD focuses on its classic symptoms but having high-functioning or <a>"quiet" BPD</a> could mean your suffering remains unseen and missed by most. </p>
<a>leadership</a> and advice. You may be popular and friendly amongst friends, and appear energetic and
<a>optimistic</a>. Behind the screen, however, you suffer from intense
<a>shame</a>, and may be extremely critical of yourself.
<a>feel empty on the inside.</a>
<a>subconscious</a> belief that you are not worthy of help, or even make you feel guilty or ashamed for having reached out.
<p>The Psychology Behind High-Functioning BPD</p>
<a>trauma</a>—an overwhelmingly painful experience in your life. This trauma may not be visible but comes in the form of chronic
<a>emotional abuse</a> or neglect. Due to having dysfunctional or immature parents or siblings, you might have been burdened with too much too soon. There was an early rupture, separation, or abandonment, and your wound remains hidden or unhealed.
<p>Emotional and Intimacy Anorexia </p>
<a>empathic</a>. From a young age, you were always the one who loved too much, gave too much, and trusted too much. Repeatedly, however, the depth of your feeling was not reciprocated. Having been hurt so many times, you now opt to restrain your passion.
<p>Underneath emotional anorexia might also be the <a>fear</a> that you are "too much" for others, so you would rather be silent and edit yourself than risk overwhelming others with your fire. </p>
<p>As a child, there was little you could do about your circumstances. Even if your family were abusive to you or your siblings bullied you, you had no escape. The only way to not feel pain was to <a>dissociate</a>.</p>
<p>The predicament of someone with high-functioning BPD can be summed up in a poem by British poet Stevie Smith called "Not Waving but Drowning": </p>
<p>Nobody heard him, the dead man, </p>
<p>But still he lay moaning:</p>
<p>I was much further out than you thought </p>
<p>And not waving but drowning.</p>
<p>As it is poignantly put by this poem, you may be drowning in sorrow, but when others see your arm thrashing above water, they think you are "just waving." </p>
<a>social anxiety</a>, uncontrollable rage at yourself or others, or chronic
<a>depression</a>. These symptoms erupt when you are on your own or when you put your guard down. They are, in essence, what your inner child is going through.
<p>The first step to healing is learning to trust yourself. You must start believing that unlike the helpless child you once were, you are now capable of much more. You now have the ability to seek resources, protect, and support yourself. </p>
<p>See if you can slow down, soften your heart, and hear from the part of you that you have shoved into the shadow. At first, facing your true vulnerability may be a daunting idea, but this is an essential first step to integration. </p>
<p>Healing from high-functioning BPD, while not easy, is entirely possible. </p>

<h1> Alexithymia: Do You Know What You Feel? </h1>
<h2> Healing from a disconnection with your emotions. </h2>
<a>stress</a>, joy, and love. When something good happens to us, we feel lightness and joy in our hearts. When we experience losses and defeats, we have a sinking feeling at the bottom of our stomachs.
<p>But imagine not being able to do that. What if you could never identify if you are sad or happy? What if you are indeed grieving or depressed but don’t even know it yourself? Can you imagine how confusing that is?</p>
<p>That is the world that a person with alexithymia dwells in.</p>
<a>empathic</a> person, but because of this particular difficulty, others may misunderstand you as being someone cold, aloof and arrogant. As a result, you are more likely than most to suffer from
<a>social isolation</a> and loneliness.
<p>If you struggle with alexithymia, the following may represent some of your day-to-day challenges:</p>
<li>You have no idea what you are feeling inside. When others ask how you are, you draw a blank. Even in a therapist’s office, you cannot get in touch with what is going on inside.</li>
<li>Most of the time, you can only tell if you are feeling "good" or "bad," "happy" or "unhappy," and not much nuance beyond that.</li>
<li>You are disconnected from your own needs and desires. Because you are confused yourself, others around you also do not know what you want, leading to relationship and interpersonal frustrations.</li>
<a>self-harm</a> behaviours but are disconnected from the reasons behind them.
<li>You have limited <a>imagination</a> and are not able to enjoy anything that has to do with the <a>fantasy</a> world.</li>
<li>You are not able to communicate any emotion even to family and close friends, but you may suddenly show disruptive behaviour like bouts of <a>anger</a>.</li>
<li>Not knowing why, you have lost all drive and <a>motivation</a>. You <a>procrastinate</a> at work and do not find much joy in any leisure activities. Only getting through the day becomes a difficult chore.</li>
<li>You do not have a solid sense of self, experience <a>identity</a> confusion and don’t know what you want for the future.</li>
<li>Sometimes you feel like you are a distant observer of your own life. Deep down, however, you are anxious that you are just wasting your life away.</li>
<li>You do not like feeling out of control, especially when it comes to relationships. Therefore, even you crave companionship and kinships, and you avoid close relationships. </li>
<p>It’s important to note that having alexithymia does not mean you are completely apathetic. You may still feel things inside, but you struggle to feel connected to your feelings, or you are not able to express them to others.</p>
<p>The Diagnosis of Alexithymia</p>
<a>psychiatry</a> by Peter E. Sifneos, a psychiatrist and professor at Harvard Medical School in 1976. Yet even today, there is a lack of information on the underlying causes and recommended therapies.
<p>In the alexithymia literature, “secondary alexithymia” is defined as alexithymia that is a state reaction to physical illness (Freyberger, 1977) or other major or extraordinary life change.</p>
<p>Research has found links between alexithymia with other disorders including:</p>
<li>Substance Use Disorder</li>
<li>Post-<a>traumatic</a> Stress Disorder</li>
<li>Psychosomatic Disorders</li>
<li><a>Obsessive-Compulsive</a> Disorder</li>
<p>Alexithymia and <a>Autism</a></p>
<p>An alexithymic person’s failure to recognize the intense feelings (such as confusion or danger) in others and their lack of expression of emotions means that alexithymia is often misinterpreted as autism.</p>
<p>Alexithymia and <a>Depression</a></p>
<p>Alexithymia and Neurological Disease</p>
<p>Patients with neurological diseases and conditions such as <a>traumatic brain injury</a>, stroke, dystonia, Huntington’s disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, and epilepsy are more likely to exhibit alexithymia.</p>
<p>Alexithymia and Early <a>Childhood</a> Emotional Trauma</p>
<p>Growing up in such an environment, your feelings were never validated. It is only natural that you eventually learn to disown or bury them.</p>
<p>Healing from Alexithymia</p>
<a>therapy</a> can help you build self-awareness alongside
<a>assertiveness</a> you gain can then be brought to other aspects of your life, allowing you to build new relationships and
<a>intimacy</a>, to love and feel loved, and feel more fully alive in the world.

<h3>The Psychological Consequences of Having a BPD Parent</h3>
<p>Living with a parent with BPD, you may be constantly blamed for things you have not done, with sudden rage and even violent outbursts.</p>
<a>shame</a> is actually how they feel. However, since they do not have the maturity to contain and integrate their psyche in a healthy way, they have to "dump" these feelings onto and into you. It started as their unjustified blame and
<a>guilt</a>-tripping, but you have now internalized their abuse of you into your psyche, and it becomes a toxic shame that you carry with you.
<p>Because of their severe <a>fear</a> of abandonment, a parent with BPD is threatened when you need to grow and express your individuality. </p>
<p>As you are trying to separate from them, even as benign as leaving home for a few days to be with your friends, your parent may throw a tantrum, threaten to hurt themselves, or suddenly become <a>depressed</a> and unable to be on their own.</p>

<a>empty and numb</a> and disconnected from your body and soul. This lack of ability to be in touch with yourself will stop you from living a full and fulfilling life, as well as building authentic relationships.
<p>If you have spent most of your life catering to your parent’s needs at the expense of your <a>happiness</a>, it is time you reclaim your life for yourself. </p>
<p>You did not cause their dysfunctions, and you could not have controlled them. You did the best you could to survive. </p>

<h1> Why Intelligence Is Such a Powerful Turn-On for Some People </h1>
<h2> It does not make you arrogant, unrealistic, or weird. </h2>
<li>For the sapiosexual, intelligence itself is the genuine "switch." Their ideal life partner would be an intellectual equal.</li>
<li>This is a preference or orientation; it is not up to an individual who they are attracted to. </li>
<li>Sapiosexuals deserve love and happiness as much as anyone else, though it may be somewhat harder to find.</li>

<a>romantic relationships</a>. From an evolutionary perspective, being in a relationship with an intelligent person has certain benefits, such as potentially higher socioeconomic status or heritable advantages for your offsprings. But for the sapiosexual,
<a>intelligence</a> itself is the genuine ‘switch.' It is the key on its own, without any added benefits.
<h3>How does it feel when a sapiosexual meets ‘their people’? </h3>
<a>attraction</a> to your intellectual equal can even be intuitive and bypass your conscious awareness. This is especially true if you had not yet

<p>What is 'Demisexuality'?</p>
<a>gender</a> or sexual orientation.
<a>romantic relationships</a>; it is a fundamental orientation that requires you to have an emotional bond before you feel sexually drawn to a person. An emotional bond does not guarantee sexual
<a>attraction</a>, but for demisexuals, it is a prerequisite.
<h3>Signs You May Be Demisexual</h3>
<p>It is not necessary to put a label on everything but knowing where you are on the <a>sexuality</a> spectrum will help you become comfortable with who you are. </p>
<p>Here are a few signs which might strike a chord if you are demisexual.</p>
<p>Physical appearances do not beguile you.</p>
<a>internet dating</a> sites only offer images and a short personal bio of the other person for an initial connection. As a demisexual, you need to feel a lot more than that to go on a date.
<p>Your approach to dating is misunderstood and rejected. </p>
<p>Intimacy to you does not revolve around sex.</p>
<h3>What Demisexuality is Not</h3>
<p>A demisexual is not a prude; they do not <a>fear</a> sex or have a low sex drive. They are not abstaining from sexual intimacy because of religious or moral beliefs.</p>
<a>authenticity</a> on both sides. As you take the time to know someone, the other person may lose interest in the relationship. Your natural responses can be misinterpreted as a rejection or lack of interest.

<h1> Do You Drown, or Do You Run Away? </h1>
<h2> Resilience is when you neither drown in nor avoid emotions. </h2>
<li>The Artist's Way and the Jester's Way are two opposite metaphorical ways of dealing with emotions.</li>
<li>As a jester, you may run away from your emotions; as an artist, you may drown in them. </li>
<li> Resilience is found in a middle ground where you neither get overwhelmed by emotions nor avoid them altogether.</li>
<p>Typically, when it comes to the landscape of our emotions, we find two ways of traveling that lie on two opposite ends of a spectrum.</p>
<p>Metaphorically, one is the "Artist’s Way." The other one is the "Jester’s Way."</p>
<p>People who adopt the Jester’s Way usually also embody the archetype of a blissful child.</p>
<a>optimistic</a>. Your vitality livens up any room you enter. You do not take yourself too seriously and live in the present moment. People learn how to thoroughly enjoy the wonders of life by being with you.
<p>Logic is your friend, and you are an avid student of life. You are rational and even-tempered when it comes to solving life’s problems. You have the gifts of spontaneity, playfulness, joy, and <a>productivity</a>.</p>
<a>wisdom</a>. As a result, you may find yourself inept in dealing with the fundamentals of life—you become overwhelmed with the landscape of sorrow when a crisis hits.
<a>rationalize</a> or intellectualize them away. Instead, you endure the more painful aspect of life with quiet strength.
<a>empathic</a>, and compassionate friend. At your best, you are both vulnerable and strong.
<a>self-hatred</a>. You ruminate in the past, feel hopeless about the future, break down again and again, and fatigue your system so much that life ceases to feel meaningful.
<h3>Finding an emotional balance</h3>
<p>Of course, none of us only do one thing, but we are all born with an innate temperament that swings us towards one direction, often reinforced by our upbringing and what our circumstances have forced us to do.</p>
<a>caregiver</a> to mirror your emotions and to help you regulate, you became convinced of your eternal
<a>loneliness</a>. As a result, you turned inward and created a vivid imaginary world to cope.
<a>psychotherapy</a> wisdom" says, distraction can be functional. Instead of ruminating, it is entirely OK to distract yourself with pleasurable activities or to "sleep things off" sometimes.
<a>fear</a> are not "negative" but rather are valuable messengers from the depth of your soul. It is entirely safe to let them in. You do not have to numb yourself with substances, rush from one activity to another activity, or rely on hope and
<p>To spiritually and emotionally mature is to integrate opposite sides of your psyche.</p>
<p>When life hits you with an unwanted surprise, you can maintain balance and move forward by learning to find that middle ground where you are not drowning, not avoiding, not numbing.</p>
<p>This is the definition of true resilience.</p>

<h1> Attachment Styles and Borderline Personality Disorder </h1>
<h2> How different attachment styles influence borderline personality disorder. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Attachment? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>There are different presentations of borderline personality disorder, including classic BPD, quiet BPD, and high-functioning BPD.</li>
<li>Which type someone displays may depend on their attachment styles, adopted from childhood. </li>
<li>People who are high on the anxiety dimension are more likely to have a negative view of themselves and have dependency issues.</li>
<li>Individuals high on the avoidance dimension have developed negative views of others and are mistrusting.</li>
<a>personality disorder</a> with a single brushstroke. Even though people may carry the same diagnostic label, their unique life experiences and innate temperaments will create different coping styles and thus symptom profiles.
<p>In this article, we will review how different attachment styles may affect your push-pull behaviors and explain various BPD symptoms.</p>
<h3>Attachment Styles and Adaptation Strategies</h3>
<p>Our parents' responses to our attachment-seeking behaviors shape how we see the world later in life.</p>
<a>John Bowlby</a> (1907-1990), who started by observing how infants react to being separated from their parents. Psychologists found that without conscious intervention, we tend to stick with our
<a>childhood</a> attachment styles. To put it simply, if we have an
<a>anxious</a> attachment pattern, we might become attached and clingy; if we have an avoidant attachment pattern, we tend to cut off to protect ourselves.
<h3>What Are the Main Attachment Styles?</h3>
<p>There are four main attachment styles. They can be understood via where they fall on two dimensions: anxiety and avoidance (Brennan, Clark, Shaver,1998).</p>
<p>2. Anxious-preoccupied (anxious) attachment</p>
<a>intimacy</a> and approval, yet
<a>fear</a> rejection and abandonment.
<a>anger</a>, and a desperate search for contact, validation, and connection.
<p>You tend to struggle more with maladaptive dependency. You may sacrifice your own needs for that of others, and find it difficult to trust your ability to endure or enjoy solitude. </p>

<p>3. Dismissive-avoidant (avoidant) attachment</p>
<p>Individuals high on the avoidance dimension have developed negative views of others. If you are avoidantly attached, you learned through experience that people could not be counted on, and you have to rely only on yourself.</p>
<p>You tend to minimize or downplay painful feelings. You may not remember much of your childhood and feel uncomfortable speaking about it. Normalizing, intellectualizing, and rationalizing painful events are your core coping mechanisms.</p>

<a>memory</a> loss, or randomly "losing time." You may experience depersonalization—feeling disconnected with your own body—or derealisation, a sudden sense of disconnection with the world, like you are "floating above it."

<h1> The Struggles of Quiet BPD </h1>
<h2> Over-control may help explain Quiet Borderline Personality Disorder. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Personality? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Quiet BPD is an internalized disorder, and looks different from classic BPD.</li>
<li>The Undercontrol/Overcontrol Theory can explain the differences between classic BPD and quiet BPD.</li>
<li>People who are overcontrolled can come across as rigid, cold, and hard to engage, even when they are deeply sensitive on the inside. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: fizkes/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>"Quiet BPD" (<a>Borderline Personality Disorder</a>) is a subtype of BPD that has not been officially included in the <a>DSM</a>. </p>
<a>fear</a> of abandonment, toxic
<a>shame</a> and severe anxiety of conflicts. Because of how much shame you feel and how much you hide your pain, those around you and even mental health professionals might miss the fact that you are suffering. Quiet BPD often also overlaps with '
<a>high-functioning BPD</a>', where a part of the self is 'split off' to maintain a facade of hyper-competence and independence.
<h3>Signs and Symptoms of Quiet BPD</h3>
<li>You look calm on the outside even when you are suffering from extreme pain on the inside.</li>
<li>You have extreme mood swings that seem to come from nowhere.</li>
<li>You hide your <a>anger</a>, sometimes to the point you don't know it when you are angry.</li>
<li>You tend to blame yourself for things even when they are not your fault. </li>
<li>When relationships end or conflicts arise, you immediately assume you did something wrong. </li>
<li>You hold up an image that appears 'normal', calm and successful.</li>
<li>You feel that there is something defective about you.</li>
<li>You mentally retreat and can become dissociated when <a>stressed</a>.</li>
<li>Most of the time, you feel empty and numb.</li>
<li>When someone upsets you, instead of seeking clarification or confronting them, you immediately withdraw and may end the relationship without speaking to the person. </li>
<li>You feel that you are a burden on others.</li>
<li>One moment, you idealize other people, but soon you lose trust in them. Generally, you don't feel safe in the world. </li>
<h3>Undercontrol vs. Overcontrol</h3>
<a>personality disorders</a> such as
<a>Antisocial Personality Disorder</a> or
<a>Narcissistic Personality Disorder</a>, while the overcontrolled character is linked to Cluster-C personality disorders such as
<a>Avoidant Personality Disorder</a>,
<a>Dependent Personality Disorder</a>, or
<a>Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder</a>.
<p>According to Dr. Lynch, people who are over-controlled have the following four core deficits:</p>
<li>Lack of Receptivity and <a>Openness</a>: You tend to be risk-averse and hyper-vigilant. You may avoid new and novel experiences and can be dismissive of other people's input and feedback. </li>
<li>Lack of Social Connectedness and <a>Intimacy</a>: You may appear distant and aloof and keep people at arm's length. You may also compare yourself with others often and feel <a>envious</a> and bitter. </li>
<a>unconscious</a> and affect us without us even realizing it. Because this is an innate predisposition, you cannot will yourself, think yourself, or use more
<a>willpower</a> to control or talk your way out of it.
<h3>Overcontrol and Attachment Styles</h3>
<h3>Treatments for Overcontrol </h3>
<a>psychotherapy</a> methods, are designed to help you raise self-awareness, lower stress, and increase distress tolerance. However, people who suffer from difficulties related to overcontrol, such as chronic
<a>depression</a>, anorexia, or
<a>obsessive-compulsive</a> personality disorder, usually do not benefit from these methods.

<li>People who have Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) are preoccupied with orderliness, perfectionism, and control.</li>
<li>It usually takes people with OCPD a long time to seek help, even if they suffer deeply.</li>

<a>perfectionism</a>, and the need to be so exact and meticulous about every inconsequential matter.
<a>personality disorder</a> (OCPD).
<a>Psychiatric</a> Association (APA, 2000) defines OCPD as "pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and mental and interpersonal control, at the expense of flexibility,
<a>openness</a>, and efficiency." Underneath OCPD is usually a fear of experiencing painful feelings and the helplessness of not being able to control anything. However much they suffer, however, someone with OCPD may not see the need to change.
<p>OCPD and OCD are not the same, even they sometimes overlap. Symptoms that overlap may include <a>paranoia</a>, excessive caution, inability to compromise on set rules or routines, perfectionism and the inability to trust others. </p>
