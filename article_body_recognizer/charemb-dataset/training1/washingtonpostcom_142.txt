<p>“Preventing climate-induced security risks, that’s a Nobel Prize-winning enterprise,” said Wolfgang Ischinger, the chairman of the Munich Security Conference, Europe’s main conclave for security-related discussions.</p>
<p>Nugee has had to battle skepticism inside the military, as opponents say that the focus on climate detracts from their core business.</p>
<p>Doubters can be dismissive of anything that, in their view, could make it more difficult to deploy speedily and effectively, Nugee said.</p>
<p>“There’s a very strong military lobby which turns around and says we shouldn’t be doing this, because we have a really clear purpose: that we will do whatever it takes to defend our nation,” he said.</p>
<p>About two years ago, Nugee went to the defense secretary and to the British equivalent of the head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is a friend.</p>
<p>Nugee said he hoped his climate efforts would be his legacy.</p>
<p>“It was what I was passionate about, in an environment where nobody was talking about it, and in an environment where actually, I could make a difference,” he said.</p>

<div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Juliet Eilperin</div></div></span></div></span></div><div><span><div><span><div><div>Photos and video by Salwan Georges</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Dec. 30, 2021</div></div>
<p>This mammoth tree plays an outsize role in the Tongass National Forest, which holds the equivalent of 9.9 billion tons of CO2 — nearly twice what the United States emits from burning fossil fuels each year.</p>
<p>Walking around its 15-foot-wide base, Marina Anderson, the Organized Village of Kasaan’s tribal administrator, pointed out a plethora of plants her ancestors, the Haida and Tlingit peoples, have used over the centuries.</p>
<p>The spruce’s fortunes as ever, are bound in the politics of timber and climate change thousands of miles away in Washington D.C. Its blue death mark might as well be a question mark: Is this tree worth more to us alive? Or dead?</p>
<p>Anderson knows what her answer is.</p>
<h3><b>A seed takes root</b></h3>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 282 parts per million.</p>
<p>When the United States bought Alaska from Russia on Oct. 18, 1867 — over the objections of the Tlingit — it had more to do with asserting U.S. influence in the Pacific than commandeering the riches of its forests.</p>
<p>Soon enough, officials such as J.W. White, a captain in the U.S. Revenue-Marine Service, began to eye Alaska’s trees, writing in 1876, “When the forests of Oregon and Washington are gone, Alaska will be our permanent supply.”</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had risen to 315 parts per million.</p>
<i>Antitrichia curtipendula</i> to the light-green lichens belonging to the genus Usnea, known more commonly as old man’s beard and witches’ hair, respectively.
<p>To harvest big trees more easily, however, the government had to build roads across Prince of Wales. In the mid-1960s it constructed one about 200 yards away from the old spruce, paving it with shot rock from a quarry.</p>
<p>For companies seeking to supply the growing market for paper and for rayon, made from cellulose, these large trees were ideal.</p>
<p>And Alaska Native corporations, the companies established in 1971 after receiving a small portion of their original homelands, also chopped down old growth. Within three decades, just a fraction still stood.</p>
<h3><b>A land for loggers</b></h3>
<p>Michael Kampnich, who grew up in dairy country in Upstate New York, found work as “a feller” in 1980 on Prince of Wales.</p>
<p> Scenes from the Tongass National Forest in July: Downtown Juneau, Alaska's capital; the shoreline of Prince of Wales Island; and visitors to Nugget Falls at the Mendenhall Glacier, near Juneau. </p>
<p>But others kept coming, especially as logging became more difficult in the Pacific Northwest. Keith Landers had worked in Oregon for two decades, taking the leftover timber for shingles, but the old growth was running out.</p>
<p>“It has to be old timber,” he explained. “I mean, we can cut second growth, but the people on the other end are not going to like it. It’s just not going to last.”</p>
<p>Landers was undeterred. He heard about a small mill for sale near Thorne Bay, and in 1994 decided it was time to move.</p>
<p>Public officials made it clear that they wanted loggers like Landers to reap the island’s bounty. A few years after his arrival, they paved the road running past the massive spruce to make it even easier to transport the giant logs.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know what Ted Stevens is worried about,” the president remarked.</p>
<p>Barack Obama’s administration tried to forge a compromise, to shift over time to logging “young-growth” trees that were half-a-century old. But once Donald Trump was elected, it was clear the plan would be scrapped.</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at 405 parts per million. And the spruce on Prince of Wales faced the prospect of the ax once more.</p>
<h3><b>Reclaiming the forest</b></h3>
<p>By the time Jimmy Anderson died in 2014, attitudes about logging had begun to change. Marina emerged as the one who would uphold her family’s Haida and Tlingit traditions, reviving a way of life.</p>
<b> </b>to teach a group of Native teenagers how to spot plants ripe for picking.
<p>“It’s so hot,” she groused, twisting her long auburn hair into a bun and placing a broad-brimmed cedar hat atop her head.</p>
<p> Marina Anderson, a member of the Haida and Tlingit nations, teaches members of the Alaska Youth Stewards about foraging traditions like harvesting rice from the roots of chocolate lilies. </p>
<p>Walking through the forest, Anderson stopped to marvel at the power of old growth, the ancient trees above her, the rich and spongy ground beneath her feet.</p>
<p>The notion of cutting them down for high-end houses infuriates her.</p>
<p>“We have to stop,” she said. “There is not enough left for everybody, and we’re not going to let any go.”</p>
<b> </b>knowledge that draws on the resources of the forest, rivers and sea to withstand the disorienting present. The past, almost invisible now, provides a path forward.
<p>Her friend and colleague, wood carver Michael Chilton, hovered so closely to watch as his father carved wood that it amounted to an implicit ultimatum: “It was either teach me, or I’ll get myself cut.”</p>
<p>Chilton, now 30, began carving at the age of nine. His dad, now 56, had done the same, pestering his uncles as a kid in Juneau to teach him even the basics of the craft.</p>
<p>A tattoo on her rib cage captures one of her father’s favorite sayings: “Being Haida is not about the things that you do. Being Haida is about the way you do things.”</p>
<p> Wildlife and nature are a major driver of the economy in the Tongass, from tourism at the Mendenhall Glacier to whale watching off Juneau and fish processing in the city, as Martin Shelton unloads Taku River salmon for Yakobi Fisheries. </p>
<p>This is the sort of small-scale employment that Meredith Trainor, executive director of the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, sees as sustaining the shift away from logging.</p>
<p>“The answer is that it’s many things that get stitched together,” Trainor said. “And that makes us safer.”</p>
<p>“Some of what they were saying, I saw it happening,” he said. “The conservationists were right.”</p>
<p>Kampnich knows that on Prince of Wales, many people are wary of stopping logging altogether. But he thinks there is room for small operators like Landers to stay in business.</p>
<h3><b>‘You want to hold on to that carbon’</b></h3>
<p>“Viking is a big supporter of the city of Craig,” he reminded them. “We provide them with heat for their middle school, and elementary and swimming pool. The reason we can do that is because we’ve got a high-value log.”</p>
<p>“You don’t force business into doing something different because it’s socially unacceptable,” Dahlstrom argued.</p>
<p> Viking Lumber Co. is the only major sawmill operating on Prince of Wales, near the town of Klawock. It focuses on harvesting old-growth trees. </p>
<p>But when Joe Biden won the presidency in November, it was clear the roadless rule would be back. And Forest Service officials on the ground, for their part, are exploring what the agency can do to support the economy beyond holding timber sales.</p>
<p>“They just see the timber,” she said. “They don’t see all the other projects.”</p>
<p> Scenes of logging operations in the Tongass National Forest, in July. Debris remains after clear-cutting on Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority land, while a truck carries timber from old-growth trees on a road through the forest. </p>
<p>“In a climate emergency, you want to hold onto that carbon, you don’t want to put it into the atmosphere,” DellaSala said. “You want to absorb it, but you want to hold onto it as well.”</p>
<p>The magnitude of the moment stunned her. Alaska’s ancient trees would be spared. And she rejoiced.</p>
<p>The amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere stood at 412.5 parts per million and rising.</p>
<p>Several miles away, the battered crown of the spruce towered over the landscape. The blue death mark remained, but under the new policy, the timber sale that signaled its demise was canceled.</p>
<p>The venerable<b> </b>tree was safe. For now.</p>

<a>released a campaign ad</a> in which he shouldered a rifle and shot a hole in a copy of the cap-and-trade legislation, saying, “I’ll take dead aim at the cap-and-trade bill because it’s bad for West Virginia.”
<div><div><h5><div>Troubles with timing, filibuster</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Waxman, who now runs a public relations and lobbying firm called Waxman Strategies, said he learned several lessons from his experience with cap-and-trade that Democrats could heed today. One was the importance of timing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is a myth going around that is often repeated that President Obama didn't care that much about the cap-and-trade bill. That wasn't true. His efforts were essential to get it through the House,” Waxman said.</p></div></div>
<a>targets a vote on changing the Senate rules</a> by Jan. 17 — and as the party stares down the midterm elections in November.
<div><div><p>Waxman said he enthusiastically supports changing the Senate rules requiring a 60-vote threshold, which would have ensured the passage of cap-and-trade in the chamber. </p></div></div>
<div><p>“Had they broken the filibuster in the Senate, they would have passed it in the Senate because they had a majority vote ready to go for it,” he said. “So the lesson is we shouldn't have a filibuster in the Senate.”</p></div>
<div><div><h5><div>The importance of executive action</div></h5></div></div>
<p>After Waxman-Markey fizzled out in the Senate, Obama sought to cut emissions in ways that did not require congressional approval. In 2015, he unveiled the Clean Power Plan, which set the first-ever limits on carbon pollution from power plants.</p>
<div><div><p>If BBB flounders in the Senate, President Biden's ambitious emissions reduction goals will depend on Environmental Protection Agency regulations and executive action.</p></div></div>
<p>“[Biden] is trying to do everything he can right now with executive action. There are some things you can do, and I've recommended it to them,” Waxman said, although he declined to offer specifics on his suggestions to the White House.</p>
<div><div><p>Markey, who is now a senator, is not ready to give up on BBB.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We must get this done,” he added. “While the best time to act on climate was decades ago, the next best time is now.”</p></div></div>

<a>testified</a> that he deliberately withheld military protection of the Capitol before Jan. 6. Army Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, reportedly
<a>scrambled</a> to ensure the nation’s nuclear defense chains were secure from illegal orders. It is evident the whole of our military was caught off-guard.

<div><div><p>Last week, the developer waitlist for GPT-3 was removed, enabling a new suite of cross-platform applications and monetizations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If that sounds like a sentence a piece of software would write, you don’t know the half of it.</p></div></div>
<a>just said</a> it would make its language supercomputer GPT-3 open to any eligible developer. That’s a big deal. Six years ago we had primitive language-generators that could
<a>write basic earnings reports</a>. A few years later we had a program called GPT-2 that was
<a> at least 10 times more powerful</a>, able to process 1.5 billion parameters (the variables that determine machine-learning capabilities). Now there’s GPT-3, which can process 175 billion.
<div><div><p>That means many emails or essays could soon, potentially, be push-button affairs.</p></div></div>
<i>a lot</i> better — but the question of who actually is doing the writing becomes a lot more muddled. It could, in short, usher in a world where no one knows how good a communicator anyone really is.
<div><div><p>And, well, I don’t want to give my bosses any ideas, but journalism would be a pretty good target for this.</p></div></div>
<a>Sudowrite</a>, a language-generating app that blends its tools with the tech and even recently allowed a New York Times writer to
<a>complete his review</a> of a book about AI. So I called Amit Gupta, founder of Sudowrite, to ask what he saw as its utility.
<div><div><p>That sounds eminently reasonable — and frightening. If news stories can be written by machine, wouldn’t it be one more task where computers can tell humans to buzz off?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I decided to test GPT-3. To do so, I turned to one of the most famous pieces of journalism in the 20th century: Gay Talese’s “Frank Sinatra Has a Cold,” which <a>ran in Esquire</a> in 1966.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I fed the first few sentences of the piece into Sudowrite’s engine.</p></div></div>
