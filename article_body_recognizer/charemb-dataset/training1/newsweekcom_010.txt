<a>Democratic Party</a> at a time when it badly needs help. A tough loss in Virginia and close call in New Jersey in bellwether governor races this month, coupled with President
<a>Democrats</a>, is increasingly looking like a possible savior, although it's far too early in the process to place safe bets.
<a>Terry McAuliffe</a>, delivering a similar message at no charge.
<a>Brian Kemp</a>, a defeat she asserts was the result of systemic voter suppression by

<p>It's all a giant precursor—but to what, exactly?</p>
<p>For the record, Seth Bringman, spokesman for Abrams, says, "She has neither made nor announced such plans."</p>
<a>Beto O'Rourke</a> of Texas, now-Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and the four women elected to Congress who became known as "The Squad" also became national figures.
<p>"We did sketch out the entire decade in terms of the transformation that needed to happen in Georgia, and specifically her goals to run for governor," Groh-Wargo says.</p>

<a>Barack Obama</a> and Vice President
<a>Kamala Harris</a>, even though she's never held national office.
<p>"If she doesn't run, that will leave Georgia Democrats scrambling to find someone who can galvanize the Democratic Party the way she can," says Greer. "That could undo a lot of her work."</p>
<p>The Democratic nomination is hers for the taking whenever she deigns to claim it, most observers agree. While Kemp already has primary opponents, no Democrats have yet launched bids.</p>
<p>Early polling data supports the notion that Abrams could win even in what is shaping up as a hostile election year for Democrats; her favorability rating among Georgia voters<a> is 51 percent</a> versus just 42 percent with a favorable view of Kemp.</p>
<p>"Stacey has to have a job like you and I do," says Groh-Wargo, now the CEO of Fair Fight Action, who also says Abrams does not draw a salary from her nonprofits. "She has a set of things she does to make money and to promote her various causes."</p>
<a> Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a> and
<a> Washington Post</a>, for example, concluded that while there were some impediments to voting as the Abrams camp outlined, they almost certainly didn't affect the outcome.
<p>Her "shows" are not raucous rallies or fundraisers for her causes. She doesn't collect email addresses, ask for donations or direct anyone to her websites. Moderators are given suggested topics but also emphatically told to ask whatever they want.</p>
<p>Correction 11/10/21, 9:56 a.m. ET: Carolyn Hugley is a current, not former, Georgia State Representative and chair of Fair Count's board of directors; Lauren Groh-Wargo is CEO of Fair Fight Action.</p>
<p>The story has also been updated to include a response from an Abrams spokesman about her future plans for political office and to clarify a comment about the 2018 Georgia governor's race.</p>

<a>Glenn Youngkin</a>'s victory over Democrat
<p>As political commentator Van Jones, a former adviser to President <a>Barack Obama</a>, said on <a>CNN</a>, "Democrats are looking over the edge of a cliff."</p>
<p>Then the Delta variant spread, the number of COVID-19 cases—and deaths—began to rise again. And Biden's approval rating began its precipitous decline.</p>
<a>Joe Manchin</a> publicly criticized the $1.75 billion price tag, saying, in effect, that it was fraudulent, the result of "shell games" and "gimmicks."
<a>Bill Clinton</a> did when the GOP took the House in 1994.
<a>New York Times</a>, "I don't think it's hyperbole to say that the House and
<a>Senate</a> majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens."

<a>Krysten Sinema</a>, who has pushed back against significantly raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.
<p>"The cat herding process has begun," says Sabato. "He appears to be doing whatever he has to do within his own party to cajole, entice, convince—do whatever he has to do within his own party to reach a compromise."</p>
<p>This, Biden's allies insist, is precisely what Biden ran on: being able to lead people of disparate views and get things done. "Voters are looking for a return on what they were promised," says Jeff Horwitt, a Democratic pollster.</p>

<a>Twitter</a>, not the President of the United States," adding, "Isn't that what we ran against?"
<p>And perhaps more importantly for Biden, these steps would show him to be an active, capable and grown-up president headed toward 2024. And that, even at 81—the age he'll turn in November 2023—might make him viable for another term.</p>
