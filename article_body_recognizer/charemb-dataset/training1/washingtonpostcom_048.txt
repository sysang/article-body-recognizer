<div><div><p>In Nashville, where 4 inches has fallen from this system, it’s the snowiest day since Jan. 22, 2016, according to AccuWeather.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latest models continue to show 1 to 3 inches falling over the immediate D.C. area; here are some of the latest projections for the District based on simulations run in the past hour:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>High-resolution NAM: Around 3 inches</li><li>NAM: 2-2.5 inches</li><li>HRRR: 1.5-2 inches</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>We should note that the National Weather Service did lower its projections slightly, from 2 to 3 inches from 3 to 4 inches, and they are now pretty consistent with ours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Our next update will be around 5:45 p.m.</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Original forecast from 12:30 p.m.</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most of us sleep overnight, a high-altitude weather disturbance will zip across the Mid-Atlantic, coating the Washington and Baltimore area in snow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should develop about midnight and end by about 5 a.m. Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amounts may vary between about one and four inches over the region, but around two inches should be most common. Because temperatures will fall into the 20s as the flakes fall, many roads will become slick and treacherous.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There’s the possibility of a brief burst of heavy snow between about 1 and 3 a.m., falling at the clip of about an inch an hour, limiting visibility and making travel difficult.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mid-Atlantic, Northeast brace for burst of snow Friday morning</p></div>
<div><div><p>Although the snow will end well before sunrise, untreated roads will probably be slippery for the Friday morning commute, so we expect school delays and cancellations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Amounts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Computer model snowfall projections have edged slightly lower since Wednesday night, so we have shaved an inch off the most likely amounts in the immediate area, from two to four inches to one to three inches.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While we don’t expect a lot of regional variability in accumulation, we would generally lean toward the higher amounts north and west of Washington and somewhat lower totals to the south and southeast.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The track of this disturbance is farther north than Monday’s storm, so the jackpot totals will also probably be farther north.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s how much snow is forecast for Washington by the different models:</p></div></div>
<li>American (GFS): 4 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution NAM: 2 inches</li>
<li>High-resolution Canadian: 2 inches</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Timeline and temperatures</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The snow should move in between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. from west to east and end between 4 and 6 a.m., lasting only four to five hours in any one location.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The window for a possible burst of heavier snow is between about 1 and 3 a.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>10 p.m. to midnight:</b> Snow develops in our western areas. Temperatures: 30 to 35.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Midnight to 2 a.m.:</b> Snow begins in our eastern areas, while increasing in intensity to the west. Temperatures: 30 to 34 degrees.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2 a.m. to 4 a.m.:</b> Snow lightens in western areas, while picking up to the east. Temperatures 26 to 31.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>4 a.m. to 6 a.m.:</b> Snow decreases in eastern areas and ends everywhere from west to east. Temperatures 25 to 29.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><i>Temperature ranges shown above are lowest in our northwest areas (Loudoun and Frederick counties) and highest to the southeast (Stafford County, Fredericksburg and southern Maryland).</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Impacts</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But as many neighborhood roads may well be untreated through rush hour, we do expect widespread school delays and some cancellations. Also, with temperatures holding at or below freezing on Friday, little will melt.</p></div></div>
<div><p>We don’t expect wind to be a big issue with this system Thursday night. However, as the system pulls away Friday morning, winds will become gusty, blowing the snow around a bit and creating bitter wind chills in the teens and 20s.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The consistency of the snow may start off as a bit heavy and wet, but it should turn more powdery as temperatures fall. The risk of power outages is low.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Could the ‘D.C. snow hole’ return with this event?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While one to three inches of snow seem most likely, and locally heavier amounts are possible, there’s also the possibility of just a dusting.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We sometimes see this circumstance in the D.C. area with storm systems coming in from the west, and it has been given the endearing name of the “D.C. snow hole.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Around downtown Washington, the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay, some snow accumulation may also be lost because of melting, as temperatures may be a little above freezing as the snow develops before slowly falling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How might we see a snow ‘boom’?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the snow hole scenario is possible, there’s also a way for snowfall to exceed expectations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some models have even shown an elevated unstable layer that could briefly enhance snowfall rates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The big forecast problem is whether and where any bands of heavier snow occur.</p></div></div>
<div><h1>Metro safety commission orders cars out of service, saying agency didn’t follow terms of plan</h1></div>
<h2>The commission directed Metro to overhaul its return-to-service plan for its 7000-series rail cars</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ian Duncan</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 29, 2021 at 7:14 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>“We caught this,” Smith said. “The idea behind the plan is that Metro should be implementing it so there’s nothing to catch.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Metro suspends more than half of its rail cars after investigation uncovers safety problems</p></div>
<div><div><p>Metro spokesman Ian Jannetta said the cars had been pulled from service so the agency could revise its inspection criteria.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve paused use to clarify the confirmation process for measurements once wheelsets are identified as requiring additional follow up within our criteria,” he wrote in an email.</p></div></div>
<p>Metro had announced Dec. 23 it was pausing the reintroduction of additional cars and switching from weekly to daily inspections. Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said at the time that daily inspections were “the safest course.”</p>
<div><p>Metro lays out early plan for reincorporating suspended series of trains</p></div>
<div><div><p>Metro then carried out tests using out-of-service cars to determine how often they needed to be inspected to ensure the defect didn’t develop unnoticed between standard 90-day inspections.</p></div></div>
<p>The safety commission approved a plan this month that allowed Metro to gradually begin reintroducing the cars, subject to weekly wheel inspections and other criteria. A safety consultant hired by the agency then recommended the daily inspections.</p>
<div><p>Metro says derailment risk found in other model of rail car is ‘outlier’</p></div>
<p>Metro knew about the problem as far back as 2017, although it initially appeared in a small number of rail cars. A group of senators has asked Metro to turn over a detailed timeline showing what steps it had taken since then to address the problem.</p>

<div><p>“That is something that we will look at,” Parker said. “We have to weigh that with the fact that people want to get to where they want to get to, and we can’t necessarily predict the outcome of each storm.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>A state police spokeswoman said the agency had received no reports of deaths or injuries as a result of the massive backups.</p></div></div>
<div><p>D.C. region races to restore power, dig out icy roads a day after big snowstorm</p></div>
<div><div><p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said Tuesday that emergency crews were using highway express lanes to reach stranded motorists and get them to warming shelters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said he had the National Guard on standby but had not deployed it because the challenge was in reaching vehicles, not a lack of personnel or equipment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Analysis: Here's what made Monday's snowstorm so severe</p></div>
<div><div><p>But some motorists said they aren’t to blame for what they saw as government officials’ poor planning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m not angry at the snow,” Schorr said. “I’m just upset at the way they handled it.”</p></div></div>
<p>Most frustrating, she said, was the lack of communication from state and local officials as she and her husband took turns catnapping overnight in their Mazda. Finally, on Tuesday morning, they received a push alert on their phones from Virginia.</p>
<div><div><p>“It was a catastrophe for people,” he said. “Our road guys are first-rate, and I’ve never heard of anything quite like this occurring in Virginia.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It seems like they weren’t taking it seriously,” she said. “It seems like they didn’t think it was the emergency that it was.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine said he left Richmond about 1 p.m. Monday for a voting-rights meeting later that day. Traffic would stop for five or six hours, then move slowly for a time, and stop again.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overnight, stranded in below-freezing temperatures, he said he would heat the car as much as he could, then turn the engine off for an hour to conserve fuel while he tried to sleep.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I would nap for 15 or 20 minutes — usually I’d wake up because I got too cold,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overnight, he said, a man traveling with his family from Florida back home to Connecticut walked car-to-car, delivering souvenir Florida oranges to hungry people who hadn’t eaten in hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was a lot of good neighborly spirit last night,” he said, later arriving at the Capitol following a 27-hour commute.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Two chicks, one truck,” Rusher said. “We’re hard to miss.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They encouraged stranded motorists to approach other tractor-trailer drivers, who carry food and water for long hauls.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Then they decided they would push the trees out of the way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was kind of like a survival mode,” Hildenbrand said. “We just felt: ’I need to get off this highway.’”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After much effort, the men said they managed to shove the trees far enough apart that their four-wheel-drive truck made it over at least a foot of snow and ice.</p></div></div>

<h2>VDOT is asking motorists to stay off roads as questions mount about the state’s handling of a snowstorm meltdown</h2>

<div><p>Timeline: How a winter storm brought I-95 to a standstill</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Federal Highway Administration will participate in VDOT’s review, the agency said in a statement Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a letter to both administrations, Spanberger said she had heard from constituents who were trapped with infants, trying to reach a parent’s funeral or in the middle of what was supposed to be a typical commute home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They reported receiving no guidance, information, or support for hours as they attempted to ration gas, stay warm, and calm their scared children,” she wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Many questioned whether VDOT had an emergency plan for such an event and why the agency didn’t provide more information, both to prevent motorists from entering the clogged highway or provide guidance once they were stuck.</p></div>
<div><p>David Snyder, a longtime Falls Church City Council member who serves on the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments’ transportation and emergency preparedness committees, said he has asked COG to examine what went wrong.</p></div>
<div><div><p>While Northam placed some of the blame Tuesday on motorists who didn’t heed warnings to stay off the highways, Snyder said the state needs to understand why the message didn’t get through.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That public communication element is very, very important,” he said. “Whatever was done in this case, clearly it wasn’t enough to help prevent people from getting into this situation.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The inquiry is “not intended as a forum for personal, and agency criticism,” the memo said. “It is an opportunity for critical thinking and problem solving.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokesman for Youngkin did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday on the highway meltdown. Youngkin, who will take office Jan. 15, also has not weighed in on social media.</p></div></div>
<a>since a 2011 snowstorm</a> during an evening rush hour left motorists stranded on Washington-area roads overnight.
<a>in a tweet</a> to stay off local roads, saying more than 100 remained closed in the Fredericksburg area because of snow and ice, downed trees or fallen utility lines.
<div><div><p>A trooper made it to the scene by 8:40 a.m. But even as authorities tried to remove the vehicle from the road, a chain reaction already had begun, with vehicles braking to avoid crashing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here's what made Monday's snowstorm so severe</p></div>
<div><div><p>“This was a process that repeated itself continuously through the day, night and next day on Interstate 95 with multiple wreckers and troopers,” Geller said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Javed Ali, a former senior federal intelligence and counterterrorism official who now teaches at the University of Michigan, said the prolonged shutdown so close to the nation’s capital raised national security implications.</p></div>
<div><p>D.C. region continues to recover from Monday's major snowstorm</p></div>
<div><div><p>Ali said federal homeland security officials might need to do more to assist state and local officials to make sure key infrastructure doesn’t fail again.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There wasn’t the right sense of urgency, or it wasn’t tackled with the level of vigor it should have been, considering how terrible the situation was on the ground,” Ali said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said the Virginia National Guard should have been deployed, although state emergency management officials said the Guard is not typically called on in such situations.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Virginia Department of Emergency Management, said in a statement. “State agencies and localities have significant resources and contracts in place. There was no request for Guard resources from state agencies or local jurisdictions.”
<div><div><p>“It creates a really tough situation to deal with,” said Wilfrid Nixon, a former University of Iowa engineering professor who focused on winter highway maintenance.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Virginia reopens I-95 after winter storm forced closure that stranded motorists</p></div>
<div><div><p>It’s also understandable, he said, that VDOT would struggle to keep up with an unusually fast snowfall. Local officials reported bands of snow that fell up to two inches per hour.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A few inches of snow possible Thursday night, with slick roads Friday morning</p></div>
<div><div><p>With little information and no sign of help, motorists muddled through the night alone or relied on one another.</p></div></div>
<p>“Everyone was actually very friendly even though everyone was pretty frustrated,” Mason said. "… There was no kind of messages sent. We couldn’t really get any information online about when we would start to go again.”</p>
<div><div><p>Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) became the most high-profile motorist trapped overnight as he headed to Washington from Richmond for a voting rights meeting. His two-hour commute turned into nearly 27 hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine said Wednesday that Virginia possibly could use federal dollars from the recently approved federal infrastructure act to improve the chances of preventing another catastrophe in the I-95 corridor.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A White House spokesperson referred questions to OSHA. Representatives from OSHA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said the Postal Service’s feverishly busy holiday season would prevent the agency of 650,000 employees from timely compliance with the OSHA standards.</p></div></div>

<p>Experts say those reasons may be insufficient to persuade OSHA to grant what’s known as a “variance,” a technical process that requires employers to demonstrate alternative measures that would provide equal workplace protections.</p>

<div><h1>Snow-starved Mid-Atlantic ski areas set to open as fresh powder, cold air arrive</h1></div>
<h2>Some resorts could receive up to 10 inches after a miserably warm start to winter that has hampered operations</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By John Hopewell</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:07 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>After a very warm December that caused many Mid-Atlantic ski resorts to temporally shutter, or not even get the lifts spinning in the first place, the second snowstorm in five days will allow all 14 resorts to drop the ropes to restless snow lovers.</p>
<div><p>A couple inches of snow most likely from fast-moving system tonight in D.C. area</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Since the frontside of our mountain is north-facing, we were able to hold on to that snow once we got it down,” said DeVier-Scott.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Winter is the fastest warming season in the United States</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Snowshoe Mountain is also running below average, but ski conditions could turn around as soon as Thursday night.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Wintergreen in Virginia reopened Wednesday after receiving 11 inches of snow from the storm earlier in the week, said Lori Zaloga, its director of marketing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our snowmakers have been hard at work, essentially rebuilding from scratch,” said Jeff Lifgren, vice president and general manager at Liberty Mountain.</p></div></div>
<p>“We are incredibly hopeful that we will see a return to a more normal winter with abundant snowfall and cold temps,” said Alex Moser, director of marketing and communications at the Seven Springs Mountain Resort in Pennsylvania.</p>
<div><div><p>His wish is coming true this weekend. But before you head to the hills, check the resort websites for updates on conditions and trail counts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Forecast through the weekend</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But even after the storm passes, temperatures will be ideal for snow-making through Saturday, with highs mostly in the 20s and lows in the teens (and even single digits at altitudes above 3,000 feet).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Temperatures will moderate some Sunday, and there could be a bit of freezing rain at ski areas early in the day, changing to plain rain, with highs near 40.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another blast of cold Monday promises a return to favorable snow-making conditions.</p></div></div>
