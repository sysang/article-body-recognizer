<div> <div> <h1>Hypersomnolence</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Hypersomnolence is marked by excessive and chronic daytime sleepiness. People who suffer this disorder do not enjoy restorative nighttime sleep, though some individuals sleep up to seven hours a night.</p>
<p>These sufferers nap throughout the day—at work, sitting down at dinner, and even at social events. The sleepiness is gradual and not normally experienced as an onslaught. The napping does not give the sufferer relief. </p>
<p>This disorder is common in both males and females, and onset age is 17 to 24. About 1 percent of the population experiences symptoms of hypersomnolence, particularly the prolonged impairment of alertness upon waking (sleep drunkenness).</p>
<p>This disorder is also associated with depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, substance-related disorders, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple system atrophy. </p>
<p>Signs and symptoms of hypersomnolence, as cataloged by the <a>DSM-5</a>: </p>
<li>Excessive sleepiness, despite getting at least seven hours of sleep per night</li>
<li>Recurrent daytime naps or lapses into sleep during the same day</li>
<li>Non-restorative nighttime sleep that lasts for more than seven hours</li>
<li>Difficulty fully waking from a long sleep and feelings of confusion or disorientation that may last minutes or hours</li>
<li>Increased sleep time (up to 14 to 18 hours per day)</li>
<li>Significant distress or impairment in functioning as a result of excessive sleep</li>
<p>Other possible symptoms:</p>
<li>Loss of <a>appetite</a></li>
<li>Difficulties with <a>memory</a></li>
<li>Inability to function at work, home, or socially</li>
<p>To be diagnosed with hypersomnolence, excessive sleepiness cannot be due to the physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition.</p>

<a>alcohol abuse</a> can cause hypersomnolence. Other sleep disorders can also cause it, including narcolepsy or sleep apnea, or dysfunction of the autonomic
<a>nervous system</a>. Physical problems, such as a tumor, head
<a>trauma</a>, or injury to the central nervous system can also cause the condition. In addition, medications or
<a>medication</a> withdrawal may also cause hypersomnolence. Other possible contributors include medical conditions including multiple sclerosis,
<a>depression</a>, encephalitis, epilepsy, or obesity. And some people appear to have a genetic predisposition to hypersomnolence.
<a>methylphenidate</a>, or modafinil may be prescribed. Other possible drugs for treatment include clonidine, levodopa, bromocriptine,
<a>antidepressants</a>, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). Lifestyle changes may help. A better
<a>diet</a>, as well as avoiding social activities or nighttime work that delay bedtime may also help.
<p>See your primary care physician if you:</p>
<ul><li>Repeatedly cannot fall asleep at night</li> <li>Perpetually feel tired during the day</li> </ul>
<p>Your physician may refer you to a sleep specialist. Sleep disorders can be treated effectively.</p>

<li>Regular exercise can improve some diseases and disabilities in older people who already have them. It can improve mood and relieve depression, too.</li>
<li>Staying physically active on a regular, permanent basis can help prevent or delay certain diseases (like some types of cancer, heart disease, or diabetes) and disabilities.</li>
<p>Make sure you are exercising safely:</p>
<li>Start slowly. Build up your activities and your level of effort gradually. Doing too much too soon can hurt you, especially if you have been inactive.</li>
<li>Use safety equipment, such as helmets, knee and elbow pads, and eye protection.</li>
<li>Unless your doctor has asked you to limit fluids, be sure to drink plenty when you are doing endurance activities that make you sweat. Many older people do not drink enough fluids, even when not exercising.</li>
<li>When you bend forward, bend from the hips, not the waist. If you keep your back straight, you're probably bending correctly. If you let your back "hump," you're probably bending from the waist.</li>
<li>Make sure your muscles are warmed up before you stretch. For example, you can do a little easy biking, or walking, and light arm pumping first.</li>
<p>None of the exercises you do should hurt or make you feel really tired. You might feel soreness, a slight discomfort, or a little weariness, but you should not feel pain. Physical activity and exercise will probably make you feel better.</p>

<p>Barbiturates, such as mephobarbital (Mebaral) and pentobarbital sodium (Nembutal), can be used to treat anxiety, tension, and sleep disorders.</p>

<p>At high doses or when they are abused, many of these drugs can cause unconsciousness or even death.</p>
<p>When taking sedatives of any kind, the activity of the central <a>nervous system</a> becomes slowed down. Small doses relieve tension; large doses increase the risk of other undesirable side effects. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Staggering</li> <li>Blurred vision</li> <li>Impaired perception of time and space</li> <li>Slowed reflexes and breathing</li> <li>Reduced sensitivity to pain</li> <li>Impaired thinking</li> <li>Slurred speech</li> </ul>
<p>Overdoses cause unconsciousness, coma, and death. Accidental overdoses may occur when children swallow pills or when adults with increased tolerance are unsure of how many to take.</p>
<p>Other health risks of sedative use include:</p>
<ul><li>Anemia</li> <li><a>Depression</a></li> <li>Impairment of liver function</li> <li>Chronic intoxication (headache, impaired vision, slurred speech)</li> </ul>

<p>Very significant levels of physiological dependence marked by both tolerance and withdrawal can develop in response to the sedatives. The timing and severity of withdrawal issues will differ depending on the specific substance.</p>
<p>A physical symptom of dependence is tolerance, meaning higher levels are needed to achieve the same calming effect.</p>
<p>Symptoms of psychological dependence include needing the drug to function and being obsessed with obtaining the drug.</p>
