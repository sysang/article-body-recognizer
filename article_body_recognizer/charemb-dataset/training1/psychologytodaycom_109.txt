<li>Feeling like you are running a parallel thought process about COVID-19 or any other topic or topics while living through your day</li>
<li>Feeling like you are on the edge all the time</li>
<li>Feeling overwhelmed when other people share their worries or concerns, rather than sympathetic</li>
<li>Feeling agitated even without a specific trigger</li>
<p>Resolutions are often related to making changes to your physical body. I challenge you to set intentions regarding how you will nurture your body, mind, and soul.</p>
<li>Instead of “I want to lose 20 pounds,” set your intention to “I will be accepting of my body and to give it rest when it needs it.” </li>
<li>Instead of “I will eat cleaner or healthier,” set your intention to “I will feed my body nourishing foods that give my body energy and <a>nutrition</a>.”</li>
<li>Instead of “I will be more positive,” set your intention to “I will be accepting of my body shape and weight and use kind words when speaking to myself.”</li>
<li>Instead of “I will be a better parent,” set your intention to “I will take a pause before I respond to my children and assess what my child is trying to tell me and try to respond accordingly.”</li>
<p>Shift your intentions from the outer world to the inner world of your body and mind where the true work really matters and makes the most lasting impact.</p>
<h3>Set Realistic Goals for Your Daily Functioning</h3>
<a>goals</a> that are unrealistic and unachievable. Even if we are able to hold onto them for the first month of the year, they are not sustainable for the long term and, hence, why new year’s resolutions often have a bad reputation.
<p>Set goals that are doable on a daily basis, such as the following:</p>
<li>I will set aside five minutes each morning and/or each night to sit in silence with my thoughts to process the day.</li>
<li>I will take a 20-minute walk three times per week.</li>
<li>I will write in my journal (a physical notebook or Google Doc that you can access from your phone) two times per week for five minutes.</li>
<p>As we enter into a new year, let’s set our intentions with a focus on our self-care, self-respect, and our mental and emotional well-being as parents.</p>

<h1> The Art of Staying Motivated </h1>
<h2> Staying on track isn't about willpower but handling the underlying problems. </h2>
<li>Staying motivated isn't about willpower but overcoming the underlying obstacles that can arise at the beginning, middle, and end stages.</li>
<li>Beginning challenges include confusing "shoulds" and "wants," having vague goals, getting lost in the means and losing sight of the ends.</li>
<li>Build into your overall plan ways of offsetting your challenges: Having support, setting a realistic pace, having a clear vision.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: geralt/pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The key is to unlock those underlying problems, and for this, it’s helpful to sort them into beginnings, middles, and ends. Here are some of the common culprits:</p>
<ul><li>It’s a should not a want; it’s someone’s else’s idea and not yours</li> </ul>
<a>career</a> or health. Shoulds usually come from others—their rules, priorities, what your friends or the media say—and you can feel guilty or
<a>anxious</a> if you don’t follow them. Motivation doesn’t come from shoulds, but from wants—those gut reactions, that sense of excitement, that drive. The gas quickly runs out on shoulds; it’s the wants that keep you going.
<ul><li>Your goals are too vague</li> </ul>
<ul><li>You get lost in the means and lose sight of the ends</li> </ul>
<a>divorced</a> or learning to control your drinking may be a means to the larger end of having healthier relationships or better health. If you lose sight of the ultimate goal, the steps along the way can seem pointless and overwhelming.
<h3>Middles: You don’t anticipate the slump</h3>
<h3>Endings: Self-criticism and crashing</h3>
<li>Look back on your patterns: Where do you get stuck? The beginning, the middle, the end? What derails you? Try to solve the underlying problem.</li>
<li>Start with clear passion: Make sure you are emotionally invested in the endeavor. Do the gut check: Would you want to do this if no one made you, or if you didn’t get paid to do it?</li>
<li>Have a clear vision: Look for the ultimate goal—to change your appearance rather than following through on a <a>diet</a>, to complete and try to publish that novel, to have a healthier lifestyle.</li>
<p>Staying motivated isn’t about white-knuckle <a>willpower</a> but about knowing your particular challenges and having strategies to overcome them. By learning to work around your weaknesses, you can build on your strengths.</p>

<h1> Turning Over the Big Quit </h1>
<h2> What employers can do to prevent their employees from leaving in droves. </h2>
<li>To counter the "Great Resignation," many companies implemented quick fixes to weather the storm.</li>
<li>Tech giants are no exception: Apple employees recently received unexpectedly large bonuses, while Facebook changed its brand entirely to Meta.</li>
<li>Companies that take the time to figure out what employees really want will retain (and even attract) talent.</li>
<h3>Meaningful interactions</h3>
<p>The first step in changing anything is to learn more. Companies that take the time to figure out why their employees are leaving will have an edge in retaining (and attracting) talent.</p>
<a>identity</a>. Beyond all the financial perks, employees need to feel valued by their organizations and colleagues.
<p>Companies that can offer meaningful interactions, and social and interpersonal connections, are best placed to build a strong organization.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see how this could work—many developers now want to be a part of what Mark Zuckerberg calls “the next chapter of the internet.”</p>
<p>People these days choose jobs based more on wanting to be part of a vision and not based solely on a paycheck.</p>
<ul><li>They didn’t feel valued by their organizations,</li> <li>they didn’t feel valued by their managers, or</li> <li>they didn’t feel a sense of belonging at work.</li> </ul>
<p>And even more importantly, among the employees surveyed, 36 percent who quit in the past six months did so without having a new job already lined up.</p>
<p>Companies that put people at the heart of the action will win because, ultimately, people make change happen.</p>
<a>goals</a>, and design teams for speed and
<a>innovation</a>. In this day and age, many employees desire a culture of accountability where they themselves can take ownership.

<h1> The Trouble With Trying to Change the World </h1>
<h2> A Personal Perspective: How to know when you're doing enough for the world. </h2>
<li>People who work to make the world a better place often struggle with the question of whether they're doing enough. </li>
<li>Define what is enough. The more you quantify your aspirations, the more likely you'll know, and feel satisfaction, when you reach them. </li>
<li>Sometimes the better part of wisdom isn’t in improvement philosophies but acceptance. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Free JPG</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Burnout, as anyone involved in activism or advocacy will tell you, isn’t just the result of hard work or even overwork, but a sense of futility, the <a>fear</a> that all your hard work isn’t making enough of a difference.</p>
<a>marriage</a>, family, health), it’s extremely common for people to feel like they’re not doing enough with their time, talent, and resources, and the world’s problems just keep gathering force like storms offshore.
<p>The hard truth is that the difference any of our individual lives is likely to make in terms of human history, evolution, consciousness, or suffering, is roughly equivalent to throwing a stone into a lake.</p>
<a>goals</a>, the more likely you'll know—and feel satisfaction—when you reach them.
<a>attachment</a> to outcome, or a regular contemplation of the impact your work makes in individual people’s lives—all of which are examples of “changing the world,” but far more quantifiable.
<a>grief</a> is attached to your sense of insufficiency—the sheer enormity of the world’s problems and the achingly limited resources you bring to bear on them.

<h1> Relationship Disenchantment </h1>
<h2> Challenging relationship burnout and revitalizing your relationship. </h2>
<p>New lovers often promise each other that they will be together forever. Offering glorious promises of enduring intertwinement, they willingly pledge to give up personal independence in exchange for a future of secure belonging.</p>
<a>attention</a> to these early warning signs of potential demise, they could more easily reverse their downward course and turn things around before it is too late.
<p>The Warning Signs of Relationship Disenchantment</p>
<a>resilience</a> and keep those reservoirs full. Like emergency vehicles always ready for the next call, their resources are up-to-date and in good condition.
<a>infidelity</a>, commitments to others, plunging into alternate activities, more intense
<a>spiritual</a> commitment, or seeking personal
<a>therapy</a> are likely occurrences.
<a>motivation</a> to continue the struggle.
<p>Blame and guilt never creates a foundation for learning or transformation. They are more than useless responses; they destroy any hope of a relationship’s finding its way back.</p>
<a>confidence</a> in what was once a strong and resilient bond.
<a>depression</a>, fearing that they might never find another love. From that place of anticipated loss, they may not be able to bear the powerless heartbreak and give up. When
<a>intimacy</a> is replaced with apathy, people don’t hurt as much anymore but are simultaneously less motivated to care about the outcome.
<a>sexual</a> interest will wane, their emotional
<a>risk-taking</a> will sharply dissipate, and their faith in love and intimacy will be severely compromised.
<p>Preventing Relationship Disenchantment</p>
<a>stressed</a> and more self-preservation than caring. It can be done if both partners agree to support each other’s points of view.
<a>lonely</a> internal struggles in the presence of someone who was once their most trusted go-to person.
<a>anxiety</a>, guilt, depression, frustration, martyrdom, resentment, and the like, must be put aside. They burden a relationship that is already fragile.
<a>teamwork</a> is essential to stop the bleeding.
<p>Positive escapes return partners more able to re-commit to the relationship with more renewed energy and hope. Those that bring them back dissipated, more discouraged, and less open to new ways of being are understandably counter-productive.</p>
<a>openness</a> a couple needs to begin a healing process.

<h1> Feeling the Squeeze: The Stress of Caring for Two Generations </h1>
<h2> Coping with caring for aging parents and your own family. </h2>
<p> Posted August 14, 2011 </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Stress? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist to overcome stress</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>survey conducted by the National Alliance for Caregiving</a> in
<a>collaboration</a> with the AARP, an estimated 65.7 million people in the United States serve as unpaid caregivers. The majority of these caregivers (66%) are women, and for many, it's taking its toll. In fact, the
<a>American Psychological Association</a> discovered that more women than men in the "sandwich generation" report experiencing extreme stress and feel that they manage their stress poorly.
<p>A recipe for <a>burnout</a>? Absolutely. In fact, <a>caregiver</a> burnout is becoming a leading cause of burnout among women who are juggling <a>career</a>, child care, and the care of elderly parents.</p>
<p>Warning Signs of Caregiver Burnout:* Fatigue that doesn't resolve with a good night or two of sleep</p>
<p>* Feeling little or no satisfaction in what you do</p>
<p>* Persistent feelings of helplessness or hopelessness</p>
<p>* Neglecting your needs because you don't have the time, energy, or <a>motivation</a> to take care of yourself</p>
<p>* Increased irritability, impatience, frustration, and/or <a>anger</a>, including toward the people you are caring for</p>
<p>* Ongoing feelings of sadness and/or frequent crying spells</p>
<p>* Changes in eating and/or unplanned weight loss or weight gain</p>
<p>* <a>Insomnia</a> or hypersomnia</p>
<p>* Loss of interest in people or activities that were once enjoyable</p>
<p>* Physical symptoms, such as headaches or heart palpitations</p>
<p>* Chronic worry or <a>anxiety</a> as to how you will manage everything on your plate</p>
<p>Lessening the Squeeze: If you're feeling squeezed by the responsibilities of caring for your own family as well as your aging parents, here are a few suggestions to find more balance and better manage your time and your stress.</p>
<a>diet</a> (even fast food restaurants are offering healthier choices), and carve out some time for yourself, even if you can only spare a small amount. This kind of basic self-care will give you the energy you need to better handle your responsibilities.

<a>gender</a> gap regarding the mental load of running a home and parenting kids, we can talk about how being a working parent is
<a>stressful</a>. But until recently, we haven’t been able to talk about how parenting itself can burn the parent out.
<p>You Can’t Give What You Don’t Have:</p>
<a>Attachment</a>, or the lack thereof, can be damaging. That’s why it’s so threatening to even consider the possibility that parents can burn out. But if we can’t think about it, we can’t do anything to address it.

<h1> 10 Strategies to Fight Job Burnout </h1>
<h2> New research identifies ways to prevent and overcome job burnout. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Burnout? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>2014</a> suffered from at least one symptom of
<a>burnout</a>, with the highest rates among mid-
<a>career</a> physicians. Surveys report that 73 percent of
<a>school teachers</a> experience extreme levels of stress and almost half leave in the first five years of teaching.
<p>Here are 10 strategies to fight job burnout.</p>
<p>1. The first step is to figure out if you are experiencing job burnout.</p>
<p>Awareness that you are experiencing job burnout is an essential first step.</p>
<li>Do you experience severe stress, fatigue, problems <a>sleeping</a> due to work.</li>
<li>Are you dreading going into work every day?</li>
<li>Do you worry about work even when you’re at home in your free time?</li>
<li>Have you become cynical or distant with coworkers?</li>
<li>Do you feel ineffective, like you aren’t able to accomplish tasks that used to be easy for you?</li>
<li>Do you experience more physical problems, like more headaches?</li>
<p>Once you are able to recognize symptoms of job burnout, then you can consider how to take action.</p>
<p>2. Try to get more sleep.</p>
<p>Getting too little sleep is a <a>major factor </a>in predicting burnout and a likely contributor to job burnout. Sleeping better is also an important sign that you’re <a>recovering</a> from burnout and ready to go back to work.</p>
<p>3. Do cardiovascular exercise regularly.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular exercise has been shown in <a>studies</a> to significantly reduce burnout symptoms in as little as four weeks.</p>
<p>Yoga programs are helping school teachers, nurses, medical students, and first responders prevent and fight burnout. Studies show that it can significantly reduce<a> emotional exhaustion</a>.</p>
<p>5. Try <a>mindfulness meditation</a>.</p>
<a>Mindfulness</a> meditation is a technique that allows you to just be exactly where you are and observe without judgment. You can do
<a>mindfulness meditation</a> through free audio
<a>guided meditations online</a> or apps like Headspace. I've
<a>reviewed mindfulness apps here</a>. Practice for as little as 10 minutes a day. Observe your thoughts without judgment, and let them come and go like passing waves in the ocean or clouds in the sky.
<p>6. Practice mindful breathing.</p>
<p>If sitting is uncomfortable, try mindful walking. Pair your steps with your breath. Inhale for four steps, exhale for four steps. Adjust the number of steps based on your pace of walking to create an even, calming breath pattern.</p>
<p>8. Make time for other activities focused on self-care and self-compassion.</p>
<a>therapy</a> has been shown to reduce stress and
<a>anxiety</a> and levels of the stress
<a>cortisol</a>. A silent walk in nature or playing music can be restorative. Experiment to find what nourishes you.
<p>The key is doing the activity from a place of self-compassion. It sounds really simple, but you’d be surprised how hard it is to give ourselves “permission” to treat ourselves well.</p>
<p>9. Talk about your situation with people that you trust.</p>

<h1> Setting Boundaries at Work: Steps to Making Them a Reality </h1>
<h2> Is self-care possible at work? Consider boundaries. </h2>
<p> Posted January 30, 2009 </p>
<p>Examples of professional boundaries include the following:</p>
<p>-Schedule a regular lunch break daily to restore your energy and help manage <a>stress</a>. If it's not possible to take a walk, then give yourself time at your desk to read a book or magazine.</p>
<p>-Maintain your desired work schedule without allowing others - co-workers, employers, departmental crises - to compromise your ability to leave on time for the majority of your work week. </p>
<p>-Make "work talk" off limits during lunch hour, as a general rule. This includes office gossip and criticism.</p>
<p>-Minimize multi-tasking each day to avoid <a>burnout</a> by week's end.</p>

<h1> Burnout: Consider This Before You Quit </h1>
<h2> Self-assessment when confronting career burnout (psych careers and others) </h2>

<a>education</a> in these areas is lacking or only takes place at a conference one time a year, which can impact therapeutic effectiveness, boundaries, and leave therapists more vulnerable to
<a>attention</a> to a series of one-way relationships. The unique strain of opening-up empathically to another’s
<a>trauma</a> and pain without reciprocal emotional sharing tends to rub against the instinctual drive for mutuality and equality and can leave therapists emotionally exhausted and
<a>burned out</a>—which in turn, hampers the therapeutic process.
<p>The net result is that counselors and therapists face increasing burnout rates in record numbers.</p>
<a>career</a> field), it can help to pause and take a self-assessment that looks at the totality of your life. For instance, are there any other areas of life and/or deeper hidden
<a>dreams</a> that you have neglected?
<p>Looking at other areas of your life can be very revealing as you uncover neglected parts. Sometimes, redirecting your focus into multiple parts of life can enhance balance while squelching burnout (and allowing you to keep your job!).</p>
<a>decision-making</a> process (leading to higher risk of
<a>depression</a>, and career instability).
<p>If that’s not all, burning the proverbial bridge of one’s current trajectory also has a subtle way of distracting a person from some of the hidden areas and dreams that are calling (or screaming) to be acknowledged.</p>
<p>So, before you quit, consider doing a self-assessment on the following areas of your life.</p>
<p>First, how is your downtime? When was the last time you took a vacation? Do you allow yourself time every day to completely unplug when you get off work? Do you have at least one full day of rest each week?</p>
<a>laughter</a>, exploration, assistance, sharing in hobbies, etc. Not everyone can fill each need, so take an inventory of the relationships in your life that fill your needs and note any that aren’t met.

<p>Do you have close personal relationships that fill your intimate needs, where <a>intimacy</a> translates into “into me see” and allows for deeper soul-filled connection that is based on trust?</p>
<p>Do you have enough physical contact, where you get hugs from loved ones and satisfying <a>sexual</a> and/or intimate contact if in a committed partnership?</p>
<a>diet</a> and exercise and I suspect you know already the importance of this topic. Still, take an honest self-assessment in these areas as well. In addition, get your health checked and make sure your

<a>bipolar</a> symptoms, among other problems.
