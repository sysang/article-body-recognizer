<p>During the recent committee of supply debate, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing encouraged businesses to diversify amid the COVID-19 outbreak </p>
<p>Singapore businesses should not overly rely on any market and will now have to diversify when it comes to sources of supply chain and labour </p>
<p>But that's easier said than done. </p>
<p>Assoc Prof Goh Puay Guan from the department of Analytics and Operations at NUS Business School shares with Yasmin and Justine some of the ways companies can diversify</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why is a global vaccination certificate for travel taking so long to work out? </h1>
<div> <p>Establishing a global vaccine passport is looking like a long shot when many parts must come together, says INSEAD’s Wesley W Koo.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Wesley W Koo </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Most countries have a way to digitally verify if their residents are vaccinated. </p>
<p>In Singapore, there’s TraceTogether. Germany was the first country to issue a European Union Digital COVID Certificate recognised across EU countries.</p>
<p>But because an internationally recognised COVID-19 vaccination certification is lacking, people crossing borders, like travellers using the vaccinated travel lanes from the United States to Singapore, might encounter frictions.</p>
<p>After some overseas Singaporeans faced challenges with obtaining the needed vaccination proof to return home, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore eased rules and broadened the type of records that can be presented.</p>
<p>This issue is coming into sharper focus as more countries open up quarantine-free travel for the vaccinated and people want to travel again.</p>
<h2>MANY PARTS MUST COME TOGETHER SO A VACCINE PASSPORT WORKS SEAMLESSLY</h2>
<p>The big issue is that it is difficult to find a stakeholder who has the capability to create, promote and defend a set of common standards across national borders. </p>
<p>To understand why a vaccine passport is so difficult to implement at the global level, we need to think about a couple of concepts: Modularity and offline frictions. </p>
<p>The concept of modularity relates to how units which are developed independently can function together as a whole. </p>
<p>Indeed, a modular ecosystem is an effective solution to technological complexity. It allows companies and organisations to break down complex tasks into individual modules, and lets third-party developers innovate in one’s ecosystem. </p>
<h2>GETTING BUY-IN FOR A STANDARD IS HARD</h2>
<p>Creating a vaccine passport is easy. People with required technical skills can quickly generate a set of QR codes that uniquely identify a person’s vaccine records. </p>
<p>China has a QR code system categorising people with different-coloured virus statuses that can be scanned for entry into public spaces.</p>
<p>But the trouble is promoting a standard that is easily accepted by the governments of major countries. </p>
<p>Companies like Apple, Intel and Tencent have generated widely adopted standards through a combination of monetary subsidies and negotiations, with key stakeholders such as hardware manufacturers and software developers. </p>
<p>These tech companies already occupy very influential positions in their ecosystems in the first place. Their influence enables them to align incentives and get the buy-in of various stakeholders. </p>
<p>In the case of the vaccine passport, governments face disincentives in the promotion of a global vaccine standard. </p>
<p>The need to ensure quality immunisation registries, as well as to provide technological support such that records are easily accessible and verifiable while upholding privacy requires money, manpower and political resources. </p>
<p>Promoting a digital standard is an intricate, expensive process with uncertain outcomes and the possibility of backlash.</p>
<p>Political division between Indian states created hurdles for the implementation of India’s digital national ID, especially during the pandemic lockdowns when migrants needed to use the ID to access food rations.</p>
<p>The process of digitalising and sharing data was also hampered by political borders within India.</p>
<h2>A WORLD OF OFFLINE FRICTIONS</h2>
<p>Leaving aside the generally positive atmospherics of the Joe Biden-Xi Jinping summit, geopolitical tensions between countries make it exceedingly difficult to establish a standard.</p>
<p>Even within a country like the US, state officials disagree on whether entry to indoor activities – malls, restaurants, gyms – should require proof of vaccination. </p>
<h2>DIGITAL DIVIDES WITH A VACCINE PASSPORT</h2>
<p>Even after a digital standard is established, certain segments of the population may not be able to use it. </p>
<p>The ability to effectively use a digital tool often comes from interactions with others who have mastered the tool, instead of self-learning. </p>
<p>Similarly, marginalised individuals, including migrant workers who cross borders for work, may be more likely to not adopt a digital vaccine passport if they cannot learn to effectively use it.</p>
<p>Cultural traditions and belief systems may impede the uptake of a digital vaccine passport even if one is established.</p>
<p>If one has concerns over the implications for privacy of personal information or strongly detests government involvement in personal affairs, they may hesitate to apply for the vaccine passport.</p>
<h2>MOVING TOWARDS A GLOBAL STANDARD</h2>
<p>Moving toward a standardised digital vaccine passport at the global level is an urgent task, especially for countries like Singapore that depend so heavily on international trade. </p>
<p>A smooth travelling experience enabled by a vaccine passport standard will encourage more travel and more productive communication.</p>
<p>Several measures can increase the effective adoption of one. First, simplicity is key. </p>
<p>Second, while the standard must remain simple, the system needs to have a fair amount of modularity. </p>
<p>Each country should have space to ensure record-keeping and reporting, and present other countries’ governments with a highly convenient interface to convert their country's vaccine record to the common standard. </p>
<p>It should allow WeChat to develop a tool to let Chinese citizens convert their green codes to the global standard with one click for example.</p>
<p>Fourth, the standard promoter should start small with a few countries, demonstrate success, and quantify the impact in terms that make sense to governments around the world. </p>
<p>Advertising success of the standard will put pressure on other countries to adopt it. As more countries adopt the standard, positive network effects will occur. </p>
<p>The EU Digital COVID Certificate is a good start. For the 27 EU countries that have long shared the same currency, import tariff code and a variety of other economic standards, embracing a common vaccination certification is less controversial.</p>
<p>The trouble is extending this to countries outside of the bloc like Russia that not only have their own digital vaccine standards but also the Sputnik COVID-19 vaccine not recognised by the EU. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Countries must be prepared if further restrictions to curb Omicron variant needed in coming days </h1>
<div> <p>Besides epidemiology and vaccination studies, COVID-19 has taught us invaluable lessons on economic vulnerability, says a UK economist.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chris Giles </a> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: The shadow of the Omicron variant hangs over the global economy.</p>
<p>Most important is that when a serious virus is circulating, you cannot separate economics from epidemiology.</p>
<p>There is clearly a trade off between restrictions on normal daily life and short-term economic activity, but the underlying cause of both health and economic troubles is the severity of the epidemic. Controlling the virus is paramount.</p>
<p>Early and strict lockdowns were most successful in 2020 and operated well in much of Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>But this year, effective vaccines and treatments have allowed life to return closer to normal in Europe and the US, so long as countries could encourage and coerce sufficient numbers of people to be inoculated.</p>
<p>If the link between economics and epidemiology has been a case of learning by doing, pure economic policy in rich countries has been a triumph, underpinned by a welcome absence of ideology.</p>
<p>For these countries, “Build Back Better” is not a hollow slogan, but the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>Successful vaccination has transformed the outlook this year alongside skilful deployment of economic policy in rich countries. Fiscal support for people and companies affected by economic restrictions was rapid and generous.</p>
<p>In emerging economies, the lack of fiscal space prevented equivalent fiscal support and explains their worse performance and the current assessment that they will suffer lasting damage from the pandemic.</p>
<p>They were also initially lower down the pecking order to gain access to vaccines.</p>
<p>Rapid action by central banks to quell initial turmoil in financial markets and a willingness to enable governments to borrow and spend their way through the crisis with extensive purchases of assets also played an important role.</p>
<p>No one should get hung up on concerns that the taboo on monetising government debt has been broken, so long as the policies are temporary and they show willingness to prevent persistent inflationary pressure.</p>
<p>The return of inflation has been the most visible demonstration of a third lesson: fine-tuning the response to a crisis is impossible. With a huge surge in global demand for goods, higher prices became inevitable and almost impossible to avoid.</p>
<p>That price rises are more ingrained in the US, where wage inflation has risen higher, is a valuable reminder that resource constraints in economics are real. Governments cannot simply run economies at ever higher pressure without overheating.</p>
<p>This relates to the type of fiscal support offered during the pandemic and demonstrates important trade-offs.</p>
<p>European countries tied job support to employers, keeping workers attached to their jobs, but paid the price in terms of lower productivity and delays in ensuring new jobs were created in areas where demand and spending was high.</p>
<p>The US was better at reallocating employees to new jobs by attaching support to individuals rather than employers, but it came at the cost of finding that a much larger number fell out of the labour market altogether. </p>
<p>It is still too early to evaluate which will ultimately prove more successful.</p>
<p>With these lessons in mind, we can turn to the Omicron variant. The early evidence suggests it is much more transmissible than the Delta variant.</p>
<p>Countries need time to formulate policy, yet in South Africa and the UK, Omicron cases appear to be growing at extraordinary speed.</p>
<p>The lesson from earlier in the pandemic is to act fast rather than seek to optimise, so it is time for governments in rich countries to adopt the precautionary principle as well as accelerate vaccine boosters.</p>
<p>This means building on travel restrictions with the reintroduction of curbs on daily life while also preparing fiscal policy tools to spring back into life if further restrictions are needed in the coming days.</p>

<h1> Commentary: How the Delta variant that became dominant worldwide has lessons for Omicron </h1>
<div> <p>Researchers think mutations on the Delta variant contributed to its increased transmissibility and Omicron is the most heavily mutated variant so far, points out a US virologist.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Suresh V Kuchipudi </a> </div> </div>
<p>COLLEGE TOWN, Pennsylvania: A new variant named Omicron (B.1.1.529) was reported by researchers in South Africa on Nov 24, and designated a "variant of concern" by the World Health Organization two days later.</p>
<p>Omicron is very unusual in that it is by far <a>the most heavily mutated variant yet</a> of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>It is also the protein that all three vaccines currently available in the United States use to induce protective antibodies.</p>
<p>The larger number of mutations in the Omicron variant may mean that it could be more transmissible or better at evading immune protection - a prospect that is very concerning.</p>
<h2>EMERGENCE OF NEW VARIANTS NOT UNEXPECTED</h2>
<p>While the unusually high number of mutations in the Omicron variant is surprising, the emergence of yet another SARS-CoV-2 variant is not unexpected.</p>
<p>Does the Omicron variant's greater number of mutations mean it is more dangerous and transmissible than Delta? We simply don't know yet.</p>
<p>The conditions that led to the emergence of the variant are not yet clear, but what is clear is that the sheer number and configuration of mutations in Omicron is unusual.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for how viral variants with multiple mutations emerge is through prolonged infection in a patient whose immune system is suppressed - a situation that can lead to rapid viral evolution.</p>
<p>Researchers have hypothesised that some of the earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, such as the Alpha variant, may have stemmed from a persistently infected patient.</p>
<p>However, the unusual constellation and numerous mutations in the omicron variant make it very different from all other SARS-CoV-2 strains, which raises questions about how it came about.</p>
<p>Another possible source of variants could be through animal hosts. The virus that causes COVID-19 can infect several animal species, including mink, tigers, lions, cats and dogs.</p>
<p>In a study that is not yet peer-reviewed, an international team that I lead recently reported widespread infection by SARS-CoV-2 in free-living and captive white-tailed deer in the US.</p>
<p>Therefore, we also cannot rule out the possibility that the Omicron variant emerged in an animal host through rapid evolution.</p>
<h2>HOW THE DELTA VARIANT BECAME DOMINANT WORLDWIDE</h2>
<p>Delta is between 40 per cent and 60 per cent more transmissible than the Alpha variant and nearly twice as transmissible as the original SARS-CoV-2 virus first identified in China.</p>
<p>The Delta variant's heightened transmissibility is the primary reason why researchers believe it was able to outcompete other variants to become the dominant strain.</p>
<p>A key factor in viral fitness is its replication rate - or how quickly a virus can make more copies of itself.</p>
<p>The Delta variant replicates faster than previous SARS-CoV-2 variants, and a not-yet-peer-reviewed study estimated that it produces 1,000 times more virus particles than its predecessors.</p>
<p>In addition, people infected with the Delta variant are making and shedding more virus, which is another potential mechanism for its increased ability to spread.</p>
<p>Research suggests that a possible explanation for the Delta variant's heightened ability to replicate is that mutations in the spike protein led to more efficient binding of the spike protein to its host, via the ACE-2 receptor.</p>
<p>The Delta variant has also acquired mutations that would allow it to evade neutralising antibodies that serve a critical role in the body's defence against an invading virus.</p>
<p>Studies also show that people infected with the Delta variant have a higher risk of being hospitalised compared to those infected with the original SARS-CoV-2 and early variants.</p>
<p>One particular mutation on the spike protein of the Delta variant - the P681R mutation - is thought to be a key contributor to its improved ability to enter cells and to cause more severe disease.</p>
<h2>WILL OMICRON REPLACE DELTA?</h2>
<p>It is too early to say if the Omicron variant is fitter than Delta or if it will become dominant. Omicron shares some mutations with the Delta variant but also possesses others that are quite different.</p>
<p>Suppose the combination of all the mutations in Omicron makes it either more transmissible or better at immune evasion than Delta. In that case, we could see the spread of this variant globally.</p>
<p>However, it is also possible that the unusually high number of mutations could be detrimental to the virus and make it unstable.</p>
<p>The emergence of the Omicron variant is yet another reminder of the urgency to vaccinate to stop the further spread and evolution of SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Renewables are an expensive substitute for Indonesia’s coal dependence </h1>
<div> <p>Indonesia’s transition from coal won’t be easy, given its reliance on coal for cheap electricity and challenges to replacing it with renewables, says Norton Rose Fulbright’s Andrew Digges.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Andrew Digges </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Fossil fuels came under renewed scrutiny at the 26th Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC (COP26) in Glasgow last week. </p>
<p>Indonesia has come under increasing pressure to tackle its significant reliance on coal.</p>
<p>Economic development and poverty reduction remain the Indonesian government’s primary goals. A stable democracy of 270 million people with consistent economic growth, the country still has a significant portion of its population living in poverty.</p>
<p>Indonesia, the world’s largest thermal coal exporter, is also expanding coal mining and exports.</p>
<p>In fact, coal production surged 320 per cent from 2005 to 2019. Given high global coal prices and the influence of the Indonesian Coal Mining Association, it seems unlikely Indonesian mining and coal exports will diminish soon.</p>
<h2>INDONESIA’S RECENT PUSH TO DECARBONISE</h2>
<p>The government has ramped up its plans to reduce Indonesia’s reliance on coal in the lead-up to COP26.</p>
<p>In July, the government submitted an updated NDC, setting out renewed commitments to reduce GHG emissions and details of how it will do so. Various government representatives referred to Indonesia achieving “net-zero” by 2060.</p>
<p>In October, authorities released a new National Electricity Business Supply Plan for 2021 to 2030 (known as a RUPTL) that aims to achieve these commitments.</p>
<p>That same month, the government passed a new carbon tax to be applied to excessive GHG emissions from coal-fired power plants from April 2022, although at a relatively low rate of IDR30,000 (US$2.10) per tonne of CO2.</p>
<p>Indonesia plans to finalise a presidential decree on the economic value of carbon and develop a carbon trading mechanism by 2025.</p>
<h2>CHEAP POWER REMAINS IMPORTANT</h2>
<p>But the reality is that cheap power remains very important to Indonesia’s ongoing growth and coal remains a relatively cheap fuel, difficult to abandon.</p>
<p>The latest RUPTL, which sets out MEMR and PLN’s blueprint for new electricity-generating capacity in Indonesia, has inconsistencies with the updated NDC and earlier coal phase-out commitments.</p>
<p>PLN plans to add 40.6 GW of new generating capacity by 2030. The majority of the new capacity (51.6 per cent) is intended to come from renewable energy - a welcome increase from 29.6 per cent renewables in the previous RUPTL.</p>
<p>Many international financiers have said they will no longer support coal. President Xi Jinping announced in September that China would not build any new coal-fired power projects abroad.</p>
<p>Coal projects without a signed power purchase agreement and committed financing might never be built by the private sector</p>
<h4> <div>What substantive outcomes can the global climate conference COP26 produce? CNA's Jaime Ho finds out from Isabelle de Lovinfosse, who works for the British Government as the Head of Southeast Asia COP26 Strategy:</div> </h4>
<h2>CHALLENGES TO MOVING AWAY FROM COAL </h2>
<p>But many commentators, including the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, have expressed doubt over whether such novel technologies will be viable soon.</p>
<p>Second, Indonesia’s plan to decommission all coal-fired power means that electricity supply will need to come from other sources, especially renewable energy to replace coal, as laid out in the RUTPL. </p>
<p>However, despite substantial declines in renewable energy costs over the last decade, shifting towards renewables remains a challenge for PLN because “the price of environmentally friendly power generation technology is still high”. </p>
<p>Last, Indonesia also has relatively limited viable energy resources. Enveloping the equatorial zone, only a few locations have good offshore wind potential.</p>
<h2>LIMITS TO WHAT INDONESIA CAN ACHIEVE</h2>
<p>Given fiscal constraints and renewable resource restrictions, there are limits to how much Indonesia can achieve on decarbonisation. In that context, its declared commitments should be applauded and encouraged.</p>
<p>The success of Indonesia’s higher NDC objectives and decarbonisation plans depends heavily on two key factors.</p>
<p>First, it will require the imminent implementation of a regulatory and fiscal environment that is substantially more conducive to the development of renewable energy and stable transmission systems. </p>
<p>Second, it will need substantial financial and technological assistance from the international community.</p>
<p>Indonesia acknowledged the need for outside help. Last week at COP26, President Jokowi asked developed economies to contribute more funds and share technology in order for Indonesia to be able to ramp up its climate change efforts.</p>
<p>To tackle the climate change challenge facing us all, the international financial and technological communities must respond to Indonesia’s call for assistance to meet its goals.</p>

<h1> Commentary: How is Cambodia last to lock down yet among first few to reopen in Southeast Asia? </h1>
<div> <p>There are huge economic pressures for the kingdom to reopen after COVID-19-induced travel restrictions have had crushing effects on Cambodia’s tourism industry, says a Cambodia researcher.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Bradley J. Murg </a> </div> </div>
<p>PHNOM PENH: Cambodia is accelerating its re-opening to global trade and travel by lifting quarantine restrictions for fully vaccinated travellers with negative test results from Nov 15 – the first ASEAN country to do so.</p>
<p>On Nov 15, Phnom Penh residents woke up to the city’s notorious traffic congestion — something unseen since a February community event that saw the largest COVID-19 community outbreak in the country and led to strict lockdown measures in April..</p>
<p>As Europe confronts a fourth wave of COVID-19 while much of the world and Southeast Asia remains either closed to travel or with lengthy quarantine measures required, Cambodia’s re-opening might appear as something of a surprise.</p>
<h2>WELL EQUIPPED, WELL PREPARED</h2>
<p>First, by avoiding the COVID-19 community spread throughout 2020, Cambodia had invaluable time to prepare itself for the virus’ inevitable arrival. </p>
<p>It stockpiled masks and personal protective equipment through direct purchases by the government or supplies from donor states and organisations.</p>
<p>As this author observed during his fieldwork in mid-2020, local commune chiefs literally "opened the doors" and showed how well-stocked they were in the event of a community outbreak.</p>
<p>At the same time, a public education campaign helped to facilitate understanding of disease transmission and social distancing measures.</p>
<p>These factors certainly had a positive impact on the COVID-19 situation in Cambodia. But the primary factor behind the kingdom’s re-opening is the rapid, nationwide vaccination programme.</p>
<p>Two elements are essential here: The supply of vaccines and the capacity to deliver them. As of Nov 15, approximately 88 per cent of the entire Cambodian population has been vaccinated – ranking 6th globally and only behind Singapore in ASEAN.</p>
<p>Phnom Penh recently re-opened its third round booster shot campaign, and this initiative had been overwhelmingly completed by end-October.</p>
<p>Cambodia has received significant vaccine donations from China (6 million doses of Sinovac), the United Nations’ COVAX facility (AstraZeneca), the United States (1 million doses of Johnson Johnson), and others.</p>
<p>Cambodia’s long-term investment in capacity building for its ministries has clearly borne fruit — the kingdom was financially well-equipped to purchase significant supplies of vaccines.</p>
<p>Some have sought to frame Cambodia’s success as being simply derivative from Chinese support, but this misinterprets the realities on the ground and underestimates contemporary Cambodian state capacity.</p>
<p>Cambodia received the first delivery of 600,000 Chinese-donated Sinovac doses in early February and 324,000 doses from COVAX in early March.</p>
<p>By March 15, 1.5 million purchased Sinovac doses had arrived, and by mid-April, nearly 1 million Cambodian people had been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Cambodia is now at the stage where it is donating its surplus vaccine supply to other states, having provided 200,000 doses to neighbouring Vietnam in late October.</p>
<p>It will not be plain sailing, however. Testing, while widespread with rapid tests readily available and regularly utilised, has become unofficial in nature, yielding questions as to whether the kingdom’s caseload is as low as officially reported.</p>
<p>Only 52 new cases were reported on Nov 15, significantly below what most observers see as probable.</p>
<p>Additionally, one cannot ignore the economic pressure on the decision to re-open the kingdom.</p>
<p>Cambodia is in a very different place in terms of state capacity than just a decade ago. Its relative success at fighting COVID-19 should be recognised as it prepares to begin its role as ASEAN chair next year.</p>
<p>Yet, continued vigilance is needed, as the government notes in its establishment of new standard operating procedures for weddings, social gathering, and education.</p>
<p>For now, Cambodia hopes that its re-opening will reinvigorate its economy and provide a gentle nudge to fellow ASEAN members to move ahead with a regional travel bubble and green lane travel agreements. </p>
<p>Whether they will do so remains an open question.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Aung San Suu Kyi's charges show she has been an obstacle to Myanmar military’s interests </h1>
<div> <p>The State Administration Council's attempts to render Aung San Suu Kyi politically irrelevant might well have an obverse effect says ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute's Moe Thuzar.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Moe Thuzar </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: "All absurd", said Daw Aung San Suu Kyi when accused of corruption in October. </p>
<p>“Absurd” best describes the whole process of charges brought against her since February up to the recent verdict on Monday (Dec 6). </p>
<p>Within hours of this verdict, Aung San Suu Kyi’s four-year prison sentence for incitement and violating pandemic safety restrictions was commuted to a two-year house arrest. Still, it gives a foretaste of sentences yet to be meted out.</p>
<p>The State Administration Council (SAC) junta has slapped a total of 12 charges against her, with a potential combined prison term of more than 100 years.</p>
<p>This array of charges demonstrates the single-minded focus with which the SAC has attempted to discredit and delegitimise Aung San Suu Kyi’s political and popular standing.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> Aung San Suu Kyi down but Myanmar democracy movement not out, say analysts </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Days after the coup, the SAC-controlled legal system first charged her with "illegally" importing walkie-talkies, and violating the COVID-19 pandemic guidelines under the Natural Disaster Management law.</p>
<p>Two further charges called her out for incitement and possession of unlicensed communications equipment.</p>
<p>Among others, the junta used testimonies from former Yangon Chief Minister and Suu Kyi stalwart Phyo Min Thein and businessman Maung Weik, who is known to be close to military circles, to pile on at least four corruption charges.</p>
<p>The most serious charge to date is that of violating the Official Secrets Act, together with three of her ministers and economic advisor, Australian academic Sean Turnell.</p>
<p>A civilian filed an additional charge against her for violating COVID-19 restrictions. The SAC-appointed election commission has also accused Aung San Suu Kyi, senior NLD members, and the NLD-appointed election commission chair, of electoral fraud.</p>
<p>Aung San Suu Kyi’s trial — in a closed court — started in June, but hearings were suspended in July when a COVID-19 third wave swept through Myanmar. They resumed in September.</p>
<p>The Dec 6 verdict took place in the midst of an outcry over security forces mowing down unarmed protesters on Dec 5, killing at least five, in Yangon.</p>
<p>Min Aung Hlaing also visited another ailing former general, Khin Nyunt, who was military intelligence chief and, for a short while, prime minister in the State Peace and Development Council military regime until 2004.</p>
<p>The SAC’s attempt to show "magnanimity" in reducing the prison sentences of Aung San Suu Kyi and Win Myint does not fool anyone. </p>
<p>Since the 1962 coup, military authorities have suborned the country’s judiciary system to crush opponents and activists.</p>
<p>Even with her political career seemingly at an end, Aung San Suu Kyi provides a rallying point for many coup protestors, and a point of focus for regional and international interlocutors.</p>
<h2>INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE</h2>
<p>The international community is not buying any of the trumped-up charges. The United Nations, European Union and the United States have termed the verdict a "sham trial", "politically motivated" and "an affront to democracy", respectively.</p>
<p>ASEAN has not reacted to the verdict, but in October the grouping had made a historic move not to allow Min Aung Hlaing or a ministerial representative to the annual Summits. Outside Myanmar, the junta’s manoeuvring room is growing narrower.</p>
<p>Dealing with Aung San Suu Kyi continues to present a wicked problem for the junta. The SAC’s attempts to silence her with numerous and implausible legal charges have not silenced popular resistance to the coup.</p>
<p>In the end, restricting Aung San Suu Kyi — and access to her — will not help the SAC’s quest for legitimacy at home, and especially in the eyes of the international community.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Fumio Kishida’s leadership is looking impressive so far </h1>
<div> <p>The Japanese Prime Minister's party now enjoys a majority in the Diet. But questions linger over the his domestic agenda, says former Abe adviser Koichi Hamada.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Koichi Hamada </a> </div> </div>
<p>TOKYO: A month after becoming Japan’s 100th prime minister, Fumio Kishida has another reason to celebrate.</p>
<p>The question now is how Kishida will use this impressive result and what his leadership will mean for Japan.</p>
<p>Despite my long involvement with former prime minister Shinzo Abe’s government as an economic adviser, I do not recall having any personal conversation with Kishida.</p>
<p>But we have come across each other in government meetings and he always greeted me with a genuine smile and gesture. This points to a social and political aptitude that will serve him well as prime minister.</p>
<p>More concretely, Kishida leads Kochikai, an LDP policy group known for its relatively dovish foreign policy stance and strong focus on the economy. Kochikai was created in 1957 by prime minister Hayato Ikeda.</p>
<p>Ikeda’s predecessor, Nobusuke Kishi, Abe’s maternal grandfather, adopted the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan – at the time a controversial move which sent student protesters pouring into the streets.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it seems clear that the treaty helped enable Japan’s subsequent economic boom by reducing the defence spending burden. But it was Ikeda’s policies that made the biggest difference.</p>
<p>At the beginning of his tenure, he pledged that they would double Japan’s GDP within ten years. The promise was met with plenty of scepticism, but Ikeda made good on it – two years early.</p>
<h2>FOCUS ON ECONOMY, MODERATION IN FOREIGN POLICY</h2>
<p>South Korea’s government ultimately did not honor the agreement, owing to decisions taken by South Korean courts, but that cannot be blamed on Kishida.</p>
<p>Many take these visits for granted, but in fact, they showed significant wisdom and considerable grace.</p>
<p>Kishida also showed sincerity and composure in managing Japan’s challenging relationships with China and Russia.</p>
<h2>CAN KISHIDA SPUR GROWTH JAPAN NEEDS?</h2>
<p>But questions about Kishida’s agenda linger in Japan.</p>
<p>In Kishida’s view, the goal now must be to spur a “virtuous economic cycle” by “raising the incomes of not just a certain segment, but a broader range of people to trigger consumption”.</p>
<p>This objective – which harkens back to Ikeda’s motto, “to build a nation is to build people” – certainly has merit. But it is far easier said than done and Kishida has yet to articulate how he plans to deliver.</p>
<p>My second major concern about Kishida arises from his inaugural address to the Diet, in which he quoted a well-known proverb: “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”</p>
<p>The idea probably appealed to many listeners; Japanese, after all, are products of an education system that stifles individualism and rewards conformity.</p>
<p>But more individualism – and the economic innovation and dynamism it sustains – is exactly what Japan needs. Sometimes, people do need to “go alone”; that is what it means to be a trailblazer.</p>
<p>And, with the COVID-19 pandemic still raging, time is of the essence. Unless Japan recognises this – as China has – its economy will suffer.</p>
<p>Kishida also declared in his speech that he believes in “the latent power and vitality of the Japanese people”. To tap that power and vitality, however, his government will have to embrace – and encourage – individual initiative.</p>
<p>To be as constructive as prime minister as he was as foreign minister, Kishida will need to overcome bureaucratic resistance, like the meaningless claim for the short-term, primary budget balance during an emergency like COVID-19.</p>
<p>Most importantly, he should articulate his policy objectives and his strategy for achieving them. Unless he does, he is unlikely to remain in power for long.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Biden priorities in Asia don't bode well for North Korea's Kim Jong Un </h1>
<div> <p>Kim Jong Un's initiatives have stalled after floods, food shortages and a pandemic-induced lockdown, and time is not on his side, says a former CIA analyst.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Kent Harrington </a> </div> </div>
<p>ATLANTA, Georgia: Nearly three years after his failed "bromance" with Donald Trump, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un is once again angling for the United States' attention.</p>
<p>North Korea has tested a new, high-tech missile and hinted it may agree to restart talks with South Korea, where President Moon Jae-in desperately wants to resuscitate his moribund outreach to the North.</p>
<p>But if Kim is expecting a positive reaction from US President Joe Biden, he shouldn’t hold his breath. With issues like China and the rebuilding of US alliances topping Biden’s agenda, overtures to Kim are unlikely.</p>
<p>Kim’s dog-eared script is not helping his cause. The latest drama has unfolded all too predictably.</p>
<p>In Act One, Kim Yo Jong, his sister and the North’s spokesperson on North-South affairs, averred that the regime might be interested in discussing a peace treaty with South Korea – an idea that Moon himself had proposed in September.</p>
<p>She hastened to add, however, that South Korea will have to distance itself from US demands for nuclear disarmament and end joint military exercises with US forces.</p>
<p>Although the Biden administration had sent “signals that it is not hostile”, he declared that the North has “no reason to believe it”.</p>
<p>By challenging US credibility, Kim was all but asking the United States to respond, ideally by following its Korean ally’s lead and publicly throwing a bone his way.</p>
<h2>THE VICE OF NUCLEAR-RELATED ECONOMIC SANCTIONS</h2>
<p>But the newly slimmed-down Kim isn’t the only one reusing an old script. Moon’s offer to negotiate a peace treaty as a prelude to nuclear negotiations has been a perennial feature of North-South talks.</p>
<p>As if following Kim Yo Jong’s cue, Moon’s Democratic Party followers duly played their part by calling for a suspension of military exercises and other preconditions for negotiations.</p>
<p>As always, North Korea’s blandishments and bluster are geared toward only one goal: To loosen the vice of nuclear-related economic sanctions.</p>
<p>Despite making economic development his domestic priority five years ago, Kim has failed to improve basic living conditions in the country.</p>
<p>Battered by floods, food shortages and a pandemic-induced lockdown, his initiatives – market-based reforms, decentralised decision-making and more social investment – have stalled, tanking trade and economic growth.</p>
<p>Kim acknowledged as much at the party congress in January, emphasizing the need for “self-reliance” and explicitly sidelining reform.</p>
<h2>BIDEN'S ASIA PRIORITIES DIFFERENT FROM TRUMP</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for Kim, there is a new audience in the White House, and it is far tougher than the incumbents in Seoul.</p>
<p>Speaking before a joint session of Congress in April, Biden made clear that Kim should not expect the kind of pre-emptive concessions that Trump offered at the summits in Singapore in 2018 and Hanoi in 2019.</p>
<p>According to Biden, the US is prepared to talk anytime without preconditions about the peninsula’s denuclearisation, but there will be no mano-a-mano deal-making.</p>
<p>As Biden’s press secretary explained after his speech: “We have and will continue to consult with the Republic of Korea, Japan and other allies at every step along the way”.</p>
<p>For Kim, the implications of this reorganisation are obvious. While Trump was willing to backhand longstanding US allies for the sake of his summitry theatre, Biden insists on working closely with America’s partners.</p>
<h2>KIM JONG UN’S BEST HOPE IS CHINA</h2>
<p>Biden’s overarching focus on China, North Korea’s sole ally and source of economic support, also does not bode well for Kim. </p>
<p>But Chinese help with the North Korean nuclear issue has only ever been intermittent at best. </p>
<p>Because China does not want Korean refugees flooding over its border or a US ally in control of the entire Korean Peninsula, it still has an interest in limiting Kim’s provocations.</p>
<p>In any case, having China in his corner is probably the best that Kim can hope for in the next act of the drama. </p>
<p>By bolstering US allies and deepening mutual cooperation, America’s strategic commitment to Asia not only represents a bulwark against China’s own military ambitions; it also changes the balance of forces surrounding the Korean Peninsula.</p>
<p>For its part, Pyongyang would do well to consider these and other forthcoming strategic changes affecting the Korean Peninsula. </p>
<p>America’s Asian partners, with their strong economies, world-class technology and modern defence forces, are well prepared for the 21st century. Time is not on Kim’s side.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why do people still overwhelmingly pour money into real estate and properties? </h1>
<div> <p>Despite increasing popularity in new forms of investment, property remains the hoarder of two thirds of global net worth as housing prices soar, says the Financial Times' Rana Foroohar.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Rana Foroohar </a> </div> </div>
<p>NEW YORK CITY: Are real estate prices today the equivalent of bread prices? </p>
<p>It’s a question that was recently asked by a trade union leader in Germany, where there has been a push to seize corporate-owned rental units and put them in public ownership. </p>
<p>Many Dutch cities want to ban investors from buying cheap homes to rent out.</p>
<p>South Korea’s ruling party took a beating in mayoral elections for failing to stop a 90 per cent hike in the average price of a Seoul apartment.</p>
<p>China’s president Xi Jinping has made affordable housing a huge part of his common prosperity theme, saying that housing is “for living in, not speculation”.</p>
<p>The study, entitled The Rise and Rise of the Global Balance Sheet, looked at real assets, financial assets and liabilities held by households, governments, banks and non-financial corporations.</p>
<p>It found that two-thirds of net worth is stored in residential, corporate and government real estate as well as land. For all the talk of digitalisation, it seems that bricks and mortar are the new bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>How did this happen? And what are the implications?</p>
<h2>REAL ESTATE PRICES ON THE UPTICK</h2>
<p>The McKinsey study found a strong inverse correlation between net worth relative to gross domestic product and five-year rolling averages of nominal long-term interest rates.</p>
<p>The authors believe that declining interest rates have played a decisive role in lifting asset prices of all sorts, but particularly real estate prices.</p>
<p>Constrained land supply, zoning issues and over-regulated housing markets also helped push up values. The result is that home prices have tripled on average across the 10 countries.</p>
<p>Now, wealth and growth are completely disconnected. This is, of course, behind much of the populist anger in politics today.</p>
<p>Affordable housing in particular has become a rallying cry for millennials who can’t afford to buy homes and start families as early as a previous generation did.</p>
<p>Much of the disconnect between wealth and growth stems from too much money in real estate. But another aspect of the problem is that there’s just not enough money moving into more economically productive places.</p>
<p>While higher asset prices accounted for about three-quarters of the growth in net worth from US$150 trillion in 2000 to US$500 trillion in 2020, savings and investment made up only 28 per cent of the increase in balance sheets.</p>
<p>Given that investments such as infrastructure, industrial equipment, machinery and intangibles are what actually drive productivity and innovation, that’s very bad news.</p>
<p>With the exception of China and Japan, non-real estate assets made up a lower share of total real assets in the 10 countries today than 20 years ago.</p>
<p>What’s more, despite the fact that digital trade and information flows have grown exponentially over that time, intangibles are a mere 4 per cent of net worth.</p>
<p>This may be because, as the authors observe, “for their mostly corporate owners, the value of intangible assets is assumed to decline rapidly due to obsolescence and competition, even if their value to society may have a much longer shelf life”.</p>
<p>Still, for all the talk of blockchain, cryptocurrency and big data, it’s rather amazing that most 21st century wealth still lives in the oldest asset class of all: Bricks and mortar. What lessons should we take from this?</p>
<p>First, it seems increasingly clear that low interest rates haven’t done much for business investment.</p>
<p>Second, and more encouragingly, the big government spending programmes of the post-COVID-19 era present a new opportunity to try and push money into more productive sectors, which could ultimately bring wealth and growth back into alignment.</p>
<p>Third, affordable housing is the most pressing economic issue of the moment. Technology-driven mobility and increasing work flexibility in the post-pandemic era may ease some of the pressure.</p>
<p>Only by fixing housing can we rebalance our global ledger.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Australia's new visa programme spooks Malaysia </h1>
<div> <p>Malaysia is facing its own agricultural workforce crisis and plans to replace foreign plantation workers with local labour, and Australia's schemes complicates things, says this observer.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> M Niaz Asadullah </a> </div> </div>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR: COVID-19 has disrupted labour markets around the world, causing a global manpower shortage. </p>
<p>Lockdowns in the early months of the pandemic triggered an exodus of millions of rural migrant workers from booming megacities like New Delhi and Dhaka.</p>
<p>In the global north, the United Kingdom has experienced the largest decline in its foreign-born labour force since World War II.</p>
<p>Countries in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) also have been affected: Vietnam's labour shortage recently worsened after the easing of travel restrictions in Ho Chi Minh City led to a large outflow of migrant workers.</p>
<p>Moreover, some high-income countries are trying to lure back foreign workers from emerging Asia as part of their national recovery plans, creating new challenges for the global governance of labour migration.</p>
<p>In particular, ASEAN economies like Singapore and Malaysia that have large migrant labour flows now face a tricky choice: Should they curb outward migration or encourage greater labour mobility?</p>
<p>This dilemma has come to the fore in Malaysia following the Australian government's recent announcement of a visa scheme for ASEAN agricultural workers.</p>
<p>Under this programme - a response to Australia's own shortage of farm labour - employers will sponsor farm workers from ASEAN countries, subject to a formal employment contract that complies with specified standards and obligations.</p>
<p>But Malaysia's recently-elected government initially ruled out the country's participation in the Australian scheme, causing an uproar in the local media.</p>
<p>After opposition MPs demanded that the decision be reversed, the senior human resources minister issued a statement saying that the government has no plans to restrict overseas migration by Malaysians for employment purposes.</p>
<h2>MALAYSIA GOVERNMENT'S CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
<p>And because the Australian programme offers a possible route for ASEAN nationals to secure permanent residency and citizenship, the government is worried about losing key agricultural workers.</p>
<p>Lastly, Malaysia's farmers are ageing rapidly, creating an agricultural workforce crisis similar to that in Australia, but young Malaysians are reluctant to work in the sector owing to its unattractive pay and conditions.</p>
<p>Whether countries like Malaysia benefit or lose out from labour migration to advanced economies depends on the institutional arrangements governing labour mobility. </p>
<p>Work-related migration from ASEAN countries to Australia is not a new phenomenon. But in the past, many migrant workers - especially from Malaysia - lived in the country illegally, making them vulnerable to exploitation and abuse by employers.</p>
<p>Australia's new programme will ensure that foreign nationals have full labour rights and access to social protection provisions.</p>
<p>Malaysian MP William Leong therefore warned that the government's opposition to the scheme would leave Malaysians working in slave-like conditions in Australia.</p>
<h2>FROM BRAIN DRAIN TO BRAIN GAIN?</h2>
<p>For ASEAN source countries, the Australian programme will also increase the potential for brain gain, provided that it contains the right mechanisms to ensure reverse migration.</p>
<p>Building a critical mass of Malaysian farmers with overseas experience and technological know-how in areas such as precision agriculture can be crucial to ongoing efforts to boost productivity in the country's farm sector.</p>
<p>The Malaysian government's recent flip-flop on migration control policy also highlights a deeper structural challenge: The lack of a political consensus regarding the country's own large population of migrant workers.</p>
<p>Malaysia is a major destination for migrants in Southeast Asia, and millions of undocumented foreign workers are allegedly in the country.</p>
<p>Yet, soon after declaring its opposition to the Australian visa scheme, the government announced that thousands of low-skilled workers from Indonesia and Bangladesh would soon arrive in Malaysia to take up plantation jobs.</p>
<p>Senior officials justified the decision on the grounds that Malaysians are unwilling to enter the sector because of its unfavourable working conditions.</p>
<p>The United States government late last year banned imports from Malaysia's Sime Darby Plantation, one of the world's largest palm oil producers, citing concerns about the use of forced labour.</p>
<p>Malaysian policymakers therefore need to shift from short-term coercive measures such as migration controls to long-term remedies for the country's poor labour standards and low agricultural productivity.</p>
<p>Most of the country's farmers are in the bottom 40 per cent of the income distribution, and many live in poverty. Moreover, a significant share of employers are not complying with the country's minimum wage legislation.</p>
<p>Scaling up technology adoption in agriculture should be another long-term priority. Taiwan's early investment in precision agriculture, for example, reduced its farm sector's dependence on labour.</p>
<p>While the introduction of commercial drones by some of Malaysia's palm oil plantations has already yielded positive results, adoption of such technologies is far from universal.</p>
<p>Addressing these wage and productivity issues will go a long way toward stemming Malaysia's brain drain and encouraging skilled Malaysians working overseas to return home.</p>
<p>Malaysia has just taken up a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council. Instead of curbing citizens' freedom to work abroad, the government should focus on improving labour standards at home.</p>

<h1> Commentary: South Korea prepared to ease COVID-19 rules. Then Halloween parties happened. </h1>
<div> <p>South Korea authorities are coming under pressure to keep the economy open after an uptick in cases. They’ll need some gumption to press on with plans to live endemically with COVID-19, says Steven Borowiec.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Steven Borowiec </a> </div> </div>
<p>SEOUL: This year, Halloween in South Korea was scary for reasons that have nothing to do with ghosts or goblins.</p>
<p>Falling on a Sunday, the Oct 31 holiday was celebrated on a Saturday night -- perfect timing for Halloween parties.</p>
<p>While South Korea doesn’t follow the custom of kids in costume going door-to-door trick-or-treating, the nightlife districts of big cities tend to swell late into the night with boozing revellers.</p>
<h2>HALLOWEEN PARTY-GOERS MAY THROW NEW SPANNER IN THE WORKS</h2>
<a>getting back to normal life</a>.
<p>For a population that, while never having endured a full-blown lockdown, had lived under some level of restrictions for well over a year and a half, the news was a welcome relief, a glimmer at the end of a long, lonely tunnel.</p>
<p>This new era started on Monday (Nov 1). Among the changes would be a lifting of limits on the hours of operations at bars, restaurants and indoor sports facilities.</p>
<p>Groups of up to ten people are now permitted to dine together at restaurants, provided at least six are fully vaccinated. More spectators are allowed to attend sporting events and late-night subways and buses would get back on normal schedule.</p>
<p>But dressed-up revellers congregating in bars and clubs over the Halloween weekend threatened to throw a wrench in these plans.</p>
<p>The Halloween weekend also conjured bad memories of previous pandemic inflection points in South Korea tied to large gatherings.</p>
<p>In May 2020, an outbreak tied to the party district of Itaewon, where the most raucous Halloween parties were held this year, led to a large cluster infection.</p>
<h2>GROWING NUMBER OF INFECTIONS</h2>
<p>As of Wednesday, a few days after the events of Saturday, when symptoms of coronavirus would have presented and people would have a chance to get tested, the number of new infections are a cause for concern but not alarm.</p>
<p>That morning, public health authorities announced 2,667 new cases of COVID-19, an increase of more than 1,000 from the previous day and the highest figure since September.</p>
<p>Authorities said they expect to discover more cluster infections tied to the preceding weekend’s festivities. Thursday saw a continuation of that trend with 2,482 new cases and a 10-month high of 24 deaths.</p>
<p>Would the spike in infections mean policymakers should U-turn on plans to gradually lift social distancing measures?</p>
<p>At this point in the pandemic, with the economic wreckage arising from social distancing piling up, policymakers are coming under great pressure to stay open.</p>
<p>Many more managed to keep afloat while desperately waiting for rules to lift so they can operate at full capacity, while carrying on with measures like restraining numbers and logging customers’ QR codes for contact tracing.</p>
<p>The new protocols do have emergency stipulations where strict distancing will come back into effect if daily cases breach the 5,000 mark. So far the highest mark ever in the country was 3,273 on Sep 25.</p>
<p>Experts say there is little chance that will happen, especially considering how many more people are vaccinated now, when infection numbers have stayed relatively subdued, never exceeding 5,000 new infections.</p>
<h2>HICCUPS TO LIVING WITH ENDEMIC COVID-19</h2>
<p>The Halloween tremour will wane before long and the benefits of resuming normal life will become apparent, the thinking goes.</p>
<p>The sense in South Korea that protecting people from COVID-19 came at a high price. With vaccinations and safety measures in place, people are hoping for a semblance of normality.</p>
<p>With Friday showing a slightly moderating number of 2,344 new infections and 20 deaths, let’s all hope Halloween didn’t endanger that.</p>
