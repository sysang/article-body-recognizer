<h2> The Roots of Attraction </h2>
<div> <article> </article> </div>
<div> <h3> What makes me sexually attracted to someone? </h3> </div>
<a>sexually attracted to us</a>; playing hard to get it turns out, is less of an attractor than many people imagine.
<div> <h3> How do I know if someone is attracted to me? </h3> </div>
<a>nonsexual arousal</a> can be confused for sexual arousal in the phenomenon called misattribution of arousal, such as when people cross a scary bridge or ride a roller-coaster together and confuse their feelings of nonsexual arousal for sexual arousal.
<div> <h3> Do partners tend to be equally physically attractive? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does sex spark relationships, or do relationships lead to sex? </h3> </div>
<a>sexual attraction generates caring</a> about a partner’s overall well-being and a deeper emotional connection, even before they have sex.
<div> <h3> Do our genes affect sexual attraction? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What attracts people to certain faces? </h3> </div>
<a>symmetrical faces</a>. This may be driven by perceived evolutionary advantage: A symmetrical face appears less flawed, and other research shows that a symmetrical face tends to correlate with better health overall.
<div> <h3> Why do people misperceive other’s sexual interest in them? </h3> </div>
<h2> Fantasies and Turn-ons </h2>
<div> <h3> Should partners try to satisfy each other’s sexual turn-ons? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is intelligence a turn-on? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Do partners become less turned on by each other over time? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is doing housework a turn-on? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Which sexual fantasies are the most common? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Should partners share their sexual fantasies? </h3> </div>
<a>most sexual fantasies are commonly held</a>, even if people rarely speak about them, and that having a fantasy does not mean one actually wants to act it out with their partner.
<a>Sharing sexual fantasies</a> without pressuring a partner to enact them can bring a couple closer together.
<div> <h3> Do most people act on their sexual fantasies? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How rare is unconventional sex? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is BDSM a sexual orientation? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are BDSM relationships psychologically healthy? </h3> </div>
<a>committed BDSM relationships</a> are at least as fulfilling as other romantic connections because they by definition require communication, agreement, trust, and intimacy, all key elements of healthy sexual partnerships.
<div> Discrepant sexual desire is one of the most common reasons couples enter sex therapy. While distressing, research finds that much can be done to bridge the gap in healthy ways. </div>
