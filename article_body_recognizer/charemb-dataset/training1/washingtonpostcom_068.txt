<div><h1>The Statue of Liberty was created to celebrate freed slaves, not immigrants, its new museum recounts</h1></div>
<h2>Lady Liberty was inspired by the end of the Civil War and emancipation. The connection to immigration came later.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Gillian Brockell</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>May 23, 2019</div></div>
<div><p>Trump adviser Stephen Miller was right about the Statue of Liberty's famous inscription</p></div>
<a>Enlightening the World: The Creation of the Statue of Liberty</a>.”
<div><div><p>In June 1865, Laboulaye organized a meeting of French abolitionists at his summer home in Versailles, Berenson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They talked about the idea of creating some kind of commemorative gift that would recognize the importance of the liberation of the slaves,” Berenson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>(A terra cotta model still survives at the Museum of the City of New York.)</p></div></div>
<a>theory</a> has her face being adapted from a statue Bartholdi had proposed for the Suez Canal, meaning her visage could resemble that of an Egyptian woman. The
<a>Times</a> reported she was based on the Roman goddess Libertas, who typically wore the type of cap worn by freed Roman slaves.
<div><p>In the final model, Lady Liberty holds a tablet inscribed with the Roman numerals for July 4, 1776. The broken chains are still there though, beneath her feet, “but they’re not all that visible,” Berenson said.</p></div>
<a>National Park Service</a>. And sailing into New York Harbor, he spotted the perfect location for it: Bedloe’s Island, then occupied by the crumbling Fort Wood.
<div><div><p>By then, “the original meaning of the abolition of slavery had pretty much gotten lost,” Berenson said, going unmentioned in newspaper coverage.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In fact, black newspapers railed against it as meaningless and hypocritical. By 1886, Reconstruction had been crushed, the Supreme Court had rolled back civil rights protections, and Jim Crow laws were tightening their grip.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There were immigrants on board that ship with Du Bois, but he didn’t talk to any of them. The ship was segregated.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>The Lincoln Memorial as a pyramid? That wasn’t the craziest idea pitched a century ago.</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>How statues of Robert E. Lee and other Confederates got into the U.S. Capitol</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Whether she’s on the $20 bill or not, Harriet Tubman made men pay for underestimating her</a></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>She was captured and enslaved 400 years ago. Now Angela symbolizes a brutal history.</a></p></div></div>

<div><div><p>She’s already returned to Auschwitz four times, and that’s enough.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Friedman Grosman grew up in the village of Hummené, Slovakia, with her parents and older sister, Lea.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Slovakia joined the Axis powers in 1940. Soon, Edith was forced to leave the public high school, and her dad had to sell his glass-cutting business to a Christian, whom he then worked for.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even amid the Jewish crackdown, it was still a surprise when the town crier announced a new order — all unmarried women 15 and older were to report to the school gymnasium in two weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But who ordered that first transport? And why take girls?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My sense is that it was [Heinrich] Himmler, but the Slovak government was certainly party to it,” Macadam told The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The parents, of course, [were] duped,” Macadam said. But “this was a patriarchal society, and you’re more likely to give up your daughter than your son.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Polish hero who volunteered to go to Auschwitz — and warned the world about the Nazi death machine</p></div>
<p>Most of them died that first year — of starvation, disease, beatings, medical experiments and suicide. Friedman Grosman’s sister was sent to a gas chamber after she caught typhus. More than 77 years later, her grief is still deep.</p>
<div><div><p>“I saw her there almost dead, and the rats were visiting her,” Friedman Grosman said through tears. “She was a beautiful girl. And nothing is left over of her.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When the sun rose the next morning, they realized they were free — and that the shelter where they sought refuge was an apiary full of bees.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Like many Holocaust survivors, particularly female survivors, Friedman Grosman didn’t talk about the horrors she experienced for a long time, and the significance of the first transport was largely forgotten.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If you look at a lot of Holocaust timelines, they mention the date the first [Jewish] transport arrived, but they almost never say that it was all young women,” Macadam said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nowadays, “Edith is a rock star in Slovakia. Everybody adores her,” when she returns to teach people about the Holocaust, Macadam said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Her career stalled after her 1945 marriage to Dick Barker, a World War II pilot who took her back to his family’s chicken farm in Ohio. She later called the experience “a nightmare.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Marianna Sotomayor</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Paul Kane</div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 5:54 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div>Correction</div><p> Correction: A previous version of this article misspelled the name of Richard B. Cheney’s old company. It is Halliburton, not Haliburton. </p></div>
<div><div><p>Former vice president Richard B. Cheney visited the House floor on Thursday and patiently waited to greet more than a dozen members waiting to shake his hand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They were all Democrats.</p></div></div>
<p>Cheney and his daughter Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) are among the few Republicans who have joined Democrats in condemning last year’s attack on the Capitol as an assault on Democracy and blaming former president Donald Trump for that deadly day.</p>
<div><div><p>They were the only two Republicans on the House floor Thursday for an event to mark the anniversary of the attack, but they were hardly alone.</p></div></div>
<p>One by one, Democrats put aside their fierce and lasting policy divides with the Cheneys to thank them for condemning the attack and Trump’s continued effort to undermine the 2020 presidential election results with his false claims of fraud.</p>
<div><div><p>“It was great coming back. I think Liz is doing a hell of a job, and I’m here to support her,” Cheney told reporters upon leaving the House floor.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Asked to reflect on Republican leaders’ decision not to show up on Thursday to mark the anniversary of the attack, Cheney said he could no longer recognize the party he helped lead as House minority whip and then vice president.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Neither Cheney has moderated their positions on any number of conservative issues they have held over the years, but their determination to take on Trump and call out fellow Republicans is more than enough for Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Liz Cheney was in the chamber during the insurrection and became one of the only House Republicans to pointedly blame Trump for instigating the most violent attack on the Capitol since British forces set it on fire in 1814.</p></div></div>
<div><p>House Republicans oust Cheney for calling out Trump’s false election claims, minimize Jan. 6 attack on Capitol</p></div>
<div><div><p>When Dick Cheney left office in 2009, it was hard to imagine what would cause him to be rejected by Republicans and embraced by Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During his time as vice president, his relationship with Democrats was marked by bitter disagreements, particularly over the Iraq War, that often went beyond policy disagreements and into questions of character and patriotism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pelosi and Cheney had an acrimonious relationship of their own.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney said in 2007 that if Pelosi was successful at preventing a U.S. troop increase in Iraq it would “validate the al-Qaeda strategy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pelosi demanded an apology, saying Cheney had questioned her patriotism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He declined and said he didn’t question her patriotism, just her judgment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s what I believe,” she told CNN. “I think he’s proud of it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, those old tensions were put aside as they focused on their shared feelings about Jan. 6.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) also applauded Cheney for his daughter’s courage during a lengthier conversation in which both men were overheard talking about other news of day such as testing frequently for the coronavirus.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Back in 2004, at a time when Sen. Patrick J. Leahy and other Democrats accused Cheney’s old company, Halliburton, of profiting off the Iraq War, the Vermont Democrat approached the vice president on the Senate floor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Hey Dick,” Leahy recalled saying in an interview Thursday, “why don’t you talk to the Democratic side?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney wasn’t amused.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“F--- yourself,” he told Leahy before complaining about the Democrat’s recent comments about him.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Cheney dismisses critic with obscenity</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>But like for many Democrats, Dick Cheney’s public support for his daughter’s outspoken anti-Trump vows has softened Leahy’s feelings toward the elder Cheney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said that the younger Cheney’s actions remind him of the stories he heard when he first arrived in Washington in 1975.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They thought it was a thing they had to do,” said Leahy, who watched Liz Cheney’s media appearances Thursday morning. “And that’s what I was thinking of, more than anything else.”</p></div></div>

<p>The portrayal of Petra as a shoplifting immigrant fearful of deportation was a “caricature of a Ukrainian woman,” Tkachenko said in a post on the Telegram platform, calling it “unacceptable” and “offensive.”</p>
<div><div><p>“Will Ukrainians be seen as such abroad?” he wrote. “That should not be the case.”</p></div></div>
