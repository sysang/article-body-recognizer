<h1>Why Time tapped Elon Musk, master inventor and quirky zillionaire</h1>
<p><a>Elon Musk</a> sounds like a pretty bad dude:</p>
<a>China</a> required cozying up to its repressive autocrats."
<p>So naturally, let’s make him Time’s <a>Person of the Year</a>!</p>
<p><a>SHOWDOWN BETWEEN MEADOWS, HOUSE CAPTURES DC’S DYSFUNCTIONAL CULTURE</a></p>
<p>No one can accuse Time of rolling over for its pick.</p>
<p>More from the Time piece on the world’s richest man: </p>
<p>Time has some mumbo-jumbo about how we’re in a brave new world and the mercurial Musk somehow matches the post-pandemic moment. All righty.</p>
<div> <div><p> The Tesla Model S Plaid is the automaker's new top model. (Tesla)</p></div></div>
<p>But it has to be acknowledged that his rocket company reinvigorated <a>space travel</a>, pioneering the reusable rocket, before <a>Jeff Bezos</a> and Richard Branson got into the game.</p>
<p>And while Tesla remains a high-end luxury product, its battery-powered technology could help pave the way in reducing global warming.</p>
<p><a><u>SUBSCRIBE TO HOWIE'S MEDIA BUZZMETER PODCAST, A RIFF OF THE DAY'S HOTTEST STORIES</u></a></p>
<p>But his tweets have also run afoul of federal laws. The SEC sued Musk for securities fraud three years ago after he tweeted he had enough backing to take his company private, forcing him to give up his role as the chairman of Tesla’s board.</p>

<p>Not every venture is a sure-fire rocket success. His plan to build deep underground tunnels for fast underground transit hasn’t gone very far in the last five years. </p>
<p>And then there are those 17 crashes since 2018 with Tesla’s auto-driving system, including one death. I’m personally skeptical that any company is going to perfect autonomous driving any time soon.</p>
<p>But you can see why Musk makes for colorful copy, which proved irresistible to Time.</p>
<p>Besides, who else was the magazine going to pick, other than some group selection like America’s Vaccine Makers?</p>
<p><a>Joe Biden</a> got the nod last year (along with Kamala Harris). No way Time was going to pick <a>Donald Trump</a>, even with the caveat that the choice is about impact, good or bad.</p>

<h1>Pandemic fatigue defies virus deaths for those aching for normalcy</h1>
<p>When it comes to <a>COVID</a>, says one writer for The Atlantic, "no one cares" anymore.</p>
<p>"The United States stands on the cusp of surpassing 800,000 deaths from the virus," <a>says The New York Times</a>, and one of every 100 Americans over age 65 has died from the disease.</p>
<p>As the pandemic we all despise approaches its second anniversary, we are awash in mixed messages: It’s just about over. It’ll never be over. It’s time to stop fearing the virus. We must never let our guard down.</p>
<p>What’s striking is that this cognitive dissonance, this dual universe, is much deeper than the vaxxers-vs.-non-vaxxers debate that has dominated much of our discourse.</p>
<p><a>WHY TIME TAPPED ELON MUSK, MASTER INVENTOR AND QUIRKY ZILLIONAIRE</a></p>
<p>It’s about how we live our lives.</p>
<a>health</a> and circumstances, on how much risk they’re willing to tolerate.

<a>mental health</a> consequences of perpetual restrictions. Luckily, we have moved beyond the era of lockdowns, but many folks are still pushing back against vax mandates and mask rules.
<p>Matthew Walther, who lives in a rural region of southwest <a>Michigan</a>, writes in <a>The Atlantic</a> that no one in his area cares about COVID anymore. </p>
<p>"Outside the world inhabited by the professional and managerial classes in a handful of major metropolitan areas," he says, "many, if not most, Americans are leading their lives as if COVID is over, and they have been for a long while."</p>
<p>And yet he acknowledges that the average number of new cases in his county is as high as it’s ever been, with 136 deaths attributed to the virus since June 2020. Still, Walther makes the "real America" argument:</p>
<a>media</a> and elite institutions, who are still genuinely concerned about this virus. And in some senses my situation has always been more in line with the typical American’s pandemic experience than that of someone in
<p>Plus, we know from long experience that less-populated states and regions have also been hit hard by the pandemic in the past, putting a great strain on hospital resources.</p>
<p>In a second Atlantic piece, Christian Paz says that Generation Z is also <a>blowing off COVID</a> restrictions because, well, they’ve just had enough:</p>
<p>"They’re once again learning and working in-person; they’re dining, drinking, and dancing indoors; they’re traveling and celebrating birthdays and <a>holidays</a>; and they don’t have plans to stop anytime soon—Omicron variant be damned."</p>
<div> <div><p> A doctor injects a patient with a coronavirus vaccine. (iStock)</p></div></div>
<p>What’s more, many Gen Z’ers are embracing life — especially if they’re vaccinated — and sort of tuning out:</p>
<p>I can certainly understand how having a year or more of college reduced to remote learning really upended their lives. And I get that younger and healthier people feel less jeopardized if they do happen to contract the virus.</p>

<h1>State Department says 'too soon to tell' if progress made in latest Iran nuclear talks</h1>
<h2>Officials accuse Iran of 'dragging its feet' in negotiations while bolstering nuclear program</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>The State Department on Tuesday said it was "too soon to tell" if any progress had been made in restoring the 2015 Iran nuclear deal as talks continue with <a>Tehran</a>.</p>
<p>The eighth round of indirect talks with Iran began Monday in Vienna, in an attempt to salvage the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and reestablish mutual compliance with the nuclear deal.</p>
<p><a>BIDEN ADMIN'S IRAN NUCLEAR TALKS 'NOT GOING WELL,' NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER SAYS</a></p>

<p>Iran has refused to engage with U.S. officials directly following the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the agreement in 2018. </p>
<p>Talks were stonewalled for months following the June election of anti-Western President Ebrahim Raisi, before again resuming in late November.</p>
<p>State Department press secretary Ned Price told reporters Tuesday that there "may have been some modest progress" during the course of the last round of talks that concluded a week before Christmas.</p>
<p>"But it is in some ways too soon to say how substantive that progress may have been," he continued. "At a minimum, any progress, we believe, is falling short of Iran’s accelerating nuclear steps and is far too slow."</p>
<p>"This can’t continue, or it will soon be too late to return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA," he added. </p>
<p><a>BIDEN TOLD TEAM TO 'BE PREPARED' FOR FAILED NUCLEAR TALKS WITH IRAN: PSAKI</a></p>
<p>Following the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, the Trump administration enforced sanctions on Iran and claimed it was not abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal.</p>
<p>The remaining member nations tied to the deal, including Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union, advised the U.S. against such action and argued it would weaken the deal.</p>

<p>Iran proceeded to further negate the terms of the JCPOA by advancing its nuclear capabilities while simultaneously blocking international access to its program.</p>
<p>U.S. sanctions are at the crux of the negotiating woes as Tehran has unequivocally called for all sanctions placed on Iran during the Trump administration to be revoked. </p>
<p>But given Iran’s nuclear advancement, the Biden administration has not yet agreed to lift any sanctions. </p>
<p>"The fundamental position as of today has not changed," Price said. "Iran has at best been dragging its feet in the talks while accelerating its nuclear escalations."</p>
<p>Price said the U.S. was now assessing terms laid out in December’s negotiations and said the U.S. still believes mutual compliance with the JCPOA can be "quickly" realized "if Iran is serious."</p>
<div> <div><p> State Department spokesman Ned Price speaks during a press briefing at the State Department in Washington, DC, on February 9, 2021. (AP)</p></div></div>
<p>"But we have not yet seen sufficient urgency demonstrated by Iran," he said pointing to Iran’s "vague, unrealistic, unconstructive positions" laid out in previous talks. </p>
<p>It is unclear how many more rounds of talks JCPOA member nations will engage in or if a deal can even be struck, but world leaders have routinely warned time is running out.</p>

<h1>Trump endorses Alaska Gov. Dunleavy for reelection — as long as he doesn't back Sen. Murkowski</h1>
<h2>Trump has already endorsed Murkowski's GOP primary challenger</h2>
<a>Alaska</a> Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, but his endorsement hinges on whether the governor backs one of Trump's most vocal Republican critics in the
<a>statement</a> through his Save America PAC. "I was proud to endorse his first run for Governor, and I am proud to support his reelection, too. Alaska needs Mike Dunleavy as Governor now more than ever."

<p>"In other words, if Mike endorses her, which is his prerogative, my endorsement of him is null and void, and of no further force or effect," Trump added.</p>
<p>Murkowski announced her reelection campaign in November, but she faces an uphill battle among Republicans in the state over her handling of Trump impeachment efforts and her positions on some issues.</p>
<a>scheduled</a> to hold a fundraiser for her in February at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
<p>Murkowski was controversially appointed to the U.S. Senate in late 2002 by her father, Frank, who had just resigned from his Senate seat after being elected governor.</p>
<p>Fox News reached out to Dunleavy for comment but did not receive an immediate response.</p>

<h1>Jayapal urges Biden to take executive action to deliver Build Back Better for Americans</h1>
<h2>Biden’s social spending plan was dealt a serious blow last weekend when Sen. Joe Manchin announced that he is a 'no' on the social spending bill</h2>
<h4><a>Sen. Ben Cardin on Democrats pushing Build Back Better: 'We need to get something done'</a></h4>
<p>Sen. Ben Cardin, D-M.D., joined 'Fox News Sunday' to express his optimism in passing the bill, arguing they need to 'find the sweet spot' to advance it.</p>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<a>dealt a serious blow</a> last weekend when
<a>Sen. Joe Manchin</a> announced on "Fox News Sunday" that he is a "no" on the social spending bill. The Senate is evenly divided 50-50 and the Biden administration cannot afford to lose one vote on the legislation.
<p>The progressive push for Biden's $1.75 trillion comes as the U.S. faces a national debt of $29.4 trillion, while running a $2.8 trillion deficit in fiscal year 2021.</p>

<p>Her criticism comes after Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, called Manchin’s announcement last week "a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position" and "a breach of his commitments" to Biden and congressional Democrats. </p>
<p>She pointedly said that Manchin, whose state is among the nation’s poorest, "will have to explain" why many families will have to cope with higher health and child care costs the bill is intended to address</p>
<p>Kevin Walling is a Democratic campaign strategist,<a> wrote on FoxNews.com</a> that the Biden administration should work with House and Senate progressives to explore various executive actions that can build on that framework."</p>
<p>"All of this is possible with continued hands-on leadership from President Biden and Democrats working together across ideologies to deliver critical resources for the American people," he wrote.</p>

<h1>Balanced budget amendment needed to get US fiscal house in order</h1>
<h2>Neither Democrats nor Republicans have the discipline to regularly balance the budget</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>This Build Back Better spending bill is dead forever: Sen. Graham</a></h4> <p>Sen. Lindsey Graham joins ‘Hannity’ to discuss Biden’s reckless spending bill and the future of the bill.</p></div></div>
<p>The United States is now running trillion-dollar deficits each and every year, and the U.S. national debt is closing in on $30 trillion. </p>
<p>That amount of debt equals almost <a>$230,000 per taxpayer</a>. In 1960, the debt to GDP ratio was around 54%. Now, it is 125%. </p>
<p>As much as I oppose the <a>Democrats current spending plan</a>, called Build Back Better, I also acknowledge that Republicans through the years have not done a great job in getting our nation’s fiscal house in order either. </p>
<p><a> MANCHIN IS RIGHT, THE INFLATION TAX IS REAL. IT'S TIME TO STOP BIDEN'S BUILD BACK BETTER</a></p>
<p>I have long been convinced that neither Democrats nor Republicans have the discipline to regularly balance the budget. Special-interest politics on the left and right make it tough to get our fiscal house in order. </p>
<p>What rational person thinks Congress will ever do the hard things required to balance our budget? We have only accomplished that objective a handful of times in the last 50 years. </p>
<p>With our national debt nearing $30 trillion, it is clear that there is a structural problem that must be addressed. That is why we need to again push for passing a Balanced Budget Amendment (BBA) to the Constitution. </p>
<blockquote><p>A balanced budget constitutional amendment provides the best hope of regaining and maintaining fiscal sanity.</p> </blockquote>
<p>A BBA will force Congress to balance its budget every year. I know this will work in Washington just like it works in my home state of South Carolina. </p>
<p>Under our state law, the legislature and governor are constitutionally mandated to balance the budget yearly. They are forced to make the tough choices and unable to pass mountains of debt onto future generations. </p>
<p>In order for a BBA to become law on the federal level, we need a constitutional amendment to be passed by two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Then it would need to be ratified by three-fourths of the states. </p>
<p>Congress came within one vote in the Senate from passing and sending a BBA to the states for ratification in 1995. In the 25 years that have passed, we have added almost $25 trillion to the national debt. </p>
<p>It is time to try once again. </p>
<p>Thankfully another idea in support of a BBA is gaining momentum in my home state of South Carolina. We currently have an effort underway to push for a constitutional convention to support a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. </p>

<p>In August, during the confirmation hearing of Myrna Pérez to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, Cruz said Pérez is an "activist" and the "most dangerous" of all the president’s circuit nominees</p>
<p>"You have waged litigation campaigns and opposed voter ID laws," <a>he told her on Aug. 5</a>. "You have opposed voter integrity laws. You have opposed prohibitions on ballot harvesting. You have advocated for felons being able to vote."</p>
<p>"Senate Democrats are not even hiding the fact that Ms. Pérez has been nominated precisely because she will be a partisan from the bench," <a>he said</a>.</p>
<a>Cruz highlighted</a> the soft-on-crime policies of Biden appointee Rachael Rollins, the Suffolk County, New York, district attorney, saying she has been
<a>"vocal and aggressive"</a> on the side of lawlessness and will "refuse" to prosecute crimes.
<p>Last month, as Russian President Vladimir Putin amassed tens of thousands of troops on Russia’s border with Ukraine, signaling an imminent invasion, Cruz turned up the heat on Biden’s appointees.</p>
<p>On Nov. 3, during the hearing of Biden’s nominee to the 9th Circuit Gabriel Sanchez, <a>Cruz claimed Sanchez</a> "played a leading role in legislation that would allow violent offenders to qualify for parole" and made communities "less safe."</p>
<a>Cruz characterized Saule Omarova</a>, Biden’s Treasury pick to lead the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as "hellbent on destroying the oil and gas industries."

<a>Cruz blasted Federal Trade Commission nominee Alvaro Bedoya</a> during his Senate hearing as a "left-wing activist, a provocateur, a bomb-thrower and an extremist."
<p>On Dec. 2, <a>Cruz slammed Biden's nominee</a> to be the new federal district judge for Southern New York, Dale Ho, during his hearing as an "extreme partisan" and "radical."</p>
<p>On Dec. 7, Cruz objected to a motion to confirm Biden’s nominee for chief of protocol at the State Department, Rufus Gifford, after Senate Democrats refused to pass his Nord Stream 2 sanctions.</p>
<p>On Dec. 15, <a>Cruz characterized Biden’s nominee to the Second Circuit</a>, Alison Nathan, as a "partisan" and "ideological" extremist who is soft on crime.</p>
<p>After Cruz and Senate Democrats stuck their deal on Dec. 18, a total of 56 nominations sailed through the Senate on voice votes, including former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel as ambassador to Japan. </p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York promised Cruz that a vote on the Nord Stream 2 sanctions would be held by Jan. 14 but will require 60 votes, which means Cruz has his work cut out for him in an evenly divided 50-50 Senate.</p>

<p>Serving others lifts our eyes to see – and meet - the needs of other people. Even helping someone with a small task can make a remarkable difference in that person’s life, and in turn, provide you with an incredible feeling of accomplishment.</p>

<p>It was an incredibly powerful moment for me: the overwhelming gratitude of those receiving the jackets acted like a nuclear bomb going off in my heart, and it also touched the other volunteers, making us all realize how truly blessed we are.</p>
<p>We need other people. We were created for community, and nothing grows community like working <i>for </i>and <i>with </i>other people.</p>

<h1>At Christmas and all year long, Code of Vets gives back to veterans in need</h1>
<h2>"I do it to honor my dad," Code of Vets’ founder Gretchen Smith tells Fox News Digital</h2>
<div><div><h4><a>Veterans open up about the spirit of America</a></h4> <p>A group of servicemen discuss what it takes to be a great leader in the military on 'The Big Sunday Show.' </p></div></div>
<p><a>Christmas</a> is a time when people give thanks and help their fellow neighbors. <a>Military families</a> are no exception.</p>
<p>Some American <a>veterans</a> are in need of a helping hand as the COVID-19 pandemic continues and inflation on household staples takes a chunk out of wallets. That’s where Code of Vets comes in. </p>
<p>The Tennessee-based 501(c)(3) <a>nonprofit</a> has been assisting veterans throughout the country since 2018, according to Code of Vets’ founder Gretchen Smith.</p>
<p><a>WANT TO HELP OUR MILITARY VETERANS? HERE’S HOW</a></p>
<div> <div><p> Code of Vets is a Tennessee-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit that has been assisting veterans throughout the country since October 2018. (Code of Vets)</p></div></div>
<p>In 2020, Code of Vets provided assistance to nearly 2,000 veterans. This year, the organization has received more than 3,500 applications.</p>
<p>Smith and her charity partner Dr. Cindy Walter have a vetting process that helps them narrow down the applications that should take priority, though Smith said she wishes the organization could help every single applicant.</p>
<p>VETERANS MAKING A DIFFERENCE ARE SPOTLIGHTED AHEAD OF ARMY-NAVY FOOTBALL GAME</p>
<p>"We’ve raised well over $5 million with 2% operating costs. Cindy and I do not take paychecks. We have a couple of other people working with us, and we do not pay them. We're an all-volunteer organization," Smith told Fox. </p>
<p>"The money goes to the veterans when they need it," she added. "There are times when we will pay bills directly, but there are times when we send them the funds, and then they screenshot the receipts and send them to us."</p>
<p>Smith and her team keep the public updated about quarterly reports and fundraising missions through the Code of Vets website and social media accounts.</p>

<p>For people who wish to help Code of Vets this holiday season, the organization is accepting cash donations that will cover basic needs, including groceries, prescription copays, car repairs and preventative evictions or utility disconnections.</p>
<p>"We can alleviate the financial stress our veterans are under for the holidays," Smith said. "We can ensure they have a roof, heat, lights, and food for Christmas."</p>
