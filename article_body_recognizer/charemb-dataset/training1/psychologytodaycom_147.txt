<a>embarrassment</a> about their eating behaviors.
<p>Many people experience occasional instances of overeating and may even "binge" from time to time. To be considered a disorder, then, these behaviors must occur at least two days a week for six months or more.</p>
<p>For more, see <a>Binge-Eating Disorder.</a></p>
<h2> What Are Other Eating Disorders? </h2>
<p>Though anorexia, bulimia, and binge-eating disorder are the most well known, eating disorders encompass a number of other conditions, too. These include avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, rumination disorder, pica, and others. </p>
<p>Pica is a condition characterized by the eating of one or more nonnutritive, nonfood substances on a regular basis, such as paper, soap, or hair. Those with the disorder typically do not have an aversion to food in general. </p>
<p>Other eating disorders, such as night eating syndrome or atypical anorexia, may be classified under "other specified feeding and eating disorders" in the <a>DSM-5</a>.</p>

<h2> What Causes Eating Disorders? </h2>
<p>There is no single cause of any eating disorder. It's not yet understood why ostensibly voluntary behaviors associated with eating turn into disorders for some people but not for others. </p>
<p>Biology also plays a role. Appetite control and the regulation of food intake is highly complex, with many hormones in the brain and the body signaling hunger and satiety. Evidence also suggests that eating disorders have genetic roots.</p>
<p>Other circumstances factor in, too; the conditions can be triggered by stress, social difficulty, loneliness, depression, trauma, or by dieting itself.</p>

<h2> How Are Eating Disorders Treated? </h2>
<p>It can take a long time—sometimes years or decades—for people with an eating disorder to decide to seek help. When they do, there are numerous treatment options that can help them recover.</p>
<p>For more, see <a>How Are Eating Disorders Treated?</a></p>
<h2> The Recovery Process </h2>
<p>Recovering from an eating disorder can be a long and winding road. And once in recovery, people must continue to observe and adapt to prevent setbacks and relapses. Treatment can provide the necessary skills to do that.</p>

<h2> Parenting a Child with an Eating Disorder </h2>
<p>Watching a child suffer through an eating disorder can be deeply upsetting. Parents shouldn’t blame themselves for the development of the disorder, but they can take steps to provide support and help their child heal.</p>
<p>Different stages of the process require different actions. Those steps might include recognizing the signs of a disorder, learning about the illness, discussing it with the child, and encouraging them to seek treatment.</p>

<p>Not everyone who is depressed experiences every symptom. Some people experience a few symptoms, some many. The severity of symptoms varies among individuals and over time.</p>
<a>anxious</a>, or empty mood; feelings of hopelessness or
<a>pessimism</a>; and feelings of

<h2> What Causes Depression? </h2>
<a>trauma</a>, loss of a loved one, a difficult relationship, or any
<a>stressful</a> situation that overwhelms the ability to cope—may trigger a depressive episode. Subsequent depressive episodes may occur with or without an obvious trigger.
<p>Some types of depression tend to run in families, suggesting there may be some genetic vulnerability to the disorder.</p>
<p>For more see <a>Causes of Depression</a>.</p>
<h2> How Is Depression Treated? </h2>
<p>Depression, even the most severe cases, is a highly treatable disorder. As with many illnesses, the earlier treatment begins, the more effective it can be and the greater the likelihood that recurrence can be prevented.</p>
<a>psychotherapy</a>. Many studies show that
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> psychotherapy is highly effective, alone or in combination with drug therapy.
<p>For more see <a>Treatment of Depression</a> and <a>Therapy for Depression</a>.</p>
<h2> Natural Approaches to Depression </h2>
<p>Depression requires active treatment, because the disorder can have enduring effects on brain function that make future episodes more likely. The longer a depression episode lasts, the more likely a future episode.</p>
<p>However, there are many ways to treat depression, and some of the most effective, especially in cases of mild to moderate disorder, do not require a prescription or medical-type intervention of any kind. </p>
<p>Depression can be seen as a kind of cave, and it takes some time and effort to get out of the cave. But it is possible, usually by learning some new patterns of thinking and doing. Nutrition plays a role as well.</p>

<h2> The Major Forms of Depression </h2>
<p>What most people mean when they talk about depression is unipolar depression—an unremitting state of sadness, apathy, hopelessness, and loss of energy. It is also called major depression.</p>
<a>bipolar disorder</a>, a condition marked by periods of depression interspersed with periods of high-energy
<a>mania</a>. People swing between the two poles of mood states, sometimes over the course of days, and sometimes over years, often with stable periods in between.
<a>postpartum depression</a>, a condition requiring treatment because it can interfere with a parent's ability to care for their newborn.
<p>Depression can also occur seasonally, primarily in the winter months when sunlight is in short supply. Known as seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, it is often ameliorated by daily exposure to specific types of artificial light.</p>

<p>Studies show that about 5 percent of depressed persons may have thoughts about suicide—suicidal ideation. Only a small percentage of them actively make plans to end their lives.</p>

<a>attention</a>-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, or borderline
<a>personality disorder</a>. Biological factors probably create vulnerability to the disorder within certain individuals, and experiences such as sleep deprivation can kick off
<a>hypomania</a>, a mania that is mild to moderate and does not normally require hospital care.
<h2> Signs of Bipolar Disorder </h2>
<a>depression</a> can be abrupt, and moods can oscillate rapidly. But while an episode of mania is what distinguishes bipolar disorder from depression, a person may spend far more time in a depressed state than in a manic or
<a>creativity</a>. As a result, a person experiencing it may deny that anything is wrong. There is great variability in manic symptoms, but features may include increased energy, activity, and restlessness; euphoric mood and extreme
<a>optimism</a>; extreme irritability; racing thoughts, unusually fast speech, or thoughts that jump from one idea to another; distractibility and lack of
<a>concentration</a>; decreased need for sleep; an unrealistic belief in one's abilities and ideas; poor judgment; reckless behavior including spending sprees and dangerous driving, or risky and increased
<a>sexual</a> drive; provocative, intrusive, or aggressive behavior; and
<a>denial</a> that anything is wrong.

<div> <h3> How common is bipolar disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>45 million people,</a> according to the World Health Organization.
<div> <h3> What age does bipolar disorder tend to develop? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can people recognize bipolar disorder in children and adolescents? </h3> </div>
<a>Children with bipolar disorder</a> undergo extreme changes in mood and behavior, feeling unusually happy and energetic during
<a>manic episodes</a> and becoming very sad and less active during depressive episodes. Manic episodes may involve increased energy, distractibility, grandiosity, and inability to sleep while depressive episodes may involve
<a>self-harm</a> or suicidal thoughts and gestures, which should be taken seriously.
<p>One key factor: bipolar is episodic while other disorders are pervasive. For example, bipolar symptoms come and go in mood swings, while disorders like ADHD tend to be more consistent if left untreated.</p>
<div> <h3> Why is bipolar disorder often misdiagnosed? </h3> </div>
<p>People often struggle with unidentified and untreated bipolar disorder for years. In fact, about two-thirds of people with bipolar disorder are misdiagnosed before bipolar is discovered.</p>
<a>misdiagnosed with depression.</a> When thinking about the difference between the two, patients and clinicians can consider family history due to the genetic roots of the disorder, and personal history of unexplained excitability and euphoria or
<a>Antidepressants</a> can trigger mania in some cases; it’s critical to monitor if a patient feels more agitated, irritable, aggressive, or
<a>hyperactive</a> after beginning
<p>In the <a>case of schizophrenia,</a> manic episodes can include or resemble psychosis, while depressive episodes resemble the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. (Such patients may receive a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type.)</p>

<h2> Causes of Bipolar Disorder </h2>
<div> <h3> Is bipolar disorder genetic? </h3> </div>
<a>Genes that are passed down in a family with bipolar</a> appear to influence how the brain handles mood regulation.
<div> <h3> Can traumatic brain injury cause bipolar disorder? </h3> </div>

<a>important for both identifying and treating bipolar</a>.
<h2> Treatment for Bipolar Disorder </h2>
<a>omega-3</a> fatty acids may help lower the number or dosage of medications needed. Omega-3 fatty acids play a role in the functioning of all brain cells and are incorporated into the structure of brain cell membranes.
<a>Psychotherapy</a> is also valuable in teaching self-management skills, which help keep one's everyday ups and downs from triggering full-blown episodes.

<a>psychiatric</a> medication or fears of maintaining one’s sense of self, a therapist can provide clarity and support.
<h2> Living with Bipolar Disorder </h2>
<div> <h3> Can people with bipolar disorder maintain creativity on medication? </h3> </div>
<a>fear</a> of losing one’s creativity, productivity, and sense of

<div> <h3> Does bipolar disorder affect religion and spirituality? </h3> </div>
<a>bipolar disorder experience hyper-religiosity during mania.</a> Fifteen to 22 percent of those with bipolar mania in the U.S. experience religious delusions, such as thinking that demons are watching them or that they are Christ reborn.
<a>memory</a>, and still other parts of the frontal lobe and limbic structures are responsible for rational and emotional aspects of religious beliefs.
<a>Dopamine</a> levels in those with bipolar disorder may play a role in elevating religious and spiritual experiences.

<a>bipolar disorder believe the condition confers certain advantages</a>, such as creativity,
<a>leadership</a>. Famous figures are often cited to illustrate the
<a>connection between genius and mental illness,</a> such as Vincent van Gogh, Winston Churchill, and more recently, Kanye West.
<div> <h3> What are common myths about living with bipolar disorder? </h3> </div>

<p>People with high-functioning autism/Asperger's often have difficulty with social situations, and they may not be able to understand the perspectives and feelings of others. However, their language and cognitive skills are often typical.</p>

<p>Asperger’s was a distinct diagnosis in the previous version of the DSM. In the DSM-5, which was published in 2013, Asperger’s is part of the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder. The symptoms include: </p>
<li>Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts. Examples include the inability to engage in conversation back and forth, a lack of eye contact, or the inability to maintain relationships over time.</li>
<li>Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Examples include repeating the same hand movement consistently, strictly adhering to routines, or a fixation on a specific interest, such as the subway system.</li>
<p>For a diagnosis, symptoms would also be present during the person's childhood and lead to significant distress in the person’s daily life.</p>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>The roots of Asperger's syndrome or autism are not well understood. Current research points to a complex combination of biological and environmental elements.</p>
<p>Certain environmental factors also elevate the risk of developing autism, such as older parental age, maternal infection during pregnancy, maternal diabetes, exposure to the drug valproate in utero, and low birth weight.</p>
<div> <h3> Has autism increased over time? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why is Asperger’s more common in boys than in girls? </h3> </div>
<a>four times more common</a> in boys than in girls, according to the CDC. But the reason for this trend still isn’t completely clear. One hypothesis, proposed by scientist Simon Baron-Cohen, is the
<a>extreme male brain theory,</a> which states that men’s general propensity for systematizing and women’s generally propensity for empathizing render autism an extreme form of the male brain.
<p>But the theory has been critiqued, as others believe that that biological difference cannot account for such a large discrepancy, and that <a>genetics</a>, <a>social learning</a>, and diagnostic <a>bias</a> play a role as well.</p>
<h2> Services and Treatment </h2>
<div> <h3> What services can help people with Asperger’s? </h3> </div>
<p>Behavioral interventions that address specific behaviors and identify triggers for them are often helpful. Interventions that teach both children and their families effective communication strategies are also effective. </p>

<h2> Neurodiversity and the Benefits of Asperger’s </h2>
<div> <h3> What are the benefits of thinking differently? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is a savant? </h3> </div>
<a>10 percent of people with autism are savants,</a> so it’s still the exception, rather than the rule, in the autism community.
<div> <h3> What is twice-exceptional? </h3> </div>
<a>twice-exceptional,</a> often abbreviated as 2e, refers to intellectually
<a>gifted</a> children who have some form of disability. These children are considered exceptional because of their intellectual gifts and because of their special needs. These so-called disabilities often include diagnoses on the autism spectrum and
