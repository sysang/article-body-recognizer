<a>taking a six-day pause</a>. Here’s a look at the new policies in place in each league:
<div><div><h3>NFL</h3></div></div>
<p>Amid surging coronavirus cases, the <a>NFL significantly altered its protocols</a> in the latter portion of the season, changing how quickly players can return to their teams in the event they test positive, and how often players are tested.</p>
<a>reduced to five days</a> for both vaccinated and unvaccinated players after the
<a>Centers for Disease Control and prevention issued new recommendations</a>, so long as the players are 24 hours removed from having a fever while other symptoms “have resolved or improved,” the NFL told teams in a memo.
<div><div><p>Vaccinated players who test positive can return to their teams before the five-day isolation period is over if they produce two negative tests. Unvaccinated players who test positive must remain in isolation for all five days.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Jerry Brewer: The NFL’s new covid approach is smart for making money — and bad for public health</p></div>
<div><div><p>The NFL has declined to mandate vaccines or booster shots for its players, though it has encouraged players to get them.</p></div></div>
<div><p>As NFL playoffs approach, growing coronavirus issues threaten competitive balance</p></div>
<div><div><h3>NBA</h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The NBA also <a>altered its coronavirus protocols</a> in mid-December. The new regulations call for increased mask usage and additional testing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Covid could turn the NBA's Christmas showcase into a dud</p></div>
<div><div><p>The NBA has not mandated vaccines or booster shots for its players but has recommended them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last week, four days before the NBA’s annual <a>Christmas Day showcase</a>, Commissioner Adam Silver <a>told ESPN</a> that there were “no plans right now to pause the season.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This virus will not be eradicated, so we have to learn to live with it,” Silver <a>continued</a>.</p></div></div>

<a>will force NHL players to miss the Beijing Olympics</a>. The league continues to make schedule changes, including
<a>an announcement Tuesday</a> that it was postponing nine more games because of attendance restrictions in Canadian cities.
<div><div><p>The league’s recently unveiled <a>enhanced protocols</a> resemble the ones used during the 2020-21 season. They apply to both vaccinated and unvaccinated players.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All members of a team’s traveling party will be tested daily instead of every third day, though they are not subject to testing on their days off or for 90 days after a positive test.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The NHL’s coronavirus surge will keep its players out of the Olympics. Here’s what to know.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Like the NFL and NBA, the NHL has not mandated that its players receive a vaccine or booster shot, instead encouraging them to do so.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Matt Bonesteel</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 30, 2021|Updated December 30, 2021 at 7:38 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>So far this college football bowl season, we have seen a winning coach get showered with french fries, a fitting celebration of Wyoming’s Famous Idaho Potato Bowl triumph:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And on Wednesday night, Clemson Coach Dabo Swinney was showered with tangy orange crackers after his Tigers defeated Iowa State in the Cheez-It Bowl:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was everything I dreamed of,” Beamer said after he was coated by 4.5 gallons of slightly watered-down mayonnaise. “It was a little heavy, for sure. I’m a little weighted down here in the back.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>The ultimate college football bowl game betting guide, Part II</p></div>
<a>polarizing condiment</a> than mayonnaise, with its adherents contending that no sandwich is complete without it while its opponents (the author of this story included)
<a>consider it a menace</a> that should be banned. Beamer seems to be in the latter camp.
<a>said</a> this month when Duke’s Mayo Bowl executive director Dan Morrison
<a>announced</a> that the bowl would donate $10,000 to the charity of the winning team’s choice should its head coach submit to the bath. “I’ll gladly take one for the team on that one if it means we won a football game, but woof.”
<div><div><p>Tar Heels Coach Mack Brown, on the other hand, seemed much more accepting of the idea considering the charitable donation at stake, <a>saying</a> it would be “worth it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We need to win,” <a>he added</a>. “I said somewhere I’d let someone hit me with a frying pan 365 days if we won. Mayonnaise is easy.”</p></div></div>
<a>joined in unity</a> to express their dismay after Wisconsin Coach Paul Chryst received the traditional Gatorade/water shower after his Badgers defeated Wake Forest, even though a victory slathering of mayo had been teased throughout the broadcast.
<div><div><p>One year later, the mayo bath became a reality after some extensive testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There also were dry runs, which in this case was a wet run. A slimy, smelly, wet run.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>We actually already had seen one college football mayo dump this season, when a Clemson fan submitted himself to the worst possible shower during the kickoff episode of ESPN’s “College Gameday” on Sept. 4.</p></div></div>
