<div><h1>Trump aims to inject more extreme election conspiracy theorists into GOP</h1></div>

<div><div>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</div></div>
<div><div><p>The upshot is that election trutherism very much lives on in today’s GOP. A look at Trump’s early 2022 endorsements shows just how intent he is upon making sure it defines the party even more moving forward.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Among the other 16, virtually every one of them has promoted the bogus stolen-election claims, and three of them even attended the Jan. 6 rally that preceded the Capitol insurrection.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The latter three are Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.), who is running for Senate, Wisconsin congressional candidate Derrick Van Orden and Arizona secretary of state candidate Mark Finchem.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Others have been instrumental in the actual effort to overturn the election.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Among Trump’s other endorsements:</p></div></div>
<li>Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker has promoted fringe, pro-Trump lawyers L. Lin Wood and Sidney Powell, while saying “there is no doubt there is serious Election Fraud!”</li>
<li>Nevada Senate candidate Adam Laxalt has promoted multiple debunked theories, including about dead people voting and voters illegally casting ballots after moving.</li>
<li>North Carolina Senate candidate Rep. Ted Budd signed a letter after the election asking the Justice Department to investigate voter fraud and irregularities, including “particularly in the vote counting process.”</li>
<li>Pennsylvania Senate candidate Sean Parnell was one of two Republicans behind a far-flung and ultimately failed effort to prevent the counting of most mail ballots in that state.</li>
<li>Alaska Senate candidate Kelly Tshibaka, who is challenging Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R), listed off a slew of debunked theories about Michigan, while labeling the Antrim County theory, in particular, “credible.”</li>
<li>Georgia lieutenant governor candidate Burt Jones was stripped of his state legislative chairmanship by current Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan (R) over his voter-fraud claims.</li>
<li><span>And Georgia secretary of state candidate Rep. Jody Hice baselessly claimed as many as 1 in every 10 votes in Georgia was fraudulent.</span></li>
<div><h1>The GOP keeps reinforcing the real reason it opposes a Jan. 6 commission</h1></div>
<h2>It’s as if Republicans were trying to prove they were just doing this for political reasons</h2>

<div><div><p>One of the most stupefying aspects of the fast-emerging GOP resistance to a Jan. 6 commission is how they ever even allowed it to get to this point.</p></div></div>
<a>deputized</a> the ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. John Katko (N.Y.), to negotiate a bipartisan deal. Katko did so. Then McCarthy threw him under the bus by opposing the deal he’d charged Katko to negotiate.
<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<a>Thirty of these members come from Donald Trump districts</a>.)
<a>two key elements the GOP wanted</a>: an even number of members from both sides and veto power over subpoenas. In many ways it
<a>emulates the 9/11 Commission</a>, which has become something of a standard for looking into issues of national security. It also mirrors a bill
<a>30 House Republicans endorsed</a> when the Capitol riot was more raw and there was more impetus for action on the GOP side.
<div><div><p>All of which have been points made by the bill’s GOP supporters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Katko said the bipartisan deal is “<a>nearly identical</a>” to that GOP-proposed bill. But <a>16 of the 30 Republican co-sponsors of that bill voted against it</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Katko on the House floor Wednesday also sought to debunk many of the GOP criticisms of the bill. Of the idea that it was a partisan bill, he responded: “This is about facts. It’s not about partisan politics.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lastly come the GOP’s seeming acknowledgments of their true, political motivations. One that got lots of attention Wednesday was from the No. 2 Senate Republican, John Thune (S.D.).</p></div></div>
<a>according to CNN</a>. “Anything that gets us rehashing the 2020 elections, I think, is a day lost on being able to draw a contrast between us and the Democrats’ very radical left-wing agenda.”
<div><div><p>Thune had previously entertained the idea of a Jan. 6 commission.</p></div></div>
<a>their intent is just to keep the spotlight on Trump, and that’s not right</a>.”
<div><div><p>And that’s obviously what this boils down to, at least in large part: the desire to shift that spotlight away from the former president and this particularly ugly chapter.</p></div></div>
<a>rudderless leadership of McCarthy</a>. But regardless of how we got here, it sure points to the political expediency being on decidedly one side — and not the one McCarthy and McConnell are pointing to.

<div><h1>McConnell would have happily considered finding Trump guilty, were it not for Mitch McConnell</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Philip Bump</div></div>National correspondent </span></div></span></div><div>February 13, 2021 at 9:27 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>You could feel it coming, the unseeable tsunami on its way as you watched the water receding from the bay.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Boats were left stranded as the sea withdrew. McConnell himself had voted against convicting Trump, so all of his rhetoric about the former president’s culpability was clearly leading to that most political of words: <i>But</i>.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Fish flopped in the sand, gasping for breath. Then, after nine minutes of warmup, a rumble. A shadow on the horizon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve made my view of this episode very plain,” McConnell said. “But” —</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Let the destruction begin.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>— "our system of government gave the Senate a specific task,” he continued. “The Constitution gives us a particular role.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Glub glub glub.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now, Mitch McConnell would have been happy to “have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge,” he said, were it not for one sad problem.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Following intense reflection, he said, he’d come to the determination that “we have no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen.” Ergo, a vote to acquit.</p></div></div>
<i>specifics</i>, this particular excuse from McConnell is marred by one fatal flaw.
<div><div><p>The Senate trial occurred after Trump left office solely because Mitch McConnell, who in mid-January was the Senate <i>majority </i>leader, decided that it should.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The House impeached Trump on Jan. 13. On that day, McConnell, then in charge of the Senate, released <a>a statement</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After all, his statement continued, there wasn’t enough time anyway.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This conflict between what McConnell said Saturday and what he did last month did not escape the notice of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). After Trump’s acquittal, she addressed reporters.</p></div></div>
<a>told reporters</a> that the impeachment team was still “working on taking this to trial.”
<div><div><p>She echoed the sentiment of many legal observers that Trump’s having left office wasn’t an impediment to his being convicted in a Senate trial anyway.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was not the reason that he voted the way he did,” she said of McConnell’s current position, “it was the excuse that he used.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>‘It was inciting,’ ‘provoked by the president’: What GOP senators said before about Trump’s culpability for the Capitol riot</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>February 10, 2021 at 10:27 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<p>“Nothing the president said on January 6 was inciteful, let alone impeachable,” <a>one of them read</a>, “and in fact, President Trump urged supporters to exercise their rights ‘peacefully and patriotically.' ”</p>
<div><div><p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), before voting twice that the trial was unconstitutional, expressed <a>an openness to convicting Trump</a>. He said Trump “provoked” the Capitol rioters.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>vote to acquit — and it bears noting that he’s reportedly
<a>still open to conviction</a> — it would be interesting to see how he squares his statement that Trump provoked the riot with the idea that Trump didn’t incite it. Indeed, Merriam-Webster
<a>lists “provoke” as a synonym for “incite.”</a> Incitement does carry a more specific meaning in a legal context, but experts generally agree that an impeachment
<a>need not prove or even involve a statutory crime</a>. (Despite Trump lawyer Bruce Castor’s
<a>claim Tuesday that “high crime” means “felony,”</a> that is not at all the case.)
<div><div><p>Others pointed a finger at Trump in ways that might also be difficult to explain, but didn’t necessarily come so close to saying he incited the mob.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think it was a tragic day, and he was part of it,” said Sen. Roy Blunt (Mo.), the No. 4-ranking Senate Republican.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Senate GOP’s No. 2, John Thune (S.D.), added that Trump’s rhetoric “sure didn’t help.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Certainly encouraging people to go to the Capitol and some of the sort of implied suggestions I think are, you know … they just encourage the wrong behavior,” Thune said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If anything he urged, in a very emotional situation, very inappropriate action by people that appear to be his supporters,” said Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) also seemed to point a finger at Trump, albeit more indirectly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A day later, in a Fox News interview, Cotton again blamed some of his colleagues and said, “What happened yesterday is in part a result of the misleading claims in recent weeks.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) was perhaps the most direct.</p></div></div>
<a>Blunt suggested Tuesday</a>. And perhaps some of the others will vote to acquit on procedural grounds (i.e. that the trial is unconstitutional) rather than saying they’re absolving Trump altogether.
<div><div><p>But their comments sure make this argument by Trump’s lawyers far less potent.</p></div></div>
<div><h1>Birtherism paved the way for the ‘big lie.’ The latter is proving more pervasive and stubborn.</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 1:35 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>If anything, though, the GOP’s belief in the “big lie” has proved more pervasive and stubborn than the conspiracy theory that laid the groundwork for it a decade ago.</p></div></div>
<a>that number is 58 percent in the Post-U-Md. poll</a>.
<a>71 percent of Republicans believe Biden was not rightfully elected</a>, while another ABC News poll had an identical
<a>71 percent saying Trump was the rightful winner of the election</a>.
<div><div><p>You can ask the question any number of different ways, but the results are almost always the same: The theory usually finds favor with at least 70 percent of Republicans. And it has been thus for 14 months.</p></div></div>
<a>70 percent in November 2020</a>,
<a>72 percent in January 2021</a> and
<a>73 percent in November 2021</a>.
<a>Seventy percent of Republicans said it was</a> in December 2020, according to Quinnipiac University. Then,
<a>78 percent said so</a> in a September CNN poll. Then came the 71 percent in the U-Mass. poll this weekend.
<a>79 percent of Republicans said it was</a>. The number was a comparatively low
<a>61 percent in May 2021</a>. But by August it was
<a>66 percent in another poll</a>, and then by November was
<a>68 percent in yet another</a>.
<a>very different results</a> depending upon how you asked the question — from as few as 13 percent of Americans believing in it to upward of 3 in 10 and a significant majority of Republicans (similar to today with the “stolen election”).
<div><div><p>Shortly after Obama released his birth certificate in April 2011, Gallup polling showed the number of Republicans who believed he was born in another country <a>dropping from 43 percent to 23 percent</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>said he believed Obama was born in the United States</a>, the number of Republicans who disagreed again
<a>dropped — from 51 percent to 33 percent</a>.
<a>recovered yet again</a> — a December 2017 poll showed a slight majority of
<a>Republicans (51 percent) believed Obama was “probably” born in Kenya</a> — they did at least momentarily respond to actual developments and evidence. And the disparate numbers suggested the belief was fungible and less pervasive.
<div><p>Such has not been the case with the “Big Lie.” And that’s despite arguably even more compelling debunkings of it — not just by judges but by conservatives and Republicans who spent months investigating the claims.</p></div>
<a>Michigan</a> and, most recently,
<a>Wisconsin</a>. In the latter three cases, in particular, people sympathetic to claims of voter fraud directly rebuked Trump’s claims.

<div><div><p>Now comes yet further confirmation that the Trump team’s brazen attempt to overturn the 2020 election result was what we thought it was.</p></div></div>
<a>interview with Rolling Stone</a> and in
<a>we’ve laid out</a>, it’s unlikely it would have ever gotten to the point where the delegations would vote, and even if they did, it would have required almost every Republican to toe the line on overturning the result.
<div><div><p>(Rep. Liz Cheney, for instance, would have controlled Wyoming’s vote as its sole House member. And just one other Republican voting the wrong way in the right state could have torpedoed the whole thing.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But even acknowledging all of those caveats, what’s remarkable here — while also familiar — is how forthrightly Navarro is copping to the plot, as if it was no big deal, really.</p></div></div>
<a>detailed Trump lawyer John Eastman’s memo</a> laying out multiple scenarios for how the election might be overturned.
<a>told the National Review’s John McCormack</a>. “The memo was designed to outline every single possible scenario that had been floated, so that we could talk about it.”
<div><div><p>Eastman went so far as to say, “Call me the white-knight hero here, talking [Trump] down from the more aggressive position.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Navarro doesn’t bother with the pretense that this was anything other than an effort with a predetermined outcome. Here are a couple of his comments from <a>his QA with Rolling Stone’s Tim Dickinson</a>:</p></div></div>
<li>“One of two things could happen. They go back there [to the states], they look at it and they say, “Nope. It’s certified.” [The votes] come back, and that would be it. Fair enough.”</li>

<a>suggestions that we were testing <i>too much</i></a>
<a>a deleterious impact on the administration’s response</a>. Health officials in August 2020 suddenly
<a>downgraded their guidance on when to get tested</a> — in line with Trump’s suggestions — and Birx said this wound up coming at a particularly inopportune time, with real-world consequences.
<a>coronavirus</a> posture — is going down a similar road. He’s also doing so at a rather curious time.
<div><div><p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has signaled twice in the past two days that Florida will adjust its testing guidelines to discourage too much testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During an appearance with <a>controversial state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo</a> on Monday, Ladapo stated that, “<a>We need to unwind this sort of planning and living one’s life around testing</a>.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>DeSantis <a>suggested that he was on the same page</a>, saying people buying up rapid tests and testing without symptoms has created “some of the crunch that you are seeing.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In further comments Tuesday, DeSantis again signaled a move away from mass testing, suggesting it was a symptom of covid “hysteria.”</p></div></div>
<a>a record surge in cases</a>, but that’s hardly unique to it right now. Its overall per capita numbers of deaths and cases are also
<a>on the high end</a>, though below some redder and less-vaccinated states and states that bore the brunt of the early pandemic.
<a>highest that number has been at any point in the pandemic</a> and the
<a>seventh-highest number in the country</a>. As recently as a month ago, only 3 out of every 100 tests there came back positive; now it’s 3 in 10.

<div><h1>Sean Hannity’s texts and the duplicity they reinforce</h1></div>
<h2>The Fox News host apparently knew about unrest in the White House over Trump’s Jan. 6 campaign. He didn’t share it — or even allude to it. And he has company.</h2>

<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hannity did not share this with his viewers, mind you. And as has been <a>revealed of other Fox News hosts</a>, he provided those same viewers with a perspective markedly different from the one he was espousing privately.</p></div></div>
<a>detailed by the House Jan. 6 committee</a> Tuesday night. Hannity added, apparently referring to Trump, “I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he is being told.”
<div><div><p>Hannity in a Jan. 5 text again referenced departures from the White House Counsel’s Office: “Pence pressure. WH counsel will leave.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hannity sent his “Pence pressure"/"WH counsel will leave” text the next evening, according to the committee. In another text the same night, Hannity said he was “very worried about the next 48 hours.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“So we may only have 180 precious minutes tomorrow to make our case that there was real voter fraud, a case the media says we can’t possibly make,” Gaetz said.</p></div></div>
<p>It’s not clear exactly what Hannity was “very worried” about — Trump’s plot blowing up, the prospect of violence, resignations or anything else — but he certainly had a forum to discuss that and did not.</p>
<div><div><p>Hannity echoed this on Jan. 14.</p></div></div>
<p>Ingraham privately expressed concern about Trump’s delayed response on Jan. 6 but <a>said nothing to that effect on her show</a>. Hannity privately expressed concern about Trump’s plotting and his election theories and also said nothing.</p>
<a>raises concerns about “freedom of the press.”</a> There is no question that would be the case if Hannity were engaging in actual journalism.

<div><h1>Garland hints at bigger things in Jan. 6 probes, as Dems call for scrutiny of Trump</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 4:25 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 5:40 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>But Garland delivered <a>his remarks</a> with clear knowledge of the political backdrop and with several notable comments on that front. And they’re worth a parse.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Early in his remarks, Garland reinforced the idea that the investigations are far from complete and that these efforts, by necessity, were starting small.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We resolve more-straightforward cases first because they provide the evidentiary foundation for more-complex cases,” Garland said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after came <a>the money quote</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Garland seemed to address critics again later.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Most important, we follow the facts — not an agenda or an assumption,” he said. “The facts tell us where to go next.”</p></div></div>
<p>In the very next breath, though, Garland alluded to another major investigation involving a president — Watergate — in a way that he had to know might stand out. And he again cited the idea that the powerful weren’t above the law.</p>
<div><div><p>The biggest question moving forward is how broadly Garland views, in the money quote, the concept of those who “were otherwise criminally responsible for the assault on our democracy.”</p></div></div>
<a>might be the crime to focus on when it comes to Trump</a>. Or does this include inciting Capitol rioters or declining to forcefully call them off even as your
<a>own supporters pleaded with you to do so</a>? Or does it include trying to overturn a democratic election based upon false claims?
<div><div><p>Garland gave no indication about that Wednesday, except to say that some crimes might have involved conduct well outside the Capitol and outside the context of the rioters themselves.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Lawmakers howl about gerrymandering — that their side isn’t doing it enough</h1></div>

<div><div>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</div></div>
<div><div><p>To be clear, politicians have gerrymandered the heck out of these maps for partisan gain for decades; they just generally at least pretended it was done with actual constituents and fairness in mind.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a growing number of cases, they’re dropping that pretense and acknowledging this practice for what it is — or what they think it should be: about protecting their own power.</p></div></div>

<a>responded angrily</a> to Georgia Republicans who added some blue territory to her extremely conservative northwest Georgia district (she’s still completely safe) and tried to add another GOP-leaning district to the state’s map.
<div><div><p>Greene added that the maps “should have fortified GOP districts for the long term instead” and called it “a losing strategy that leads into the slow slide of Georgia turning blue.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Got that? She says the map-drawers “chose to play politics” but then just as quickly says they should have adopted the specific version of playing politics that she preferred — for the good of the party.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To be clear, Trump took 57 percent of the vote in Missouri in 2020 and 56 percent in 2016. A map in which the GOP was favored in five of eight districts would give the GOP 62.5 percent of the state’s congressional seats.</p></div></div>

<a>used an expletive</a> to describe state Democrats’ decision to remove some Democrats from her Las Vegas-based district — the safest in the state — to make two swing districts more favorable to the party.
<div><div><p>Again, the reasoning wasn’t that this wasn’t fair — it was that it was bad politics.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said losing Democratic voters in her district “would have been worth it” if the party got two safe districts, but it didn’t.</p></div></div>
<p>New York is another state in which Democrats have some power to redraw their district lines. And in an interview with the New York Times in August, new governor Kathy Hochul (D) signaled <a>she would use the process to benefit her party</a>:</p>
<blockquote><div><b>Do you plan to use your influence to help Democrats expand the House majority through the redistricting process?</b></div><div>Yes. I am also the leader of the New York State Democratic Party. I embrace that.</div></blockquote>
<a>cut a deal a decade ago</a> to accept the then-GOP-controlled state Senate’s gerrymandered maps in exchange for Republicans supporting an anti-gerrymandering ballot initiative. (The measure passed but this week
<a>failed to deliver on the promises of nonpartisanship</a>.)
<div><div><p>A victim of that process? Then-Rep. Hochul, who lost her House district after one term when it was drawn to be more conservative.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>5 takeaways from Biden’s forceful Jan. 6 takedown of Trump</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 12:04 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>sarcastically saying he missed “my predecessor.”</a> Biden largely
<a>avoided mentioning Trump</a> in the following months.
<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below are some takeaways from Biden’s speech.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>1. The Trump focus</div></h3></div></div>
<p>“For the first time in our history, the president had not just lost an election; he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol,” Biden said. “But they failed. They failed.”</p>
<div><p>Biden added later: “He has done what no president in American history — the history of this country — has ever, ever done: He refused to accept the results of an election and the will of the American people.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Then Biden went after Trump’s delayed response.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>2. Not just targeting but goading Trump</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Much of Biden’s speech seemed aimed at not just criticizing but also goading Trump.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He referred to Trump’s “bruised ego” over losing the 2020 election.</p></div></div>
<a>invocations of the 74 million people who voted for Trump</a>, and the idea that not further scrutinizing Trump’s baseless voter-fraud claims was tantamount to disregarding those voters.
<div><div><p>Biden also pointed to those who might otherwise be allies who clearly didn’t back up Trump’s claims.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden punctuated it all toward the end of his speech by labeling Trump what Trump fears perhaps most of all: a loser.</p></div></div>
<i>defeated </i>former president,” Biden said, emphasizing “defeated” and then repeating it — “defeated by a margin of over 7 million of your votes in a full and free and fair election.”
<div><div><h3><div>3. A recognition that being passive doesn’t work</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>It might have been a special occasion, but it also seemed to mark recognition that Trump is going nowhere, and one can’t pretend otherwise.</p></div></div>
<a>did that in a late-2017 speech against Trump</a>, and on Thursday there was a word curiously missing from Biden’s remarks: “Trump.”
<div><div><p>Biden’s speech, though, was clearly targeted at one person in particular. And if you’re saying “<a>all that I mean</a>,” why not say all that you mean and make it even more explicit?</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>4. The undersold rebuke</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Toward the end, Biden referred to something that hasn’t gotten nearly enough attention: the implicit GOP idea that the presidential election was somehow stolen, but not other races.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s Biden:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cruz’s former chief of staff laid the groundwork for making that point more than a year ago. And Biden rightfully raised it Thursday. It has certainly been a selective voter-fraud crusade.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>5. What happens now</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The question in the aftermath of Biden’s speech is what it means. Was this just about reminding people of an assault on democracy — one day only — or was it about spurring further action?</p></div></div>
<a>reviewing the Electoral Count Act</a> that Trump sought to exploit Jan. 6. Democrats have suggested this is a wholly insufficient step.
<a>another Democrat running against Trump</a>). When the calendar turns to an election year, after all, legislation tends to grind to a halt, and those concerns take precedence. Biden’s goading of Trump certainly doesn’t discount this theory.
<div><div><p>Either way, though, it’s a significant entry in the long-standing fight over democracy. And it was the most significant entry on that front from Biden to date.</p></div></div>
<div><h1>How Jan. 6 — and Republicans — enabled Trump’s domination of the GOP</h1></div>

<li>The No. 1 House Republican, Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), said Trump bore “responsibility,” while suggesting a historic censure of a sitting president.</li>
<li>The No. 1 Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell (Ky.), said, “There’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking” the attack.</li>
<li>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said Trump’s rhetoric about a stolen election had been “irresponsible” and “reckless.” He added that Trump “went way too far over the line.”</li>
<li>Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) called on Trump to “quit misleading the American people and repudiate mob violence” and said Jan. 6 was “in part a result of” such misleading claims.</li>
<li>Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said Trump’s call for protesters to march to the Capitol “was inciting.”</li>
<li>Even Fox News host Tucker Carlson said on Jan. 7 that Trump had “recklessly encouraged” the events of the day.</li>
<div><div><p>GOP leaders thought they might be able to break with Trump, only to be proved very wrong. The lesson for all of them was that there’s virtually nothing Trump could do to lose the base, and they should act accordingly.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Ted Cruz grovels to Tucker Carlson over Jan. 6 ‘terrorist attack’ remark</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Aaron Blake</div></div>Senior reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:35 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><a>2021 Election: Complete coverage and analysis</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>To recap, Cruz (R-Tex.) set off a bit of a MAGA backlash on Wednesday by calling Jan. 6 a “violent terrorist attack." Among those criticizing Cruz was Carlson, who <a>laid into the senator on Wednesday night</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So Cruz appeared on Carlson’s show Thursday night to back down, take his medicine, and hopefully move on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It did not go quite so well. But it did at least provide an extremely apt picture of the current state of the post-Jan. 6 GOP — on the evening of Jan. 6 itself, no less.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Carlson began the interview by positing that Cruz had “lied” about the events being a terrorist attack. And Cruz instantly signaled contrition.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The way I phrased things yesterday — it was sloppy, and it was frankly dumb," Cruz began.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Carlson cut him off, though. He said he didn’t believe Cruz and that Cruz — a highly trained lawyer — can’t possibly have been so sloppy with his choice of words.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t buy that,” Carlson said. “Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don’t buy that.”</p></div></div>
<a>efforts to disown its previous acknowledgements</a> that Jan. 6 was as bad as it was — along with
<a>Donald Trump’s culpability</a>. This wasn’t him slipping up; this was him deciding the talking point was no longer welcome.
<p>Carlson then ventured on to some more characteristically shaky logical and rhetorical ground. He suggested Cruz was playing into Trump critics’ hands by giving them license to apply words like “terrorist” to all Trump supporters.</p>
<div><div><p>The solution to this is apparently to stop saying what he really thinks — and something he’s made clear he thinks, on multiple occasions — about the people who attacked the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I guess I just don’t believe you,” Carlson said.</p></div></div>
<a>that has often gone awry</a>. Cruz concluded it by saying of alleged efforts to tarnish Trump supporters, “I’m the one leading the fight in the Senate against this garbage.”
<div><div><p>If he wasn’t before, he surely is now — even if it means not saying what he really thinks and disowning what he said before. The situation demands it.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Inside the U.S. Capitol, the rioters were in charge.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At last, reinforcements arrived: D.C. police officers, who wear an image of the Capitol building on their department’s official patch, but rarely enter the building itself.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What we did do was restore democracy for all of America,” D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee III said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“How could they fail so miserably? [The mob] could have blown the building up. They could have killed us all,” said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a longtime Trump ally.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No lawmakers were hurt. But four people died during the Capitol breach, including one woman who was fatally shot by police as she tried to break through to a room next to the House chamber.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Pentagon put significant restrictions on D.C. Guard ahead of pro-Trump protests</p></div>
<div><div><p>Neither Irving nor Stenger, both Secret Service veterans, nor Sund, who was previously a top District police official, responded to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Before the news broke Thursday that <a>he will resign on Jan. 16</a>, Sund said in a statement that the Capitol Police had prepared a “robust plan” for Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But, Sund said, they had readied for a demonstration — and instead were confronted with “criminal riotous behavior.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was no intelligence that suggested there would be a breach of the U.S. Capitol,” Contee said Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But law enforcement experts said they were stunned that the Capitol had been left so undefended, noting several factors that contributed to the mayhem.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And there appeared to be minimal efforts to build a secure perimeter around the Capitol. It wasn’t until Thursday morning that fencing went up around the complex.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So why would an attack against Congress be out of the question?</p></div></div>
<div><p>Dozens arrested after mob storms Capitol; officials vow that more will be charged</p></div>
<div><div><p>At the Capitol on Wednesday, by contrast, the grounds were guarded in some places only by low pieces of fencing and officers in street uniforms.</p></div></div>
<div><p>About 1 p.m., with crowds gathering outside the building, Sund requested help from D.C. police, according to people familiar with the appeal. D.C. police sent reinforcements to the outside of the building. It wasn’t enough.</p></div>
<div><div><p>When the first attackers arrived, according to videos taken by witnesses, they picked up the fences, hit the officers with them, and kept going. Police officers simply ran with them, routed already.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In a short period, Capitol Police officers were overrun. For a time, the head of the Capitol Police union said Thursday, they had to choose between protecting their building and getting members of Congress, staff and reporters out.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It is a monumental failure,” Acevedo said of the response.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Inside the Capitol, it seemed like no help was coming. The mob roamed freely in many cases, <a>ransacking offices and destroying furniture</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>Defense officials balked</a>, concerns about the “optics” of soldiers inside the Capitol building, two District officials said.
<div><p>Photos: The damage and destruction at the U.S. Capitol</p></div>
<div><div><p>During the melee, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said he got a call from House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who was in a secure location under police protection.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was actually on the phone with Leader Hoyer who was pleading with us to send the Guard,” Hogan said Thursday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the governor said he was initially stymied: Maj. Gen. Timothy Gowen, the adjutant general of the Maryland National Guard, was repeatedly rebuffed by the Defense Department.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said he also got a call on his cellphone Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Northam said he mobilized Virginia National Guard units. They did not arrive at the Capitol until Thursday morning, long after the breach was over. Virginia also sent state police troopers, who arrived earlier.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After rioters were already inside the building, the D.C. police reinforcements, led by a D.C. police officer, Inspector Robert Glover, began to take charge inside the Capitol itself.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gradually, other federal law enforcement officers and National Guardsmen also began to arrive. The Capitol was cleared and the Senate and House sessions resumed about 7 p.m.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, lawmakers said they would investigate how the Capitol Police failed — and why it took so long for others, including the Pentagon, to send reinforcements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The attacks on Wednesday, Ryan said, had “broken the veil of protection” around one of the shrines of American democracy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are never going to look at the Capitol the same way again,” Ryan said.</p></div></div>

<a>rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol building Wednesday</a> as Congress met to
<a>without evidence,</a> that the presidential election was stolen from him.
<p>The mob began toppling barricades in front of the Capitol and pushed past Capitol Police officers.</p>
<p><a>Once past the barricades and police</a>, the rioters ran up the Capitol’s steps, banged on doors and attempted to break in through windows to enter the building.</p>
<p>Once they reached the Capitol, rioters started breaking windows to enter and in another instance, walked into the building, yelling “it’s open."</p>
<a>rioters ran through the halls</a>, tried to push through doors and fought with police. Shortly after 2 p.m., Capitol Police ordered all staff, reporters and nearby senators into the Senate chamber, which was
<a>sealed off and put on lockdown.</a>
<p>Photos show one of the men who stormed the Capitol <a>sitting in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office</a> with his feet on the desk and the words “WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN” written on a folder.</p>
<p>Amid the escalating violence, 35-year-old <a>Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot</a> by a U.S. Capitol Police officer, according to two people with knowledge of the incident. Warning: The below video is graphic.</p>
<p>After several hours, <a>law enforcement officers</a> dispersed the mob inside the Capitol, using stun grenades and other riot-control tactics.</p>
<p>At 6 p.m., authorities said the interior of the Capitol had been secured and no rioters remained. Police announced to those still outside that the curfew imposed by D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) would take effect.</p>

<p>Before noon, the president of the United States, their rogue hero, told thousands of his supporters that this was the last stand, the moment to overturn the result of November’s election and ensure a second term for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to fight much harder,” Trump told several thousand red-clad, flag-waving acolytes gathered on the Ellipse, with the White House as backdrop.</p>
<p>And then the 45th president of the United States unleashed a mob.</p>
<p>The process of affirming the next president was halted by mob violence.</p>
<p>“You’ll never take back our country with weakness,” he told his followers. “You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”</p>
<p>They did as they were told. By the thousands, they walked 16 blocks down Pennsylvania Avenue NW and surrounded the U.S. Capitol.</p>

<p>“There was obviously a great deal of anxiety and concern,” Cardin said. “It was like we might be in harm’s way any second.”</p>
<p>In forums devoted to the QAnon conspiracy theory movement and among hard-right groups such as the Proud Boys, plans to turn a pro-Trump rally into a full-on capture of the Capitol had been plotted, dissected and disseminated for months.</p>
<p>The ultimate inspiration of the mob’s passion, the president himself, had repeatedly urged his followers to come to Washington on the day when Congress would affirm the result of November’s election.</p>
<p>“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted last month. “Be there, will be wild!”</p>
<p>“America is <a>so much better than what we’re seeing </a>today,” Biden tweeted, but in the nation’s capital city, the end of that sentence seemed very much to demand a question mark.</p>
<p>Their president told them to move to the Capitol and so they did, converging on the East Front steps after 1 p.m., shouting, chanting, singing the national anthem, waving Confederate flags and Trump 2020 banners.</p>
<p>They said this was their house, the people’s house, and they had every right to push their way in, all in service of ensuring Trump would somehow reverse the will of the people and grab a second term in office.</p>
<p>Over the course of an hour, waves of protesters arrived in front of the Capitol, just as inside the House and Senate convened in a rare joint session to affirm the electoral college vote and officially decree Biden the next president.</p>
<p>Dozens of protesters pushed onto the steps and ledges of the building on all sides. On the grand staircase opposite the Library of Congress, there were only a handful of officers, arrayed against a crowd reaching into the hundreds.</p>
<p>There was pushing. Men in Trump regalia shoved police, called them “traitors,” cursed at them. At some doors to the building, no officers were visible.</p>
<p>In one big push, Trump supporters surged up the steps and overwhelmed the officers atop the flight of stairs. Hundreds, then thousands followed. Some scaled the walls to get up; others climbed over one another to reach the top.</p>
<p>Inside, after only 12 votes had been certified in the presidential election, both houses of Congress suspended their debates.</p>
<p>For over an hour, people banged on the doors of the Capitol on the north and west sides, chanting, “Let us in! Let us in!”</p>
<p>Officials had not anticipated that Trump would dispatch his rally crowd to the Capitol.</p>
<p>After 2:10 p.m., a man in the crowd swung a clear plastic riot shield to break through first-floor windows on the Capitol’s south side, making a hole big enough to climb through. A stream of protesters pushed in.</p>
<p>Police said those first trespassers then opened one or more doors to let more of the swelling, chanting mob inside. Police tried to disperse the group with pepper balls and smoke bombs, but more people came in behind those at the front.</p>
<p>A medical squad pushed into the building and carried the woman — later identified by her former husband as Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran and avid Trump supporter — out on a gurney.</p>
<p>“White female, shot in the shoulder,” an officer said as they hurried away.</p>
<p>Babbitt died from her wounds, police said.</p>
<p>Protesters, by that point nearly surrounding the building, kept pouring in, breaking through entrances that had been locked but not secured by the Capitol Police.</p>
<p>Police escorted a line of arrested protesters away from the building, and some in the crowd called out to the officers, “Join us!” and “ ‘We the people’ means you, too!”</p>
<p>The rally that morphed into a march had turned into a violent mob, intent on stopping the rites of democracy.</p>
<p>The vice president had been whisked to a secure location in the Capitol complex.</p>
<p>“This is a coup attempt,” tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.).</p>
<p>“Guess who’s going home? None of us!” someone yelled. “Time to take back what’s ours!” someone else screamed. “A new 1776 has just begun!”</p>
<p>One large cluster of people rushed the steps after a handful of protesters called on others to “storm the Capitol!”</p>
<p>“Get these kids out of here!” a woman shouted at families.</p>
<p>“Storm it!” a man cried. “If you’re not serious about storming the Capitol, get out of here!”</p>
<p>Hundreds made it inside, dismantling metal barricades.</p>
<p>“This is amazing,” a woman in a star-spangled hoodie said. “They’re doing it!”</p>
<p>Inside the Capitol, hundreds broke into an a capella rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” their voices echoing off the marble walls.</p>
<p>Trump tweeted: “Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!”</p>
<p><a>Thirty-five minutes later, </a>slightly stronger: “I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law Order — respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue.”</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), unimpressed, <a>tweeted his response</a>: “It’s a little late for that. Don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Trump stayed inside the White House, seeing only a small group of loyal aides, including Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, social media director Dan Scavino, personnel director John McEntee and policy adviser Stephen Miller.</p>
<b>2:52:</b> “I am in the House Chambers,”
<p>Your gas masks are under your chairs, the legislators were told.</p>
<p>“You could hear a pounding on the doors on the outside,” said Rep. David Trone (D-Md.). “At that point, they had us get our gas masks out.”</p>

<p>House members were informed that police had deployed chemical irritants in Statuary Hall, and Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), a former CIA case officer, prepared to be exposed to tear gas.</p>
<p>Capitol Police officers barricaded the chamber doors with tables and bookshelves.</p>
<p>“It is a low for this country I never thought we would reach,” Spanberger said. “This is what we see in failing countries. This is what leads to a death of democracy.”</p>
<p><b>2:54:</b> Trump’s former communications director, Alyssa Farah, tweeted a message to her former boss: “Condemn this now, @realDonaldTrump — you are the only one they will listen to. For our country!”</p>
<p>A woman wearing a “What would Jesus do?” sandwich board read from scripture before handing the mic to someone who led a prayer for the police.</p>
<p>On the building’s main steps, dozens of protesters, many in Make America Great Again hats, chanted “Fight for Trump.” Hardly anyone wore a mask.</p>
<p>A middle-aged couple from Idaho snapped pictures of each other, smiling.</p>
<p><b>3:15:</b> The president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, in the absence of any statement by her father, tweeted a call for the mob to cease all violence. She addressed them as “American Patriots.” Minutes later, she took down the tweet.</p>
<p>Schumer and Pelosi <a>called on Trump to demand </a>that the protesters vacate the Capitol grounds. He did not.</p>
<p>When he left, a file folder was placed atop a computer keyboard. In red capital letters, someone had scrawled “WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.”</p>
<p>Shortly after, photos popped up online of protesters holding shards of the sign they’d torn off the entrance to Pelosi’s office.</p>
<p>The mob outnumbered the police. They overpowered the officers and rushed the building, chanting “Treason” and “Our house.” A few minutes later, clouds of tear gas emerged over the crowd, leading many to run from the Capitol.</p>
<b>4:15:</b> In the president’s absence, Trump’s duly-elected successor
<a>went on national TV</a> to implore the president to do his job: “I call on this mob to pull back and allow the work of democracy to go forward,” Biden said.
<p>The president-elect, looking deeply saddened, called the mob “a small number of extremists” whose behavior “borders on sedition.”</p>
<p>“The words of a president matter,” Biden said. “I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution.”</p>
<p>The president did no such thing.</p>
<p>Instead, Trump did what he’s done for most of his adult life: He doubled down on his provocation.</p>
<p>Twitter quickly removed the tweet.</p>
<p><b>4:30</b>: Outside the east side of the Capitol, a man with a megaphone announced to a crowd of hundreds: “Hey, everyone, Donald Trump says he wants everyone to go home.”</p>
<p>In response, some in the crowd booed loudly. One man shouted back: “Shut the f--- up! We’re not going to bend a knee, motherf-----!”</p>
<p><b>4:40:</b> Hundreds of riot police, from the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI and the D.C. police, arrived and made their presence felt. They began to clear the Capitol and its surrounding office buildings.</p>
<p>As the sun set, officers in riot gear threw explosive flash-bangs into the crowd outside the Capitol. Dozens of Capitol, D.C. and National Guard officers — drooping after hours of confrontations — emerged from the Capitol building.</p>
<p>The fresh troops beat back the mob, which had been banging on the doors and windows of the Capitol for hours. Pushed away, the rioters yelled at the officers, chanting “Traitors! Traitors! Traitors!”</p>
<p><b>5:00:</b> Police finished clearing the upper level of the Capitol. Officers, some with shields, formed a human barrier to block anyone else from getting inside.</p>
<p>As the intruders emerged, they were greeted as celebrities. One woman who said she had footage on her phone of Capitol Police pointing guns at rioters was encircled by dozens of protesters eager to see her show.</p>
<p>Just away from the building, about a hundred people rushed a media staging area where TV cameras were trained on the Capitol. They knocked over barricades and stomped on camera equipment, sometimes using Trump flags as weapons.</p>
<p>“CNN sucks!” they yelled.</p>
<p>People milled on the Capitol grounds, eating, taking pictures, chatting on the phone. Some were jubilant, reveling in their ability to take over their country’s seat of government.</p>
<p>“You’re seeing something in America you haven’t seen since 1776,” one man said.</p>
<p>Others remained angry, defiant. They gave police the finger and cursed at them.</p>
<p>At 6 p.m., the mayor called the rioters’ behavior “shameful, unpatriotic and above all . . . unlawful.” She said those who violated the law “will be held accountable. There will be law and order.”</p>
<p>At 6:15, police at the Capitol announced: “A curfew is now in effect. All individuals must leave the U.S. Capitol grounds.”</p>
<p>Hundreds of protesters slowly walked away as police in riot gear marched behind them.</p>
<p>“We’ll be back!” a man yelled.</p>
<p>As members of Congress prepared to return and resume the count of the electoral college votes, hundreds of police officers surrounded the building. Some removed Trump flags that had been left behind.</p>
<p>The police presence now was enormous, imposing — and too late, said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio). “There was a strategic breakdown, for sure,” he said, “and you can bet your a-- we are going to get to the bottom of it.”</p>
<p>By 8:45, the officers who had formed a human shield on the Capitol’s east steps had dispersed. A cluster of officers headed off together, saying good night, joking about how badly they needed the bathroom.</p>
<p>At 3:41 Thursday morning, Pence finally declared Biden the 46th president of the United States.</p>
<p>Trump, temporarily barred from Twitter, put out word through Scavino that, “Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.”</p>
<p>Four years ago, in his inaugural address, Trump declared, “The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action.”</p>
<p>Trump’s hour on the national stage is finally ending, indeed with action, with violence against the very structure and core of the nation he was entrusted to protect, violence fomented and encouraged by the president of the United States.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday night, Washington’s mayor issued an order extending by 15 days the public emergency she had declared earlier, now covering right up until the first full day of President Joe Biden’s turn at the helm of a hurting land.</p>

<h1>Five sensational vacation destinations from the virtual worlds of video games</h1>
<div>From Pelican Town to ‘Persona 5′s’ Tokyo to Hades itself, here’s a guide to five can’t-miss video game ‘vacations.'</div>
<div> <div> By Shelly Tan, Elise Favis, Gene Park, Armand Emamdjomeh </div> <div>February 25, 2021</div> </div>
<p>So, let’s showcase some game settings for travelers of all types, from the agrarian enthusiast to the hair-on-fire adrenaline junkie. Here are some of the best vacation destinations in gaming.</p>
<h4>The House of Hades from ‘Hades’</h4>
<h3>Sightseeing highlights</h3>
<p>The centerpiece of the home, as well as the entirety of hell, is Hades’s office. Please excuse the mess from the paperwork. As you’ll see, people are dying to see him.</p>
<p>On-site renovation is ongoing. Zagreus is out collecting the necessary gemstones and diamonds for furnishings in the underworld, but the House Contractor assures us that all work will be safe and neither seen nor heard.</p>
<p>The balcony by the Administrative Chamber offers a lovely view of the River Styx (as long as Thanatos isn’t brooding there).</p>
<p>Need a little time at the spa? Get re-energized with a soak in the Pool of Styx. After some rough-and-tumble adventuring in the underworld, you’ll feel like new.</p>
<p>In the dining hall, chefs work round-the-clock (they literally never stop) to make sure every meal is as good as your last.</p>
<p>And if you need a good workout, Skelly is an ideal in-house sparring partner. Why beat yourself up about getting in shape when you can beat him up instead?</p>
<h4>Pelican Town from ‘Stardew Valley’</h4>
