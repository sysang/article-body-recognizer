<h1>What is cash-out refinancing and how does it work?</h1>
<h2>Cash-out refinancing generally makes sense if it will improve your overall finances, allow you to keep your home in good repair, or boost your home’s value.</h2>
<div> <div><div> <p>Learn everything you need to know about cash-out refinancing and whether it could help you meet your financial goals. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>If you’re thinking about refinancing, Credible lets you <a><u>compare mortgage refinance rates</u></a> from various lenders in minutes.</p>
<h2>What is cash-out refinancing?</h2>
<p>You don’t have to stick with your current lender to do a cash-out refinance. While you may want to get a quote from them, shopping around will help you get the best deal.</p>
<p>You can use the cash you get however you want. Many people borrow against their equity to <a><u>pay for major home improvements</u></a>, refinance debt, cover college tuition, or tackle other big expenses.</p>
<h3>Types of cash-out refinancing loans</h3>
<p>Cash-out refinance loans generally fall into one of three categories:</p>
<li>Conventional loans — You’ll need a credit score of at least 620 for a <a><u>conventional cash-out refinance</u></a>. Conventional loans are the most common and require an appraisal and income verification.</li>
<li>FHA loans — Most borrowers will need a minimum credit score of 580. You may not be able to cash out as much equity as you could with a conventional loan, and FHA mortgage insurance will be an additional cost.</li>
<li>VA loans — Eligible military service members and surviving spouses can cash out all their equity <a><u>with a VA loan</u></a>. These loans have no minimum credit score requirement, but most borrowers will pay an upfront funding fee at closing.</li>
<p>Good to know: With any of these loans, individual lenders may have their own, higher credit score requirements.</p>
<p><a><u>WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF MORTGAGE LOANS AVAILABLE?</u></a></p>
<h2>How does cash-out refinancing work?</h2>
<p>Cash-out refinancing is similar to rate-and-term refinancing. The difference is that you’ll get cash back at closing in addition to a new interest rate, new loan term, or both. Follow these steps:</p>
<a><u>paying off high-interest debt</u></a> (like credit card debt), total up what you owe.
<li>Shop around and compare lenders. Submit applications to several lenders, including your current lender. Getting multiple estimates will help you find the best deal.</li>
<li>Apply. Lenders will need to review documents that prove your income and assets. Be prepared with bank statements, tax returns, and W-2s.</li>
<li>Close on your new loan and pay off your original loan. Expect to get your cash and pay off your existing loan anywhere from 43 to 59 days after applying. Be sure to get confirmation in writing that your original loan has been paid off.</li>
<h2>How much money can you get with cash-out refinancing?</h2>
<p>This amount is different for everyone because it depends on how much your home is worth and how much you owe on your existing mortgage. </p>
<p>You can use Credible to <a><u>compare mortgage refinance rates</u></a> from various lenders without affecting your credit score.</p>
<h3>How much does cash-out refinancing cost?</h3>
<p>Example: You want to borrow $240,000 for a cash-out refinance. Expect to pay between $4,800 and $12,000 for closing costs.</p>
<p><a><u>ARE MORTGAGE CLOSING COSTS TAX-DEDUCTIBLE?</u></a></p>
<h2>What are the requirements for cash-out refinancing?</h2>
<p>Lenders set their own requirements that borrowers must meet to qualify for a cash-out refinance. Here’s what they’re generally looking for:</p>
<li>A credit score of at least 620 — To get the best rates, aim for a score of 740 or higher.</li>
<li>A <a><u>debt-to-income ratio</u></a> (DTI) no higher than 50% — Again, you may get a better interest rate with a lower DTI.</li>
<li>Enough home equity to still have about 20% after cashing out — Lenders’ own guidelines and your financial profile will determine how much equity you can cash out.</li>
<h2>Pros and cons of cash-out refinancing</h2>
<p>Like any financial product, cash-out refinancing comes with pros and cons to consider. </p>
<h3>Pros of cash-out refinancing</h3>
<li>Reduce your interest rate — You may be able to borrow more money while securing a lower rate on your new home loan — and end up with a payment similar to the one you’re making now.</li>
<a><u>Paying off higher-interest-rate debts</u></a> through a low-interest home loan can help you save money and build momentum toward financial security. But keep in mind that if you can’t make your new mortgage payments, you risk losing your home.
<li>Protect your investment — One of the best ways to use home equity is to keep your home’s systems and structure in good condition.</li>
<li>Enjoy your home more — Renovations don’t always increase a home’s value. That said, if you’re spending lots of time in a space you don’t like, it may be worth borrowing to fix it up.</li>
<h3>Cons of cash-out refinancing</h3>
<li>Additional risk — Borrowing more could increase your risk of foreclosure or owing more than your home is worth. Also, your new monthly payment may be higher.</li>
<li>Slightly higher rate — Lenders may consider you a riskier borrower when you cash out some of your equity, so a cash-out refinance may cost more than a rate-and-term refinance.</li>
<li>Closing costs — If these costs are too high, a cash-out refinance may not be worthwhile.</li>
<li>Time to close — Waiting 30 to 60 days to close on a refinance might not cut it if you need money fast. Consider a personal loan instead.</li>
<h2>When does cash-out refinancing make sense?</h2>
<p>A cash-out refinance may be right for you if:</p>
<li>Your home has deferred maintenance. It’s important to protect your comfort and safety, as well as your home’s value.</li>
<li>You’re turning over a new leaf. If you use the cash to pay off credit cards and other high-interest debts — and don’t accumulate new high-interest debt — you may be able to save money and get a fresh start on stronger financial footing.</li>
<p>If a mortgage refinance is the right move for you, Credible lets you easily <a><u>compare mortgage refinance rates</u></a> from various lenders. </p>
<p>But a cash-out refinance may not be right for you if:</p>
<li>You already have a low rate. There have been many opportunities to get a great rate over the last 10 years, and especially over the last 20 months. Still, it’s worth doing the math and getting prequalified with lenders to see if you could save.</li>
<li>Your financial situation isn’t stable. Since life is unpredictable, it can be tricky to know when borrowing more money might improve your financial stability and when it might backfire.</li>
<li>Your credit score has taken a hit. You never know until you apply, but if your credit score is lower than it was when you got your current mortgage, you might not <a><u>qualify for a low enough rate</u></a> to make a cash-out refi beneficial.</li>
<h2>Alternatives to cash-out refinancing</h2>
<p>Besides a cash-out refinance, you may have other options to pay for large expenses.</p>

<h1>Putin blames West for tension with Ukraine, experts divided on invasion threat</h1>
<h2>Experts warn Putin is using threat of Ukraine invasion to block access to NATO</h2>
<p>Russian President <a>Vladimir Putin</a> on Thursday blamed the West for heightened tensions on the Ukrainian border and claimed the <a>Kremlin</a> has not threatened "anyone" despite its military buildup there.</p>
<p>Tensions between Washington and the Kremlin have reached a boiling point not seen since the Cold War as over 100,000 Russian soldiers have amassed along the border over the last several months.</p>
<p><a>PUTIN URGES WEST TO ACT QUICKLY TO OFFER SECURITY GUARANTEES</a></p>

<p>NATO member nations have repeatedly warned the Kremlin that should it invade its neighbor to the west, there would be serious repercussions, including severe economic sanctions.</p>
<p>In contrast to his language earlier in the week, Putin on Thursday alleged he does not want confrontation with Ukraine but said he needs security guarantees from the West that the former Soviet nation will not be permitted to join NATO.</p>
<p>"You must give us a guarantee. And immediately — now," Putin said during a four-hour-long press conference. </p>
<p>Putin claimed that should Kyiv be able to join NATO, "bases and strike weapons systems" could be placed in Ukraine and would pose an additional threat to the Kremlin. </p>
<p>But Koffler argued Putin has another motive for threatening to invade Ukraine. </p>
<p><a>RUSSIA WILL ENGAGE IN US SECURITY TALKS AS TENSIONS ESCALATE OVER UKRAINE</a></p>
<p>"He softened the language a little bit," the former DIA officer said comparing the Thursday presser to <a>unfounded accusations</a> made earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Koffler warned that Putin’s recent language echoes comments made in the lead up to the 2014 invasion of Ukraine and said she believes there could be an invasion as soon as Christmas Eve. </p>

<p>"He understands that we, our intelligence agencies, and national security apparatus are going to operate on a skeleton crew — he is more likely to achieve tactical surprise," she warned.</p>
<p>"Putin is clearly setting conditions to be able to invade, to conduct a full-scale invasion of Ukraine this winter," Kagan said. </p>
<p>The foreign policy expert said that Russia views the expansion of NATO as a "pressure campaign" and is using the threat of a Ukraine invasion as a bargaining chip to deny the former Soviet state access to the Western alliance. </p>
<p>"He’s making this a crisis," former CIA Moscow station chief Dan Hoffman told Fox News in reference to Putin. "He’s portraying Ukraine as the aggressor. He’s saying that the Russian motherland is under threat — it’s all typical Soviet propaganda."</p>
<p>Both Hoffman and Kagan said they did not believe a Russian invasion of Ukraine was imminent but warned it remained a possibility as long as Putin continues to mass troops on the border. </p>
<p>"Putin is doing all of this for leverage," Hoffman said. "And he knows if we do agree not to allow Ukraine to join NATO or to give Russia some veto power over it — we have wrecked Ukraine’s democracy."</p>
<p>Washington and Moscow are set to hold talks in the New Year to negotiate Russia's security demands. </p>

<h1>CFPB opens investigation into buy now, pay later credit programs</h1>
<h2>Bureau seeks to ensure credit program not bringing harm to consumers</h2>
<div> <div><div> <p>With the rise of buy now, pay later credit programs, the CPFB is opening an investigation to ensure they're not harming consumers. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>Five lending companies were subject to <a>an investigation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</a> as of Dec. 16, 2021 to examine the risks of buy now, pay later (BNPL) options.</p>
<p>Orders were sent out to Affirm, Afterpay, Klarna, PayPal and Zip to collect information on BNPL risks and benefits. The CFPB stated that it is concerned with accumulating debt, the product’s regulation and data harvesting.</p>
<p>If you're considering using a credit or debt option for your shopping, consider taking out a personal loan with a set, low interest rate. <a><u>Visit Credible to find your personalized rate</u></a> without affecting your credit score.</p>
<p><a><u>BUY NOW, PAY LATER LOANS TO BE FORMALLY INCLUDED IN EQUIFAX CREDIT REPORTS</u></a></p>

<p>Banking industry experts say that the CFPB’s investigation is a way for it to learn about the use of BNPL and to prevent harm to consumers. </p>
<a><u>Check out Credible to compare multiple lenders at once</u></a> and choose the one with the best interest rate for you.
<p><a><u>RETAIL BUY NOW, PAY LATER TRANSACTIONS NOT REPLACING CREDIT CARDS, STUDY SHOWS</u></a></p>
<h2>Merchants allow BNPL so consumers can spend more</h2>
<p>Merchants usually pay a fee of about 3% to 6% of the purchase price to BNPL companies to allow consumers to use it on their site. This is because consumers often spend more money when using BNPL, according to the CFPB. </p>
<p>The CFPB stated that it’s concerned BNPL will lead to consumers quickly accumulating debt over small, everyday discretionary buying. </p>

<h1>I want a loan — how long will it take to get my money?</h1>
<div> <div><div> <p>The Credible Money Coach explains how long it can take to close on different types of loans. (Credible)</p></div></div></div>
<p>Dear Credible Money Coach,</p>
<p>How long does it take to close on a loan from start to finish? — Mary Ann</p>
<p>Hi, Mary Ann. Thanks for your question! How long it takes to get a loan varies depending on the type of loan, your financial situation, and even underwriting requirements that are out of your control.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how these factors could affect how long the loan process takes, from applying to getting the money.</p>
<h2>Time frames for different types of loans</h2>
<p>The type of loan you apply for can have a significant effect on how long it takes to get funds, and much of that time difference has to do with risk and paperwork.</p>
<h3>Mortgage loans and refinances</h3>
<p>Since mortgages are large loans, they're a significant risk for lenders. They must complete a lengthy and costly foreclosure process if you default. They could lose hundreds of thousands of dollars if a mortgage doesn't get repaid as agreed.</p>
<p>While it generally takes less time to <a><u>get approved for a personal loan</u></a>, the time frame varies depending on your credit, the amount you want to borrow, and the lender.</p>
<p>It typically takes one to five business days to close a personal loan, although some online lenders may deposit your funds as soon as the <a><u>same or the next business day</u></a>.</p>
<p>In general, it takes two to 10 weeks to get a student loan. If you apply for a federal student loan, you must complete the FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid. </p>
<p>However, getting your student loan funds may take longer because they typically aren't disbursed until a week or two before the semester. And lenders usually send funds directly to your school for private and federal student loans.</p>
<h2>Your credit and finances</h2>
<p>While having <a><u>good credit</u></a> may not get your loan application processed faster, it helps you get the best rates and terms. Here are more tips to make your loan application go smoothly:</p>
<li>Pay down debt. Having relatively low debt balances reduces your credit utilization ratio, boosting your credit score.</li>
<li>Pay your bills on time. Having a good payment history is the most critical factor for maintaining an excellent credit score.</li>
<li>Watch your debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Most mortgage lenders have strict DTI limits you must meet for approval.</li>
<li>Prepare your documents. Before applying for a loan, find out what's required, such as a W-2, bank statements, and tax returns. Having your paperwork ready will save time.</li>

<h1>Can you consolidate student loans with your spouse?</h1>
<h2>Refinancing into a new student loan with your spouse may help you lower your interest rate and tackle your debt together.</h2>
<div> <div><div> <p>Consolidating student loans with your spouse can help you manage your finances more easily and potentially lower your interest rate. (iStock)</p></div></div></div>
<p>Americans owe more than $1.7 trillion in student debt, according to Federal Reserve data. If you and your spouse fall into this group, you may consider consolidating your student loans together. </p>
<p>Instead of both of you having to manage monthly payments on each of your loans, you’ll have a single monthly payment that’s easier to handle. You might even be able to reduce the interest rate you’re paying. </p>
<p>Let’s look at when you may want to consolidate student loans with your spouse, and what to consider before you do.</p>
<p>You can use Credible to <a><u>compare student loan refinancing rates</u></a> from various lenders in minutes.</p>
<h2>Can you consolidate student loans with your spouse?</h2>
<p>In many cases, yes, you can <a><u>consolidate student loans</u></a> with your spouse. The specifics depend on the types of student loans you each have. </p>
<h3>Student loan refinancing vs. federal student loan consolidation: What’s the difference?</h3>
<a><u>consolidate private loans</u></a> by refinancing. In most cases, private lenders will allow you to refinance federal and private loans together. If you’re looking to consolidate all your loans into one, refinancing is likely the best way to do it.
<h2>When should you consolidate student loans with your spouse?</h2>
<p>After you get married, it may make sense to consolidate student loans with your spouse in a number of situations, including:</p>
<li>You’re having trouble managing payment dates. It can be a hassle keeping track of numerous loans with varying balances and due dates. Consolidating into a single loan with one payment and due date can make it easier to budget.</li>
<li>You’re handling finances jointly. Many married couples choose to combine bank accounts and other finances. It may make more sense for your budget to have a combined student loan as well.</li>
<h3>Consolidating vs. cosigning student loans with your spouse</h3>
<a><u>cosigning a loan</u></a> doesn’t consolidate any loans together.
<h2>How to consolidate student loans with your spouse</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in consolidating student loans with your spouse, these are the steps you should take:</p>
<li>Shop around for refinance loans. Most student loan refinance companies post interest rate ranges on their website and information on who qualifies for their loans. You can make a list of lenders that may work for your situation.</li>
<p>With Credible, you can <a><u>compare student loan refinance rates</u></a> without affecting your credit.</p>
<h2>What are the requirements to consolidate student loans with your spouse?</h2>
<p>Requirements to consolidate student loans with your spouse vary by lender, but typically include a few of the following:</p>
<li>You must have graduated from an accredited college or university.</li>
<li>You must be employed or have an offer for a job that begins soon.</li>
<li>You must have a steady monthly income.</li>
<li>You must have a solid credit history.</li>
<li>You must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.</li>
<p>Some lenders may require you to have a minimum loan balance to be eligible for refinancing. Others may require that you’ve made a certain number of on-time student loan payments before refinancing.</p>
<h3>Can consolidating student loans with your spouse hurt your credit?</h3>
<h2>Benefits of consolidating student loans with your spouse</h2>
<p>Consolidating your student loans with your spouse’s loans can have a number of benefits, including:</p>
<li>You may lower your interest rate. If your financial situation has improved, you may <a><u>qualify for a lower interest rate</u></a> than you’re currently paying on your student loans. This will reduce the total amount you’ll pay over time.</li>
<li>You’ll have one payment. Keeping track of numerous loan amounts, payments, and due dates can be a challenge. Consolidating loans leaves you with one loan payment that's easier to manage.</li>
<p>If you’ve decided to consolidate your student loan debt with your spouse, Credible lets you easily <a><u>compare student loan refinance rates</u></a> from various lenders.</p>
<h2>Drawbacks of consolidating student loans with your spouse</h2>
<p>Like any major financial decision, consolidating student loans with your spouse has some drawbacks as well:</p>
<li>You may lose benefits. If you have federal loans, you’ll lose any special repayment plans or loan forgiveness benefits by refinancing into a private loan.</li>
<li>Your credit score may drop. Adding a significant amount of debt can negatively affect your score.</li>
<h2>Is consolidating student loans with your spouse a good idea?</h2>
<a><u>Federal student loans</u></a> have unique repayment plans, like income-contingent repayment and loan forgiveness benefits, that you’ll lose if you refinance into a private loan. Your new loan repayment plan may not be as generous.
<li>You think you may need to untangle the loans later. Splitting up a refinanced loan is often more difficult if you get divorced. If you’re concerned that your marriage won’t last, it might not make sense to consolidate student loan debt together.</li>

<h1>Sen. Blunt: US needs to cap inflation, child tax credit benefit</h1>
<h2>Sen. Roy Blunt said the US cannot handle current levels of inflation</h2>
<div><div><h2>Build Back Better bill shouldn’t be ‘counted out’ just yet: Creative Caucus co-founder</h2> <p>Fox News' Sean Duffy and Creative Caucus co-founder Suraj Patel discuss the details and future of the Build Back Better bill.</p></div></div>
<p>Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., argued that the U.S. can’t solve its <a>economic</a> problems by "just <a>dropping money</a> on top of more money" as he called for a cap on the child tax credit in an effort to combat <a>inflation</a>. </p>
<a>retire</a> by not seeking re-election in 2022, but he plans to make clear his concerns about the economy and how the Biden administration has handled a growing crisis before he leaves. U.S. inflation hit the
<a>highest level</a> seen in 39 years as consumer prices surge.
<div> <div><p>Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., speaks during a press conference on Capitol Hill in Washington Sept. 12, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts (Reuters)</p></div></div>
<p>Inflation remains among his chief concerns, and Blunt believes the Biden administration and congressional Democrats have only further compounded the nation’s issues by spending as they can. </p>

<p>Blunt said the administration made a "big mistake" by adding massive spending bills to its agenda as a means to combating rising inflation – levels of which he believes the country cannot handle and will continue to grow more severe. </p>
<p>"Six-point-eight percent inflation could become something bigger than that, and 6.8% is bigger than we can handle right now," Blunt argued. </p>

<p>Blunt took issue specifically with the spending on the child tax credit, which he and Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., believe "simply doesn’t make sense." </p>
<p>Currently, the <a>tax credit</a> applies to every family with children under the age of 18 whose modified annual gross income (AGI) in 2021 does not exceed $150,000 if married and filing a joint return. The upper limit in 2020 was $400,000. </p>
<p>"Putting a cap on families in need is what we can do, should do and would do in the country, and could do in a bipartisan way," Blunt said. </p>
<p><a><u>GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE</u></a></p>
<p>"Families are suffering whether the administration and Democrats in the Congress want to admit that or not," Blunt added. "This is not a transitory problem, it’s a real problem, and this is no time to make that problem worse."</p>

<h1>What the oil market signals about omicron</h1>
<h2>Oil has advanced 56% this year to $76 per barrel</h2>
<h2><a>Inflation will continue in the new year: Billionaire supermarket owner</a></h2>
<p>John Catsimatidis, who runs the Gristedes grocery chain in New York and is also in the oil business, predicts there will be another wave of price increases in the first few months of 2022.</p>
<p>Sometimes the oil market can be a predictor of future events. Could the rebound in oil signal the beginning of the end of the <a>COVID plague?</a></p>
<p><a>OIL'S BEAR MARKET MAY BE A SHORT ONE</a></p>
<p>Yet now oil prices are surging back as it is clear that omicron will not shut down the global economy nor will it shut the U.S. economy, where we are still the world's biggest consumer of oil. </p>
<p>President Biden acknowledged as much, lowering fears of a COVID-19 shutdown, and said Monday, "There is no federal solution. This gets solved at the state level." </p>
<p>In other words, a lockdown is off the table. Yet what may turn oil around are reports that people who catch the omicron variant might strengthen immunity against the earlier delta strain of the virus.</p>
<p><a>COVID TEST MAKER RAMPS UP PRODUCTION</a></p>
<p>And while it is too early to say that this is the end of the pandemic, it does suggest that the odds of an extended open global lockdown of economies is unlikely. </p>

<a><u>CERN 0.72% </u></a>, according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that could be worth around $30 billion and push the enterprise-software giant further into healthcare.
<p>An agreement could be finalized soon, some of the people said, assuming the talks don’t fall apart or drag out. Should a deal come together, it would rank as the biggest ever for Oracle, which has a market value of more than $280 billion. </p>

<p>Oracle, a Silicon Valley veteran that last year moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas, is one of the biggest software providers to other companies and organizations. </p>
<a><u>as chief executive officer</u></a>, a role he assumed in October. Mr. Feinberg came from Oracle rival Google, where he had led the
<a><u>Alphabet</u></a> Inc. unit’s push into healthcare and
<a><u>helped strike partnerships</u></a> with some of the country’s largest hospital systems to collect and analyze their data.
<p>Oracle already has a significant presence in healthcare, offering technology meant to help health insurers, healthcare providers and public health systems parse data to increase efficiency and improve patient outcomes. </p>
<a><u>who became the sole CEO in 2019</u></a>, said she expects the company’s operating margins to be the same or better than they were pre-pandemic.
<p>The company also increased the authorization for share repurchases by $10 billion. </p>
<a><u>Amazon.com</u></a> Inc. and
<a><u>Microsoft</u></a> Corp. , which both now have market values well exceeding $1 trillion thanks in part to thriving cloud units.
<p>A deal for Cerner would follow Microsoft’s agreement in April to buy artificial-intelligence company <a><u>Nuance Communications</u></a> Inc. for $16 billion, in a bet on the growing <a><u>demand for digital healthcare tools</u></a>. </p>

<a><u>when it beat out Microsoft</u></a> in bidding for the video-sharing app TikTok’s U.S. operations. The Trump administration’s concerns about TikTok’s Chinese ownership had effectively put the business in play, but the deal was
<a><u>put on hold indefinitely</u></a> by the Biden administration.
<p>Cerner, founded in 1979, competes with the likes of privately held Epic Systems Corp. and Athenahealth Inc., which recently agreed to a sale <a><u>to one group of private-equity firms by another</u></a> for around $17 billion including debt. </p>
<p>Cerner shares rose slightly to $79.49 Thursday. </p>
