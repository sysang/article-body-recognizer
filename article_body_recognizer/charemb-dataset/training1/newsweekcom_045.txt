<p>According to the Australian Museum, the Estuarine or saltwater crocodile is the largest living reptile in the world. The average length for an adult is between three and five meters.</p>
<p>The largest example found thus far was recovered from Mary River in the Northern Territory in 1974. Even without its head, the carcass was just under five and a half meters long.</p>
<p>Northern Territory Government campaign Be Crocwise was created to educate people about crocodiles and reduce the risk of attacks from the reptiles. They echo Langer's warning regarding swimming in the Northern Territories outside designated areas.</p>
<p>They say this is especially important in the saltwater and freshwater areas of the Northern Territory, where the reptiles live. They add that crocs are particularly common throughout the Top End and Katherine areas of the region.</p>
<p>Be Crocwise writes on its website: "You should always be aware of the risk of a saltwater crocodile attack in all Top End waterways. It is never 100 percent safe to enter the water. Your personal safety is your responsibility."</p>
<p>Be Crocwise says the majority of crocodile attack fatalities in the Northern Territories have occurred when people have ventured into non-designated bodies of water to swim.</p>
<a>top predator</a>" in its environment and is likely to consider humans as "
<a>potential prey</a>." Yet, the museum writes: "Despite numerous crocodile warning signs around popular waterways, people choose to ignore the risks and many attacks and near-misses have resulted.
<p>"Most attacks have occurred on swimmers or on people canoeing or bending down at the water's edge. This low profile seems to elicit a greater predatory response than from a person standing upright, even if in shallow water."</p>
<p>To reduce the risk of attacks, the Northern Territories Government operates a capture and removal program to deal with crocodiles found in population centers and parks.</p>
<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>Hiker Finds Monkey With Toes Caught in Animal Trap</h1><div> By John Feng <time>On 5/11/21 at 11:15 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<div> World Taiwan <a>Animals</a> <a>Monkeys</a></div>
<p>Police in southwest Taiwan are investigating an illegal trapping incident after a protected monkey lost three of its toes in a snare inside a national park.</p>
<p>A hiker in Gushan District in the port city of Kaohsiung encountered the injured Formosan rock macaque on Saturday and reported the sighting to a local monkey welfare advocacy group.</p>
<p>The picture shows the monkey appearing unable to walk while dragging a steel spring trap behind its left leg.</p>
<p>According to the NGO, park rangers arrived to find the macaque gone. By the time the animal was found the next day, the trap had already fallen off and three toes of its left foot had been severed.</p>
<p>Disturbing images showed the exposed bones on the primate's injured foot, while a video showed the animal alive and limping around on its three other limbs.</p>
<p>Warning: The picture below shows an injured monkey in graphic detail and could be disturbing to some readers.</p>
<p>"If the wound remains free of infection, it will heal over," said the association's secretary-general Lin Mei-yin told Newsweek. "The remaining toes on its left foot may eventually atrophy."</p>
<p>Hung Chi-yuan, deputy director of the national park's headquarters, told Taipei-based United Daily News that the Shoushan Formosan rock macaque population numbers around 1,000.</p>
<p>The trap was likely laid to catch stray dogs and not aimed at trapping monkeys, Hung said. While there was little evidence to go by, the park was working with local authorities to find the perpetrator, he added.</p>
<p>Regardless of the intended target, trapping is prohibited in the country, Lin noted. "It would be an indiscriminate attack whether it was used on a wild animal or a stray one," she said.</p>
<p>Lin said a number of macaques had been wounded by traps in recent years. She urged the park to introduce policies to root out the incidents.</p>
<p>The use and possession of animal traps are separate offenses under Taiwan's Animal Protection Act, punishable by fines of up to NT$75,000 (nearly $2,685) and NT$15,000 ($537) respectively.</p>
<div> News <a>New York City</a></div>
<p>A man in New York City said he was left bleeding after he was attacked by a rooster while walking down the street in Queens on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Just usually walking to head to my bus to go to work, and I felt a peck on my left hand," the man, Leon Suseran, <a>told NBC New York</a>.</p>
<p>"This thing kept coming, so vicious, almost evil...blood was gushing, and I was trying to apply pressure to it and it kept charging at me," he added.</p>
<p>A photo of his injuries posted online by the <a>New York Post</a> showed Suseran's hand bloodied and with a gash. He said he received a tetanus shot and is on antibiotics.</p>
<a>NBC</a> New York reported that the group has walked the streets near 169th street in Jamaica, Queens for years.
<p>Suseran said one of his neighbors was attacked by the rooster in June, when the animal bit her ankle.</p>
<p>"I've heard kids can't ride scooters, you can't walk freely. You've got to be careful now of a rooster," a neighbor, who wasn't identified, told NBC New York.</p>
<p>And another neighbor told the television station that parents avoid the area with their children because of the birds.</p>
<p>Following the attack, Suseran said he filed a complaint with the New York City health department.</p>
<p>According to<a> New York City health codes</a>, keeping roosters is generally prohibited. Roosters are considered to be in a category of "predatory or large birds" including eagles, hawks, falcons, owls, vultures and condors.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a different neighborhood in Queens was terrorized by another attacking animal: a squirrel. In January, The Guardian reported that three people in Rego Park, Queens were bitten by a "possibly deranged" squirrel.</p>
<div> News Black bear <a>Virginia</a> <a>Wildlife</a></div>
<p>Virginia officials have closed down a road in one neighborhood and instructed nearby residents to remain indoors after a black bear and three bear cubs were seen napping in a tree.</p>
<p>Chesapeake Animal Services said in a Facebook post Monday that entering the closed area either on foot or by car could worsen an already stressful circumstance for the bears, but giving them space and quiet will help them leave without incident.</p>
<p>The bears were spotted in a tree near Western Branch High School Monday morning, spurring officials to close down Bruin Drive in Chesapeake because of the location and number of bears.</p>
<p>"We must all do our part to safely co-exist with our wild neighbors," the post said.</p>
<p>"Our biggest issue is people feeding the bears or bears behaving in an unnatural way. So we encourage people to just leave them alone," he said.</p>
<a>Police</a> spokesman Leo Kosinski said dispatchers were first alerted to a possible bear sighting around 2 a.m. Monday, the Virginian-Pilot reported. Later that morning, officers saw the bears napping in the tree and closed off the area, he said.
<p>Conservation officers with the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources were responding to assess the situation.</p>
<p>Bears are very good climbers, and these four will likely climb down and walk away when they're ready, said Anderson, the wildlife chief.</p>

<div> Tech Science Wildlife <a>Animal attacks</a></div>
<p>Police officers were called to a backyard in California during the early hours of Sunday, spotting a mountain lion feasting on a chicken.</p>
<p>The Department of Wildlife Management advised that due to the lack of threat of human life, the attending officers should simply monitor the mountain lion until it left the area, which it did at around 9:44 a.m. The officers then left the scene</p>
<p>In a <a>Facebook</a> post on December 26, the Pacifica Police Department offered city residents advice on dealing with potentially dangerous wildlife like mountain lions.</p>
<p>It wrote: "It's important to remember that many areas of our city are bordered by parks and open space that are home to all kinds of wildlife including mountain lions and coyotes.</p>
<p>"It is important that we familiarize ourselves with information and safety tips about living in mountain lion country."</p>
<p>The Pacifica police added that<a> mountain lions,</a> also known as cougars, are quiet, solitary and elusive, and typically avoid people, with attacks on humans being rare.</p>
<p>According to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, there have been just 20 verified mountain lion attacks on humans since 1986. It adds that of these, only three proved fatal.</p>
<p>The Pacifica police added that to help limit the risk of mountain lion attacks, residents of the city should avoid cycling or jogging alone, and should avoid jogging at dawn, dusk, and night, times when the animals are most active.</p>
<p>They added that parents in the city should keep a watch on small children. All the verified mountain lion attacks recorded by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife since 2014 have involved children under the age of 7.</p>
<a>mountain lion</a> in Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park, Orange County, in January 2020. Reporting on the incident, the Los Angeles Times said that the boy had been grabbed by the neck by the cougar and dragged away from adults who stood just 10 feet away.
<p>The boy's father was able to ward off the animal and rescue the boy by confronting it and throwing a backpack at it, which the cougar dragged up a tree.</p>
<p>This should be accompanied by shouting and other loud noises and the throwing of rocks and other objects. Residents who are accompanied by a child should pick them up and hold them.</p>
<p>In the eventuality that a person is attacked by a<a> mountain lion</a>, they should fight back.</p>
<p><a>The Pacifica </a>Police Department concluded by saying that aggressive mountain lions should be reported to the police department at (650) 738-7314 or to the regional offices of the Department of Fish Wildlife at (707) 428-2002.</p>

<p>A large snake and a venomous huntsman spider were found in the same bedroom at a home in Australia. Snake catchers were called to the house after the owners spotted a "large snake" in the bedroom, estimated to be around seven feet in length.</p>
<p>As he enters the room, McKenzie spots a "massive" huntsman spider on the wall at the head of the bed. "It's one of the biggest ones we've ever seen," he can be heard saying in a video of the catch.</p>
<p>At the foot of the bed, on top of a bookshelf, the team spots the snake—a large <a>carpet python</a>—curled up beneath a wine rack. "That's not really what you want in your bedroom that's for sure," McKenzie says.</p>
<p>As McKenzie tries to unfurl the snake from the wine rack, it starts trying to slither away, but he manages to pick it up and remove it from the property.</p>
<p>While the snake was placed in a bag, the spider was collected with McKenzie's hat and taken out of the property and placed in a bush outside.</p>
<p>Huntsman spiders are venomous, but their bite is not deadly to humans. There are 94 known species, with most having a leg span of up to six inches. The largest huntsman species, the giant huntsman spider, can grow to double that size.</p>
<p>"This is about as close to a horror movie as our job gets," McKenzie and Brendan "Westy" West wrote on the company <a>Facebook</a> page following the call out.</p>

<p>Spider-Man: No Way Home came out on Friday, December 17 and has already become the third biggest global debut weekend of all time.</p>
<p>The film beat expectations for a movie released during the COVID pandemic and it easily surpassed other box office records during the period.</p>
<p>This was also true of the superhero flick's performance around the world, with the film coming out on Wednesday, December 15 in a number of countries including the UK, France and Italy.</p>
<p>Here is everything you need to know about Spider-Man: No Way Home's box office results.</p>
<h2>How much did 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' make in its opening weekend?</h2>
<p>Tom Holland's third solo outing as <a>Peter Parker</a>, aka Spider-Man, was originally predicted to earn $130 to $150 million over the weekend, according to <a>Variety</a>.</p>
<p>Despite these predictions, the film beat that and then some in only one day as it earned a staggering $121 million on its first day.</p>
<p>It earned a total of $253 million in its domestic box office, earning that from 4,336 theaters across North America.</p>
<p>This is impressive simply because no other film has managed to achieve that during the coronavirus pandemic, with the biggest release prior to the latest Spider-Man going to <a>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</a>.</p>
<p>The sequel to the Sony comic-book film earned $90 million on its first day, which isn't a small number by any means but it doesn't come close to Spider-Man: No Way Home's box office results.</p>
<p>It's total domestic figures has also made it the highest-grossing film of the year, and it also beat out every film that came out last year (not that there were many to do so).</p>
<a>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a> did extremely well even compared to other Marvel films coming out in 2021, with Black Widow earning $80.4 million and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings raking in $75.4 million on their opening weekends in the U.S.
<p><a>Box Office Mojo</a> reported that the film earned $334.2 million in its opening weekend at the global box office, with the publication reporting it earned $41.4 million in the UK alone.</p>
<p>Combining the two, it means the film earned a total of $587.2 million from its screenings around the world.</p>
<p>It also means the film has had the third biggest box office opening ever, coming after Avengers: Endgame, which earned $1.2 billion, and Avengers: Infinity War, which got $640 million.</p>
<p>While it's already had huge success, the film still has yet to be released in a number of countries including Japan, Saudi Arabia and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to <a>IMDb</a>, the film will be released in Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and Thailand on Thursday, December 23, while it'll come out in Japan on January 7, the Philippines on January 8, Slovakia on January 13, and Norway on January 14.</p>
<p>Spider-Man: No Way Home is out in theaters now.</p>
<header><div> <a>Culture</a></div><h1>Kim Kardashian Just Ruined 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' and People Aren't Happy</h1><div> By Emma Nolan <time>On 12/28/21 at 10:52 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Kim Kardashian has just committed an unforgivable crime and upset a lot of people in the process.</p>
<p>The reality television star caused a ruckus on Tuesday when she posted spoilers to Spider-Man: No Way Home to her millions of followers on social media.</p>
<p>The mother of four shared two snaps from towards the end of the highly anticipated movie from what looked like her home theater.</p>
<p><a>Page Six</a> has screen shots of the since-deleted posts.</p>
<p>Warning: Spoilers for Spider-Man: No Way Home ahead.</p>
<p>The first image shared by Kardashian showed a massive spoiler that had been highly speculated about for months.</p>
<p>Kardashian showed the two former Spider-Man actors Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield kitted out in their superhero costumes, proving that they were indeed in the movie after their robust denials.</p>
<p>In the second picture shared by Kardashian, the two former Peter Parker stars are seen hugging current Spidey, Tom Holland.</p>
<p>This reveal had been a closely guarded secret for months and a highlight of the film which has been breaking box office records.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Kardashian has been getting a lot of flack for her blunder with the attorney-to-be prompting a wave of anger from movie fans online.</p>
<p>"I went all this time without Spider-Man spoilers JUST to have <a>Kim Kardashian</a> ruin it for me in her insta story," reads one tweet.</p>
<p>While another added: "not kim kardashian spoiling spider man on her story. wtf so SICK."</p>
<p>"kim kardashian casually posting spider man no way home spoilers on her story," said another.</p>
<p>Another person tweeted: "No I'm literally obsessed with Kim Kardashian spoiling Spiderman No Way Home on her IG story from the comfort of her home theater."</p>
<p>"Why did @KimKardashian just post Spider-Man spoilers on her ig story like she don't got millions of followers," asked another.</p>
<p>"Spent a week avoiding spoilers on tiktok and <a>Twitter</a> for spiderman no way home only for @KimKardashian to spoil it on ig," said another.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted Kardashian's representatives for comment.</p>

<p>Cementing his place as a superhero icon, Tom Holland has now completed a trilogy of Spider-Man movies, finishing in spectacular fashion with the recent Spider-Man: No Way Home.</p>
<h2>What have Disney said about the future of Spider-Man?</h2>
<p>During the press tour before the release of Spider-Man: No Way Home, Kevin Feige sat next to Sony producer Amy Pascal and the pair discussed the future of the Spider-Man franchise.</p>
<p>He confirmed that discussions were already taking place about what to do next. Feige told the New York Times, "Amy and I, and Disney and Sony are talking about — yes, we're actively beginning to develop where the story heads next."</p>
<p>Tom Holland has been vague about his own future in the MCU, but has spoken about wanting to <a>take a break from acting</a>. He also told People how he'd like to take a break and <a>focus on starting a family</a>.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert for Spider-Man: No Way Home.</p>
<p>Garfield and Maguire's triumphant return as their respective Peter Parkers in No Way Home has prompted speculation that we could see more movies from their individual Spider-Man universes.</p>
<a>Twitter</a> that Sony is planning more Spider-Man movies with their old characters, specifically Andrew Garfield. Industry insider Daniel Richtman appeared to first report the rumor online, which has since spread like wildfire.
