<h1> The Adaptability Advantage </h1>
<h2> We need more than just resilience. </h2>
<li>In uncertain times, adaptability can be the difference between treading water and swimming.</li>
<li>Don't tell young people that resilience is everything. It's also important to learn to adjust when circumstances change.</li>
<li>It's helpful to recognize when a situation is new or uncertain, and discuss how to adapt.</li>

<p>Today I’ve asked Andrew Martin to share his Tip of the Week. </p>
<p>When I was 14, I switched to a new school across town. </p>
<p>I was lonely, out of my depth, and miserable.</p>
<p>Over the course of a few semesters, I settled in. But for years, I chalked up my difficulties to a lack of <a>resilience</a>. I blamed myself for not being able to navigate adversity.</p>
<a>fear</a> of unfamiliar teachers to the excitement of learning new subjects.
<p>In uncertain times, adaptability can be the difference between treading water and swimming. </p>
<p>Don’t tell young people that resilience is everything. Sure, hanging in when the going gets tough is sometimes what you need to do, but it’s also important to learn to adjust when circumstances change.</p>
<p>With hope and <a>gratitude</a>,</p>

<h1> Social Media Has Its Benefits </h1>
<h2> Gratitude and relying on social media for meaningful conversations are linked. </h2>
<li>The amount of time spent on social media isn’t the only thing that matters — so does how teenagers use it.</li>
<li>Don’t assume teens’ use of social media is always bad or superficial.</li>
<li>Instead, encourage young people to reflect on their own values when deciding how to use social media.</li>
<p>Today, I’ve asked Anne Maheux to share her Tip of the Week. </p>
<p>Most people would be better off quitting social media.</p>
<p>That’s what I believed. So five years ago, for the sake of my own happiness, I decided to get off social media for good. After a decade as a consistent user, I said goodbye to my Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat accounts.</p>
<p>Then the <a>COVID-19</a> pandemic hit. Simultaneously, my three best friends and I had to move. Once inseparable, we were now scattered across the country. I was living in a new state, unable to meet people, and <a>loneliness</a> began sinking in.</p>
<p>That’s when I started texting and using Zoom to talk to my best friends every day. At a time when it was hard to find silver linings, I was so grateful for digital media, which helped all of us battle the isolation.</p>
<a>problematic</a>, especially when it encourages teens to worry about the things they lack.
<a>gratitude</a> and relying on social media for meaningful conversations with friends went hand in hand. What gratitude did not predict was the total time on social media.
<p>In other words, the amount of time spent on social media isn’t the only thing that matters. So does how teenagers use it.</p>
<a>adolescence</a> is a time in life when connecting with peers is essential.
<p>Anne Maheux is a Ph.D. student in developmental and social psychology at the University of Delaware.</p>

<h1> Finding Flow: The Legacy of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi </h1>
<h2> Part 1: When work feels like play. </h2>
<li>When you’re in flow, you’re doing something at very high levels of both challenge and skill.</li>
<li>During flow, work is not just a means to an end; the process of work is its own reward.</li>
<li>Ask the young people in your life, "Have you ever been involved in something that attracts you so deeply that you don’t notice time passing?”</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Character Lab, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>This is the first in a two-part series on the legacy of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, who passed away in October.</p>
<p>Years ago, when I was still in graduate school, I went into the lab one Saturday to retrieve a book I’d left on my desk.</p>
<p>The halls and offices were dark and silent. Book in hand, I hurried back to the elevator.</p>
<p>And then, out of nowhere, appeared the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, dressed head to toe in black and holding a book of his own in one hand, a cup of coffee in the other.</p>
<p>We exchanged greetings. Then I asked, “What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>I knew Mike (which is what everyone called him) was visiting our lab for the summer. I just didn’t expect to see him there on a perfect, sunny weekend afternoon. </p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t I be here?” he replied with a smile. “There’s nowhere I’d rather be.”</p>
<p>Mike was a wonderful exemplar of the intrinsically motivated creators he studied. For instance, when he was at my stage—still in graduate school—he followed painters into their studios. In one of his last interviews, he recalled:</p>
<a>anxious</a> (too hard). You’re not worried. And you’re not apathetic.
<a>teenagers</a> who, in contrast, spend so many, many hours of their lives bored, anxious, worried, or apathetic.
<p>Like Mike, I believe schools are not places where most young people have a chance of finding flow. Instead, their work is often too easy, too hard—or just irrelevant to anything they really care about. </p>
<a>dreams</a> was that schools become havens of
<a>creativity</a>, places where young people might say with a smile, “Why shouldn’t I be here? There’s nowhere I’d rather be.”
<p>With grit and <a>gratitude</a>, Angela</p>

<p>When I was in 10th grade, biology was my least favorite subject. We spent a lot of time memorizing a bunch of meaningless words—variables, cause and effect, bacteria. What’s the fun in that?</p>
<p>“How was that possible in hospitals?” I asked myself. My boredom melted as I attentively watched a film about <a>Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis</a> and his discovery of how an ordinary chemical could eradicate a deadly transmissible disease.</p>
<a>memory</a> of being motivated by wanting to know why. How do we get children to experience what Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls flow, that feeling of being so involved in a task that time flies by?
<h3>Making science interesting for students</h3>
<p>For all students, it’s difficult to learn when the questions being asked are not personally meaningful. Biology started to become more interesting for me, for example, because the class discussion was about mothers.</p>
<a>stressed</a>. Or, if they’re too adept and can solve a problem easily,
<a>creativity</a>, we need to design meaningful problems that kids don’t know the answer to but have the capability to find out.

<h1> 3 Ways to Teach Yourself to Wait </h1>
<h2> There are a few tricks impatient people can learn to relax. </h2>
<li>The inability to tolerate uncertainty can be an important risk factor for psychological distress.</li>
<li>Research adopting a new behavioral approach shows that distress, not waiting, creates problems for impatient people.</li>
<li>Strategies for learning patience include paying attention to one's thoughts while waiting, practicing waiting, and rewarding successful waiting.</li>
<h3>A Simple Test Can Measure Your Own Intolerance of Uncertainty</h3>
<a>perfectionism</a>, obsessional beliefs, and the related quality of tolerance of ambiguity. The authors also tested out measures that they proposed would not relate to the PAT scores, such as compassion and
<a>empathy</a>, to rule out these competing tendencies. Finally, to examine whether PAT scores would relate to anxiety and depression, the authors administered tests of worry, health anxiety, anxiety about social interaction, and depressive symptoms.
<h3>How the Anagram Test Can Help You Become Better at Waiting</h3>
<p>The practical significance of the O’Bryan study, then, seems to lie in the distress component of IU. With this in mind, here are the three strategies you can use to get that distress under control:</p>

<h3>Testing the Narcissism-Aggression Relationship</h3>
<p>The 12-item aggression questionnaire used in the study (Diamond Magaletta, 2006) tapped into four underlying “phenotypes,” or categories: physical, verbal, anger, and hostile. Examples of each are as follows:</p>
<li>Physical: Given enough provocation, I may hit another person.</li>
<li>Verbal: I can’t help getting into arguments when people don’t agree with me.</li>
<li>Hostile: At times I feel that I’ve gotten a raw deal out of life.</li>
<li>Anger: I sometimes feel like a powder keg ready to explode.</li>

<h1> Psychology’s Dirty Data Secret and Why You Need to Know It </h1>
<h2> New research shows the surprising limits on psychology's knowledge about people. </h2>
<li>The problem of careless responding makes it hard to know how reliable online research studies are.</li>
<li>New methodologies are examining ways to separate people who lie and tell the truth in online surveys.</li>

<p>“I was 100 percent honest. I don't try to say I have skills that I don't. I realize my limitations and am honest about them in the interview.”</p>
<p>Compare this response to the category defined as using honest self-promotion:</p>
<p>“I drew <a>attention</a> to my high grades. I emphasized the perfect fit that existed between my program and the organization/position.”</p>
<p>Finally, you can see how both of these approaches contrast to what Charbonneau et al. call tailoring:</p>
<p>"I did research about the job and position and tailored answers to fit my values; I told the truth but made sure my answers were consistent with what I thought the interviewer wanted."</p>
<a>anxious</a> by administering a brief measure of interview-related anxiety. To test the idea that people using self-verification would be less likely to use deceptive impression
<a>management</a> tactics during their interview, the Canadian researchers included a measure of deceptive impression management with items such as “I told fictional stories prepared in advance of the interview to best present my credentials.”
<a>stressful</a> evaluation scenarios feel better when they can just, as the saying goes, “be themselves.” Also, given that self-verification and deceptive ingratiation (
<a>lying</a> to look better) were negatively correlated strategies, it’s possible that people’s anxieties are lower when they tell the truth because they don’t have to worry about being caught in a lie.
