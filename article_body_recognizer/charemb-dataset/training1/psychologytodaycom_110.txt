<h1> Are You Suffering from Compassion Fatigue? </h1>
<h2> What to do when showing compassion feels like a burden </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Compassion Fatigue? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>The Mayo Clinic Guide to Stress-Free Living</a>, "... we are inundated with graphic images of the unimaginable suffering of millions. We can fathom the suffering of a few, but a million becomes a statistic that numbs us."
<p>Signs of compassion fatigue include:</p>
<li>Feeling burdened by the suffering of others</li>
<li>Blaming others for their suffering</li>
<li>Loss of pleasure in life</li>
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>
<li>Physical and mental fatigue</li>
<li>Bottling up your emotions</li>
<li>Feelings of hopelessness or powerlessness</li>
<li>Frequent complaining about your work or your life</li>
<li>Beginning to receive a lot of complaints about your work or attitude</li>
<a>Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project</a>, "denial is one of the most detrimental symptoms" because it prevents those who are experiencing compassion fatigue from accurately assessing how fatigued and
<a>stressed</a> they actually are, which prevents them from seeking help.
<a>here</a>. Although the measure was originally developed for professional "helpers," it can provide important feedback about compassion fatigue,
<a>burnout</a>, and life stress for anyone who spends a good deal of time helping others.
<li>Enhance your awareness with <a>education</a></li>
<li>Accept where you are on your path at all times</li>
<li>Exchange information and feelings with people who can validate you</li>
<li>Clarify your personal boundaries—what works for you and what doesn't</li>
<li>Express what you need verbally, and</li>
<li>Take positive action to change your environment.</li>
<p>If your compassion fatigue score is low or average, that's good news, but it's important to take measures to protect yourself. To help prevent compassion fatigue, Dr. Sood recommends:</p>
<li>Limit the amount of daily news you watch or read about</li>
<li>Try to comes to terms with the fact that pain and suffering are realities of life over which we have little or no control</li>
<li>Be <a>grateful</a> for what is good in your life and in the world</li>
<li>Try to find some meaning in the suffering you see</li>
<li>If you must blame something, blame the situation, not the person</li>
<li>Show compassion to yourself by being kind, soothing, and comforting to yourself</li>

<a>motivation</a>, hopeless, and beyond caring. Burnout is a state of emotional and physical exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress.
<a>depression</a>, and in many cases post-
<a>traumatic</a> stress disorder, with no end in sight, we can see how someone can turn from thinking that their situation is temporary and resolvable to the helpless and hopeless thoughts that being
<a>burned out</a> can bring. Without some form of intervention, it’s easy to see how someone can remain stuck, apathetic, and lack any physical or mental energy to change their situation.
<a>psychiatric</a> patients, and with addicts, prisoners, and the abused and neglected are at high risk for burnout. Who else is most vulnerable to burnout? Those who:
<li>work exclusively with distressed persons</li>
<li>are charged with the responsibility for too many individuals</li>
<li>“personalize” their work</li>
<li>have an inordinate need to save people</li>
<li>are overly <a>perfectionistic</a> and idealistic</li>
<li>feel guilty about their own needs</li>
<li>work with others who are burned out</li>
<li>experience a lack of appreciation by superiors, coworkers, and maybe even family</li>
<li>have unrealistic goals that are daunting rather than motivating</li>
<li>experience “vicarious” trauma (traumatized by another person’s trauma)</li>
<a>vicarious trauma</a>. Let’s take a look at that now.
<li>Are you re-experiencing your own past traumatic events?</li>
<li>Are you experiencing a blunting of affect, a numbing, a loss of feeling, or a tendency to avoid reminders of a past traumatic event?</li>
<li>Do you have a heightened or exaggerated sense of being startled?</li>
<li>Do you experience dramatic alterations in your outlook or worldview?</li>
<li>Have you begun to demonstrate signs of antisocial behavior that were not present before working with your patient?</li>
<li>Are your basic interpersonal relationships becoming dramatically affected?</li>

<p>But other factors aren’t so clear. Therefore, let’s walk through four surprising causes of burnout. </p>
<p>Oftentimes, when bosses, teachers, or coaches hold high standards, we rise to the occasion and meet them. We achieve because someone believed we could. </p>
<a>study</a> of around 200 young British athletes found that when the kids engaged in what’s called
<a>perfectionistic</a> concerns—which is pushing themselves to reach the perceived sky-high standards of their coaches or parents—it put them on the fast track to burnout.
<p>However, we might also <a>burn out</a> working for a boss we perceive as being overly demanding. </p>
<a>conscientious</a>, take a step back and question how much of the pressure is overt, and how much comes from your own internal cattle prod.
<p>And what do you know? Turns out that pessimistic interpretations—seeing the glass as half empty—coupled solidly with burnout. </p>
<p>3. Mindless scrolling through social media.</p>
<p>After you’ve Marie Kondo-ed your clothes and pondered whether or not that table tennis set “sparks joy,” it’s time to turn to your online life at work. </p>
<a>A study in the Journal of Health Psychology</a> found that social media use at work tends to increase burnout in individuals who are lower in

<p>Believe it or not, that’s actually good news. With many causes, there are many ways to combat it. Even better? Not all of them involve a baseball bat and that unruly printer. </p>

<li>The big three signs of burnout are chronic exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy.</li>
<li>Burnout is more likely to happen when one has too many job demands and too few job resources.</li>
<li>To get a sense of meaning back from work, it is important to connect or reconnect to one's values. </li>
<p>Whether you feel like the salesperson in my story, or simply wondering how to make things better, here are some places to start:</p>
<h3>Evaluate how burned out you are.</h3>
<a>cynicism</a> (everyone annoys you and bothers you), and inefficacy (disengaging from work and having a “why bothers, who cares” mentality). Burnout is not an interchangeable word with everyday
<ul><li>How overwhelmed/exhausted did I feel?</li> <li>How critical/cynical did I feel?</li> <li>How productive did I feel?</li> <li>How much fun did I have? </li> </ul>
<p>The last question is about how engaged you felt about work, whether you experienced any positive emotions associated with your work or whether you felt “in the zone” and lost track of time because you were so into what you were doing.</p>
<h3>Know the source of your burnout.</h3>
<a>leader</a>, and strong relationships with colleagues.
<p>Here are some other ways to think about <a>resources</a>:</p>
<li>Are there aspects of your work that are consistently repetitive that you can codify into a written process, set of instructions, template, or flow chart?</li>
<li>Who are the people you can reach out to for support?</li>
<li>What are your strengths and how can you leverage them?</li>
<li>What are your sources of hope?</li>
<li>Have you been through a challenge like this before? If yes, what lessons can you apply now? Do you know someone else who has been through the same challenge who can help?</li>
<h3>Think about your wiring.</h3>
<a>burn out</a>. This has been the most important, though toughest aspect of my own burnout recovery.
<p>Do you recognize any of these themes?</p>
<li>If I can’t do something perfectly, then I shouldn’t do it at all.</li>
<li>I must always be in charge or things will go wrong.</li>
<li>Asking for help is a sign of weakness (I can figure this out on my own).</li>
<li>I can’t say no or else ___________________ (fill in the blank).</li>
<li>I have a very narrow definition of success or what success should look like, and then I compare myself to other people who match that definition.</li>
<li>I need to stay busy because that means I’m worthy or wanted; busyness is a badge of honor.</li>

<p>Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. According to the original definition of burnout, first coined in 1975 by Herbert Freudenberger, it features three key components:</p>
<li>Emotional exhaustion—the fatigue that comes from caring too much, for too long.</li>
<li>Depersonalisation—the depletion of <a>empathy</a>, caring, and compassion.</li>
<li>Decreased sense of accomplishment—an unconquerable sense of futility; the feeling that nothing you do makes any difference.</li>

<li>Signs of burnout include feeling overwhelmed, feeling emotionally disengaged, and feeling a general sense of cynicism.</li>

<h1> Mindfulness De-Viced </h1>
<h2> Why meditating without your phone (at least some of the time) is important. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: ddm</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>My only wish is that at least some of the time, we would be able to meditate (and live all parts of our lives) with our phones powered completely off.</p>
<a>locus of control</a>, responding to life from this grounded core rather than reacting to every single shiny thing that calls out for our
<a>attention</a>. Meditation is one of the best ways I know to develop this ability. *
<p>How to Meditate Without Your Phone</p>
<p>A. Assume a posture of alert restfulness.</p>
<p>C. Create space to simply be.</p>
<p>D. Direct your distractions.</p>
<p>This is a new skill, and you’re likely accustomed to only doing things that you are good at. Commit to letting go of evaluations about your performance. You are simply practicing, and there is no one to grade you.</p>
<p>F. Fidget with intention.</p>
<p>Now it’s time to get to it. Commit to accepting all the experiences that new endeavors entail (feeling silly, looking silly, etc.) and decide that doing a “good enough” job is plenty. Find your space and begin.</p>

<h1> Decluttering the Mind </h1>
<h2> Digital distraction can limit your joy. </h2>
<p>Everywhere I turn these days, someone is talking about “tidying up.” The first time this happened was when Marie Kondo’s famous book hit shelves, capturing the imagination of a country whose citizens love their stuff.</p>
<a>attention</a> is constant, it makes sense to me that the glimmer of hope provided by a “fail-proof” de-cluttering strategy is sweeping the nation. It appeals to our sensibilities. Removing extraneous objects, focusing on joy and
<a>memory</a> or thought you come across, touch it, hold it, ask yourself if it brings you joy. If it does, find a home for it. If it doesn’t, get rid of it.”
<a>recent poll</a>, Common Sense Media found that 50 percent of adolescents feel addicted to their devices. Twenty-seven percent of parents feel the same. Even for those who may not identify with the feeling of dependence that
<a>addiction</a> assumes, the average American is spending
<a>10 plus hours </a>a day with screens. This kind of engagement with the ever-expanding access to data, ideas, and experiences online is bound to create clutter—much of it unnecessary, and some of it downright harmful.
<a>boredom</a> tolerance, which is related to higher levels of

<p>Imagine breathing spaciousness into your body and exhaling clutter and <a>stress</a>. Enjoy this feeling, however fleeting, and return to it often. Decluttering takes time and practice, and both can reward you with a much more calm sense of being.</p>

<p>This reality ultimately reduces us (mostly the data we generate) to a commodity. And we pay the price as a result of this.</p>
<h3>The Algorithms That Shape Us</h3>
<p>When all we are fed is more of what we prefer, we become overly comfortable in our own little spaces.</p>
<h3>Expanding Our Interactions With Newness</h3>
<p>This can lead to our becoming judgmental of people and things that do not fall into the realm of our likes or preferences. The antidote? We need regular reminders, no matter how small, that:</p>
<li>Our preferences are not the end-all, be-all.</li>
<li>We are not the center of the universe.</li>
<li>Our digital experiences are shaped by our own habits rather than by objective, non-personally-tailored digital histories.</li>
<li>Newness, novelty, and diversity are important agents of growth.</li>

<h1> Necessary Self Care During COVID: Working Through Loss </h1>
<h2> What our losses really look like during COVID-19 — both big and small. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Understanding Grief </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from grief</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p><a>COVID-19</a> has both brought us loss, and at the same time, exposed our discomfort with <a>grief</a>.</p>
<p>Amidst the news-watching, hand-washing, and migrating of our lives to homes and screens, many of us haven’t been consciously aware of either. As a result, we are walking around with unresolved grief that we <a>fear</a> (or dread) feeling.</p>
<a>productivity</a> and autonomy are held in high esteem, we are especially hesitant to take time to feel, let alone to work through our emotions.
<a>guilt</a> regarding our own privilege in the face of the virus, or inexperience in naming and working through our feelings, this will prevent us from navigating the coming months well.
<a>anger</a>, and other complex emotions that present themselves.
<p>This is hard work, and some <a>education</a> can go a long way toward helping us accomplish this task. The first step is naming and understanding our grief and losses so that we can invite them and work them through.</p>
<a>trauma</a> are coded deeply in the brain and often require skilled help to work through. Sudden losses, as well as those that are largely outside of our control, have especially difficult contours to be navigated.
<p>This is not to say that the losses we choose or can see coming are easier to handle. They are simply different. In working through grief, it’s helpful to recognize and empathize with the time we did, or did not, have to be prepared.</p>
<p>Here are some rough categories of loss.</p>
<p>The loss of money and financial stability also fits here. These losses are often very personal and are often minimized by others. Remember what it was like to lose a beloved toy as a child and you’ll know what I mean.</p>
<p>During the time of COVID-19, object loss means:</p>
<li>Loss of income and financial security</li>
<li>The threat of losing one's home (for those who are losing jobs)</li>
<li>Loss of physical vocational or educational spaces to work within</li>
<li>Loss of ability to procure desired objects easily</li>
<li>Loss of autonomy in our objective spaces (if we work from home and now have others in our space)</li>
<p>Relational Loss: These losses are the kinds we identify most traditionally with grief. The death of those we love fits here, as do losses related to separations and/or divorces in <a>romantic relationships</a> or friendships.</p>
<p>During the time of COVID-19, relational loss means:</p>
<ul><li>Emotional distance in relationships due to increased physical separation </li> <li><a>Fear of death</a> (of self or others)</li> <li>The actual death of loved ones related to the virus</li> </ul>
<div> <h2>Grief Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Is Grief Something to Get Over?</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Grief at the Holidays</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>Roles related to professional and family life are also relevant. Even the idea of being a free and independent person is core to our sense of identity. Losses in this realm are often deeply felt and frequently go unacknowledged.</p>
<p>During the time of COVID-19, role/identity loss means: </p>
<li>Reduction of our scope of influence down to what can be achieved from home or technological means due to sheltering in place, thereby changing our sense of identity and some of our placeholder roles in the community</li>
<li>Loss of independence and freedom in how one’s time is spent</li>
<li>A threat to ones’ identity (for those who have not yet come to terms with their mortality, which the virus brings <a>attention</a> to)</li>
<li>Loss of any feelings of security that were based on wealth or position </li>
<a>confidence</a> in the capabilities that remain. This actually hurts us deeply. We need to feel and work with our feelings of limitations in order to move to a place of strength.
<p>During the time of COVID-19, physical loss means:</p>
<li>A decrease in options for moving about physically in the world</li>
<li>An increase in awareness of physical symptoms related to breathing</li>
<li>The possible introduction of panic symptoms in response to ambient <a>anxiety</a> (loss of control of physical manifestations of emotions)</li>
<a>dreams</a> and wishes. Losses relating to events we’ve been planning, or experiences we’ve been looking forward to, fall into this domain as well.
<p>During the time of COVID-19, personal loss means:</p>
<li>A major disruption of personal plans and experiences</li>
<li>Actual losses of plans and experiences that can’t be rescheduled (e.g: final semesters of senior years, baby deliveries without partners, etc),</li>
<li>A major shift in autonomy and personal agency in moving about in the world</li>
<li>Loss of the idea that we are invincible</li>

<p>And so… to weather the physical isolation, loss of human life, and loss of freedom in how we exist in the world that the next weeks will hold, it is imperative that we face our losses… no matter their size.</p>
<p>We must own and work through our grief. It is crucial that we name our big feelings and do what we can to work them through.</p>
<p>Once we’ve done so, it’s compassionate of us to help inspire those around us to do the same. Together, we can weather this storm…the one on the inside of ourselves and the one facing the world.</p>
