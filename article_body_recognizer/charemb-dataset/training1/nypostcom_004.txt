<h1> Woman left stunned by huge list of rules at Airbnb rental</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 20, 2021 2:35pm <div> Updated <div> December 20, 2021 4:16pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A woman was left stunned after being given a huge list of rules at her Airbnb – including how to use the shower curtain and using the wrong cups.</p>
<p>TikTok user Tiffany shared the video, which has been watched more than 1.6 million times.</p>
<p>She said in the video: “My most recent Airbnb host had a few controlling quirks.</p>
<p>“Before you even walk in, you get hit with a huge information guide on what to do and you have to take it off the door and hang it on the inside.</p>
<p>“Next is the amount of information given every moment after that, in every way possible, in every part of the room.</p>
<p>“My favorite of all the information pieces? She draws a picture of the remote control and teaches you how to use each button.</p>
<p>“There is even a note on how to use the vent and how to use the storage bins.”</p>
<p>Another thing she was doing wrong, according to the host, was using the wrong glass to drink from.</p>
<p>She continued: “One of my top favorites was […] using the wrong cup to drink my water.”</p>
<p>Even having a simple shower had its own rules.</p>
<p>Tiffany finished: “Another good one – you want to move the shower curtain left to right? No, it has to be right to left.”</p>
<p>She joked at the end: “Hope I slept here correctly.”</p>
<p>Many were left stunned by the number of rules.</p>
<p>One person wrote: “Wow? Maybe let’s not lend out our space if we’re control freaks.”</p>
<p>Someone else agreed: “It’s so stressful to stay there.”</p>
<p>Another person shared their own similar experience: “I left an Airbnb in Cleveland over a person like this – and got a refund. I’m here to be comfortable … not feel like I’m being watched.”</p>
<p>Some people thought some of the rules were helpful.</p>
<p>One woman wrote: “Ok, over the top obviously, but I would appreciate clear instructions on how to use things like the remote control.”</p>
<p>Someone else said: “This genuinely brings me comfort. I always feel like I’m not doing anything right so I appreciate the instructions.”</p>
<p>Another person added: “I promise they do that because they’ve been pestered with all those questions before.”</p>
<p>Tiffany later told people to “lighten up,” adding: “This is intended to be funny, I am not upset, I am not talking badly about her and do not harm her! Please!”</p>

<h1> Tourist stunned after NYC hotel room window opens into Times Square restaurant</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <h2>Contact The Author</h2> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 21, 2021 12:01pm <div> Updated <div> December 22, 2021 11:22am </div> </div> </div>
<p>This isn’t exactly a room with a view.</p>
<p>A tourist has been left stunned after checking into a New York City hotel room to find its window looked directly into an adjoining Times Square restaurant.</p>
<p>Desiree Baker booked a suite at the Cassa Hotel Residences in Midtown via Airbnb last week, with the listing photos showing a window which looked out over the city.</p>
<p>But the excited traveler was shocked when she pulled back the curtain in the room and discovered that there were diners seated in a restaurant on the other side of the glass.</p>
<p>Creepily, the patrons were seated just a foot away from Baker and had no idea that she was watching them. The glass on the restaurant side of the window is reflective, with diners believing it is nothing more than a mirror.</p>
<p>“When we got to the hotel it was dark and we just went to bed,” Baker explained in a TikTok video, which has been viewed more than 7 million times.</p>
<p>A person at the Cassa’s front desk told The Post that they “didn’t see how the story was newsworthy.”</p>
<p>“When we woke up there were blackout shades but I was so excited to see the view. I thought I was going to see a building, a skyline or whatever.”</p>
<p>She continued: “I roll up the shades and we are in a restaurant. We are fully in a restaurant. I can open up this window and fully join these people at their dinner, at their lunch,” she stated. </p>
<p>Baker filmed footage of the unsuspecting diners eating just inches from her inside the restaurant. Bizarrely, the room’s window even opens up so Baker is able to reach directly into the eatery itself.</p>
<p>“HOW IS THIS LEGAL you literally can not make this up. I can open the window and touch their table,” the tourist captioned the clip.</p>
<p>Baker reportedly reached out to the “Airbnb host” to complain about the situation, saying the photos and description of the room listed on the website did not match the reality.</p>
<p>However, Baker’s viral TikTok was viewed by Airbnb employees, who promptly emailed her to apologize for the situation and offer her a voucher for free accommodation in the future.</p>
<p>The Post has reached out to Airbnb and Baker for further comment. </p>
<p>The Cassa listing has been removed from the vacation rental website, but a different suite in the building appears to be listed for $153 per night. </p>
<p>Rooms on the Cassa’s official website are listed between $299 and $499 per night. It’s unclear whether that room can be rented through the hotel or whether it is a privately owned residence.</p>
<p>When asked about the video, Cassa’s front desk claimed to The Post that they were unaware of the viral TikTok.</p>
<p>“Did something bad happen?” the concierge asked. “Was there a crime?”</p>

<h1> Family transforms 1973 train caboose into runaway Airbnb hit</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> December 30, 2021 3:05pm <div> Updated <div> December 30, 2021 3:49pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>This train is going nowhere fast physically — but online, it’s off the rails in popularity.</p>
<p>Inspired by a row of cabooses he repeatedly drove past in 2016, Iowa-based carpenter Jim Dotzenrod made up his mind to acquire one and turn it into an Airbnb.</p>
<p>“I had to get the iron out of there, and after I gutted it I had to power wash it to get that diesel-fuel smell out,” Jim told Insider of the first steps in transforming the train into what is now: a wildly popular short-term rental.</p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 5</div> </div> </div>
<p>So she got to work on the smaller details: designing the black tile and oak wood floor, creating the caboose’s color motif, repurposing rake heads as wine-glass holder wall hangings and hunting for cute furniture. </p>
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 3</div> </div> </div>
<p>In all, the father-daughter team spent about six months on the project and finished in Nov. 2016 — and their work paid off.</p>
<p>The train, now listed as the CR Station Train Caboose on Airbnb, has proved a runaway hit, with folks flocking from across the state to stay in the $124-per-night accommodations. </p>
<p>Jim also rents out a restored barn on the platform. </p>

<h1> Kim Kardashian, Floyd Mayweather sued over alleged crypto ‘pump and dump’ scheme</h1>
<div> January 12, 2022 1:02pm <div> Updated <div> January 12, 2022 1:02pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Kim Kardashian and boxer Floyd Mayweather are facing a lawsuit alleging they misled online followers into buying cryptocurrency as part of a “pump and dump” scheme.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Jan. 7 in Los Angeles federal court, claims that the celebrities made “false or misleading statements” while promoting a crypto token sold by EthereumMax, or EMAX. </p>
<p>The company’s executives allegedly collaborated with the celebrity influencers to tout “the prospects of the Company and the ability for investors to make significant returns.”</p>
<p>“In truth, Defendants marketed the EMAX Tokens to investors so that they could sell their portion of the Float for a profit,” the suit adds.</p>
<p>Kardashian promoted an ad for EthereumMax last June on her Instagram account, when she had 250 million followers.</p>
<p>“Are you guys into crypto???? This is not financial advice but sharing what my friends told me about the ethereum max token!” Kardashian wrote.</p>
<p>The post included the hashtag #ad, signifying it was a paid endorsement, though it’s unclear how much Kardashian earned. </p>
<p>Research by Morning Consult found approximately one in five US adults heard about the crypto-themed post.</p>
<p>The lawsuit noted the value of EthereumMax tokens plummeted 98% from their peak by last July, within weeks of the celebrity endorsements. </p>
<p>The class-action complaint, which filed on behalf of New York resident Ryan Huegerich, seeks to represent individuals who bought the token between May 14 to June 27 of last year.</p>
<p>EthereumMax denied the allegations and said they “look forward to the truth coming out.”</p>
<p>“The deceptive narrative associated with the recent allegations is riddled with misinformation about the EthereumMax project,” the statement to Reuters said.</p>
<p>Representatives for Mayweather and Kardashian did not respond to request for comment on the lawsuit, Reuters reported.</p>

<h1> Tesla now accepts Dogecoin for some merchandise, Elon Musk says</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 14, 2022 11:55am <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 11:55am </div> </div> </div>
<p>The price of Dogecoin surged Friday after Tesla began accepting the crypto meme token in sales of merchandise and other products.</p>
<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a noted fan of Dogecoin, revealed the decision on his Twitter account.</p>
<p>“Tesla merch buyable with Dogecoin,” Musk wrote.</p>
<p>Dogecoin’s price jumped more than 11 percent to $0.19 cents per token as of Friday morning, according to CoinBase.</p>
<p>Tesla’s Giga Texas belt buckle costs 835 doge, or about $158 while the Cybertruck-inspired Cyberwhistle is selling for 300 doge, or roughly $57.</p>
<p>Musk first unveiled plans to accept Dogecoin in December. At the time, the billionaire told his Twitter followers that Tesla would “make some merch buyable with Doge see how it goes.”</p>
<p>Musk has repeatedly touted Dogecoin in recent months, once referring to himself as “The Dogefather” and infamously referencing the meme token during his appearance on “Saturday Night Live” last year.</p>
<p>Last February, Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of bitcoin in an effort to “diversify and maximize returns” on its cash. A month later, Musk announced that Tesla would accept bitcoin for vehicle purchases.</p>
<p>But Musk later reversed course on that decision, tweeting that Tesla would no longer accept bitcoin because of concerns related to the environmental impact of digital mining, which requires a massive amount of electricity.</p>
<h1> North Korean hackers reportedly stole $400M in cryptocurrency in 2021</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 12:28pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 12:28pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>North Korean hackers managed to steal a fortune in cryptocurrency in 2021, according to the results of a recent study.</p>
<p>Cybercriminals based in North Korea “extracted nearly $400 million worth of digital assets last year,” blockchain firm Chainalysis said in a preview of its 2022 Crypto Crime report released Thursday.</p>
<p>“Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out,” the firm added.</p>
<p>Lazarus Group, a hacker collective linked to North Korea’s main intelligence agency, is suspected of carrying out many of the attacks. The group is best known for carrying out the infamous Sony Pictures hack in 2014.</p>
<p>Chainalysis said it has identified $170 million in hacked cryptocurrency that North Korea has yet to launder. The funds purportedly derive from 49 separate hacks from 2017 to 2021.</p>

<p>Most of those users now report their funds have been restored to their wallets. </p>
<p>Crypto.com referred The Post on Tuesday to a series of tweets that said no customer funds had been lost and that certain of the company’s infrastructure that allows for withdrawals had been down for around 14 hours.</p>
<p>“Our team has hardened the infrastructure in response to the incident,” the Crytpo.com statement said, promising a full post-mortem after an investigation was complete.</p>
<p>One crypto user with nearly 350,000 Twitter followers, who posts under the handle @BENBALLER complained 4.28 ETH has been sold and questioned how a hacker made it past two-factor authentication which is supposed to make accounts more secure. </p>
<p>He later shared that his wallet had been refunded. </p>
<p>It’s still unclear how the hackers got past Crypto.com’s security. But one blockchain security firm, PeckShield Inc., alleged as much as $15 million worth of Ether had been stolen from users’ wallets.</p>
<p>The most recent snafu underscores the difficulty crypto companies face. According to data from security software firm ImmuneFi, more than $10.2 billion in crypto was stolen as hacks and scams remain prevalent in the world of cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h1> Activision Blizzard CEO once threatened to have his assistant killed: report</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> November 16, 2021 1:44pm <div> Updated <div> November 16, 2021 4:57pm </div> </div> </div>
<a>spilled into public view</a>.
<p>In 2006, one of Activision CEO Bobby Kotick’s assistants complained that he had harassed her and even threatened in a voicemail to have her killed, the <a>Wall Street Journal reported</a>, citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>“Mr. Kotick quickly apologized 16 years ago for the obviously hyperbolic and inappropriate voice mail, and he deeply regrets the exaggeration and tone in his voice mail to this day,” an Activision spokeswoman told the Journal.</p>
<a>explosive lawsuit accusing the company of fostering a culture that allowed for sexual harassment</a> that drove one female employee to suicide.
<a>allegations contained in the lawsuit</a> — even though the company’s board of directors maintained that they had never been briefed on any matters related to the allegations, according to the Journal.
<p>The former employee had reported the rapes to Sledgehammer’s human-resources department as well as other supervisors, but nothing ever happened, the Journal reported, citing the email. </p>
<p>The woman, by 2018, was threatening to sue, the report said, adding that within months Activision reached an out-of-court settlement with the woman, who had also filed a police report. </p>
<p>Kotick failed to tell the board about the alleged rapes or the settlement, the Journal reported, citing people with knowledge of the board, though the alleged assailant Javier Panameno was fired.</p>
<p>A group of Activision Blizzard employees staged a walkout on Tuesday and called on Kotick to resign.</p>
<p>In a statement, an Activision spokesman did not dispute any of the factual allegations in the Journal’s investigation.</p>
<p>Later on Tuesday, Activision Blizzard’s board said it stands by Kotick.</p>
<p>The Journal’s investigation sent Activision’s stock stumbling. It closed down more than 6 percent at $66.14 on Tuesday and has tanked more than 28 percent over the past six months amid turmoil at the company.</p>
<p>The report comes after the state of California sued Activision in July for subjecting female employees to “constant sexual harassment,” among other allegations. </p>
<p>The lawsuit immediately sent waves <a>ripping across the male-dominated video game industry</a> and the broader tech-entrepreneur community. </p>
<p>Whether Kotick failed to properly disclose the allegations to directors, other employees and investors is the focus of that investigation, according to the Journal. </p>
<p>But in the weeks following the California lawsuit, Activision scrambled to respond to backlash. </p>
<p>In October, for example, Kotick, one of the highest-paid CEOs of any publicly traded company with a pay package in 2020 valued at $154 million, <a>requested a pay cut to $62,500</a>. </p>
<p>But the request was only made after the Journal approached him about the story published Tuesday.</p>
<p>And in August, Activision named longtime employee Jennifer Oneal to be Blizzard’s co-head, making her the first woman ever to lead a studio at the company. </p>
<p>But a month later, she said in an email to Activision’s legal team that “it was clear that the company would never prioritize our people the right way.”</p>
<p>In the email, Oneal said had been sexually harassed earlier in her career while at Activision. She also said that she was paid less than the other Blizzard co-head, who was a man. </p>
<p>“I have been tokenized, marginalized, and discriminated against,” wrote Oneal, who’s Asian-American and gay.</p>
<p>She also described a 2007 Activision party that she attended with Kotick in which dancers performed on stripper poles and a DJ encouraged female attendees to drink more, according to another person who was present.</p>
<p>The company announced earlier this month that Oneal is leaving Blizzard at the end of the year. </p>
<p>The Journal report also alleged that Kotick protected at least one male employee who had been accused of sexual harassment.</p>
<p>Dan Bunting, co-head of Activision’s uber-successful Treyarch studio, had been accused by a female employee of sexually harassing her in 2017 after drinking heavily, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the incident.</p>
<p>An internal investigation recommended that he be fired, but Kotick overruled the decision, the Journal noted. Instead, the report said Bunting was given counseling and allowed to remain in his role.</p>
<p>“After considering potential actions in light of that investigation, the company elected not to terminate Mr. Bunting, but instead to impose other disciplinary measures,” an Activision spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Bunting left the company after the Journal asked about the incident.</p>

<h1> California sues Activision Blizzard over ‘constant sexual harassment’</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> July 22, 2021 9:43am <div> Updated <div> July 22, 2021 3:43pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>That includes “having to continually fend off unwanted sexual comments and advances by their male co-workers and supervisors and being groped at the ‘cube crawls’ and other company events,” the suit claims.</p>
<p>In a statement, Activision Blizzard claimed the suit was filled with “distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past.”</p>
<p>“We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family,” the company said.</p>
<p>While the suit contains frequent references to unnamed Activision employees, it calls out Blizzard president J. Allen Brack by name as being aware of and enabling misconduct.</p>
<p>The “World of Warcraft” team was especially prone to misconduct, according to the suit. </p>
<p>“Afrasiabi was so known to engage in harassment of females that his suite was nicknamed the ‘Crosby Suite’ after alleged rapist Bill Crosby,” reads the suit, in an apparent reference to Bill Cosby. </p>

<h1> Grand Theft Auto maker to buy FarmVille creator Zynga in $11 billion deal</h1>
<div> January 10, 2022 1:22pm <div> Updated <div> January 10, 2022 1:23pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The deal, one of the biggest in the sector, will create a gaming powerhouse spanning console, PC and mobile devices and comes as people increasingly gravitate toward smartphone games.</p>
<p>Take-Two, also known for adventure game “Red Dead Redemption,” offered $9.86 per share for the deal, representing a 64% premium to the last closing price of Zynga shares. Including debt, the acquisition is worth $12.7 billion.</p>
<p>“It’s a bombshell deal … Zynga was on the list of potential MA transactions for a long time in the video game business,” said Serkan Toto, CEO of videogame consulting firm Kantan Games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Electronic Arts bought Glu Mobile for $2 billion last year. Zynga itself has made a string of acquisitions in the past two years, including Echtra and Chartboost.</p>
<p>The mobile gaming sector is expected to reach a market size of $116.4 billion by 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 11.2% from 2019 to 2024, according to gaming market data firm Newzoo.</p>
<p>“It is a big price tag for a company that has not consistently produced profits or new blockbusters,” said Erik Gordon, professor at Ross School of Business, University of Michigan.</p>
<p>Take-Two has $2.7 billion financing from JPMorgan and intends to fund the rest with cash and proceeds of a new debt issuance.</p>
<p>It expects about $100 million in annual cost savings within the first two years, and more than $500 million in net bookings over time when the deal closes in mid-2022.</p>
<h1> Why Google is warning Android users to update Microsoft Teams ASAP</h1>
<div> January 1, 2022 2:09pm <div> Updated <div> January 1, 2022 2:09pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Google has sent Android users an essential warning about the Microsoft Teams app.</p>
<p>A bug was discovered in the Android version of the Microsoft Teams app last month which could block calls made to emergency numbers.</p>
<p>Initially, it was thought only calls made to the US emergency number, 911, were being blocked but now Google has revealed calls to other emergency numbers such as 999 in the UK and 112 in Europe may also be affected.</p>
<p>Although a full fix is coming to Android phones in the January 2022 update, Google has issued an email to all users urging them to update their Microsoft Teams app.</p>
<p>Only certain <a>Microsoft</a> Teams users are still at risk, with those who have updated the app after December 10, 2021, safe from the bug.</p>
<p>“The issue is caused by an unintended interaction between the Microsoft Teams app and the underlying Android operating system. Please visit the Google Play Store and update to the latest version of Microsoft Teams immediately.”</p>
<p>The message added: “If you have updated the Microsoft Teams app after December 10, 2021, you can ignore this email.”</p>
<p>The most recent version of Microsoft Teams for Android was released on December 18, with the build 1416/1.0.0.2021195305.</p>
<p>To update the app, head to the Play Store and if an update button is showing on the Microsoft Teams app listing then click on it.</p>
<p>Many users may have already activated automatic updates on their devices and so will already have the latest patch installed.</p>
<p>The dangerous bug won’t affect all users as certain pre-existing conditions have to be met for the glitch to kick in.</p>
<p>The bug problem was first highlighted on <a>Reddit</a>, with one user detailing how their Pixel phone prevented them from calling an ambulance for their grandmother when she appeared to have a stroke.</p>
<p>When the Reddit user dialed 911 their phone got stuck after it had run once.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the user was able to get to a landline when the emergency happened so they were still able to call for an ambulance.</p>
<p>The Reddit user wrote: “I had to call an ambulance for the grandmother on Friday as she appeared to be having a stroke. I got off a phone call with my mom, and proceeded to dial 911 just by typing and calling on my Pixel.</p>
<p>“Sadly I couldn’t tell the person on the other end what apartment I was in, or what the actual emergency was as I was unable to speak to a human.</p>
<p>“As my phone had clearly just been working from a phone call perspective, my best guess is the extra step of trying to send my location caused it to freeze. It then prevented me from hanging up and trying to call any phone number again.</p>
<p>“Luckily my grandmother is of the generation that still has a landline, otherwise I would have had to restart my phone, wait for a reboot, and then attempt to call emergency services so they could get people over ASAP.”</p>

<div> January 2, 2022 8:07am <div> Updated <div> January 2, 2022 8:07am </div> </div> </div>
<p>With the New Year comes not only a long list of resolutions, but lots of new gadgets — and you’re going to want to get your hands on these.</p>
<p>We got the scoop on 2022’s hottest tech items from the latest work tablets to impressive household robots.</p>
<p>Check out our list for the top 5 tech gadgets below.</p>
<h2>1. The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 2-in-1 laptop </h2>
<p>The new Microsoft Surface Pro 8 2-in-1 laptop (starting at $999) is marketed as the “most powerful Pro” to date.</p>
<p>Microsoft says they created the laptop-tablet combo with the modern workplace in mind, so features include a powerful 11th-Gen Intel Core processor, a kickstand that can be adjusted to any angle, and a generous 16-hour battery life.</p>
<p>The tablet is also incredibly lightweight, starting at just 1.96 pounds, and has a Surface Slim Pen 2 storage.</p>
<p>Other fun features include being able to hook it up to your X-Box, as well as being able to draw directly on the screen.</p>
<h2>2. The Amazon Astro household robot </h2>
<p>Amazon’s Astro household robot (starting at $999) was released a few months ago, but the hype surrounding this gadget has not died down.</p>
<p>The robot, which comes equipped with everyone’s favorite A.I. assistant, Alexa, was created to monitor your home when you’re not around.</p>
<p>Astro features “intelligent motion” to navigate around your home, and go where you ask it to.</p>
<p>Your handy home robot will also send you notifications if it detects an unrecognized person or certain sounds when you’re away.</p>
<p>Another plus: You can hook Astro up to your Ring system for more added features.</p>
<h2>3. The DJI Mavic 3 drone</h2>
<p>If you want a drone but are worried about flying one, then the DJI Mavic 3 drone (starting at $2999) is for you.</p>
<p>The flying robot has a pro-level Hasselblad camera system and is able to sense objects in all directions, preventing collisions (and saving you lots of money).</p>
<p>The Mavic 3 Cine model also features Apple ProRes 422 HQ encoding for premium-quality footage.</p>
<h2>4. The HTC VIVE Flow VR Glasses </h2>
<p>These light and foldable glasses take VR down from a heavy bulky headset to a compact and portable frame.</p>
<p>The VIVE Flow VR glasses (starting at $499) were made with one goal in mind: To promote wellness and help you find your happy place through mindfulness.</p>
<p>All you have to do to find your center is connect to your phone via Bluetooth and enter your virtual haven.</p>
<h2>5. The Capstone Smart Mirror </h2>
<p>The Capstone Smart Mirror (starting at $799) will make getting ready in the morning fun.</p>
<p>This gadget lets you check the time, look up directions, play music, and more, all while checking yourself out in the mirror.</p>
<p>You can also search YouTube’s platform directly from the touchscreen display — imagine doing your makeup in the mirror while actually watching the beauty tutorial at the same time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you can pair your Bluetooth speaker, headphones, or another device to listen to music.</p>
<h1> Microsoft orders probe of Bill Gates harassment allegations</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 10:48am <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 10:48am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Microsoft has tapped an outside law firm to probe its handling of workplace sexual harassment, including allegations against its founder Bill Gates, the company revealed on Thursday.</p>
<p>“Our culture remains our number one priority and the entire Board appreciates the critical importance of a safe and inclusive environment for all Microsoft employees,” Microsoft Chairman and CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We’re committed not just to reviewing the report but learning from the assessment so we can continue to improve the experiences of our employees,” he added.</p>
<a>Wall Street Journal</a> reported that Microsoft’s board launched an investigation after an engineer said she had a sexual relationship with Gates. A separate
<a>New York Times</a> report said Gates asked another employees out on a date immediately after she delivered a presentation he attended.
<p>Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board in March 2020, citing a desire to focus on philanthropic endeavors.</p>
<p>The board’s 2019 investigation was not completed following his exit. Microsoft said Gates’ decision to step down was unrelated to the allegations.</p>
<p>Microsoft said the Arent Fox firm “has not previously been involved in representing Microsoft in employment matters, nor has it done a significant amount of work for the company in the past.”</p>

<h1> FuboTV expects record quarter after doubling subscriber base in 2021</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 13, 2022 4:39pm <div> Updated <div> January 13, 2022 4:39pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>FuboTV, the sports-oriented streaming service, says it expects to report record revenue and subscriber growth in the most recent quarter.</p>
<p>The New York-based company said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to range between $215 million and $220 million — a more than 100% increase from the same period the year before.</p>
<p>For the entire year, fuboTV expects its total revenue to fall somewhere between $622 million and $627 million — an increase of at least 138% year-over-year.</p>
<p>The company’s results exceeded expectations. It was projected that its revenue from Q4 would range between $205 million and $210 million while its total revenue would fall somewhere in the $612 million to $617 million range.</p>
<p>FuboTV’s advertising revenue from Q4 is expected to surpass the $25 million mark – a 90% improvement from the same period last year.</p>
<p>For 2021, fuboTV’s advertising revenue topped $100 million.</p>
<p>The company is also expected to announce that its base of paid subscribers has exceeded 1.1 million — or 100% higher than the figure from the same period last year.</p>
<p>FuboTV is expected to end the quarter with more than $375 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash.</p>
<p>“In the fourth quarter, we continued to deliver triple digit revenue growth, alongside operating leverage, through the efficient deployment of acquisition spend and the retention of high quality customer cohorts.” </p>
<p>Founded in 2016, fuboTV has made strides in the ultra-competitive live streaming space that includes YouTubeTV, Hulu Live TV, Sling TV, DirecTV Stream, and Philo.</p>
<p>Last summer, Gandler <a>told CNBC</a> that his goal is for fuboTV to have a customer base of 5 million subscribers by 2026.</p>
<p>Shares of fuboTV fell 7% on Thursday. By the closing bell on Wall Street, fuboTV was trading at $13.60 per share.</p>
<p>In October 2020, fuboTV raised $183 million in its initial public offering. Since then, it has pursued an aggressive investment strategy.</p>
<p>Last March, it acquired Chicago-based online sportsbook Vigtory. The following month, it bought exclusive streaming rights to the 2022 World Cup qualifying matches of the South America Football Confederation.</p>
<p>In November, fuboTV acquired Molotov SAS, a French streaming company, for $190 million.</p>
<p>Last month, the Professional Fighters League, a season-based MMA organization, <a>announced a deal with fuboTV to stream its PFL Challenger Series</a> beginning next month.</p>

<h1> Joe Rogan is a ‘menace to public health,’ 270 doctors and experts tell Spotify</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 10:56am <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 11:57am </div> </div> </div>
<p>Shock jock Joe Rogan is hitting all the wrong notes on Spotify. </p>
<p>A group of 270 experts have penned an open letter addressed to the Swedish audio streaming service condemning the top-rated show, “The Joe Rogan Experience.”</p>
<p>The letter also asked the streaming music service to “establish a clear and public policy to moderate misinformation on its platform.”</p>
<p>“Spotify has a responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation on its platform, though the company presently has no misinformation policy,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The experts wrote that Rogan has a “concerning history of broadcasting misinformation, particularly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.”</p>
<p>“The Joe Rogan Experience” is one of the top-rated podcasts globally, especially since joining up with Spotify in 2020 in a<a>n estimated $100 million deal</a>. The show draws about 11 million listeners per episode.</p>
<p>“Mass-misinformation events of this scale have extraordinarily dangerous ramifications,” they wrote in their letter.</p>
<p>Fellow signee Katrine Wallace, epidemiologist at University of Illinois Chicago School of Public Health, told Rolling Stone that Rogan was “a menace to public health,” particularly for espousing anti-vaccine rhetoric.</p>

<a>not been recommended by the Food and Drug Administration</a> as a treatment for COVID-19.
<a>considerable backlash</a>, even by staff at the digital music company who wished not to be associated with the controversial podcaster over similar concerns as those expressed in the recent open letter.
<a>Vice reported at the time</a>. “And some of them want Rogan removed because of things he’s said in the past.”
<a>quietly un-publish</a> several highly contentious episodes of “The Joe Rogan Experience” from their platform, such as those featuring interviews with former

<h1> Merger of Hollywood talent agencies CAA and ICM draws DOJ scrutiny</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 14, 2022 12:50pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 12:50pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The Department of Justice is probing a major Hollywood deal that’s poised to disrupt the talent agency ecosystem and entertainment industry, according to a report. </p>
<p>The DOJ is scrutinizing CAA’s acquisition of ICM, two major Hollywood talent agencies that represent some of Tinseltown’s biggest stars, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<p>CAA, the agency that reps Brad Pitt, George Clooney and Scarlett Johansson, revealed in September that it would acquire ICM, home of Shonda Rhimes, Alec Baldwin and Uma Thurman, noting that the deal would close by the end of 2021. </p>
<p>But a new inquiry by the DOJ over how the merger between two major agencies would impact the Hollywood landscape, has delayed the deal, which is now expected to close in the second quarter of this year, anonymous sources told THR late Wednesday.</p>
<p>CAA, ICM and the DOJ did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>If a deal between CAA and ICM closes, the talent agency landscape would have three major players in Endeavor-owned WME, CAA and UTA, along with smaller competitors like APA, Gersh and Paradigm.</p>
<p>The DOJ’s antitrust division, led by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, has already interviewed top executives at CAA and ICM as well as some outsiders like APA CEO Jim Gosnell, a source told THR. </p>
<p>The probe may have been launched after Hollywood unions such as the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA voiced their concerns, the source said.</p>
<a>“very confident” </a>the deal would go through. But the DOJ antitrust division and the Federal Trade Commission has been critical of the high volume of MA activity under President Biden.
<a>sued</a> to block ViacomCBS’ sale of book publisher Simon Schuster to Penguin Random House, citing concerns that the deal would give “outsized influence over who and what is published, and how much authors are paid for their work.”

<h1> ESPN’s Greg McElroy challenges Kayvon Thibodeaux to Wonderlic after Alabama dig</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 1:22pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 4:03pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>We may have a brewing battle of the wits.</p>
<p>Greg McElroy, a college football analyst at ESPN and former quarterback at Alabama and for the Jets, challenged top 2022 NFL Draft prospect Kayvon Thibodeaux to a Wonderlic duel.</p>
<p>This challenge stems from Thibodeaux ripping the academics at Alabama. </p>
<p>Thibodeaux played defensive end for Oregon and had seven sacks this past season. Many mock drafts have him going No. 1 overall to the Jaguars. </p>
<p>“If I would have went to Alabama … I don’t know if my degree would mean anything,” he said.</p>
<p>McElroy, who played for Alabama from 2007-10 and was the Jets’ backup quarterback in 2012, was taken aback by the perceived condescension. He addressed it on WJOX’s “McElroy Cubelic in the Morning.”</p>
<p>The NFL is shedding the Wonderlic from its pre-Draft protocols this year. For years people have wondered if the intellectual aptitude test has any relevance as to how players will ultimately perform on the football field. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, it would be fascinating to see McElroy and Thibodeaux partake in this challenge. </p>

<p>In 2018, Turpin, then a brave 17-year-old, escaped her Perris, Calif., home and made the call to authorities, who discovered that she and her siblings were starved, living in squalor and, in some cases, shackled to beds.</p>
<p>“I was telling them everything. We don’t go to school. We live in filth. We starve. And all the stuff,” <a>she told Diane Sawyer in November</a> about the fateful 911 call.</p>
<p>Their story of child abuse and torture horrified the public and her parents were given a <a>life sentence behind bars</a>. </p>
<p>But on social media, Turpin, who expressed excitement upon being verified by TikTok this week, seems to be focusing on more positive pursuits.</p>

<h1> NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover runs into another snag: pebbles</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 4:02pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 4:02pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>NASA’s Perseverance Mars rover has run into another snag on its mission to find evidence of ancient microbial life. </p>
<p>In continuing to collect Martian rock and regolith samples, which will eventually return to Earth, the rover encountered a “new challenge.” </p>
<p>“Seems some pebble-sized debris is obstructing my robotic arm from handing off the tube for sealing/storage,” the Perseverance team tweeted earlier this month. </p>
<p>Now, NASA’s Mars 2020 mission team says it has a plan to deal with the obstruction from the rover’s bit carousel: operational sequences developed and tested over the previous weekend and last week.</p>
<p>With the imaging, the team embarked on a maneuver with the robotic arm she “never imagined we would perform – ever.”</p>
<p>The contents of its latest cored-rock sample – the sixth rock core – will be returned to the surface of Mars in what Trosper called a “fairly straightforward process.” </p>
<p>The team sent commands up to the rover’s robotic arm on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>Further commands were to be sent Friday to order the rover to do two rotation tests of the bit carousel that will execute this weekend. </p>
<p>She said the team expects the imagery and data from the two tests to be sent to Earth by Jan. 18.</p>
<p>Perseverance also ran into an issue during its first sampling attempt in August.</p>
<h1> Mark Zuckerberg defies critics with latest Meta board member</h1>
<div> January 17, 2022 4:43pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 4:43pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg appears to be sending a message with the latest addition to Meta’s board: The company is going to keep doing things his way — activists, politicians and concerned shareholders be damned. </p>
<p>Zuckerberg’s company said last week that Tony Xu, the co-founder and CEO of unprofitable food delivery giant DoorDash, would become the newest member of its 10-person board of directors. </p>
<p>“They’re birds of a feather,” Melanie Sloan, a government and corporate ethics attorney, told The Post.</p>
<p>“No matter how many shareholders Facebook may have, they will never be able to outvote Mark Zuckerberg,” Sloan said. </p>
<a>Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</a> and
<a>hordes of angry lawmakers on Capitol Hill</a> may complain. 
<p>“You’ve just put somebody who is intent on maintaining total control of his company onto the board of another company with another founder who wants to maintain total control of his own,” Sloan said. </p>
<p>Proponents of founder control and dual-class shares argue that empowering successful founders like Zuckerberg and Xu is not an issue since they build the companies in the first place. </p>
<p>A whopping 46.2% of tech companies that went public in 2021 used dual-class share structures — an all-time high and more than double the percentage over just five years ago, according to <a>Ritter’s research</a>. </p>
<p>In addition, Xu’s appointment could help Meta satisfy a recently passed <a>California law</a> that requires corporate boards to include some directors from minority groups, Ritter said. </p>
<p>The DoorDash CEO could also teach Zuckerberg a thing or two about defeating pesky politicians and activists. </p>
<a>passed with 58.6% of the vote despite the objections of Joe Biden</a>, labor unions and legions of activists.
<p>As Meta seeks to stave off politicians on both sides of the <a>aisle who want to regulate the company</a>, the lessons Xu learned pushing Prop 22 could help an <a>increasingly defiant Zuckerberg</a> mobilize voters against his enemies. </p>

<p>“You’re the ’62 Mets of this league!”</p>
<p>How many organizations have three iconic teams like that, stretching from their sport’s highest highs to its dregs-iest dregs?</p>
<p>It is why the Mets’ recent spate of catch-up is not only welcome, it is long overdue.</p>
<p>“We’re about to be 60 years old,” Keith Hernandez said Wednesday. “Think about that.”</p>
<p>Instead, Cohen made Hernandez’s year.</p>
<p>And a lot of his fans’ year, too.</p>
<p>When he left the Mets after the ’89 season, he was honored to see David Cone assume his old number, 17, less enamored when other, lesser strangers began wearing it. He could laugh about that Wednesday.</p>
<p>“That’ll have to be posthumous,” he said. “Around here, ‘history’ is a dirty word.”</p>

<h1> Deion Sanders: Games against top football schools are the ‘ultimate sellout’</h1>
<div> December 28, 2021 4:40pm <div> Updated <div> December 28, 2021 4:40pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Deion Sanders does not plan on having Jackson State compete against Power Five schools anytime soon. </p>
<p>‘I’m going to go to these various schools, get my butt kicked, but I’m walking out of there with $750,000 or a million dollars. That’s not worth it to me. To me, that’s the ultimate sellout to children.”</p>
<p>Jackson State is an FCS school. While they have played some FBS schools like TCU and UNLV previous to Sanders’ tenure, the coach said the competitions would not only lead to an embarrassing loss, but a string of injuries.</p>
<p>Sanders said if he had offensive and defensive lines to withstand the physicality, he would compete against bigger schools.</p>
<p>Eisen followed up by asking his former NFL Network colleague if not being able to get those linemen to Jackson State means he will one day jump ship to a bigger school. </p>
<h1> Deion Sanders’ disaster of a charter school nears shutdown</h1>
<div> January 27, 2015 9:34am </div>
<p>DALLAS — A school co-founded by Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders could have its charter revoked Tuesday by state education regulators amid money and management trouble.</p>
<p>T. Christopher Lewis, board president of Uplift Fort Worth, which holds the Prime Prep Academy charter, told The Dallas Morning News that a default judgment was expected by the Texas Education Agency in Austin.</p>
<p>“We as a board fought as hard as we could to turn the ship around,” Lewis said. “At the end of the day, we just couldn’t overcome the obstacles.”</p>
<p>The Dallas school founded in 2012 is in financial straits after years of management disputes that led to a state takeover. Prime Prep could close in the middle of the semester if found insolvent.</p>
<p>Texas Education Commissioner Michael Williams earlier this month announced that he would appoint a board of managers to run the school, effectively placing it under state control.</p>
<h1> Why it’s hard to see MLB spring training, season starting on time: Sherman</h1>
<div> January 15, 2022 10:26am <div> Updated <div> January 16, 2022 1:15pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>My gloom, though, has been based on the last time MLB and the players had to work out a deal to return to play. That was 2020 amid the first wave of COVID-19 and after the sport was shut down that March.</p>
<p>5. The sides still have to decide whether there will be a Rule 5 draft this year (it normally takes place at the Winter Meetings, which were scrubbed due to the lockout).</p>
<p>Plus, MLB will still have to learn what will be allowed in Canada for Blue Jays games this year.</p>
