<div><div><p>A few months after taking the reins of one of the smaller Smithsonian museums in July, Ngaire Blankenberg removed 18 Benin Kingdom Court Style works from their cases, saying their presence was harmful.</p></div></div>
<p>“We need to develop trust and transparency among our core constituents in order to build a 21st-century African art museum,” she said. “A huge impediment to that conversation is to have stuff you shouldn’t have.”</p>
<div><p>A new Smithsonian initiative aims to help America deal with the history and legacy of racism</p></div>
<div><p>The panel is examining past collecting standards through a moral rather than legal lens. The new guidelines will require Smithsonian museums to dig into the circumstances behind their acquisitions and make an effort to address any wrongs.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The review will bring the entire institution in line with the practices he put in place at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which <b/>opened in 2016 with Bunch as its founding director.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is a moment to say, ‘We can be better,’ ” Bunch said. “By accepting our troubled past, we can point to a better future.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>works stolen by Nazis from Jewish families; in the early 2000s, Italian officials used the courts to force the return of antiquities.
<div><p>Hobby Lobby’s forfeited Gilgamesh tablet is headed back to Iraq, and authorities hope it will be a warning to smugglers</p></div>
<b> </b>and protests around the country that led to
<div><div><p>The display was meant to celebrate the royal court’s rich artistic tradition of metalworks, including bronze plaques and sculptures, and ivory carvings that date to the 1300s.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That historical context was not enough for Blankenberg.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My strategy is to create a space of recognition for global Africans — a place where we feel belonging, kinship and inspired by art as defined by us,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian’s first Black leader, on the challenge of making it ‘a place that matters’</p></div>
<div><div><p>Buyers also worked regularly with dealers and often relied on their reputations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Buyers didn’t ask that many questions before agreeing to a sale,” said Victoria Reed, curator for provenance at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. “Today, we see there is a tremendous risk to that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is giving voice to individuals, communities and institutions that have not always had a voice,” Kreamer said. “Engagement with communities will be part of curatorial practice going forward.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Blankenberg, the question of legal ownership is not the central concern.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The important thing is not so much this option or that option but who gets to decide,” she said. “Is there an equitable conversation between source communities and museums to decide what happens to the objects?”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Because of Smithsonian-wide staff shortages related to the region’s coronavirus surge, the National Museum of African Art is open only on Saturdays and Sundays until Jan. 19.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Smithsonian is on a massive search for six new museum directors. Their work could reshape the institution for generations.</p></div>

<div><h1>Your game plan for a home renovation project </h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Kevin Brasler</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>December 27, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Most HGTV shows give us the idea that home remodeling projects take place in 30 minutes and only include just one token problem right before a commercial break (“Chip, there’s mold behind the molding!”).</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Brasler: How to find a reliable floor refinisher at a reasonable cost</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Start by asking and answering basic questions.</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The key is developing a wish list and then weighing it against what you’ll probably pay to fulfill it. Will you really derive $25,000 of enjoyment from that remodeled bathroom? How often will you use a $50,000 home theater in the basement?</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Get design help and put together a serious plan.</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Both architects and house designers charge by the hour or use a fixed price (preferable), depending on the level of service, or bill a percentage of the final construction price if they’re supervising and directing the entire affair.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Vet potential contractors.</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Interview candidates carefully.</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Get several proposals and bids.</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The lesson? Get several bids. Also, don’t assume that there’s any relationship between price and quality. Many contractors do great work at low prices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Carefully evaluate proposals.</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Look for detailed pricing, reasonable payment schedules, descriptions of warranties and flexible terms that accommodate inevitable changes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Do the deal.</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>More Brasler: Is a home warranty a waste or a smart buy?</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Remain vigilant.</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Make sure you’re available for questions and deal promptly with surprises: No contractor can foresee every problem; when a questionable extra pops up, look for a middle ground that both you and the contractor can live with.</p></div>
<div><div><p>If work isn’t done to your satisfaction, don’t pay until the contractor makes it right.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Your condo building’s reserve fund may not be enough. Here’s why. </h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ilyce Glink and Samuel J. Tamkin</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>December 29, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Q:</b> I’ve been reading your column about condominium reserves, and it’s made me think that most condominium associations should have higher reserves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>All owners would continue to contribute equally toward the $1 million needed annually to fund the $10 million project in year 10. What do you think?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A:</b> You make an excellent, well-reasoned point. The counterpoint is condo unit owners aren’t always logical and don’t always prefer to play the long game, especially when cash is tight.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But let’s start with the biggest issue: calculating the amount of cash a condo property will need to have on hand for staff and ongoing regular maintenance, irregular projects and special one-time repairs or replacements.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What to know about a condo’s finances and building safety before buying</p></div>
<div><div><p>But even armed with that information, boards often have a hard time convincing homeowners to pay more in assessments. Some homeowners can’t afford it. Others want to sell and have the new owner pick up the cost.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Matters: Desperate to get rid of that timeshare? The sad truth is, you may have few options.</p></div>
<p>When a home buyer reviews an association’s financials, they may see a number that looks pretty good: $1 million. But if there are 1,000 units, those reserves represent only $1,000 per unit. That may be too low for a development of that size.</p>
<div><div><p>At the end of the day, we agree with your thinking: More buildings should have more in reserves than they may have now. Thanks for your question.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>After last week’s dip, mortgage rates returned to the level they had been much of the past two months.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aside from last week and the one week in November when it dropped to 2.98 percent, the 30-year fixed average has hovered around 3.1 percent for the past eight weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yields rise when investors are selling Treasurys. When bond prices fall, yields go up because investors are demanding more in return for holding them.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>How to turn an ordinary kitchen subway backsplash pattern on its ear </h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Stephanie Brick</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022 at 9:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>More Brick: How to transform your home into an office or school and back again</p></div>
<div><div><p>There are primarily two ways to add a little spice to this classic backsplash. The first is by deviating from the gloss white; the second is by deviating the installation pattern on the wall.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then, of course, there are nearly limitless options for colors: Why go white when you can go <i>anything</i>? From off-white to bold primaries, subway tile is available in a rainbow of colors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Besides going bold with the color, texture or grout, there is another easy way to dress up these ubiquitous tiles with one simple, but significant, change: their installation pattern.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Half-offset</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The classic subway tile pattern in kitchen backsplashes is half-offset. This horizontal pattern is also one of the most popular in brickwork (and is known in masonry as a running bond).</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>1/3-offset, continuous</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>1/3-offset, zipper</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>For a variation on the classic that has movement but not direction, the 1/3-offset, zipper, pattern is a symmetrical variation of the half-offset.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Diagonal half-offset</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Such a simple change but remarkable difference! Angling the classic pattern by 45 degrees creates a little drama and direction in your tile design.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Stacked</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>A stacked pattern draws the eye to the uniformity of the tile. This pattern leans more contemporary and creates clear, uninterrupted lines across your backsplash.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Brick: Why play it safe? How to go bold with color in your home.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Herringbone</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>A classic in its own right, herringbone (either standard or diagonal) is a complex pattern with natural movement that can be rotated for a sense of vertical direction instead of side-to-side.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Vertically half-offset</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a contemporary style, the vertical half-offset disrupts the status quo with clear vertical or horizontal movement, depending on how you orient the tiles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>General vertical patterns</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Classic subway tile patterns are horizontal, but a vertical stacked pattern or vertical half-offset pattern offers a modern accent. Consider rotating any of the aforementioned horizontal patterns by 90 degrees to see a fresh take!</p></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Real Estate</a></div></div><div><h1>Many home insurance premiums are rising faster than inflation</h1></div><h2>Lumber prices, supply chain disruptions and climate change are driving costs upward.</h2></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Kathy Orton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 26, 2021|Updated January 4, 2022 at 12:47 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Ken Hoagland was surprised to see his monthly mortgage payment increase recently.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since 2017, premium rates are up 11.4 percent on average, which means they are rising faster than inflation<b> </b>— and insurance experts expect that the rates will stay high.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“From everything I know about homeowners’ risk, I expected those numbers to be higher,” said Dale Porfilio, the chief insurance officer at Triple-I. “Honestly, I would say they still should go up further.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Most mortgage lenders require borrowers to carry a homeowners insurance policy. According to a recent analysis by Bankrate.com, the average homeowner spends about 1.91 percent of their household income on home insurance.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Your home renovation may require an insurance update. Here’s why.</p></div>
<div><p>Opinion: Biden is hiking lumber tariffs at the wrong time</p></div>
<a>National Association of Home Builders</a>. “Domestic lumber production has really not increased in the United States. The economics of lumber tariffs when we’re trying to fight inflation don’t make any sense.”
<a>survey by the NAHB</a> of its members in May found shortages of materials more widespread than at any time since NAHB began tracking the issue in the 1990s. Appliances were rated the items most in short supply, followed by lumber.
<a>winter freeze in Texas</a>, which led to the state’s largest non-hurricane weather loss event.
<a>Hurricane Ida</a>, which hit in late summer, is expected to rank among the five costliest hurricanes in U.S. history. It is too soon to calculate the losses from the
<a>tornadoes that ripped through eight states</a> in early December.
<div><p>Cold, heat, fires, hurricanes and tornadoes: The year in weather disasters</p></div>
<div><div><p>Porfilio said insured damage from tornadoes, hurricanes, severe storms, wildfires and other natural disasters has reached $82 billion this year, bringing the total from 2017 until now to more than $400 billion.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What should homeowners do after a tornado?</p></div>
<div><div><p>When a natural disaster affects a wide area, the demand for materials and labor puts pressure on prices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Because of the rash of natural disasters, some insurance companies are offering extended replacement cost coverage at an additional cost.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Whether the increases are small or large, there are ways to save money on homeowners insurance premiums. Hoagland opted to increase his deductible from $1,000 to $2,000, which reduced his homeowners insurance by about $500 annually.</p></div>
<div><p>Eight tips for buying homeowners insurance</p></div>
<p>On its website, Triple-I lists <a>12 ways in which homeowners can lower the cost of their premiums</a>, including shopping around, bundling home and auto insurance, making the home more disaster-resistant and improving the home’s security.</p>
<div><div><p>Although 2021 may turn out to be an exceptional year for natural disasters and rising inflation, it could be some time before homeowners insurance premiums moderate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div>clarification</div><p>The paragraph about replacement cost should have mentioned that homes must be rebuilt according to current building codes, which may cost more. </p></div></div></div>

<div><h1>Here’s how inflation could affect your next real estate move</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By David Mount</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 7:03 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>If you have bought, sold, invested or otherwise participated in the economy lately, you have likely seen the forces of inflation in action.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But in plain terms, what does inflation really mean, and how will it impact the already crowded housing market? Here are some considerations to help you understand whether you’re making the right moves to hedge against inflation:</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What is inflation?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Inflation refers to a decrease in the purchasing power of money, reflected in an increase of the price of goods and services in the economy. So, as inflation ticks up, every dollar you earn loses value and therefore impacts your ability to spend.</p>
<div><p>More Mount: What to consider before investing in the real estate market</p></div>
<div><div><p>The resulting housing market inflation amounts to a basic case of supply and demand at work, adding fuel to an already raging fire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How does inflation impact the market?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>For homeowners:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For investors:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For prospective investors:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Not surprisingly, the circumstances for prospective investors in an inflationary market are very different from those for existing owners. With that reality in mind, the most important factor this group must consider is timing.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Mount: Should you tap into your home equity to fund your retirement?</p></div>
<p>Housing prices have seen historic rises over such a short period of time. And while that may not be inherently concerning, it underscores the importance of understanding your expected investment time horizon and adjusting your plans accordingly.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>So what’s next?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>As with any big financial decision, it’s important to keep your guard up for economic risks. However, smart planning, time management and seeking advice from a financial adviser can help keep you and your money safe.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Why putting your home in a ‘Transfer on Death’ deed might be a good alternative to a will or living trust</h1></div>

<div><div><p><b>Q</b>: I’m a 60-year-old single woman who hopefully has all my finances in order. I have beneficiaries on all of my accounts and a will, but I don’t have a trust.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Considering the cost of setting up a trust is expensive and the only things I would have to put in it are my house and car, my financial guy suggested setting up a ‘Transfer on Death’ instrument for my home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What do you think about this? It seems simple enough to fill out a form and register it. Thanks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A</b>: When it comes to transferring assets, there are a lot of ways to do it, some more cost-effective than others.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There are a variety of trusts that could be written to solve the problem. Some, like generation-skipping trusts, might be more complicated than a living trust that is used to simply assist in transferring assets.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Matters: Another example of why homes you see in online photos may not be what you get</p></div>
<div><div><p>You might need help from an attorney, title agent or someone knowledgeable about the title to prepare the TOD for your home.</p></div></div>

<p>When it comes to your car, you might be able to use a TOD. While you don’t need to file the form, you’ll have to work with the agency that handles vehicle registrations to change the registration to name the person under the TOD.</p>

<div><h1>Face-to-face meetings with neighbors may be the best ways to address street parking disputes </h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Ilyce Glink and Samuel J. Tamkin</div></div> </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<b>Q</b>: No improvements have been made to our street in 21 years. It is my understanding that the road is sliced down the center by an imaginary dotted line. The homes on each side own the street to that centerline and are responsible for maintaining it.
<div><div><p>Does this also mean that parking on each side of the street is restricted to the property owner who owns that side of the street?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>A</b>: You pose a question that we haven’t seen before. And, while it seems simple, it is actually more complicated than it seems.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, our answer will make a few assumptions; but please understand there are myriad variables that could change the answer. Still, let’s take it from the top.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In most parts of the country, the local municipality (city, town or village) owns the roads and streets. In private subdivisions, the homeowner’s association generally owns the roads and streets.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Matters: Desperate to get rid of that timeshare? The sad truth is, you may have few options.</p></div>
<div><div><p>We’re going to assume you live in an area where the streets are private and the responsibility for the creation of rules and maintenance of the streets falls to the homeowners.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Well, usually in these situations, the subdivision plat (which is the document that affects all of the parcels of land on the street or in the area) shows an easement that lists the burdens and benefits for all of the parcels of land.</p></div>
<div><div><p>So, look at the documents that govern your use of the street. Hopefully, there is enough detail to determine what rights everybody has to park on the street.</p></div></div>
<div><p>More Matters: Planning to move? You still might benefit from refinancing your home.</p></div>
<div><div><p>These issues still aren’t resolved.</p></div></div>
