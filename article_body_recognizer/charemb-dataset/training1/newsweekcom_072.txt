<p>A woman's face was slashed at a bar after she asked a patron if he had proof of COVID-19 vaccination, according to police.</p>
<p>The Seattle <a>Police</a> Department said in a press release that the incident happened on Monday at around 5:15 p.m. local time at a bar in the city's Pioneer Square.</p>
<p>"Medics treated the bartender for a laceration to her face," the press release said.</p>
<p>According to police, the suspect reportedly left the area shortly after allegedly slashing the bartender in the face. The Seattle Police Department said that they believe the suspect "may have gotten on a light-rail train and left the area."</p>
<p>In Kings County, where Seattle is located, residents aged 12 and older are required to show proof of COVID-19 vaccine for indoor public spaces like bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Ogilvy told KOMO News that when she asked the man if he had his COVID-19 vaccination card, he told her that he has received the shot but didn't have his proof of vaccine card.</p>
<p>"And I was like OK but you need to have proof of it," Ogilvy said. "He ended up basically saying 'You're picking on me, I'm not going to deal with it.' That's when he started getting hostile."</p>
<p>Some of Ogilvy's coworkers attempted to deescalate the situation, according to KOMO, but the man remained angry and allegedly fought back with the broomstick.</p>
<p>"He swung the stick as hard as he could at my face, so not only did it puncture me, he also slit me," Ogilvy said.</p>
<p>While speaking with the local news outlet, Ogilvy said that she doesn't agree with having to enforce the county's mask mandate.</p>
<p>"Why am I getting hurt?" she said. "Why am I the one who has to control this?"</p>
<p>Seattle Police Department public information officer Detective Patrick Michaud told Newsweek that the suspect has yet to be found and police are still actively searching for him.</p>
<p>According to Michaud, the Seattle Police Department has experienced a few similar incidents in the past with residents fighting back against COVID-19 vaccine mandates but he noted that there has been "nothing widespread."</p>

<div> News Coronavirus <a>Office</a></div>
<p>A U.K. judge has ruled that COVID-19 health and safety concerns regarding a return to the work place cannot be considered a belief and are not protected by the Equality Act of 2010.</p>
<p>This could mean that employers are granted stronger powers against employees who do not want to return to the office or workplace in the U.K.</p>
<p>Sitting at an employment tribunal hearing in Manchester, Judge Mark Leach also ruled workers could have their pay docked for disobeying calls back to in-person working.</p>
<p>The Times reported that the ruling came after a woman, whose identity was not revealed, brought a discrimination claim on the grounds that being forced to return to work was a breach of the Equality Act 2010.</p>
<p>Judge Leach rejected the claim after the woman refused to return to work after the restrictions from the first lockdown implemented in March 2020 in the U.K. were lifted.</p>
<p>During the hearing she said she "genuinely held a 'philosophical belief'" regarding her safety and returning to work to do her job. She said in July 2020 that she decided "not to return to the workplace on the grounds of health and safety."</p>
<p>As the world now deals with the more contagious Omicron COVID-19 variant, some employers have again asked employees to work from home where possible.</p>
<p>Quoting attorney Robin Samuel, the report said: "An employer usually can discipline workers for violating its attendance policy but there are exceptions to that rule. Putting hesitant employees on leave may be a better choice than firing them."</p>
<p>According to the report under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), employees can refuse to work if they reasonably believe they are in imminent danger.</p>
<p>However, these employees must have a reasonable belief that there is a threat of death or serious physical harm likely to occur immediately or within a short period of time for this protection to apply.</p>
<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>Fact Check: Has COVID Testing Declined Under Joe Biden?</h1><div> By Darragh Roche <time>On 12/29/21 at 11:44 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Former President Donald Trump criticized President <a>Joe Biden</a>'s handling of the ongoing COVID pandemic as part of a lengthy statement issued on Tuesday, December 28, as the end of the year approaches.</p>
<p>Trump, who was president when the pandemic began, accused Biden of a "testing failure" <a>that he called a "national scandal</a>."</p>
<p>The former president's statement comes after the Biden administration announced <a>they would purchase 500 million at-home COVID tests</a> and distribute them for free to Americans who want them.</p>
<p>In a statement shared by his spokesperson Liz Harrington, former President Trump's office said "By January 20, 2021 the United States had conducted over 250 million tests."</p>
<p>"Coronavirus testing peaked in January 2021 with approximately 2 million Americans getting tested a day," Trump's statement went on.</p>
<p>"Since President Trump left office, <a>testing has DECLINED on Joe Biden's watch</a>. Biden has presided over a STAGGERING DECAY of America's testing infrastructure, leaving the United States UNPREPARED for the Omicron Surge."</p>
<p>The statement added: "The number of tests performed dropped to just 420,000 per day during the summer as the Delta variant began to spread."</p>
<p>That figure is higher than the 250 million tests mentioned in Trump's statement.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the total number of COVID tests reported as of December 25 was 707,737,786. This represents a significant increase rise in tests since January 20 when comparing the two data sets.</p>
<p>New daily tests began to decline in February and fell significantly in the spring and summer months. The decline in testing largely coincided with the uptake of COVID vaccinations beginning in February and continuing throughout the summer.</p>
<p>On July 5, the seven-day moving average of new tests was 424,594â€”that is likely the figure referred to in Trump's statement. It is the lowest seven-day moving average of tests in Johns Hopkins' analysis.</p>
<p>Daily testing numbers began to increase gradually after July 5â€”there were 3,530,573 new tests on September 27â€”as the Delta variant spread, and they have spiked again amid the surge in the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>On November 29, there were 3,000,466 new testsâ€”exceeding January's daily peak. New daily tests on December 20 stood at 3,697,859.</p>
<p>Trump's statement is correct that the number of daily tests declined after he left office on January 20 and that testing originally peaked in that month.</p>
<p>Total new daily tests have now surpassed January's peak on more than one occasion, but, under Biden, the seven-day moving averageâ€”a good measure of overall testing performanceâ€”has not surpassed its January 15 peak.</p>
<p>The statement is also correct when it says around 2 million tests a day were being performed in January. The current seven-day moving average of daily tests is also lower than it was on January 20.</p>
<p>It is also true that daily testing declined significantly during the summer, though daily testing has generally been increasing in recent weeks amid the Omicron surge.</p>

<div> News Pfizer <a>Poll</a></div>
<p>A new poll found unvaccinated Americans were much less likely to say they would take Pfizer's COVID-19 treatment pill than those who have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>The survey by the health website Stat and the Harris Poll reported that 48 percent of unvaccinated respondents said they would be "not at all" or "very unlikely" to take Pfizer's pill if a health professional prescribed it to them.</p>
<p>But vaccinated people were much more open to taking the pill, according to the poll. Ninety-one percent of vaccinated respondents said they would be "very" or "somewhat" likely to take the pill if a health professional prescribed it.</p>
<a>FDA</a>) on December 22. However, 48 percent reported they had read "nothing at all" or "not too much" about the medicine.
<p>Data from a clinical trial showed that Paxlovid reduces the risk of hospitalization or death by 88 percent, compared with a placebo, among patients who take the medicine within five days of experiencing COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>Stat reported the Harris Poll survey was conducted before the FDA authorized the Merck pill.</p>
<p>After canceling his sold-out show in Vancouver, podcast host Joe Rogan said he doubts he would have even been able to get into Canada because he is not vaccinated against COVID-19.</p>
<p>Rogan, who had COVID-19 in September, was scheduled to appear at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, British Columbia, on April 20.</p>
<p>Under current travel requirements, unvaccinated foreign nationals, which include Americans, are barred from entering Canada for leisure or optional purposes even if they test negative for the virus.</p>
<p>However, provincial COVID protocols could present a greater challenge for the unvaccinated podcast host.</p>
<p>The venue also announced earlier this month that capacity would be reduced to 50 percent beginning December 20, following the implementation of the province's new restrictions.</p>
<p>In the new podcast episode, Rogan added that he didn't "trust that Vancouver's not going to follow suit along with what Toronto did, where they cut capacity to 50 percent."</p>
<p>Ticketmaster, the event organizer, has confirmed on its website that the show has been canceled. Ticket holders will get a refund within 30 days, the site says.</p>
<p>A post on Rogan's Facebook page says the show has been rescheduled for October 24.</p>
<p>Rogan has been publicly outspoken about vaccine mandates, repeatedly saying he is not vaccinated but is not anti-vaccine.</p>
<p>He has also slammed Canada for its handling of the pandemic, saying that "Canada's f***ed" because of the country's lockdown measures.</p>
<p>"They're so locked down, and I don't understand why they think that's good," he said on the April 28 episode of his podcast.</p>
<p>Rogan has continued to refuse to get vaccinated after recovering from disease, citing his natural immunity.</p>
<p>Health experts have warned that individuals who have had COVID-19 are susceptible to reinfection.</p>
<p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that unvaccinated individuals who have had COVID-19 are twice as likely to be reinfected, compared with vaccinated people.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the Rogers Arena for comment but did not hear back before publication.</p>
<p>Three of the six lions in the lion habitat at the Audubon Zoo in New Orleans, Louisiana tested positive for COVID this week, the zoo announced in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>Arnold, an adult male, Asani, a yearling male, and Kali, an adult female, were tested after they were observed coughing and showing nasal discharge.</p>
<p>The other three lions in the exhibit are being tested following the positives.</p>
<p>Zoo officials are not sure how the lions contracted the virus, but the most likely explanation is an asymptomatic zookeeper was contagious while in the habitat, the statement said.</p>
<p>The lions appear to have contracted the illness despite safety precautions like a vaccine requirement for zoo employees, and the policy requiring those working in the habitats of animals that can contract the virus to wear N95 or KN95 masks.</p>
<p>The statement also said guests should be confident they are not at risk of catching COVID from animals while at the zoo, according to <a>WWL TV in New Orleans</a>.</p>
<p>"All symptoms have been intermittent and mild," so no medication has been needed, MacLean said in a statement relayed by a zoo spokeswoman.</p>
<p>"We are prepared to start treatments if signs or animal comfort warrant," he said.</p>
<p>"Audubon Zoo has always had biosecurity protocols in place and adopted heightened protocols around susceptible animals at the onset of the pandemic last year," it said.</p>
<p>The lion exhibit that opened in 2019 has a pretend rail station where the lions "can get fairly close to the public," and barricades have been set up to keep people farther away from the rail cars' glass windows, MacLean said.</p>
<p>The zoo <a>began vaccinating</a> its gorillas and orangutans in October, but the company making the animal vaccine against COVID-19 has not yet sent doses for the zoo's big cats and for mustelids such as otters, the news release said.</p>
<p>Louisiana's <a>COVID-19</a> death toll edged toward 15,000 on Wednesday.</p>
<a>doubling</a> in the week that ended Sunday, have risen nearly 47% since then to 659, the Louisiana Department of Health
<a>dashboard</a> indicated. The state said the Omicron variant accounted for more than 88% of cases.
<p>The O<a>micron variant</a> caused an estimated 88.5 percent of all cases diagnosed during the week that ended on Christmas, <a>up from 84</a> percent the previous week, the state Health Department said. The estimates are preliminary, it emphasized.</p>

<p>A Republican Pennsylvania county official has died due to complications related to COVID-19, according to local media.</p>
<p>William "Bill" Ames, a commissioner for Lebanon county, passed away at the age of 81 on Tuesday, December 28, after being hospitalized with COVID, according to news outlet LebTown. He announced that he had caught the virus on Thursday, December 16.</p>
<p>Ames, who had served his county since 2012, had at times taken a stance against COVID restrictions there and pushed successfully for a reopening of businesses earlier than the rest of the state back in 2020.</p>
<p>The push to move Lebanon into the "yellow phase" of its pandemic restrictions and out of tougher restrictions took place in the spring of 2020, with a resolution signed in May.</p>
<p>The resolution, signed by Ames as well as Commissioner Chairman Robert Phillips, both <a>Republicans</a>, stated that the commissioners emphathized with families who wanted to return to work and "minimize the economic devastation on their finances."</p>
<a>LebTown</a>. He told the news outlet that "Lebanon County's citizens are more than capable of figuring out for themselves whether masks are useful or not."
<p>But <a>Ames also said</a> in 2020 that he was encouraging everyone who went to vote in the June primary elections to wear a <a>face mask</a>.</p>
<p>Local leaders have expressed sadness following Ames' passing this month.</p>
<p>"Bill gave everything thought and consideration, and had the wisdom and courage to change his mind if warranted," chief clerk and county administrator Jamie Wolgemuth told LebTown.</p>
<p>And Jo Ellen Litz, another commissioner of Lebanon County, described Ames as "a straight shooter," noting that "you never had to guess where he stood."</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, December 29, funeral arrangements were still being made, LebTown reported. It is unclear whether or not Ames was vaccinated against the disease at the time of his passing.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health on Wednesday reported a new high in terms of single-day COVID cases during the pandemic according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, with 17,520 additional cases.</p>
<p><a>Cases are on the up</a> across the U.S., with the <a>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> reporting a seven-day moving average of 277,241 new cases on December 28.</p>

<p>As a result, we all go into 2022 facing health and economic uncertainty. This is the definition of self-defeating policy. But it is not too late to change course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in most low- and middle-income countries, vaccination rates languish in the single digits. Across Africa, for example, just over 8 percent of the continent's population has been fully vaccinated, according to WHO data.</p>

<a>push</a> for vaccinating 40 percent of people in all countries by the end of 2021, and 70 percent by mid-2022, it is likely that between
<a>70 and 80 countries</a> will fail to meet that 40 percent target.
