<p>Relaxation helps resolve or prevent the development of stress-related physical or psychological symptoms. Mechanisms for this effect may involve:</p>
<li>Teaching the athlete how to remain calm rather than developing a negative physical or psychological reaction when faced with a <a>stressful</a> event.</li>
<li>Breaking the cycle of stress causing the development of physical or psychological symptoms, which lead to increased stress.</li>
<p>Rather than thinking of winning a competition as the only positive outcome, athletes can learn to focus on improving their personal performance during each practice and competitive event.</p>

<h1> Tired of Traditional New Year's Goals? Try Kindness. </h1>
<h2> A values-based approach for starting the new year. </h2>
<li>If you are feeling too overwhelmed right now to focus on major New Year's resolutions, much less simple decisions, you are not alone. </li>
<li>In the face of uncertainty, focusing on small behaviors and choices that align with our values can help us cope.</li>
<li>Simple, small acts of kindness, toward ourselves and others, can help us cultivate well-being in more impactful ways than we may realize.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Nadeem/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>a recent survey from 2021</a> on
<a>stress</a> in America shows that one in three Americans is having trouble with basic
<a>decision-making</a> due to stress of the pandemic.
<p>With that being said, for many people, this may not be the time for grandiose New Year goals, when sometimes just getting through the day and week may feel like an enormous challenge. </p>
<a>resilience</a> even in the face of that which we can’t control. Doing so not only is beneficial for our well-being but also has a ripple effect on the well-being of those around us.
<h3>The Transformative Power of Kindness</h3>
<a>anger</a>, irritation, and frustration melted away and I was able to move on and cope much better with the situation before us.
<a>depression</a>, the small gesture by a neighbor to help another person cope with unbearable loss, the kindness of one friend that made the difference for another person in surviving a terrible middle-school experience, and the list goes on.
<h3>The Science of Kindness</h3>
<a>The Kindness Cure</a>, some of the ways that kindness can increase our well-being include reducing symptoms of depression,
<a>anxiety</a>, and posttraumatic stress disorder; improving
<a>body image</a>; lessening symptoms of
<a>chronic pain</a>; promoting longevity; increasing resilience; and strengthening relationships.
<h3>A New Year Serving Suggestion</h3>
<li>Choose a quality that aligns with who you want to be and one of the values that matters to you (e.g., kindness, compassion, self-compassion, courage). </li>
<li>Look for little opportunities to carry this quality forward into your day and week. Remind yourself that while these gestures and acts may feel small to you, they may have more power than you realize. </li>

<p>The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle. Yet a cognitive analysis revealed decision requirements that had previously been unknown—showing the power of the cognitive dimension.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The RPD Model: Criticisms and Confusions</a></h2> <p>The Recognition-Primed Decisions (RPD) model has been around for more than 20 years. It's time to correct some of the misunderstandings that have crept in.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Mental Model Matrix</a></h2> <p>Many of us think that mental models describe how something works, but good mental models also describe how it fails, how to workaround the failures, how to anticipate confusions.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Pre-Mortem Method</a></h2> <p>How can you get team members who have just collaborated on building a plan to seriously and genuinely imagine ways that the plan can fail? The pre-mortem method does just that.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How to Harness Curiosity</a></h2> <p>Curiosity is a powerful force. But what is it? How does it work? What interferes with it? And, most important, how can we harness it?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>The Psychology of Political Polarization</a></h2> <p>One reason for political polarization may be our decision strategy for making choices by trying to get one option to dominate the other on all the dimensions that matter to us.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Substitution Trap </a></h2> <p>The heuristics and biases community asserts that people unconsciously replace hard problems with easier ones, but it is the analytical decision researchers who fall into this trap.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Anomaly Detection: The Art of Noticing the Unexpected</a></h2> <p>An anomaly is a violation of expectancy. However, the analytical community uses it to describe statistical outliers, which misses the cognitive dimension.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Sketchy Sketches</a></h2> <p>Biosketches describe our virtues and our achievements. But they can mislead readers who assume we have skills and strengths that we lack. Hence: the anti-biosketch.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Common Confusions About Teaching</a></h2> <p>Five common claims, such as trying to accommodate learning styles and trying to speed up the learning curve, don't hold up well when carefully evaluated. </p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>AIQ: Artificial Intelligence Quotient</a></h2> <p>As artificial intelligence affects more aspects of our lives, we'll need help understanding how these systems reason.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Second Wave of Critical Thinking</a></h2> <p>Critical thinking doesn't just rely on a systematic analysis of evidence. It can also encourage imagination, creativity, intuition, insight, and curiosity.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Is COVID-19 a Black Swan Event?</a></h2> <p>Black swan theory highlights the futility of trying to anticipate rare and disruptive events. But black swan theory may interfere with our ability to cope with such events.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Is Teaching Overrated?</a></h2> <p>Many people assume that good teaching equals good learning. But that's a flawed assumption. We can get the most learning by encouraging an active stance of self-explaining.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>NDM and COVID-19</a></h2> <p>The COVID-19 pandemic is overwhelming traditional methods for training, planning and applying decision support tools. Fortunately, the NDM community has some promising tools.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Can We Train Perspective-Taking Skills?</a></h2> <p>Perspective-taking skills are critical for all kinds of human interactions. Yet they are rarely trained. Here are five suggestions for how they might be strengthened.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Power to Read Minds</a></h2> <p>A team of researchers recently concluded that perspective taking had no value in accurately understanding how other people think. Here's why they might be wrong.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Connection Between Intuition and Expertise</a></h2> <p>A famous economist argues that our society emphasizes gut feelings over expertise. However, he has the issues backward: the two are related, not opposites.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Business Doesn’t Have to Be a Lottery</a></h2>
<p>Executives at a printing plant had trouble deciding whether to buy an expensive piece of equipment. They consulted with the lead operator and were stunned by what he told them.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Second Singularity</a></h2> <p>The second singularity is the crossover point at which machine intelligence overtakes human expertise, perhaps in the very near future if we fail to preserve our expertise.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How Did the Nationals Win the World Series?</a></h2> <p>The Washington Nationals overcame great odds to win the World Series—but we shouldn't fall for the simplistic explanations we hear on TV.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Getting Crunched by the Numbers</a></h2> <p>Data analytics can sometimes misrepresent what is really going on in complex situations. To judge human performance, we need to understand the person's intentions. </p> </div> </div>

<h1> Re-Thinking Expertise: The Skill Portfolio Account </h1>
<h2> Time to move past a simplistic unitary model. </h2>
<li>In contrast to a unitary concept of experts, a Skill Portfolio account identifies separate skills that experts possess and blend as needed.</li>
<li>Experts may have five types of skills: perceptual-motor, conceptual, management, communication, and adaptation skills.</li>
<li>These skills are relatively independent. Not all experts possess each skill, and not all skills are needed for any task or domain.</li>
<a>discrimination</a>, motor skills and the use of tools. Think of the way dentists use mirrors to repair cavities. A dentist can drill skillfully because the perceptual-motor skills of mirror handling have been highly automated.
<a>anxiety</a>, training gaps in the assistant, etc.
<a>link</a> to a fuller discussion of the Skill Portfolio account, using COVID-19 as an example.)
<p>The Skill Portfolio account illustrates how shallow it is to claim that new developments will make expertise obsolete. Such claims rely on the unitary model of experts instead of a differentiated model. </p>
<p>What is becoming obsolete is the description of expertise that is grounded in the study of domains that are relatively stable.</p>

<h1> This One Behavior Boosts Well-Being More Than Socializing </h1>
<h2> Examining the effects of the "flow" state. </h2>
<ul> <li>Cultivating daily flow-like experiences is associated with greater well-being.</li> <li>Parenting is highly correlated with flow-like moments. </li> <li>Unfinished work tasks sap one's joy and decreases chances for flow. </li> </ul>

<a>self-compassion</a>, two scientific ways of authentically caring for ourselves. Unlike self-indulgence, when we practice self-care, we are deliberate in our actions and focus our
<a>attention</a> on practicing healthy habits.
<p>In this post, we’d like to introduce a third intervention to help foster well-being: cultivating more flow-like experiences into our lives. </p>
<h3>Being in “flow” isn’t the same as "going with the flow"</h3>
<a>Martin Seligman</a>, is best known for the psychological concept of “flow,” an optimal experience and state of being in which we are so deeply immersed in the moment that time goes by and nothing else seems to matter to us.
<p>When interviewed, these individuals usually describe these moments as being in a state synonymous with the characteristics of flow. </p>
<p>While it may look easy when we witness a flawless performance on the mat or the stage, or the mental gymnastics of the genius mathematician, what we don’t see are all the countless hours of effortful practice behind the scenes. </p>
<p>Flow doesn’t just naturally happen. It takes work and focused attention. </p>
<p>To quote social psychologist Chris Peterson, “If we know what we know, why do we do what we do?”</p>
<a>grateful</a> to him and Csikszentmihalyi, two titans of positive psychology, for their
<a>wisdom</a>. While they are no longer with us, their powerful research lives on and continues to help millions throughout the world.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pexels/Vlada Karpovich</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>How to cultivate more flow-like experiences </h3>
<p>Something as simple as engaging in more quality time with our children can increase our chances for flow-like states. Of course, it’s not just if but how we interact with our children. </p>
<a>Happiness</a> Studies, researchers found parents who experienced moments of flow while interacting with their kids were happier, more satisfied, intrinsically motivated, and enjoyed greater well-being.
<p>Of course, it’s not always possible to finish everything on our plate all of the time. No need to fret. It appears it’s only when we regularly leave a number of tasks uncompleted that it deters us from experiencing flow-like moments. </p>
<p>In sum, let’s remember to try to cultivate more flow-like experiences into our lives by being more <a>mindful</a> and proactive about how we spend our leisure time. Stop procrastinating. Make it a habit to finish those pesky work projects.</p>
<p>However, if indoor, cerebral activities appeal more to you and your family, connect over a round or two of Bananagrams (our favorite!) or another fun board game. </p>
<p>Whatever you do, remember the importance of cultivating daily moments of flow and connecting with your kids and loved ones. </p>

<h1> New Year's Social Media Resolutions </h1>
<h2> What "mental password" reminds you of your goals for 2022? </h2>
<li>A mental password is a word, phrase, motto, or nickname to remind you of your New Year's resolutions.</li>
<li>Create a cognitive motto to strengthen your resolve to make next year better.</li>
<li>Before posting on social media, ask yourself how much you desire approval ("likes") or whether your comments are overly harsh or judgmental. </li>

<p>Our thoughts often turn to our New Year’s Resolutions at this time of year. This is a good time to reflect back on a challenging year, review the positives and negatives, and renew our goal to make next year better.</p>
<p>You can start by doing some cognitive self-therapy homework to create a motto that captures your future aspirations. </p>
<p>A good question to ask yourself is: "What’s my password–to remind me who I aspire to be in 2022?"</p>
<p>An example of a password could be: “This will be my year!” or “Listening to my better angels.”</p>

<h1> Making Sense of Character Strengths </h1>
<h2> Here's a case for integrating positive psychology work into personality science. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Personality? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>attention</a> has emerged on this concept called character strengths, a phrase that implies a special, potent form of
<a>Martin Seligman</a> and Chris Peterson edited a book titled
<a>Character Strengths and Virtues: A Handbook and Classification</a>. In separate situations, this book has been called the bible of positive psychology and the "Un-
<a>DSM</a>." Howard Gardner, Senior Director of Harvard Zero and best-selling author of multiple
<a>intelligence</a> books, says character strengths is “One of the most important initiatives in psychology of the past half-century." With hyperbolic fury, the book launched a thousand studies on character strengths.
<blockquote> <p>"A combination of talents (naturally recurring patterns of thoughts, feeling and behavior), knowledge (facts and lessons learned), and skills (the steps of an activity.)" (Buckingham Clifton, 2001).</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>"The psychological ingredients—processes or mechanisms—that define morally valued virtues." (Peterson Seligman, 2004).</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>"Positive traits reflected in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors." (Park, Peterson, Seligman, 2004).</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>"Understood to be natural capacities that we yearn to use, that enable authentic expression, and that energise us." (Govindji Linley, 2007).</p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>"Positive traits/capacities that are personally fulfilling, do not diminish others, ubiquitous and valued across cultures, and aligned with numerous positive outcomes for oneself and others." (Niemiec, 2017).</p> </blockquote>
<a>cannabinoid oil</a> on the tongue seems warranted to understand what the hell a character strength is. With this backdrop, my colleagues
<a>Fallon R. Goodman, David J. Disabato,</a> and I wrote an

<a>John Srivastava, 1999</a>), now reframed as a character strength under the core value of

<a>spiritual</a> texts and various African religious texts, rather than those from the popular canon. Moral psychology has taught us that there is large variability in moral beliefs across cultures.
<a>For example, cultures vary how much they view the environment as central to moral virtue, and scientists have argued that environmental stewardship is considered a character strength</a>. Some cultures include plants and animals within core aspects of
<a>morality</a>, while others consider them less important. Moreover, within each culture, there is vast heterogeneity in how much people value a single characteristic.

<p>Everyone has their own recipe for happiness. Are there universal ingredients for having a good life?</p>
