<div><div><h3><div>Check if any of your passwords have been exposed</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>An exposed password may provide the kick in the pants you need to clean up your password act.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Password managers — applications that generate, save and automatically fill in unique, hard-to-guess passwords — can alert you to compromised passwords, too. And speaking of password managers …</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here’s what to do if you’ve been hacked</p></div>
<div><div><p>A password manager will solve a bunch of your password security problems in one swoop.</p></div></div>
<p>As far as setup, you’ve got a choice: Either turn on your favorite album and <a>spend a few hours inputting the passwords</a> to the sites you visit most often, or just start going about your business and auto-save passwords as you use them.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>If you must store passwords somewhere else, know the risks</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Of course, you can keep your passwords safe from canines and other acts of God by storing them somewhere digital. But then you’re opening yourself up to potential cyber theft.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Whatever you choose, know what risks you’re taking, and give a password manager some serious thought.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Set up two-factor authentication</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Traditionally, two-factor has involved a text message sent to your phone with a numeric code to input. If you know the code, that means you have your phone, so the app or site can trust that you’re really you.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Ask Help Desk: Is my phone haunted?</h1></div>
<h2>This week, we examine some of readers’ tech anxieties to figure out what deserves immediate attention and what’s out of our control.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Tatum Hunter</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 17, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Technology solves a lot of problems, but sometimes it introduces just as many. Deciding what’s worth worrying about can feel like a part-time job.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This week, we save you time by diving into some tech anxieties with a few experts and deciding whether it’s time to panic. Here are the CliffsNotes:</p></div></div>
<div><div>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</div></div>
<li>Rogue cellphones that appear to take pictures by themselves (don’t panic)</li>
<li>The major software vulnerability grabbing headlines (maybe panic a little)</li>
<li>Data-hungry Secret Santa generator apps (depends how badly you want the presents)</li>
<div><div><p><b>The security problem lurking in millions of sites and services:</b> <i>Do regular consumers need to be concerned about the Log4j security vulnerability flaw?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>—JD Johns, Los Angeles</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hi JD,</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What does all this mean for you and me?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even more likely, you won’t notice anything at all, as compromised apps or websites probably won’t show evidence of tampering.</p></div></div>
<div><p>For now, it’s an unfortunate waiting game. Keep practicing good password hygiene and be cognizant of who<b> </b>you give personal data to. (And maybe think about sending some extra appreciation to any IT people in your life.)</p></div>
<div><p>The ultimate guide to secure passwords</p></div>
<b>A 21st-century haunting:</b>
<i>My smartphone will start taking pix randomly, especially late at night if I pick it up or start moving it in my hand. It will light up on its own while sitting on a surface. The camera will flash several times without me enabling it.</i>
<div><div><p>—Tricia Young, Arlington, Va.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hi Tricia,</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I’m sorry that your phone is acting scary — it never feels good when technology seems to have a will of its own.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>On an Android, try Settings –> Accessibility –> Advanced Settings –> Flash Notification.
<div><div><p>The odds that your device has been hacked are slim. But it wouldn’t be the first time that an individual’s device was <a>compromised by commercial spyware</a> or <a>malicious software from an app</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There are a lot of sketchy apps out there,” says Fred Mastrippolito, CEO of cybersecurity firm Polito. “And some of them even end up in the App Store.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If it helps, it’s unlikely that anyone trying to spy on you through your camera would repeatedly set off the flash, Ashkenazi said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>You’re not paranoid to cover your webcam. But the cameras you can’t cover are scarier.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>He sees you when you’re sleeping, he knows when you’re awake:</b> <i>After reading your articles on tracking and privacy, what are your thoughts on Secret Santa Generator apps?</i></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>—Martha, Chelmsford, Mass.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hi Martha,</p></div></div>
<p>For the uninitiated, Secret Santa generator apps match gift recipients with anonymous givers in a holiday present exchange. To use one, you punch in everyone’s name and maybe a few questions like “What’s your favorite candy?”</p>
<div><div><p>Given <a>widespread tracking</a> by <a>the apps we download</a> onto our phones, the privacy practices of those name-hungry Secret Santa generator apps are worth a second thought.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But are they worth not getting a present?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In scenario two, you abstain from the app and then watch from the sidelines as co-workers and relatives unwrap sandalwood candles and gift cards to Starbucks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like <a>recipe apps</a> before them, I wouldn’t be surprised if Secret Santa generator apps do a little data-harvesting on the side. It’s just too tempting! (And common.)</p></div></div>
<div><p>For some recipe apps, your personal data is gravy</p></div>

<div><h1>The biggest tech trends to watch for in 2022 </h1></div>
<h2>Electric vehicles, interoperable smart homes and ‘the metaverse’ will all make an appearance at CES — if it doesn’t get canceled first.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Tatum Hunter</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Chris Velazco</div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022|Updated January 4, 2022 at 2:34 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>2022 will be a year of big tech promises. Whether companies can deliver is another question.</p></div></div>
<a>have pulled out</a>, and show organizers have shortened the event by one day — it now runs Wednesday through Friday.)
<div><div><a>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</a></div></div>
<a>metaverse</a>,” autonomous vehicles and greater repairability will take time to catch up to their hype, and companies must be careful not to overpromise, Milanesi said.
<a>we don’t trust companies</a> enough to share a whole lot of it, that technology gets stuck in the “my voice assistant still doesn’t understand me” phase.
<div><div><p>Here’s what we expect — and in some cases, hope — to see in 2022.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A race into the ‘metaverse’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook parent company Meta may have generated the most buzz with its foray into the metaverse — a theoretical shared space where people can hang out in virtual reality — but the other tech giants won’t be far behind.</p></div>
<div><p>In 2021, tech talked up ‘the metaverse.’ One problem: It doesn’t exist.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The smart home will make a lot more sense</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Matter</a>. The aim: to ensure that the home gadgets you buy in the future all play nice with one another, regardless of who made them or what virtual assistant you want to use when interacting with them.
<div><div><h3><div>Electric vehicles are inching toward the mainstream</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some 2022 tech trends are all about what’s <i>not</i> new. This year, electric vehicles will transition from cutting edge to standard issue — if you live somewhere with the infrastructure to support EV charging.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Chips will still be hard to come by</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>What you need to know about the global chip shortage</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Fixing your tech will start to get easier</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Phones, laptops, tablets — we rely on gadgets like these every day, but companies haven’t exactly made them easy to fix when things go wrong. Slowly but surely, it seems that might be starting to change.</p></div></div>
<a>self-service repair program</a> in early 2022. The (somewhat surprising) move will allow enthusiastic amateurs to access the parts and guides to fix their iPhones and Mac computers.
<a>hard-to-upgrade Surface laptop</a> — Microsoft announced plans to increase the options consumers have to repair their devices
<div><p>Study: World’s pile of electronic waste grows ever higher</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>More ways to analyze data from your own body</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Tech companies want you to trust them more</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>People now trust companies more than traditional institutions like government and religious organizations, according to Forrester analyst Enza Iannopollo, but companies still tend to overestimate how much customers trust them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And customers have good reason to be skeptical. In 2021, <a>security breaches</a>, <a>data privacy problems</a> and <a>AI whistleblowers</a> dominated technology news.</p></div></div>
<a>people who identify bias in AI systems</a> and adopting technologies that partially anonymize personal data, Forrester research predicts.

<div><h1>The weirdest and most interesting tech at CES 2022</h1></div>
<h2>The consumer electronics trade show salutes 2022 with some of the strangest technologies we’ve seen in a while. Here are the highlights.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Chris Velazco</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Tatum Hunter</div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 9:58 p.m. EST|Updated today at 4:55 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>The world’s biggest consumer electronics trade show known as CES feels weird this year, with far fewer attendees gracing the Las Vegas conference halls where consumer tech companies show off their latest and greatest (almost) every January.</p>
<div><div>Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you</div></div>
<p>As always, some of the industry’s plans are raising eyebrows. People still don’t have legal protections for the personal data they generate in normal old smartphone apps, yet consumer tech is marching forward into virtual reality.</p>
<div><p>What it’s like at one of the world’s biggest tech trade shows as omicron surges</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Garments made for gaming — and the metaverse</div></h3></div></div>
<p>The age of the metaverse is nearly upon us, according to some of the biggest names in tech. But what good is palling around with people in a sprawling, interconnected virtual space if you can’t feel the “world” around you?</p>
<div><div><p>That’s where the smart — and sometimes painful — garments from <a>Owo</a> enter the picture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>At last, augmented reality glasses that don’t look (that) ridiculous</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>But what’s a wearable like this actually meant to do? The software on the prototype we saw was far from finished, but it mentioned the ability to control phone calls, view photos and even display text on a virtual teleprompter.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Spacious space abodes</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some CES presenters are thinking forward to when people live in entirely connected homes. Sierra Space is thinking about when people live in giant inflatable houses on the moon.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A fitness tracker for your cat</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The pet’s place in the family is changing,” says Caudron. “It’s no longer a dog-master relationship. We think of ourselves as parents and our dogs as a member of the family.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A projector that works in unexpected places</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>Even now, in the middle of the strangest CES on record, companies have devoted big chunks of the show floor to showing off their flashiest, best TVs. But for Samsung, one of its biggest new products might actually be one of its smallest.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A robot that nibbles your fingers and warms your heart</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>True comfort is priceless, and for some people, that kind of peace only comes when animals or babies cutely gnaw on them. If that’s you, a tiny product from Japan just might be the best impulse buy of your life.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Aoki hopes to usher Amagami Ham Ham through a crowdfunding campaign in a few months, and — assuming that’s successful — he aims to sell the robot in Japan and abroad for the equivalent of about $30.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The biggest tech trends to watch for in 2022</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A robot that probably upsets you</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Humanoid robots are getting more lifelike, but only compared to their predecessors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just take the Ameca robot from Engineered Arts, a true-to-scale, metal-and-plastic robot person who blinks, shrugs and grimaces just like you and me — if you and me were stilted human facsimiles.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>If Jan. 6 had been a movie, the cops would’ve been the heroes</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Petula Dvorak</div></div>Columnist </span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 2:21 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Compared with the destruction of the Capitol by the British in 1814, the 2021 insurrection barely left a scratch.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>No member of Congress was harmed. The white dome, the marble halls still stand. And hours after the attack, lawmakers reassembled to certify the election that ushered a new president into the White House.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Jan. 6 was horrible for them. So was Jan. 7 and Jan. 12 and April 17 and Nov. 4 and any other day they couldn’t shake the memories. Many are depressed, anxious, angry and sad. Four took their own lives.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The insurrectionists went in there trying to “ransack the parliamentarian’s office. And they didn’t succeed,” Wexton said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The way official D.C. prepared for the Jan. 6 riot is what White privilege looks like</p></div>
<div><div><p>That victory came at a cost. Capitol Police Capt. Carneysha C. Mendoza, went from having a meal with her 10-year-old that day to walking into a hellscape.</p></div></div>
<a> congressional testimony </a>later that year. “We could have had 10 times the amount of people working with us and I still believe the battle would have been just as devastating.”
<div><div><p>When I reached out to her, she said she doesn’t want to relive the day much: “I spend time writing and I spend time lifting weights, both of which are helpful for my mental health.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other officers were emotional and raw in their testimonies to lawmakers about the aftermath.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>D.C. Officer <a>Bobby Tabron</a> “suffers from insomnia, and when he can sleep, he frequently has nightmares and night terrors in which he is fighting for his life at what seemed like the end of the world.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Most of the officers who survived had to suit up and head right back out for work the next day. And again. And again.</p></div></div>
<div><p>As the Capitol riot unfolded, one man felt uniquely betrayed</p></div>
<a>Kyle DeFreytag</a> — who were all at the Capitol on Jan. 6 — have underscored the despair. That their deaths have yet to be designated as line-of-duty deaths adds to the dismissal of their trauma.
<a>Blue H.E.L.P.</a>, a police mental health advocacy group. “But when someone breaks their mind? Or injures their mind while in the throes of doing their duty? They say, ‘Nope.’”
<div><p>The Attack: A Washington Post investigation of the Jan. 6 insurrection</p></div>
<div><p>Hough’s group works to break the stigma of mental health support. He’s found the best tool for that is peer group counseling, in which officers can relate to one another and know they aren’t alone in their trauma.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“My generation, we grew up in the age of ‘we don’t talk about that stuff,’” Hough said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gainer said it was the “suck it up” culture.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But both believe the coming generation of law enforcement officers will be more open to treating mental health as health.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Anything else is seriously messing with the officers’ minds. And they’ve all had enough of that.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Adding fuel to the fire: Northam also expressed exasperation with motorists who’d ignored the storm forecast and the state’s pleas to stay off the roads.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Why don’t you start asking some of these individuals that were out on the highway for hours: … ’Why did you feel it was so important to drive through such a snowstorm?’” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Northam also expressed sympathy for those who had been trapped later in the interview, but WRVA did not include that in the short clip initially posted on its website. It later added a second clip with those remarks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>After snowstorm, ongoing power outages plague thousands in Virginia: ‘30 degrees in my living room’</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Goodness gracious, @RalphNortham,” tweeted Garren Shipley, spokesman for incoming state House Speaker C. Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah). “This is not a good look.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>The backlash on social media swirled as the state braced for another winter storm, creating a headache for a governor already juggling the aftermath of the I-95 crisis and a resurgent coronavirus in the final days of his four-year term.</p></div>
<p>Northam’s remarks on the radio drew attention in part because he rarely shows anger in public. A folksy Eastern Shore native, he typically has the demeanor of a soft-spoken pediatrician, his job before he assumed the Executive Mansion.</p>
<div><div><p>Even as Northam pushed back against the reporter’s question about “what went wrong,” he soon caught himself, saying, “I hate to vent on you right now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his interview with The Post, Northam said he welcomes a review, including into whether state officials could have shut down the highway sooner or communicated better with motorists.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Northam weathered the episodes and, with a newly blue General Assembly, wound up delivering a host of long-stalled Democratic priorities.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Valentine said the investigation will be able to determine what was done well and “what we need to do better going forward.” She did not say give a timeline for when the review will be completed and a report readied.</p></div>
<div><p>As of Thursday, crews still working to clear local streets were shifting to pretreating the interstates and other primary and high-volume roadways ahead of a storm expected to dump three to four inches on the I-95 corridor overnight.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Even a modest accumulation of snow overnight could lead to treacherous commutes, numerous accidents and delays, unsettling the region already on edge. Monday’s storm dumped about a foot of snow in portions of Virginia.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>How extreme climate conditions fueled unprecedented Colorado fire</h1></div>
<h2>Record warmth and extreme drought, intensified by climate change, set the stage for the devastating blaze</h2>

<div><p>‘Total devastation’ after wildfire charges through Colorado towns</p></div>
<div><div><p>According to climate scientists, extreme fires tend to be “climate-enabled and weather-driven”; this was a classic case and one that is projected to become more frequent as the planet warms.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Colorado and Wyoming see record blizzard, historic snowfall in Denver and Cheyenne</p></div>
<div><div><p>The timing of drought onset was unusual. Rapid increases in drought severity in Colorado typically occur in the spring and summer months. Seeing this deterioration in the fall and winter was much more rare.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The drought level where the fires erupted was “extreme,” the second-highest category.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unusually warm conditions intensified the drought; they began this summer and continued through this week.</p></div></div>
