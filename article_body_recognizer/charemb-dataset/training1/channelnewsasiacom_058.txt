<h1> Commentary: Start fulfilling your New Year's resolution now for best chance of keeping them </h1>
<div> <p>Only about half of New Year’s resolutions are likely to make it out of January, says US researchers. A better way to achieve those goals may be to spend these last few days in December doing a dry run.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Mark Canada </a> <a> Christina Downey </a> </div> </div>
<p>KOKOMO, Indiana: If you’ve made a New Year’s resolution, your plot for self-improvement probably kicks into gear sometime on Jan 1, when the hangover wears off and the quest for the “new you” begins in earnest.</p>
<p>But if research on habit change is any indication, only about half of New Year’s resolutions are likely to make it out of January, much less last a lifetime.</p>
<p>As experts in positive psychology and literature, we recommend an unconventional but more promising approach.</p>
<p>We call it the “old year’s resolution".</p>
<p>It combines insights from psychologists and America’s first self-improvement guru, Benjamin Franklin, who pioneered a habit-change model that was way ahead of its time.</p>
<p>With the “old year” approach, perhaps you can sidestep the inevitable challenges that come with traditional New Year’s resolutions and achieve lasting, positive changes.</p>
<h2>A PERIOD TO PRACTISE - AND FAIL</h2>
<p>Research has highlighted two potential pitfalls with New Year’s resolutions.</p>
<p>First, if you lack the confidence to invest in a full-fledged effort, failure to achieve the goal may become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you maintain the change but perceive progress as unacceptably slow or inadequate, you may abandon the effort.</p>
<p>The old year’s resolution is different. Instead of waiting until January to start trying to change your life, you do a dry run before the New Year begins.</p>
<p>First, identify a change you want to make in your life. Do you want to eat better? Move more? Sock away more savings? Now, with Jan 1 days away, start living according to your commitment.</p>
<p>Track your progress. You might stumble now and then, but here’s the thing: You’re just practising.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever rehearsed for a play or played scrimmages, you’ve used this kind of low-stakes practice to prepare for the real thing. Such experiences give us permission to fail.</p>
<p>Psychologist Carol Dweck and her colleagues have shown that when people see failure as the natural result of striving to achieve something challenging, they are more likely to persist to the goal.</p>
<p>However, if people perceive failure as a definitive sign that they are not capable – or even deserving – of success, failure can lead to surrender.</p>
<p>If you become convinced that you cannot achieve a goal, something called “learned helplessness” can result, which means you’re likely to abandon the endeavour altogether.</p>
<p>Many of us unintentionally set ourselves up for failure with our New Year’s resolutions. On Jan 1, we jump right into a new lifestyle and, unsurprisingly, slip, fall, slip again – and eventually never get up.</p>
<p>The old year’s resolution takes the pressure off. It gives you permission to fail and even learn from failure.</p>
<p>You can slowly build confidence, while failures become less of a big deal, since they’re all happening before the official “start date” of the resolution.</p>
<h2>A GARDENER WEEDING ONE BED AT A TIME</h2>
<p>Long before he became one of America’s greatest success stories, Franklin devised a method that helped him overcome life’s inevitable failures – and could help you master your old year’s resolutions.</p>
<p>When he was still a young man, Franklin came up with what he called his “bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection”.</p>
<p>With charming confidence, he set out to master 13 virtues, including temperance, frugality, chastity, industry, order and humility.</p>
<p>In a typically Franklinian move, he applied a little strategy to his efforts, concentrating on one virtue at a time.</p>
<p>He likened this approach to that of a gardener who “does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time”.</p>
<p>In his autobiography, where he described this project in detail, Franklin did not say that he tied his project to a new year. He also did not give up when he slipped once – or more than once.</p>
<p>“I was surprised to find myself so much fuller of faults than I had imagined; but I had the satisfaction of seeing them diminish,” Franklin wrote.</p>
<p>He made his progress visible in a book, where he recorded his slip-ups. One page – perhaps only a hypothetical example – shows 16 of them tied to “temperance” in a single week.</p>
<p>(Instead of marking faults, we recommend recording successes in line with the work of habit expert B J Fogg, whose research suggests that celebrating victories helps to drive habit change.)</p>
<p>Repeated failures might discourage someone enough to abandon the endeavor altogether.</p>
<p>But Franklin kept at it – for years. To Franklin, it was all about perspective: This effort to make himself better was a “project,” and projects take time.</p>
<h2>‘A BETTER AND HAPPIER MAN’</h2>
<p>Many years later, Franklin admitted that he never was perfect, despite his best efforts. His final assessment, however, is worth remembering:</p>
<p>“But, on the whole, tho’ I never arrived at the perfection I had been so ambitious of obtaining, but fell far short of it, yet I was, by the endeavour, a better and a happier man than I otherwise should have been if I had not attempted it.”</p>
<p>Treating self-improvement as a project with no rigid time frame worked for Franklin. In fact, his scheme probably helped him succeed wildly in business, science and politics.</p>
<p>Importantly, he also found immense personal satisfaction in the endeavour: “This little artifice, with the blessing of God,” he wrote, was the key to “the constant felicity of his life, down to his 79th year, in which this is written.”</p>
<p>You can enjoy the same success Franklin did if you start on your own schedule – now, during the old year – and treat self-improvement not as a goal with a starting date but as an ongoing “project.”</p>
<p>It might also help to remember Franklin’s note to himself on a virtue he called, coincidentally, “Resolution”: “Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Illegal modifications, motorcycles on footpaths: LTA clamps down over the festive weekend </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ian Cheng </a> </div> </div>
<p>In a Facebook post on Sunday (Dec 26), LTA said that its operations over the last few days were focused on deterring "errant active mobility users and illegal car modifications". </p>
<p>Officers from the LTA and Traffic Police set up a road block along Penang Road to check for vehicles with illegal modifications and traffic offences.</p>
<p>Some vehicles were found to have non-compliant window tinting, suspected illegally modified exhausts, or were carrying goods that exceeded the permissible laden weight limit.</p>
<p>"We also stopped several motorcycles that were riding on footpaths outside Bedok Mall. Motorcycles must only be ridden on the road," said LTA.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>Among the other offences, an underaged rider was caught using a power-assisted bike outside Marina Bay Sands. Users of such devices must be at least 16 years old.</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Ten devices and six vehicles were also impounded. </p>
<p>Those found guilty of illegally modifying or using such vehicles can be fined up to S$5,000, jailed for up to three months, or both. The penalties for repeat offenders are doubled.</p>
<p>In its post, LTA reminded the public to observe its regulations and guidelines, as they have been put in place to ensure safety.</p>
<p>"Do not let irresponsible behaviour mar the festive experience for yourself and others," it said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Jail for man who molested woman, stole from victims including his mother </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lydia Lam </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Over almost two years, a young man committed a slew of crimes including molesting a woman and stealing from a worshipper at a mosque, a GrabFood rider and his own mother.</p>
<p>Nur Hafizat Selamat, now 22, was given two months and two weeks' jail on Monday (Dec 27). He pleaded guilty to five charges of theft, molestation and dishonest misappropriation. Another seven charges were considered in sentencing.</p>
<p>The court heard that Hafizat, who was jobless at the time of the offences, was waiting for a lift at a Housing Board block on Mar 7, 2019.</p>
<p>A 27-year-old woman on her way home from work joined him at the lift lobby to wait for the elevator, and Hafizat took notice of her.</p>
<p>As the lift doors were about to open, Hafizat tapped the woman's left buttock once with his hand. She turned and stared at Hafizat, who looked at her but did not follow her into the lift.</p>
<p>When the woman entered the lift, Hafizat gave her a flying kiss and waved at her. The act was captured on closed-circuit television footage, and the victim later called the police.</p>
<p>Later that year, Hafizat began stealing. On Nov 16, 2019, he stole S$250 from his mother's pouch while the 51-year-old woman was sleeping.</p>
<p>His stepfather later called the police to report his stepson for stealing from his mother.</p>
<p>On Feb 10, 2020, Hafizat went to Masjid Al-Islah in Punggol.</p>
<p>A 52-year-old man worshipper who was also at the mosque placed his handphone on a charger near the shelf at the main entrance of the prayer hall.</p>
<p>He walked away to proceed with his prayers, and returned about half an hour later to find his phone missing.</p>
<p>Hafizat was captured on CCTV footage loitering near the shelf. The phone was later recovered from him.</p>
<p>On Jan 23 this year, a 47-year-old GrabFood rider left his electric bicycle at the foot of a block in Punggol to make a food delivery.</p>
<p>When he returned, he realised that his black pouch left in one of the compartments in his Grab bag on the e-bike was missing. The pouch contained his passport as well as cash of S$700.</p>
<p>Police camera footage captured Hafizat removing the black pouch from the e-bike. He threw away the passport and pouch and used the money on himself.</p>
<p>For outraging a person's modesty, he could have been jailed up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of such punishments.</p>
<p>For theft, he could have been jailed up to three years, fined, or both.</p>

<p>PRETORIA : Rain delayed the start of day two of the first test between South Africa and India at Centurion Park on Monday, denying the visitors the chance to build on their impressive first innings total of 272 for three.</p>
<p>Overnight rain on the Highveld continued into the morning and intermittent showers are forecast throughout the day.</p>
<p>India opener KL Rahul was superb on Sunday as he reached the close unbeaten on 122 and when play resumes will be joined at the crease by Ajinkya Rahane after his unbeaten 40.</p>
<p>India is seeking an unprecedented test series win in South Africa with matches in Johannesburg and Cape Town to follow in the three match series. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> No clarity on Djokovic's participation, with ATP Cup days away </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>With the organisers of the Grand Slam confirming that all players and participants at Melbourne Park must be vaccinated or have a medical exemption granted by an independent panel of experts, Djokovic has kept everyone guessing.</p>
<p>If the Serbian does not turn up, world No 2 Daniil Medvedev would be the top draw at the ATP Cup, and he has already arrived in Sydney to help Russia defend its title.</p>
<p>Djokovic, 34, has won a record nine Australian Open titles, including the last three, and the chances of him playing Down Under improved when he was named in Serbia's team for the ATP Cup.</p>
<p>But on Saturday, a report in Serbian daily Blic said Djokovic would not be travelling to Sydney for the tournament, adding to doubts over whether he will play at Melbourne Park from Jan 17.</p>
<p>His father Srdjan told a Serbian television channel last month that Djokovic would probably pull out of the major, saying Tennis Australia's stance on mandatory vaccination was tantamount to "blackmail".</p>
<p>Djokovic's pullout will, however, not impact Serbia's participation in the tournament which has a US$10 million prize purse, with the teams locked in on Dec. 7 based on player entries.</p>
<p>Owing to Djokovic's current world ranking, Serbia received top billing for the 16-team ATP Cup from Jan. 1-9 and were put in Group A along with Norway, Chile and Spain when the draw was held earlier this month.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> France weighs new COVID-19 restrictions in Omicron fight </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to announce new COVID-19 measures on Monday (Dec 27) as the country braces for a new surge in cases due to the rapidly spreading Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Officials have warned that hospitals again risk being overwhelmed after a record 100,000 cases were reported Saturday, the highest daily level in France since the pandemic began nearly two years ago.</p>
<p>Health experts have estimated the number of daily cases could increase rapidly by mid-January, even though millions of people have received booster shots in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Nearly 3,300 people are currently in intensive care, again above the crisis threshold of 3,000 set by authorities for handling the worst cases.</p>
<p>Macron will hold a crisis meeting at 4:00pm (1500 GMT) via videoconference from his Mediterranean holiday retreat at Bregancon with key members of his cabinet and representatives of French public health bodies.</p>
<p>The pass as well as a negative test could also be required for bars or cafes without table seating, and possibly for nightclubs if they are allowed to reopen in January after a four-week closure ordered on December 6.</p>
<p>Some doctors have also suggested a curfew for New Year's Eve, while a group of health workers want to postpone the return of students to schools after the holidays, set for Jan 3.</p>
<p>Masks could also be required when outside, a measure already imposed in the Savoie region in the French Alps, and in other European countries.</p>
<p>Officials have been urging people not to hold parties or large family gatherings over the holidays, and some 22 million people out of an eligible 40 million have received COVID-19 booster shots.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Former Tampines MP and PAP veteran Phua Bah Lee dies aged 89 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Johannes Tjendro </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Former People's Action Party (PAP) Member of Parliament Phua Bah Lee, who was also the founding president of the Singapore Armed Forces Reservists’ Association (SAFRA), died aged 89 on Sunday (Dec 26).</p>
<p>Mr Phua joined the PAP in 1968, serving as MP for Tampines constituency for two decades until 1988.</p>
<p>He was also the parliamentary secretary in the then-Ministry of Communications from 1968 to 1971, and the senior parliamentary secretary of Ministry of Defence from 1972 to 1988.</p>
<p>In a post on the PAP's Facebook page on Monday, Prime Minister and party secretary-general Lee Hsien Loong said Mr Phua was "a dedicated and effective ground MP" who took care of his residents’ needs and made sure they were well looked after.</p>
<p>"Bah Lee was a faithful stalwart of the People’s Action Party. Even after he retired from politics in 1988, he remained actively engaged, loyally supporting party and grassroots events whenever he could," said Mr Lee.</p>
<h2>TAMPINES TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>Born in 1932, Mr Phua graduated from Nanyang University (Nantah) in 1959 and joined the civil service in 1960.</p>
<p>In the two decades after he entered politics in 1968, Mr Phua witnessed the transformation of Tampines from a rural constituency to a modern Housing Development Board township, Mr Lee said.</p>
<p>Mr Phua also helped to resettle villagers affected by the construction of the then Paya Lebar Airport, said Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli in a Facebook post.</p>
<p>Together with his grassroots leaders, Mr Phua resolved issues affecting his residents, such as education, livelihood and their transition to living in HDB flats.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Mr Phua mooted the idea of setting up the Tampines Chinese Temple and persuaded the heads of 13 temples that had to go in order to make way for developments to work together.</p>
<p>"It was the dedication and hard work of Mr Phua and the grassroots leaders that laid the strong foundation for Tampines Chinese Temple which still has a strong following today," said Mr Masagos.</p>
<p>Mr Phua was the founding president of SAFRA from 1972 to 1989.</p>
<p>Under his tenure, SAFRA launched several ground-breaking initiatives that helped promote pride and loyalty among National Servicemen, said SAFRA CEO Edward Leong in a Facebook tribute.</p>
<p>SAFRA’s membership grew from fewer than 2,000 in 1972 to 120,000 in 1989, testifying to his exemplary leadership, added Mr Leong.</p>
<p>"Mr Phua played a pivotal role in establishing a strong foundation for SAFRA to appreciate NSmen’s contributions to NS in a variety of relevant and tangible ways ... We are indeed indebted to (his) founding work and effort," he said.</p>
<p>The Ngee Ann Kongsi, of which Mr Phua was a member, said he left "an indelible mark in Kongsi for his dedication, untiring efforts, kindness and sublime sense of duty in establishing many milestones for our entities".</p>
<h2>STAUNCH SUPPORTER OF SPORTS, ARTS</h2>
<p>Mr Lee said Mr Phua was a "staunch supporter" of sports and the arts and culture, having served as president of the Basketball Association of Singapore and chairman of the management committee for Kreta Ayer People's Theatre.</p>
<p>"He had done his part to make this a better place, and having passed on the baton to younger leaders, continued to cheer for them and support the national cause."</p>
<p>Mr Phua was awarded the Friend of Labour Medal by the National Trades Union Congress in 1979.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Madam Tan Cheok Tin, and three children, according to MP Alex Yam.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Hindu vigilante groups disrupt Christmas celebrations on Modi territory </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>NEW DELHI: Hardline Hindu vigilante groups disrupted Christmas mass in parts of India, including in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's core territory, ahead of local elections in the coming months, media reported on Monday (Dec 27).</p>
<p>It also reported that activists burnt a model of Santa Claus and chanted slogans against Christmas celebrations and religious conversions on Saturday outside a church in Varanasi, Modi's parliamentary constituency and Hinduism's holiest city.</p>
<p>Anoop Shramik, a social activist in Varanasi, told Reuters that he saw about two dozen people burning the Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Contacted by telephone, the federal and state governments declined to comment.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Christmas celebrations were also disrupted in Silchar, eastern Assam, after men, claiming to be members of Bajrang Dal - a right-wing group with close ties to BJP, forced their way into a church, NDTV, a local news channel reported.</p>
<p>Leader of the main opposition Congress party and prominent members of minority Christian groups urged Modi to act.</p>
<p>"The PM should direct the BJP governments of Haryana and Assam to identify the miscreants and bring them before a Court of law," P Chidambaram, India's former finance minister and a senior Congress leader, said in a tweet.</p>
<p>Since Modi came to power in 2014, right-wing Hindu groups have consolidated their position across states and launched small-scale attacks on religious minorities, saying that their action is to prevent religious conversions.</p>
<p>Several Indian states have passed or are considering anti-conversion laws that challenge freedom of belief and related rights that the Indian constitution guarantees to minorities.</p>
<p>Elias Vaz, national vice-president of the All India Catholic Union, condemned the latest incidents.</p>
<p>"The strength of India is in its diversity, and the people who have done this at Christmas are the real anti-nationals," Vaz said.</p>
<p>Christians and Muslims together account for nearly 16 per cent of India's 1.37 billion people.</p>

<p>After the completion of the deal, Huarong Consumer Finance, the unit, will no longer be a subsidiary of the group, according to a statement filed to Hong Kong Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Huarong and Bank of Ningbo reached an equity transfer deal on Dec 27, and it is still subject to regulatory approval, it said.</p>
<p>The bonds then rose in August after it revealed a state-backed rescue plan, under which a consortium led by the state-owned Citic Group Corp agreed to make a strategic investment in it.</p>
<p>The state consortium will help it secure fresh capital worth 42 billion yuan, the company said last month.</p>
<p>Last month, Huarong was granted approval to raise 70 billion yuan of financial bonds in the interbank market, as it continues to improve its credit profile and re-focus on its main bad loan business.</p>

<p>"For safety reasons, the China Space Station implemented preventive collision avoidance control," China said in a document published on the website of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs.</p>
<p>The complaints have not been independently verified. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>In a post on China's Twitter-like Weibo microblogging platform on Monday, one user said Starlink's satellites were "just a pile of space junk", while another described them as "American space warfare weapons".</p>
<p>With nearly 30,000 satellites and other debris believed to be orbiting the planet, scientists have urged governments to share data to reduce the risk of catastrophic space collisions.</p>
<p>SpaceX alone has deployed nearly 1,900 satellites to serve its Starlink broadband network, and is planning more.</p>
<p>"The risks of Starlink are being gradually exposed, the whole human race will pay for their business activities," a user posting under the name Chen Haiying said on Weibo.</p>
<p>US space agency NASA was forced to abruptly call off a spacewalk at the end of November, citing risks posed by space debris. Musk tweeted in response that some Starlink satellite orbits had been adjusted to reduce the possibility of collisions.</p>
<p>China began constructing the space station in April with the launch of Tianhe, the largest of its three modules. The station is expected to be completed by the end of 2022 after four crewed missions.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> After Algeria, major Russian wheat trader Solaris aims for China </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MOSCOW : Swiss-based Solaris, a major trader of Russian wheat, is confident China will become a big buyer and also aims to boost exports to Egypt, Pakistan, Sudan, Tanzania and Turkey, it told Reuters, following breakthroughs in the Algerian market.</p>
<p>"China is a key target also for Russian grain exports and Solaris is confident that China will soon be a major buyer of Russian wheat," Josh Martin, Solaris chief executive, said, without specifying what he meant by soon.</p>
<p>Independently-owned Solaris has a strategic relationship with Demetra Holding, in which Russia's second largest lender VTB consolidated stakes in Russian Black Sea grain export terminals.</p>
<p>Algeria was a top destination for wheat from Russia in December with around 200,000 tonnes shipped there so far, Sovecon consultancy said in a note.</p>
<p>Martin said Solaris in the fourth quarter won approval to supply Russian wheat from one of Demetra's export terminals to Indonesia and Vietnam, which would allow for the resumption of Russian exports to the markets. [GRA/RU]</p>
<p>Solaris also handled grain from Romania and Ukraine and is exploring export alliances for origins including Australia and Argentina. Russian wheat trade has been hit by a smaller crop and state grain export curbs in 2021.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Will Omicron trigger restrictions in Singapore and set back plans to live normally with COVID-19? </h1>
<div> <p>The year-end mood seems oblivious to the raging Omicron pandemic. But this isn’t our first rodeo and Singapore is in a stronger position than when Delta hit us, says CNA's Lin Suling.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lin Suling </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: There was a point in my weekend visit to Orchard Road where the thought that this was one giant mistake crept into my head.</p>
<p>Perhaps having to wait my turn while hauling bags of bargain buys behind lines of shoppers queueing to scan their TraceTogether-SafeEntry to get into ION Orchard was getting to me. </p>
<p>But I quickly banished the unpleasant thought as I moved into a less crowded part of the mall and delightful holiday music filled the air. </p>
<p>The upbeat year-end mood was infectious. People filled seats in restaurants in bigger groups since rules on FB were relaxed some weeks ago. Families were admiring the Christmas light-up. </p>
<p>This bright optimism is translating into economic dollars. Courts, Metro and many retailers have reported a rebound in consumer sentiments.</p>
<p>Should these trends continue, the Singapore economy might experience an upswing if workers can return to the office as planned come January 2022. Central Business District shops and FB outlets are looking forward to this reopening. </p>
<h2>COULD OMICRON BRING REPEAT OF DELTA SURGE?</h2>
<p>Yet we cannot escape news of what’s happening around the world, with Omicron spreading like wildfire and sounding the sirens of a rougher ride ahead.</p>
<p>The onset of the cold, dry winter in the northern hemisphere, coupled with this new strain, has already seen a global rise in COVID-19 infections, nearing levels of the Delta outbreak earlier this year. </p>
<p>That doesn’t sound good for Singapore, which is mid-way through reopening. We have had to pause sales of vaccinated travel lane flight and bus tickets, and have seen at least 71 cases of Omicron.</p>
<h2>A CHANGE IN PUBLIC ATTITUDES ABOUT COVID-19</h2>
<p>Despite these disconcerting developments, the conversations I had with friends and family this week have surprisingly not been about COVID-19 but of newly minted national badminton superstar Loh Kean Yew’s stunning World Championships journey.</p>
<p>Singaporeans may have finally cast our eyes off this dreadful pandemic and started focusing on things worth celebrating that give us hope – and understandably so. </p>
<p>Today, that doom-and-gloom almost feels like an unrecognisable lifetime ago - and not only because the Health Ministry is refraining from issuing daily COVID-19 numbers on Whatsapp, Telegram or to news outlets.</p>
<p>Singapore seemed to have turned the corner in pursuing endemic living, using tools in our COVID-19 arsenal to beat back the virus and bolster the healthcare system. </p>
<p>Perhaps the September surge in infections too changed the minds of the vaccine-hesitant - with 88 per cent of all getting at least a first dose today compared to 84 per cent then, meaning a higher population is resilient to the virus.</p>
<h2>GREATER CONFIDENCE IN ENDEMIC LIVING</h2>
<p>Omicron could prove a bigger test to Singapore’s march towards living normally with COVID-19 than Delta did, but the mood isn’t one of fear or even fatigue but poise. </p>
<p>Public attitudes have shifted to embrace what is necessary to get on with life. Confidence in Singapore’s ability to live with COVID-19 ticked upwards in November, according to an Institute of Policy Studies poll.</p>
<h2>READYING FOR AN OMICRON WAVE</h2>
<p>Still, this pandemic has taught us never to say never. Things can easily change tomorrow at the emergence of a new variant. Delta taught us that lesson. </p>
<p>Beneath these outwardly calm waters, the Singapore healthcare system is preparing to withstand another wave. Boosters and vaccination of kids aged five to 11 are a first line of defence that will steady the ship. </p>
<p>And the <a>extension of the COVID-19 Recovery Grant</a> to support low-, middle-income workers and self-employed people shows that the authorities recognise recovery will continue to see headwinds.</p>
<h2>TACKLE EMERGING CONCERNS ABOUT RESTRICTIONS</h2>
<p>Speculation that the multi-ministry task force could slap on tighter rules soon is growing. Though there is a cautious air of certainty we can ride out this next rodeo, people are wondering whether fresh restrictions could set back endemic living. </p>
<p>It’s comforting to be able to cast those jitters aside and not worry incessantly about Omicron. Maybe this is what resilience is? </p>
<p>Knowing rules might be tightened tomorrow but having confidence we will lay out a plan of action to keep going - and appreciating how much has been sacrificed to do just that. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Singapore’s festive indulgence creates enormous food waste </h1>
<div> <p>Even as Singapore makes progress in the fight against food waste, the holiday season remains a hard nut to crack — but it need not be so, says Seeram Ramakrishna.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Seeram Ramakrishna </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: ‘Tis the season of feasting. </p>
<p>Statistics from the United Kingdom show that a disproportionate proportion of food waste is generated during the Christmas season, with household food waste levels rising 30 per cent.</p>
<p>In Australia, a Melbourne University study found that food waste rises in December and January as people eat out, with 40 per cent of food purchased as festive season stock ending up in the bin.</p>
<p>In the United States, household waste increases by 25 per cent during the period between Thanksgiving and the new year.</p>
<h2>HOLIDAY INDULGENCE FUELLING FOOD WASTE</h2>
<p>One reason for the festive waste spike is that the holiday season is associated with indulgence. People are less careful about their food habits. </p>
<p>There are more parties and buffets. Consumers might be tempted by deals at eateries and supermarkets to buy more than they need.</p>
<p>About a quarter of Singapore households often throw away spoiled or expired food, mostly because they bought too much or it was hidden at the back of the fridge, another NEA study found.</p>
<p>It is also possible Singaporeans simply underestimate how much they toss. Most respondents in a Milieu Insight poll in October last year said their households threw away only small or “reasonable” amounts of food.</p>
<p>Consumers are not the only contributors, however, to the problem. About 40 per cent of Singapore’s food waste comes from the commercial and industrial sectors.</p>
<p>Food waste is one of the priority waste streams in Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, which aims to slash waste going to Semakau Landfill by 30 per cent by 2030 to prevent the landfill from running out of space by 2035.</p>
<p>And with the holiday season being one of the biggest culprits in the food waste problem, it is a good place to start.</p>
<h2>REDUCING AND RECYCLING FOOD</h2>
<p>Efforts in other nations to counter festive food waste can have lessons for us.</p>
<p>China, which sees large amounts of food waste during its festive season, rolled out a Clean Plate campaign against food waste last year, with the Wuhan Catering Association suggesting diners order one dish less than the number of people gathering.</p>
<p>Australian consumers this year are snapping up festive gift boxes of imperfect but fresh fruit and vegetables from social enterprise Good and Fugly, which come with a cooking demo designed to reduce food waste.</p>
<p>In Thailand, consumers have snapped up over 20,000 boxes of discounted, unsold food items from eateries, hotels and supermarkets on food waste start-up app Yindii.</p>
<p>In South Korea, meanwhile, 95 per cent of food waste is recycled — into fertiliser and animal feed, for example — thanks to a system requiring households to bag food waste separately and pay fees according to the weight of the waste.</p>
<p>This is valorisation at work — the act of making something useful from an existing substance, which in this case is the conversion of food waste into new products.</p>
<p>This approach can speed up our progress in food waste reduction and close Singapore’s waste loop, beyond typical calls for consumers to order just enough, make use of leftovers or donate surplus food.</p>
<p>Some Singapore companies are making strides in this area. Crust Group is partnering restaurants and food retail outlets to turn their surplus products into beer and sparkling water.</p>
<p>Asia Pacific Breweries transforms spent barley grains from the beer-brewing process into ingredients for animal feed.</p>
<p>Insectta breeds black soldier flies to make biomaterial, with the larvae converting food waste into natural fertiliser, while TRIA uses a rapid digestion technology to convert food waste and disposable foodware into fertiliser.</p>
<h4> <div>How do staggering 11.11 sales figures sit with a growing consciousness about waste and sustainability? We ask a marketing professor and Lazada's Chief Business Officer on Heart of the Matter:</div> </h4>
<h2>IS A CIRCULAR ECONOMY THE ANSWER?</h2>
<p>Singapore is keenly examining the circular economy as a solution to its food waste problem.</p>
<p>From 2024, large food-waste generators in the commercial and industrial sectors will be required to segregate and treat their food waste. This opens up more options for waste treatment, including valorisation.</p>
<p>While the circular economy can slash food waste, it requires a joint effort, such as partnerships between stakeholders and collaborations between business and research experts to develop more food valorisation capabilities.</p>
<p>The NEA has set up an Industry Steering Committee focused on creating a circular economy for food. It is looking to encourage more firms to adopt valorisation solutions to upcycle food waste.</p>
<p>Tackling food waste is also a key topic that industry captains, innovators and policymakers will discuss at the biennial CleanEnviro Summit Singapore in April.</p>
<p>Our food waste recycling progress has been promising, jumping from 10 per cent in 2011 to 19 per cent last year. Singapore recycled 126,000 tonnes of food waste last year, close to double the 70,000 tonnes a decade ago.</p>
<p>Still, this means the bulk of food waste goes to the waste-to-energy plants.</p>
<p>Going back to the festive waste problem, it appears that it will take more time for consumer mindsets and food habits to shift towards mindfulness of food waste during the holidays.</p>
<p>Luckily, while we move towards that goal, technological advancements are simultaneously making it easier to recycle our food waste. Yet it cannot replace the importance of stopping food waste from being generated at one main source: Us.</p>
<p>So, while we shop at the supermarket or order meals for our gatherings, let us think harder about preventing food waste. That is even better than finding a solution for it.</p>

<h1> Under the shadow of China’s mega dams, millions in Southeast Asia face a fight for survival </h1>
<p>China plans to build the world’s biggest dam in its bid to become carbon-neutral by 2060. But its hydropower ambitions are already having an adverse effect on the rivers and livelihoods of downstream communities, the programme Insight finds out.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Lianne Chia </a> <a> Sumithra Prasanna </a> </div> </div>
<p>CHIANG RAI, Thailand: Anusorn Nantharak has known no other occupation.</p>
<p>Born and raised in a fishing village along the Mekong River, the 37-year-old joined his family-owned fishing business at the age of 17. Back then, they had more than 10 fishing boats and could fish all day.</p>
<p>But 15 years ago, everything started changing.</p>
<p>“We used to find so many big fish … The population of fish has decreased, and their size has gotten smaller,” he said. His family now owns just two or three fishing boats.</p>
<p>Far upstream from where he lives, the hydroelectric dams China built along the Mekong have turned his life upside down by ruining the water system, he said, and thus resulting in fewer fish.</p>
<p>“The flood seasons aren’t following the same pattern any more,” he said. “When it’s supposed to be high tide, the river becomes dry. And when the river should become dry, the water level rises.</p>
<p>“With the damage to the ecosystem, soon some fish will go extinct.”</p>
<p>The Mekong, which passes through, Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam, is one of the world’s most complex river systems, second only to the Amazon River in terms of fish biodiversity.</p>
<p>China completed its first hydroelectric dam on the Mekong, the Manwan dam in Yunnan province, in 1995. Since then, it has built 10 more on the main river, along with hundreds of dams on the Mekong’s tributaries.</p>
<p>Harvesting water in dams and creating hydroelectricity are “high on the agenda in the Chinese government”, noted Elizabeth Lai from the University of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>“It’s very important politically for China to provide security in water supply,” said Lai, an honorary lecturer at the university’s Centre for Civil Society and Governance. “Another importance is in terms of providing clean energy.”</p>
<p>With reference to China’s pledge to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2060, she said building dams is “one of the most efficient ways” of providing that clean energy for the country.</p>
<p>Hydroelectricity is China’s second-biggest source of energy, after coal; it makes up close to a fifth of the total energy production.</p>
<p>This gives transboundary rivers an “overall strategic significance” for China, he said, noting that most of the border areas these rivers flow through tend to be mountainous, where “the local economy and society are relatively backward”.</p>
<p>“So the development of cross-border rivers to benefit communities along the banks is very important for China.”</p>
<p>But the dams have altered the Mekong River’s traditional flow, fragmented natural habitats and caused water levels to plunge to dangerous lows downstream.</p>
<p>“Building dams isn’t environmentally friendly.”</p>
<p>The report said the average sediment load in parts of the Mekong in Thailand declined by as much as 83 per cent between 2003 and 2009.</p>
<p>The adverse effects have been exacerbated by climate change and a lack of transboundary communication.</p>
<p>“(But) people downstream here … experienced the change of water level. We witnessed the unusual water fluctuation that drastically changed the ecosystem of the Mekong River.</p>
<p>“We’re not against China … but we’re talking about the existing problems on the Mekong River. The dams over there are generating electricity, but with the cost borne by the downstream communities.”</p>

<p>Besides fishermen like Anusorn, there are others whose livelihoods are affected, like farmer Nipon Wutthikorn, who grows bean sprouts on the banks of the Mekong.</p>
<p>“The amount of (fertile) land has decreased … and the sand bar is higher than before,” he said. “The water levels aren’t predictable (any more).”</p>
<p>Activists like Niwat worry that the Mekong is a testing ground for Chinese hegemony in East Asia and beyond, given that China’s dams have been holding back massive quantities of water over the last two years.</p>
<p>“Keeping in all the water during the rainy season and letting it out during the dry season is wrong,” he said. “It’s going against nature.”</p>
<p>It has also threatened the livelihoods of the 60 million people living downstream by causing crop failure and depleting fish catches.</p>
<p>This, noted Niwat, is a topic for negotiation with China. “They keep saying, ‘Hey, we’re not keeping that much water. There’s only 13.5 per cent of the Mekong River held in our dams,’” he said.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> To China, it’s only 13.5 per cent, but … if you choose whenever you want to open or close it, it causes huge effects.” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>This is something Tian the university professor described as an “exaggeration of the situation”.</p>
<p>“Many people think that China is upstream, and the water comes from upstream, so building this dam is equal to shutting off the tap water, and then you can do whatever you want,” he said.</p>
<p>“This statement doesn’t consider the area that such a water resource is distributed across.”</p>
<p>He added that storing water in a reservoir “just regulates the seasonality”.</p>
<p>“It increases the water flow across the seasons by reducing floods and storing water for the dry seasons,” he said. “To a certain extent, this is conducive to downstream flood control and drought relief as well.”</p>
<p>He sees it as a “very complicated” problem requiring lots of data, modelling and “detailed research to reach scientific conclusions”.</p>
<p>“Usually, there are various factors that affect irrigation. The reservoirs on the tributaries and sand mining may all play a role in changing the topography of a river,” he said.</p>
<p>“We need to build this understanding based on science to improve the mutual trust between upstream and downstream areas.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, said Lai, who is also an environmental engineer, the engineering behind dam projects is “there for the good of mankind but needs to be properly managed instead of manipulated to become a political tool”.</p>
<p>“It’s all up to the mentality of … the transboundary countries to have that sort of a broader perspective,” she added.</p>
<p>Pianporn agrees on the importance of the relevant governments having a “strong political will” to recognise these issues as “important transboundary issues in mainland Southeast Asia”.</p>
<p>She also advocates that rural communities should have equal participation in decision-making in the resource planning for the Mekong.</p>
<p>“We’re not asking for cash compensation or anything like that,” she said. “We’d just like to see the mighty Mekong once again free-flowing, in a healthy manner, and that she can feed our livelihoods, migratory fish and our agricultural land.”</p>

<h2>WHAT’S NEXT FOR CHINA?</h2>
<p>This hydropower project is set to be the world’s largest dam, generating 300 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year. It is estimated the dam could produce about thrice the power of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>The location of the mega dam offers “very good conditions for hydropower development”, said Tian. And the river is “relatively undeveloped” in China.</p>
<p>But the impact on India and Bangladesh could be huge.</p>
<p>In 1975, India constructed the Farakka Barrage across the transboundary river Ganges. This created water stress in Bangladesh and a multitude of environmental and social consequences.</p>
<p>“Earlier, you’d hear its roars from two, three kilometres away,” said Bangladeshi water activist Mizanur Rahman. “How did that river become a graveyard in the last 30, 40 years? The reason is the Farakka Barrage.”</p>
<p>It is likely to get worse with the new dam. “As China will store water for the mega dam, the downstream countries, India and Bangladesh, will get less water,” said Partha Pratim Biswas, a professor at India’s Jadavpur University.</p>
<p>Already, fisherman Zahangir Alom has seen how the river has dried up and become narrower. The 26-year-old now worries that his community will have even more trouble catching fish.</p>
<p>The same goes for boatman Masud Rana Shomrat. “If the dam is constructed, the entire area would become a desert,” he said. “The northern part of Bangladesh runs along the river; if it turns into a desert, the supply of a lot of goods would stop.”</p>
<p>In March, the Chinese parliament adopted the country’s 14th five-year plan, which contained the plan to construct the dam as part of China’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.</p>
<p>It is those who live downstream, like Zahangir and Masud, who will have to pay a high price.</p>
<p>“My life will be finished, since I’m a boatman,” said Masud. “Our whole family is dependent on the river for survival.</p>
<p>“There’s no other way of survival — we’d die.”</p>

<h1> ‘The largest, most impactful war the world’s ever seen’: Can the US, China avoid Taiwan face-off? </h1>
<div> <p>War will be the last resort, but more of China’s elites and strategists now feel that Taiwan is ‘within reach’, an analyst says. Can both sides reopen lines of communication, the programme Insight asks.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Neo Chai Chin </a> , <a> Allister D'Souza </a> <a> Claire Chin </a> </div> </div>
<p>TAIPEI: He enjoys engaging in mock combat using replica guns. Through survival games, Jimmy (not his real name) learnt more about weapons, he said, than during his four-month mandatory training in the Taiwanese military.</p>
<p>“The replica guns are very realistic. Handling them is like handling real guns. During military service, there are fewer weapons and fewer opportunities to handle them,” said the 22-year-old, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Jimmy certainly does not consider himself a “strawberry soldier”, someone more used to comfort than toughing it out. He believes Taiwan should increase the duration of military service.</p>
<p>But among his friends, he is more the exception than the norm. Most of them are unwilling to do military service and “find ways to avoid it”, said Jimmy.</p>
<p>He has also seen people feigning asthma attacks during physical check-ups.</p>
<p>“If war breaks out, it’s our duty to serve in the military,” he said. “If there’s a war, we’d have to rely on ourselves. The chances of the United States coming to our help are extremely low.”</p>
<p>Combat readiness is one aspect of Taiwan that has come into question following what its defence minister, Chiu Kuo-cheng, described in October as the worst military tensions with China in over 40 years.</p>
<p>That month, China sent almost 150 military jets into Taiwan’s air defence identification zone over four consecutive days — said to be a record number.</p>
<p>The air defence zone covers the Taiwan Strait and part of the Chinese mainland that Taiwan monitors for threats. Experts told the <a>programme Insight</a> the incursions were meant to intimidate Taiwan.</p>
<p>“It was alarming in terms of the numbers of aircraft,” said Bonnie Glaser, the director of the Asia programme at think-tank German Marshall Fund of the United States.</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific security expert Oriana Skylar Mastro said it was a “sign of aggression” — a message from the Chinese government that it could hurt Taiwan with its bombers and fighters.</p>
<p>“It also signals China’s intention to rely more and more on military means to achieve their own goal of national unification,” said Mastro, a centre fellow at Stanford University’s Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies in the US.</p>
<p>Experts who spoke to Insight did not rule out war.</p>
<h2>THE DRAGON AND THE MOUSE</h2>
<p>The Biden administration approved a US$750 million (S$1.02 billion) arms sale to Taiwan earlier, and although the latter is trying to increase its defence spending, experts say it is no match for China.</p>
<p>Arms sales to Taiwan are “extraordinarily modest” compared to what the PLA is doing, noted Elbridge Colby, former US deputy assistant secretary of defence.</p>
<p>“It’s almost laughable. China is this enormous dragon, and Taiwan is maybe a mouse. So maybe the mouse is sharpening its nails a little bit, but that’s nothing compared to what this enormous dragon is capable of doing.”</p>
<p>Beijing’s latest defence spending is about RMB1.35 trillion (S$290 billion), a 6.8 per cent increase from the previous year. Its technological sophistication is also growing.</p>
<p>For instance, Pentagon officials were caught off-guard by China’s hypersonic glider test flight in July, when a missile was reportedly fired mid-flight over the South China Sea at more than five times the speed of sound.</p>
<p>The cross-straits disparity is quite apparent to Admiral (Retired) Lee Hsi-ming.</p>
<p>“If we insist on the large, shiny weapon systems, we’d never (have) enough conventional equipment. We’d fail,” said the former Republic of China (ROC) Armed Forces chief of general staff. ROC is Taiwan’s official name.</p>
<p>“We can’t just use the traditional way to defend ourselves. We must think in other ways, improve innovation and … improve asymmetrical warfare.”</p>
<p>Disinformation, for example, is a modern-day weapon, as Puma Shen, chairman of civil society organisation Doublethink Lab, knows well.</p>
<p>According to Doublethink’s research, Taiwan faces a lot of disinformation from China aimed at discrediting the Taiwanese government and creating distrust in society, he said.</p>
<p>He cited a flood of COVID-19-related Facebook posts in May that falsely claimed many people were dying and the Taiwanese government was not controlling case numbers.</p>
<p>Disinformation campaigns are crucial for initiating a military war against Taiwan, said Shen, who is also an assistant professor at National Taipei University. They serve to affect Taiwanese people and secure an earlier surrender, he said.</p>
<p>“Fighting disinformation is just like playing basketball or any other sport: You need to stay one step ahead of your opponents.</p>
<h2>WHY A COSTLY WAR MAY BE ‘ACCEPTABLE’</h2>
<p>When it comes to the possibility of war, there is a disconnect between what Taiwan’s younger generation and some military veterans perceive.</p>
<p>Taiwanese below the age of 40 do not think war will happen, said Charity Huang, secretary-general of the Taiwan Association of Disaster Prevention Industry, which conducts classes on survival skills, among other things.</p>
<p>“When it comes to war, I think there’s a lack of awareness and precaution,” added secretariat member Cherry Yang. This is despite the fact that air-raid drills are part of life in Taiwan, where there are 117,000 air-raid shelters.</p>
<p>This generational sentiment contrasts with that of the top US military officer in the Asia-Pacific who recently retired. Philip Davidson warned in March that China could invade Taiwan in the coming years.</p>
<p>“I worry that they (China) are accelerating their ambitions to supplant the US and our leadership role in the rules-based international order … by 2050,” the admiral said at a US Senate armed services committee hearing.</p>
<p>“Taiwan is clearly one of their ambitions before that. And I think the threat is manifest during this decade; in fact, in the next six years.”</p>
<p>His successor, Admiral John Aquilino, thinks “this problem is much closer” than that.</p>
<p>What is plain to see is the rapid expansion of the Chinese military under President Xi.</p>
<p>“China has the power to take over Taiwan, if necessary. However, the use of force is the last resort because using force carries a lot of cost,” said Jia Qingguo, a professor and former dean of Peking University’s School of International Studies.</p>
<p>“There’s the direct cost of military confrontation. Second, a lot of people are going to die in Taiwan and … on the mainland — the soldiers and the civilians. Also, China has to face the problem of how to deal with a destroyed Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Yet, more of China’s elites and strategists now feel that Taiwan is “within reach”, said Mastro.</p>
<h2>WOULD THE U.S. COME TO TAIWAN’S DEFENCE?</h2>
<p>There is that question, however, of whether the US would defend Taiwan.</p>
<p>For decades, America’s policy of strategic ambiguity has kept the peace and enabled US presidents to have flexibility in a crisis, said Glaser. “It also is useful because it doesn’t give Taiwan a blank cheque,” she added.</p>
<p>“This would increase the tension in the Taiwan Strait rather than alleviate it,” he said.</p>
<a>angered China</a>. Beijing has called it irresponsible and a breach of nuclear non-proliferation rules.
<p>Glaser said Aukus is ultimately a plan that will “enable Australia to operate close to China, potentially even in the Taiwan Strait”.</p>
<p>“That may be 20 years or more in the future. But it signals today that Australia is worried about Chinese use of force against Taiwan and that it doesn’t want to see that happen,” she said.</p>
<p>Aukus could, however, increase the chances of provocation.</p>
<p>“China, of course, isn’t afraid of this, but China has to defend its rights,” said Henry Wang Huiyao, the founder and president of the Centre for China and Globalisation, a Beijing-based non-governmental think-tank.</p>
<p>“We really don’t want to see this kind of (return to Cold War tactics). Then that could lead to confrontations.”</p>
<p>WATCH: 4 signs war over Taiwan could be coming — and reasons why not (6.44)</p>
<p>While the US is legally required under the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act to provide the island with arms for its defence, there is “no treaty obligation” on the superpower to come to Taiwan’s defence should it, ultimately, be attacked.</p>
<p>This was highlighted by Drew Thompson, a visiting senior research fellow at Singapore’s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy. “The president would have to make the decision about when the US would actually intervene to defend Taiwan,” he noted.</p>
<p>Either way, the impact of that decision would be huge.</p>
<p>If a crisis escalates to war, then it would be “the largest, most impactful war that the world’s ever seen”, said Mastro.</p>
<h2>MANAGING THE EBB AND FLOW OF RELATIONS</h2>
<p>What, then, can dial down the tensions? According to experts, both China and Taiwan, along with the US, can play a role.</p>
<p>The ebb and flow of cross-strait relations has gone on since the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with the communists taking over mainland China and the nationalists retreating to Taiwan.</p>
<p>But not long after Taiwan’s 2016 presidential election won by the Democratic Progressive Party’s Tsai Ing-wen — who was re-elected last year — China cut off official communications with Taiwan.</p>
<p>She takes a hard line against Beijing. And her party rejects the 1992 consensus, which refers to the result of a semi-official meeting between China and Taiwan, which was then ruled by the Kuomintang.</p>
<p>Both sides acknowledged a “one China” principle. But what that meant was never clearly defined.</p>
<p>Given that Taiwan now has “no political preference” for unification, Thompson’s view is that President Xi’s current objective is “focused on preventing Taiwan from declaring independence, rather than forcing unification in the near term”.</p>
<p>In this vein, Jia hopes that the US will restrain Taiwan’s independence activists and activities.</p>
<p>And if the US maintains its commitment to both Taiwan and American allies in the region, the prospect of war would be “diminished”, added Thompson.</p>
<p>Glaser called on China to be more “creative” and more “flexible” to find some common ground, “instead of sticking stubbornly to a proposal of ‘one country, two systems’, which was never acceptable to the people of Taiwan”.</p>
<p>Even so, she thinks it is “in Taiwan’s interest to have China retain some sliver of hope that peaceful unification is possible — because if all of that hope evaporates, then the risk of China using force would grow”.</p>
<p>WATCH: The full episode — US-China: Could there be war over Taiwan? (45:16)</p>
<p>Both sides should reopen the channels of communication, suggested Alexander Chieh-cheng Huang, a professor of strategic studies and war gaming at Tamkang University in Taiwan.</p>
<p>“To prevent war, we need to talk to our potential attacker. We need to have a dialogue with Beijing. As long as we can maintain the communication lines, we have another layer of protection.”</p>
