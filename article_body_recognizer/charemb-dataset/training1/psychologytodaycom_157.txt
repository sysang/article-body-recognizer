<h2> What it means to be an overfunctioning partner. </h2>
<li>Someone who underfunctions in a relationship is often dependent on a partner financially or emotionally. </li>
<li>The overfunctioner is the one who takes on too many responsibilities and always tries to fix things.</li>
<li>Potential problems with this dynamic include losing sex drive, resentment, and unhealthy family dynamics.</li>
<h3>What Is ‘Functioning’?</h3>
<h3>Do You Have an Underfunctioning Partner?</h3>

<h3>Are You an Overfunctioner?</h3>
<p>A relationship always involves two parties and it is never just one person’s fault that it is the way it is. If you find yourself being locked in a relationship dynamic with an underfunctioner, it is worth reflecting on your role in it. </p>
<p>There might be factors in your psyche or background that would have caused you to play the role of an ‘overfunctioner’, which in turn reinforces the dynamic loop you have with your underfunctioning partner. </p>
<a>anger</a> issues, were violent or struggled with addictions. You might have to be their caretakers, counsellor, and confidant when they were upset. You might also have to become the
<a>leader</a> in the family and caretake your younger siblings.
<p>Therefore, the <a>caretaking</a> role now feels familiar. You naturally slip into it without realising. </p>
<p>When you see someone not performing, being effective or lacking in efforts, you feel the urge to help them, change them, or do things for them.</p>
<a>attraction</a> between you can be electrifying.
<h3>Relationship Difficulties</h3>
<a>anxious</a> and dependent. They may lose more and more abilities to take care of themselves, comfort themselves in
<a>stress</a>, or do household chores. When left on their own, they become extremely anxious. They may call you many times a day for the smallest decisions. They may even become physically ill and no longer able to function in society.
<a>burnout</a>. At the same time, you don’t see how things can be different. You may not show it on the outside, or do not feel there is an outlet for your emotions, but inside you are bottling up resentment.
<p>You are used to putting the focus on others’ needs rather than yourself, but you are a human after all and have needs and desires. When the responsibilities become too much, conscious and <a>unconscious</a> resentment is inevitable. </p>
<a>body image</a> issue or toxic shame, and not be able to feel carefree and spontaneous. The overfunctioner may also be so close to burnout that sex ceases to be a life priority.
<h3>Saving the Relationship</h3>
<p>When stuck in an overfunctioning-underfunctioning relationship, sometimes it can look as though there is no way out. </p>
<p>It is important to have compassion for both parties and understand that both over function and under function were first developed as a coping mechanism. </p>
<p>Deep down, the overfunctioner feels they are loved only for how ‘useful’ and dependable they are and find it difficult to feel unconditional love. </p>
<p>The underfunctioner wants to be independent and feel worthy as an adult, but is plagued with fears inherited from their childhood experience. </p>
<p>The overfunctioner can learn to let go, and tolerate the idea that certain things may not be done perfectly for a while. </p>
<p>The underfunctioner can also take small steps in taking responsibilities and allowing themselves to make decisions for themselves without over-doubting. </p>

<li>Toxic sibling relationships can result if parents are unavailable, depressed, aggressive, narcissistic, or controlling.</li>
<li>In the Golden Child and the Black Sheep Dynamic, one child is favoured over the others. The Black Sheep is the scapegoat of the family. </li>
<li>In the Mature One and the Eternal Child Dynamic, one sibling is mature beyond their age while the other is not given the opportunity to grow.</li>
<a>sibling</a> relationships can result if parents are unavailable, depressed, aggressive,
<a>narcissistic</a>, controlling, or favour one child over the others. When the parents do not set boundaries or manage the siblings' relationship healthily, these dynamics can become polarised and increasingly detrimental.
<h3>1. The Golden Child and the Black Sheep</h3>
<p>Although many would deny it, parents often favour one child over others. When they do so explicitly, the Golden Child and the Black Sheep dynamic can result. </p>

<a>dreams</a> come true. They have little tolerance for hardship, so whenever things get hard, they escape into their
<a>fantasies</a>. They may run from one situation to the next, one job to the next, one relationship to the next, and never commit to any meaningful course of actions.
<p>The Eternal Child is often charming, spontaneous, and playful. They are fun to be with but are not dependable partners. In many ways, they are children living in grown-up bodies and have difficulty being a functioning adult in the real world.</p>

<h1> Why Do People Have Repressed Anger? </h1>
<h2> Healthy anger expression helps us set boundaries and assert rights. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> How Can I Manage My Anger? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from anger</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>People’s habitual way of dealing with anger falls into one of two sets of patterns—externalising it or internalising it.</li>
<li>As people who repress anger divert their anger toward themselves, they often suffer from depression, anxiety, and somatisation.</li>
<li>When a person represses anger, they may find that many of their other desirable feelings also get numbed out. </li>
<p>Anger is a natural emotion and has to be processed in one way or the other. Normally, people’s habitual way of dealing with anger falls into one of two sets of patterns—externalising it or internalising it.</p>
<p>When these patterns are held in a rigid way or used excessively, there can be detrimental health consequences.</p>
<p>Internalised anger is also known as repressed anger, and it can take different forms. In this article, we will discuss what causes people to repress anger.</p>
<a>aggression</a>. However, being angry does not have to mean someone lashes out.
<h3>Repressed Anger and Not Being Able to Get Angry</h3>
<a>anxiety</a>, and somatisation (emotions turning into bodily pain or physical ailments).
<p>The problem is that, although it is <a>unconscious</a>, it takes a lot of energy to suppress and re-divert anger. Therefore, people with repressed anger may find that they rarely feel angry, but experience chronic tiredness.</p>
<a>personality disorder</a> or chronic depression.
<a>chronic pain</a>, chronic fatigue, frequent
<a>migraines</a>, and even cancer.
<h3>Reasons for Repressed Anger</h3>
<a>childhood</a> experiences ("nurture" factors) and social/cultural conditioning. One may have learned to repress their anger because, as a child, they were discouraged, punished, shamed, silenced, or ignored when they tried to express themselves.
<div> <h2>Anger Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>5 Symptoms of Repressed Anger</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Adaptive and Maladpative Anger </a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>Some people have aggressive, violent, and unpredictable parents, and they know better than to add anger to anger.</p>
<p>Some people have a difficult, <a>bullying</a>, or even <a>psychopathic</a> <a>sibling</a>, who would undoubtedly punish them with physical and verbal violence if they ever dare to compete with them for <a>attention</a>.</p>
<p>In many cases, parents mean well and try their best, but they are dealing with poverty, illness, or constant crises so they may not have energy to pay attention to how the child feels.</p>
<a>assertiveness</a> to the child or told them what it means to use anger in a healthy way.
<a>fear</a> of anger continues to linger. The message ingrained in them is that anger would lead to enormous conflict and even the end of a relationship.
<h3>Reclaiming Your Right to Anger</h3>
<p>The journey starts from the realisation that ignoring a problem doesn’t make it go away, and suppressing an emotion does not mean it will disappear.</p>
<p>Expressing your anger does not mean becoming aggressive or acting out. In fact, the more you can healthily use your anger as assertiveness, the less likely it is for you to become aggressive.</p>
<blockquote> <p>I would not look upon anger as something foreign to me that I have to fight…I have to deal with my anger with care, with love, with tenderness, with nonviolence. –Thich Nhat Hanh</p> </blockquote>

<h1> Why You May Want to Listen to Your Dreams </h1>
<h2> Three ways to interpret your dream symbols and unconscious materials. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Is Sleep Important? </li> <li> <a>Find a sleep counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Ambivalence is a part of life. Often, a part of us wants something, whilst the other part of us wants otherwise.</p>
<a>trauma</a>, we need another vehicle, such as Depth Psychology. In this approach, dream analysis is used as a tool for healing and exploration.
<a>Highly Sensitive People (HSP)</a> have vivid
<a>dreams</a> often; they usually remember them and have an innate ability to interpret them (Aron, 2011). This is likely due to the heightened receptivity of your senses. As an intuitive,
<a>empathic</a> person, at every given moment your senses pick up on thousands of unconscious signals from
<a>career</a> change or relationship breakup, having an existential crisis, getting attuned with your dreams would allow you to tap into a rich well of resources and answer many unanswered questions.
<p>In this post, I will introduce three angles from which we can start analysing our dreams.</p>
<p>If you are new to dream analysis, here are a few pointers to get started:</p>
<p>2. Start a Dream Journal</p>
<div> <h2>Sleep Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Sleep Is Nature's Medicine</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>How to Power Through the Afternoon Slump</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<h2>Interpreting Your Dreams</h2>
<p>Based on different theoretical orientations, there are infinite numbers of ways to approach dreams.</p>
<p>Sigmund Freud, one of the first psychologists who used dreams in his work, believes that dreams are trying to hide something that we have suppressed from ourselves. In this theory, these are usually our violent urges or <a>sexual</a> desires.</p>
<h2>Three Levels of Dream Interpretation</h2>
<p>Understanding our dreams requires some time and effort because they are communicating to us via symbols.</p>
<p>To simplify a highly complex and intricate process, you can experiment with interpreting your own dreams according to three levels:</p>
<ul><li>The explicit level</li> <li>The subjective level </li> <li>The archetypal (<a>spiritual</a>) level</li> </ul>
<p>Although the language of dreams is mostly symbolic, sometimes they talk to us on a literal level. With objective/explicit interpretation, your dream symbols are telling you something directly, with little disguise.</p>
<a>childhood</a> home; it may represent your actual home and the emotional energies and memories that come with it.
<h2>An Experiment: The “I Am” Exercise</h2>
<p>This is a dream analysis technique you can experiment with a dream. This approach focuses on the "subjective" level. It is based on the assumption that everything in the dream represents a part of yourself.</p>
<p>Firstly, record your dreams in ways suggested above.</p>
<p>When you have the materials written out, read through them.</p>
<p>Now, pick out the major characters and elements in your dreams and list them out. (e.g., car, train, apple, snake).</p>
<p>Then, expand on the symbolic meaning for each of these elements via free association.</p>
<p>To do this, you assume the role of these elements, then in a spontaneous manner, complete a series of sentences, five to 10 for each, that starts with "I am."</p>
<p>For example: "I am the car, and I am …" or "I am the apple, and I am …"</p>
<p>Do this for five to 10 times each.</p>
<p>These statements can be long or short, brief or detailed. It doesn’t matter if they seem "negative" or contradictory. The key is to welcome any spontaneous and abstract associations; try not to judge or rationalise your insights prematurely.</p>
<p>When you have completed the "I am" sentences with all the symbols, go through them again. This time, contemplate how all of them may be aspects of yourself.</p>
<p>For example, if you had written: ”I am the car, and I am fast. I am the car, and I catch a lot of attention”—consider how being "fast" and "attention-grabbing" may be a part of who you are.</p>
<p>When you have completed the "I am" exercise, it is often immediately apparent what the dream is telling you or asking of you. If not, simply leave it aside and let it sit. Something new may emerge if you repeat the exercise in a few days.</p>
<p>A dream is a piece of our reality. Its origin is both personal and transpersonal. If we give our dreams the respect and concern they deserve, they serve us in many ways. Our dreams heal us, inform us, warn us, and bring us spiritual <a>wisdom</a>.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Intellectual disability is a disorder marked by below average intellectual function and a lack of skills necessary for independent daily living. The condition begins in the developmental period.</p>
<a>aggression</a>, dependency, impulsivity, gullibility, passivity,
<a>self-injury</a>, stubbornness, low
<a>self-esteem</a>, low frustration tolerance, and high risk of
<p>Intellectual disability affects about 1 percent of the population, and prevalence for severe intellectual disability is approximately six per 1,000 people, according to the <a>DSM-5</a>.</p>

<li>Difficulties learning academic skills</li>
<li>Immaturity in social interactions compared with peers</li>
<li>Difficulty regulating emotions and behavior</li>
<li>Support needed in daily living tasks compared with peers</li>
<li>Spoken language is limited</li>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Causes of intellectual disability are numerous, and specific causes may be unknown in many cases.</p>
<p>A family may suspect intellectual disability if motor skills, language skills, and other cognitive skills do not seem to be developing in a child or are developing far more slowly than those among the child's peers.</p>
<p>The degree of impairment from intellectual disability ranges widely, from mild to profound. Less emphasis is now placed on degree of intellectual disability and more on the amount of intervention and care required for daily life.</p>
<p>Causes of intellectual disability can be roughly broken down into several categories:</p>
<li>Infection (congenital and postnatal)</li>
<li>Chromosomal abnormalities</li>
<li>Genetic abnormalities and inherited metabolic disorders</li>
<li>Nutritional deficits such as severe malnutrition</li>
<li>Severe and chronic social deprivation</li>
<a>goals</a> of treatment are to develop the person's potential to the fullest, and to allow them to participate in as many aspects of their community as possible. Special
<a>education</a> and training may begin as early as infancy; in fact, early intervention is a critical part of treatment.
<p>It is necessary for a specialist to evaluate the person for coexisting disorders that may require treatment. Behavioral approaches are important in understanding and working with individuals with intellectual disability.</p>

<h2> The Roots of Emotional Intelligence </h2>
<div> <h3> How self-aware is an emotionally intelligent person? </h3> </div>
<a>name an emotion</a> helps manage that emotion. Because of this, the emotionally intelligent have high
<a>self-confidence</a> and are realistic about themselves.
<div> <h3> Do the emotionally intelligent have a better handle on self-regulation? </h3> </div>
<a>emotion regulation</a>, or the ability to reduce how intense an emotion feels. Taking
<a>anxiety</a> down a notch is called down-regulation. The emotionally intelligent are able to shift gears and lighten mood, both internally and externally.
<div> <h3> Are the emotionally intelligent tuned into the emotions of others? </h3> </div>
<a>emotional signals</a> both from within oneself and from one's social environment could make one a better friend, parent,
<a>leader</a>, or romantic partner. Being in tune with others is less work for others.
<div> <h3> Are the emotionally intelligent more empathic? </h3> </div>
<a>empathic</a> are generally supportive of the people in their lives, and they easily modulate their emotions to match the mood of another person as well.

<li>Emotionally intelligent people are often magnets for narcissists. </li>
<li>Understanding this dynamic can help emotionally intelligent people spot narcissistic tendencies before investing in a relationship. </li>
<li>There are four phases of narcissistic manipulation: attraction, feeling small, sabotage, and countering manipulation with kindness.</li>
<a>emotionally intelligent</a> people often feel as if they are a magnet for narcissists. The constant drama and pain narcissists cause is humiliating and demoralizing. A person may

<a>emotionally intelligent</a> qualities and
<a>narcissistic</a> tendencies at various stages in a relationship may help a person see the abusive dynamic more quickly. Stepping back from a narcissist before too much is invested is critical.
<a>attraction</a>. A narcissist is often extremely attracted to a person who is emotionally intelligent. He or she strives to get close to a person who is warm and caring. Similarly, an emotionally intelligent person is flattered by the narcissist’s

<p>Personality, intelligence, and the differences that matter</p>
<p><a>Scott A. McGreal MSc.</a></p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2>Who Believes in Astrology? The Odd Role of Narcissism</h2> <p>A study finds that the opposing traits of narcissism and agreeableness each predict belief in astrology. This may be why.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Does Social Media Foster COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories?</a></h2> <p>People who get their news from platforms like Facebook and YouTube are more likely to believe in COVID-19 conspiracy theories than Twitter users.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Psychedelic Heart</a></h2> <p>A study finds that lifetime psychedelic use is associated with reduced odds of having heart disease or diabetes. However, why this intriguing result was found remains unclear.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>A Connection Between Dark Triad Traits and Attitudes to Having Children</a></h2>
<p>People with socially aversive “dark” traits,” particularly psychopathy and Machiavellianism, not only are cynical about humanity, but take a negative view of procreation. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Are Dark Triad Traits Adaptive?</a></h2> <p>Among the dark triad of personality, psychopathy and Machiavellianism may be bad for one’s own health and well-being, not just that of others.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>The Unexpected Relationship Between Ideology and Anxiety</a></h2>
<p>Despite claims that conservatives are more sensitive to threats, evidence suggests that people with left-wing economic views may be more likely to have anxiety disorders.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Empathy Inhibits Violent Online Role-Play, Psychopathy Facilitates It</a></h2> <p>Psychopathic traits are associated with preference for violent player vs. player action and less interest in non-violent role-playing. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How People Express Their Real Selves in Virtual Worlds </a></h2> <p>Despite the freedom to be whoever they want to be, most people’s behavior in a virtual world reflects who they are in real life. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Personality and Health-Related Behavior in the Pandemic</a></h2>
<p>During the pandemic, public health messages have been used to encourage health behavior. Appealing to people with "dark" personality traits is likely to be very challenging. </p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>What Role Does the Dark Triad Play in Creativity?</a></h2> <p>Among the “Dark Triad” of personality traits, narcissism is more tightly linked to creativity than Machiavellianism and psychopathy.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Personality Traits, Mental Illness, and Ideology</a></h2> <p>Survey data show that extreme liberals have poorer mental health than conservatives. Could this be linked to greater emotional vulnerability? </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Do Psychedelic Drugs Improve Health?</a></h2> <p>An intriguing study finds that psychedelic drug users report better health and less obesity. Could their more open personalities be a factor?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Fans of Horror Movies May Be More Resilient</a></h2> <p>A study finds that horror movie fans have been less distressed during the COVID outbreak. This might be because of higher sensation-seeking.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Do Antiheroes Appeal to People With Dark Traits?</a></h2> <p>A study finds that pop culture 'antiheroes' are particularly appealing to people with antisocial personality traits. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Liberals Are More Open to Experience Than Conservatives</a></h2> <p>Differences in openness to experience between liberals and conservatives may be more nuanced than most people think.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Does Religion Promote Self-Enhancement?</a></h2> <p>Although religions traditionally preach the virtue of humility and denounce pride, religiosity may function to prop rather than suppress egotism. But why is this so?</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Personality and Sheltering-in-Place During the Pandemic</a></h2> <p>Personality traits are robustly related to behavior even during these difficult times.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Who Supports Freedom of Speech? Tolerance vs. Prejudice </a></h2> <p>Intellectual humility, associated with higher intelligence, increases support for free speech, even for groups one does not like.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Who Is More Likely to Use Drugs, and Why</a></h2> <p>The kinds of recreational drugs people use reflect their personality traits. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Why Religious People Are Less Likely to Own Cats</a></h2>
<p>People who attend church frequently are less likely to be cat owners than other people. Could this be related to differences in personality between dog people and cat people?</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Link Between Attitudes to Sex Work and Gender Equality</a></h2> <p>Studies show that men who pay for sex and porn users are more, not less, supportive of women's rights than others. Why might this be the case? </p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>The Real and Fake Faces of Personality’s "Big One"</a></h2>
<p>Despite claims that there is a single super-factor underlying personality, research suggests that it is an artefact of measurement and socially desirable responding. </p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Total Perspective Vortex and You</a></h2> <p>Although some have claimed that contemplating cosmic vastness induces feelings of insignificance that cause existential dread, a new study shows little evidence of this.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Deceptive Food Calls and the Dark Triad</a></h2> <p>Dating someone to get a free meal, despite lacking any romantic interest in the person, is associated with selfish antisocial traits.</p> </div> </div> </div>
