<h1> How to Tackle Social Anxiety </h1>
<h2> If you feel unusually anxious in crowds or social situations, try these tips. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Anxiety? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Social anxiety afflicts millions of people and creates an extreme, highly aversive sense of self-awareness.</li>
<li>Social anxiety is a component of a desire to take care of others in social situations.</li>
<li>Many of the beliefs a person holds about the consequences of social situations are likely to prove untrue. </li>
<a>anxious</a> and uncomfortable in social situations — as if you’re under a microscope, with everyone else waiting for you to mess up and say something awkward — you are far from alone. According to fellow blogger
<a>Chloe Brotheridge, </a>15 million American adults experience similar feelings of social discomfort. It may be a challenge you’ve struggled with for quite some time, as well: Brotheridge
<a>suggested</a> that the symptoms of
<a>Social Anxiety</a> Disorder often first become noticeable in one’s early teenage years. Even so, take heart: if you want to make a change, it’s well within your reach to do so.

<a>Inner Critic</a> and Rise Above Social Anxiety, defined social anxiety in an interview with
<a>The Verge</a> as “self-consciousness on steroids.” It’s the experience of having your
<a>attention</a> drawn to your own perceived flaws; it’s a magnified perception of whatever you see as embarrassing or “not good enough” about yourself, your appearance, or your
<p>If you think this might be you, it may help to do this exercise on paper. Write this down: what exact circumstances are you most afraid of in a social situation? Who, exactly, do you think will judge you? What are you afraid they will say?</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified your expectations, you may be able to challenge them. Perhaps you’re concerned that others will laugh at you. Ask yourself:</p>
<li>How often does this happen?</li>
<li>Has it happened before, in a way that felt as bad as you imagined?</li>
<li>When, and who was present?</li>
<li>Is the group you are currently socializing with very likely to stop what they’re doing to make fun of you?</li>
<li>Are they likely to call out the aspects of yourself that you feel most sensitive about?</li>
<li>Even if so, perhaps it is less likely to occur than you expect, and perhaps its results will be less hurtful.</li>
<li>And if it came right down to it and someone did laugh at you, would that be as much of a catastrophe as you believe? Or would it merely be uncomfortable? If so, would there be something you can do to mitigate the outcome?</li>
<a>Clinical research has shown </a>that relaxing your social “safety behaviors” and being open about your flaws encourages other people to like you, not to laugh at you.

<h1> Some of Our Basic Instincts May Actually Imperil Us Socially </h1>
<h2> Research examines social threat and how we respond to others </h2>
<li>Social anxiety is common, affecting about 7 percent of people.</li>
<li>Social exclusion evokes negative feelings, and how we cope is important for individual well-being and social relationships.</li>
<li>People who feel greater threat after being excluded tend to make negative moral judgments of those who excluded them.</li>
<li>Moral disapproval plays an important role in relationships, serving to protect from disappointment—but at a high cost.</li>
<a>anxiety</a> before, during, and after social and performance (e.g. work,
<a>public speaking</a>) experiences, with fears of being harshly judged, high levels of
<a>embarrassment</a>, hard knocks on
<a>self-esteem</a>, social withdrawal, and isolation.
<a>7 percent of US adults have social anxiety disorder</a>. Social anxiety is associated with
<a>childhood</a> maltreatment (Boulton, 2011), notably
<a>bullying</a> (Coyle et al., 2021), and a greater likelihood of difficulties including social avoidance and
<a>stuttering</a> (Blood Blood, 2016), which often undermine social relationships.
<h3>How social threat affects perception of others</h3>
<a>the environment</a> for threats, raising levels of the
<a>hormone</a> cortisol during tasks involving social evaluation. Vigilance may help us to avoid harm, but because it is biased toward the negative, it threatens to undermine positive relatedness.
<a>fear</a> of making others angry), fears of criticism and embarrassment, and difficulty with strangers. A measure of
<a>loneliness</a>, the UCLA Loneliness Scale, was included.

<h1> Making Sense of Cluster C Personality Disorders </h1>
<h2> Avoidant, dependent, and obsessive compulsive personality disorders. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Personality? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Cluster C personality disorders—avoidant, dependent, and obsessive-compulsive—are characterized by anxious, fearful thinking or behavior.</li>
<li>Avoidant personality disorder interferes with a person's ability to interact with others and maintain day-to-day relationships.</li>
<li>People with dependent personality disorder become emotionally dependent on other people and make a big effort to please them.</li>
<li>With obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, a person is preoccupied with rules, orderliness, and control, but without unwanted thoughts.</li>
<a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a>, DSM-5, identifies 10 unique
<a>personality disorders</a>, each belonging to one of three groups known as "clusters."
<a>Cluster A </a>contains paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal disorders. In
<a>cluster B</a>, one will find borderline,
<a>narcissistic</a>, histrionic, and antisocial disorders. In cluster C, discussed below, the DSM outlines diagnostic criteria for avoidant, dependent, and
<h3>1. Avoidant Personality Disorder </h3>
<li>Low <a>self-esteem</a></li>
<a>stammering</a>, or otherwise getting embarrassed. You may also spend a great deal of time anxiously studying those around you for signs of approval or rejection.
<a>shyness</a> or nervousness in social settings may feel like criticism or rejection. This is especially true if you are teased, even in a good-natured way, about your avoidance of social situations.
<p>Social Impact of Avoidant Personality Disorder</p>
<p>According to the American <a>Psychiatric</a> Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), a person diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder needs to show at least four of the following criteria:</p>
<li>Avoids occupational activities that involve significant interpersonal contact, because of fears of criticism, disapproval, or rejection.</li>
<li>Is unwilling to get involved with people unless they are certain of being liked.</li>
<li>Shows restraint within intimate relationships because of the fear of being shamed or ridiculed.</li>
<li>Is preoccupied with being criticized or rejected in social situations.</li>
<li>Is inhibited in new interpersonal situations because of feelings of inadequacy.</li>
<li>Views self as socially inept, personally unappealing, or inferior to others.</li>
<li>Is unusually reluctant to take personal risks or to engage in any new activities because they may prove embarrassing.</li>
<a>childhood</a> because shyness, fear of strangers, social awkwardness, or being sensitive to criticism are often a normal part of child and adolescent development.
<h3>2. Dependent Personality Disorder </h3>
<p>Dependent personality disorder (DPD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed personality disorders. It occurs equally in men and women, usually in early to middle adulthood.</p>
<li>Inability to make decisions, even everyday decisions like what to wear, without the advice and reassurance of others.</li>
<li>Avoidance of adult responsibilities by acting passive and helpless. Dependence on a spouse or friend to make decisions like where to work and live.</li>
<li>Intense fear of abandonment and a sense of devastation or helplessness when relationships end. A person with DPD often moves right into another relationship when one ends.</li>
<li>Oversensitivity to criticism.</li>
<li><a>Pessimism</a> and lack of <a>self-confidence</a>, including a belief that they are unable to care for themselves.</li>
<li>Avoidance of disagreeing with others for fear of losing support or approval.</li>
<li>Inability to start projects due to lack of self-confidence.</li>
<li>Difficulty being alone.</li>
<li>Willingness to tolerate mistreatment and abuse from others.</li>
<li>Placing the needs of the caregivers above others.</li>
<li>Tendency to be naive and to <a>fantasize</a>.</li>

<h3>3. Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder </h3>
<p>Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) is a mental health condition in which a person is preoccupied with rules, orderliness, and control.</p>
<p>Causes: OCPD tends to occur in families, so <a>genes</a> may be involved. A person's childhood and environment may also play roles. This disorder can affect both men and women. It most often occurs in men.</p>
<a>anger</a> directly. People with OCPD have feelings that they consider more appropriate, like anxiety or frustration.
<p>Other Signs of OCPD Include:</p>
<li>Not being able to throw things away, even when the objects have no value</li>
<li>Lack of <a>generosity</a></li>
<li>Not wanting to allow other people to do things</li>
<li>Not willing to show affection</li>
<li>Preoccupation with details, rules, and lists</li>
<p>Exams and Tests: OCPD is diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation that assesses the history and severity of the symptoms.</p>
<p>Treatment: Medicines may help reduce anxiety and depression from OCPD. Talk <a>therapy</a> is thought to be the most effective treatment for OCPD. In some cases, combining medicines with talk therapy is more effective than either treatment alone.</p>

<h1> The High Cost of Liking to Be Alone </h1>
<h2> People who enjoy solitude are more likely to be socially excluded. </h2>
<li>People differ in the extent to which they enjoy spending time alone. </li>
<li>A series of studies was conducted to examine how people judge (and act towards) those who enjoy solitude. </li>
<li>People are more likely to ostracize those who enjoy solitude, but this ostracism can negatively affect solitude-seekers. </li>

<h3>It’s Easier for Everyone This Way</h3>
<p>Why do people exclude solitude-seekers? We found that two beliefs helped to explain our results.</p>
<li>First, self-interest: People believe that it would be difficult or unpleasant to spend time with solitude-seekers. When we exclude solitude-seekers, we are making things easier on ourselves by avoiding potentially awkward social situations.</li>
<p>The problem is that these beliefs, particularly the idea that solitude-seekers want to be excluded, are probably wrong.</p>
<a>intuition</a> is that even die-hard solitude-seekers would have a negative reaction to being excluded.
<p>They might be happy to be invited to your next party (or to work with you on your next project), and you might be happy to have them join.</p>
