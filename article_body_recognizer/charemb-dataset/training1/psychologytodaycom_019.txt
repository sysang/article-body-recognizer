<p>How many friends do you have? Do you find it easy to make friends? Perhaps, at times, you have wondered why some people have many friends, while others are solitary. Is it shyness? Lack of time? <a>Fear</a> of rejection?</p>
<p>Investigation of obstacles to making friends</p>
<p>At the end of the analysis, the barriers to <a>friendship</a> were categorized as 39 different reasons. </p>
<p>In Study 2, the reasons from the first investigation were analyzed to determine broader categories. The sample for this investigation consisted of 622 participants (295 men; average age of 34 years) from Cyprus and Greece.</p>
<p>Results: The percentages of participants who considered one of the six factors above important in preventing them from making friends are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Low trust (37%)</li> <li>Lack of time (29%)</li> <li>Introversion (23%)</li> <li>Pickiness (16%)</li> <li>Rejection fears (10%)</li> <li>Pragmatic reasons (2%)</li> </ul>
<p>The six factors and 39 obstacles to friendship, as reported by the authors, are listed in the table below.</p>

<p>The same can be said of those who have had to leave their hometown and native country, whether for social, economic, political, or environmental reasons. </p>
<a>loneliness</a> is not always due to difficulties in making friends, and yes, factors other than loneliness, including relationships with abusive “friends,” could also affect our mental health negatively.
<a>Time management</a> classes, programs that encourage participation in social events, and even personal
<a>psychotherapy</a> for managing mental health issues that hinder making friends and maintaining friendship can be helpful. With the right support and guidance, we can overcome many barriers to making friends.

<h1> Loneliness and Media Usage: A Study of 8 Million Americans </h1>
<h2> A new study finds increased loneliness among iGen. </h2>
<p> Posted August 22, 2019 </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: nastya_gepp/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Jean Twenge</a> and colleagues suggest that a lack of in-person interactions, as commonly seen in iGeners, is associated with
<ul><li>Silent (1925–1945)</li> <li>Baby Boomers (1946–1964)</li> <li>GenX (1965–1979)</li> <li>Millennials (1980–1994)</li> <li>iGen (1995–2012)</li> </ul>
<p>We now turn to how Twenge and colleagues conducted their study. Data came from two large longitudinal surveys:</p>
<ul><li><a>Monitoring the Future</a> (students in grades 8, 10, and 12)</li> <li><a>American Freshman Survey</a> (students entering college)</li> </ul>
<p>In addition, researchers measured participants’ loneliness (sample item: “A lot of times I feel lonely”) and frequency of social media use—MySpace, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram....</p>
<h3>In-person interactions, loneliness, and social media usage</h3>
<p>Comparisons between individuals going through <a>adolescence</a> in different time periods showed that in more recent decades teenagers are less likely to spend time with their friends (be it going to the mall, the movies, parties, etc).</p>
<p>And college-bound seniors in 2016, compared to those in 1987, spent 4 hours and 22 minutes less each week in social interactions with friends. They also partied less (a weekly reduction of 3 hours and 28 minutes).</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Antranias/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Examining the trends in loneliness, the authors found loneliness increased between 2010 and 2017—especially among female, lower socioeconomic status, and Black/Hispanic adolescents. </p>
<p>When comparing results at the group level and individual level, the following patterns were observed:</p>
<p>At the group level, results indicate that young people are spending more time using digital media and less engaging in personal interaction, meaning that digital media use may be displacing physical personal interactions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion: Causes and implications of fewer interactions and more loneliness</h3>
<p>Whatever the cause(s) of the reduced in-person social interaction and increases in loneliness, these changes have important implications, some of which are:</p>
<p>-Less in-person interaction translates to fewer opportunities to develop social skills; this has a negative impact on multiple life domains (e.g., work, <a>friendship</a>, <a>romantic relationships</a>).</p>
<p>-Increased loneliness is associated with negative outcomes, such as impaired immune function, poor sleep quality, and<a> depression—which has recently been on the rise.</a><sup>2</sup></p>

<a>loneliness increases the likelihood of experiencing both acute pain and chronic pain</a>. This is the first investigation examining the association between loneliness, social exclusion, and pain in the general population (of half a million people).
<a>social isolation</a>) can be defined in a number of ways. In the paper that will be reviewed today, loneliness is defined as “a subjective, negative feeling of disconnectedness or isolation.”
<a>medical and psychological conditions</a>, like
<a>insomnia</a>, heart disease, stroke, lung disease, and pain.
<p>With this information in mind, let us review the present study, which examines the link between loneliness, social exclusion, and pain.</p>
<p>The outcome variables consisted of sleep, acute pain, and <a>chronic pain</a>.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Cocoparisienne/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Chronic pain is prevalent. And more than half of chronic pain patients struggle with insomnia, anxiety, depression, or other mental health problems.</p>
<p>Pain is influenced by many factors, including isolation and loneliness. The investigation reviewed here found that social exclusion and loneliness were associated with an increased prevalence of pain (acute and chronic).</p>

<p>Of course, this relationship may be bidirectional. In other words, greater pain might also result in a higher prevalence of loneliness and social exclusion, at least in part because pain makes it more difficult for a person to socialize or work.</p>

<a>bullying</a>) to full participation in society may also reduce pain.

<h1> The Most Effective Emotion Regulation Strategy </h1>
<h2> Therapists rank the effectiveness of emotion regulation strategies. </h2>

<li>People use a variety of emotion regulation strategies (e.g., distraction, concealing emotions) to cope with challenging situations. </li>
<li>Therapists of different orientations consider problem-solving to be one of the most effective emotion regulation strategies. </li>
<li>Problem-solving involves defining the problem and one’s goal, identifying obstacles, and implementing and then evaluating potential solutions. </li>

<a>Psychotherapy</a>: Theory, Research and Practice, by Southward and colleagues, explores the most effective
<a>emotion regulation</a> strategies, as chosen by 582 therapists in the U.S.
<h3>Best Emotion Regulation Strategies: Investigation</h3>
<p>Participants were 582 practicing trainees and therapists, with an average age of 42 years; 76 percent were female; 86 percent were Caucasian; they had a median of 4,000 hours of experience.</p>
<p>The sample’s primary theoretical orientations consisted of <a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy (CBT) and non-CBT.</p>
<li>CBT: Cognitive (18 percent), behavioral (25 percent), and third wave/acceptance-based therapy (12.0 percent).</li>
<li>Non-CBT: Existential (3 percent), interpersonal (7 percent), psychodynamic (15 percent), Rogerian (4 percent), and other (16.0 percent).</li>
<p>The clinicians were tasked with identifying, for patients facing the above stressful situations, the best <a>emotion regulation</a> strategy from the following list:</p>
<p>Subsequently, the therapists were required to rate the effectiveness of each strategy in helping patients feel better (from zero, meaning not effective at all, to 100, meaning extremely effective).</p>
<h3>Best Emotion Regulation Strategies: Findings</h3>
<p>The results showed none of the strategies was rated as most effective in all situations.</p>

<a>mental illness</a>; in contrast, emotional suppression, which overlaps with the concept of concealing one’s emotions, was positively associated with mental illness (r = 0.34).
<h3>Emotion Regulation and Problem-Solving</h3>
<p>Let us end with a brief review of problem-solving, which, as noted above, is considered a highly effective emotion regulation strategy for managing stressful situations.</p>
<p>Problem-solving is an active and goal-oriented approach to dealing with stress. It involves trying to modify the situation or its consequences (as opposed to modifying the unpleasant emotions experienced in the situation).</p>
<p>Problem-solving involves the following:</p>
<li>Defining the problem is an important initial step because real-life problems are often complicated—involving thoughts, emotions, values, attitudes, and actions of one or more people.</li>
