<div><div><p>The military’s reluctance to take a bolder stand is likely to have consequences, warned one former military prosecutor.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ann E. Marimow</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Robert Barnes</div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<a>vaccine policies</a> affecting nearly 100 million workers. Most already have made the choice to be vaccinated, but Biden has said the numbers are not good enough.
<div><div><p>One measure requires large private companies to implement a vaccination requirement or impose a masking and weekly testing regimen. The second applies to health-care workers at facilities that receive certain federal funding.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Together, <a>the cases test a signature aspect of the White House’s response to the pandemic</a> that has killed more than 800,000 people in the United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s an overview of the cases, the history and the issues that the justices will consider Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Can the U.S. government force private companies and health-care facilities to require vaccinations for their workers?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government has never before tried to impose a vaccine-or-test policy on U.S. companies and their workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Employers must provide paid time off to get vaccinated, but they are not required to pay for coronavirus testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The rules were set to take effect Jan. 4, but OSHA pushed back the date in response to the litigation and said it would not immediately issue citations for those not in compliance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other policy from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires vaccinations for more than 17 million health-care workers at 76,000 facilities that receive federal money tied to those programs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Who is challenging the vaccination policies and why?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Any delay, according to the Biden administration, will “cost dozens or even hundreds of lives per day.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The vaccine mandate for health-care workers, opponents say, is “plainly unlawful.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Have workplace safety requirements previously been issued on an emergency basis?</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>OSHA, the federal safety agency, has used its <a>emergency authority infrequently</a> after mixed results in court in the 1970s and ’80s in response to rules to regulate exposure to benzene, asbestos and certain pesticides.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The term “grave danger” is not defined in statute, and courts also have not provided clear guidance about the term.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hasn’t the Supreme Court upheld vaccination requirements for college campuses and those imposed by local officials?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, the justices have generally been supportive of vaccination requirements by local governments and universities. For instance, it allowed New York and Maine to mandate vaccinations for their health-care workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the court has also been skeptical when it comes to federal agency power generally, and with respect to the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The justices, for instance, rejected an eviction moratorium — first imposed by the Trump administration and extended by Biden — because it said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had exceeded its authority.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>What have lower courts said about Biden’s policies?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They are divided.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after the administration announced the rules for private companies in November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit blocked enforcement of the policy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But lawsuits sprung up around the nation and were consolidated for review by a different court. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit dissolved the 5th Circuit’s stay, saying the rules could go into effect.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Opponents then asked the Supreme Court to intervene.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The lower courts also were divided on the health-care worker mandate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit dismissed a request from Florida to stop the requirement. But a district judge in Missouri stopped the rules, and the 5th Circuit agreed with a challenge from Louisiana.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the Supreme Court, a coalition of Republican-led states said the rules should be blocked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Biden administration said its authority is clear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>What about the Supreme Court’s own coronavirus policies for the justices and court visitors? </b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The courthouse has been closed to the public since March 2020. All nine justices have been vaccinated and received boosters. Justice Amy Coney Barrett had covid before she was confirmed to the high court in September 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After returning to in-person oral arguments this past fall, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh participated in some from home after he tested positive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The justices have not required lawyers arguing cases and credentialed reporters observing the proceedings to be vaccinated. But they must have received negative test results and be masked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The health-care worker cases are <i>Biden v. Missouri </i>and<i> Becerra v. Louisiana</i>. The OSHA cases are <i>National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor </i>and<i> Ohio v. Department of Labor</i>.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amy Cheng</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:38 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Pope Francis lamented Wednesday that many<b> </b>couples are choosing to have pets over children, saying that a trend of forgoing child-rearing “takes some of our humanity away.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Today … we see a form of selfishness,” the pope <a>said</a>, according to translations in multiple reports. “We see that some people do not want to have a child.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>And last month, the pontiff warned that Italy’s declining number of births, which reached its nadir since the 1860s, may threaten the country’s future, Reuters <a>reported</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Her father, Adam Montgomery, admitted that he had hit Harmony in the face after he returned from the bathroom in July 2019 to see her covering her infant brother’s mouth to stop him from crying, Montgomery’s uncle told police.</p></div>

<p>A stubborn fire at the stately Treasury Department building forced 1,200 workers from their offices yesterday and caused traffic chaos downtown at the height of the evening rush hour.</p>
<p>"It was a hard fire to control," said D.C. Fire Chief Otis J. Latin Sr.</p>
<p>Firefighters used axes and chain saws to cut into the roof and attack pockets of fire between it and the ceiling of the fifth floor.</p>
<p>"What we had was several layers of ceiling on the fifth floor," said fire Capt. James Miller. "So we just had a slight indication of smoke {at first}. Once you open the areas up the smoke increases, the fire increases and it gets worse."</p>
<p>Fire department crews remained at the scene late last night tamping out embers and checking the building's roof. Officials said they likely would remain there throughout the night.</p>
<p>Several streets in the area, including 15th Street adjacent to the Treasury building, were to remain closed at least until 8 a.m. today, law enforcement officials said.</p>
<p>A Treasury Department spokesman said employees who work in the building and the annex across the street should not report to work today.</p>
<p>Although the exact cause of the blaze had not been determined, fire and Secret Service officials said it ignited while renovation work was being done on the roof. The work has been going on for about a year, a Treasury spokesman said.</p>
<p>Treasury employees said they saw wisps of smoke shortly before the alarm to evacuate the building sounded at about 4:45 p.m. Within minutes, the wisps became billowing clouds of thick smoke that shrouded part of downtown and the Mall.</p>
<p>Kathleen Byrne, an international economist who works at the central corridor of the fifth floor, said she was at her desk when she heard an alarm go off. Several minutes later, she opened the door and smelled smoke.</p>
<p>"It's very sad to stand out here and watch the building in smoke," she said three hours later. "There are a lot of dedicated people in that building. To have to come out here and watch this.</p>
<p>"I have work to do," she said. "We're all crashing for the summit" of industrialized nations scheduled to begin this morning.</p>
<p>"It kind of smelled like the Fourth of July," said Patrick Mezzetta, a Treasury management analyst. "I thought something was up, but I didn't think it was going to last an hour or two hours. When we left, it didn't seem that serious."</p>
<p>The top floor of the building was damaged by smoke and water. Calvin Mitchell, a Treasury spokesman, said the department would not know the extent of the damage in the rest of the building until today.</p>
<p>A Secret Service spokesman said the fire did not affect security at the White House, next door. He said the roof of the Treasury Department building, at 15th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, is used in security operations during special events.</p>
<p>Complicating efforts to battle the blaze was that the section of the roof being removed by contractors contained asbestos, fire officials said.</p>
<p>Miller said firefighters took precautions against breathing the carcinogen, which he said is harmful only if it is inhaled. He said the asbestos danger was greatest in loose material rather than smoke from the fire.</p>
<p>"The asbestos was contained on the exterior of the roof . . . not on the inside of the building. That is as far as we've been told," he said.</p>
<p>Latin said that paints, glues and other flammables that were being used in the renovation helped fuel the fire.</p>
<p>"In New York, there is traffic, but usually there are two ways to get any place. Here there is only one," Abrahim said.</p>
<p>A block away, Carrie Deal, 19, sat in traffic, heading east on H Street toward home on Capitol Hill.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Kathy Orton</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 3, 2021 at 5:30 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>The yellow clapboard house in Georgetown is best known as the house where Julia Child taught cooking classes and tested recipes for the cookbook “Mastering the Art of French Cooking.” But it is notable for other reasons.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s one of the few houses left after gentrification turned the area [that was] owned by a Black family,” said Rory Veevers-Carter, who bought the house in 2015.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Julia Child Slept Here: ‘Big Garland’ was key addition at on Olive Street home</p></div>
<div><p>Julia Child’s D.C. home had lost its luster. But it’s getting ready to sparkle again.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The state of the house didn’t deter Veevers-Carter who had been searching for a fixer-upper in Georgetown.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t do [remodeling] professionally, but I enjoy doing it,” he said. “This house, I built it for myself, built it the way I wanted it because I was going to be living here.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Veevers-Carter worked with architect Dale Overmyer on the renovation, but “95 percent of it was designed as I went along,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The floating stairs, which replaced the spiral stairs, was one inspiration that came to him along the way. The wood on the stairs was reclaimed from the house.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even though the house has gone through several renovations over the years, Veevers-Carter said he did his best to preserve its character. The floors, which had to be replaced because of rot, are rustic white oak.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I had them cross-sawn, which is an older way of sawing, which gives you that feeling that this is an old cut,” he said. “I was trying to keep the history of the house as much as I could.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I really wanted that as your entertainment space,” Veevers-Carter said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The paint wasn’t Veevers-Carter’s only find. When he excavated the lowest level to create more living space, he uncovered several interesting relics that he offered to a D.C. archaeological program.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By digging down about 15 feet, Veevers-Carter turned a small mechanical room under the kitchen into another floor with a den, a laundry room and a pink marble-tiled hammam (steam room).</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The renovation took longer than expected. The permitting process alone dragged on for three years. But in the end, the house has gone from eyesore to eye-catching.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The three-bedroom, four-bathroom, 3,150-square-foot house is listed at $3.5 million.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>A Tesla factory worker alleges sexual harassment is rampant in a rare lawsuit. Now other women are stepping forward.</h1></div>
<h2>Jessica Barraza said co-workers commented on her body and touched her inappropriately; supervisors and HR failed to put a stop to the behavior, she alleges</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Faiz Siddiqui</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 19, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Barraza on Thursday filed a rare lawsuit against the electric vehicle maker, alleging Tesla fostered a climate of sexual harassment at its Fremont, Calif., factory, where she says she was subjected to catcalling and aggressive physical touching.</p>
<b> </b>That was the last straw, she said.
<div><div><p>“After almost three years of experiencing all the harassment, it robs your sense of security — it almost dehumanizes you,” said Barraza, a production associate who works on the Tesla Model 3.</p></div></div>
<p>Barraza said this workplace culture is bred at the top of the company, citing a joking tweet by CEO Elon Musk referencing a university he planned to start: Texas Institute of Technology Science. (He left readers to interpret the acronym: TITS.)</p>
<div><div><p>Tesla did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The company, which has not had an active public relations department since 2020,<b> </b>does not typically respond to press inquiries.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The suit is being brought under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, citing sexual harassment and failure to prevent sexual harassment under the law.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>by the plaintiff or themselves experienced sexual harassment at Tesla’s Fremont facilities, describing the culture as male-driven, retaliatory and unwelcoming to women.
<div><p>Tesla gave workers permission to stay home rather than risk getting covid-19. Then it sent termination notices.</p></div>
<div><p>Jury orders Tesla to pay more than $130 million in discrimination suit, which alleged racist epithets and hostile work environment</p></div>
<div><div><p>Tesla has faced public accusations that its company culture is hostile to people of color.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The initial suit by Diaz, who is Black, said that workers at the company encountered a scene “straight from the Jim Crow era,” and many experienced frequent racist harassment while supervisors didn’t respond.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Tesla’s progressive image was a facade papering over its regressive, demeaning treatment of African-American employees,” the suit said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Another lawsuit filed in 2017, which remains active, called the company a “hotbed for racist behavior.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tesla’s recent Full Self-Driving update made cars go haywire. It may be the excuse regulators needed.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Nallely Gamboa, a former Tesla production associate, said she alerted senior managers to harassment at the factory and quit after the behavior didn’t stop.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Being a woman working at Tesla was very uncomfortable when it came to male associates, supervisors, leads,” she said. “I’ve seen with my own eyes and I went through it myself.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In some instances, women perpetuated the harassment, Gamboa recounted. Gamboa said she was working on a task when she felt something between her thighs. It was a broomstick, wielded by a female colleague.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“She thought it was funny; she started smirking,” she recalled.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Gamboa says she spoke with a supervisor about the incident. Eventually she was moved to work in a different part of the factory, which multiple employees said was a common pattern for those who complained about sexual harassment.</p></div>
<b> </b>crying on the phone and telling me all this stuff, it sounded like a completely different person,” he said. “It sounded like she was walking on quicksand.”
<div><p>The government helped Tesla conquer electric cars. Now it’s helping Detroit, and Elon Musk isn’t happy.</p></div>
<b> </b>back against the allegations. In response to the 2017 suit alleging a “hotbed for racist behavior” the company published a blog post calling it a “
<a>Hotbed of Misinformation</a>.” And last month, after the jury verdict in the racial harassment trial, Tesla’s Workman
<a>took exception to </a>the verdict, but said efforts to address employee concerns were a work in progress.

<div><p>But the visibility of boogaloo supporters at recent protests — dressed in trademark Hawaiian shirts and carrying military-style rifles — had alarmed researchers who for months had warned about the danger the groups posed.</p></div>
<div><p>Men wearing Hawaiian shirts and carrying guns add a volatile new element to protests</p></div>
<div><div><p>The shooting that killed one security guard and injured another took place May 29, near where demonstrators had gathered to protest the police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Facebook posts also figure in Carrillo’s prosecution, with court documents quoting one attributed to him: “Use their anger to fuel our fire. Think outside the box. We have mobs of angry people to use to our advantage.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Carrillo also is accused of killing a sheriff’s deputy in a separate incident in California’s Santa Cruz County. Carrillo’s lawyer has cautioned against a “rush to judgement” on the charges. </p></div></div>
<div><p>An officer was gunned down. The killer was a ‘boogaloo boy’ using nearby peaceful protests as cover, feds say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Like Carrillo, these men were advocates of the boogaloo ideology, according to the charging documents, with a goal of causing “an incident to incite chaos and possibly a riot” among the largely peaceful protests.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Denver police last month separately seized military-style rifles, handguns, ammunition and gas masks from the car of a man claiming allegiance to boogaloo ideas and attending a Floyd protest rally but did not charge him with any crimes.</p></div>
<div><p>Scant evidence of antifa shows how sweeping the protests for racial justice have become</p></div>
<div><div><p>Following the shootings of the security guards, which authorities say involved a second man who drove Carrillo to the courthouse, Facebook banned both men.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Federal authorities have traditionally treated domestic militant groups, even the most extreme, far differently from foreign ones, though there has been increasing recognition in some quarters of the threat posed by right-wing extremists.</p></div>
<div><div><p>There has been an ongoing debate at the federal level about whether domestic terrorists merit more focus, along the lines of the formal designation that the State Department imposes on some foreign groups.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>U.S. officials have rarely mentioned boogaloo publicly but have said that they will act against violent extremists, regardless of ideology, when they commit crimes.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>What is antifa?</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>The recent violence has raised questions about whether a more focused and systemic response is warranted for groups like boogaloo, which openly espouse violence against the police and other government authorities.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Across the United States, an alarming number of people are lashing out in aggressive and often cruel ways in response to policies or behavior they dislike.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think people just feel this need to feel powerful, in charge and connected to someone again,” said Jennifer Jenkins, a school board member in Brevard County, Fla., who said she has faced harassment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Layer that onto other recent national crises — including race-driven social unrest, an economic recession, the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and myriad extreme-weather disasters — and people can hardly bear the stress.</p></div>
<div><div><p>That danger heightens the feeling of whiplash among people tired of the pandemic’s twists and turns, said Roxane Cohen Silver, a professor of psychological science at the University of California at Irvine.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>vaccines are dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have consistently said the immunizations are safe and effective.
<div><div><p>“We’re still in danger, we’re still cooped up in our houses to some extent, we’re still not free to move about because of malevolent lies,” said Penso, who lives in D.C.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On a flight this year, Teddy Andrews’s colleague walked over to him on the verge of tears. A passenger was refusing to wear a mask and giving her a hard time, his fellow flight attendant said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Andrews approached the man, who called him the n-word and said, “I don’t have to listen to a damn thing you say, this is a free country,” according to Andrews’s testimony later before a congressional committee.</p></div>
<div><div><p>A tense exchange followed, with Andrews asking the man to don a mask to protect his fellow passengers. Eventually, the man backed down and put on the face covering.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“What we see manifested in society, you’ll see it happening in the air, you see it happening in restaurants, you see it happening in malls, you see it happening in school board meetings,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>People are also faced with constant news about the virus, making coping even more difficult, said UC-Irvine’s Silver.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In Alaska Native villages and across communities of color, the enduring silence of grief</p></div>
<div><div><p>Stress from those cascading traumas is cumulative, Silver <a>has found</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At a board meeting in October, Jenkins said she supported parents’ right to protest but would not stand for credible threats of violence against her family.</p></div></div>
<a>she said.</a> “I reject that when they are using their First Amendment rights on public property, they’re also going behind my home and brandishing weapons to my neighbors.”
<div><div><p>“Part of me feels like I have to finish this,” she said. “But,” she believes, “there is never going to be a concise finish.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Her father, Hal Coleman, on Sunday expressed gratitude for prayers, messages and support the family had received.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Forsythias are one of the first flowering plants to bloom in the spring — often signaling the change of season.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But this year, some forsythias are blooming in December.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The premature bloom is indicative of an abnormally warm kickoff to a season that is heating up faster than any other. Winter officially began Tuesday, but in many places, that is hard to recognize.</p></div></div>
<div><p>First day of winter: Tuesday’s winter solstice signals brighter days ahead</p></div>
<div><div><p>Lawrence Connolly, a resident of Boston for 61 years, first spotted flowering forsythia in his backyard in West Roxbury last week, after the temperature had surpassed 60 degrees for two days in a row.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never noted Forsythia blooming in December before, I did think it unusual,” he wrote in a message. Others in New England also have observed the blooming flower.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Nicknamed the Easter tree, the woody shrubs first produce bright yellow bell-shaped flowers before their leaves emerge. They retain their leaves until late fall and go dormant in winter until milder weather returns in March or April.</p></div>
<p>“Those are plants that should be putting on their flowers in the spring, after winter, not before,” said Theresa Crimmins, the director of the USA National Phenology Network and a research professor at the University of Arizona.</p>
<div><p>December temperatures are traditionally near or below freezing in the northern and central United States, but much of the country has been hit with repeated warm spells — temperatures up to 30 to 40 degrees <a>above normal</a>.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Forecasts show temperatures reaching the 70s in the Midwest on Christmas Eve and the 60s in the Mid-South and Mid-Atlantic on Christmas Day.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Green Christmas: Springlike warmth to swell over Lower 48</p></div>
<div><div><p>This unusual winter warmth isn’t a one-off, though.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>States experiencing the fastest winter warming are in the Northeast and the Great Lakes region.</p></div></div>
<p>Other studies have shown the length of winter season shrinking globally as well. From 1952 to 2011, winter shrank by at least 2.1 days per decade on average. By 2100, winter could be less than two months and could start a half-month later.</p>
<div><p>Every season except summer is getting shorter, a sign of trouble for people and the environment</p></div>
<div><div><p>Crimmins said the higher temperatures can affect hibernation behavior in mammals as well as insects that overwintered as eggs or larvae in the soil. It also affects frogs and turtles that have buried themselves in mud.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Warmer winters also don’t suppress disease-carrying insects as effectively as colder winters. Mosquitoes and ticks can move to new regions that were too cold to live previously, spreading diseases more widely.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“The biological parts of the [Earth] system don’t look at the calendar,” Crimmins said. “They are responding to what’s happening in temperature and the moisture availability for the most part.”</p></div>
<a>fatal freeze in Texas</a>. Additionally, the Dakotas and Montana have experienced some recent winters colder than were observed in the 1970s.
<div><p>Climate change may have worsened deadly Texas cold wave, new study suggests</p></div>
<div><div><p>Across the eastern United States, Climate Central <a>found</a> that cold weather still will occur in the coming decades, although cold snaps have become shorter and less frequent recently.</p></div></div>
<p>“Though we’re seeing warmth now, and though we’re seeing some anomalous plant responses, it’s too early to know if it’s going to be a totally off-the-rails spring — with no winter at all,” Crimmins said.</p>

<div><div><p>The Supreme Court said Wednesday that it will decide whether Congress can authorize state court suits by service members and military veterans who say their public employers discriminated against them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At issue is the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), passed in 1994 the wake of the Persian Gulf War to make it illegal for employers to discriminate on the basis of military service.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An appeals court in Texas, consistent with other state courts, said Congress cannot constitutionally authorize lawsuits against states.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. military faulted for burn-pit use</p></div>
<div><div><p>Torres and Texas disagree about whether the Texas Department of Public Safety offered proper accommodations for the returning trooper’s condition.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But Torres resigned and later sued for $5 million under the federal law. In the meantime, he and his wife, Rosie Lopez-Torres, have started the organization Burn Pits 360 to advocate for service members injured from toxic exposure.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Texas argues that the state appeals court got it right, as other state courts reviewing the law have similarly concluded.</p></div></div>
<a>filing at the Supreme Court</a>. It added, “both Texas and federal law afforded Torres numerous other remedies for any alleged discrimination. He simply chose not to use them.”
<div><p>Biden wonders publicly whether burn pits caused his son’s death. Activists want him to do more on the issue.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Supreme Court asked the Biden administration whether it should take the law to settle the question, and Solicitor General Elizabeth B. Prelogar <a>advised against it</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said the law was consistent with Congress’s war powers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But she said cases like Torres’s were rare and that the lower courts should be given more time to explore the legal issues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Supreme Court disagreed, and <i>Torres v. Texas Department of Public Safety </i>will be heard later this term.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>On Friday evening, the committee said that due to a medical condition, the Clark session would be postponed until Dec. 16.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last month, the Justice Department filed contempt-of-Congress charges against former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon, who refused to meet with the committee or provide any documents in response to a congressional subpoena.</p></div></div>

<p>Rather than pursue contempt charges against Clark the way it has against Bannon, the committee could grant Clark immunity in exchange for testimony. But in the past, some people given congressional immunity have still faced criminal prosecutions.</p>

<div><div><p>Brand said it was a momentous decision for the Justice Department under Garland to abandon decades of department practice of supporting current or former government officials who assert executive privilege.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>But he said the intensity of the political fights surrounding the department has changed since Garland’s earlier days as a prosecutor — shifting the climate in which he must operate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Now you have a level of criticism which is dramatically different,” he said. “The Washington game has changed, and they’ve dragged the Justice Department into it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>DiBiagio, who teaches at Washington and Lee University School of Law, said Garland’s next steps will be difficult, but important.</p></div></div>
<header><div/><div><div><a>Europe</a></div></div><div><h1>Biden says Pope Francis called him a good Catholic and said he should keep receiving Communion</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Chico Harlan</div>,</span></div><div><span><div>Seung Min Kim</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Michelle Boorstein</div></span></div></span></div><div>October 29, 2021 at 4:04 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s what to know:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Biden’s account of the meeting provides potential insight on Francis’s thinking about an issue that has divided the U.S. Catholic Church.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Later Friday, Biden sought to rebuild trust with French President Emmanuel Macron, saying the United States had been “clumsy” in its handling of a defense deal that upset France.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● Officials representing the Group of 20 nations announced a new global body for coordinating responses to the next pandemic, but the initiative faced immediate criticism because it appears to lack resources.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>● After the G-20 summit in Rome this weekend, the country leaders will continue on to Glasgow, Scotland, for the COP26 climate conference.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“We just talked about the fact he was happy that I was a good Catholic and I should keep receiving Communion,” Biden said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Mario Draghi, hosting the G-20, has put Italy in enviable shape</p></div>
<div><div><p>“The whole point of Catholicism is that we’re not good and we want to be better,” White said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Afterward, when the pope and the president exchanged gifts with a wider delegation in the room, Biden was clearly relishing the moment — even as he was running late for other meetings.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>According to video from the Vatican, Biden at one point sidled up to the pope and told him of a presidential token called a command coin — a coin that can be given to warriors and leaders.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“And you are the most significant warrior for peace I’ve ever met,” Biden said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden described the coin, which had a U.S. seal on the front, and on the back paid tribute to a National Guard brigade in which his son Beau had served.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m only kidding about this. If next time I see you, you don’t have it, you have to buy the drinks,” said Biden, who then explained he was a teetotaler.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Francis, in turn, made a half-audible joke about whiskey.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A White House official, speaking after the meeting on the condition of anonymity to describe the meeting, said the “engagement between the two was very warm when the delegation arrived in the room.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was laughter and clear rapport between President Biden and Pope Francis,” the official said.</p></div></div>

<a>one of the gifts</a> Francis presented was his encyclical on the environment — a pointed message to a leader who pulled the United States out of the Paris climate agreement.
<a>old Latin Mass</a>, the most vocal criticism came from the United States, where
<a>the rite is most widely used</a>. More recently, in speaking to Jesuits during a trip to Slovakia, Francis
<a>took aim</a> at a “large Catholic television channel” that he said was continually speaking ill of him and doing the “work of the devil.”

<div><div><p>“You ask me most often, if not every time, about abortion,” <a>Psaki said</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Is there a problem with this?” the EWTN correspondent, Owen Jensen, asked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is not,” said Psaki, who eventually noted that Biden and Francis agree on many issues, but abortion is not one of them.</p></div></div>
