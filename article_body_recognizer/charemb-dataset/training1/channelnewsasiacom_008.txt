<div> <div> <a> Natasha Ganesan </a> </div> </div>
<p>The contribution will supplement the Singapore Red Cross' donation of <a>US$50,000 each to the Malaysian Red Crescent and Philippine Red Cross</a>, said the ministry.</p>
<p>"The floods in Malaysia and Typhoon Rai in the Philippines have resulted in the loss of many lives and widespread destruction of property, causing hardship and suffering to many communities," MFA said.</p>
<p>"As a close friend and fellow ASEAN member state, Singapore stands by Malaysia and the Philippines during this difficult time."</p>
<p><a>More than 20 people have died in Malaysia</a> as a result of severe flooding as of Tuesday, while more than 65,000 people have been displaced from their homes.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, <a>at least 375 people were killed</a> and hundreds injured after Typhoon Rai lashed through the country’s central and southern regions.</p>
<p>More than 400,000 people have also fled their homes, as the storm destroyed infrastructure and knocked out communication and electricity in many areas.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Two more Tiananmen monuments removed from Hong Kong university campuses </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>A "Goddess of Democracy" statue holding aloft a flame at Hong Kong's Chinese University had been removed from a public piazza just before dawn by workmen, according to pictures posted online.</p>
<p>The university said in a statement that the "unauthorised statue" had been taken away.</p>
<p>"Following an internal assessment, and as the manager of the university campus, CUHK has removed the statue," it read.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Lingnan University also took down a Tiananmen massacre wall relief sculpture, that also included a depiction of the "Goddess of Democracy", according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Unlike mainland China, where Chinese authorities ban any memorials or public commemoration of June 4, Hong Kong had previously remained the only place on Chinese soil where such commemorations were permissible.</p>
<p>Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 and was promised wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms by China under a so-called "one country, two systems" arrangement.</p>
<a>dismantled and removed an 8m tall "pillar of shame"</a> statue from its campus site that for more than two decades has commemorated pro-democracy protesters killed during China's Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.
<p>Authorities have been clamping down in Hong Kong under a China-imposed national security law that human rights activists say is being used to suppress civil society, jail democracy campaigners and curb basic freedoms.</p>
<p>Chinese and Hong Kong authorities say the security laws have restored order and stability after mass protests in 2019, and that fundamental rights and freedoms are still respected.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Badminton player Loh Kean Yew has progressed to the quarter-finals of the men's singles at the BWF World Championships in Huelva, Spain after clinching a decisive victory over Thailand's Kantaphon Wangcharoen on Thursday (Dec 16).</p>
<p>The Singaporean, who is ranked 22nd in the world, notched an impressive victory over the higher ranked Thai 21-4, 21-7 in 30 minutes. Kantaphon is ranked 20th in the world.</p>
<p>Earlier in the tournament, Loh had upset world number one Viktor Axelsen in the first round, before going on to cruise past Austria's Luka Wraber in 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Kantaphon and Loh last met in 2019 at the SEA Games, when Loh beat the 23-year-old in the semi-finals en route to clinching a silver medal. While that match stretched to three games, this one would not.</p>
<p>This is Loh's best showing at the World Championships so far. In the previous edition, he made the last 16 before being knocked out by Chou Tien-Chen.</p>
<p>24-year-old Loh will next face either Dane Rasmus Gemke or India's H.S Prannoy for a spot in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Loh won his <a>first career BWF World Tour Super 500 title</a> at the Hylo Open last month. He also took the Dutch Open crown in October.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why Singapore is still an attractive tourist destination for Indonesians </h1>
<div> <p>Singapore remains a key destination for medical tourism and leisure travel for Indonesians, says ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute’s A’an Suryana.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> A'an Suryana </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: High enthusiasm among Indonesians following the establishment of a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) shows Singapore remains a popular destination for the people of the world’s fourth most populous nation. </p>
<p>The VTL announcement by Singapore Tourism Board (STB) was widely publicised by mainstream media outlets in Jakarta and some other regions in the country, such as Detik, Kompas and Waspada two weeks back. </p>
<p>The excitement around the news indicates high demand among Indonesians to visit Singapore, especially for leisure activities. </p>
<p>Many are making plans to visit Singapore for leisure purposes, including seeing their families and spending time visiting tourist attractions. </p>
<p>Almost 35,000 users were trying to log in when the application portal open, ICA said.</p>
<p>Who are these Indonesians wanting to travel to Singapore? And why does Singapore seem to remain a popular destination for Indonesians, especially when Indonesia has other fascinating holiday options?</p>
<h2>INDONESIANS LOVE THE CITY LIFE</h2>
<p>Indonesia was Singapore’s biggest market in terms of visitor arrivals and tourism receipts in 2014, according to the Singapore Tourism Board’s Marketing Insights research, though that top spot has since gone to China. </p>
<p>“Since Singapore is readily accessible to Indonesia, they visit frequently for short getaways … Singapore can be considered familiar territory for them,” the research highlights. </p>
<p>Singapore was also a top destination for Indonesian travellers before the pandemic.</p>
<p>In 2019, 11.69 million Indonesians travelled out from Indonesia’s numerous airports and seaports, according to a 2019 survey on Indonesian’s outbound travel by Indonesia’s Central Statistics Body (BPS). </p>
<p>Most visited Malaysia (35 per cent), for including medical tourism. Popular destinations include Kuala Lumpur, Selangor, Penang and Melaka. </p>
<p>But Singapore offers a safer and cleaner urban landscape, with strict law enforcement against litter and pollution - something many Indonesian cities are lacking. </p>
<p>With a large variety of accommodation and ease of getting around the island, Indonesian tourists enjoy the comforts of spending time in Singapore. </p>
<p>The cost of a flight is also low when Singapore is a short distance from major cities like Jakarta, Medan and Batam. </p>
<p>Singapore is likely to maintain this niche in the coming years, given little prioritisation by the Indonesian government in developing city tourism in Indonesian cities. Toll roads, seaports, airports and tourism attractions are sorely lacking. </p>
<p>Still, none offer urban escapes. All are focused instead on Indonesia’s historical value and its natural beauty, enabling Singapore to maintain its competitive edge as the eminent urban tourist destination for Indonesians.</p>
<h2>MANY INDONESIANS ARE MEDICAL TOURISTS </h2>
<p>Singapore is a top choice, with Indonesian medical tourists citing confidence in the skills of medical workers, modern healthcare equipment and cultural similarities with Indonesia as top reasons, according to a 2019 EDP Sciences stem publication. </p>
<p>Knowing outbound medical tourism comes at a huge opportunity cost for the Indonesian economy and lost chances to develop its healthcare system, Indonesian authorities have pushed for investments in domestic medical tourism. </p>
<p>A good number of Indonesians are expected to use the VTL for medical reasons, although the vast majority are expected to visit Singapore for leisure and personal reasons, including visiting their family members, according to 2019 data from BPS.</p>
<p>The suspended Singapore-Indonesia Reciprocal Green Lane was supposed to be a stepping stone for more travel links between the two countries. The VTL embodies that desire.</p>
<p>As infection numbers have been brought under control in Indonesia and Singapore, and Southeast Asia reopens, there is optimism to travel again among Indonesians. </p>
<p>But the emergence of the new coronavirus variant Omicron bears watching as it may affect Indonesians’ appetite to travel especially if more restrictions are imposed on the VTL. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Former Malaysian PM Mahathir to be discharged from hospital within days </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Mahathir, who has a history of heart troubles, was <a>admitted to the hospital</a> last Thursday for a full medical checkup and observation. The hospital and spokespeople for Mahathir did not say why he had been admitted.</p>
<p>"The team of doctors treating Dr Mahathir is satisfied with results of the investigations done over the last few days," the institute said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mahathir became the Southeast Asian country's longest-serving prime minister during a 22-year rule from 1981 and 2003.</p>
<p>He then returned for a second stint in 2018 after leading an opposition alliance to a historic election win, making him the world's oldest head of government.</p>
<p>His second administration, however, collapsed in less than two years due to infighting.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: A woman is accused of meeting another person outside Lucky Plaza during the "circuit breaker" period last year for shopping and beer.</p>
<p>When the police approached her, she allegedly used force on them and cursed at them, continuing her violence when taken to Police Cantonment Complex.</p>
<p>At her charging on Dec 6, she said she did not know what to do and would be seeking legal advice.</p>
<p>Ong returned to court on Monday (Dec 27) for a further mention of her case. The court heard that she would be applying for legal assistance under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme.</p>
<p>Ong allegedly met Quirog for shopping and drinking beer, which was not a permitted purpose under the COVID-19 regulations. </p>
<p>About five minutes later, Ong allegedly grabbed a police sergeant's hand outside Lucky Plaza.</p>
<p>She was taken to Police Cantonment Complex that same evening, where she is accused of cursing at police officers. She purportedly said "your mother is a whore" in Tagalog at a female sergeant and tried to punch her.</p>
<p>She tried to kick the same officer, and cursed at a male officer before shouting aggressively and ordering them to release her handcuffs, according to charge sheets.</p>
<p>Ong will return to court in January. </p>
<p>If convicted of breaking a COVID-19 regulation, she could be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both.</p>
<p>For using criminal force on a public servant, she could be jailed up to four years, fined, or both.</p>
<p>For using abusive words against a public servant, she could be jailed for up to a year, fined up to S$5,000, or both.</p>

<div> <div> <a> Kurt Ganapathy </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: A total of 448 confirmed Omicron COVID-19 cases have been detected in Singapore to date, comprising 369 imported cases and 79 local infections, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (Dec 25).</p>
<p>The Health Ministry also announced that a cluster of 10 Omicron COVID-19 cases linked to a bar on River Valley Road has been detected.</p>
<p>The traveller met a colleague, identified as case 281477, on Dec 15 and this colleague subsequently visited The Vinyl Bar at 266 River Valley Road on Dec 17. </p>
<p>“Case 282091 then went on to infect four household members,” MOH said.</p>
<p>All 10 cases linked to the cluster are fully vaccinated and have mild or no symptoms, the Health Ministry said, adding that it is ringfencing the cases through contact tracing.</p>
<p>"Staff and visitors of The Vinyl Bar who are identified to be close contacts of the cases will be placed on quarantine," said MOH. </p>
<p>"As a precautionary measure, other staff and visitors to the bar at the same time as Case 281477 on Dec 17 will be contacted by MOH for a one-time targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test."</p>
<p>All visitors to the bar are advised to monitor their health closely and minimise social interactions as far as possible for 14 days from their date of visit. </p>
<p>"They are encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell," said MOH.</p>
<p>The Vinyl Bar said in response to queries from CNA that it is closed for deep cleaning, disinfection and sanitation, and that all staff will undergo PCR testing.</p>
<p>Singapore is picking up more Omicron cases due to “the rapid spread of the variant across many countries/regions”, said the Health Ministry.</p>
<p>“Given its high transmissibility, it is a matter of time before the Omicron variant spreads in our community,” it added.</p>
<p>“It is important for everyone to continue to play their part and remain vigilant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and to come forward to receive your vaccination or booster dose when offered.”</p>
<p>Singapore confirmed its first two Omicron cases on Dec 6, both imported cases. On Dec 14, it reported its first two confirmed local Omicron cases, both passenger service staff members at Changi Airport.</p>
<p>MOH said on Friday that COVID-19 cases that test positive for the S-gene target failure will be categorised as Omicron cases without additional whole-genome sequencing. </p>
<p>"Based on our local experience, if a person tests positive for (S-gene target failure), it is very likely that it is an Omicron variant," the ministry said.</p>
<p>"This is aligned to the practice in other countries, and does not change our existing public health actions which are already triggered on the basis of detecting (S-gene target failure)."</p>
<p>Due to the change, the number of Omicron cases "will see a one-time substantial increase from the last update", the Health Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Singapore has <a>frozen all new ticket sales</a> for VTL flights and buses until Jan 20, 2022, amid the "rapid spread" of Omicron infections in many countries.</p>
<p>VTL quotas and ticket sales for travel will also be temporarily reduced after Jan 20, 2022, the Health Ministry announced earlier this week.</p>
<p>Singapore has VTLs with more than 20 countries and regions, including Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Omicron may be the final variant of concern </h1>
<div> <p>Scientists have been surprised at how the SARS-CoV-2 virus has behaved so far but viruses cannot improve indefinitely, says an immunology researcher.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Ben Krishna </a> </div> </div>
<p>CAMBRIDGE: It is controversial whether viruses are alive, but – like all living things – they do evolve. This fact has become abundantly clear during the pandemic, as new variants of concern have emerged every few months.</p>
<p>Some of these variants have been better at spreading from person to person, eventually becoming dominant as they out-compete slower versions of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>This improved spreading ability has been ascribed to mutations in the spike protein – the mushroom-shaped projections on the surface of the virus – that allow it to bind more strongly to ACE2 receptors.</p>
<p>ACE2 are receptors on the surface of our cells, such as those that line our airways, that the virus attaches to in order to gain entry and start replicating.</p>
<p>These mutations allowed the alpha variant, and then the delta variant, to become globally dominant. And scientists expect the same thing to happen with Omicron.</p>
<p>The virus cannot, however, improve indefinitely. The laws of biochemistry mean that the virus will eventually evolve a spike protein that binds to ACE2 as strongly as possible.</p>
<p>By that point, the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread between people will not be limited by how well the virus can stick to the outside of cells.</p>
<p>Has Omicron reached this peak?</p>
<p>Besides this, improvements could be made to other aspects of the virus life cycle, such as genome replication, as I mentioned above.</p>
<p>But let’s assume for a second that Omicron is the variant with maximised spreading ability. Perhaps Omicron won’t get any better because it is limited by genetic probability.</p>
<p>Even in a scenario where Omicron is the best variant at spreading between humans, new variants will emerge to handle the human immune system.</p>
<p>After infection with any virus, the immune system adapts by making antibodies that stick to the virus to neutralise it, and killer T-cells that destroy infected cells.</p>
<p>Antibodies are pieces of protein that stick to the specific molecular shape of the virus, and killer T-cells recognise infected cells via molecular shape as well.</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 can therefore evade the immune system by mutating sufficiently that its molecular shape changes beyond the immune system’s recognition.</p>
<p>Herein lies the most probable future for this virus. Even if it behaves like a professional gamer and eventually maxes out all its stats, there is no reason to think that it won’t be controlled and cleared by the immune system.</p>
<p>The mutations that improve its spreading ability do not greatly increase deaths.</p>
<p>Pfizer’s data suggests that T-cells should respond similarly to Omicron as to previous variants, which aligns with the observation that Omicron has a lower fatality rate in South Africa, where most people have immunity.</p>
<p>Importantly for humanity, past exposure still seems to protect against severe disease and death, leaving us with a “compromise” where the virus can replicate and reinfect, but we do not get as severely sick as the first time.</p>
<p>This maxed-out virus would then simply mutate randomly, changing enough over time to become unrecognisable to the immune system’s adapted defences, allowing waves of reinfection.</p>
<p>We might have COVID-19 season each winter in the same way we have flu season now. Influenza viruses can also have a similar pattern of mutation over time, known as “antigenic drift”, leading to reinfections.</p>
<p>Each year’s new flu viruses are not necessarily better than last year’s, just sufficiently different. Perhaps the best evidence for this eventuality for SARS-CoV-2 is that 229E, a coronavirus that causes the common cold, does this already.</p>
<p>Omicron will therefore not be the final variant, but it may be the final variant of concern. If we are lucky, and the course of this pandemic is hard to predict, SARS-CoV-2 will probably become an endemic virus that slowly mutates over time.</p>
<p>The disease might very likely be mild as some past exposure creates immunity that reduces the likelihood of hospitalisation and death.</p>
<p>Most people will get infected the first time as a child, which could occur before or after a vaccine, and subsequent reinfections will barely be noticed.</p>
<p>Only a small group of scientists will track SARS-CoV-2’s genetic changes over time, and the variants of concern will become a thing of the past – at least until the next virus jumps the species barrier.</p>

<div> <div> <a> Ian Cheng </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Children who test positive for COVID-19 will not be separated from their families, said the Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday (Dec 26), in response to a report published by Bloomberg about Singapore's COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>In its response, MOH said that those who test positive for COVID-19 may be isolated in care facilities with another COVID-19 positive patient in order to optimise the use of its overall healthcare capacity.</p>
<p>"However, contrary to what the article said, children will not be separated from their families."</p>
<p>Those aged 12 years and below will stay with a caregiver, while those between the ages of 13 and 19 are allowed to isolate alone only with the written consent of their caregivers. </p>
<p>MOH said that the measures are also temporary in order to give it time to learn more about the Omicron variant, and to adapt and adjust its responses accordingly. </p>
<p>On Saturday, MOH reported a total of 248 new COVID-19 cases, of which 66 were imported. </p>
<p>Singapore has reported 448 confirmed Omicron COVID-19 cases to date, comprising 369 imported cases and 79 local infections, the ministry reported on Saturday.</p>

<div> <div> <a> Lakeisha Leo </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore has done whatever it can to prepare for the next COVID-19 wave, said co-chair of the multi-ministry task force Lawrence Wong on Monday (Dec 27). </p>
<p>In a Facebook post, Mr Wong said it is "inevitable" that Omicron will spread in the community as it has in countries everywhere. </p>
<p>"We must expect a new wave of cases in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>"But we have done whatever we can to prepare for this next wave, and we can weather through it together as one people," he added. </p>
<p>Mr Wong said it has been a month since the Omicron variant emerged, which was <a>first detected by scientists in South Africa</a>.</p>
<p>"Initially we had adopted a more cautious containment approach - this was to buy time to slow down the spread of the variant and learn more about it. </p>
<p>"We now know that the Omicron variant is likely to be more transmissible but less severe than Delta," said Mr Wong, adding that current vaccines and boosters are effective in protecting against severe illnesses caused by the Omicron variant. </p>
<p>Singapore is now adjusting its protocols to manage the Omicron cases the same way as it did for Delta, he said. Omicron cases or close contacts can recover or isolate at home, rather than going to a dedicated facility.</p>
<p>Initially, Omicron cases were isolated in dedicated facilities by default, but they will now be placed on home recovery or treated at community care facilities depending on their clinical presentation. </p>
<p>"We will then prioritise our healthcare resources for the more severe cases, as well as those who are more vulnerable," said Mr Wong. </p>
<p>Mr Wong added that vaccinations and booster shots remain a "key strategy" to defend against Omicron. People who still have not been jabbed were reminded to do so right away. </p>
<p>"Without the vaccine, you will face restrictions on your movement, including not being able to go back to the office. </p>
<p>"These restrictions are necessary to protect you from severe illness due to the virus," he said. </p>
<p>For those who have already received their primary jabs, they were reminded to get their booster shots when the time comes. As for children aged 12 and below, vaccinations are now being rolled out with due dispatch, said Mr Wong. </p>
<p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Sunday said that it expects a new wave of local cases "soon" given the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>"In the coming days and weeks, we should expect more community cases, and rapid doubling of cases. This is again a process we need to go through, in order to live with COVID-19," it added. </p>
<p>Singapore has reported a total of 546 Omicron cases as of Dec 25. This figure comprises 443 imported cases and 103 local cases.</p>

<p>She was referring to an anecdote she had told in Parliament on Aug 3 about accompanying a sexual assault victim to a police station, which she later said was untrue.</p>
<p>Ms Khan shared in Parliament on Nov 1 that she had heard the story from a support group, and had lied because she did not want to reveal publicly that she had been sexually assaulted at 18.</p>
<p>Ms Khan, a former Sengkang GRC Member of Parliament (MP), has <a>since resigned from WP and as an MP</a>.</p>
<p>The Aug 8 message was one of the key points of evidence raised in hearings on Dec 2 and Dec 3 where she was examined by the Committee of Privileges for breaching parliamentary privilege by lying.</p>
<p>Mr Faisal, who is also MP for Aljunied GRC, said that Ms Khan was lying about this, but he could not explain why she would do so.</p>
<h2>FAISAL MANAP, PRITAM SINGH CALLED BEFORE COP</h2>
<p>Ms Khan had also said that, just before another parliamentary sitting in October, Mr Singh had told her that if she "kept to her existing narrative on the untruths which she had said on 3 Aug, there would be no judgement by him".</p>
<p>At that sitting on Oct 4, she told Home Affairs and Law Minister Shanmugam that the anecdote was true, lying a second time in Parliament. She said this was because she had interpreted Mr Singh's words to mean that she should continue lying.</p>
<p>He also said: “Almost immediately after Parliament adjourned in October, Raeesah agreed with the party leadership that she had to set the record right forthwith. I shared with her that it was the correct thing to do."</p>
<p>A day later, the Office of the Clerk of Parliament issued a special report on Dec 3 making public the testimonies of Ms Khan, Ms Loh and Mr Nathan.</p>
<p>The Committee then called Mr Singh, Mr Faisal and Ms Lim to give evidence. Mr Faisal attended a hearing on Thursday, while Mr Singh appeared before the Committee on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>The main points of Mr Faisal's evidence was issued as a special report on Saturday night, along with a video of his hearing.</p>
<p>The report said that Mr Faisal accepted that it was "bad to lie to Parliament".</p>
<p>He also agreed that after he became aware of Ms Khan’s lie, it would have been logical for him to have asked questions about Ms Khan’s intention to clarify the lie, at various points in the events that transpired.</p>
<p>Mr Faisal said that he had left Mr Singh to handle the matter because he trusted Mr Singh, having worked with him for more than 10 years as a fellow Workers' Party MP.</p>
<p>He believed that Mr Singh had the information to make the judgment call on the matter and he also trusted Ms Khan to do the right thing, the report said.</p>

<p>Mr Faisal also revealed that the rest of the WP Central Executive Committee (CEC) did not know that Ms Khan had confessed her lie to him, Ms Lim and Mr Singh much earlier.</p>
<p>This was the case on Nov 2, when a Disciplinary Panel (DP) was formally established by the WP. And when the CEC met on Nov 30 to deliberate the panel's recommendations on actions to be taken against Ms Khan, the other members were still unaware.</p>
<p>The panel - made up of Mr Faisal, Ms Lim and Mr Singh - recommended that Ms Khan should resign or, failing which, she should be expelled from the WP.</p>
<p>When the panel briefed the CEC about its recommendations, it did not disclose to the members that Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal had met Ms Khan on Aug 8, where she confessed to them she had lied to Parliament.</p>
<p>Thus, the CEC voted in favour of Ms Khan’s expulsion "without knowledge of the full facts", said the report.</p>
<p>Mr Faisal also said that he had had discussions with Mr Singh and Ms Lim on Tuesday and Wednesday before his hearing, and they met for about two to three hours on each day.</p>
<p>It was explained to Mr Faisal that a refusal to answer the Committee of Privileges' questions would amount to an offence and constitute a contempt of Parliament.</p>
<p>He was invited to reconsider his refusal to answer the question, but Mr Faisal said that the Committee should place on record that he was refusing to answer that question, and repeated four more times that he would not be answering the question.</p>
<p>Mr Faisal said that Ms Lim and Mr Singh had brought documents to their meetings with him, but he also refused to answer if he knew what those documents were.</p>
<h2>DID NOT RAISE MATTER WITH RAEESAH KHAN</h2>
<p>Mr Faisal said that between Aug 8 and Oct 29, he did not communicate with Ms Khan, Mr Singh or Ms Lim about the untruth Ms Khan told in Parliament, and was unaware of any discussions on this issue among others.</p>
<p>The special report said Mr Faisal was "very sure" that no draft statement or media post had been prepared to clarify Ms Khan’s untruth during the Sep 13 sitting of Parliament, and he did not pursue the issue.</p>
<p>He was not in Parliament on Oct 4, but when he learned that Ms Khan had lied again, he was "shocked and worried".</p>
<p>On Oct 5, Mr Faisal sent a message to Ms Khan to encourage her and tell her to "stay strong" and offer his advice if she needed it. </p>
<p>He told the Committee that since he was in direct communication with Ms Khan, he could have asked her about clarifying the untruth in Parliament, but he did not.</p>
<p>He said that he did not raise the matter with Ms Khan because she neither raised the issue nor sought his guidance on it.</p>
<p>"To his mind, this was a matter for Mr Singh to deal with. The timing of when to have Ms Khan correct the record in Parliament would depend on Mr Singh’s judgment," the report said.</p>
<p>Proceedings were adjourned to Sunday and the Committee of Privileges will also call on Sengkang MP Associate Professor Jamus Lim to give evidence.</p>
<p>It has heard from six people so far over seven meetings.</p>

<p>However, Mr Singh, who is also MP for Aljunied GRC, also did not specifically tell Ms Khan to admit the truth despite having communicated with her on multiple occasions, said the report on Sunday (Dec 12).</p>
<p>Mr Singh also agreed that from Aug 8 to Oct 4, he had not seen any steps taken which would be suggestive of "coming clean".</p>
<p>The report provided a summary of key points from the evidence provided by Mr Singh on Dec 10 to the Committee of Privileges, which is looking into the complaint against Ms Khan for lying in Parliament.</p>
<a>later admitted that she had heard the account in a support group</a>, but had lied because she did not want to publicly admit that she was part of the group and had been sexually assaulted when she was 18 years old.
<p>On questioning by the Committee, Mr Singh agreed that telling a lie in Parliament was a very serious matter, but denied that the police would be adversely impacted by the untruth told by Ms Khan, the report said.</p>
<p>He also said that he did not feel that a wrong had been done to the police by Ms Khan’s allegations.</p>
<h2>"SPEAK TO YOUR PARENTS FIRST" </h2>
<p>Mr Singh's account of an Aug 8 meeting with Ms Khan, WP chair Sylvia Lim and vice chair Faisal Manap, contradicts <a>Ms Khan's testimony to the Committee</a>.</p>
<p>Ms Khan had said in her hearing that Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal had told her that the best thing for her to do would be to "continue with the narrative that she had already given in Parliament on Aug 3".</p>
<p>But Mr Singh said in his testimony that there was no substantive discussion at the Aug 8 meeting at his home on what to do about Ms Khan’s untruth.</p>
<p>As Ms Khan was leaving Mr Singh’s house, he told Ms Khan, “We’ll have to deal with this issue, but speak to your parents first”, the report said.</p>
<p>He had wanted to give her time to speak to her parents, who did not know about the sexual assault, before coming clean in Parliament, said the report.</p>
<p>The report also said that "Mr Singh agreed that it would be fair to say that Ms Khan would have left the 8 Aug meeting not being very clear in her mind about the Party leaders’ instructions on how to deal with her lie".</p>
<p>It was previously reported that Ms Khan had sent a WhatsApp message to two other party members - Ms Loh Pei Ying and Mr Yudhishthra Nathan - after the Aug 8 meeting, claiming that she had been told by WP leaders to take the message "to the grave". </p>
<p>Mr Singh denied in his testimony that he had asked Ms Khan to do this.</p>
<p>When asked why Ms Khan might have lied in her WhatsApp message, Mr Singh said that Ms Khan had told a WP disciplinary panel that she may have "disassociation".</p>
<p>Mr Singh asked the Committee to consider asking Ms Khan to go for a psychological assessment, the report said.</p>
<h2>PRITAM SINGH DID NOT SPECIFICALLY TELL RAEESAH KHAN TO ADMIT TRUTH</h2>
<p>Mr Singh said that after the Aug 8 meeting, he did not check with Ms Khan whether she had spoken with her parents about her sexual assault nor did he have any discussions with Ms Khan about coming clean on the matter.</p>
<p>Ms Khan had shingles and did not attend the next parliamentary sitting on Sep 13. The next conversation they had about this was on Oct 3, a day before Parliament was to sit again. </p>
<p>Mr Singh said that “if the issue came up”, Ms Khan had “to take responsibility and ownership of the issue”, and if she did so, he “will not judge” her.</p>
<p>The report said: "Mr Singh was asked if he had told Ms Khan directly, to tell the truth in Parliament. He said that he did not specifically tell her to speak the truth, in those terms.</p>
<p>"Mr Singh however said that was what he had meant, by the words that he had chosen to use."</p>
<p>He agreed with the Committee that none of the preparatory steps - which were taken in the lead up to a Nov 1 statement where she admitted her lie - were taken before the sitting on Oct 4.</p>
<p>Mr Singh said that this was because he was not sure whether the matter would have come up during that sitting, and if it did not come up, then Ms Khan may not have clarified, the report said.</p>
<p>The report said: "Mr Singh confirmed that he did not specifically tell Ms Khan to clarify the truth on 4 Oct, even if the issue was not raised."</p>
<h2>"WHAT SHOULD I DO, PRITAM?"</h2>
<p>At the Oct 4 sitting, Home Affairs and Law Minister K Shanmugam gave a ministerial statement about Ms Khan’s anecdote, and sought clarification from Ms Khan.</p>
<p>As Mr Shanmugam was making his ministerial statement, Ms Khan sent Mr Singh a message, asking: “What should I do, Pritam?"</p>
<p>Mr Singh did not respond to Ms Khan before she stood up to answer Mr Shanmugam’s questions. Ms Khan then repeated the lie on Oct 4, in response to Mr Shanmugam’s questions.</p>
<p>Mr Singh said that he read Ms Khan’s WhatsApp message to him at 12.45pm, after the exchange between Ms Khan and Mr Shanmugam. Mr Singh told Ms Khan: "Will speak after sitting. Keep Chair and I posted."</p>
<p>Mr Singh met with Ms Khan that same day in his office. The report said Mr Singh remembered that he, Ms Lim and Ms Khan had met late that night, some time past 11pm, for a “very, very short” meeting.</p>
<p>Mr Singh recalled that Ms Khan was in a daze and said: "Perhaps there is another way. That is, to tell the truth." Mr Singh testified that he was very upset and replied: "But look at the choice you made."</p>
<p>Mr Singh said that his takeaway, based on what Ms Khan said at the meeting, was that she was now prepared to tell the truth, according to the report.</p>
<p>Mr Singh testified that he was relieved because that was the first time he had heard her say she wanted to own up to what she had said in Parliament. He said: “Good, we’ll talk about it.”</p>
<h2>CONTRADICTING ACCOUNTS</h2>
<p>On Oct 7, Ms Khan received an email from the police requesting her assistance on her anecdote. She forwarded the email to Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal, and asked for their advice on what to do.</p>
