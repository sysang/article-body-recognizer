<div><h1>Former Biden advisers call for ‘new’ covid strategy</h1></div>
<h2>They suggest an approach based on a ‘new normal of life with covid,’ rather than continuing efforts to eradicate the virus</h2>

<p>Six former health advisers to President Biden’s transition team released a series of journal articles on Thursday calling for a “new normal” in the nation’s approach to fighting the coronavirus and other viral threats.</p>
<div><div>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</div></div>
<p>Rather than continuing in “a perpetual state of emergency,” he and the others argue, the United States must shift to a strategy of seeking to live with the virus by suppressing its peaks, rather than attempting to eliminate it.</p>
<b> </b>comes amid experts’ growing realization that neither vaccinations nor infections appear to confer lasting immunity against the coronavirus. Some also express frustration the White House has squandered opportunities to contain the virus
<div><p>Omicron outbreak inducing whiplash for many Americans</p></div>
<div><p>“Two years into the pandemic, the U.S. is still heavily reliant on data from Israel and the U.K. for assessing the effectiveness and durability of COVID-19 vaccines and rate of vaccine breakthrough infections,” they write.</p></div>
<a>pressed</a> the White House to more aggressively help to vaccinate the world, saying that too little has been done to tamp down the risk of virus variants emerging abroad.
<div><div><p>The Biden administration also has been widely criticized for failing to move faster to acquire and distribute hundreds of millions of rapid coronavirus tests, <a>passing on opportunities</a> last year to do so.</p></div></div>
<p>In interviews, the advisers said that Biden officials faced considerable challenges in trying to both execute a pandemic strategy and plan for the future, adding that their recommendations were meant to complement the administration’s efforts.</p>

<div><div><p>Oscar Lloyd was eating with some friends in a lounge at his college dorm when he got the email: He had tested positive for the coronavirus, and he had two hours to pack and move into isolation housing for 10 days.</p></div></div>

<div><p>UCLA, Yale, Duke among colleges planning to start January with remote instruction as omicron surges</p></div>
<div><div><p>At George Washington University143 residential students were in isolation at its peak in December. Seventy-five of them stayed on campus and the others left to isolate at home during the break.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>School officials are working to expand the amount of quarantine and isolation housing they have available for the spring semester, Goldman said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>For some international students during the pandemic spike, travel home is "almost impossible."</p></div>
<div><div><p>For those students confined to dorm rooms rather than traveling and celebrating the break with family and friends, the abrupt change in the pandemic could not have felt more stark.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The room had yellow walls, a single window, a bed, a set of drawers, and an empty wardrobe without any hangers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It reminded him of a prison cell, and of the Charlotte Perkins Gilman story, “The Yellow Wallpaper,” in which the narrator, confined to a single room, unravels.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s home,” he added lightly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Unlike his dorm room, with an open window onto the busy street, fraternity row and all the usual bustle and cacophony of college and New York City life, this was unnaturally quiet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Every night, for hours, there was a soft cooing noise he couldn’t quite place; owls, maybe?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sometimes, through the walls, he could hear other people coughing and hacking. He himself felt perfectly healthy, making it seem all the more discordant, as though he were trapped in a plague house.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s suddenly gone from doing everything all at once to doing absolutely nothing,” he said. “It’s a sharp shift.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Next up: Soren Kierkegaard’s “Fear and Trembling.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At his home in Alexandria, his brothers FaceTimed him so he could watch them put up their Christmas tree. The family played a virtual trivia game with him. His parents sent him a mini-tree, with batteries to light it up.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They were surprised by his positive test because the school had been so careful, his mother, Helen Lloyd, said. She was glad he had been responsible and been tested, and was helping tokeep others safe.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Colleges around the country are worrying about outbreaks of the coronavirus, leading some to pivot online<b> </b>and cancel events, and others to abruptly change rules on campus in the waning days of the fall semester.</p></div></div>
<a> an updated vaccine targeting omicron is not needed</a>.
<div><div><p>College officials are hoping for answers to some key questions, including how much protection vaccines offer, the severity of the disease with the omicron variant and its transmissibility.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is changing quickly,” said Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at GWU.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Some campuses, including USC, have seen a surge in coronavirus cases after students returned from Thanksgiving travel, a result many anticipated and prepared for with testing and isolation measures for infected individuals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At Cornell, where 97 percent of students are vaccinated,<b> </b>recent days have been startling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As December began, a bump in cases after the holiday seemed to be leveling off, said Peter Frazier, an engineering professor and the lead expert who developed Cornell’s coronavirus response modeling.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But as the semester began to wind down, and as classes ended and students prepared for finals, they continued to see more cases — and preliminary evidence suggested many could be the omicron variant.</p></div></div>
<div><p>On Saturday, school officials canceled student activities and urged vigilance with coronavirus precautions. On Monday evening, they found that a very large fraction of the recent positive tests had the hallmark of omicron, Frazier said.</p></div>

<div><div><p>The number of Americans hospitalized with covid-19 reached more than 126,000 this week — the highest level in a year. But this wave of the pandemic looks different from what came before, with dueling variants on the move.</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Los Angeles, where the fast-spreading omicron variant reigns, roughly two-thirds of covid patients in the county’s public hospitals were initially admitted for other causes, officials said Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at CoxHealth in Springfield, Mo., where officials say the older delta variant remains a ferocious threat, the <a>coronavirus</a> remains the immediate cause for 81 percent of covid hospitalizations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are planning on a pretty scary scenario: volumes increasing and being short-staffed,” said Steve Edwards, the hospital’s CEO, warning that omicron could soon arrive and sicken his workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most hospitalized patients are adults, the number of pediatric covid inpatients has doubled since Christmas to a seven-day average of 3,800 children.</p></div></div>
<a>Minnesota</a> and Wisconsin begging residents to get vaccinated, wear masks and take other precautions to avoid contracting covid.
<div><div><p>“We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before. And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated,” <a>read</a> one ad sponsored by Cleveland-area health systems last month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were coping with our delta surge, and omicron spread like wildfire,” said Keith Armitage, an infectious-disease doctor at University Hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Armitage said there were 486 covid patients in his hospital Wednesday, which he said represented “three buckets” of roughly equal size.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“First … patients admitted primarily due to an illness, covid-19,” Armitage said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that patients are showing up at hospitals with other ailments and injuries only to test positive later for covid is another indicator that omicron causes less serious illness, especially in people who are vaccinated, experts say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Given “how crowded the ER is, and how full the hospital beds are … the short-term concern on the health-care system is highly justified,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A changing picture</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Am I worried about those? Not really,” she said. “It does make me wonder how many incidental cases we had of delta, and I don’t think we were really focused on that back then.”</p></div></div>
<p>As evidence has mounted that many people infected with omicron were initially hospitalized for other reasons, critics have argued that health-care leaders and federal officials have obfuscated why hospitalization numbers have risen in recent weeks.</p>
<div><div><p>More than a dozen hospital leaders who spoke to The Post said much of the scrutiny over why covid patients are being hospitalized is misplaced.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>John Rimmer, CarePoint’s chief medical officer and emergency department director, adding that the virus may have worsened a preexisting medical condition such as asthma or diabetes, leading to patients’ hospitalization.
<div><div><h3><div>‘Finite resources’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The surging number of cases has collided with a separate trend: a worsening hospital <a>staffing crunch</a> that is exhausting workers, fueling rising staff turnover and leading to delays in care.</p></div></div>
<a>permanent workplace safety standards</a> to protect health workers from covid, saying that some staff members have quit because they feel at risk.
<div><div><p>In Vermont, where 52 percent of hospitals reported a critical staffing shortage, the problem stemmed from a “crisis of rural health equity” that predated covid, one researcher said.</p></div></div>
<a>Anne N. Sosin</a>, a health policy researcher at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
<div><div><p>Sosin said Vermont’s hospitals had persistently struggled to recruit specialists and other staff, and she was concerned that workers who quit during the pandemic could not be easily replaced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When we lose health-care workers from our rural region, it’s not clear that we’ll be able to fill those positions again,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But in Rhode Island — which reported the nation’s worst staffing shortage — health workers characterized the shortfalls as unprecedented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never seen this before, in the five years I’ve worked here,” said Brooke Huminski, a clinical social worker at Butler Hospital in Providence, R.I.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s created a problem — now the doctors need to pick up more of the work, which is interfering with patient flow … and of course, raising my own stress levels a bit,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a weird time to be worrying about him and also trying to function,” Huminski said.</p></div></div>

<a>vaccine policies</a> affecting nearly 100 million workers. Most already have made the choice to be vaccinated, but Biden has said the numbers are not good enough.
<div><div><p>One measure requires large private companies to implement a vaccination requirement or impose a masking and weekly testing regimen. The second applies to health-care workers at facilities that receive certain federal funding.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Together, <a>the cases test a signature aspect of the White House’s response to the pandemic</a> that has killed more than 800,000 people in the United States.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s an overview of the cases, the history and the issues that the justices will consider Friday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Can the U.S. government force private companies and health-care facilities to require vaccinations for their workers?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government has never before tried to impose a vaccine-or-test policy on U.S. companies and their workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Employers must provide paid time off to get vaccinated, but they are not required to pay for coronavirus testing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The rules were set to take effect Jan. 4, but OSHA pushed back the date in response to the litigation and said it would not immediately issue citations for those not in compliance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other policy from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services requires vaccinations for more than 17 million health-care workers at 76,000 facilities that receive federal money tied to those programs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Who is challenging the vaccination policies and why?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Any delay, according to the Biden administration, will “cost dozens or even hundreds of lives per day.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The vaccine mandate for health-care workers, opponents say, is “plainly unlawful.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Have workplace safety requirements previously been issued on an emergency basis?</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>OSHA, the federal safety agency, has used its <a>emergency authority infrequently</a> after mixed results in court in the 1970s and ’80s in response to rules to regulate exposure to benzene, asbestos and certain pesticides.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The term “grave danger” is not defined in statute, and courts also have not provided clear guidance about the term.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hasn’t the Supreme Court upheld vaccination requirements for college campuses and those imposed by local officials?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yes, the justices have generally been supportive of vaccination requirements by local governments and universities. For instance, it allowed New York and Maine to mandate vaccinations for their health-care workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the court has also been skeptical when it comes to federal agency power generally, and with respect to the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The justices, for instance, rejected an eviction moratorium — first imposed by the Trump administration and extended by Biden — because it said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had exceeded its authority.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>What have lower courts said about Biden’s policies?</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They are divided.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Soon after the administration announced the rules for private companies in November, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit blocked enforcement of the policy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But lawsuits sprung up around the nation and were consolidated for review by a different court. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit dissolved the 5th Circuit’s stay, saying the rules could go into effect.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Opponents then asked the Supreme Court to intervene.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The lower courts also were divided on the health-care worker mandate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit dismissed a request from Florida to stop the requirement. But a district judge in Missouri stopped the rules, and the 5th Circuit agreed with a challenge from Louisiana.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the Supreme Court, a coalition of Republican-led states said the rules should be blocked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Biden administration said its authority is clear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>What about the Supreme Court’s own coronavirus policies for the justices and court visitors? </b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The courthouse has been closed to the public since March 2020. All nine justices have been vaccinated and received boosters. Justice Amy Coney Barrett had covid before she was confirmed to the high court in September 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After returning to in-person oral arguments this past fall, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh participated in some from home after he tested positive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The justices have not required lawyers arguing cases and credentialed reporters observing the proceedings to be vaccinated. But they must have received negative test results and be masked.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The health-care worker cases are <i>Biden v. Missouri </i>and<i> Becerra v. Louisiana</i>. The OSHA cases are <i>National Federation of Independent Business v. Department of Labor </i>and<i> Ohio v. Department of Labor</i>.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Coronavirus live updates: Read the latest news of the pandemic</p></div>
<div><div><p>Blocking the mandate, the Justice Department said, is likely to “cost dozens or even hundreds of lives per day.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>At the 5th Circuit, the<b/> three-judge panel <b/>that issued the temporary order sai<b/>d the challengers give “cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues” with the mandate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other groups of mostly Republican-led states have joined separate challenges filed in at least four different federal appeals courts based in Georgia, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Study shows unvaccinated Texans 40 times more likely to die of covid than fully vaccinated state residents</p></div>
<div><div><p>The petitions are expected to be consolidated before a single appeals court as soon as next week, when a special judicial panel will randomly designate one appeals court to handle them together.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Justice Department has asked the 5th Circuit to hold off on any further action before the lottery takes place.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Biden administration estimates the rules will save more than 6,500 lives and prevent more than 250,000 hospitalizations over a six-month period.
<div><div><p>David Vladeck, an occupational law expert at Georgetown Law School, said OSHA was well within its power to issue the rules. But how the agency will fare in court is another question.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government has a strong case, Vladeck said, because the point of the specific act it invoked is “to ensure that workers are safe in the workplace.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s going to be controversial because it’s covid,” he said. <b/>“Not because OSHA has somehow overextended its jurisdiction.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Large survey explores factions between Democratic and Republican parties</p></div>
<b/>emergency rules related to benzene, asbestos and certain pesticides. But Vladeck said that
<b/>the vaccinate-or-test standard was on more solid legal ground, based on the unique circumstances of the pandemic that so far has killed more than 750,000 people in the United States.
<div><div><p>In the other emergency cases, “there was no proof of the kind that exists here,” he said. “There is a public health emergency that needs an immediate response.”</p></div></div>
<p>David Michaels, who headed OSHA under President Barack Obama, said opponents of the requirements are portraying them inaccurately, ignoring the option for those who don’t want to get vaccinated to wear masks and get tested regularly.</p>
<div><div><p>Brandon Trosclair, the former political candidate in Louisiana whose businesses also sued the federal government, is quoted on the site as saying the mandate forces workers to get a vaccine or be fired.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They’re trying to pretend that this is a vaccination mandate, to make people angry,” Michaels said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A spokeswoman for the Liberty Justice Center, which represents Trosclair, said: “The federal government is telling businesses to impose vaccines or testing on their employees. That is a mandate.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Death threats, online abuse, police protection: New reality for school board members</p></div>
<a>the Supreme Court has three times refused to stop vaccination requirements:</a> in Indiana, New York and Maine. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a conservative, rejected a request from Indiana University students. Justice Sonia Sotomayor,
<div><p>But the legal questions about the administration’s new rules will center on different questions than those cases. They will involve the scope of OSHA’s regulatory power and whether the rules are consistent with its authority.</p></div>
<p>In some ways, Biden’s policy is more lenient than those imposed by some private companies and states. Many state regulations that apply to health-care workers, for instance, do not give unvaccinated employees the option of frequent testing.</p>
<div><div><p>“Not all of these claims are the same and not all of these mandates are the same,” said Wendy Parmet, a Northeastern University law professor who specializes in public health law.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She noted that for decades, states have required certain vaccines for children to attend school and pointed to the <a>1905 Supreme Court decision</a> upholding state authority to enforce vaccination laws.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the same time, Parmet said, the current Supreme Court majority is “far more skeptical of regulatory power, public health protection and especially when it implicates religious liberty claims.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Here’s what you need to know:</div></h3></div></div>
<p>• Day 1 of E3 delivered little excitement outside of a trio of Ubisoft reveals. Those included a Mario crossover with Nintendo, and a trailer for the studio’s upcoming game based on James Cameron’s film “Avatar.”</p>
<div><div><p>• The first big announcement of E3 2021 was actually about E3 2022, with Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti welcoming the convention back to his city for its usual in-person format next year.</p></div></div>
<div><p>• The premier event on the gaming world calendar, E3 began after video game companies got tired of being overshadowed at the Consumer Electronic Show. Here’s its origin story and a glimpse at where it’s going next.</p></div>

<div><div><p>The number of Americans hospitalized with covid-19 reached more than 126,000 this week — the highest level in a year. But this wave of the pandemic looks different from what came before, with dueling variants on the move.</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Los Angeles, where the fast-spreading omicron variant reigns, roughly two-thirds of covid patients in the county’s public hospitals were initially admitted for other causes, officials said Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at CoxHealth in Springfield, Mo., where officials say the older delta variant remains a ferocious threat, the <a>coronavirus</a> remains the immediate cause for 81 percent of covid hospitalizations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are planning on a pretty scary scenario: volumes increasing and being short-staffed,” said Steve Edwards, the hospital’s CEO, warning that omicron could soon arrive and sicken his workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most hospitalized patients are adults, the number of pediatric covid inpatients has doubled since Christmas to a seven-day average of 3,800 children.</p></div></div>
<a>Minnesota</a> and Wisconsin begging residents to get vaccinated, wear masks and take other precautions to avoid contracting covid.
<div><div><p>“We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before. And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated,” <a>read</a> one ad sponsored by Cleveland-area health systems last month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were coping with our delta surge, and omicron spread like wildfire,” said Keith Armitage, an infectious-disease doctor at University Hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Armitage said there were 486 covid patients in his hospital Wednesday, which he said represented “three buckets” of roughly equal size.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“First … patients admitted primarily due to an illness, covid-19,” Armitage said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that patients are showing up at hospitals with other ailments and injuries only to test positive later for covid is another indicator that omicron causes less serious illness, especially in people who are vaccinated, experts say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Given “how crowded the ER is, and how full the hospital beds are … the short-term concern on the health-care system is highly justified,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A changing picture</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Am I worried about those? Not really,” she said. “It does make me wonder how many incidental cases we had of delta, and I don’t think we were really focused on that back then.”</p></div></div>
<p>As evidence has mounted that many people infected with omicron were initially hospitalized for other reasons, critics have argued that health-care leaders and federal officials have obfuscated why hospitalization numbers have risen in recent weeks.</p>
<div><div><p>More than a dozen hospital leaders who spoke to The Post said much of the scrutiny over why covid patients are being hospitalized is misplaced.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>John Rimmer, CarePoint’s chief medical officer and emergency department director, adding that the virus may have worsened a preexisting medical condition such as asthma or diabetes, leading to patients’ hospitalization.
<div><div><h3><div>‘Finite resources’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The surging number of cases has collided with a separate trend: a worsening hospital <a>staffing crunch</a> that is exhausting workers, fueling rising staff turnover and leading to delays in care.</p></div></div>
<a>permanent workplace safety standards</a> to protect health workers from covid, saying that some staff members have quit because they feel at risk.
<div><div><p>In Vermont, where 52 percent of hospitals reported a critical staffing shortage, the problem stemmed from a “crisis of rural health equity” that predated covid, one researcher said.</p></div></div>
<a>Anne N. Sosin</a>, a health policy researcher at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
<div><div><p>Sosin said Vermont’s hospitals had persistently struggled to recruit specialists and other staff, and she was concerned that workers who quit during the pandemic could not be easily replaced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When we lose health-care workers from our rural region, it’s not clear that we’ll be able to fill those positions again,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But in Rhode Island — which reported the nation’s worst staffing shortage — health workers characterized the shortfalls as unprecedented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never seen this before, in the five years I’ve worked here,” said Brooke Huminski, a clinical social worker at Butler Hospital in Providence, R.I.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s created a problem — now the doctors need to pick up more of the work, which is interfering with patient flow … and of course, raising my own stress levels a bit,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a weird time to be worrying about him and also trying to function,” Huminski said.</p></div></div>
