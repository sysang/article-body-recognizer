<h1> Does the Universe Ask Us to Love? </h1>
<h2> Twenty-five years after Carl Sagan's untimely death, we should heed his message. </h2>
<li>Carl Sagan, a renowned American astronomer, died 25 years ago on Dec. 20, 1996. </li>
<li>A pioneer in the research on extraterrestrial life, Sagan promoted the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project. </li>
<li>A great science communicator, Sagan wrote "Contact" (1985) on humanity's first encounter with aliens. </li>

<a>a man ahead of his time</a>: woke, not least for Wookiees, and combating post-truth before the term was invented.

<p>[All citations are from Carl Sagan's 1985 Contact.]</p>
<p>Sagan wrote this of his protagonist, Eleanor “Ellie” Arroway, and I sensed, firsthand, what he meant: looking at the stars, wondering what’s out there—too <a>shy</a> or dreamy to look closer at those around me.</p>
<p>What made, however, Hitler’s original dream come true—what facilitated his ascent to power? Alienation, I think, is partly the answer, for it is when people are lonely that they become most vulnerable to charlatan abusers of power.</p>
<blockquote> <p>She had studied the universe all her life, but had overlooked its clearest message: For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.</p> </blockquote>
<p>‘Ever been in love?’ The question was direct, matter-of-fact. ‘Halfway, half a dozen times. But’—she glanced at the nearest telescope—‘there was always so much noise, the signal was hard to find.’</p>

<li>Community life and social connectedness is central to our health and wellbeing.</li>
<li>We need efforts to build and rebuild community life post-pandemic.</li>

<h3>Communities and Wellbeing</h3>
<a>Human Flourishing Program</a> at Harvard, we have studied various aspects of communities, communal wellbeing, social participation, and their role in flourishing. We have published on the role of social support in
<a>healthy aging</a>, on the role of
<a>social cohesion</a> in wellbeing, on the effects of
<a>depression</a>, and on the role of
<a>religious communities</a> play in human flourishing, including preventing depression and
<a>suicide</a>, extending longevity, improving marital outcomes, facilitating
<a>forgiveness</a>, and hope. The size of the effects of religious community participation tend to exceed those of other forms of social participation. With regard to effects on
<a>cardiovascular disease</a>, the effects of religious service participation are larger than for any other social participation indicator examined, including
<a>marriage</a>, time spent with friends or family, hours spent in other community groups, or even their composite.
<a>commentary</a> in the American Journal of Epidemiology, while the implications of the research need to be approached carefully, there are indeed important implications for public health.
<h3>Social Connectedness and Belonging</h3>
<a>loneliness</a>, and rebuild communities. We hope that this new initiative will strengthen our work on this important topic further, and offer some small contribution towards enhancing and encouraging community life.
<h3>Re-Establishing and Strengthening Communities</h3>
<a>Bowling Alone</a>. Peering forward towards the year ahead, with COVID infection rates on the rise yet again in many places, can be daunting. But whether it is now, or in six months, or sometime later, there is rebuilding to do.

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Is Seeking Power in Your Relationship Good or Bad?</a></h2> <p>Couples often struggle for power in their relationship. Shared power is possible, but what enables a couple to create it?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Some Narcissists Inflict Great Harm, But Others Don't. Why?</a></h2>
<p>Malignant narcissists can hurt you at work or harm you in a relationship. But you may be able to ignore benign narcissists, who just aren't tuned in to the outside world.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Can "Playing Around" Boost Your Romantic Life?</a></h2> <p>Recent research suggests that moments of joy and fun between partners have lasting benefits, for the relationship and for partners' well-being. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>The Future of Diversity in America</a></h2> <p>Some embrace an increasingly diverse America. Others oppose it, or fear it's changing what is truly American. Recent research shows what diversity's impact on people really is.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Must Life Go Downhill As You Age, Or Do You Have a Choice?</a></h2> <p>New research shows that it's possible to become the person you would like to be as you age. But how? Here are some ways you can make that happen.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a> New Pathways to Mental Health: What the Pandemic Reveals</a></h2>
<p>The experiences and challenges during the pandemic have a benefit, oddly. They reveal what is needed for mental health in the transformed world of The After Times.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How to Increase Relationship Intimacy in Stressful Times</a></h2> <p>Is working and living at home draining your romantic connection? You're not alone. But a few steps can help restore some of it.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Becoming More Empathic May Change Your Political Views</a></h2> <p>When people become more empathic towards others, research finds that their moral framework and political ideology becomes more liberal.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Relationship Secret of the Happiest Couples</a></h2> <p>Couples that maintain long-term happiness have one major thing in common. A new study finds that it's not similar personal traits. It's something else.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Do You Need a Partner to Have a Happy Life?</a></h2> <p>Many people believe they need a partner to feel happy. But new studies show that creating a happy life is more complex.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <h2><a>How Physical Affection and Emotional Exposure Affect Couples</a></h2> <p>Keeping a positive connection can be hard in the best of times. These two important aspects of a relationship, if overlooked, can shake its foundation.</p> </div>
<div> <h2><a>How Are Mindfulness, Stress, and Your Well-Being Connected?</a></h2> <p>You may not know how being "in the moment" relates to solving life challenges, or to your long-term well-being as you become older. New research explores how.</p> </div>

<h2><a>A Hidden Link Between Your Life Purpose and Physical Health</a></h2>
<p>Is finding a purpose and meaning to your life important? Can it affect your health, your well-being, or your cognitive functions? What do we know about how all these link together?</p>
<div> <h2><a>What Makes an Open Relationship a Healthy One?</a></h2> <p>Can an open relationship be as healthy as a monogamous one? If so, what do couples do that promotes it? And are they different from healthy monogamous relationships?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Can Simply Having "Hope" Reduce Your Suffering From Anxiety?</a></h2> <p>Does "hope" play any role in alleviating and healing the suffering of anxiety? Some new research indicates it can.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Not Ready to Commit? Don't, Or You'll Doom Your Relationship</a></h2>
<p>What leads to relationship success is a mystery to many. But one factor emerges when people reflect on what they truly felt about their relationship, at the beginning.</p>
<h2><a>What's the One Thing the Happiest Couples Do Differently? </a></h2>
<p>Couples argue about many things. That's part of any relationship. But there may be something about how they argue, and what they focus on, that's common to the happiest couples. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why Your Work and Career Can Continue to Debilitate You</a></h2> <p>Surveys continue to show the damaging impact of many workplaces and careers upon emotional and physical health.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Are You Drawn to the Same "Type" of Partner, Over and Over?</a></h2>
<p>Have you discovered that you're drawn to the same kind of partner over and over—though determined that "this time, with this person, it's definitely different"? What can help?</p>

<h1> Three Stories of Loss, And How Each Person Healed </h1>
<h2> Each kind of personal loss requires a different path for healthy acceptance. </h2>
<div> <h3>Key points</h3> <ul> <li>Sudden loss can arouse dormant inner strengths.</li> <li>Lifelong loss can trigger wanting to "pay it forward."</li> <li>Loss of a critical life experience can generate a new sense of purpose.</li> </ul> </div>
<p>Three different kinds of loss are especially painful during this stretch of holiday cheer. And each involves a different path of healing.</p>
<h3>Janet: Sudden loss arouses new personal strengths</h3>
<a>shy</a>, around people she didn’t know. Instead, she enjoyed cooking, finding new recipes for her and her husband to try, and staying in touch with some
<a>childhood</a> friends who were scattered around the country.
<a>grief</a> but of helplessness and
<a>fear</a> about what comes next. The sudden loss also affected her physically, she lost interest in eating and maintaining her health.
<a>depression</a>, and isolation and knew how
<a>damaging it can be to mental health</a>
<a>. </a>She told me, “I have nowhere to go but forward. I’ve got to move one day at a time. One day at a time,” she repeated.
<h3>Ted: Lifelong loss stirs giving to others</h3>
<a>gratitude</a> for all that he’s thankful for in his life. He now finds it meaningful and fulfilling to “pay it forward.”
<h3>Susan: Loss of a critical life experience leads to new meaning and purpose</h3>
<a>divorced</a>, with two small boys that he and his ex-wife were raising. The couple fell in love and married. Susan is white, from a Jewish background and a native of New York, where her parents sacrificed to ensure that she would have a quality
<a>writing about the damage that US Immigration policies inflict </a>upon so many people who seek to unify or reunify their families.

<h1> Children's Mental Health and the Pandemic </h1>
<h2> We have all changed because of the pandemic. Our children are no exception. </h2>
<li>Children living through the pandemic are experiencing mental health disturbances at high levels.</li>
<li>Traditional forms of intervention, namely individual therapy sessions, may not be appropriate for every young client.</li>
<li>Parental and school involvement is critical in addressing the crisis of children's mental health head-on.</li>
<li>For children struggling to stay connected in online sessions, family therapy can be a valuable alternative.</li>
<p>In my practice, I have seen a number of things with my child clients:</p>
<a>suicidal</a>. Some experience an uptick of eating disorders, borne of the isolation and increased desperation to control something—anything—within their environment.
<h3>Addressing the problems</h3>
<p>The reports keep coming: kids in crisis, colleagues swamped with more referrals than they can manage, and school counselors seeing more and more distressed children in their offices. What can be done?</p>
<a>therapy</a> would have been my go-to answer—but nowadays, seeing children therapeutically online can only be one piece of the puzzle. Most of my adult patients do well with
<a>bored</a>, they might simply wander off, turn off their camera, or just end the call. Others struggle focusing or responding to questions and are too disengaged to interact meaningfully.
