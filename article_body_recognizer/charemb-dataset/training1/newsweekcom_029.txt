<p>One notable person that weighed in on the verdict was Virginia Giuffre, who sued Maxwell in 2015 and has spoken publicly of her experience being trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell. She has since become well known for her anti-trafficking activism.</p>
<p>In a statement, Giuffre said that "my soul yearned for justice for years and today the jury gave me just that. I will remember this day always."</p>
<a>above the age of consent</a> in New York at the time of the alleged abuse.
<p>With Maxwell's sentencing on the horizon, Newsweek spoke to legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Gene Rossi about the facts of the trial.</p>
<p>Despite two dozen witnesses coming forward to corroborate the five additional charges, the prosecution was unable to prove a link between the lone witness testimony connected with the charge of traveling across state lines.</p>
<p>Even with the missed conviction on count two, though, Rossi added that "five out of six [convictions] is always good for the government," and that the feds were still able to prove Maxwell's guilt in the vast majority of the indictment.</p>
<p>As the trial went on, one of the defense's key tactics was to try to separate Maxwell from the man that she had become indelibly associated with, with defense attorneys repeatedly telling the jury that "Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein."</p>
<p>Now that she has been convicted, Rossi also stated that it was unlikely that the feds would offer her a plea bargain for a shorter sentence, saying that it was her choice to go to trial, and she can't extend a hand because she lost.</p>
<p>Rossi summed up the basic viewpoint of federal prosecutors: "If you roll the dice and lose, don't call us," noting that convicts in federal court are rarely ever given the "luxury" of a deal.</p>
<p>Beyond those who have already weighed in, many other parties also had reported ties with Maxwell and Epstein. This includes connections with a number of politicians, including former President <a>Donald Trump</a>.</p>

<div> Opinion <a>January 6</a> Capitol Riots Donald Trump <a>Democrats</a></div>
<p>Will Jan. 6 be our next new national holiday? Perhaps it won't go so far as that. But there's been a campaign to make next week's anniversary of the Capitol riot the most important date on the calendar.</p>
<a>Democrats</a> are now seeking to inflate the events of that day out of all proportion to what actually happened in order to distract the country from their own disastrous conduct since assuming control of the White House and both Houses of
<a>the Confederates firing on Fort Sumter</a> and even
<a>the 9/11 attacks</a>. Indeed,
<a>in the view of some</a>, recalcitrant Trumpists of all sorts amount to "domestic terrorism."
<p>Many now tell the story of Jan. 6 with the same reckless determination that for years characterized the ultimately debunked claims that Trump colluded with Russia to steal the 2016 election.</p>
<a>Republicans</a> in Congress or even
<a>Fox News</a> Channel personalities.
<a>Senate</a> scurrying for safety. That discredited the otherwise peaceable Trump rally—as did the former president's slowness to condemn the riot.
<p>Yet as awful as that was, it wasn't an attempted coup d'etat. After a year of investigations, not a shred of proof has been produced to the contrary.</p>
<p>The BLM riots are a useful analogy because, only months earlier, the same people who have embraced the insurrection myth shrugged their shoulders or rationalized away far more violence when it was done on behalf of a cause they liked.</p>

<p>Representative Madison Cawthorn has criticized a "conspiracy theory" that his soon-to-be ex-wife is part of a Russian plot following the resurfacing of a video where he discussed how the two met.</p>
<p>That video led to some social media users to speculate about the possibility that Cristina Bayardelle Cawthorn was part of a Russian "honeypot" operation or that Cawthorn himself is a Russian agent. There is no evidence to support these claims.</p>
<p>A honeypot is the term for an intelligence operation often involving a woman engaging in a romantic relationship with a target in order to compromise them. It has often been a feature of spy fiction.</p>
<p>Cawthorn, a Republican who represents North Carolina's 11th congressional district, took to <a>Twitter</a> on Monday and appeared to laugh off the conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>"Left-wing losers still bitter over their debunked Russia Hoax are spreading lies about me," Cawthorn wrote.</p>
<p>"They <a>love to slam 'conspiracy theories.'</a> They are the true conspiracy theorists," he added.</p>
<a>Democrats</a> Grant Stern and Fred Wellman—questioning the story of how he met his wife, including the congressman's claim about the man in St. Petersburg. He also shared screenshots of tweets from those same people criticizing
<a>Republicans</a> for supporting conspiracy theories.
<p>"Amazing," Cawthorn wrote, adding a laughing cry emoji. "These people are unwell."</p>
<p>Stern had shared the video of Cawthorn discussing how he met his wife, and wrote: "Madison Cawthorn's divorce just went from boring information <a>to national security concern</a> in about 77 seconds of interview time with the Daily Caller."</p>
<p>"This does not sound a normal meet-cute story whatsoever. Very few of these stories involving Russia are," Stern said.</p>
<p>Retweeting Stern, Wellman had written: "OK. Wait. He met an American Army Captain from Miami in a St. Petersburg, Russia casino? Why would a U.S. Army officer be in a Russian casino? I have questions."</p>
<p>Stern and Wellman were not the only social media users raising questions about how Cawthorn met his wife and if there could be potential Russian government involvement.</p>
<a>he some nefarious Russian penetration</a>? Almost certainly not. Is there something more here? Almost certainly yes."
<p>Cawthorn announced on December 22 that he and his wife would divorce after less than nine months of marriage. The video from 2020 gained renewed attention online following that announcement.</p>
<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>NATO Allies Want German Pivot on Russia's Nord Stream 2 Pipeline</h1><div> By David Brennan <time>On 12/2/21 at 4:01 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> World Germany <a>Russia</a> <a>NATO</a></div>
<p>Several of Germany's NATO allies are urging the incoming coalition government to re-evaluate the controversial Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline.</p>
<p>Nord Stream 2 will deliver Russian natural gas directly to Germany, which supporters claim will be vital to easing energy shortages currently wracking Europe.</p>
<p>But according to critics, the approximately $10.75 billion project will also seriously undermine <a>European Union</a> and NATO security, handing Moscow a potent new weapon in its ongoing struggle with the West and further isolating Ukraine.</p>
<p>Latvia's Foreign Ministry told Newsweek that a change in German posture could be on the cards. "It is clear that changes might be expected in comparison to the previous course of <a>Angela Merkel</a>," the ministry said.</p>
<p>"Regarding Nord Stream 2, Latvia has considered this a <a>political project</a> since the beginning and will definitely continue to seek closer dialogue also with the new German government on issues related to Russia, Nord Stream 2, and Ukraine."</p>
<p>Merkel, the outgoing German chancellor, has long supported the two Nord Stream pipelines, the second of which was completed in September and is currently under review by German regulators and expected to begin operations some time in 2022.</p>
<a>Vladimir Putin</a> will be able to hold the continent hostage if the new pipeline is allowed to go ahead.
<a>cut Ukraine out</a> of its natural gas supply routes, making Russian military action against its neighbor far less costly. Ukrainian leaders have framed the completion of Nord Stream 2 as an existential threat to their national security.
<p>Russia has repeatedly dismissed concerns it will weaponize the pipeline to win concessions from Europe, or that it will use Nord Stream 2 to isolate Ukraine. In June, <a>Putin said</a> Nord Stream 2 is a "purely economic, commercial project."</p>
<p><a>Skeptics warned</a> the deal will mean little to Moscow, and criticized President <a>Joe Biden</a> for dropping the longstanding, bipartisan U.S. opposition to the project.</p>
<p>The Biden administration said it came to power too late to stop the pipeline, but has continued its public criticism of the project and applied new sanctions on involved entities.</p>
<p>Last month, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov dismissed the latest measures as "politically motivated, unilateral restrictions, which are introduced for everything: with or without a reason."</p>
<a>Democratic Party</a>'s Olaf Scholz as chancellor. Scholz has previously warned that Nord Stream 2 could be cut off "just like that" if Putin abuses the pipeline.
<p>Fellow Greens co-leader Robert Habeck—nominated to lead a new climate and economy super ministry—has previously said he would "doubt" that Nord Stream 2 will adhere to all European rules, and thus would likely not be approved by regulators.</p>
<p>The pro-business Free <a>Democrats</a> are the third portion of the coalition. Party leader Christian Lindner called for a moratorium on Nord Stream 2 in January over Russian human rights abuses against political dissidents.</p>
<p>Germany's new leading figures are clearly skeptical of Russia's motives. The coalition agreement published last month made no explicit reference to the newest pipeline.</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted the SDP, Greens and FDP to request clarity on the coalition's Nord Stream 2 strategy.</p>
<p>British-Ukrainian journalist Bohdan Nahaylo wrote for the Atlantic Council in November that the incoming government "is biding its time and is remaining tactfully reticent on the subject."</p>
<p>"And I still think—this will have to be argued by lawyers and decided by judges—but I still think Nord Stream 2 is not up to the standards of European energy legislation."</p>
<p>The pipeline, he told German news agency DPA, "is becoming a tool to blackmail Ukraine and Moldova. It is also a tool for the manipulation of energy prices."</p>
<p>British Foreign Minister Liz Truss, meanwhile, wrote in The Sunday Telegraph: "Nord Stream 2 risks undermining European security by allowing Russia to tighten its grip on those nations who rely on it for gas."</p>
<p>NATO's Baltic states have been particularly opposed to Nord Stream 2, which all have described as a political project designed to grant Putin more leverage over his European adversaries.</p>
<a>Russian forces mass</a> on the eastern Ukrainian border. The
<a>EU</a>'s Eastern European nations have been at the forefront of the bloc's support for Ukraine, and those who spoke to Newsweek urged a renewed German focus on the issue.
<p>The German coalition agreement published last month demanded "an immediate end to the attempts at destabilization against Ukraine, the violence in eastern Ukraine, and the illegal annexation of Crimea."</p>
<p>"Germany continues to be a very close partner of Estonia. Russia, Ukraine and Nord Stream 2 are and will be in the agenda both in our bilateral relations and at the EU," the Estonian spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The Lithuanian Foreign Ministry described Nord Stream 2 as a "geopolitical project" that "seeks to create divisions among EU member states.</p>
<p>"Nord Stream 2 is not about diversification of gas supply sources, but rather about deepening energy dependence of the European Union on Russia," the ministry said.</p>
<p>"We welcome the aim of the future government of Germany to deepen energy partnership with Ukraine," the ministry said. "It is important that actions are taken to ensure that energy is not used as a weapon."</p>
<div> News Coronavirus <a>New Orleans</a></div>
<p>A Norwegian Cruise Line ship that recently had a COVID-19 outbreak is back on the sea, bringing aboard new passengers after its docking Sunday, the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>The ship's previous cruise contained 17 people infected with the coronavirus: eight passengers and nine crew members, according to a Louisiana Department of Health spokeswoman on Monday.</p>
<p>Many were worried about the small outbreak as the cruise ship, the Breakaway, had recently made stops in Mexico, Honduras and Belize before its return.</p>
<p>The cruise line welcomed new passengers to the ship on Sunday, making sure they had no COVID-19 symptoms and were fully vaccinated. The ship also had safety protocols in place.</p>
<p>"Guests who opt to sail must wear masks while indoors except while actively eating or drinking and will be tested twice during the cruise," a statement from the cruise line said.</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.</p>
<p>The Breakaway can carry up to 3,963 passengers. Its Caribbean route from New Orleans includes Cozumel and Costa Maya in Mexico; Roatán, in the Bay Islands of Honduras; and Harvest Caye, Belize.</p>
<p>An earlier statement from Norwegian Cruise Line said that any passengers who tested positive would either drive themselves home or "self-isolate in accommodations provided by the company."</p>
<p>Some people who left the ship on Sunday told WVUE-TV that they had been told that people on board had tested positive for COVID-19, but others said they hadn't.</p>
<p>Don Canole of North Carolina said he got first word from overhearing the station's interview with someone nearby. "It would have been nice to have known. We would have taken maybe a few more precautions," he said.</p>
<p>Passengers said they were tested for COVID-19 exposure on Saturday. The cruise line also gave passengers take-home rapid tests as they left the ship, according to WVUE.</p>
<p>New York City schools are taking steps to ensure they do not have to shut down as coronavirus cases continue to spike in the city.</p>
<p>"Two clear messages we're sending loud and clear," Adams said. "Your children are safer in school. The numbers speak for themselves. And we are united to make sure they continue to be safe."</p>
<p>De Blasio urged parents to get all eligible children vaccinated against COVID-19, but vaccines are not mandated for city students, as they are for teachers and other municipal employees.</p>
<p>Coronavirus cases have surged in New York City thanks to the emergence of the Omicron variant. Health officials reported about 22,000 new cases of the virus a day in the week that ended Sunday, up from 3,400 a day in the week that ended December 12.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>A couple from Maryland charged with trying to sell information about nuclear-powered warships to a foreign country was indicted following their arrest earlier this month, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).</p>
<p>Jonathan, 42, and Diane Toebbe, 45, of Annapolis, each faces a single count of conspiracy to communicate restrictive data and two counts of communication of restricted data.</p>
<a>FBI</a> and the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) and charged with violating the Atomic Energy Act—a federal law that assures the proper management of nuclear materials and their byproducts.
<p>His wife, Diana Toebbe, joined him several times to preplanned "dead-drop" locations, prosecutors said. At the sites, Jonathan would allegedly leave behind memory cards containing sensitive information.</p>
<p>According to the DOJ, the Toebbe's sold information to the individual for at least one year.</p>
<p>On April 1, 2020, Jonathan sent a package to someone he believed was a foreign government containing a sample of secret information along with instructions for establishing a covert relationship, the affidavit said.</p>
<p>The undercover FBI agent then sent $10,000 in cryptocurrency to Jonathan as a payment of "good faith" on June 8.</p>
<p>More than two weeks later, the couple traveled to West Virginia. Diana allegedly acted as a lookout while Jonathan placed an SD card hidden inside a peanut butter sandwich at the designated drop location.</p>
<p>Almost one month later, on August 28, Jonathan completed another "dead drop" this time placing an SD card in a pack of chewing gum in Virginia. The agent paid $70,000 in cryptocurrency for the information.</p>
<p>The couple was arrested after another drop-off in West Virginia, according to the DOJ.</p>
