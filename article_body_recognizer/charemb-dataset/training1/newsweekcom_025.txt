<p>Stafford said Republicans who drew the new map "cherry-picked" which statewide elections' results they used to determine "competitiveness," and that that line of argument was flawed.</p>
<p>The plan in dispute sprinted through the Ohio Statehouse last month and passed without Democratic support. It was signed days later by Republican Governor <a>Mike DeWine</a>, whose son, Pat, is one of four GOP justices on the seven-member court.</p>
<p>Because the map got no backing from Democrats, it will hold for just four years, rather than the typical 10.</p>
<p>Both lawsuits target DeWine and the other members of the powerful Ohio Redistricting Commission, rather than the Legislature.</p>

<p>The Connecticut Supreme Court denied a motion Republican lawmakers filed against the court's appointment of Stanford law professor Nathanial Persily to help redraw Connecticut's congressional district lines.</p>
<p>The court-appointed Persily after members of the state legislature's Reapportionment Commission couldn't agree on how to redraw the districts in accordance with population changes.</p>
<p>In the motion, the lawmakers suggested Persily would be "partial to abiding by his prior work," implying the possibility he would engage in gerrymandering.</p>
<p>In the court's decision, it said the lawmakers' request "borders on frivolous," adding that it "rejected in the strongest possible terms" the implication that Persily's appointment had anything to do with partisanship.</p>
<a>Senate</a> President Martin Looney as someone the
<a>Democrats</a> would recommend to the court. Ultimately, the Democrats did not submit any names.
<p>The Democrats, who submitted a brief on Monday opposing the Republicans' request, said Looney's comments about Persily in a news article was not the same as formally submitting his name for consideration.</p>

<div> U.S. Joe Biden <a>Economy</a></div>
<p>With just one interview with Fox News, West Virginia Senator <a>Joe Manchin</a> dealt President <a>Joe Biden</a>'s agenda a serious blow, leaving <a>Democrats</a> scrambling to figure out a way forward with voters ahead of the 2022 elections.</p>
<p>Democrats know the urgency is real.</p>
<a>Republicans</a> and Trump, they wanted competent leadership that was capable of passing the sort of bills that would help Americans get through a pandemic and an economic downturn."
<p>One strategy supported by progressive leadership is for Biden to use executive powers to bypass <a>Congress</a> and enact his agenda.</p>
<p>Veteran Democratic strategist Simon Rosenberg wrote in October that division among Democrats would make November 2021 more difficult, and he also foresaw trouble in Virginia ahead of <a>Terry McAuliffe</a>'s embarrassing loss that month.</p>
<p>As he did then, he told Newsweek now that the chief concerns for the Biden administration and for vulnerable Democrats over the next 11 months are the coronavirus response and the economy.</p>
<a>NBC</a> News. "The American people support the Build Back Better economic growth plan for the middle class because it will cut the biggest costs families face and fight inflation for the long haul."
<p>"They also support his mobilization against COVID-19, despite an unprecedented misinformation effort against vaccines and partisan obstruction that aids the virus," the spokesman added. "He's fighting to deliver on both."</p>
<p>Democrats have done far more than Republicans to make the pandemic better for working-class Americans, he said, but voters don't know it or feel it.</p>
<p>But beyond calibrating midterm messaging just right after Build Back Better was dealt a serious blow, Democrats say it must also include a meaningful contrast to Republican obstructionism, including on pandemic response.</p>
<p>"Democrats have to start hitting Republicans," he said. "They're the reason this is going on."</p>
<p>"Omicron was able to come on strong because they're still telling people not to wear masks or vaccinate," Ramos added.</p>
<p>Democrats have taken note, for example, that polls have shown voters of both parties are tired of the pandemic, which is why they say Republican governors like DeSantis and Abbott have to start telling people to get vaccinated and wear masks.</p>
<p>But they also note that messaging against Democrats was successful in 2020 because there was so much money spent on it.</p>
<p>"They spent a billion dollars saying we're socialist extremists," Ramos said. "At some point we have to hit them and call them extremists who are the ones hurting the economy."</p>
<p>In her op-ed, Jayapal made clear what is at stake for Democrats.</p>

<p>Nevada will bump Iowa and New Hampshire from being the first U.S. states to hold presidential primaries thanks to a law signed by Nevada's Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak on Friday.</p>
<p>So far, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) has been silent on whether it would support giving Nevada the lead spot.</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press see below.</p>
<p>Signing the law is a gamble.</p>
<p>The DNC isn't expected to start writing rules for its nominating process until next year.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> performed poorly in Iowa's caucuses and New Hampshire's primary. In Nevada, with a much more racially diverse population that mirrors the U.S. as a whole, he finished second.
<p>That gave Biden momentum heading into South Carolina's primary, which then catapulted him to a string of Super Tuesday victories.</p>
<a>Democrats</a> nationally started shifting away from caucuses to primaries before 2020, citing the difficulty of attending an in-person meeting and the fiddly math involved to determine who wins the most delegates.
<p>The law will require the presidential primary to be held on the first Tuesday in February in a presidential election year.</p>
<p>Frierson's comments came Friday at a bill signing ceremony in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>He said he's confident Nevada can make its case and persuade both national parties to let it go first. He said those conversations have already started and will continue, but he did not offer more details.</p>
<p>Biden has a huge influence on the process as head of the party, but it's not clear where he stands on shaking up the calendar. White House press secretary <a>Jen Psaki</a> declined this week to comment on the order of presidential primary contests.</p>
<p>"Those candidates on both sides — Democrats and Republicans — have not fared well when they get into the general elections," Clyburn said.</p>
<div> U.S. <a>Steve Bannon</a></div>
<p>Jared Schmeck—the man who said, "Let's go Brandon" to President <a>Joe Biden</a> during a Christmas Eve phone call—has said he's considering running for political office, adding, "God put me in this position for a reason."</p>
<p>Schmeck made his comment during an interview with conservative Christian broadcaster Todd Starnes. Starnes asked him if he had any plans to run for office.</p>
<p>"I want to pray about it, see what God has for me," Schmeck replied. "At the end of the day, I want His will for my life and the direction that it goes."</p>
<p>"I do feel like God put me in this position for a reason," he continued. "And I strongly believe that standing up is the right thing to do here as long as that message that I'm portraying is glorifying His name. And yeah, I'll see where it goes."</p>
<p>Schmeck gained notoriety on Christmas Eve when he called President Biden and the first lady as part of the North American Aerospace Defense Command's (NORAD) Santa-tracker broadcast.</p>
<p>Schmeck concluded his call by stating, "Let's go Brandon," a euphemism for "F*** Joe Biden."</p>
<p>Biden replied, <a>"Let's go Brandon. I agree," </a>as the first lady lightly laughed.</p>
<p>While Schmeck said he "stood 100 percent" behind what he said, he also said he felt "no animosity" towards Biden.</p>
<p>"It was merely just an innocent jest to also express my God-given right to express my frustrations in a joking manner," Schmeck said. "I love him just like I love any other brother or sister."</p>
<p>Early into his notoriety, Schmeck insisted that he's "<a>not a Trumper</a>," meaning an avid supporter of Republican former President <a>Donald Trump</a>. However, <a>he quickly backpedaled that claim</a>.</p>
<p>Wearing Trump's trademark "Make America Great Again" hat, Schmeck spoke on Monday on former Trump adviser <a>Steve Bannon</a>'s War Room Pandemic podcast.</p>
<p>"Donald Trump is my president and he should still be president right now," Schmeck told Bannon. "The election was 100 percent stolen. I just want to make that clear."</p>
<p>Schmeck told Bannon, "'Let's go Brandon' is more than just 'F Joe Biden.' 'Let's go Brandon' encompasses the entirety of our frustration with Joe Biden, the administration, the leftist mob, the cancel culture, the mainstream media."</p>
<div> U.S. Harry Reid <a>Las vegas</a> <a>Chuck Schumer</a></div>
<p>On Dec. 15, Las Vegas' McCarran Airport officially changed its name to Harry Reid International Airport. It had been named after Nevada's Senator Patrick McCarran for 73 years.</p>
<p>The Clark County Commission voted unanimously in February to rename the airport after reports of McCarran's "history of perpetuating racism, xenophobia and antisemitism," the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>"I worked hard during my years in <a>Congress</a> to help build and grow the airport, and it is a source of tremendous pride to me," Reid said in a Dec. 14 statement on the airport's renaming.</p>
<p>Reid also said that he took great pride in the fact that private donations, not taxpayer dollars, financed the airport's rebranding.</p>
<p>Reid was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 and served there until 2017. He served as Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015.</p>
<a>Barack Obama</a> despite Republican opposition to the healthcare overhaul. He also helped orchestrate the repeal of the military's ban on lesbian, gay and bisexual soldiers known as "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."
<p>Consequentially, Reid helped change Senate rules on judicial nominees in 2013 to allow their approval with a simple majority vote.</p>
<a>Republicans</a> later benefited from the rule change to quickly approve judicial and
<a>Supreme Court</a> nominees during the presidency of
<p>"Jill and I send our love and prayers to Landra [Reid's surviving wife] and the entire Reid family," Biden's message concluded. "May God bless Harry Reid, a dear friend and a giant of our history."</p>
<p>In commemoration of Reid, Obama shared a message that he had recently sent to the former senator.</p>
<p>"The world is better because of what you've done," the letter concluded. "Not bad for a skinny poor kid from Searchlight," the small Nevada town where Reid grew up in poverty.</p>
<a>Chuck Schumer</a> wrote, "Harry Reid was one of the most amazing individuals I have ever met. He was tough-as-nails strong, but caring and compassionate, and always went out of his way quietly to help people who needed help.
<p>"He was a boxer who came from humble origins, but he never forgot where he came from, and used those boxing instincts to fearlessly fight those who were hurting the poor and middle class," Schumer's statement continued.</p>
<p>"He was my leader, my mentor, one of my dearest friends, he's gone, but he will walk by the sides of many of us in the Senate every single day," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>On May 14, 2018, Reid underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer at the Johns Hopkins Cancer Center in Baltimore, Maryland. On Feb. 25, 2019, he announced that his cancer was in remission.</p>

<div> News Schools <a>Coronavirus</a> <a>Learning</a></div>
<p>Some states are limiting the amount of time that schools can offer remote learning, forcing schools hit by COVID-19 to make up time lost by students not being in the classroom.</p>
<p>Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, said restrictions on virtual learning are short-sighted, and that some states limiting remote instruction have no mask or vaccine requirements.</p>
<p>"It is just crazy because this is a pandemic still, and as much as we had all hoped that it would be over, Delta has made clear that it is not over," she said.</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.</p>
<p>Within his first week back at school after a year and a half, 7-year-old Ben Medlin was exposed to a classmate with COVID-19, and he was sent home, along with 7,000 other students in the district, for 14 days of quarantine.</p>
<p>Not much learning went on in Ben's home.</p>
<p>On some days last week, the second-grader was given no work by his teachers. On others, he was done by 9:30 a.m., his daily assignments consisting of solving 10 math problems or punctuating four sentences, according to his mother.</p>
<p>"It was very much just thrown together and very, very, very easy work," Kenan Medlin said.</p>
<p>As coronavirus outbreaks driven by the Delta variant lead districts around the U.S. to abruptly shut down or send large numbers of children into quarantine at home, some students are getting minimal schooling.</p>
<p>Despite billions of dollars in federal money at their disposal to prepare for new outbreaks and develop contingency plans, some governors, education departments and local school boards have been caught flat-footed.</p>
<p>Also, some school systems have been handcuffed by state laws or policies aimed at keeping students in classrooms and strongly discouraging or restricting a return to remote learning.</p>
<p>The disruptions—and the risk that youngsters will fall further behind academically—have been unsettling for parents and educators alike.</p>
<p>Districts in Kansas risk losing funding if they offer online or hybrid learning for more than 40 hours per student per year.</p>
<p>The U.S. Education Department said Tuesday that states and school districts should have policies to ensure continued access to "high-quality and rigorous learning" in the event COVID-19 cases keep students from attending school.</p>
<p>The Illinois State Board of Education recently passed a resolution forcing districts to make remote instruction available to quarantined students.</p>
<p>In the meantime, parents are left with some difficult decisions to make.</p>
<p>Medlin on Thursday pulled her two children out of school and plans to home-school them as she did last year.</p>
<p>Emily Goss, another Union County parent, said she likewise is planning to home-school her 5-year-old kindergartener after he was put under quarantine six days into the school year with no remote learning option in place.</p>

<p>An open-ended exam question has divided the internet with some hailing it as "genius" while others branded it "massively unfair."</p>
<p>It was first highlighted by evolutionary scientist Rebekah L. Rogers, who took to <a>Twitter</a> to share a snapshot of the question with her followers.</p>
<p>"I kind of like this exam question," she wrote alongside the image.</p>
<p>The question reads: "There's something you spent time studying that wasn't on the exam. What is it and how does it work? Explain in detail."</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Rogers' post has been retweeted over 11,000 times, earning more than 110,000 likes in the process.</p>
<p>Plenty were impressed with the format of the question.</p>
<p>Dr. Jason Holliday, a professor at Virginia Tech, branded the question "genius." "I'd like to also allow for this in seminars/talks," they added.</p>
<a>Canada</a>, was also in favor of the approach. "I've had students write great questions (that I use on future exams), and sometimes answer their own question wrong," she said.
<p>King's College London Organic Chemist Andre Cobb was not convinced though, calling it "too open ended and non-transparent to be a fair question."</p>
<p>"How would you grade this between different boundaries? How much should someone write?" he asked.</p>
<p>Software developer Kyle Lambert was also unsure, commenting: "As someone whose academic success hinged on good memory and predictable test structure rather than studying and prep, I think this would have made me panic a little bit."</p>
<p>Johana Sarahi countered his criticism though, suggesting that, if anything, the question was an attempt to create "balanced testing for all."</p>
<p>"There're always things that Never show up on tests and are hard studied," she said. "Wouldn't this type of question then benefit people who don't 'succeed' off of memorization, who also get stomach sick because of tests with said structures?"</p>
<p>Sarah Grynpas, meanwhile, was vehemently opposed to the concept. "They're sneaky personality tests," she wrote. "A way for strangers to judge you based on their own weird biases. They're massively unfair."</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted Rogers for comment.</p>
<p>The viral post comes as part of an ongoing debate around the benefits of <a>standardized testing</a> in educational settings.</p>
<p>The UC Davis Admissions Office told KCRA applicants will now be evaluated on GPA, extracurriculars, coursework and their responses to three randomly generated essay questions.</p>
<p>The question comes to light several years after <a>a baffling math conundrum on a Chinese exam paper went viral</a>.</p>
<p>Another exam question left people stumped—<a>despite it featuring on a second grade exam paper.</a></p>
<p>With<a> a passing rate of 56 percent for first-time takers</a> from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2021 (per the NMLS), preparing for the NMLS exam might seem like a daunting task. Don't worry. <a>OnCourse Learning</a> has you covered.</p>

<p>What's the most important advice you would give someone just starting out in their career to help them achieve a successful and fulfilling professional lifestyle?</p>
<p>You discuss the importance of patience in your book, how success doesn't come overnight. What intermediate milestones might offer motivation along the way?</p>
<p>What leadership techniques and goals should be employed by people in non-management positions?</p>
<p>"Crazy-busy" has become something of a point of pride for some people, yet you talk about how it can be detrimental to long-term success. How should you let coworkers know you're being productive while using your time better?</p>
<p>You keep pretty busy yourself. This is your fourth book. You host a weekly interview series (with Newsweek), Better, as well as teach at Duke and speak widely. What's next on the horizon for you professionally?</p>
<p>One of the projects that I talk about in The Long Game—my own 20 percent time—is learning to write musical theater. In 2016, I created a 10-year goal to write a show that made it onto Broadway by the 2026 season. So I'm working on that! :)</p>

<div> Business <a>Career Advice</a> Book Excerpt</div>
<p>Leveraging for Your Relationships</p>
<p>Phillip Van Nostrand is a high-end photographer in New York City, earning thousands to shoot weddings or events. But for years, he accepted a $500-a-day assignment to cover a "random JavaScript tech conference in San Francisco."</p>
<p>Why? He's originally from Santa Barbara, and the conference paid for his cross-country flight. "I could spend a week with my family, and it felt like a free trip home for a half-day's work," he says.</p>
<p>When we're clear about our true priorities, it's a lot easier to optimize accordingly.</p>
<p>Leveraging for the Life You Want</p>
<p>Another powerful way to frame your choices is to understand your ideal lifestyle. Where, and how, do you want to live? And what would it look like for you to stand up for that vision?</p>
<p>Through his flexibility and creativity, Phil has created a lifestyle—replete with high-end fashion and dining—that otherwise wouldn't have been available to him. But it's possible when you decide to leverage for the life you want.</p>
<p>Leveraging for Your Professional Goals</p>
<p>What if we didn't think about "work" and "life" as quite so separate? What if we could find ways to combine them that actually enhanced both?</p>
<p>Christina isn't the only professional who's found creative ways to blend travel and professional development. Phil the photographer has, too.</p>
<p>"What I had dreamed of when I started taking pictures, was that someone would fly me somewhere. I wouldn't have to pay for anything, and I would get to travel for free. And that was it."</p>
<p>So one year, she invited Phil to join them, and he's now traveled with her twice to Venice, once to Paris and Versailles and once to "the South of France during lavender season."</p>
<p>Not everyone would think it's such a great deal. "If you talk to any old-school photographers, [they'd say] I should be getting paid for my time in Venice," he says.</p>
<a>Instagram</a> following, isn't wealthy. "Squeezing money out of [her and her friends], it wouldn't be satisfying for anybody," he says. "They wouldn't have a budget for me, anyway. And to get a free vacation is priceless."
<p>You have to be willing to wait. You have to be willing to delay gratification. And when you do, you're able to make choices that—in the long run—set you up for far more success than others who took the expedient route.</p>

<p>Many people choose their dream career based on what they are passionate about, others on what will give them the most job security. But for others, it's the paycheck that makes a job appealing.</p>
<p>Jobs in health and medicine are the highest paying jobs in the U.S., and the top 25 highest paying jobs pay more than $100,000; twice the U.S. median income of $46,124 a year (as per the Bureau of Labor Statistics).</p>
<p>However, they take a lot of stress and work to get those qualifications.</p>
<p>Here are the 25 careers that pay the most in the States by mean average salary, according to the <a>US News and World Report</a>.</p>
<h2>Anesthesiologist $265,990</h2>
<p>An anesthesiologist evaluates, monitors and supervises patients before, during, and after surgery and delivers anesthesia. They work long hours and have an unpredictable schedule owing to emergency surgeries and childbirth.</p>
<p>Those pursuing this career will need to spend four years at medical school, before completing at least a four-year residency in anesthesiology.</p>
<p>After completing medical school, a residency and specialist training, it's no surprise that surgeons are rewarded with high wages.</p>
<p>Depending on their specialty, surgeons can work long and unpredictable hours, even overnight shifts, if they work in trauma or similar fields.</p>
<h2>Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon $242,740</h2>
<p>Oral and maxillofacial surgeons treat injuries and defects in and around the mouth and jaw, from tumours and cysts to wisdom teeth issues.</p>
<p>A lot of training goes into qualification, including an undergraduate degree, medical school and a residency.</p>
<h2>Obstetrician and Gynecologist $235,240</h2>
<p>OB-GYNs have a very stressful job, considering they are involved in a very stressful time in a parent's life: pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
<p>They deal with vaginal, ovarian, uterine, and cervical reproductive health and childbirth, and must pass a licensure exam after medical school and a residency before they begin to practice.</p>
<p>Anyone who had braces as a teenager will have been referred on from their dentist to an orthodontist, who likely went to dental school after college and completed a residency.</p>
<p>Orthodontists perform X-rays, apply braces and create mouth guards to provide corrective measures for their patients' teeth.</p>
<p>Psychiatrists are qualified doctors, who complete medical school and a residency program after their undergraduate degree in college.</p>
<p>Those who qualify go on to treat mental health issues in a variety of specialties, from children and teenagers, to addiction issues and forensic psychiatry.</p>
<p>Family medicine physicians diagnose, treat, and help prevent commonly occurring diseases and injuries. If you have an ailment, you'll likely visit your physician.</p>
<p>However, the title physician also encompasses allergists, cardiologists, dermatologists and oncologists, among others.</p>
<p>Training involves college, completing medical school and a residency program that requires doctors to spend a number of months in each training area before applying for board certification.</p>
<h2>Prosthodontist $196,960</h2>
<p>A rarer career than dentistry or becoming an orthodontist, prosthodontists fix damaged or missing teeth artificial devices like dental implants, dentures, bridges, crowns and veneers.</p>
<p>Those hoping to become a prosthodontist must complete college, dental school and a residency program, before applying for certification from the American Board of Prosthodontics.</p>
<p>These physicians specifically treat children, and perform check-ups, administer immunizations and treat common ailments.</p>
<p>Qualification involves medical school, a residency program and licensing exams, and of course good bedside manner and empathy to deal with younger patients.</p>
<p>Many of us hate going to the dentist, but those who do the job are among the highest earning people in the States.</p>
<p>After graduating from dental school, dentists will deal with teeth issues and check-ups for patients, including administering X-rays and extracting teeth.</p>
<h2>Nurse anesthetist $169,450</h2>
<p>The path to becoming a nurse anesthetist requires less time, money and training than the path to become an anesthesiologist, but there's still a lot of work involved.</p>
<p>Nurse anesthetists—who administer anesthesia and provide care before, during and after procedures—must graduate with a master's degree from an accredited program, and complete a year of experience as a registered nurse.</p>
<h2>Petroleum Engineer $154,780</h2>
<p>Petroleum engineers develop methods to pull oil and gas from below the <a>Earth's</a> surface and design new ways to extract fossil fuels from wells, by analysing geographical data and performing cost-benefit analysis for different projects.</p>
<p>Drilling engineers, completion engineers and reservoir engineers all fall under this bracket.</p>
<p>Those who excelled in math and science at school best suit this job, with those in the field usually having an undergraduate degree and a master's.</p>
<p>An IT manager manages the network and server infrastructure of a company, and those in big companies can be rewarded with big paychecks.</p>
<p>To get into this field, a degree in Information Technology, Computer Science or a related field is followed by a few years experience, building up to a managerial role.</p>
<p>Podiatrists treat issues with the feet and lower legs, dealing with everything from bunions and ingrown toenails to high arches and injuries.</p>
