<a>depression</a> but can also cause it, it’s crucial to be
<a>mindful</a> of our engagement. Too often, we use this kind of platform to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking or to share our accomplishments without recognition of how they might land with others. In this time of increased
<a>stress</a> and anxiety, the external
<a>locus of control</a> encouraged and fed by social media can be particularly harmful.
<p>Return to Your Body and Breath.</p>
<p>When we feel <a>bored</a>, we too often reach for our screens to entertain and distract us. Right now, this can cause harm. Find some ways to bank and use at least some of your idle moments away from your screens and in your creative mind and body.</p>
<a>cans</a> and some string to make tin can stilts, or cut out both ends of a can and dip it in bubble liquid (homemade) and blow bubbles. If you don’t have paint, grab paper and some cold tea and fingerpaint with that.
<p>We are all creative; many of us have simply forgotten how to access this part of ourselves. Remind yourself by daring to look silly and feel awkward. This will save us all.</p>
<p>Determine what is and is not working.</p>
<p>Adjust Your Expectations.</p>
<p>Together, we will get through this time of physical distancing and will return to our thriving selves. To do so, we must tend to our own mental health. We must be gentle with ourselves because we cannot serve anyone out of an empty cup.</p>

<p>We’ve reached the point in quarantine where we are all weary. This is a marathon, not a sprint, and our nerves are becoming frayed, the unknown is taking its toll, and none of us are at our best.</p>
<a>masturbation</a>. Pleasurable self-touch, however, is not limited to this, can be both
<a>attention</a> to the feeling of our skin on our skin.
<p>If you are sheltering with someone in need of skin to skin touch, talk about how you can offer this in ways that don’t cost you more than you can afford. Many times a solid hug or gentle handhold can go a long way.</p>
<p>*Do not use a weighted blanket if you have sleep apnea, other sleep disorders, or respiratory difficulties.</p>

<a>social isolation</a>. These findings are particularly informative today.
<p>Agitation. Agitation refers to a state of nervous “excitement” or <a>anxiety</a>. When agitated, we feel keyed up and on edge, possibly hyper-vigilant, looking for reasons to be worried or fixes for our anxiety. To relieve agitation:</p>
<a>feelings</a> that you’re experiencing. Look for themes. Process with someone. Burn the list of losses, using this as a ceremony of sorts for letting go.
<a>mindful</a> walks, baths/showers, and listening to calming music are places to start.
<a>Box breathing</a> and grounding (stand on the ground, rock back and forth to find center, then imagine deep roots growing from your feet, delivering grounding and nutrients up and into your body) are both helpful for relieving agitation.
<li>Tend to your body. Do some aerobic exercise. Use foam rollers or tennis balls to perform self-massage/acupressure. Practice <a>diaphragmatic breathing</a>. Get outside.</li>
<p><a>Depression</a>/Fluctuation in Mood. It’s normal to feel “blue” when faced with a completely disorienting reality. Owning, normalizing, and working through these feelings can keep them from turning into full-blown depression.</p>
<li>Exercise. A combination of aerobic exercise along with stretching is particularly helpful.</li>
<li>Meditate. <a>Mindfulness meditation</a> has been proven to help with mood. <a>Find a meditation that you like</a>, practice it online a few times, then try it on your own. Regular practice will enhance effectiveness.</li>
<li>Try <a>Therapy</a>. Therapists everywhere are using <a>telehealth</a>. If you feel a sense of real struggle, don’t wait to seek help.</li>

<h1> Parenting Teens in the Summer of COVID-19 </h1>
<h2> The pandemic is hard on adolescents. Here are a few tips that can help. </h2>
<p>Being a middle or high schooler is hard. So is being the parent of one. These truths are especially glaring during a summer of mask-wearing, physical distancing, missed social opportunities, and a future that is entirely unknown.</p>
<a>creative thinking</a> in this
<a>stressful</a> time, considering mental health needs as an important part of the COVID decision making matrix.
<p>How might we help our adolescents thrive in this difficult summer? Here are some ideas.</p>
<p>1. Do an assessment of each family member’s psychological, physiological, and relational needs.</p>
<a>appetite</a>? Are they getting exercise and fresh air?), and “Relational” (Is this person getting enough social connection? Do they have people they are talking with directly or is all contact done via social media and texting?)
<p>Make notes in each cell of your chart, noting the places where each family member may need some changes or interventions. Brainstorm ways of addressing concerns then initiate non-judgmental conversations about how you might offer help and support.</p>
<p>2. Help teens identify their feelings with <a>emotional regulation</a> (not <a>denial</a> or <a>repression</a>) as the goal.</p>
<a>boredom</a>, and more are normal. For teens who deal with
<a>social anxiety</a>, relief may be a common feeling right now given reduced social pressure. Any or all of these can be confusing and overwhelming.
<p>Not naming or acknowledging feelings doesn’t mean they don’t exist, it simply means they are being denied. In periods of prolonged distress and unknown, this pattern can have particularly harmful effects.</p>
<p>3. Watch for, and talk about, <a>depression</a>, <a>anxiety</a>, and <a>suicide</a> risks.</p>
<a>mental health and suicide hotlines increasing</a> recently (by 116% in some locations), it’s important that parents know the specifics around youth mental health. For thorough and easy to digest tips, start
<a>here</a>. In general, however, ask questions, listen well, avoid problem solving and, instead, work with your child to find the best help.
<p>4. Make individualized self-soothing plans.</p>
<p>The ground rules for making these lists must include a no teasing clause. More than ever, families must find ways of honoring the unique needs of each member without any belittling or <a>bullying</a>.</p>
<p>5. Fill your home and yard with “edgy” embodied offerings and encourage healthy technology use.</p>
<p>6. Allow for some, although minimal, social risks. Establish a clear and consistent decision-making model for social gatherings.</p>
<p>Ventilation/Size of Space + Number of People + Masks + Shared objects + Stamina to comply</p>
<p>7. Trust (and verify). Expect mistakes.</p>
<p>8. Do unique things together.</p>

<a>fivefold increase in calls</a>.
<p>Here are some tips for doing just that:</p>
<p>Be intentional about choices and <a>attention</a>. Presently, it’s easy to be overly aware of the things we cannot do. To thrive, however, we must direct our attention to the choices that are open to us.</p>
<a>feeling word chart</a> and posting it in your home or on your home screen. Refer to it often, identifying the feelings that come up for you in a day.
<a>emotional regulation</a> can all help here.
<p>Have a solid (and diverse) self-soothing plan. If we hope to name and work through our feelings, we must also have ways of comforting ourselves. Making a list of 20 actions that are uniquely soothing can go a long way.</p>
<a>stress</a>. Stress is toxic and is plentiful when we feel out of control. There is such a thing as optimal stress, which helps us stay engaged and motivated and drives us to perform.
<a>Burnout</a>, fatigue, and hopelessness, however, can result when stress is too intense or prolonged.
<a>meditation</a> and/or breathing practice,
<a>psychotherapy</a>, consistent recreational connection to friends, exercise, and fresh air/nature.

<h2> Small tweaks for big relief in stressful times. </h2>

<p>Americans are living in a time of prolonged distress with no known end in sight. The pandemic, racial awakening, contentious election season, and an increase in weather and fire-related emergencies are a lot to face.</p>
<a>cynicism</a>, emotional depletion, and lack of
<a>Creativity</a>, problem-solving, and working
<a>memory</a> are often impacted, meaning cognitive function and acuity is reduced when we are
<a>burned out</a>. Further, when we lack control over the stressors we face and/or perceive that there is little reward for getting through them, we are at greater risk for burnout and its accompanying symptoms.
<a>anxious</a> and depressed and lack access to many of the spaces and activities that typically help us regulate ourselves emotionally. We feel little volitional control over our abilities to move about in the world and we see no clear end in sight.
<p>While the following suggestions are certainly not cures for burnout, they are small tweaks that can help mitigate some of our internal distress in these uncertain times.</p>
<a>depression</a> and anxiety and news coverage amplifies our feelings of being out of control.
<a>Even ten minutes of screen-free time</a> every hour can make a huge difference to our mental health.
<a>education</a>, vocation, and entertainment has only intensified this, overstimulating our visual and auditory senses and under stimulating the rest. Even still, tending to our senses is one of the best ways to usher in self-soothing.

<a>stress</a> and enjoying community. Add to this natural disasters (hurricanes and fires), a toxic political climate, and a 24-hour news cycle, and “unprecedented" seems far too weak a word to describe the state of affairs in our country.
<p>For anyone who has a history of <a>trauma</a> or has experienced a failure of justice (e.g. <a>bullying</a> where the bully never faces consequences for their behavior), these days are nearly impossible.</p>

<p>The next five weeks don’t promise much reprieve and it will benefit all of us to have a plan for times when our trauma response is piqued. To that end, here are five actions to help us cope.</p>
<a>anxiety</a>-producing at first, the long term benefit will be huge. Find new ways of waking up and falling asleep. Ways that encourage calm and groundedness. Sleep stories or quiet music can be helpful, as can paper books or magazines.

<a>attention</a>, wrestle with information critically, or tolerate stillness, we lose the actual abilities to do so at both neurological and behavioral levels.
<a>capacity to experience hope</a> and inspiration even in difficult times.
<a>dopamine</a> we get when offered an enticing headline or social media ping.
<a>emotional regulation</a>. Having only the app we are working in open on our screen will likely increase our proficiency and sense of calm. Similarly, using only one device at a time helps us mitigate the overwhelm that our central
<a>nervous system</a> experiences by digital overstimulation. This means that we are benefited when we leave our phone in another room when we watch a movie or work on our laptops.
<a>Lonely</a>, or Tired can help us stop habitual behaviors (like scrolling) that actually prevent us from getting what we truly need and actually direct us to resolve what we are lacking.
<a>making a plan to address them</a>, then directing our attention to other experiences and feelings that are just as real yet less painful.

<h1> How and Why to Take a Break From the News </h1>
<h2> The world is "on fire" and so are our central nervous systems. Breaks help. </h2>

<a>massive toll on our collective and individual well being</a>.
<p>In order to care for ourselves well, we would benefit from considering our media intake and making a plan for taking breaks throughout this week. Here are some ideas to that end:</p>
<a>traumatic</a> could occur at any moment puts us and our bodies on high alert and in fight, flight, freeze, or faint mode.
<a>a sense of emotional balance</a>. If we feel we must access the news, making a commitment to identify our emotional state, and taking at least one action to address it before doing so can help.
<p>If we are already <a>anxious</a> or feeling distressed, taking three or four deep breaths and naming at least one thing we are <a>grateful</a> for before tuning in would go a long way toward approaching the news from a place of grounding.</p>
<p>Similarly, as we step away from checking current events, asking ourselves if there are big feelings we need to address (or exhale away to be addressed later) can help.</p>
<a>stress</a> us. The reality is, however, that
<a>social media use</a> is not only correlated with a higher incidence of anxiety and
<a>nervous system</a> which is on high alert during times of cultural distress.

<h1> 'Restarting' Our Tech Use Post-Pandemic </h1>
<h2> Quarantine fed our tech dependency. Now what? </h2>
<li>We are more dependent than ever on our devices, which impacts our ability to focus and stay emotionally regulated.</li>
<li>During the course of quarantine, our devices "saved" us and now it's time to reconsider our use.</li>
<li>The habits we established over the course of the pandemic may not serve us as we emerge into in-person life.</li>
<li>Small steps can help us break our habits and realign our technology use with our values.</li>
<p>Here are a few ideas for how to begin this process.</p>
<a>shame</a> around the amount of time we spend with our devices. As much as possible, consider your relationship with technology without judgment. Simply notice how much time you spend with it and where you go when interacting with it. Pay
<a>this one</a>, identify your top five values. Work hard to identify those that are closest to your heart and mind in terms of ideals that guide the trajectory of your life in thought, heart, and deed.
<a>authenticity</a> congruent with your social media use? Does texting only as a form of communication actually enhance your commitment to
<a>friendship</a>? Does your use of Google search and/or media sources truly contribute to your valuing of
<a>anxiety</a>-provoking post-pandemic “do-over” is the perfect opportunity for contemplation and deep thought about what has served us as well and for letting go of what has not. Let’s get to work.

<h1> In-Person Life Is Exhausting: Post-Pandemic Socializing </h1>
<h2> Re-entering a post-pandemic world is hard. Here are some tips for the journey. </h2>
<li>Returning to in-person interaction is difficult at the behavioral, emotional, and neurological level.</li>
<li>We must take stock of our exhaustion level as we re-enter the community.</li>
<li>Making a plan for how to tend to our mental and physical health while we re-engage socially is important.</li>

<a>attention</a> elsewhere, diminishing our proficiencies. In many ways, we’ve under-stimulated the embodied, interpersonal parts of our brains, leaving us bereft as we re-join the community.
<p>1. Be honest about the energy level with which you are moving out of quarantine.</p>
<p>4. Prioritize “recovery” time.</p>
<p>5. Talk with others about the process.</p>

<h2> Tools for navigating the new CDC guidelines regarding mask-wearing. </h2>
<li>Social contracts express the general will of a group, reflect their interests, and provide a basis for community behavior.</li>
<li>Social contracting regarding mask-wearing is impacted by the new CDC guidelines, leading to heightened tensions.</li>
<li>Being honest about choices, leading with empathy, and tending to personal trauma can help with navigating this time.</li>

<a>empathic</a> regarding more than your own experience of the pandemic will help to inform your choices and make you a better neighbor.

<h1> From Zoom Fatigue to Room Fatigue </h1>
<h2> How and why re-entering the real world after COVID feels exhausting. </h2>
<li>Migrating communication to Zoom/video platforms was exhausting and yet we adjusted.</li>
<li>Moving more conversations to in-person settings will involve awkward moments and will be tiring.</li>
<li>Strategies to help with transitioning back to an in-person world include planning ahead and keeping a sense of humor.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Mentadgt/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>decision-making</a> to a minimum and privilege relative ease in daily living.
<li>Plan ahead. This means having some conversation starters ready because even the most loquacious us might find it challenging to slip back into the flow and rhythms of real-world conversation.</li>
<li>Take it slow. Be intentional about the pace at which we re-enter social situations because we are likely to be overwhelmed more quickly than we were pre-pandemic.</li>
<li>Keep a <a>sense of humor</a>. Most of us will feel at least some awkwardness with making eye contact and starting or joining conversations. Keeping it light-hearted can reduce <a>anxiety</a> and signal <a>empathy</a> to each other.</li>
<li>Cultivate a “beginner’s mind.” This is a concept borrowed from Buddhism, and it means adopting a non-judgmental and curious attitude toward what is happening around us.</li>
