<h1> The Laws of Unintended Consequences </h1>
<h2> Study these to make better decisions and feel better about the decision you make </h2>
<p> Posted December 21, 2016 </p>
<p>Innocent evil is therefore, moral philosophy’s hardest problem. People with the moral intentions yielding immoral consequences.</p>
<a>collaboration</a> with bio-philosopher, neuro-scientist and anthropologist Terrence Deacon.Causes, reasons, and motivations
<li>Nothing has just one cause. Causes fan out backward indefinitely in time.</li>
<li>You can’t know everything about what motivates others. Don’t say with <a>confidence</a>, “I know why you did it.”</li>
<li>You don’t even really know everything about what motivates yourself. Don’t even say with confidence, “I know why I did it.”</li>
<li>Reasons and causes are never singular. Don’t seek the cause, reason or motive. Seek the causes, reasons or motives.</li>
<li>Nothing has just one consequence. Consequences fan out in all directions over time. Life is like playing piano with oven mitts on. You go to hit one key and others get hit in the process.</li>
<li>Over when the fat lady sings? The fat lady never sings or, if she does you’re not going to hear it. You won’t know when consequences are all played out.</li>
<li>What you interpret to be insignificant may prove significant. Small differences can make big differences.</li>
<li>What you interpret to be significant may prove insignificant. Big differences can make small differences.</li>
<li>All decisions are bets that could fail. No matter how confident you are about a bet, be still more confident that it is a bet.</li>
<li>There are upsides and downsides to any choice you make, ways it could go right and ways it could go wrong. When we ignore ways that things could go wrong, the chances of unintended consequences go way up.</li>
<li>There are two ways to be wrong about any choice. Saying yes when the right answer turns out to be no and saying no when the right answer turns out to be yes. To minimize unintended consequences, consider both before choosing.</li>
<li>Nobody is perfect, and everyone makes mistakes, but not because we’re not smart enough. The world is inherently unpredictable and all the more so due to the difference between cause and effect phenomena and means to ends interpretation.</li>
<li>You can regret a choice but don’t assume that if you had made a different choice, you would have no regrets. Try saying, "I wish I had done that, which isn't to say that if I had, I wouldn't wish that I hadn't."</li>
<li>A goal is not a plan. “My plan is to succeed” isn’t a plan.</li>
<li>Demand is not supply. That you really need something may motivate you to find ways to get it, but there’s no guarantee you will find ways. Don’t say “I’m going to beat the stock market because I really need to.”</li>
<li>Distinguish two questions: What you would do if you were in charge of the world vs. what can you do given the world you’re not in charge of? Ignore the first question because you’re not in charge of the world.</li>
<li>We are all some-nicient and some-nipotent. We have some knowledge and some <a>wisdom</a>. We will spend our lives guessing which knowledge and power we have and don’t have.</li>

<h1> How Affective Forecasting Can Influence Your Future Self </h1>
<h2> How can people empathize with a version of themselves that doesn't exist yet? </h2>
<li>People tend to be poor at affective forecasting, the ability to predict how they'll feel about a future event.</li>
<li>Research suggests that people conceptualize their future self as a completely different person, not an older version of themselves.</li>
<li>People can make better financial decisions by empathizing with their future self.</li>
<p>On May 11th, 2011 a group of research subjects was given a simple choice: Do you want $5 now, or $500 on May 22nd, 2011?</p>
<p>With less than two weeks to wait, the answer seems simple: Hold off and get the $500. Easy money, right? However, the research subjects overwhelmingly chose the $5. </p>
<p>How can we connect more deeply, and thus become more invested, in the <a>happiness</a> of our future self? </p>
<h3>Affective Forecasting and the Psychology of the Future Self</h3>

<h3>How Social Cognition Influences Decision Making</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Research indicates that seeing ourselves as an older person can help us make better financial decisions</div> <div>Source: Photo by BBH Singapore via UnSplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>These results suggest that this visual simulation can help bridge the gap between present and future selves, leading us to be much more invested in the latter. This influences our <a>consumer psychology</a> in various ways.</p>
<h3>Final Thoughts on Affective Forecasting and The Future Self</h3>
<a>empathizing with future others</a> paves the way to being invested in the maintenance of civilization.
<p>As we’ve seen, the two are intertwined. Believing the entire world is going to end in a few weeks isn’t exactly a recipe for long-term planning. Connecting with the future, while still in the present, is key. </p>
<p>Simple <a>visualization</a> practices seem to be remarkably helpful in bridging this gap. </p>
<p>FaceApp may not be able to extinguish apocalyptic beliefs among doomsday preppers, but it might be a start. At the very least, if our doomsday preppers would have just visualized themselves past May 22nd they may be a few hundred bucks richer.</p>

<h1> Why Counting on Your Dreams to Come True May Not Be Worth It </h1>
<h2> The paradox of "if only" thinking. </h2>
<p> Posted September 24, 2014 </p>

<h1> The #1 Misconception about Success </h1>
<h2> How to Avoid this Common Trap </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Denise Jones/Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Consider the following statements:</p>
<p>“I won’t be happy until I get that job promotion” or “Making more money will make me happy” or “When I meet someone, I will finally be happy.”</p>
<p>I often hear such statements. They are predictions about how one will feel in the future. This is known as <a>affective forecasting</a>. </p>
<p>Naturally, we pursue endeavors that we believe will make us happy. We presume that achieving milestones such as a job promotion, getting married or earning a higher salary will make us happier.</p>
<a>impact bias</a>. Daniel Gilbert, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, found that both
<a>positive and negative events</a> had a briefer and less intense impact on test participants than they had predicted.
<a>productivity</a> expectations and quality measures set by the hospital.
<a>Documentation requirements</a> are time-consuming and cumbersome. Many physicians practice under
<a>2020 survey</a> of more than 15,000 physicians only supported my observations. It showed that 42% of physicians suffer from
<a> burnout</a> which is characterized by emotional exhaustion, feeling detached from one’s job responsibilities and a lack of personal accomplishment. This survey took place before the
<a>COVID pandemic</a> which has only placed further pressure on physicians and other healthcare workers.
<a>mindful</a>, you will have no other choice but join an endless hamster wheel and constantly chase future achievements with no end in sight.
<a>stress</a> and responsibility. People hold you to a higher standard and expect more out of you. You are under closer scrutiny and have more to lose. After all, the fall is greater from the top.
<p>Comedian Jim Carrey said it best: “I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it's not the answer.”</p>
<p>No, it is not always sunny with clear blue skies when you arrive at your desired destination. There will be plenty of rainy days with blustering winds.</p>
<a>dreams</a>. There is great value in setting and reaching
<a>goals</a>. However, it is important to be mindful as you embark on your endeavors and maintain a healthy relationship with success.
<a>anxious</a> about reaching future goals that we lose perspective and forget to be present. Anxiety is the thief that deprives us of the present moment. When we are anxious we are either looking too far into the future or ruminating on the past.
<a>meditation</a>. There are many types.
<a>gratitude meditation</a>. The practice of
<a>gratitude</a> is a powerful tool that grounds us in our present reality. Gratitude provides perspective by allowing us to balance the pursuit of future goals with a healthy appreciation of our current life.
<p>The pursuit of success is not necessarily a bad thing. There are many benefits to setting and reaching goals. The problem occurs when we overestimate such benefits and fail to appreciate the journey towards the destination.</p>
