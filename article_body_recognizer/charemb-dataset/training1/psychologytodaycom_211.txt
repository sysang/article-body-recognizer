<p>The hedonic treadmill is the idea that an individual's level of happiness, after rising or falling in response to positive or negative life events, ultimately tends to move back toward where it was prior to these experiences.</p>
<p>The process by which positive or negative effects on happiness fade over time is called hedonic adaptation.</p>

<div> <h3> Why does hedonic adaptation happen? </h3> </div>
<a>the functions of hedonic adaptation</a> could include limiting the detrimental physical effects of repeated intense feelings (such as
<a>stress</a>) and dampening motivational signals when they are not very useful for informing behavior (as when someone is unable to eliminate hunger or escape confinement).

<div> <div> <article> </article> </div> <div> <h1>Hallucination</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>A hallucination involves perceiving sensory stimuli that aren't really present. For example, someone might hear voices that aren’t there, or see patterns that others don’t see.</p>
<p>Hallucinations are a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum disorders, but they can arise from many different causes, such as medications, illnesses, alcohol or substance use, and sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Experiencing a hallucination can be scary, confusing, and overwhelming, both for those suffering from the hallucination and for their loved ones. But seeking help and beginning treatment can help alleviate that distress.</p>
<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Types and Symptoms </li> <li> Causes and Risk Factors </li> <li> Support and Treatment </li> </ul> </div>
<p>Hallucinations are tremendously variable. They can encompass any of the five senses. They can instill deep fear or involve neutral or even positive emotions.</p>
<p>Although experiencing a different reality than other people can be very frightening, doctors and mental health professionals can help identify the root cause and develop a treatment plan.</p>
<div> <h3> What are the different types of hallucinations? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the most common hallucinations? </h3> </div>
<p>Auditory hallucinations are most common, including for those with schizophrenia. People may hear sounds and voices, which may speak to the person (second-person "you" voices) or about the person (third-person "he” voices).</p>
<div> <h3> Do healthy people ever hallucinate? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can people tell if they're hallucinating? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Causes and Risk Factors </h2>
<p>Hallucinations can stem from a wide array of underlying conditions, and identifying the root cause is important for developing an effective approach to treatment.</p>
<p>Causes of hallucinations include:</p>
<li>Schizophrenia spectrum disorders</li>
<li>Alcohol and drug use or withdrawal</li>
<li>Sleep disorders and lack of sleep</li>
<li>Parkinson’s disease</li>
<div> <h3> How do LSD and psilocybin affect the brain? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are hallucinations from psychedelics different than hallucinations in mental health conditions? </h3> </div>
<a>psychosis</a> typically involves visual distortions like seeing geometric patterns,
<a>dopamine</a> signaling and over-activation of associative networks related to the content of the hallucination, while psychedelic hallucinations over-engage sensory areas and are linked to serotonin.
<div> <h3> Does bipolar disorder cause hallucinations? </h3> </div>
<a>bipolar disorder</a> do not experience psychotic symptoms, but delusions or hallucinations sometimes occur during severe manic or depressive episodes. People may see visions or hear voices that aren’t real during periods of
<a>mania</a>, characterized by euphoria, energy, distractibility, and grandiosity.
<p>For more, see <a>Bipolar Disorder.</a></p>
<div> <h3> Why do people hallucinate during sleep? </h3> </div>
<a>hallucinations only while sleeping, they may not be due to psychosis.</a> Instead, they may reflect a
<a>therapy</a> techniques, which led her to stop hallucinating.
<div> <h3> What are hypnagogic hallucinations? </h3> </div>
<a>sleep-related hallucinations</a> typically resolve with time.
<div> <h3> What are fever dreams? </h3> </div>
<a>dreams</a> are intense and vivid dreams, often nightmares, that people have when their body temperature is higher than usual. These dreams are more bizarre and more negative than typical dreams,
<a>research shows,</a> and the content often includes references to health and body temperature. They may occur because an elevated body temperature leads the brain to “overheat” as well, disrupting typical cognitive processes.
<h2> Support and Treatment </h2>
<div> <h3> How can I help a loved one who is hallucinating? </h3> </div>
<p>If a loved one is hallucinating, stay with them to help keep them safe. Assist them in seeking mental health care, and accompany them to see the doctor. </p>
<a>loved one's hallucinations,</a> partly out of a desire to relieve their suffering, and partly out of understandable feelings of fear and helplessness. Unfortunately, this can alienate the sufferer when they most need care.
<p>A more constructive approach is to recognize that your loved one’s psychotic symptoms are meaningful to them, while making it clear that you do not personally share in them.</p>
<div> <h3> Can I manage my hallucinations on my own? </h3> </div>
<p>The most important aspect of treating hallucinations is receiving regular mental health care from a professional. But the following steps may help individuals manage and <a>reduce hallucinations</a> themselves:</p>
<p>• Keep a diary of the hallucinations to identify and avoid the situations in which they arise.</p>
<p>• Choose a trusted person with whom to discuss the voices.</p>
<p>• Focus your <a>attention</a> on a distracting activity such as reading, singing, listening to music, gardening, or exercising.</p>
<p>• Challenge the voices and insist that they go away.</p>
<p>• Manage your levels of <a>stress</a> and anxiety.</p>
<p>• Ensure that you are getting enough sleep.</p>
<p>• Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs.</p>
<p>• Take medication as prescribed. If necessary, ask for a review of medication.</p>
<div> <h3> How is schizophrenia treated, and why is it important to attend to hallucinations associated with the disorder? </h3> </div>
<p>Adhering to a sustainable treatment plan is key to managing symptoms and leading a fulfilling life.</p>

<a>politics</a> or the military—groupthink can have much worse consequences, leading groups to ignore
