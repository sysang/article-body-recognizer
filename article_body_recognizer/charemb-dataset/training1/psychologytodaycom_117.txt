<a>first set of exercises</a> that were posted and follow sequentially with the
<a>fourth</a> before jumping into this final set below. Remember, when we are given opportunities to think about our thinking, we are engaging our metacognitive processes, and that’s a foundational part of critical thinking!
<li>Think about your solution to this problem, and identify two or three reasons why you went with it.</li>
<li>Were these reasons sufficient enough to warrant the implementation of your solution?</li>
<li>Did your solution work?</li>
<li>If not, think about why that might have been the case.</li>
<p>Take a couple of days to think about your responses to Activity 1. Then come back to it and think about three alternative solutions that could have been implemented.</p>
<li>Would any of these have worked?</li>
<li>If so, would any of them have worked better than the solution you actually implemented?</li>
<li>If so, why? Also, be sure to ask yourself why you didn’t implement any of these alternative solutions.</li>
<p>Make sure to consider and exemplify each of your solutions in terms of the consequences each solution might evoke. Evaluate your reasoning and the manner in which you assessed the situation—the problem, sub-problems, and potential solutions.</p>
<ul><li>Were you biased in any way with respect to your problem-solving?</li> </ul>
<p>You are asked, again, to consider these beliefs and reflect on them.</p>
<li>Have you changed your mind about any of them?</li>
<li>If so, what made you change your mind?</li>
<li>Did you decide to look for concrete evidence?</li>
<li>If not, what held you back from looking for evidence?</li>
<li>Did <a>bias</a> play a role in this decision?</li>
<p>Make sure to engage in intellectual honesty with yourself in this reflection.</p>
<a>decision-making</a> and problem-solving are necessary on a daily basis (Ku, 2009). Hopefully, this series of exercises has brought you closer to achieving your potential for critical thought.

<h1> Stop Modern Day Slavery and Human Trafficking </h1>
<h2> January is National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. </h2>
<li>The International Labor Organization (IL0) estimates that globally 40 million are slaves or trafficked and exploited for sex or labor, or both.</li>
<li>Human trafficking is a 150 billion dollar industry, with more than $99 billion made from commercial sexual exploitation.</li>
<li>The average age of exploitation in the United States is 12 to 14 years old. </li>
<li>There are hundreds of organizations dedicated to ending modern-day slavery and many ways to get involved. </li>
<p>Since 2010, January has been designated National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month. The significance of January is that the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the freedom of 3.1 million slaves was made on January 1, 1863.</p>
<p>However, despite the passage of the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution officially outlawing slavery and involuntary servitude, there endures the exploitation, commodification, and enslavement of hundreds of thousands in this country alone.</p>
<p>In 2017, the <a>International Labor Organization</a> along with other major global human rights organizations estimated that over 40 million people around the world are slaves or trafficked and exploited for sex or labor, or both.</p>
<a>150 billion dollar industry</a>, with more than $99 billion of that amount made from the commercial
<a>sexual</a> exploitation of (primarily) women and children. Labor trafficking in the areas of construction, mining, utilities, and manufacturing create the next largest chunk of profit–$34 billion dollars.
<a>defined by the United Nations</a> as “Human Trafficking is the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of people through force, fraud or
<a>deception</a>, with the aim of exploiting them for profit.”
<a>.04 percent of victims</a> are actually identified so there is a lot of this phenomenon that is hidden. It is important to note that human trafficking
<a>does not need to include the crossing of international borders</a>. Indeed, a large portion of human trafficking is internal or happens within borders.
<p>Further, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights pointed out there is considerable intersection and overlap between human rights issues/violations and instances of human trafficking.</p>
<h3>Human Trafficking in the United States</h3>
<a>50,000 foreign nationals</a> (mainly from
<a>Mexico and the Philippines)</a> are trafficked into the country annually and domestically, there is an estimated 200,000 youth at risk for being trafficked.
<a>“survival sex”</a> are now more correctly described as being “commercially sexually exploited” as a minor.
<p>Over half of the cases in the US involve children. This is not surprising considering that the average <a>age of exploitation</a> is 12 to 14 years old. </p>
<h3>The Impact of COVID19 on Human Trafficking</h3>
<a>US TIP Report</a>) highlights the impact of the
<a>COVID-19</a> pandemic and how this health crisis has exacerbated and increased those most vulnerable to human trafficking. Quarantines and stay-at-home orders hid an already invisible issue.
<p>Migrant workers are forced to bear the brunt of the abuse as they are unable to travel, leave slave-like environments, or access help. A Filipina domestic worker in Saudi Arabia said that she had to work over 14 hours a day. She shared,</p>
<p>The <a>Human Trafficking Institute</a> reported that in 2020, 83 percent of active sex trafficking cases involved the internet. </p>
<a>In-N-Out Burger</a> is not only matching donations at a 3 to 1 rate, but they also provide paper lap and placemats with each order that have important statistics about human trafficking.
<p>More people in more settings are also being trained with up-to-date knowledge. Social worker and professor Holly Sotelo stated,</p>
<blockquote> <p>As a society, we have a responsibility to know what human trafficking looks like, to report it, support the victims/survivors, to stand up against <a>sexism</a>, homophobia, <a>xenophobia</a>, and other forms of hate.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Holly is part of a multi-state project working to train school district faculty, staff, and students at some of the largest districts in the country.</p>

<h1> Montessori Children Often Turn Into Happy Adults </h1>
<h2> New research highlights the long-term benefits of a Montessori education. </h2>
<li>A Montessori education has been linked to elevated psychological well-being as an adult.</li>
<li>One reason is that children in Montessori schools are allowed to choose their own work and participate in meaningful activities.</li>
<li>They also experience greater social stability and cohesion in their classes. </li>

<p>The results held true even when the scientists accounted for other factors known to influence childhood and adult well-being.</p>
<p>“Our analyses controlled for age, <a>race and ethnicity</a>, <a>gender</a>, childhood socioeconomic status (SES), and private schooling, so we can confidently say that none of those factors is causing the results,” says Lillard.</p>
<p>This is good news for the estimated 500,000 children who are currently enrolled in Montessori schools in the United States.</p>
<p>The authors hope their research inspires more parents to take a closer look at non-traditional educational models, such as Montessori.</p>
<a>study</a> found that adults who experienced more residential moves as children (i.e., moving from one town to another) are more likely to develop certain psychological and health problems. Beyond that, the findings are scant.

<h2> Sources of Creativity </h2>
<p>There are many pieces to the puzzle of creativity, including a balance between controlled, deliberate thought and spontaneous play and imagination. Personality plays a role, as well as biology and life experience.</p>
<div> <h3> Why are some people more creative than others? </h3> </div>
<a>default mode network</a>, the salience network, and the executive control network—that collectively produce creative thought.
<div> <h3> Which personality traits are linked to creativity? </h3> </div>
<a>brain forge creative new connections.</a> Other characteristics that are linked to creativity include
<a>curiosity, positivity, energy, persistence, and intrinsic motivation.</a>
<div> <h3> What is “everyday creativity”? </h3> </div>
<a>intelligence</a> and natural ability, are capable of engaging in fulfilling creative processes. And buying into a limited definition of creativity prevents many from appreciating their own potential.
<div> <h3> What are “little-c” and “Big-C” creativity? </h3> </div>
<a>different degrees of creativity.</a> This framework was expanded into a theory called
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> How to Be More Creative </h2>
<div> <h3> How can I become more creative? </h3> </div>
<p>Various lines of research have converged around common insights that provide steps to be more creative:</p>
<p>1. Aim for output: Creative geniuses often produce their best works at their times of greatest output. Some pieces may miss the mark, but the quantity of output makes it likely that other pieces will yield great creativity.</p>
<p>2. Be willing to go deep: In the realm of artistic creativity, pioneers often spend time in solitude, feel emotions and sensations deeply, and aren’t afraid to self-reflect.</p>
<p>3. Be open and playful: The personality trait most tied to creativity is Openness to Experience—whether that be intellectual, aesthetic, or emotional.</p>
<p>4. Capture your ideas: Remember to record thoughts as they arise so they aren't forgotten.</p>
<p>5. Adopt or hire outside perspectives: It can be difficult to innovate if you become trapped in the rules and language of your domain of expertise.</p>
<p>6. Feel free to procrastinate: If you are motivated to solve a problem, procrastinating, exercising, or sleeping on it can lead to divergent thinking and more possibilities.</p>
<div> <h3> What leads to a “eureka moment”? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can creativity be taught? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can creativity be practiced? </h3> </div>
<a>risk-taking</a> and critical feedback, but persisting through discomfort can lead to an innovative and daring outcome.
<div> <h3> Does creativity benefit mental health? </h3> </div>
<a>Creativity may offer some surprising psychological benefits.</a> It can contribute to the ability to make meaning—such as finding ways to successfully cope with past experiences such as
<a>trauma</a>, regret, or nostalgia, helping to manage moods, relationships, and problem-solving, and establishing one’s professional and personal legacy for the future. Well-being, in turn, may facilitate creative thinking, such as by practicing
<a>mindfulness</a>, research suggests.
<h2> Creativity and the Brain </h2>
<div> <h3> What is the default mode network? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the salience network? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the executive control network? </h3> </div>
<a>decision-making</a> in the context of a larger goal.
<div> <h3> What is divergent thinking? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does creativity arise from the right side of the brain? </h3> </div>
<a>right brain governs creativity is largely a myth.</a> Creativity and imagination involve communication between networks throughout both hemispheres, research shows. Those networks work together and collectively manipulate ideas, images, and symbols.
<h2> Creativity and Mental Illness </h2>
<div> <h3> Are highly creative people more likely to have mental illness? </h3> </div>
<a>bipolar disorder</a>, schizotypy, and schizophrenia, are disproportionately diagnosed in highly creative individuals (they've been most often measured in artists, musicians, and writers) or in their first-degree relatives. 
<div> <h3> Why do genius and mental illness often overlap? </h3> </div>
<a>psychosis</a> and for novel thinking.
<a>mystery between genius and mental illness</a> is rooted in the diametric theory, an idea put forth by sociologist
<a>genes</a> produce mentalizing traits—psychosis at its most extreme.)
<a>autistic</a> and schizophrenic—double outliers. True genius in some realms, especially mathematics and science, could represent that unique overlap.
<div> <h3> Is there a genetic link between creativity and mental illness? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Could there be an evolutionary trade-off between psychiatric illness and creativity? </h3> </div>
<a>bipolar disorder offer an evolutionary advantage, in that they predispose individuals to greater creativity,</a> achievement, and success that can benefit both individuals and societies.
<div> <h3> How can people with mental illness balance the importance of medication with their creative goals? </h3> </div>
<p>People with <a>bipolar disorder can be deeply concerned that medication will strip away the creativity</a> and <a>productivity</a> that accompany <a>manic episodes</a>. Therefore it’s important to address the topic in <a>therapy</a>.</p>
<p>Creativity is typically seen as a socially beneficial trait. But some people use their imagination in pursuit of antisocial ends—what's sometimes termed “dark creativity” or “malevolent creativity.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, creativity may be better conceived as neither inherently positive nor inherently negative. Instead, it may be best to assess motivations and outcomes when judging the value of any creative act.</p>
<div> <h3> What motivates dark creativity? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Which traits are associated with dark creativity? </h3> </div>
<a>childhood</a> experiences, such as neglect, and traits in the
<a>dark triad</a>, such as narcissism. Another characteristic linked to dark creativity is
<a>aggression</a>. In one study, premeditation (planning ahead of time) controlled an individual’s expression of malevolent creativity more than implicit aggression—in other words, being able to hold off on your impulses can make even those
<a>primed to be aggressive and darkly creative</a> less harmful when provoked.
<div> <h3> Can creativity fall between light and dark? </h3> </div>
