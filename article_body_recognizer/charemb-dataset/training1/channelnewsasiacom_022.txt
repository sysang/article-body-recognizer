<p>Projek Lagu got close to 200 submissions, and Mr Fairuz, with his friend Wawan Husen, a Suria star, were among 12 contestants who made it on air.</p>
<p>The duo made it through 10 episodes of the show to the finale on Nov 9 with four competitors but didn’t win the grand prize.</p>
<p>The song they entered in the competition Cuba Lagi (“Try Again” in Malay), was written a few years ago but has an uplifting message for these times.</p>
<p>“Basically, it's about life, you shouldn't give up hope even when COVID hits. So we need to keep on trying wherever it is,” said Mr Fairuz, 33.</p>
<p>“Just try and try, don’t give up … that’s the message behind the song.”</p>
<p>For the busker, who was a fixture at Haji Lane for a decade, losing that part of his life was a big blow and besides some music production, he’s also working as a kitchen assistant.</p>
<p>On top of that, he and other Haji Lane buskers are collaborating on an album, to be released next year. </p>
<p>“We still need to move on and continue on with our lives. But busking is a really important part of my life,” he said. “I don’t know how other people see busking … for me, it’s really (my) passion.</p>
<p>“It's not only about money, but it's also about the connection between the performer and the audience.”</p>
<h2>DELIVERING FOOD AND COMMUNITY</h2>
<p>Busker Jonathan Goh, who is part of acrobatic duo The Annoying Brothers, said like other buskers, he picked up another job to make ends meet. But he has also been busy preparing for the eventual restart of street performances.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, he created the Singapore Buskers Facebook group which grew from five or six people to more than 500 today, not all of whom are buskers. </p>
<p>There are about 300 buskers registered with the National Arts Council in Singapore, with one in two below 35 years old.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr Goh started the Buskers’ Association which he described as the “NTUC”, or a union, for buskers.</p>
<p>A co-chair of the association, he feels that performing virtually is not sustainable, especially for acts like his. </p>
<p>“The virtual space is now overly saturated,” he said, pointing out that even big stars held concerts online during the pandemic. </p>
<p>“You can’t expect Ronaldo to play e-sports ... so why are you expecting the buskers to go become streamers?” he asked.</p>
<p>“You feel the adrenaline rush with the performer when you're in the same space.”</p>
<p>He’s now started a new programme called Buskers’ Lab, with funding from National Arts Council, to create a “safe, experimental space” so that the street performers can collaborate and create new, innovative acts.</p>
<p>“I can sing better, I can juggle better, but … what can we do to present it differently?” he said.</p>
<p>Despite the COVID-19 restrictions, he’s pushing for the performances to be in an outdoor space and is applying for approval to stage a show with safe management measures in place, he said.</p>
<p>While there were busking pilots organised by the National Arts Council earlier, they have been suspended since community cases began rising around May this year and the first round of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) restrictions began.</p>
<p>This was a major disappointment for Mr Goh and many other buskers, who had hoped that some form of outdoor entertainment could resume after a year of not performing.</p>
<p>“Last year, everyone was patiently waiting … but this year, it was like someone is driving a car and keeps jamming the brakes.”</p>
<p>He said that some buskers are doing part-time jobs while waiting for things to get back to normal, while others have quit busking altogether. Some have had to dig deep into their savings, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he’s taking the opportunity to “create conversation” and make the community more tight-knit, he said.</p>
<p>“I think this is very important … If you have a segregated community, it's very, very hard for things to move forward."</p>

<h1> Would you clone your dog or cat? Some Singapore pet owners have taken the first step </h1>
<div> <p>Pet cloning sounds novel but has been around for over a decade. People in favour of the practice say some pets are ‘one in a million’, but opponents cite animal welfare and other issues.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Neo Chai Chin </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Travelling between Sydney and Gold Coast in Australia years ago, vet Jean-Paul Ly and his children stopped at a restaurant for a meal. A farmer walked in with two cattle dog puppies.</p>
<p>Ly’s children cuddled the dogs and asked their father if they could have them. The family could take only one, and Ly chose the blue cattle dog.</p>
<p>Khan was also a source of comfort when Ly was at his lowest. “He’d sit there and look at you. And when he’d look at you, it was like he understood,” said Ly. “When I was sad, he’d come up and nuzzle up against me.</p>
<p>“When he died, a piece of me died with him.”</p>
<p>Seven to eight months before Khan died at the age of 17, Ly took the dog’s skin cells and had the sample frozen.</p>
<p>If successful, Khan’s clone might be the first such pet to be imported into Singapore.</p>
<p>Three entities in the world do pet cloning: Besides Sinogene, there is Sooam Biotech in South Korea — where it reportedly costs about US$100,000 to clone a dog — and ViaGen Pets and Equine based in Texas, United States.</p>
<h2>SOME HAVE STORED PETS’ DNA OVERSEAS</h2>
<p>In Singapore, some vets have seen clients who want to take skin samples of their pets in case they want to clone them in future. But it is not apparent that any clients have gone ahead with the cloning.</p>
<p>ViaGen Pets told CNA Insider that “a few clients in Singapore” have stored DNA with the company, but none of them are pet cloning clients yet.</p>
<p>Genetic preservation costs US$1,600 at ViaGen, the company said. It charges US$35,000 to clone a cat, US$50,000 to clone a dog and US$85,000 to clone a horse.</p>
<p>Ly, who came out of a five-year retirement last year and practises at Animal Wellness Centre, said he has encountered six such clients in the past eight years.</p>
<p>In a recent episode of On The Red Dot, he extracted a skin sample from young English bulldog Wouwou through a process called a punch biopsy.</p>
<p>“It’s a beautiful patient,” Ly said. “She’s a really nice dog. That’s one of the reasons why the owners want to clone (her). You get one in a million. You get a dog that’s so fantastic.”</p>
<p>Wouwou’s owner said on the programme: “Having a dog, it’s like having a child. But then you know that their lifespan isn’t going to outlive yours, in a way.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> It’s nice to just have that at the back of your mind. Like, oh, I’d have the option to clone her.” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<div> <div> <div><p>WATCH: Pet surgery and cloning? Life of vets | On The Red Dot | At the vets — part 2 (23:24)</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>While The Animal Doctors have carried out requests and respect this decision of clients who may wish to clone their pets, “we do advise clients to consider the ethics of doing so”, she added.</p>
<p>“We do explain that there are unknowns when dealing with cloning. We also try to keep the perspective that the cloned animal isn’t likely to be the exact same pet they had before, in terms of behaviour and health.”</p>
<p>The vet cited ethical and animal welfare implications. “Scientifically, it’s still an unknown, and there isn’t enough evidence to support this practice, especially with respect to the long-term survival and health of these pets,” she said.</p>
<p>“These cloning companies are often commercial and give a promise/false hope to an owner who may be grieving (for) their beloved pet. This practice is highly questionable.”</p>
<p>The National Parks Board’s Animal and Veterinary Service does not track whether there are cloned pets in Singapore. Its import requirements do not include a declaration of whether a pet is a clone.</p>
<p>Ly and fellow vet Lee Yee Lin think it unlikely, however, that any such pets have been imported so far.</p>
<p>The Singapore Veterinary Association (SVA), meanwhile, “strongly opposes” the cloning of companion animals. The costs and negative implications for animal welfare far outweigh the benefits, if any, of pet cloning, it said.</p>
<p>The SVA said it is “strongly supportive” of scientific advancement and can sympathise with pet owners who may be drawn to the prospect of replacing a former pet via animal cloning.</p>
<p>“However, overall, pet cloning doesn’t improve animal welfare, animal health nor does it have any real social value in nurturing the human-animal bond,” it added.</p>
<p>The association described the promise of cloning an exact replica of a pet as false because the expression of a pet’s genome “as a whole” is beyond any laboratory’s control.</p>
<p>“Just like in humans, the experiences and environment that a pet is raised in shape the overall identity and character of the pet,” it said.</p>
<p>The SVA is also against cloning facilities using animals bred for the “sole purpose of harvesting eggs and/or surrogacy”. </p>
<p>“As there are likely to be failures including the destruction of numerous embryos, miscarriages and foetal abnormalities developing, the process is repeated as required until an ‘acceptable animal’ is produced,” it said.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Overall, the production of clones for commercial purposes doesn’t justify the … suffering of the donor animals.” </blockquote> </section> </div>
<div> <div><p>Thousands of dogs, cats and other animals in Singapore need a home, and pet cloning may “worsen the management of the animal population as a whole, especially if this adversely affects shelter adoption rates”, the SVA noted.</p></div> </div>
<p>In the case of dogs, eggs are taken from a female dog. The nucleus is removed from the donor egg, which is then injected with the nucleus of a body cell of the dog that is to be cloned.</p>
<p>Electrical stimulation “activates” the fused cell and it starts to divide. This process is called somatic cell nuclear transfer. The embryo is then implanted into a surrogate mother dog.</p>
<p>It takes about 60 days for a puppy to be born.</p>
<p>CNA Insider contacted Sinogene, Sooam and ViaGen for information on their animal welfare measures and the average number of animals involved in cloning a pet. Sinogene and Sooam did not respond.</p>
<p>ViaGen said it is “committed to the health and well-being of each and every dog and cat with whom we work” but did not provide details.</p>
<p>Proponents of pet cloning agree that cloned pets will not be exact replicas of the original animals. A clone is genetically identical to the original animal, and often likened to an identical twin but born at a later date.</p>
<p>Proponents also note that animal welfare issues are rife in other settings, such as pet breeding facilities or puppy mills, and in industrial agriculture (for example, egg-laying hens or cows reared for milk).</p>
<h2>FIRST DOG CLONE CREATED IN 2005</h2>
<p>While animal cloning may seem novel, it is not. According to the US’ National Human Genome Research Institute, scientists have conducted cloning experiments on animals using various techniques over the past 50 years.</p>
<p>In 1996, Dolly the sheep was the first mammal successfully cloned — after 276 attempts — from the cell of an adult animal.</p>
<p>In 2005, Snuppy the Afghan hound became the first dog clone to be created, in South Korea. The cloning team reportedly assembled 1,095 eggs containing the DNA of Snuppy’s genetic father and transferred them into 123 surrogate mothers.</p>
<p>Three pregnancies resulted, two went to term, and one of the clones died from pneumonia at 22 days old.</p>
<p>In February, scientists announced the first cloning of a native endangered species in the US — a black-footed ferret — using frozen cells from a creature that died in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Cloning can help to build the populations of endangered species, noted the National Human Genome Research Institute.</p>
<p>Researchers have also been cloning livestock — since 1996, according to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) — with the main purpose of producing quality herds that are, for instance, resistant to disease.</p>
<p>While the clones are then used for conventional breeding, rather than for food, the FDA has determined that food from cloned cows, pigs and goats is as safe to eat as food from any other cattle, swine or goat.</p>
<p>Apart from science, people weigh up whether they should support pet cloning, or not, based on emotions. Vets on both sides of the fence cited respect for pets as a reason for their stance.</p>
<p>The “respectful thing” to do after a pet has died, according to Lee, the head vet at Gentle Oak Veterinary Clinic, is to cherish memories of the pet and offer a loving home to another dog or cat.</p>
<p>“Why would you need another Fluffy if we’ve done all we can as a pet parent and absolutely respected (their) life on earth when we had them?” she said.</p>
<p>“It’s a life cycle and a natural cycle for a reason … If cloning’s supposed to work, we should be growing a liver or heart for humans who need a transplant.”</p>
<p>When vets meet clients who want to hold on to ill or old pets forever, a big part of their responsibility is to see the clients through the grieving process, she added.</p>
<p>“It’s never easy, they’re still going to feel really upset and grieve, but it’s a healthy (process) that they’ll go through.”</p>
<p>That said, she would respect the decision of clients who wish to clone their pets.</p>
<p>As for Ly, respect for Khan was precisely one of the reasons for wanting it cloned.</p>
<p>“I’ve been looking around for a dog that has his characteristics, and it’s not so easy to find. It’s one in a million. You ask any pet owner, when they have this special one — (it’s) never the same,” he said.</p>
<p>He is against cloning humans. But for individuals who cannot let a pet go or had formed a particular bond with it, cloning fills a specific need, Ly said in a personal capacity.</p>
<p>“Of course, you have to have money,” he said. “If you do, I don’t see the hurt in (pet cloning), because mental health today is at the lowest it’s ever been (in developed countries) … Every little bit helps.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sport </a> </p> <h1> Human cost of China's green energy rush ahead of Winter Olympics </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BAODING, Hebei: Beaten, forced off their land, cheated out of money, and even falsely imprisoned - farmers in China say they are paying a heavy price as authorities rush to deliver on ambitious pledges to ramp up national green energy output.</p>
<p>In a hamlet near Beijing, the Long family - who say they've lost more than half their agricultural land to a sprawling solar farm next door - now have so little income they are burning corn husks and plastic bags to stay warm in winter.</p>
<p>"We were promised just 1,000 yuan per mu of land each year when the power company leased the land for 25 years," farmer Long from Huangjiao village said, using a Chinese unit of land equal to approximately 667 sq m.</p>
<p>"We can make more than double the amount by growing corn in the same area. Now without land, I eke out a living as a day labourer."</p>
<p>China is the world's biggest producer of wind turbines and solar panels, and the Winter Olympics is seen as an opportunity to showcase the country's green technologies as they seek global markets.</p>
<p>To ensure an uninterrupted power supply for the Games - and clear the winter smog choking the Chinese capital - Hebei province neighbouring Beijing has built a giant plant that takes in power from renewable projects in the province.</p>
<p>That one plant creates 14 billion kilowatt hours of clean electricity every year, similar to the annual energy consumption of Slovenia.</p>
<p>But for farmers like Long and his neighbour Pi, the green energy boom has made their lives more dangerous and difficult.</p>
<p>Pi says villagers were forced to sign contracts - seen by AFP - leasing their land to the solar park built by State Power Investment Group (SPIC), one of the five biggest utility companies in the country.</p>
<p>Those who didn't agree were beaten by the police, he said, adding "some were hospitalised, some were detained."</p>
<h3>'SUPPRESSED AND IMPRISONED'</h3>
<p>Pi was jailed for 40 days, while Long languished in prison for nine months for "illegally gathering and disturbing peace," after a public protest.</p>
<p>"The situation is similar to a mafia," Pi said. "If you complain, then you'll be suppressed, imprisoned and sentenced."</p>
<p>The average annual disposable rural income in Baoding is about 16,800 yuan (US$2,600), a figure both Long and Pi said they can no longer make.</p>
<p>AFP could not confirm that electricity from the SPIC project near Huangjiao would be used to power the Olympic venues directly, because that information is not publicly available.</p>
<p>The company declined to confirm when asked by AFP.</p>
<p>But the Zhangjiakou government - the city co-hosting the Games - has said that since winning the Olympic bid in 2015, the area has "transformed itself from scratch (into) the largest non-hydro renewable energy base in China."</p>
<p>Government subsidies for wind and solar farms have also accelerated construction of such projects in other parts of Hebei, as China scrambles to cut air pollution before the Games.</p>
<p>In a statement, Amnesty International said "forced evictions, illegal land seizures, and loss of livelihoods related to the loss of land" were among the most frequent human rights concerns associated with the wind and solar energy sectors.</p>
<p>China wants 25 percent of its electricity to come from non-fossil fuels by 2030.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the country has to more than double its current wind and solar capacity - but environmentalists warn land seizures will become more widespread as energy companies rush to produce renewables.</p>
<p>And although Beijing has set a series of ambitious targets around the Winter Olympics, green campaigners face heavy pressure in China if they challenge the official line.</p>
<p>Several told AFP they were not comfortable discussing Beijing's environmental targets for the Games for fear of reprisals.</p>
<p>In September, China announced strict rules for compensation when land is taken over for ecological projects, including the development of green energy.</p>
<p>"Our land zoning (rules) also clearly regulate what agricultural land can't be occupied, especially farmland," Li Dan, secretary general of the renewable energy professionals committee, which promotes green development.</p>
<p>If farmland is being used for renewable energy projects there should be a benefit sharing programme in place such as powering greenhouses, she said.</p>
<p>But several farmers AFP spoke to said companies were labelling agricultural fields as wasteland to skirt the rules.</p>
<p>Xu Wan, a farmer in Zhangjiakou, lost his land to a solar installation built during the run-up to the Games.</p>
<p>"The company told us this was non-usable land, but actually it's all very good agricultural land used by us farmers," Xu said.</p>
<p>"They said they would give us 3,000 yuan per mu of land. But in the end, we got nothing."</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Yiyuan New Energy Development, which installed the solar project in Xu's village, did not respond to AFP's request for comment.</p>
<p>Jiang Yi, a Chinese Academy of Engineering researcher, told a state-run industry news site that in future China will need 30,000 - 40,000 sq km more land to meet the renewable energy needs.</p>
<p>"Where the land comes from has become the biggest issue restricting the development of the industry," he said.</p>
<h3>'THE CORRUPTION IS INTOLERABLE'</h3>
<p>Renewable investments also made up over half the new projects under China's global infrastructure push -- the Belt and Road initiative -- last year.</p>
<p>"The most prevalent issue was inadequate disclosure of environmental impact assessment (data)... followed by issues related to land rights and loss of livelihoods," she said.</p>
<p>To reduce conflicts when taking over village land, China has billed most solar farms as poverty alleviation projects, where villagers get free electricity from solar panels installed on their roofs.</p>
<p>According to 2014 state guidelines, utility companies should then buy back the extra electricity in a programme to lift two million families out of poverty by 2020.</p>
<p>The National Energy Administration said last year more than double that number benefited.</p>
<p>But in Huangjiao with over 300 households, only two roofs had solar panels, and villagers said there had been no programme to install solar panels.</p>
<p>"At a central level, the government has good policies for farmers," Pi from Huangjiao village said.</p>
<p>"But once it comes to the village level, things change. The corruption at the grassroots level is intolerable."</p>

<p>Crystal Palace manager Patrick Vieira will miss Sunday's (Dec 26) Premier League match at Tottenham Hotspur after testing positive for COVID-19, the English club said.</p>
<p>Assistant manager Osian Roberts will take charge of the team against Tottenham.</p>
<p>Palace are 11th in the Premier League table with 20 points from 17 matches.</p>
<p>British media reported that the game against Tottenham had been in doubt due to a COVID-19 outbreak at Palace but the South London club confirmed about three hours before kickoff that it would go ahead.</p>
<p>Palace's trip to Watford last week was postponed due to coronavirus cases at the home club.</p>

<p>PARIS: Champions Toulouse's home game on Sunday (Dec 26) with Stade Francais became the fourth Top 14 clash to be called off due to a surfeit of COVID-19 positive tests in the visiting club.</p>
<p>The decimated round of Boxing Day fixtures equates to the English Premier League which has seen three of Sunday's scheduled matches called off due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Two Premier League club managers, <a>Steven Gerrard of Aston Villa</a> and <a>Crystal Palace's Patrick Vieira</a> will be unable to take their places in the dugout for their respective matches due to testing positive.</p>
<p>The Toulouse match joins Sunday's Brive-Clermont clash and two which were due to be played on Monday Racing 92-Pau and Toulon hosting leaders Begles-Bordeaux.</p>
<p>The French league (LNR) said "the health situation in the (Stade Francais) squad "had forced their hand to postpone the match".</p>
<p>"The date of the rescheduled match will be made known at a later date," the LNR added.</p>
<p>Just three matches of the halfway point of the league season remain on.</p>
<p>Sunday's game between Perpignan and Castres and two on Monday, bottom side Biarritz hosting Montpellier and last season's beaten finalists La Rochelle at home to Lyon.</p>
<p>Finding dates for the postponed matches could prove problematic especially as seven European matches featuring French clubs were postponed last weekend due to the stricter travel regulations imposed by the British Government.</p>
<p>However, there are three weekends free of Top 14 fixtures but they are set aside due to them being Six Nations matchdays.</p>
<p>COVID-19 infections in France hit six figures on Saturday, health officials recording 104,611 cases over the previous 24 hours, the third consecutive day the numbers have been record highs.</p>
<p>The latest figures mark a dramatic rise since the beginning of the month: On Dec 4, the numbers broke 50,000 for the first time before rising steadily.</p>
<p>Scottish sports events have as of Sunday become "effectively spectator-free" as part of a drive to slow the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's administration told the Scottish Parliament last Tuesday crowds at outdoor public events would be capped at 500 from December 26 for "up to three weeks".</p>
<p>Her announcement followed even tougher measures announced in Wales, where all sports events must be held behind closed doors from Dec 26.</p>
<p>The new rules in Scotland will impact football fixtures over the festive period including the Old Firm derby between Celtic and Rangers on Jan 2.</p>

<p> Manchester City led the way in a bumper Boxing Day goal feast in the Premier League on Sunday with a 6-3 win over Leicester City sending them six points clear at the top of the standings.</p>
<p>The opening five games of the COVID-19 impacted festive programme delivered 26 goals with Arsenal romping to a 5-0 win away to bottom club Norwich City and Chelsea enjoying a 3-1 win at Aston Villa.</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur beat Crystal Palace 3-0 while Southampton enjoyed a surprise 3-2 win at West Ham United.</p>
<p>Pep Guardiola's City are on 47 points with Liverpool, whose match against Leeds United was called off due to COVID-19 cases in the Yorkshire team, on 41 points.</p>
<p>Third-placed Chelsea are also on 41 points, while Arsenal move up to fourth place on 35 points.</p>
<p>City got off to a flying start, grabbing a fifth-minute lead through Belgian midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, before a Riyad Mahrez penalty put the hosts in control nine minutes later. </p>
<p>Things went from bad to worse for a weakened Leicester side with Ilkay Gundogan and another penalty, converted by Raheem Sterling, giving the hosts a four-goal lead inside 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Despite looking dead and buried, though, Leicester stormed back in the second half as goals from James Maddison, Ademola Lookman and Kelechi Iheanacho threatened to derail the league leaders. </p>
<p>But Aymeric Laporte's 69th-minute header and Sterling's late second took the champions over the line.</p>
<p>Arsenal's fourth straight win came in convincing fashion at Carrow Road with Mikel Arteta's side taking a sixth minute lead through Bukayo Saka who finished off a fine, flowing move.</p>
<p>Kieran Tierney doubled the lead just before the break with Martin Odegaard providing the killer pass for the Scotland left back, who struck a low shot into the net.</p>
<p>England forward Saka grabbed Arsenal's third in the 67th minute with another low strike before Alexandre Lacazette was fouled in the box and got up to stroke home the spot kick in the 84th.</p>
<p>Substitute Emile Smith Rowe wrapped up the win with a simple tap-in during stoppage time.</p>
<p>Chelsea fell behind at Villa when a Matt Targett cross flew in off the head of defender Reece James but Jorginho brought Thomas Tuchel's side level from the spot just before the break.</p>
<p>Romelu Lukaku, a halftime substitute, put Chelsea ahead with a fine glancing header from a Callum Hudson-Odoi cross and then in stoppage time he was brought down by Ezri Konsa and Jorginho again made no mistake from the spot.</p>
<p>Spurs stretched their unbeaten Premier League run under new manager Antonio Conte to six games thanks to a strong display against a Palace side reduced to ten men for the second half.</p>
<p>Lucas Moura created goals for Harry Kane and Son Heung-min and bagged one himself as Tottenham comfortably beat a Palace team for whom manager Patrick Vieira missed the game because of a positive COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>Palace had winger Wilfried Zaha was sent off in the 37th minute but by that time Spurs were already well on top.</p>
<p>Harry Kane had swept in the opener from Moura's pass before Moura himself headed the second.</p>
<p>Son wrapped up the win with his side's third from close range in the 74th minute.</p>
<p>James Ward-Prowse scored one and created another as Southampton took three points from their visit to London Stadium against a West Ham side that have gone five games without a win.</p>
<p>Southampton took the lead after eight minutes through Mohamed Elyounoussi but substitute Michail Antonio levelled for the Hammers in the 49th minute.</p>
<p>Ward-Prowse restored the away side's advantage from the spot in the 61st minute, only for West Ham's Said Benrahma to restore parity.</p>
<p>Jan Bednarek secured the first win since Nov. 5 for the Saints in the 70th minute after deftly turning in a curling free kick from Ward-Prowse.</p>
<p>In the day's late fixture Brighton Hove Albion ended an 11-game winless run as they beat Brentford 2-0 to move ninth - Leandro Trossard and Neal Maupay were on target before halftime.</p>
<p>Wolverhampton Wanderers v Watford and Burnley v Everton were also postponed due to COVID outbreaks.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Mustard, fries in short supply due to Canada climate woes </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>OTTAWA: A mix of drought in Canada's prairies and flooding on its Pacific coast have brought about crop production and shipping woes now leading to international shortages of fries and mustard.</p>
<p>"When we look back at the state of the agriculture sector in 2021, we can say this year has been marked by extreme climate change weather events," Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said in a recent speech.</p>
<p>"That includes the worst drought in 60 years in Western Canada and the devastating atmospheric rivers in British Columbia," she told livestock farmers and ranchers who've struggled to secure enough hay to feed their animals as pastures dried up.</p>
<p>According to government data, farmers in Canada produced more corn but less wheat, canola, barley, soybeans and oats in 2021 compared with 2020.</p>
<p>The lower yields - which Statistics Canada said marked the largest year-over-year decrease on record, falling to levels not seen in more than a decade - were driven largely by drought conditions in Western Canada.</p>
<p>Keith Currie of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture told AFP: "There's a lot of angst in the farming community." Some farmers have lost everything, others are considering quitting as the future looks bleak.</p>
<p>The Agri-Food Analytics Labs at Dalhousie University publishes a list of the top 10 food-related stories each year. Climate calamities in Western Canada ranked second this year, after food inflation.</p>
<p>"Climate change has strongly impacted agricultural production and supply chains" already strained by the pandemic, its scientific director Sylvain Charlebois told AFP, leading to rising food costs.</p>
<p>"This year saw extremes," he said, noting a Canadian record high temperature of 49.6 degrees Celsius in the town of Lytton in British Columbia. It was later destroyed by wildfires.</p>
<p>Subsequent flood devastation in British Columbia showed that Canada's westward supply links, Charlebois said, "are very, very vulnerable, and not resilient enough to climate change."</p>
<h2>HEAVY RAINS DISRUPTED SHIPPING</h2>
<p>Because of the drought, meanwhile, mustard seed production in the prairies was halved this year to almost 50,000 metric tonnes, from 2020.</p>
<p>As a result, the average price is expected to double to "a record US$1,700 (1,510 euros) per tonne," according to a Canadian agriculture ministry report.</p>
<p>The French region of Burgundy hosts the vast majority of mustard manufacturers but depends heavily on Canadian farmers to produce the strong, tangy condiment consumed the world over.</p>
<p>Commodity markets analyst Ramzy Yelda noted that droughts in Western Canada occur every 10-15 years on average, but this year's "was particularly brutal."</p>
<p>"I don't think we're done with these kinds of severe weather situations," added Currie. "We're going to continue seeing them more frequently."</p>
<p>On the flip side, it was a banner year for Canadian potato producers who harvested 123,000,000 hundredweight of potatoes, up 18 percent from the prior year.</p>
<p>The United Potato Growers of Canada said most provinces this year "enjoyed excellent harvest conditions without cool temperatures or wet conditions."</p>
<p>But record downpours in British Columbia that trapped motorists in deadly mudslides, forced thousands to evacuate their homes and destroyed roads, rail lines and bridges in November also cut off the port of Vancouver from the rest of Canada.</p>
<p>That resulted in disruptions to exports from Canada's largest port.</p>
<p>As a result, McDonalds restaurants in Japan announced that they would only sell small-sized French fries for a week from Friday to avoid running out.</p>
<p>"Due to large-scale flooding near the Port of Vancouver ... and the global supply chain crunch caused by the coronavirus pandemic, there are delays in the supply of potatoes," it said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The port had moved record volumes of grain (and cargo) by midyear, up 20 percent to 16.5 million metric tonnes compared to the first six months of 2020, to meet strong demand overseas.</p>
<p>But a large backlog built up over several weeks in November.</p>
<p>As of Monday, the port said disruptions to rail operations serving the port had "decreased significantly" and shipping volumes had "stabilised."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> EU countries at odds over green investment label for nuclear energy </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BRUSSELS: European Union countries disagreed ahead of a summit on Thursday (Dec 16) over whether the bloc should label nuclear energy as a climate-friendly investment, as leaders await a decision on the matter from Brussels.</p>
<p>The European Commission is considering whether to include nuclear and natural gas in its "sustainable finance taxonomy", a rulebook that will restrict which activities can be labelled as climate-friendly investments.</p>
<p>"Poland very strongly supports the possibility of financing investments in gas and in nuclear power," Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki said.</p>
<p>"Others have doubts about that and Poland clearly calls for it and I will be saying that strongly today to adopt that in the conclusions," Morawiecki said.</p>
<p>The Commission has said it aims to decide this month on whether nuclear and gas are labelled green, but has struggled to resolve in-fighting between the bloc's countries - including France and Germany, who are split over the fuels.</p>
<p>Gas is similarly divisive, with countries split between those that say it is needed to help them quit more-polluting coal, and those that say labelling a fossil fuel as a green investment is not credible.</p>
<p>The Commission first proposed its taxonomy rules in November 2020, but delayed a decision on gas after intense lobbying from countries and industry, and said it needed more time to gather expert views on the environmental impact of nuclear waste.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why email is the bane of many working lives </h1>
<div> <p>In the age of texting and multi-media communication, email still retains its position as a primary working communication tool. Academics from the UK explore why this old-school means of communication is still in fashion.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Emma Russel </a> , <a> Kevin Daniels </a> , <a> Marc Fullman </a> <a> Tom Jackson </a> </div> </div>
<p>Yet it may not be through active choice that email continues to dominate our working lives.</p>
<p>Many academic studies have found that there is a certain addictive, habitual component to our use of work email that might be difficult for us to change.</p>
<p>At a time when there are so many concerns being raised about always-on work cultures and our right to disconnect, email is the bane of many of our working lives.</p>
<p>We were approached by an international UK-based charity that was concerned about recent staff survey results suggesting that email was making many of their employees feel stressed.</p>
<p>We were asked to design a long-term intervention that could help the staff to change their work-email habits to improve their wellbeing and productivity.</p>
<p>We developed a model using existing research on changing people’s habits, and how work email is used.</p>
<p>A key aspect of the model is that unlike, say, a health habit such as smoking, work habits are seldom good or bad per se, but depend on the worker’s role and work context.</p>
<p>We consider that a work habit should only be defined as good or bad in relation to whether it helps or hinders someone from fulfilling their tasks and goals, and how it affects their wellbeing.</p>
<p>For example, for a person in a customer-serving role, responding immediately to email notifications can be a good habit as they achieve their central objective of being responsive and helpful to customers.</p>
<p>But for a scientist or a writer, the same habit could be detrimental as it might distract them from concentrating on complex work for long periods.</p>
<p>We ran our model for a year with 127 employees at the charity. These workers had responded to an open call to engage in the research and were randomly assigned to an intervention or a control group that were roughly equal in size.</p>
<p>For all participants, we measured their email habits and work goals before, during and after the programme.</p>
<p>We provided all workers in the intervention group with work-email tips over a period of about nine months, disseminating these one at a time on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Tips included a suggestion to turn off work-email alerts, especially when doing something that demanded a lot of concentration, and to only manually check their inbox every 30-40 minutes.</p>
<p>As each participant received a tip, they had to confirm to us whether they would be implementing this suggestion or not.</p>
<p>This meant they were given control over whether it would be appropriate for them and the work they do. Workers in the control group didn’t receive any tips.</p>
<p>Our results showed that workers who received the tips and expressly committed to using them were more likely to change their email behaviour overall.</p>
<p>Those who changed their habits enjoyed an improved sense of wellbeing and their perceived ability to achieve work goals increased.</p>
<p>The participants who benefited most were the ones with the highest levels of self-efficacy (a belief in one’s ability to exert control over work and achieve desirable outcomes).</p>
<p>In other words, only when people believe they can make the changes will they actually succeed and reap the benefits.</p>
<p>Our research shows how important it is for initiatives aimed at changing employees’ habits to accommodate individual preferences so that they have control over what they change.</p>
<p>To improve the email habits of workers, organisations should therefore provide plans to help them decide which habits might need altering, while leaving the decision to the individual about what to implement in the context of their role.</p>
<p>Coupled with this, organisations should provide self-efficacy training to give staff the resources and confidence to change their habits.</p>
<p>That will maximise the chances of success, helping as many people as possible to ditch those dysfunctional work-email habits and develop better, more effective ways of working.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> This young man lost his arm and could be exempted from NS. He chose to serve anyway </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aqil Haziq Mahmud </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Corporal (NS) Tan Kok Yew remembers that moment in 2017, when the medical examiner at his pre-enlistment screening exercise told him he did not need to serve two years of National Service (NS).</p>
<p>"When I found out I could be exempted, I was like (some of) those pre-enlistees; I thought that NS would waste two years of my time," he told CNA. "I was happy that I could use those extra two years to further my studies."</p>
<p>Despite that, CPL (NS) Tan was still not fully convinced about his thoughts, so he told the medical examiner he needed some time to think it over.</p>
<p>After a discussion with his family, he pondered and made a decision. When he returned to CMPB, he said he wanted to enlist. It turned out to be something he did not regret.</p>
<p>"I feel proud that I chose to serve," he said.</p>
<p>But there is more to this story than why CPL (NS) Tan decided to serve. There are parts about living with one arm, about making good friends and some not so good ones, and about persevering and emerging better for it.</p>
<p>CPL (NS) Tan does not remember much about how his condition came to be. He was three years old when he injured his arm. And the next thing he knew, it needed to be amputated to save his life.</p>
<p>"I had a deep wound and I got infected by a type of bacteria, which is – I can't pronounce that word, but I only know the first part, which is staph," he said.</p>
<p>It was a staph infection, caused by bacteria called staphylococcus. Most of the time, the bacteria either cause no problems or relatively minor skin infections.</p>
<p>"It was quite severe that my parents had to make this decision to amputate my arm," CPL (NS) Tan said.</p>
<p>Does he remember how he injured his arm?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, CPL (NS) Tan acknowledged that he had a "tough" time growing up.</p>
<p>"Because of my kind and cheerful personality, I was always taken advantage of and was a victim of bullying. It was difficult finding friends that were trustworthy for me to vent my feelings," he said.</p>
<p>In secondary school, he said his classmates ignored him, especially during "team events" like sports or group work. He recalls being called names, but he took it on the chin.</p>
<p>"It was not really a good experience for me," he added. "Because of that, I had a tough time growing up and developed an introverted personality."</p>
<p>He told his family a bit about his problems, but stopped short of revealing everything so they would not be worried, or worse still, angry.</p>
<p>"I was the youngest and they doted over me a lot," said CPL (NS) Tan, who has a brother and sister. "They just told me to ignore my classmates for four years and find better friends after I graduated from that school."</p>
<p>Outside of school, he did not let his disability consume him. He adapted to doing everyday things – like eating or wearing clothes – with one arm, simply by copying what his parents did.</p>
<p>He also did sports like basketball, and while he admitted it was better to have two hands while playing, he insisted it was "not that hard".</p>
<p>"I will just show them that even if I have one arm, I can do whatever you all do normally," he said, adding that some on the court were shocked by his ability. "That is part of my mindset."</p>
<p>When CPL (NS) Tan moved on to study business at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), he said he still came across people who were mean to him, although the situation was "not so severe".</p>
<p>His classmates were a good bunch, and he looked back fondly at how his was the "rowdiest" class. They had a lot of fun and created a ruckus during lessons, he recalled with a smile.</p>
<p>"I'm sure everyone went through that," he said. "I found great friends in ITE, and they just treated me normally. Even when I had some bad times, I would always tell them and they were always there for me."</p>
<p>For example, when he revealed to them his bad experiences growing up, they said those people did not deserve his friendship. These little chats helped him regain some of his self-confidence.</p>
<p>When he needed help with physical tasks like carrying heavy items, they would jump in without hesitation.</p>
<p>"They didn't want me to do it," he said. "I'm definitely grateful for me to be friends with them."</p>
<p>When CPL (NS) Tan was 17 and still in ITE, he received a letter instructing him to <a>go for the pre-enlistment medical screening</a>.</p>
<p>His sister said it would be better for him to go through NS, worried that he would feel left out when future peers spoke about this rite of passage. His dad had served NS too, so he thought about following in his father's footsteps.</p>
<p>When asked if it was an easy decision to turn down the exemption, CPL (NS) Tan said his family members had a "very good mouth". "They just kept talking until they persuaded me," he added, laughing.</p>
<p>After graduating from ITE, he decided to get a job but harboured ambitions of continuing his education.</p>
<p>He went on to work at the KOI bubble tea chain, as a cashier and in the kitchen helping to prepare drink toppings. His condition was not really a concern for his employer, he said, adding that he just could not cook the pearls or brew the tea.</p>
<p>After working at the chain for more than a year, he received his enlistment letter in September 2019 telling him to report to the Basic Military Training Centre on Pulau Tekong two months later.</p>
<p>He worried about whether he would be able to handle the physicality of training, despite being <a>assigned the lowest physical employment standard</a> of E9, which meant he was suitable only for combat service support and service vocations.</p>
<p>"He helped me fold it. I saw how he did it and I just followed it," CPL (NS) Tan said, adding that he just took longer to do it.</p>
<p>When he told his section mates that he could have been exempted from NS, they expressed disbelief, saying they would have done so if given the option.</p>
<p>"I just told them that I would just serve, it's nothing wrong," he said. "In two years, you could learn more skills and everything. They were surprised, but at the same time they were inspired."</p>
<p>CPL (NS) Tan said his commanders were "very happy" with his decision. His officer commanding and company sergeant major personally told him they were proud he still chose to serve the nation despite his condition.</p>
<h2>BIGGER RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
<p>After completing two months of basic military training, CPL (NS) Tan was posted to the Army Logistics Training Institute (ALTI) as an admin support assistant responsible for managing building safety and infrastructure.</p>
<p>He conducted checks and ensured facilities were in working condition. If they were not, he informed his superiors and initiated the process of engaging contractors for repairs.</p>
<p>This job exposed him to a number of challenges, including his command of English and the speed at which he replies to emails.</p>
<p>"I type slowly and I have to think about what to say, what to do and everything," he said.</p>
<p>His unit commanders, however, were extremely careful not to overexert him physically.</p>
<p>"They did not want me to carry even one plastic bag," he joked. "One of my superiors was very concerned about my safety. I had no choice but to comply with her instructions."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, his hard work did not go unrecognised. In June, he was awarded the ALTI Commander's Coin, given to servicemen who have performed well in their duties.</p>
<p>While CPL (NS) Tan said he was pleased about this, he felt shy talking about it as he believes his role was "not really that big".</p>
<p>To further add to the embarrassment, he woke up late on the day of the award ceremony, and had to sprint to the venue where "a lot of people" from various units were watching. Being presented the award by ALTI's commander flustered him too.</p>
<p>"During practice, it was fine," he said. "But on the actual day, it was like, 'I hope I don't mess up, I hope my hair is okay, I hope everything is okay.'"</p>
<p>CPL (NS) Tan was also awarded another Commander's Coin, this time by the larger Combat Service and Support Command, and his unit's outstanding soldier of the month for July.</p>
<p>"I think they recognise my hard work, so I feel proud winning those awards," he said. "But most of the time, I feel embarrassed."</p>
<h2>DEALING WITH PUBLICITY</h2>
<p>But the spotlight was not about to go away.</p>
<p>When the Pioneer article was published and shared on its Facebook page, it received more than 100 comments and 1,300 reactions, with many praising his determination to serve despite his condition.</p>
<p>Family friends complimented him, and when his story got more media attention, his friends started tagging him on social media. While he is proud that his story has touched the public, he is still getting used to the attention.</p>
<p>CPL (NS) Tan completed his full-time NS on Nov 12 and was declared operationally ready.</p>
<p>He has applied for a job with a logistics company, where he will also deal with contractors. His time in ALTI has taught him how to build relationships with colleagues and communicate professionally, he said.</p>
<p>He also agreed that the time he spent serving NS helped him better relate to the experiences of his peers. "Not saying that being exempted is a negative, but at the same time, it's different for them," he said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, CPL (NS) Tan has not given up his aim of getting a diploma and eventually a degree, hopefully to land a "dream job" in the hospitality industry. This will help him earn a stable income and support his family, he said.</p>
<p>There will be challenges ahead, but he said he would take these in stride, like in the story of how he got through school and then NS.</p>
<p>As for people who might have a similar physical condition and are going through some struggles, he advised them not to sweat over mistakes and accept compliments, something he is still working on as well.</p>
<p>"Just learn to be proud of who you are, just be positive, and the most important thing is to love yourself," he said.</p>
<p>"Because if you don't love yourself, it's difficult to be proud of who you are. It's better to speak for yourself than to bottle up your feelings."</p>

<h1> ‘A big game changer’: Desaru resorts hope possible sea VTL with Singapore will boost tourism </h1>
<div> <p>There has been no confirmation on whether a sea VTL will be launched. Both governments are still working out the details.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Amir Yusof </a> </div> </div>
<p>DESARU, Johor: Over the last three years, Desaru has undergone <a>a massive transformation</a>.</p>
<p>Once an ailing tourist destination which had seemingly lost its lustre, the seaside town in southeastern Johor now boasts premium luxury hotels, golf courses and a water theme park. </p>
<p>However, due to border closures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Desaru has been missing a key element which much of its rejuvenation was targeted at - visitors from Singapore. </p>
<p>The leaders outlined that both countries are keen to have “more open borders” even if the new Omicron coronavirus variant disrupts plans to expand the VTL between both countries. </p>
<p>Although there has been no confirmation if and when the sea VTL will be launched, hotel operators in Desaru who spoke to CNA expressed optimism that the possible opening of a new sea route will boost accessibility to the area. </p>
<p>The area hosts the Desaru Coast project, which encompasses Hard Rock Hotel, the Adventure Waterpark, as well as premium luxury seaside resorts The Westin, Anantara and OneOnly. </p>
<p>Mdm Roslina Arbak, managing director and chief executive officer for the Desaru Coast development, told CNA that the possible sea VTL between Singapore and Malaysia will be a “game changer” for the attractions. </p>
<p>Her team also manages the Desaru Coast Ferry Terminal, a newly constructed facility which is a proposed landing point for the sea VTL between Singapore and Desaru. </p>
<p>“We have now completed the construction of Desaru Coast Ferry Terminal and are currently at the preoperational stage. The Desaru Coast Ferry Terminal will be a game changer for us,” said Mdm Roslina. </p>
<p>Mdm Roslina outlined that the new ferry terminal will be able to accommodate 300 people at a time. It will also have facilities for travellers to clear immigration and for the Ministry of Health to conduct COVID-19 screening.</p>
<p>She told CNA that the ferry ride between Desaru Coast and Tanah Merah will take around 90 minutes. </p>
<p>Mdm Roslina acknowledged in a virtual media conference on Tuesday (Dec 7) that Desaru Coast “will have to wait” for both the governments of Singapore and Malaysia to work out the details before the sea VTL may be launched. </p>
<p>“We still have to observe certain applications and processes that both sides must be comfortable with before we can actually commence operations. I hope sooner than later of course because the product is ready,” she said. </p>
<p>“We do have target dates but I think the fact that the two governments are having a conversation on trying to work out the approval processes, that’s positive. I would not like to pre-empt the date of start of operations,” Mdm Roslina added. </p>
<p>"We hope to progressively expand the VTL scheme to more destinations in the region and to include sea transport," its spokesperson said. </p>
<h2>SEA VTL WILL BOOST CONNECTIVITY WITH SINGAPORE</h2>
<p>Lotus Desaru Resort and Spa, a 10-year-old attraction located adjacent to Desaru Coast, also expressed enthusiasm that the sea VTL and the new ferry terminal will boost hotel bookings for them. </p>
<p>Operations manager for the resort Aaron Daniel Alabastro told CNA that pre-COVID-19, a Singapore tourist would take around three hours to travel via road to reach the resort in Desaru. </p>
<p>He said this duration included time taken to sit through traffic congestion at the Causeway and a further one-hour drive from Johor Bahru via the Senai-Desaru highway. </p>
<p>“Yes, it (the sea VTL) will be a big game changer,” said Mr Alabastro. </p>
<p>“The Desaru Coast Ferry Terminal is a short taxi ride to our resort. It will be a proper gateway for our Singapore customers to Desaru,” he said. </p>
<p>“It will make Singapore and Desaru closer. Travellers can even consider short leisure trips without the need to drive long distances and stress over the jam at the Causeway,” added Mr Alabastro. </p>
<p>Besides leisure tourists, some hotels are also anticipating that the sea VTL will bring in more business visitors to the region.</p>
<p>Desaru is located around 40km from the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC), a project by Malaysia’s national oil company Petronas that could soon be fully operational. </p>
<p>PIC, which is spread across 2,550 ha and the result of a US$27 billion investment in partnership with Saudi Aramco, will house a new site of downstream oil operations.</p>
<p>Four Points by Sheraton Desaru, which was newly launched in November, told CNA that the sea VTL and new Desaru Coast Ferry Terminal will boost connectivity with Singapore. </p>
<p>According to the hotel’s general manager Maverick Loh, with the sea VTL, more corporate clients in the oil and gas industry in Singapore could use Desaru as a gateway for accessibility to the PIC. </p>
<p>He added that Four Points by Sheraton Desaru will operate shuttle buses between the premises and Desaru Coast via its sister property The Westin, so that tourists arriving at the ferry terminal can benefit. </p>
<p>“We are planning to provide drop-offs for corporate clients but subject to the demand from Petronas,” added Mr Loh. </p>
<h2>BUSINESS, LEISURE TRAVELLERS LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM SEA VTL </h2>
<p>A transport expert CNA spoke to agreed that the sea VTL will be a huge potential for businesses in Desaru as it cuts travel time from Singapore and could be more convenient for travellers. </p>
<p>Dr Rosli Azad Khan, transport planning expert from the Selangor-based MDS consultancy, said the VTL could bring in more corporate clients. </p>
<p>He noted that pre-COVID-19, there had been ferry services between Changi in Singapore to Tanjung Belungkor and Tanjung Pengelih ferry terminals in Pengerang which serviced workers in the oil and gas industry who are based in Singapore. </p>
<p>However, as there is no certainty to whether these services would resume, he predicted that the sea VTL with Desaru could be a viable option for these workers if and when it is launched. </p>
<p>“It’s possible that when the sea VTL is launched, workers might come in and buses pick them up to transport them to the operations sites in Pengerang,” said Dr Rosli. </p>
<p>However, he said that Malaysian commuters who used to travel from Johor to Singapore to work daily before the COVID-19 pandemic might not find the sea route attractive. </p>
<p>“The business case for the Desaru-Tanah Merah link for many travellers is poor.</p>
<p>“For the Malaysian daily commuter, who travels to Singapore for work, study or family reasons, this link is highly unlikely to be competitive compared to the land crossings,” said Assoc Prof Theseira.</p>
<p>He outlined that the ferry services are likely to cost more, and considering that Desaru is quite a distance away from Johor Bahru and other populated residential areas, the time taken to travel could be longer as compared to bus via the land VTL. </p>
<p>“I simply don't see how it would be attractive for most Malaysian travellers compared to the pre-COVID alternatives of public transport, personal private motorcycles and chartered buses,” he added. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Asia </a> </p> <h1> Hit hard by pandemic, 30-year-old Melaka eatery gets new lease of life with partnership and online sales </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>

<p>MELAKA: Patrons lining up along the five-foot way of the shophouses and waiting for their turns to be seated at Capitol Satay Celup used to be a familiar sight in downtown Melaka.</p>
<p>Weekends and public holidays were even busier for the restaurant, with the queue sometimes spanning eight or 10 shoplots along Lorong Bukit Cina. </p>
<p>However, all is quiet at the outlet now, since Capitol’s last day of business was on Nov 20.</p>
<p>Instead of hustling back and forth between the kitchen and the dining area, its employees have been busy packing and dismantling the equipment and furniture under the supervision of business owner Low Yong Cheng.</p>
<p>While “satay” denotes grilled, skewered meat served with peanut sauce, “celup” means dip in Malay. </p>
<p>Satay celup is similar to “luk luk”, with raw, skewered ingredients ranging from meat to seafood and vegetables cooked in stock.</p>
<p>But unlike traditional satay or luk luk, satay celup skewers are dipped into a boiling pot of spicy peanut sauce to cook before eating. </p>
<p>Capitol was one of the dozens of satay celup eateries well-liked by both locals and tourists in Melaka. </p>
<p>Mr Low, 64, who has been running the establishment for 30 years owner, decided to announce its closure in late September as he could no longer afford to pay the expenses after nearly two years of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns.</p>
<p>A farewell message posted on its Facebook page led to enquiries and proposals to take over the business, and he eventually identified one partner to work with.</p>
<p>Capitol Satay Celup will soon operate at a new location in Melaka town’s Kota Syahbandar under the new partner, he told CNA. Although there is no confirmed date yet, it is likely to take off in January next year.</p>
<p>“It is quite difficult, very painful to have to take down everything here when we have been operating here for so long. But what is there to do?” Mr Low said. </p>
<p>Mr Low is the third generation in his family to sell satay celup in one form or another. </p>
<p>“My father Low Han Tian modified the recipe, making it satay celup to go with the food skewers,” he added.</p>
<p>When his grandfather migrated to Malaysia, a stick of food was sold for between two and five cents of a Straits Dollar, and during his father’s time, the price had increased to between RM0.05 (US$0.01) and RM0.10. </p>
<p>His father took the business to another level, using a tricycle to carry the food and hot gravy in a sidecar. This allowed him to sell his satay celup all over Melaka town.</p>
<p>“In the morning, my father would cycle to the Portuguese Settlement from 9.30am, stay there for an hour or two, and by 11am, he’d be at the A’Famosa fortress until nearly 5.30pm.”</p>
<p>“After that, he would stop at the Savoy cinema until nearly midnight,” Mr Low recalled. </p>
<p>The name “Capitol Satay Celup”, he said, came from a now-defunct cinema, Capitol Theatre, located on Jalan Bendahara which was then known as Wolferstan Road.</p>
<p>TURNING THE STALL INTO A SHOP</p>
<p>Mr Low took over the business in 1985 and then decided to base Capitol Satay Celup in a restaurant in 1991.</p>
<p>There were plenty of challenges, such as manpower and heavy workload, as its popularity grew. </p>
<p>Workers had to spend eight hours preparing the food and skewering the ingredients before the restaurant opened for diners in the evening. </p>
<p>Customers, including tourists from other states and countries, would start queueing as early as the late afternoon to make sure they have a table. </p>
<p>In between serving the dinner crowd, Mr Low would treat customers with “prizes” such as tiger prawns and other more expensive food stuffs as a gesture of appreciation for dining at his establishment. </p>
<p>Capitol Satay Celup’s popularity was such that at one point, he even had to put up a sign on his shop entrance telling patrons not to be misled by other “imitators” and that the shop did not have branches elsewhere in the state. </p>
<p>“I am proud that we managed to last this long, and we had many celebrities who visited us too. We’ve even won tourism awards,” he said. </p>
<p>THE PANDEMIC AND MOVING FORWARD</p>
<p>Like most other food and beverage businesses, Capitol Satay Celup was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr Low said his shop was even more affected as satay celup is meant to be enjoyed in a group, with diners sitting around the pot and dipping their preferred skewers into the sauce as they chat away merrily.</p>
<p>“We could not do delivery or takeaway like other food businesses, otherwise how is it still satay celup?” he said. </p>
<p>Business fell by as much as 95 per cent during the lockdowns imposed in 2020 and 2021, he recounted. </p>
<p>Mr Low decided to try and sell pre-packed satay celup sauce online on Lazada and Shopee. It took weeks of experimenting and testing to ensure that the sauce tastes as good as a roiling pot in his Bukit Cina shop. </p>
<p>“We continued to experiment, not just with the ingredients’ portions, but also with the packaging,” he added.</p>
<p>While the recipe for the spicy sauce is jealously guarded, the shop’s online store listed dried spices, Chinese herbs, peanut, sugar, dried shrimps and salt as its ingredients. </p>
<p>Sales were slow initially, with just a few packets sold each day. But by June and July, the shop was selling between 500 and 1,000 packets a month. </p>
<p>“Currently we cap our production at 500 packets a month, both because of manpower and also to ensure quality control,” he explained. </p>
<p>Profits from the packed sauce sales went into paying the shop’s rent, utilities and workers’ salaries. But it was still difficult to sustain the restaurant’s expenses when interstate travel was restricted and people were trying to save on expenses.</p>
<p>Although he expected some feedback, the way the announcement went viral was out of his expectation. </p>
<p>In addition to messages and commiserations from shocked fans, Mr Low also received a number of offers for joint ventures or acquisitions. </p>
<p>He eventually identified a new partner to continue the business at a new location. Mr Low said he will no longer be the person-in-charge, but purely an advisor and the gravy producer. </p>
<p>“I have never thought about giving up my recipe, regardless of the price,” he said. </p>
<p>In the meantime, his online business will carry on, he added, and he will continue cooking at the new outlet in Kota Syahbandar. </p>
<p>“The online platforms and manufacturing for the satay sauce is still mine, and I fully own the brand of Capitol Satay Celup, so the brand still continues,” he said.</p>

<p>JAKARTA: Many Indonesian journalists were waiting for an online press conference by the National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB) to begin last week, but its Youtube channel showed a foreigner giving a live presentation on cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Puzzled by this, reporters sought an explanation from the agency’s spokesperson, only to be informed that BNPB’s Youtube channel has been hacked.</p>
<p>The incident was among 1.4 billion Internet traffic anomalies or cyberattacks in Indonesia this year, said Mr Anton Setiyawan, spokesman of the National Cyber and Crypto Agency (BSSN).</p>
<p>“Traffic anomalies are something we can technically classify as cyberattacks because they are something abnormal. Like scanning and sending malware, that is an attack," Mr Setiyawan explained to CNA on Thursday (Dec 16).</p>
<p>He noted that cyberattacks in Indonesia have significantly increased this year. The number of traffic anomalies stood at around 495 million in 2020.</p>
