<div><div><p>“It was cold,” he said in an interview around 10 a.m. Tuesday about his overnight experience being stranded on the interstate. “It was very cold.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Some people are running out of gas,” Kaine said Tuesday morning. “If you run out of gas, then what do you do as a family?”</p></div></div>
<p>Officials said later in the day that they hoped I-95 would be cleared and open again by Tuesday night and that they had been sending emergency crews to try to reach still-stranded motorists, while pledging a full investigation of what went wrong.</p>
<div><div><p>Kaine said he left Richmond at around 1 p.m. Monday for a pressing voting rights meeting later that day with other lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol, believing he had plenty of time. The commute typically took him two hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This time, it would take him nearly 27 hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With multiple senators absent,<b> </b>the Senate delayed roll call votes on Monday, and on Tuesday afternoon decided to delay votes again until Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<p>“The only nourishment I had — if you count it as nourishment — is two cups of coffee and a Dr Pepper,” Kaine said. “I’ll deal with hunger rather than eat a lot of food and have to worry about bathrooms.”</p>
<div><p><span>Schumer says Senate will vote by Jan. 17 on changing rules if GOP continues to block voting rights legislation</span></p></div>
<p>Overnight, as temperatures dipped below freezing, Kaine said he would turn the engine on for 10 minutes or so to heat up the car, then turn it off for an hour to conserve fuel. He tilted his head back and tried to sleep in the driver-side seat.</p>
<div><div><p>It didn’t work, at least not for long.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I would nap for 15 or 20 minutes — usually I’d wake up because I got too cold,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine accepted one and saved it for later. At 10 a.m., he said he was planning to peel it momentarily.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kaine said he talked to Northam mainly to ask what people were supposed to do if they ran out of gas or needed help. Kaine had been able to refuel in Fredericksburg but feared that others might be in more dire situations.</p></div></div>
<p>“That was one of the things I wanted to find out. How should we let people know if they need help?” He repeated the phone number that Northam and VDOT have been encouraging motorists to call if they’re in trouble: 1-800-FOR-ROAD.</p>
<div><div><p>He was then inching toward exit 136 near the Stafford airport, still waiting to hear the state’s outlook on the unfathomable traffic jam, trying to decide whether to get off the road.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ultimately, he found his way off the interstate onto Highway 1, which was also still clogged with cars.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At 3:45, he finally arrived on Capitol grounds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t always have a feeling of joy when I see the Capitol,” Kaine told reporters upon arriving, “but I did today.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“I think it does make it harder for the Republicans to essentially define wedge issues around military and foreign policy against Luria, because she’s just not given them much space,” Kidd said.</p></div></div>
<p>Luria served 20 years in the Navy as a nuclear engineer on deployed ships before winning a seat in Congress in 2018, becoming one of several Democratic women with national security backgrounds to flip red seats blue and help take the House.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Hannah Natanson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 11, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><div><div>correction</div><p>A previous version of this story misstated the source of Gov. Ralph Northam's proposed $2.4 billion boost to education funding. It would come from general funds, not coronavirus relief funds.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his final weeks as governor of Virginia, Ralph Northam (D) has proposed increasing teacher salaries by 10 percent over the next two years — but it is far from clear if the raise will come to pass.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This should really be a nonpartisan issue,” Northam said. “It’s about the future of our children: We want to make sure every child has equal opportunity for a world-class education.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Republican Glenn Youngkin seeks teacher raises, ban on ‘critical race theory’ in plan for Virginia K-12 schools</p></div>
<div><div><p>Asked whether Youngkin would support a 10 percent teacher raise, spokesman Macaulay Porter sent a transcript of an interview the incoming governor <a>gave to TV news outlet WLNI this week</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our Day One Game Plan ... absolutely includes increases in salaries for teachers and for law enforcement,” Youngkin told WLNI. “I deeply appreciate Governor Northam including it in his plans.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Northam’s budget would add $2.4 billion in state funding for prekindergarten through 12th grade over the next two years — a figure that includes the 10 percent raise. </p></div></div>
<div><p>The average Virginia teacher salary clocks in at slightly less than $55,000 a year, according to the National Education Association, the country’s biggest teacher union — while the national average is about $65,000 a year.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In the fading days of the Northam administration, some teachers’ groups are hailing the proposal as a godsend.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, was less optimistic.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added, “It’s at least possible that this is a Democratic strategy to make a new Republican governor who ran on education a little bit uncomfortable.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Parental say in schools, resonant in Va. governor’s race, bound for GOP national playbook</p></div>
<div><div><p>That has to stop, Northam said — and now is the perfect time.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“ ‘Why now’ is because our economy over the last four years has done extremely well,” he said. “We have a record surplus of $2.6 billion, it’s the highest Virginia has ever had.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Youngkin will inherit a Virginia government stuffed with cash, but what he can do with it remains uncertain</p></div>
<div><div><p>The state’s coffers are brimming. In addition to the $2.6 billion this year, surpluses could amount to more than $3.5 billion above projections for each of the next two years, <a>per state estimates</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fedderman said this potential snag — not Youngkin’s upcoming inheritance of the governorship — is his biggest worry.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Whatever the local match is, that may not be able to happen, and that could put the overall raise in jeopardy,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spokespeople for two of Virginia’s largest districts, Fairfax County Public Schools and Loudoun County Public Schools, did not respond to requests for comment on Northam’s proposed raise.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Northam said he does not think county governments and school boards will struggle to match state boosts to teacher pay.</p></div></div>
<a>received more than $26 billion in federal stimulus and coronavirus relief money</a> — and officials can expect hundreds of millions more from the Biden administration’s infrastructure package.
<div><div><p>“We simply do not know what the status of covid is going to be two weeks from now,” he said. “Elected officials struggle to plan very far ahead.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kimberly Adams, president of the Fairfax Education Association, which represents about 4,000 school employees in Virginia’s largest school district, said she is closely tracking the fate of Northam’s raise proposal.</p></div></div>
<a>fears of school shootings</a> to culture wars that have spilled into education,
<a>costing some teachers their jobs</a>. She said the future of teaching in her home state may hang on whether Northam’s promised raise materializes.

<div><div><p>Laurel Wise has always considered herself a political independent, though she usually backed Democratic candidates. But this year, with Glenn Youngkin on the ballot, she was ready to try something new.</p></div></div>
<p>“It was an end-of-the-campaign switch that I made,” Wise said. “I never thought I’d vote for Youngkin, and then really liked what he started saying about the economy and education, and getting rid of mandates.”</p>
<p>In the final weeks of the race, Youngkin won White women by solidifying his image as a<a> relatable suburban dad</a>, anchoring his platformon <a>education issues</a> and walking a fine line in his connection to former president Donald Trump.</p>

<div><div><h3><div>Returning to the party</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>In politics, it’s understood that there’s a “gender gap” in which women vote in favor of Democratic candidates over their male counterparts. But that gap, political scientists say, is driven by women of color.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Why have we been unable to see the elephant in the room?” she<b> </b>said. “The elephant in the room is a Republican voter. And she’s White and female.”</p></div></div>
<p>“With a candidate who wasn’t nearly as Trumpian at the top of the ballot, it made some Republicans more comfortable returning,” said Kathleen Dolan, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.</p>
<div><div><p>“After Trump, these moderates needed to see it was okay to vote Republican again,” Tribbett said. “They needed to know it was okay to come home.”</p></div></div>
<a> And Democrats acknowledged</a> that relying on tying Republican candidates to Trump would not be successful in 2022.
<div><div><h3><div>Educational divides</div></h3></div></div>
<a>shrinking McAuliffe’s margins</a> in cities, suburbs and exurbs that Biden had carried last year, Youngkin also massively turned out voters in rural parts of the state and overwhelmingly attracted White women without college degrees.
<div><p>The educational divide among White women was one of the most striking takeaways of the Virginia race for political analysts, who noted that it matches a larger trend of division between those with college degrees and those without.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Youngkin’s victory among White women was fueled by 74 percent of those without college degrees who voted for him vs. 61 percent of White women with college degrees who voted for McAuliffe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Julie Bowling, who lives in Amherst County, said she used to think of herself as a Democrat, supporting climate issues and social services, but this year felt like she’d started losing touch with the party.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Living in a region of Virginia she called the Bible Belt, the 55-year-old said Youngkin’s education stance — especially on transgender bathrooms — pushed her to vote Republican.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Democrats are swinging so far out of what I believe,” Bowling said.</p></div></div>
<a>“Southern strategy'' </a>of employing White people’s racial fears in political campaigns.
<div><div><p>Wrighten said that even in feminist movements, White women have historically worked toward their own progress — initiatives and policies that would help White women, but not necessarily always benefit women overall.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“White women have always had the privilege of being White,” she said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Hit by tornado, Arkansas nursing home aides shielded residents from falling debris with their bodies</h1></div>
<h2>As a tornado ran right through the facility, nurses and residents prayed and sang hymns, hoping to survive.</h2>

<div><div><p>MONETTE, Ark. — Barbara Richards made a horrifying discovery as she looked out the glass door of the Monette Manor nursing home Friday night.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A tornado was heading straight for her.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I could see the rotation outside before it got to us,” Richards, 57, said in an interview.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There wasn’t anything left to do.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Then it hit and blew the glass out of the windows in the facility,” Richards said. “You could see the rotation inside the building.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Monette nursing home was hit by the same series of tornadoes that struck six states Friday night, wreaking havoc across Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky. The twisters left at least 50 people dead and leveled entire towns.</p></div></div>
<p>In this corner of Arkansas, a tornado struck the nursing home — which housed 67 elderly residents — and killed one man in his 80s. But the death toll could have been worse if Richards and others hadn’t been so quick to act.</p>
<div><div><p>In the center of the storm, Richards grabbed onto the residents in their wheelchairs beside her and hauled her body on top of them, shielding them from the worst of the debris. She noticed her fellow nurses do the same.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the wind ripped pillows out of the seniors’ hands, they sobbed. One attendant was whacked in the head with debris. Richards told them all to sing hymns and start praying.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They sang “all different ones, whatever ones they could think of — anything to get them thinking about something else,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So they did, one song after another, as the tornado ripped through the residency, demolishing the roof and the walls, breaking the sprinkler system and causing water to soak the frail 80-, 90- and 100-year old residents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the wind died down, as the debris settled and the walls stopped crumbling, Richards extricated herself from the residents and placed a call on her phone for help.</p></div></div>
<div><p>How Friday night’s rare and deadly December tornado outbreak unfolded</p></div>
<div><div><p>Then he got a call from the local fire chief, whose truck had been battered by the tornado, leaving him stranded. Nance rushed over to pick him up. In doing so, they saw the tornado’s path.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I said ‘Chief, this is going right toward the nursing home,’ ” Nance said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nance’s grandmother and his wife’s grandmother were inside.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s the last grandmother I’ve got, and the last one she’s got, too,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The pair rushed to the scene.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And then they heard people from inside the building, Hall said, “screaming for help.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Outside, much of the building’s roof was gone, having collapsed into the halls and rooms. Water from the fire suppression system was pouring out, flooding the building.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Curiously, one of the only parts left untouched was a large wreath, still intact, hanging on the wall outside.</p></div></div>
<div><p>After a candle factory collapsed in the tornado, family and first responders mount a desperate rescue effort</p></div>
<div><div><p>“He had a blank stare on his face — super calm, but like he knew what had just happened,” the 24-year-old said. “It was kind of — I don’t know. It was heartbreaking.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In one wrecked room, he said he found an elderly woman pinned down under cinder blocks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Her entire roof was gone. I remember looking up and seeing nothing but lightning and trees,” Hall said. “And the only thing she could say is, ‘Please help me I can’t find my glasses.’ ”</p></div>
<div><div><p>She kept repeating it to him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I remember wiping her face off because she had dirt on her face and I remember telling her I’d get her out of there,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hall recalled entering a different room to find another heart-stopping scene:</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It looked like multiple wheelchairs were stacked on top of each other, but there were people in those wheelchairs. And on top of that, the cinder block wall started to cave in on a couple of those residents,” he said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He worked quickly to extract each of the residents from the tower of wheelchairs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rescuers pulled chairs from the wreckage and lined them up around running cars, propping the rescued residents on them to keep them warm. It was night time, the wind was fierce and it was raining.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The residents shivered, in shock, as more of their neighbors were rescued from the home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This could have been my grandparents,” Peake said. “We did everything we could to comfort them.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nance did find his grandma, untouched except for dust hurting her eyes. His wife’s grandmother survived, too.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But not everyone made it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Peake recalled helping pull out one man from the rubble. He was wearing pajamas and off-red socks. He brought the man to the open air and stepped away for the EMTs to do their work.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When I came back he had the sheet over his face. And that’s when I realized,” Peake said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He was dead.</p></div></div>
<div><p>See the damage caused by the deadly quad tornadoes</p></div>
<div><div><p>As the sun set Saturday night, shooting orange streaks were in the clouds above the broken nursing home, and all was quiet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nearby, a steel granary tower looked like aluminum foil, crumpled and tossed on the flatlands of Arkansas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kevin Stewart, the skilled nursing facility’s administrator, walked through the remains to retrieve a few items for the evacuated residents.</p></div></div>
<p>“We’ve got a good community,” he said in front of what used to be the building’s lobby. The home had been a place where volunteers — including local high school students — would come to help entertain residents.</p>
<div><div><p>As he looked about the wreckage, he contemplated rebuilding the cherished home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s going to take some time but that will be the plan,” Stewart said. “It’s going to be a while but I think it’s possible.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ovetta Wiggins</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Erin Cox</div></span></div></span></div><div>November 10, 2021 at 10:30 a.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Maryland’s redistricting commission drafted a new map with the potential to oust the state’s lone Republican member of Congress, one of four proposed redistricting plans that shuffle some voters ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.</p>
<div><p>Karl S. Aro, the chairman of the seven-member commission composed of top legislative leaders, said the proposed maps are a “starting point” and the result of testimony during the commission’s nine public hearings.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“The message has been consistent — Marylanders think their representation can be improved with more compact and easily followed districts,” Aro said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b/>With Democrats clinging to slim majorities in Congress, power brokers across the country are watching how Maryland and other states recast their maps and whether those revisions will tip the scales in Washington.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The commission, empowered by the state’s General Assembly leaders to draft options, released the maps for public comment in advance of the legislature’s Dec. 6 special session to pick a plan.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Aro said that, “to the extent practicable,” the commission tried to keep Maryland residents in their existing districts. He said “no map is perfect” and asked the public to weigh in on the options proposed.</p></div>
<div><div><p>A spokesman for Harris did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re happy. … We thought it might be just one map,” she said. “Giving the public and advocates different options to weigh in on is helpful.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said advocacy groups will offer feedback in the remaining three public hearings that the commission has scheduled over the next week, including a statewide virtual hearing Monday evening.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maryland is not among the states that have directed mapmakers to draw compact districts or avoid favoring a political party. The General Assembly has the final say on which plan takes effect.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Since then, some Maryland state lawmakers from both parties have sought to strip the legislature of the exclusive power to draw the electoral maps.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Redistricting battles kick off early as Democrats scramble to try to cut into GOP advantages</p></div>
<div><div><p>State Senate Minority Whip Justin D. Ready (R-Carroll) on Tuesday blasted Democrats for even considering a map that could edge out Republicans.</p></div></div>
<p>“An 8-0 map would be a complete outrage and unjustifiable by any objective measure,” Ready tweeted. “[Seven to one] is really unjustifiable when you look at the (yes, blue, but not 7-1 statewide) makeup of Maryland.”</p>

<div><div><p>People 12 and older will be required to show proof of coronavirus vaccination to enter many businesses in D.C., including restaurants, starting in mid-January under rules that Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) announced Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The change comes two days after Bowser announced a host of new restrictions to curb record-setting numbers of daily coronavirus cases that have made D.C.'s new daily case rate higher than that of any state in the nation this week.</p></div>
<b> </b>forthcoming vaccine requirement for government workers without a test-out option, and introducing at-home rapid antigen tests for residents, Bowser will now require thousands of businesses to check that patrons are vaccinated.

<div><div><p>“There’s great logic for doing this in conjunction with the District,” Elrich said. “We should have done it. Now I hope we can do it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The District’s mandate will cover businesses including restaurants, bars, nightclubs, theaters and gyms, Bowser said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She said she hopes the impending mandate will persuade D.C. residents to get vaccinated now, before they are shut out of their favorite restaurants and entertainment venues.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>The District’s Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration issued dozens of citations and fines this past year to establishments that serve alcohol and flouted rules around mask-wearing indoors.
<div><p><span>Dining while infectious is on the rise. Meet D.C.’s restaurant safety enforcers.</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Bajaj noted that since vaccinated people can also become infected and spread the virus, he’s not even sure that an all-vaccinated restaurant will necessarily be a coronavirus-free space.</p></div></div>
<p>But she noted more optimistically that it may help restaurants overcome one of their biggest difficulties aside from supply chain problems. It’s what she calls “diner confidence,” which has affected demand at some restaurants.</p>
<div><div><p>The mandate, she said, “may be something that will help with that, as it creates these environments where diners feel more comfortable, staff feel more comfortable.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Elrich said that as he weighs a similar mandate in Montgomery, he has heard from restaurant owners worried that the vaccination checks would require them to hire more staff or provoke confrontations with would-be diners.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added: “Maybe not being able to do things like going to a restaurant will finally get through to some people that if they want a normal life like the rest of us would, they should be vaccinated.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Earl Stoddard, Montgomery County’s head of emergency management, said the county would provide guidance or training to reassure business owners worried about liability if a customer presents a fraudulent vaccination card.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maryland reported 4,072 new cases on Wednesday and Virginia, 5,972 new cases. Fifty deaths in the region were reported Wednesday, all of them in Virginia.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The jail, already beset by complaints about conditions, implemented sweeping restrictions to slow the spread. The new rules allow inmates just two hours of out-of-cell time per day, reduced from 5½ hours.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The department has also faced scrutiny for pandemic-related confinement measures that locked people in their cells for 23 hours a day for more than a year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Neither Bowser’s office nor Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) responded to requests for comment on the jail outbreak.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>James Reid, 82, followed her into the library after hearing about the free tests on the news. “Anytime a disease is spreading like this you need to be able to test at home for it,” he said.</p></div></div>
<p>Bowser also said she plans to sign legislation that the D.C. Council passed Tuesday that will require coronavirus vaccination for children in public schools next school year. “This adds to the safety of our schools,” Bowser said.</p>

<div><div><p>New York City was America’s first coronavirus epicenter. Then rural communities became the hub, the virus jumping from one region to another as months passed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The D.C. area was generally low on the U.S. list of most-covid-burdened places — partly because of high levels of mask-wearing and social distancing, and partly through just plain luck.</p></div></div>
<div><div>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</div></div>
<div><div><p>Until the omicron variant came along.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Suddenly, the District is one of the country’s worst coronavirus hot spots, with a significantly higher rate of cases per capita than any state, and a sharper increase in hospitalizations, too.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The city’s leaders are flummoxed by the turn of events. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) was plain-spoken this week about the reasons behind the rise: “I don’t know.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some hypothesized that the lack of a mask mandate in the city for a month — particularly at a time when the new variant was beginning to take hold — allowed the virus’s spread to accelerate.</p></div></div>
<div><p>They were so careful, for so long. They got covid anyway.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Neil Sehgal, another University of Maryland public health professor, said he also thinks Bowser’s decision to end the mask mandate was a factor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re presently in a perfect storm,” said David Marcozzi, a professor and physician who is leading the covid-19 response for the University of Maryland Medical System.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>The vaccine gap between Black and White Americans narrowed. But it’s back for booster shots.</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>None of the factors, individually, may have pushed hospitals to declare the need for crisis levels of care, but together they’ve caused intense strain, Atlas said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some local officials wonder whether residents let their guard down because the region is so highly vaccinated.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“We’re seeing case rates soar and we’ve got the most people vaccinated than we’ve ever had,” Dzirasa said. “I think for some people, this raises the question of ‘Why [get the shot]?' ”</p></div>
<div><p>Public health officials in communities with lower vaccination rates may soon be confronting the same question. “I worry that DC isn’t an anomaly, but simply a few weeks ahead of the rest of the U.S.,” Sehgal wrote.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Milton said the region’s time as a covid hot spot might not last long.</p></div></div>

<a>highly transmissible</a> omicron variant — which has now been detected throughout the region — is of particular concern.

<div><div><p>In Maryland, where there has been a blackout for the past two weeks because of a cyberattack, data was released Monday that gave the first glimpse of the spread of the virus in the state.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Bajaj noted that since vaccinated people can also become infected and spread the virus, he’s not even sure that an all-vaccinated restaurant will necessarily be a coronavirus-free space.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The mandate, she said, “may be something that will help with that, as it creates these environments where diners feel more comfortable, staff feel more comfortable.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Elrich said that as he weighs a similar mandate in Montgomery, he has heard from restaurant owners worried that the vaccination checks would require them to hire more staff or provoke confrontations with would-be diners.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added: “Maybe not being able to do things like going to a restaurant will finally get through to some people that if they want a normal life like the rest of us would, they should be vaccinated.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Hogan said “enough is enough” and promised to fast-track grant applications to install lighting, security systems and cameras at community centers, and in business districts and churches.</p></div></div>

<p>“The reality is, no matter what actions we take, Baltimore City will never get control of the violence if they don’t arrest more, prosecute more and sentence more to get the most violent criminals off the streets,” he said.</p>

<div><p>Maryland lawmakers convened Monday in Annapolis for the messy, once-a-decade process of rejiggering the state’s congressional district boundaries, weighing how much the state should redraw its notoriously gerrymandered map.</p></div>
<b> </b>that have been likened to blood spatter, a “
<a>broken-winged pterodactyl</a>” and, on Monday, a “

<p>But Republicans argued that Democrats’ preferred alternative — drawn by the Maryland Legislative Redistricting Advisory Commission — is still just as gerrymandered and has made only limited progress toward more compact districts.</p>

<div><div><p>Early Monday, advocates for paid family leave gathered at Lawyer’s Mall outside the State House with coffee and muffins, hoping for a moment to persuade lawmakers to take up that policy during the 2022 session.</p></div></div>
<p>Republican Senate leaders acknowledged Monday that Democrats’ supermajorities in both chambers essentially meant that the other party could “do anything they want, because they don’t need the minority’s voice.”</p>
<div><p>When it comes to redistricting, Sen. Bryan W. Simonaire (R-Anne Arundel) expected that “at the end of the day, the majority party is going to ram through their gerrymandered map, and I think that really hurts the people.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) asked Luedtke if he would describe the districts as compact and contiguous. But Luedtke declined to answer the question and referred him back to his testimony.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If Democrats pass the legislative map clearly advantaging Democrats, Morse said, “you’ll make clear that you’re committed to democratic ideals so long as they further your political goals.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Compared to a decade ago, the legislature’s redistricting process offered far more opportunities for the public to review its work and offer comments, but some told lawmakers they need to do better.</p></div></div>
<p>“People are disengaged because they know their input will receive very little consideration,” she said, adding Common Cause couldn’t support either map. “We take no position today because the outcome is preordained.”</p>
<div><div><p>Hogan vowed to veto any maps he deems “unfair,” though the Democrats have enough votes to override him.</p></div></div>

<p>Advocates of the legislative action described it as one of the most significant pieces of immigration reform to pass in Maryland since the enactment of the Dream Act, a 2012 state law that provides in-state tuition grants to undocumented immigrants.</p>
<a> redistricting</a>, also overturned the Republican governor’s veto of a measure that bans the Motor Vehicle Administration from sharing personal information, including facial recognition data, with immigration officials.
<div><div><p>In the Maryland Senate, where Republicans mounted an unsuccessful effort Tuesday to preserve private-run immigration detention centers in the name of public safety, Democrats pushed back.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“This law is good for social media,” Hough said, “but in terms of the law, this is good for no one.”</p></div></div>

<p>Earlier this year, several immigrants and their families shared their stories with legislators, including Nora Lorena Argueta, an immigrant from El Salvador who lived in the United States for 18 years before being deported. She testified virtually.</p>

<div><div><p>After later being stopped by a state trooper, Argueta was detained for 10 months and later deported.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Del. Haven N. Shoemaker Jr. (R-Carroll) said the legislation prohibiting for-profit federal detention centers in Maryland was “sanctuary-state legislation. … Let’s just call it what it is.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Gov. Larry Hogan, who is fully vaccinated and received a booster, tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Hogan said he received a positive rapid test as part of his regular testing routine and was “feeling fine at the moment.” A more reliable polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test confirmed the earlier result late Monday.</p></div>
<p>Hogan’s positive test came as the state for the first time in more than two weeks — due to a cyberattack on the state Department of Health’s network system — reported information on its caseload, testing and positivity rate.</p>
<div><div><p>According to the latest data, Maryland is experiencing a stark rise in cases and the community spread of the coronavirus is at the highest level since May 2020. Hospitalizations are surging.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Beth Blauer, the executive director of the Centers for Civic Impact at Johns Hopkins University, said the lack of case rate and testing data has had “significant implications” on public health amid the holiday season.</p></div>
