<p>Outsiders are deeply suspicious of China’s moves to increase state control over its economic development, such as imposing new regulations on tech companies and capital markets.</p>
<p>This shift likely would have happened even if Sino-American relations had not deteriorated as they have, owing to China’s enormous population.</p>
<p>But, amid the retreat from globalisation, China’s advantage may be even greater.</p>
<p>Because long-run growth is driven by improvements in technology, this translates into a major economic advantage for countries with larger populations.</p>
<p>This outcome highlights just how self-defeating America’s turn inward is: It’s clear that America’s success is thanks to migration and globalisation.</p>
<p>To be sure, China is facing strong demographic headwinds: Its birth rate dropped to a record low in 2020.</p>
<p>But the effects of this decline will take a few decades to have an impact. China’s demographics today give the country a significant advantage over the US in terms of human capital for at least the next 20 years.</p>
<p>Projections of China’s future growth suggest that if China makes the most of this advantage – as it seems poised to do – the US will find it all but impossible to hamper China’s economic progress.</p>
<p>Rather than thwarting China’s ambitions, America’s policies will encourage China to continue hedging its bets, including by rethinking its national-security strategy and shifting more resources to its science and technology sectors.</p>
<h2>THE FUTURE GLOBAL ECONOMY</h2>
<p>In the worst decoupling scenario, the world’s two largest economies will end up dominating their own technology-supply systems, each with its own rules and standards.</p>
<p>This is a distinct possibility. But visionary politicians should appreciate how much more could be achieved on both sides if the countries instead worked together. The US would be far better served by seizing the opportunities China’s rise creates.</p>
<p>And an open and decentralised economic system that encourages market-led activity is far more conducive to the iterative process vital to the commercialisation of innovation.</p>

<h1> Commentary: How are investors still falling for cryptocurrency scams? </h1>
<div> <p>One scam cryptocurrency founder defrauded investors billions by convincing others that their nonexistent cryptocurrency was real, Nir Kshetri at University of North Carolina-Greensboro points out.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Nir Kshetri </a> </div> </div>
<p>GREENSBORO, North Carolina: Millions of cryptocurrency investors have been scammed out of massive sums of real money. </p>
<p>From researching blockchain, cryptocurrency and cybercrime, I can see that some cryptocurrency fraudsters rely on tried-and-true Ponzi schemes that use income from new participants to pay out returns to earlier investors.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Blockchain has been a lie all this while, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>Others use highly automatised and sophisticated processes, including automated software that interacts with Telegram, an internet-based instant-messaging system popular among people interested in cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Even when a cryptocurrency plan is legitimate, fraudsters can still manipulate its price in the marketplace.</p>
<p>An even more basic question arises, though: How are unsuspecting investors attracted to cryptocurrency frauds in the first place?</p>
<p>During that time, the newcomers often use social media to share their own referral codes with friends and contacts, bringing more people into the group chat and into the investment scheme. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Even with blockchain and cryptocurrency, trust still needed, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>Some members work especially hard to bring in new funds, posting tutorial videos and pictures of themselves holding large amounts of money as enticements to join the scam.</p>
<p>Some scammers go for straight-up deception. The founders of scam cryptocurrency OneCoin <a>defrauded investors</a> of US$3.8 billion by convincing people their nonexistent cryptocurrency was real.</p>
<p>Global Trading used a bot on Telegram, too – investors could send a balance inquiry message and get a response with false information about how much was in their account, sometimes even seeing balances climb by 1 per cent in an hour. </p>
<p>With returns looking like that, who could blame people for sharing the scheme with their friends and family on social media?</p>
<p>EXPLOITING FRIENDS AND FAMILY</p>
<p>Once a scheme has started, it stays alive – at least for a while – through social media. One person gets taken in by the promise of big returns on cryptocurrency investments and spreads the word to friends and family members.</p>
<h3><a>READ: The beginning of the end of cryptocurrencies and the rise of one alternative, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes big names get involved. For instance, the kingpin behind GainBitcoin and other alleged scams in India convinced a number of Bollywood celebrities to promote his book Cryptocurrency For Beginners. </p>
<p>He even tried to make himself a bit of a celebrity, proclaiming himself a “cryptocurrency guru,” as he led efforts that cost investors between US$769 million and US$2 billion.</p>
<p>FRAUDULENT INITIAL COIN OFFERINGS</p>
<h3><a>READ: Deciphering the cryptic world of Initial Coin Offerings, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>Many initial coin offerings have turned out to be scams, with organisers engaging in cunning plots, even renting fake offices and creating fancy-looking marketing materials. </p>
<p>In 2017, a lot of hype and media coverage about cryptocurrencies fed a huge wave of initial coin offering fraud. In 2018, about 1,000 initial coin offering efforts collapsed, costing backers at least US$100 million. </p>
<p>Many of these projects had no original ideas – more than 15 per cent of them had copied ideas from other cryptocurrency efforts, or even plagiarised supporting documentation.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Cryptocurrency land has become an unregulated casino </h1>
<div> <p>Some of the biggest crypto players may be openly involved in illegal activities, says New York University’s Nouriel Roubini.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Nouriel Roubini </a> </div> </div>
<p>NEW YORK: There is a good reason why every civilised country in the world tightly regulates its financial system. </p>
<p>Because these laws and regulations protect investors and society, the compliance costs associated with them are reasonable and appropriate.</p>
<p>BUT WHAT ABOUT CRYPTOCURRENCIES?</p>
<p>But the current regulatory regime does not capture all financial activity. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are routinely launched and traded outside the domain of official financial oversight, where avoidance of compliance costs is advertised as a source of efficiency.</p>
<p>The result is that crypto land has become an unregulated casino, where unchecked criminality runs riot.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Are we ready for the next major financial crisis? A commentary</a></h3>
<p>This is not mere conjecture. Some of the biggest crypto players may be openly involved in systematic illegality.</p>
<p>To be clear, with 100-to-one leverage, even a 1 per cent change in the price of the underlying assets could trigger a margin call and wipe out all of one’s investment. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Behind the cryptocurrency mania, the secret sauce is Bitcoin’s blockchain technology, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>It is little wonder that, according to one independent researcher’s estimates, liquidations at times account for up to half of BitMEX’s revenue.</p>
<p>As if that were not enough, BitMEX also has an internal for-profit trading desk (supposedly for the purpose of market making) that has been accused of front running its own clients. </p>
<p>Hayes has denied this, but because BitMEX is totally unregulated, there are no independent audits of its accounts, and thus no way of knowing what happens behind the scenes.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Blockchain has been a lie all this while, a commentary</a></h3>
<p>This lack of due diligence constitutes a brazen violation of securities laws and regulations. Hayes even openly challenged anyone to try to sue him in the unregulated Seychelles, knowing he operates in the shadow of laws and regulations.</p>
<p>A SHOWDOWN WITH ARTHUR HAYES</p>
<p>Earlier this month, I debated Hayes in Taipei and called out his racket. But, unbeknownst to me, he had secured exclusive rights to the video of the event from the conference organisers, and refused for a week to release it in full.</p>
<p>Instead, he published cherry-picked “highlights” to create the impression that he performed well. </p>
<p>I suppose this is par for the course among crypto scammers, but it is ironic that someone who claims to represent the “resistance” against censorship has become the father of all censors now that his con has been exposed. </p>
<p>Finally, shamed in public by his own supporters, he relented and released the video.</p>
<p>On the same day we debated, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority proposed an outright ban on retail high-risk crypto investments. </p>
<p>Yet, barring a concerted response by policymakers, retail investors who are lured into the crypto domain will continue to be suckered.</p>
<h3><a>READ: How are investors still falling for cryptocurrency scams? A commentary</a></h3>
<p>Price manipulation is rampant across all the crypto exchanges, owing to pump-and-dump schemes, wash trading, spoofing, front running, and other forms of manipulation. </p>
<p>According to one study, up to 95 per cent of all transactions in Bitcoin are fake, indicating that fraud is not the exception but the rule.</p>
<p>Of course, it is no surprise that an unregulated market would become the playground of con artists, criminals, and snake-oil salesmen. </p>
<p>Behind it all is an emerging criminal racket that would put the Cosa Nostra to shame.</p>
<p>TIME FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT TO STEP IN</p>
<p>It is high time that US and other law-enforcement agencies stepped in. So far, regulators have been asleep at the wheel as the crypto cancer has metastasised.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Bitcoin is now legal tender in one country. Regrets may soon follow </h1>
<div> <p>We should reflect on why many people around the world are willing to embrace cryptocurrencies for non-speculative purposes, says Professor Paola Subacchi.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Paola Subacchi </a> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: Many regard the market for Bitcoin – the world’s leading cryptocurrency – as a game of winners and losers played out among hedge funds, amateur investors, geeks and criminals.</p>
<p>The huge risk inherent in a highly volatile anonymous digital currency is best left to those who understand the game well, or who don’t really care because they can mitigate the risk or absorb any losses.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin recently has become more attractive for countries and individuals with limited access to conventional payment systems – that is, those least equipped to manage the underlying risk.</p>
<p>NOT THE FIRST MONEY EXPERIMENT BUT BIG RISKS REMAIN</p>
<p>Salvadorans are not new to this type of monetary experiment. The US dollar became legal tender in El Salvador in 2001 and is the currency used in domestic transactions.</p>
<p>At that time, the government of President Francisco Flores allowed the dollar to circulate freely alongside the national currency, the colón, at a fixed exchange rate.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Elon Musk wakes up to bitcoin’s environmental impact </a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Maybe Elon Musk should stop tweeting about Tesla</a></h3>
<p>But purchasing power suddenly plummeted and left the economy even more dependent on remittances, which have averaged about 20 per cent of GDP per year over the past two decades.</p>
<p>Using Bitcoin as legal tender will exacerbate the monetary constraints that dollarisation revealed – notably, the lack of an independent macroeconomic-institutional framework around which to shape domestic policies.</p>
<p>Moreover, Bitcoin is much more volatile than the dollar. Between Jun 8 to 15. its value swung between US$32,462 and US$40,993, and in the period from May 15 to Jun 15, it ranged from US$34,259 to US$49,304.</p>
<p>Such wide fluctuations – and the fact that they are entirely market-driven, with no scope for policymakers to manage the swings – make Bitcoin an unsuitable instrument for macroeconomic stabilization.</p>
<p>THE UPSIDE: REDUCING REMITTANCE COSTS</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, the average global cost of sending US$200 internationally is approximately US$13, or 6.5 per cent, well above the Sustainable Development Goal target of 3 per cent.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Dogecoin and why we should quit taking cryptocurrency seriously</a></h3>
<p>Reducing the fees to 2 per cent could increase remittances by as much as US$16 billion per year.</p>
<p>The large but globally fragmented remittance business relies on electronic transfers via commercial banks’ payment systems, and banks charge hefty fees for the use of this infrastructure and the benefit of a safe and reliable international network.</p>
<p>But high fees are not the only issue. Many migrants don’t have a bank account in the country where they work, and their families back home may also be among the 1.7 billion unbanked people worldwide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some migrants may need to transfer money to countries that either are not integrated into the international payment system or are restricted in their ability to receive cross-border transfers – for example, Syria or Cuba.</p>
<p>Bukele is right about the need to challenge this system, including by providing low-cost and low-risk alternatives. But Bitcoin is the wrong tool.</p>
<p>Yes, it allows people to transfer value directly and globally, without the costly third-party intermediation. But its volatility makes it at best an asset – and an extremely risky store of value – rather than a means of exchange.</p>
<p>The risk of a sudden drop in its price means that migrants and their families back home can never be sure about the amount transferred.</p>
<p>Rather than dismiss El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption as just another example of the crypto craze, we should reflect on why many people around the world are willing to embrace cryptocurrencies for non-speculative purposes.</p>
<p>Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that the current international financial system serves them either poorly or not at all.</p>
<p>Innovations in digital money, such as the M-Pesa mobile money service in Africa, have made significant inroads into many developing countries’ payment systems.</p>
<p>But more needs to be done to provide the infrastructure and regulatory frameworks to support digital money. For now, the terrain remains patchy.</p>
<p>Coordinated cross-border policies are urgently needed to ensure that Bitcoin and its variants don’t do more harm than good in developing countries.</p>
<p>Paola Subacchi, Professor of International Economics at the University of London’s Queen Mary Global Policy Institute, is the author, most recently of The Cost of Free Money.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Foxconn India iPhone plant extends closure, workers' hostels inspected: Source </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>CHENNAI: A Foxconn iPhone factory in India at the centre of a mass food-poisoning incident will extend a week-long closure by an extra three days, a senior official for the state of Tamil Nadu told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last week, protests erupted after more than 250 women who work at the plant and live in one of the hostels had to be treated for food poisoning. Some of the protestors were rounded up by the police but later released.</p>
<p>The incident has thrown a spotlight on living conditions for the workers - most of them women - who reside in hostels near the factory which is located in the southern city of Chennai.</p>
<p>According to a separate government source, Foxconn has told state bureaucrats it had "ramped up production too quickly" and would gradually ensure that workers' facilities were upgraded before they go back to full capacity.</p>
<p>Representatives for Foxconn and Apple were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The gates of the factory, which is on the outskirts of the southern city of Chennai, were open on Monday morning and some vehicles were moving in and out but the area was mostly deserted.</p>
<p>The disruption comes as Apple is dealing with pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks that have hit production. In October, the company warned that the impact of these supply chain problems would worsen during the holiday quarter.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Will Bitcoin become mainstream currency in Singapore one day? </h1>
<div> <p>Despite its increased use and popularity in Singapore, Bitcoin has several characteristics that make it unsuitable for use as a transactional currency, say Hannah Yee-Fen Lim and Boh Wai Fong from NTU.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Hannah Yee-Fen Lim </a> <a> Boh Wai Fong </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: We see increasing interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the price of Bitcoin rallied and crashed, showing an almost ten-fold increase in price over a one-year period. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is to date the highest valued or most expensive cryptocurrency in the world having grown by 276 per cent in the last year alone, well ahead of others such as Ether used on the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>BITCOIN AS A TRANSACTIONAL CURRENCY</p>
<p>Bitcoin, however, has several characteristics that make it unsuitable for use as a transactional currency. </p>
<p>The volatility of Bitcoin suggests that both consumers and merchants bear exchange-rate risk, which arises from the need to change fiat currency to Bitcoin. </p>
<p>For instance, in 2010 we saw the first ever commercial transaction using Bitcoin to purchase a pair of pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins – what is said to equate to about US$40 then would cost almost US$400 million today. </p>
<p>The inefficiency of blockchain with transactions taking hours, even days, to be confirmed, and the use of proof of work in Bitcoin mining also results in excessive electricity use, leading to sustainability issues.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Bitcoin is now legal tender in one country. Regrets may soon follow</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Don’t trust the hype – Bitcoin will never be a wise investment</a></h3>
<p>In this regard, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has required cryptocurrency firms to make clear and appropriate disclosures to their customers, including merchants, so that all customers are aware of the risks. </p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are not legal tender, nor are they securities. Instead, they are considered goods, just like collectors’ cards which people can buy from vending machines or shops. And as a good, they can be used as a medium of exchange.</p>
<p>BITCOIN AS AN INVESTMENT INSTRUMENT</p>
<p>The prices of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile and are often speculative in nature. This is not surprising given that factually and scientifically, cryptocurrencies are nothing more than bytes of data sitting on computers in networks. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Elon Musk wakes up to bitcoin’s environmental impact</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Maybe Elon Musk should stop tweeting about Tesla</a></h3>
<p>The massive quick increases in value are attractive to those hoping to make fast profits – investors are always hopeful that they can buy at the trough and sell at the peak, especially since the rise and fall cycles occur frequently and rapidly. </p>
<p>The ability of cryptocurrencies to be moved or used quickly, relatively anonymously and the cross-border nature of such transactions means that they are ideal mechanisms for money laundering. </p>
<p>In Singapore, entities offering the trading of cryptocurrencies are regulated as digital payment token service providers under the Payment Services Act and need to be licensed. </p>
<p>Similarly, entities that deal in cryptocurrencies or facilitate the transmission of cryptocurrencies or provide custodian wallet services also need to be licensed and comply with all the requirements. </p>
<p>Although the regulatory intent is to address money laundering and terrorism financing risks, the requirements on the entities are fairly substantial, which may in turn disincentivise firms from offering the services widely. </p>
<p>For example, prior to any transaction, rigorous customer due diligence is required, coupled with constant and continuous monitoring. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Cryptocurrency is powering the underground economy of vice and crime</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Dogecoin and why we should quit taking cryptocurrency seriously</a></h3>
<p>Further, the MAS has now been equipped with the powers to impose additional measures on cryptocurrency firms as needed in a swift manner. All of these will be dampeners for providers and investors of cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Overall, we believe that Bitcoin is unlikely to become mainstream as a transactional currency. Cryptocurrencies that can become a currency supporting transactions should be stable and efficient – attributes that are not associated with Bitcoin. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Why is Bitcoin appealing to many despite the risks and uncertainties? </h1>
<div> <p>Is Bitcoin worth investing in? And will it really confer gains on people now that it’s reached new highs? MIT economist Daron Acemoglu unpacks its upsides and risks.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Daron Acemoglu </a> </div> </div>
<p>CAMBRIDGE: With the price of Bitcoin <a>reaching new highs</a>, and El Salvador and Cuba deciding to <a>accept it as legal tender</a>, cryptocurrencies are here to stay.</p>
<p>What implications will this have for money and politics?</p>
<p>Money depends on trust. It is accepted in exchange for goods and services only because people can confidently assume that others will accept it in the future.</p>
<p>This is as true for the US dollar as it is for gold. To argue that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are merely a confidence game – or a speculative bubble, as many economists have emphasised – is to ignore their popularity.</p>
<p>And yet, cryptocurrencies lack the stable institutional foundations needed to bolster the public’s trust in them. Trust thus ebbs and flows, making them fragile and volatile, as Bitcoin’s wild gyrations have amply demonstrated.</p>
<p>Moreover, with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that rely on “proof-of-work” mechanisms, transactions must be continuously verified and logged in a decentralised ledger (in this instance based on blockchain).</p>
<p>This requires millions of computers to operate continuously to update and verify transactions – work that is incentivised by the opportunity to be rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>A DESIRE TO GET RICH QUICK USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
<p>The narrative of massive returns for amateur and retail investors from a cryptocurrency is in keeping with our technology-obsessed age. We are constantly being told that technological ingenuity is creating a brighter future.</p>
<h2>BITCOIN CONFERS POTENTIALLY GREATER PURCHASING POWERS – ON CRIMINALS TOO</h2>
<p>The prospect of gaining seigniorage is very attractive, and probably helps to explain why there are now more than 1,600 listed cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>In the case of Bitcoin, the absence of a centralised authority means that seigniorage is distributed, thus providing an incentive for mining efforts (which are now being conducted by more than a million people around the world).</p>
<p>A dedicated source of demand can help a new currency establish a reliable footing. For cryptocurrencies in general, and for Bitcoin in particular, this anchor is planted firmly in the criminal world.</p>
<p>In its early days, demand for Bitcoin was boosted by dark-web sites such as Silk Road, which enabled all sorts of illicit transactions. To this day, criminal activities account for almost half of Bitcoin transactions, by some estimates.</p>
<h2>WILL BITCOIN LIBERATE PEOPLE FROM ECONOMIC ILLS?</h2>
<p>Each of these four factors has boosted Bitcoin artificially. Obviously, society’s economic ills will not be solved by people making money from Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Nor has the prevailing techno-optimist mood been borne out in the real world. And whatever benefits there are from distributing seigniorage via mining, they are more than offset by the massive waste of energy.</p>
<p>That leaves the political argument for Bitcoin. Will it liberate us from undue state power over the economy? Not really.</p>
<p>But Bitcoin is not the answer. It appeals to a puerile libertarian ideology in which a lone genius battles an overweening state to liberate individual excellence.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a> <article> </article> </a> </div> <div> <div> <div> <h6> <a> One month on, El Salvador's bitcoin use grows but headaches persist </a> </h6> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Yet the vision itself is pure fantasy. The risk of Western governments producing runaway inflation or undermining the international monetary system is vanishingly small.</p>
<p>The real existential threat today lies in political polarisation, the unraveling of democracy, and democratic political systems’ inability to keep economic elites and authoritarian politicians in check.</p>
<p>A new currency will not solve these problems. What is needed are measures to ensure that politicians, bureaucrats, and Silicon Valley and Wall Street tycoons act responsibly.</p>
<p>This requires democratic participation and active civic engagement. Gimmicks like Bitcoin are a distraction from the real work that must be done.</p>

<h1> Explainer: Binance, the giant crypto exchange under regulatory scrutiny </h1>
<div> <p>Britain's financial watchdog has barred major cryptocurrency exchange Binance from carrying out regulated activities, the latest in a string of moves against the platform by authorities across the world.</p> </div>
<p>LONDON: Britain's financial watchdog has barred major cryptocurrency exchange Binance from carrying out regulated activities, the latest in a string of moves against the platform by authorities across the world.</p>
<p>Here are answers to some key questions on Binance, one of the world's biggest exchanges, and what the latest regulatory moves mean.</p>
<p>Trading volumes in June were US$662 billion, up almost ten-fold from July 2020, according to data from CryptoCompare. On a single day in May, daily volumes hit US$92 billion, U.S. researcher Coin Metrics said.</p>
<p>Headed by Canadian Changpeng Zhao, Binance offers a wide range of services to users across the globe, from crypto spot and derivatives trading to tokenised versions of stocks.</p>
<p>It also runs an exchange that allows users to trade directly with each other. Its own cryptocurrency, Binance Coin, is the fourth-biggest in the world.</p>
<p>Binance is growing in popularity in Britain, where its app has been downloaded 1.8 million times in 2021, and 2.2 million times in total, according to mobile data firm Sensor Tower.</p>
<p>Binance has built up a huge following across the world, with channels on the Telegram social media app for users in more than 30 countries.</p>
<p>AND IT'S COMING UNDER SCRUTINY FROM REGULATORS?</p>
<p>Yes - in Britain and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said last week Binance's UK arm cannot conduct any regulated activity, without saying why it took the action.</p>
<p>Crypto trading is generally unregulated in Britain, though some activities such as offering crypto derivatives do require permission.</p>
<p>Regulators including the FCA are increasingly worried over the standard of anti-money laundering checks at crypto exchanges and the risks crypto trading poses to consumers.</p>
<p>Yet national regulators often struggle to rein in crypto exchanges based elsewhere, lawyers said.</p>
<p>"It's very difficult," said Simon Treacy, senior lawyer at Linklaters. "(The FCA) don't have jurisdiction over the whole of Binance's operations, so they use the point where they do have jurisdiction and put pressure on the business there."</p>
<p>The Binance spokesperson said it takes its compliance obligations very seriously and is committed to following all regulatory requirements wherever it operates.</p>
<p>HOW WILL THE UK MOVE IMPACT BINANCE?</p>
<p>Its influence may be limited.</p>
<p>Beyond a loud warning to investors, the FCA has done all it can under its limited powers over an offshore exchange, experts say.</p>
<p>"At the moment the method is to emphasise risks to investors in the UK of these services rather than to regulate them outright," said Barney Reynolds, a lawyer at Shearman Sterling.</p>
<p>UK investors can still access Binance via its main website, which the FCA does not have powers over.</p>
<p>Still, the FCA's demand that Binance seeks its permission to offer regulated services means it would be an offence to suggest to investors it was regulated in the UK.</p>
<p>Binance will also have to rethink plans announced last year to offer crypto trading services using pounds and euros on a platform regulated by the UK.</p>
<p>Google said this week it would only allow FCA-authorised entities to run ads for UK-based financial products on its website, after repeated FCA calls to crack down on online fraud.</p>
<p>Concern at banks over investment scams and fraud involving crypto exchanges may also impact Binance. Britain's Natwest Group last week capped the daily amount customers can send to exchanges, including Binance.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Crypto exchange Binance tightens money-laundering checks as regulatory pressure mounts </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>FRANKFURT :Cryptocurrency exchange Binance said on Friday it would demand stricter background checks on customers to bolster efforts against money laundering, with immediate effect, a move that comes after weeks of pressure by regulators globally.</p>
<p>Binance, the world's biggest crypto platform, has faced warnings and business curbs from financial watchdogs from Britain and Germany to Japan, who are concerned over the use of crypto in money laundering and risks to consumers.</p>
<p>The exchange, whose holding company is registered in the Cayman Islands, has scaled back its product offerings and said it wants to improve relations with regulators. </p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde were among those this year to voice concerns over crypto money laundering, with other regulators growing concerned with Binance in particular. </p>
<p>The Dutch central bank on Monday said the platform, which processed spot trades worth US$455 million in July, was not in compliance with its anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws.</p>
<p>Binance users will have to complete a verification process to access its products and services, it said on its website. Those who have not done so will only be able to withdraw funds, cancel orders and close positions. </p>
<p>The move represents a major shift by Binance. </p>
<p>Until now, it only asked for ID checks for users seeking higher limits on trading. Now, users must provide an ID card, driver's licence or passport, it said. </p>
<p>Standards vary across exchanges. Many large platforms, including Coinbase Global Inc and Gemini, also require users to submit ID documents, yet Kraken, another U.S. exchange, only requires personal information for limited access to trades.</p>
<p>Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, a Canadian known by his nickname "CZ," said in a tweet linking to the Binance announcement https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1428614958846148609 that "actions speak louder than words".</p>
<p>"We aim to work more collaboratively with policy-makers to improve global standards and discourage bad actors," he added in a separate statement.</p>
<p>Binance said this week it had appointed a former U.S. Treasury criminal investigator as its global money laundering reporting officer.</p>
<p>Still, some lawyers were sceptical over whether Friday's move to tighten checks would placate regulators. </p>
<p>Financial watchdogs would need to know which of Binance’s local entities run the know-your-customer process to audit and check if it complies with local laws, said Alireza Siadat, partner at law firm Annerton in Frankfurt. </p>
<p>"It is a nice marketing statement, but from the regulators' perspective, this is not enough," he said. </p>
<p>"Since they are doing it on a voluntarily basis, regulators do not know whether they have the authority to supervise the identity check, and no one can look whether they are doing it properly."</p>
<p>Binance's corporate structure is opaque though its holding company is registered in the Cayman Islands, according to British court documents and Malaysia's securities watchdog.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Dogecoin and why we should quit taking cryptocurrency seriously </h1>
<div> <p>The success of the joke currency has lessons for cryptocurrency investors and business analysts, says the Financial Times' Jemima Kelly.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jemima Kelly </a> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: It has often been hard to make sense of financial markets in 2021.</p>
<p>First there was the 1,500 per cent rally in flailing video game retailer GameStop, then there was the US$100 million valuation of a New Jersey deli, and then there was a 15,000 per cent surge in dogecoin, a cryptocurrency designed as a joke.</p>
<p>“Do you want Tesla to accept Doge?” the electric car company’s chief executive and self-styled “technoking” Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers on Tuesday (May 11).</p>
<p>The tweet was just the latest of several Musk shout-outs to the digital coin, which is based on a meme showing the face of a Shiba Inu dog overlaid with an imaginary inner monologue: “Wow”; “so scare”; “keep ur hands away from me”.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Is Dogecoin the next investment craze after GameStop?</a></h3>
<p>Dogecoin functions the same way as bitcoin — it’s a digital token underpinned by a decentralised network of computers that process and keep track of transactions via a digital ledger called a blockchain.</p>
<p>But unlike the original cryptocurrency, whose backers use highbrow arguments to justify and shore up its value, dogecoin has been a joke from the outset.</p>
<p>Yet while few people are claiming that dogecoin will “democratise finance”, or become “the global reserve currency”, or fundamentally change the world, since its creation in December 2013 it has hugely outperformed bitcoin.</p>
<p>While the latter has climbed a remarkable 7,700 per cent during that period, dogecoin has rocketed by an almost unfathomable 200,000 per cent.</p>
<p>In other words, if you wanted to make some money on crypto over the past seven-and-a-half years and chose to buy bitcoin rather than dogecoin, the joke’s sort of on you.</p>
<p>HOW TO TREAT CRYPTO SERIOUSLY?</p>
<p>Dogecoin gives the lie to the idea that we should take bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies terribly seriously. </p>
<p>Much like a pyramid scheme, those who got in early on bitcoin have a huge financial incentive to draw in others by any means necessary.</p>
<p>But while getting rich is clearly the main motivating factor — and some people have indeed managed to become incredibly rich from crypto — it is not the only one.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Amid record high value, Tesla's bitcoin bet raises uncomfortable questions</a></h3>
<p>Buying into crypto should be considered akin to gambling and, like gambling, people get into it not just because they might make money, but also because it’s entertaining.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that cryptocurrencies and “meme-stocks” have surged in a year in which much of the world has been locked up indoors.</p>
<p>It is the result of what Bloomberg columnist Matt Levine has called the “boredom markets hypothesis”.</p>
<p>Crypto trading is often more accessible than gambling, particularly in places where betting is heavily regulated, such as in the US. It allows buyers to feel like they’re in some kind of tribe.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Elon Musk gambles big on bitcoin to keep Tesla going strong</a></h3>
<p>MAYBE TAKE IT LESS SERIOUSLY</p>
<p>The joke-coin makes a mockery of the idea that crypto investing should be considered a serious pursuit. Its very existence undermines the notion that bitcoin derives value from its scarcity.</p>
<p>But perhaps it can also allow us to stop taking the crypto project quite so seriously. While we’re at it, we might do the same with the stock market.</p>
<p>If none of what happened with GameStop made sense to you, listen to financial veterans break down how different players powered the surge and which listed company could see copycat attacks in CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:</p>

<p>Although prominent cryptocurrency advocates are politically connected and have democratised their base, regulators cannot sit on their hands forever.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Don’t trust the hype – Bitcoin will never be a wise investment</a></h3>
<p>The view that cryptocurrencies are just an innocent store of value is stupefyingly naive. Sure, their transaction costs can be significant enough to deter most ordinary retail trade.</p>
<p>Although Bitcoin and its crypto variants have by no means surpassed the dollar in facilitating the global underground economy, they are certainly on the rise.</p>
<p>As even top US financial firms seek to offer crypto options to their clients, one might well ask what people are investing in.</p>

<p>SO WHY IS THE PRICE OF BITCOIN SOARING?</p>
<p>If governments will ultimately have to increase dramatically their regulation of crypto transactions, why have cryptocurrency prices in general, and the price of Bitcoin in particular, soared (albeit with headline-grabbing volatility)?</p>
<p>Part of the answer, as economic theory tells us, is that with interest rates at zero, there can be massive and sustained bubbles in intrinsically worthless assets.</p>
<p>Moreover, crypto investors sometimes argue that the sector has become so big, and attracted so many institutional investors, that politicians will never dare regulate it.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Dogecoin and why we should quit taking cryptocurrency seriously</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps they are right. The longer it takes for regulators to act, the harder it will be to get private digital coins under control.</p>
<p>The Chinese and South Korean governments recently started cracking down on cryptocurrencies aggressively, although it is not yet clear how determined they will be.</p>
<p>DIFFICULTY IN REGULATING IS WHAT MAKES IT ATTRACTIVE</p>
<p>In fact, that is one argument for why a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin might justify its lofty value of about US$37,000 at the end of May (although its price changes like the weather).</p>
<p>After all, we do not have to expect a company to be in business forever – think fossil fuels – for it to have significant value today.</p>
<p>Of course, there will always be a market for cryptocurrencies in war-torn countries or pariah states, although their valuations would be much lower if coins could not be laundered into rich countries.</p>
<p>And perhaps there are technologies for stripping away anonymity and thereby removing the main objection to cryptocurrencies, though one suspects that would also undercut their main selling point.</p>

<p>No one is arguing against the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies and has vast potential to improve our lives, for example, by providing a trusted tamper-proof network for monitoring carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p>And although operating the Bitcoin system itself requires enormous energy consumption, there are now more environmentally friendly technologies, including those based on “proof of stake”.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Elon Musk wakes up to bitcoin’s environmental impact</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately for those who have invested their life savings in cryptocurrencies, ransomware attacks that target growing numbers of firms and individuals could prove to be the turning point when regulators finally develop some backbone and step in.</p>
<p>Many of us know people whose small, struggling companies have been decimated by such extortion.</p>
<p>While governments may have better cryptocurrency-tracking tools than they let on, they are in an arms race with those who have found an ideal vehicle for making crime pay. Regulators need to wake up before it’s too late.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Cryptocurrencies could become viable asset class for investors </h1>
<div> <p>Cryptocurrencies have reached a new stage of development after blockchain applications have gained traction, says Yale University’s Aleh Tsyvinski.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Aleh Tsyvinski </a> </div> </div>
<p>NEW HAVEN, Connecticut: Regulators around the world are cracking down on cryptocurrencies. <a>China has banned them</a>. The United States is considering <a>a range of measures</a> aimed at reining them in.</p>
<p>The Bank of England is developing capital requirements for financial institutions that hold them.</p>
<p>But, far from spelling disaster for the crypto industry, regulation is vital to its long-term prospects.</p>
<h2>THE BIRTH OF “REVOLUTIONARY” BLOCKCHAIN</h2>
<p>The crypto market’s development began with what can best be described as the “product innovation” stage.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology enabled people to approach old questions (What is money? How can art be created and valued?) in new ways. This resulted in highly visible applications, such as virtual currencies and tokenised artworks.</p>
<p>But it also enabled less glamorous innovations in a wide range of areas, from tracking container shipments to improving the integrity of healthcare records.</p>
<p>Will smart phones prove to be as important as electricity? Will e-commerce be as transformative as steam power? Can the internet’s impact compare to that of radio and the telegraph?</p>
<h2>CRYPTO IS BECOMING AN ASSET</h2>
<p>Now, cryptocurrency is entering the next phase of its evolution: Becoming an investable asset. To be sure, cryptocurrencies are already an asset, with a market capitalisation of around $2 trillion.</p>
<p>But it is a market marred by fraud, scandals, insider trading, pump-and-dump schemes, and other shady or illegal activities.</p>
<p>This is the case even for the “safest” cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, which are supposed to be backed by hard currency.</p>
<p>With regulations porous or nonexistent, the private money was prone to wild price fluctuations and panics.</p>
<h4> <div>If none of what happened with GameStop made sense to you, listen to financial veterans break down how different players powered the surge and which listed company could see copycat attacks in CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:</div> </h4>
<h2>INVESTORS NEED MORE CERTAINTY TO INVEST IN CRYPTO WITH CONFIDENCE</h2>
<p>Key players in the traditional finance sector – such as the SP Dow Jones, with its Digital Market Indices portfolio – provide an important methodological benchmark for constructing such data and ensuring its credibility.</p>
<p>Second, we need research that facilitates a deeper understanding of cryptocurrencies as an asset class.</p>
<p>Academic research has underpinned the creation of a number of new asset classes, such as derivatives and index funds, not to mention investment approaches like factor investing. Now, important progress is being made on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>REGULATION CAN HELP CRYTPO COME OF AGE</h2>
<p>The third condition is a credible regulatory framework. As it stands, such a framework remains nascent, not least because regulating cryptocurrencies presents significant challenges.</p>
<p>Some are conceptual and require the development of new theories, or the modification of existing ones, in accounting and law.</p>
<p>Others are practical: For example, while the records of all transactions are public, the identities of the parties executing the trades are difficult or impossible to ascertain.</p>
<p>And virtually all of these considerations are global, meaning that regulators in most major countries (at least) will need to coordinate their oversight efforts without stifling innovation.</p>
<p>Once these challenges are overcome, and an effective regulatory framework is put in place, cryptocurrencies will come of age.</p>
<p>The attention-grabbing, experimentation-heavy teen years will be followed by the establishment of a more predictable version of the crypto market in which cryptocurrencies represent a credible asset class.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Crypto exchange Binance.sg to close by February after operator withdraws Singapore licence application </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Binance Asia Services, the operator of Binance.sg, has withdrawn its application to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to operate a regulated cryptocurrency exchange in the country.</p>
<p>The decision was made "taking into account strategic, commercial and developmental considerations globally", Binance said in a news release on Monday (Dec 13).</p>
<p>With immediate effect, registrations, cryptocurrency and currency deposits and trading on Binance.sg will be closed, it said.</p>
<p>Binance.sg will wind down operations and close by Feb 13 next year. Users of the platform must close all open positions and withdraw their Singapore dollar and cryptocurrency assets by that date, it added.</p>
<p>MAS said Binance Asia Services has provided a plan for orderly cessation of its regulated payment services.</p>
<p>"This will allow sufficient time for customers to seek alternative providers or, if they wish to, liquidate their holdings," a MAS spokesperson said in response to CNA's queries. </p>
<p>MAS noted that its approach to regulation seeks to "facilitate innovation while ensuring that adequate controls are in place to address key risks such as money laundering and terrorism financing".</p>
<p>"Applicants are able to withdraw their applications should they see fit, upon which those who are operating under exemption will be required to cease providing regulated payment services," it added.</p>
<p>The regulator had in September ordered Binance - a separate entity that operates another cryptocurrency exchange Binance.com - to <a>stop providing payment services</a> to users in Singapore.</p>
<p>It said then that Binance Asia Services' licence application to operate Binance.sg was under review.</p>
<p>Binance said at the time that MAS' order had "no direct impact" on Binance.sg services.</p>
<p>Founded by Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur Changpeng Zhao, Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world by volume.</p>
<p>The company said it will refocus its Binance Asia Services operations in Singapore into a blockchain innovation hub to help develop the global blockchain ecosystem.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Personal data of about 30,000 e2i clients potentially exposed after malware attack on vendor’s employee </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Personal data of about 30,000 people who have used e2i’s services may have been exposed after a malware attack on the mailbox of an employee at a third-party vendor.</p>
<p>E2i (Employment and Employability Institute) is the job and training arm of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC).</p>
<p>In a media statement on Monday (Apr 5), e2i said the data incident was brought to its attention on Mar 12.</p>
<p>“The incident may have resulted in an unauthorised access to the affected mailbox that contained personal data of approximately 30,000 individuals who had used e2i’s services,” it said.</p>
<p>“The potentially affected personal data may include names, NRIC, contact details, educational qualifications and employment details.”</p>
<h3><a>READ: Singtel third-party vendor hacked, customer information 'may have been compromised'</a></h3>
<p>E2i said it has taken time to make an impact assessment due to the complexity of investigations, adding that the third-party vendor is i-vic International.</p>
<p>“We have worked with the utmost urgency with the vendor to ascertain the nature and extent of personal data that has been potentially affected,” it added.</p>
<p>“Together with the vendor, we have followed up immediately with mitigation measures to tighten the security of email and network systems and will be doing constant checks to monitor closely for any potential vulnerabilities.”</p>

<p>E2i said it is reaching out to those who may have been potentially affected via email, SMS or phone to provide support on how best to manage any potential risks.</p>
<p>“We are deeply sorry for the anxiety this data incident may bring to our clients. The protection of our clients’ personal data is of utmost importance to us," said CEO of e2i Gilbert Tan.</p>
<p>"Though the malware did not target e2i directly, cybersecurity threats are real and the protection of personal data is of top priority to us.</p>
<p>“e2i will be doing constant checks on both e2i’s as well as our vendor’s IT systems.”</p>
<p>Mr Tan added that e2i’s operations, services and systems remain unaffected. Job seekers can continue to seek employment and employability assistance with e2i.</p>
