<h1> Why You Shouldn't Start the New Year With a Diet </h1>
<h2> Scrap "dieting" from your list of resolutions once and for all. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What are healthy approaches to dieting? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Diets are a popular way to start the New Year, but they usually don't work.</li>
<li>Dieting isn't consistently linked to better health, whether it be physical or mental.</li>
<li>Health can be achieved at a variety of different sizes and doesn't necessitate weight loss.</li>
<li>Dieting can contribute to disordered eating and eating disorders.</li>

<p>It’s the New Year and with that comes—you guessed it—resolutions. Nothing seems to top the “New Year, new me” priority list quite like going on a diet to lose weight.</p>
<p>So before you start repeating the same old thing, here’s why to make 2022 the start of a new relationship with food and eating.</p>
<h3>Diets Don’t Work</h3>
<p>There, I said it. Diets do not work. Maybe you’ve seen this firsthand for yourself, but research also tells a similar story.</p>
<h3>Even If You Change For a Little While, Diets Are Not Sustainable</h3>
<p>Why is it that diets set people up to fail? A number of biological, environmental, and behavioural mechanisms have been proposed.</p>
<h3>Dieting Doesn’t Inherently Make You Healthier</h3>
<p>Regardless of whether or not diets work from a weight-loss standpoint, it also begs the question: Does living in a smaller body actually make you healthier? You might be surprised to learn that it may not.</p>
<h3>Diets Can Contribute to Disordered Eating and Eating Disorders</h3>
<a>dieting</a> to disordered eating. Following a cohort of adolescents over 10 years into adulthood, Loth et al. (2014) found that weight concerns and weight importance were linked to the higher levels of disordered eating at follow-up.

<h1> How to Ditch Food Guilt and Feast in Peace </h1>
<h2> Don’t let diet culture steal your joy this holiday season. </h2>
<li>The holidays often involve special foods, creating stress for those who struggle with eating or body image concerns.</li>
<li>Rejecting diet culture can help people feel calmer around holiday meals and support loved ones to enjoy their food without shame.</li>
<li>Challenge the idea that you have to earn a holiday meal or make up for it after punishing exercise or restrictive diets.</li>
<li>Set boundaries around diet talk, and remember that food is supposed to bring joy and pleasure.</li>
<a>stress</a>. For those who have struggled with an eating disorder,
<a>disordered eating</a>, or a history of chronic
<a>dieting</a>, focusing on holiday meals can add an extra layer of difficulty.
<p>Diet culture refers to the mainstream belief system that instills stereotypes and biases about weight, health, and food. Diet culture harms all of us, but it’s especially harmful to individuals in larger bodies.</p>
<p>Like other aspects of culture, we often absorb these messages at the <a>subconscious</a> level. By identifying how it commonly shows up, you can make sure diet culture has no place at your holiday table this year.</p>
<h3>Reject the idea that you have to earn food.</h3>
<a>shame</a> about our eating. Those negative feelings make it harder to recognize whether we’re hungry or full and whether we feel satisfied by what we just ate.
<p>Trust that if you give yourself full permission to enjoy whatever foods appeal to you at each meal. Eventually, you will crave something different.</p>
<h3>Eat and move as you normally would in the days before and after the holidays.</h3>
<h3>Set boundaries around diet talk.</h3>

<p>When a loved one says something negative about the food or weight, try setting a kind but firm boundary. For example:</p>
<p>A comment is made about how much someone is eating.</p>
<ul><li>Boundary: "We’re each eating what our own unique bodies want and need."</li> </ul>
<p>A comment is made about the calories (or carbs, sugar, etc.)</p>
<ul><li>Boundary: "Let’s focus on how delicious this food tastes."</li> </ul>
<p>A comment is made about “good” or “bad” food.</p>
<ul><li>Boundary: "I don’t believe food has moral value. It’s not like that casserole robbed a bank!"</li> </ul>
<p>A comment is made about someone’s weight.</p>
<ul><li>Boundary: "Let’s not talk about people’s body size."</li> </ul>
<h3>Focus on the whole sensory experience of the meal.</h3>
<p>As you’re eating, take in each of these sensory elements. How does the food look? How does it smell? How does it taste? Does the first bite land differently than the bite you take in the middle of the meal?</p>
<p>If there’s anything we’ve learned from the last two years, it’s that life is fleeting. Don’t let diet culture rob you of this moment.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>Parenting a Child with an Eating Disorder</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<li> How can I tell if my child has an eating disorder? </li>
<h2> How can I tell if my child has an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>Recognizing that your child has an eating disorder can be painful and scary, but confronting the disorder is the first step toward recovery. Here are some of the <a>signs that your child may be struggling with an eating disorder.</a></p>
<p>Signs related to physical health include rapid weight loss or weight gain, exhaustion, dizziness, fainting, stomach problems, damaged teeth, thinning hair, and feeling cold.</p>
<p> Signs related to mental health include becoming fixated on weight or body image, feeling stressed, anxious, or shameful about eating, and struggling with low self-esteem, isolation, and depression.</p>
<h2> How can I prevent my child from developing an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>Nothing can definitively prevent an eating disorder—those forces are sometimes out of a parent’s control. But cultivating a <a>positive, accepting atmosphere around body image</a> can help your child thrive. </p>
<p>Additionally, parents can strive to develop an open, communicative relationship so that if their child encounters challenges such as bullying or anxiety, parents can listen and address those challenges together in a healthy way.</p>
<h2> Do parents cause eating disorders? </h2>
<h2> How early can an eating disorder start? </h2>
<p>Children as young as <a>5-years</a> can develop an eating disorder. In fact, research suggests that <a>anorexia is emerging at a younger age</a> and that the condition has increased among children between 8 and 12 years old over the past decade.</p>
<p>Still, the <a>median age</a> when anorexia and bulimia develop is 18 and the median age when binge-eating disorder develops is 21, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<h2> How should I prepare for a conversation about my child’s eating disorder? </h2>
<p>Before beginning the conversation, it can be helpful to research the condition thoroughly, as well as read accounts from those in recovery. This way parents can better <a>understand and empathize with their child’s experience.</a></p>
<a>In response, </a>parents can encourage small changes and provide perspective on what the child is missing in their current state of being.
<h2> How do I talk to my child about an eating disorder? </h2>
<a>exploring any topic that emerges,</a> from being bullied at school to feeling intense anxiety.
<p>Maintain a calm tone throughout the conversation, even if you are struggling internally, so that it feels less overwhelming for your child. Whether in the first conversation or a later one, discuss concrete steps to begin treatment.</p>
<h2> How do I encourage my child to accept treatment? </h2>
<p>Confronting a disorder and seeking treatment will likely require many conversations. In these talks, parents should be specific about the next step, such as finding a therapist or being evaluated by an eating disorder specialist. </p>
<a>that forces them to address the disorder.</a>
<p>The guidance above applies to children who need help but are not in immediate danger. If you are urgently concerned for your child’s safety, go to the hospital or call 911.</p>
<h2> How do I find a treatment center or therapist? </h2>
<p>Find a <a>treatment center</a> or an <a>eating disorder specialist</a> who takes your insurance in the Psychology Today Therapy Directory. Referrals from doctors or friends can also be helpful in this process.</p>
<p>Parents will want to research a clinic or therapist beforehand. It can be helpful to ask questions about credentials, experience, past patient outcomes, treatment strategies, how progress is measured, and insurance plans and payment options.</p>
<h2> How do I support my child in recovery? </h2>
<p><a>Recovery from an eating disorder</a> is a continuous process, with twists and turns along the way. Parents should recognize that in addition to moving forward, children will probably also contend with setbacks or relapses. </p>
<p>Parents can encourage their child to stick to the treatment plan or meal schedule and continue developing coping skills. They can also remind the child of their larger life goals, such as returning to school if they took time off. </p>
<a>Maintaining central pillars of your own life is important, </a>both for yourself and so that you can be there for your child.

<h2> What does it mean to be in recovery? </h2>
<h2> How many people recover from eating disorders? </h2>
<p>Many people recover from eating disorders and go on to lead healthy, fulfilling lives. For a smaller number, however, the disorder doesn’t abate.</p>
<a>50 percent,</a> but research that followed participants for a longer period of time found that
<h2> What leads to a successful recovery? </h2>
<p>Another crucial component is a <a>strong support system.</a> Successful recovery often encompasses loved ones who encourage the individual to eat, continue treatment, talk through challenges, and strive toward their larger goals.</p>
<h2> What is the role of relapse in recovery? </h2>
<p>The road to recovery is not one smooth process—it very <a>often includes slips and relapses.</a> But it’s important to continue moving forward despite those difficult setbacks.</p>
<h2> What are the warning signs of a relapse? </h2>
<li>Departing from an eating schedule, such as by skipping occasional meals.</li>
<li>Developing a renewed obsession with food, weight, and appearance.</li>
<li>Adopting a new restrictive diet.</li>

<h2> When is inpatient treatment necessary? </h2>
<p>It can be difficult to know how to help someone with an eating disorder; in addition to being painful to understand and discuss, the severity of the condition varies widely.</p>
<p>However, if you are concerned for someone’s immediate safety, such as if their physical health has deteriorated, seek medical attention or call 911.</p>
<h2> What are different types of treatment for eating disorders? </h2>
<a>Enhanced Cognitive Behavior Therapy as well as Family-Based Treatment.</a> Clinicians may also practice therapies of other kinds, such as Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, or Psychodynamic Therapy.
<h2> What is Enhanced Cognitive Behavioral Therapy? </h2>
<a>CBT-E was created specifically to treat eating disorders.</a> It encompasses a personalized treatment approach, addressing the thoughts that maintain the disorder and leading the individual to decide for themselves to maintain a healthy weight.
<p>Clinical trials show that CBT-E <a>effectively treats eating disorders</a>; however, further research is needed to determine whether it is consistently more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
<h2> What Is Family-Based Treatment? </h2>
<p>Family-Based Treatment (FBT) is a leading treatment for adolescents with eating disorders. It’s also referred to as the Maudsley method, named for the British hospital where it was created in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The approach incorporates the entire family. It helps parents support their children to eat and restore a healthy weight. In this process, parents assume control over the child’s eating before gradually shifting that power back to the child.</p>
<a>more appropriate for some families than others.</a>
<h2> Do any medications treat eating disorders? </h2>
<p>Medications may be prescribed to address relevant symptoms, such as anxiety or depression. But there are currently <a>no drugs approved to treat eating disorders.</a></p>

<h2> Are eating disorders genetic? </h2>
<a>greater risk</a> of developing one themselves. For example, studies show that people are
<a>7 to 12 times more likely</a> to develop anorexia or bulimia if they have a relative with an eating disorder.
<p>Those genetic underpinnings may also help explain why eating disorders often overlap with certain conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and obsessive compulsive disorder.</p>
<p>However, one’s genetic predisposition is only one piece of the puzzle. For most people, a triggering event would also be necessary to spur the development of a disorder.</p>

<h2> How do culture, media, and beauty ideals influence eating disorders? </h2>
<p>Eating disorders are prominent in Western cultures, which place a strong emphasis on thinness, weight, and beauty. This can lead young adults, especially women, to believe that their self-worth is tied to their weight.</p>
<a>Constant comparison can take a heavy toll</a> on self-esteem and body satisfaction.
<p>Cultural and media scripts may contribute to the development of an eating disorder. However, they cannot produce the condition on their own.</p>

<li> What are the symptoms of an eating disorder? </li>
<h2> What are the symptoms of an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>Each eating disorder has a specific set of symptoms:</p>
<li>Anorexia Nervosa: Restricting the amount of food eaten, leading to significantly low body weight, and intense fear of gaining weight.</li>
<li>Pica: Consistently eating nonfood items, such as paper, cloth, or hair, for at least one month.</li>
<li>Rumination Disorder: Consistently regurgitating food to chew, swallow, or spit out for at least one month.</li>
<li>Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder: Not eating to the point of insufficient nutrition or energy, in the absence of anorexia or bulimia.</li>
<h2> How can you recognize if someone has an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>The clearest signs of eating disorders may be rapid weight loss, unusual eating patterns, and excessive exercise. But there are also more <a>subtle signs</a> that a disorder may be developing or underway.</p>
<p>One observable theme, as the signs above demonstrate, is the development of routines and rigidity around eating and exercise.</p>
<h2> When do eating disorders develop? </h2>
<a>median age</a> when anorexia and bulimia develop is 18-years-old and the median age when binge-eating disorder develops is 21-years-old, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.
<a>eating disorder to strike women in midlife.</a> Stressful life changes, such as a divorce or childcare responsibilities, as well as hormonal changes might lay the groundwork for disordered eating to develop.
<h2> Who can develop an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>There are no boundaries to who can be hurt by eating disorders. Women develop them more often than men, but eating disorders can still arise in people of any age, race, or gender.</p>
<p>Recent research found eating disorders affect women of <a>ethnic minorities just as much as they affect White women.</a> The risk factors for developing a disorder were also the same across all ethnic groups.</p>
<h2> Are women more likely to develop eating disorders than men? </h2>
<h2> How is an eating disorder diagnosed? </h2>
<a>mental health professional,</a> a primary care physician, or both. The diagnosis can encompass both a physical exam and psychological questionnaires to assess a person’s eating habits and relationship to food and weight.
<h2> At what point does a diet become an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>In today’s wellness-obsessed culture, it can be difficult to distinguish between occasional concerns around food, picky eating, a diet, and an eating disorder. Where can you draw the line between health and harm?</p>
<p>Orthorexia is a term that describes an obsession with healthy eating. People with orthorexia may adopt strict diets, cut out entire food groups, and develop anxiety about diseases or food purity. </p>
<a>orthorexia may mask a more traditional eating disorder.</a>
<p>Perhaps because focusing on healthy eating is more socially acceptable than being fixated on weight loss, orthorexia may in part function to camouflage symptoms of an eating disorder.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>Types of Eating Disorders</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Anorexia is up to 10 times more common in women than in men. It most often begins in adolescence or young adulthood, but a second peak seems to occur <a>after age 40.</a> </p>
<a>Anorexia emerges due to a combination</a> of genetics, life circumstances such as childhood trauma, and cultural beauty ideals—which can play a role but are never fully responsible.
<p>Yet treatment is key because bulimia can produce medical complications in addition to deep distress. People with bulimia can become dehydrated, lose electrolytes, erode their dental enamel, and have gastrointestinal problems.</p>
<h2> Binge-Eating Disorder </h2>
<p>Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S. Many people also <a>shift between different eating disorders</a> over the years, such as struggling with anorexia at one time and binge-eating at another. </p>
<a>shame and self-criticism about it.</a>
<p>Pica occurs when someone consistently eats things that aren’t food. This could include paper, soap, cloth, paint chips, crayons, dirt, or ice—foods that contain no nutritional value and may be dangerous to digest.</p>
<p>Rumination occurs when people consistently regurgitate their food after eating. They then chew it, swallow it, or spit it out. Regurgitation occurs without a sense of disgust, nausea, or involuntary gagging. </p>
<p>Rumination often occurs in infancy and childhood, but it can affect adults as well. Stress and anxiety are risk factors for babies and children, while anxiety and depression are risk factors for adults.</p>
<p>Some people describe the condition as habitual or out of their control, and therapy may focus on interrupting and reversing those habits.</p>
<h2> Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder </h2>
<p>ARFID is also distinct from anorexia; the food aversion that marks ARFID is not driven by fears around body image or gaining weight, as in the case of anorexia.</p>
<p>ARFID can be addressed by a nutritionist and aided by a variety of clinicians, including pediatricians, gastroenterologists, and psychologists, to understand and address the root of the disorder.</p>

<p>Bulimia is categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or extreme based on the number of inappropriate compensatory behaviors that happen each week. </p>
<a>stress</a>, or uncomfortable emotions, like
<a>anger</a> or sadness. Purging and other actions to prevent weight gain are ways for people with bulimia to feel more in control of their lives and to ease stress and
<a>anxiety</a>. There is no single known cause of bulimia, but there are some factors that may play a part.
<a>beauty</a>. Images of flawless, thin females everywhere make it hard for women to feel good about their bodies. Increasingly, men are also feeling pressure to have a perfect body.
<li>Families. Those with a mother or sister who has bulimia are more likely to have bulimia. <a>Parents</a> who think looks are important, <a>diet</a> themselves, or criticize their children's bodies are more likely to have a child with bulimia.</li>
<li>Life changes or <a>stressful</a> events. <a>Traumatic</a> events, like rape, as well as stressors, such as starting a new <a>job</a>, can trigger bulimia.</li>
<li>Biology. <a>Genes</a>, <a>hormones</a>, and other biological factors may contribute to developing bulimia.</li>
<p>As with anorexia, treatment for bulimia often involves a combination of options and depends on individual needs.</p>
<a>psychotherapy</a>, especially
<a>cognitive-behavioral therapy</a>, and be prescribed
<a>antidepressants</a>—such as fluoxetine (Prozac), the only
<a>medication</a> approved by the FDA for treating bulimia—may help patients who also suffer from
<a>depression</a> and anxiety. The drug also appears to help reduce binge-eating and purging as well as the chance of
<a>relapse</a>, and it can improve eating attitudes.
<a>therapy</a> tailored to the treatment of bulimia has also been shown to be effective in changing bingeing and purging behavior and improving attitudes towards eating. Therapy may be done one-on-one or in a group setting.
