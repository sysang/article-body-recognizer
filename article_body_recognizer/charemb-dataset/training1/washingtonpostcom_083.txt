<a>Lufthansa</a>; and Jetstar, Qantas and Virgin
<a>in Australia</a> are blaming the surge in
<a>omicron variant</a> for sending their crews to sick leave or isolation after being identified in contact tracing.
<a>chaotic travel season</a> when airlines such as Spirit and Southwest were facing staffing shortages, By The Way
<a>compiled a guide</a> for what to do if your flight gets canceled and how to get a refund you are owed. Here’s a helpful reminder.
<h2>Staff illnesses and lack of demand are to blame for cancellations, airlines say</h2>
<div><div><div>By Rachel Weiner and Hannah Knowles1:48 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<div><div><p>Some international airlines have canceled thousands of flights scheduled for this weekend and beyond, citing staff illness and lack of demand as the omicron variant spreads and prompts new travel restrictions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Lufthansa said in a statement Friday that “a high rate of people calling in sick” and lack of demand had led it to cancel a dozen flights this holiday weekend.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Scandinavian Airlines canceled nearly five dozen flights that had been scheduled for the next week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have staff who are ill, have symptoms or someone who is ill in their household, and the recommendation is then that they should stay at home,” a Scandinavian Airlines spokeswoman said, according to the Local.</p></div></div>
<p>Japan’s ANA, already forced to cancel most international flights when the country closed its borders at the beginning of the month, is suspending service on dozens of domestic routes because of lack of demand, according to a news release.</p>
<div><p>United Airlines said Friday that it has not canceled flights because of decreased demand. Asked whether a drop in demand had spurred any cancellations, Kate Modolo, a spokesperson for Delta Air Lines, said the company had nothing to add.</p></div>

<a>Consumer Reports Advocacy</a>, said this fall. “We have put more energy into this single issue than any other airline issue that we have advocated for over the last 18 months or so.”
<div><div><p>He said the organization started collecting stories from people who were having refund problems in March 2020 and were “inundated.” Complaints from people struggling to get their money back continue.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In November, the Transportation Department reached a $4.5 million <a>settlement </a>with Air Canada in which the airline says it paid $570 million in refunds.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The death of a teenage girl in a Los Angeles-area department store has ignited questions over a police officer’s decision to fire a rifle in a crowded public place while pursuing a suspect who did not have a gun.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I had no idea she had been shot,” Peralta said in a statement. “Her body went limp. I tried to wake her up by shaking her, but she didn’t wake up.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Los Angeles Police Department on Monday released video footage that shows the teen girl was hit inside the store after an officer fired at the suspect, 24-year-old Daniel Elena Lopez, who also died.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Mask-wearing on planes may be here to stay, top federal infectious-disease expert Anthony S. Fauci says.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In an interview on ABC News’s “This Week” on Sunday, he was asked if he believes there will be a point when it won’t be necessary to wear masks during air travel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t think so,” he said. “I think when you’re dealing with a closed space, even though the filtration is good, that you want to go that extra step.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Health officials say omicron variant likely to cause record-high coronavirus cases, hospitalizations in U.S.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Fauci’s comments also follow <a>remarks from Southwest Airlines CEO</a> Gary Kelly, who said during a Senate hearing last week that masks “don’t add much, if anything, in the air cabin environment.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kelly, who tested positive for the <a>coronavirus</a> days after the hearing, added: “It’s very safe, very high-quality, compared to any other indoor setting.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During the same hearing, American Airlines CEO Doug Parker argued an “aircraft is the safest place you can be. It’s true of all of our aircraft — they all have the same HEPA filters and air flow.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fauci said Sunday that “even though you have a good filtration system, I still believe that masks are a prudent thing to do, and we should be doing it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fauci advised people to be cautious as they travel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If you are vaccinated and boosted and are prudent when you travel, when you're in an airport, to be wearing a mask all the time — you have to be wearing a mask on a plane,” he said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Frantic search for pets underway as Colorado takes stock of fire devastation </h1></div>
<h2>After a half-day search effort, 40 dogs that were staying at a boarding facility in Superior, Colo., when the flames erupted were accounted for</h2>

<a>search efforts</a> continued.
<div><div><p>Hwang said she was in awe of “just how generous people are right now.”</p></div></div>
<p>Then Creasey got a call about two of the last dogs that still hadn’t been located. Two people had found Dexter, the Thomsons’ dog, along with another named Poppy. Creasey updated the owners and drove to pick up the dogs right away.</p>
<div><div><p>“Their eyes were covered in soot and smoke, and they were both very shaken,” Creasey said. She took them home to bathe them and keep them in for the night.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We sat out in my living room, and I gave them food and plenty of water. They wouldn’t leave my side,” she said. The next morning, the dogs were picked up by friends and family.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It took more than 15 hours, Creasey said, but all 40 dogs had been located. She didn’t get much sleep that night, she said, but was grateful the dogs from the boarding facility were found safe and were mostly fine.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When his family finally picked him up, Thomson said, Dexter was apprehensive at first, taking a few steps back, before realizing who they were.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Then we couldn’t get him to stop licking us,” he said.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Michigan school district requires clear backpacks after shooting, a common step questioned by experts</h1></div>
<h2>The move is one of several new safety measures being implemented after the Oxford attack</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paulina Firozi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 5:52 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Middle and high school students in a Michigan school district will be required to use clear backpacks on campus, one of numerous new safety measures announced weeks after a deadly school shooting at Oxford High School.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Clear backpacks will be provided for all middle- and high-schoolers, the district announced Wednesday in a message to the community.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Elementary school students will not be required to use the backpacks, but they will keep their bags in lockers or cubbies during the day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Criminologists and school safety experts said such backpack rules are common after shootings and other tragic events, but some say the policy is not the best way to address the problems that lead to gun violence in schools.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Please help me’: Kids with guns fueled a record number of school shootings in 2021</p></div>
<div><p>Schools are in an “impossible position right now, faced with rising threats of gun violence,” said James Densley, a professor of criminal justice at Metropolitan State University and a co-founder of the Violence Project.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Young people with guns drove a record number of school shootings last year — there were at least 42 acts of gun violence on K-12 campuses during regular hours, according to <a>data tracked by The Post</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Schools “are in this position of having to do something, and they’ve got to try and build trust with parents and community members and be seen to be doing something about this,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The clear-backpack requirement often is one visible signal meant to show schools are taking safety seriously, experts said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And it’s a signal that may help in some ways.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It could be reassuring for students, Densley said: “Almost like a placebo effect. ‘I can see inside, and there’s not a gun there. That makes me feel safe.’ ”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On the other hand, he said, it could remind them “that this was the site of a school shooting. … Constantly reminding them of the fact that classmates were victims of violence could be re-traumatizing.”</p></div></div>
<a>analysis Child Trends published in 2020</a> that said at the state level, “most school safety laws passed after high-profile school shooting incidents primarily focus on preparing for, not preventing, such events.”
<div><p>How can schools detect potentially violent students? Researchers have an answer.</p></div>
<div><div><p>She pointed to the Oxford <a>shooting</a>, and the alleged gunman, a 15-year-old who had <a>come to the attention</a> of school officials for worrying behavior in the days before the deadly attack.</p></div></div>
<div><p>After Michigan school shooting, experts question what could have prevented it</p></div>
<div><div><p>Densley credited Oxford Community Schools for the additional measures it had announced, including making available trauma specialists and training for staffers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You want trauma-informed practices as you build these robust assessment protocols so we can prevent this type of violence from occurring,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the message to the community, the Oxford superintendent noted resources and encouraged their use. An <a>FAQ page on the district website</a> includes a list of where community members can access mental health resources.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This has been a challenging time for our community, and I want to encourage our Wildcats and their families to utilize the many resources and services for coping with trauma,” Throne said.</p></div></div>

<h2> The chains’ announcements come amid an expanding landscape for plant-based alternative meats</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paulina Firozi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 5:12 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Two restaurant chains announced this week that they are expanding plant-based menu options nationwide, the latest sign that alt-meat is having its moment.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Nestle said the companies “must think there is a market for plant-based alternatives and want to bring people who want these alternatives into their stores.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It may bring in new consumers who may have otherwise objected to buying fast food. It can also help a restaurant overcome the “veto vote,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Let’s say someone is bringing a bunch of kids for a fast meal,” he said. “If you don’t have products that will speak to everyone … you might lose out.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Chipotle, this is an extension of what it has already been doing, he added. Chipotle said the plant-based chorizo is its “second-ever vegan protein on a national stage.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For people curious about plant-based proteins, seeing the option at a restaurant they frequent may be enough to push them to try it, experts said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Both companies signaled that while the new products will be available for a limited time, they will evaluate and consider whether to offer them again or longer-term.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cash noted that KFC and Chipotle are not the first chains to offer plant-based menu items.</p></div></div>

<div><span><div><span><div>By Maura Ewing</div>, </span></div><div><span><div>María Luisa Paúl</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Paulina Firozi</div></span></div></span></div>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — Investigators are probing whether a 5-year-old child playing with a lighter may have sparked a house fire that killed a dozen people, including eight children, one of the worst blazes in the city’s recent history.</p>
<div><div><p>“This should not be construed in any way to mean that the fire is considered criminal in nature (at this point, this is still a very active and early investigation),” she wrote in an email.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Over the next decade, the family grew and eight children were added to the household. While that number meant there were significantly more people living in a relatively small space, he said the agency was right to allow them to stay.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Despite Philadelphia’s relatively low housing costs, many city residents simply do not have enough income to find housing they can afford,” the researchers wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mayor Jim Kenney (D) said the city is offering support resources for survivors and for friends and family “still processing this tragedy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“As I said yesterday, losing so many children is just devastating,” Kenney said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At least 12 people, including 8 children, killed in Philadelphia rowhouse fire, officials say</p></div>
<p>The ripples of the tragedy have reached across Philadelphia. Residents from across the city came to pay their respects about a half-block from the home at shrine-like pile of stuffed animals, prayer candles and flowers that grew throughout the day.</p>

<h1>Inside a district attorney’s campaign to reform the Austin police department</h1>
<h2>In just 10 months, the new prosecutor won indictments against nine law enforcement officials. Now he is in a showdown with police.</h2>

<b> </b>one of his prosecutors, Dexter Gilford. A grand jury had just indicted two Austin police officers, charging them with aggravated assault in connection with
<b> </b>the beating and hospitalization of an unarmed Black man during a drug arrest in 2019.
<p>Garza hadn’t even been district attorney for three weeks.</p>
<b> </b>warrants would be issued for their arrest. Gilford asked Garza: Should he call Austin’s chief of police to give him a heads-up?
<p>“Is there any other employer in the county to whom we would give a heads-up call if their employee was indicted?” Garza asked Gilford.</p>
<p>Gilford couldn’t think of anyone. Garza made up his mind. There would be no call.</p>

<p>Since he was sworn in on Jan. 1, his office has obtained indictments of<b> </b>five Austin police officers, two county deputies, an assistant county attorney and a sheriff on charges<b> </b>including tampering with evidence and<b> </b>murder.</p>
<p>His office is also prosecuting three additional officers who were indicted during<b> </b>the prior district attorney’s administration. And in many other criminal cases, he has sought sentences that emphasize rehabilitation over punishment.</p>
<b> </b>three police officers. In St. Louis, the prosecutor accused the police union in a lawsuit of interfering with her reform efforts.
<h4>A USE OF FORCE EXAMINED</h4>
<h3>Alleged assault of Paul Mannie, 44</h3>
<p>Police said that on March 28, 2019, Austin officers were on undercover patrol in an apartment complex where someone had been shot the day before when they saw 44-year-old Paul Mannie, who is Black, selling drugs.</p>
<b> </b>including office politics and personnel matters. The Post also periodically interviewed Austin police leaders and officers, the local police union president and attorneys for the indicted officers.
<b> </b>tension and distrust between Garza and Austin
<b> </b>has triggered strife about whether he is going too far, too fast. Nineteen
<b> </b>have faced greater turnover.
<b> </b>say Garza’s agenda jeopardizes the safety of 1 million Austinites, pointing
<b> </b>the annual homicide count — nearly 90 so far this year — is higher than it has been in decades.
<p>One year into his four-year term, Garza said he is not distracted by his critics and is committed to his agenda.</p>
<div><h3>Breakfast tacos and a broken system</h3></div>
<p>To some, Garza’s election was a vote of no confidence in how his predecessor, Margaret Moore, had dealt with alleged misconduct by police.</p>
<h3>Fatal shooting of David Joseph, 17</h3>
<h3>Police use of a Taser on Quentin Perkins, 20</h3>
<p>When Garza announced that he would challenge Moore’s reelection, no one saw it coming. Both hailed from a long line of Texans and are avid guitar players, but in most other ways are opposites.</p>
<p>During a campaign forum in February 2020, Moore, who is White, asked the audience: “Does anybody here think this is a community that ... sticks people in jail because they are brown? Or Black?”</p>
<p>Several people shouted: “Yes!”</p>
<p>The city had recently published a report detailing a growing racial disparity in traffic stops, and local news reports had just revealed allegations that an assistant Austin police chief regularly used racial slurs.</p>
<b> </b>on duty: Nine months earlier, he and fellow Officer Karl Krycia had shot Mauris DeSilva, a Sri Lankan man who was holding a knife while experiencing a mental health crisis.
<h3>Fatal shooting of Michael Ramos, 42</h3>
<h3>In-custody death of Javier Ambler, 40</h3>
<p>Moore said that she planned to take the Ramos shooting to a grand jury but had been delayed by the pandemic. “That was not a difficult decision, because he was unarmed,” Moore recalled recently.</p>
<p>For many in law enforcement, Garza’s win was an existential threat.</p>
<b> </b>What I’m telling my guys is, ‘Answer your calls and that is it.’” Casaday later reflected in an interview: “Was that the smartest thing to say? Probably not.”
<p>“We were unafraid of prosecution of police officers,” she said. “But the law of justification is a formidable obstacle.”</p>
<b> </b>to let him know, “You need to know this because you’re gonna be asked about it. ... I know that that’s gonna put you in an uncomfortable place.”
<p>“At some point, you leave,” he said.</p>
<p>In retrospect, Garza said, a courtesy call would have been a good idea. “Giving them a heads-up is a small, good-faith step I can take.”</p>
<p>“You know,” he said, “I’m learning.”</p>
<div><h3>‘Looking for a civil rights prosecutor’</h3></div>
<h3>Fatal shooting of Alex Gonzales Jr., 27</h3>
<p>On March 10, the unit made a big announcement: The grand jury had charged Officer Christopher Taylor with murder in the Ramos killing. It was the fourth indictment of an Austin police officer that year.</p>
<p>Just a month later, Garza’s office announced the indictments of four more law enforcement officials in neighboring Williamson County over the death of Ambler, the case that had stalled under Moore.</p>
<p>“I experienced that trial in ways that gave me reason for concern, for pause,” Gilford said. “I really did.”</p>
<p>Police, meanwhile, were struggling.</p>
<b> </b>about racially biased training and an overly militarized culture. It would not reopen until later that summer.
<p>Meanwhile, Garza and Travis County Attorney Delia Garza (the two are not related) imposed new scrutiny of arrests.</p>
<p>Under the new process, police still could arrest someone, but prosecutors would review the paperwork before it reached a judge. If they rejected the charges, the person would be freed within hours.</p>
<p>A statewide police union attacked Garza by name.</p>
<p>Prosecutors also rejected other charges including a felony theft charge for a man who allegedly stole less than $3 worth of groceries, and a felony assault charge against a hospital patient accused of pushing a security guard against a wall.</p>
<p>The rejections led to some<b> </b>heated exchanges between police and prosecutors, but inside Garza’s office, there was cause for optimism.</p>
<p>“We learned so much from each other,” Martinson told the team during the meeting. She suggested that prosecutors try to call the police officers involved when they decline charges, a policy the office soon adopted.</p>
<p>But before that could happen, the relationship with the police grew even more complicated.</p>
<p>On May 23, a Republican state senator tweeted a leaked email written by Garza’s chief deputy, Trudy Strassburger. The subject line of the email was, “Looking for civil rights prosecutor.”</p>
<p>“Friends, I am reaching out in the hopes that you may be looking to prosecute police officers, or that you know someone who is!” Strassburger’s email said.</p>
<p>“We need a heavy hitter who is willing to fight against the status quo.”</p>
<p>The email was meant to generate more interest in a job opening for a “team lead” in the Civil Rights Unit. Although hundreds of lawyers had applied to work in Garza’s office, few had experience with police misconduct cases.</p>
<p>Police saw the email in a different light.</p>
<p>Garza later called that an intentional misinterpretation of the email.</p>
<p>“I guess what she left off was [officers] ‘who break the law’? But you know, I mean, come on,” he said. “This office, we’re a criminal prosecuting entity. It goes without saying.”</p>
<p>CLEAT called for Strassburger’s resignation. She received at least 50 hostile online messages, including one that threatened to publish her home address. A thread on the website 4chan described how users believed the police should murder her.</p>
<p>At the start of Garza’s next weekly leadership meeting, he tried to set a lighthearted tone. “Who knew Dexter [Gilford] and his unit were so controversial?” he joked.</p>
<p>But midway through, as the team discussed the new teleworking policy and other matters, Strassburger’s face went white.</p>
<p>“I just got a message that they’re about to release my address because I’m a ‘Nazi cow,’” she said. “They’re about to go public on me.”</p>
<p>Everyone paused for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Then Strassburger took a breath and moved on. “All right, anyways, disclosure policy.”</p>
<p>In interviews with the local media, Garza defended the email as a routine job posting. The threats eventually died down. But the impact was profound.</p>
<b> </b>who had never been a prosecutor. Now, some police saw her as an enemy.
<p>“They’re always like us versus them,” Martinson said at the time. “Then it ramped up because of this email that Trudy sent out.”</p>
<p>“I really did feel like we were collaborating,” she later said. “Maybe I was the only one who felt that way. Maybe they were just humoring me. I don’t know.”</p>
<p>In a statement, Austin police said they had not intended to undercut Martinson.</p>
<p>“It appears that this was a communication breakdown between the APD detective and the assigned Assistant DA on what the next steps were going to be,” police said.</p>
<div><h3>Frustration all around</h3></div>
<p>Chacon and Garza thanked each other profusely for their offices’ hard and collaborative work. But then Garza announced that the two teens would be released and the charges against them dismissed.</p>
<p>A TV reporter asked, incredulous: “Are you letting them walk out today, and go back home? Is that in the best interest of this community?” Another reporter wanted to know whether police had arrested the wrong suspects.</p>
<p>Garza said there was no longer probable cause to keep either teen in jail and that releasing them was “in the best interests of this prosecution, of this investigation.” Then Chacon took the lectern.</p>
<p>Reporters pressed him further.</p>
<p>“I think the D.A. has indicated that he is not going to pursue charges at this moment,” Chacon answered.</p>
<b> </b>said later in an interview. “I certainly would have, you know, liked for the D.A. to expand a little bit more on his decision to drop the charges.”
<p>Garza said he was taken aback by Chacon’s reaction. Just minutes before the news conference, he and Chacon had gone over their talking points. Chacon had expressed no concern about releasing the teenagers, he said.</p>
<p>Months later, one of the teens was arrested for allegedly trying to sell the weapon used in the shooting.</p>
<p>Garza’s frustrations were mounting.</p>
<p>A similar complaint came from a resident who had called Garza’s office about rampant drug use in his neighborhood. The caller said police told him they could do nothing because the offenders would not be prosecuted.</p>
<p>None of those claims were true, Garza said: His office had done nothing to prevent officers from making arrests, and he was not declining to prosecute all lower-level crimes.</p>
<p>“Law enforcement officers misrepresenting the facts is a pretty grave threat to our system of law,” he later said in an interview.</p>
<b> </b>“I think that our policy views are pretty divergent right now.”
<p>It was the group’s last taco meeting.</p>
<p>The internal dissension was greatest among attorneys in the child abuse unit, where six of the nine lawyers and the division chief had quit. Two lawyers in the unit were also fired.</p>
<p>Garza noted that Tisdale had worked for him for only three months.</p>
<p>“There certainly are people who have left because this is not a direction they want to go. And I think we expected that,” Garza said.</p>
<p>The Civil Rights Unit also had a setback.</p>
<b> </b>name, had withheld an expert opinion finding that Gentry’s use of force in the arrest was justified. Garza also
<b> </b>publicly apologized, saying, “I offer my sincere apologies to Officer Gentry, who undoubtedly suffered as a result of this process.”
<p>The criminal case against Bretches was not affected.</p>
<p>Privately, Garza asked for the resignation of the prosecutor who had handled the case, Sandra Ramirez. In a recent interview with The Post, Ramirez said that although she tendered her resignation, she did not agree with Garza’s actions.</p>
<p>Fugitt’s accusations, which prosecutors termed “baseless,” were dismissed by a judge. But the episode further strained relations between Garza’s office and police as the homicide rate climbed.</p>
<p>He said he was trying to develop a better relationship with law enforcement, proposing to meet with each division of the police department and handing out his business card to officers he sees in public.</p>
<p>“That note,” he said, “is a little bit of a reminder to me what’s at stake.”</p>
<div><h3>‘Waging a war on police officers’</h3></div>
<p>He had received word that Officers<b> </b>Christopher Taylor and Karl Krycia had been indicted on charges of murder and deadly conduct in the shooting of Mauris DeSilva in 2019.</p>
<b> </b>said that when the officers arrived and encountered DeSilva, he advanced toward them with the knife and ignored their commands to drop it. His family disputes the account. He was 46.
<p>For Taylor, it was his second murder indictment.</p>
<p>Taylor and Krycia had returned to active duty weeks after the DeSilva shooting. In April 2020, Taylor fatally shot Michael Ramos, which led to his first indictment.</p>
<p>DeSilva’s father had been devastated, his attorney recalled. “They gunned down my son like a dog,” he’d told Gilford. “And you’re not going to do anything about it.”</p>

<p>But then Garza was elected, promising to take every case to a grand jury: Twelve residents of Travis County believed there was enough evidence to charge Taylor and Krycia with murder. Gilford had been proved wrong.</p>
<p>While Casaday waited at the courthouse, officials took Taylor’s mug shot, fingerprinted him, and he posted bail. Then Casaday and Taylor walked over to the law offices of Taylor’s defense attorneys for a news conference.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Taylor and Krycia said both officers’ actions were justified.</p>
<p>In all, eleven current and former officers are awaiting their day in court.</p>
<p>“Take them to trial, and let’s just see what the community says,” said Parker, the East Austin pastor. “Yes, you will win some. Yes, you will lose some. But we still will find out where the community stands.”</p>

<div><div><p>The lawyer for a D.C. police officer who fatally shot himself nine days after he was injured confronting rioters at the Capitol on Jan. 6 says a group of cybersleuths has identified two of his attackers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That spokesman, Dustin Sternbeck, said the agency is “reviewing the information.” A spokeswoman for the FBI, which is leading the investigation into the assault on the Capitol, declined to comment.</p></div></div>
<p>The HuffPost first reported the sleuthing group Deep State Dogs, whose members scour the Internet trying to identify people involved in the riot, had identified a person possibly involved in the attack on Smith with the help of computer images.</p>
<div><div><p>“Officer Smith’s family has suffered terribly as they mourned amid uncertainty and doubt,” said Forrest Rogers, a spokesperson for Deep State Dogs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rogers said about a dozen people devoted themselves to identifying Smith’s attackers.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Two officers who helped fight at the Capitol have died by suicide</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It shouldn’t take a forensics professor on summer break to do the government’s work,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b/>Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood, 51, had taken his life three days after the riot. <a>Two other D.C. officers</a> also took their own lives in July. Their families have not spoken publicly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Relatives of Smith and Liebengood have said they believe the riot led to the suicides and are pushing for their deaths to be recognized as having occurred in the line of duty.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A therapist who counseled many of the D.C. officers who responded to the riot and led group sessions for hundreds has said she fears many suffered long-term head injuries that have gone undiagnosed.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Trauma, injuries still affect officers who were at Capitol riot</p></div>
<div><div><p>On his police injury form the night of the riot, Smith wrote: “Hit with flying object in face shield and helmet.” He added that he “began feeling pain in my neck and face.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You can see Jeff go down,” Weber said, adding the officer disappears in the unruly crowd.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said an officer from the Capitol Police dragged Smith to safety.</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><h1>CDC warns against travel to Italy due to ‘very high’ coronavirus risk </h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Paulina Villegas</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 14, 2021 at 2:36 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned people not to travel to Italy, placing one of Europe’s top tourist destinations on its highest-risk category for the coronavirus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The agency also added the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland and the small African island of Mauritius to its avoid travel list. </p></div></div>
<div><p>On Monday, the CDC moved all three places from a Level 3 risk category to Level 4 and recommended that people avoid traveling there. If they do, the agency said, they should ensure they are “fully vaccinated before travel.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>The CDC reviews case data and places a destination at Level 4, signifying “very high” risk, when it reports more than 500 new cases per 100,000 residents over the past 28 days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The CDC has four levels that start at “low” and escalate to “moderate,” “high” and “very high.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Italy </a>is one of the last countries in Europe to be placed at a Level 4, after France, Portugal — which has one of the highest vaccination rates in Europe — and Germany. Spain is at Level 3, as is Malta.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Europe continues to grapple with a <a>surge of coronavirus cases</a>, largely driven by the delta and highly transmissible omicron variants and as scientists and leaders worldwide continue to monitor and assess the severity of omicron.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Britain, also at Level 4, declared an “omicron emergency” this week and said it expects an “omicron tidal wave,” as cases continue to increase in <a>London</a> and other cities.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The Biden administration is facing renewed questions about its global coronavirus strategy, with international infections climbing and the new omicron variant poised to tear across the world.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Others are demanding details behind a plan to boost global vaccine manufacturing, complaining that the White House has yet to clarify the proposal’s objectives and strategy since unveiling it last month.</p></div></div>
<h2>Omicron is now in at least 36 U.S. states and 77 countries</h2>

<p>The omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly across the United States and the globe, reaching at least 36 U.S. states and 77 countries less than a month after being designated as a variant of concern by the World Health Organization.</p>
<a>report omicron cases</a>, and the variant was partially behind an
<a>83 percent rise</a> in cases in Africa over the past week, WHO officials said.
<a>major private study in South Africa</a> that omicron causes less severe illness than earlier variants, although the study also found that it was more resistant to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine commonly used there.
<a>said</a> last week omicron cases appear to cause less severe symptoms while cautioning that available data was preliminary and anecdotal.
<div><p>Health officials, though, are urging caution. Ghebreyesus, the WHO chief, <a>said</a> even if data later confirms that omicron is less lethal than other variants of concern, the sheer number of cases could overwhelm health-care systems.</p></div>
<a>New Mexico</a> are among the most recent states to report their first omicron cases. As the variant spreads, U.S. health officials and their counterparts in wealthy countries are encouraging residents to get booster shots.
<a>five months</a> to three months for most adults after the country
<a>started recording</a> new highs in daily cases, hospitalizations and deaths.
<div><div><p>WHO officials have said this push will worsen vaccine inequity. Africa, where omicron was first detected, has fully vaccinated less than 10 percent of its 1.2 billion people.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If we end inequity, we end the pandemic,” Tedros <a>said</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div>By Paulina Villegas7:14 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<div><div><p>The variant’s high transmissibility is reflected in states such as New Jersey and New York, where the CDC estimates that omicron could already account for 13 percent of all cases.</p></div></div>
