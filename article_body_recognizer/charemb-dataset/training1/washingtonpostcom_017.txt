<p>But to show how elements work together, I’ll group things into three buckets and take a look at just one concept in each.</p>
<p>On first and 10,?this family aims to get you to second and five. Third and short? Well here’s a nice way to move the chains and perhaps beat a blitz. (Think about how, in the Madden video game, slants always work when you need some yards.)</p>
<p>As an example, I’ll use “stick,” a staple of the West Coast offense that made the 49ers a dynasty in the 1980s.</p>
<p>We’ll call the three-receiver side the “front” side and the single-receiver side the “back” side.</p>
<a>when it’s being run by Randy Moss</a>.
<p><b>The short stuff is cute, but can we go deeper? </b></p>
<p>All right, let’s stretch the field a little bit with an old staple: Four Verts … with a twist. You probably think of it as a deep passing concept. I mean, look at it in its stock version, which could be taken from any air raid playbook.</p>
<p>I don’t blame you. Frankly, I <i>agreed</i> with you until I asked a coach who loves to run it -- Jerry Taylor, passing coordinator at Columbia -- and he explained it to me.</p>
<p>Four Verts may have four vertical route stems, but just because a receiver starts sprinting up the field doesn’t mean he’s going to end up deep. That can depend on the defense.</p>
<p>That No. 2 receiver on the left, for instance, can have a lot happen based on a particular coverage. By the time he’s 10 yards downfield, his route may look nothing like the “go” route you may associate with the concept.</p>
<p>What he means is that “four verticals” can be adapted in a way that brings these routes across the field and into the quarterback’s vision if he doesn’t like what he sees on the other side of the field.</p>
<p>This is what Four Verticals could end up looking like at the end. It’s much more medium distance for a 10-15 yard completion:</p>
<p><b>Okay, cool, but what’s it look like when we really want to sling it?</b></p>
<p>Deep and shot plays are sometimes grouped together. There aren’t a ton of these plays, maybe about five in a given week’s game plan. And they’re for when a team needs at least 30 or 40 yards.</p>
<p>Whereas the quick game calls for three-step drops from under center, this is as many as seven steps or often play-action with as many as eight blockers. This is where protection, and quarterback drop really tie together.</p>
<p><a>This Titans play from the 2019 season</a> that we linked to in our blocking explainer works because <a>they had the ingredients to make it work</a>:</p>
<li>A credible running game in Derrick Henry;</li>
<li>Wide receivers who can beat man coverage and excel after the catch in A.J. Brown and Corey Davis;</li>
<li>A quarterback who can throw accurately down the field in Ryan Tannehill.</li>
<p>And when it works, it <i>works. </i></p>

<a>about gaps</a>, and we’ve talked
<a>about pass blocking</a>. While I would love to spend all our time on the sumo-adjacent brawl in the trenches, I must acknowledge that the game also is played by smaller men, and their jobs start with route running.
<p><b>How many routes are there?</b></p>
<p>Too many. As Texas AM Coach Jimbo Fisher <a>once said in a coaching clinic</a>, “We can stay here ‘til 6 in the morning because Lord knows I <i>can</i> draw up a route.”</p>
<p>But here’s a version of the basic route tree for an outside receiver. There are many variants. Some have to do with verbiage, and others have to do with coaching points such as depth of the route.</p>
<p><b>Okay, but are they just running out there to a spot? </b></p>
<p>Not exactly. There’s a method to the madness. Five things go into a receiver’s route. Keep in mind this all happens in a handful of steps and sometimes simultaneously (particularly with points three and four).</p>
<a>use his speed and body position to get around him</a>. This all happens initially so he can get to …
<a>this goal-line play </a>to see an unusual type of release and a sudden burst. That burst worked because the receiver effectively used …
<p><b>Are all routes diagramed in the playbook? </b></p>
<p>Not necessarily. Coaches can go <i>nuts</i> drawing up plays if they really want to. In the same clinic I mentioned earlier, Fisher talked about how an old coaching buddy used to make fun of him during practice.</p>
<a>to beat a certain type of coverage</a>.
<p>The <a>Air Raid</a> staple play against man coverage can be straight crossing routes, but against zone, the receivers “sit down” in the soft spots of the zone.</p>
<p>And there is the option route, perfected by many <a>including longtime Cowboys tight end Jason Witten</a>, who’s now with the Raiders.</p>
<p>A well-executed option route is less a static play and more of a rehearsed reaction to what the defense thinks it’s taking away from the offense.</p>
<p><b>What about these “hot” routes we hear about?</b></p>
<a><i>this</i></a>, especially when the defense is blitzing and playing zone coverage rather than man coverage behind the blitz
<p>To get around that last issue, offenses can do what Jim Harbaugh’s 49ers did: build hot routes into every pass play <a>to take away the post-snap guesswork</a>.</p>
<p>That is just one way offenses stitch together different routes to paint a picture over the defense. But there are many, many more ways to do that. That’s where we get into the way routes work together in our next piece.</p>

<div> <h1>Protecting the QB: How and how many</h1> <div>Pass blocking is not just the job of the big guys</div> </div>
<div> <div> By Richard Johnson </div> <div>October 16, 2020</div> </div>
<p><i>Part of an occasional series</i></p>
<p><b>Could you explain this in three sentences or less? </b></p>
<p>Offenses protect the quarterback on pass plays with either just the five linemen or with some help from running backs and/or tight ends. There are three schools of thought when we talk about drop-back passing game protection: man, slide, and combo.</p>
<p><b>Wait, there are three different ways to pass-block?</b></p>
<p>Yes, it’s not just all the blockers getting in the way of the rushers without a plan.</p>
<p>The first method, man, is best explained with the acronym BOB: Big On Big/Back On [Line]Backer. Every offensive lineman is responsible for a defensive lineman, with the center responsible for the middle linebacker if he comes on a blitz.</p>
<p>The running back then scans the remaining linebackers and has a few options:</p>
<li>If neither outside linebacker rushes the quarterback, the running back could move into a route to become a check-down receiver, or he could help assist a teammate in dealing with a particularly dangerous rusher.</li>
<li>If one outside linebacker rushes, he blocks him.</li>
<li>If both linebackers rush, he blocks one, and the quarterback is responsible for getting rid of the ball before the other linebacker gets to him. </li>
<p>To understand how that works, I asked an offensive line coach, Colorado State’s Louie Addazio.</p>
<p><b>Uh, can you translate that?</b></p>
<p><b>What’s the specific benefit of the combo scheme?</b></p>
<a>the C gap</a>, that means a defensive lineman likely is coming
<a> into the B gap</a> despite starting the play in the C. The slide helps the offense counter this scenario because the sliding offensive linemen are moving toward areas, not specific people.
<p><b>So what happens when the defenders don’t line up as perfectly as they did in that diagram?</b></p>
<p>You’ll remember Addazio mentioned field pressures in terms of first and second down. Defense tend to get funky with blitzes on third downs, and that requires specialized protection plans.</p>
<p><b>Why did you spend all this time explaining six-man protections when my team could just block for the quarterback with eight guys and not have to worry about it?</b></p>
<i>most </i>things defenses will attempt, particularly on first and second down.
<a> such as this one</a>. Or perhaps it’s a passing concept that needs a lot of time to develop
<a> such as this one</a>. This isn’t really something an offense will run very often.
<p><b>Okay, so why not roll with five blockers? That way, you’ve got five receivers out!</b></p>
<p>LSU got away with this, and won a national championship doing so, in 2019. The Tigers had the luxury of five bona fide receiving threats to tax defenses, and future No. 1 overall pick Joe Burrow at quarterback.</p>
<p>But most teams don’t have LSU’s talent or 2019 Joe Burrow, so defenses see five-man protections as invitations to blitz the opponent into submission. </p>
<p><b>What else do I need to know?</b></p>
<p>What I hope you’ll take away from this is an understanding of how your team is protecting the passer by noticing:</p>
<div> <ul> <li>How many blockers are doing it</li> <li>How they’re moving to do it</li> </ul> </div>
<p>This really just scratches the surface. We didn’t even get <i>near </i>screen passes, bootlegs, or RPOs or … <a>other protection tactics</a>.</p>
<p><b>So what’s next? </b></p>
<p>We’ve done enough in the trenches for now. Next, it’s time for the skinny guys.</p>

<p><i>First in an occasional series on how to watch football smarter</i></p>
<p><b>There are more letters in the alphabet, and there can be more than one tight end in a formation. Ever thought of that, genius? </b></p>
<i>technically</i> if you had a two-tight end set there would then be an E-gap. And
<a>the E gap exists outside of the D</a> when there is only one tight end, but that’s not really common in the lexicon of the game and more of a theoretical space.
<p><b>Do the skill players need to know about gaps? </b></p>
<p>Okay, first of all, linemen take offense to the term “skill players,” which implies that they have no skill when in fact the delineation should be between “big skill” and “small skill.” But I digress …</p>
<p><b>As a fan, why should I care? </b></p>
<p>Teams that run a pass-heavy, air-raid offense, for instance, make their gaps wider by expanding their splits to help linemen with pass protection. </p>
<p><b>Does the defense care about gap names? </b></p>
<p>He may not necessarily be responsible for that gap when the ball is snapped, but it is where he initially lines up.</p>
<p><b>Football guys use a bunch of terms with gap as a suffix or a prefix. What’s up with that?</b></p>
<p>Let’s run through the most common ones you might hear on a football broadcast.</p>
<p><i>Gap running schemes:</i> This is the family of run plays that include “power” and “counter.” Running plays have a front side (where the ball’s intended to go) and a backside, the midpoint of which is the center.</p>
<p>A defense that is not gap sound can be ….</p>
<p><i>Outgapped: </i>This is where we discover the beauty of the zone read. Let’s say the defense is three-for-three on the left side of the center — a man for every gap.</p>
<p>This is how fine the margins are when you combine this design with a generational athlete, <a>as the Ravens show us here</a>.</p>
<p>This is just the foundation. From here, we build on this in both the run and pass game. Stay tuned.</p>

<div><div><p>That’s the plan Bruce Arians explained following his Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ 31-9 win Sunday over the Kansas City Chiefs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For the Chiefs’ Andy Reid — who himself, at age 62, was trying to become the oldest head coach to win back-to-back Super Bowls — it was a matter of trying to “get back and ready for next year.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“I’m so proud of all these guys out here,” he said at the victory podium at Tampa’s Raymond James Stadium. “We came together at the right time.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Turning to his teammates, Brady exclaimed, “I think we knew this was going to happen tonight, didn’t we?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Noting that his team pulled itself out of a rough patch in November, when it fell to a 7-5 record before a Week 13 bye, he added, “We ended up playing our best game of the year.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Brady completed 21 of 29 passes against the Chiefs for 201 yards, three touchdowns and a 125.8 rating. He did not turn the ball over and was sacked just once, for a six-yard loss.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It is his fifth Super Bowl MVP award, an NFL record to go with his unprecedented seven wins in 10 trips to the NFL’s championship game.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>TAMPA — The most unfamiliar of NFL seasons, played as the league maneuvered its way through the coronavirus pandemic, ended with the most familiar of results. Tom Brady added to his collection of Super Bowl victories.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Brady, with three touchdown passes, bested Patrick Mahomes in a marquee quarterback matchup, and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 31-9, on Sunday night at Raymond James Stadium in Super Bowl LV.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think they’re all special,” Brady said. “This has been an amazing year.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Super Bowl: Game highlights, MVP and postgame celebration in Tampa</p></div>
<div><div><p>It was the seventh Super Bowl triumph for Brady in his 10th appearance, punctuating his storybook first season with the Buccaneers after two dynastic decades with the New England Patriots.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He is the greatest football player that ever played,” said Buccaneers tailback Leonard Fournette, who ran for 89 yards and a touchdown.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There is no end in sight for the 43-year-old Brady, who said last week that he could envision playing beyond age 45.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Yeah, we’re coming back,” he said during the on-field postgame celebration.</p></div></div>
<div><p>In this postseason alone, Brady and the Buccaneers defeated three legendary — or legendary-to-be — quarterbacks in succession: the New Orleans Saints’ Drew Brees, the Green Bay Packers’ Aaron Rodgers and Mahomes.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Buccaneers Coach Bruce Arians gave credit to his defensive coordinator, Todd Bowles, and said, “I think he got a little tired of hearing about how unstoppable [the Chiefs] were.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Chiefs failed in their bid to become the NFL’s first repeat champions since Brady’s Patriots in the 2003 and 2004 seasons.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s tough,” Chiefs Coach Andy Reid said. “That’s a tough thing. Even to get back to this game, it’s tough.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Brewer: Tom Brady, the one-man dynasty, was Tampa Bay’s perfect missing piece</p></div>
<p>Mahomes was under pressure all night and threw two interceptions while completing only 26 of 49 passes for 270 yards. The Chiefs couldn’t reach the end zone and never resembled the team that dominated the NFL over the past two seasons.</p>
<div><div><p>“They were just better than us today,” Mahomes said. “I don’t know what else to say.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>NFL free agency grades for all 32 teams: Patriots, Jets, Browns earn high marks</h1></div>

<div><div><p>The 8 percent drop in the salary cap caused perhaps the most unusual free agency period in NFL history.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fewer than 20 free agents received contracts worth $10 million or more per year. Players in their 30s had to take big discounts. The quarterback market dried up quickly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But this was also one of the most active free agency periods. Nearly 130 players moved to different teams in the first week-plus. There were 14 trades. Re-signings are happening at a quick pace, often for low prices.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here are free agency grades for all 32 teams.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Arizona Cardinals: B</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Atlanta Falcons: C</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Baltimore Ravens: C-minus</b></p></div></div>

<div><div><p><b>Chicago Bears: D</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Cincinnati Bengals: D</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Cleveland Browns: A</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Dallas Cowboys: B</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>Dak Prescott showed how the NFL’s contract rules are different for quarterbacks</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Denver Broncos: A-minus</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Detroit Lions: C-minus</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Green Bay Packers: D</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The salary cap prevented them from doing much. So far, all they have done is re-sign cornerback Kevin King after re-upping running back Aaron Jones before free agency began.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Houston Texans: C</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>They’ve added more than 20 players, but they are mostly backups or special teams players making less than $3 million. They signed Tyrod Taylor as insurance at quarterback until <a>the Deshaun Watson situation</a> is resolved.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Indianapolis Colts: C</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Jacksonville Jaguars: B-plus</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Kansas City Chiefs: B</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Las Vegas Raiders: C-minus</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Los Angeles Chargers: A-minus</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The offensive line is so much better with the signings of center Corey Linsley and guard Matt Feiler. Jared Cook was a nice addition at tight end, replacing Hunter Henry for a fraction of the cost.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Los Angeles Rams: C-minus</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Miami Dolphins: B</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Minnesota Vikings: A</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Vikings’ defense got two steals. They get a quality defensive tackle (Dalvin Tomlinson) for $11 million per year and a good cornerback in Patrick Peterson for $8 million per year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>New England Patriots: A-plus</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>The Patriots’ free agency binge is about opportunity, not revenge</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>New Orleans Saints: D</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>New York Giants: B-plus</b></p></div></div>
<p>The Giants did well in getting the best available wide receiver in Golladay, who got $18 million per year. But their most questionable signing was cornerback Adoree Jackson on a three-year, $39 million contract, which might have been an overpay.</p>
<div><div><p><b>New York Jets: A</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Philadelphia Eagles: C-plus</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Eagles made the best of a tight cap situation, getting safety Anthony Harris on a one-year, $5 million contract and adding Joe Flacco as their backup quarterback.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Pittsburgh Steelers: C-plus</b></p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The 2021 NFL draft was all about the passing game, with five quarterback selections defining the first round and offensive linemen and pass catchers also flying off the board early.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Which teams did the best with their picks? Here are our choices for this year’s winners and losers:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Winners</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>They also did well to select right tackle Teven Jenkins in the second round, addressing a major need. There was risk in their decisions, including giving up next year’s first-round pick, but Fields is worth it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Edge rusher Myles Garrett said this defense should be scary, and he’s right. On paper, Cleveland might be the AFC North favorite.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The NFL draft’s first round reminds that at quarterback, good is no longer good enough</p></div>
<p><b>Dallas Cowboys:</b> The Cowboys were horrible on defense last year, so owner Jerry Jones showed his commitment to fixing the unit by picking defensive players with their first six choices. New coordinator Dan Quinn has reason to be very happy.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Losers</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Houston Texans:</b> This isn’t Nick Caserio’s fault. Houston’s new GM inherited a bad situation after previous coach Bill O’Brien traded away this year’s first- and second-round picks.</p></div></div>
<div><p>NFL draft grades: Browns, Patriots and Bears earn high marks</p></div>
<b>New Orleans Saints:</b> Cornerback was their biggest need, and the Saints didn’t address the position until the third round, when they drafted Stanford’s Paulson Adebo. They also didn’t get a wide receiver to replace Emmanuel Sanders.

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Ben Strauss</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Mark Maske</div></span></div></span></div><div>August 25, 2021 at 9:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<p>Now, three years after the Supreme Court <a>struck down the federal ban on sports gambling in most states</a>, the sports industry has pivoted from once opposing legalization efforts to embracing sports betting as a significant source of revenue.</p>
<div><div><p>The NFL and its teams expect to generate about $270 million in revenue this year from their sports-betting and gambling deals, according to a person familiar with the league’s finances. That’s only the beginning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You can definitely see the market growing to $1 billion-plus of league opportunity over this decade,” said Christopher Halpin, an executive vice president for the NFL who is its chief strategy and growth officer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The league’s approach involves a delicate balance.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Shifting winds</div></h3></div></div>
<a>wrote to the New Jersey court</a>, “threatens to damage irreparably the integrity of, and public confidence in, NFL football.”
<div><div><p>Between $75 billion to $125 billion was being gambled illegally on sports in the United States at the time, the NFL found, overwhelmingly online via smartphones to offshore sportsbooks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The frequent sports bettors were mostly young and male. The active rejecters were about 60 percent female and, overwhelmingly, over age 55.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>official data. There had to be prohibitions on betting by insiders and the onus placed on operators to make certain that wasn’t occurring.
<div><div><p>“At the end of the day, you’d much rather, if someone is going to bet, have it be in a legal, regulated market as a sport than done offshore,” Halpin said.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>licensed video internationally to sportsbooks, using the overseas market to test and innovate its approach. In 2019, the NFL struck its first international sportsbook sponsorships in Australia, the United Kingdom, Germany and Latin America.
<div><div><h3><div>A payday for partners</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The league’s shift came just in time for its broadcast partners, which are hunting for new revenue streams as cord-cutting upends their business models.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>Fans liked sportsbook apps on their phones, the league determined, but they didn’t like in-stadium betting kiosks or sports-gambling content on national TV broadcasts.
<div><div><p>Wingo believes that just as there now are designated outside experts to talk about officiating on NFL telecasts, one day there will be similar analysts for gambling commentary.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“To me, it’s inevitable,” he said. “Where you throw to someone or you cut in from another feed and say here’s our sharp and here’s the significance of what just happened for gamblers.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Because of the game we’re in,” Rivera said, “you put him in the middle of your defense now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A steady evolution</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>As teams fight over the entire field on most every play, the vital weapon is speed. It allows the offense to make the field bigger and the defense to make it smaller.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Eight outrageous (but not impossible) predictions for the 2021 NFL season</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Right now in college football, all the best athletes are playing wide receiver and defensive back,” Rivera said. “Because that’s what’s being produced right now. That’s the style.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Kansas City has done it as well as anybody, showing everybody just how important speed is, how dynamic you have to be,” Rivera said. “You have to be able to match that.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Redefining fast</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Speed helps those happen,” Presbyterian College Coach Kevin Kelley said. “As people start to believe those numbers, they start to recruit, draft, whatever, to fit those numbers.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Extreme innovation</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Futa Shinkawa</a> who is listed at 5-foot-9 and 162 pounds but whom Kelley said stands just 5-8 and weighs 150.
<div><div><p>“The kid’s going to play,” Kelley said. “It’s sheer speed and quickness. He may have been the one who put me over the top in thinking like this.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>“They’re not getting hit squarely and taking the same impact of a bigger kid,” Kelley said. “Would you rather have a 220-pound linebacker that takes a beating because he takes on a pulling guard in the hole?”</p></div>
<div><p>From 2018: On fourth down, NFL coaches aren’t getting bolder. They’re getting smarter.</p></div>
<div><p>In college, Kelley sees Shinkawa playing everywhere on defense. He could blitz from the middle. He could drop into coverage. And, at literally half the weight of a lineman he is trying to beat, he could rush the quarterback off the edge.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“If you’re a strategic coach,” Kelley said, “there are a lot more ways you can use speed than you can use size and strength.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The next big thing</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Everything is about speed, speed, speed,” Rivera said. “You’re going to start seeing these smaller guys coming into the league. … All of a sudden, people start running the ball again.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even Dimitroff, whose Falcons defense came within one calamitous sequence from winning a Super Bowl, said he believes there is a limit to how much a defense can sacrifice size for speed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Now,” he said, “I just want to try to bring a new speed to the game.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>WFT offered former female employees money for silence</p></div>
<div><div><p>Brian Levy, an agent who represents numerous Black coaches, said his clients would not be startled by Gruden sending emails that contained offensive language to a team president.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sally Jenkins: Football made Jon Gruden. Now the NFL must reckon with its creation.</p></div>
<a>became the first openly gay</a> active NFL player.
<a>took a personal day off from practice Wednesday</a> because he had “a lot to process,” Raiders General Manager Mike Mayock said.
<div><div><p>Gruden’s emails added another stain to a league that has drawn criticism for other issues related to race, from its handling of protests sparked by Colin Kaepernick to its dismal record on hiring minority coaches.</p></div></div>
<div><p>ESPN’s Adam Schefter says running completed story by Bruce Allen was ‘a step too far’</p></div>
<p>In an <a>interview with USA Today</a>, Smith was asked whether he had concerns that the players he represented were being led by people who thought like Gruden. Smith replied that he already had shared those concerns with players in team meetings.</p>
<a>said</a>. “All of that is rooted in a concept that they are somehow less valuable than other people.”
<p>Along with the racism, homophobia and misogyny in Gruden’s emails, Foxworth detected broad disdain for players. He noted Gruden’s profane screeds against rule changes intended to limit concussions or keep concussed players sidelined.</p>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Will Hobson</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>September 29, 2021 at 10:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><p>How ‘race-norming’ was built into the NFL concussion settlement</p></div>
<div><div><p>In the case of Dirden, his neurologist was so outraged that her diagnosis was overruled, she said in an interview, that she quit the network of doctors evaluating players in the settlement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I just felt the patients were getting jerked around, rooked and cheated,” said Maureen Leehey, professor of neurology at University of Colorado. “It just wasn’t right.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There you go,” she said. “To save money.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nearly six years after the first lawsuits were filed accusing the NFL of failing to protect its players from concussions, the settlement went into effect in January 2017.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The NFL admitted no liability, but it agreed to pay sums ranging from $25,000 to $5 million to any member of the class of more than 20,000 former players who developed one of several brain diseases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The parties had a singular goal in creating the Settlement Program: accurate diagnoses,” Karp wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But according to experts interviewed by The Post, the settlement’s evaluation process differed from their regular diagnostic work in key areas.</p></div></div>
<div><p>NFL says it will end controversial ‘race-norming’ in concussion settlement with players</p></div>
<div><div><p>In regular examinations, these scores are just one component of a broad evaluation and would never on their own disqualify a patient from a dementia diagnosis, said Leehey, the neurology professor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We never make a diagnosis — or decide not to make a diagnosis — based on a few test scores,” Leehey said. “That’s just one part of the picture.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And by placing so much weight on test scores, the NFL concussion settlement guaranteed that race-norming could affect the potential claims of Black former players.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In June, when the NFL publicly agreed to remove race-norming from the settlement, the league portrayed the practice as unavoidable.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Everyone agrees race-based norms should be replaced, but no off-the-shelf alternative exists,” league spokesman Brian McCarthy said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Alternatives do exist, said several experts, including Charles Golden, a neuropsychologist and professor of psychology at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You absolutely can score these tests without using racial norms,” Golden said. “You just ran into trouble [in the NFL concussion settlement] whenever you tried not to.”</p></div></div>
<p>“For me, it was very simple,” Golden said. “When we’re talking about qualifying somebody for a payment for difficulties they’re having … the criteria should be exactly the same for Black and White players.”</p>
<div><div><p>In the history of Johnstown, a small city in the mountains east of Pittsburgh, there are few athletes who have accomplished more than Carlton Haselrig.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As his short-term memory disappeared, Johnnie has kept his job, thanks in part to understanding co-workers, Laurie said, and a series of coping mechanisms.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He was just so clearly dealing with dementia,” Leehey said. “There was no question about it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When Dirden went through a neuropsychological evaluation in November, however, his test results fell short of the settlement’s requirements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The demographic corrections in this case … limit the ability to assign levels of impairment” to Dirden’s scores, the neuropsychologist wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Without a confirming diagnosis from the neuropsychologist, Dirden couldn’t file a claim.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It made absolutely no sense to me,” Leehey said. “He clearly deserved a settlement payment.”</p></div></div>
<p>Last year, however, the neurologist ordered the former player’s scores curved again, this time as if he were White.<b> </b>The result: His scores qualified him for an early dementia diagnosis and potentially a $400,000 settlement payment.</p>
<div><div><p>“You have people who are being told there’s nothing wrong with them when they know there’s something wrong,” she said. “That’s bigger, to me, than any settlement money.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>As the mediation between the league and ex-players continues, families of former players across the country are reviewing medical records and contacting lawyers to see whether race-norming affected their loved ones’ claims.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Michelle Haselrig, meanwhile, is consulting attorneys.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The crowd at the football stadium exceeded 350 that day, Michelle recalled with pride. When the hearse carrying Carlton reached the graveyard, the funeral procession of cars behind it still stretched back to the stadium, two miles away.</p></div>
