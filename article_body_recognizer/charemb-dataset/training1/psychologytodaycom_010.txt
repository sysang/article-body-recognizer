<h1> What Is a Life Lived Entirely for Another? </h1>
<h2> Personal Perspective: For 37 years, she was a full-time caregiver. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Johanne Powell, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>One chilly, February day, as Johanne Powell was driven to the hospital to give birth, she looked out the car window and felt as if she were driving through the sun; the fields were ablaze with bright yellow gorse flowers.</p>
<p>“I look back on that moment because that was the last time I was really happy,” she told me with gentle solicitude.</p>
<a>Chromosome</a>-8. The doctors told Johanne that if Siobhan lived past her first year, then she would be severely mentally and physically handicapped.
<a>depression</a> became despair. Just as Odysseus’s Penelope held to her convictions, Johanne cared steadfastly for her fragile daughter, weaving hope even as the stitches frayed.
<p>During her first year, Siobhan had kidney infections that, without special treatment, would have killed her. She also began having epileptic seizures.</p>
<p>Siobhan would never walk, never talk, never wipe herself, never feed herself. Johanne shed her ambitions, coped with the solitary, consuming task of unremitting care by retreating into her head, existing within her thoughts.</p>
<p>Johanne was not religious but was born with a strong sense of right and wrong. Years after Siobhan’s birth, she realized she had a gift of describing her experience with a blunt, human charm. She began to speak publicly about her experience.</p>
<p>Thirty-seven years of dedicated care and activism ended abruptly when Siobhan died.</p>
<a>caregiver</a> she would get a Master's in psychology, travel the world. Now, she says that she is 68 and too old to make a difference.
<p>“I have lost the thing that gave my life meaning,” she said.</p>
<a>Magical Thinking</a>, her book about loss and grief. “The look is one of extreme vulnerability, nakedness,
<a>openness</a>… These people who have lost someone look naked because they think themselves invisible.”
<p>“Such a lovely feeling that,” Johanne said with an uninflected wistfulness.</p>
<p>Johanne gave her life for Siobhan, and now that Siobhan is gone, she says she can feel good about herself. A clear <a>conscience</a> is the best coping mechanism.</p>
<p>With Siobhan’s small, lifeless body in his arms, Johanne felt her grief and loss completely, gazing upon the two people in her life that she loved the most, understanding that nothing is ever really done in vain.</p>

<h1>The Age of Overindulgence</h1>
<p>Raising likeable, responsible, respectful children.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2>Should We Give Every Child a Trophy?</h2> <p>What happens to children when they get an unearned trophy?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Are You a Best-Friend Parent?</a></h2> <p>Can parents be friends with their children? Does it represent childhood overindulgence?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Do You Parent Like a Vending Machine or a Slot Machine?</a></h2>
<p>Can and should parents learn from machines? Let’s consider two commonplace machines: a vending machine and a slot machine. What can they teach us about parenting?</p>
<h2><a>Best Parental Practices for Eliminating the Nag Factor</a></h2>
<p>Does your child nag you when you go shopping? Do your children beg you to do things they shouldn't be doing? Do you give in to them? You need help to eliminate the nag factor.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>What Is The Nag Factor?</a></h2> <p>Actions that children engage in to make their parents buy something is a universal dilemma all parents have to deal with. Teen social media influencers make it worse.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Parents: Rediscover The Power of "No"</a></h2> <p>Today's parents say they can't say no to their children. Their children are bombarded with thousands of "buy" messages prompting demand after demand. Take back your Power of NO!</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How Parental Substance Abuse Affects Children</a></h2> <p>Children who grow up with an addicted parent often experience abuse, neglect, and even overindulgence, and they often become parentified.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Pointing Out Overindulgence to Someone You Care About</a></h2>
<p>Are you concerned that a parent you know and love is overindulging their children? How do you bring up this thorny issue without alienating them? These strategies can help.</p>
<h2><a>The Mental Health Consequences of Parental Overindulgence </a></h2>
<p>Does it really matter if parents overindulge their children? Yes, according to research suggesting that childhood overindulgence is linked to depression, anxiety, and problematic alcohol use in young adults.</p>
<h2><a>What Is Causing Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults?</a></h2>
<p>Emerging adults are experiencing higher rates of depression and anxiety because of the pandemic, unemployment, moving back home, living alone, and dating online.</p>
<div> <h2><a>The Big Challenge: Jumping From Adolescence Into Adulthood</a></h2> <p>Adolescents do not become full-fledged adults at age 18. They first have to successfully navigate a stage of development known as "emerging adulthood."</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Are Your Children Too Busy to Do Chores?</a></h2> <p>When children are not required to do chores, they grow up to become adults who don't have life skills.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Zero Chores During a Pandemic Will Spoil Your Children</a></h2> <p>Children learn valuable life skills by doing chores, but parents who overnurture don't give their children those opportunities.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Childhood Overindulgence Can Lead to Learned Helplessness</a></h2>
<p>Over-nurtured children become helpless. They grow up lacking the skills they need to function as adults. Helpless. Stuck. And in some situations; feeling hopeless.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>A Recipe for Raising Helpless Teenagers</a></h2> <p>When parents overindulge, they unknowingly train children to become helpless, and overindulged children have greater difficulty reaching future goals.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>What Grandparents Can Do When the Parents Are Overindulging</a></h2> <p>Grandparents are in a difficult position when parents overindulge grandchildren.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>5 Things to Do Instead of Overindulging Your Grandkids</a></h2>
<p>Grandparents should set expectations, share their stories and hobbies, model cherished values, and start a college fund instead of overindulging their grandchildren.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>When Grandparents Undermine Parents' Rules</a></h2> <p>Grandparents who refuse to respect parenting choices may pay a big price: limits on the amount of time they spend with their grandchildren. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Do You Believe in Relationship Magic?</a></h2> <p>Individuals who were overindulged as children view their relationship from an external locus of control and think that chance is the cause of their relationship problems.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>I Just Can't Get Over It! I Feel Like I'm in a Fight Club</a></h2> <p>Being overindulged as a child leads to the inability to resolve conflict in adult romantic relationships.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Overindulgence Triangle and Money, Money, Money</a></h2> <p>Stress over money and finances may be at an all-time high for couples.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places</a></h2> <p>Does childhood overindulgence influence our love life? Does it consciously or unconsciously influence the partners we pick and how we interact with them?</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Masks and Social Distancing Through an Overindulgence Lens</a></h2> <p>Is this Me vs. We attitude fueled by childhood overindulgence? I think so.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Links Between Incompetent Parents and Childhood Overindulgence</a></h2>
<p>Parents who overindulge their children lack a global sense of competence, efficacy, and satisfaction with parenting. They become frustrated, anxious, and poorly motivated parents.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How Does It Feel to Be Overindulged as a Child?</a></h2> <p>Were you overindulged as a child? How did it make you feel? Learn how childhood overindulgence has long-lasting effects into adulthood.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Right and Wrong Ways to Parent</a></h2> <p>Part 2: Can you love your children too much? Can you give them too much? What do permissive, authoritarian, and authoritative parents have in common?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>There Is a Right and a Wrong Way to Parent</a></h2> <p>There are many different ways to parent, but are they all effective? Do some parenting styles harm children while other styles help them to grow and flourish?</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Strategies to Teach Children Delayed Gratification</a></h2> <p>Help children to create plans, prioritize their goals, celebrate after reaching a goal, save money, and use positive self-talk.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Strategies to Teach Children Delayed Gratification</a></h2> <p>Self-control can be learned. Here's how parents can teach it. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Is Your Child an Instant Gratifier or a Patient Postponer?</a></h2> <p>Why do some children become able to resist temptation, and other children do not? What does this have to do with childhood overindulgence?</p> </div> </div>

<h1> Should We Give Every Child a Trophy? </h1>
<h2> Here's what can happen to children when they get an award they haven't earned. </h2>
<li>Grandparents voice concerns about the practice of giving every child a trophy to keep them from crying.</li>
<li>The Test of Four is a research-based tool that can be used to determine if this practice is childhood overindulgence.</li>
<li>Only giving a child an award they've earned can teach them to: (1) get better, (2) work harder, and (3) strive to reach their goals.</li>
<p>Recently one of my readers emailed me this question: “Should we give every child a trophy even if they haven’t earned it?”</p>
<h3>Q: Tell me if I’m wrong and if I need to change my thinking...</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Nataliya Vaitkevich/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Let me know your thoughts on this subject. I appreciate any advice forthcoming. </p>
<h3>A: Is this overindulgence?</h3>
<p>My coauthors and I have developed a research-based tool to determine the answer to this question. It is called “The Test of Four.”</p>
<h3>The Test of Four—Dealing with grandson’s tears when he strikes out</h3>
<p>It works this way. You ask four questions. If you get a “Yes” answer to one or more questions, it is most likely overindulgence.</p>
<p>1. Does it get in the way of the child learning a developmental task? If yes, which task? Does it reinforce the early belief that the child is the center of the world?</p>
<p>2. Does it use a disproportionate amount of the family resources (e.g., money, space, time, energy, focus) to meet the wants, not the needs, of one or more of the children?</p>
<p>3. Whose needs? Is this more for the parent than for the child? Does it insist that the child focus on activities that the parent likes but that are counter to the child’s interests and abilities?</p>
<p>A: Yes. My hunch is that it is more for the parent than the child. The parent can’t stand to see the child in any pain and wants to rescue him.</p>
<p>4. Possible harm? Does it deplete or in some way harm others, property, <a>the environment</a>, the community?</p>
<p>A: No. Not at this time. However, if this pattern continues into his <a>adolescence</a> and adulthood, he may get angry when he doesn’t always get his way, and he may learn to strike out at people or even damage property as a result.</p>
<h3>The Test Of Four—Dance recital awards for everyone</h3>
<p>Now let’s take a look at the example of the trophy-giving at your granddaughter’s dance recital.</p>
<p>A: Yes. By buying trophies and ribbons that are not necessary and will probably be thrown away in time.</p>
<p>4. Possible harm? Does it deplete or in some way harm others, property, the environment, or the community?</p>
<p>A: No. The only harm I see is that giving every child a trophy even though they did not earn one can give the child a false sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>So, how many “Yes” answers did you get? I got two in the first scenario and three in the second. According to the Test of Four, which is laid out in <a>this helpful handout,</a> are these actions overindulgence? Yes.</p>
<ol><li>Get mad.</li> <li>Get sad.</li> <li>Get even.</li> <li>Give up.</li> </ol>
<p>I know which lessons I would like parents to teach instead:</p>
<ul><li>Get better.</li> <li>Work harder.</li> <li>Reach for your <a>goals</a>.</li> </ul>
<p>Remember, you can’t change a whole overindulgence culture, but you can change what you do.</p>
<p>Practice Aloha. Do all things with love, grace, and <a>gratitude</a>.</p>

<h1> Post-Infection Illness </h1>
<h2> Long Covid is a concern as it may become a chronic disease. </h2>
<li>Post-infection illness is not new in medicine and can be a cause of chronic disease.</li>
<li>Symptoms of post-Covid include chronic fatigue, exercise intolerance, difficulty breathing, cognitive changes, headaches, dizziness, and more.</li>
<li>Mechanisms that cause post-infection disease are still unclear.</li>
<p>There are delayed effects of many exposures we are subject to, which include not only infectious organisms but also environmental contaminants, radiation, and even necessary therapeutic regimens such as chemotherapy.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Voxelimage from Pixabay/Canva</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In kids, we see post-infectious illnesses such as acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), transverse myelitis (TM), and febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) as examples.</p>

<a>fear</a> in my long Covid patients. It is a fear of who they are now and a fear about who they will be and what will become of them. Living a "new normal" is not easy and living with uncertainty is not ideal. We can only try to live with
<a>gratitude</a> for the now. As Nietzsche once said, "He who has a why to live can bear almost anyhow."

<div> <h3> How do you maintain optimal health? </h3> </div>
<a>sleeping</a> well, you need to be responsible for yourself, manage your time, stay organized, look out for your future self, stay connected, and live life with
<a>meaning, passion, and purpose</a>.
<div> <h3> Why is mental health important for overall well-being? </h3> </div>
<a>sound mind</a> helps your overall health. This entails how we handle everyday
<a>stress</a>, make decisions, maintain our relationships, as well as how we manage our moods and emotions. It also helps to be engaged, creative, and productive.
<div> <h3> Does education impact overall health? </h3> </div>
<a>education</a> shapes our physical and mental health. Research shows that
<a>the higher your education level</a>, the longer you will potentially live, plus those years will likely be healthier. College graduates live almost nine years longer than those who do not graduate from high school.
<div> <h3> Does money impact health? </h3> </div>
<a>context in which we live</a>. Whether or not we can be healthy depends on the air we breathe, the water we drink, the quality of our neighborhoods, our education and family income, the
<a>prejudice</a> we face or do not face, and countless other factors that have little to do with doctors and medicine.
<div> <h3> Does personality impact health? </h3> </div>

<div> <h3> Why is physical activity so important for your health? </h3> </div>
<a>growth and repair</a>; the body can be in a continual state of renewal. Without regular physical activity, a person’s muscles can waste away, hindering movement, then affecting overall health and leading to decline and decay.
<div> <h3> Why is diet so important for your health? </h3> </div>
<a>a lousy diet</a> generates an environment in the body that ages us too quickly and in turn impairs our thinking.
<div> <h3> How can I practice self-care? </h3> </div>
<p>Getting the sleep your body requires.</p>
<p>Exercising or engaging in some form of physical activity (a daily walk, pulling weeds in the garden, or high-intensity interval training).</p>
<p>Visiting the doctor annually.</p>
<p>Meditating or finding some other form of relaxation to reduce stress.</p>
<p>Avoiding excessive use of tech devices.</p>
<p>Setting boundaries with others.</p>
<h2> The Science of Health Psychology </h2>
<div> <h3> Where do you find health psychologists? </h3> </div>
<a>Health psychologists</a> can be found in clinics, hospitals, and public health agencies, as well as in private practice. These practitioners are engaged in such areas of health as
<a>management</a>, oncology, physical rehabilitation,
<a>addiction</a> treatment, eating disorders, among other areas.
<div> <h3> Is health psychology important in the workplace? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Corporate settings also use the help of health psychologists, to promote <a>health and wellness among employees</a>; they also advise on workplace policies and <a>decision-making</a>, generally looking to encourage healthy companies.</p> </div>

<h1> How Physical Activity Safeguards Synapses as We Age </h1>
<h2> Staying active helps to preserve older adults’ synaptic integrity. </h2>
<li>The neuroprotective benefits of physical activity are well established, but exactly how exercise protects the brain is less clear. </li>
<li>New research suggests that staying physically active increases presynaptic protein levels, which preserves synaptic integrity.</li>
<li>Older adults who stay active have more presynaptic proteins and better synaptic integrity, and experience less age-related cognitive decline.</li>

<a>dementia</a>, and age-related
<a>cognitive decline</a> are linked to a loss of synaptic integrity.
<h3>Synaptic Integrity Safeguards the Brain Against Cognitive Decline</h3>

<h3>Late-Life Physical Activity Is Associated With Better Synaptic Integrity</h3>
<a>Casaletto et al., 2022</a>) based on a postmortem analysis of 404 participants from the Rush
<a>news release</a>. "Maintaining the integrity of [synaptic] connections between neurons may be vital to fending off dementia since the synapse is really the site where cognition happens."
<h3>Make Synaptic Integrity a Motivator to Stay Active</h3>
<a>locus of control</a>. If you need a new source of
<a>motivation</a> to stick with an exercise routine, consider the synaptic benefits of physical activity; staying active as you get older may prevent synaptic impairment.
