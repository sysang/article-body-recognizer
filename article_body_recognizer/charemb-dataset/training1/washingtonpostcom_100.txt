<p>“I first dabbled with humour to get my point across in 2007, when I organised a soil science seminar entitled, Big hole, small hole KY Jelly,” she said in an April 2016 interview with TTG Associations, an Asian Pacific trade group.</p>
<p>In response, 139 scientists — including Goldstein — objected to the articles, noting an abundance of peer-reviewed studies on peatland emissions. The letter was published by scientific journal Global Change Biology.</p>
<p>“The oil palm industry is basically an arm of the government,” Goldstein said.</p>
<p>Nicholas Mujah Ason has seen both the cause and the effect of global warming: the sea of oil palm plantations surrounding him and the rainforest that never cools.</p>
<p>Mujah, who has lived in the state of Sarawak most of his life, has been fighting the development since the early 1980s, when he was first jailed for protesting the encroachment of loggers.</p>
<p>“It's not that we hate palm oil,” he said. “We hate how palm oil has been planted into our land.”</p>
<p>His family has lived deep in the rainforest for eight generations, and the 62-year-old has been involved in multiple legal actions as the secretary general of the Sarawak Dayak Iban Association, an Indigenous rights group.</p>
<p>“It’s not like a normal heat that we faced before,” he said. “You’ll feel the biting heat, and your skin will be burned.”</p>
<p>Malaysia’s government has downplayed the palm oil industry’s climate impact across several categories in its U.N. reports.</p>
<p>In 2016, Malaysia claimed that it had not converted a single acre to cropland.</p>
<p>“This is patently untrue,” said Susan Page, an expert on peatlands at the University of Leicester<b> </b>who also signed the letter objecting to presentations at the 2016 International Peat Congress.</p>
<div><div><div><div><p>(Planet Labs)</p></div><div><p>(Planet Labs)</p></div><div><p>(Planet Labs)</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><p>Malaysia reported that not a single acre of land had been converted to cropland in 2016. This satellite image shows an existing oil palm plantation in the Sebauh district of Sarawak, Malaysia, on May 28, 2015.</p>(Planet Labs)</div></div>
<div><div><p>In a study funded by the Malaysian government, scientists documented the expansion of a palm plantation in 2016, shown here.</p>(Planet Labs)</div></div>
<div><div><p>By 2021, satellite images show additional forest clearance. </p>(Planet Labs)</div></div>
<p>And then comes the biggest problem of all.</p>
<p>Malaysia claims an annual forest carbon sink of over <mark>243 million tons</mark> from just about 68,000 square miles of forested area. That‘s not far from what neighboring Indonesia claims for a forest more than five times its size.</p>
<p>The Malaysian government said its reports comply with U.N. guidelines and are subject to rigorous review but did not respond to detailed questions about the country’s land sector reporting.</p>
<p>“It’s not surprising to me that governments are trying to hide pollution,” Hurowitz said, “but it’s shameful they’re getting away with it.”</p>
<h3><b>Tolerating disarray</b></h3>
<p>Jackson believes that the atmosphere is the ultimate check on what countries report — and what they pledge. The gap in the data is an urgent problem.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the United Nations published a “synthesis report,” which forecasts the effect of countries’ climate promises on future emissions and the planet’s temperature.</p>
<b> </b>The United Nations declined to provide its data set to support the number, but did explain a number of steps by which countries numbers’ had been adjusted.
<p>“It is surprising to see that the authors of the U.N. report did not use the original data reported by each country,” said Ciais, who also contributes to the Global Carbon Project.</p>
<p>Saier, the UNFCCC spokesman, defended the approach in an email, saying that “there is indeed a small upscaling.”</p>
<p>In a sense, the UNFCCC adjusted the country numbers to match what science says is being emitted: It closed the gap that The Post found.</p>
<p>From a political perspective, there may not be any other option. Without requiring satellite or atmospheric measurements, richer and poorer countries alike are likely to underreport for years to come.</p>
<p>After all, in the end there is no way to make the Paris agreement, emissions cuts or accurate emissions reports mandatory. Every country reports what it reports and promises what it promises.</p>
<p>“I think that’s part of the reason this is all tolerated, is the sense that, at least the countries are providing something and participating and thinking about it,” said Jackson.</p>
<p>“That’s why people tolerate this disarray, because the alternative is for them to walk away.”</p>
<p>But Jackson is an optimist.</p>
<p>“I believe information is powerful. Data and information have not nudged the climate world as quickly as I wished it had,” he said. “But I’m still naively hoping to leave the world better for my kids than I found it.”</p>

<div><header><div><h1>Climate change fuels a water rights conflict built on over a century of broken promises</h1></div></header></div>
<div><p>Extreme drought and wildfires in the Upper Northwest have further imperiled an already fragile Klamath River Basin.</p></div>
<div><p>Fish are dying from disease that proliferates in warm water and low flows. </p></div>
<div><p>Farmers don't have enough water to sustain crops. </p></div>
<div><p>And hundreds of families are without water after their wells dried up. </p></div>
<div><span><div>Mason Trinca</div> and </span></div>
<div><span><div>Alice Li</div></span></div>
<p>The simple way to think about this crisis: There’s no longer enough water to go around to meet the needs of farmers and Native American populations as well as fish and birds.</p>
<p>But this year, the region buckled under one of the worst droughts ever recorded.</p>
<p>For generations, Native Americans lived and fished in what was called the Everglades of the West. The channels of the watershed reached from remnants of ancient Lake Modoc in southern Oregon across the California line to the Pacific coast.</p>
<p>The federal government also monitors the water levels in the lake to protect endangered fish essential to tribal life.</p>
<p>[Reservoirs are drying up as consequences of the Western drought worsen]</p>
<p>The extreme effects of climate-related drought have worsened a long-existing conflict between Native Americans and farmers and ranchers, all fighting for the resource essential to their survival.</p>
<div><p>The shores of Upper Klamath Lake were once covered by marshes and wetlands. Development and human intervention have eroded the ecosystem's natural cycle.</p></div>
<div><p>The consequences have been felt by tribes and others who fish downstream on the Klamath River. </p></div>
<div><p>Tribal leaders say the endangered fish are a warning of a larger disruption to the entire watershed. </p></div>
<h4>The Everglades of the West</h4>
<p>The Klamath Tribes have fought for decades to keep the one right the federal government had guaranteed: the ability to hunt and fish on land taken from them.</p>
<p>Unrestricted cattle grazing upstream releases phosphorus into the lake, and as water levels fall due to irrigation, the concentration of contaminants kills the fish, Gonyaw said.</p>
<p>Development along the shores of the lake has also upset the balance. Without wetlands to filter out the contaminants, toxic algae thrives, ultimately suffocating the juvenile fish.</p>
<p>When the group reached the Upper Klamath Lake in 1846, Klamath people killed three of them. In retaliation, Fremont’s party slaughtered more than a dozen Klamath people on the lakeshore.</p>
<p>That violence, not the first racist and hostile action toward the Indigenous people of Klamath, “kind of set a tone,” Gentry said, “just because people wanted what our people had.”</p>
<p>The government had promised fishing rights and water forever to the tribes.</p>
<p>“The tables are turning now,” Gosnell said. “The power dynamics are changing, and it’s really hard for the irrigators to come to terms with.”</p>
<p>[California's Chinook salmon population is disappearing]</p>
<p>“When you dam a river, when you divert a river, when you change the river from what it’s used to doing for millions and millions of years,” McCovey said, “some things will suffer and others will prosper.”</p>
<div><p>Without water distribution this year, many farmers struggle to irrigate and have to let some acreage remain dry. </p></div>
<div><p>Angry and frustrated, they say their livelihood is at stake. </p></div>
<div><p>Many share what water there is.</p></div>
<h4>Rich farmland and an ‘old-fashioned pickle jar’</h4>
<p>Cutting off water from the Klamath Project also threatens a way of life and a legacy for many farmers.</p>
<p>They are worried, angry and frustrated. Some are struggling to pay employees and meet demand from distributors. Many are resourceful, sharing what water there is.</p>
<p>All have felt the weight of a historically parched year.</p>
<p>Protests erupted, and Native Americans were hung in effigy, Gosnell said. During one rally, a brigade passed buckets filled with water from Upper Klamath Lake, dumping it into the main canal that feeds the project.</p>
<p>[The Northern Hemisphere has a punishing heat wave infestation]</p>
<b> </b>or less of its average production, with no water from the project. He buys water from his local district wells and also has been irrigating with water his neighbors have shared from their private wells.
<div><p>The region's wildlife also are imperiled. Two important sanctuaries are almost bone-dry. </p></div>
<div><p>In normal years, runoff water from irrigators replenishes the refuges. This year, the refuges received no water from the Klamath Project.</p></div>
<div><p>Along the canals, wells have run dry and hundreds have turned to bottled water, in another consequence of an imperfect system. </p></div>
<h4>Wildlife and waterfowl in peril</h4>
<p>Also suffering are wildlife whose protected habitats rely on Klamath Project water.</p>
<p>The water demands of the entire region are so complex that solving one deficit creates several more someplace else.</p>
<div><div><div><p>Link River Dam in Klamath Falls, Ore., on July 30. The dam holds water of the Upper Klamath Lake for irrigation.</p></div></div></div>
<h4>‘Everyone is suffering’ and ‘nobody wins’</h4>
<p>As Gosnell explains it, the agreement’s success came from compromise.</p>
<p>For now, the basin remains fractured.</p>
<b>“</b>And we’re to the point where we don’t have a whole lot left to give. We don’t have a whole lot left to sacrifice.”
<p>Court rulings have affirmed the Klamath Tribes’ water rights. Farmers, who once were favored by water allotment, are even more frustrated.</p>
<p>[How to cope with the existential dread of climate change]</p>
<p>As is in nature, everything is interconnected.</p>
<b> </b>But, she said, restoration is only part of the solution. The physical challenges can’t be overcome without addressing the human ones.
<p>Part of that, Gosnell said, is returning land to the tribes.</p>
<p>Despite the suffering and the tensions this year, some remain optimistic the people of the basin can find common cause and new solutions.</p>
<p>"Farming is a profession of hope,” Hill said, “if the sun’s going to shine and the rain’s going to come, crops are going to grow.”</p>

<div><h1>After decades, some of America’s most toxic sites will finally get cleaned up</h1></div>
<h2>New funding and the revival of a long-lapsed tax on chemical makers in the bipartisan infrastructure law mean cities like Newark will get money to restore toxic Superfund sites</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Dino Grandoni</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 17, 2021 at 11:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet the groundwater beneath the 4.4-acre expanse once occupied by White Chemical Corp. in Newark remains contaminated, given a lack of federal funding.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This work is just the beginning,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement.</p></div></div>
<p>Many of these sites are also in poor and minority communities, such as Newark, where most residents are African American. Biden has said easing the pollution burden that Black, Latino and Native Americans bear is central to his environmental policy.</p>
<div><div><p>No state boasts more Superfund sites than New Jersey. Some of them, such as the White Chemical site, have lingered on the agency’s “priorities list” for decades.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>White Chemical Corp. first arrived in Newark in 1983, moving from across the bay in Bayonne to lease factory space. For seven years, it manufactured fire retardants and acids.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To cut costs, its<b> </b>president, James White, kept tens of thousands of precariously stacked and deteriorating drums, boxes and vats stewing with<b> </b>dangerous byproducts on-site.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the work there is still incomplete. As the Superfund program’s budget dropped, so did the pace of cleanups in Newark and across the nation.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here's how Biden's unwinding Trump's environmental legacy</p></div>
<div><div><p>By the early 2000s, the trust fund was <a>drained</a>. The agency has grappled with a mounting list of costly and complex hazardous waste sites ever since.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When the taxes were in place, cleanups were happening faster,” said Danielle Melgar, an anti-toxics advocate with the nonprofit U.S. Public Interest Research Group.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Trump administration, despite <a>reversing several high-profile pollution rules</a>, drew praise from Superfund advocates for <a>accelerating</a> the rate of cleanups.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The new bipartisan infrastructure <a>law</a> reestablishes fees on<b> </b>the sale of more than 40 chemicals often found in fuels, plastics and other products, ranging from 44 cents to $9.74 per ton<b> </b>depending on the compound.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The American Chemistry Council (ACC) and other groups lobbied unsuccessfully to defeat the proposal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“So we’re also going to be accelerating our cleanups in sites where and in areas where we have overburdened communities and vulnerable populations,” Waterhouse said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But many Newark residents, including Freeman, have heard similar promises from other politicians and bureaucrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We want what we were promised,” Freeman said. “We want stores. We want redevelopment in this particular area of the South Ward.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With the groundwater still polluted, the city of Newark can only lease the former factory site as a commercial parking lot. Car-carrying trailers loudly clang up and down the avenue.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I can’t stand these trucks,” said Chris Butler as he waited for a bus home. A counselor at a substance abuse center on Frelinghuysen, he said he didn’t know that he worked across the street from a toxic site.</p></div>
<b> </b>it cost $16.6 million. But with the tax reinstated
<b> </b>and with Congress providing an additional $3.5 billion for the Superfund program, work in Newark and on dozens of other orphaned sites will begin “as soon as possible,” according to the agency.
<a>a 2019 report</a> by the Government Accountability Office.
<a>60 percent of Superfund sites</a>, mainly due to flooding. More than a dozen Superfund sites
<a>flooded</a> after Hurricane Harvey struck the Texas Gulf Coast in 2017.
<b> </b>In Newark, even a Category 1 hurricane could damage the White Chemical site, the GAO said.
<div><div><p>Residents have become accustomed to seeing Frelinghuysen Avenue flood during heavy storms.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was like a river,” said Wynnie-Fred Victor Hinds, an activist and co-chair of the Newark Environmental Commission, who drove by the road after heavy rain this past summer.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You can’t get away from it,” she added. “People are faced with this all the time.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Reviving the chemical production fee is a step toward making the Superfund program operate as originally intended, with industry paying to clean up its messes even after companies go bankrupt. The tax will be up for renewal again in 2031.</p></div>
<b> </b>The proposed fee — which would start at 16.4 cents per barrel and rise with inflation — has sparked a new lobbying fight on Capitol Hill.
<b> </b>push to remedy toxic dumping in the Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls, N.Y., in the 1970s helped spur the creation of the Superfund program.
<div><p>But Stephen Comstock, vice president for corporate policy at the American Petroleum Institute, argued in an email that “existing funding mechanisms appropriately ensure responsible parties pay for cleaning up the sites.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We want places where our residents can sit out and drink coffee,” Freeman said. “We don’t want to become a neighborhood full of trucks and scrap cars.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>For the first time in over 30 years, the EPA adds to its list of hazardous air pollutants</h1></div>
<h2>The move will allow the Environmental Protection Agency to curb the use of 1-bromopropane, a powerful dry-cleaning solvent linked to cancer</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Dino Grandoni</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 6:22 p.m. EST|Updated today at 8:52 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>It took over three decades, but the federal government finally expanded its list of chemicals too dangerous for Americans to breathe.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>By one.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that it took so long to add a single compound to a list Congress established in 1990 underscores the bureaucratic inertia that impedes any effort to protect Americans from harmful chemicals that businesses use every year.</p></div>
<p>“Putting it on the list was supposed to be easy,” said Adam M. Finkel, who used to direct the health standards programs at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and warned of the dangers of 1-bromopropane 20 years ago.</p>
<div><div><p>“I hate the term no-brainer, but this is a no-brainer,” he added. “It’s a toxic air pollutant, so it belongs on the list of toxic air pollutants.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Here are Biden's new environmental policies</p></div>
<a>mercury</a> and lead — if it is “reasonably” anticipated to harm humans or the environment.
<div><div><p>The agency was supposed to make a decision within 18 months. But the delays spanned three presidencies.</p></div></div>
<p>Earthjustice senior attorney Tosh Sagar, whose group sued the EPA over the chemical, said its regulators “have trouble consistently following the law that Congress laid out in terms of protecting people” no matter who is president.</p>
<p>Obama administration officials didn’t draft a proposal approving the request until his last month in office, in 2017. The Trump administration <a>granted</a> the petition in 2020 but indefinitely delayed adding it to the hazardous list.</p>
<div><div><p>“It’s taken them this long to act,” said Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance Executive Director Faye Graul, whose members manufacture alternative chemicals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But officials at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry’s main lobbying arm in Washington, said they remain leery because the EPA has not yet said how it will curb the pollutant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The EPA is planning to propose a “regulatory infrastructure” for adding the chemical to the hazardous pollutant list this year, EPA spokesman Nick Conger said. It aims to finalize that rule by early 2023, he added.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Biden administration moves to curtail toxic ‘forever chemicals’</p></div>
<a>a group of dangerous, long-lasting chemicals</a> called polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS, found in an array of cleaning supplies, cosmetics and other products.
<div><div><p>“So this is a good thing, both from the precedential level, but also for protecting people from this pollutant,” he said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, has said that she was the “most trolled person” in the world, referring to the online abuse she received in 2019, a year she partially spent on maternity leave.</p></div></div>
<p>Now, a report released Tuesday by Twitter analytics provider Bot Sentinel indicates Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, were the target of a coordinated hate campaign on that platform, bolstering the couple’s claim of widespread harassment.</p>
<div><div><p>Some of the tweets used coded racist language, according to Bot Sentinel, which said that Meghan, who is biracial, was the subject of about 80 percent of the harassment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The pattern that emerged from how these accounts interact with one another was not “organic,” the report said, suggesting a coordinated effort to amplify harassment of the royal couple.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Most of the hate tweets appeared to be generated by humans, Bot Sentinel chief executive Christopher Bouzy said in an email. “We looked for automated accounts and found very little evidence of bot activity.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Representatives for Harry and Meghan could not immediately be reached for comment early Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Four of the 55 primary accounts pinpointed by Tuesday’s report have been suspended for violating the platform’s policies, according to a Twitter spokesperson.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the company said it found no evidence of “widespread coordination, the use of multiple accounts by single people, or other platform manipulation tactics.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Meghan and Harry’s explosive interview reveals how the royal family’s racism lingers</p></div>
<div><p>The operators of those accounts were savvy at social media, he told <a>BuzzFeed News,</a> noting that they used measures such as temporarily making accounts private and weaving in non-Sussex<b> </b>content to help evade detection.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The Sussexes declined to name any person who allegedly made those comments. Winfrey later said the couple had told her that neither the queen nor her husband had made those remarks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last year, the couple said they would <a>distance themselves</a> from palace life and senior royal duties. Their official Instagram account, which has some 10 million followers, has not been updated since March 2020.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Estranged dad Thomas Markle calls Meghan and Harry ‘lost souls’ who are ‘cheapening’ the royal family to make money</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By William Booth</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 22, 2020</div></div>
<p>LONDON — Thomas Markle, the estranged father of Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, appeared on a British television documentary Wednesday night and said he thinks Prince Harry and his daughter are "cheapening" the royal family to make money.<b/></p>
<p>The 1½ -hour-long documentary, “Thomas Markle: My Story,” aired on Britain’s Channel 5. It showcased Meghan’s 75-year-old father venting about his daughter, alternately saying quite harsh and quite needful things.</p>
<div><div><p>“I can’t see her reaching out to me, especially now,” Markle said. “I think both of them are turning into lost souls at this point.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said, “I don’t know what they’re looking for. I don’t think they know what they are looking for.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the documentary, Markle trashes his daughter while proclaiming his love. Many might find it must-see but sad TV, on a channel that features “Dogs Behaving (Very) Badly” and “Bad Girls Behind Bars.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Markle, a retired TV lighting director living in Mexico, imagines his own death. “The last time they might see me is being lowered into the ground,” said Meghan’s father, who has struggled with multiple health issues.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He said that Meghan long ago promised him she would look after him in his senior years. “I’m 75 years old,” Markle said. “It’s time to look after daddy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The retiree said he lives off $5,600 a month, though he said he did receive $20,000 from Meghan. He said he paid for her university and apartment rentals when she was getting started.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Markle says he has been cast aside by the couple and the palace: “I don’t think at this point they’re thrilled to see me or want to talk to me.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For many, Markle plays the villain. Others think he has been treated shabbily.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Duchess of Sussex is now suing the Mail on Sunday for publishing the letter. The Mail has responded in court that Meghan assumed her letter would be widely distributed and that her personal life, as a senior royal, was newsworthy.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In the end, only Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland, attended. Meghan walked solo partway down the aisle before being accompanied by Harry’s father, Prince Charles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In his remarks, Markle suggests that his daughter has thrown a good thing away.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Every young girl wants to become a princess, and she got that, and now . . . it looks like she’s tossing that away for money,” he told Channel 5.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yet Meghan isn’t a young girl. At 38, she’s a previously divorced, successful American actress, with a new husband and an 8-month-old son.</p></div></div>
<p>Her husband is worth an estimated $30 million, inherited from his mother, Princess Diana, and his great-grandmother, the queen mother. Meghan is thought to have made $6 million from her years on the television show “Suits.”</p>
<p>What they could earn as financially independent global “influencers” is unknown. Although they will no longer be working royals, they will be expected to conduct themselves in a way that doesn’t reflect badly on the royal family.</p>
<div><div><p>On the Channel 5 broadcast, Markle refers to the $3 million home renovation done at taxpayer expense for the couple’s home in England, Frogmore Cottage, a five-bedroom historic mansion near Windsor Castle.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“Apparently $3 million and a 26-bedroom home isn’t enough for them. It’s kind of embarrassing to me,” said Markle, confusing the number of bedrooms at Kensington Palace, Harry and Meghan’s former abode.</p></div>
<div><div><p>In a promotional clip before the show was aired, Markle complained that Harry and Meghan were turning the royal family into “a Walmart with a crown on it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harry said that away from the palace and their royal lives, the couple hoped for “a more peaceful life.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The 35-year-old prince called the news media “a powerful force” that needs to be countered and suggested that intrusions by the press were one of the reasons they chose to quit their royal roles and go to Canada.</p></div></div>

<p>A jury in Florida found that Gawker Media, the owner of a popular celebrity and news site, invaded the privacy of the former pro wrestler known as Hulk Hogan by posting excerpts of a sex tape involving him, and awarded him $115 million in damages.</p>
<p>A six-person jury — four women and two men — in St. Petersburg on Friday found for the 62-year-old Hogan and awarded him $55 million in compensatory damages plus an additional $60 million for emotional distress.</p>
<p>The mustachioed and heavily muscled Hogan became famous as a pro wrestling character in the 1980s. Clem had been one of his close friends.</p>
<p>During closing remarks, Hogan’s attorney, Kenneth Turkel, sought to portray Hogan as “a regular family guy” who was hurt by Gawker’s actions.</p>
<p>Gawker’s defense team, meanwhile, challenged those arguments during the two-week trial, saying Hogan acknowledged on the tape that he knew he was being recorded and later bragged about his sexual prowess.</p>
<p>In his closing remarks, Sullivan also said that Gawker’s then-editor, A.J. Daulerio, had acted legally and without “malice” — an argument the jury rejected.</p>
<p>He also said Hogan never sought therapy for his purported emotional distress.</p>
<p>Cole said during the trial that her then-husband had urged her to have sex with Hogan as part of their “open” marriage. Clem did not testify.</p>
<p>Jurors weren’t shown the video during the trial but were permitted to see it during deliberations.</p>
<p>The unsealed documents include text messages between Hogan and Clem, Clem’s deposition testimony, and a settlement agreement between Hogan and Clem that involved a $5,000 payment by Hogan.</p>
<p>Hogan sobbed after the jury’s verdict was released.</p>

<div><div><p>Meghan contended that because the contents of the letter were private and concerned personal matters that were not of legitimate public interest, she enjoyed a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The appeals court agreed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement on Royal Sussex stationery, Meghan applauded the decision as “a victory not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what’s right.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Estranged dad Thomas Markle calls Meghan and Harry ‘lost souls’ who are ‘cheapening’ the royal family to make money</p></div>
<div><div><p>In the 2018 letter, she begged him to stop talking to the press, saying that “your actions have broken my heart into a million pieces.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meghan sued the newspaper for invasion of privacy and copyright infringement following articles published in 2019 that featured extensive segments of the five-page handwritten letter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Earlier this year, High Court Judge Mark Warby ruled in favor of Meghan, saying that the infringement was so clear-cut that there was no reason for a trial.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The ruling Thursday by the Court of Appeal upheld the decision that there was no further need for a hearing on the matter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Mark Stephens, an expert in media law at Howard Kennedy, a London-based law firm, agreed that the case set a precedent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Previously, the Mail on Sunday could have expected the case to go to trial, he said, if it were able to successfully argue that the letter was always meant for public consumption.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meghan contended that the appeal by the Mail on Sunday’s owners was cynical and designed to create more headlines.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During the appeal, lawyers for the Mail on Sunday revealed that Meghan and Harry were highly involved in managing their public relations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The appeals court heard that Jason Knauf, Meghan’s former press secretary, said in a witness statement that Meghan wrote the letter to her estranged father with the understanding that it could be leaked to the press.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meghan took direct aim at Lord Jonathan Rothermere, owner of the Mail on Sunday, saying he had broken the law.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The story was at the top of the BBC’s homepage under the banner headline “Meghan wins ruling in Mail on Sunday privacy fight.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Marianna Sotomayor</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Paul Kane</div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 5:54 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Former vice president Richard B. Cheney visited the House floor on Thursday and patiently waited to greet more than a dozen members waiting to shake his hand.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>They were all Democrats.</p></div></div>
<p>Cheney and his daughter Rep. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) are among the few Republicans who have joined Democrats in condemning last year’s attack on the Capitol as an assault on democracy and blaming former president Donald Trump for that deadly day.</p>
<div><div><p>They were the only two Republicans on the House floor Thursday for an event to mark the anniversary of the attack, but they were hardly alone.</p></div></div>
<p>One by one, Democrats put aside their fierce and lasting policy divides with the Cheneys to thank them for condemning the attack and Trump’s continued effort to undermine the 2020 presidential election results with his false claims of fraud.</p>
<div><div><p>“It was great coming back. I think Liz is doing a hell of a job, and I’m here to support her,” Cheney told reporters upon leaving the House floor.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Asked to reflect on Republican leaders’ decision not to show up on Thursday to mark the anniversary of the attack, Cheney said he could no longer recognize the party he helped lead as House minority whip and then vice president.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s not a leadership that resembles any of the folks I knew when I was here for 10 years,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Neither Cheney has moderated their positions on any number of conservative issues they have held over the years, but their determination to take on Trump and call out fellow Republicans is more than enough for Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Liz Cheney was in the chamber during the insurrection and became one of the only House Republicans to pointedly blame Trump for instigating the most violent attack on the Capitol since British forces set it on fire in 1814.</p></div></div>
<div><p>House Republicans oust Cheney for calling out Trump’s false election claims, minimize Jan. 6 attack on Capitol</p></div>
<div><div><p>When her father left office in 2009, it was hard to imagine what would cause him to be rejected by Republicans and embraced by Democrats.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During his time as vice president, his relationship with Democrats was marked by bitter disagreements, particularly over the Iraq War, that often went beyond policy disagreements and into questions of character and patriotism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pelosi and Cheney had an acrimonious relationship of their own.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney said in 2007 that if Pelosi was successful at preventing a U.S. troop increase in Iraq it would “validate the al-Qaeda strategy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Pelosi demanded an apology, saying Cheney had questioned her patriotism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He declined and said he didn’t question her patriotism, just her judgment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s what I believe,” she told CNN. “I think he’s proud of it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Thursday, those old tensions were put aside as they focused on their shared feelings about Jan. 6.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) also applauded Cheney for his daughter’s courage during a lengthier conversation in which both men were overheard talking about other news of day such as testing frequently for the coronavirus.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Back in 2004, at a time when Sen. Patrick J. Leahy and other Democrats accused Cheney’s old company, Halliburton, of profiting off the Iraq War, the Vermont Democrat approached the vice president on the Senate floor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Hey Dick,” Leahy recalled saying in an interview Thursday, “why don’t you talk to the Democratic side?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cheney wasn’t amused.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“F--- yourself,” he told Leahy before complaining about the Democrat’s recent comments about him.</p></div></div>
<div><p><span>Cheney dismisses critic with obscenity</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>But like for many Democrats, Cheney’s public support for his daughter’s outspoken anti-Trump vows has softened Leahy’s feelings toward the elder Cheney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He said that the younger Cheney’s actions remind him of the stories he heard when he first arrived in Washington in 1975.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They thought it was a thing they had to do,” said Leahy, who watched Liz Cheney’s media appearances Thursday morning. “And that’s what I was thinking of, more than anything else.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Tyler Pager</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Annie Linskey</div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 8:00 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Throughout the first year of Joe Biden’s presidency, Donald Trump was the name that shalt not be spoken.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But Biden and his aides largely refused to talk about Trump or react to him, calculating that doing so might provoke Trump and risk elevating his standing by giving him and his rhetoric more media attention than they already have.</p></div>
<p>Inside the White House, meanwhile, the president and his team strategized about when and how to break his silence. They decided to do so, finally, Thursday, as the nation paused to mark the one-year anniversary of the deadly attack on the Capitol.</p>
<p>Biden, who was deeply involved in the framing and writing of the speech, worked on it with advisers including Donilon; Jon Meacham, a historian who has advised Biden on messaging; and Vinay Reddy, the White House director of speechwriting.</p>
<div><div><p>Trump had initially planned to hold a news conference Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, but he canceled it abruptly. He said he plans to address the events of Jan. 6 at a rally in Arizona next weekend.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Many Democrats have been restless, wanting to see Biden denounce Trump’s subversion of democracy sooner, more forcefully and with repetition.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I hope this moment does mark a turning point,” Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) said after Biden spoke. “We need to talk about Donald Trump, what his presidency meant for this country.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Bush said Biden has a responsibility to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to speak out against Trump because more vulnerable communities who have been active in protesting the former president remain at risk from his agenda.</p></div>
<p>Biden allies dismissed these concerns, however. House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.) said the president was at “his finest hour” on Thursday, arguing that it is best to criticize Trump directly only at specific moments.</p>
<div><div><p>A coalition of voting rights groups in Georgia said Thursday that Biden and Harris should skip their trip to Atlanta unless they detail a concrete plan to pass voting rights legislation in Congress.</p></div></div>
<p>“Not addressing this clear and present and direct threat on American elections is a fool’s errand,” she said. “It is a recipe for disaster. It is a concession and a pathway for Trump to return to the White House.”</p>
<div><div><p>Ufot said Biden has not adequately confronted the Republican Party’s efforts to roll back access to voting.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Former Ohio governor John Kasich, a Republican who crossed party lines to endorse Biden in 2020 because of the Democrat’s unity message, said he has been let down by the president’s inability to fulfill that promise.</p></div>
<p>“He ran as a conciliator, and he hasn’t been,” Kasich said. “End of story, and maybe he can change and become one.” He argued that Biden’s expansive liberal agenda has alienated large swaths of the country.</p>
<div><div><p>Biden’s aides said Thursday’s speech was a continuation of the themes that compelled Biden to run, with the president even repeating the slogan that was at the center of his campaign.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I said it many times and it’s no more true or real than when we think about the events of January 6th: We are in a battle for the soul of America,” Biden said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a member of the Jan. 6 select committee, said the threats to democracy extend beyond just Trump and now animate the Republican Party. Raskin said that Democrats, including Biden, must be clear about that.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who also sits on the Jan. 6 committee, said fellow Democrats should avoid amplifying Trump’s statements, but that the country cannot afford to fully ignore his words and actions.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Biden made clear on Thursday that he agreed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I will stand in this breach,” he said. “I will defend this nation and allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of democracy.”</p></div></div>
