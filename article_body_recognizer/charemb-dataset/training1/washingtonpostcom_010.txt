<div><div><p>The speed that hydrofoils add to boats transformed the world of competitive sailing, but it has nothing on the dizzying rate of CJ Perez’s ascent in the sport.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After starting to sail at 13, the Honolulu native turned 18 just in time to take her place aboard a state-of-the-art catamaran in October and compete in the world’s top sailing league.</p></div></div>
<p>“I’ve been given so much,” Perez said, “and I feel it is a part of my responsibility to also give back and try to break down these barriers that have historically excluded many people in the sailing community.”</p>

<div><div><p>The Ocean Race, sailing’s other traditional heavyweight crewed event, has since incorporated foiling, as have the <a>Olympics</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s the future,” Spithill said. “That’s what people want to do.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Daniela and CJ both bring to our team an impressive amount of foiling ability, which is paramount to racing at this level,” Spithill <a>said</a> then.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>It also helped, he noted, that the now 15-year-old O’pen Skiff is a faster vessel than most of its predecessors, and thus Perez had less of an adjustment to make to foiling speeds.
<div><div><p>Describing older sailboat models as “bathtubs with sails,” Sayre said they did not provide as appealing an entry into the sport.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s like learning with a typewriter when these kids are used to iPhones,” he said. “So she learned with an iPhone and just took off from there.”</p></div></div>

<a>Foiling First</a>, which is meant to provide both a pathway to the sport’s higher levels and another avenue for diversity.
<div><p>For Perez, who joined Spithill and other team members several weeks ago in a Foiling First camp in Chicago, the program is important because it could help “increase accessibility for communities less exposed to sailing.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Everyone should have the opportunity to experience this sport,” Perez added, “and have a shot at pursuing it to the highest level.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In that light, Perez declared that foiling was not just an exciting version of sailing but “a rebirth.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“It’s been tough getting people to just wear masks,” she said. “We haven’t seen a lot of change.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Portland Pie Co. currently follows all Maine (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) and U.S. CDC guidance specific to restaurants,” Perkins said in a statement to the <a>Portland Press Herald</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>Texas</a> have notified their customers of closures related to positive tests and potential coronavirus exposures. In New York City — where restaurant workers and diners are required to provide proof of vaccination —
<a>many</a> restaurants are closed because of the surge.
<div><p>Restaurants are closing again as staff test positive for coronavirus amid omicron surge</p></div>
<a>data tracked by The Post</a>. Deaths and hospitalizations are up, but not at a higher rate than other states with much larger totals.
<div><div><p>With 76 percent of its population vaccinated, Maine is among the states with the highest vaccination rate in the country — and is outpacing the national rate of 62 percent.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the statewide increase in cases, the Portland City Council voted Monday to repeal the city’s emergency order, ending a coronavirus hazard pay provision that had increased the minimum wage from $13 to $19.50.</p></div></div>
<a>Maine Beacon</a>. “And how are we adding equity as a top issue we want to tackle in Portland without actually providing financial compensation to those who need it?”
<div><div><p>The city council also voted to implement an indoor mask mandate, with an exception made for businesses that require workers to be vaccinated, according to the <a>Press Herald</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Saxon said she started working at Portland Pie Co. in August 2020, partly because of how seriously the company took pandemic precautions for its workers.</p></div></div>
<p>When she asked management what it would take to reinstitute a mask mandate, Saxon was allegedly told that Portland Pie Co. “didn’t want to deal with any blowback” of losing employees who might not want to wear masks at work.</p>
<div><div><p>“We couldn’t afford to lose people who didn’t wear masks,” she told The Post. “It was disappointing they didn’t want to do the safe thing.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Some GOP leaders are scornful or silent about booster shots seen as key to fighting omicron</p></div>
<div><div><p>She noted on social media how she once asked management if the restaurant should put up a “masks recommended” sign on the door. She wrote she was told no, “because it would scare people away.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are not going to be here that long — this is not how people should be treated,” Crowley, 21, told the Press Herald. “It is not worth the money.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The breaking point came Sunday, said Saxon, shortly after employees found out about another positive test and another possible exposure.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There was a point yesterday that we were talking about it, talking to the staff and said, ‘Let’s leave, this place is ridiculous,’ ” Crowley told the newspaper.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>McAndrew hopes the place she worked at on and off for seven years does the right thing to improve safety measures, but she is uncertain about whether that will happen.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Saxon said the anger from management has been overshadowed in recent days by the pride and camaraderie from the Portland Pie Co. employees who’ve taken a stand for better health measures at their workplace.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div><div>Opinion by the <div>Editorial Board</div></div></div></div><div>March 16, 2021</div></div>
<a>wrote</a> over the summer, the mantra is helpful as shorthand for an essential truth: We need to reimagine public safety.
<p>Over-reliance on police is preventing us from imagining and investing in other public safety tools — ones that could revitalize the struggling neighborhoods that experience the most crime.</p>
<p>Simply put: We need new tools.</p>
<header><div><div><h3>PART 2</h3></div><h2>Whom can we call for help? Police should not always be the only option.</h2></div></header>
<p>Rayshard Brooks was killed by a police officer in Atlanta after Wendy’s employees called the cops to complain that a man, asleep in his car, was blocking the drive-through lane.</p>
<a>saying</a>, “I placed a phone call for my brother to get help. Not for my brother to get lynched.”
<a>reported</a>, Mr. Shultz has spent 1 out of every 3 nights of the past nine years in jail and has more than $40,000 of debt from court costs, fines and fees.
<p>In each of these instances, was law enforcement really the best public safety tool?</p>
<p>What if, instead of the police, the Wendy’s staff had been able to call an unarmed community patrol worker — perhaps a neighbor who knew Brooks — to drive him home or to a sober-up station for the night?</p>
<p>What if instead of facing armed police officers while in the agony of a mental breakdown, Prude had been assisted by a crisis worker and a medic who were trained to de-escalate the situation and could connect him to mental health crisis services?</p>
<p>What if instead of being repeatedly arrested for trespassing, people without homes such as Mr. Shultz were given the medical care they so often need and offered transport to a shelter?</p>
<p>[How should we reimagine public safety? Editorial writer Emefa Addo Agawu answered your questions in a live chat. Read the transcript.]</p>
<p>There will also always be murkier situations in<b> </b>which the presence of someone authorized to use force could prevent harm by de-escalating conflict but might also lethally escalate the situation.</p>

<p>A vacant lot in Philadelphia was transformed into a park-like environment by the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. </p>
<b> </b>vacant lots were transformed into neat, grass-covered areas surrounded by low fences. The intervention was cheap — about $1.50 per square foot for the initial makeover and only 15 cents per square foot each year for maintenance.

<h3>More ways to reimagine safety</h3>
<header><div><div><h3>PART 4</h3></div><h2>If we really wanted to prevent violence, we’d focus our resources on those at highest risk</h2></div></header>
<p>Murder, and the unspeakable trauma it unleashes, animates some of society’s harshest intuitions in the criminal justice system. But deadly violence is often misunderstood in ways that fundamentally distort our approach to addressing it.</p>
<span>And study after study confirms what community members and police officers know well: Most of the violence is driven by a small number of individuals — mostly disadvantaged young men — who share social bonds.<sup>*</sup></span>
<span>These are fights that escalate and turn deadly when someone pulls a weapon, when there are long-standing grudges held between groups competing for territory, and when retaliatory killings try to even a morbid score.<sup>*</sup></span>

<p>What could community institutions do better than police if we adequately invested in them?</p>
<p>Whatever failures neighborhood public safety coalitions have, they won’t look like that. And just imagine what success could look like.</p>
<h3>Emergency management governance is our safety net. It’s not a good one.</h3>

<h5>Opinion by Chloe Cockburn</h5>
<header><div><div><h3>PART 6</h3></div><h2>It will be hard for communities to check police without addressing their unions.</h2></div></header>
<p>We have focused on the need to reimagine public safety and invest in non-policing tools. But another step is key in preventing the brutal excesses of policing that brought thousands of outraged Americans to the streets last spring and summer.</p>
<p>So if there is widespread agreement that police forces need to reform, what is the obstacle? In too many cases, it’s police unions. To make reforms possible, we need to reduce unions’ ability to shield police from overdue accountability.</p>
<p>In many instances, it’s easier and cheaper to simply pay the offending officer to leave the police force than to fire them. The officer who fatally shot Philando Castile received almost $50,000 to not return to the force.</p>
<div><p><span>If any meaningful reforms are to take root, communities must contend with police unions and their organized hostility toward accountability and reform.<sup>*</sup></span></p></div>

<p>“The current criminal justice system … was not designed to eliminate the conditions in which most crime breeds.”</p>
<p>This simple observation comes from the final report of the Kerner Commission, convened by President Lyndon B. Johnson to investigate the causes of the racial uprisings that roiled the nation in 1967. It remains true — a half-century later.</p>

<div><p>Americans are now being taken hostage more often by foreign governments than by terrorist, militant and other groups.</p></div>
<div><p>Early this century, non-state groups held U.S. nationals hostage around the world. In the mid-2000s, kidnappings increased in Iraq and the Niger Delta.</p></div>
<div><p>As global kidnappings persisted in 2012, jihadist and militant groups increasingly abducted and executed Americans in Afghanistan and Syria.</p></div>
<div><p>Western military action helped cut hostage-taking by non-state actors in 2015 as the number of Americans wrongfully detained by foreign governments for political leverage began to climb.</p></div>
<p>Although American hostages are more likely to be killed by terrorist groups such as the Islamic State, they are held longer when detained by foreign governments. But lethality and long sentences alone are not a measure of the cost of these crimes.</p>
<a>Venezuela</a> are currently the most active hostage-taking states. Just last month, Venezuela
<a>retaliated</a> against the United States for its extradition of a Maduro ally by re-imprisoning
<a>six U.S. oil executives</a> who had been under house arrest. They have been held captive since 2017.
<a>Russia</a>, like allies such as
<a>Turkey</a>, practices hostage diplomacy, too.
<p>Ben Rhodes, who was deputy national security adviser under President Barack Obama, says this growing threat cannot be ignored.</p>
<a>Haiti</a> now, and the perceived costs and benefits of hostage-taking can drive up demand.
<p>Terrorists, militants and other non-state actors engage in hostage-taking from South America to Southeast Asia, but events in the Middle East have helped bring the numbers down in recent years.</p>
<a>Combating Terrorism Center at West Point</a>. “At the same time, the
<p>If the number of Americans seized by foreign governments has risen steadily over the past two decades, it is in part because Washington has gotten better at counting the cases and in part because the practice is becoming more popular.</p>
<a>resulted</a> in the creation of the interagency Hostage Recovery Fusion Cell, the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs and the National Security Council’s Hostage Response Group. It also led to the passage of a
<a>new law</a> requiring the secretary of state to identify what it
<a>considers </a>U.S. nationals wrongfully detained by foreign governments and authorizing the president to impose sanctions on their captors. But all these steps have not driven down the number of incidents of hostage-taking.
<p>Roger Carstens is the current hostage envoy and one of the few holdovers from the Trump administration. He says countries that regularly detain Westerners for leverage — such as Iran — might be incentivizing others to follow their lead.</p>
<b> </b>U.S. nationals lawfully — or wrongfully — detained abroad. Now, once it’s clear that an American is facing fabricated charges or being held because of their nationality or for coercive purposes, the special envoy is assigned to
<a>lead</a> diplomatic efforts to get them home and
<a>make the case a priority</a> for the White House.
<a>early 1970s</a>, U.S. presidents have asserted a
<a>zero-concessions</a> policy. In practice, they oversee
<a>intricate deals</a> to bring hostages home. When a terrorist group takes an American hostage, the U.S. response is often a military one. But when dealing with foreign governments, risky rescue and evacuation plans are harder to justify.
<p>“If a nation-state wrongfully detains a U.S. citizen, we’re now able to, in a way, marshal resources and marshal a diplomatic effort to try to bring them back,” says Carstens.</p>
<a>Austin Tice</a>, a hostage in Syria since 2012, and
<a>nine</a> Americans held in Venezuela, for not approving direct talks with those governments. And since the nuclear negotiations between Washington and Tehran have
<a>stalled</a>, there is dwindling hope for talks to free the four American hostages in Iran, including
<a>Baquer and Siamak Namazi</a>.
<a>bogus</a> national security charges. In the United States, three administrations
<a>failed</a> to negotiate their freedom while managing to bring other Americans home.
<a>Paul Rusesabagina</a>, the United States and other countries run the risk of accepting state hostage-taking as a problem without a solution.
<p>One U.S. official compared the conventional approach to “a game of whack-a-mole,” arguing that without effective accountability and deterrent measures, the problem is bound to worsen.</p>
<a>several Americans</a> wrongfully detained overseas. Carstens says there isn’t sufficient data to know the long-term impacts of concessions, prisoner swaps or military force. And even if there were, it might not help future hostages.
<a>American jailed in Myanmar</a> and
<a>two U.S. citizens </a>who had been banned from leaving China since 2018. The latter coincided with the release of
<a>two Canadians</a> held in China for more than 1,000 days, and the return to China of a Huawei executive
<a>detained</a> at the United States’ request for nearly three years in Vancouver. The executive was freed after striking an agreement with the Justice Department acknowledging she helped Huawei conceal dealings in Iran that violated U.S. sanctions.
<a> syndrome</a>” sonic attacks on U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers, Russia’s
<a>abuse</a> of Interpol to silence critics and the rising tide of attacks by governments on dissident citizens overseas suggest a global theater where there are no rules anymore.
<p>If the United States wants to send a message that foreign governments cannot hold Americans for diplomatic leverage, it might have to reckon with its own record on torture, rendition and the indefinite detention of foreign nationals.</p>
<p>To show the United States is part of the solution, Rhodes says Washington needs to close the prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, as a start.</p>

<div><div><p>There is a flip side to the White grievance of the right — and it’s one of the most important but under-discussed aspects of American politics.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the questions of if, when and how Democrats pursue White appeasement politics have always been contested within the party. And right now, that debate is perhaps more relevant than ever before.</p></div></div>

<a>deportations</a> of undocumented immigrants. He
<a>spoke about race</a> much less than his predecessors had during his first term. He declared in 2012: “I’m not the president of Black America.”

<a>repeatedly condemned rioting</a> amid the George Floyd protests. The overwhelming majority of the
<a>protests were peaceful</a>, and almost no one actually favors rioting, but Biden felt compelled to reassure White Americans that he didn’t like violent protests. As president, he initially refused to
<a> increase the number of refugees</a> allowed to enter the United States from Trump-era levels. He has kept in place a
<a>harsh Trump-era </a>policy of using a provision called Title 42 to block some migrants from seeking asylum within the United States, on the grounds that covid-19 is a public health crisis and that migrants could exacerbate it.

<a>harder for low-income families</a> to get public benefits if the parents weren’t working, punishing children for adults’ actions. The Obama-era deportations
<a>reached unnecessarily high levels</a>. They also did not help Obama get Republican votes for his broader immigration agenda.
<b> </b>But they shouldn’t lose sight of the actual problem, either — that many White people aren’t comfortable with vocal people of color and civil rights causes. Instead, Democrats often
<b> </b>go beyond giving White people a pass for their racism; they frequently seek out opportunities to criticize people of color. It’s morally abhorrent to punch down at less powerful groups while sparing the dominant one.

<a>migrants are disease carriers</a>.
<div><div><p>Third, the Democrats should just do less White appeasement because the electoral benefits of the strategy are much smaller now than they were in previous eras.</p></div></div>
<p>Because the Democratic Party of today takes such pride in its embrace of people of color and civil rights causes, it would be very politically dicey for Biden or another major party leader to single out, say, Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) for criticism.</p>
