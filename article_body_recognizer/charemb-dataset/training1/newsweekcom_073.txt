<p>Wang Xiyue is a Ph.D. candidate in history at Princeton University. He was imprisoned in Iran from Aug. 7, 2016, to Dec. 7, 2019.</p>
<p>The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> said that the U.S. is willing to reenter the nuclear deal, but time is beginning to run short.
<p>Inspectors from the United Nation's International Atomic Energy Agency have been unable to watch surveillance footage and continue to deal with other challenges amid attempts to keep an eye on Iran's rising uranium supply.</p>
<p>Regional rival Israel has been scrutinizing Iran under suspicions that it will build nuclear weapons, though Iran has insisted its nuclear strides are peaceful.</p>
<a>Twitter</a> Monday that he hoped to use his meeting with Iranian officials to "address outstanding questions."
<p>"I hope to establish a fruitful and cooperative channel of direct dialogue so the (IAEA) can resume essential verification activities in the country," Grossi said.</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.</p>
<p>After their talk, Eslami gave a news conference in which he described the ongoing issues as "technical" and not governed by the "political issues and conspiracies" of Iran's enemies.</p>
<p>"Some parts are yet to be answered and some parts have to do with issues that have already been closed in the past," he said. "They have been addressed in the nuclear deal and have been closed. Today, we agreed to put an end to them."</p>
<p>Eslami did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Grossi for his part described the talks as "intense" and was not as definitive as Eslami.</p>
<p>"We are continuing at this point our negotiations with a view to finding common ground," Grossi said.</p>
<p>He later met Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian, who said Iran was determined for "constructive engagement" with the IAEA to "improve mutual trust and cooperation," according to a report by the state-run IRNA news agency.</p>
<p>In a separate report to IAEA member states earlier this month, the agency said Grossi also was concerned about inspectors "being subjected to excessively invasive physical searches by security officials at nuclear facilities in Iran."</p>
<p>Tuesday's meeting comes ahead of a wider meeting of the IAEA member states. Iran avoided facing a censure vote at the board with a similar Grossi visit in September.</p>
<p>"Either way, even with the return to an agreement, Israel is of course not part of the agreement. Israel is not bound by it," he told a security conference in Herzliya. "We will maintain our freedom to act."</p>
<p>Defying a warning from local militias, a Pentagon official has told Newsweek that U.S. forces will remain in Iraq after the scheduled end of combat operations on December 31.</p>
<p>Following talks with Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi in July, President <a>Joe Biden</a> had promised an end to the U.S. combat mission in the country by year's-end.</p>
<p>The message expressed skepticism in the original commitment, noting that roughly four months later, the commission had "not yet seen any manifestations of withdrawal, despite that only 42 days separate us from 12/31/2021."</p>
<p>This message has been reinforced by leading militia groups such as Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada and the Hezbollah al-Nujaba Movement.</p>
<p>In response, Pentagon spokesperson Navy Commander Jessica McNulty said the U.S. position remains unchanged, and that no total exit is in order.</p>
<p>But the Biden administration has offered little insight into exactly what this next phase will look like.</p>
<p>In a statement carried by the Iraqi National News Agency that same day, Iraqi Major General Tahsin Al-Khafaji, spokesperson for the Joint Operations Command, said Washington and Baghdad were sticking to their deal.</p>
<p>He said that "talking about extending the date for the withdrawal of American forces is inaccurate and incorrect, and the date for the departure of combat forces on the 31st of next December is fixed and there is no change in it."</p>
<p>"The relationship between the two parties after the departure of the combat forces will be an advisory relationship in the fields of training, armament, intelligence and security information against the terrorist organization ISIS," he added.</p>
<p>But tensions that have since emerged between Washington and Tehran have torn Baghdad from within, especially in the form of clashes between U.S. troops and Iraqi militias, some of whom have received direct support from Iran.</p>
<p>Russia is relaunching a plan to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together under a pan-Persian Gulf security agreement. President Joe Biden's administration, at odds with the Kremlin on various fronts, doesn't appear opposed to the proposal.</p>
<a>Donald Trump</a>'s "maximum pressure" doctrine against Iran.
<p>But as Biden seeks to deescalate from his predecessor's brinksmanship, Russia has identified a new opportunity to advance its proposal based on common ground it sees with the United States, its traditional rival.</p>
<p>Vitaly Naumkin, a veteran scholar who co-authored the Russian plan and currently serves as president of the 200-year-old Institute of Oriental Studies at the Russian Academy of Sciences, described that common ground.</p>
<p>"We have one common threat, the threat of war," he told Newsweek. "Neither the United States nor Russia is interested in having this war."</p>
<p>Reached for comment on the Collective Security Concept, a spokesperson for the State Department would not rule out cooperation with the Russian proposal if it proved in line with U.S. interests.</p>
<p>"We remain prepared to cooperate with Russia in areas in which the two sides have common interests while opposing Russian policies that go against U.S. interests," the State Department spokesperson told Newsweek.</p>
<p>"We also will remain in close contact and in close consultation with our Gulf partners on issues related to U.S. national security, counterterrorism, defense cooperation, and regional security," the spokesperson added.</p>
<p>Beyond this, the outline leaves room to foster better ties to jointly tackle crime and terrorism, protect freedom of navigation and promote economic growth, and lists other cooperative pursuits on humanitarian, environmental and cultural endeavors.</p>
<p>Although deep-rooted differences remain among the prospective participants, particularly Iran and Saudi Arabia, the timing for the campaign appears ideal for several reasons.</p>
<p>Finally, he credits "the leadership of President Biden."</p>
<p>Russia's policy, Naumkin said, "more or less, is showing some continuity, we have our president for 20 years," and he said Biden is now showing promising signs of developing a balanced regional approach.</p>
<p>But the Middle East remains an area where the powers may be more likely to see eye-to-eye, especially when it comes to securing long-term stability.</p>
<p>On this point, the Biden administration has not only avoided disrupting nascent Iran-Saudi diplomatic efforts that have quietly taken in Iraq, but has actually encouraged them.</p>
<p>Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have been strained for decades, and both have accused one another of attempting to export harmful ideologies and interfere in the other's affairs.</p>
<p>Last week, during an interview with France 24, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud described the four sessions with Iranian officials thus far as "exploratory in nature."</p>
<p>"So far, we have not reached any substantive conclusions in these talks, but we have made enough progress that will allow us to move forward," he added.</p>
<p>But while the outlook of the U.S. and its regional partners has still sought, at its core, to rein in Iran, Naumkin said the Collective Security Concept seeks to hold all actors on equal ground without singling any players out.</p>
<p>"We prefer a softer approach, and we prefer not to pressure anyone, but [instead] try to build trust and to make reciprocity in these smaller things, step by step," he added.</p>
<p>With regional dynamics and Washington's own strategy in flux, Naumkin hopes Biden delivers on his reset of past approaches and can work with Moscow to pursue a potential avenue for regional reconciliation.</p>
<p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said Wednesday its inspectors are still trying to determine what is happening at Iran's nuclear energy sites, the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi traveled to meet the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) this week but reported no breakthrough in restoring the agency's ability to monitor Iran's nuclear program.</p>
<p>IAEA inspectors are concerned about not having access to the footage amid Tehran's growing uranium stockpile, some of which is enriched up to 60 percent purity. Weapons-grade uranium is 90 percent.</p>
<p>"We are close to the point where I would not be able to guarantee continuity of knowledge," Grossi said. "I'm not giving up on trying to find some understanding, but in terms of what we were discussing yesterday, we could not conclude an agreement."</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.</p>
<p>Grossi did not specify a timeframe, but said a long lack of access to a centrifuge parts production site near the northern city of Karaj "would at some point prevent me from continuing to say that I have an idea of what is going on."</p>
<p>Henry Rome, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, warned Iran's stance "reflects poorly on the outlook for the nuclear talks" in Vienna.</p>
<p>"Iran may calculate that its unconstrained nuclear advances and unmonitored centrifuge production will put more pressure on the West to give ground in talks quickly," Rome said. "But it will likely have the opposite effect."</p>
<p>Iran long has insisted its program is peaceful, though the IAEA and U.S. intelligence agencies say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.</p>
<p>In an interview with NPR, U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Rob Malley warned that America won't "sit idly by" if Iran gets "too close for comfort" with advances in its nuclear program.</p>
<p>"They are getting very close to having enough fissile material, if they chose to enrich, at weapons grade for a bomb," Malley told the broadcaster. "How close they are to a bomb has to do with weaponization, and there they are...further away.</p>
<p>"But again, we're not going to wait and see them get so close, and we hope that this could be resolved diplomatically and it should be."</p>

<p>But in Washington, bad ideas never really go away. That's why, even though the "responsible stakeholder" idea is no longer being applied to the PRC, it's now being recycled by the Biden White House in its dealings with another hostile nation: Iran.</p>
<p>Ilan Berman is senior vice president of the American Foreign Policy Council in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The views expressed in this article are the writer's own.</p>
<p>The remaining signatories to Iran's 2015 nuclear deal met in Vienna on Monday to discuss reviving the collapsed deal, with Iranian officials saying the United States could have a seat at the table if it lifts sanctions against the country.</p>
<p>The original deal had Iran limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the other countries lifting economic sanctions. The talks are aimed at bringing Iran back in compliance with the deal.</p>
<p>The U.S. remains out of the talks due to the Trump administration's decision to leave the deal. President Joe Biden has indicated that he would like to rejoin.</p>
<p>A delegation appointed by new Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi has made what AP called "maximalist demands" in the negotiations, including asking the U.S. to unfreeze $10 billion in assets as a goodwill gesture.</p>
<p>Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh told AP that the U.S. could "receive a ticket for returning to the room" if it agreed to "the real lifting of sanctions."</p>
<p>Currently, a U.S. delegation led by special envoy for Iran Robert Malley is indirectly participating in the talks, joining diplomats from other countries acting as go-betweens.</p>
<p>The talks came as Austria is a week into a lockdown imposed because of a surge of coronavirus cases. Iran's state-run media aired images from inside the talks as journalists remained outside of the hotel.</p>
<p>Enrique Mora, the <a>European Union</a> official chairing the talks, also wrote on <a>Twitter</a> of "intense preparatory work ongoing."</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister <a>Naftali Bennett</a>, in a video address delivered to nations negotiating in Vienna, warned that he saw Iran trying to "end sanctions in exchange for almost nothing."</p>
<p>"Iran deserves no rewards, no bargain deals and no sanctions relief in return for their brutality," Bennett said in the video that he later posted to Twitter. "I call upon our allies around the world: Do not give in to Iran's nuclear blackmail."</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called the meeting "the last opportunity for the Iranians to come to the table" after a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid.</p>
<p>"We want those talks to work," Truss said. "But if they don't work, all options are on the table."</p>
<p>In an interview with NPR broadcast Friday, U.S. negotiator Malley said signs from Iran "are not particularly encouraging."</p>
<p>Russia's Ulyanov said there's pressure to get the process moving after "a very protracted pause."</p>
<p>"The talks can't last forever," he tweeted on Sunday. "There is the obvious need to speed up the process."</p>

<p>"Beijing believes its own propaganda about Western frailties and under-estimates Washington's resolve," Moore added. "The risk of Chinese miscalculation through overconfidence is real."</p>
<p>Moore also said the government in Beijing backs "bold and decisive action," specifically citing its refusal to acknowledge Taiwan as an independent country despite its split from mainland China in 1949.</p>
<p>"Beijing's growing military strength and the [Chinese Communist] party's desire to resolve the Taiwan issue, by force if necessary, also pose a serious challenge to global stability and peace," Moore said.</p>

<p>Moore said Iran also poses a major threat and uses the political and militant group Hezbollah—"a state within a state"—to fuel political turmoil in neighboring countries.</p>
<p>Turning to non-state threats, he said the fall of Afghanistan's internationally-backed government and the return to power of the <a>Taliban</a> were a "morale boost" to militants.</p>
<p>"I won't soft-soap it: The threat we face will likely grow now we have left Afghanistan," Moore said—though he claimed it would be "overblown" to call the surprise speed of the Taliban's takeover a Western intelligence failure.</p>
<p>He argued that Britain's spies must give up some of their deep-rooted secrecy and seek help from technology firms to win a cybersecurity arms race that is giving hostile countries and groups ever more capacity.</p>
<p>To keep up, he said British spies "are now pursuing partnerships with the tech community to help develop world-class technologies to solve our biggest mission problems."</p>
<p>"Unlike Q in the Bond movies, we cannot do it all in-house," Moore added, referring to the fictional MI6 gadget-maker in the 007 thrillers.</p>
