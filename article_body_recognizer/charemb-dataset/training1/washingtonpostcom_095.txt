<div><div><p>SYDNEY — When tennis star Novak Djokovic arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday, he stepped off the plane into a different country than the one where he’d won the Australian Open a year earlier.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Rules are rules’: Australia cancels Novak Djokovic’s visa amid vaccine exemption uproar</p></div>
<div><p>After initially distancing himself from the saga, Prime Minister Scott Morrison seemed to embrace his government’s decision to turn away the tennis player, who he said lacked a medical exemption required of unvaccinated visitors.</p></div>
<a>bungled vaccine rollout</a> to a diplomatic
<a>spat with France</a> to its latest handling of an omicron surge, ahead of what is expected to be a tight electoral contest between Morrison’s conservative coalition and the opposition Labor party.
<div><p>Novak Djokovic’s vaccine exemption for Australian Open is met with skepticism</p></div>
<a>Indian cricketers</a> were able to visit last year. Djokovic was one of several dozen overseas tennis players allowed in a year ago for the Australian Open, which he won for the third year in a row.
<div><div><p>But a lot has changed in the past 12 months, said Steve Georgakis, an expert in the history and sociology of sport at the University of Sydney.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With relatively few cases and a sports-mad populace, Australia carved out exceptions early in the pandemic to keep the games going even as most industries ground to a halt, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our sport in many ways continued uninterrupted,” he said. “It’s this great unifier of who we are, it brings people together, and it has brought our nation together.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Allowing big business to break the rules is not what Australian sport is all about,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The other big change is that after a slow start, roughly 94 percent of eligible Australians are vaccinated, leaving little popular sympathy for Djokovic, who has said he <a>opposes vaccination</a> and vaccine mandates.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That Djokovic was arriving in Melbourne, which has endured more time in lockdown than any other city on earth and seen the most deaths in Australia, added to the outrage.</p></div></div>
<a>movie posters</a> about people trapped at airports. One satirical website
<a>quipped</a> that Djokovic had instead decided to enter a tournament on Manus Island, where Australia detained asylum seekers.
<div><div><p>The initial decision to grant the tennis star a visa “didn’t pass the pub test,” meaning the average Australian wouldn’t agree with it, said Georgakis.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘A search for villains’: As Australia’s outbreak grows, so does covid shaming</p></div>
<div><div><p>The government “really misunderstood the Djokovic situation,” he said. “They look really silly now.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While unvaccinated Australians are allowed to return to the country (with two weeks in hotel quarantine), visa holders must be vaccinated or have a medical exemption.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Morrison said Thursday that Djokovic did not have a “valid” medical exemption, suggesting that authorities in Victoria state, where Melbourne is located, and Tennis Australia were responsible for the mix-up.</p></div></div>
<p>“All I can say is that the evidence [for] medical exemption that was provided was found to be insufficient,” the prime minister said. But Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley shot back, saying his state wasn’t to blame.</p>
<div><div><p>“Someone issued Novak a visa, and it wasn’t the Victorian government,” Foley said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The federal government is now taking heat from Serbia, Djokovic’s home country, a few months after an embarrassing fallout with France over a canceled submarine deal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Djokovic is reportedly being held at a Melbourne hotel where detained asylum seekers have complained of maggots, though Minister for Home Affairs Karen Andrews refused to say where he was on Thursday.</p></div></div>
<p>The tennis star’s attorneys on Thursday won a last-minute bid to prevent his deportation, with a judge approving a temporary injunction that allows Djokovic to stay in Australia until at least Monday, when a further hearing will take place.</p>
<div><div><p>Djokovic has won the Australian Open nine times, more than any other player, and is tied with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for the most Grand Slam titles. At the moment, his bid to break that record has been slammed shut.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Amy Cheng</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 5:38 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Pope Francis lamented Wednesday that many<b> </b>couples are choosing to have pets over children, saying that a trend of forgoing child-rearing “takes some of our humanity away.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Today … we see a form of selfishness,” the pope <a>said</a>, according to translations in multiple reports. “We see that some people do not want to have a child.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Or, he said, they may have one or two kids — “but they have dogs and cats that take the place of children.”</p></div></div>

<a>said</a>, according to Religion News Service. “Then, in the end this marriage comes to old age in solitude, with the bitterness of loneliness.”
<div><div><p>And last month, the pontiff warned that Italy’s declining number of births, which reached its nadir since the 1860s, may threaten the country’s future, Reuters <a>reported</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>For instance, the pontiff bucked calls from conservative Catholic bishops and reportedly said last year that<b> </b>President Biden, who supports abortion rights, should be allowed to continue to receive Communion.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Here’s what you need to know about Kazakhstan’s unrest</p></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, the alliance dispatched about 2,500 peacekeepers to Kazakhstan, the group’s secretary general, Stanislav Zas, told the Russian state new agency RIA. The report did not give a breakdown on nationalities.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The stakes are especially high for Russia, effectively the leader of the alliance, as its presence risks alienating a public that is demanding a change in Kazakhstan’s regime but has yet to show any anti-Russian sentiment.</p></div>
<div><div><p>He added: “Kazakhstan will test Russia’s actual capabilities. It will be both distracting and sobering.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There were been multiple reports of gunfire around the city throughout the day, and on Thursday evening Almaty police reported that additional “terrorists” were killed outside the Almalinksy district police station.</p></div></div>
<p>At least eight law enforcement officers have been killed, according to the Interior Ministry. More than 1,000 people have been injured in the protests, the Health Ministry said Thursday, 400 of whom have been hospitalized, with 62 in intensive care.</p>
<div><div><p>Kazakhstan’s Internet was blacked out Thursday and national banking services reportedly were suspended.</p></div></div>
<p>“It is a very awkward attempt to explain this threat in a very clumsy way so that it complies with the condition of the treaty that outlines the possibility of an intervention if one of the parties is under threat,” Dubnov added.</p>
<div><p>The alliance said forces from Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan would be deployed to Kazakhstan, with the primary goal of protecting state and military facilities. Moscow also sent paratroopers, the organization said.</p></div>

<div><div><p>State Department spokesman Ned Price called on all parties to resolve the situation peacefully.</p></div></div>
<a>previously complained</a> that such troops prop up pro-Russian separatist forces.

<div><div><p>The headline-grabbing paltry sum, however, is not the whole story, and Meghan will be receiving much more from the tabloid — but for violation of her copyright rather than privacy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, wins court victory in privacy fight with British tabloid</p></div>
<div><div><p>But the court added that a “confidential sum agreed between the parties” will be paid by the tabloid’s publisher<b> </b>for copyright infringement. That secret sum could be quite high, legal observers say.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The duchess sued — and the duchess won.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Duchess of Sussex wins her legal case for copyright infringement against Associated Newspapers for articles published in The Mail on Sunday and posted on Mail Online — SEE PAGE 3,” read the statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If the case sets no legal precedent, Green said, it has “immense cultural and media significance.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Analysts said that for the payout, Meghan’s team would have sought to recoup the profits that the tabloid made from printing her letter, which violated her copyright.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>the Mail on Sunday would have had to provide “accurate financial information as to how much it made from the infringing material.”
<div><div><p>Mark Stephens, a media lawyer at the London-based Howard Kennedy firm, said that during trials, expert evidence can be sought over how much the infringing material helped boost sales, although this case did not go to trial.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But he said that a number would still be generated “forensically” or simply “dealt with by sticking a thumb in the air” and landing on a figure to which both parties agree. He guessed it would be north of $100,000.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It looks as if they weighed up their options, and then decided that an account of profits in the copyright is going to give her more money than the invasion of privacy,” Stephens said.</p></div></div>

<p>The students continue to observe their traditions — praying three times a day, keeping a kosher communal kitchen, rocking napping newborns during lectures, and, if married, wearing wigs or head coverings in accordance with religious rules.</p>
<p>But there are also signs of rebellion. Lia Kalifa, 22, a first-year student from the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Sanhedria, has six tattoos, including on her ear and under her chin. Tattoos are widely viewed as a violation among religious Jews.</p>
<div><div><p>“Art,” she said, “is for the soul.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Ousted from power, Israel’s ultra-Orthodox lose the final word on what’s kosher</p></div>
<div><div><p>Even as studying art has opened her eyes, Mamon acknowledged that she has felt guilty for delaying marriage and a family.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I understand it: We have a lot of boundaries, and art is supposed to be without boundaries,” she said. “Though, I understand better now, everyone has boundaries.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“My hope is that a new generation of female Jewish artists can integrate modern art and Judaism,” Bezek said, and continue the debate on issues “I’ve only begun to contend with here.”</p></div></div>
