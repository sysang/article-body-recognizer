<p>SINGAPORE: What havoc might Omicron wreak around the world and how might Singapore be affected?</p>
<p>Many had hoped last year to see the light at the end of the tunnel in 2021. But things took a turn for the worse in most parts of the world, including Singapore, with the Delta wave.</p>
<p>Now, a more transmissible variant – Omicron – is making its way around the globe. </p>
<p>The Omicron variant now accounts for 73 per cent of US coronavirus infections, up from just about 3 per cent of sequenced cases in the previous week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday.</p>
<p>A number of countries have cancelled year-end festivities or reintroduced restrictions. <a>Thailand has reinstated quarantine</a> for travellers, while New Zealand has postponed its border reopening plans due to Omicron’s rapid spread.</p>
<p>Singapore has reported 71 confirmed Omicron cases, of which 65 were imported and six are local infections. There is also a <a>suspected Omicron cluster of three cases</a>, from the Health Ministry's update on Monday.</p>
<p>Will 2022 be 2020 too? Or will Singapore continue its journey towards living with the virus?</p>
<p>CNA asked some experts what lies ahead and what risks the new variant poses.</p>
<h2>VAXXED BUT STILL VEXED BY VIRUS</h2>
<p>Back in June, the co-chairs of the multi-ministry task force wrote an editorial in the Straits Times outlining Singapore’s COVID-19 endemic living strategy.</p>
<p>Against Singapore’s total population, the vaccination rate is now 87 per cent, and a large group of the unvaccinated – children aged five to 11 – are set to get inoculated.</p>
<p>By all measures, this is a success, except that the Delta variant had more surprises in store for the world, and for Singapore. </p>
<p>Like other countries that have achieved a high rate of vaccination, Singapore found out that vaccines alone could not stop the virus in its tracks. COVID-19 safe management measures have remained front and centre in controlling the spread.</p>
<h2>OMICRON WILL BECOME “DOMINANT” STRAIN</h2>
<p>Public health expert Associate Professor Natasha Howard said that with the rise of the much more transmissible variant, increased case numbers and hospitalisations are likely.</p>
<p>“It appears likely that Omicron will become the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain globally in 2022,” said the interdisciplinary health policy and systems researcher from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. </p>
<p>“The implications of this are still unclear, but it shows that the pandemic is not controlled yet and until initial and booster COVID-19 vaccine doses are accessible to everyone eligible globally, we can expect new variants to emerge.” </p>
<p>She said that for the Singapore population, it’s clear that two COVID-19 vaccine doses are not enough to provide reasonable protection against Omicron and people should get booster shots as soon as they are eligible.</p>
<p>She added: “I do think Singapore will continue to do well against COVID-19 if the pragmatic and evidence-informed government responses that we have seen so far continue.”</p>
<p>Associate Professor Ashley St John from the Duke-NUS Medical School’s Emerging Infectious Diseases Programme said that Omicron will likely be the cause of a “significant wave” of COVID-19. </p>
<p>But while the Omicron variant is more transmissible than most we have seen, it is still SARS-CoV-2, she said. </p>
<p>“The same measures can control it that we have been discussing,” she said. These include vaccination, mask-wearing in public or crowded spaces, and testing before meeting with those who are at risk.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof Howard said that Omicron is more transmissible and has “increased immune escape” compared with Delta. </p>
<p>Citing Imperial College modelling data, she said that the risk of reinfection with the Omicron variant is more than five times higher and it does not appear milder than the Delta variant.</p>
<p>But she added that there is significant uncertainty with such modelling estimates and hospital data from South Africa still indicate a milder infection.</p>
<p>It’s clear that much is still unknown about the new variant.</p>
<p>Assoc Prof St John explained: “The genetic backbone of Omicron is very, very different … However, we don’t yet have consistent data whether those genetic differences result in increased severity.” </p>
<p>Public health experts are thus monitoring the data on severity for Omicron and are waiting for more concrete numbers to bolster the initial assessment that vaccines are efficacious against it, she said.</p>
<h2>CAN THE PANDEMIC END IN 2022?</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for the world to pull together to end the COVID-19 pandemic next year. </p>
<p>"2022 must be the year we end the pandemic," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva on Monday.</p>
<p>But experts here said much depends on how potent the Omicron variant is.</p>
<p>Dr Lim Wee Kiat, associate director at the Singapore Management University’s Centre for Management Practice, said it is “futile” to try and predict when the pandemic will end.</p>
<p>After all, the 1918 flu pandemic never really ended – according to the US CDC, descendants of the influenza virus from more than a century ago still circulate today.</p>
<p>“The path to normalcy is going to be punctuated by twists and dead ends, even reversals, as we have seen here in Singapore and elsewhere,” said Dr Lim, a disaster sociologist by training.</p>
<p>But this doesn’t mean that we will be at a standstill for another year. Assoc Prof Howard said that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is already endemic in the sense that it will always be around.</p>
<p>“So the question is: How soon we can adopt an endemic rather than epidemic approach to living with it and what this will look like. Key indicators to note are rates of severe illness and deaths due to COVID-19.”</p>
<p>And while Omicron may further delay the roll-out of the Government’s COVID-19 endemic roadmap, Singapore’s experience in managing the pandemic over the past two years is a plus. </p>
<p>So when Singapore has overcome the Omicron wave, be it big or small, what might life look like?</p>
<p>Assoc Prof St John feels that testing without symptoms should eventually be rolled back for most of the Singapore population, but can continue to be useful in some circumstances.</p>
<p>“For example, it is a key tool that can be used before meeting with individuals who are at-risk, before large group gatherings, or for individuals in certain positions with a high level of risk,” she said. </p>
<p>Dr Lim said that perhaps the “most significant marker of normalcy” is when mask-wearing is no longer mandatory.</p>
<p>Experts also said that contact tracing has “reduced in utility” and similarly, TraceTogether and checking into public places may be less relevant unless it is “repurposed”.</p>
<p>On vaccine-differentiated measures, Assoc Prof St John thinks they are “reasonable” but should exclude those who have a genuine health-related reason for exemption.</p>
<h2>TRAVEL GROUNDED FOR ANOTHER YEAR?</h2>
<p>While Omicron has paused Singapore’s border reopening, experts said that Singapore has to continue to further open up the economy as well as its borders given the vital importance of external trade to the country.</p>
<p>Mr Nicholas Lim, Asia CEO of The Travel Corporation said that the 2022 travel situation will largely be dependent on governments keeping borders open and how quickly businesses can adapt to the fluidity of the situation.</p>
<p>“While we understand the precautionary measures that governments and experts are advocating or implementing, it is also important that we do not make the people panic, which is a crucial step towards living in a COVID-19 endemic world,” he said.</p>
<p>Based on The Travel Corporation’s booking and enquiry figures, travel demand from Singapore remains to be high, with people booking trips as far ahead as the third quarter of 2022, he said. </p>
<p>Ms Jane Lim, vice-president of global markets at Tripadvisor said that the interest, searches and bookings for VTLs available from Singapore were high over the festive and school holiday season.</p>
<p>“This tells us that as long as opportunities for international travel are open, Singaporeans will want to get out there and start exploring again,” she said.</p>
<h2>VIRUS WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE</h2>
<p>Public health experts agreed that new variants of the virus are the key concern and risk ahead, and to combat this, ensuring that the whole world has access to vaccines should be a priority.</p>
<p>“The potential of new variants of concern to emerge and cause changes to policy is real, especially as much of the world remains unvaccinated,” said Assoc Prof St John. </p>
<p>“For that reason I always emphasise vaccine equity … COVID-19 will remain with us as a public health concern until vaccination targets are achieved worldwide.” </p>
<p>Dr Lim, who studied how China reformed its emergency management policies following the 2003 SARS epidemic, said the crux is that governments have to be “fleet-footed”. </p>
<p>“They have to be adaptive and willing to change their minds in light of new evidence and evolving realities. And even so, they need to accept that at some point, they will be caught off-guard,” he said. </p>
<p>“It’s going to be about how quickly its leadership can correct and recover from mistakes, miscalculations and possibly even misconduct.”</p>
<p>He added that it’s vital to learn from the current crisis. </p>
<p>“As we are still in ‘firefighting’ mode, it is easy to defer the need to be prepared for the next one,” he said.</p>
<p>“It is critical that organisations, not just hospitals and government bodies, but also businesses, non-profits, schools and shopping malls, capture their experience in coping with COVID, not just what works, but when it does not.”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> New Zealand delays border reopening over Omicron concerns </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>WELLINGTON: New Zealand on Tuesday (Dec 21) postponed its phased border reopening plans until the end of February over concerns of the rapid global spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Non-quarantine travel, which was to have opened for New Zealanders in Australia from Jan 16, would be pushed back until the end of February, COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said at a press conference in Wellington.</p>
<p>"All of the evidence so far points to Omicron being the most transmissible COVID-19 variant yet.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt this is disappointing and will upset many holiday plans, but it's important to set these changes out clearly today so they can have time to consider those plans."</p>
<p>The measures were a precaution as it was still unclear how sick Omicron makes people and the impact it had on health systems was not yet fully understood, he said.</p>
<p>New Zealand also said the length of stay in state quarantine facilities would be increased from a week to 10 days. The pre-departure test requirement to enter New Zealand was reduced from 72 hours to 48 hours before travel.</p>
<p>National airline Air New Zealand said it would cancel around 120 services through to the end of February due to the reopening plans being pushed back, affecting about 27,000 customers.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the decisions were taken to give the government more time to prepare for Omicron.</p>
<p>The Omicron variant was first detected last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong and has spread with lightening speed to at least 89 countries so far.</p>
<p>New Zealand has reported 22 cases with the Omicron variant but all at the border quarantine facilities and there has been no community cases yet.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Modern-day Darwin, EO Wilson, dies at 92 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Edward O Wilson, a US naturalist dubbed the "modern-day Darwin" died on Sunday (Dec 27) at the age 92 in Massachusetts, his foundation said in a statement.</p>
<p>Alongside British naturalist David Attenborough, Wilson was considered one of the world's leading authorities on natural history and conservation.</p>
<p>Wilson's Half-Earth Project calls for protecting half the planet's land and sea so there are enough diverse and well-connected ecosystems to reverse the course of species extinction, which is happening at a rate not seen in 10 million years.</p>
<p>The United Nations has urged countries to commit to conserving 30per cent of their land and water – almost double the area now under some form of protection - by 2030, a target known as "30 by 30" and inspired in part by Wilson.</p>
<p>Wilson was also a world authority on ants, of which he discovered more than 400 species. He wrote two Pulitzer Prize-winning books and popularised the term "biodiversity".</p>
<p>The Harvard University scientist had been living in a retirement community in the northeastern United States and had recently published the latest in a long series of books on biodiversity.</p>

<li> <a> CNA Eyewitness</a> <ul> <li> Send us a news tip </li> </ul> </li>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Singapore to restrict entry for travellers from 7 African countries as new COVID-19 variant emerges </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<a>potentially more contagious COVID-19 variant</a> may be circulating there, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Friday (Nov 26).
<p>The restrictions also apply to those who have obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore.</p>
<p>Singapore citizens and permanent residents returning from these countries will have to serve a 10-day stay-home notice at a dedicated facility.</p>
<p>“There have been recent reports of a potentially more contagious variant of the COVID-19 virus, the B.1.1.529, which may be circulating in Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe,” MOH said.</p>
<p>While Singapore currently has no cases of this variant, "we should take the necessary precautions to reduce the risks" of it spreading here, MOH said.</p>
<p>South Africa was previously a Category II country with travellers serving a seven-day stay-home notice at their declared place of accommodation after arriving in Singapore. It has now been reclassified as a Category IV country.</p>
<p>The other six are Category IV countries, with arriving travellers with recent travel history to these countries currently required to serve a 10-day stay-home notice at dedicated facilities.</p>
<p>Singapore ranks countries from Category I to IV to determine what type of travel restrictions are put in place. </p>
<p>The new border restrictions will initially apply for four weeks, and MOH will review and extend the restrictions if necessary.</p>
<p>"The Ministry of Health will evaluate the data as it emerges and review our border measures accordingly."</p>
<h2>"IMPORTANT PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE": ISWARAN</h2>
<p>Transport Minister S Iswaran said on Friday that the move was an “important precautionary measure”, and is part of a “larger strategy and approach” to the reopening of Singapore’s borders.</p>
<p>Of the seven countries listed by MOH, only one – South Africa – has direct air links with Singapore, with one flight a day, he added. </p>
<p>“And even then the volumes are very low, most of them are actually transit passengers going on to other destinations, and a very small number - and I'm informed that it's under 10 a day - actually enter Singapore,” he added.</p>
<p>He noted that Singapore has to be mindful of the situation evolving around the world even as it reopens.</p>
<p>“And of course, countries are also closely studying what's happening in Singapore and our part of the world. And we must expect that in a dynamic situation like this, and with the pandemic evolving, that settings may change.”</p>
<p>“We have got several elements here in the design of the VTL scheme that can enable us to calibrate the risk in accordance with the assessment of that point in time,” he said.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the threshold is determined by the public health risk assessment. And it is something therefore we work very closely with the Ministry of Health on, because our overriding priority is always public health and safety," he added. </p>
<p>"So we want to make sure that that stays the priority ... But there's a range of these levers that we have at our disposal to manage the risk and that's why it is a constant and dynamic assessment of the situation.”</p>
<div> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h5> Cathedral bells to toll daily for South African struggle hero Desmond Tutu </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Cathedral bells to toll daily for South African struggle hero Desmond Tutu </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<a>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</a>, who died peacefully in a Cape Town nursing home on Sunday. He was 90.
<p>Mourners laid flowers in tribute to Tutu outside what has become known as the "People's Cathedral" and a powerful symbol of democracy, where a black-and-white image of Tutu was attached to a fence.</p>
<p>The bells will kick off a week of mourning for Tutu, prompting an outpouring of tributes from around the world.</p>
<p>"Fighting for freedom from the trenches of South Africa required a courage that cannot be described," Graca Machel, widow of Nelson Mandela, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Day by day, minute by minute, every step he took he was shaping the course of history. Every sentence he spoke impacted the lives of millions, and both unified and empowered those in the noble struggle against apartheid."</p>
<p>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that flags would be flown at half-mast nationwide and at South African diplomatic missions abroad until the night before Tutu's funeral service.</p>
<p>"In the days to come, we will mourn this global icon of peace and freedom," he said in a national address late on Sunday.</p>
<p>"We will recount his achievements, we will recall his teachings and we will cherish fond memories of this man who always tempered criticism with compassion."</p>
<p>Cape Town's city hall, Arch for Arch - a monument commemorating Tutu - and the iconic Table Mountain, were illuminated in purple on Sunday, a nod to the robes that Tutu often donned.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> CNA Lifestyle </a> </p> <h5> How to choose the right shapewear for a slimmer look (or to hide that muffin top) </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> How to choose the right shapewear for a slimmer look (or to hide that muffin top) </h1>
<div> <p>Bodysuits, waist cinchers and camisoles can give you that instant nip and tuck when things don’t fit right. The question is – which shapewear should you use? We break it down.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tracy Lee </a> </div> </div>
<p>If you’re not up for some body positivity pep talk, the good news is that proper shapewear can deal with any – or all – of those issues.</p>
<p>As Commando founder and designer Kerry O’Brien said on her website: “The right underwear can do wonders for how a woman looks in her clothes. When you have the right foundations, you feel that much more confident and beautiful.”</p>
<p>Indeed, shapewear can temporarily “condense” your fat, and even redistribute it to look more flattering.</p>
<p>It can give you a slimmer, more streamlined silhouette, while helping your clothes sit better for a more flattering fit. It also protects you from wardrobe malfunctions and improves your posture, translating to a more confident you.</p>
<p>What’s more, shapewear can also provide health benefits, such as stimulating circulation, and providing support to muscles.</p>
<p>But where do you start your hunt for the right shapewear? Consider the following tips:</p>
<p>BUY THE RIGHT SIZE AND CUT</p>
<p>Obviously, buying shapewear that’s too large totally defeats its purpose. But don’t go to the other extreme and buy shapewear that’s too small – its seams might roll or cut into your flesh, resulting in unsightly lumps and bulges.</p>

<p>DON’T SHOP ONLINE – GO TO A STORE</p>
<p>CHOOSE THE RIGHT MATERIAL</p>
<p>Many shapewear items are constructed with panels or zones made of thicker fabric or tighter weaves to hold in or lift your trouble spots. The higher the nylon content, and the thicker the material, the more the garment will alter your shape.</p>
<p>Lighter pieces made of thinner fabric, or even cotton/spandex, offer subtle overall smoothing; medium construction garments offer smoothing and support; strong construction items can create total body transformation temporarily.</p>
<p>Some shapewear comes with thermal properties while others made for warmer climes may feature fabric with cooling or odour control properties – a good option in our hot, humid weather, especially if you’re prone to yeast infections.</p>
<p>UNDERSTAND YOUR SHAPEWEAR OPTIONS</p>
<p>It all depends on what your trouble zones are, and what clothes you plan to wear. Here are nine types to consider, and what they’re good for.</p>
<p>Good for: Smoothing out back and bra fat, giving the appearance of a flatter stomach and smaller waist. Bonus points if it comes with built-in bra cups.</p>
<ul><li>Control briefs</li> </ul>
<h3><a>READ: How to dress to flatter your body when you’re not stick thin</a></h3>
<p>Good for: Shaping the entire torso but not the hips. Wear under dresses that are looser on the lower body, or with jeans or trousers. If your behind doesn’t need reining in, you can even opt for a thong style to prevent VPL.</p>
<ul><li>Bodysuit with chest cut-out </li> </ul>
<ul><li>U-plunge bodysuit</li> </ul>
<p>Good for: Super-low cut and/or backless dresses and tops – perfect for cocktail and party looks.</p>
<p>Good for: Eliminating bulges and panty lines under thin or sheer dresses. You can even choose from various neckline and strap options. A half-slip that starts at the waist is good for wearing under skirts.</p>
<ul><li>Waist cincher</li> </ul>
<p>A post shared by <a> SKIMS</a> (@skims) on <time>Dec 10, 2019 at 3:01pm PST</time></p>
<p>Good for: If you’ve been neglecting your bicep curls, triceps dips and chaturangas. Wear under close-fitting long sleeved tops and dresses, or even as a layering piece under a sleeveless shift dress or slip dress, or strappy top.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> China to stabilise grain output and boost oilseed crop, minister says </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>BEIJING :China will stabilise corn production and expand soybean output in the new year to ensure grain security, the Communist Party's People's Daily quoted the agriculture minister as saying on Monday.</p>
<p>"Safeguarding supply security of grains, and important agricultural and sideline products is always our top task and main priority," Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Tang Renjian said in an interview with People's Daily. </p>
<p>"Agricultural and rural affairs departments must devote every effort to grain production, with the attitude of conducting a desperate fight, and with extraordinary and super strength."</p>
<p>Tang's comments come against the backdrop of lingering concern over food security in the world's most populous country as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt food supply chains and logistics across the globe.</p>
<p>China's soybean output this year dropped sharply from last year while corn production increased as farmers sought to take advantage of better profitability.</p>
<p>Tang called for abandoned land to be cultivated while maximising the potential of intercropping to ensure stable grains acreage in 2022, People's Daily reported. </p>
<p>Beijing vowed to safeguard grain security and ensure effective supplies of livestock, fish farming products and vegetables in 2022, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing comments made at the conference. </p>
<p>"Ensuring the supplies of primary products is a major strategic issue," Chinese President Xi Jinping said before the conference.</p>
<p>President Xi also urged protection of farmland and safeguarding of grain acreage and output in both main production and consumption areas, Xinhua reported. </p>
<p>Agricultural materials supplies and prices must be secured, Premier Li Keqiang said at a meeting of the State Council, or the cabinet, the same Xinhua report said. </p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h5> Union launches app for security officers to report abuse, work grievances </h5> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Union launches app for security officers to report abuse, work grievances </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The Union of Security Employees (USE) has launched a mobile application for security officers to report abuse or work-related grievances.</p>
<p>This was announced along with the results of a survey on the welfare of private security officers, which found that more than one in two officers reported feeling nervous and stressed at work.</p>
<p>USE said that the free mobile app lets security officers report “any work-related issues and grievances anytime and anywhere”.</p>
<p>According to USE, registered users of the app can key in details of the case or issue, including location and photos. The cases submitted via the app will be routed to the USE Mediation Service for follow-up. </p>
<p>"Today, officers walk to the (mediation) centre to report a case or email, so this is added means for them to report a case," said Mr Steve Tan, USE executive secretary.</p>
<p>The mobile app was created in response to officers' feedback that it was difficult to send an email reporting abuse when they were on duty, said Mr Tan. The app also has geo-tagging, he said.</p>
<p>"You just need to report what happened: 'Someone scolded me' and click send, we already know where you are," he said. "I think it's added convenience."</p>
<p>Users can also check back on the status of their submissions via the app and be kept updated on industry and union-related news.</p>
<h2>39% FACED ABUSE AT WORK</h2>
<p>The third instalment of a longitudinal survey by USE and the Singapore University of Social Sciences found that the welfare of security officers “continue to be of concern”, particularly in the areas of mental well-being and abuse.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted from July to September, garnering responses from 1,000 security officers. The first and second waves of the survey were conducted from January to February and July to September in 2020.</p>
<p>Questions relating to work stress were included in the survey for the first time, and more than one in two officers reported feeling nervous and stressed at work.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 per cent said they were sometimes nervous or stressed at work, while 13 per cent reported being "fairly often or very often" nervous and stressed at work. About 7 per cent also said they were often overwhelmed with work.</p>
<p>"It is an issue that is getting national attention and we should really put some attention on it as well, especially if the officer gets abused verbally more frequently," said Mr Tan.</p>
<p>Similar to the first two surveys, a substantial proportion of officers (39 per cent) reported having faced abuse at work. </p>
<p>This is slightly lower than the 42 per cent reported in the last survey, but higher than the 32 per cent in the first survey. The majority of abuse reported was verbal abuse.</p>
<p>The frequency of abuse has also risen, with almost 40 per cent - up from 30 per cent - of those who reported verbal abuse sharing that they experienced verbal abuse at least once every two weeks.</p>
<p>The survey also found that older officers suffered more abuse than younger officers. At least 40 per cent of security officers aged 50 and above reported facing abuse at work, while 26 per cent of those aged up to 29 years reported the same.</p>
<p>A breakdown by location also found that the share of abuse at commercial sites, such as malls and office buildings, has gone up to 51 per cent from about 46 per cent since the last survey. </p>
<p>Meanwhile at residential sites, such as condominiums, the share decreased from about 51 per cent to about 31 per cent. </p>
<p>Mr Tan said that the increase in abuse at commercial sites has risen as Singapore transits to living with COVID-19 and there may be more incidences of crowding and people not complying with safe management measures, which officers have to manage.</p>
<h2>LARGE PROPORTION OF ABUSE FROM GENERAL PUBLIC</h2>
<p>More than 40 per cent of the abuse perpetrators come from the general public.</p>
<p>“USE is concerned that security officers continue to be abused while doing their jobs as provided for under the law.</p>
<p>"We urge the general public to recognise the important work of our security officers as frontline warriors protecting property and lives, and cooperate with them when required,” said Mr Raymond Chin, USE general secretary.</p>
<p>The survey covered other aspects of security officers' work, such as their wages and work prospects.</p>
<p>USE said that wages remained steady in the sector, and met Progressive Wage Model benchmarks across all levels. </p>
<p>More than six in 10 security officers surveyed said they are compensated fairly for their work and are expecting a median wage increase of about S$150 next year. More than eight in 10 said they were satisfied with the profession. </p>
<p>The use of technology continues to remain high (about 90 per cent), and more than six in 10 have the intention to learn new skills in the next six months, according to the survey results.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Japan to auction more than 600,000 bbl of oil from national reserves in Feb </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>The supply, to be taken from its Shibushi tank in southwestern Japan, will become available to the winning bidder on March 20 or later, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Japan's government said last month that it would release "a few hundred thousand kilolitres" of oil in response to a U.S. request, and the sale would be done as part of a switch in the composition of the types of oil held in the national reserve.</p>
<p>"This is the first round of the planned releases and we will conduct more auctions when we are ready and while we closely watch the international energy markets," an official at the ministry told Reuters.</p>
<p>Global oil prices have slipped by more than US$5 a barrel since the ministry announced the plan late in November, as the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant has raised concerns that fuel demand might decrease.</p>
<p>But industry minister Koichi Hagiuda said earlier this month that Japan's oil release plan remained unchanged despite the drop.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy said earlier this month it will sell 18 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with offers from companies to purchase it due on Jan. 4, as part of the release aimed at cooling fuel prices.</p>
