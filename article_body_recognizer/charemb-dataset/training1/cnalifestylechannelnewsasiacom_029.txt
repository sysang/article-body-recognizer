<h1> 5 best strapless bras for different bust sizes that won't slip or pinch </h1>
<div> <p>A good strapless bra is essential to any wardrobe. Perfect your silhouette with one of these top-rated ones, whether you're an A or a GG.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Tan Wei Lin </a> </div> </div>
<p>They slip, pinch, shift about, or sometimes fit so tightly that they feel almost suffocating. Strapless bras are notoriously difficult to get right, particularly for those with a fuller bust.</p>
<p>Still, they are a wardrobe essential for anyone who enjoys wearing the occasional tube, strappy or off-shouldered outfit, and are also necessary for special-occasion garments like cocktail dresses or bridal gowns. </p>
<p>Perhaps you’ve given up hope on finding the right strapless bra for your size and shape, or have resigned to putting up with the discomfort and unsightliness of wearing an ill-fitting or unflattering one?</p>
<p>CNA Lifestyle lists five in a variety of styles that will answer your needs. These are designed to better withstand gravity and also counter other fit issues that concern comfort, shape and coverage.</p>
<p>BEST CLASSIC: CHANTELLE'S ABSOLUTE INVISIBLE SMOOTH STRAPLESS BRA, S$165</p>
<p>Available at leading department stores. </p>
<p>BEST PUSH-UP: CHALONE'S OCEANE WIRELESS PUSH-UP STRAPLESS BRA, S$89.90</p>
<p>BEST FOR LARGE BUSTS: PRIMADONNA'S DIVINE STRAPLESS BRA, S$159.95</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>BEST FOR SMALL BUSTS: COSABELLA'S NEVER SAY PADDED FLIRTIE BANDEAU, US$69 (S$93)</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>BEST LONG-LINE: LE MYSTERE'S SENSUELLE BUSTIER, US$79 (S$106)</p>
<p>If you’ve never been able to find a strapless bra that fits securely and doesn’t shift, your best option may be to try a bustier style, which will offer added support by way of the extended bodice.</p>
<p>A long-line bra also boasts contouring capabilities, and can help smoothen unsightly bulges below the bra line. It’s a good choice for wearing under fitted garments, such as gowns, as it creates a sleek and flattering silhouette.</p>

<h1> Perks of that plastic: Here's how women can make the most out of their credit card </h1>
<div> <p>With so many different types to choose from, picking one that’s best suited for you is key to enjoying more perks and savings even as you spend. In partnership with UOB.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Karen Tee </a> </div> </div>
<p>When it comes to going cashless, there are few options that beat the convenience of a credit card. </p>
<p>CNA Lifestyle asked some financial gurus to share their hacks and tricks to get the most out of your plastic.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Impulse buying: Why some people can't stop shopping and how not to overspend</a></h3>
<p>WHAT ARE THE MUST-HAVES OF A CREDIT CARD? </p>
<p>For starters, your credit card should be accepted widely both locally and overseas and allow you access to a large ATM network in case you need quick access to cash. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Ladies, here’s how to manage personal finances at different stages of your life</a></h3>
<p>WHAT SHOULD I CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING A CARD TO SUIT MY LIFESTYLE? </p>
<p>Pro tip: Knowing the type of rewards you're interested in is a good way to help you choose the right credit card. For instance, if you are an air miles junkie, pick the card that earns you the most miles for every dollar spent, Choo added.</p>
<p>Most financial experts recommend limiting yourself to one or two cards that best fit your needs to avoid inadvertently overspending. This is because having access to multiple lines of credit might tempt you to bust your budget.</p>
<a>Wiser Wealth</a>. “Focus on your debt repayment while enjoying more points or privileges in lieu of spreading your spending out over too many cards,” she said.
<p>SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LADY’S CARDS AND REGULAR ONES? </p>
<p>A regular card typically serves the needs of the general masses while a lady’s card tends to be more targeted towards the lifestyle patterns of women. </p>
<p>Still, each credit card has its own value proposition and may have different sign-on offers from time to time, so the best thing to do is to keep an eye out for offers that are most relevant and appealing to you.</p>

<p>WHAT ARE SOME HACKS TO MAXIMISE THE PERKS? </p>
<p>You might also want to take note of merchants that offer promotions with the credit card. Those additional discounts, one-for-one deals or bonus miles can help you get more out of your spending.</p>
<p>Do always pay your credit card bill in full and on time to avoid interest and late-fee charges. It is also prudent to find out what the minimum spend on the card is to enjoy the annual fee waiver.</p>

<h1> Fitted or flared? One woman's search for the perfect pair of yoga pants </h1>
<div> <p>Lululemon’s discontinued flared yoga pants, widely credited with kickstarting the athleisure trend, is back. But does it still hold the same allure or have people moved on?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Serene Seow </a> </div> </div>
<p>Not unlike women looking for Mr Right, the search for the perfect pair of yoga pants can sometimes be an elusive, even futile, search.</p>
<p>I'm speaking from experience, after a trial class at a now-defunct yoga centre in the leafy depths of Serangoon Gardens eventually led to me becoming a daily disciple of hatha yoga for several years after.</p>
<p>At that time, Lululemon’s high-waisted, flared Groove were the yoga pants to wear. Everyone who was serious about her practice got on her mat in a pair. So naturally, I wore one.</p>
<p>That would have spelled the end of my relationship with yoga (and yoga pants). But thanks to COVID-19, I recently started to crave getting back on that mat again. The hefty burden of many extra pandemic pounds finally broke the sleep spell.</p>
<p>Despite not practising for some time, I fervently remembered yoga to be a ritual that involves being "present". Unfortunately, my yoga wardrobe of yore no longer served my present body. </p>
<p>Getting new yoga wear became paramount. So, several clicks of the mouse later, I quickly got up to date with the latest togs and found something curious.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing I observed: Only Lululemon peddles the revived Groove pant (S$152) specifically as yoga wear. </p>
<p>To me, they're all the same: Flared yoga pants. And they're back. Just like me.</p>
<p>But what was behind the resurgence of this trend?</p>
<p>But while I was pleasantly surprised to see flared yoga pants back on the shelves, a quick survey around yoga centres showed that other yoginis aren’t tripping over themselves to embrace this new-again trend. </p>
<p>Presenter and celebrity yoga instructor Denise Keller for one is not buying into it. “I think the flared pants won’t make any sense in a strong Ashtanga practice where binds are common especially around the ankles,” she told me.</p>
<p>Seah agreed, "I can see how a very large flare might not work for certain poses such as inversions. I would say, be sensible about it, and pick pieces that flatter and will work for the activity in question."</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Fitted or flared, a yoga pant that fits your body and your choice of activity is the best pant. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>So what are women looking for in a good pair of yoga pants? While every yogini may have a different answer that spans form to fit, at its core, it is how the pants cater to the well-being of the wearer, offering solutions to movement.</p>
<p>From a designer's point of view, Seah believes that a good pair of yoga pants should not restrict movement in any way.</p>
<p>"When designing, comfort and practicality are as important to me as fashion and style," Seah said. "They need to be lightweight yet be able to hold in any wobbly bits. The material should be soft and comfortable; almost feel like second skin."</p>
<p>Speaking from a practitioner’s point of view, the 39-year-old Keller shared, “Choice of material is very important in a pair of yoga leggings. I need them soft to the skin, but supportive enough to practice”.</p>
<p>Keller summed up the mindset. “I’m a minimalist yogi – once I like the material and design, I stick with it for life.”</p>
<p>Fitted or flared, yoga pants that fit your body and your choice of activity is the best pair. </p>

<h1> Meet these young women who are turning passion into profit – all while still in school </h1>
<div> <p>Oct 11 is officially International Day of the Girl Child. CNA Women puts the spotlight on these inspiring youngsters you can comfortably describe as serial entrepreneur, social advocate and content creator. And they’re not even 16. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Hidayah Salamat </a> </div> </div>
<p>If Forbes had a 16 under 16 list, these girls could very well be in the running for it.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the United Nations (UN) declared Oct 11 the International Day of the Girl Child to promote the need to recognise and fulfil girls’ rights, address the unique challenges they face around the world, and empower them. </p>
<p>“Adolescent girls have the right to a safe, educated and healthy life, not only during these critical formative years but also as they mature into women,” said the UN on its website. </p>
<p>To mark the day, the UN is encouraging the global community to share stories of “inspiring adolescent girls” and “amplify their leadership, actions and impact to inspire others”.</p>
<p>And as CNA Women found out, there are three living right here in Singapore.</p>
<p>Amid the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pressures of school, Casey Chen, Derya Okten and Lara Manchharam have tapped into their passions and turned them into side hustles – a feat that even adults would struggle with. </p>
<p>For Casey, 15, crafting handmade jewellery was a hobby she first picked up from her mother. </p>
<p>“I learned to make charms and necklaces from my mum, who does a lot of handcrafted things like soap, jewellery, crystals, phone covers and a lot more,” she told CNA Women. </p>
<p>This year, it occurred to her that starting a small business would be a “win-win situation”.</p>
<p>“I don’t only get to showcase my jewellery and creativity, I can also earn some pocket money,” said the Springfield Secondary School student. </p>
<p>Her accessories are priced between S$3.50 and S$15.</p>
<p>“The designs on my Instagram are all edited by me. I design them with patterns and colour code them. If the background and jewellery look good, and fit the feed of my Instagram, I will post it,” she said. </p>
<p>And she didn’t stop there. Like many Instagram sellers, Casey has another account, @crystalicas, where she sells – you guessed it – crystals and crystal jewellery.</p>
<p>While reaching a wider audience remains a challenge, she loves seeing others appreciate her designs, which motivates her to keep going.</p>
<p>“It’s fascinating how you are able to do things you thought you couldn’t and that feeling of achievement gives me fulfilment,” she said.</p>
<p>Her advice for those who want to follow her lead? “If you want to start a small business, go ahead – it might not work the first, second or even third time but if you’re determined, I’m sure you will succeed.”</p>
<p>Like Casey, Derya Okten said customer satisfaction is the pillar of a successful business, adding that it has to be “something you’re passionate about” and of course, it needs to make money. </p>
<p>The founder of <a>Olaf Organics</a>, a natural soap and perfume store on Etsy, said she was inspired by members of her extended family, some of whom are entrepreneurs. </p>
<p>“I also like creating and trying something new. The idea of combining creativity with what I learned from my family and their support gave me the confidence to give entrepreneurship a try,” said the 13-year-old. </p>
<p>Derya’s mother, Berna Okten, said her daughter has been experimenting with different mediums of art since she was younger and this evolved into a business venture.</p>
<p>“After I took some courses on fragrances and experimented with soap-making, my brother and I talked about selling soap instead,” she added.</p>
<p>Okten said her daughter handles all the aspects of her business, from product creation to delivery.</p>
<p>Derya spends about three hours a week making the soap, experimenting with new products and creating content for her online pages.</p>
<p>At the moment, Derya’s earnings “pretty much just cover cost” as she “sells a few every once in awhile”, uses quality ingredients and donates to charity.</p>
<p>“My background is in finance so I explain to Derya and her brother the basics of business, like inventory management, cost containment and marketing, in the simplest form," said Okten.</p>
<p>“Apart from being a perfect canvas for her creativity, this business taught her simple business concepts that she can apply to all areas of her life in the future."</p>
<p>Derya’s brother continues to actively participate in his sister’s work. </p>
<p>“My brother and I decided on the artwork (for the business). For example, for our coffee soap collection, it was his idea to have a woody nature vibe to the photos to complement the black, white and brown of the soaps. </p>
<p>“I’m in charge of the social media posts and our Etsy store, and my brother helps with inventory, pricing and packing,” Derya told CNA Women. </p>
<p>Other than her family, Derya draws support from her friends, a few of whom will be helping out at the upcoming Makers’ Market at Scape, where Olaf Organics will have a stand for the first time. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Do what you're passionate about, not what others expect you to do. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>For Derya, having a business boosts her sense of “self-success”, particularly in knowing that her products “can be really important to your customers”.</p>
<p>“You also have a boost in independence and are provided with a lot of learning opportunities to grow as well as having that freedom with your imagination and your creativity. It also helps with pocket money.”</p>
<p>And what does she have to say to other young aspiring businesswomen? </p>
<p>“Do something you’re passionate about, not what others expect you to do; be patient and don’t be scared to experiment; and be prepared to fail – as my mum says, we learn most from our mistakes than our successes.”</p>
<p>Lara Manchharam has always been a “creative little businesswoman”, said her mother Shireena Shroff Manchharam. </p>
<p>“She has had 100 ideas, from creating perfumes and selling handmade slimes to having a story published in a book, starting an anti-bullying campaign and raising money for the SPCA,” Manchharam told CNA Women. </p>
<p>“I absolutely love her ingenuity and bravery when it comes to doing exactly what she wants in exactly her own way,” she added.</p>
<p>Lara’s website is a work-in-progress so orders typically come through <a>Manchharam’s own Instagram page</a>.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, I just wake up with crazy ideas in my mind and want to build on that idea, but with candles, I felt it was something I would put a lot of work into. </p>
<p>“Lighting candles brings joy to me because you are surrounded by this lovely scent that makes you feel happy and helps you focus on the positive,” said Lara, who studies at Singapore American School.</p>
<p>The 11-year-old has always wanted to be a businesswoman, inspired by her mother, who “created so many different businesses that pushed me to think more about what I can do”. </p>
<p>“I will always give my mum credit because she constantly encourages me to try harder and stay organised!” she said. </p>
<p>Manchharam told CNA Women she ran a handbag label when Lara was just “a few years old”.</p>
<p>For Lara, running a business is an opportunity to leave her comfort zone – “it forces me to have a plan and achieve my goals instead of sitting around playing”.</p>
<p>“It makes me feel good when I reach my goals.”</p>
<p>Lara dedicates five to seven hours a week to her business, using this time to make candles, work on packaging or “working on the Excel spreadsheet”. </p>
<p>She said what she enjoys most about the business is the creative aspect – it makes her feel good to create a candle that is enjoyed by others.</p>
<p>Doing this creative work also makes her “less likely to use technology and other devices that waste time”. </p>
<p>And what of the parts she doesn’t really enjoy? “When I don’t have the right information about what a customer wants and they don’t like something about my business – that brings down my confidence.”</p>
<p>“But I always tell myself that no one is perfect and I always look at my mum never giving up and being determined, which keeps me going. </p>
<p>“My advice to others is that when you have an idea in your head, write it down and make a plan to get there, and go for it. Be the person you want to become!”</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Singapore's total fertility rate falls to historic low in 2020 </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore's total fertility rate (TFR) fell to a historic low of 1.1 last year, said Minister in the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) Indranee Rajah on Friday (Feb 26). </p>
<p>She said that the COVID-19 pandemic caused some Singaporeans to postpone their marriage, resulting in about 10 per cent fewer marriages last year than in 2019. Others have delayed their parenthood plans, she added.</p>
<p>Ms Indranee, who oversees the National Population and Talent Division under the PMO, was speaking in Parliament during the Committee of Supply debate. </p>
<p>East Asian societies like South Korea and Taiwan, as well as Scandinavian countries known for achieving good fertility outcomes like Finland and Norway also experienced a drop in TFR, she noted.</p>
<p>"Raising fertility is an uphill task for advanced societies, but we must continue to support those who wish to marry and have children," said Ms Indranee, who is also Second Minister for Finance and for National Development.</p>
<p>She announced during the debate that the Government will increase its dollar-for-dollar matching in the Child Development Account for a second child from S$3,000 to S$6,000.</p>
<p>TFR refers to the average number of live-births each woman would have during her reproductive years. The resident TFR has been gradually declining over the past decades and was 1.14 in 2019.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Government to double matching amount in CDA to S$6,000 for second child</a></h3>
<p>Ms Indranee also told MPs that Singapore will continue to "carefully calibrate" the pace of immigration.</p>
<p>In 2020, Singapore gained about 21,100 new citizens and 27,500 new permanent residents. These figures are lower than previous years due to travel restrictions and operational issues arising from COVID-19, she said.</p>
<p>Depending on how the COVID-19 situation evolves, these applicants could be granted PR or citizenship in the coming months, and may add to the numbers normally granted this year, Ms Indranee said.</p>
<p>"The Government continues to maintain a tight stance on our foreign worker manpower policy," she said.</p>

<div> <div> <a> Grace Yeoh </a> </div> </div>
<p>The one-hour panel discussion on board diversity was held in conjunction with the 30% Club, a global initiative led by chairpersons and CEOs to increase gender diversity at board and senior management levels.</p>
<p>The panel discussion was attended by more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Ms Cairns, who was one of the panellists, highlighted Mastercard’s maternity and paternity leave in more than 200 countries that gives employees four months of full-paid leave. </p>
<p>“As a manager, you’re not looking at a young woman thinking she’s going to have a baby. You’re looking at a person thinking they’re going to be a parent. That changes the playing field right away,” she said. </p>
<p>Having things such as emergency childcare in place, she added, would ease the burden for parents, as they know that they can still do their job even if their support “disappears”. </p>
<p>“We could go backwards this year. It’s up to companies and governments to think what they need to do to start to arrest that regression,” she said.</p>
<h3><a>Commentary: The struggle mums in their 30s, 40s face juggling young kids and work is real</a></h3>
<p>FROM DIVERSITY TO INCLUSION</p>
<p>It is also important that diversity at senior management level isn't just a PR exercise, but affects fundamental decisions, noted the panellists. </p>
<p>“You need to have a minimum of 30 per cent, with an aspiration to get to 40 or even 50 per cent. That’s where change comes, and you get decisions being made from different perspectives,” she said.</p>
<p>The whole philosophy behind the “30 per cent” rule of thumb, added Ms Cairns, is that “you stop being a minority”. </p>
<p>“It’s not just the boardroom you have to worry about. It’s what your employees look like, what communities you’re serving, what you're actually saying to your customers out in the markets,” she added. </p>
<p>However, “diversity for diversity's sake” might not always work, especially when there’s a need to balance diversity with “domain knowledge”, said Mr Piyush Gupta, CEO of DBS Group. </p>
<p>Asked what a gender inclusive workplace looks like, Ms Wakefield Evans said it’s ultimately “a safe place”. </p>
<p>“It’s a feeling that someone can bring their whole person to work … but also providing the same opportunity for everybody to be advanced, assessed, promoted, and paid,” she added.</p>
<h3><a>The Big Read: Gender equality in Singapore remains elusive amid entrenched attitudes about women’s roles</a></h3>
<p>DIVERSITY DRIVES THE BOTTOM LINE </p>
<p>Diversity can also affect a company’s profits, the panellists said. </p>
<p>“The data is out there to look at, and that’s what investors are looking at when they say, we want change because we think it will make the companies perform better and be more sustainable,” said Ms Cairns. </p>
<p>She added that women make up half the human race, and about half the university cohort in many countries. </p>
<p>“What kind of leaders would we be if we said we were going to choose people from half the graduating class? None of us are doing that at the entry level. And yet, we’re doing that at the top of companies,” she said. </p>
<p>Getting investors more engaged with the diversity agenda is another crucial step, added Mr Gupta.</p>
<p>The panel discussion was part of BoardAgender’s 10th anniversary this year.</p>
<p>Later this month, BoardAgender will also roll out an inaugural mentorship programme for aspiring women directors, where 10 “board-ready women” will be mentored by 10 seasoned board directors for six months.</p>

<h1> Impulse buying: Why some people can't stop shopping and how not to overspend </h1>
<div> <p>There’s no harm in a little splurge every now and then but can you spot the warning signs? CNA Lifestyle asks the experts and offers tips on how to be a wiser shopper. In partnership with UOB.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Karen Tee </a> </div> </div>
<p>Raise your hands if any of these suspiciously sound like the internal monologues you have when you’re out shopping.</p>
<p>“The pink lipstick is less orange than the other 20 pink lippies I have at home.”</p>
<p>“I work so hard, I totally deserve this (thing that I never even knew existed until five minutes ago.”</p>
<p>“I just need to find one more S$5 cropped tee to qualify for the S$200 free delivery – even though there is nothing else I need or want. I will be saving so much money on shipping!”</p>
<p>If you find yourself nodding in agreement, it might be time to take a little step back before you whip out your wallet or click “buy”.</p>
<p>Rationalisations like these are a warning sign that you could be starting to overspend, which in turn might lead to a strain on your personal financial goals if left unchecked.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Ladies, here’s how to manage personal finances at different stages of your life</a></h3>
<p>“An impulse towards overbuying is a form of medicating ourselves to escape our busy minds,” explained Dr Perpetua Neo, a psychologist and leadership coach. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> An impulse towards overbuying is a form of medicating ourselves to escape our busy minds. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>But over time, this coping behaviour has the potential to escalate.</p>
<p>“Quite often, small-ticket overshopping can be the metaphorical gateway drug towards bigger items, because you learn to become more comfortable with spending and with a bigger total amount,” added Dr Neo.</p>
<p>So, with time, it’s not impossible for that S$2 Daiso spree to escalate to Gucci sneakers and Chanel handbags to get that hit of exhilaration as you walk out of the shop with a shiny new purchase in hand.</p>
<p>E-commerce and shopping apps add to the temptation since you really do not have to try very hard to spend your moolah.</p>
<p>To grab consumers’ attention, many e-tailers also offer up a slew of promotions that can feel hard to resist.</p>
<p>And when you receive an alert for online flash deals with countdown timers or notices that only a few items are left in stock, be aware that these can trigger a sense of urgency.</p>
<p>“In Singapore where we are already hardwired with kiasu and kiasi mentalities, these are a Molotov cocktail that may implode in your face and bank balance,” she added.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Deals and coupons make you spend money but are framed to prime your mind to believe you’re saving money. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>To get a sense of how dependent you are on shopping for the feel good vibes, take note of how you feel after that initial dopamine rush fades away.</p>
<p>Those feelings of guilt may even cause some individuals to lie about how much they spend on shopping and buying or resort to great lengths to conceal their purchases from their family and friends. </p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> We often refer – quite frivolously – to this emotional spending as ‘retail therapy’. The name is misleading, as it implies the act will improve mental health – the opposite is far more likely. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Of course, there is nothing wrong with appreciating the finer things in life. As Dr Neo said, “If you are an adult in control of your money, by all means, spend away.”</p>
<p>Still, there’s no doubt every one of us loves the satisfaction of being a smart shopper. So, here are five hacks to help you steer clear of overspending so you can enjoy the pleasure of shopping sans the guilt.</p>
<p>COMMIT TO A FINANCIAL PLAN</p>
<p>To genuinely change your spending habits, you will need to make a commitment, said Kennedy. For instance, “pay yourself” by transferring a fixed amount to a separate bank account every month before allocating what is left as your “spending money”.</p>
<p>KEEP AN EYE ON CREDIT CARD USAGE</p>
<p>“Have a separate debit card with only a fixed amount of money in the debit card for spending so you can’t impulse buy. Or get rid of multiple credit cards,” said Han.</p>
<p>HAVE AN ACCOUNTABILITY BUDDY</p>
<p>Shop only with friends or relatives who do not compulsively spend so that they can help you to curb your spending, said Han.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile to spend time with a network of friends who prefer to focus on saving and investing, said Kennedy, so that their habits also rub off on you.</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> Women </a> </p> <h5> Why Singapore women should set aside money for health insurance – and how to do it smartly </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> Why Singapore women should set aside money for health insurance – and how to do it smartly </h1>
<div> <p>It’s all about protecting both your health and your wealth, while balancing your protection and savings needs.</p> <p>In partnership with UOB.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Vivian Teo </a> </div> </div>
<p>It is also at this age that I see more elderly loved ones and relatives pass away or be diagnosed with major ailments. The uncertainties in life feel even more pronounced over the past year as I’m inundated almost daily by news of COVID-19.</p>
<p>I bought my first health insurance policy once I started working – and made sure to review my policies with major life changes, like when my first child came along.</p>
<p>However, this is not the case for everyone. </p>
<p>Regardless of the life stage we are in, it is important to ensure we have the right insurance in place to see us through health crises and higher healthcare-related expenses as we age. </p>
<p>CNA Women asked industry experts for useful tips on how women can use health insurance to safeguard their health and well-being.</p>
<p>Health insurance is what would help you pay for your healthcare costs in the event of an injury, illness or disability. </p>
<p>There are five main types of health insurance, one of which is hospital and surgical insurance. Singaporeans and Permanent Residents are automatically covered under MediShield Life, regardless of age and health condition. </p>
<p>Administered by the Central Provident Fund Board, the basic hospital and surgical insurance plan helps to pay for large hospital bills and selected costly outpatient treatments, such as dialysis and chemotherapy. </p>
<p>START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE</p>
<p>Topics like cancer and death may not feel like pressing issues when you are young. But financial experts recommend getting health insurance as soon as you can afford to and when you are in good health.</p>
<p>Eugenia Tan, Head of Emerging Affluent and Mass Segments at Prudential Singapore, said: “Everyone should have basic health insurance in place right from birth. As we grow older and our needs change, we should add on coverage accordingly.” </p>
<p>For instance, when you’re planning to have children, you can consider maternity insurance that provides coverage in the event of complications during the pregnancy and after birth, she said. </p>
<p>CONSIDER THE COVERAGE YOU NEED</p>
<p>The critical illness protection gap is the shortfall in the amount of money needed to meet one’s financial needs before one is able to return to work. </p>
<p>Financial experts also advise maintaining a savings balance of at least six months of your monthly expenses as emergency funds. </p>
<p>The amount you need for a rainy day may be even higher if you have dependants and have to factor in their daily needs if you are unable to provide income for them over an extended period of time. </p>
<p>And as every woman has her own specific needs and expectations of care, industry experts said it is important to work with a qualified financial consultant or adviser to figure out how much coverage you require.</p>
<p>BALANCE PROTECTION WITH AFFORDABILITY </p>
<p>He noted that about 70 per cent of Singapore residents have Integrated Shield Plans, where some cover for a higher-type ward (A or B1) in a public hospital, while others cover admission into a private hospital. </p>
<p>However, two-thirds of all patients choose B2 or C subsidised wards when they are admitted to hospitals, such that they may not have fully enjoyed the benefits of the plans, he said.</p>
<p>“You should always aim to save before you spend every month,” he added. “You don’t want to be insurance-rich but cash-poor.”</p>
<p>Though this can vary among individuals, he recommended a minimum savings of at least 10 per cent of your net pay, and not spending more than 10 per cent of your annual income on insurance premiums, as a guideline. </p>
<p>BUY WHAT MEETS YOUR NEEDS</p>
<p>You should also only buy what you need by taking into account your family health history, financial situation, assets, liabilities and dependants’ needs.</p>
<p>Over-insuring happens when your coverage is more than your current liabilities and your family’s potential loss of income, said Leaf Tan, a personal wealth manager with 25 years of experience in managing insurance and retirement portfolios.</p>
<p>Prudential’s Tan noted it is quite rare to see customers over-insure. </p>
<p>You might also want to do so with with every life milestone, like when you start a family, while staying up-to-date with any major changes in premiums, benefits or policy rules to ensure your coverage remains relevant.</p>
<p>BE AWARE THAT NOT EVERYTHING IS COVERED</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the features of your policies and their exclusions. While MediShield Life covers pre-existing conditions, most private insurance policies do not do so. </p>
<p>GET YOUR OWN EVEN IF YOU HAVE COMPANY COVERAGE</p>
<p>Even if you have company insurance, it is best to purchase your own health insurance. A company’s insurance coverage ceases once you leave or retire from the company. </p>
<p>When that happens, you may not be healthy enough to get your own health insurance, and a company also has the right to change its corporate insurance coverage, said Leaf Tan.</p>
<p>“The amount and type of insurance provided by employers also varies from organisation to organisation and may not meet the full spectrum of one’s needs.”</p>

<h1> Single or married, here’s how a Singapore woman can buy her first home </h1>
<div> <p>Here’s what you need to do to unlock this life achievement, whether it’s buying your own bachelorette pad or putting down roots on a dream home with your partner.</p> <p>In partnership with UOB.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Vivian Teo </a> </div> </div>
<p>I remember what it was like when I bought my first property with my husband. There was the jubilation of finally having our own place to start our family, and excitement over how we were going to renovate and do up our first home.</p>
<p>But truth be told, there were also times we felt overwhelmed doing our sums to see if we could afford the place we had our eyes on, while searching for home loans and trying to understand jargon like “option-to-purchase” and “conveyancing fees”. </p>
<p>It was exciting, but also daunting. After all, your first home is likely one of the most expensive purchases you’ll make in your life. </p>
<p>But fret not. You can make the journey more manageable with some smart planning.</p>
<p>CNA Lifestyle spoke to financial and property experts to give you a step-by-step guide on how you can own your first home, whether it’s your own bachelorette pad or a home to put down roots with your partner. </p>
<p>STEP 1: KNOW YOUR NEEDS AND GOALS</p>
<p>“Someone who is single and intends to remain so for the next 10 years will have different housing needs from a couple who plans to have two kids in the next five years,” said Pow Ying Khuan, a real estate analyst at property portal 99.co.</p>
<p>“Understanding your life needs will help you to decide the most important factors and considerations when it comes to buying your first home, especially in terms of sizes and locations,” he added.</p>
<p>You can check listings on property websites to do initial research on the areas you are interested in, to get a sense of what is available in the market, then shortlist the ones you’re interested in, suggested Pow. </p>
<p>You can also engage an agent to assist with shortlisting units. A trusted agent can provide valuable advice when you are viewing units and negotiating prices, as well as help with the paperwork after you have decided on your purchase, he said.</p>
<p>At this stage, it would also be good to check your eligibility to purchase the property and understand your post-purchase obligations. </p>
<p>And if you’re buying a Housing Development Board (HDB) resale flat with a housing grant or a new HDB flat, a post-purchase obligation would be that you need to hold the flat for at least five years before you can sell it. </p>
<p>You can find all this information on the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the HDB websites.</p>
<p>STEP 2: BREAK DOWN YOUR COSTS</p>
<p>After figuring out the type of property you prefer, the next step would be to understand the costs involved. </p>
<p>It noted that in the first quarter of this year, the median resale price of an HDB flat ranged from S$320,000 for a three-room flat to S$545,500 for a five-room flat.</p>
<p>As for condominiums, these can cost anywhere from S$600,000 to a few million dollars depending on size and location. </p>
<p>You would also need to set aside a budget for one-off costs such as renovation and furniture.</p>
<div> <div> <div><p>STEP 3: CHECK YOUR AFFORDABILITY</p></div> </div> </div>
<p>Next, check if your dream home is affordable by taking into account your earnings and expenses.</p>
<p>Chung advised that the rule of thumb for first-time home buyers is to “ensure you have enough cash for about 30 per cent of the purchase price to pay for the downpayment and any additional fees that arise at the start of the transaction”. </p>
<p>“Your monthly mortgage payments should also not exceed one-third of your monthly salary,” she added.</p>
<p>STEP 4: RECONSIDER YOUR PREFERENCES </p>
<p>The potential future gains may see some opt for private housing over public housing but affordability should still be key, said financial experts. </p>
<p>STEP 5: SET A SAVINGS GOAL</p>
<p>After understanding the upfront costs and monthly payments required for buying your property, you should then work backwards to figure out how much of your monthly salary you would need to set aside regularly and by when, said UOB’s Chung. </p>
<p>The budgeting process can be made easier with financial tools like the UOB Mighty app which can help you monitor your expenses and savings.</p>
<p>One can also follow the popular 50:30:20 rule which states that up to 50 per cent of your income should go to needs and obligations, 30 per cent to things you want and 20 per cent to savings.</p>
