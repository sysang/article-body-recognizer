<li>There are cultural and social constraints to change; similarly, one's self-image may be a hinderance. However, those same factors can also help.</li>
<li>Work and play are helpful strategies for change. The former stresses what needs to be done. The latter explores new ways of finding enjoyment.</li>
<li>Useful too are communion and ritual. Communion signals the role of supportive others; ritual reveals how chosen behaviors stabilize and inspire.</li>

<a>coaching</a> from a coach or family member, or worries about letting down teammates.
<p>Treatment for anxiety related to athletic performance can be directed at teaching the athletes how to:</p>
<li>Deal better with anxiety, which can prevent the development of associated physical symptoms or increased psychological distress.</li>
<li>Improve their athletic performance, including through engagement in sufficient practice and use of <a>hypnosis</a> techniques. This helps them feel more confident, and thus reduces their anxiety.</li>
<p>To deal better with anxiety and improve athletic performance, a good place to start is to learn how to relax effectively. This can be done through the use of:</p>
<li>Slow, deep breathing using the diaphragm, which leads to abdominal expansion during inhalation.</li>
<li>Hypnotic imagery, by imagining what might be perceived with each of the senses in a relaxing place.</li>
<li>Focusing on body relaxation, one muscle group at a time. Sometimes, it helps to tense muscle groups before relaxing them.</li>
<li><a>Positive self-talk</a>, including the use of words such as "calm," "relax," "breathe," and "easy."</li>
<li>Listening to music, which can be calming or engaging, depending on an athlete's preference.</li>
<li>Smiling, which can trigger the body's relaxation response based on life-long associations of smiling with pleasant situations.</li>
