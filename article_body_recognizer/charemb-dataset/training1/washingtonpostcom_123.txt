<a>The study</a>, which has not yet been peer reviewed,
<b> </b>looked at hospital admissions from mid-November to mid-December, as the country experienced a wave of omicron infections, and compared the boosted health-care workers with people who had not been vaccinated.
<b> </b>It found that the booster was about 85 percent effective in preventing hospital admissions from covid-19,
<b> </b>one to two months after the second dose.
<p>In<a> a statement </a>shared Thursday, Johnson Johnson said that the preliminary findings demonstrated the booster’s effectiveness in the face of a highly transmissible omicron variant of the virus, which is now dominant in South Africa.</p>
<div><div><p>The research authors noted that their analysis had limitations, including short follow-up times in the study.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Our analysis shows that a booster shot of the Johnson Johnson COVID-19 vaccine generated a robust increase in both neutralizing antibodies and T-cells to Omicron,” he added.</p></div></div>
<a> authorized </a>its booster shot. However, this month the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna shots over Johnson Johnson,
<a>citing concerns</a> over the increased risk of a potentially fatal blood clot issue.
<div><div><p>The new findings come as countries across the world move to contain the spread of the contagious variant, imposing stringent <a>lockdowns</a>, reintroducing restrictions and canceling public <a>New Year’s Eve</a> events.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>From across Europe to the United States, governments around the world are continuing to urge people to get vaccinated or go for their booster shots.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Calls for boosters and for the unvaccinated to change their minds have been further amplified by the omicron outbreak. The pandemic has claimed almost 823,000 lives in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University data.</p></div>

<div><div><p>A “twindemic” of covid-19 and influenza is a recipe for public health nightmares.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Flu practically vanished last year. Now doctors are bracing for potential ‘twindemic’ of flu and covid-19 spikes.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Efforts to track flu cases face obstacles, as flu tests are not ubiquitous and the illness can be confused with others, including covid-19. But many health-care systems track hospitalizations for flu-like symptoms.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And some countries, such as Brazil, are battling out of season flu outbreaks as they brace for the full effects of the fast-spreading omicron variant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Israel</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Israel recorded no influenza cases during its 2020 flu season. This year, hospitals are nearing capacity with flu cases just as coronavirus cases are starting to climb.</p></div></div>
<a>according to the Israeli Center for Disease Control</a>. Of those, 239 were in pediatric wards and 39 in maternity wards.
<div><div><p>By the month’s end, the Ministry of Health said <a>1,849 people were hospitalized with the flu</a>, including 605 children and 124 pregnant women.</p></div></div>

<a>20 percent in 2019</a>, according to the Ministry of Health.
<div><div><h3><div>Australia</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Australia kept its borders shut to travelers for much of the past two years. That’s also likely helped keep the flu at bay.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Infections nosedived in 2020, when Australia recorded around 20,000 flu cases and 37 deaths.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But then flu infections dropped even further in 2021, with Australia recording less than 500 cases and no related deaths that season. Australia’s Department of Health <a>logged</a> just one hospitalization.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The whole influenza world is topsy-turvy at the moment,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Brazil</div></h3></div></div>
<a>according to the Brazilian Report.</a>
<a>Brazil’s state media reported. </a>
<a> told Brazilian media </a>in mid-December that the rate of flu hospitalizations over the past week had been higher than during the flu’s typically peak period from March to June.
<div><p>São Paulo says it has fully vaccinated 100 percent of its adults. Will it be enough to stop omicron?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Out-of-season outbreaks are not uncommon in Brazil, especially this year, Harris said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Last year, <a>flu cases dropped </a>across the Southern Hemisphere. But this winter’s outbreak is particularly worrying for public health officials, because it comes alongside a rise in coronavirus cases.</p></div></div>
<a>yearly influenza vaccine drives </a>that target people above the age of 60, children, and other high-risk groups like health-care professionals. As a result, a relatively
<a>high rate of older</a> Brazilians are vaccinated against the flu. The country has also given out enough coronavirus shots to immunize some 78 percent of its population,

<a>unwilling to comply</a> with public health recommendations that would slow the spread of the virus.”
<div><div><p>The other countries in the top 10: Australia, Finland, Canada, Thailand, Slovenia, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Korea and Sweden.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For instance, it found that the United States had more capacity to prevent and respond to epidemics than any other country, but it also had <a>more reported cases and deaths</a> than any other nation.</p></div></div>
<p>Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, agreed with the report’s bottom line. “No country is adequately prepared and there’s a need for urgent action to address that,” he said.</p>
<div><div><p>But, he added, “we need assessments that monitor the actual performance of health systems.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Yet another holiday season is here and the threat of the coronavirus continues to hover over family gatherings, annual parties and other festive traditions. As you make plans, here are three checklists to help.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Questions to ask your relatives before gathering for an indoor holiday meal</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>• What precautions do you plan to take and would you like others to do the same?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• Are you fully vaccinated? Have you received a booster shot?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• Are you traveling from an area with a high coronavirus transmission rate or low vaccination rate?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• Do you have a high-risk medical condition that puts you at risk of severe covid-19?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• In the two weeks leading up to the gathering, will you limit exposure by skipping higher-risk activities like eating at indoor restaurants or interacting with unvaccinated people?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• Do you agree to get tested a few days before the party?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• If the group decides to require masks when not eating, will you keep yours on?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• Will you let everyone know if you have any symptoms two weeks before the party or if you’ve been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the coronavirus?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>• If you don’t feel well the day of the gathering, do you agree to stay home?</p></div></div>
<div><p>How to weigh coronavirus risks this holiday season: Is it safe to visit Santa at the mall? Can chips-and-dip come out of retirement?</p></div>

<p>When Carole Griffin, a baker in Birmingham, Ala., read The Post’s story about Clark in 2019, it prompted her to reveal an unlikely connection.</p>
<p>In an email to The Post, Griffin said that she had information pertinent to that story. And later, she alleged that a prominent figure in the D.C. criminal justice system had committed a sexual assault decades earlier.</p>
<div><p>Listen to Carole, in an excerpt from Chapter 1</p></div>
<div><div>“I appreciate your reporting and the work you do around this issue. It’s truly making a difference for survivors like myself.” </div></div>
<div><div>“In fact, the grace it has afforded me has compelled me to pay it forward. It is the inspiration for my reaching out to you. Best to you. Carole.” </div></div>
<h3>The search for evidence</h3>
<p>What does it take to report a story like this one?</p>
<p>Investigating a sexual assault allegation requires a high level of sensitivity, and before these stories can ever be published, they go through a rigorous process of vetting.</p>
<p>On-the-record interviews, family photographs and decades-old journals all served as key evidence in attempting to corroborate Griffin’s account.</p>
<p>The support systems around a survivor can often influence their decision to come forward. So what happens when a family has to reckon with the consequences of long-kept secrets?</p>
<p>And when faced with the allegations, how will the accused respond?</p>
<p>It wasn’t just about what was done to them. It was about what they did in response.</p>

<h1>Russia allows methane leaks at planet’s peril</h1>
<div><span><div>John Muyskens</div> and </span></div>
<div><span><div>Naema Ahmed</div></span></div>
<p>On the morning of Friday, June 4, an underground gas pipeline running through the ancient state of Tatarstan sprang a leak. And not a small one.</p>
<p>In a different era, the massive leak might have gone unnoticed.</p>
<div><div><div><canvas/></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><p><i>Blank slide</i></p></div></div></div>
<div><div><p>But hovering 520 miles above the Earth, a European Space Agency satellite was keeping watch. The four-year-old Copernicus Sentinel-5P, which orbits the planet 14 times a day, looks for traces of methane and other gases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><p>At 11:01 a.m. in Moscow, the satellite spotted a methane leak on the edge of its field of vision.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><p>On its next pass, 1 hour and 40 minutes later, the sensor captured an even larger view of the leak.</p></div></div></div>
<i>— </i>an invisible but powerful greenhouse gas
<i>— </i>which was escaping into the atmosphere at a breakneck rate of approximately 395 metric tons an hour.
<p>Two weeks later, after inquiries from a geoanalytical firm called Kayrros and from journalists, Gazprom acknowledged the colossal methane release, though the energy company remained secretive, declining to disclose the exact location of the leak.</p>
<p>The episode reflects a fundamental shift in climate politics. Many countries and companies have long misrepresented or simply miscounted how much fossil fuel-based methane they have let escape into the air.</p>
<p>“The atmosphere doesn’t lie,” said Daniel Jacob, an atmospheric scientist at Harvard University<b> </b>who uses satellite measurements to try to interpret the world’s methane emissions.</p>
<p>Methane, the second-most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, accounts for roughly a quarter of global warming since the industrial revolution, according to NASA. It is the chief component of natural gas.</p>
<p>Given Russia’s sprawling oil and gas industry, climate summit watchers say persuading President Vladimir Putin to plug his nation’s leaking pipelines and dial back plans to grow natural gas exports will be important.</p>
<p>The White House’s chief climate negotiator, John F. Kerry, has spent hours with top Russian officials in search of a “road map,” said Ruslan Edelgeriyev, special presidential envoy on climate issues for the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>“We are not trying to hide anything. We do realize that problems exist, and we are trying to find solutions,” Edelgeriyev said, conceding that “at the moment we do not have a complete picture of emissions.”</p>
<p>So far, Russia’s numbers don’t add up, a Post analysis has found:</p>
<mark>4 million metric tons</mark> of methane from the oil and gas sector in 2019, the most recent year reported. But six studies and scientific emissions data sets reviewed by The Post, using various
<mark>14 million tons,</mark> which would make Russia the world’s largest emitter of oil and gas-based methane.
<mark>15.4 million tons,</mark> to
<mark>31.5 million tons,</mark> to
<mark>24.7 million tons,</mark> to
<mark>23.6 million tons,</mark> to
<mark>6.5 million tons,</mark> and — most recently —
<p>How Russia’s methane estimates keep shrinking — on paper</p>
<p>In 2006, Russia told the U.N. that methane emissions going back to 1990 had been around 10 million tons per year from its oil and gas industry.</p>
<div><div><div><p>Since then, Russia has revised its numbers repeatedly, and the changes have sometimes been enormous.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><p>For the year 2016 alone, Russia changed its estimates from 24.9 million tons, to 6.3 million tons, then — most recently — to 4.3 million tons.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><p>Why did the numbers plunge? Russia recalculated, shaving 90.5 percent off of its estimated oil production leaks.</p></div></div></div>
<mark>7.6 million tons</mark> of methane emissions per year — and for the entire country,
<mark>8.3 million tons.</mark> That’s more than twice as high as Russia’s latest reported figure.
<p>The Paris agreement is voluntary, and there is no international mechanism for cracking down on greenhouse gases contaminating the Earth’s air.</p>
<p>But that might be changing. European regulators are planning to open a new front in trade wars, imposing import taxes to penalize companies that sell natural gas in Europe while leaving behind a trail of leaked methane.</p>
<p>At an online event, Devlin said that if the world stopped emitting all the methane it possibly could, the planet would limit global warming by 0.3 degrees Celsius by 2050.</p>
<p>It’s simple, he said. “It’s basically plumbing.”</p>
<h3><b>Shrouded in secrecy</b></h3>
<p>The conditions are harsh. It’s dark for two months in winter, temperatures can drop down to 55 degrees below zero Fahrenheit and it’s frozen seven to nine months of the year.</p>

<p>Yakutia — Russia’s coldest region — has been engulfed by massive wildfires this summer, and Putin told government officials that climate change is to blame, noting that the Arctic is warming nearly three times the global average.</p>
<p>“Methane is natural gas. How can it be harmful to the environment?” he asked. “Methane appears in every life process, from cows to plankton.”</p>
<p>Methane does come from a wide range of sources, from landfills to rice paddies, from abandoned coal mines to hog waste lagoons, from wetlands to thawing permafrost —<b> </b>and in every instance it is also a powerful greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>“Climate projects should be sanctions exempt,” he said. “The companies should be able to have access to finance, equipment and technologies. Otherwise how can they work?”</p>
<p>Gazprom and energy companies Novatek and Lukoil declined The Post’s requests for interviews for this story.</p>
<h3><b>An aging colossus</b></h3>
<p>The sheer size of Russia’s gas infrastructure is one reason to suspect that the nation’s methane emissions dwarf its own most recent estimates.</p>
<p>Gazprom’s pipeline network in Russia is about 110,000 miles long. Pipelines undergo regular maintenance to catch signs of corrosion from gas and moisture. To identify a leak, operators shut down valves at either end of the pipe segment.</p>
<div><div>Oil or natural gas drilling rig</div><div>Wellhead</div><div>Production field</div><div>Processing plant</div><div>Compressor station</div><div>Storage facility</div></div>
<div><div><div><div><p>How methane leaks along a pipeline</p><p>Scroll to continue </p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><p>Methane can escape into the atmosphere all along a pipeline route, from the site of exploratory drilling to markets hundreds of miles away. The three main ways that happens are known as venting, flaring, and leaking.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><p>Empty spacer</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><p>After the drilling rig is removed, it is replaced with a wellhead. Those components can wear down over time, resulting in “fugitive” emissions.</p></div></div></div>
<p>Compressor stations are spaced regularly along pipelines to increase pressure and help keep the gas moving. Machines and valves at stations work under mechanical stress and high temperatures, and components can wear down and become prone to leaks.</p>
<div><div><div><p>Methane that escapes during an accidental leak or planned venting from a well or coal mine into the atmosphere is called a “fugitive emission.”</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><p>Especially large leaks are known as super-emitter events.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><p>Excess natural gas may be placed in storage tanks above or below ground. Aging storage tanks are also susceptible to leaks.</p></div></div></div>
<p>Moreover, Gazprom only faces fines after releases exceed a state-imposed quota.</p>
<p>Among the biggest sources of methane emissions are compressor stations, located roughly every 150 miles along the pipelines. Gazprom, which owns two-thirds of Russia’s gas industry, has 254 of them.</p>
<div><div> Nord Stream 2, which will double the pipeline’s capacity once completed, cuts across the Baltic Sea, linking Russia to Germany. (Jens Büttner/Picture Alliance/Getty Images)</div></div>
<p>That occurrence was not an isolated one.</p>
<p>Flaring takes place when gas is discovered along with oil and there is no infrastructure to capture it. Faulty or inefficient flares, however, can let large quantities of methane slip by into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Even flaring doesn’t work efficiently. About 20 percent of the methane escapes the combustion of flares. Davis estimates that energy from the field’s lost methane would drive the equivalent of 1.7 million gasoline-fueled cars for a year.</p>
<p>That is the power — and promise — of the new sentinels in the sky.</p>
<p>“It’s a revolution, there’s no doubt about it,” said Steven Hamburg, chief scientist for the Environmental Defense Fund.</p>
<p>For Antoine Halff, satellite data has been a game-changer.</p>
<mark>14 million tons</mark> of oil and gas-related methane emissions, sharply higher than what Moscow is currently reporting for the most recent year, 2019.
<p>If the leaked methane were converted into tons of carbon dioxide, it would nearly equal the total emissions claimed for all sources in Turkey.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t really fix the methane problem before,” said Halff, blaming “a lack of knowledge, a lack of transparency about the market and a lack of incentives.”</p>
<p>Now, however, he said, “we are exposing the true footprint of the industry, which is actually even larger than we thought and certainly larger than traditional technologies of reporting emissions have suggested until now.”</p>
<h3><b>Sentinels in the sky</b></h3>
<p>Tracking down methane emissions demands scientific rigor, a bit of art and a lot of computing power.</p>
<p>Because methane gas absorbs light at a unique set of wavelengths, it leaves behind a distinct spectral signature.</p>
<p>“This can be done at lightspeed with AI and simply could not be done at all by hand,” Halff said.</p>
<p>The in-depth analysis “consistently suggests that the country’s latest inventory emissions are underreporting,” said EDF atmospheric scientist Ritesh Gautam, who conducted the research along with colleagues at Harvard.</p>
<p>Other satellite analyses show similar results.</p>
<p>Official Russian calculations are much more rooted on Earth.</p>
<p>The auditors, she said, are simply using data handed to them.</p>
<p>To calculate emissions, companies use standardized assumptions about the performance of dozens of pieces of equipment, which can differ greatly from the labs where they are tested to the field where they function.</p>

<p>The tax could cost Russian firms $50 billion over the next decade, according to estimates from the country’s leading business lobby.</p>
<p>“Companies no longer have the choice of not doing it,” said Mitrova. “It’s not rocket science.”</p>
<p>“If you find something wrong, you can fix it,” she said. “There is nothing challenging about that, no new frontiers. But something has to be done.”</p>

<header><div><div>Wellness</div></div><div><h1>How to choose the best sleeping position, and why it matters</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Allyson Chiu</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 4, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Several months ago,<b> </b>Mark L. Keam started to notice a sharp pain in his neck that radiated down his left arm and was accompanied by an “electric shock” sensation and constant tingling.</p></div></div>
<div><div>Thousands who ‘followed the rules’ are getting covid. They shouldn’t be ashamed.</div></div>
<p>Here are the pros and cons of different sleep positions, and how to pick the best one for you. We also have advice from experts about appropriate pillows for back, side and stomach sleepers, and tips for learning how to stay in a new position.</p>
<div><p>Do you have a weird question about sleep? We want to hear it.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>On your back</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>For generally healthy people, sleeping on your back, or in the supine position, may help with spine alignment, the experts said. It can also help prevent or ease back and neck pain, because it provides more support.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Some lesser-known culprits for neck and back pain, and what to do about them</p></div>
<div><div><p>Rachel Salas, a sleep neurologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Sleep and Wellness, also recommended using a second pillow or a rolled towel under the knees to prop them up, which can relieve some pressure on the lower back.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although positional therapy, which uses various techniques to help people stop sleeping on their backs, is a treatment option for milder sleep apnea, Pelayo said, it may not be sufficient in moderate or severe cases.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Do you snore? There are health reasons to see a doctor about it.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>On your side</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For the most part, sleeping on the side seems to be the most natural way of sleeping for a lot of people<i>,</i>” Pelayo said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What you need to know about research linking sleep deprivation and dementia</p></div>
<p>If you have shoulder or hip pain, avoid sleeping on the side that’s bothering you, experts said. For chronic back or neck pain, Pelayo said, sleeping on the side might be beneficial, because it can take the pressure off painful areas.</p>
<a>Some research</a> has suggested that sleeping on the right side can exacerbate those symptoms.)
<div><div><p>Sleeping on the left side may also be better for pregnant individuals, Dasgupta said, because it can take pressure off the critical blood vessel that supplies the heart.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sleeping on the right side, however, could be more comfortable for people with enlarged hearts, according to a <a>2003 study</a> published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A pillow between the knees could also help with discomfort or osteoarthritis, Dasgupta said, which may be exacerbated by sleeping with your legs folded together.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>On your front</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dasgupta agreed: “You can imagine your neck is on the side, gravity’s pushing down on your spine, so I’m really not a big fan of sleeping on your stomach.”</p></div></div>
<p>Given the potential increased strain on the body in this position, Morgenthaler said, stomach sleepers may want to avoid using “very thick” pillows, so they don’t put added stress on the cervical spine, shoulders or lower back.</p>
<div><div><p>Still, experts emphasized that sleep positions are individual and you should go with what works for you. “What you want is comfort, and that comfort will help you sleep deeper,” Pelayo said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Good sleep means more than getting enough hours. A consistent schedule matters, too.</p></div>

<div><div>Europe</div><div><h1>With coronavirus variants, the world is learning the Greek alphabet, one grim letter at a time</h1></div></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Chico Harlan</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 14, 2021 at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>“Most of us know certain critical letters — alpha, beta, gamma,” said Jeremy Luban, a virologist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. “And then it starts to get hairy.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Omicron could soon become dominant in some European countries, officials predict</p></div>
<div><div><p>Well before the pandemic, there were alpha particles and gamma rays. Sigma, as any Microsoft Excel user knows, is the symbol for sum. And perhaps no letter is more famous than pi.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For us, this kind of stuff raises no eyebrows,” said one Greek senior government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The official mentioned Facebook’s new corporate name, Meta — commonly used in English to mean “self-referential,” but which in Greek means “after” or “beyond.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s not like they asked us,” the official said with a laugh. “The use of Greek words is rather well-established.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Never did anything I learned as a drunken sorority girl prepare me more for the current world climate as learning the Greek alphabet,” one person wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Britons lament ‘U.K. variant’ label, as highly contagious version of coronavirus spreads around the world</p></div>
<div><div><p>“There was a lot of pressure on the WHO to come up with a solution,” Pallen said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But even the Greek system, it turns out, has some pitfalls.</p></div></div>
<p>When a new, highly mutated variant was discovered in late November, the next letter in line, alphabetically, was nu. But the WHO decided a homophone for “new” would be too confusing. Officials rejected “the new nu variant.”</p>
<div><div><p>Looking ahead, scientists see one other problem. There are countless variants — and probably more significant ones on the way — but the Greek alphabet has just 24 letters, and only nine remain on the list.</p></div></div>
<div><p>What you need to know about the coronavirus variants</p></div>
<div><div><p>“I think we used up too much of the Greek alphabet too quickly,” said William Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For those who use the Roman alphabet, the Greek alphabet consists of a few letters that are readily identifiable: A (alpha), B (beta) and K (kappa), for instance, all look and sound as they would in English, Spanish or French.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Greek alphabet also has letters that look familiar but sound different — P makes an R sound. Then there are letters that are unrecognizable, such as psi — shaped like a little pitchfork.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In one of her classes for intermediate students, a 21-year-old junior, Kincaid MacDonald, used the pandemic as inspiration for an end-of-the-semester creative writing assignment: “Greek Letters vs. WHO.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He described the letters as little characters, with arms and legs, who lived in the basement of an eccentric Greek professor. And they wanted to sue for defamation.</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Understanding omicron’s many mutations</h1><h2>The virus’s spikes have far more changes than we’ve seen in any previous variant, and researchers are racing to figure out how they affect it — and us</h2></div>

<div><div><p>The omicron variant of the coronavirus has about 50 genetic mutations, and a whopping 36 of them are in the all-important spike. That is the part that lets the virus attach to human cells and worm its way inside.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Those spikes play a critical role in the biggest unknowns about this new variant: How easily will omicron pass from person to person? How sick will it make us? And how well will our vaccines and immune systems protect us from it?</p></div>
<div><div><p>Scientists are just beginning to untangle omicron’s mysteries, but the locations of mutations in key parts of the spike provide some clues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A look at the spike</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Every spike on a coronavirus’s surface is made of three identical proteins twisted together, making it look a little like a head of broccoli with three stalks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Each stalk has three vital regions — the receptor binding domain (RBD), the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the furin cleavage site (FCS) — and most of omicron’s mutations are in these three areas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A key to transmissibility: the receptor binding domain</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Amino acids in this area attach to a cell’s receptor like a key in a lock, opening the cell so the virus can enter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There’s no question that this will be more transmissible than delta,” said Mark Zeller, a staff scientist at Scripps Research whose team sequences viruses.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Part of the problem is that in addition to being the location where the virus binds to cells, the domain is ground zero in our immune system’s attack on the virus.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Specialized fighting forces called neutralizing antibodies try to latch on here to block the spike from attaching to cell receptors. (Monoclonal antibody treatments are an example of neutralizing antibodies.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Those antibodies developed to attack the spikes of a previous version of the virus, which were largely similar to each other. Antibodies may find it more difficult to attach to the vastly different omicron spike.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Early studies suggest omicron is formidable — but not unstoppable</p></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Notable mutations in this area</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>If the receptor binding domain were a catcher’s mitt, 10 mutations are right in the pocket. Amino acids in this sweet spot interact most directly with the cell’s receptors.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>A key to immunity: the N-terminal domain</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Scientists are not sure exactly what this area’s function is, said Tulane microbiologist Robert F. Garry, an expert on the virus’s anatomy. It may help viruses attach to cells in some way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But it is clear that antibodies — both the kind triggered by vaccines and the kind triggered by previous infection — target this area.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In omicron, the N-terminal domain has been extensively overhauled, said Zeller. Four amino acids were swapped out, six total were deleted from three locations and three new ones were added together in one spot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Scientists suspect this extensive remodeling means antibodies will bind less efficiently, so they will be less effective at stopping the virus from infecting new cells.</p></div></div>
<a>first lab study of omicron</a> indicated that it may indeed evade quite a bit of antibody protection. Early data also shows that people who received boosters on top of full vaccination
<a>still remain largely protected</a> from the most severe effects of covid, although it will vary greatly from person to person.
<div><p>First lab results show omicron has ‘much more extensive escape’ from antibodies than previous variants</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A key to severe illness: the furin cleavage site</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Once inside a cell, the coronavirus causes an infection by turning the cell’s machinery into a tiny factory that churns out new copies of the virus.</p></div></div>
<p>As new viruses leave the factory, the human enzyme furin acts like a trigger, activating them by snipping their spikes as they head out the door. The place on the spike’s stalk where that snip occurs is called the furin cleavage site.</p>
<div><p>What happens after that snip is complicated and involves the loose ends helping to fuse cell membranes together. But the upshot is that the virus is able to slip more easily from one cell to the next without exposing itself to antibodies.</p></div>
<div><div><p>A cluster of mutations near the furin cleavage site may let omicron more easily slide into cells.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Garry said alpha beefed up its site over the original virus’s, and delta’s site is better than alpha’s. Many studies have pegged the mutation at position 681 as a reason delta spreads so efficiently.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Early data suggests omicron may cause milder illness than delta in most people — an enormous silver lining in the dark cloud of a more highly transmissible variant.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So far, he said, omicron appears to be at least two for three.</p></div></div>
