<div><p>This recipe is made with whole dried fava beans in their skins; don’t use split peeled favas for this, as they turn to (delicious) mush better suited to dips and soups. Seek out small Egyptian fava beans, not the large ones.</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Make Ahead</b>: The favas can be cooked and refrigerated for up to 1 week, then warmed in the microwave or over low heat on the stovetop before garnishing and serving.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Storage Notes</b>: Refrigerate for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Where to Buy</b>: Small dried fava beans in their shell can be found at Middle Eastern and some international markets or online.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Ingredients</div></h3></div></div>
<li><span><b>1 pound dried whole fava beans with skins, preferably mini, soaked overnight in plenty of water with 1 teaspoon baking soda</b></span></li>

<div><p>11 frozen meals our staff turns to in a pinch</p></div>
<b>Stock the pantry. </b>This is the corollary to my freezer advice. Make sure your cabinets are stocked with versatile ingredients that can be used in any number of ways depending on what you feel like cooking. Be sure to have a look at
<a>Kristen Hartke’s great roundup</a> she did for us a few years ago. At the top of my list would be
<a>canned tomatoes</a> (diced and crushed), dried pasta, dried and/or canned beans and grains (rice, barley, etc.). Extra points if you keep a running inventory somewhere. Be sure to catch up on the pantry-friendly recipes
<a>my colleague Aaron Hutcherson</a> shares about once a month.
<div><p>The tools and ingredients every adult should have in the kitchen</p></div>
<b>Let someone else do the planning. </b>You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. It’s more than okay to follow someone else’s lead. And, of course, we can help with that. In addition to all the entries in our almost
<a>Eat Voraciously newsletter</a> gives you a dinner plan with fast and flexible recipes Monday through Thursday, which you can follow each day or use to build your own week’s plan.

<div><div><p>Every new year, diet messages seem to rain down along with the confetti right after the ball drops.</p></div></div>
<div><p>From the blitz of ads to the guilt-laden chatter among friends, you can’t escape them. While most diets have been rebranded as “lifestyle” plans, scratch their veneer and you get the same strict rules and body shaming.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The problem is, that shift is often framed as repentance, with punishing food rules that are big on promises but are ultimately unsustainable, even damaging.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Instead, consider a different approach: Make targeted, smaller-but-pivotal changes to put yourself on a lifelong path to well-being.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>9 easy recipes for dinner in a bowl, our ideal couch meal</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Kari Sonde</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 10:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>In March, staff writer G. Daniela Galarza wrote about what she called “Lap Pasta” in her <a>Eat Voraciously newsletter</a>.</p></div></div>
<p>She described it this way: “'Lap Pasta’ is, like a small, sleepy dog or cat, what it sounds like: a warm bowl of pasta you eat while curled up on the couch or in a cozy chair, the bowl wrapped in a napkin and nestled in your lap."</p>
<div><div><p>She declared that there are only three rules for Lap Pasta:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>"1. </b>The pasta shape has to be easy to eat, requiring only a fork, spoon or chopsticks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>2.</b> The sauce needs to be thick enough that it clings to the noodles.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>3.</b> It must be really, really comforting and, ideally, easy to make, so you spend less time cooking and more time with the bowl of pasta in your lap."</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below we’ve pulled some of our favorite dinners-in-bowls for casual eating, watching TV, reading your books and generally relaxing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Bean and Barley Chili</b></a>, pictured above. Chili is, perhaps, the perfect bowl-meal: warming, eaten with just a spoon, topped with whatever you’d like.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Misir Wot</b></a>. You can make your own spice blend as depicted, or buy some to make this simple, spicy one-pot lentil dish. Serve with rice, eat in a bowl.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>One-Pot Pasta</b></a>. We, of course, had to include pasta. Make a one-pot version for even less clean up afterward.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Southern Collard and Sweet Potato Hash</b></a>. Yes, you can even have “lap breakfast.” Make this hearty hash and, if you’d like an egg on top, go right ahead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Better Than Takeout Fried Rice</b></a>. This simple dish is super adaptable! We suggest carrots, corn and peas here, but you could add in bell peppers, greens or something else more to your liking.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Chicken, Sausage and Shrimp Jambalaya</b></a>. This hearty, warm dish is just right for these cold months.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Kabocha Squash and Peanut Stew</b></a>. This is a fan-favorite recipe for a reason: It’s so delicious and though the ingredient list looks long, it comes together quickly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Tetrazzini</b></a>. One more lap pasta for good measure! This creamy one-pot wonder was one of Daniela’s childhood favorites.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a><b>Garlicky Broccoli and Beans With Pesto</b></a>. A quick cooking tip — using kettle-boiled water to blanch the broccoli — gets this dish to your mouth that much faster.</p></div></div>

<div><p>One country, endless dishes: A love letter to Indian cuisine</p></div>
<div><div><p>This sit-down meal was a school-day luxury. On those afternoons, my own untouched tiffin would return home on the back of the tiffinwala’s bicycle. Mom knew I had eaten lunch at Pramita’s home.</p></div></div>
<p>Her life had not afforded her the luxury of time or resources to watch a pot boil, which she found too fussy and involved to make. Slowly, her kitchen began to make sense — as did the recipes I had scribbled down while listening to her.</p>

<div><div><p><b>Storage Notes: </b>The sauce can be prepared up until the point of adding beans and refrigerated for up to 3 days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Where to Buy: </b>Indian bay leaf (tamal patra) can be found at Indian grocery stores and online.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Ingredients</div></h3></div></div>
<li><span><b>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 cup finely chopped red or white onion (about 6 ounces) (optional, see NOTES)</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 tablespoon finely grated or minced ginger</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 tablespoon finely grated or minced garlic</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 (2-inch) cinnamon stick</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>2 to 3 whole cloves</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>2 green cardamom pods</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 Indian bay leaf (see NOTES)</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>2 teaspoons cayenne pepper (may substitute with Kashmiri chile for milder heat)</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 cup finely diced or crushed fresh tomatoes or canned diced tomatoes (see NOTES)</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>3 cups cooked kidney beans (see related recipe); or use two 15-ounce cans, rinsed and drained (see NOTES)</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 cup water, plus more as needed</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1/4 teaspoon dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi powder, see NOTES)</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1 teaspoon granulated sugar or honey (optional)</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>Fine sea salt or table salt</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>1/4 cup fresh heavy cream to garnish, optional</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>Cooked basmati rice or brown rice, or naan (</b><a><b>see related recipe</b></a><b>)</b></span></li>
<li><span><b>Raita, for serving, optional (</b><a><b>see related recipe</b></a><b>)</b></span></li>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 1</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a deep, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until shimmering.</p></div></div>
<div><p>If using the onions, sprinkle the cayenne on top and mix to evenly coat. (If not using the onions, remove the skillet from the heat and let it cool down for about 1 minute before adding the cayenne, as it burns instantly in very hot oil.)</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 2</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Add the tomatoes, stirring to evenly combine with the spices. Cook, stirring, until the liquid starts to evaporate, about 2 minutes. (See NOTES for a smoother sauce.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 3</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Add the beans and stir gently so they don’t break. Add the water, cover, and reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, to prevent beans from sticking to the bottom of the pan, until slightly thickened, about 20 minutes.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 4</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the sauce begins to thicken, add the fenugreek leaves. Stir in the sugar and season to taste with salt. Re-cover and continue to cook until the sauce thickens further and the flavors meld, an additional 10 minutes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 5</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Step 6</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>When ready to serve, remove the cinnamon stick and bay leaf and discard them. Swirl the cream on top, remove from the heat and serve hot, family-style, as a side or main dish, with rice, naan and raita on the side, if desired.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>NOTES</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>If not using onions, use an additional 1 cup chopped tomatoes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The dish is best when using homemade beans. See related recipe for <a>Simply Perfect Pot of Beans</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Indian bay leaf, also known as tamal patra, has a different flavor from standard bay leaf, and results in a more complex flavor.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fresh fenugreek leaves and the dried seeds are different in flavor from dried fenugreek leaves. Do not substitute.</p></div></div>

<header><div><h1>Women allege racism, sexism at food media company Feedfeed</h1></div></header>

<a>Homemade vs. the Internet</a>.”
<div><div><p>Gurjar, then 30, was hired at an annual salary of $50,400. Tane, then 24, received $72,000.</p></div></div>
<a>Forbes’ 30 Under 30 list</a>.) Cohen, like the Resnicks, is named as a defendant in the lawsuit.
<div><div><p>Gurjar and Henry-Bohoskey said they had hoped Cohen, despite his youth, would become a mentor. But, according to the lawsuit, Cohen “became an immediate and active participant in the abuse,” an allegation he denies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cohen, the plaintiffs allege in their suit, at one point discouraged Gurjar from having a child, implying work comes first. (Cohen denied he said this; he said he was talking about how he didn’t want to have children.)</p></div></div>
<b> </b>alleged in interviews. But when they complained they were overwhelmed, they would find little relief. Worse, they said, Cohen or the Resnicks would accuse them of not being team players or “tone police” their attitudes.
<div><div><p>Cohen, the women allege in the suit, would also brush off their complaints about Giora Stuchiner, Feedfeed’s art and experiential director until 2020, an allegation Cohen denies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Several current Feedfeed employees told The Post that Stuchiner never used the word “gangbang” or directed it at the account manager.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>already had a strained relationship with Stuchiner because he had described Bushwick, where Feedfeed has an office and where Henry-Bohoskey used to live, as “sketchy” in the comments to an
<a>Instagram video</a>. At the time, Henry-Bohoskey alleged, she told Stuchiner the remark came off as racist given the many families of color in the area.
<p>“I felt like I was on the spot and I couldn’t <i>not</i> answer him,” Henry-Bohoskey said. She said she gave him a brief history on newly freed Blacks, their relationship with watermelon and how Whites stigmatized the fruit.</p>
<div><div><p>“I regret it to this day,” Henry-Bohoskey said about answering the question.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They have never relinquished their control over the mundane,” said Molly Adams, former digital food director, who quit in September.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Berger said the company disagreed with the overtime claims, but “to the extent there was any inadvertent underpayment during their employment, we wanted to make sure they were compensated.”</p></div></div>
<p>Former employees said in interviews that the Resnicks’ leadership could be mercurial, that editorial procedures and duties could change without warning, leaving employees feeling as if the ground was constantly shifting under their feet.</p>
<div><div><p>“A lot of times [Julie’s] ask would be like, ‘Can you just pull something out of thin air with all the free time that you have?,’” said Tane, who was laid off early in the pandemic.</p></div></div>
<p>But shifting on the fly is the nature of the digital media industry, Berger said. “Feedfeed employees have always been encouraged to speak with their supervisors and/or the Resnicks if they have concerns about their workload,” he added.</p>
<div><div><p>In testimonials provided by the company, some current employees praise the founders.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>“The Resnicks hire people they believe in and who have the creativity and knowledge to move the company forward.”
<div><div><p>“We understand if you want to move on and find a new job as an art director at a different organization,” Julie wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Having the minimum experience on paper doesn’t make one qualified for a job,” Berger responded.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Gurjar and Henry-Bohoskey allege in their complaint that discrimination played a role in their slow advancement, while they watched White employees rise faster and higher. But Berger disputed that.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>told The Post. But driven by the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020
<b> </b>following George Floyd’s murder, she began reading more about systemic racism, decolonization and social justice. She started standing up for herself and for racial diversity at Feedfeed.
<div><div><p>“The world wants food media companies to rightfully hire more diverse staff. We have that diversity,” Dan wrote. “So why would we not be leveraging it.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“It would just be so ridiculous, like asking her to source things in a pandemic that are like, ‘Do you have edible flowers? Can you find gold dust?’ Just crazy stuff,” Dolfi told The Post.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I was crying all the time. I was not able to eat. I was not functioning very well,” Gurjar said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Dec. 23, she quit. Two months later, she started as an associate food editor at Bon Appétit, which<a> had gone through a racial reckoning in 2020</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>About a month later, on Jan. 29, as Henry-Bohoskey was training the person she thought was her replacement, she also resigned, even though<b> </b>she was pregnant and would sacrifice state-mandated maternity leave.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was worth it,” she said. “I was just so miserable.”</p></div></div>
