<a>Olympics</a> over concerns exposure to COVID while competing could put their season in further jeopardy, David Quinn and John Vanbiesbrouck have been named head coach and general manager for Team USA, respectively.
<a>NHL</a> guys were going to go, but to be named the head coach for the 2022 Olympic team is an incredible honor."
<p>Quinn said he and Vanbiesbrouck have spoken every day since the NHL announced its decision and have been discussing how they would handle the situation if they were chosen to lead the new team.</p>
<p>"John and I kind of changed gears in a hurry once this became official and started focusing on the current player pool that we're going to be able to draw from," Quinn said.</p>
<p>Quinn, 55, was the sole member of the previously announced coaching staff that was not currently with an NHL team.</p>
<p>He was set to be an assistant for this team's staff, after being part of the staff for the 2007, 2012 and 2016 world championships.</p>
<p>Quinn coached the New York Rangers the past three seasons after five years at Boston University.</p>
<p>"All those opportunities for me have prepared me for this," Quinn said.</p>
<a>Minnesota Wild GM Bill Guerin</a> replaced Stan Bowman, who resigned after an
<a>investigation found he had a prominent role</a> in the Chicago Blackhawks mishandling sexual assault allegations in 2010. Guerin stepped aside when the NHL pulled out.
<p>"This turn of events, we have to get to work and we have to get to work quickly selecting our team," Vanbiesbrouck said.</p>
<a>resigned as GM and coach of a junior hockey team in 2003</a> after using a racial slur to describe defenseman Trevor Daley, who is Black.
<p>Vanbiesbrouck said, "From the goal on out, we're going to be strong" and mentioned there are roster candidates who played college hockey last year and now professionals.</p>

<h3>Home prices surge 18 percent as more people look to relocate amid COVID</h3>
<p>Home prices continue to climb across the U.S. amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The SP CoreLogic Case-Shiller 20-city home price index shows prices increased 18.4 percent in October 2021, compared to the year prior.</p>
<p>The latest figures released Tuesday list Phoenix, Tampa and Miami as the hottest markets, up about 32 percent, 28 percent and 25.7 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Las Vegas, Dallas and San Diego round out the top six, up 25.5 percent, 24.6 percent and 24.2 percent respectively.</p>
<h3>California reports 5 million COVID cases</h3>
<p>California became the first state to report more than 5 million known COVID-19 cases, according to the California Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>This milestone comes after data collected over the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>California averaged 25.3 new cases per 100,000 people and the positivity rate is up to 9.7 percent, according to state data released Tuesday, and COVID-related hospitalizations were up to 4,747.</p>
<p>The first case in the state was confirmed Jan. 25, 2020, and California reached 1 million infections on Nov. 11, 2020.</p>
<h3>Flights across the world cancel due to rapid COVID spread</h3>
<p>As COVID surges across the world, thousands of flights have been delayed or canceled.</p>
<p>According to tracking website FlightAware, 2,800 flights have been canceled Tuesday and more than 8,000 flights have been delayed.</p>
<p>Travelers trying to rebook for future flights are encouraged to book the earliest flights on any given day.</p>
<h3>Universities issue new COVID measures</h3>
<p>Universities are continuing to issue new protocols amid a surge in COVID-19 cases across the country.</p>
<p>Emory University will go virtual to start the spring semester. President Gregory Fenves said the school plans to transition back to in-person learning on Jan. 31, "should conditions permit."</p>
<p>While resident halls will be open, students are encouraged to delay their return to campus.</p>
<p>"I understand that beginning the semester with remote learning and teaching is inconvenient," Fenves said in a email. "But we must be adaptable during this surge so we can continue our important work...in the face of this ever-evolving pandemic."</p>
<p>Oregon State University is the latest school to require students, staff and faculty get a COVID booster shot.</p>
<p>"In the days ahead, we will provide you more information about this booster requirement, including means and dates of when compliance will be required as you become eligible for a booster," Oregon State University officials said in an email.</p>
<p>In-person instruction and other campus activities are set to resume Jan. 3. Students will also be tested before returning to university-managed residence halls.</p>
<h3>Multiple Texas centers run out of treatment effective against new COVID variant</h3>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in an statement posted online that "supply of the drug is extremely limited, and additional doses of the product will not be available until the week of January 3rd."</p>
<p>The agency also stated that antibody drugs for coronavirus variants other than Omicron are still available.</p>
<h3>U.S. issues new COVID travel advisories</h3>
<p>The United States issued new travel advisories Tuesday due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>There are "Level 4: Do Not Travel" advisories for Sweden, Malta, French Polynesia, Suriname and New Caledonia.</p>
<p>COVID levels in these countries are "very high," according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>The U.S. advises people to avoid going to these areas and be fully vaccinated if they must travel.</p>
<p>Guatemala, Argentina and Gabon are under "Level 3: Reconsider Travel" advisories.</p>
<p>Level 3 countries have a "high" level of COVID. The CDC advises people are fully vaccinated before traveling to these countries.</p>
<h3>College football bowl games canceled amid COVID increase</h3>
<p>Four college football bowl games have been canceled so far due to COVID-19 protocols. Boise State is the latest team to be affected.</p>
<p>The school announced Monday they have stopped all football team activities due to COVID-19 protocols. The announcement means the Broncos will not compete against the Central Michigan Chippewas in the Arizona Bowl scheduled for Friday.</p>
<p>The decision was made in coordination with campus and public health officials along with Boise State's medical staff.</p>
<h3>Biden revokes travel ban on southern African countries</h3>
<p>President Joe Biden has lifted travel restrictions for 8 countries in southern Africa. The restrictions were issued in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 omicron variant that originated in South Africa.</p>
<p>"In light of these changed circumstances, and based on the recommendation of the CDC, I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to revoke Proclamation 10315," Biden said.</p>
<p>In November, Biden issues the proclamation to suspend travel into the United States for non-citizens who had traveled to eight southern African countries, including Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana.</p>
<p>However, the variant has spread to more than 100 countries and is "prevalent" in the U.S. since the proclamation was issued.</p>
<p>Biden said health officials "have made substantial progress in understanding the Omicron variant" and the administration has implemented "stringent" international travel protocols.</p>
<p>Those guidelines include requiring international travelers to show a negative COVID test within one day of departure to the U.S., regardless of vaccination status.</p>
<p>"The travel restrictions imposed by that proclamation are no longer necessary to protect the public health," Biden said.</p>
<h3>Germany tightens restrictions, bans New Year's Eve fireworks</h3>
<p>New restrictions began Tuesday across Germany to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. Chancellor Olaf Scholz detailed the new mandates on gatherings ahead of New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>For vaccinated individuals, private gatherings are limited to 10 people. For unvaccinated individuals, private gatherings are limited to the household plus two other people.</p>
<p>Fireworks to celebrate the New Year will also be banned.</p>
<p>"We have to stand together and still keep our distance so that our country can get through well in the near future," Chancellor Scholz tweeted.</p>
<p>Clubs will be closed until further notice, and major national events, including soccer, will have no fans.</p>
<p>Monday night, thousands protested the new mandates across the country. <a>Some demonstrations turned violent</a>, resulting in arrests and officers injured.</p>
<h3>First vaccine recipient in U.S. still encourages other to get their shot</h3>
<p>The first person to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the U.S. is still advocating for Americans to get their shot.</p>
<p>New York nurse Sandra Lindsay just "happened to go first" when officials at Northwell Health's Long Island Jewish Medical Center asked for volunteers to get the vaccine on Dec. 14, 2020.</p>
<p>Lindsay witnessed the impact of the coronavirus firsthand as the director of critical care nursing at the Queens hospital.</p>
<p>"I just felt broken, defeated; just tired and burned out,'' Lindsay said. "Witnessing the overwhelming loss of lives, loss of livelihoods.''</p>
<p>More than a year later, she is still campaigning others to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"I encourage people to speak to experts who can answer their questions, to access trusted science," Lindsay said. "I let them know that it's OK to ask questions."</p>

<h3>COVID has halted many college basketball games</h3>
<p>According to the Associated Press, this college basketball season is being hit hard by the pandemic.</p>
<p>With COVID-19 cases increasing, many games are being canceled and postponed. Reports indicate that dozens of teams have paused their basketball seasons due to the virus.</p>
<p>Some teams have been able to find quick replacements, like No. 6 Kansas, which played Nevada Wednesday night after Harvard canceled due to newly enforced COVID-19 protocols.</p>
<p>Other teams have not been able to find replacements when opponents have canceled, forcing them to extend their Christmas breaks.</p>
<h3>Omicron accounts for about 59% of new COVID cases</h3>
<p>The Omicron COVID-19 variant accounted for nearly 59 percent of new cases in the U.S. last week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>Tuesday's figure is lower than the CDC previously estimated last week.</p>
<p>The CDC revised its estimate of Omicron cases from 73 percent down to 22.5 percent for the week ending Dec. 18.</p>
<p>For the week ending Dec. 25, CDC data shows the amount of Omicron cases increased to account for 58.6 percent of new COVID cases.</p>
<h3>Flight attendant union gives a statement after the CDC updated isolation rules</h3>
<p>The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA International President Sara Nelson released a statement expressing her disapproval of the CDC's new updated isolation rule.</p>
<h3>Expanded testing to keep NYC students in class</h3>
<p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio detailed a back-to-school plan for NYC schools Tuesday. The goal of "Stay Safe, Stay Open," is to keep students learning in classrooms safely as NYC battles the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>There will be a "wide distribution" of at-home test kits for every classroom, de Blasio said.</p>
<p>If a student tests positive, every student in that classroom will take home a COVID-19 test. All students will return to school the next day if they are asymptomatic and test negative.</p>
<p>"This guarantees more consistency in their education," de Blasio said.</p>
<p>New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi echoed the importance of keeping students physically present in class.</p>
<p>"Schools remain among the safest settings in our communities," Dr. Chokski tweeted.</p>
<p>"For any case identified in an NYC public school between October to December, only 1 in 120 close contacts developed COVID-19."</p>
<p>NYC schools are set to reopen on Jan. 3.</p>
<h3>Cases, hospitalizations increase across U.S.</h3>
<p>COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have surged in recent days across the U.S.</p>
<p>New York state reported more than 5,500 COVID hospitalizations for the first time since February, Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday. With 5,526 people hospitalized with COVID, this figure is a near 190 percent increase since Nov. 1.</p>
<p>There is also a steep increase in pediatric hospitalizations. Admissions for kids with COVID are at 184 statewide, up from 70 two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The <a>COVID positivity rate in Louisiana hit 20 percent as hospitalizations doubled in one week</a>, according to the state Department of Health.</p>
<p><a>Alabama is seeing a similar COVID positivity rate</a>, as 18.2 percent of tests taken in the state over the past week came back positive, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health.</p>
<p><a>COVID cases surged over the holiday weekend in Florida</a>, as the state reported 39,000 cases Monday.</p>
<p>Hospitalizations are increasing, but at a slower rate. Just under 5,000 likely COVID patients were admitted to hospitals last week, compared to just over 3,000 the week before, Florida Today reported.</p>
<p>Two players on the U.S. team will likely have to pull out of the world junior hockey championships, in accordance with Canada's federal quarantine rules, after testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>This year, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) tournament is being played at Rogers Place in Edmonton, Alberta and WP Centrium in Red Deer, Alberta. The preliminary round kicked off on Sunday.</p>
<p>Because the tournament will only go until January 5—eight days after Tuesday's positive tests—the two American players who have tested positive will be unable to play in any of the tournament's games.</p>
<p>The entire team was also forced to forfeit their Tuesday afternoon game against Switzerland. The game will be recorded as a 1-0 win for the Swiss, per IIHF's rules for the event.</p>
<p>"We're extremely disappointed, especially for our players," U.S. general manager John Vanbiesbrouck said in a statement. "We're operating in an ever-changing landscape and that's very challenging."</p>
<p>"We've followed the tournament protocol from the outset and will continue to do everything we can to ensure our players have the opportunity to compete at the World Junior Championship," he added.</p>
<p>There is also concern that the U.S. team—the defending gold medalists—will be unable to play in Wednesday's scheduled game against Sweden.</p>
<p>"The team's quarantine status will be evaluated later to determine whether it will be able to compete in its next preliminary round game," IIHF said in a Tuesday statement.</p>
<p>The next scheduled game would be against Russia on Friday.</p>
<p>On the first day of the tournament, the Americans played Slovakia, winning 3-2.</p>
<p>The U.S. won gold at last year's championships in Edmonton, Canada after failing to medal in 2020. The U.S. has won gold five times in the history of the world juniors but has never won back-to-back titles.</p>
<p>The hockey world has taken extra precautions amid the surge in COVID-19 cases and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Last week, the National Hockey League (<a>NHL</a>) paused its season early ahead of the Christmas break in an effort to weather several COVID outbreaks.</p>
<p>The 10 teams playing in the 2022 IIHF World Junior Championship entered a COVID bubble back on December 15 in preparation for the tournament.</p>
<p>New provincial restrictions in Alberta have also put a new capacity limit for the tournament. Large venues that seat more than 1,000 people, including sports arenas, will be capped at half capacity.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to IIHF for further comment.</p>
<div> Sports Ncaa <a>Football</a></div>
<p>As cases of the COVID-19 Omicron variant continue to sweep across the sporting world, a number of college football bowl games have seen their matchups removed from the schedule as a precaution.</p>
<p>This marks the continuation of a slate of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) events that have been crushed by the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>The decision to cancel the game was finalized after Boise State pulled out of the matchup, citing COVID issues within its locker room, according to a statement from sponsor Barstool.</p>
<p>The NCAA was reportedly looking for a replacement for Boise State in the hours leading up to the cancellation, but it was not to be.</p>
<p>The Arizona Bowl became the fourth bowl game to be officially canceled. As of Monday evening, the called-off games are as follows:</p>
<li>Wasabi Fenway Bowl- Virginia versus Southern Methodist</li>
<li>Easypost Hawaii Bowl - Hawaii versus Memphis</li>
<li>Military Bowl - East Carolina versus Boston College</li>
<li>Barstool Sports Arizona Bowl - Boise State versus Central Michigan</li>
<p>Similar to Boise State, the other cancellations followed suspected outbreaks at Virginia, Hawaii and Boston College.</p>
<p>While Memphis, Southern Methodist and East Carolina were unaffected by COVID, they will not be looking for replacements for their opponents, according to Action Network reporter Brett McMurphy.</p>
<p>Beyond these canceled games, a number of other bowls were impacted by teams dealing with rampaging COVID problems.</p>
<p>Texas AM was also forced to withdraw from the Gator Bowl on Sunday after similar problems dealing with COVID in its locker room. However, its opponent, Wake Forest, was able to find another matchup, and will now face Rutgers in the game.</p>
<p>The cancellation of these games, many of which represent college football's biggest stage, comes as the NCAA continues to deal with rampant Omicron cases spreading throughout a multitude of sports.</p>
<p>"There are real conversations about going back into isolation and back into [regular] COVID testing from last year," Jeremy Cauwels, a member of the NCAA health advisory panel, told Sports Illustrated. </p>
<p>Newsweek has reached out to the NCAA for comment.</p>
