<h1> Autumn Is a Powerful Reminder to Live While We Are Alive </h1>
<h2> Walt Whitman, and an HIV diagnosis, showed me how to think about aging and time. </h2>
<p> Posted September 19, 2018 </p>
<p>The autumn equinox arrives this weekend, and fall begins.</p>
<p>Some people dislike the fall because it reminds them that winter isn’t far behind. They spend their middle age years in terror of old age. I know people younger than I who describe themselves as “old.”</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Grapes hang ready for the harvest at Sonoma's Ravenswood Winery.</div> <div>Source: John-Manuel Andriote/photo</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Aging is a fact of life. “Old” is a state of mind, and it’s a choice.</p>
<a>self-talk</a> to use words and language that diminish, rather than build me up. We don't suddenly become a different person at 40, 50, 60, 70, or beyond; we simply become more of who we already are. We ripen, like Whitman's "finish'd" apple.
<p>I’ve always marked my “milestone” birthdays with some kind of celebration. A party for my 30th. A sit-down dinner at the National Press Club for my 40th. A solo road trip to Montreal for 45. Another party for my 50th.</p>
<p>I plan to celebrate 60, too.</p>
<p>Why celebrate? Why not quietly accept that I am now young only in comparison to people who have already retired?</p>
<a>grateful</a> to be alive, for starters. I am grateful that effective
<a>medication</a> allows me to live well with HIV, 13 years since my diagnosis. I am grateful that I have had the
<a>motivation</a> I needed to advocate for myself when “the system” could have left me in a dangerous position without insurance and unable to pay for the lifesaving medication I must take to avoid developing life-threatening illness.
<a>loneliness</a> that too frequently accompanies it.
<p>So I choose to celebrate the autumn of life, the time of harvest.</p>
<p>Since returning in 2007 to eastern Connecticut, where I grew up, I have rediscovered in my regular forest hikes around the largely rural area why I’ve always loved fall.</p>
<p>I marvel at Nature’s annual fireworks display in the flamboyantly colored trees and grasses.</p>
<p>My heart pounds with excitement at the deafening din of honking southbound geese soaring overhead in their V-formation across the field whose changing complexion I’ve observed since the new leaves appeared in the spring.</p>

<a>Cleve Jones</a>, who marched with
<a>Harvey Milk</a> and created the
<a>AIDS Memorial Quilt</a>, said simply, “I think what we did mattered and I think we did the right thing. Even with all the mistakes, stupidity, and suffering, I’m still proud of it.”
<a>National Minority AIDS Council </a>director Paul Kawata said, “I think the infrastructure that we built as gay men while we lost what we lost was extraordinary, heroic, unfathomable—and our legacy.”
<p>Our LGBTQ community's memories and hope have sustained us through the dark times of fully legal anti-gay <a>discrimination</a> and a deadly health crisis. Each of us can be Stonewall strong by claiming that heritage for ourselves.</p>
<p>In actual fact that heritage belongs not only to the LGBTQ community, but to anyone who can benefit from keeping alive memories and hope that sustain them. Which is to say, all of us.</p>

<h1> Claiming Our Own 'Resistance' for LGBT History Month </h1>
<h2> There's power in reminding ourselves of what we've already survived. </h2>
<p> Posted September 30, 2017 </p>
<p>Mart Crowley’s play The Boys in the Band opened at New York’s off-Broadway Theater Four on April 14, 1968. The revolutionary show dared to show gay men “at home.”</p>
<a>self-loathing</a> fuel the free-flying insults as the men verbally flay each other and themselves.
<p>What may be saddest of all is the friends gathered in Michael’s apartment actually do care about, and even love, one another like the “gay family” they are.</p>
<p>But after lifetimes of being told men who love men are sick, sinful, and second class, it’s small wonder the pain they carry inside boils over regularly with the only people with whom they feel safe enough to vent. </p>
<p>That line hurts even today because it still rings true for too many gay men. The hatred of gay people we grow up hearing and seeing, frequently from our own parents, still sinks in and undercuts our <a>self-esteem</a>.</p>
<a>homosexuality</a> was considered a mental illness, this perceptiveness was dismissed as further proof of aberration. “
<a>Sexual</a> perverts readily recognized each other, although they may never have met before,” wrote one doctor in 1892, “and there exists a mysterious bond of psychological sympathy between them.”
<p>Of course gay men viewed that mysterious bond quite differently. </p>
<a>humor</a> to highlight the artifice of social convention.” It was also an important component of gay men’s
<a>gender</a> roles on their heads, more cleverly than drag. Gender inversion was central to gay culture, the reason Chauncey says the drag balls and their organizers occupied an honored place in it.
<p>Not all homosexuals liked the term, but it provided a way for them to identify themselves to one another without alerting those not in the know. </p>
<a>Stonewall Strong</a>, John Clum, a Duke University professor emeritus of theater studies and English, was well-positioned in time to reflect on gay culture from the age of divas to the era of legal same-sex
<a>marriage</a>. In his 2000 book
<p>“Garland was a wreck, but she went on,” said Clum. </p>
<p>That is what gay men saw on stage and on the screen: resilience. The grit to go on in spite of everything that wants to hold us back. </p>
<p>For the divas of screen and stage, the struggle was to be independent women in a world dominated by men. Even today gay men frequently struggle to be true to ourselves in a world dominated by heterosexual men. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: John-Manuel Andriote/photo</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>“We were like the divas,” said Clum. “We go on and on, but underneath we’re hurting.” He added, “Divas are survivors. We loved them because they were survivors.”</p>

<h1> How Resilient People Get Through Anticipatory Grief </h1>
<h2> Practical steps to hold you together during a loved one's health crisis. </h2>
<p> Posted August 13, 2019 </p>
<p>Summer isn’t when we’re inclined to think about death. The lush greenness, life bursting at the seams, doesn’t lend itself to feelings of loss and sorrow.</p>
<div>I took this photo at Bluff Point State Park in Groton, Connecticut. I have been hiking here since I was a boy, and it is a place I go to help me cope with anticipatory grief and other challenges.</div>
<div>Source: John-Manuel Andriote/photo</div>
<a>grief</a>, a normal part of mourning when someone is expecting a death. I am
<a>grateful</a> and relieved this isn’t an imminent reality for Mom, though I’ve been reminded that even cats’ proverbial nine lives eventually run out. My friend, on the other hand, seems to be at the bottom of his ninth.
<a>Anticipatory grief</a> is a lot like the grief one experiences after a death. The thoughts and feelings it arouses include
<a>anger</a>, forgetfulness, isolation, and sadness. It's not only grief for our loved one's impending death, but the accumulation of losses leading up to it--including perhaps their loss of abilities and independence, loss of stability or lost future
<a>dreams</a>, or any of so many other losses.
<p>The <a>Visiting Nurses Service of New York suggests five steps </a>for dealing with anticipatory grief:</p>
<li>Allow feelings of grief to help you prepare. Examine unresolved issues, make your peace if necessary, settle legal and financial matters, and discuss end-of-life wishes.</li>
<li>Educate yourself about what to expect. Learn about your loved one’s condition, its symptoms, treatment side effects, and the prognosis.</li>
<li>Connect with others who can provide insight and support.</li>
<li>Enlist help and continue to live your life. Don’t put your own life on hold.</li>
<li>Create moments your loved one can enjoy. These may become your most cherished memories.</li>
<li>Accept that anticipatory grief is normal.</li>
<li>Acknowledge, and honor, your losses. Allow yourself to acknowledge you are grieving even though the person hasn’t died.</li>
<li>Remember that anticipatory grief doesn’t mean you are giving up. It can help you shift your energy from hoping your loved one recovers to focusing on being supportive, caring, and loving.</li>
<li>Communicate. Grief is different for everyone, and so is anticipatory grief. Keep the communication channels open with family and friends so everyone can better understand one another.</li>
<li>Take care of yourself. This may mean <a>meditation</a>, or running, or spending time with a book. Whatever ways you like to care for yourself are the best ways for you.</li>
<p>The <a>Alzheimer’s Association of Northern California and Northern Nevada offers </a>these steps for caregivers—or anyone, really—facing a loved one’s deteriorating health:</p>
<li>Manage your <a>stress</a>.</li>
<li>Give yourself credit, not <a>guilt</a>.</li>
<li>Accept that there will be changes in your loved one’s health status.</li>
<li>Know you aren’t alone.</li>
<a>wisdom</a> to know the difference.”)

<h1> 7 Ways Hiking Benefits Your Body, Mind and Spirit </h1>
<h2> Get out into nature for great physical exercise and a refreshing mental massage. </h2>
<p>I didn’t know when I returned in 2007 to eastern Connecticut, where I grew up, that I would discover a hiker's paradise. </p>
<p>I also didn’t know how important hiking would become to me. Not only is it an excellent (and free) workout for my body, but it’s an equally vigorous workout for my mind and emotions.</p>
<a>AllTrails</a> app on my smartphone.
<p>I’ve scaled cliffs and leapt across streams, crunched leaves and even howled back at coyotes off in the distance. And I’ve felt alive and vital and renewed.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Without clear markers, and covered in leaves, I had to pay attention to flattened leaves to follow the trail.</div> <div>Source: John-Manuel Andriote/photos</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>I distilled what, in my view, are hiking’s benefits down to seven:</p>
<li>Supports health: Hiking is a great way to exercise your heart, lungs, and legs. You can build up endurance by hiking up inclines and rocks. You'll use leg muscles you didn't know you have.</li>
<a>education</a> in how complex and difficult it actually is to maintain balance as I watched my late mom in physical
<a>therapy</a>. Hiking on uneven surfaces, like trails, requires muscles in the legs, hips, abdomen, and back (to say nothing of your feet) to keep you striding along and not stumbling.
<p>A few times it seemed the trail could have gone in any of several directions. Without clear markers, I had to pay <a>attention</a> to flattened leaves that indicated where others had gone before, marking the right way to follow.</p>

<h1> Don't Just Light a Candle, Be One </h1>
<h2> Notes on being a source of light in a dark world. </h2>
<li>Light persists, although there is tremendous emotional darkness in the world.</li>
<li>People can be sources of light for others.</li>
<li>People who offer light stand out, shine steadily, illuminate others' lives, and draw others to them.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>When all the news seems bad, it's hard to find the good. But it's there. Look for the light.</div> <div>Source: John-ManuelAndriote/photo</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But I want to take it a step further. It is better to be the light than to curse the darkness.</p>
<h3>What Does It Mean To “Be the Light”?</h3>
<p>Light possesses highly desirable qualities of a healthy, mature, “evolved” person. Consider how light:</p>
<ul><li>Stands out in contrast to darkness.</li> <li>Shines steadily, regardless of what is going on around it.</li> <li>Illuminates our surroundings so we can move about without stumbling.</li> <li>Draws other creatures to it.</li> </ul>
<p>Someone others perceive, and are drawn to, as a source of light stands in contrast to most people because they are:</p>
<li>Different in that, while they are aware of the darkness, they don’t let it prevent them from seeing all that is good and beautiful in life and the world. They act in ways to contribute to making life and the world better for others.</li>
<li>Steady and confident that after being knocked down they will be able to get back up because they are aware that they have successfully gotten back up so many times before.</li>
<li>Luminous, emitting calmness, insight, and wisdom from an inward source that gives them the ability to remain hopeful and <a>optimistic</a> even in the face of challenges and difficulties.</li>
<li>Attractive to others because they can see their own lives more clearly by being near this person.</li>
<a>anger</a>, fear, and defeat. Instead, I chose to draw from the light within me that has been the source of my
<a>resilience</a> and love of life despite my life’s challenges, losses, and sorrows.
<p>It’s that light I try to draw from in this blog and that I hope will help illuminate and keep brightly burning the light within yourself. As I am writing this joyful time of year, I wish you and all you love the glorious light of Christmas.</p>

<h1> Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder and the Brain </h1>
<h2> What we know (and don't know) about the neurological underpinnings of ARFID. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Are Eating Disorders? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from an eating disorder</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Up to 23% of people in eating disorder treatment programs display symptoms of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID).</li>
<li>Those with ARFID don't have weight and body image concerns. Instead, they avoid/restrict food due to discomfort during or after eating.</li>
<li>Many factors contribute to the development and progression of ARFID, including weight, gender, and psychological/social components.</li>
<p>When you hear the words “<a>eating disorder</a>," what comes to mind? Anorexia Nervosa (AN)?</p>
<sup>14</sup> Moreover, media depictions of AN play into
<a>gender</a> stereotypes of young women striving for thinness.
<p>But are you familiar with Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID), a different, but equally perplexing eating disorder? </p>
<p>Up to 23% of individuals in eating disorders treatment programs display ARFID symptoms,<sup>1</sup> and its prevalence is rising.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>ARFID shares core features with AN, including malnourishment and food restriction.<sup>2</sup> And, while most cases occur in children and adolescents, ARFID can develop across the lifespan.</p>
<p>Where AN and ARFID differ is that ARFID develops without weight and <a>body image</a> concerns. For example, one individual diagnosed with ARFID maintained a rigid diet of pizza, plain pasta, fries, and chicken nuggets.<sup>10</sup></p>
<p>You might then be wondering what causes food restriction/avoidance in ARFID.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>When eating becomes unpleasant.</div> <div>Source: Mikhail Nilov/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>ARFID manifests in response to discomfort during and/or following eating. Specifically, food restriction/avoidance is classified into three types:<sup>3</sup></p>
<ol><li>Sensory sensitivity (i.e., food texture)</li> <li>Lack of interest in food and/or eating (i.e., homeostatic abnormalities)</li> <li><a>Fear</a> of aversive food consequences (i.e., gastrointestinal problems)<sup>12</sup></li> </ol>
<h3>Dimensional Perspectives</h3>
<p>Variations within ARFID subtypes have made research challenging.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best approach we have (so far) for researching ARFID is Thomas et al.’s (2017) Three-Dimensional Model.<sup>3</sup> This model permits the co-occurrence of food avoidance subtypes with varying severity.</p>
<p>For example, an individual might show minor disinterest in eating, but major aversions to chewy foods. This dimensional perspective helps clinicians determine causes and treatments for ARFID.</p>
<h3>Body Weight Variations</h3>
<p>Moreover, because people of all body weights develop ARFID, researchers have considered weight to be an influencing factor for how it progresses.<sup>6</sup></p>
<a>emotion regulation</a>, and body signals, particularly the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC; a region involved in emotion, reward, and
<p>Additionally, children with increased OFC activity prior to a meal reported feeling less satiated following the meal.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, while these findings could help explain variations in ARFID development because participants had additional diagnoses (i.e., <a>autism</a>) and pharmaceutical use (i.e., <a>antidepressants</a>) conclusions should be cautionary.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of ARFID is that it predominately occurs in males.<sup>11</sup></p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>ARFID occurs more often in males than in females, but reasons for this are unknown.</div> <div>Source: cottonbro/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>sex</a> differences associated with ARFID. Here, researchers found no sex differences for brain activation patterns in the OFC and the hypothalamus (an area regulating hunger) after viewing high-calorie food images.
<sup>7</sup> Moreover, men and women showed no significant differences in
<a>hormones</a> ghrelin (hunger) and peptide YY (satiety).
<p>Additional research is needed.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Context: Case Study 1</h3>
<p>Beyond <a>neuroscience</a>, individual case studies can help explain how personal experiences influence illness development. This is vital for a heterogenous disorder like ARFID.</p>
<p>Consider the case of a 27-year-old woman co-diagnosed with ARFID, Gitelman Syndrome (a rare genetic disorder impairing kidney salt absorption), <a>psychosis</a>, and <a>anxiety</a>.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p>Throughout her treatment, her psychosis and food restriction persisted, despite fMRI and CT brain scans showing no neurological abnormalities, and her <a>nutrition</a> and electrolyte imbalances being restored.</p>
<p>Consequently, doctors reflected on her personal experiences for clarification. In <a>childhood</a>, the woman showed minor food restriction and anxiety, which were minimized by her participation in and self-identification with athletics. </p>
<a>athletic</a> participation that her symptoms escalated and her psychosis developed. This suggests that, while ARFID does have underlying biological susceptibilities, psychological/social components contribute to its development, as well.
<h3>The Importance of Context: Case Study 2</h3>
<sup>9</sup> She also had elevated emotionality, which increased her pain sensitivity.
<p>Based on her history, doctors reasoned that her low <a>appetite</a> and poor arousal recognition developed as a way to manage her stomach pain. </p>
<sup>5</sup> Until we receive more findings from Thomas, let's consider some unanswered questions.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Sensory processing alterations might result in "unusual" feeding patterns.</div> <div>Source: KoolShooters/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>sensory processing</a> is a core, but under-explored, ARFID feature.
<sup>13</sup> For example, some individuals diagnosed with ARFID might have food color preferences. Understanding these preferences could help explain ARFID onset.
<p>Additionally, we need to investigate interactions between gastrointestinal discomforts, sensory processing, and brain regulation. While we know that these functions influence one another, we don't know exactly how.</p>
<p>Moreover, many individuals are co-diagnosed with autism and ARFID.<sup>15 </sup>Better understandings of these relationships could further treatment efficacy. </p>
<a>therapy</a>, which uses eye-tracking to "retrain" brain engagement with
<a>traumatic</a> memories, has shown to help individuals with ARFID reduce memories of choking.

<h1> Reproductive Dysfunction and Eating Disorders </h1>
<h2> Intense athletic training can set the course for eating disorders </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Are Eating Disorders? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from an eating disorder</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is common in both eating disorders and athletes.</li>
<li>Consequences of FHA are reduced motivation to eat, increased anxiety, and depression.</li>
<li>By increasing risk factors for an eating disorder, FHA makes an individual more vulnerable to developing an eating disorder. </li>
<li>Not all eating disorders start with body shape and weight concerns.</li>
<p>We often think of eating disorders (EDs) as consequences of body dissatisfaction. The trope is that young women begin <a>dieting</a> to achieve an idealized body size and shape based on western culture preferences.</p>
<p>What's not discussed enough, though, is how reproductive dysfunctions, often brought on by intense <a>athletic</a> training, can increase ED susceptibility.</p>
<p>Also, people who don’t meet clinical criteria for an ED diagnosis can still develop reproductive dysfunctions and, consequently, are at risk for developing an ED.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Intense athletic training increases a person's risk for developing an eating disorder.</div> <div>Source: Li Sun/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea</h3>
<p>One reproductive disorder common in athletes is functional hypothalamic amenorrhea (FHA).</p>
<p>FHA is a condition where an individual capable of menstruation experiences consecutive missed menses due to dysfunction in her brain’s reproductive circuit, the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, or HPOA.<sup>2</sup></p>
<a>puberty</a>, disease, or anatomical abnormalities. Rather, common causes for FHA are stress, weight loss, nutritional deficits, and excessive exercise, all of which could be normalized in intense athletic training.
<h3>How Does Menstruation Happen?</h3>
<p>To understand how FHA increases ED risk, we first need to understand how the female reproductive system works.</p>
<sup>3</sup> This overseer of reproduction makes sure that
<a>hormones</a> get released in the right quantities at the right times for egg release.
<p>While the exact nature of this pulse generator remains a mystery, scientists think that it might be made up of cells called kisspeptin neurons.</p>
<p>When it's time for egg release during the ovarian cycle, kisspeptin neurons release kisspeptin, a chemical that starts a chain of events leading to egg release.</p>
<sup>4</sup> Consequently, a body low in available energy runs the risk of terminating egg release. This has an evolutionary component in that, if food were scarce, it wouldn't be
<a>wise</a> for a woman to get pregnant.
<h3>Leptin and Kisspeptin: Working Together</h3>
<p>How do kisspeptin neurons sense that the body has enough energy to support reproductive functions? Scientists think that these neurons join forces with leptin, the body's <a>satiety</a> chemical.<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>In addition to making people feel full, leptin has another job regulating puberty and reproduction by informing kisspeptin neurons when the body has enough energy to support egg release.<sup>7</sup></p>
<div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Are Eating Disorders? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from an eating disorder</a> </li> </ul> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Without adaquate energy, kisspeptin impairs fertility.</div> <div>Source: rodnaeproductions/pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Consequently, low leptin levels (low energy availability) means no egg release.<sup>8</sup></p>
<p>Following this logic would mean that if leptin regulates kisspeptin, then kisspeptin levels should also be low in elite athletes.</p>
<sup>1</sup> In animal research it's been demonstrated that rodents who swim excessively have lower kisspeptin levels compared to non-swimming rodents.

<p>There are additional ways that FHA increases an individual's vulnerability to developing an ED, such as <a>emotion regulation</a>.<sup>12</sup></p>
<sup>14</sup> are common risk factors for ED development.
<a>anxious</a> or depressed, while reducing her motivation to eat. This, coupled with the
<a>stressful</a> and competitive nature of athletics, might be enough to push someone towards an ED.
<a>disordered eating</a>, it can change an individual's biology in ways that elevate her vulnerability to developing one. Consequently, it's important to monitor athletes for ED risk beyond the obvious body shape concerns.

<h1> Using Music in Eating Disorders Treatment </h1>
<h2> The neurobiological effects of music during eating disorders recovery. </h2>

<li>Music therapy can improve emotion recognition, anxiety, self-identity formation, and social skills in people with eating disorders. </li>
<li>Despite the potential of music therapy for eating disorders treatment, it isn't widely used. </li>
<li>Explorations of music's neurobiological effects on eating disorder symptoms are needed to develop effective music therapies for them. </li>
<p>Eating disorders are notoriously challenging to treat. Nonetheless, music <a>therapy</a> has been demonstrated to alleviate some of the most common symptoms in eating disorders.<sup>1; 2; 3; 6</sup></p>
<p>Exactly why music therapy benefits eating disorders recovery isn't quite clear. Nonetheless, <a>neuroscience</a> can provide some possible explanations. </p>
<h3>What Is Music Therapy?</h3>
<p>Music therapy is a clinically-based type of therapy guided by professionally trained therapists. The objective of music therapy is to use the multifaceted ways humans connect with music to guide them towards personal recovery <a>goals</a>.</p>
<p>There are two main ways people engage in music therapy: receptive (e.g., listening to music) or active (e.g., producing music). </p>

<h3>Music Therapy and Eating Disorders</h3>
<sup>1</sup> increased body acceptance,
<sup>2</sup> increased awareness of bodily experiences (e.g., emotions; hunger cues),
<sup>3</sup> and improved emotion verbalization.
<h3>Improved Bodily Awareness</h3>

<sup>5</sup> It also explains why seeing others cry makes us cry.
<p>If the brain cells of people with eating disorders aren't used to "talking" about emotions, music therapy might be a way to reintroduce them to the conversation, while teaching them what certain bodily cues feel like and what they mean. </p>
<h3>Improved Social Anxiety</h3>
<a>eating disorder</a> symptoms that music therapy alleviates are
<a>social anxiety</a> and negative self-comparisons. Targeting these symptoms is essential for effective therapy because they encourage self-isolation and, consequently, treatment avoidance.

<h3>Building Self-Identity and Self-Acceptance</h3>
<p>Lack of self-<a>identity</a>, likely due to certain brain alterations, is another eating disorder symptom that music therapy might improve.<sup>15</sup></p>
<p>A recent music therapy study with recovering anorexics found that the most common lyrical theme people with anorexia write about is self-identity struggles.<sup>7</sup></p>

<p>People with eating disorders, however, have fewer self-schemas to rely on than most people, and the ones they do have are largely negative (e.g., I am unattractive).<sup>8</sup></p>
<a>dementia</a> research. Studies with dementia patients have illustrated that listening to one’s favorite music can “reactivate” and rescue neural pathways involved in self-identity.
<sup>9</sup> It's possible that people with eating disorders can experience a similar neural “reawakening” of the self while listening to music that is meaningful to them.

<h3>Anxiety and Eating Disorders</h3>
<sup>14</sup> Anxiety is an important symptom to treat in eating disorders because it can prolong illness by creating long-lasting brain changes that maintain the disorder, which interferes with full recovery.

<p>Listening to music has been shown to reduce <a>stress</a> and improve cardiovascular health in humans, both of which are common consequences of eating disorders.<sup>12</sup></p>
<a>adolescence</a> for several hours a day increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the brain’s learning/
<a>memory</a> molecule. This might protect against learned negative
<a>fear</a> associations (i.e., learning that food or body weight should be feared).

<h1> Early Explorations of the Neuroscience of Pica </h1>
<h2> Case studies can help us begin to understand the brain's role in Pica onset. </h2>

<li>Pica is the compulsive eating of non-edibles by both humans and non-humans. </li>
<li>Malnutrition, memory deficits, anxiety, and kidney dysfunction could contribute to Pica development. </li>
<li>Medications for obsessive-compulsive disorder have helped eliminate Pica symptoms. </li>

<p>While causes of all <a>eating disorder</a> (ED) types have been difficult to determine, one ED in particular, Pica, is especially under-researched.</p>
<p>Pica is the compulsive eating of non-edible food items (e.g., glass and nails) for at least one month.<sup>1</sup> It is most prevalent in infants and children; however, Pica has also been identified in adults<sup>2</sup> and animals.</p>
<p>We still don’t know what causes Pica, but some common themes from case studies have emerged.</p>
<p>One potential cause of Pica is malnutrition. Malnutrition can be voluntary (e.g., anorexia) or involuntary (e.g., food insecurity).</p>
<sup>3</sup> During the South African dry months (i.e., March through November) these giraffes develop geophagia (i.e., eating dirt) and osteophagia (i.e., eating bones), which is considered Pica behavior.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Malnutrition could cause Pica.</div> <div>Source: cottonbro/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<sup>3</sup> Eating non-foods could be a way for these giraffes to fulfill their nutritional needs.
<a>sex</a> differences were found in this study. However, giraffes with Pica behavior did show one unusual ailment: kidney stones and kidney lesions. This is important to note because kidney dysfunction restricts blood flow to the brain, which could cause
