<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Partnership vs. Adoption</a></h2> <p>Many people like the idea of partnership in their committed relationships, but the reality? Not so much.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>True Crime Sex Education: The Othered</a></h2> <p>No one wants to be the other. This is true generally but it is especially true in every aspect of human sexuality.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>True Crime Sex Education</a></h2> <p>Part 1: What we can learn from sex offenders will surprise you — as well as help you.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Never Date a Man Who... Doesn't Have Any Real Friends</a></h2>
<p>If a man has no friends or an intimate social support system, does that mean he doesn't need one? Nope. We're all members of a social species and friends are important.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Never Date a Man Who... Isn't an Adult on the Inside</a></h2> <p>Yes, we're a social species and yes, we're hardwired to fall in love, and yes we (mostly) all like sex. So what could possibly go wrong? </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Never Date a Man Who Can't Commit to an Abuse-Free Relationship</a></h2> <p>There are two types of people in this world: those who want to be free and those who want to have control. With which do you intend to build a romance?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Never Date a Man Who...Isn't Into Equality</a></h2> <p>Getting into a relationship based on equality doesn't just happen; you have to build it.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Never Date a Man Who...</a></h2> <p>OK, so that last boyfriend was a real pain. Good riddance to him but, how to find one of the good ones?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>How Then Shall We Live?</a></h2> <p>Failure to integrate our sexuality and spirituality creates disaster because our values are there to guide us and without their illumination, we are blinded.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Sex Offenders and Church</a></h2> <p>Religion is supposed to help us sort out right and wrong, understand how we should live, and so on. So what goes wrong?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Whole Shebang</a></h2> <p>In the last 30 years of my practice, those who have committed sex crimes have a 100 percent likelihood of three failures in their personal lives: career, friendship, and love.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Leaning Into Sexual Darkness</a></h2> <p>If we can understand how people came to make sexually criminal decisions, then we can help prevent future sex crimes.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h2><a>What You Could Learn from a Sex Offender Counselor</a></h2>
<p>Part 2: When I ask sex offenders the question, "What would you like to get out of therapy?" the most common response over decades is, "I'd like to know how this happened." </p>
<h2><a>You Could Learn a Lot from a Sex Offender Counselor</a></h2>
<p>For the last 21 years, I've worked as a sex offender counselor helping people who have been accused or convicted of sex crimes. We could all learn a lot from their stories.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Sex Addiction: Therapy's Dirty Little Secret </a></h2> <p>Any close examination of the term reveals a number of the field's dirty little secrets. None are pretty.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>If Not Sex Addicted, Then What?</a></h2> <p>OK then, if it's not sex addiction, what is the problem? Well, for starters, it's worse than you think.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Controversy Over Sex Addiction</a></h2> <p>So you think you're a sex addict? You might want to think again.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>A Slow Hand</a></h2> <p>Most of us have experienced regret about getting into a committed relationship with someone who turned out, in hindsight, to have been so very wrong for us. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Sex Talk</a></h2> <p>"Why don't they teach this in school? Everybody should know this!" A reasonable question for a society that preaches the importance of family.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Picky, Picky, Picky</a></h2> <p>No, you're not too picky. We all have personal deal-breakers that come up as we try to figure out how to have a great relationship and a sublimely happy future.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Universal Deal Breakers</a></h2> <p>There are two specific types of variables, both deal breakers, that can keep two people from having a successful, loving relationship. Today, we're going to discuss the first.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Filtering Out the Crazy</a></h2> <p>The “Intentional Interview” can help to increase awareness of mental health problems that could sabotage our efforts at having a great relationship.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Love's Due Diligence</a></h2> <p>Our resources of time, treasure, and talent are not infinite. When we fail to perform our due diligence when selecting a mate, we impoverish ourselves emotionally and spiritually.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Sexuality's Most Mysterious Need</a></h2> <p>Is integrating sexuality and spirituality really a human need? It is, but instead of seeking sexual information from a church, consider going within.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</a></h2> <p>Imagine having the perfect sex life. Then imagine that perfect sex life without x: is it still perfect?</p> </div> </div> </div>

<h1> My Body, My Self: Thinness or Muscularity? </h1>
<h2> Embedded within our culture are clear gender expectations about the body. </h2>
<li>Culturally, we believe women should be thin and men should be lean and muscular.</li>
<li>Both straight and gay men place more emphasis than women on the physical appearance of a potential romantic partner.</li>
<li>Straight and lesbian women display near equal expectations regarding how they should look to attract a potential romantic partner.</li>
<li>Straight and gay men do not differ in terms of the body they believed they should have to attract a potential romantic partner.</li>

<p>You might admire the way your body looks, or you might feel disgusted with it. Most of us are not on one extreme end of this wonderful to I-hate-it spectrum, though we might know someone who is.</p>
<p>One reason may be that both straight women and gay men try to attract male <a>sexual</a> and/or romantic partners. They are keenly aware that men, in general, tend to place paramount importance on potential partners' physical <a>attractiveness</a>.</p>
<p>Consistent with these beauty standards, they found that feeling fat was more damaging for one’s body image than not feeling muscular enough.</p>
<p>Additionally, the authors found both unique and overlapping views of various <a>gender</a> and <a>sexual orientation</a> groups:</p>
<li>Straight women placed less importance on the physical appearance of their partners than did men.</li>
<li>Straight women and lesbians in most domains did not differ from each other. For example, they displayed near equal expectations regarding how they should look to attract a potential romantic partner.</li>
<li>Straight women and gay men shared similar standards regarding their own and a potential partner’s physical appearance. Still, gay men were slightly more likely to prefer their men muscular and strive for thinness for themselves.</li>
<li>Straight men overestimated the degree of muscularity that women supposedly find attractive, and they had the lowest levels of eating disorders.</li>
<li>Straight men and lesbians did not differ in their preference for the body fat of a potential romantic partner.</li>
<li>Straight men and gay men did not differ in terms of the body they believed they should have to attract a potential romantic partner.</li>
<li>Lesbians and gay men adopted socio-cultural and heteronormative beauty ideals for themselves, but lesbians were less likely to apply those ideals of appearance-related preferences to a potential partner. </li>
<p>Gay men applied the same thinness and muscularity beauty ideal standards to themselves as they did to a potential romantic partner. </p>
<p>Those looks will inevitably wear thin; rather, it is more adaptative to look beyond the external to the internal—at least if there is any hope for mental health and <a>romantic relationship</a> longevity.</p>
