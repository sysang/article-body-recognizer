<a>Confucius. </a>Although Confucius did not specifically write about these concepts, his work revealed that they were pivotal to both his

<h1> The Power of Poetry Therapy </h1>
<h2> Poetry therapy is a powerful tool to augment psychotherapy. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Therapy? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Poetry therapy dates back to 400 BCE when Egyptians used writing as a form of medicine.</li>
<li>Poetry therapy is about exploring feelings and memories.</li>
<li>Therapists can encourage clients to keep journals and make note of where their words capture true feelings.</li>
<a>psychotherapy</a> has its roots in poetry.”
<h3>What Is Poetry Therapy?</h3>
<h3>The Healing Power of Poetry</h3>
<a>Finding What You Didn’t Lose </a>(1995), “There is something deeply personal and private about poetry-making. It is a journey into the depths” (p. 185). This journey is for both the poet and the reader.
<p>As poet Jane Hirshfield wrote in her book <a>Ten Windows, </a>“A good poem is comprehensive and thirsty. It pulls towards what is invisible to an overly directed looking, toward what is protean, volatile, unprotected, and several-handed."</p>
<h3>How to Use Poetry Therapy</h3>
<p>If you’re a therapist, here are some ways to help your clients embark on the poetry-writing process:</p>
<li>Encourage them to keep a journal and to highlight important entries.</li>
<li>Make note where words “sing” and where there are true feelings to capture.</li>
<li>Have them tell stories with the poems or to choose themes.</li>
<li>Encourage them to paint images with their words.</li>
<li>Suggest that they read their poems out loud to hear and fix the rhythm.</li>

<h1> Practicing Intuition for Self-Care </h1>
<h2> Using our intuition can help us navigate life's journey. </h2>
<li>Successful leaders often report that intuition has helped them in their careers.</li>
<li>There may be four types of intuition: physical, emotional, mental and spiritual.</li>
<li>A regular meditation practice and journaling can help people tap into their sense of intuition.</li>

<h3>What Does It Mean to Follow Your Intuition?</h3>
<a>inner voice</a>, which can be a huge tool in the
<a>confidence</a>. In addition, it was found to speed up the actual decision-making process.
<p>This is fascinating information and confirmation that trusting our inner voices and intuition can be a positive action. The researchers suggest that this was the first time a study has shown that intuition actually exists.</p>
<p>According to transpersonal psychologist Frances Vaughan (1998), intuitive awareness falls into four main categories: physical, emotional, mental, and <a>spiritual</a>, which we can use independently of one another.</p>
<a>trauma</a>. Being mindful of this reaction will allow you to cope.
<p>Spiritual inner knowing or soul guidance might be associated with mystical experiences. Experts have suggested that regular <a>meditation</a> practice can foster and enhance this type of intuition.</p>
<h3>How to Tap into Your Intuition</h3>
<li>Begin a regular meditation and <a>mindfulness</a> practice. Meditation will help you tap into your <a>subconscious</a> mind and is a powerful way to awaken your intuitive powers.</li>
<a>attention</a> to the thoughts that emerge. In your journal, write down what comes to you. As you go about your day, observe others, and see if you can pick up any information from their
<a>body language</a> even before they speak with you. It’s all about “tuning in.” When you have the opportunity, jot down your observations.
<a>visualization</a>: Shatki Gawain wrote two seminal books on the subject—Creative Visualization and Developing Intuition, which work hand in hand. Creative visualization is a technique where you close your eyes and use your
<a>imagination</a> to create what you want in your life. It can open you up to new creative energies that will help you tap into your intuition.

<h1> 7 Ways to Get More Focused </h1>
<h2> Even when it's difficult, there are tips on how to become more focused. </h2>
<li>The pandemic has added to the challenge of juggling work, domestic, and personal life.</li>
<li>Studies show that interrupting work with another activity increases the ability to focus.</li>
<li>According to research, the brain reacts positively to changes in work habits.</li>

<h3>Focusing and the Pandemic</h3>
<p>Do you find that you’re having difficulty focusing, both at work and home? Well, you’re not alone. </p>
<p>Even those who normally don’t have trouble focusing have found that the pandemic has robbed them of their ability to buckle down and maintain concentration.</p>
<h3>Life After the Pandemic</h3>
<a>stress</a>, poor sleep habits, dehydration, addictions, and eating unhealthy foods. Here are some tips that can help you maintain focus, each and every day:
<p>1. Clear your space. In his book Focusing, Eugene Gendlin suggests clearing the space where you work. If you have a home office, this means clearing your desk and leaving only what you need to work. That is, remove all the distractions. </p>
<p>3. Be <a>mindful</a> of your caffeine and sugar intake. These substances can cause sudden spikes and dips in your blood sugar and cortisol levels and thus affect your ability to focus.</p>
<p>5. Take a technology break. Even when working from home, you can do things during the workday that don’t involve technology. Taking a break from technology gives you a chance to clear your mind, and this particularly includes social media.</p>
<p>6. Engage your brain. This means trying a new skill, perhaps dancing, cooking, painting, tennis, or even learning a new language.</p>

<h1> 7 Strategies to Prevent Suicide During the Pandemic </h1>
<h2> September is National Suicide Prevention Month—and a good time to take action. </h2>

<li>September 10th is World Suicide Prevention Day.</li>
<li>Globally, suicide rates appear unimpacted by COVID-19, but there has been an increase in suicidal thoughts.</li>
<li>The pandemic may have inspired a "coming together," which could lead people to seek needed mental health assistance.</li>
<li>Yet suicidal thoughts can lead to suicide, so it's important to be mindful of how to prevent suicide.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: artbykleiton/Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Suicide is a permanent solution to what is often a temporary problem. September 10 is <a>World Suicide Prevention Day, </a>so it’s a good time to examine the topic as well as the tools we have to prevent suicide.</p>
<h3>The Impact of the Pandemic on Suicide </h3>
<a>fear</a>, uncertainty, isolation, social distancing,
<a>education</a> disruption, economic challenges,
<a>domestic violence</a>, and losing loved ones from the virus.
<a>trauma</a>. What might explain this phenomenon is that we’re spending more time with loved ones and might be getting additional emotional support that might not have been available prior to the pandemic.
<h3>Being Alert to the Signs of Suicide</h3>
<a>attention</a> on the importance of mental health treatments for individuals, communities, and nations.
<h3>Global Interventions and Suicide</h3>
<a>International Association of Suicide Prevention. </a>The aim of this group is to bring together clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and those with lived experiences to examine opportunities to improve care around the globe.
<p>Here are some suicide prevention strategies that could make a difference:</p>
<li>Encourage engagement in meaningful connections. Humans are social creatures, so we need to connect with others. What’s most important is not how many connections we have, but whether these connections are heartfelt, quality interactions.</li>
<a>therapy</a>, journaling can be a powerful way to release feelings and emotions. It can also increase self-awareness. Writing letters to help express frustrations about particular situations can also help lessen the tension of many stressors.
<a>resilience</a>. It’s vital to remind people that although sometimes there are no suicide warning signs, friends and loved ones need to be alert to the most common ones, such as prolonged depression, excessive
<a>substance abuse</a>, and untreated mental illness.
<li>Identify health needs in yourself and others. Early detection is important in suicide prevention. Treatment such as talk therapy and medications can often help.</li>
<a>teenagers</a> and young adults.
<li>Reach out for help. If you or a loved one has had thoughts of suicide, please seek help. There are probably free services in your community, and/or you can contact the National Association for Suicide Prevention. </li>

<a>anxiety</a> swelled inside me. I turned on the tears. "No, don't make me stay." And before I knew it, I was homeward bound. Spiderman comic books would be my solace. In my
<a>fantasy</a> self as the wall-crawling

<a>philosophy</a> with their children (a combination of structure/guidance and support for expressing emotion) with positive
<a>parenting</a> (and less harsh) behaviors, as well as increased self-soothing in children. Research on
<a>childhood</a> "styles" of relationship
<a>attachment</a> with early caregivers has predicted outcomes such as successful friendships and
<a>fear</a> which still arise). I've also learned to talk to the children and parents I work with about breaking such patterns of fear, anger and regret within themselves.

<h1> Things We Need You to Know: Tuning in to the Voice of Troubled Kids </h1>
<h2> Are we willing to really listen to troubled kids? </h2>
<p>Though my blog will generally focus on discussing what the research and clinical literature has to say about troubled kids, sometimes I think it's important to wonder about another perspective . . . that of the kids themselves.</p>
<p>It is important to wonder about the "voices" of these children. Research and clinical experience are crucial, but so is the experience of those we're intending to care for.</p>
<p>Things I Need You To Know . . .</p>
<p>I don't want to be here because it means I failed in order to get here.I've never belonged to things much in the past.I learned a long time ago to reject you before you can reject me.Did I mention that I want your attention?</p>
<p>I'll be looking for ways to get control by hitting your buttons,And by "splitting" you against one another,And against my family as well,And by sparking other kids to get in troubleBecause control is something I've been without for quite a while.</p>
<p>I will try to embarrass you.I will try to make you angry.I will try to make you nervousI will try to make you hate meBecause then I will know I'm not crazy for feeling these things myselfBecause then I will know who I can begin to trust.</p>

<h1> 10 Ways to Keep a Relationship Going Strong </h1>
<h2> Getting the love you want by practicing mindfulness and respect. </h2>
<li>A healthy relationship requires constant attention.</li>
<li>Trust, dependability, realistic expectations, a positive outlook, and deep caring create the bedrock of a healthy relationship.</li>
<li>A healthy relationship requires connection on a physical, emotional, and psychological level, while respecting the needs of each person.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: simona pilolla 2/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Say what you feel, especially if your emotions are raw, and leave plenty of room to talk your feelings out, without interruption or defensiveness. Over time, you and your partner will develop your own short-hand way to address sensitive issues.</p>
<h3>Keep your relationship fresh. </h3>
<a>sex</a>. Obviously, being intimate is an essential part of a healthy relationship. Connecting physically is also about showing affection—embracing, holding hands, touching, kissing, looking into each other’s eyes.
<a>attachment</a> are released when we connect physically. These help to keep love alive and to keep us bonded to one another.
<h3>Appreciate each other’s perspective.</h3>
<h3>Have realistic expectations.</h3>

<h2> Here are 4 lifelong skills we didn't learn in school. </h2>
<li>Partners in strong relationships learn how to become attuned and responsive to each other's needs.</li>
<li>Developing strong communication skills can help individuals express what they want.</li>
<li>Understanding how to self-soothe can help people stay connected to their partner even when they're frustrated.</li>

<p>Philosophers have told us that to love and be loved gives meaning to our lives. All the great spiritual traditions teach that love is the essence of spiritual life. Love is indeed a noble ideal, but how do we get there?</p>
<p>Here are four practical skills for creating a foundation to love and be loved in a mature way. Many of these thoughts are expanded in my book, <a>The Authentic Heart</a>.</p>
<p>We often underestimate our power in a relationship. It might be validating and empowering to realize that we have the ability to make another person happy through our generous responsiveness.</p>
<a>Nonviolent Communication (NVC)</a> offers one helpful method for communicating effectively.
<a>mindfulness</a> to notice our immediate reactions and pause long enough to uncover our deeper, more vulnerable feelings and needs—and find the courage to express them in a skillful way.
<a>meditation</a>, yoga, or tai chi help us find inner peace and ease. For others, journaling, artwork, or
<a>petting a cat</a> or dog is soothing. By finding a way to be with ourselves when we’re not getting the mirroring or
<a>attention</a> we want, we’re more able to stay connected.

<h1> What’s the Best Way to Change? </h1>
<h2> Should we transform gradually or quickly? </h2>
<li>People often approach change with unrealistic expectations that eventually lead to frustration.</li>
<li>Changing incrementally over time is easier to maintain, giving one a better chance at long-term success.</li>
<li>Making changes in small steps increases one's sense of self-efficacy.</li>
<li>Some situations demand sudden, radical change, but they are quite rare.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Opening to Change</div> <div>Source: heroic/shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>This is an unhealthy approach that frequently backfires. It creates unrealistic expectations which trigger frustration when things do not work out, causing us to become demotivated.</p>
<p>In reality, change takes time. Changing in small steps is more realistic, feasible to achieve, and most importantly, easier to maintain so that it becomes a long-term change. </p>
<p>It worked. I slowly built a relationship with cold showers. Since then, we've gotten <a>divorced</a>—me and cold showers—so I'm not doing them anymore. But the point is that gradual change worked much better than a full-on approach.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>change</div> <div>Source: Heoric/shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>So, say for example you wish to start meditating regularly. Great, you are offering yourself a wonderful gift.</p>

<p>I'm a very organized person, so in this example, I'd start with short meditations and let them increase with time, using a three-stage process.</p>
<li>The first week, I would add “2 minutes of <a>meditation</a>” to my to-do list or calendar—once per day.</li>
<li>The second week, I would add the task of “5 minutes of meditation” daily.</li>
<li>The third week, I would make the task “10 minutes of meditation” daily.</li>
<p>Then, you can see whether you wish to make it longer or shorter.</p>
<a>diet</a>, changing your priorities, changing your
<a>self-talk</a>, changing your friends, changing the time you spend online, retraining your mind. You could apply it to anything you wish to change in your life.
<h3>Why it's better to change slowly</h3>
<p>Now, why, from a psychological point of view, is it better to change in small increments? There are a number of different reasons, and the most prominent one is <a>self-efficacy</a>.</p>
<a>motivation</a>. If you believe you can do it, you are motivated—and the other way around.
<p>This psychological process could be applied to any change you wish to implement in your life.</p>
<p>Gradual versus fast change is an important topic to consider as we grow and transform. I hope it will now become easier for you to find a healthy, gradual, way to implement the change you want.</p>
<p>I invite you to think about your own pattern when it comes to changes in your life—do you tend to jump all-in, or do you gradually change? And does your pattern serve you in your personal journey of transformation?</p>
<p>I am sending you strength and courage for the journey ahead.</p>

<h3>Accomplishments and interests</h3>
<a>philosophy</a>, literature, history, and religion. His holistic view of the world allowed him to approach management from a wider, more informed lens.
<a>retirement</a> is being redefined, productive and positive aging is one of the most important concepts of our time. Drucker lived it. He published books and articles well into his 90s, and his active
<a>career</a> spanned more than 70 years, all of them marked by extreme intellectual curiosity and a love of learning.
<h3>Systems and strategies</h3>
<a>innovation</a> and entrepreneurship, now well-studied subjects but less so when he published his classic 1985 book Innovation and Entrepreneurship: Practice and Principles.
