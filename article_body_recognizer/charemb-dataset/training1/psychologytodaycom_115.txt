<h1> 5 Ways to Deal with People Who Stress You Out </h1>
<h2> 4. Don’t assume that present stress means future stress. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Stress? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome stress</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>It is often said that stress is in the mind of the beholder, but it can also come from certain people.</li>
<li>By taking stock of the microstressors in your daily life, you can gain insight into who produces your worst stress.</li>
<li>New research on coping inventiveness shows the advantages of using your imagination to make that stress melt away.</li>
<a>stressful</a> event may be experienced by someone else as a challenge—and turning a threat into a challenge is the key to coping, even though this may involve a degree of mental gymnastics.
<h3>How to Identify Sources of Interpersonal Stress</h3>
<a>anxious</a> and tense? Are these really “situations” or just people? Maybe you never thought about the possibility that a particular person is the source of your feeling on edge.
<p>See if you find as stressful these people-related hassles on the Mainz Inventory of Microstressors (Chmitorz et al., 2020) (translated from the German):</p>
<li>Waiting for one person.</li>
<li>Talk or gossip from other people.</li>
<li><a>Discrimination</a> or <a>bullying</a> by another person.</li>
<li>Conflict or disagreement in the workplace.</li>
<li>Conflict or disagreement with friends.</li>
<li>Conflict or disagreement with loved ones.</li>
<li>Conflict or disagreement with people you don’t know well (e.g. neighbor).</li>
<li>Conflict or disagreement with your children.</li>
<li>Problem due to lack of support or help from others.</li>
<li>Unexpected or unwanted visit.</li>
<li>Disturbing behavior or misconduct of others (e.g. reckless smokers, disturbing neighbors).</li>
<h3>The 5 Coping Strategies for Reducing Interpersonal Stress</h3>
<a>optimism</a>, and emphasizing the positive aspects of the situation despite the threat.
<a>resilient</a>. Building on that last point, regarding the people who stress you out as sources of manageable hassles can help you gain greater general
<a>confidence</a> in your ability to bounce back from threats. Using your experiences with them as practice opportunities for other, non-interpersonal stressors can help you expand your coping abilities in general.

<h1> Your Most Important Emotional Tools </h1>
<h2> They're not necessarily positive emotions. </h2>
<li>Emotions can serve both as reactions to events and as instruments that can be manipulated to solve a problem or change a situation.</li>
<li>People tend to use positive emotions as tools more often than negative emotions.</li>
<li>Faking positive emotions can take a toll on people, so using that tactic isn't always beneficial. </li>
<a>emotion regulation</a> shows that 90% of the studies conducted in this area focus on people’s needs to rid themselves of such negative emotions as frustration,
<a>stress</a>, and even a tendency to engage in “undesirable behaviors.” The emotionally drained employee could, according to this logic, act in what are called counterproductive work behaviors such as stealing office supplies or
<a>cheating on</a> an expense sheet.
<h3>See What’s in Your Emotional Toolkit</h3>
<a>authenticity</a> as the key mediating factor. Participants in these studies ranged from college students to online adult samples, and the authors used a mix of methods.
<p>You can see what it was like to be in this part of the study by reading each set of instructions (excerpted):</p>
<p>As you go about your day, think about which emotions would be useful in each situation you encounter. When you identify an emotion that might be useful, we would like you to intentionally feel that emotion.</p>
<p>Emotions as reactions (reactive):</p>
<p>As you go about your day, allow yourself to feel whatever emotions you happen to feel in each situation you encounter. If an emotion comes upon you, you need not make an effort to change or manage it.</p>
<p>Those in the positive emotion condition focused on feelings of pride, <a>gratitude</a>, love, and compassion and those in the negative emotion condition received instructions specific to anger, anxiety, envy, and <a>guilt</a>.</p>
<p>The final question to pose to yourself is to ask, “How satisfied were you with how the situation played out?”</p>
<h3>What to Do with Your New Emotional Tool Knowledge</h3>
<a>optimism</a> becomes the opposite of what’s intended and you are more miserable than you were when you started out.
<a>happiness</a> research which contrasts finding a sense of meaning in life with the need to be constantly upbeat. By forcing yourself to try to feel what you’re not, your search becomes ever more frustrating.
<p>To sum up, being able to take stock of the emotions you use to address your daily experiences can provide you with a starting point so that the tools you use will be the ones to give you the greatest sense of fulfillment.</p>

<h1> Why So Many People Blame Their Partners When Things Go Wrong </h1>
<h2> ... and how to let them off the hook. </h2>
<li>People have a tendency to judge who's to blame in an accident by the outcome, not the individual's intent.</li>
<li>If you tend to attribute blame to your partner for accidental outcomes, it can be helpful to learn how to understand the role of intent.</li>
<li>When someone's intent is to cause harm, it's important to overlook the outcome in judging blame even when no harm occurs.</li>
<h3>How Do People Assign Blame for Accidents?</h3>
<p>According to Nobes and Martin, there’s a disconnect between intention and outcome. At a relatively early age, children learn to separate these two aspects of assigning blame for accidents.</p>
<p>One autumn afternoon, Cynthia is driving home from getting lunch. Her two brothers are in the car with her. As they get close to their home, they see a very large leaf pile on the side of the road, the biggest they have seen all season.</p>
<p>The experimental manipulation consisted of providing participants with one of several possible endings, defined as follows; in each case, Cynthia feels two bumps as she drives through the leaves:</p>
<li>Original: Cynthia’s brother asked her to drive through the leaves.</li>
<li>Non-negligent: A car comes veering toward them and Cynthia had to swerve to avoid it and ends up in the leaves.</li>
<li>Negligent: Cynthia’s brother asks her to drive through the leaves and she does so, forgetting that children often play in them.</li>
<li>Reckless: Cynthia’s brother asks her to drive through the leaves and she does so, even though she knows that children often play in them.</li>
<p>Varying the outcomes of each scenario defined the final manipulation, as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Positive: The bumps were two sticks and they didn’t damage the car</li> <li>Negative: The bumps were two children who were killed instantly.</li> </ul>
<h3>How Can You Make Better Judgments of Your Partner’s Behavior?</h3>
<a>unconscious</a> malice. In other words, going “
<a>Freudian</a> slip” on your partner could lead to a faulty instance of finger-pointing.
<a>bias</a> can lead to the sort of unfair blaming that can only further erode your relationship.

<h1> Don’t Be Insulted if a Narcissist Forgets Your Name </h1>

<li>Being able to associate a name to a face is a basic memory skill required for good relationships.</li>
<li>New research shows that people high in narcissism are so preoccupied with themselves that they fail at simple memory tests.</li>
<li>If a narcissist forgets your name, you don't have to feel bad, as they cannot process most new information.</li>
<p>When you meet someone for the first time, you might try mightily to register the connection between their name and face, especially if you think you’ll see them again.</p>

<h3>The Poorer Memory of Narcissists</h3>
<a>memory</a> as a way to advance socially, if they have this attentional deficit, that desire will paradoxically become thwarted by their excessive self-focus.
<p>Giacomin and her fellow researchers began their investigation with a series of online experiments. They tested recognition memory not just for faces but also for nonsocial stimuli, including a range of objects such as telephones and houses.</p>

<h1> A New Theory of Emotions Enters the Scene </h1>
<h2> The newest emotion theory explains what leads your emotions to flip on and off. </h2>
<li>The causes of emotions, and changes in emotions, remain a central theoretical question in psychology.</li>
<li>A new approach introduces the intriguing idea of the "semantic pointer" as the mechanism that flips the emotional switch.</li>
<li>By understanding the contributions of semantic pointers to your emotions, you can gain better control over dysfunctional feelings.</li>
