<p>Jan. 6, 2021, was always on the country’s radar.</p>
<p>[<a>The four-hour insurrection: How a Trump mob halted American democracy</a>]</p>
<p>As the scene in D.C. <a>continued to darken</a>, smaller demonstrations across the nation also flared, forcing officials in several statehouses to evacuate.</p>
<p>This is how the day unfolded.</p>
<h3>Trump rallies his supporters as Congress convenes</h3>
<h3>Pro-Trump mob breaches Capitol, forces Congress to adjourn</h3>
<h3>Trump refuses to condemn violence as conflict intensifies</h3>
<p>Trump remained relatively quiet, even as the country called on him to make a statement that could end the chaos. Though he eventually told the mob to go home, he simultaneously expressed his love for the rioters and rationalized their feelings.</p>
<h3>After the Capitol is secured, Congress officially declares that Biden won the election</h3>
<a>called for Trump’s immediate removal from office</a>, either through the 25th Amendment or impeachment.
<p><a>Five people died</a> as a result of the Capitol breach, one from gunfire and three from medical emergencies. Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick died Thursday night of unspecified injuries he suffered in the attack.</p>
<p>Trump eventually released a video Thursday evening, calling for calm and declaring he is now focused on a “smooth, orderly, seamless transition of power.” The very next morning, however, he sent another tweet:</p>
<p>Twitter <a>permanently suspended</a> Trump’s account around 6:20 p.m. Friday night for “incitement of violence.”</p>

<p>Since 1996, green-card holders have been required to be a legal resident for five years before accessing federal benefits. That requirement is waived for some green-card holders who have worked in the United States for 40 quarters.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Borjas also argues that immigrants bring other economic gains, which ultimately offset that cost.</p>
<h3>U.S. has a long history of immigration changes</h3>
<p>In 1960, 9.7 million immigrants made up 5.4 percent of the total U.S. population. Since then, the country’s foreign-born population has grown immensely, driven by a series of immigration initiatives passed in the 1960s.</p>
<p>In 1962, the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act, championed by President John F. Kennedy, was passed to assist people fleeing conflict.</p>
<p>By 2018, 44.8 million immigrants lived in the United States, making up 13.7 percent of the nation’s population, according to Pew Research.</p>

<header><div/><div><div><a>National</a></div></div><div><h1>Shootings never stopped during the pandemic: 2020 was the deadliest gun violence year in decades </h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Reis Thebault</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Danielle Rindler</div></span></div></span></div><div>March 23, 2021 at 11:42 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>Until two lethal rampages this month, mass shootings had largely been absent from headlines during the coronavirus pandemic. But people were still dying — at a record rate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In 2020, gun violence killed nearly 20,000 Americans, according to <a>data</a> from the Gun Violence Archive, more than any other year in <a>at least two decades</a>. An additional 24,000 people died by suicide with a gun.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The vast majority of these tragedies happen far from the glare of the national spotlight, unfolding instead in homes or on city streets and — like the covid-19 crisis — disproportionately affecting communities of color.</p></div>
<a>spas in the Atlanta area</a> and Monday’s shooting at
<a>Sandy Hook Promise</a>. “It doesn’t get the support, the spotlight, the national attention. People don’t understand that it’s continuous and it’s on the rise.”
<a>the highest one-year increase</a> in homicides since it began keeping records, with
<a>the country’s largest cities</a> suffering a 30 percent spike. Gunshot injuries also rose dramatically, to nearly 40,000, over 8,000 more than in 2017.
<a>the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis</a>.
<a>a surge of firearm sales</a>. In 2020, people purchased about 23 million guns, a 64 percent increase over 2019 sales, according to a Washington Post analysis of federal data on gun background checks.
<a>One recent study</a>, from the Educational Fund to Stop Gun Violence,
<div><div><p>Failing to focus on this more common form of gun violence obscures the severity of the crisis, Dunn said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When I heard it on the news, my heart broke, I was so sad,” she said. “But then I got on with my life.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Five months later, her son was killed at school.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Even if it’s not happening in your community, it’s happening in the community of America.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Across the country, the swell of shootings has not spared the young.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The increase is especially striking because it occurred in a year when most children weren’t attending class in person and were spared deadly school shootings. Experts say it highlights the severity of suicide and domestic violence.</p></div>
<div><div><p><a>Sandy Hook Promise’s crisis center</a> is fielding a record number of calls from young people contemplating suicide or witnessing other violence, Barden said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For a lot of students in our country, home is not the safest place to be,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even though the rate of mass shootings slowed last year, several occurred before the killings in Atlanta and Boulder, according to The Post’s <a>public mass shootings database</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Twenty-two people have been killed in five other shootings since last March: At a weekend Juneteenth celebration in Charlotte, a July 4 block party in Chicago and at a convenience store in Springfield, Mo., among others.</p></div></div>
<p>On average, there was one mass shooting every 73 days in 2020, compared with one every 36 days in 2019 and one every 45 days in 2017 and 2018. The slowdown interrupted what had been a five-year trend of more frequent and more deadly mass shootings.</p>
<div><div><p>“They will bear the trauma and the scars of that catastrophe for the rest of their lives,” he said. “The collateral damage is unquantifiable, and it’s reaching almost everyone.”</p></div></div>

<div> <div> <p>Unit 904</p> </div> <div> <p>Collapsed</p> <p>section</p> </div> </div>
<div><p>A woman in <b>Unit 111</b> heard loud knocking sounds. Another, in <b>412,</b> was on the phone with her husband and screamed. Then the line went dead.</p></div>
<div><p>On the other side of the building, a teenager in <b>904</b> felt her home shake, before plummeting four floors.</p></div>
<h3>Split in half: The 04 units</h3>
<p>The few hundred permanent residents of 8777 Collins Avenue in Surfside, Fla., had selected their homes for all sorts of reasons: what was available, what they could afford, the square footage and the view.</p>
<p>In those units, the master bedrooms — and the people sleeping in them — were pulled down into the rubble. But the living rooms were on the other side of the fault line; they remained standing, and people in them had a chance to survive.</p>

<p>But Edgar Gonzalez, husband and father, vanished into the wreckage.</p>
<p>Hours after the collapse, his sister, Adriana Chi, was at the family reunification center, distraught. Her niece and sister-in-law had come out of surgery, she told The Post. But nobody had heard from her brother.</p>

<p>Sometimes when she gazed out at the rolling waves of the Atlantic, she was accompanied by a fluffy cat with blue eyes named Izzy who visited Hedaya, a cat lover, when her friend Debra Golan went on vacation.</p>
<p>Three hours before the collapse, Hedaya wrapped up a phone call with Golan that lasted more than an hour.</p>
<p>“We were just catching up on life. It was one of those conversations — amazing until you’re too tired to continue,” Golan remembered. She hung up with Hedaya at 10:25 p.m. Wednesday. It was the last anyone heard from her.</p>
<p>Directly above Hedaya in Unit 704 were two transplants from Venezuela, Leon Oliwkowicz, 80, and his wife, Cristina Beatriz de Oliwkowicz, 74. Their bodies were recovered Sunday.</p>
<p>Erick De Moura, a native of Brazil, lived in Unit 1004. On a normal work night, he would have been there asleep.</p>
<p>She probably saved his life, he told The Post.</p>
<p>Since the collapse, he said he’s been visiting the building site twice a day.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m in a dream,” De Moura said. “I feel like I’m in a movie. I’m in a bad movie.”</p>
<h3>The first to fall: 02s, 03s, 10s and 11s</h3>
<p>The middle section of the tower fell first. Experts said it appeared to crumble from the ground up. The few people in those units who survived the collapse lived on the upper floors.</p>
<p>[How Champlain Towers South fell and what it reveals about possible causes]</p>
<p>The couple are well-known and well-connected: Núñez is a plastic surgeon with celebrity clients, and Galfrascoli is a theater producer who is close friends with the first lady of Argentina, according to the Miami Herald.</p>
<p>“They were very, very much in love,” said Wendy Kays, a nurse practitioner who met Doran 11 years ago in the emergency room where they both worked.</p>
<p>The couple moved into Champlain Towers South shortly after their marriage, choosing it for its proximity to Manashirov’s clinic.</p>
<p>“Ironically, the apartment was absolutely gorgeous,” said another friend, Erick Dickson.</p>
<p>As the days tick by and the two remain missing, Kays has been looking for silver linings.</p>
<p>“I feel a little comfort to know that they went together,” she said.</p>
<p>One door down in Unit 702, Ana Ortiz, her husband, Frankie Kleiman, and her son Luis Bermudez, who had muscular dystrophy, were making plans to attend a funeral Thursday for a family friend who died of covid-19, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Ortiz, Bermudez and Kleiman were found dead in the rubble.</p>
<p>“Now rest in peace and without any obstacles in heaven,” Bermudez’s father, also named Luis, wrote to the Associated Press about his son. “I will see you soon my Luiyo.”</p>
<p>Kleiman’s mother, Nancy Kress Levin, was on the same floor, in Unit 712, along with his brother Jay Kleiman and another relative, Deborah Berezdivin. None of them have been found.</p>
<p>A few have been found. Nicholas Balboa told The Post he was walking his dog when he heard a boy’s voice minutes after the collapse.</p>
<p>“Help! I’m here,” the boy cried out. “Don’t leave me! Don’t leave me!”</p>
<p>Jonah said his mother, Stacie Fang, was in there, too, but Balboa said he couldn’t see or hear her.</p>
<p>Fang, 54, was the first person declared dead in the disaster. She died of blunt force injuries, according to the county medical examiner. A close family member said Jonah did not suffer severe physical injuries.</p>
<p>She raced back to her apartment to get her kids. They sprinted for their lives toward the exit and then away from the building, running blindly through a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>“I heard a huge noise behind me, but I didn’t want to turn around,” she told COLLive. “I thought the end of the world had come.”</p>
<p>Monteagudo, the 64-year-old, escaped, too, after awakening in Unit 611 in the wee hours of Thursday morning. “It’s like something supernatural woke me up. I felt something strange,” she told The Post.</p>
<p>She got up to check her apartment. In December, she had spent all the money she received in her divorce — $600,000 cash — to buy the unit.</p>
<p>She heard a sharp noise, then watched as a crack — two inches wide and growing wider — snaked down her wall, from the ceiling toward the floor. Her instincts kicked in.</p>
<p>As she sprinted down the stairs, the building collapsed around her.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the stairs, she waded through water, climbed a wall and eventually made it onto the street, her crushed apartment behind her.</p>
<p>“I lost everything. I don’t have a past,” she said. “But I say, thank God I’m still alive.”</p>
<h3>The last to fall: 01 and 12</h3>
<p>For seven precious seconds after the building’s central section collapsed, the eastern apartments stayed standing. Then they, too, twisted and fell.</p>
<p>“It’s been a wild ride these past few weeks,” her post read. “Now we’ll begin to see everything leveling out.”</p>
<p>That night, as the pool deck buckled, she was on the phone with her husband in Denver, her older sister Ashley Dean told The Post. She described what she thought was an earthquake tremor. Then the line went dead.</p>
<p>“She screamed bloody murder, and that was it,” Dean said.</p>
<p>Stratton has not been found, nor has Harry Rosenberg, 57, who lived two floors below her. His best friend, Maurice Waschsmann, told the New York Times that Rosenberg was a “man with a heart of gold.”</p>
<p>In Unit 1001, Maria and Claudio Bonnefoy were expecting to see their niece Bettina Obias. Obias flew from Washington to spend time with the power couple — Maria works for the International Monetary Fund and Claudio for the United Nations.</p>
<p>But while she was collecting her luggage at the airport Thursday morning, Obias received a text message about the collapse. She rushed to the scene and screamed when she saw the devastation.</p>
<p>“To see the sheer magnitude, I was certain they were gone,” she said.</p>
<p>As more than half of the building imploded, the west section somehow stood firm: units 05 through 09.</p>
<p>Residents from those units have told harrowing tales of sprinting down disintegrating stair wells; of jumping over trenches, exposed rebar and slabs of concrete; of breathing the thick dust that swirled through the air.</p>
<p>Mostly, they evacuated with just the clothes on their backs, leaving behind wedding rings, collectible coins, vaccination cards — and their beloved pets, who have now been without their owners for a week.</p>
<p>Along with Champlain Towers South, a community collapsed, neighbors who chatted on the beach and waved at each other from windows, people who shared a space they all called home.</p>
<p>“A lot of friends of mine are gone,” Esther Gorfinkel, who lived in Unit 509, told The Post. “That section that fell down, I know everybody, and some of them were good friends of mine.”</p>
<p>Gorfinkel, 88, saw what had become of her neighbors’ homes from the beach, having gotten out through an emergency exit during the collapse and hurried to the shore.</p>
<p>He said he couldn’t stop thinking about the missing — “people I used to pass in the hallways, say hi from the balcony, talk to in the elevators.”</p>
<p>“It’s still trauma in my head,” Candiotti told The Post. “I feel very lucky. Out of all the houses, all the buildings that collapse, and my section didn’t collapse …”</p>
<p>He turned to Dina and hugged her.</p>
<p>“God brought me back,” he said, “to make sure you’re okay.”</p>

<h1>Here are some unanswered questions about the Jan. 6 attack</h1>
<h2>The Post investigation into the assault and its aftermath unveiled many new findings, but gaps remain as Trump seeks to block congressional inquiries.</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Washington Post Staff</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 3, 2021|Updated November 5, 2021 at 10:18 a.m. EDT</div></div>
<div><div><p>A number of critical questions still need to be answered to understand what happened:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How far did Trump go in his efforts to overturn the election?</div></h3></div></div>
<li>How seriously did Trump or his allies inside the government explore the use of emergency powers so he could remain in office?</li>
<li>Which federal, state and local officials did Trump pressure to overturn election results in the run-up to Jan. 6?</li>
<li>Did he communicate with organizers of the Stop the Steal protests?</li>
<li>How far has he taken his effort to subvert democracy in the aftermath of the attack, including the degree to which he has personally tried to force new ballot reviews in key states?</li>
<div><div><h3><div>What else did Trump do and say during his 187 minutes of inaction?</div></h3></div></div>
<li>How many phone calls did Trump make on Jan. 6 between 1:10 p.m., when he called on his supporters to march on the Capitol, and 4:17 p.m., when he called on the rioters to go home?</li>
<li>Who did he speak with, beyond the conversations already known, and what did he say?</li>
<li>What, if anything, did Trump communicate to lawyer John C. Eastman, who was pressuring Vice President Mike Pence to block certification of the election results during and even after the riot?</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Who was responsible for specific actions at and around the Capitol?</div></h3></div></div>
<ul><li>Who built the noose and makeshift gallows on the West Front of the Capitol?</li><li>Who manufactured and planted pipe bombs outside nearby buildings?</li><li>How did rioters know to target unsecured windows to gain entry to the Capitol?</li></ul>
<div><div><h3><div>Why were federal law enforcement agencies not better prepared for violence?</div></h3></div></div>
<li>Did anyone in the Department of Homeland Security raise concerns about a need for a public security bulletin or other steps needed to prepare for Jan. 6?</li>
<li>Why did the scores of threats and other warnings of violence on Jan. 6 that were catalogued by fusion centers — the nation’s network of regional homeland security offices — go unheeded by law enforcement officials?</li>

<p>Their tone was urgent: You shouldn’t be home tonight, one said.</p>

<p>The deputy asked whether he had been listening to the news. There are massive protests in Washington, the deputy said. They’ve broken into the Capitol.</p>
<p>Morning had come, and Maricopa County was quiet. Hickman was unsure if the threat had passed. He called his family farm. He wouldn’t be coming in to work today.</p>
<p>As their flight began its descent toward Denver on the night of Jan. 7, Salud Carbajal and Joe Neguse were on edge.</p>
<p>In nearly every seat, in every row, it seemed to the two Democratic congressmen, the other passengers were decked out in pro-Trump clothing. We’re surrounded by insurrectionists, Carbajal thought.</p>
<p>The atmosphere on the plane was charged. Then a chant began, a few voices at first.</p>
<p>“F--- Biden! F--- Biden!”</p>
<p>Louder and louder it grew, as others joined in. The lawmakers sat stunned.</p>
<p>“F--- Biden!”</p>
<p>“F--- BIDEN!”</p>
<p>The plane touched down. As Carbajal waited for his connecting flight to California and checked his phone, his dismay turned to fury: Officer Sicknick was dead.</p>
<p>The violent insurrection aimed at thwarting the democratic transfer of presidential power quickly became known by its date: Jan. 6. But the forces that drove Trump’s supporters into the halls of the Capitol did not fade after that day.</p>
<b> </b>voting laws in the name of ballot security. Election officials around the country would receive hundreds of menacing emails and calls after Jan. 6, a Washington Post investigation found.
<div><h6> Listen to threats collected by The Post</h6><div>Warning: This audio clip contains profanities and explicit language.</div></div>
<p>Trump declined to address The Post’s findings about the spread of violent rhetoric. Instead, spokesman Taylor Budowich accused the media of failing to examine the 2020 election, leaving it “up to the people to seek the truth.”</p>
<p>After Jan. 6, Trump would emerge emboldened, bluntly threatening those who did not share his obsession with last year’s vote and positioning himself to retake the White House in 2024.</p>
<div><div><p>American democracy had held on Jan. 6. But the events that followed showed that day would not be the last test.</p><div>3</div></div></div>
<h3><div>One day after</div></h3>
<p>Some of his bus mates clung to the hope that Trump would somehow remain president.</p>
<p>Hodgkins was skeptical. “I don’t see how that’s possible,” he recalled thinking. “We’re all going to have to eat the depression that he’s going to be leaving office.”</p>
<p>Word spread on the bus that Hodgkins had gone inside the Capitol. A couple of women asked him to share his experience, but he demurred.</p>
<div><div><p>A text came through from his mother, who had not wanted him to travel to Washington in the first place. She told him she never wanted to talk about what had happened at the Capitol that day.</p><div>4</div></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Sure, there may have been some ‘Antifa’ in DC, but there wasn’t enough to ‘Storm the Capital’ themselves,” Nichols wrote.</p><div>5</div></div></div>
<p>“I continue to strongly believe that we must reform our election laws to verify the identity and eligibility of all voters and to ensure faith and confidence in all future elections,” Trump said.</p>
<p>After an initial burst of bipartisan horror at the Capitol riot, many Republican officials fell back in line with Trump.</p>
<div><div><p>Campaign advisers met with Trump in the Oval Office to devise a poll to test public support for impeachment, then circulated the results among Hill Republicans to prove such a move would be risky.</p><div>8</div></div></div>
<p>“We got to everyone,” said a Trump aide. “We got McConnell, we got to McCarthy.”</p>
<p>The message: If you vote for impeachment, “you’re screwed.”</p>
<h3><div>Six days after</div></h3>
<p>The Republican senators were undeterred.</p>
<p>Their new push surprised Stephen Richer, the recently elected Maricopa County recorder, whose responsibilities included leading the county’s elections office.</p>
<div><div><p>On Jan. 14, Richer headed to the state Capitol for what he thought would be a one-on-one, get-to-know-you meeting with Senate President Karen Fann. He hoped a personal meeting might help bring the temperature down.</p><div>9</div></div></div>
<p>The Senate was in charge, they explained, and they would lead a new top-to-bottom review of the election. The senators were treating him like a petulant child, Richer thought to himself. His hopes of soothing tempers evaporated.</p>
<p>No one mentioned the violence in Washington.</p>
<p>Far to the north, in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, Houghton County Clerk Jennifer Kelly was also growing increasingly anxious.</p>
<p>For weeks, she had fielded complaints about Biden’s narrow victory in the state, many from people she’d known all her life. Trump had won Houghton County by 14 points, but that did not stop them.</p>
<p>At first, they sent sharp questions — direct but polite — to her official courthouse email account. But in the weeks following the attack on the Capitol, the complaints grew more heated.</p>
<div><p>“That couldn’t happen,” Knowles answered confidently, explaining that the machines were not connected to the Internet. He then walked through the layers of precautions that would prevent vote switching.</p><div>11</div></div>
<p>Seated at a long wooden table next to the county’s five commissioners, Kelly hoped the detailed explanation from a knowledgeable outsider might finally subdue the suspicions.</p>
<p>It didn’t — not that day, and not even after Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20.</p>
<div><div><p>Weeks later, the Senate acquitted Trump on charges that he had obstructed the election and incited the riot. Just 10 Republicans in the House and seven in the Senate supported the impeachment effort.</p><div>12</div></div></div>
<h3><div>29 days after</div></h3>
<p>As the Georgia General Assembly prepared to convene a new session, Republican lawmakers found themselves inundated.</p>
<p>Several senators told Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan (R) that they had to pass new election laws,<b> </b>even as some acknowledged they did not buy Trump’s claims of fraud.</p>
<div><div><p>At a committee hearing in February, Powell tried to explain his view, saying that widespread fraud “wasn’t found — it’s just in a lot of people’s minds that there was.”</p><div>14</div></div></div>
<p>The hate mail and ugly phone calls poured in. One Trump supporter called from Massachusetts to tell Powell, “I know who you are and I know where you live because your address is public.”</p>

<b> </b>but because they couldn’t see everything that was happening.
<div><div><p>Bradshaw did not say that she had seen fraud. But sentiments like hers bolstered lawmakers who were pushing legislation granting new powers for poll watchers.</p><div>15</div></div></div>
<p>Duncan felt a wave of dread when the first major bill came to the Senate floor — a bill so restrictive that House leaders had already indicated it was unlikely to prevail on their side of the building.</p>
<p>He couldn’t bear to preside over the Senate that day. Instead, he sat in his office and watched the debate on TV.</p>
<h3><div>41 days after</div></h3>
<p>“Hands!” yelled one agent, a hand on his gun holster. Hodgkins let the towel drop to the floor.</p>
<p>Hodgkins would be charged with five counts, including obstructing an official proceeding. The former Eagle Scout, who had never gotten in trouble with the law before, was mortified.</p>
<p>After failing to anticipate the Jan. 6 attack, the FBI was now racing to track down the hundreds of people in the predominantly White crowd who had swarmed the Capitol that day and then walked out, unhindered.</p>
<p>The FBI quickly built a digital intake system to handle the leads,<b> </b>much like the<b> </b>system used effectively after the mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert in 2017. Now that model faced its greatest test.</p>
<p>Federal investigators also turned their attention to another deep well of information: the threatening social media posts that analysts, academics and former national security officials had flagged in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6.</p>
<p>In the first eight weeks of the investigation, federal authorities arrested hundreds of people<b> </b>on charges related to the Capitol attack.</p>
<h3><div>48 days after</div></h3>
<p>Mendoza hadn’t prepared for the moment. “Look, this is my job,” she blurted out, before immediately regretting her words. “It pays the bills. What do you want, to be homeless?”</p>
<h3><div>59 days after</div></h3>
<p>The headline on the right-wing website: “After Finding Shredded Ballots in the Dumpster Earlier Today — A Mysterious Fire Breaks Out at Maricopa County Official’s Farm.”</p>
<p>Hickman was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>“It was our darkest day,” he said. “And this was just jaw-dropping.”</p>
<p>The angry emails and phone calls persisted for months.</p>
<p>The public stance put him at odds with his conservative family. One relative peppered Sterling via Facebook messages.</p>
<p>“The fact that there were more votes than registered voters in the US will never be explained away,” the relative wrote in February.</p>
<p>“There were not more votes than registered voters,” Sterling replied.</p>
<p>He concluded: “C’mon Gabe! You believe that BS?”</p>
<p>Again, Sterling replied patiently. “Most of the charges are [coming from] people who aren’t lying but don’t understand what they are seeing,” he wrote.</p>
<h3><div>65 days after</div></h3>
<p>Some defendants were already signaling that they planned to blame their actions squarely on Trump.</p>
<p>Indeed, even among those facing prison time, Trump’s ongoing pull was apparent.</p>
<p>Ronald “Ronnie” Sandlin of Tennessee, who allegedly plotted with two other men to bring weapons to the Capitol, had repeatedly told the judge that he regretted his actions. At one hearing, he could be heard weeping.</p>
<p>“Your honor, have mercy on me,” Sandlin said. “Please.”</p>
<p>But he conveyed a different message to friends and family.</p>
<p>“I’m in a cell block with all Capitol people,” Sandlin texted his mother on March 30. “I’m proud to call them my friends we stood up for what we believed in and sacrificed.”</p>
<div><div><p>“It may sound self serving but I truly believe I have a divine destiny to fulfill and I/we made history that day and the full implications of our actions [have] yet to be realized,” he wrote.</p><div>21</div></div></div>
<p>The implications were already clear for those contending with the aftermath. Mendoza and another officer tried to console each other in an ongoing text thread, sharing their nightmares and fears, often late at night.</p>
<p>Mendoza was working constantly, but when she occasionally had time for rest, she slept fitfully, plagued by a recurring dream that someone was breaking into her house.</p>
<h3><div>106 days after</div></h3>
<p>Across the country, the pressure from Trump and his supporters was getting results.</p>
<p>In mid-April, more than 2 million Maricopa County ballots and hundreds of tabulating machines were taken to the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum, a concrete former basketball arena in downtown Phoenix.</p>
<p>A state court had ordered the county to comply with the subpoena issued by the GOP-controlled state Senate, which was determined to review the ballots cast in the presidential race despite the lack of evidence of problems with the vote.</p>
<div><div><p>Once predicted to last just a few weeks, the project dragged on.</p><div>22</div></div></div>
<p>Three months after the Capitol siege, Trump supporters had something to cling to.</p>
<p>“We need one state. They’re all going to fall like dominoes,” proclaimed Mike Lindell, CEO of MyPillow, who was spending millions of his own money on films and rallies promoting false claims about voter fraud.</p>
<p>The leaders of Maricopa County — nearly all Republicans — could not believe what they were seeing. The election had been strength-tested over and over again, and yet now their ballots were in the hands of amateurs with an agenda.</p>
<p>Two days later, Richer received a disturbing message on his cellphone:</p>
<div><h6>Listen to threat to Maricopa Recorder Stephen Richer</h6><div>Warning: This audio clip contains profanities and explicit language.</div></div>
<p>The spotlight on the Arizona recount was only growing, thanks in part to the former president.</p>
<div><div><p>Trump was transfixed as workers in brightly colored shirts unpacked ballots and loaded them onto spinning plastic trays. He began conferring privately with Lindell and Bobb.</p><div>23</div></div></div>
<div><p>Throughout the spring, at his private Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, the former president buttonholed visitors about what was unfolding in Arizona, recounting his grievances with the 2020 election over steak and lobster.</p><div>24</div></div>
<p>“You’re our president!” a man yelled out in April as he walked through the lobby. “Thank you,” Trump mouthed back.</p>
<p>At one dinner, Trump approached a table where the guests tried to engage him in small talk. But he was not interested, instead recounting in granular detail how he believed the vote was fraudulent in states such as Georgia and Arizona.</p>
<p>“Everyone is talking about the election,” he told them. “It’s the biggest story on earth.”</p>
<p>With the Arizona review underway, Trump began discussing how to secure election reviews in other states, such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Hampshire and Georgia.</p>
<p>Perhaps, he told allies, he could soon be back in the White House.</p>
<h3><div>160 days after</div></h3>
<p>Michigan state Sen. Ed McBroom, a conservative lawmaker with a deep religious faith, is known by his colleagues as “the king of the Upper Peninsula” — a nod to his popularity in this remote region of the state.</p>
<p>In June, officials in Houghton County turned to the fourth-generation dairy farmer for help, hoping to put to rest the rumors still circulating in their community of hacked voting machines and Trump votes that had been flipped to Biden.</p>
<p>On June 15, McBroom appeared via Zoom at a county commissioners meeting and tried to tamp down concerns. The allegations, he said, were “made up.”</p>
<p>“What keeps on being postulated is something that is just not possible,” he said.</p>
<p>Some residents in the audience were not satisfied and demanded a fresh audit of the results. “What can be the harm? Let’s settle this,” said one speaker to scattered applause.</p>
<p>McBroom received scores of angry calls, emails and text messages, some calling for him to be “strung up” or “shot.”</p>
<p>Disheartened, McBroom tried to take the long view. My reputation and image are in the hands of God, he told himself.</p>
<p>Truth-tellers were no longer welcome in the GOP. Nor were those who saw the insurrectionists as anything other than patriots.</p>
<p>A few days later, angry conservatives booed Pence and chanted “Traitor!” at a Faith Freedom Coalition conference in Florida, an echo of the ominous shouts<b> </b>inside the Capitol on Jan. 6.</p>
<div><div><p>“Every single American has a responsibility,” Cheney told her. “Our institutions are very fragile. Every single person has a duty.”</p><div>26</div></div></div>
<p>The fallout was particularly acute for the handful of GOP state officials who had stood by the election results, such as Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state.</p>
<div><div><p>That’s probably a good thing, the activist retorted. She and others were likely to throw rocks if they showed up.</p><div>27</div></div></div>
<p>The delegates voted to censure Raffensperger. And Brian Kemp — the GOP governor who formally certified Biden’s win — was greeted with such loud boos that it was hard to hear him in some corners of the vast convention hall.</p>
<div><div><p>By the end of September 2021, GOP lawmakers around the country would introduce more than 400 bills restricting voting access — and would pass 33 laws in 19 states.</p><div>28</div></div></div>
<p>It was an overwhelming signal of Trump’s hold on the GOP.</p>
<h3><div>199 days after</div></h3>
<p>Inside the Arizona Federal Theatre in Phoenix on a Saturday in late July, Melissa Marsh, a landscape designer from Northern California, listened, rapt, as Trump championed the recount still underway in the state.</p>
<p>“The results will be so outrageous,” Trump said, promising the ballot review would spur action elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Now it’s turning out to be a revolution in this country,” he added.</p>
<p>“Mike Lindell has shown through data scientists and facts and evidence of how the election is fraudulent, how the ballots are not matching up,” she said, adding: “The media’s fake. It lies.”</p>
<p>Many of those in the audience were dubious that what had occurred in Washington amounted to an attack on a branch of the U.S. government.</p>
<div><div><p>Chris Park, a Scottsdale resident who works in marketing, echoed the unsubstantiated claim that FBI informants had encouraged people to enter the Capitol.</p><div>31</div></div></div>
<p>“That’s not an insurrection,” he said. “There was no actual violence that took place except for one person that got shot at the hands of the people that were supposed to be there.”</p>
<p>Sitting in the third row of the theater was Michelle Witthoeft, the mother of Ashli Babbitt.</p>
<p>A Capitol Police officer had shot Babbitt as she tried to climb through a broken glass panel in the doorway leading to the Speaker’s Lobby, yards away from the House chamber, where lawmakers were still evacuating.</p>
<div><div><p>For Witthoeft, the moment was surreal and bittersweet. “There was a lot of love for Ashli,” she said.</p><div>32</div></div></div>
<p>A few days later, Sterling, the Georgia election official, received a letter in the mail.</p>
<p>The note inside was written in cheerful, loopy penmanship, but its content was anything but upbeat:</p>
<p>Sterling wasn’t alone.</p>
<div><h6>Listen to threat to Richard Barron, Fulton County, Ga., elections director</h6><div>Warning: This audio clip contains profanities and explicit language.</div></div>
<p>This rising chatter, reminiscent of the disturbing rhetoric that emerged in the days before Jan. 6, alarmed federal officials in Washington.</p>
<p>Local officials didn’t need Washington to tell them what was happening. It was obvious every day when they checked their email and voice mail.</p>
<b> </b>instructed her staff to record the serial numbers of voting machines, document the unbroken seals on tabulators and note in writing that no one had tampered with the equipment.
<p>Without those measures, Kelly feared, the public would continue to doubt the results.</p>

<h3><div>213 days after</div></h3>
<p>It was at least the 30th time since Jan. 6 that such a threat had prompted the force to go on high alert.</p>
<p>A note hung on one of the boards, scrawled by Mendoza late one recent night. “Tragedy is not the end of our story,” it read.</p>
<p>She wanted the reminder, not just for herself but for her officers. But she knew many were struggling, never able to feel fully off-duty even when home with their families.</p>
<p>That day’s alert turned out to be a false alarm. But one day soon, Mendoza knew, it might be the real thing again.</p>
<p>“There is no normal anymore,” she said. “Normal is gone. This is just it.”</p>
<p>Hard-edged and sometimes violent rhetoric about the election persisted, even drawing back in Trump supporters who faced possible jail time for their actions.</p>
<p>In mid-August, a court officer found Douglas Jensen alone in his Des Moines garage, using an iPhone to watch Rumble, a video-streaming site that has become home to many right-wing personalities claiming censorship by Big Tech.</p>
<p>But Jensen admitted he had spent two days watching coverage of a symposium about alleged fraud in the 2020 election put on by MyPillow’s Lindell. He was ordered back to jail.</p>
<p>“In that act, he captured the threat to democracy that we all witnessed that day,” Moss said.</p>
<p>Weeks before he was set to report to prison, Hodgkins hired a new attorney who had falsely argued on social media that antifa and Democrats instigated the chaos at the Capitol.</p>
<p>Within days, Hodgkins decided to abandon the idea of appealing.</p>
<p>On a Sunday in September, he got 10 inches of his long hair cut off, went to church and prepared to report to prison the next day.</p>
<p>Still, he didn’t blame the former president.</p>
<p>“I made my own foolish choice,” Hodgkins said. He would vote for Trump if he ran again. Maybe Trump would even pardon him one day.</p>

<div><div><p>But most Republicans, at least, expressed little interest in bringing the Jan. 6 rioters to justice. More than half said such prosecutions were very important in March. Just one quarter did by September.</p><div>36</div></div></div>
<p>GOP leaders were also ready to move on from the Capitol attack. Graham, who had rebuked the president on Jan. 6, told a group of Michigan Republicans in September that he hoped Trump would run again.</p>
<b> </b>in his state. He sought to assure Trump voters that he had the former president’s support, telling conservative media personality Wendy Bell that he had spoken about the effort with Trump himself.
<p>“I think he’s comfortable where we are headed,” Corman said. Within weeks, a legislative committee had moved to issue subpoenas seeking a wide range of data and personal information about the state’s voters.</p>

<p>The burden would fall to election officials, Gableman said, to prove that the election was not tainted.</p>

<div><div><p>If Elder loses, Carbajal realized with dismay, Republicans would say the vote was rigged. Again.</p><div>39</div></div></div>
<p>A hand recount of nearly 2.1 million ballots had come up with nearly the exact vote totals as the certified result: Biden had won the county by more than 45,000 votes.</p>
<p>Frustration and weariness overtook Hickman’s relief.</p>
<p>“This is not going to be over for a long time,” he said to himself with a sigh.</p>
<p>Mark Finchem, the Trump-endorsed Republican running for Arizona secretary of state — which oversees the state’s elections — called for arrests and demanded that Biden’s win be decertified.</p>
<p>Trump jumped in the following day at a rally in Perry, Ga. “We won on the Arizona forensic audit,” he told thousands of screaming fans, “at a level that you wouldn’t believe.”</p>
<p>The former president said out loud the worst fears of his critics: that his obsessive focus on the past was about making it harder for him to ever lose again.</p>
<p>After predicting Republicans would win the 2022 midterms, he said there would be an “even more glorious victory in November 2024.”</p>
<p>Out in the crowd, the demonstrators echoed Trump over and over again. The Jan. 6 rioters were patriots, some said. The system is rigged. Those in power are corrupt. The country is crumbling, and elections can no longer be trusted to fix it.</p>
<p>To them, the options were dwindling.</p>
<p>“Short of bloodshed, I don’t know of any way to fix what we currently have going on,” said Wade Damms, a 47-year-old from Snowflake, Ariz., who works in construction.</p>
<p>“I’d take part in it,” he continued. “I’d just need someone else to be the leader.”</p>
