<h2> Treatment of Low Sexual Desire </h2>
<p>Physical causes of low libidos, such as changes in <a>endocrine</a> hormones, must be ruled out first. Most often, the causes of low sexual desire will not be revealed by medical or laboratory tests.</p>
<a>therapy</a>, may not only be more effective than pharmacotherapy in relieving depression, but they also do not interfere with libido, as many psychoactive drugs do.

<a>mindfulness</a> to connect bodily sensations of arousal with psychological arousal.
<div> <h3> How can low sexual desire in men be treated? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Among men, a drop in <a>testosterone</a> levels can profoundly impact sexual desire, and for some men, treatment with testosterone may help restore desire.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Does having more sex fix a low libido? </h3> </div>
<a>doesn’t matter nearly as much as the quality</a> and how it makes them feel. Intimacy should make you feel good and improve your connection with your partner; it shouldn’t feel like a chore or an obligation to endure.

<div> <div> <div> <h3> How does physical arousal affect male sexual desire? </h3> </div> <div> <div> <p>Men are more readily physiologically aroused than women, and for them, desire is tied tightly to this arousal.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> I can't get turned on. What causes men to lose interest in sex? </h3> </div>
<a>why men experience a decreased interest in sex</a> include: lack of emotional connection, repeated sexual rejection, stress, feelings of shame and guilt about their
<a>sexuality</a>, and various health issues. Low sexual desire can also be the side effect of a
<a>medication</a> or the result of a sexual problem, such as premature ejaculation or erectile dysfunction.
<div> <h3> How does sexual arousal differ between men and women? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How does pregnancy affect male libido? </h3> </div>
<a>can vary tremendously during pregnancy</a>. Some men are more aroused and want more frequent intercourse; others are turned off, especially late in the
<a>pregnancy</a>, and are fearful of hurting the fetus with sexual activity.

<a>Nicotine acts on acetylcholine receptors in the brain,</a> which help to control
<a>memory</a>. Nicotine also boosts levels of the neurotransmitter
<a>hormone</a> adrenaline. Eventually the brain becomes accustomed to these changes, so when people attempt to stop smoking, they can experience symptoms of withdrawal such as cravings, headaches, dizziness, anxiety, and irritability.
<div> <h3> How does smoking affect mental health? </h3> </div>
<a>depression</a>. Research suggests that anxiety and depression improves among people who quit smoking, and people report greater life satisfaction and an increase in positive feelings. So, not only does quitting support physical health, but it can
<a>boost mental health as well</a>.

<a>parenting</a> practices and life experiences.
<h2> What Causes Shyness? </h2>
<a>fear</a> of judgment and rejection. Shy people often make unrealistic social comparisons, pitting themselves against the most vibrant or
<a>outgoing</a> individuals. Believing that others are constantly evaluating them poorly, shy people abandon new social opportunities—which, in turn, prevents them from improving their social skills.
<div> <h3> Are people born shy? </h3> </div>
<a>people cannot be born shy.</a> Around 20 percent of children are born with a highly reactive temperament, but that doesn’t guarantee that they will be shy or unable to change their behavior.
<div> <h3> What causes shyness in children? </h3> </div>
<a>extremely sensitive temperament are more likely to go on to be shy.</a> Yet supportive, sensitive
<a>parenting</a> can buffer against developing shyness or social
<div> <h3> What causes shyness in adolescence? </h3> </div>
<a>adolescence</a>, since teens have to navigate new situations from classes to friendships to puberty. They may fear being
<a>embarrassed, rejected, or fully known.</a> Parents can encourage teens to think about how they would act if those fears were irrelevant, and then help them practice cultivating those behaviors and skills.
<div> <h3> What’s the difference between shyness and introversion? </h3> </div>
<a>introversion</a>. Introverts feel energized by time alone; shy people often want to connect with others, but don't know how or
<a>can’t tolerate the anxiety and fear of negative judgment </a>that comes with human interaction. Their inclination to turn inward to monitor their own behavior and perceived shortcomings can prevent them from developing relationships.
<div> <h3> How does shyness differ by culture? </h3> </div>
<a>Cultural styles of assigning blame and praise</a> likely contribute to these cultural differences.

<h2> How to Overcome Shyness </h2>
<p>Shy people can successfully address social challenges without altering their sense of <a>identity</a>. Researchers find that it's often best for people to acknowledge their shyness and try to release themselves from feeling self-conscious.</p>
<div> <h3> How can I stop being so shy? </h3> </div>
<a>what can go right.</a> Prepare questions for others and anecdotes you’d like to share. Reflect on what you might have in common. Being curious about others and softening your self-criticism can be helpful as well.

<a>act based on that self-awareness.</a> They recognize that small talk may not come naturally, so they plan ahead, rehearse questions and anecdotes, and arrive early to feel comfortable in the new setting.
