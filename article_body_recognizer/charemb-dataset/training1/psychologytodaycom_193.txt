<h1> Parenting During COVID-19 </h1>
<h2> A bulleted list to stick up on the fridge. </h2>
<p>My almost-6-year-old marched down the stairs a couple of days ago holding his baby doll. "My baby has coronavirus," he told me. Then he spiked the (luckily rubber) doll like a football. "So I'm gonna do that to him!"</p>
<a>all signs suggest it should</a>). "And it's all because of the stupid virus," he moped as he got dressed this morning.

<li>Point out things that are different. Birthday parties are being canceled. Mommy is working from home. (Maybe) there's no school. People aren't traveling for spring break.</li>
<li>Point out things that are the same. You're still having Honey Nut Cheerios for breakfast. You're still watching your favorite shows. We still have to brush our teeth.</li>
<li>Answer questions with factual knowledge. Then stop. If your children have questions about the virus, answer them honestly. Then stop talking. If they have follow-up questions, they'll ask. And then you can answer again.</li>
<a>anxiety</a>. It's okay to acknowledge that: "Sometimes when we are worried, we ask the same question over and over. The worry fools us into thinking that will help, but it actually doesn't."
<a>confidence</a>. This is not synonymous with knowing all of the answers. Pause. Think. Look something up. Ask a parent friend how they might respond.
<li>Move your body. Jump. Dance. Stretch. Family dance party. The mind-body connection is real. When we feel grounded in our bodies, our emotional state often improves as well. </li>

<a>attention</a> to your mental health. However, public health experts know that the effects of the pandemic have already had a major impact on people’s feelings of well-being.
<p>If you stop and think about your own inner life in recent months, you probably can remember times when you felt that you were peering out over a void, not sure what lay ahead for your own physical safety.</p>
<a>fear</a>, Reznik recruited a research team from Russia and Belarus to coordinate a rapid-response study.
<p>Before getting to the findings, try taking this test yourself so you can compare yourself to the study’s respondents. Rate yourself on each item using a 1-7 scale where 1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree.</p>
<li>I am most afraid of COVID-19.</li>
<li>It makes me uncomfortable to think about COVID-19.</li>
<li>My hands become clammy when I think about COVID-19.</li>
<li>I am afraid of losing my life because of COVID-19.</li>
<li>When watching news and stories about COVID-19 on social media, I become nervous or <a>anxious</a>.</li>
<li>I cannot sleep because I’m worrying about getting COVID-19.</li>
<li>My heart races or palpitates when I think about getting COVID-19.</li>
<a>fear of death</a> due to this invisible but very real phenomenon. Rather than try to shove these fears to the back of your consciousness, you may be able to tackle them with the ordinary coping methods you use to deal with other stressors in your life.

<p>Although narcissism is a difficult disorder to treat, therapy can help those with the condition develop their sense of self and their relationships.</p>
<div> <h4>Contents</h4> <ul> <li> Symptoms </li> <li> Causes </li> <li> <a> Treatment </a> </li> </ul> </div>
<p>Individuals with <a>narcissistic</a> <a>personality disorder</a>, according to the <a>DSM-5</a>, exhibit five or more of the following, which are present by early adulthood and across contexts:</p>
<li>A grandiose sense of self-importance</li>
<li>Preoccupation with <a>fantasies</a> of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love </li>

<li>A lack of <a>empathy</a></li>
<li><a>Envy</a> of others or the belief that one is the object of envy</li>

<p>Individuals with NPD can be easily stung by criticism or defeat and may react with disdain or anger—but social withdrawal or the false appearance of humility may also follow according to the DSM-5. </p>
<a>substance abuse</a>, mood, and
<a>anxiety</a> disorders. These may be attributable to characteristics such as impulsivity and the increased experience of
<a>shame</a> in people with NPD.
<p>The presence of narcissistic traits in <a>adolescence</a> does not necessarily imply that a person will have NPD as an adult. </p>
<div> <h3> What are the different types of narcissism? </h3> </div>
<a>aggression</a>. Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by
<a>high sensitivity</a>, negative emotions, and a need for constant recognition and reassurance. A unifying theme of
<a>all forms of narcissistic personality disorder</a> is self-enhancement, the belief that one’s thoughts and actions set them apart from others. 
<div> <h3> At what point does narcissism become a disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Which mental disorders tend to co-occur with narcissistic personality disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>depression</a>, anxiety, and
<a>self-harm</a> tend to co-occur with vulnerable narcissism,
<a>research suggests.</a> However, not everyone with narcissistic personality disorder has other conditions.
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Causes of narcissistic personality disorder are not yet well-understood, but biological and environmental factors both play a role.</p>
<a>influence the course of narcissism.</a> For example, narcissism is higher among collectivist cultures than traditional ones, and competitive environments like New York more than non-competitive environments like Iowa.
<p>In terms of parenting, focusing intensely on competition and success can breed narcissism, while warmth, affection, and expecting children to simply try their best can foster healthy development. </p>
<div> <h3> How common is narcissistic personality disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The prevalence of narcissistic personality disorder is estimated to be between 1 and 5 percent, research suggests. The disorder manifests more frequently among men and among younger people.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Has narcissism increased over time? </h3> </div>
<p>On an individual level, research shows that people are generally more narcissistic when they’re younger—in adolescence and young adulthood—and that they become less narcissistic as they get older.</p>
<div> <h3> When does narcissism develop? </h3> </div>
<p>Treatment for narcissistic personality disorder can be challenging because people with this condition have a great deal of grandiosity and defensiveness, which makes it difficult for them to acknowledge problems and vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Even though change is difficult, it’s not impossible. A key is to find a therapist who is trained to work with patients who have narcissistic personality disorder.</p>

<a>a 1938 play, Gas Light,</a> and its film adaptation. Gaslighting can occur in personal or professional relationships, and victims are targeted at the core of their being: their sense of
<a>self-worth</a>. Manipulative people who engage in gaslighting do so to attain power over their victims, either because they simply derive warped enjoyment from the act or because they wish to emotionally, physically or financially control their victim.
<div> <h3> How does gaslighting begin? </h3> </div>
<a>intimacy</a> has been established, establishes trust quickly; it’s part of
<a>a tactic known as love bombing</a>. The more quickly a victim becomes enamored, the more quickly the next phase of manipulation can begin.

<a>the volume of misinformation soon grows</a>, and the gaslighter may accuse the victim of
