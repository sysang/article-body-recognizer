<a>sexual orientation</a>. This type of bias can have harmful real-world outcomes. People may or may not be aware that they hold these biases.
<a>attention</a> to helpful biases—while keeping negative, prejudicial, or accidental biases in check—requires a delicate balance between self-protection and

<div> <h3> What causes people to be biased? </h3> </div>
<a>identity</a> and safety. However, taken to the extreme, this categorization can foster an “us-versus-them” mentality and
<a> lead to harmful prejudice</a>.
<div> <h3> What is an unconscious or implicit bias? </h3> </div>

<h2> Biases and Cognitive Errors </h2>
<div> <h3> What is actor-observer bias? </h3> </div>
<a> as a result of external and situational factors</a>. Whereas, when you are observing other people, you are more likely to perceive their actions as based on internal factors (like overall disposition). This can lead to
<a>magical thinking</a> and a lack of self-awareness.
<div> <h3> What is anchoring bias? </h3> </div>
<a> “anchor” their decision-making process</a>, even when the information is incorrect or prejudiced. This can lead to skewed judgment and poor
<a>decision-making</a>, especially when they don’t take the time to reason through their options.
<div> <div> <h3> What is attribution bias? </h3> </div> <div> <div> <p>Attribution bias occurs when someone tries to attribute reasons or motivations to the actions of others without concrete evidence to support such assumptions.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is confirmation bias? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p><a>Confirmation bias</a> refers to the brain’s tendency to search for and focus on information that supports what someone already believes, while ignoring facts that go against those beliefs, despite their relevance.</p> </div> </div>

<a> this Fundamental Attribution Error</a> when analyzing their own behavior.
<div> <h3> What is the Halo Effect? </h3> </div>
<a>first impression</a> of someone
<a> colors your overall perception of them.</a> For example, if you are struck by how beautiful someone is, you might assume they have other positive traits, like being
<a>wise</a> or smart or brave. A negative impression, on the first hand, can lead you to assume the worst about a person, resulting in a “Reverse Halo” or “
<a>Horns Effect</a>.” 
<div> <h3> What is the negativity bias? </h3> </div>
<a> This negativity bias explains</a> why we focus more on upsetting evens, and why the news seems so dire most of the time.

<div> <h3> How do you get dementia? </h3> </div>
<a>Dementia is not a diagnosis</a>—it says nothing about the underlying cause of thinking and memory impairment. Dementia can be caused by a variety of factors, including thyroid disorders, vitamin deficiencies, side effects of prescriptions,
<a>depression</a>, anxiety, infections, strokes, Parkinson’s disease, and other medical problems. In some cases, cognitive impairment may be reversible if diagnosed and treated early enough.

<div> <h3> Can dementia be cured? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>No, there is no cure for dementia. However, healthy lifestyle choices can help reduce the risk of serious cognitive impairment, and in some cases, treating the underlying cause can reverse the negative effects.</p> </div> </div>
