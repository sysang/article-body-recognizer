<div> <h3> Why does watching the news make me feel despair? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Viewing violent news events on television or social media can also cause some people with high levels of empathy to experience symptoms similar to those of secondary trauma.</p> </div> </div>

<div> <h3> How do you treat compassion fatigue? </h3> </div>
<a>counteract</a> such fatigue through regular exercise and healthy eating, a commitment to adequate rest and regular time off, and time in

<h2> Feeling Another’s Pain </h2>
<a>sapped ability to cope</a> with secondary trauma can lead to total exhaustion of one’s mental and physical state.
<div> <h3> What are the symptoms? </h3> </div>
<a>Symptoms</a> of compassion fatigue can include exhaustion, disrupted sleep,
<a>anxiety</a>, headaches, stomach upset, irritability, numbness, a decreased sense of purpose, emotional disconnection, self-contempt, and difficulties with personal relationships.
<div> <h3> What causes compassion fatigue? </h3> </div>
<a>dedicated workers</a>—people who continue to help by working extra shifts or foregoing days off, neglecting their own self-care. This can result from exposure to a single case of trauma, or from years of accumulated “emotional residue."
<div> <h3> Is compassion fatigue the same as burnout? </h3> </div>
<a>Burnout</a> is not the same as compassion fatigue. Feeling drained from everyday stressors like work and childrearing results in burnout. Compassion fatigue is the strain of feeling for another’s pain. However, the symptoms are often similar for
<div> <h3> What is psychic numbing? </h3> </div>
<a>empathetic</a> instincts while on the job, freeing up cognitive resources to find solutions to the problems in front of them rather than becoming paralyzed by the scope of need they see.

<h1> Recognizing Collective Trauma Is Step One </h1>
<h2> A Unsettling Personal Perspective </h2>
<li>Collective traumas are overwhelming terrible events that affect large groups of people, from tsunamis to ethnic cleansing. </li>
<li>Symptoms of collective trauma are myriad and emanate from involuntary responses to traumatic threats. </li>
<li>Collective trauma is not taken seriously by those with great power, leading to hopelessness, mistrust, and cynicism. </li>
<a> <div>This post is in response to <article> What Is Collective Trauma? By Danielle Render Turmaud, M.S., NCC </article> </div> </a>
<a>“What Is Collective Trauma?”</a> She laid out many basics and exemplified her points by discussing some of the societal-level effects of the collective trauma,

<a>sexual violence</a>, and other
<a>traumatic</a> experiences? My colleagues and I make this choice every day, and we do so with resiliency, compassion, and courage. Here are 5 insights into this unique group of clinicians.

<h3> 1) Many of us have experienced trauma</h3>
<a>.</a> “It may not be the exact same precipitating event, but we have the shared experience with our clients.”
<h3>2) We often use “strange” interventions</h3>
<h3>3) We never work alone</h3>
<a>pets</a> as a client’s social support system can have a strong impact upon their success in trauma treatment.

<h3>4) We’re at risk for vicarious trauma</h3>
<a>vicarious trauma</a>, a condition that’s unique to those in social services, and is defined as “negative changes in the clinician’s view of self, others, and the world resulting from repeated
<a>empathic</a> engagement with patients’ trauma-related thoughts, memories, and emotions” (Quitangon, 2019). Vicarious trauma is a serious condition, as it not only impacts therapists but also all of the clients under their care.
<p>I’m proud to be a part of this unique and brave group of clinicians. Their dedication and sacrifices are remarkable, and I write this blog as a tribute to them.</p>
