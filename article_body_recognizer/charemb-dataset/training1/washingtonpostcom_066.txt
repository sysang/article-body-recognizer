<div><div><p>Since it was first detected in southern Africa late last year, the highly contagious coronavirus variant has sparked restrictions on business activity in several countries.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Portraits from inside the wild, messy, confounding, overheating economy of 2021</p></div>
<div><p>“The mood in the market is that it’s not going to be that big a deal economically,” said Jim O’Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist for TD Securities. “The hope is it’ll be over in a month.”</p></div>
<div><p>More than 1,700 flights canceled Wednesday as airlines' problems persist.</p></div>
<div><p>Tracking U.S. covid-19 data</p></div>
<div><div><p>With omicron threatening, the hotel limited attendance to 15 to 20 percent of capacity and sent non-guests home at 11 p.m., said Adam Zembruski, program director for Hospiamo, an adviser to the Horton’s owners.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So far, four out of the hotel’s roughly 25 workers have tested positive for the coronavirus, and managers are eyeing additional restrictions if needed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s an everyday conversation. We could close the bars. We talked about that just last night,” he said earlier this week.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While the virus poses an acute problem for businesses that deal with the public, manufacturers also are crafting new strategies to keep their machines turning.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Business is good at J.V. Manufacturing, a die and component maker in Natrona Heights, Pa. As orders flooded in over the past year, the company added about 40 new employees, taking its payroll to 137 workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now the company is considering an increased push for robotics and digitization to make production less vulnerable to missing workers, she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I definitely think it’s here to stay,” she said of the virus. “It’s just about finding a way to balance it, finding what risks are worth taking and what risks aren’t worth taking.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There aren’t more people to come to help right now,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>‘Last on the rung’: Africa deals with fallout from a Made-in-the-USA supply chain crisis</p></div>
<div><div><p>Elsewhere, executives worry about a possible resurgence of global <a>supply chain bottlenecks</a> triggered by harsh coronavirus clampdowns in China, where the government maintains a “zero-covid” policy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The greatest risk to the U.S. economy is how non-U.S. governments choose to respond to it,” said Frances Donald, global chief economist and strategist for Manulife Investment Management.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The company purchased scores of masks, gloves and hand sanitizer, and spread its workers across two shifts in a bid to avoid infections. Later, it added air-quality monitors and filtration devices to meet a shifting threat.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a result, Habco went months before seeing its first worker test positive and had only a handful idled before omicron appeared. In the past few weeks, more employees tested positive as the variant ran wild in Connecticut.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re doing everything we can to protect our employees,” he said. “My concern is more what I can’t control.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Habco’s production depends upon a number of local parts suppliers. If just one or two of their workers are taken ill, it might paralyze their production of critical components, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Throughout the pandemic, Habco gave employees plenty of time to deal with family responsibilities. But as the virus appears to be evolving into a less lethal form, Montanari wonders how long that stance can be sustained.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’ve got a business to run,” he said. “I’ve got customers who need product and they don’t care about my employees’ child-care problems.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>A pandemic was raging, the economy was shaky, national divisions were deep and the president’s political foil, whom he had defeated in the election a year ago, stood accused of trying to subvert the government.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The president wasn’t Joe Biden, but Warren G. Harding. His opponent wasn’t Donald Trump, but Eugene V. Debs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And almost exactly a century ago, when Harding found himself in this position, he decided that the best way to heal the country was to grant absolution to his onetime rival.</p></div></div>
<div><p>No members of the press were allowed to witness the meeting, but according to multiple accounts, the president told Debs: “Well, I’ve heard so damned much about you, Mr. Debs, that I am now glad to meet you personally.”</p></div>

<div><div><p>Debs, 66 and in fragile health, seemed destined to die a martyr in the Atlanta prison. Enter Harding.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Karla Adam</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>William Booth</div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 10:46 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The headline-grabbing paltry sum, however, is not the whole story, and Meghan will be receiving much more from the tabloid — but for violation of her copyright rather than privacy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, wins court victory in privacy fight with British tabloid</p></div>
<div><div><p>But the court added that a “confidential sum agreed between the parties” will be paid by the tabloid’s publisher<b> </b>for copyright infringement. That secret sum could be quite high, legal observers say.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The duchess sued — and the duchess won.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Duchess of Sussex wins her legal case for copyright infringement against Associated Newspapers for articles published in The Mail on Sunday and posted on Mail Online — SEE PAGE 3,” read the statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If the case sets no legal precedent, Green said, it has “immense cultural and media significance.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Analysts said that for the payout, Meghan’s team would have sought to recoup the profits that the tabloid made from printing her letter, which violated her copyright.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>the Mail on Sunday would have had to provide “accurate financial information as to how much it made from the infringing material.”
<div><div><p>Mark Stephens, a media lawyer at the London-based Howard Kennedy firm, said that during trials, expert evidence can be sought over how much the infringing material helped boost sales, although this case did not go to trial.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But he said that a number would still be generated “forensically” or simply “dealt with by sticking a thumb in the air” and landing on a figure to which both parties agree. He guessed it would be north of $100,000.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It looks as if they weighed up their options, and then decided that an account of profits in the copyright is going to give her more money than the invasion of privacy,” Stephens said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Damages awarded in Britain<b> </b>involving high-profile figures taking on media outlets<i> — and winning —</i> vary widely, but they generally are not the eye-popping sums posted in some cases in America.</p></div></div>

<header><div><div><div><p>This article is more than 1 year old</p></div></div></div><div><div>Europe</div></div><div><h1>France moves to combat climate change by making flights more expensive</h1></div></header>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Adam Taylor</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>July 9, 2019</div></div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Adam Taylor</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>July 9, 2019</div></div></div>
<div><div><p>With a new tax announced Tuesday, France became the latest European country to take direct aim at one source of man-made carbon dioxide emissions: air travel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Transport Minister Élisabeth Borne said a news conference that an “ecotax” on flights departing from France would be introduced next year.</p></div></div>
<div><p>It would amount to between 1.50 euros ($1.70) and 18 euros ($20) per flight, Borne said, and is expected to raise more than 180 million euros. That money would then be reinvested in eco-friendly transport, such as rail networks.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Borne said this reallocation of funds could be “part of the answer to the climate challenge.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Europe’s ‘flight shame’ movement doesn’t stand a chance in the U.S.</p></div>
<div><p>In the United States, the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan supported by high-profile Democrats to move to zero emissions within 10 years, calls for the reorganization of America’s transportation network with high-speed rail.</p></div>
<div><div><p>With the tax on air travel, France joins an expanding club of European nations that have imposed taxes on flights with the aim of addressing climate change.</p></div></div>
<a>Sweden, which implemented</a> its law last year.
<div><div><p>The Dutch government is lobbying the European Union to introduce a continent-wide tax on aviation that would prevent airlines from changing their routes to avoid taxes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>France has also said it would seek further Europe-wide measures involving the air travel industry, including pushing to end tax exemptions for jet fuel.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Industry groups have argued that air travel accounts for just 2 percent of man-made carbon dioxide emissions and <a>say that taxes are not an effective solution</a> to the problem.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>However, activists say the falling cost of air travel and the slow pace of technological advances indicate the problems caused by climate change are likely to worsen unless major changes are made.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a statement <a>released Tuesday</a>, Air France said it opposed the ecotax, which it said would present an additional cost of about 60 million euros ($67 million) a year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But a tax on flights appears to be less politically dangerous for President Emmanuel Macron’s government than a previously proposed carbon tax on diesel fuel, which is used by many French automobile drivers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The carbon tax proposal led to huge protests by the “yellow vest” movement, causing millions of dollars in damage across France. The government later said it would suspend the plan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No tax is worth putting in danger the unity of the nation,” Prime Minister Édouard Philippe <a>said in December</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Good morning and welcome to the last edition of The Climate 202 in 2021! 🎉We're taking a two-week break over the holidays, and we'll be back in your inboxes on Jan. 3.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>🚨 A Washington Post investigation found that the Democratic Republic of Congo could set off a “carbon bomb.” More on that below. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>New York City lawmakers voted to ban gas appliances in new buildings</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>New York City yesterday became the largest municipality in the country to ban natural gas appliances in new buildings, overcoming opposition from fossil fuel industry interests.</p></div></div>
<a>legislation</a> that requires new buildings under seven stories to use electric appliances such as heat pumps and induction cooktops by December 2023. Taller new buildings will have until 2027 to ditch gas appliances such as furnaces and stoves.
<a>disproportionately affecting communities of color</a>.
<div><div><p>Council member Alicka Ampry-Samuel (D), the primary sponsor of the bill, said the measure would prevent scores of premature deaths from air pollution in the portions of Brooklyn that she represents. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When I got elected to office, my community was dying," Ampry-Samuel said at a rally before the council meeting. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The measure now heads to the desk of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who <a>plans to “enthusiastically” sign it</a> into law.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Industry opposition</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>The oil supermajor ExxonMobil emerged as a leading foe of the legislation. In September, the company paid for Facebook ads that urged New Yorkers to sign a petition opposing the bill, as <a>Time first reported</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The ads, which The Climate 202 accessed via <a>Facebook's Ad Library</a>, warned that the bill could force New Yorkers to give up their gas stoves and spend an additional $25,600 on new electric appliances.</p></div></div>
<a>data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration</a> showing that natural gas fueled about 40 percent of New York's electricity generation in 2019.
<div><div><p>The American Gas Association, a trade group, has also <a>campaigned against gas bans</a> in statehouses across the country, with 20 Republican-controlled state legislatures passing measures to prohibit such ordinances.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>The future of natural gas</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>2021 was a banner year for local efforts to limit fossil fuels in new construction, with efforts including:</p></div></div>
<li>The Boston City Council voted to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions in the city's large buildings by 2050.</li>
<li>Local leaders in Ithaca, N.Y., entered into an agreement with BlocPower, a Brooklyn-based start-up, to electrify all of the city's buildings, with a focus on low-income households.</li>
<li>The Denver City Council approved an ordinance that will require large office and apartment buildings to switch to electric and water heating systems by 2030.</li>
<a>Local Law 97</a>, which required
<a>buildings greater than 25,000 square feet</a> to meet stringent new energy efficiency and emissions limits.
<a>legislation</a> next year that would prohibit municipalities from issuing construction permits for any building that is not "all-electric."

<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the health-care policy debate in Washington.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Rachel Roubein</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Alexandra Ellerbeck</p></div></div><div>December 16, 2021 at 8:35 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Welcome to the last edition of The Health 202 for the year — and to our first edition with a poll. Scroll down, click on your fave quote of the year and voilà, your vote has been counted. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>📰 CDC advisers are meeting today to weigh possible limits on the Johnson Johnson vaccine, and the FDA is expected to decide whether to loosen restrictions on abortion pills. But first:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Omicron is intensifying booster urgency in long-term care facilities</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Officials are racing to administer more booster shots to nursing home residents while the omicron variant threatens a punishing wave of infections as soon as next month. </p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>“It does feel like a race against time,” said Brendan Williams, the president and CEO of the New Hampshire Health Care Association.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p>CDC Director Rochelle Walensky:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Alarm bells</div></h5></div></div>
<li>On booster shots: “While we’ve made good progress, we know we have more work to do,” said Walensky, adding her agency was working to ensure states have the resources they need to protect those in long-term care facilities.</li>
<div><div><h5><div>Shots in arms</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>But now, nursing homes are working with their regular pharmacy partners to provide booster shots to their residents. </p></div></div>
<li>Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to match facilities in need of help with a nearby pharmacy, according to an agency spokesperson.</li>
<div><div><p>In August, the federal government authorized an extra dose for the immunocompromised. In September, Pfizer got the greenlight for its booster shot. Then Moderna and Johnson Johnson followed in October. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Where to go from here</div></h5></div></div>
<div><p>Setting up the clinics takes time, particularly amid a shortage of health-care workers plaguing the industry. But officials from pharmacy associations denied workforce issues had slowed booster shot efforts to nursing homes. </p></div>
<div><ul><li>“The wheels are in motion; boosters are being administered. Expectations are that numbers will rise,” per Lisa Sanders, a spokesperson for LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit providers of aging services.</li></ul></div>

<div><div><p>B) “Joe's not a bad guy. He's a friend.” — Joe (Biden) on Joe (Manchin)</p></div></div>
<div><p>C) “I don’t think it’s hyperbole to say that the House and Senate majorities and my presidency will be determined by what happens in the next week.” — Biden at an October private meeting with House Democrats</p></div>
<div><div><p>E) “In my opinion, if you’re breathing, you can qualify.” — West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) on booster shots</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Coronavirus</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>CDC advisers will consider limiting use of Johnson Johnson vaccine</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>On tap today: The agency’s outside vaccine experts will weigh limits on the Johnson Johnson coronavirus vaccine due to rare blood clots linked to the shot, our colleagues Lena H. Sun and Laurie McGinley scoop.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h4><div>U.N. climate boss: 'We need to understand' young people's frustration</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Brady sat down with Patricia Espinosa, the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, at a U.N. satellite office in downtown D.C. yesterday.</p></div></div>
<a>reached a deal</a> intended to help reduce planet-warming emissions. The deal still leaves the Earth headed for dangerous levels of warming.
<div><div><p>Here are key excerpts from the interview:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Empowering youths</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Espinosa said that she recognizes the frustration of tens of thousands of young people, who <a>marched through the streets</a> of Glasgow last month to protest what they perceived as world leaders' inaction on global warming.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Espinosa said that leaders must empower young people to become part of efforts to shape climate policy so that they do not feel “completely helpless.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Defending the process</p></div></div>
<a>blah blah blah</a>.” She said the challenging, often messy process in which negotiators converge to hammer out a consensus on addressing climate change is imperfect but valuable.
<div><div><p>Still, Espinosa recognized that getting delegates to agree is “not an easy task,” adding that it can seem like “almost 200 realities” are competing at each conference.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Defining success</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To Espinosa, the deal represents significant, if incremental, progress.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I would define the result as a good outcome,” she said. “A good outcome that has brought us important steps forward toward achieving this 1.5-degree goal.”</p></div></div>
<a>long-overdue promise</a> to provide $100 billion in climate finance annually to poorer nations. 
<div><div><p>“The progress has not been fast enough,” Espinosa said, adding that “one of the disappointments was the question of the $100 billion that was not there.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Closing the emissions gap</p></div></div>
<div><p>Espinosa acknowledged a recent <a>Washington Post investigation</a> that revealed a giant gap between the emissions that countries report to the United Nations and the emissions that humans are actually putting into the atmosphere.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Achieving gender equity</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Espinosa is one of a relatively small number of female leaders in international climate policy. That fact was on full display when world leaders gathered for a photo at a dinner reception at a museum in Glasgow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Out of more than 120 people in the photo, less than 10 were women. One was Angela Merkel, the first female chancellor of Germany, who <a>is succeeded by Olaf Scholz</a> today after nearly 16 years in power.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>To Espinosa, the picture signaled that nations must make greater strides toward gender equity, particularly in the realm of climate diplomacy, given that women and girls are <a>often worst affected</a> by climate disasters.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If this is the picture of power in the 21st century, it's not acceptable,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What's next at COP27</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ultimately, the Glasgow Climate Pact urged nations to revisit their climate goals as soon as next year. That marks an acceleration of the typical five-year timetable for updating climate commitments under the Paris agreement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Espinosa encouraged all countries to come to COP27, next year's summit in Egypt, with tangible progress to share. Whether that will happen remains uncertain.</p></div></div>
<p>“What people will be waiting to see is, how are we going to improve?” she said. “When we get to Egypt, the citizens and the youth will be asking, 'Okay, and what did you do? After Glasgow, you promised so much. What did you do?'"</p>

<div><div><h4><div>First in The Climate 202: Russian gas threatens Europe's climate goals, report says</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>The European Union could miss its 2030 climate targets because of its reliance to imported Russian natural gas, which releases massive quantities of heat-trapping methane, according to a report shared exclusively with The Climate 202.</p></div>

<div><div><h4><div>Activists disrupted rush-hour traffic in D.C.</div></h4></div></div>
<div><p>Protesters demanding congressional action on various liberal issues, including climate change and immigration, disrupted traffic around the Capitol on Tuesday, <a>The Post’s Ellie Silverman and Dana Hedgpeth report</a>. </p></div>
<div><div><p>Activist Luke Mayhew held a sign that read “Fund Green Jobs Not War,” as others called on Congress to pass the Build Back Better Act, which includes a historic investment in clean energy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Elon Musk opposes federal electric vehicle spending</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>The chief executive of Tesla came out against provisions in the Build Back Better Act that would expand tax credits for electric vehicles, citing concerns over the federal deficit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Honestly, I would just can this whole bill. Don't pass it. That's my recommendation,” Musk said during a virtual appearance at the Wall Street Journal's CEO Council Summit.</p></div></div>
