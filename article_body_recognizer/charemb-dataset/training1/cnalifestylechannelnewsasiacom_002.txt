<h3><a>READ: Johor sultan urges Malaysia government to consider full lockdown if COVID-19 cases continue to rise</a></h3>
<p>EACH STATE ASSEMBLYMAN TO RECEIVE RM50,000 FOR COVID-19 ADVOCACY PROGRAMMES</p>
<p>"I call on all people representatives to redouble their capabilities and initiatives to fight COVID-19 in their respective constituencies for the good of the people," said Mr Hasni. </p>
<p>Mr Hasni conducting the meeting a week after <a>Johor ruler Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar</a> called for Members of Parliament and state assemblymen representing constituencies in Johor to meet and discuss how to overcome the COVID-19 situation. </p>
<p>Sultan Ibrahim said that these elected representatives "need to play a role" in curbing the pandemic and extend help to those who are affected.</p>
<p>This was despite an emergency ordinance that is in force preventing parliament and state legislative assembly sittings from being held at this time. </p>
<p>In his statement, Mr Hasni thanked all state representatives who participated in the discussion and added that talks will likely "continue in the future". </p>
<p>"In the discussion, all representatives of the people voiced their views and gave confidence to the state government in leading various efforts at the state level in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic," said Mr Hasni. </p>

<h1> Feeling down after another pandemic year? Expert advice on coping with festive season blues </h1>
<div> <p>There is a lot to unpack for a not-so-great 2021. So why should you be forced to be joyful or accept social invitations if you're not feeling up for it?</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>Another year is coming to an end and still, the same pandemic blahs seem to be on loop play. COVID-19 hasn’t gone away; in fact, we now have to contend with the new Omicron variant – and we aren’t even done with the Delta one yet.</p>
<p>But why does it feel especially down during this time of the year, like there’s no end to the year-end blues? </p>
<p>It could be pessimism layered on top of another long year of COVID-19 fatigue, said John Lim, the chief wellbeing officer of Singapore Counselling Centre. </p>
<p>December is also the time when “people reflect on the past year and set new goals for the upcoming one”, he added. </p>
<p>It might just as well be the usual blues set off by the passage of time, which can remind us of our own mortality. </p>
<p>But if the season of joy isn’t inspiring any in you, there could still be ways of looking at the bright side of things. </p>
<p>Here’s a look at some common scenarios why you might be feeling a certain way – and what you can do to have a Christmas that, while not feeling merry, might be right for you. </p>
<p>SCENARIO #1: YOU CAN’T SEEM TO MUSTER JOY FOR THE FESTIVE SEASON</p>
<p>As a result, it is common to feel low or lonely, especially if you are grieving over the loss of a loved one. Or the festive period may induce anniversary grief by reminding you of your loss during this time of the year, said Dr Lim. </p>
<p>SCENARIO #2: YOU JUST DON’T FEEL LIKE SOCIALISING WITH OTHERS</p>
<p>SCENARIO #3: THE COMBINATION OF WFH AND YEAR-END PROJECTS TO FINISH UP IS DRAINING</p>
<p>Much discussion has centred around poorer work-life balance, work-family conflicts as well as feelings of isolation, noted Lim. </p>
<p>What the expert says: One helpful practice is to learn to prioritise and be resolute in letting go of things that do not align with your goals, advised Lim. </p>
<p>Another way to let go of stress is to learn to notice and appreciate the small things in life. “When we are feeling overwhelmed or negative, look for ways to reframe the experience by finding humour or gratitude in the moment,” suggested Lim. </p>
<p>“Notice the things about the situation you appreciate, and make an effort to express that appreciation. The creation of an appreciative environment facilitates contagious, positive vibes which make this season meaningful.”</p>
<p>SCENARIO #4: WITH SO MANY CHORES TO DO, YOU DON’T HAVE TIME FOR YOURSELF</p>
<p>What the experts say: “Caving in to the expectations of others or having too high of an expectation of yourself and subjecting yourself to these stresses often lead to nothing but disgruntlement,” said Dr Lim. </p>
<p>If you have to gift shop and party plan (according to social distancing regulations, of course), Lim suggests using the time you spend queueing at the cashier or taxi stand to good use rather than feeling stressed and trapped. </p>
<p>“Use the time to clear your mind of things that you cannot currently attend to, make a gratitude list, listen to your favourite audiobook or podcast, practise mindfulness, or just take the time to catch your breath,” Lim suggested.</p>
<p>SCENARIO #5: IT'S THE END OF THE YEAR AND YOU'RE ANXIOUS YOU HAVEN’T ACCOMPLISHED MUCH</p>
<p>It is report card season when work performance reviews and New Year resolution appraisals (Did you lose weight? Did you finally master Korean?) are meted out at this time of the year. And it’s not just your own performance. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the pressure to have “Instagram-worthy” celebrations is heightened when we’re exposed to the commercialisation of the holidays as well as the depictions of “perfect” moments on social media, added Lim. </p>
<p>When you’re done with this “homework”, think about what you’d like to do moving forward. Things are volatile because of COVID-19, so big goals may have to wait for now. Instead, set smaller and more realistic goals, said Lim. </p>
<p>SCENARIO #6: 2021 WASN’T GREAT AND YOU’RE AFRAID THAT 2022 ISN’T GOING TO BE BETTER</p>
<p>Fearing that 2022 will be worse will not make it better in any way, said Dr Lim. “Sometimes, the fear itself creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. The last thing we want is a year laced with fear, founded or not."</p>

<h1> 7 places for a more relaxing South Korean holiday: Forest yoga, nature retreats, scenic hikes </h1>
<p>In partnership with Korea Tourism Organization.</p>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>Be it forest bathing in a hammock amongst ancient pine trees, or an invigorating hike at 1,000m above sea level, there is no better feeling than being in nature. </p>
<p>South Korea is home to such places. While this popular travel destination might be more known for its food, shopping and pop culture, its underrated nature-related offerings offer a good alternative.</p>
<p>Ready for the natural sights of South Korea? Bookmark these seven options to help you unplug and unwind for when you decide to make that trip.</p>
<p>1. JEONGNAMJIN CYPRESS FOREST WOODLAND</p>
<p>There is accommodation within the forest but do check for availability because of social distancing regulations. </p>
<p>2. DONGHAE MUREUNG HEALTH FOREST</p>
<p>If you’re opting for the overnight programmes, accommodation is available in the form of two-person to eight-person rooms. </p>
<p>3. NATIONAL CENTER FOR FOREST THERAPY</p>
<p>Families or groups can seek mountain villas in Juchi Village, which also has a healing garden, aqua therapy centre and health promotion centre for overnight therapy programmes. For long-term visitors, try the Munpil District. </p>
<p>4. KAMILLE FARM HERB GARDEN</p>
<p>5. ODOSAN MOUNTAIN HEALING FOREST</p>
<p>Camping is allowed at approved sites scattered around the valley floor. Otherwise, you could stay in one of the 24 rooms available at the Healing Center.</p>
<p>6. SEOGWIPO HEALING FOREST</p>
<p>There are 10 trails that cover 11km in total distance to choose from. The first trail is 1.9km long and starts at the visitor centre before connecting with the rest of the nine trails. Reservations are needed before each walk. </p>
<p>Deep in the Taebaek Mountain range, which stretches from North to South Korea, sits the Geumgangsong Ecorium. You'd never have guessed that this very location is on former royal grounds during the Joseon era and was off limits to commoners. </p>
<p>Today, the 1,800ha forest is home to nearly 80,000 pine trees as well as this forest leisure facility that consists of accommodation, an exhibition centre, forest trails and a healing centre. </p>
<p>Back at Geumgangsong Ecorium, its Re:Birth wellness programme follows a defined schedule that includes forest trail trekking, yoga, soap making and Chahun meditation, where you inhale the warm steam of tea to purify your face and body. </p>
<p>The accommodation here is varied: From two to four persons per room to large rooms that fit 10. Some rooms have skylights for you to lie down and watch the stars – perfect when the lights go off at 10pm.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> About 52,000 employees in Singapore remain unvaccinated against COVID-19: MOM </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Around 52,000 employees in Singapore remain unvaccinated, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Monday (Dec 27) after authorities announced that unvaccinated workers<a> will not be allowed to return to workplaces from Jan 15</a>.</p>
<p>Of these, about 6,700 are 60 years old and above and they are at high risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19 infection, said MOM.</p>
<p>"Only a small proportion of these employees are medically ineligible for vaccination," the ministry said in its latest advisory on COVID-19 vaccination at the workplace.</p>
<p>It added that as of Dec 19, 80 per cent of firms have attained 100 per cent vaccine coverage for their workers, and 98 per cent of the total workforce have been vaccinated. These figures do not include people who are self-employed.</p>
<p>From Jan 15 next year, only employees who are fully vaccinated, certified to be medically ineligible or have recovered from COVID-19 within 180 days, can return to the workplace.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated employees will not be allowed to return even with a negative COVID-19 test result.</p>
<p>Partially vaccinated employees can still enter their workplaces with a negative test result up to Jan 31, after which they must be fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>"We have seen the emergence of the more transmissible Omicron variant, which with the Delta variant, significantly raises the chance of contracting COVID-19 compared to a year ago.</p>
<p>"Unvaccinated employees, especially those who are older, will put immense strain on our healthcare capacity in the coming months, if they contract COVID-19," said MOM. </p>
<p>Vaccination also will be a condition for the approval or grant of new long-term passes, work passes, as well as permanent residence from Feb 1 next year. </p>
<h2>EMPLOYERS CAN TERMINATE WORKER "AS LAST RESORT"</h2>
<p>MOM said that employers should redeploy unvaccinated workers to jobs which can be done from home, with suitable remuneration.</p>
<p>They can also place them on no-pay leave "based on mutually agreeable terms".</p>
<p>As a "last resort" after exploring these options, companies can fire these workers with notice, "in accordance with the employment contract", said MOM.</p>
<p>"If termination of employment is due to employees’ inability to be at the workplace to perform their contracted work, such termination of employment would not be considered as wrongful dismissal," said the Manpower Ministry.</p>
<p>For employees who are certified to be medically ineligible for vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme, they can return to workplaces but employers should consider allowing them to work from home, if they are able to do so, MOM advised.</p>
<p>They can also be redeployed to suitable jobs which can be done from home. MOM said that pregnant employees are also strongly encouraged to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"Employers should not terminate the employment of medically eligible but unvaccinated pregnant employees and are strongly encouraged to give special consideration to their needs and concerns," said MOM.</p>
<p>They can consider letting them work from home or giving them no-pay leave until after the employee has delivered. This should not affect their right to maternity benefits.</p>

<h1> Green is the new gold: Focus on sustainability drives demand for ESG talent </h1>
<div> <p>Interest is growing in sustainability, but the sector still has a shortage of expertise. Money Mind looks at some ways to get more of such talent in the pipeline.</p> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Green entrepreneur Robin Pho is a man familiar with life pivots. Since graduating from university in 2004, he has had careers in three different fields.</p>
<p>Today, Mr Pho is the founder and CEO of Right People Renewable Energy, which helps customers make the switch from fossil fuels to clean energy.</p>
<p>The company specialises in helping communities in off-grid locations, often with challenging logistics and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The enterprise is driven by what he calls the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit.</p>
<p>This aim of making a positive impact while running a viable business is one of the fastest growing investment themes, as the world grapples with climate change and its challenges.</p>
<p>In 2020, investors put more than US$51 billion into sustainable US funds, according to financial services firm Morningstar. That’s a record amount, and double the funds invested in 2019.</p>
<p>By 2030, it is estimated that the environmental, social and governance (ESG) investment category will hit US$1 trillion.</p>
<p>"Green is definitely the new gold," said Mr Steve Stine, senior client partner at consulting firm Korn Ferry.</p>
<p>“We’ve got another 10 or 15 years of transformation happening. It is essential right now to get the best talent in place because the clock is ticking.”</p>
<p>The sound of that ticking is magnified by the mismatch between demand and supply of ESG talent.</p>
<p>Around the world, demand for ESG talent is growing across sectors. But the need is especially acute in Asia.</p>
<p>According to a recent survey by HSBC, 41 per cent of institutional investors in Asia say they are being held back from more ESG investing because of a shortage of trained staff. That is a significant increase from 26 per cent in 2020.</p>
<p>“The talent pool is not as large or well-formed as it is in the early adopting regions like the UK and Europe," said Mr Kee Joo Wong, CEO of HSBC Singapore.</p>
<p>"The other challenge we are facing is that banking is now competing with other industries for this finite talent pool.”</p>
<p>But Korn Ferry’s Mr Stine warns that the stakes are high, and laggards will lose out.</p>
<p>In June 2021, accounting firm PwC unveiled a US$12 billion plan to create 100,000 net new jobs in ESG by 2026. That is a third of its current workforce.</p>
<p>So what does it take to make the cut for such ESG jobs?</p>
<p>HSBC’s Mr Wong said a professional in this field will not only need ESG acumen, business modelling and a broad knowledge of sustainable products, but also strong soft skills such as communication.</p>
<p>"We also need people who have empathy to different perspectives. This means that banks will widen their recruitment horizons to other professional backgrounds, such as urbanists, teachers, journalists, and corporate communications.”</p>
<p>A recent CFA Institute analysis of investment professionals on LinkedIn found that less than 1 per cent had disclosed sustainability-related expertise on their profile.</p>
<p>At the same time, 6 per cent of jobs posted were seeking sustainability-related skills.</p>
<p>Universities are responding to this mismatch of supply and demand.</p>
<p>In Singapore, there are three research centres that work on green finance with an Asian focus.</p>
<p>The latest is the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute, which was established by the National University of Singapore and supported by the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p>
<p>"This means they want talent. They are asking universities and other players to nurture talent that they can hire to satisfy these requirements.”</p>
<p>A key research focus will be to measure and assess sustainability and its impact.</p>
<p>This will help companies to put a monetary value on environmental and social performance.</p>
<p>All with the common aim of building capabilities and expertise to support the future of green finance.</p>
<p>"Environmental and social and governance issues, they are here to stay," said Prof Agarwal.</p>

<li> <a> CNA Eyewitness</a> <ul> <li> Send us a news tip </li> </ul> </li>
<h1> COVID-19: Construction industry stakeholders appeal to Govt to bring in foreign workers in a ‘controlled manner’ </h1>
<div> <p>In a media release, the Construction Industry Joint Committee said tighter border measures have led to increased challenges in the built environment sector.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Kurt Ganapathy </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Stakeholders in Singapore’s construction industry on Monday (May 17) appealed to the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force to allow foreign workers to enter Singapore “in a safe and controlled manner”.</p>
<p>“However, we have serious concerns about the acute manpower situation for the construction industry.”</p>
<p>Singapore has suspended entry for long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to India since Apr 24. This includes those who transit in India.</p>
<p>Those with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have also been barred from entering or transiting in Singapore since May 2.</p>
<p>CIJC said that the shortage of manpower is leading to issues with workplace safety.</p>
<p>“The complexity and nature of construction work necessitates the deployment of workers from various trades, and the current reduced workforce is already working at maximum capacity, increasing the risks of workplace incidents,” it said.</p>
<p>“We are suffering from reduced productivity due to safe management measures at the worksites and many of our migrant workers plan to return home when their work permits expire.”</p>

<h3><a>READ: Further monitoring of COVID-19 situation needed before any decision on circuit breaker, says Ong Ye Kung</a></h3>
<p>CIJC said that existing delays to the construction of Housing and Development Board flats and private homes could be exacerbated by the closure of borders, while public infrastructure projects and maintenance works could also be affected.</p>
<p>Jobs in the industry could also be lost as a result, the committee said.</p>
<p>“The built environment sector consists of over 18,000 firms and hires tens of thousands of Singaporeans. These jobs are at stake, if there are further impacts to the sector,” CIJC said.</p>
<p>CIJC has offered to work with the Government to find a solution.</p>
<p>“We are prepared to work with the relevant agencies and stakeholders to establish a viable end-to-end system to bring in migrant workers in a safe and controlled manner so as to enable work to continue, while keeping Singaporeans safe,” it said.</p>
<p>The industry also hopes that the Government will consider additional relief measures for the built environment sector, CIJC added.</p>

<h1> How to still enjoy hearty festive meals without worrying about weight gain </h1>
<div> <p>You’re likely to add anything from 0.5kg to 1kg during the Christmas and New Year’s Eve period. How do you enjoy the festivities you deserve without piling on the calories? Experts lay out a few scenarios.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>Case in point: A typical hearty Christmas dinner can have from 800 to 1,000 calories, said dietitian Jaclyn Reutens, who is the founder of Aptima Nutrition and Sports Consultants.</p>
<p>That’s from just one get-together – and doesn’t even include the liquid calories from alcohol. </p>
<p>That’s not to say you have to trade the Christmas honey-glazed ham for plain, steamed chicken breast, or raise a glass of cranberry juice instead of champagne to the New Year.</p>
<p>That really wouldn’t be fair, especially in a year where we all need some festive cheering up – if not for the body, then for the spirit.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Christmas foods that are actually healthy for you – and they're not vegetables</a></h3>
<p>So how do you enjoy the festive moment without packing on too much calories when the feasting begins this week?</p>
<p>We asked some experts to come up with a gameplan – here’s a look at some common scenarios that you’re likely to encounter and what you can do.</p>
<p>Happy, healthy holidays!</p>
<p>SCENARIO #1: A ZOOM GATHERING WITH BYO FOOD</p>
<p>“For example, choose a smaller bag of chips over a larger one. If you have a big bag, pour out a serving and keep the rest out of sight,” he said. You can also keep the remaining portion with someone who can help you control your intake.</p>
<p>If you have the tendency to munch mindlessly during Zoom gatherings, try replacing bites of food with sips of water to reduce the calories consumed, suggested Melanie Anthonysamy, the nutrition team lead at digital health platform HealthifyMe.</p>
<p>“Add some Christmas colours and flavours by infusing your water with fruits such as apples, berries, passionfruit, lemon and mint,” she said.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> It is okay to nibble as long as you do it consciously. Allow yourself a maximum of two servings per dish. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>Drinking water is also a good idea because when you are well hydrated, your body will not mix up your hunger and thirst cues, which prevents you from overeating, she added.</p>
<p>Another way to avoid munching mindlessly is to be more engaged in the conversation, suggested Anthonysamy. “You’d realise that you don’t really have time to munch as you are spending time processing and engaging in the conversation.”</p>
<p>SCENARIO #2: COOKING AND ORDERING FOOD FOR A SMALL GATHERING</p>
<p>Festive dishes are aplenty and there’s a high chance you’ll end up with a table full of protein, fat and refined sugar if you’re not careful.</p>
<p>To get around that, you can omit the ham if you’re already serving turkey and roast beef to avoid putting out too much protein, advised Anthonysamy.</p>
<p>Wherever possible, serve unprocessed fruits and vegetables. For instance, omit fruitcake and opt for fresh fruits instead to cut down on refined sugar and fat, she said.</p>
<p>For a gathering of five, Anthonysamy suggested prepping the following:</p>
<ul><li>One small whole turkey</li> <li>10 small slices of roast beef</li> <li>A big pot of roasted vegetables</li> <li>One small log cake</li> <li>Fruits</li> </ul>
<p>Or you can substitute the above food (just don't swap out the fruits and vegetables) with these options suggested by Reutens for a party of five:</p>
<li>150g ham (or get the smallest leg or roll)</li>
<li>1 or 2 racks of ribs, depending on the number of ribs each rack has (3 ribs per person)</li>
<li>400g bread pudding (2 tablespoons of brandy sauce per person)</li>
<p>SCENARIO #3: TRYING OUT ASIAN-INSPIRED FESTIVE TREATS</p>
<p>It is the time of the year when hotels, restaurants and cafes show off their culinary creativity by dressing up traditional festive treats with Asian flavours. After all, who doesn’t love the idea of a buah keluak turkey or gula melaka log cake?</p>
<p>So, we got Reutens to provide the nutritional values of the original dishes, which can give you a rough idea of how much you’re consuming when you’re tucking into the fusion version. Here’s a look:</p>
<ul><li>Buah keluak turkey</li> </ul>

<ul><li>Char siew rack of ribs</li> </ul>

<p>Inspired by: Bubble milk tea</p>
<p>Per medium cup: 335 calories, 13.6g fat, 28g sugar, 34mg sodium</p>
<p>SCENARIO #4: YOU CAN’T HELP BUT EAT WHAT’S IN FRONT OF YOU</p>
<p>The difference: Binge eating involves compulsively eating a large amount of food in a short period, even when you’re not hungry.</p>
<p>“It is often an emotional response to some sort of stress or depression, and may be associated with guilt or disgust after the binge,” said Dr Look.</p>
<p>Over-eating, on the other hand, is “an act of mindlessness and lack of control”, like we sometimes do at a buffet, for instance.</p>
<p>It is “harmless if it only occurs infrequently”, he said. Of course, overeating can become a problem, he warned, if it’s habitual and is combined with a lack of exercise.</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> If you tend to binge, taking smaller meals more frequently could be better for you. If you don’t binge, maybe skipping meals can help to reduce your overall caloric intake. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<p>To prevent overeating and ensure a balanced meal, here’s what Anthonysamy recommends putting together for your plate that’s around 500 to 600 calories:</p>
<ul><li>1/2 piece of turkey thigh without skin</li> <li>2 or 3 thin slices of roast beef</li> <li>Half plate of roasted vegetables with few potato cubes</li> <li>A few pieces of cut fruit</li> <li>1 small piece of cake</li> </ul>
<p>SCENARIO #5: NIBBLING HERE AND THERE INSTEAD OF SITTING DOWN AT THE TABLE</p>
<p>It is okay to nibble as long as you do it consciously, said Reutens.</p>
<p>"Allow yourself a maximum of two servings per dish. Each serving is one spoon-full or ladle-full. Pick the dishes that are worth the extra calories for the second serving," she advised.</p>

<p>"Giving yourself the option to eat everything makes it less restrictive and you might end up not needing the second helping." If that doesn't curb your over-grazing, stick to five dishes, said Reutens.</p>
<p>SCENARIO #6: SKIPPING BREAKFAST AND LUNCH FOR THAT BIG DINNER</p>
<p>There are two schools of thought on this, said Dr Lan. Intermittent fasters will tell you that skipping a meal or two can let you use up your caloric stores and reduce the overall calories consumed in a day.</p>
<p>“But the downside to intermittent fasting is that it is not safe for everyone to do (for instance, diabetics on medication and people with gastritis symptoms).</p>
<p>Some people who skip meals may end up even hungrier when they finally eat, resulting in overeating and bingeing,” said Dr Lan.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are studies that have shown that eating more frequently throughout the day may decrease hunger and overall food intake, he added.</p>
<p>The best thing to do is to understand what your body does when you skip a meal, said Dr Lan.</p>
<p>“If you tend to binge, taking smaller meals more frequently could be better for you. If you don’t binge, maybe skipping meals can help to reduce your overall caloric intake.”</p>
<div> <section> <blockquote> Not sure how much alcohol (a standard drink) looks like in a glass? Practise measuring it out at home. </blockquote> </section> </div>
<li>Garden salad with chicken breast/canned tuna in water/boiled egg and a tablespoon of mixed nuts. Use herbs and lemon juice instead of a salad dressing.</li>
<li>Sweet potato with roasted vegetables and tofu</li>
<li>Banana yoghurt smoothie with vegetables such as spinach leaves</li>
<li>Chickpea salad with quinoa</li>
<li>Vegetable soup with chicken/fish/egg</li>
<li>Miso tofu soup with leafy vegetables</li>
<li>A slice of wholemeal bread with a hard-boiled egg and a side salad</li>
<p>SCENARIO #7: DRINKING A LOT OF ALCOHOL</p>
<p>They say to drink in moderation but just how much alcohol is that? Anthonysamy cited the Health Promotion Board’s guidelines of two standard drinks a day for men; for women, that’s one standard drink a day. </p>
<p>“A standard drink contains 10g of alcohol and is equivalent to a 330ml can of regular beer, half a glass (100ml) of wine, or 30ml of hard liquor.”</p>
<p>Not sure how much alcohol that looks like in a glass? Practise measuring it out at home, said Anthonysamy. “You will be better at eyeballing a glass to determine the alcohol content when you’re out drinking.”</p>
<p>Admittedly, it can be difficult to track the number of drinks you’ve had, especially if you’re drinking a variety.</p>
<p>Dr Lan recommended using apps such as DrinkControl and DrinkCoach to help you out. “These apps let you set your goal for how much you want to restrict your alcohol intake, not just for one session but over a month as well.”</p>
<p>If you can, drink a non-alcoholic drink between each serving of alcohol, suggested Dr Lan, and choose a single serving instead of a larger one (for instance, a single shot over a double shot). </p>
<p>If you’re paying for the drinks, pay as you order instead of keeping an open tab. That way, you’ll feel the pinch and are acutely aware of how much you are drinking, he said.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Providing masks, ensuring staggered break times and frequent reminders to wash hands: These are some of the measures cleaning companies in Singapore are taking to keep its workers safe amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Cleaners from Chye Thiam Maintenance are frequently reminded on how to wear masks correctly and to wash their hands thoroughly, said senior vice president of corporate development and strategy Yap Shih Chia. </p>
<p>The company services Jewel Changi Airport, which is closed to the public until Jun 13 along with the airport’s passenger terminals, following the emergence of a cluster of COVID-19 cases at the airport. </p>
<h3><a>READ: New COVID-19 cluster linked to cleaner at Changi Airport</a></h3>
<p>Protection provided to cleaners has fallen under the spotlight in recent weeks after some of them contracted COVID-19. </p>
<p>The first case detected in the Changi Airport cluster was a cleaner, an 88-year-old Singaporean man who works at Changi Airport Terminal 3.</p>
<p>Investigations by the Ministry of Health found that a cleaner who works at Park Avenue Rochester, a stay-home notice dedicated facility - may have been the source of infection of at the Jem and Westgate shopping malls in Jurong.</p>
<p>Jem and Westgate <a>are currently shut</a> in a bid to reduce COVID-19 transmission in the community. </p>
<p>There is also an active COVID-19 cluster involving six cleaners from Hong Ye Group. </p>
<p>And a 76-year-old Singaporean man employed by Clean Solutions as a cleaner at Henry Park Primary School was also found to have the disease. </p>
<p>Once Changi Airport was identified as a COVID-19 cluster, all cross-deployment to other buildings was stopped, even if it was only done on an emergency basis before this, said Chye Thiam Maintenance's Mr Yap.</p>
<p>The firm, which employs about 2,000 cleaners deployed across Singapore, sent out a circular to tell its employees not to mingle with one another, he said. </p>
<p>“For the, Jewel (team), they are not allowed to cross into any other team,” he said. "Zone managers stationed at Jewel Changi are also not allowed to return to headquarters. We are trying to isolate everybody."</p>
<p>Jewel Changi apart, Chye Thiam Maintenance's cleaners are deployed at other parts of the airport, including at the cargo handling areas, as well as at government buildings and shopping malls. </p>
<p>Mr Yap said the cleaners have been reminded to be more vigilant, with the COVID-19 positive cases at their doorstep. </p>
<p>The “key thing” is that people can contract COVID-19 anywhere, said Mr Yap.</p>
<p>“It can happen to anyone anywhere, especially (since) our cleaners are out there on the frontline,” he said.</p>
<p>The cleaners at Chye Thiam Maintenance are also told to have staggered lunch breaks and not to congregate in places. </p>
<p>“We try all we can. Since they are out there, it’s always a risk,” he said.</p>

<p>USE OF PROPER MASKS, SAFETY EQUIPMENT </p>
<p>At Cleaning Express, employees are provided with surgical masks and masks with filtration capabilities, said Mr Steven Ong, senior manager in the human resources and training department.</p>
<p>These masks have at least 95 per cent bacterial filtration efficiency, he said. </p>
<p>“When providing intensive pandemic cleaning services, they will don full personal protective equipment as per National Environment Agency guidelines,” he said.</p>
<p>Such intensive cleaning is provided at premises visited by COVID-19 cases at the request of clients, he said. The company has about 1,100 cleaners who work at malls, schools and healthcare facilities. </p>
<p>He added that recently, the firm made arrangements for hand sanitiser bottles to be attached to existing janitorial trolleys, so cleaners are able to "practise better hand hygiene more frequently, and with ease”.</p>
<p>The cleaners are also reminded to take their temperature twice a day and keep tabs on their health, said Mr Ong.</p>
<p>“We are also tracking the vaccination schedules of our cleaners and encouraging those (who have been given medical clearance) to get vaccinated,” he said.</p>
<p>Given that about 40 per cent of cleaners are above the age of 60, operations and safety teams on the ground are staying vigilant to ensure their well-being, Mr Ong added.</p>
<p>At Imperial Cleaning Service, a spokesperson said that its cleaners - who are mostly deployed at condominiums - are given staggered break and lunch times to prevent them from gathering.</p>
<p>They are also not allowed to cross over to neighbouring blocks, he said.</p>
<p>At their daily meetings, the cleaners are also reminded to wash their hands and to always keep their masks on. The cleaners are also required to dispose of their gloves and masks and use a new set after they have had their meals.</p>
<p>Given that many of the cleaners are elderly and may have trouble remembering the steps, the spokesperson said that the mixing of the chemicals to meet the authorities’ standards is left to supervisors.</p>
<p>"There's a daily chance they will meet someone with COVID-19," he said. </p>
<p>In general, cleaners need to be careful when they are clearing rubbish and in bathrooms, where people blow their noses, he said.</p>
<p>"When clearing rubbish, you are clearing a lot of tissue paper with respiratory secretion. This is where transmission can happen,” he added.</p>
<p>Other than cleaners deployed to do regular cleaning and waste management, Chye Thiam Maintenance has an 80-man team that is trained to do pandemic disinfection.</p>
<p>They are deployed when the cleaning company is engaged to disinfect places that have been visited or occupied by COVID-19 patients, or for preventive purposes.</p>
<p>To protect themselves, the team members don overalls, N95 masks, goggles and face shields, said Mr Yap. They also are trained to wear and remove their protective gear in the right order - which is an important step, Mr Yap said.</p>
<p>The company created a team for such specialised disinfection work in 2016 and has been practicing for such a situation since then, he said.</p>
<p>The team has been involved in disinfection efforts at several places, including at dormitories and hotels.</p>
<p>Mr Douglas Wang, director of A-Guard Environmental Hygiene, said that even when his company is engaged for preventive works, his team of bio-decontamination specialists treat the spaces as if they have been visited by COVID-19 positive individuals.</p>
<p>“Every time we go in, (we treat it as if) it’s 'live',” he said.</p>
<p>A-Guard Environmental Hygiene is in the business of ensuring that indoor air quality is up to mark by removing contaminants such as bacteria and fungus.</p>
<p>Such work requires the use of chemical masks, which are of the same grade as N95 masks, but come with chemical gas filtration.</p>
<p>"This is to protect the (cleaners) against the airborne bacteria, mould and chemical used in disinfection," said Mr Wang. </p>
<p>Since the start of the pandemic, they have decontaminated places linked to confirmed COVID-19 cases - places like hotels, dormitories, and homes - he said.</p>
<p>Mr Wang's teams work with a minimum of two people per team and they take about two to three hours for one project. </p>
<p>They wipe down all high-touch surfaces in accordance to NEA's guidelines; and as additional steps, use ozone and chemical misting to kill viruses in areas that may have been inaccessible such as high walls, ceilings and fabric surfaces, he said.</p>
<p>Other than chemical masks, they don chemical gloves, goggles, face shields and overalls, he added.</p>
<p>In their training, they liken the virus to acid, Mr Wang said.</p>
<p>“We tell them it’s like acid. So we remind them that they won’t touch acid with their bare hands and even if they touch, they won’t touch other parts of their body without washing it away,” he said.</p>
<p>While the cleaning companies try to keep their employees safe, Chye Thiam Maintenance's Mr Yap said safety boils down to the individual.</p>
<p>“No matter how well trained they are, I guess after a while, you get tired, uncomfortable … you might not think about, but you might take off your glove and rub your nose or something. It’s a very, very subconscious thing,” he said.</p>

<p>Never mind that most of us live in apartments. Even without a dramatic foyer or sweeping staircase, you can still stage a lovely, festive set-up that will wow family and guests alike. </p>
<p>Fresh fir and pine boughs just bring in that fresh pine fragrance, don’t they? And they look great, too, when they're used to line bookshelves or any empty space at home. Just add some fairy lights and red ribbons, and you’re set. </p>
<p>Or if you own plants that have long, trailing vines such as the heartleaf philodendron or any pothos, this is the time to let them all hang out with the aforementioned Christmassy accents. </p>
<p>As much as you love a dramatic floral arrangement on the dining table, it can take up too much space. Most families have a six-seater table and with a centrepiece taking up half the space, you wouldn't have room for the food.</p>
<p>A great compromise? Turn the pendant lamp that hangs over the table (there usually is one) into a chandelier. Hang baubles or stars at various heights from the lamp, and top them off with some foliage such as eucalyptus branches. </p>
<p>Don’t throw away those old Christmas baubles just yet. Tie baubles of various sizes together like a bunch of grapes, fill in the gaps with leaves, flowers or ribbons, and you have a versatile decoration.</p>
<p>For instance, you can tie smaller bauble bunches to the back of the dining chairs. Or pin many bunches to a wide ribbon, then run the ribbon across a surface and let it all cascade down the side. </p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Many Build-to-Order (BTO) housing projects are expected to be delayed by a year or more, as a result of tighter border measures affecting the construction sector, said Education Minister Lawrence Wong in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11).</p>
<a>longer Stay-Home Notice periods</a> for all travellers from higher-risk places, and a ban on short-term visitors and long-term pass holders with recent travel history from
<a>Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka</a>.
<p>In particular, contractors will be hit “especially hard”, and private home buyers may also face delays of varying lengths, said Mr Wong, who is also the co-chair of the multi-ministry task force dealing with COVID-19.</p>

<h3><a>READ: The Big Read: Rising prices, building delays — young couples face perfect storm in quest for home sweet home</a></h3>
<p>“Likewise companies in the marine and process sectors will be badly affected. They will find it hard to deliver their existing projects on time, and a few may even have to forgo new opportunities and projects.</p>
<p>“These are important sectors that we have taken decades to build – they hire thousands of Singaporean engineers and executives, and remain crucial sources of highly-skilled jobs,” Mr Wong said.</p>
<p>“Our big concern is that if companies continue to face difficulties or are forced to close, we could then end up with higher unemployment and job losses for Singaporeans,” he said.</p>

<p>“These are the consequences of keeping our borders tight, and I hope Members will help to explain this to your constituents when you receive appeals,” he said.</p>
<p>CONTROL OF BORDER MEASURES IS “DYNAMIC PROCESS”</p>
<p>Mr Wong also said that the control over the flow of travellers into Singapore is a “dynamic process”, based on assessments of each country’s public health situation.</p>
<p>He noted that before the pandemic, about 200,000 travellers went through Changi Airport each day. By November last year, this had plummeted to 820 arrivals a day.</p>
<p>Between December and March this year, there were about 1,200 arrivals each day.</p>
<p>The reason for this increase: Singapore was taking in more FDWs and migrant workers in the construction, marine and process (CMP) sector, he said.</p>
<p>But even so, Mr Wong said the inflow of CMP workers allowed up to now is still unable to meet Singapore’s needs.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Companies seek alternatives as workers from India, Bangladesh dwindle</a></h3>
<p>“Because every day, every week, every month, many migrant workers have left to go back to their home countries. Whatever numbers we are bringing in barely replace those who have left."</p>
<p>In the meantime, authorities will do more to assist the CMP sector which is bearing the brunt of the impact, he said. For instance, firms in this sector will receive higher foreign worker levy rebates from May to December this year.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Higher foreign worker levy rebates as COVID-19 measures tighten labour supply</a></h3>
<p>Beyond this sector and aviation and tourism-related segments, Mr Wong said there are signs of improvement in the broader economy.</p>
<p>Barring any setbacks and provided that Singapore can keep the COVID-19 situation under control, the country should be able to continue its recovery trajectory, he said.</p>
<p>But he cautioned that the outlook remains uncertain. In the meantime, authorities will monitor the situation closely, and consider how best to support those who need help to adjust, he said.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said businesses need to be more agile and start “factoring the need to pivot plans or operating models at short notice".</p>
