<p>Rest in curiosity about whether investing your guru with so much agency for having changed you have limited this awareness. Limited your embodiment of whatever <a>wisdom</a> they offered. Thank them, yes. Make them a guru, no.</p>

<h1> Holiday To Do: Stop Avoiding Difficult Conversations </h1>
<h2> Self-compassion helps you hang in when the talking is tough. </h2>
<li>Humans are neurologically wired to self-protect from pain and seek satisfaction. </li>
<li>Self-compassion helps people face the discomfort of difficult conversations.</li>
<li>Self-compassion involves bringing mindfulness to emotional pain or distress and bringing kindness and care to this pain. </li>

<p>Difficult conversations are indeed painful. The remedy starts with self-compassion.</p>
<p>There are five key reasons why we need to have and master difficult conversations:</p>
<a>smoking</a>, overeating, and even anxiety itself.
<p>Therefore, all of us deserve a heaping helping of self-compassion when it comes to avoiding, blaming, escalating, sabotaging, and all the other things humans do when the talking gets tough.</p>
<a>mindfulness</a> and self-compassion are key tools for training yourself to a higher level of conversational operation.
<p>Self-compassion involves bringing mindfulness to your emotional pain or distress, connecting to the universal nature of these pain points in many other people, and intentionally bringing a stance (and action) of kindness and care to this pain.</p>
<p>4. The higher conversational, self-compassionate habit-warriors are the knot-untiers – the bridge-builders – the compassionate rabble-rousers you and I need in workplaces and our homes.</p>
<p>5. The higher self-compassionate conversational habit-warriors are the ones who bring opportunities for healing of rifts and empowerment to others. They model and inspire possibility for others in daily life.</p>
<p>I needed self-compassion for my anxiety habits and the suffering they created to rise to a higher level as a leader. Lesson learned.</p>
<p>You need go-tools that ground, regulate, open perspective, and lean you in toward the truth behind others’ actions. And that’s just the beginning.</p>
<a>philosophy</a>, and forged mastery in martial arts by 32. He was a doer, and as a result, he learned. If you’re willing to bring self-compassion and other tools to bear, you might do the same when the talking is tough.
<p>Practice: A Simple Gesture of Self-Compassion for Difficult Conversations</p>
<p>Here’s a simple way to practice self-compassion before or after a difficult conversation, just in time for the holidays when difficult conversations seem rampant.</p>
<p>1. Call to mind a recent difficult conversation in which you may have behaved unskillfully and was painful in some way. Vividly imagine it until your body and mind are stirred with some degree of charge – of discomfort. </p>
<p>2. On a slow in-breath, bring your hands to your heart, join them loosely together, or perhaps rest your palms gently alongside your cheeks – in a way that fits for you, place your hands in a gesture of kindness and care. </p>
<p>3. On a slow out-breath, feel the warmth of your hands and notice the effect this gesture has on your experience of this moment. This is self-compassion. </p>
<p>4. Come back here again and again, particularly for easing the pain of these conversations that are yours, mine, and the case for all of us at various points in our lives.</p>
<p>This practice is a crucial step in opening yourself up and away from the tough inner reactions to a challenging conversation with someone in your personal life or at work.</p>

<h1> Declutter Your Habits Heading into the Holidays (and Beyond) </h1>
<h2> Your goals are great, but great habits are the key to getting there. </h2>
<li>Don’t fixate on long-term, lofty results you want. Focus in on immediate, specific actions.</li>
<li>Habits make your results. Goals should be mere guides.</li>
<li>Habit decluttering is a process for unblocking yourself from high-impact action in daily life.</li>
<li>Mindfulness is the universal solvent for melting your cluttering habits and building new, empowering ones.</li>
<p>You have likely set, reset, or outright dropped many habit change goals over the years. </p>
<p>Heading into this week, and into the new year just around the corner, it can be tempting to start what I call “nexting”—overthinking, anticipating, and trying to control some Grand Canyon change result into being.</p>
<p>Losing 30 pounds by summer. Going and staying vegan. Making a million dollars in a side hustle. World domination.</p>
<a>dopamine</a> drip is slow going, and when your daily contexts are filled with triggering cues toward competing, “bad” habits, and the Grand Canyon result you desire is a mirage on the horizon.
<p>David Neal and his colleagues showed in these studies that only when people self-perceive that their habits are guided by goals do these goals seem to have much impact on their performance on <a>memory</a> tasks. </p>
<p>Planning and scheduling small, daily actions in the direction of (versus fixation on) a change goal is the way of a habit change warrior. </p>
<p>Specific, small, and daily doings. </p>
<a>career</a>-blocking, or relationship-stalling habits. It is daily change effort that builds new, higher, effective habits. It is daily action that builds our character, the
<a>identity</a> radiating out to others in the world.
<h3>Hurry Up and Sit There</h3>
<p>Your “nexting” mind-habit will have you react on impulse, often unskillfully. This only reinforces and adds to your habit clutter. When feeling a strong impulse, instead:</p>
<li>Pause and close your eyes, bringing <a>attention</a> to the sensations in your body. </li>
<li>When the impulse to rush into action returns, wait a bit more, sit and notice more sensations, even thoughts showing up. </li>
<li>Listen to your body and mind and wonder whether the rush serves or takes from you.</li>

<h1> Convert the Pain of Your Bad Habits Into Possibilities </h1>
<h2> Learning from the discomfort of bad habits helps you make healthy changes. </h2>
<li>The pain of our bad habits is where the action of real change lies.</li>
<li>Your brain forms bad habits to deflect discomfort and bring pleasure. It is short-sighted and can't see your goals.</li>
<li>True habit change requires going beyond willpower and positivity to updating your brain's sense of the pay-out and costs of your habits.</li>
<p>Aspirational memes and motivational quotes and catchphrases abound online. When it comes to breaking bad habits of reaction to suffering, it can certainly feel good to get a quick dose of positivity! </p>
<a>midlife</a> status. What I rediscovered and have known professionally in my work for many years is that aspirational jolts of positivity are not enough.
<p>So, here’s my question for this week: Want suffering? If so, then continue doing the following:</p>
<li>Fixating on unrealistic stories of expectation</li>
<li>Blaming oneself or others</li>
<li>Wondering “Why me?” or “Why this?”</li>
<li>Self-medicating discomfort</li>
<li>Heaping <a>shame</a> on oneself or others</li>
<li>Saying one thing and feeling/meaning/wanting another</li>
<li>Dominating/controlling others</li>
<li>Lecturing/having to be right</li>
<p>Obviously, it’s just a short list of the many ways I—you—can play short-term “habit-defense” against discomfort and then create heaping helpings of more suffering in the long run.</p>
<h3>A Lesson From Organic Gardeners</h3>
<p>That's right, nature's fertilizer: organic garbage—composted waste and sometimes crap itself! Compost contains the best nutrients for seeds to spark to life and grow.</p>

<a>willpower</a>. Brewer's (and others') research is clear that rainbow thoughts and unicorn-horn–pointed willpower don't work well. Your
<a>motivation</a> fizzles, new habit change efforts fade. Another New Year's Eve arrives, and you re-enlist in the same positivity-willpower charade.

<h1> I Don’t Want to Be Difficult, but I Am. What Am I Missing? </h1>
<h2> Sometimes very smart people don’t play well with others. Here’s why. </h2>
<a>emotionally intelligent</a> individuals tend to do better in relationships, in the workplace, and pretty much everywhere else.
<a>intuition</a>, dismiss what we feel, and miss out on the kind of relational
<a>self-regulation</a>. Because of this, we may be more reactive, take things more personally, and judge people and situations in ways that make our lives more difficult.
<p>According to Daniel Goleman, author of <a>Emotional Intelligence</a>, a person’s emotional intelligence is more predictive of both life success and <a>happiness</a> than IQ. Goleman delineates five domains of emotional intelligence.</p>
<li>Self-Awareness. Understanding what we’re feeling and why we’re feeling it.</li>
<li>Emotional Self-<a>Management</a>. Self-managing distressing emotions so they don’t cripple us.</li>
<li><a>Motivation</a>. The ability to find and act on our internal motivation.</li>
<li><a>Empathy</a>. Understanding of what someone else is feeling and experiencing.</li>
<li>Social Skills. Using self-awareness, emotional self-management, and empathy to skillfully form healthy relationships.</li>
<a>bias</a> in our brains, where we automatically assume the worst of ourselves, others, and situations. We do this even though the vast majority of the time the worst-case scenario never comes to pass. To combat this, we must pay
<a>attention</a> to our internal thoughts so we can spot when we are being unduly negative. When we see that happening, we can think about other possible (and usually more likely) realities and outcomes.
<a>stressful</a> than the big things. One easy trick for managing stress is to splash cold water on your face, as cooler temperatures are proven to reduce
<a>Meditation</a> is another terrific stress reliever.)
<a>nonverbal communication</a>. This shows respect, prevents misunderstandings, and helps foster compromise when needed. People who are not emotionally intelligent just wait for their turn to speak.
<li>Smile. Emotionally intelligent people seem sociable, approachable, and fun. They seem upbeat, and because of this, other people want to be around them.</li>
<p>To learn more, I highly recommend Goleman’s book <a>Emotional Intelligence</a>. If you’re really struggling with emotional intelligence, <a>working with an experienced psychotherapist </a>can be helpful.</p>

<h1> How Adults with ADHD Can "Manufacture" Motivation </h1>
<h2> The issue is more than just dopamine. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is ADHD? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome ADHD</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Adults with ADHD may struggle to motivate themselves to do important but non-urgent tasks, often until forced to do so by a looming deadline.</li>
<li>Dopamine insufficiency in the ADHD brain privileges short-term payoff over long-term goals—even if the long-term goals will ultimately provide a bigger reward.</li>
<li>Breaking tasks into small parts, rewarding baby steps, externalizing motivation, and other cognitive-behavioral strategies can help create motivation where none exists.</li>
<p><a>Dopamine</a> is the neurotransmitter most linked to <a>ADHD</a>. Dopamine insufficiency in regions of the brain associated with self-control (via a suite of skills known as the executive functions) is documented in research on adult ADHD.</p>
<h3>How Dopamine Drives Motivation</h3>
<a>self-regulation</a> and well-being. The control system is the reverse thruster that balances the accelerator that chases novelty.

<h3>Why Dopamine Deficiencies Can Hurt Productivity</h3>
<a>shame</a>, and highly critical
<a>self-talk</a>—messages of the sort that would be deemed verbal assault if uttered at another person. These repeated outcomes foster creeping disengagement that looks like self-sabotaging behavior, but really reflects the
<a>procrastination</a> and avoidance all too commonly seen in adult ADHD. This disengagement can be thought of as
<a>learned helplessness</a>: “It is no use trying because I never accomplish what I want.”

<li>Valuation: Consider why a particular task is important to you. Think how your “future self” will feel when it is done.</li>
<li>Specificity: Define a task in specific terms coupled with a specific day, time, and place it will be done.</li>
<li>Externalize motivation: Use pictures, quotes, or other inspirations to reinforce your plan.</li>
<a>rationalize</a> task avoidance and develop task-oriented responses. Develop strength-based mindsets to promote follow-through, such as building endurance and recognizing which of your personal characteristics can be used.
<li>Normalize discomfort: Acknowledge that you won’t always “be in the mood” for a task but can still engage with it.</li>
<li>Initiation step: Define the smallest step that, when you do it, by definition will mean that you have started and did not procrastinate.</li>
<li>Follow through with the implementation plan: Get started, see how it goes, and review the results.</li>
<a>relapse</a> rate for procrastination is 100 percent for everyone, so each time is a chance to learn and grow.

<h1> Thinking Through Adult ADHD </h1>
<h2> Change your outlook and cope better with ADHD. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is ADHD? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome ADHD</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Attention</a>-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (
<a>ADHD</a>), they are a persistent and persuasive issue for those living with it.
<sup>1</sup> These thoughts and beliefs are odorless, tasteless, and weightless, but their influence runs the gamut — from a fixation on an idea or task,
<a>procrastination</a> despite being aware of the consequences, to blurting out the exact wrong thing at the exact wrong time, later dope-slapping one’s head and wondering “What was I thinking?”
<a>confidence</a> also have downstream effects on these goals and other matters related to coping with ADHD and fulfilling one’s potential. The next sections will review some ways thoughts have special relevance for adults with ADHD.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Sometimes all it takes for adults with ADHD to unleash their strengths is to change their mindset enough to get started on a small step!</div> <div>Source: Engin Akyurt/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Defining a task in specific, behavioral terms increases the likelihood of at least getting started on it. Even this suggestion is an actionable reframe of the common advice to break down a task into smaller steps.</p>
<a>self-efficacy</a> particularly relevant for adult ADHD is self-regulatory efficacy — the ability to navigate all the hassles, tedious nature of some tasks, and other dissuading factors in order to follow through.
<sup>2</sup> This self-regulatory efficacy issue has been proposed as the central theme of cognitions and beliefs in adults with ADHD1, namely the issue of self-
<a>mistrust</a> — “I know I’m capable of doing this — but I do not trust that I can make myself do it when I have to.”

<p>Nevertheless, task-interfering cognitions and other unhelpful thoughts run the risk of undermining plans and strengths. The next section will review these sorts of thoughts. </p>
<sup>3</sup> The cognitive strategy promoted here is taking a second look at one’s thoughts and reconsidering their relative accuracy, utility, and potential amendments to the initial interpretation of events.
<a>perfectionism</a> was the most commonly endorsed category.
<a>relapse</a> rate for procrastination and other organizational difficulties is 100%, ADHD or not. The issue is how these slip-ups are managed. Similarly, adults with ADHD will have unhelpful thoughts and the task is to catch and revise them.
<li>What is the evidence for the way I’m thinking? Is there evidence that does not support this view? Do I need more information?</li>
<li>Is there another way to view this situation that will help me handle it better? Am I engaging in any distorted thoughts?</li>
<li>If a friend of mine (especially one with ADHD) encountered this situation and described this thought, how would I advise them? (We are often more compassionate toward others than we are toward ourselves.)</li>
<li>In the grand scheme of things, how important is this situation? How will I view it in an hour? Day? Week? Year?</li>
<li>What is the worst-case scenario? What is the best-case scenario? What is the most likely scenario? Can I manage it?</li>
<li>What can I do to influence or change this situation? Can I accept it and move on?</li>
<p>Answering these questions is a form of externalization of information, which helps evaluate them in a more reasonable fashion. This can be a strategy that is used as a <a>self-help</a> plan and is a focus in CBT for adult ADHD.</p>
