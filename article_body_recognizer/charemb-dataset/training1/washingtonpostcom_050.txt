<div><div><p>LONDON — First, the glad tidings. Boris Johnson and his wife, Carrie Johnson, announced on Thursday the birth of a daughter, their second child since he became prime minister.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The mop-headed British leader previously boasted he “changed a lot of nappies,” a Britishism for diapers, so now he may change many more. The couple have a son, Wilfred, born in April 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Boris Johnson’s staff denied there was a 2020 Christmas party — except they joked about it on camera</p></div>
<p>The Electoral Commission ruled that the funds to pay for the refurbishment of the prime minister’s four-bedroom apartment at 11 Downing Street were not properly disclosed — and led to accusations by critics of Tory “sleaze.”</p>
<div><div><p>Johnson is leader not only of the government, but the Conservative Party. Carrie Johnson, nee Symonds, was a top communications official at the Conservative Party before the couple were wed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The mother, 33, gave birth to the baby at a London hospital and the prime minister’s spokeswoman said he was there, adding “both mother and daughter are doing very well.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This is a third marriage for Boris Johnson, 57, and it is believed, his seventh child.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The prime minister could use some good news. He’s engulfed in a scandal over alleged Christmas parties hosted at 10 Downing Street last year in the middle of a strict lockdown.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Johnson said there were none, but allowed for an investigation by his cabinet secretary. The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, accused him of lying and taking the British people for fools.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The sheer number of news events and scandals buffeting Johnson amused many on social media.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By William Booth</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Rachel Weiner</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 10, 2021 at 11:05 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>LONDON — The High Court ruled Friday that WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange can be extradited to the United States to face charges of violating the Espionage Act.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The 50-year-old Australian will remain in London’s Belmarsh Prison, where he has been held since April 2019 after the Ecuadoran Embassy revoked his political asylum.</p></div></div>
<p>If the British Supreme Court court declines to hear Assange’s final appeal, he could seek a stay of extradition from the European Court of Human Rights — to whose jurisdiction Britain is still subject — a substantial legal hurdle.</p>
<div><p>The story behind Julian Assange’s extradition case and legal saga</p></div>
<div><div><p>The High Court ruling on Friday brings Assange one step closer to being turned over to U.S. marshals for a flight to the United States, where he would stand trial in federal court in Northern Virginia.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. prosecutors allege that Assange helped hack into classified information and published thousands of pages of military records and diplomatic cables about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, thus putting the lives of allies in danger.</p></div>
<p>Assange’s supporters say he was acting as an investigative journalist who uncovered a trove of damning material about American actions abroad. They say the extradition and prosecution will undermine press freedoms in the United States.</p>
<div><div><p>“We will appeal this decision at the earliest possible moment,” Moris said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In January, a British judge ruled that Assange should not be extradited to the United States because he would be at high risk of suicide.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The U.S. government appealed that decision, suggesting that the psychiatrist who examined him was biased and that Assange’s mental health was not a barrier to extradition.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Assange was charged under the Trump administration with violating the Espionage Act, the first time U.S. federal prosecutors have targeted not just the source but the publisher of classified information.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Under President Biden, the Justice Department assured the British courts that Assange can be put on trial in the United States despite his mental health issues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Assange’s defense attorneys maintained that the U.S. assurances could not be trusted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Press freedom groups dismissed those distinctions as insufficient protection for journalists.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The group Reporters Without Borders also condemned the decision that Assange can be extradited, saying he would face possible life imprisonment “for publishing information in the public interest.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The group called for the U.S. government “to drop its more than decade-long case against him once and for all,” in line with its commitment to protect media freedoms.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Karla Adam</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>William Booth</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 13, 2021 at 2:50 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Long lines formed outside vaccination clinics Monday, with people waiting to get a first, second or third dose.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The prime minister’s office did not immediately offer any details about the person who died — age, vaccination status or any underlying conditions.</p></div></div>
<p>The U.K. Health Security Agency said Monday that there were 10 patients in hospitals across England, ages 18 to 85, diagnosed with the omicron variant on or before admission, with the majority having received two doses of coronavirus vaccine.</p>
<div><p>Omicron could become dominant in some European countries by next week, officials predict</p></div>
<div><div><p>Reports from South Africa suggest that the omicron variant may be milder on average than the delta variant. But even a small portion of severe cases among a huge number of infections could strain British hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Monday that hospitalizations and deaths are forecast to “dramatically increase” in the coming weeks.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No variant of covid-19 has spread this fast,” Javid said in Parliament.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Earlier, he called the growth rate “phenomenal.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Saturday, Britain reported 633 new confirmed cases of the omicron variant; on Sunday, 1,239; and on Monday, 1,576 — bringing the total count to 4,713 confirmed cases in the country, going back to Nov. 20.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Scientists suspect there are in reality tens of thousands of new but unreported infections each day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The best thing we can do is all get our boosters,” Johnson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He announced in a televised address on Sunday that Britain would try to get booster shots to everyone 18 and older by New Year’s Day, moving up an earlier deadline by a month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A tidal wave of omicron is coming,” Johnson warned. “And I’m afraid it is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On Friday, the U.K. Health Security Agency reported that two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine offered poor protection against symptomatic infection by omicron.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The good news: The health services agency said preliminary studies found that a booster jab of Pfizer would likely raise protection from omicron considerably — to between 70 and 75 percent.</p></div></div>
<a>laboratory studies</a> were carried out with blood samples from people vaccinated with the two doses of either AstraZeneca or Pfizer. The studies did not examine the response after a booster shot. That research is coming soon.
<div><div><p>Lambe said early studies by others also suggested that a booster dose of existing vaccines may be effective against omicron.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>She urged people to get a third shot.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At one vaccination clinic in Streatham, in southwest London, more than 100 people were still waiting in line as night fell — the winter sun sets here about 4 p.m. — on Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Others who tried to book appointments via the NHS website were told to try again later. The government confirmed that the site crashed at one point Monday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Johnson is facing another rough week. In addition to the coronavirus surge, he has been immersed in a scandal about several alleged Christmas parties at Downing Street during a strick lockdown last year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Normally, rapid coronavirus tests can be ordered at no charge on a government website. But on Monday, the government website read: “Sorry, there are no more home test kits available right now.”</p></div></div>

<header><div/><div><div><a>Europe</a></div></div><div><h1>Boris Johnson sees record rebellion from his own Conservative Party on covid policies</h1></div></header>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By William Booth</div> and </span></div><div><span><div>Karla Adam</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 14, 2021 at 4:03 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By William Booth</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Karla Adam</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 14, 2021 at 4:03 p.m. EST</div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> test before they can enter large, crowded gatherings, both indoors and out — like some company Christmas parties and sports events.
<div><div><p>In a vote on <a>“covid passes,”</a> 99 Conservative lawmakers voted against Johnson’s measure, even more than the 70 to 80 who had earlier pledged to rebel. Another 17 Conservative lawmakers abstained.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>People in British political circles have begun to speculate about whether, perhaps, <a>Johnson might be replaced</a> in the new year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Conservative backbenchers say they are tired of his restrictions, zigzags and mixed messaging on the virus, and remember well how the government last year essentially “canceled” Christmas at the last minute.</p></div></div>
<p>Many in his party have grumbled that they don’t trust Johnson, who is at a low in public opinion polls these days, amid outcry about <a>Christmas parties</a> that may or may not have happened at Downing Street during lockdown last year.</p>
<div><p>Boris Johnson’s staff denied there was a 2020 Christmas party — except they joked about it on camera</p></div>
<div><div><p>Those from the libertarian wing of the Tories, as the Conservatives are called, say Johnson’s call for masks and passes smacks of nanny-state overreach and represents only the beginning of more intrusive measures to come.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Conservative lawmaker Marcus Fysh insisted to BBC Radio that “we are not a ‘papers, please!’ society,” riffing off the cinematic cliche of a German soldier in World War II asking for documents at a checkpoint.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“This is not Nazi Germany,” Fysh said.</p></div></div>
<p>In a surreal scene in the House of Commons on Tuesday, opposition Labour Party lawmaker Wes Streeting stood to defend the government and declare, “We are not living in the 1930s, and the secretary of state and his team are not Nazis.”</p>
<div><div><p>The new rules apply only to England. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales set their own guidelines.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Previously, the largest revolt since the election was in December 2020, when 55 Tory lawmakers opposed (and 16 abstained) a multi-tier system of covid restrictions for England.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That vote was angry and full of shouting. Tuesday’s proceedings were much more calm.</p></div></div>
<p>In addition to compulsory mask-wearing and covid passes, the government wants mandatory coronavirus vaccinations for staff of the National Health Service. That would be in line with existing requirements that nursing home workers get the jabs.</p>
<div><p>During the afternoon debate in Parliament, Conservative lawmakers criticized modeling that forecast an explosive number of new cases and hospitalizations as “hysterical,” “lurid” and “severely flawed.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Health Secretary Sajid Javid agreed that some epidemiologists had been wrong in the past when they predicted skyrocketing deaths.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“But if some models are flawed, it doesn’t mean all are,” Javid told the chamber.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Other Tories wondered aloud why the government was going to all the trouble, as new research from South Africa suggested the omicron variant was more transmissible but caused less severe illness.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That’s maybe a good thing, lawmakers suggested, for achieving “herd immunity” or using omicron “to get rid of delta,” the currently dominant variant in Britain and around the world.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>There was a lot of speechmaking about freedom, mirroring previous debates in the United States, and paeans to the importance of keeping the pubs open during the holiday season.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Some Tories charged that Johnson’s government was needlessly panicking. Others wondered aloud if the new restrictions were a tactic to distract voters from controversy about parties at Downing Street during lockdown last year.</p></div>
<div><div><p>While the lawmakers were debating the new restrictions for England, the Scottish government on Tuesday urged people to limit socializing to no more than two other households at a time.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Omicron is unlikely to be the coronavirus’s last variant of concern, World Health Organization officials said Thursday, noting the virus will continue to mutate as it circulates.</p></div></div>
<p>Speaking during a news briefing, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said there is “still a lot of energy in this virus.” When the delta variant emerged, he said, some scientists wondered how it could adapt further when it had become so fit.</p>
<div><div><p>“And yet, we’ve seen a further variant emerge that is even more transmissible than delta, which was itself more transmissible than previous variants,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging-disease and zoonosis unit, said the question is what kinds of mutations happen in the future — and what their effect on the severity of the virus will be.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“There is no inevitability that the next variant will be less severe or more severe,” she said. “We just have to see what happens as this virus evolves.”</p></div></div>

<p>More than 4,000 children were hospitalized with covid-19 across the nation Wednesday, Washington Post figures show, marking a new high that towers above previous peaks set during the summer when the delta variant was driving up infections.</p>
<div><p>The tally, which includes confirmed as well as suspected pediatric covid-19 patients, reflects a steep rise in infections in that group. Less than two weeks ago, on Christmas, fewer than 2,000 children were in hospitals with covid. </p></div>
<div><div><p>The seven-day average of pediatric hospitalizations was slightly lower at 3,713. Hospitalizations of adults are also rising rapidly.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Overall, patients who have been more recently infected appear less likely to be hospitalized or put in intensive care, according to preliminary studies.</p></div></div>

<p>The world is watching Britain’s experience to help answer whether omicron is indeed less severe than delta, or whether that observation in South Africa had to do with immunity levels, the average age of people infected and other factors.</p>
<div><div><p>British modelers say hospitalizations could peak here at 3,000 to 10,000 a day in coming weeks, up from the 900 daily admissions now. Deaths could climb to 600 to 6,000 a day, compared with the 100 or so on average now.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the midst of the holiday season, the government advisers said, large indoor gatherings pose a high risk of seeding “multiple spreading events.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So there was surprise in some circles that Monday’s cabinet meeting concluded without any new policy announcements.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Meanwhile, Johnson finds himself at the center of a continuing scandal, having to defend himself and his staff against allegations that they flouted lockdown rules on multiple occasions last year.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The Guardian reported that the outdoor affair took place on May 15, 2020, when gatherings of more than two people were banned in outdoor public places.</p></div></div>
<div><p>A spokesman for Downing Street said that no lockdown rules were broken, that the garden was a private and not a public space, and that this was not a party but a “work meeting” that was deemed “essential.”</p></div>
<div><p>The leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer, called Raab’s claim “a stretch” and reminded the country that in May 2020 many people who followed the rules were unable to attend funerals of loved ones.</p></div>

<div><div><p>Also during the weekend, London Mayor Sadiq Khan declared an emergency based on projections that so many essential workers will become infected and need to isolate that health and security services could be threatened.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The Natural History Museum in London announced that it was temporarily shutting down because of staff shortages caused by infections and isolation rules. Up north, ScotRail canceled 118 trains on Monday morning because of illness.</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By William Booth</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 22, 2021 at 4:54 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>LONDON — Researchers looking at real-world coronavirus cases in Britain reported Wednesday that the omicron variant of the coronavirus appears to be less severe than the once-dominant delta strain.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Early evidence from Scotland and England suggests that omicron is sending fewer people to the hospital.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This is a qualified good-news story,” said Jim McMenamin, national covid-19 incident director at Public Health Scotland and one of the co-authors of the Scottish study.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Experts remain worried that a sudden, massive surge of a highly infectious but less virulent omicron variant could still flood hospitals with very sick patients.</p></div></div>
<a>coronavirus</a> cases reported in Britain exceeded 100,000 on Wednesday for the first time in the pandemic. But the United Kingdom is also furiously giving people their third dose or booster jab — administering almost a million shots on Tuesday.
<div><div><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said his government is watching the data but would not call for stricter measures to fight the spread until after Christmas at the earliest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The researchers estimated the potential for reinfection is 10 times more likely with omicron than with delta.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The numbers they were working with were small but statistically significant, they said — if omicron acted the same as delta, they would expect 47 people to have been admitted to hospital so far. Currently, there are only 15.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The scientists said there were not enough omicron infections and hospitalizations among those over 60 years to reach confident conclusions, but they expected the overall trend would hold.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The evidence that omicron was causing less severe illness in England came out of <a>Imperial College London</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Ferguson also urged caution.</p></div></div>
<p>Ferguson stressed that given the high transmissibility of the omicron variant, “there remains the potential for health services to face increasing demand if omicron cases continue to grow at the rate that has been seen in recent weeks.”</p>
<div><div><p>British scientists not involved in the two studies expressed relief that omicron was not worse — and very likely less bad — than delta.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Raghib Ali, a clinical research associate and epidemiologist at the University of Cambridge, called the reports “encouraging.”</p></div></div>
<a>passed the peak</a> of new omicron cases. Judging by preliminary evidence, he expected “every other country, or almost every other, to follow the same trajectory.”
<div><div><p>South Africa, though, has a younger average age than countries in Europe or the United States, and it was not in the middle of a delta surge when omicron arrived.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By William Booth</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 2, 2022 at 5:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>An over-the-top Victorian novel, or a BBC costume drama, loosely based upon it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The literary trove virtually disappeared from sight. For most of a century, it went dark.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then it went on sale. And Brontë fans were aghast. And the nation rallied.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Who saved this material, the rarest of the rare, from auction to private collectors?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What do Brontë scholars say?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like lifting a lid in King Tut’s tomb, dear reader.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“It is especially amazing … as myths have been woven around the material over the decades. Did it really survive, or has it been lost or even destroyed?” said Kathryn Sutherland, a professor at Oxford University.</p></div>
<a>Brontë Parsonage Museum</a>.
<div><div><p>She said, “It’s just sticky with the presence of the writer.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>You’re seeing what?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“You’re seeing, I think, their minds at work,” Sutherland said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘Brontë mania’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Google “Brontë” alongside “mania.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Many hits</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>In the Atlantic</a>, Judith Shulevitz observed, “I see no reason not to consider the Brontë cult a religion.” The sisters, she wrote, “turned domestic constraints into grist for brilliant books.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The sisters are celebrated for their writing — totally — for the creation of the three-dimensional Jane and Catherine and the Byronic bad boys Mr. Rochester and Heathcliff.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But what made them celebrities is their narrative, and these newly emerged papers may open new windows into those lives.</p></div></div>
<a>little books</a>.” Their juvenilia — faux magazines, one-act plays and short stories about fantasy worlds and the imagined lives of Branwell’s toy soldiers.
<div><div><p>In adulthood, they toiled away as governesses. Only Charlotte later wedded. They wrote poems and hid them from each other.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And one by one, they died young: Anne at 29, Emily at 30, the eldest Charlotte at 38.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In their abbreviated lives, shortened by tuberculosis, they created three classics of English literature, rebooted year after year into movies and serial TV dramas.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Two of the sisters never had a taste of their fame.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Victorian collectors</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>William Law had a discerning and very focused eye — he snapped up a Shakespeare First Folio — but appears to have been especially keen for Brontë material, traveling to Haworth to buy stuff from the neighbors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He acquired some of the best material from the dealer who bought directly from Charlotte’s widower.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This straight-line provenance — that the manuscripts and letters passed through so few hands — increases not only their value and wow factor, but their preservation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The material is in remarkable condition,” Heaton said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Alfred’s heirs knew they had something special, but they requested privacy, and the trove has been mostly unseen for more than 80 years.</p></div></div>
<p>The Brontë material includes: 25 letters by Charlotte and seven of her famous “little books,” a manuscript collection of Anne’s poems, and diary notes shared and written by Emily and Anne, on their respective birthdays.</p>
<div><div><p>The jewel in the crown is an ordinary ruled notebook, the kind a student would buy in a stationery shop, that contains 31 poems by Emily.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The poems are all known. But here they are each written out in Emily’s own handwriting, and the remarkable thing about the manuscript is that Emily also appears to have penned edits of her poems — and so perhaps did Charlotte.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Emily’s cross-outs appear in ink. Charlotte may have annotated the works in pencil, scholars suspect. More will be known as the cache is pored over by the experts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At the end of the manuscript are the words: “never was better stuff penned.” Pride of authorship? Or a sister’s loving blurb?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It reportedly only sold two copies.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Rebecca Yorke, the interim director of the <a>Brontë Parsonage Museum</a>, recalled going into the vaults at Sotheby’s on Bond Street in London to look at the collection.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was really quite moving,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Emily’s poems were penned “in a student’s best handwriting.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“But then to see the edits … ” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It is the most magical thing,” Heaton said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘Cultural DNA’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sotheby’s in May announced its intention to auction off the material in three tranches this summer. Sold to the highest bidder. The sale was expected to be an event.</p></div></div>
<a>decried </a>“the very real possibility that this immensely significant collection will be dispersed and disappear into private collections across the globe” and
<a>condemned </a>“the narrow commercialisation and privatisation of heritage.”
<div><div><p>The Friends of the National Libraries, whose patron is Prince Charles, stepped in and persuaded Sotheby’s and the sellers to hit pause and give the charity time to raise funds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Blavatnik <a>contributed $10 million</a>, which Friends of the National Libraries on its website <a>called </a>“the largest ever given to the UK by an individual for a literary treasure.”</p></div></div>
<p>Prince Charles, in a statement, said the library was saved for Britain. “Our literary heritage is our cultural DNA and this preserves it for students, teachers, academics and ordinary readers in perpetuity,” the Prince of Wales said.</p>
<div><div><p>The materials will be given to research libraries in England and Scotland as well as Jane Austen’s House, the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum, Abbotsford: The Home of Walter Scott and the Brontë Parsonage Museum.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The last time anyone reported seeing 7-year-old Harmony Montgomery was Oct. 1, 2019 — more than two years before police say they learned she had disappeared from a home in southern New Hampshire.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Manchester is offering a $2,500 reward for information leading to Harmony’s recovery, and police are accepting tips at 603-203-6060. Local business executives are offering an additional $10,000 reward.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Police over the weekend visited a home on the city’s west side, where Aldenberg said Harmony was once seen. The current homeowner is unrelated to the case, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Sorey often seemed worried about her daughter and frequently said she could not reach her, Miller said. He said he and his husband recently made their own effort to reach Harmony’s father through social media but did not hear back.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Miller said his family had not given up on reuniting Jamison and his sister.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We even still get Christmas gifts for her and stuff,” Miller said. “We’re holding on to the ones that we have right now because it’s that important for us to have that relationship.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>A 3-year-old disappeared from a playground a week ago. She’s still missing.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Manchester police have discussed the case with the FBI, which is not investigating, Aldenberg said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the division for children and families, declined to answer questions about the case.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Harmony is described as White, about 4 feet tall and 50 pounds, with blond hair, blue eyes and glasses. She is blind in her right eye.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Although more than two years has passed since Harmony disappeared, Aldenberg said, his department is operating under the assumption that she is alive.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“I’m in rescue mode right now. This is not a recovery,” he said Monday. “All efforts are focused on that Harmony is alive, and we are going to do everything that we can to find her in that condition.”</p></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div>By William Booth</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Shayna Jacobs</div></span></div></span></div><div>January 3, 2022|Updated January 4, 2022 at 1:15 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>American Virginia Roberts Giuffre says she was trafficked by Epstein to Andrew, and she is suing the British royal for allegedly having sex with her without consent on three occasions, starting when she was 17.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Andrew denies the accusations, and his lawyers are seeking to get the suit thrown out.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan pressed Brettler on the language in the agreement and ended the conference by saying he would have a decision on the matter “soon.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The document does not mention Andrew or other potential defendants by name.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, has called the 2009 agreement “irrelevant.”</p></div></div>
<p>Andrew’s legal team also has sought to undermine Giuffre’s credibility, pointing to inconsistencies in her account. She has asserted that any conflicts in her story are a product of trying to recall traumatic events from years earlier.</p>
<div><div><p>Andrew’s memory of events, too, has come under scrutiny.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In a <a>televised interview</a> from Buckingham Palace with the BBC in 2019, Andrew said he had “no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever,” when asked about Giuffre.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The prince could not explain how a <a>photograph</a> of him, grinning, with his arm around Giuffre’s waist, was taken.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I have absolutely no memory of that photograph ever being taken,” the prince said in the interview, suggesting that the image was somehow altered.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the background of the photo is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, who was <a>found guilty</a> last week of sex-trafficking charges in federal court in New York.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maxwell, 60, was accused of recruiting teenage girls to give sexual massages to Epstein at his homes in Palm Beach, Fla., New York, New Mexico and elsewhere between 1994 and 2004.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Maxwell faces up to 65 years in U.S. prison. No sentencing date has been set.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>After his <a>disastrous interview</a> with the BBC about his relationship with Epstein, the prince withdrew from his public duties representing the monarch.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Epstein died in 2019 while in a federal detention center in New York City where he was awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By William Booth</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 1:38 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>LONDON — Early evidence suggests the British capital may be past the worst of the highly transmissible omicron variant, beginning to move beyond a peak that was lower than some models predicted and has remained manageable for hospitals.</p>
<a>official tallies</a>. While admissions were growing by as much as 15 percent a day in late December, they dropped to 5 percent increases over the New Year’s weekend, and are now growing at just 1 and 2 percent.
<div><div><p>That data comes from Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, the umbrella organization for the National Health Service trusts in England and Wales that run 90 percent of the hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For the moment, we can probably say London appears to be over the worst,” Hopson told ITV’s “Good Morning Britain” on Tuesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Britain as a whole is still in the thick of it. Cases are still surging outside the capital, where the wave appears to lag two to 10 days behind London.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The United Kingdom is in the midst of the fastest growth in covid cases that we’ve ever known,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said at a news conference Tuesday, urging continued caution.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the peak in Britain and in the United States shouldn’t be far off, health officials say, and the pattern in London suggests that, as in South Africa, it should move through faster than in previous waves.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We have a chance to ride out this omicron wave” without further restrictions or lockdowns, said Johnson, who for weeks has resisted calls for stricter measures.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hopson wrote in a long <a>Twitter feed</a> Monday that “London hospitalization data remain very important as they went into this omicron peak first and will therefore emerge first.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He noted the potential for case numbers to rise again, as the effect of New Year’s celebrations and school returns are felt. But he called the slowdown in London admission rates “encouraging.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Patrick Vallance, the nation’s chief scientific officer, was more hesitant to say that London was over the worst.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He noted that case numbers may be dropping for teens and younger adults but that the older population in London is still seeing rising infections — and that is the group most likely to get seriously sick.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>British health officials are in agreement that so far the omicron variant appears to be resulting in less-severe illness, bolstering previous reports from South Africa.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Vallance said the variant itself may cause less-serious illness, while vaccine doses improve protection.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are not seeing a surge in mortality,” Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical officer, said Tuesday. He said booster shots are offering 88 percent protection against hospitalization.</p></div></div>
<a>critical incidents</a>,” declared when health officials fear they cannot provide crucial services because of severe personnel shortfalls, spurred by doctors and nurses isolating at home because they themselves are infected.
<a>cautiously optimistic</a>” that new infections have peaked in London among those age 18 to 50. He expected rates to begin to fall next week.
<div><div><p>Ferguson and others have cautioned that the number of new infections may be undercounts because the British government has struggled to keep up with demands for testing kits.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hopson said it was “striking” that when NHS hospital administrators were asked what they were most worried about a month ago, when omicron first appeared in Britain, they said a wave of elderly patients.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Hopson tweeted: “London should be able to cope this week. But we need to recognize that ‘coping’ underplays the degree of pressure trusts and their front-line staff are under.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Former Biden advisers call for ‘new’ covid strategy</h1></div>
<h2>They suggest an approach based on a ‘new normal of life with covid,’ rather than continuing efforts to eradicate the virus</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Dan Diamond</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Yesterday at 3:03 p.m. EST|Updated yesterday at 4:20 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Six former health advisers to President Biden’s transition team released a series of journal articles on Thursday calling for a “new normal” in the nation’s approach to fighting the coronavirus and other viral threats.</p>
<div><div>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</div></div>
<p>Rather than continuing in “a perpetual state of emergency,” he and the others argue, the United States must shift to a strategy of seeking to live with the virus by suppressing its peaks, rather than attempting to eliminate it.</p>
<b> </b>comes amid experts’ growing realization that neither vaccinations nor infections appear to confer lasting immunity against the coronavirus. Some also express frustration the White House has squandered opportunities to contain the virus
<div><p>Omicron outbreak inducing whiplash for many Americans</p></div>
<div><p>“Two years into the pandemic, the U.S. is still heavily reliant on data from Israel and the U.K. for assessing the effectiveness and durability of COVID-19 vaccines and rate of vaccine breakthrough infections,” they write.</p></div>
<a>pressed</a> the White House to more aggressively help to vaccinate the world, saying that too little has been done to tamp down the risk of virus variants emerging abroad.

<div><div><p>The headline-grabbing paltry sum, however, is not the whole story, and Meghan will be receiving much more from the tabloid — but for violation of her copyright rather than privacy.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, wins court victory in privacy fight with British tabloid</p></div>
<div><div><p>But the court added that a “confidential sum agreed between the parties” will be paid by the tabloid’s publisher<b> </b>for copyright infringement. That secret sum could be quite high, legal observers say.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The duchess sued — and the duchess won.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The Duchess of Sussex wins her legal case for copyright infringement against Associated Newspapers for articles published in The Mail on Sunday and posted on Mail Online — SEE PAGE 3,” read the statement.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If the case sets no legal precedent, Green said, it has “immense cultural and media significance.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Analysts said that for the payout, Meghan’s team would have sought to recoup the profits that the tabloid made from printing her letter, which violated her copyright.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>the Mail on Sunday would have had to provide “accurate financial information as to how much it made from the infringing material.”
<div><div><p>Mark Stephens, a media lawyer at the London-based Howard Kennedy firm, said that during trials, expert evidence can be sought over how much the infringing material helped boost sales, although this case did not go to trial.</p></div></div>
<div><p>But he said that a number would still be generated “forensically” or simply “dealt with by sticking a thumb in the air” and landing on a figure to which both parties agree. He guessed it would be north of $100,000.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“It looks as if they weighed up their options, and then decided that an account of profits in the copyright is going to give her more money than the invasion of privacy,” Stephens said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The number of Americans hospitalized with covid-19 reached more than 126,000 this week — the highest level in a year. But this wave of the pandemic looks different from what came before, with dueling variants on the move.</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Los Angeles, where the fast-spreading omicron variant reigns, roughly two-thirds of covid patients in the county’s public hospitals were initially admitted for other causes, officials said Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at CoxHealth in Springfield, Mo., where officials say the older delta variant remains a ferocious threat, the <a>coronavirus</a> remains the immediate cause for 81 percent of covid hospitalizations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are planning on a pretty scary scenario: volumes increasing and being short-staffed,” said Steve Edwards, the hospital’s CEO, warning that omicron could soon arrive and sicken his workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most hospitalized patients are adults, the number of pediatric covid inpatients has doubled since Christmas to a seven-day average of 3,800 children.</p></div></div>
<a>Minnesota</a> and Wisconsin begging residents to get vaccinated, wear masks and take other precautions to avoid contracting covid.
<div><div><p>“We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before. And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated,” <a>read</a> one ad sponsored by Cleveland-area health systems last month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were coping with our delta surge, and omicron spread like wildfire,” said Keith Armitage, an infectious-disease doctor at University Hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Armitage said there were 486 covid patients in his hospital Wednesday, which he said represented “three buckets” of roughly equal size.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“First … patients admitted primarily due to an illness, covid-19,” Armitage said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that patients are showing up at hospitals with other ailments and injuries only to test positive later for covid is another indicator that omicron causes less serious illness, especially in people who are vaccinated, experts say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Given “how crowded the ER is, and how full the hospital beds are … the short-term concern on the health-care system is highly justified,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A changing picture</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Am I worried about those? Not really,” she said. “It does make me wonder how many incidental cases we had of delta, and I don’t think we were really focused on that back then.”</p></div></div>
<p>As evidence has mounted that many people infected with omicron were initially hospitalized for other reasons, critics have argued that health-care leaders and federal officials have obfuscated why hospitalization numbers have risen in recent weeks.</p>
<div><div><p>More than a dozen hospital leaders who spoke to The Post said much of the scrutiny over why covid patients are being hospitalized is misplaced.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>John Rimmer, CarePoint’s chief medical officer and emergency department director, adding that the virus may have worsened a preexisting medical condition such as asthma or diabetes, leading to patients’ hospitalization.
<div><div><h3><div>‘Finite resources’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The surging number of cases has collided with a separate trend: a worsening hospital <a>staffing crunch</a> that is exhausting workers, fueling rising staff turnover and leading to delays in care.</p></div></div>
<a>permanent workplace safety standards</a> to protect health workers from covid, saying that some staff members have quit because they feel at risk.
<div><div><p>In Vermont, where 52 percent of hospitals reported a critical staffing shortage, the problem stemmed from a “crisis of rural health equity” that predated covid, one researcher said.</p></div></div>
<a>Anne N. Sosin</a>, a health policy researcher at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
<div><div><p>Sosin said Vermont’s hospitals had persistently struggled to recruit specialists and other staff, and she was concerned that workers who quit during the pandemic could not be easily replaced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When we lose health-care workers from our rural region, it’s not clear that we’ll be able to fill those positions again,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But in Rhode Island — which reported the nation’s worst staffing shortage — health workers characterized the shortfalls as unprecedented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never seen this before, in the five years I’ve worked here,” said Brooke Huminski, a clinical social worker at Butler Hospital in Providence, R.I.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s created a problem — now the doctors need to pick up more of the work, which is interfering with patient flow … and of course, raising my own stress levels a bit,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a weird time to be worrying about him and also trying to function,” Huminski said.</p></div></div>

<h1>A sprawling investigation: What we know so far about the Capitol riot suspects</h1>

<b> </b>for continuing to warn that Trump’s rhetoric led to violence, and some GOP lawmakers
<a>have echoed</a> the former president in attempting to minimize the destruction that day.
<p>In fact, the ongoing criminal probe has swept up at least 411 suspects in what federal officials have called an unprecedented domestic attack on a branch of the U.S. government.</p>
<a>their first guilty plea and cooperation deal</a>, charged about
<b> </b>75 people with assaulting police and filed conspiracy charges against members of two far-right extremist groups. Those charged publicly so far with federal crimes hail from 259
<p>Yet even as prosecutors build cases alleging prior planning and coordination, the majority of those facing criminal charges were not known members of self-styled militias or other organized extremist groups, the filings show.</p>
<div><div><section><div><h3>How they have been charged</h3></div></section></div></div>
<p>The Jan. 6 riot has produced one of the most sprawling and complex investigations in the FBI’s history. In scale and scope, officials have said, only the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks is comparable.</p>
<b> </b>of the charges filed are potential felonies, and slightly more than half of the people charged face at least one felony.
<h4>Potential felony charges filed so far</h4>
<p>[<a>Hundreds of people stormed the Capitol. Most won’t face hefty prison terms, legal experts say.</a>]</p>
<p>As the charged cases proceed through the courts, the prosecutors will have to spell out how much of their evidence points to planning by some of the attackers, how much was spontaneous and what remains uncertain about the origins of the riot.</p>
<div><div><section><div><h3>Ties to political or extremist groups</h3></div></section></div></div>
<p>More than 50 people charged in connection to the Capitol riot have known affiliations with a political or extremist group, according to court records, and they account for nearly all the <a>conspiracy charges</a> brought so far by prosecutors.</p>
<p>The two far-right organizations that have come under the most scrutiny from the FBI for their alleged roles in the assault on Congress are the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys.</p>

<div><div><section><div><h3>Suspects with government and military backgrounds</h3></div></section></div></div>
<a>military backgrounds</a>. Of those, four are currently serving in a part-time capacity in the National Guard or Army Reserve. On Thursday, federal prosecutors
<a>charged </a>a Marine Corps officer with five counts, including assaulting and obstructing police during a civil disorder — the first known active-duty service member charged in the case.
<p>At least 17 of those charged were current or former members of law enforcement, including two former New York City police officers and two current officers from Rocky Mount, Va.</p>
<div><div><section><div><h3>A fraction remain detained</h3></div></section></div></div>
<p>At least 53<b> </b>defendants are currently detained — about 13 percent of the total who have been charged in federal court and nearly one-quarter of the 230 who face felony charges.</p>
<p>For example, about half of Jan. 6 defendants charged with assaulting police remain held, about 30 of 75.</p>
<p>About a dozen are alleged members or associates of extremist groups such as the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>All defendants jailed pending trial are men except for one transgender woman, and nearly three-fourths are in their 30s and 40s, with the rest evenly split between older and younger, with a median age of 37.</p>
<p>About 15 are U.S. military veterans, and one is a former police officer.</p>
<p>The youngest defendant held is 21 — alleged Oregon Proud Boys member Jonathanpeter Klein, who has pleaded not guilty and sought release to home detention, arguing he is not a flight or safety risk.</p>
<p>The oldest person jailed is Lonnie L. Coffman, 70, of Falkville, Ala., accused of parking a pickup truck with 11 molotov cocktails and five loaded weapons on Capitol Hill. He has pleaded not guilty to firearms charges.</p>
<p>All of those currently detained face felony charges punishable by at least a year in prison, except one misdemeanor defendant, who is appealing his detention order.</p>
