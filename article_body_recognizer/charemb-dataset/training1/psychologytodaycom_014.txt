<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Giving Up: Informational Learned Helplessness </a></h2> <p>Figuring out what is true, what is sketchy, and what is downright false can be exhausting. Some may feel like giving up. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Intent Behind a Lie: Mis-, Dis-, and Malinformation</a></h2> <p>There are three main categories of untruths based on the intention behind the lie. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>The Book of Veles: Disinformation From North Macedonia</a></h2> <p>Photojournalist Jonas Bendiksen capitalizes on his reputation for honesty to shake up his profession and ask us all to question what we see and read. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Nicki Minaj and PSAs: Celebrities Can Be Wrong</a></h2> <p>Celebrity endorsements can be both powerful and perilous, which is why we must rely on psychological science. </p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>No, COVID Vaccines Don’t Alter Our Genes</a></h2> <p>Humans prefer simple scientific explanations, which can fuel misinformation.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Tom Cruise, Deepfakes, and the Need for Critical Thinking</a></h2> <p>With the rise of deepfake videos, from revenge porn to celebrity forgeries, we need to think critically about what we think we see. </p> </div> </div> </div>
