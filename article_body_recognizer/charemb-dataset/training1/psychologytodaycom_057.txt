<h1> Puppy Walks and Parenting </h1>
<h2> Daily walks with the puppy teach much about parenting. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> A Parent's Role </li> <li> <a>Find a family counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>We <a>adopted a puppy</a> on the first day of Ohio's <a>coronavirus</a> lockdown. We'd been looking for a year, actively visiting shelters for two weeks, and suddenly, there he was. Our COVID puppy, fresh from his own parvovirus quarantine. </p>
<p>One of the many reasons we brought a new dog into our home was the joy of walking. I love to walk. Every time I was on the trail, I missed <a>our old beagle, Zoe</a>. </p>
<p>So Loki, our puppy, walks. An hour or so in the morning. At least one or two shorter sojourns later in the day. Watching him bounding ahead of me in the woods this morning, I was struck with how good a metaphor dog walking is for <a>parenting</a>.</p>
<p>Authoritative parenting. </p>
<p>That's what reminded me of dog walking this morning.</p>
<p>Two types of dog leashes, two <a>goals</a> of walking. </p>
<p>I have two different leashes for Loki and take her on at least two different types of walks.</p>
<p>Walking the dog has several major goals for us, besides the obvious one of allowing Loki to relieve himself. </p>
<li>Exercise: Muscle development shapes bone development and is important for normal growth.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Loki on a ramble</div> <div>Source: Nancy Darling</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Rambles. We use a long 20' leash for rambling walks around the neighborhood, around our local pond, and through the metroparks so generously scattered around the county. </p>
<p>These types of walks are fairly long—now up to almost an hour—where we will rarely pass more than a few other people along the way. They follow a few rules:</p>
<li>When we're ready to walk, he has to keep up.</li>
<li>No pulling or, especially, jerking (it hurts my arm).</li>
<li>No playing with nasty things—gloves, masks, horse manure, and dead animals spring to mind.</li>
<li>No walking on lawns or in the street (except crossing).</li>
<li>No barking or jumping.</li>

<h1> Make Zoom Socializing More Fun </h1>
<h2> Virtual get-togethers can be awkward. Tips to make them fun! </h2>
<p>As a professor, I spend much of my working life on Zoom—teaching, advising, planning (so much planning), and supervising research teams. Much has been written about "Zoom fatigue." That's not this post. </p>
<p>(Pro tip: Train yourself not to look at your own picture. Then you're not monitoring your behavior in light of what you think other people are thinking about you.)</p>
<p>This post is about playing on Zoom. </p>
<a>attachment</a> theory says that's exactly what we should do. The attachment behavioral system allows us to use others as a secure base to help us continue to explore and stay strong when we are frightened. These are frightening times.
<p>So what I'd like to do here is to suggest a few reasons why these get-togethers might feel so awkward and make suggestions of what makes them work well. Comments and good suggestions are strongly encouraged! </p>
<p>Why get-togethers may be awkward </p>
<p>I am noticing several things that seem to increase the awkwardness of regularly scheduled Zoom chats:</p>
<ul><li>People may be family or know each other, but don't spend much time together, so don't know each other that well</li> <li>Gatherings lack a clear purpose</li> <li>Get-togethers lack an organizational structure</li> </ul>
<p>If this sounds like the formula for a bad meeting, there's a reason for it. It is. Business meetings flounder when they aren't well organized and purposeful and don't end on time. Why shouldn't social family meetings flounder as well?</p>
<p>But we're family! In my experience, few friends or families write agendas before gatherings, yet many of us enjoy family visits. Shouldn't we just be able to hang out together and enjoy each other's company?</p>
<p>I would note a couple of differences between hanging out in person and hanging out on Zoom:</p>
<p>I have a few observations about social meetings of friends and family via Zoom and other venues that seem to help things go well. I'd welcome more positive suggestions in the comments.</p>
<p>Creating time limits, smaller groups, and facilitating conversational flow through hosting and activities can help make socializing a good part of these difficult times.</p>
<p>Please add your own positive suggestions in the comments. What works for you?</p>

<h1> Puppy Training 101: Be Responsive! </h1>
<h2> They listen to people who respond differently to good and bad behavior. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Loki waiting attentively for good things to happen to dogs</div> <div>Source: Nancy Darling</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Do good things happen for dogs?</p>
<p>One of my favorite writers on dog training — Jean Donaldson — says that dogs' behavior is guided by just one question: Do good things happen for dogs?</p>
<p>Yes? Go for it! Snatch that sausage off the plate. Snuggle up on that lap and look adorable. Snap to attention in a perfect "sit." </p>
<p>Her research demonstrates that the key thing that differentiates effective from less effective trainers is:</p>
<ul><li>How frequently they give feedback </li> <li>How consistently they give feedback</li> <li>The timeliness of their feedback</li> </ul>
<p>If this sounds like <a>behaviorism</a>, that's because it is. Donaldson is both a psychologist and a professional trainer. </p>
<p>Physicists have gravity (it's not just a good idea, it's the law). Psychologists have behaviorism.</p>
<li>A reward is anything that increases the likelihood an action will be repeated (good things happen for dogs).</li>
<li>A <a>punishment</a> is anything that decreases the likelihood an action will be repeated (bad things happen for dogs).</li>
<li>Negative reinforcement is a type of reward caused by removing something aversive. If my housetrained puppy has to pee, taking him outside to relieve himself is rewarding because it removes the <a>stress</a> caused by controlling his bladder.</li>
<p>- Run up and look at owner.</p>
<ul><li>Smile and pat.</li> </ul>
<p>- Drop ball on floor in front of owner.</p>
<ul><li>Fun chasey thing moves across the floor.</li> </ul>
<p>- Playfully chew on hand.</p>
<ul><li>No and hand removed.</li> </ul>
<ul><li>Vague grunt.</li> </ul>
<p>- Drop ball on floor in front of them.</p>
<ul><li>Yummy chew toy until nip too hard. Hand jerks away and annoyed yip.</li> </ul>
<p>As has been very well documented in<a> parenting and children</a>, lack of differential responsiveness to good and bad behavior (low demandingness) causes two problems:</p>
<li>It fails to teach good behavior. You don't get more quiet, cuddly, cheerful, playful behavior that makes dogs great to be around.</li>
<li>It fails to squelch bad behavior. Most "bad" behavior — chewing, barking, clawing, soiling in the house — is inherently good for dogs. </li>
<li>It can actively teach bad or annoying behavior. If the owner only pays attention to the dog when it barks or paws, it will bark and paw more and more often.</li>

<h1> Sitting With the Dead </h1>
<h2> Being apart from those we love as they die is one of COVID's cruelest cuts </h2>
<p>Coming in from a cold rainy walk, I was transfixed with a story of a five-year-old girl saying goodbye to her four-year-old cousin who had just died. </p>
<p>I always treasure the time I spent with him as he died. My mother had cared for him for years. She did his home dialysis, helped him monitor his diabetes, counted out his pills. Pushed his wheelchair into the woods up way too muddy trails. </p>
<p>I think about that often now in the pandemic. With so many people away from the presence and touch of their loved ones at the end. A final cruelty.</p>
<p>The ritual of being together as they die. The rituals of crossing the arms and closing the eyes. </p>
<a>the chaplain’s story</a> of how grieving families long to see the bodies of their loved ones, in conditions you can’t imagine would not bring more pain. But they didn't. People want to be there. They want to touch. They need to know.
<p>And I grieve for those who have had that taken from them because of where we are now.</p>

<h1> Condoms, Masks, and Christmas </h1>
<h2> Does wearing masks with family and friends communicate distrust? </h2>
<p>Like most of us, I've been listening to two completely contradictory messages:</p>
<ul><li>Coronavirus is surging! Stay home and wear a mask!</li> <li>Traveling surges as people visit family friends for the holidays!</li> </ul>
<p>Except for that ONE out-of-state trip to my Mom's house.</p>
<p>I was staying a week, had recently been tested, and she had begged me to come. I did not wear a mask. She became part of my family bubble. </p>
<p>So did my eldest son, who traveled eight hours to come home and vote. He was here three days. We didn't mask. </p>
<p>When I visited my mom, we quarantined. No stores. No eating out. We stayed home or walked in the woods with no one in sight. We both tried hard to minimize risk.</p>
<p>But I felt really really uncomfortable telling my sister - who lives in the same town as my mom - that I wouldn't visit HER because I worried about exposing her medically vulnerable family to me.</p>
<p>And even though she understood, I could tell my sister felt hurt. </p>
<p>I'm fine masking with strangers. But somehow masking with family and close friends feels . . . uncomfortable. Like I'm rejecting them.</p>
<a>sexual</a> partners and condom use. Our hypothesis was that having grown up with warm, loving parents reduced risk.
<p>What we found surprised us: Youth with hostile parents were at LOWER risk for HIV. Those who described their parents as warm had more partners and were more likely to engage in unprotected sex. Completely the opposite of our predictions. </p>
<p>More to the point, youth were less likely to practice safe sex with steady partners.</p>
<p>These findings are consistent with a great deal of research on sexual risk. People are less likely to practice safe sex with those they know well. As they establish a relationship, condom use declines. It's an act of trust.</p>
<p>Are masks like condoms? </p>
<p>When we drop our masks - like we do with the family close to us and inside our bubble - we are conveying trust. I TRUST you to keep yourself safe when you're away with me so that you don't make me vulnerable when we're together.</p>
<p>When we ask them to mask, or say we won't visit, we acknowledge <a>distrust</a>. </p>
<p>I say to my mom, "I'm keeping my mask on to keep you safe." </p>
<p>But if she says "I trust you - it's okay," what do I do? I feel guilty for rejecting her trust, even if I know (and she does too), that I may be infected but asymptomatic and could pass on a deadly virus to her. </p>
<p>It's easy with strangers. But with close family and intimate friends, we normally do many things to convey our trust. Right now, that may put us in danger.</p>
<p>Just like the street youth we studied, those intimate loving relationships increased their risk.</p>

<h1> Family Drama From Online Schooling? Try This Five-Minute Plan </h1>
<h2> Online school isn't going away soon. Take action. Make it better. </h2>
<p>Last year, I wrote an essay called What's Working? A Five-Minute Exercise for a Better Life.</p>
<a>my app</a> for kids living with pain, and to improve my teaching.
<p>Today, I want to talk about using it to make on-line schooling better. </p>
<p>1. Take a piece of paper. Divide it into four sections. You can fold one piece of paper or draw a line across two sheets in a spiral notebook. But give yourself some space. Don't cramp your ideas.</p>
<p>2. Write a question in each section. What's working? What's not? What should I do more of? What should I do less of? </p>
<p>3. Think about online schooling and write. Just write. It doesn't have to be in order, but do spend serious time on each one of the four quadrants. Especially the stuff that bugs you.</p>
<p>Be Specific. Nothing is too small.</p>
<p>5. Prioritize and problem solve. Look at what isn't working and what you're doing that's making your life worse. We all do things that make things worse.</p>
<p>You probably can't fix it all. Fix what's bugging you most.</p>
<li>Look at your 'do less of' quadrant. Why are you doing them? What could you do instead? Take some time to find other strategies.</li>
<li>Look at what's 'not working'. Identify the problem you're trying to address. What would make this better? </li>
<li>Look at the 'do more' quadrant. Are there things in there that would help with the things that are going wrong?</li>
<p>It's not a miracle. It's a process.</p>
<p>This technique is a process. Ask each of your kids to do it. Do it yourself. Then sit down and see what you can do together to do good stuff more and bad stuff less.</p>
<p>What you do with your family depends on the problem you're trying to solve.</p>
<p>I always find it helpful. It's part of a <a>mindful</a> process of taking small steps forward that make life better.</p>

<h1> Is Your New Habit Not Sticking? </h1>
<h2> Bandura's social efficacy theory identifies three components to action. </h2>
<p>Physics has gravity (it's not just a good idea, it's the law).</p>
<p>Psychology has learning theory. The basic ideas behind learning theory are deceptively simple:</p>
<li>If you are rewarded for something you will do it more often.</li>
<li>If you are punished for something, you will do it less often.</li>
<li>If something bad is happening and it stops, you'll repeat whatever stopped it.</li>
<li>If something good is happening and it stops, you'll be less likely to do that in the future.</li>
<a>punishment</a> taught us a lot about both animal and human behavior. Learning theory is so well established, psychologists rarely study it anymore. We just use it. I use it when I train my dog. It's basic to
<a>management</a> classes. It's foundational to special
<a>here</a>.) It is also quite subtle. For example, it varies with age, with teens being relatively more sensitive to short-term rewards and less sensitive to punishment than older people are.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Social Efficacy Theory</div> <div>Source: Image by Nancy Darling</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p><a>Social Learning Theory</a> and Efficacy</p>
<a>cognition</a> (thinking) to the basic ideas of reward and punishment is a critical component of learning theory, and marks the change from learning theory to social learning theory.
<p>Why do we do we what we do? Three components of action</p>
<p>When my students go into the classroom, they know how to act as both students and professors, but act as students. Why?</p>
<p>This is where the social efficacy part of Bandura's social learning theory comes in. He argues that several things have to happen for us to enact a behavior.</p>
<a>stress</a> reduction can make it easier to cope with
<a>anxiety</a> and can reduce anxiety over time. That desired goal increases the likelihood that you'll try biofeedback.
<p>2. Know the behavior. Second, you need to know the behavior. If no one teaches you how to do it, you won't use it, even if you want to.</p>
<p>That's pretty basic. You're not going to do it if you don't want what it gets you or if you don't know how to do it.</p>
<p>The third component is more complex.</p>
<p>3. You need to believe it will work for you.</p>
<p>3a. First, you need to believe that biofeedback is an effective stress reduction technique. Plus, you need to believe that stress reduction is helpful in reducing pain in general.</p>
<p>If you don't think stress reduces anxiety or if you don't think that biofeedback reduces stress, you aren't going to use biofeedback even if you've been taught how to use it.</p>
<p>Bottom line: You need to believe something will help in order to do it. If you don't think it will work, you won't</p>
<p>Why? Because although you believe it may work for others, you don't think it will work for you.</p>
<p>That's what efficacy means: believing something will work. <a>Self-efficacy</a> means believing it will work for you.</p>
<p>Stuck? Diagnosing the problem</p>
<p>If you're having trouble starting a new habit and keeping going, look to see where the problem might be.</p>
<p>Do you really want the goal? You've thought about exercising more or getting out of bed earlier. It's not happening. Ask yourself:</p>
<li>If yes keep reading. Identify your sticking point.</li>
<li>If you want it, but think it's too 'expensive', evaluate. Is there any way to make it easier to reach all or part of your goal? In other words, can you make the reward worth the cost?</li>
<li>If no, don't worry about it. Focus on the <a>goals</a> that are more achievable or will make you happier.</li>
<ul><li>Start somewhere. If there is one thing you think will help and you know how to do, start there.</li> <li>If you don't know how, learn. Want to try biofeedback and don't know how? Try YouTube. Skills are the easiest things to pick up.</li> </ul>
<a>boring</a> (more punishment). PTs know from lots of research, that doing the exercises will help. The problem is that almost no one does the exercises.
<li>If no, don't worry about it. Focus on the goals that are more achievable or will make you happier.</li>
<p>If not, you're probably not going to do it. You will have to ask yourself. Why? And what next?</p>
<p>All of this is hard. If something isn't working for you now, figure why. Do you really want it (more than it costs?) Do you know how to get there? Do you think you can do it? </p>
<p>Building habits require action that we can only do ourselves.</p>

<h1> Stoicism Can Make You a Better and Happier Parent </h1>
<h2> Stoic philosophy can help reduce the anxiety of parenting. </h2>
<p>I have learned many things from my mom, a woman who raised five kids from the '50s through the 90s. <a>Humor</a>. Discipline. How to make a great fruitcake. When to say "Because I said so."</p>
<p>Most importantly, I learned an attitude that is profoundly Stoic: "That is not my problem." </p>
<p>Stoicism 101: Focus on what you can control. </p>
<sup>1</sup> A Greek philosophical school embraced by the Romans, Stoicism has had profound influences on the early Christian church and was formative in the development of
<a>therapy</a>. It resonates deeply with Buddhism.
<a>genetics</a>, social inequities, the quality of my healthcare, and many other factors. I want my business to succeed and work hard to achieve that. But it may fail despite my hard work. I want to be respected by my peers. That may not happen.
<a>happiness</a> on changing what is in my control. I should feel satisfaction in my efforts to maintain health and build my business. I should work to do things that are worthy of respect. If I've done all I can, I should be content.
<p>Stoicism and <a>parenting</a>. </p>
<p>My mom worked hard at her parenting. She gave us advice, set rules that seemed stricter than most at the time (but entirely reasonable now), and arranged things so that it was easy for us to make pretty good choices.</p>
<a>wise</a> enough to be quiet and let us talk. She gave advice when asked for, but didn't jump in to solve our problems. I swore she could read minds, but now, as a parent, know she just knew us well and was a great observer of the obvious.
<p>However—and this is where we get to Stoicism—she knew what she couldn't control. </p>
<p>She had thoughts on our careers—practical thoughts like how we were going to keep a roof over our heads or what kinds of hours we would work in different jobs. But what we did with that information and the decisions we made? That was on us. </p>
<p>She had hopes for our futures and helped us to get there. But whatever happened was what happened. </p>
<p>What she did have control over, she controlled. She gave support. She pushed and (definitely) nagged. </p>
<p>She absolutely, positively, and unconditionally loved us and expressed that love all the time. She was always there when we needed her. That was something she could control.</p>
<p>But she also always kept sharp boundaries. What she could do. What we could do. What was outside both of our control. Her happiness focused on what was on her.</p>
<p>Parenting, <a>Anxiety</a>, and Joy</p>
<p>Knowing that helps me more tranquil as a parent. Just like it helped my mom keep her cool. I think it's also made all of us happier. </p>
<p>Most of the time. I am still a Stoic in training. Letting go of what I want that is out of my control is still a work in progress.</p>

<h1> Take a Real Zoom Body Break </h1>
<h2> Zoom meetings exhaust the muscles in your face and neck. Try this to relax. </h2>
<p>I’ve spent countless hours on Zoom. You have too.</p>
<p>We’ve learned some things to reduce Zoom fatigue:</p>
<li>Minimize that picture of yourself so you don’t self-monitor.</li>
<li>Only look at the speaker. You can’t make intense eye contact with a whole bunch of people all day long. </li>
<li>Back up and look out the window to rest your eyes.</li>
<li>Get decent speakers/headphones so you don’t strain to hear.</li>
<p>Last summer I spent five days, eight hours a day in a Zoom workshop. We started at 8 a.m. We finished at 5. We took an hour break for lunch (sometimes).</p>
<p>What I want to write about today are the body breaks we took. </p>
<p>These were not bathroom breaks—although obviously we had those too. These were actual breaks to rest and restore our body. We did them religiously every 90 minutes. Together. With a leader. They were immensely helpful to all of us.</p>
<p>And I want to recommend that you include them in your daily Zoom routine—either during long sessions or between sessions. I use them in long lab sessions when teaching. They help a lot.</p>
<p>The goal: The goal of a body break is to release the tension you get from:</p>
<ul><li>Sitting in the same position for long hours, essentially without moving.</li> <li>Not blinking enough because you’re staring at a screen.</li> <li>Keeping your face composed because there is a screen-full of faces staring at you.</li> </ul>
<li>Gently swivel your head around on your neck. I just did—and heard a lot of pops and creaks. Change directions. Rock it back and forth. </li>
<p>Let’s work on your face.</p>
<p>Faces have many muscles in them—all of which you’re engaging while looking at that screen. Let’s give them a little break.</p>
<li>Relax your jaw, letting your mouth drop open just a bit. Touch the tongue to the roof of your mouth. Breathe out and feel that breath rolling down your shoulders and upper body. </li>
<li>Puff out your cheeks! Now yawn. Notice how relaxing your mouth and jaw travels all the way down your back?</li>
<li>Now take your fingertips and gently tap them on your cheekbones. I like moving them gently from my nose out towards my ear and back. It’s interesting how every place I tape releases a completely different sensation.</li>
<p>Now stand, wiggle your hips, walk around and give those arms a swing.</p>
<p>THAT is a body break. Just a little one. Just a minute or two long. And one you definitely want to be working into your meetings every few hours.</p>
<p>And yeah, I do those facial ones in front of my class. I look like a fool—and so do they. But our eyes are closed, you can turn your camera off, and all of us feel better and more ready to work again when we’re done.</p>

<h1> How to Make Family Outings More Fun </h1>
<h2> Enjoying time together builds memories and skills. </h2>
<li>Telling kids a family trip will be "fun" often evokes immediate opposition. Don't tell them how to feel.</li>
<li>When kids seem engaged on a family trip, reinforce it with a positive response. However, it's ok if they stay disengaged.</li>
<li>Sharing one's enthusiasm as a parent on a family trip can leave space for kids to get curious enough to enjoy it, too.</li>
<p>Getting closer confirmed the all-too-familiar issues. Mom assuring her daughter that "it is fun." Eye rolls. Heavy auntie sighs and loud grumbles of "I want to go home!" followed by "Come on, it's family time."</p>
<p>Family time in the woods.</p>
<h3>4 ways my own parents made family time fun</h3>
<p>I come from a big family that did things together every weekend. Sailing. Canoe trips. Picnics. Walks, Visits to Grandma's. Every week. We all came unless we had a scheduled event. It was not optional.</p>
<p>There were lots of times I'd rather have stayed home. But I remember those times together fondly — and so do my sisters and brother. How did my parents manage it?</p>
<a>boring</a> than we thought it was going to be. If they included stuff we liked along the way, there was always something that made it at least okay. Or, if it involved ice cream, kind of nice.

<h1> Don't Beat Yourself Up for Not Being the Perfect Parent </h1>
<h2> Our parenting standards are unrealistic. Focus on the important things. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> A Parent's Role </li> <li> <a>Find a family counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Many parents are trying to meet two incompatible standards: always being available to children and also spending quality time with children.</li>
<li>Parents should focus on what's most important instead, which includes showing children unconditional love and being emotionally predictable. </li>
<li>Children thrive when they are encouraged and expected to do their best. Parents should set reasonable but high expectations for children.</li>
<p>I have studied <a>parenting</a> on five continents for close to four decades. I'm also a mom — the mom of two sons, one of them who is very sick. I know what it is to beat yourself up about not being a perfect parent. </p>
<p>But too many parents beat themselves because they are trying to meet two entirely different, incompatible, and unrealistic standards.</p>
<h3>What Is Really Important to Children?</h3>
<p>Although it's easy to beat up on ourselves for not doing everything, that doesn't make us better parents. What is most important? Where should we focus our efforts?</p>
<a>attachment</a> researchers call "safe havens." Places they can retreat to when they are scared or stressed or tired from their explorations and adventures.
<a>anxious</a> because sometimes you'll praise them effusively, sometimes you explode and sometimes you ignore them for exactly the same behavior. Knowing what to expect takes worry out of kids' lives.

<h1> How Many Teens Face Police Discrimination? </h1>
<h2> Racial discrimination can have repercussions for academic achievement. </h2>
<li>More than 20 percent of Black and Latinx high school students reported that police hassled them in the last year, according to a new study.</li>
<li>The experience was more unusual for White students, with only 4 percent reporting being hassled by the police.</li>
<li>Being hassled by the police was associated with lower grades and less academic engagement for all youth.</li>
<p>The murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and others have both broadened and sharpened awareness of police discrimination faced by people of color in the United States.</p>
<a>recent paper</a> published in the Journal of
<a>Adolescence</a> highlights how prevalent the experience of discrimination is among Black and Latinx teens and some of its effects. As part of a larger project focused on adolescent well-being and ethnic
<a>identity</a>, researhers Zeiders, Umaña-Taylor, Cardajal and Pech (2021) surveyed 1,378 high school students in a Southwestern U.S. city. All were asked whether they had been "hassled by police" because of their race or
<a>ethnicity</a> in the last year. They reported frequencies from 0 (never) to 6 (more than 10 times a year).
<p>The results are both sad and unsurprising. Twenty-four percent of black, 20 percent of Latinx, and 3 percent of White teens reported being hassled by police because of their race or ethnicity during the last year.</p>

<a>empathy</a> for others. Sociopathy is a non-diagnostic term, and it is not synonymous with "
<a>psychopathy</a>," though the overlap leads to frequent confusion. Sociopaths may or may not break the law, but by exploiting and manipulating others, they violate the trust that the human enterprise runs on.

<div> <h3> How likely am I to encounter a sociopath? </h3> </div>
<a> 6.2% of the general population would meet the criteria for narcissistic personality disorder </a>and 3.7% would meet the criteria for antisocial

<a>Psychopathy</a> is inborn and immutable. Psychopaths are more likely to commit acts of violence. Still, because both conditions lie on a spectrum, it can be difficult to know which terms best apply.

<div> <h3> What is the difference between a sociopath and a psychopath? </h3> </div>
