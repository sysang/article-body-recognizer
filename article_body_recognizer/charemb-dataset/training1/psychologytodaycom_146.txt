<h1> Ensuring That School Initiatives Work </h1>
<h2> Kim Wallace’s new book helps educators successfully launch new initiatives. </h2>
<li>At a time when new initiatives most need to succeed, exhausted educators are seeing too many potential solutions slip through their fingers.</li>
<li>Kim Wallace, former FUSD superintendent, wrote a new book and her process for making the most of organizational change efforts in education.</li>
<li>Part of Wallace's book delves into eliminating ineffective or outdated programs to make room for systemwide growth.</li>
<p>I had the pleasure of meeting Wallace at the recent California Educational Research Association (CERA) Conference, where I learned about her new book, Leading the Launch: A Ten-Stage Process for Successful District Initiatives.</p>
<p>Jenny Rankin (JR): You created a system to regulate programs, protocols, and adoptions. Can you describe that for us?</p>
<a>leadership</a>, policies, or conditions shift, educators often brace themselves for some fresh “flavor of the month” while waiting for “this too, to pass.”
<p>I felt it was our professional duty to conserve our publicly-funded limited resources, make good on promises to teachers and students, and instill trust within the community. </p>
<p>JR: I love how your system ties very directly with our professional duty. What are the ten steps of your process to help schools and districts successfully spearhead new initiatives?</p>
<p>The next three stages contain the key ingredients for designing the proof of concept, prototype, and pilot, building stakeholder engagement; and gathering and analyzing data.</p>
<p>After the first six stages of the new initiative process are complete, stage seven tackles the “to be or not to be” culminating decision to push the plan forward, slow it down, or shelve it.</p>
<p>Once a proposal is approved, the final three stages are put into motion, including planning and delivering professional development, rolling out the implementation, and providing ongoing support.</p>
<p>JR: That really makes sense and shows a lot of sensitivity to the ways people and movements operate. How does a school or department overflowing with initiatives determine what to keep, modify, or drop?</p>
<p>KW: Adding without taking away compounds the original dilemma of initiative overload, so educators must be willing to critically assess the existing programs, policies, and practices in their organization.</p>
<p>JR: That’s a great analogy. Your new book and 12-hour action-learning series, Leading the Launch, includes added resources like action plans and checklists. Can you describe some of these?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Leading the Launch</div> <div>Source: Dr. Kim Wallace, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Here is a free resource</a> that includes action steps for each stage in the process.
<p>JR: Thanks for that helpful resource. Do you have any final thoughts for our readers?</p>

<p>The pandemic has radically changed almost everything about work—where we do it, when we do it, even what the “workday” means. One thing hasn’t changed, though—the need to take a break from it.</p>
<p>The National Bureau of Economic Research reports that Americans are working, on average, 48 minutes more per day now than they did before the pandemic. But there’s no evidence that they are taking any more breaks.</p>
<h2>A Break Is Never a Waste of Time</h2>

<h2>4 Reasons to Consider a Gap Year</h2>
<h4>Families should talk about four factors when deciding whether their teens should take a break before college.</h4>
<p>By Marcia Morris, M.D. “Do you want to take a gap year?” is a question I never asked my children when they were applying to college. But today I recommend that all families consider the option as they contemplate life after high school.</p>
<p>I recommend that parents consider four factors when deciding if a gap year would be a net gain for their child’s future success and, equally important, his or her mental health and wellness:</p>
<a>therapy</a>, focused on coping skills, while a child works or volunteers in the community and gains greater levels of independence, can be beneficial.

<p>Everyone feels lacking in coping ability and <a>resilience</a> at times. Psychiatric treatment isn’t the answer to that.</p>
<h2>A New Doctor In the House</h2>
<h4>Pushed by the pandemic, companies are promoting employee health and well-being to the C-suite. </h4>
<a>productivity</a> ceased and companies couldn’t even do business.

<p>Organizations can also expect CHOs to do a deeper dive on issues driving mental health problems, including racism and <a>gender</a> <a>discrimination</a>, that contribute to toxic work cultures.</p>
<p>The advent of top executives who make mental and physical health a priority in business is worth celebrating. It’s just a little too soon to know how big a difference they can make.</p>

<h2>Psychology From the Neck Down</h2>
<h4>It turns out that the body has a big say in what we do and who we are.</h4>

<h1> How to Forgive Yourself </h1>
<h2> Many roads to contentment begin with self-forgiveness. It is among the most difficult—and most important—steps one can take. </h2>
<p> By Psychology Today Contributors published January 4, 2022 - last reviewed on January 4, 2022 </p>

<h2>The Person You Can’t Part With</h2>
<h4>Make amends with yourself and get on with life.</h4>
<a>self-forgiveness</a> is hard can make it easier to practice.
<a>education</a> system tells us that anything that is not “right” is “bad” and deserves some form of
<a>divorce</a>, or walk away. Loving and appreciating the self is key.
<p>Matt James, Ph.D., is the author of The Foundation of Huna: Ancient <a>Wisdom</a> for Modern Times.</p>
<div>Moya Mc Allister, used with permission.</div>
<h2>Are You Deceiving Yourself?</h2>
<h4>How to break old patterns of self-denigration.</h4>
<a>self-deception</a>, which makes it difficult to identify when self-forgiveness is appropriate. Some of these forms of self-deception include:
<a>perfectionism</a>. You expect yourself to be perfect, and anything less than that is abject failure. You believe you control the outcomes of your actions. If those actions go awry, you can only assume it is your fault.
<p>Self-forgiveness does not happen quickly and easily. It can be scary, but it can also be uplifting and liberating.</p>
<p>Peg O’Connor, Ph.D., is a professor of <a>philosophy</a> and <a>gender</a>, women, and <a>sexuality</a> studies at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota.</p>
<h2>Anatomy of an Over-Apology</h2>
<h4>Stop it! It’s not your fault or your problem.</h4>
<p>Is your immediate expression of sorrow rational? You are in no way to blame for the outcome. On the other hand, you may honestly feel great empathy and can put yourself in the other person’s position, vividly imagining the situation.</p>
<h4>Other People’s Woes, Not Yours</h4>
<h4>How to Regulate Your Apology</h4>
<a>empathic</a> concern can help you maintain the kind of perspective needed for your own emotional fulfillment.
<p>Susan Krauss Whitbourne, Ph.D., a professor emerita at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, is the author of The Search for Fulfillment.</p>
<h2>The Most Painful Emotion</h2>
<h4>What really happens when we hear, “Shame on you”?</h4>
<p>This punishment might come from others or ourselves and might take its ultimate form: Feelings of shame increase the risk of <a>suicide</a> in some individuals.</p>
<p>Mainly, shame is <a>fear</a> of rejection, humiliation, unacceptability, of being bad in a good world.</p>
<p>Ashamed, we isolate—thinking ourselves unqualified for comfort, clemency, or hugs. Too much is happening inside for us to carefully unbind the razor wire netting that is shame.</p>
<p>But unbind it we must, exploring one by one its toxic threads:</p>
<p>Regret. Ashamed, we wish things had gone differently—that we had shut up, spoken up, been smarter, slimmer, stronger, nicer, or just never born. Can I erase the summer of 2007? Or that text?</p>
<p><a>Self-loathing</a>. Shame is almost synonymous with self-loathing—a crushing, wrenching sense of being unacceptable, unlovable, unfixable, and believing that others must agree. Being ashamed means being painfully embarrassed to exist.</p>
<p>Disgust. While shame is said to have evolved to maintain social hierarchies, disgust is believed to have evolved to help humans avoid disease. But disgust focused on oneself is shame, the kind that drives eating disorders and <a>self-harm</a>.</p>
<p>Fear. We fear exposure, accusation, punishment. Afraid that we cannot erase those deeds or thoughts or qualities that shame us, we exist on quicksand, dreading the one ticking time-bomb we cannot escape: ourselves.</p>
<p>Might they not be voices at all but history, collective <a>trauma</a> shouting what we should and should not be?</p>
<p>S. Rufus is the author, under the byline Anneli Rufus, of several books, including Party of One and Stuck.</p>
<h2>How Forgiving Are You?</h2>
<h4>Our degree of forgiveness varies depending on who hurt us and when the incident occurred.</h4>
<p>Please rate each item on a 1-to-6 scale: 1 = Strongly Disagree 2 = Disagree 3 = Slightly Disagree 4 = Slightly Agree 5 = Agree 6 = Strongly Agree</p>
<p>For each item, rate the level of agreement on the above scale that best describes your current feeling. Fill in the blanks with each of the indicated words or phrases in turn before answering.</p>
<p>This first set of items deals with your current feelings or emotions toward the person.</p>
<p>1. I feel _____ toward him/her.</p>
<p>warm (1) negative (2) kindness (3) dislike (4) happy (5) angry (6)</p>
<p>This set of items deals with your current behavior toward the person.</p>
<p>2. Regarding this person,</p>
<p>I do or would _____. show friendship (7) avoid (8) aid him/her when in trouble (9) ignore (10) do a favor (11) not speak to him/her (12)</p>
<p>This set of items deals with your current opinion of the person. Consider the thoughts that occupy your mind right now regarding this particular person.</p>
<p>3. I think the person is _____.</p>
<p>of good quality (13) corrupt (14) a good person (15)</p>
<p>4. Regarding this person, I _____.</p>
<p>disapprove of him/her(16) wish him/her well (17) condemn him/her (18)</p>
<p>Scoring: Add up your scores as you recorded them for the following items: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17.</p>
<p>Important: Now reverse score the remaining items. (If you gave a rating of 1, score it as a 6; if you rated an item as a 2, give it a 5; if you rated an item as a 3, then score it as a 4; and so on.) Add up your scores on all 18 items.</p>
<p>If you scored between 87 and 108, then you are already forgiving or well on your way to be even more forgiving toward that person. You likely do not need to go through the forgiveness process with this person.</p>
