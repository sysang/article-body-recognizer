<h1> 10 Signs of Emotional Neglect in Your Relationship </h1>
<h2> Emotional neglect can be hard to identify. Here's how to spot and remedy it. </h2>
<li>The key to emotional connection in a marriage is responding to each other's emotional needs.</li>
<li>Even though it's hard to see and recognize, emotional neglect in a marriage causes real pain.</li>
<li>Emotional connection is not a thing that you either have or don't have; it's an action that you can take.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: By kieferpix/Adobe Stock Images</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Emotional neglect in a relationship is the absence of enough emotional awareness and response. It may be invisible to everyone, even the couple themselves, yet it's painful. Both partners are hurt by what is not there.</p>
<p>In a now-classic 2004 study, researcher John Gottman, Ph.D. found that the difference between couples that thrive and those that divorce is the frequency with which couples meet each other’s requests for emotional connection.</p>
<p>When it comes to relationships, feelings provide the connection, the warmth, the fire, and the glue. It is vital that couples reach out and respond to each other emotionally.</p>
<p>So what happens if you or your partner simply isn’t capable of requesting or responding?</p>
<p>And, beyond that, what if it’s no one’s fault?</p>
<h3>The Emotionally Neglectful Relationship</h3>
<p>If I had to describe an emotionally neglectful <a>marriage</a> in one word, it would probably be, “<a>lonely</a>.”</p>
<p>It’s almost as if there is a wall between you blocking you from them, and them from you. A wall you can see through, but you can’t get through. That wall is made up of emotional neglect.</p>
<h3>How Childhood Emotional Neglect Creeps Into a Marriage</h3>
<p>Actually, it doesn’t exactly creep in. Instead, it strides through the back door, silently and stealthily undermining the communication, the connection, the compassion, and the warmth in your relationship.</p>
<p>Usually, emotional neglect is brought into the marriage through the <a>childhood</a> of one or both of the partners.</p>
<p>When one or both partners comes from a family that’s not aware of feelings and under-attends to them (childhood emotional neglect), that partner naturally continues that process.</p>
<p>If you and your partner both brought the emotional blind spot into your relationship, then a somewhat different problem ensues, because neither of you can see what’s missing.</p>
<p>But, though no one is responsible for the emotional neglect they received, once we are aware of the problem, we are responsible for the emotional neglect we give.</p>
<p>Once we see it in ourselves, we become the change agent. We become responsible for stopping the cycle.</p>
<p>No one says it’s an easy “fix.” But the problem of emotional neglect in a marriage can be resolved. The skills of emotional <a>intimacy</a> and connection are learnable.</p>
<h3>10 Signs That Emotional Neglect is Silently Undermining Your Relationship</h3>
<li>You and your partner misread each other’s true feelings, actions, thoughts, or intentions very often.</li>
<li>As a couple, you avoid bringing up difficult things so as not to upset the other.</li>
<li>You haven’t figured out how to argue productively.</li>
<li>Your conversations are mostly focused on facts, events, or logistics.</li>
<li>Your spouse is not the first person you want to tell when something great happens or a problem comes up.</li>
<li>If you seek comfort from your spouse they often say the wrong thing.</li>
<li>You don’t feel like you’re a team taking on life together.</li>
<li>You often feel alone when you’re with your partner.</li>
<li>It can be difficult to find something to talk about together.</li>
<li>Positive emotions like love, warmth, or emotional <a>bonding</a> feel awkward or only happen during <a>sex</a>.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: By Monkey Business/Adobe Stock Photos</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>First, if some of these ten apply to your marriage, consider the possibility that emotional neglect is at work.</p>
<p>Then, remind yourself that blame is unhelpful and unnecessary here.</p>
<p>Ask your spouse for emotional support, or to share in a happy, sad, or painful moment. Watch for times when they are requesting an emotional bond with you, and provide it.</p>
<p>Ask – Give – Take. Ask – Give – Take. Each time you do it, you are removing the invisible pain from your marriage. You are healing the emotional neglect, one step at a time.</p>
<p>Finally, instead of being silently hurt by what isn't there, you will be connected and enriched by what you have created together.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The Heritability of Fearful Attachment </a></h2> <p>You don't need to be traumatized to have a fearful attachment style; you might have inherited it through your genes. </p> </div> </div> </div>

<h1> Radical Adaptability: The Zeitgeist for Survivors in 2021 </h1>
<h2> Here's what cancer survivors have in common with businesses and couples today. </h2>
<li>The more primal the loss, the deeper the change it brings forth.</li>
<li>Individuals and companies that cannot adapt are more likely to fail.</li>
<li>Looking to people (and businesses) who have literally had the rug torn from under their feet provides inspiration.</li>
<blockquote> <p>Things have happened to us that we didn’t want. </p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>We can’t have it the way we used to do. </p> </blockquote>
<blockquote> <p>It’s time to find new ways. </p> </blockquote>
<p>Whose voices are you hearing? Friends? Businesses? Your own?</p>
<h3>Letting go to let new ways come.</h3>
<a>anger</a>. And in the case of business loss, nothing beats some rational analysis of what went wrong and why.
<a>wisdom</a> and crack the unmanageable changes that need to happen.
<h3>We all have to pivot radically to survive beyond 2021.</h3>
<p>The learning that emerges will likely also help all of us respond to the mental health challenges of the pandemic era. And I am sure I don’t have to point out the resonance of my theme with <a>climate change</a>.</p>
<p>So let’s take a look at two apparently unrelated communities. You might be surprised how much they can learn from each other.</p>
<h3>Many businesses are almost as vulnerable as individuals right now.</h3>
<p>Focusing on change in 2021 is way beyond change management—this is about navigating change so profound that it is almost unimaginable.</p>
<li>Example: A business that sold international leisure travel wakes up in the middle of a pandemic. I have a friend who took one piece of that business and turned it into a digital <a>marketing</a> agency.</li>
<li>Example: An organization run by white men for generations wakes up in a #BLM and #MeToo world that expects to see women and people of color holding major <a>leadership</a> roles. Courageous change agents around the world are making it happen.</li>
<li>Example: You have shares in a business that has made billions in the carbon-based economy, and that game is up. New green economies are germinating as we speak.</li>
<p>What all these examples have in common is that if the business tries to carry on business as usual, it will die. If you or your friends are entrepreneurs or employees, I almost guarantee their future livelihood depends on radical change.</p>
<a>resilience</a>, reinvention. These are key themes in the cancer survivor communities I belong to.
<a>(See more on this here.)</a> If we are lucky enough to survive, we get the opportunity to change and find new life in truly rewarding ways. Here are some examples to remind you: No change is too big.
<h3>When cancer treatment challenges primal sexual identity and function.</h3>
<a>sexual</a> function. Breast cancer survivors tell analogous stories of primal challenges to their
<h3>Primal challenge brings forth radical change.</h3>
<p>From this community come some remarkable examples of adaptation:</p>

<a>anxious</a>. One look at the calendar and you connect the dots from your current emotional state to the
<a>traumatic</a> event. For example, the birthday of someone who's no longer alive, the date of an accident, a natural disaster or a

<h1> How Ruminating and Obsessing Can Trap Me in My Own Mind </h1>
<h2> My first post-pandemic pedicure. </h2>
<p>The term to ruminate is defined as, “To think deeply about something.”</p>
<p>The term to obsess is defined as, “To preoccupy or fill the mind continually, intrusively, and to a troubling extent.”</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Burgundy, Holiday Red, Maroon, Vamp...make up your mind.</div> <div>Source: Pexels/Cottonbro</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Although these terms are somewhat similar, when examined more closely, they have a unique psychological effect on the mind when applied to certain situations.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to get a pedicure. It had been almost two years since my last visit, and my toes were in tough shape.</p>
<p>Rumination is used to describe: Contemplation. I found myself immediately contemplating my decision. Do I pay this price or walk out the door?</p>
<p>After self-inflicted rumination, I decided to stay put, pay double the price, and get a pedicure on a clean chair in a sterile environment.</p>
<p>At this point, mid-way through the pedicure, I realized my contemplating thoughts were ruining the whole experience, and impeding my ability to relax and enjoy the luxury of the moment.</p>
<p>Then my mind switched gears, again, and I started to obsess.</p>
<p>When my toes were done, I was satisfied. I sat in the chair waiting for them to dry and probably stayed there longer than usual. I wanted to spend time in the chair, and better savor the experience.</p>
<p>When I walked home I thought about what should have been a relaxing experience, but my obsessive and ruminating thoughts had gotten in the way.</p>
<p>Next time I find myself in a situation where I am engaging in ruminating and or obsessive thoughts, I will try and catch myself. There is no point in being trapped inside my own mind.</p>
<p>Even if it is just a pedicure.</p>

<h1> Mental Disorder Within the Neurodiversity Paradigm </h1>
<h2> Can neurodiversity proponents keep the notion of mental pathology? </h2>
<a>psychiatric</a> classifications resist the notion of neurodiversity. Consider Post-
<a>Traumatic</a> Stress Disorder (
<a>PTSD</a>). This is typically defined as an
<a>anxiety</a> disorder caused by traumatic, frightening, or
<a>stressful</a> experiences, which can range from violence to
<a>psychological abuse</a>. PTSD can be very distressing, and it is clearly a kind of illness, in the sense that it is a form of damage that is caused by a harmful environment, much as heatstroke is caused by an environment that is too hot.
<a>anorexic</a> individuals argue that anorexia is a way of life rather than an illness. It has recently emerged that anorexia is
<a>in significant part genetic</a>. Given this, what if someone with anorexia decided to identify as merely neurodivergent, rather than ill?
<p>I don't know yet how this will turn out. But in the long run, it is vital that we do so in order to bring our conceptions of mental health and illness in line with the rise of the neurodiversity paradigm.</p>
<a> <p>Robert Chapman, Ph.D., is a neurodivergent academic. He was previously employed as a research fellow in the philosophy department at the University of Bristol, UK.</p> </a>

<a>identity</a>: When individuals who had received
<p>Self-diagnosis of autism or ADHD is controversial but anyone is free to embrace the <a>neurodiversity paradigm</a> and say they are “different” because they are not assuming a formal medical label. </p>
<p>That difference in views may be expressed thusly: At its extremes, difference becomes disability. While the point of transition varies from one person to another, there is always a point at which healthy difference becomes pathology or disorder.</p>
<p>Neurodiversity as a biological fact applies to everyone. Neurodiversity as a term of identity applies to many people, but a significant number who feel disabled reject the neurodiversity paradigm. That is one limit of neurodiversity. </p>
<a>adoption</a> of the neurodiversity paradigm renders such people invisible.
