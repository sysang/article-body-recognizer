<h1> Happiness vs. Pleasure: The Source of Our Discontent? </h1>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> How Can I Manage My Anger? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to heal from anger</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>We confuse pleasure and happiness because both feel good.</li>
<li>Culture plays a major role in the confusion, urging us to search for one when we really want the other.</li>
<li>Pleasure and happiness have different physiological underpinnings.</li>
<li>Pleasure is fueled by dopamine and can give rise to addiction; happiness is linked to serotonin and connection.</li>
<p>Understanding our feelings can be challenging, but it is necessary for our health and wellness. Using language to describe the sensations and emotions we call feelings is limiting, as our feelings are so subjective and abstract in their nature.</p>
<a>happiness</a> and pleasure can shed some light on how we can be happier and healthier as individuals and as a society.
<h3>Happiness and Neurotransmitters</h3>
<a>nervous system</a>. Happiness can be associated with high levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin (connection) and gamma amino butyric acid (GABA, relaxation), as well.
<p>Notably, happiness can occur in the absence of <a>dopamine</a>, the absence of the need to move, do and seek. Happiness occurs only in a state of safety. Satisfaction and contentment are better descriptors of happiness than pleasure.</p>
<h3>Pleasure and Neurotransmitters</h3>
<a>motivation</a>, curiosity, and reward, goal and pleasure seeking. Dopamine is a major signaler in the sympathetic nervous system. In states of safety, dopamine can move us to
<a>confidence</a> and connection. However, in states of threat, dopamine can move us to conflict and
<p>If we achieve what we want in either of these physiologic states, then we get a little more dopamine and a little more pleasure. Our emotions and behaviors are reinforced; We will seek to replicate the strategies we deployed.</p>
<h3>Sadness, Pain, and Neurotransmitters</h3>
<p>Sadness is considered the opposite of happiness. Sadness has low levels of acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA and dopamine. Sadness occurs only in a state of threat.</p>
<p>Pain is often considered the opposite of pleasure. Pain has low levels of dopamine, too. In pain glutamate and noradrenaline are dominant while acetylcholine, serotonin and GABA are low. Pain, also, occurs only in a state of threat.</p>
<p>The profiles of sadness and pain look an awful lot alike—and they are. Pain and sadness are frequently experienced together, as they come from the same physiologic soup.</p>
<a>sex</a>. That is all well known. What is not well described is our
<a>addiction</a> to the pleasure of aggression. When aggression is a successful strategy, it is reinforced with dopamine and thus repeated.

<a>politics</a> as well, with more conflict production than policy production. Aggression becomes an addiction.
<p>“Please, sir, give me more of this perverse pleasure.”</p>
<a>passive-aggressive</a> behaviors can thus trap us all in suffering. In this “addiction” to aggression we suffer from more physical, mental, emotional, social, and
<a>spiritual</a> illness and disease than from all the other addictions combined. Indeed, our addiction to aggression and threat may be the root of all other addictions.
<p>Happiness is found in safety. If we provide safety for ourselves and others we will find happiness. This practice should be a priority for individuals as well as institutions.</p>

<h3>Sulking, Pouting, and the Silent Treatment</h3>

<h3>False Promises, Procrastinating, and Keeping People Hanging </h3>
<a>procrastination</a> and delays, he hopes the issue will be overlooked, expectations lowered, and that he will not be asked again.
<p>For some teens, chronically keeping people waiting, hanging, frustrated, and disappointed are ways to control the relationship indirectly. She or he takes delight in pushing people's (especially adults') buttons.</p>
<h3>Excuse-Making, Blaming, Shifting, and Victimhood</h3>
<p>Two other frequent excuse-making tactics are blame-shifting and victimhood—it’s always someone else’s fault, and it’s beyond the teenager’s control. Primary responsibility is thus avoided.</p>
<h3>Negative Humor, Teasing, and Sarcasm</h3>
<h3>Passive-Aggressive Words and Phrases </h3>
<p>Below are some common teenage passive-aggressive expressions and their possible meta-meanings. Oftentimes, it is not the words but the tone which reveals the adolescent’s true mindset and emotions.</p>
<li>“Fine!” (anger, defiance, resistance)</li>
<li>“What!?” (anger, resentment, annoyance)</li>
<li>“Whatever!” (disagreement, dismissiveness, marginalization, belittlement)</li>
<li>“I don’t care!” (bitterness, resentment)</li>
<li>“Oh, well!” (dismissiveness, detachment, shedding responsibility) </li>
<li>“I’m not angry!” or “I’m not upset!” (angry, upset)</li>
<li>Smiley and other emojis in messages (tone of the written text reveals true intention and emotions).</li>

<a>autism</a> has risen over the past few decades, a finding established by multiple methods of assessing prevalence. New analyses of a national survey emphasize this trend—estimating a rate of 2.5 percent. They also call

<h2> What do I do if my child is diagnosed with autism? </h2>
<a>explore behavioral therapies</a> with your child’s doctor as soon as possible. These may include applied behavioral analysis, speech therapy, and occupational therapy.
<a>keep organized records</a> of your child’s medical appointments to create a complete picture of your child at different stages. You may also want to take notes on developmental milestones, improvements, and health conditions.
<p><a>Connect with your child</a> in any way you can, such as by talking, reading, or showing educational videos, even if it seems like your child isn’t paying attention. Read accounts that other parents and autistic adults have written.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, take care of yourself. Set aside time to recharge. Seek out positive people and avoid those who drain your energy.</p>
<h2> How do I handle the stress of raising a child with autism? </h2>
<p>Many features of autism—tantrums, aggression, language deficits, limited family opportunities, and the inability to gain independence—contribute to the <a>deep and distinct distress</a> that many caregivers experience.</p>
<h2> How can I help teach my child social skills? </h2>
<p>Parents can discuss social situations the child sees on TV or ones they’re likely to encounter at school. The parent and child should take turns role-playing, so that the child practices playing both individuals in the scenario. </p>
<p>Scheduling play dates with kids in a support group can allow children to practice social skills while providing parents an opportunity to discuss strategies with other parents.</p>
<h2> How should I talk to my child about autism? </h2>
<h2> How should I discipline my autistic child? </h2>
<p>Parents may then seek to implement a system of rewards for positive behavior and punishment for negative behavior. Following this plan consistently can help the child understand the consequences of their actions.</p>
<h2> How can parents avoid blaming themselves? </h2>
<a>reject the premise that there is anything to be blamed for,</a> believing that autism is not a disorder but a different way of thinking and being.
<h2> How does having a child with autism affect a marriage? </h2>
<a>study found no difference:</a> 64 percent of children with autism had married parents, and 65 percent of children without autism had married parents. The idea that
<a>couples divorce due to autism</a> may be overblown, or at the least, it merits more research.
<h2> How does having a child with autism affect their siblings? </h2>
<p>Nevertheless, siblings of children with autism can also come to embody countless positive traits, such as empathy, cooperation, tolerance, altruism, maturity, and responsibility.</p>
<h2> How much does it cost to raise a child with autism? </h2>
<p>Raising a child with autism costs around <a>$60,000 each year</a>, according to the advocacy group Autism Speaks. Costs may be higher if the child’s autism is more severe.</p>
<p>Finances are devoted to obtaining therapies, education, caregiver time, and health care. Parents may also face financial strain because a partner may decide to leave work to care for the child full time.</p>
