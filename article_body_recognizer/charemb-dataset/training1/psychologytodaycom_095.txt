<a>divorce</a>. The researchers found that participants who displayed more self-compassion when talking about their breakup were healthier and happier, and that the effect persisted nine months later. In short, they were more resilient.
<p>What kinds of situations tend to eat away at self-compassion?</p>
<p>Shame is the biggest culprit—the constant self-judgment, beating ourselves up. We need to learn to quiet the voices that tell us we aren’t good enough and instead of being our inner enemy to become our inner ally.</p>
<p>How do you make the case that waking up each day and saying I love you to yourself isn’t contrived or inauthentic?</p>
<a>lonely</a> and raw, some days it feels awkward, and some days I feel profound love. No matter what I feel, I keep practicing. Science teaches us that what you practice grows stronger, so I continue to plant the seeds of kindness.
<p>What is the single most important message of your book?</p>
<p>The single most important message is that change is possible, no matter what our past, no matter what mistakes we’ve made—all of us have the capacity to transform our lives.</p>

<p>In a world full of talk, much of it is angry, self-serving, and unheard. Real conversation is something else entirely, and it takes the right motivation and the right skills.</p>
<p>Your book, <a>Beyond Your Bubble</a>, is about conversation. How deeply does the failure of conversation today affect us?</p>
<a>stress</a> due to political conflict.
<p>How did we get into this state?</p>
<p>What is the secret of connecting with people who have different views?</p>
<p>Why do people feel pessimistic about bridging the political divide?</p>

<a>confidence</a> that they can implement the skills for productive dialogue. I also help people understand and correct their distorted perceptions of people whose views, values, and experiences are different from their own.
<p>Is the failure of dialogue really only a matter of lack of skills? Or is it something deeper?</p>

<p>Bipolar disorder can carry a host of practical problems for both the person with the condition and those around him or her. But it can also bring with it interesting questions of <a>identity</a>.</p>
<p>As you note, there is quite a cultural bookshelf on bipolarity. What prompted you to add to it with your book, The Rapids?</p>
<p>What do you believe you are adding to it?</p>
<p>What conversation do you hope to start with The Rapids?</p>
<a>manic episode</a>. So I was hoping the book would ignite a conversation around visibility and caution.
<p>If <a>creativity</a> is the least interesting aspect of bipolar disorder, what is the most interesting aspect?</p>
<p>When is bipolarity a superpower and when is it a disability?</p>
<a>leader</a> when it comes to disability
<a>politics</a>, and they adopt the social model of thinking about disability: I’m not the problem, what is in my way is. I carry around that model of thinking with me always.
<p>One of the side effects of <a>medication</a> is making the illness invisible to yourself. How does that invisibility affect you? Or others?</p>
<p>What is mania as a cultural identity?</p>
<p>Do you believe you have a <a>psychiatric</a> disability? Do others?</p>
<p>Disorder, disease, illness, condition—language is important. What do you and don’t you like about each?</p>
<p>Do you think social media have made mania worse?</p>
<p>What insights about yourself or about your condition/disease/disorder/illness did you get after completing the book?</p>
<p>If you had to limit yourself to one item, what one idea or insight would you like readers to get from this book?</p>
<p>Take care of yourself and take care of others where you can.</p>

<p>Everyone distorts the world to some degree. Narcissists do it in a very distinctive way to protect themselves. Even so, it turns out, not all narcissists are alike.</p>
<p>What is the new science of narcissism?</p>
<p>How does it differ from the old science of narcissism?</p>
<a>shy</a> and insecure, and both could be described under the same label of “narcissist.”
<p>What are the origins of this new science?</p>
<p>What do you find that people misunderstand most about narcissism?</p>
<a>personality disorder</a> or a clinical syndrome. More often, though, when people talk about narcissism, they’re actually describing a personality trait. In reality, we all have some level of

<a>assertive</a>, and combative interpersonally. He’s certainly someone who holds a high opinion of himself.

<p>What damage do narcissists do—to themselves and/or to those around them?</p>
<a>romantic relationships</a>, and dishonest in business relationships. In the short term, all of that hurts other people but benefits the narcissist.
<p>However, over time, people grow to dislike the narcissist and leave the relationship. As a result, people who are narcissistic are constantly in search of new partners to take advantage of, manipulate, and exploit.</p>
<p>Is there an upside to narcissism?</p>
<a>public speaking</a>, meeting people, emerging as a leader in groups, getting dates, and gaining followers on social media. It’s important to realize that narcissism has real benefits and real costs in order to fully understand it.

<p>Miscarriage can be a loss emotionally painful not just to an individual but to a couple and to a family. Although it is a common phenomenon, the lack of open discussion of loss can leave many struggling to navigate the emotional fallout.</p>
<p>First of all, what is the miscarriage map?</p>
<p>Why is the map important in understanding and dealing with the aftermath of miscarriage?</p>
<a>parenthood</a> and experience of loss. While the path to life after pregnancy loss is not certainly a linear one, the map provides readers with guidance and direction as they move through processing, gaining awareness, and healing.
<a>education</a>, but it also provides readers and helping professionals with practical ideas, exercises, and skills.
<p>What are common responses to miscarriage?</p>
<a>anger</a>, and confusion. Oftentimes, individuals can cycle through all of these emotions over the course of one day, perhaps even one hour, as they struggle to understand and process the reality of their experience.
<a>motivation</a>, a desire to isolate self, and difficulties feeling connected with others. It is important to note that the range of responses can vary based on the unique contextual factors of the individual.
<p>To what degree is the response to loss shared by both partners?</p>
<p>While research tells us that both the pregnant and non-pregnant partners are certainly impacted by pregnancy loss, their individual experience of the loss may differ based on cultural backgrounds,</p>
<p>personalities, and their unique ways of viewing the world. Therefore, while both partners will have their own emotional reactions to the loss, they may differ—and differ wildly.</p>
<p>What happens in the case of pregnancy loss from donated sperm?</p>
<p>What do you find is the most poignant aspect of working with women or couples who’ve experienced a pregnancy loss?</p>
<a>dreams</a>, the hopes, and the wishes you had for this child. Additionally, you may be confronted by numerous other losses along the way, such as a loss of financial security, a loss of a “healthy” physical
<a>identity</a>, loss of the “innocent, normal” experience of pregnancy, and the loss of membership in the hallowed parenthood club, just to name a few.
<p>Is there one thing that is most helpful to people recovering from pregnancy loss?</p>
<a>empathy</a>. It can be incredibly helpful to support and guide individuals in identifying the kind of support they need.
<p>What does recovering from pregnancy loss entail?</p>
<p>What are the hallmarks of recovery?</p>

<h3>What elements of nature and what elements of nurture seem to play important roles—and did you discern anything about the way they interact? </h3>
<p>Nature and nurture work together. Talent won’t go anywhere if you don’t practice. Potential also needs cultivating by parents, teachers, and mentors.</p>
<a>genes</a> make us who we are, but they don’t determine our thought processes or behavior. Environment matters, too.

<a>Depression</a>. Fleming’s discovery of penicillin might never have happened if he hadn’t left his lab dishes out on his worktable during summer vacation. Luck is often overlooked—but almost always essential.

<p>What inspired you to write a book about psychology for kids?</p>
<p>Your book focuses on teaching children principles of psychology rather than psychological skills for mental health. How did you make that decision?</p>
<a>mindfulness</a> and a calming “try this.” In the chapter, “What about when it all feels like too much?” we included a “try this” that presents CBT concepts and a “Did you know?” that introduces
<a>anger management</a> strategies.
<p>What are the most important principles of psychology that children need to know?</p>
<a>the environment</a> are topics that can be explored systematically.
<p>What is the advantage of young children knowing about psychology?</p>
<a>gender</a>, “society’s expectations," and "gender stereotypes” and why do young children need to know about them?
<p>The book is peppered with little “try this” experiments. How did you decide what kids could test for themselves? And what do you want them to get out of that?</p>
<p>Did you do any research beforehand on what kids most want or need to know about how people “work"? How did you decide what to cover?</p>
<a>self-concept</a> and environmental issues). We didn’t include some topics that we felt might not be as relevant to young readers and simplified others.
<p>There’s a chapter on “What Makes Me Me?” What do you think it’s especially important for kids to know about themselves and their identity? </p>
<p>This topic is of the utmost interest to kids in our target audience. Tweens and young teens are at a stage in life when they are working hard to define themselves. A peek at the research foundations of identity provides perspective and nuance.</p>
<p>If you had to limit yourself to one item, what one idea or insight would you like kids to get from this book?</p>
<a>memory</a> to conflict to development, and so forth.

<a>nervous system</a>, affecting how we navigate our world and continue to form our
<a>identity</a>. But they are not cast in stone. Positive connections with supportive attachment figures can help us deal with
<a>resilience</a> and strength. A brain scan study found that EFT for couples and the bonding events that occur in that therapy change the way women’s brains respond to a physical threat (click
<a>here</a> for a list of studies).
<p>How does this therapy differ from other types?</p>
<p>In general, EFT combines the clarity and focus typical of more behavioral interventions with the depth and relevance of more humanistic experiential therapies, allowing people to address deep existential fears and longings.</p>
<p>How does EFT, EFIT work for individuals as opposed to couples?</p>
<p>The theoretical frame and the core interventions are the same across modalities. However, the primary goal in EFIT is the expansion of the self rather than the shaping of more positive bonding connections with specific others in-session.</p>

<a>anger</a> and is able to confront her mother in an imagined encounter. Core ways of seeing herself, dealing with emotions, and engaging with others then start to shift.
<p>How do you use an emotional charge to turn around a client’s life?</p>
<a>grief</a> and aloneness. As she grieves, she finds compassion and respect for herself and a new determination to find connection. She tells me in the next session, “Now I have me so I can deal with that scene and not feel so devastated.”
<p>Why does the word “safe’ have such prominence in EFT?</p>
<p>What is the magic in therapy and how do you bring it about?</p>
<p>The “magic” of EFT is not just hearsay either; we can show it on tape, rate it, and show that it leads to specific kinds of change such as less depression.</p>
<p>How is it not the content of problems but how we engage with them that matters?</p>
<p>Are people looking to solve the wrong problems or in the wrong way?</p>
<p>What is one insight or idea would you like readers to get from this book?</p>
<p>I would like therapists to know that attachment science and a focus on <a>priming</a> and ordering core emotions is the way forward for <a>psychotherapy</a>. We already can integrate science and practice; we already know so much.</p>

<p>There are an awful lot of books about relationships. What makes your different?</p>
<p>What do partners most want from each other these days?</p>
<p>People are looking for relationships that provide daily life support but also the capacity to create meaning together. They are seeking belonging and purpose through their relationships.</p>
<p>.You say people must learn to make relationships work in a new way. What is that new way?</p>
<p>Where should people start who want their relationship to work?</p>
<p>Is there some particular trap that many couples fall into?</p>
<p>What do you think are the most important things people should look for in searching for a long-term mate?</p>
<p>You talk a lot about honoring oneself in a relationship. What do you mean and why is it important?</p>
<p>Given that interdependence is an important couples goal, what does healthy interdependence look like in a relationship?</p>
<p>What do you find is the most difficult relationship problem to solve?</p>
<p>Why do couples need to look back to move forward?</p>
<a>creativity</a>, and flexibility with our partner.
<p>What kinds of boundaries do couples need to set up in relationships?</p>

<p><a>Neurodiversity</a>—the idea that neurological diversity is a natural part of our species–has taken hold among many people diagnosed with autism, <a>ADHD</a>, dyslexia, and other conditions which have a strong heritable component.</p>
<p>The same is true for body size and type. Some people do better in small spaces or cold climates. Diversity is one of the attributes that allowed early man to colonize so much of the globe and be so successful.</p>
<p>That harsh natural selection is why human traits tend to cluster around a midpoint, and also why human diversity is self-limiting.</p>
<a>Psychiatric</a> diagnosis has certainly benefited many people, but the stigma and marginalization that accompanies those labels is a heavy burden indeed.
<a>shame</a> is set aside, and the person is free to interpret themselves as they choose.
<a>autistic</a> disability can be.
<p>Neurodivergence, on the other hand, is an <a>identity</a> a person adopts. Whether you are clinically diagnosed or you just see traits of autism or ADHD in yourself, you are free to say, “I identify as neurodivergent”.</p>

<p>“Believe in your heart. Believe in your heart that you're meant to live a life full of passion, purpose, magic and miracles.”—Roy T. Bennett </p>
<a>Seinfeld</a>, Parks and Recreation was another series that I watched repeatedly and now I am convinced Leslie is
<a>autistic</a>. She was passionate, quirky, obsessed with integrity, committed, and nobody could predict what she was going to do. It was also well known that whilst you didn't want to come up against her, she had a very good heart.
<p>“One person’s annoying is another person’s inspiring and heroic.”—Leslie Knope </p>
<a>career</a> and this is when I believe you hit a sweet spot in life. When the autistic traits and the societal expectations and requirements match, all can be well.
<p>“And that's the thing about people who mean everything they say. They think everyone else does too.”—Khaled Hosseini </p>
<a>grateful</a>, and eloquent resignation letters). Imagine a world, where employees in meetings cut to the chase, where people said what they meant, where people were enthused about their work, and high moral values and
<a>ethics</a> were valued above all else. That is what an autistic world would be like, that sounds like a sweet spot to me.

<h1> Is Police Abolition a Neurodiversity Issue, Too? </h1>
<h2> Understanding the policing and incarceration of neurodivergence. </h2>
<p>In recent months, largely in light of the protests against police brutality following the death of George Floyd, the proposal to defund or even abolish the police has been widely discussed (e.g., here or <a>here</a>). </p>
<a>neurodiversity</a> issue, too.
<h2>Death Following Police Encounters</h2>
<p>First consider how many neurodivergent people die following encounters with the police.</p>
<a>died during or following police contact in 2018/19</a> were described as having "mental health concerns" such as
<a>bipolar disorder</a>. The same report disclosed that three-quarters of people who committed
<a>suicide</a> directly following police contact similarly had disabilities including bipolar disorder or borderline
<a>gaslighting</a> that allows the practice to continue.
<a>vastly over-represented in the prison population</a>. While only around 1% of the population is
<a>autistic</a>, an estimated 9% of the prison population is.
<a>2012 report</a> on inmates in a prison in Chelmsford, U.K. Yet, dyslexia is associated with many
<a>cognitive strengths</a> as well as limitations—and there is no reason to think that its cognitive features make harming others or breaking the law more likely. Similarly, in their 2015 book
<a>2016 U.K. study</a> found that autistic people faced high levels of police
<a>discrimination</a> and that police received inadequate training regarding autism. Another
<a>recent report from the U.K</a>. found that the justice system limited access to justice by failing to make the appropriate accommodations required by neurodivergent individuals.
<a>stressed</a> by abolitionists is that "illegal" doesn't always mean "morally bad" and "legal" doesn't always mean "morally good." Historically, of course, slavery was legal, and escaping slavery was illegal. Today, what we
<a>count as crime</a> (and even
<a>how crime representations and statistics are produced</a>), is often biased in a way that tends to disadvantage groups that have less power.
<a>excluded from non-criminalised jobs</a> due to inaccessible workspaces. This is likely part of the reason many neurodivergent individuals work in criminalised or outlawed industries. For instance, many sex workers
<a>nothing morally wrong </a>with an adult consenting to sell one's labour in this way, but many sex work practices are criminalised or outlawed in neurotypical society nonetheless. Sex workers are also particularly at risk when it comes to
<a>interactions with the police</a>. The outlawing of outsider work is part of what leads to the criminalisation of neurominorities on a mass scale.
<a>limited capacity </a>of law enforcement to help female
<a>seven times more likely</a> to be sexually assaulted than members of the general population.
<a>towards reform</a> in recent years, hard questions need to be asked about whether it might be better for us if existing systems were abolished and replaced altogether.
