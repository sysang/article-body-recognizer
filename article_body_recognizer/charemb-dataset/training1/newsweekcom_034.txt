<p>"So far they've been a blessing. It got so bad earlier this year I took FMLA leave and they were gracious about my return and accommodations. I've had a lingering feeling that kindness was running low.. until today when it was confirmed."</p>
<p>The<a> woman noted that HR</a> put her on notice for using vacation time or occasionally working from home adding that they now want her to come into the office all the time.</p>

<p>Yellowstone Volcano's Norris Geyser Basin has risen by 1.5cm over the last few months and scientists are not exactly sure why.</p>
<p>The uplift was recorded by a GPS monitoring station near the geyser and Michael Poland, scientist in charge of Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, said it appears to have started in July.</p>
<p>"We've been monitoring the Norris region with GPS since the early 2000s, and before that we were also using satellite radar to see how the ground near Norris was moving," he told Newsweek.</p>
<p>"Uplift there is not unusual. In 1996-2004 there was a major episode of uplift. The region returned to episodes of uplift in 2013-2014, and in 2015-2018. So it's very common."</p>
<p>The Yellowstone Caldera has been subsiding since 2015, but this deformation tends to pause during the summer months. The ground beneath the surface can be thought of as a sponge, Poland said. As snowmelt seeps in, the ground "puffs up."</p>
<p>The expansion of the ground stops the deformation for a short period, before subsidence resumes when the "sponge" drains.</p>
<a>hydrothermal or magmatic processes</a> taking place deep below the surface.
<p>Hydrothermal fluids—water and gas—drive geyser and hot spring activity at the national park. These fluids contain dissolved minerals and when the water cools, the minerals drop out.</p>
<p>These minerals can then end up coating the subsurface pipes through which the water beneath the ground flows, similar to corroded pipes in a house. Changes to these conduits can then result in surface deformation.</p>
<p>This, Poland said, is the most likely cause of the uplift at Norris.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of hot water reaching the surface in that geyser basin. Norris is a dynamic place, with incredible geysers and amazing activity, and it's all because of the water that's moving around beneath the ground."</p>
<p>Research into the episode later showed water that would normally have flowed through the subsurface near Norris had been accumulating.</p>
<p>The last time magma was thought to be involved in uplift at the Norris Geyser Basin was between 1996 and 2004.</p>

<p>Over 150 bison have been filmed walking along a main road in Yellowstone as officials issue a warning that the winter migration has begun at the National Park.</p>
<p>Footage taken by YouTube user Broyles Outdoors from inside a car shows the herd making their way through traffic at the west entrance road.</p>
<p>"They keep coming, oh my gosh, this is crazy," one of the passengers says. "They could do some serious damage to our car."</p>
<p>As one particularly large bison approaches them, a male passenger says: "This is crazy ... This is a once in a lifetime, that's the Grand Poobah."</p>
<p>"He is massive, look how huge he is," the female passenger says.</p>
<p>This encounter followed a message from officials via the Yellowstone National Park Facebook page warning people that the onset of winter brings with it the movement of <a>bison</a>.</p>
<p>In 2020, the National Park Service counted 4,680 <a>bison in Yellowstone</a>.</p>
<p>These belonged to two primary breeding herds—the larger northern herd, with over 3,400 individuals, and the central herd, which has almost 1,250 bison.</p>
<p>The spokesperson said bison have injured more people at the park than any other animal. "Bison are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans," they said.</p>
<p>Bison gorings are recorded most years at the park. In 2020, a 72-year-old woman from California was <a>gored multiple times</a> after getting too close to the animal for photos.</p>
<p>"The series of events that led to the goring suggest the bison was threatened by being repeatedly approached to within 10 feet," Senior Bison Biologist Chris Geremia said in a statement.</p>
<p>Innovative, environmentally friendly transportation technology is planned to be tested in U.S. national parks as part of a pledge government officials signed Wednesday, the Associated Press reported.</p>
<p>Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Transportation Secretary <a>Pete Buttigieg</a> signed the pledge in an effort to improve tourists' experiences and to help curb some of the environmental impacts from a recent surge of visitors to national parks.</p>
<p>Another feature in development is a real-time information app, which would give park visitors notifications on road closures and parking, as well as guides to bus stops and rideshares for those who don't want to drive in.</p>
<p>Haaland told AP that the partnership can help to advance "innovations and access to public spaces."</p>
<p>For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> this week provides up to $1.5 billion a year for the National Park Service, as well as $200 million a year in discretionary grants aimed in part at addressing climate change and protecting wildlife.
<a>Congress</a> last year for long-deferred renovation projects in national parks, national forests and other sites that has spurred recent construction around the country, including the trail widening in Washington.
<p>The U.S. Forest Service Friday approved the resumption of drilling for gold in a mine west of Yellowstone National Park in Idaho, according to <a>The Associated Press</a>.</p>
<p>According to the company, the area contains about 825,000 ounces of gold and they plan to search for it by digging in an open-pit mine.</p>
<p>For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.</p>
<p>The Forest Service in its approval on Friday said 10 drill sites had been built before the lawsuit halted the project, so the latest approval is for 130 drill sites. The surface disturbance associated with the new plan is 22 acres (9 hectares).</p>
<p>Josh Johnson of the Idaho Conservation League said the group was reviewing the Forest Service's approval and keeping its options open.</p>
<p>"In general, we still have significant concerns regarding impact to water quality and wildlife from the proposed exploration project," he said.</p>
<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>No, You Cannot Drill Into Yellowstone Volcano to Stop an Eruption</h1><div> By Hannah Osborne <time>On 12/21/21 at 9:26 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<a>but it is still an active volcano, with huge magma chambers </a>deep beneath the surface and a hotbed of hydrothermal features.
<p>So what could be done to prevent an eruption? Michael Poland, the scientist-in-charge of Yellowstone Volcano Observatory (YVO) has considered this question in this week's Caldera Chronicles—a weekly column written by scientists working at the site.</p>
<p>"Moreover, the drill holes intended to tap the gasses in a magma reservoir would plug shut with dense taffy-like magma without constant intervention."</p>
<p>So you could not prevent an eruption through drilling or injecting the volcano with water, but could you set off an eruption with a nuclear bomb? That is also a no.</p>

<div><div>Newsletter</div><div><div><div>Best of Newsweek via email</div><p> Daily news headlines detailed briefings enjoyed by half a million readers.</p></div></div></div>
<div> Culture Work <a>Reddit</a> <a>Viral</a></div>
<p>Redditors came together to bash an employer after one user detailed the nightmarish interview that led to the withdrawal of their application and removing themselves from the company's consideration altogether.</p>
<p>Including a screenshot of an email they sent the employer following the interview, the Redditor revealed that the interviewer's behavior led them to seek employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>However, Dr. John Sullivan, a professor and corporate speaker and advisor at San Francisco State University says that shady interview tactics are the quickest way to lose potential employees.</p>
<a>wrote</a> that "most organizations seem to enjoy making their interviews highly stressful," but noted that "unnecessary stress hurts interviewee performance," and that "increasing transparency reduces most candidate stress."
<p>According to u/Fuzzy-Exchange9045, there was little transparency during their recent job interview, sparking other Redditors to take out their frustrations on the allegedly ill-prepared interviewer.</p>
<p>The post's top comment, which has received 3.5K votes itself, pointed out that one of the interviewer's questions comes with an obvious answer.</p>
<p>"Will you leave us if you get another job?," u/RaceOfBass wrote, with a hint of sarcasm. "Well, conventionally that's how it works, yes."</p>
<p>u/SavagePlatypus76 wrote that employers struggle to understand that many employees' main motivation is compensation and acknowledged a suspected sense of entitlement.</p>
<p>"Some of these employers are incredibly entitled. Like the world owes them loyal labor that will stay with them forever," they commented. "I am not a dog, I am a mercenary and I go where my fiscal and ethical requirements are met."</p>
<p>Another Redditor, u/i_just_had_too, wrote that they are honest with employers about their intentions to leave after a couple of years, and echoed the money-driven sentiments of u/SavagePlatypus76.</p>
<p>Cassidy Kulhanek graduated with a master's degree and then was rejected for 400 jobs.</p>
<p>Kulhanek, 28, of Chicago, spoke to Newsweek today after a tweet of hers from April 7, resurfaced on social media—mainly in Reddit's "antiwork" community, which has over 1.5 million members.</p>
<a>Reddit</a> user Sunday and has since been upvoted over 55,000 times. In her tweet, Kulhanek said, "After getting rejected from now over 200 jobs I applied to I can confidently say that getting a masters was the biggest mistake I ever made."
<p>Kulhanek told Newsweek she posted the tweet about halfway through her job search, which ultimately lasted about a year. She said she was eventually rejected for about 400 jobs during the entire span of her search.</p>
<p>Currently, she is an art consultant who loves her job—which she said "has radically changed" her quality of living since being hired in August.</p>
<p>She now has more time and energy for her passions, which include comedy and art. She doesn't have "that sinking feeling of being a failure anymore."</p>
<p>But it took a difficult path of realization to get to where she is now.</p>
<p>In undergrad she double-majored in studio art and German language studies, later working as an assistant preparator at a local museum.</p>
<p>She then received her master's in studio art from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. It wasn't long until one employer after another passed on her, causing depression, frustration and making her feel "very foolish."</p>
<p>"I worked retail and restaurant jobs all through undergrad and grad school, and I found myself wondering if I would eventually have to returnn to the service industry to make ends meet again."</p>
<p>Master's degrees from public institutions typically cost approximately $27,000 less than degrees from private institutions. Receiving a master's is usually a two-year process.</p>
<p>The total loan volume for 2020-21 decreased overall, though the graduate total increased slightly by a little over $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>"Traditionally, the higher level of attainment the more money you're supposed to make," Bass said. "Based on these numbers from 2020, that held true even with the pandemic."</p>
<p>It depends on industry and occupation, he added, but wouldn't be surprised to see an increase in graduate enrollment when the newest data is released for the current academic year.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has changed work, or the idea of work. The "antiwork" subreddit has stemmed from the movement of giving employees more power.</p>
<p>Some replies involving Kulhanek's tweet sarcastically mention companies "desperately" needing employees, but not paying fair-enough wages to hire them.</p>
<p>Another user said education is only a small piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>"Everyone I know who's found a job in the last few years got it through somebody who knew somebody," the user commented. "Zero jobs were found through online applications."</p>
<p>Other users also questioned Kulhanek's motives for getting a master's degree in an art-related field—which even she admits is not entirely off-base.</p>
<p>The messages she received from strangers ranged from very supportive and encouraging, to being "mocked pretty relentlessly" and called various names.</p>
<p>She added that even though she only had to pay for one semester of her master's program, she still went nearly $20,000 in debt. Due to student loan payments being postponed again, she is not sweating it—at least right now.</p>
<p>Updated 12/27/2021, 3:08 p.m. ET: This story has been updated with comments from Jared Bass and additional information. </p>
<p>Thousands of Redditors came to the defense of one user after they claimed they were berated for requesting "a livable wage" during a job interview.</p>
<p>While the <a>federal minimum wage</a> in the United States remains at $7.25, many states have moved closer to the highly-debated $15 mark. In July, <a>Washington D.C.</a> increased its minimum wage to $15.20.</p>
<a>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, however, $15 per hour is unlikely to provide a livable wage for individuals, and even less likely for families. In February,
<a>CNBC</a> used the data compiled by MIT to reveal that $15 per hour is 41 cents under the "living wage" mark for single adults, and much less than the living wage for those trying to support a family.
<p>u/scubasteve2242 said that, despite the heated exchange about pay expectations, the interviewer requested a second interview, but acknowledged that they have no plans to move forward with any potential employment.</p>
<p>"I am NOT proceeding with this and I'm going to tell her exactly how I feel if she tries to contact me again," they wrote. "I genuinely didn't even know what to say because the benefits don't put food on the table or pay my car payment."</p>
<p>The <a>original post</a>, titled 'Bombed a phone interview by requesting a livable wage,' has received nearly 22,000 votes and more than 2,000 comments in just six hours, and sparked an intense conversation about livable wages in the United States.</p>
<p>u/scubasteve24222 blasted the interviewer for suggesting that $15 per hour was unreasonable, and expressed their frustration with employers as a whole.</p>
<p>"How do these people expect us to function as grown adults with $12 an hour?," they asked.</p>
<p>Other Redditors took notice of u/scubasteve2422's original post and echoed their sentiments about low wages and employers' alleged misunderstandings about employees' motivations.</p>
<p>"I don't understand the logic. Promises of promotions and raises are great, but how am I supposed to survive on poverty wages in the meantime," questioned u/idreaminwords in a comment that has received 8.3K votes itself.</p>
<p>"Why is it the prospective employee's fault?," u/ACrucialTech chimed in. "'We want people who don't care so much about the wage.' Well then why are they in business? They should be listed as a charity then."</p>
<p>u/spongeworth90, who said they have only had one company be honest with them about potential pay, said that the situation detailed in the original post is ridiculous, and said that wage transparency should be a part of the job interview process.</p>
