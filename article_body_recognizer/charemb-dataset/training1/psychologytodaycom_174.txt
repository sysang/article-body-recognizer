<a>more depression and anxiety</a> with increased news consumption. Even before the pandemic started, Lebanese research participants had more
<a>depression</a>, anxiety, and
<a>insomnia</a> when they had more
<a>problematic social media use</a>.
<p>So it shouldn’t be a shock that doomscrolling isn’t good for us. And unlike other unhealthy things in large quantities, like candy and fried foods, doomscrolling doesn’t even feel good. So why can’t we stop? </p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Shutterstock/eldar nurkovic</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Doomscrolling gives us a sense of control.</p>
<p>In this way, doomscrolling is similar to worrying. We do it compulsively because it gives us a false sense of control.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, something rewarding keeps us hooked.</p>
<p>We crave connection in a time when there isn’t much.</p>
<a>rage</a>-tweeting about something awful and outside of our control, we want to connect with it—and with hundreds of other similar posts—as we keep scrolling.
<p>How to Interrupt Doomscrolling</p>
<p>So how do you put down the phone and make it out of the doomscrolling fog in one piece? How do you keep the habit from doing you more harm than good?</p>
<p>The goal here is not to crawl under a rock and pretend that everything is peachy and never look at the news again. Nor is it to disconnect from the social and political happenings that require our participation now more than ever.</p>
<p>Being informed and participating in civic life is important. Interacting with friends is important. Enjoying <a>memes</a> is important! We all need a little <a>laughter</a> these days.</p>
<p>But let’s do it in a way that is intentional, that creates value for our lives, and not in a way that just makes us depressed and comatose. Here’s how.</p>
<p>1. Go to newsfeeds and social media with a specific purpose.</p>
<p>Many of us participate in infinite-scroll mode out of muscle <a>memory</a>, where our thumbs just scroll and our eyes just scan simply because you don’t have a more pressing thing to do.</p>
<p>Instead, have a purpose in mind. Here are a few examples.</p>
<li>Go to your news sources to see what a particular politician’s campaign message is</li>
<li>Go to Facebook to ask your gardening group about their favorite plants</li>
<li>Go to Twitter to see the latest science news from your favorite scientist</li>
<li>Go to Instagram to see pictures of your friend’s new baby</li>
<p>If you scroll with a purpose, you’ll end up being engaged with something you care about rather than passively drawn down the doom-and-gloom rabbit hole.</p>
<p>2. Set a time limit and designate a time of day.</p>
<a>recent study</a> found that 2.5 hours of media consumption was the threshold (at least for German adults) between having mild depressive symptoms versus moderate depressive symptoms. Another
<a>large-scale study</a> with Russian adults found that more than 30 minutes of coronavirus-specific news consumption led to significant increases in anxiety. Let this guide you in setting a time limit for yourself!
<p>3. Connect with people one-on-one.</p>
<p>Have you ever stepped outside after a long day in the office (or house) and felt like you were suddenly waking up after a long, disorienting nap? In a way, you were.</p>
<a>therapy</a> is sometimes used to treat depression.
<p>Even on an overcast day, it’s usually much brighter outside than inside. So get out there!</p>
<p>5. Get in touch with yourself.</p>
<a>lonely</a> and haven’t talked to your family in a while. You may not even realize that obsessively doomscrolling is your mind’s way of trying, and probably failing, to fill a hole.

<h1> Racism's Effects on Black Mental Health </h1>
<h2> An unflinching look at the ways racism affects Black mental health. </h2>
<p> Posted October 7, 2020 </p>
<p>In 2020, the wounds of racism have been publicly opened, again and again, reminding those of us who are privileged that people who experience racism don’t get to look away or forget.</p>
<p>Racism is detrimental to mental health</p>
<p>This one is pretty obvious. After all, racism is the sum of ways that society discriminates and commits violence against Black people. It withholds justice, fairness, and resources. It demeans and gaslights. </p>
<a>2018 briefing paper</a> by the Synergi Collaborative Center introduced the existing research well. In brief, experiencing racism makes a person more likely to have
<a>mega-study</a>. They found that experiencing racism is associated with poorer physical and mental health. The negative effect on mental health (including depression,
<a>anxiety</a>, and psychological
<a>stress</a>) was especially strong.
<a>kids and adolescents</a>, experiencing racism comes with more depressive symptoms, lower
<a>self-esteem</a>, and more displays of “bad behavior.” Even when kids don't directly experience racism, their parents’ experience of
<a>discrimination</a> makes the kids more likely to have
<a>anxiety and depression</a>. In teens,
<a>over a hundred studies</a> have found that experiencing racism is significantly associated with poorer mental health.
<p>There’s no debate that racism affects mental health. But it is interesting to note how. </p>
<p>How does racism hurt Black and African American mental health?</p>
<p>Scholars on this topic have discussed a number of ways that <a>racism can affect mental health</a>. Here’s a look at five: </p>
<a>systemic bias</a>. You may put your empty hands up to show that you’re not a threat and still be a victim of brutality.
<p>And it’s not only each individual racist encounter that causes stress. When the effort-reward connection is shattered time and again, a person begins to <a>lose their sense of control</a> over their life and fate.</p>
<a>believe racial stereotypes about themselves</a>. Even without consciously realizing it, you begin to absorb the idea, and it affects your sense of self.
<p>This process is called internalization. For marginalized people, <a>internalizing society’s negative attitudes</a> about them creates stress and lowers self-esteem while allowing for feelings of shame and <a>humiliation</a> to take root. </p>
<a>Epigenetics</a> boils down to environments and experiences “getting under the skin” by changing the way our
<a>genes</a> are expressed and passed on.
<a>similar to people who have PTSD</a>. This makes these children
<a>more vulnerable</a> to developing anxiety or trauma-related disorders themselves. This is part of why
<a>Black veterans are more likely to have PTSD</a> than their white counterparts who served in the same wars.
<a>American Psychiatric Association</a>, only one in three African Americans who need mental healthcare receives it. One barrier is Black Americans’ understandable
<a>listen less and talk more</a> when their patient is Black. Even after being diagnosed, Black Americans are less likely than their white peers to
<a>receive evidence-based and guideline-consistent care</a>.

<p>Mental health resources for Black people</p>
<a>attention</a> to Black mental health, and some leaders in the field have been establishing initiatives to help. For example, Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed psychologist and popular speaker, has started a movement called
<a>Therapy for Black Girls</a>. This is the name of her fantastic podcast, as well as the online space she has created to host resources and a community to promote the mental wellness of Black women and girls.
<a>Souls of Black Men</a>, a fact sheet based on conversations between Black men about mental health issues organized by the Black Mental Health Alliance for
<p>Where do we go from here?</p>
<a>buffering against the toxic effects of racism</a> and becoming
<a>less defensive about racism</a>.

<p>Is this a scene from a great horror movie or something more ominous? </p>

<a>sleep disorder</a> (or symptom of a sleep disorder) that temporarily alters a person’s mobility, perception, thinking, and emotional state during the transition between
<a>psychiatric</a> diagnosis, your chances of experiencing it go up to almost 1 in 3.
<p>Rest assured, sleep paralysis is usually harmless, especially if it only happens rarely. But why does it happen at all, when is it cause for concern, and how can you prevent it?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Shutterstock/Andrey_Popov</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Why does sleep paralysis happen?</p>
<p>You’re typically not aware of it, but the “paralysis” part of sleep paralysis actually happens every night when you sleep during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.</p>
<a>dreaming</a> happens, along with a lot of emotional processing that the brain does behind the scenes.
<a>fear</a>, and sometimes even a feeling of impending death. No wonder people around the world have mistaken sleep paralysis for a demonic attack!
<p>What makes some people more prone to sleep paralysis?</p>
<p><a>Anxiety</a> and trauma-related disorders</p>
<a>social anxiety</a>, you may be at higher risk for sleep paralysis. Having experienced trauma or having post-

<p>How to prevent sleep paralysis</p>
<p>1. Keep a consistent sleep-wake schedule and get enough sleep.</p>
<p>This “REM rebound” can happen when you’re consistently not getting enough sleep, or your <a>circadian rhythm</a> is thrown off by jet lag, shift work, or not sticking to a regular sleep-wake schedule.</p>

<h1> How to Manage Dissociating </h1>
<h2> Dissociation is one of those things everyone has heard of but few can define. </h2>
<p>Think about all the times you’ve had to read a text over because your mind was elsewhere, or you pulled into your driveway with no memory of the actual drive home. That’s dissociation and it happens to everyone at least sometimes. </p>
<p>Dissociation is detachment, whether from your body, your emotions, or your surroundings. It’s the opposite of being present in the here and now.</p>
<a>panic</a> would otherwise overwhelm you. This means that in the short-term, dissociation can be necessary for survival.
<a>traumatic</a> injuries. They were assessed during admission and within one month, and then re-assessed three months later. They found that those who had more panic symptoms immediately after their injury
<a>sexual abuse</a>, the more they dissociated, the more they were also
<a>likely to hurt themselves as adults</a>.
<p>It’s as if the initial tapping out of reality only postponed the psychological pain, making it worse later.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Shutterstock/Song_about_summer</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>What does dissociation feel like?</p>
<p>There are two most common forms of dissociation: depersonalization and derealization. Both depersonalization and derealization exist on a spectrum. If you’ve ever stared into a campfire or a strobe light, you may have glimpsed how this feels.</p>
<a>derealization during sex</a>, and this can contribute to having
<a>sexual</a> dysfunction disorders.
<p>How does dissociation work in the brain?</p>
<a>hyperactive</a>, but when something
<a>stressful</a> happens, it actually doesn’t activate as much as it should. There’s also
<a>less of a feedback loop</a> in this brain system that tells it to take a breather after it’s been activated for too long.
<p>Another difference lies in the limbic system, the emotion-processing center of the brain. This area is also less activated than it should be during dissociation, showing again how the brain “<a>zones out</a>.”</p>
<p>How to stop <a>dissociating</a></p>
<p>If you feel yourself dissociating, how do you bring yourself back?</p>
<a>PTSD</a>, and both are treatable. The good news is that when treatment specifically addresses dissociation,
<a>people can respond quite well</a>.
<p>For everyday groundedness, try these three tips.</p>
<a>attention</a> to how your feet feel pressing on the floor. Name five things you can see right now. In short, use your body! Gain some traction by feeling, seeing, hearing, smelling, and tasting your here and now.
<p>2. Pay close attention to your breathing</p>
<p>3. Choose an object to keep you in the present</p>
<p>Dissociation is varied and there’s no one-size-fits-all solution for those experiencing it. For more information, check out some <a>FAQs</a> from experts at the International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation.</p>

<h6> <a> Mindfulness </a> </h6>
<h1> What Mindfulness Can (and Can't) Do for Us </h1>
<h2> Mindfulness is great, but not a one-size-fits-all solution to life's problems. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Mindfulness? </li> <li> <a>Find a mindfulness-based counsellor</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Recently, an acquaintance of mine got into <a>mindfulness meditation</a> and is now spreading the gospel that meditating every day has not only made her happier and more productive, it’s even helped her heal injuries.</p>
<p>Hold up. Heal injuries? How?</p>
<a>attention</a> on the cut twice per day. The thumb scabbed over and healed within a couple of days. She felt that was a lot faster and less painful than usual.
<p>“You also cleaned the cut to prevent infection, right?” I asked.</p>
<p>“No, no, you don’t need that," she said. "Your body will always heal itself if you really meditate mindfully.”</p>
<p>While I’m pleased my friend is in good spirits and experiencing less discomfort, her <a>mindfulness</a>-is-a-cure-all stance had me a bit more than concerned. And she isn’t the only one jumping on the mindfulness-fixes-everything train.</p>
<p>The popularity of mindfulness</p>
<a>reduce cancer-related symptoms</a>,
<a>improve the childbirth experience</a>,
<a>reduce stress and increase empathy</a>, and
<a>promote healthier eating habits</a>. Nowadays, as more and more of us mental health professionals are incorporating it into our therapies, it’s hard to talk to a therapist without mindfulness coming up.
<p>But is there the chance we’re all getting a bit too carried away? Is mindfulness really a cure-all?</p>
<p>What mindfulness is... and isn't</p>
<a>philosophy</a> and a practice. I say this as both a clinical scientist and as a person who practices mindfulness daily. It’s really been helpful through chronic back pain and
<p>Mindfulness is not (necessarily) meditation</p>
<p>This one is important. Mindfulness and meditation are not one and the same.</p>
<p>Of course, you can definitely practice mindfulness using meditation. One of my favorite meditations is the Mindful Breathing practice. You simply breathe and pay attention to your breath without judgment. That’s all it takes.</p>
<div> <h2>Mindfulness Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>The Benefits of Mindfulness in Children</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Mindfulness Is Not Always Positive</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Shutterstock/Courtesy of thka</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Mindfulness is not a cure-all</p>
<a>performance-boosting programs</a>. Lots of headlines make it seem like mindfulness is the miracle elixir for all of our ills, from low
<a>motivation</a> to anxiety to
<p>But mindfulness is not a cure-all.</p>
<a>stress</a>.” Less catchy, but more of the whole picture.
<p>So I like to think of mindfulness as a healthy start—a way for us to connect non-judgmentally with our bodies and minds so we’re not struggling against ourselves when we’re in pain or feeling at odds with ourselves. </p>
<p>Mindfulness does not and should not replace your doctor’s advice or other standard treatments</p>
<p>When it comes to serious <a>psychiatric</a> conditions, there is some evidence that mindfulness can <a>decrease symptoms of psychosis</a>, but this more applies to improving motivation and daily functioning, not so much hallucinations or delusions.</p>
<p>Mindfulness does not sweep away <a>trauma</a></p>
<a>childhood</a> abuse, you know that trauma leaves its mark on your body and mind. Even if you don’t have full-blown posttraumatic stress disorder (
<a>PTSD</a>), you may have problems like always feeling on edge, having unexplained pain or other physical symptoms, having a hard time handling difficult emotions, or not
<p>Mindfulness is not a tool for patching up physical, mental, or <a>spiritual</a> problems</p>
<p>Mindfulness is about paying attention</p>
<p>To sum up, mindfulness is powerful. It can serve as a solid foundation for self-awareness and well-being. But it won’t solve all your problems and it’s a philosophy to be cultivated. </p>

<h1> What Pop Culture Gets Wrong About Therapy </h1>
<h2> A real-life, down-to-earth overview of what therapy is really like. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Therapy? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Or perhaps you think of that <a>scene in Good Will Hunting</a>, where Robin Williams’ character, a therapist, keeps repeating "It's not your fault," until his patient breaks down and cries in his arms.</p>
<p>In real life, therapy isn’t like the movies. At least not the vast majority of the time.</p>
<p>Maybe our imaginations run wild about what happens in therapy because it seems so mysterious. I mean, what could two strangers possibly talk about for an entire hour every week? </p>
<a>confidence</a> it will work, or go into it expecting a quick solution to all of life’s problems, only to end up disappointed. While therapists aren’t miracle workers, we do know from plenty of research that
<a>psychotherapy</a> is effective for:
<li>Decreasing symptoms of <a>anxiety disorders</a> and <a>obsessive-compulsive disorder</a> (OCD)</li>
<li>Helping people <a>overcome trauma</a></li>
<li>Improving the <a>quality of life</a> in general</li>
<p>In my clinical experience, I've seen patients make life-changing decisions, repair flawed relationships, overcome fears, and learn to value themselves in a way they never knew existed.</p>
<p>Let’s demystify therapy. The more you understand what it’s all about, the more likely it is that you’ll take advantage of this potentially life-changing experience.</p>
<p>Three reasons for seeking therapy</p>
<p>First, we can’t assume that everybody has the same ideas about why therapy exists.</p>
<p>For individuals, therapy is about working collaboratively with a professional who is trained in psychology to improve functioning. </p>
<p>I tend to think of three major reasons for doing psychotherapy:</p>
<p>1. Getting emotional support during a troublesome time</p>
<p>Moving away from home, grieving a death, adjusting to a serious diagnosis, losing a relationship. I can’t think of a single person in my life who has completely avoided all of the lemons life hands us.</p>
<p>2. Gaining insight about the self or about a specific life problem</p>

<p>Maybe you’ve been doing some self-reflection and noticed that you always have trouble saying “no.” Why are you afraid that you’ll let people down? </p>
<p>Or maybe the latest in a string of explosive breakups hurt more than usual and you’re wondering why you always end up with people who are bad for you.</p>
<p>Or maybe you’re trying to decide whether you should have kids or not, and you’ve exhausted all of your pros and cons list-making abilities without getting to the root of why this question tortures you so much.</p>
<p>Or a therapist can use their knowledge and experience to catch red flags. Like connecting the dots between your inability to relax with some troubling ways you talk about your partner. </p>
<p>3. Reducing psychological symptoms that get in the way of your life</p>
<p>Of course, on top of normal life stressors and emotional hangups—and who doesn’t have those?—some of us also have psychological disorders or symptoms.</p>

<p>Different types of therapy and how they help</p>
<p>Not all therapy looks the same—and how could it when we all have different psychological needs? There are a lot of forms of therapy out there, but these are the main categories you’ll find being practiced today. </p>
<a>empathic</a> ear to hear their story.
<a>depression</a>, supportive therapy can be helpful, especially because a big chunk of why people’s depression gets better with therapy is from
<a>“non-specific factors”</a> like trusting the therapist and feeling like someone cares.
<p><a>Psychoanalysis</a>, psychodynamic therapy, and insight-oriented therapy</p>
<a>Freud</a>’s theories of the
<a>unconscious</a> in the late 1800s. The main idea is that we have unconscious drives versus conscious thoughts, and when there are conflicts between the two, issues arise.
<a>childhood</a>. They can be helpful for the second reason for psychotherapy I mentioned—gaining insight about the self.
<p>Research shows that psychoanalysis has, on average, small to medium effects for improving symptoms and functioning, but is not as effective when compared to other therapies that are <a>designed to treat specific mental disorders</a>.</p>
<p><a>Cognitive-behavioral</a> therapies (CBT)</p>
<p>Cognitive-behavioral therapies are designed to treat specific symptoms like <a>social anxiety</a>, depression, <a>insomnia</a>, tinnitus, the list goes on. We keep inventing new CBTs for various psychological and physical problems.</p>
<a>anxiety</a> disorders, lingering effects of psychological
<a>obsessive-compulsive</a> disorder (OCD), and insomnia. You may be surprised at how quickly your symptoms can change.
<p>Third-wave psychotherapies</p>
<p>I know the name sounds very flower child, but third-wave psychotherapies are really just variations on CBT with an added central component—<a>mindfulness</a>.</p>
<a>chronic illness</a> or stress, financial issues, estranged relationships,
<a>burnout</a>, or just the general sense that life feels like a struggle and
<a>happiness</a> seems hard to reach.

<h1> How to Use Light to Beat the Winter Blues </h1>
<h2> Light has wonderful properties to help raise your mood and energy levels. </h2>
<p> Posted January 14, 2021 </p>
<p>Is it winter blues or seasonal affective disorder (SAD)?</p>
<p>For about 3 percent of people, this mood downturn is so severe that they have something called seasonal affective disorder (SAD). They <a>not only feel blue but they also experience</a>:</p>
<li>Loss of interest in things they usually like</li>
<li>Unusual tiredness or sluggishness</li>
<li>Difficulty <a>sleeping</a></li>
<li>A tendency to overeat and gain weight</li>
<li>An inability to concentrate </li>
<li>Feelings of hopelessness, or sometimes even having <a>suicidal</a> thoughts</li>
<p>What is it about the colder months that brings about the blues? Is there a way to beat it? </p>
<p>Our mood is intimately tied to light</p>
<a>depression</a>. The people most susceptible to winter-induced depression are those living far from the equator. Living farther away from the equator means you get fewer daylight hours in the wintertime.
<a>less sunlight leads to a drop in serotonin</a>, a brain chemical that's important for regulating mood.
<p>Artificial light can boost mood and keep winter blues at bay</p>
<a>decrease symptoms of SAD</a>. Ideally, you’ll want a full spectrum light source, such as a lightbox designed for this treatment. But even a very bright bulb from the hardware store can help.
<a>an overcast day is about 1000 lux</a>.
<a>therapy</a> improves your mood by regulating your
<a>circadian rhythms</a> and increasing serotonin. What’s especially great about this treatment is that it can be easily combined with medications or other treatments without interfering or introducing side effects. Even for those with
<a>year-round depression</a>, bright light therapy (combined with taking an
<a>antidepressant</a>) can provide an extra mood boost.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Svetlana Lukienko/Shutterstock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Bright light therapy can also help with sleep and daytime fatigue</p>
<a>later chronotypes</a>, meaning that they are biologically wired to want to sleep and wake later than the average person. This makes for a double whammy in the winter—they have both a depressed mood and a harder time getting up in the morning.
<p>But doing bright light therapy immediately upon waking can help to <a>shift night owls’ biological clocks earlier</a>, improving their quality of sleep at night and impacting how alert and refreshed they feel in the morning.</p>
<a>Parkinson’s disease</a> and
<a>Alzheimer’s dementia</a>, and for those
<p>Too much of a good thing (at the wrong time) can be counter-productive</p>
<p>Now that I’ve touted the magical properties of light, you might be thinking you should be exposed whenever you can. Not so fast—timing is actually crucial for light therapy.</p>
<a>harder time falling asleep</a> or getting into a deep sleep.
<a>brighter environments at night</a>. This was true even after the scientists accounted for sleep, physical activity, and other health factors that might affect depression.

<h1> Parasomnias: 6 Strange, Sometimes Creepy Sleep Phenomena </h1>
<h2> These sleep disorders range from common occurrences to the truly bizarre. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> Why Is Sleep Important? </li> <li> <a>Find a sleep counsellor near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>1. Sleepwalking (somnambulism)</p>
<a>enough injury</a> to need medical
<a>attention</a>, like one patient who jumped out of a third-floor window while totally asleep. The puzzling thing is that most sleepwalkers don't feel pain while sleepwalking, even if they're already in harm’s way.
<a>strong positive emotions</a>. That doesn’t mean you should avoid things that bring you joy, but consider
<a>meditation</a> or a wind-down period before bed to help you reach a state of emotional balance before you head off to dreamland.
<p>2. Sleep-related <a>eating disorder</a> </p>
<p>Closely related to sleepwalking is sleep-eating, where someone involuntarily eats food while sleepwalking.</p>
<a>more awareness</a> during sleep-eating episodes than regular sleepwalkers. This can lead to significant weight gain because those who have a sleep-related eating disorder cannot control their food intake during the night.
<p>3. REM-behavior <a>sleep disorder</a> (RBD)</p>
<p>Here’s a disorder that often is disguised as sleepwalking: <a>REM-behavior sleep disorder</a>. </p>
<a>dreaming</a> and acting out whatever is happening in their dream—usually an action like fighting or running, though sometimes it can also be a sophisticated behavior like playing the piano.
<p>Usually, your brain "turns off" your muscles (something called "REM atonia") so you don’t act out your dreams. With RBD, this safety mechanism fails and the dream spills over into the body, playing it like a puppet.</p>
<p>4. Sleep terrors (a.k.a. night terrors) and nightmares</p>
<div> <h2>Sleep Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Sleep Is Nature's Medicine</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>How to Power Through the Afternoon Slump</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>Sleep terrors seem, well, terrifying. You might burst out of bed, screaming and inconsolable for a few seconds or even minutes.</p>
<a>Nightmares</a> are dreams that are disturbing, sometimes scary enough to wake us up in a
<a>panic</a>, and might even affect our mood the next day. These typically happen in the second half of the night because dreaming happens largely during REM sleep.
<p>What to do about it: While common in young children, sleep terrors are not harmful, and they’re often scarier for parents than for the kids themselves, who don’t even remember their nighttime horrors the next day.</p>
<p>5. Sleep paralysis and hypnogogic/hypnopompic hallucinations</p>
<p>If you’ve ever woken up completely unable to move, and perhaps felt a heaviness on your chest and a sense of <a>fear</a> or doom, you have experienced a sleep paralysis episode.</p>
<a>Sleep paralysis</a> and related hallucinations have even spawned alien abduction theories.
<p>What to do about it: Just like for most other parasomnias, consistently getting enough sleep, keeping a steady sleep schedule, and avoiding substances could help.</p>
<p>6. Exploding head syndrome</p>
<h3>Parasomnia tips roundup</h3>
<li>Ensure safety. Lock doors and put away car keys, keep sharp objects out of reach, and if necessary, sleep in a separate room from your partner.</li>
<li>Stabilize your sleep schedule. By keeping a steady biological clock, you can help your brain to transition between sleep and wake normally.</li>
<li>Get enough sleep. Sleep deprivation is a common trigger for parasomnias like sleep paralysis. </li>
<li>Minimize alcohol and drugs. Substances that affect your brain function can affect your sleep and dreaming, too.</li>
<li>Ask your doctor about your medications. Sometimes, medications prescribed for insomnia, <a>depression</a>, or other psychological disorders might induce parasomnias as a side effect. </li>
<a>psychiatric</a> condition, which also requires specialized care. Getting a full work-up with a sleep specialist can help to either reassure you or point you toward the right treatment.

<h1> How to Recognize Dark Triad Personality Traits </h1>
<h2> Why are traits like psychopathy and narcissism so destructive to relationships? </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Psychopathy? </li> <li> <a>Find a counsellor who understands personality disorders</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>Machiavellianism</a>, psychopathy, and narcissism. Learning to recognize five harmful patterns can minimize the likelihood of entering into an unhealthy relationship.
<a>fear</a> of the unknown, the ones where
<a>three personalities tend to run together</a> and cause trouble in relationships.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Shutterstock/Estrada Anton</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In a self-report questionnaire of the dark triad personality traits, items for measuring Machiavellianism include:</p>
<ul><li>"It’s <a>wise</a> to keep track of information that you can use against people later."</li> <li>"Whatever it takes, you must get the important people on your side."</li> <li>"I use insincere flattery to get my way."</li> </ul>
<a>serial killers</a> à la Charles Manson and Ed Kemper. But psychopathy is a spectrum, and we're all on it. People who have a high level of psychopathy have low
<a>empathy</a> for others, are callous in their actions, and tend to be reckless and
<p>Psychopaths might agree with statements like:</p>
<ul><li>"Payback needs to be quick and nasty."</li> <li>"People often say I’m out of control."</li> <li>"I enjoy having <a>sex</a> with people I hardly know."</li> </ul>
<p>Of course, this is not to say that everyone who participates in casual sex with strangers has high levels of psychopathy. A <a>psychopathic</a> portrait would also include many hints of high risk-taking together with a lack of empathy. </p>
<a>narcissistic</a>, we mean something more than just vanity. Someone with high levels of narcissism feels entitled to adoration, power, and high status, so much so that if they don’t get these things, they may lash out.
<p>They might agree with statements like:</p>
<ul><li>"Many group activities are dull without me."</li> <li>"I have a natural talent for influencing people."</li> <li>"I like being the center of <a>attention</a>."</li> </ul>
<p>If they don’t get the attention they crave, they might, for example, lie about how many gifts they received for their birthday. </p>

<p>Dark Triad Relationship Patterns</p>
<p>There are five destructive patterns you can take note of to recognize people high on the continuum of dark triad traits.</p>
<p>When you catch a partner with these traits in a lie, you might begin to sense that something doesn’t add up. These erosions of trust, whether big or small, can start to chip away at your sense of security.</p>
<p>3. <a>Jealousy</a> and <a>revenge</a></p>
<p>Those with the dark triad tend to have higher levels of <a>preventive jealousy</a>—that is, feeling jealous before they’ve been given reason to—than the average person.</p>
<a>take revenge</a>, like shouting at their partner or spreading a rumor about them.
<a>emotional control</a> over their partner for control's sake rather than doing hurtful things only as an impulsive reaction.
<p>4. Superficial relationships</p>
<p>Given their lack of true emotional devotion, people high on the <a>dark triad scale don’t tend to choose serious, committed relationships</a>.</p>
<a>dating</a> for fun, friends-with-benefits, and other not-so-serious “romances.” At different times in our lives, we have different needs, and most of us have probably had relationships that were never meant for a serious commitment.
<a>tends to go with booty calls</a>.
<a>play wingman</a> and help them hook up with potential mates.
<p>5. Relationships that don’t last</p>
<p>With all these not-so-glowing findings to recommend them, it’s no surprise that people with high dark triad traits <a>don’t tend to have long-lasting relationships</a>. </p>
<a>agreeableness</a>—warmth, friendliness, tact—is the one thing most people with these traits lack.

<h6> <a> Compassion Fatigue </a> </h6>
<h1> Feeling Empathy Burnout? Protect Yourself from Fatigue </h1>
<h2> Compassion fatigue is a natural reaction for those in helping professions. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Compassion Fatigue? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>COVID-19</a> crisis. They’ve worked around the clock and I can’t help but think about the amount of chronic
<a>trauma</a>, they must be going through. They’ve fought for patients’ lives, for adequate equipment, and against conspiracy theories. It’s no wonder that many are
<p>What is <a>compassion fatigue</a>?</p>
<a>child protection workers</a> and
<a>mental healthcare providers</a>. Compassion fatigue might be on the rise for healthcare workers, but those outside the profession can be affected, too; people with high levels of empathy almost can’t help but feel others’ pain.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Shutterstock/Syda Productions</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>How to protect yourself from compassion fatigue</p>
<a>hormones</a> and having the fight-or-flight system on high alert.
<p>Some other signs of compassion fatigue include:</p>
<li>Trouble <a>sleeping</a> (can’t quiet thoughts, feeling too wound up, easily woken).</li>
<li>Irritability, impatience, blaming others.</li>
<li>Dreading going to work (or finding yourself often late for work or calling in sick).</li>
<li>Having a hard time finding meaning in your life or work.</li>
<li>Having unexplained physical symptoms (such as exacerbated pain, acne flare-ups, GI problems).</li>
<li>Feeling isolated or wanting to isolate from others.</li>
<li>Feeling helpless, hopeless, or both.</li>
<li>Struggling to make decisions.</li>
<p>If you’re experiencing a few of these, chances are good that you’re experiencing compassion fatigue.</p>
<a>burned out</a>, we neglect the basics—water, food, sunlight, oxygen. It can almost feel silly to say it, but a powerful reset button for your body and mind can simply be one weekend of:
<li>Carrying a water bottle everywhere and constantly sipping.</li>
<li>Eating balanced meals and snacks at consistent times. (Routines are important.)</li>
<li>Spending at least 30 minutes per day outside in the sun. (Bonus points if you get your body moving or spend time with friends.)</li>
<a>therapy</a>," or lashing out at the people we love because it feels like that’s the only way to express our
<a>anger</a>. We'll try anything that gives us a chance to release some tension. The problem is that this release is fleeting; it’s just a distraction and doesn’t tap into what’s really weighing you down.
<a>Self-compassion</a> is an important ingredient in loosening up compassion fatigue.
<div> <h2>Compassion Fatigue Essential Reads</h2> <div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>The Cost of Caring</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>Signs That Helping Others Is Hurting You</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div> </div>
<p>Say to yourself, out loud:</p>
<ul><li>It’s okay to feel like this.</li> <li>I’ve been carrying a lot, so it’s natural to feel heavy.</li> <li>I’ve been so strong, and I need some relief.</li> </ul>
<p>5. Practice radical acceptance. As an <a>empathetic</a> person, you might be holding onto ideas like:</p>
<ul><li>“I need to take care of people.”</li> <li>“I’m the only person who can take care of them.”</li> <li>“I can save them if I put my everything into it.”</li> </ul>
<p>6. <a>Compartmentalize</a>. We humans need contextual cues to help us switch gears between working, playing, relaxing, and all of our important modes of being. We can harness this to redirect from compassion fatigue to balanced living.</p>
<p>If your compassion fatigue is coming from work, some good elements you might include are:</p>
<li>Maintaining a <a>social life</a> with people other than your coworkers.</li>
<li>Consistently doing hobbies and activities that have <a>nothing to do with work</a>.</li>
<li>If you work from home, making sure that you have a separate space for work and leisure.</li>
<p>7. Get support from friends (or a therapist). Social support is as close to a psychological elixir as it gets. This may be especially true when compassion fatigue makes us feel alone even when we're surrounded by people.</p>
<a>A therapist</a>, too, can help you to process what you’re going through. We all deserve to have an empathic ear when we’ve been lending ours, and to be carried when we've been carrying others.
