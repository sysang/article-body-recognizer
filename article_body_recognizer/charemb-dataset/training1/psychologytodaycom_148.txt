<a>anxiety</a>, or other pre-existing problems. Substance use and gambling disorders not only engage the same brain mechanisms, they respond to many of the same treatment approaches.
<h2> Myths About Addiction </h2>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Symptoms of Addiction </h2>
<p>Recurrent use of a substance, or engagement with an activity, that leads to impairment or distress, is the core of addictive disorders. The clinical diagnosis of an addiction is based on the presence of at least two of a number of features:</p>
<li>The substance or activity is used in larger amounts or for a longer period of time than was intended.</li>
<li>There is a desire to cut down on use or unsuccessful efforts to do so.</li>
<li>Pursuit of the substance or activity, or recovery from its use, consumes a significant amount of time.</li>
<li>There is a craving or strong desire to use the substance or engage in the activity.</li>
<li>Use of the substance or activity disrupts obligations at work, school, or home.</li>
<li>Use of the substance or activity continues despite the social or interpersonal problems it causes.</li>
<li>Participation in important social, work, or recreational activities drops or stops.</li>
<li>Use occurs in situations where it is physically risky.</li>
<li>Use continues despite knowing it is causing or exacerbating physical or psychological problems.</li>
<li>Tolerance occurs, indicated either by need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve the desired effect or markedly diminished effect of the same amount of substance.</li>
<li>Withdrawal occurs, manifest either in the presence of physiological withdrawal symptoms or the taking of a related substance to block them.</li>
<p>Research makes it clear: There is no way to predict who will develop compulsive substance use or gambling behavior.</p>
<a>dopamine</a>. Another factor appears to be the nature of the body’s
<li><a>Gender</a>. Males are more likely to develop substance use disorder than females, although the so-called gender gap may be narrowing for alcohol use disorder, and females are more subject to intoxication effects at lower doses of alcohol.</li>
<li>Personality factors. Both impulsivity and <a>sensation seeking</a> have been linked to substance use and gambling disorders. Impulsivity may be particularly related to the risk of <a>relapse</a>.</li>
<a>attention deficit disorder</a>, and post-
<a>traumatic</a> stress disorder (
<a>PTSD</a>) increase the risk of addiction. Difficulties managing strong emotions are also linked to substance use.
<a>sibling</a> with an addictive disorder raises the risk, as does a lack of parental supervision or support. Poor-quality or troubled parent-child relations and family disruptions such as
<a>divorce</a> also add to one's risk, as does
<a>emotional abuse</a>. Research shows that
<a>marriage</a> and taking on child-raising responsibilities mitigate the risk of addiction.
<li>Accessibility factors. Easy availability of alcohol or other substances in one’s home, at school or work, or in one’s community increases the risk of repeated use.</li>
<a>adolescence</a>. Positive social relationships, on the other hand, are known to strongly protect against substance use.
<li>Employment status. Having a job, and developing the skills for employment, exerts pressure for stability and provides financial and psychological rewards that mitigate addiction risk.</li>
<h2> Treatment of Addiction </h2>
<a>management</a> of recurrent use.
<p>Treatment can include any of a number of components, which are often deployed in combination and are likely to change over the course of recovery:</p>
<li>Detoxification, conducted under medical supervision, may be needed but is only the first stage of treatment.</li>
<li>Medications that reduce or counter use of illicit substances are suitable for some individuals, or medications may be used to target co-occurring disorders such as anxiety and depression.</li>
<li>Motivational Interviewing, which is a short-term counseling process to help a person resolve ambivalence about treatment and find and hold onto incentives for change.</li>
<li>Cognitive Behavior <a>Therapy</a> (CBT) can help a person recognize and cope with situations that trigger the desire to use substances.</li>
<li>Group therapy and other peer-support programs leverage the direct experience of many to support individual recovery and prevent the recurrence of substance use.</li>
<li>Family therapy helps individuals repair any damage done to family relationships and to establish more supportive ones.</li>
<li>Life skills training, including employability skills, may be part of an individual's treatment plan.</li>
<li>Good treatment programs also feature the regular monitoring of individual progress.</li>
<li>Patients undergo comprehensive medical and <a>psychiatric</a> screening.</li>
<li>Treatment addresses individual needs, including co-occurring conditions, whether <a>chronic pain</a>, anxiety, or hepatitis.</li>
<li>Families are involved in treatment.</li>
<li>There is continuity of care via active linkages to resources in subsequent phases of recovery.</li>
<li>The facility maintains a respectful environment.</li>
<li>Treatment services are evidence-based and reflect best practices.</li>
<li>Staff members are licensed and certified in the disciplines they practice.</li>
<li>The program is accredited by a nationally recognized monitoring agency.</li>
<li>Patient response to treatment is monitored and the program or facility offers outcome data reflecting treatment performance.</li>

<li>Cannabis Use Disorder: Cannabis use disorder is highest among 18-to29-year-olds (4.8 percent) and prevalence of the disorder decreases with age.</li>
<li>Phencyclidine and Other Hallucinogen Use Disorder: These substances alter perception. Phencyclidine is commonly called “angel dust” or PCP and produces feelings of separation of mind from body.</li>
<a>sleeping</a> pills and anti-anxiety medications falls into this category. Like alcohol, these agents are brain depressants. Rates of the disorder are highest among 18-to-29-year-olds.
<a>methylphenidate</a>, best known as the prescription drug Ritalin; and cocaine. Stimulant drugs are commonly prescribed for the treatment of
<a>attention</a>-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. In the U.S., cocaine use is highest among those aged 18 to 25.
<li>Tobacco Use Disorder: The nicotine in tobacco acts as a central <a>nervous system</a> stimulant. Studies show that 68 percent of adult smokers want to quit, and 50 percent have made attempts to quit.</li>
<li>Other (or Unknown) Substance Use Disorder: Substances ranging from antihistamines, betel nut, and cortisol to steroids may also have effects on the central nervous system that lead to compulsive use causing serious problems.</li>

<p>Behaviors indicative of gambling disorder include:</p>
<li>The need to gamble with increasing amounts of money to achieve the desired excitement.</li>
<li>Restlessness or irritability when attempting to cut down or stop gambling.</li>
<li>Repeated unsuccessful efforts to cut back or stop gambling.</li>
<li>Preoccupation with gambling.</li>
<li>Feelings of emotional distress leading to gambling.</li>
<li>Gambling losses followed by attempts to make up for them.</li>
<li><a>Lying</a> to conceal the extent of one's gambling.</li>
<li>Gambling that jeopardizes important relationships or work, school, or other obligations.</li>
<li>Financial desperation leading to borrowing money from others.</li>

<div> <div> <h1>Theories of Personality</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<h2> Five-Factor Theory: Personality Is Based on Biology </h2>
<p>The theory’s creators distinguish enduring personality traits from “characteristic adaptations,” such as attitudes or strivings, that are shaped by one’s innate disposition as well as external forces.</p>
<div> <h3> Who created Five-Factor Theory? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The theory was first proposed in the 1990s by psychologists Robert McCrae and Paul Costa Jr. McCrae and Costa also created the <a>NEO Personality Inventory</a> in the 1970s</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the difference between Five-Factor Theory and the Five-Factor Model? </h3> </div>
<h2> Social Investment Theory: Biology and Experience Shape Personality </h2>
<div> <h3> Who created Social Investment Theory? </h3> </div>
<p>Multiple researchers have helped develop it. One proponent is psychologist Brent Roberts, who with colleagues in the ’00s, wrote about a “social investment principle." (They have also called their concept the Neo-Socioanalytic Model.)</p>
<div> <h3> What kinds of social roles might lead to personality change? </h3> </div>
<p>In a new job, one may be rewarded for being punctual and putting in work to complete tasks, or incentivized to get along with others. Interpersonal or familial roles, such as being in a new relationship, <a>may also affect</a> personality traits.</p>
<div> <h3> Can personality lead us to pick certain roles? </h3> </div>
<h2> Cognitive-Affective Theory: Personality and Situations </h2>
<div> <h3> Who proposed the cognitive-affective personality system (CAPS)? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Does the impact of situations mean that traits aren’t real? </h3> </div>
<h2> Narrative Identity: Personality as a Story </h2>
<div> <h3> Who developed the concept of narrative identity? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are some of the factors that distinguish people’s life stories? </h3> </div>
<h2> Psychodynamic Theories: Personality, Inner Conflicts, and Early Life </h2>
<a>Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</a>.
<div> <h3> Are psychoanalytic theories of personality still used? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are some factors that Freud thought affected personality? </h3> </div>
<div> <p>Traumatic events or internal conflicts during early development were proposed as influences on personality. Identification, or adopting characteristics of someone else in one’s life, was another factor thought to play a role.</p> </div>
<div> <h3> How did Freud’s followers differ from his view of personality? </h3> </div>
<h2> Humanistic Theories: Personality and Human Potential </h2>
<p>Humanistic psychology, developed in the mid-20th century by figures such as Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, focused the spotlight on individuals and their positive qualities, including their drive to achieve their full potential.</p>
<div> <h3> What traits did Maslow believe self-actualizers have? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What other perspectives are linked to humanistic psychology? </h3> </div>
<div> As hard is it is to believe, there's an idea that people high in psychopathy have the redeeming quality of boldness, but new research suggests that they’re really just plain mean. </div>

<div> <div> <h1>Parenting a Child with an Eating Disorder</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<li> How can I tell if my child has an eating disorder? </li>
<h2> How can I tell if my child has an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>Recognizing that your child has an eating disorder can be painful and scary, but confronting the disorder is the first step toward recovery. Here are some of the <a>signs that your child may be struggling with an eating disorder.</a></p>
<p>Signs related to physical health include rapid weight loss or weight gain, exhaustion, dizziness, fainting, stomach problems, damaged teeth, thinning hair, and feeling cold.</p>
<p> Signs related to mental health include becoming fixated on weight or body image, feeling stressed, anxious, or shameful about eating, and struggling with low self-esteem, isolation, and depression.</p>
<h2> How can I prevent my child from developing an eating disorder? </h2>
<p>Nothing can definitively prevent an eating disorder—those forces are sometimes out of a parent’s control. But cultivating a <a>positive, accepting atmosphere around body image</a> can help your child thrive. </p>
<p>Additionally, parents can strive to develop an open, communicative relationship so that if their child encounters challenges such as bullying or anxiety, parents can listen and address those challenges together in a healthy way.</p>
<h2> Do parents cause eating disorders? </h2>
<h2> How early can an eating disorder start? </h2>
<p>Children as young as <a>5-years</a> can develop an eating disorder. In fact, research suggests that <a>anorexia is emerging at a younger age</a> and that the condition has increased among children between 8 and 12 years old over the past decade.</p>
<p>Still, the <a>median age</a> when anorexia and bulimia develop is 18 and the median age when binge-eating disorder develops is 21, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.</p>
<h2> How should I prepare for a conversation about my child’s eating disorder? </h2>
<p>Before beginning the conversation, it can be helpful to research the condition thoroughly, as well as read accounts from those in recovery. This way parents can better <a>understand and empathize with their child’s experience.</a></p>
<a>In response, </a>parents can encourage small changes and provide perspective on what the child is missing in their current state of being.
<h2> How do I talk to my child about an eating disorder? </h2>
<a>exploring any topic that emerges,</a> from being bullied at school to feeling intense anxiety.
<p>Maintain a calm tone throughout the conversation, even if you are struggling internally, so that it feels less overwhelming for your child. Whether in the first conversation or a later one, discuss concrete steps to begin treatment.</p>
<h2> How do I encourage my child to accept treatment? </h2>
<p>Confronting a disorder and seeking treatment will likely require many conversations. In these talks, parents should be specific about the next step, such as finding a therapist or being evaluated by an eating disorder specialist. </p>
<a>that forces them to address the disorder.</a>
<p>The guidance above applies to children who need help but are not in immediate danger. If you are urgently concerned for your child’s safety, go to the hospital or call 911.</p>
<h2> How do I find a treatment center or therapist? </h2>
<p>Find a <a>treatment center</a> or an <a>eating disorder specialist</a> who takes your insurance in the Psychology Today Therapy Directory. Referrals from doctors or friends can also be helpful in this process.</p>
<p>Parents will want to research a clinic or therapist beforehand. It can be helpful to ask questions about credentials, experience, past patient outcomes, treatment strategies, how progress is measured, and insurance plans and payment options.</p>
<h2> How do I support my child in recovery? </h2>
<p><a>Recovery from an eating disorder</a> is a continuous process, with twists and turns along the way. Parents should recognize that in addition to moving forward, children will probably also contend with setbacks or relapses. </p>
<p>Parents can encourage their child to stick to the treatment plan or meal schedule and continue developing coping skills. They can also remind the child of their larger life goals, such as returning to school if they took time off. </p>
<a>Maintaining central pillars of your own life is important, </a>both for yourself and so that you can be there for your child.

<div> A promising strategy to improve the outcome of eating disorders treatment is the intensification of the evidence-based enhanced cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-E) </div>
