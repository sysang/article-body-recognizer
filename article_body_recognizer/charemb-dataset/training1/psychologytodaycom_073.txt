<p>• Reproduction is so essential for survival of the species that much mental activity and behavior related to <a>sex</a> is preprogrammed into the nervous system to serve this need.</p>
<p>• The mind can get stuck in a number of ways and cause significant distress to self and others.</p>
<h2> What Are Some Key Findings of Psychology? </h2>
<p>Since then, psychologists have shown that:</p>
<p>• <a>Attachment</a> to a <a>caregiver</a> in infancy and early <a>childhood</a> heavily influences an individual’s ability to reach optimal cognitive, emotional, and social development as an adult. </p>
<p>• <a>Intelligence</a> is a general mental capacity that operates in many spheres of life.</p>
<a>fundamental attribution error</a>.
<a>advertising</a> is effective.
<p>• Memory is not an indelible snapshot of events but a malleable recollection of events. Memories typically undergo revision every time we summon them up and recount them, then return them to storage.</p>
<p>• Stereotypes are important shortcuts in thinking but they have downsides—they also contribute to development of <a>prejudice</a>.</p>
<p>• Neuroplasticity, the capacity of brain/mind to reshape itself in response to experience, is a basic characteristic of the human nervous system, and it means that change is always possible.</p>
<h2> What Is Clinical Psychology? </h2>
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy, with or without some form of
<a>meditation</a>, to help people overcome their own non-productive patterns of thinking, reacting emotionally, and behaving.
<a>psychotherapy</a>—in calming the nervous system and establishing feelings of safety, a necessary condition for people to begin tackling their problems.
<h2> Where Else Is Psychology Used and Applied? </h2>
<a>creativity</a>. Many schools employ psychologists directly to help assess children’s abilities and to resolve problems that show up in the school setting.
<a>productivity</a> to promoting job satisfaction and creating productive work environments. Psychology also provides a foundation of management and
<a>leadership</a> programs in most business schools.
<p>The military utilizes psychology to help troops to prepare for and recover from the stresses of combat, to maintain morale, and to understand enemy strategies. Military psychologists may engage in research as well as practice.</p>
<p><a>Evolutionary psychology</a> is a subfield that applies a unique perspective. It focuses less on psychopathology and more on the functionality of adaptations individuals make to the environments they grew up in and/or currently exist in.</p>
<div> After years of promoting various diets, the weight loss industry claims that psychology can help people lose weight "for good." But is this approach just as misleading? </div>
<div> Transgender issues are often framed by differentiating sex from gender. This is a common but inadequate split. The three vectors of life, mind, and culture are needed. </div>

<h1> The 2 Most Important Questions in Psychology That No One Asks </h1>
<h2> Advice to clinicians that all patients should know. </h2>
<li>There are some things everyone knows about themselves. By tapping into these, patients can open up about their mental health.</li>
<li>A key question to ask includes "Do you feel like yourself?” and if not, "What is missing that would get you back to feeling fully like you?"</li>
<li>Asking about patients' capacity for interest, fun, and relaxation can also be valuable.</li>

<p>This is all testament to the normalizing effects of mental health <a>treatment.</a> We do not have “happy pills" nor do we make people happy when they should be sad. We help them return to normal, whatever that is for them.</p>
<p>These questions are useful not only because everyone knows the answer, but because they get to the essence of who we are and how we feel. If your clinician does not ask, tell them the answers anyway.</p>

<a>“types” of play</a> that children engage in—including
<div> <h3> How can I play with my child? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Should I let my child play alone? </h3> </div>
<a>playing independently</a> or by playing exclusively with other children. Though

<div> <h3> What are the benefits of play for adults? </h3> </div>
<a> the power of play</a> in almost every domain.
<div> <h3> Why do many adults stop playing? </h3> </div>
<a>most adults never lose their playfulness</a>—and what’s more, all of the domains that seemingly preclude play can actually benefit from it.

<a>humor</a> in everyday situations can help spark playfulness. And spontaneity—agreeing to unplanned activities that are outside of one’s normal routine—

<div> <h3> When does psychopathy begin? </h3> </div>
<a>childhood</a> (before age 10) and may receive a formal diagnosis such as conduct disorder. However, showing psychopathic features in childhood
<a>does not mean</a> that a person will necessarily become an adult psychopath.
<div> <h3> What causes someone to become a psychopath? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How is a psychopath diagnosed? </h3> </div>
<a>tests used by clinicians and forensic psychologists </a>to assess antisocial behavior. Both focus on criteria that capture a callous unconcern for others, or what the PPI terms “coldheartedness.”
<div> <h3> Can a psychopath be cured? </h3> </div>

<a>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</a> (DSM) uses neither “psychopath” nor “sociopath” as diagnostic terms. These descriptions are most closely represented in the DSM by a condition called antisocial

<h2> Psychopaths and Violence </h2>
<div> <h3> How many psychopaths are killers? </h3> </div>
<a>according to one estimate</a>—and there’s evidence that psychopathic criminals are more likely to re-offend. But many psychopaths do not have histories of violence.
<div> <h3> Are all serial killers psychopaths? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Not necessarily—though many (perhaps most) <a>serial killers</a> <a>exhibit psychopathic personalities</a>, showing a lack of empathy for their victims and no remorse for their crimes.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Do psychopaths feel fear? </h3> </div>
<a>fear</a>, research suggests that they have a
<a>muted fear response to threats</a>, which may make them more likely to engage in risky behavior. “Fearlessness” is one of the traits assessed by an alternative psychopathy test called the Psychopathic Personality Inventory.

<p>The knowing-doing gap. We know what our goals are at this point, and we often know what to do. But for many reasons, prominent of which is <a>fear</a>, we don't do the needful. We may not know how to do what is required.</p>
