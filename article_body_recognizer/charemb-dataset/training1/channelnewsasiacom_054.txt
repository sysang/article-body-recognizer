<p>"Ms Loh felt that the involvement of Mr Pritam Singh, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Faisal Manap had been intentionally omitted. The omission was quite stark," the summary added.</p>
<p>Ms Khan, Ms Loh and Mr Nathan told the committee they were "shocked" and "surprised" to learn that the party had formed a disciplinary panel on Nov 2 to look into Ms Khan's lies in Parliament.</p>
<p>Ms Khan came before the panel on Nov 8 to explain why she had lied repeatedly to Parliament. She also requested to meet the panel again on Nov 29 to talk about her performance as an MP.</p>
<p>Ms Khan then decided to resign from the party “as she acknowledged that she had made a mistake”.</p>
<p>Ms Loh and Mr Nathan told the Committee of Privileges that she thought the composition of the WP disciplinary panel was "self-serving".</p>
<p>The former secretarial assistant added that Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal Manap were the "very people who had known that what Ms Khan had said was untrue, and they were the only members of the (disciplinary panel)", said the summary.</p>
<p>She felt that the correct thing to do was to disclose in the WP statement that the panel had "intimate knowledge of the falsehood from an early stage".</p>
<p>CNA has sought comment from the Workers' Party on the Committee of Privileges' report. </p>
<p>Parliament did not respond to questions from CNA on whether Mr Singh, Ms Lim and Mr Faisal would be called before the committee.Watch Raeesah Khan's oral evidence to the Committee of Privileges on Dec 2: </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Conflicting accounts in Raeesah Khan saga open 'can of worms'; Workers' Party must limit damage, say analysts </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lydia Lam </a> </div> </div>
<a>lied in Parliament</a> about a sexual assault case have opened a can of worms that reveal divisions in the Workers' Party (WP), said political analysts, adding that the matter has raised questions about the party's credibility.
<p>On one end, Ms Khan told the Committee of Privileges that senior WP leaders had advised her to "<a>continue with the narrative</a>" after finding out about her lie, as well as “directed her not to respond to the police”.</p>
<p>These were among the revelations published on Friday (Dec 3) in a <a>special report from the committee</a>, chaired by Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin, which heard evidence over two days from Ms Khan and three WP members. </p>
<h2>CREDIBILITY OF WP IN QUESTION: ANALYSTS</h2>
<p>"It appears we have only seen the political trailer, with the full movie yet to be aired," he told CNA on Saturday.</p>
<p>"One other implication is that the Workers' Party was not able to prevent their dirty linen from being aired in public despite there being experienced leaders in their party ranks."</p>
<p>"This issue clearly shows a party divided and each new layer that has been unveiled potentially erodes trust that WP built from their members and constituents even further," she added.</p>
<p>He added that the party has to urgently and persuasively correct the narrative that is now in the public domain or face political consequences that are "too severe to even contemplate".</p>
<h2>WHAT OBSERVERS SAY WP MUST DO</h2>
<p>Dr Mustafa said that WP should take its time to digest the revelations from the Committee of Privileges hearings rather than "resort to a knee-jerk reaction".</p>
<p>The party should then respond "candidly and steadfastly, with the hope of bringing the matter to a close", he said.</p>
<p>"This episode is post-Low Thia Khiang Workers' Party's political baptism of fire in the 21st century," he added, referring to the former WP chief and opposition stalwart.</p>
<p>NTU's Dr Tan said WP "seriously needs to look at its processes on how they conduct themselves internally" and also in public. </p>
<p>"There is a need for the WP to regain voter confidence in the party moving forward. Furthermore, there is a need to look at how the party selects their candidates in the future," he said.</p>
<p>"There are still many questions left unanswered at this point in time. There is a need for damage control ... this entire fiasco might lead to serious divisions and splits within the political party, which would not bode well for the WP."</p>
<p>Dr Tan added that the WP leaders need to clear their name and regain public trust in the party, which has been on the ascent in the past few years.</p>
<p>SMU's Assoc Prof Tan said WP "must regain the narrative of this disturbing saga".</p>
<p>Dr Mustafa said that while the WP has taken a political hit from the spate of events, he feels the party's ideological brand will "outlast its present political predicament".</p>
<p>"It has sufficient time to regain the trust of the Singaporean domestic populace and bounce back to be the opposition party of choice before the next general election," he said.</p>
<p>Associate Professor of Political Science at the National University of Singapore Chong Ja Ian said the extent of the effects will only be known at the next election, and that even the polls will be coloured by events that occur afterwards.</p>
<p>"The WP is a political party. Like any organisation, issues will arise from time to time. We saw this with the PAP and TraceTogether," he said. </p>
<p>On the saga's overall impact on WP, he said it depends on people’s longer-term impression of the party as events unfold.</p>
<p>"That is not something anyone can predict at this point," he added.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: The Workers' Party (WP) will respond to the <a>Committee of Privileges' interim report</a> "at the appropriate forum and juncture", it said in a Facebook post on Sunday (Dec 5) night. </p>
<p>"We note the release of the interim report by the Parliamentary Committee of Privileges without having taken the evidence of Workers’ Party leaders against whom serious allegations have been made," said the WP.</p>
<p>Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh is prepared to testify before the Committee of Privileges, a position he "made clear" on Dec 2, the WP added. </p>
<p>"Some members of the public have asked why Workers’ Party leaders have not responded thus far to the interim report released by the Committee of Privileges. </p>
<p>"We understand that the Committee’s work remains in progress. It is thus prudent for a response to be given at the appropriate forum and juncture," the WP said on Sunday. </p>

<p>The Committee of Privileges' report came a day after Mr Singh said at a press conference on Thursday that Ms Khan admitted her lie to WP leadership <a>a week after her original speech</a> in August.</p>
<p>She was told to clarify the matter, but repeated the lie again in Parliament in October, he said.</p>
<p>The Committee of Privileges released a <a>special report</a> and hours of <a>video recordings</a> of its sessions with Ms Khan, Ms Loh, Mr Lim and Mr Nathan.</p>
<p>The report contained a summary of Ms Khan's evidence, including when she met WP leaders and when she told them she had lied.</p>
<p>She also made several allegations against Mr Singh, WP chair Sylvia Lim and WP vice-chair Faisal Manap, including that they had told her to keep to the lie. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Special report on Raeesah Khan's hearing released to keep the House informed of progress: Office of the Clerk of Parliament </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chew Hui Min </a> </div> </div>
<p>In a reply on Monday (Dec 6) to media queries, the Office of the Clerk of Parliament explained that existing rules allowed the Committee of Privileges to present such special reports.</p>
<p>This statement came a day after the Workers' Party (WP) questioned the timing of the report that was released on Friday.</p>
<p>WP said on Sunday that the interim report had been released "without having taken the evidence of Workers' Party leaders against whom serious allegations have been made".</p>
<p>"The Leader of the Opposition, Mr Pritam Singh, had made it clear on 2 December, that he is prepared to give evidence before the Committee of Privileges," the party said.</p>
<p>The Committee's special report contained statements from Ms Khan and other WP members that contradicted the WP chief's account of what happened after Ms Khan related a false anecdote in Parliament on Aug 3.</p>
<p>She then repeated the lie on Oct 4 upon questioning in Parliament. She came clean and apologised on the Nov 1 Parliament sitting, after which a complaint was filed against her, that is now before the Committee of Privileges.</p>
<p>Ms Khan has since resigned from the Workers' Party and as MP.</p>
<p>But according to Ms Khan's testimony, Mr Singh visited her on Oct 3 and “told her that if she kept to her existing narrative on the untruths which she had said on Aug 3, there would be no judgment by him”.</p>
<p>WP said on Sunday that it would give its response "at the appropriate forum and juncture" as the Committee's work remains in progress.</p>
<p>In Monday's statement, the Office of the Clerk of Parliament also said that the Committee of Privileges would present its final Report to Parliament "in due course" and that details related to hearings and witnesses were not fixed.</p>
<p>"The Committee’s mandate is to thoroughly look into any matter pertaining to the complaint, and will be reviewing the evidence and submissions put before it on an ongoing basis," it said.</p>
<p>"Details regarding meetings /hearings as well as potential witnesses will therefore remain fluid. Meetings of Select Committees are held in private unless resolved otherwise." </p>
<p>It can summon any person to appear before the Committee to give evidence at any time before the conclusion of its report, the Office added, citing the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act.</p>
<p>The Committee will continue its investigations into the complaint and will hear further evidence if it sees fit, the Office said.</p>
<p>It released in the Dec 3 report evidence from Ms Khan, Ms Loh Pei Ying, former secretarial assistant to Ms Khan; Mr Lim Hang Ling, former legislative assistant to Ms Khan; and Mr Yudhishthra Nathan, a WP volunteer.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Are HDB flats still attractive as an investment after new rules for prime locations? </h1>
<div> <p>HDB rules have evolved over the decades to help more Singaporeans own their flat while curbing excessive gains. The new PLH model is little different, say NUS’ Sing Tien Foo and Lee Nai Jia.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Sing Tien Foo </a> <a> Lee Nai Jia </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore might be one of the top countries with the highest proportions of the population owning capital.</p>
<p>For close to 90 per cent of Singaporeans households who own their homes, housing not only provides a roof over people’s heads but also works out to be one of the largest assets families hold over their lifetimes. </p>
<p>Singapore housing has appreciated significantly over the past 20 years, supported by sound macro-economic management and steady job growth over the decades. Resold HDB flats have created significant wealth for households in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>The unique dual features of housing, both as a place to live in and a largely stable and appreciating investment, are mutually reinforcing in a country that continues to grow economically and attract people to come and put roots down.</p>
<p>A Built-to-Order (BTO) home is a benefit reserved for Singaporeans that creates a hefty retirement nest egg.</p>
<p>A 4-room BTO in Fernvale Grove bought in 2004 between S$129,00 and S$162,000 saw an average transacted price of S$469,000 in 2021 – a 222 per cent return.</p>
<p>A resale in the Sengkang vicinity bought at the same time and resold in 2021 fetches about 69 per cent in contrast.</p>
<h2>PUBLIC HOUSING AIMS TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE, INCLUSIVE HOMES</h2>
<p>Over the decades, public housing has evolved to meet the higher aspirations of rising upper-middle class Singaporeans who might otherwise be outpriced in the private property market. </p>
<p>Collaboration with private developers to create flats with modern layouts through a Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) gave birth to 13 such developments after 2006, starting with The Premiere by Sim Lian, before discontinuing in 2012.</p>
<p>Executive condominiums (ECs) - a hybrid housing development with shared facilities like pools, clubhouse, gymnasium room, tennis courts and 24-hours security, which can be privatised after 10 years - also spawned. </p>
<p>More recent iconic projects like those at Dawson - SkyTerrance@Dawson, SkyVille@Dawson, Pinnacle@Duxton - designed by private architects, look like, if not better, than private condominiums. </p>
<p>With all these rules, do people still want to buy these HDB flats? The answer is pretty resounding. The first batch of BTO homes in Rochor has seen healthy demand, at 10.3 times over-subscription.</p>
<p>Land in the city centre would have been outbidded by private developers catering to large enterprises, restaurants, shops, and residents who can afford downtown living. </p>
<p>More ordinary Singaporeans would also miss the chance of long-term economic gains of a home with an attractive location.</p>
<p>Homes there have appreciated faster in prices than farther-flung neighbourhoods like Jurong, Pasir Ris, Yishun, or Hougang.</p>
<h2>NEW RULES FOR PLH TAKE DRESSING FROM PAST CURBS ON EXCESSIVE GAINS IN PUBLIC HOUSING</h2>
<p>Many past rules have aimed to create barriers between public and private housing for this reason. </p>
<p>Still, these stipulations have curbed the prices of ECs by about 8 per cent relative to other private condos after the 10th year, a study by the NUS Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies shows.</p>
<p>Our colleagues, professors Kwan Ok Lee and Joseph Ooi, also found a price gap of up to 18 per cent between ECs and private condominiums before the sale restrictions on ECs are lifted before the 10th year.</p>
<p>Similar brakes have been applied to the public housing market, including the extension of the MOP from three to five years after 2010 and rules forbidding private homeowners from buying resale HDB flats for investment purposes.</p>
<p>Still, in the spirit of not hindering HDB owners from investing in other assets, existing HDB homeowners can keep and concurrently invest in private apartments after the MOP of five years. </p>
<p>There have also been measures to tighten the circle of beneficiaries of HDB policies.</p>
<h2>A WEALTH PRESERVATION CHANNEL</h2>
<p>The attraction of Singapore homeownership will continue to require healthy prevailing market forces and the astute management of the economy.</p>
<p>Public housing is an important asset, and HDB flat owners, who expect their house value to appreciate over time, must be given a strong investment motive. </p>
<p>If housing does not preserve its value, households will be better off renting instead of owning their homes.</p>

<h1> Commentary: TraceTogether and SafeEntry shouldn’t be needed for entry into malls and low-risk areas </h1>
<div> <p>If TraceTogether’s only role for most people in Singapore is to indicate vaccination status, then it should stop being mandated for entry to malls, says NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health’s Alex Cook.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Alex R Cook </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: As a European living in Singapore, I’ve found myself preoccupied several times over the last two years with this question: Why are deaths rates in my old home 15 times higher than in my new one?</p>
<p>I’ve reached the conclusion that, more specifically, it’s the comprehensiveness of Singapore’s testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine that lies behind this gulf between the pandemic’s impact here and in other high-income countries. </p>
<h2>ABOUT TIME CONTACT TRACING WAS STEPPED DOWN</h2>
<p>Despite the important contribution it has made so far, I believe it is time to further step down contact tracing, now that there is high vaccine coverage in Singapore and the vaccinated run a much lower risk of severe COVID-19.</p>
<p>Contact tracing is part of a quartet, alongside testing, isolation and quarantine. Remove one element and the ensemble falls apart. </p>
<p>Without testing, whose contacts do we trace? Without isolation of cases, why quarantine their contacts? Without quarantining contacts, what is the point of doing contact tracing to find them?</p>
<p>So, it made sense when the Ministry of Health (MOH) simplified protocols in October after the expansion of the Home Recovery Programme, substantially reducing the strictness of quarantine for close contacts.</p>
<p>Now, contrast this to earlier in the pandemic, when close contacts were aggressively traced and subject to close monitoring in dedicated quarantine facilities for a fortnight. </p>
<p>Today, a more targeted ring of close contacts are identified to undergo just a week of self-monitoring and can leave home so long as they test negative on an antigen test.</p>
<p>We could pare this back even further, by ceasing the interactions close contacts have with MOH: Being told you are a contact and uploading the first antigen test result.</p>
<p>It’s hard to see why either is actually necessary, since most close contacts – within a family, workplace or known social gatherings – will likely know or be informed by the case that they’ve been exposed.</p>
<h2>MASSIVE UNSEEN COSTS OF CONTACT TRACING</h2>
<p>Contact tracing can sound deceptively simple, with callers interviewing cases and piecing their activities using technologies with a light footprint. But it is not without cost. </p>
<p>There are also labour costs for businesses to man entrances to check customers correctly use TraceTogether and SafeEntry.</p>
<p>Today, you can’t proactively reduce your risk of exposure in the same way. As MOH’s geospatial data shows, cases are now all over the country—not unexpected when there are 10,000 diagnosed cases every week. </p>
<p>It seems the main benefit of continuing using TraceTogether now is to certify our vaccination statuses and enforce vaccination-differentiated measures on the 4 per cent of unvaccinated adults and teens, and no longer for contact tracing purposes.</p>
<h2>ROLE OF CONTACT TRACING IN ENDEMIC STATE?</h2>
<p>Some healthcare settings, such as the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, have specialised tracking systems for patients and healthcare workers that use radio-frequency identification tags, rather than Bluetooth in TraceTogether. </p>
<p>This technology is specifically designed for the task of identifying patients who have come into contact with a case and is ideal for high-risk settings like hospitals. In time, such technologies could become commonplace in other hospitals.</p>
<p>But until then, TraceTogether may have some use in controlling hospital outbreaks and could be retained for patients, staff and visitors.</p>
<p>However, in the general community, with the high levels of infection now and expected to rise alongside further relaxations of restrictions, we can all expect to be exposed to the virus at some point. </p>
<p>In a more endemic state, contact tracing can no longer offer much value except in certain high-risk settings.</p>
<p>Many people will probably keep using TraceTogether, simply as an efficient way to show they’re vaccinated. But if TraceTogether or SafeEntry check-ins don’t lead to action by the authorities for most cases, they shouldn’t be necessary.</p>
<p>And seeing as 96 per cent of the eligible population are vaccinated, perhaps the authorities should reassess whether the costs of checking every single customer’s vaccination status merit the additional protection afforded.</p>
<h2>KEEPING OUR CAPABILITIES READY</h2>
<p>COVID-19 is the second pandemic I’ve experienced in Singapore. In the early days of H1N1 in 2009, I recall well when contact tracing was a manual affair and could only be sustained a month or two before the authorities had to give up.</p>
<p>That we’ve been able to push contact tracing to its full potential for almost two years of COVID-19 is testament both to the pioneering technologies and hard work of the many civil servants involved. </p>
<p>One lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic has been that with thorough testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine, we may be able to contain a pandemic long enough to roll out vaccination to almost all the population and save untold lives. </p>
<p>When Disease X – the hypothetical catastrophic viral threat – hits, or if a variant of SARS-CoV-2 emerges that requires a complete reboot of our approach, SafeEntry and TraceTogether should be part of our response from day one. </p>
<p>The challenge will be in keeping our capabilities ready to be activated or scaled up rapidly when needed – such as if the Omicron variant turns out to be severe enough to force the country back into containment mode. </p>
<p>Until then, with vaccination rates as high as they now are, it is time to give the contact tracers a well-earned rest.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Booster shots have side effects. Workplaces can afford to be more understanding </h1>
<div> <p>By now millions of jabs have gone into arms of the old, young and many more in between. CNA's Crispina Robert says managing the usual side effects with responsibilities at work or home can be challenging.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Crispina Robert </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: When the COVID-19 vaccine became available in Singapore and slots for my age group opened up earlier this year, I registered online right away. </p>
<p>It felt good to do my part against this new scary virus. I scheduled my first dose on a Sunday evening and woke up the next morning feeling only a slightly sore arm. </p>
<p>A few weeks later, I went in for my second dose – on a same Sunday evening slot. Except this time, things were vastly different. </p>
<p>I woke at 3am, with a high fever and chills. I stumbled out of bed, popped some paracetamol yet couldn’t sleep. My arm felt like a tonne of bricks.</p>
<p>A few hours later that Monday morning, I groggily woke up to the alarm going off. Things continued downhill. </p>
<p>A few weeks ago, it was time for a booster shot. I’ll be honest and say this time, I was very hesitant. </p>
<p>Knowing how the second dose messed up several of my days, I decided to plan this third shot carefully. So, I picked an early Saturday morning slot – with the weekend to deal with side effects.</p>
<p>But when I initially told my family and friends my booster plan, they said I was “wasting” a perfectly precious weekend. I should have gotten the shot on a weekday and taken sick leave instead of doing it during my personal time.</p>
<h2>DIFFERENTIATED VACCINATION POLICIES</h2>
<p>Some organisations are generous when it comes to treating workers with side effects from vaccinations. OCBC Bank, for instance, gives staff a day off. They also throw in private taxi reimbursement to and from the vaccination centre. </p>
<p>And if someone feels sick, they can take two more days of medical leave without having to show a medical certificate.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, when people worked from the office, Singtel allowed staff to work from home for a week after their shots, so they have time recover if unwell. </p>
<p>I had three Moderna shots and those who took the Moderna vaccine reported more of these reactions too.</p>
<p>And yet others, like my 83-year-old neighbour, felt absolutely nothing. He was out walking, fit as fiddle with nary a sign he’s had anything more than a regular visit to the supermarket on all three of his shots (he took the Pfizer vaccine).</p>
<p>Depending on what you do for a living, a day or two out of action can be a minor inconvenience for the team or an operational issue which requires someone else to cover and a shuffling around of a complicated roster. </p>
<p>I imagine teachers, doctors, nurses and other frontline staff will be hard pressed to take time off especially when someone else has to cover a night or early morning shift.</p>
<p>When I felt poorly, I remember feeling guilty that the team had to pick up my share of the work. Some power through the workday popping Panadols until it’s time to call it a day. </p>
<p>Adrian Tan, a HR strategist says trust and a culture of generosity goes a long way. Most companies don’t ask for proof, and it’s taken at face value. </p>
<p>But the bigger point he makes is this: Splitting hairs helps no one. “It’s easy and almost instinctive to bean count but it cuts both ways,’’ he tells me. </p>
<p>For years, employees have done overtime or worked on weekends without complaint. So now, when it’s time for employers to show up for them, demonstrating some good faith will make a difference in ensuring they don’t leave, he says. </p>
<p>And if staff want to schedule their shots on a workday, they should be given time off – advance manpower planning can help. </p>
<p>Mayank Parekh, CEO of the Institute of Human Resource Professionals (IHRP) agrees. He says it's the little things that make the difference in building relationships between supervisors and workers. </p>
<p>We could all use a little more of that in this most unpleasant COVID-19 world.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Harry Potter got a generation of kids reading. No other story can do that today </h1>
<div> <p>Two decades ago we were compulsively reading Harry Potter, lugging 600-page tomes to school to thumb through between classes, says CNA’s Erin Low.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Erin Low </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: “Yer a wizard, Harry.”</p>
<p>No more iconic words of initiation have been spoken. They introduced readers to a vast world of magic, seen through the eyes of a then 11-year-old boy.</p>
<p>Those words were also the launch pad of seven novels, eight films, a play, and numerous spin-offs, video games and theme parks.</p>
<p>As the first Harry Potter film turns 20 this year, millennials will fondly reminisce about our journey through the years with The Boy Who Lived.</p>
<p>Whenever a new book arrived, we burrowed into it, excitedly discussed its events, and speculated what will happen next. The film adaptations sated our appetites while we waited.</p>
<p>Once a new book was announced, we badgered our parents to pre-order it. On the day it hit shelves, we waited in line with bated breaths.</p>
<p>Looking back at the analogue way we did all this, it's interesting to think: If JK Rowling wrote and published the novels today, would they have had the same success as they did two decades ago? What about the films?</p>
<p>COMPELLING STORY, CHARACTERS AND SETTING</p>
<p>Not many contemporary novels – let alone one targeted at children and young adults – have become a worldwide phenomenon like Harry Potter.</p>
<p>Perhaps Harry Potter’s universal appeal is thanks to business-savvy publishers and marketers, as well as Warner Bros’ heft.</p>
<p>But it could be that it’s just that good a story. At its heart is a simple but compelling tale of a young boy pitted against a dark wizard, where good eventually triumphs over evil.</p>
<p>The books and films left young audiences with wonder, even a tinge of envy. We dreamed of receiving an admissions letter from Hogwarts by owl.</p>
<p>All this meant we were compulsively reading Harry Potter in the early 2000s, even lugging 600-page tomes to school to read between classes.</p>
<p>I blasted through newly released titles so I could chat about it with my friends as soon as possible. We crowded around school computers to find out which Hogwarts house we belonged in or to watch funny fan-made videos.</p>
<p>Pottermania was a force to be reckoned with then, fuelled by online fan sites such as The Leaky Cauldron. Fans swapped theories and argued which characters would become a couple.</p>
<p>Some even set up Quidditch clubs. The game works like how it does in the books, except players run around with broomsticks between their legs.</p>
<p>HOW HARRY POTTER GOT US ALL READING</p>
<p>Harry Potter is a once-in-a-lifetime publishing feat, so much so that the New York Times in 2000 established a separate children’s bestsellers list, because Rowling’s novels kept topping the general one.</p>
<p>But the fact that Harry Potter became a collective cultural experience probably had a lot to do with how it was released in an early-Internet age. The fact that the books and films were released once every few years seems unbelievable now.</p>
<p>Children’s fantasy series Keeper Of The Lost Cities – parents tell me it’s popular with kids in Singapore these days – has steadily released a book a year. And in film, Marvel churns out blockbusters just months apart.</p>
<p>Without that competition, publishers could bank on anticipation to build over the course of years, dropping teasers here and then to kindle the fires of reader enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In an era before over-the-top services, Harry Potter movie premieres were a huge deal. Fans could camp overnight just for a glimpse of the cast.</p>
<p>And yet Harry Potter didn’t actually get more children to read. The US’ National Endowment of Arts said in 2007 there was no demonstrable increase in children reading at the height of Pottermania.</p>
<p>Reading among children was already on a long-term, gradual decline. Not even a wizard boy can magically reverse dwindling rates of reading. </p>
<p>Educational benefits aside, there’s no questioning that Harry has, and continues to capture our hearts and minds.</p>
<p>The latest offering, Harry Potter And The Cursed Child in 2016, received more pre-orders than Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, the fastest selling book in history. And the former’s a screenplay, not a novel authored solely by Rowling.</p>
<p>Featuring Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, it’s bound to be replete with nostalgia. </p>
<p>For those who remember vividly how cute these actors were as children, it’ll be a reminder of how much we’ve grown too. But even as adults, we’ll never forget how time and reality melted away the moment we stepped into Harry’s world.</p>
<p>And while the series lives on, the magic of the main novels and films is as potent as it was two decades ago. Revisiting them is always like saying hello to an old friend.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Ruckus over US Democracy Summit a sign of insecure Singapore? </h1>
<div> <p>Focusing on the wrong issues in foreign relations can blind us to what Singapore’s national interests are says CNA's Lin Suling.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Lin Suling </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: I chided myself this week for reading about the outcomes of the Democracy Summit on Friday (Dec 10) like some obsessive stalker not invited to the wedding of an ex. </p>
<p>News broke this week of US President Joe Biden’s holding court over 100 countries at what was touted as a gathering of world leaders to counter a rising tide of authoritarianism. </p>
<p>The implication, to quote a foreign policy cliché, is that if you’re not at the table, you’re on the menu. </p>
<p>Inferring so, some in Singapore were deeply disappointed we weren’t invited. </p>
<p>Ambassador-at-large Prof Tommy Koh criticised the omission on Thursday.</p>
<p>Singapore should have been invited, Prof Koh said, because it satisfies what he sees as critical criteria for democracy - with free and fair elections, a constitution guaranteeing fundamental freedoms, an independent judiciary and the rule of law. </p>
<p>Now, Singapore was not the only country to have felt annoyed at this perceived slight. </p>
<p>The Democracy Summit also sparked a trading of unpleasant barbs elsewhere - like this gem from a Russian political analyst writing in the Global Times and comparing the meeting to “a mistress of a brothel teaching morals … to school girls”. </p>
<h2>A BELT AND ROAD INITIATIVE DEJA VU</h2>
<p>The big Singapore reactions were surprising because it felt like déjà vu. </p>
<p>Was it because Singapore took a principled stance on the South China Sea? Was this an expression of displeasure regarding Singapore’s training in Taiwan? Or related to the Terrex vehicles earlier seized in Hong Kong? </p>
<p>Some even suggested this was a concrete sign China-Singapore relations had waned after founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew passed on in 2015. </p>
<p>In retrospect, the relationship turned out fine - with the high-level official forum, the Joint Council for Bilateral Cooperation, and other big government-to-government projects in Chongqing, Tianjin and Suzhou, proceeding apace. </p>
<p>It’s a good thing leaders from both sides didn’t let unhelpful talk and navel-gazing neuroses about the BRI invitation get in the way of bigger national interests.</p>
<h2>WHY SHOULD WE CARE WHETHER WE’RE INVITED TO THE DEMOCRACY SUMMIT?</h2>
<p>So have we learnt our lessons from four years ago?</p>
<p>And yet somehow many of us reading the news in Singapore still seethe, as if the non-invite was a besmirchment of our national honour. </p>
<p>Have we become so unsure of our global standing that we’re constantly searching for signs of reaffirmation? </p>
<h2>LEAVE THE ‘SINGAPORE PUNCHES ABOVE ITS WEIGHT’ THINKING BEHIND</h2>
<p>Perhaps a longtime fixation on international rankings and what countries say about us has led us to mistake rhetoric for reality. </p>
<p>Maybe we really need to ditch this whole “Singapore punches above its weight” kind of puffery and quit taking every event as a test of our national reputation. </p>
<h2>NOT GOING TO THE PARTY DOESN’T MEAN WE’RE NOT FRIENDS</h2>
<p>That is not to say we can’t have a productive relationship with the US, whatever shade of democracy Singapore is.</p>
<p>Not being invited to a forum like this has no bearing on any of these goals.</p>
<p>It should be more than enough that Singapore was the stop of visits by not only US vice-president Kamala Harris, but also secretary of defense Lloyd Austin and secretary of commerce Gina Raimondo in the past six months. </p>
<p>Let’s not forget those visits were coming at pivotal moments in history, when the US was simultaneously orchestrating a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and later, during Biden’s historic virtual summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>ESTABLISH GREATER FOREIGN POLICY LITERACY</p>
<p>Or a leader well-versed in the foreign policy language of common values and skilled at getting more countries to pick up the slack in the name of those grandstanding virtues.</p>
<p>Any astute observer would know better than to underestimate America. It can be a divided place but it has proven incredibly resilient. </p>
<p>Just don’t look to it for approval.</p>

<h1> Commentary: With travel down and SHN eased, Singapore hotels need a Plan B </h1>
<div> <p>Several new hotels have recently opened or plan to open soon, and the sector expects a boost from domestic tourism and pent-up demand, but NUS Business School’s Nitin Pangarkar is not convinced.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Nitin Pangarkar </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: The tourism sector in Singapore has gone through a brutal two-year period because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Airlines, especially Singapore Airlines, which has no domestic traffic, and Changi Airport have suffered a steep demand decline, after a record year in 2019. </p>
<p>In the hotel industry, occupancy rates and hotel room revenues have stayed at all-time lows. </p>
<p>Crowd-pulling events like the Singapore Grand Prix Formula 1 Night Race, usually held in September each year, were canned. </p>
<p>A few, like the Bloomberg New Economic Forum held in November, are starting to breathe some life back into hotels but represent only an iota of pre-pandemic travel.</p>
<p>Despite the difficult two years and the continuing challenges posed by new coronavirus variants, the industry is putting on a brave front.</p>
<p>Many industry insiders and analysts are predicting a bounce back in demand to pre-COVID levels in the next few years. Several new hotels, like the Duxton Reserve and the Raffles Sentosa Resort and Spa, have recently opened or plan to open soon.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind these decisions to open new hotels at this time is twofold. First, one needs a significant lead time to open a hotel.</p>
<p>I remain sceptical, however, about the optimism in Singapore’s hotel sector.</p>
<p>First, as is evident from the events of the past few weeks – when the emergence of the Omicron variant threw many countries’ reopening plans out of kilter – a return to normalcy is unlikely to be without speed bumps.</p>
<p>At this time, we do not know how convoluted and lengthy the path to normalcy will be.</p>
<p>Second, the key argument supporting the prediction of a V-shaped recovery in tourism-related services – based on expected pent-up demand – may not hold.</p>
<p>Over the past one and a half years, hotel occupancy rates were shored up by block bookings made by the Singapore Government to house travellers serving stay-home notices and people under quarantine.</p>
<p>As these bookings are wound down in favour of home-based recovery and isolation as part of Singapore’s decision to treat COVID-19 as endemic, many hotels will lose this part of the business.</p>
<p>This will negate the positive effect due to pent-up demand if it materialises, which itself is open to question.</p>
<p>Even new rules requiring travellers to recover in hotel rooms if they test positive for COVID-19 will just add marginally to the revenues.</p>
<p>From my perspective, Singapore’s inbound tourism is unlikely to bounce back quickly, partly because of the cautious attitudes of the Government as well as the general public towards reopening.</p>
<p>The complex set of policies such as vaccinated travel lanes, daily antigen rapid tests and vaccination-differentiated safe management measures even for simple services such as dining is likely to dampen tourist arrivals.</p>
<p>Whether potential tourists and MICE attendees will brave these strict policies to enjoy existing or enhanced attractions in Singapore remains to be seen.</p>
<p>While the struggles of inbound tourism may be compensated by domestic tourism and pent-up demand for events such as weddings, I think this boost will be short term.</p>
<h2>SHIFTING PATTERNS OF DEMAND</h2>
<p>Analysts and hotel industry managers also may be overlooking an important subtlety in the demand for hotels. Even if leisure tourism makes a V-shaped recovery, it is not at all clear that business travellers will come back in large numbers.</p>
<p>There may be little pent-up demand for this segment. Most analysts agree that a part of business travel will be lost to video-conferencing tools such as Zoom and Google Meet.</p>
<p>With this shifting pattern of demand, it is quite likely that room prices will be softer for the next few years.</p>
<p>Substantial capacity had been added in the few years before the pandemic, and leisure travellers are more price sensitive than business travellers.</p>
<h2>NEED FOR ROBUST SCENARIO PLANNING</h2>
<p>Hotel finances probably already took a battering over the past two years, since the Government’s block bookings were most likely done at discounted prices. This explains why revenue per available room has plummeted by more than 50 per cent.</p>
<p>Hotels may have simply covered their variable costs and made little profit from these block bookings. It may take a while for hotels to repair their balance sheets.</p>
<p>With close to 400 hotels, 69,000 rooms and 27,000 staff (as at December last year) employed in accommodation services, the fortunes of the hotel industry are important to Singapore’s economy and the Government.</p>
<p>In March, Workforce Singapore announced a revamp of the Job Redesign Reskilling programme first introduced in November 2019, aimed at reskilling employees and helping them take up enhanced roles.</p>
<p>Reskilling addresses trends such as labour shortage and automation. But it is unlikely to be a solution to a longstanding structural imbalance in supply and demand (especially too much supply) that the pandemic worsened.</p>
<p>Despite the brave front it is putting on, I think Singapore’s hotel industry needs a Plan B that goes beyond hopes of a V-shaped recovery and is based on realistic assessments of several possible scenarios. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Reducing stress may protect you from COVID-19, so make it a priority </h1>
<div> <p>Stress weakens the immune system, which is vital for not getting infected by the coronavirus, according to American psychologists.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Annie Ginty </a> <a> Sarah Pressman </a> </div> </div>
<p>WACO, Texas: While stress has always been around, in 2021 it has seemed utterly inescapable.</p>
<p>Between the stress of family possibly getting very ill, increased care responsibilities, perpetual concern about lost income, the pain of social disconnection, and the rise of new variants, the stressors are never-ending.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, recent US surveys have reported that 55 per cent of the general population felt increased stress during the pandemic and university students around the world reported pandemic-related <a>increases in depression</a> and anxiety.</p>
<p>While many have acknowledged the decline in mental health since early 2020, what has gone mostly unspoken is how these feelings may be connected to your likelihood of getting sick.</p>
<h2>HOW STRESS MAKES YOU SICK</h2>
<p>You may have heard previously that stress is bad for you, but perhaps you didn’t understand exactly how. In fact, researchers have been studying the mechanisms of how this works for decades.</p>
<p>This body of evidence has proven without question that stress can cause damaging changes to the immune system in both humans and animals.</p>
<p>Psychological scientist Sheldon Cohen and his colleagues have conducted a number of studies where healthy people are exposed to an upper respiratory infection via drops of virus placed directly into their nose.</p>
<p>These participants are then quarantined in a hotel and monitored closely to determine who gets sick and who doesn’t.</p>
<p>One of the most important factors that predicts who gets sick and who stays well is prolonged psychological stress.</p>
<p>Individuals with stressors that persist for six months to two years (nearly the length of the pandemic so far) are almost three times more likely to become sick with an infectious agent as those who are unstressed.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is specifically driven by stressors common to many of us today, including unemployment and enduring difficulties with family or friends.</p>
<p>But don’t be too disheartened. One important fact that is frequently missed in these studies is that even when a virus is put into your nose, your fate isn’t sealed.</p>
<p>In fact, as many as a third of the participants are resilient to viruses known to make us quite ill including cold viruses, flu viruses, and even, you guessed it, coronaviruses. So, who are these people who tend to not get sick?</p>
<h2>THE ROLE OF INFLAMMATION</h2>
<p>How do feelings of stress or stressful life experiences get under our skin to change our likelihood of getting sick? One of the key factors is inflammation.</p>
<p>Inflammation is responsible for critical trafficking of immune cells in your body so that the right cells are present in the right locations at the right times and at the right levels.</p>
<p>When stress is high and long lasting, the hormones in our body get unbalanced in a way that leads to higher than normal levels of inflammation and a host of adverse health outcomes.</p>
<p>As it happens, many of the preexisting conditions associated with severe COVID-19 symptoms and hospitalisation are also associated with higher levels of stress and inflammation, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.</p>
<p>It has even been proposed that COVID-19 activates inflammation in a similar way that chronic stress does and results in a “cytokine storm”.</p>
<p>This may be partly due to activities of stress hormones like cortisol, revealed to be high in the most severe cases of COVID-19 including an increased risk of death.</p>
<h2>TAKING STRESS SERIOUSLY</h2>
<p>Your stress and well-being matter, especially during a time of rebounding COVID-19 infection levels and new variants around the world.</p>
<p>Having an optimally functioning immune system has never been so critical.</p>
<p>That is, how much protective antibody you produce in response to the vaccine.</p>
<p>This gives us yet another reason to focus on our wellness right now. So please, follow the advice from decades of research: Take your stress seriously and protect your well-being during this endlessly stressful time.</p>
<p>Stay socially connected, even if it has to be virtual. Focus on what you can control rather than what you can’t. Take time every day to do something that makes you happy. Rest. Prioritise your sleep and exercise.</p>
<p>And most importantly, listen to public health experts and get vaccinated, wear a mask, and wash your hands, but also remember that that’s not the end all of staying healthy.</p>
<p>Your mind affects your body in important and COVID-19-relevant ways, so taking care of your well-being, especially your stress level, is essential too.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> Goldman Sachs sets 2030 carbon emissions reduction targets </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>NEW YORK: Goldman Sachs Group Inc said it would work with clients in three areas to reduce carbon emissions substantially by 2030, as it revealed new details about its approach to countering climate change in a report released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Goldman said it would consider the use of carbon credits when it can verify that they are of high quality to achieve those goals.</p>
<p>Other banks including JPMorgan Chase Co and Morgan Stanley have set similar targets.</p>
<p>The targets are a sign of how banks are ramping up pressure on clients to reduce emissions as the industry comes under increasing pressure globally to cut off financing for industries such as coal that harm the environment.</p>
<p>"As a financial institution, we believe the most meaningful role we can play in the global climate transition is to drive decarbonisation in the real economy in partnership with our clients," Chief Executive David Solomon said in the report.</p>
<p>Campaigners said Goldman's targets were not enough.</p>
<p>"Achieving the net-zero target Goldman and other banks have committed to means stopping support for fossil fuel expansion immediately. Anything less is just an attempt at good PR,” said Sierra Club Fossil-Free Finance Campaign Manager Ben Cushing.</p>
<p>One of the top US bank regulators said Thursday that banks should make assessing financial risks stemming from climate change an integral part of their work.</p>
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it was soliciting feedback on draft principles for bank supervisors, with a specific eye on firms with over US$100 billion in assets.</p>
<p>The bank believes companies in those sectors will "need massive support through capital and strategic advice to deliver on net zero goals," it said.</p>
<p>Solomon said the bank's research showed that US$56 trillion was needed in green infrastructure investments globally to reach a net zero economy by 2050.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had already been taking steps to bring its lending into line with a growing worldwide push to cut emissions. In October, it joined the United Nations-backed Net Zero Banking Alliance.</p>
<p>The bank's new efforts come as climate-focused investors are calling on the major U.S. banks to quickly scale back their financing of new fossil fuel development, saying current commitments to curb global emissions are not enough.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Reuters reported that HSBC expected all its clients to have a plan in place to exit financing thermal coal by the end of 2023.</p>

<div> <p> <a> Commentary </a> </p> <h1> Commentary: All I want this Christmas is an end to eco-friendly gifts </h1> <div> <p>Metal straws or bamboo cutlery don’t move the needle on the waste problem, says CNA’s Erin Low.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Erin Low </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Shopping for Christmas gifts? Please take my advice: Do not buy reusable straws. Or anything reusable, really.</p>
<p>My kitchen cabinets are spilling over with sustainable stuff: Glass tupperware, beeswax wraps, grocery bags and more.</p>
<p>Of metal straws, I have a silver one, a chrome blue one, a multicoloured one, and a golden one with a crook on top so it looks like a bendy straw – but because it can't actually bend, it always catches on my drawer whenever someone opens it.</p>
<p>To add to the clutter, each straw comes with a thin brush that can be slipped in to clean the inside. They resemble tiny toilet brushes but serve no other purpose.</p>
<p>I never use these reusable straws or their respective brushes. If I were artistically inclined, I would create a sculpture out of this junk and title it, The Last Straw. Or, Carbon Sucks.</p>
<p>It would be the centrepiece of my protest against cutlery-related virtue signalling.</p>
<p>GOOD INTENTIONS BEHIND TOTALLY IMPRACTICAL GIFTS</p>
<p>The same thinking must go on at companies. Perhaps through corporate social responsibility initiatives, they’re building a BYO (bring your own) culture at the office and want their holiday gifts to be on-brand. </p>
<p>Last Christmas, my colleague passed me a bamboo cutlery set she got as a corporate gift, because she had already received many in previous years. Just like my assorted metal straws, I’ve never used it before.</p>
<p>Such magnanimity from our loved ones and work contacts has unintended consequences. We're now drowning with reusable paraphernalia.</p>
<h2>THE TRUTH ABOUT YOUR ECO-FRIENDLY PRESENTS</h2>
<p>On the outside, sustainable, plastic-free wares make great presents. They are sleek and stylish, and when marketed as 100 per cent recycled or organic, fair-trade and so on, make consumers feel good about using them.</p>
<p>But are they actually better for the environment?</p>
<p>Some studies even suggest you even have to use your cotton bag thousands of times before it’s more environmentally friendly than a single-use plastic bag.</p>
<p>It can be argued that anyone can cherry-pick studies demonstrating how “environmentally friendly” alternatives, which we tend to think refers to anything that isn’t plastic, might not be environmentally friendly at all.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about the practical day-to-day use of these products. Do zero-waste gifts actually eliminate waste?</p>
<p>This is thanks to a 73 per cent rise in the number of food deliveries across surveyed households and a 50 per cent increase in online grocery purchases.</p>
<p>If the pandemic got us hooked on these online conveniences, then all the more our reusables collect dust, because everything’s showing up at our door swathed in at least two layers of packaging.</p>
<h4> <div>How do staggering 11.11 sales figures sit with a growing consciousness about waste and sustainability? We ask a marketing professor and Lazada's Chief Business Officer on Heart of the Matter:</div> </h4>
<h2>SO WHAT SHOULD YOU GIVE THIS CHRISTMAS?</h2>
<p>This is not to shut down efforts to slash single-use packaging from our lives, which makes up one-third of domestic waste in Singapore.</p>
<p>But with statistics like these, it’s quite clear that gifting metal straws or bamboo cutlery won’t move the needle on reducing waste and other harms done to the planet.</p>
<p>So if our choice of tableware is distraction, rather than solution to a problem on a literal global scale, then what can we do?</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that beyond reusing, two other important principles of zero-waste are to refuse and reduce. Instead of showering people with metal straws, why not avoid straws altogether?</p>
<p>In my mind, straws are only permissible in bubble tea or milkshakes. If medically, you need a straw, then by all means go ahead.</p>
<p>So if we opt out of buying unnecessary things, then what should we give this Christmas?</p>
<p>Perhaps we could give our time instead of an item. In this attention economy, time is much more valuable than money anyway.</p>
<p>For the busy bees out there, carving out an evening for dinner might be even more challenging than buying cloth pouches en masse at the mall. Your friends will appreciate you all the more for doing the former.</p>
<p>And if a meal sounds too basic, how about an experience? Performing arts groups put on a lot of shows, Christmas-related or not, around the December holidays. Plus, you support the local arts scene, which has been hit hard by the pandemic.</p>
<p>These suggestions might reek of bourgeois post-materialism, but if we’re serious about conscious consumerism, the circular economy and whatever else invoked at sustainability forums, this is the simplest path to walk.</p>
<p>This Christmas, give those metal straws a pass, and instead, catch up with your loved one over a meal. If you’re doing takeaway, bonus points if you BYO.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Business </a> </p> <h1> European stores pull products linked to Brazil deforestation </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>PARIS: Several European supermarket chains are dropping Brazilian beef products linked to destruction of the Amazon rainforest and tropical wetland, the US activist group Mighty Earth said on Thursday (Dec 16).</p>
<p>Chains such as Carrefour Belgium have committed to pulling from their shelves corned beef, beef jerky and fresh prime cuts suspected to come from cattle raised in the Amazon and the Pantanal tropical wetlands.</p>
<p>Activists have long criticised the environmental footprint of the global meat industry, blaming it for some two-thirds of global biodiversity loss.</p>
<p>It has also accused meat processing firms of not delivering on promises to end deforestation in their supply chains.</p>
<p>Carrefour withdrew Jack Link's brand beef jerky, a pledge also made by Belgian supermarket Delhaize, and Auchan of France similarly said it would be removing beef jerky products linked to JBS.</p>
<p>"We look at the origin of the products that we would have in other countries - if we find any - to make similar decisions if the case arises," Carrefour's director of corporate social responsibility Agathe Grossmith told AFP.</p>
<p>Mighty Earth said other chains including Albert Heijn in the Netherlands, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Princes in Britain were taking similar initiatives.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Sainsbury's, which sources the bulk of its beef products from Britain and Ireland, told AFP the company was taking measures to ensure sourcing of its corned beef products outside Brazil.</p>
<p>An Albert Heijn spokesperson told AFP that "we have now taken the decision to eliminate progressively Brazilian beef and are seeking out alternatives from other countries of origin."</p>
<h2>MURKEY INDIRECT SUPPLIERS</h2>
<p>The measures come as the European Union brings in new legislation designed to fight deforestation. Mighty Earth director Nico Muzi said in a statement he saw the "noose tightening" around the necks of those involved in deforestation.</p>
<p>Brazil's top beef exporters defended their environmental records.</p>
<p>JBS, the world's biggest meat company, said it had "no tolerance" for illegal deforestation and had "proactively blocked" more than 14,000 suppliers to date.</p>
<p>However, it acknowledged that "the challenge for JBS, and for the beef cattle supply chain in general, is to guarantee this same control over the suppliers of its suppliers."</p>
<p>It says it is implementing a platform using blockchain technology to eliminate deforestation from its indirect supply chain by 2025.</p>
<p>Brazil has struggled to deal with "cattle laundering", in which ranches that are blacklisted for deforestation illegally sell their animals to "clean" ranches that then sell them to meat-processing companies.</p>
<p>Minerva Foods, another top exporter, said it "has been a pioneer" in identifying and fighting deforestation, and "has made a commitment to ensure zero illegal deforestation throughout the supply chain in South America by 2030."</p>
<p>Another top firm accused in the report, Marfrig, said it "is absolutely committed to social and environmental issues" and to finding ways to "integrate its (supply) chain and bring more transparency to its operations".</p>
<p>The Amazon is the world's largest tropical rainforest. Deforestation, after falling for several years, has risen since far-right President Jair Bolsonaro came to power in 2019.</p>
<p>Brazil's National Institute for Space Research said last month deforestation had hit a 15-year high this year.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the cleared land is used for cattle ranching.</p>

<p>SINGAPORE: Seven bus stops in Singapore have been transformed into urban farms and are expected to produce more than 100kg of fresh produce for a local charity kitchen by mid-January, GIC said on Friday (Dec 17).</p>
<p>The initiative is a partnership between the sovereign wealth fund and local urban farming school Gardens with Purpose, and was launched to commemorate GIC’s 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>A mixture of fresh produce including butterhead lettuce, Chinese cabbage, and Kai Lan, have been planted at the bus stops. </p>
<p>Gardens with Purpose planted the vegetables from seeds in their farm, and these plants will continue to grow at the bus stops until they are ready to be harvested.</p>
<p>The vegetables will be tended by a team of 50 gardening enthusiasts from the community every week.</p>
<p>Crops that are ready to be harvested at the end of each week will be taken from the bus stops and delivered to Willing Hearts, a charity kitchen that prepares and distributes 9,500 meals daily to beneficiaries in Singapore.</p>
<p>The team will replace the harvested vegetables with new vegetables at a different stage of growth, until they are ready to be harvested as well.</p>
<p>GIC said the bus stops were chosen for their "traffic and visibility" to raise awareness about sustainable food production.</p>
<p>The bus stops are located at:</p>
<li>NUS Bukit Timah Campus</li>
<li>Opposite Cold Storage Jelita</li>
<li>Singapore Polytechnic School of Science and Tech</li>
<li>Before Bencoolen Station Exit A</li>
<p>Responding to queries from CNA, GIC said the structure for the urban farms was created around existing six-sheet shells, which are typically used for advertisements at bus stops. It declined to comment on the cost of each setup.</p>
<p>The edible urban farms will be on display for four weeks until Jan 12. After that, all harvested crops will be donated to Willing Hearts, said GIC.</p>
<p>Equipment such as planter boxes, ventilation fans, grow lights and water tanks will go back to Gardens with Purpose, where some will reused by other gardening enthusiasts to grow their own vegetables at home.</p>
<p>GIC added that all farming equipment used at these bus stops will be reused to ensure zero waste.</p>
<p>“We hope these urban farms at bus stops will spark ideas on how we can garden more at home or in the community,” said GIC's chief investment officer for fixed income and chair of the sustainability committee Liew Tzu Mi.</p>
