<p>1. Your emotional barometer is not properly calibrated for the current environment, which could lead to the following negative emotions and reactions.</p>
<li> <p>Anxiety: High levels of anxiety make you try to fix everything that is wrong in your life (and everyone else’s, too).</p> </li>
<li>Panic: Clinging and holding on like your life depended on it.</li>
<li><a>Depression</a>: Giving up and feeling hopeless because anxiety, panic, and anger don’t seem to work in getting you the love and security you need.</li>
<li>Dissociation: Feeling so out of it or emotionally disorganized that you stop trying to solve anything.</li>
<li>Emotional cut-off: Shutting down your emotions to the point that you become unresponsive and unavailable to others.</li>
<p>2. Your road map for predicting cause-and-effect linkages in relationships is faulty and might lead you to believe:</p>
<li>That anyone who says they love you is going to hurt you and wound you deeply.</li>
<li>Other people are unpredictable and will go astray if you don’t keep a close eye on them.</li>
<li>If other people say they care and are available for you, they are really going to smother you and suck the life out of you.</li>
<li>Other people are not worth investing in and you should just count on yourself and your own success.</li>
<p>3. You cannot accurately read when someone is safe and available to you.</p>
<li>You trust others and invest in people who are emotionally unavailable.</li>
<li>You believe that no one can be trusted and so you stay alone and isolated.</li>
<li>You perceive that other people have ill intent and so you aggress on them.</li>
<p>4. Putting success and work ahead of your relationships and people who rely on you.</p>
<li>You get your social needs met indirectly, believing that others will value and respect you for your work ethic.</li>
<li>You spend so much time working that you do not develop close friendships.</li>
<li>You reach the height of achievement and realize you have no one to share it with.</li>
<li>Your drive for success makes you intolerant and cruel.</li>
<p>5. Mistaking <a>sexual</a> relations for love and security.</p>
<li>You have sex believing that you will not become attached...but you do.</li>
<li>You think others are committed to you even though you never had an actual conversation about commitment.</li>
<li>Love scares you. So, you go frigid with the one you love and turn to sex only with people you would not want relationships with.</li>
<p>These are all prices that you have paid, after the fact, for the bus ride through your childhood and up to this point in time. But you can stop paying and get off that bus.</p>

<h1> Attachment and the Search for the Inner Child </h1>
<h2> Use the idea of the "inner child" to reprogram your emotional system. </h2>
<li>If your emotions are out of sync or way stronger than what the situation calls for, then you may need to do some inner child work. </li>
<li>The goal of inner child work is to write a new life story that works better in terms of how you perceive the social world and react to others.</li>
<li>Using computer metaphors, you can view the inner child as a program and your adult self as the loving parent who's rewriting the program's code. </li>

<h1> Why Some People Can't Let Go of Past Relationships </h1>
<h2> Why we ruminate about some people and not others. </h2>
<li>Some people struggle to move on from past relationships, even years later.</li>
<li>Accepting the facts of the situation and letting the intensity of the memories fade can help people move on from past relationships.</li>
<li>The attachment styles people can form may sometimes influence how they respond to breakups.</li>

<p>The answer may reside in how you process emotions in terms of your <a>attachment</a> style, your attachment-based expectations for the future, and how your emotions interact with your <a>memory</a> system.</p>
<a>catastrophize</a>, idealize, or believe that the love of one specific person can save them, they do not build larger-than-life love stories in their minds. But, contrast this with how things might go for someone with a preoccupied attachment style.
<p>The problem is that this approach rarely works, and you are likely to find yourself in your 40’s feeling melancholy and <a>dreaming</a> about the one who got away.</p>

<h1> Can the Search for Happiness Make You Sad? </h1>
<h2> It is time to redefine what it means to be happy. </h2>
<p> Posted August 10, 2021 </p>
<li>Happiness is often defined as a feeling or mood that is the opposite of sadness. This definition is unhelpful for finding happiness in life.</li>
<li>Happiness is better defined as a state of being. Feelings of sadness do not need to be avoided or take away from one's experience of happiness. </li>
<li>Committing oneself to a life of purpose, living by one's values, and accepting sadness can help in one's pursuit of a happy life.</li>
<h3>The problem lies at least partly in our flawed definitions of happiness.</h3>
<p>According to Vocabulary.com, “Happiness is that feeling that comes over you when you know life is good and you can't help but smile. It's the opposite of sadness.”</p>
<p>The definition also erroneously states that happiness is the opposite of sadness. But this really depends on your age. Research indicates that sadness and happiness are not opposites. They can exist at the same time.</p>
<h3>Sadness does not need to be avoided.</h3>
<a>anxiety</a> and worry, I might even suggest to you that as you make progress and your brain calms down, you could start feeling sadder — and this would be a good thing.
<p>If you can accept your sadness and not be frightened by it, you may find that it is a fairly quiet, deep, and reflective emotion. In that context, sadness does not need to take away your joy in life.</p>
<p>But, in this more mature sense, happiness is not a mood. It is a state of being that is derived from having a sense of integrity, purpose, and meaning in life.</p>
<p>Websters online defines happiness as “a state of well-being and contentment.”</p>
<p>Remember, you can experience well-being and contentment and still be sad. In this sense, happiness is not a mood. It is a state of being.</p>
<h3>Recommendations for finding contentment:</h3>
<li>Accept that sadness is a clean emotion that does not need to be avoided. It does not need to be figured out, explained, or justified.</li>
<li>Get clear on what your values are and live by them. Develop a personal code.</li>
<li>Give yourself time and space to sit and be still.</li>
<p>Note: If you research this topic further, psychologists often use the terms “subjective well-being” or “satisfaction with life” rather than “happiness.”</p>

<li>Don’t let your attachment style choose how frequently you have contact with your child or what the interaction is like.</li>
<li>Agree on one day and time each week when the parent and child will reach out and “touch base.” Try to connect in person or on the telephone, not with text.</li>

<h1> Why You Might Want to Be With Someone You Don’t Really Like </h1>
<h2> Dopamine responses show why we pursue people who don't make us feel good. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Dopamine? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Being without the one you love can be painful. If you are being pushed away or someone is distancing from you, you might feel distressed, even a bit desperate. You truly want them. But do you really like them?</p>
<a>dopamine</a>, can explain why you continue to pursue experiences that, when it comes right down to it, really are not pleasurable to you. And this pattern is particularly salient if you have a dismissing, fearful, or preoccupied
<a>attachment</a> style. These insecure attachment styles sensitize the brain to
<a>stress</a> responses and make you prone to seek out more pleasure in the form of dopamine.
<p>So, if you want the person (dopamine prediction) and are going to stay around, you probably need a way to get the actual dopamine reward back (not just the prediction). Here are some things you can try:</p>
<li>Find other ways to stimulate dopamine release when you are with your person. Find things that are rewarding to you and do them with this person: watch your favorite show, eat your favorite food, or find new ways to have excitement together.</li>

<h1> How We Really Pick Our Romantic Partners </h1>
<h2> Balancing what you can give with what you can get. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Attachment? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to strengthen relationships</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Making yes/no decisions when someone asks you out is not really choosing a partner because you are not pursuing the kind of person you want. </li>
<li>When asked why they chose their partner, most people talk about their own needs and how their partner could fulfill them. </li>
<li>If you choose someone, you should consider what you can give and add to the other person’s life. </li>
<p>Most single people date, and many go on to form more lasting <a>romantic relationships</a> or even permanent couplings. But, to what extent do people consciously choose their partners? </p>
<p>If you are the one being asked out, you are usually making a “yes or no” decision.</p>
<p>Making yes or no decisions is not really choosing because you are not pursuing an intentional goal of obtaining a relationship with a certain kind of person.</p>
<p>So, what would choosing your partner look like? I recently asked clients if they chose their partners. Almost everyone said “yes." And, so, I asked the person to tell their partner why they chose them.</p>
<p>When asked why they chose their partner, most people responded with statements of their own needs and how their partner could fulfill them.</p>
<p>Examples of this type of needs-based choosing include:</p>
<p>“Because she loves me.” “Because he is a great provider.” “Because she takes care of my needs.”</p>
<p>If you choose someone, you should consider what you can give and add to the other person’s life. </p>
<p>Examples of this type of secure-based choosing include:</p>
<p>“Because she is a beautiful person.” “Because I want to give myself to him.” “Because I want to love and cherish her.”</p>
<p>This type of choosing is based in love as something to be given rather than a need to be met.</p>
<p>This type of self-actualized “secure-based choosing” is a value-added proposition whereas needs-based choosing takes away from the other person and comes out of a sense of lack and belief in scarcity.</p>
<a>childhood</a> in the context of how parents respond to the child’s dependency needs. There are four styles. In addition to the secure style described above, these are labeled dismissing, preoccupied, and fearful.

<p>Ironically, for each of the insecure styles, those things that people need from their partners are exactly those aspects of a relationship that they struggle the most to give.</p>
<p>So, whatever your style:</p>
<li>Choose someone who you can value and cherish and whose life you want to add to. Don’t sit and wait and hope that the right person will come to you.</li>
<li>Nurture those aspects of yourself that you can freely give.</li>
<li>Get some of your needs met from people other than your romantic partner.</li>
<li>Try to give to the other person those things that you yourself would most like to receive.</li>
<li>Tell your partner, “I choose you,” and then tell them how you want to enrich their lives. </li>

<div> <h3> Are bullies born or made? </h3> </div>
<a>t happens at an early age;</a> if the normal
<a>aggression</a> of 2-year-olds is not handled with consistency, children fail to acquire internal restraints against such behavior. Bullying remains a very durable behavioral style, largely because bullies get what they want—at least at first.
<div> <h3> What are the psychological features of bullies? </h3> </div>
<a> distinct psychological makeup</a>. They lack prosocial behavior, are untroubled by
<a> anxiety</a>, and do not understand others' feelings. They exhibit a distinctive cognitive feature, a kind of

<a> assertiveness</a> even in nonthreatening situations and radiate
<a> fear</a> long before they ever encounter a bully. These are children who don’t stand up for themselves.
<div> <h3> How do bullies decide who to pick on? </h3> </div>
<a> suitably submissive victims</a>. Bullies like victims who become visibly upset when they are picked on and who do not have friends or allies. Researchers find that those chosen as victims evince insecurity and apprehension.
<div> <h3> What are the distinguishing features of victims? </h3> </div>
<a> Children who become victims</a> offer no deterrent to aggression, which can make them disliked even by their non-bullying peers.
<div> <h3> What are the effects on victims? </h3> </div>

<h2> Why Bullying Is So Harmful </h2>
<div> <h3> Do bullies grow out of it? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why don’t bystanders stop bullies? </h3> </div>
<a> bystanders seldom stop the aggression</a>; they may in fact enjoy the spectacle. Even if they don’t approve of the situation, they may dislike the victim or fear retaliation by the bully.
<div> <h3> How does bullying harm others? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How has the internet changed bullying? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do bullies harm others on the internet? </h3> </div>
<a> direct harassment and relational aggression</a> thrive on the internet. Cyberbullies can spread false rumors with viral speed on social media. They can falsely impersonate someone and conduct all manner of mischief in someone else’s name.
<a>cyberstalking</a> particularly target women. And long after the active bullying has stopped, malicious information can linger on the internet and continue to harm.
<div> <h3> Why is cyberbullying so damaging? </h3> </div>
<a> it can be inescapable</a> and relentless, affording victims no safe haven.

<div> <h3> How do you deal with a bully? </h3> </div>
<a> the most effective way of stopping a bully</a> is to activate bystanders; after all, bystanders reward bullies with

<a> their effectiveness</a>, however, is mixed. Experts explain that schools are where most bullying takes place but they are not where attitudes about power and aggression, skills of

<a> asking teachers</a> during school conferences and by gently asking their children about their social life. Teaching children to fight back is not effective; helping them gain social skills is.

<li>Dogs begin to understand that the make-believe friend is an “approved” outlet for roughhousing and may even begin to voluntarily redirect mischief onto the doll.</li>
<li>The doll, which can appear to “behave” reliably or calmly from the dog’s perspective, may have a soothing effect. In those cases, it can be used as a kind of security blanket or safe friend.</li>

<p>A new approach to living well</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h2>Thinking About Good and Poor Control</h2> <p>Controlling is most straightforward when we help the controlling efforts of others.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Toward a New Model of Leadership</a></h2> <p>Surely any group will be successful when its members are able to achieve their own goals without preventing others from doing the same.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>The World’s Greatest Challenge Isn't COVID-19</a></h2> <p>Global calamities can reveal the goals and standards that leaders actually prioritize regardless of what their rhetoric is.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>When Is Enough Enough? </a></h2> <p>Life is the business of creating and maintaining the world we know in the "just right" states we want it to be in.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h2><a>Shall We Dance? The Music That You Move To</a></h2> <p>A Personal Perspective: Keep dancing no matter what the tune. Contented living arises from the ability to stay the course; finding a way to dance to whatever music is playing.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Why You Don't Have to Worry About Achieving Goals Anymore</a></h2> <p>Failing to achieve a goal often just means another goal is being satisfied instead.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <h2><a>Life Is a Limiting Factor</a></h2> <p>Social groups that are characterized by shrinking opportunities for many and simultaneously burgeoning opportunities for a few are precariously imbalanced.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Have You Ever Been Told You Should Live in the Moment?</a></h2> <p>Whenever you are noticing being in the moment in the moment, you are not doing the activity in the moment in which you were previously engaged.</p> </div> </div>
