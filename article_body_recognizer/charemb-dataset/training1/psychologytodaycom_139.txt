<p>The majority of cases occur in persons younger than 35 years of age. There is some evidence that the neurotransmitter serotonin may play a role in this disorder.</p>
<p>The disorder is probably more common than realized and may be an important cause of violent behavior. Some studies have found that intermittent explosive disorder is more common in men.</p>
<p>Lives have been torn apart by intermittent explosive disorder, but treatment can help affected individuals control the aggressive impulses.</p>
<a>behavioral modification</a>; in fact, studies show that a combination of both approaches offers the best prognosis. Group

<p>Studies suggest that patients with intermittent explosive disorder respond to treatment with <a>antidepressants</a>, anti-<a>anxiety</a> agents in the <a>benzodiazepine</a> family, anticonvulsants, and mood stabilizers.</p>

<h2> Understanding Impulse Control Disorders </h2>
<div> <h3> How common are impulse control disorders? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The disorders themselves are rare, each affecting approximately 1 to 3 percent of the population. Combined, however, ICDs affect a significant number of children and adults. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> How do the symptoms of impulse control disorders usually manifest? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can impulse control disorders be cured? </h3> </div>
<a>cooperation</a>, the prognosis is considered to be generally positive. In most cases, children generally see greater improvement than adults, who are more likely to dismiss treatment or be uncooperative.
<div> <h3> How do you treat impulse control disorders? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can medication treat impulse control disorders? </h3> </div>
<a>medication</a> and therapy. Kleptomania, for example, is often treated with SSRIs, while intermittent explosive disorder may respond to antidepressants, anxiolytics, or anticonvulsants. 
<div> <h3> Is ADHD an impulse control disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>ADHD</a> display impulsive behavior, ADHD is not classified as an impulse control disorder; rather, in the
<p>To learn more about causes, symptoms, and treatment of ADHD, see the <a>ADHD Center</a>.</p>
<div> <h3> Is trichotillomania an impulse control disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>obsessive-compulsive</a> disorders. Many experts still theorize that BFRBs are related to impulse control disorders in some way, though the exact relationship is unknown.
<p>To learn more about BFRBs, see <a>Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors</a>.</p>
<div> <h3> Is addiction an impulse control disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>motivation</a> to seek drugs. What’s more, impulse control disorders are risk factors for addiction. Thus, understanding the connection between impulse control challenges and substance use may help individuals better manage both conditions.

<h2> Intermittent Explosive Disorder </h2>
<p>To learn more about causes, symptoms, and treatment of intermittent explosive disorder, see our <a>Diagnosis Dictionary.</a></p>
<div> <h3> What causes intermittent explosive disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is intermittent explosive disorder a neurological disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>Additional research</a> has found that the disorder is associated with lower white matter integrity and lower grey matter volume in the connections between the frontal lobe and other brain regions, which may contribute to impaired social
<a>cognition</a> and greater difficulty regulating emotions.
<div> <h3> Can rage be harmful to your health? </h3> </div>
<a>“rage attacks” were more susceptible to heart attacks</a> and stroke—especially in the hours immediately following an outburst—likely due to spikes in blood pressure and vascular resistance caused by
<a>stress</a>. Though one instance of anger will not confer a large amount of risk, the researchers warn, frequent bouts of anger can lead to accumulated risk over time.
<div> <h3> What are the symptoms of intermittent explosive disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What qualifies someone for a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do you treat intermittent explosive disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>shame</a> afterward. Though some people with kleptomania are able to steal without being caught, many find themselves in trouble with the law—some estimates suggest that up to 20 percent of people arrested for shoplifting suffer from kleptomania.
<p>For more on causes, symptoms, and treatment of kleptomania, see our <a>Diagnosis Dictionary.</a></p>
<div> <h3> What causes kleptomania? </h3> </div>
<a>dopamine</a>, which play a role in aggression and how the brain responds to reward. There may also be imbalances in the brain’s opioid system, which influences one’s ability (or inability) to resist urges.
<div> <h3> When does kleptomania usually start? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Kleptomania can develop as early as childhood, though in most cases it begins to manifest in adolescence or young adulthood. In very rare cases, it develops in later adulthood.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Are men or women more likely to have kleptomania? </h3> </div>
<a>gender</a> is not well-understood. Some evidence suggests, however, that women tend to develop the disorder later than men and have a greater tendency to hoard the items they steal. 
<div> <h3> What are the symptoms of kleptomania? </h3> </div>
<p>According to the DSM-5, the symptoms of kleptomania include:</p>
<p>• A frequent, persistent urge to steal unneeded items, with no motive of financial gain</p>
<p>• A feeling of tension leading up to the theft, followed by intense feelings of pleasure or relief at the time of the theft</p>
<div> <h3> How do you treat kleptomania? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can aversion therapy treat kleptomania? </h3> </div>
<p>To learn more about causes, symptoms, and treatment of pyromania, see our Diagnosis Dictionary.</p>
<div> <h3> What causes pyromania? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do some people like setting fires? </h3> </div>
<p>Individuals with pyromania often feel deeply fascinated by fire, and may feel a sense of euphoria upon setting one and watching it burn. They may feel an internal tension before a fire is set, which gives way to immense relief once it is. </p>
<div> <h3> Is pyromania the same as arson? </h3> </div>
<a>crime</a>, or some other clear (if often immoral or criminal) cause. Pyromania, by contrast, is internally motivated—the fires are set for emotional gratification, not for money or personal gain. 
<div> <h3> What are the symptoms of pyromania? </h3> </div>
<p>The symptoms of pyromania include:</p>
<p>• An interest in and <a>attraction</a> to fire</p>
<p>• Deliberately setting multiple fires</p>
<p>• A feeling of excitement or tension that occurs before the fire is set, followed by relief or pleasure</p>
<a>manic episode</a>, or antisocial tendencies.

<h2> What psychoanalysis with a real-life Tony Soprano looks like. </h2>
<p>From the moment I heard Michael’s voice on my answering machine, I felt intrigued and intimidated.</p>
<p>I suggested he come in for a consultation so he could ask questions, see how I work, and tell me about himself. He told me he was amenable, but warned me (or boasted) that his schedule was very busy. We set up an appointment for the following week.</p>

<a>shame</a> hidden under his anger, because, on occasion, I utilize a similar

<p>And then something incredible happened. Michael’s eyes welled up. It was only for a moment, and I almost didn’t see it. “Michael, what are you feeling,” I asked.</p>
<p>“Nothing,” he said, angrily. I paused. Should I retreat, or push on?</p>
<p>Michael’s eyes welled up again, but this time he couldn’t stop the tears. “Damn it,” he said, in a voice that combined anger with sorrow. “I cannot cry. It only makes things worse.”</p>
<p>I asked him how it made things worse.</p>
<p>Michael sighed. “I don’t know, Eric, I just don’t know.”</p>

<h1> Beyond Anger Management </h1>
<h2> Don’t manage the protective emotion; manage the perceived need for protection. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> How Can I Manage My Anger? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist to heal from anger</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Everyone gets angry occasionally.</p>
<p>Not all anger is a problem. </p>
<p>You have an anger problem if some subtle form of anger or resentment makes you do something against your long-term best interest, or keeps you from acting in your long-term best interests.</p>
<p>The latter can be quite subtle, like putting a chilly wall between you and someone you love. That won't get you arrested, but it will ruin your life. And you're not choosing to do to it; the low-grade anger is making you do it.</p>
<p>Alas, “<a>Anger Management</a>”</p>
<p>One of the most unfortunate terms in behavioral science is “anger <a>management</a>.” Anger is a protective emotion. What we have to manage is the perceived need for protection and the choice of what to protect.</p>
<p>Fragile egos result from the <a>guilt</a>, <a>shame</a>, and <a>anxiety</a> that occurs when we violate or ignore our deeper values.</p>
<p>Managing anger does nothing for the guilt, shame, and anxiety that create fragile egos and a sense of entitlement. </p>
<p>A viable anger-regulation technique enhances self-value by reinforcing one's deeper values. It makes anger and entitlement unnecessary as ego-defense.</p>
<a>unconscious</a> emotion. Trouble is, anger occurs about 5,000 times faster than you can say, "I'm angry." That's why Mr. Hyde can't remember what Dr. Jekyll learned in anger management class.
<p>By the time we’re adults, most emotions are conditioned responses. We feel more or less the same way whenever certain things happen in certain physiological and mental states.</p>
<p>Here is the conditioned response that produces anger:</p>
<p>Temporary drops in energy, <a>confidence</a>, or self-value automatically trigger blame. ("I feel uncomfortable, somebody must be doing something to me.")</p>
<p>Blame creates feelings of powerlessness. ("If my bad feelings are someone else's fault, there's nothing I can do about it.") Anger is a cry of powerlessness. Most problem anger is about things we have no control over.</p>
<p>When you feel valuable, you don't want to blame. You want to improve, appreciate, connect, or protect.</p>

<h3>Lessons in Anger Management</h3>
<p>However, no one in my group was actually in any danger. The danger was in their thought process. Anger is often a result of misunderstanding other people's actions and assigning our own meaning to them. </p>
<h3>Quick Tips for Managing Your Anger in Everyday Life</h3>
<p>1. Recognize the triggers for your anger, like specific comments, family members, friends, or places that tend to upset you.</p>
<p>2. Try to place yourself in the other person's shoes, seeking to understand where that person is coming from.</p>
<p>3. Pay <a>attention</a> to your body's warning signs of anger: tightness in shoulders, increased heart rate, hot face.</p>
<p>4. Continue an approach that works for you. This could include concentrating on your breathing, <a>meditation</a>, evaluating your thoughts, listening to music, going for a walk, or changing your environment.</p>

<p>Here are five different ways to manage your anger that target different points of the anger process.</p>
<p>2. Consider Alternative Interpretations</p>
<p>Imagine, for example, that someone cuts you off on the highway. You can interpret that a couple of different ways:</p>
<ul><li>It was intentional—"He saw me and did it on purpose."</li> <li>It was unintentional—"He must not have seen me."</li> </ul>
<p>While both might be frustrating, the former belief (that it was intentional) will likely fuel greater anger. Try to consider other ways of looking at the situation and maybe even try to test those alternative interpretations.</p>

<h1> The Intrigue of Revenge Fantasies </h1>
<h2> Who is prone to them, what role they play, and how to effectively heal. </h2>
<li>Thoughts of revenge are especially likely in individuals who have been victimized and traumatized by others, especially those with PTSD.</li>
<li>Revenge serves to balance out the victim's suffering and the perpetrator's actions, regulating feelings of injustice and loss of control.</li>
<li>Self-acceptance and self-compassion can help individuals overcome the desire for revenge.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Erik Mclean/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The desire for revenge is a universal personal response in all human cultures. The <a>greater the harm</a> and transgression caused, typically the greater the desire for revenge.</p>
<a>humiliation</a>. They have all experienced recurrent revenge
<a>fantasies</a>. Together we have worked through their anger, sadness, and
<a>defined</a> as “an action in response to some perceived harm or wrongdoing by another party that is determined to inflict damage, injury, discomfort, or
<a>punishment</a> to the party judged responsible.” But Robert Biswas-Diener, a researcher and author on
<a>happiness</a>, asserts that to understand revenge we need to talk about embitterment, which is a feeling that often gets overlooked.
<a>Embitterment</a> is a sense of having been let down or victimized, coupled with a desire to fight back, but because the person feels helpless, it leads to fantasies of revenge or
<a>aggression</a>. Here we see embitterment as the feeling and revenge as what is acted out due to the feeling that gets evoked.
<a>Knoll </a>terms "retributive functional symmetry," whereby an injustice committed by a person is then repaid with a similar injustice to that person. Current modern Western thought considers
<a>revenge taboo</a> and encourages
<a>childhood</a>. Children are prone to revenge fantasies, as at some point in their lives they can want revenge against their parents. Their fantasy play, daydreams, and
<a>assertive</a>” thoughts and feelings.
<h3>People Who Are Prone to Revenge Fantasies</h3>
<a>Thoughts of revenge </a>are especially likely in individuals who have been victimized and traumatized by others. According to one
<a>study</a>, it is also more likely to present in individuals who are diagnosed with Posttraumatic
<a>PTSD</a>) than individuals who do not meet the criteria for PTSD. In another
<a>study</a>, revenge fantasies are common but are not only specific to PTSD, complicated grief, or other stress response diagnoses.

<h3>The Purpose of Revenge Fantasies</h3>
<a>self-confidence</a>, self-belief, and
<a>self-efficacy</a>. These experiences of humiliation and unjust hurt caused by another can understandably elicit the desire to seek revenge and fantasies of revenge.
<a>Knoll</a> remarks that revenge feelings may arise as a result of attempts to protect a sense of self. There are
<a>anxiety</a> as well as grief.
<h3>How People Experience Revenge Fantasies</h3>
<a>array of emotions</a> are present. These
<a>include</a> anger at perpetrators,
<a>fear</a> about trusting others, despair over the harshness of the world, and a general disgust with the injustices of the world. They are typically also blended with feelings of judgment and
<a>self-loathing</a> over the personal vulnerability that failed to allow them to adequately protect themselves, layered with the positive emotional effects which are allowing them to feel some power and strength through the fantasies.

<h1> Why Does Outrage Often Feel So Good? </h1>
<h2> Virtue signaling and the multiple functions of outrage </h2>
<li>Outrage can be a way to expose wrongdoers. But public expressions of outrage may also serve to improve how others see the expresser.</li>
<li>The importance of status to the ancestors of modern humans could help explain the endurance of derogation as a social behavior.</li>
<li>Outrage may elevate an individual's status partly by suggesting that the person is above others.</li>

<h3>Two Basic Kinds of Outrage</h3>
<h3>Outrage, Moral Grandstanding, and Virtue Signaling</h3>
<ul><li>How could anyone even think such a thing?</li> <li>Who would do that?</li> <li>What kind of person would do that?</li> <li>Can you believe that she did that?</li> <li>I would never do that!</li> </ul>

<p>Importantly, this post is decidedly NOT a political post. Sure, I have my own political orientation and opinions, but this post is about a more basic psychological process that underlies modern-day <a>politics</a> across the political spectrum. </p>
<p>The kind of outrage expressed in these cases is decidedly different than the kind of outrage that one might feel and express after being slighted by a close other.</p>
<p>Virtue-signaling-based outrage seems to be much more about sending out signals about oneself. It is essentially putting others down in an (often <a>unconscious</a>) effort to raise oneself up. </p>

<p>Here are five things we know:</p>
<p>1. Masculinity is associated with anger.</p>
<p>2. When men’s masculinity is threatened, they react with increased anger.</p>
<p>3. Challenging men’s <a>testosterone</a> levels yields a similar effect.</p>
<a>caretaking</a> or doing housework.
<p>4. Masculinity is also related to right-wing authoritarian attitudes.</p>
<a>confidence</a>), toughness (a belief that men should be physically tough and aggressive), and anti-femininity (a belief that men should avoid stereotypically feminine activities). All three were correlated with right-wing authoritarianism,
<a>prejudice</a>, and anti-gay aggression.
<p>5. "Dormant masculinity" becomes visible when men get drunk.</p>
