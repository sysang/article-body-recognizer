<h2> Feeling betrayed by loved ones can interfere with healing from abuse. </h2>
<li>High-profile cases of childhood abuse show the challenges of holding enablers accountable along with perpetrators.</li>
<li>For some abuse survivors, not being protected or heard can feel more devastating than the abuse itself.</li>

<a>sexual assault</a> and childhood abuse—such as the downfall of USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar—have shed some light on this pattern of
<a>attention</a> to the other players that can be involved in childhood abuse, apart from the perpetrator—and helps highlight why some predators are able to abuse multiple victims before getting caught.
<h3>When You're Betrayed By Those Who Should've Protected You</h3>
<a>trauma</a> is confronting the pain and
<a>sibling</a>, or other family members during childhood. It takes hard work and persistence to face the truth about people who were supposed to love and protect you.
<p>After this kind of betrayal, finding ways to trust others again is a slow process. How can people find ways to heal from betrayal and reclaim their right to feel safe in their relationships?</p>
<h3>Facing Betrayal After Trauma</h3>
<p>1. Try to find words to express your feelings.</p>
<p>2. Do not try to face all your feelings in one day—or one week, or even one month. </p>
<p>Remember, many trauma survivors buried their emotions for years or decades. Emotions tend to build up over time—and once we finally face them, they can feel overwhelming. It takes courage to ask for help. It is not a sign of weakness</p>
<p>There is no right or wrong answer to these questions. If you need help figuring out how to best take care of yourself, talk to someone who understands this kind of betrayal. That person could be a therapist, a friend, or a mentor. </p>
<p>4. Educate yourself about the role of enablers in childhood abuse or sexual assault. </p>
<p>5. Work on rebuilding trust with new people who aren't associated with the abuse.</p>
<p>6. Hold your boundary with people who have shown that they are not trustworthy. </p>
<p>At times, feelings of isolation and despair may lead you to reconsider going back to the people who betrayed you. While this is an understandable impulse, it can lead to future hurt. </p>
<a>revenge</a> for being silenced or disbelieved.
<p>You are so much more than an abuse survivor. You are not defined by the family you were born into, or by the trauma you experienced. You can make different choices than the people who chose to enable or participate in the abuse done to you.</p>

<h1> Wait, Are We Back Here Again? </h1>
<h2> Coping with the pain of yet another COVID-19 wave. </h2>
<li>Many aspects of the past several weeks are reminiscent of those of early 2020. </li>
<li>Reminders of stressful earlier experiences can trigger trauma-related reactions. </li>
<li>It may be beneficial to remind ourselves that much is different, and that there are ways to stay grounded. </li>
<h3>When Painful Memories Return </h3>
<p>In those with a history of trauma, re-experiencing the moments around the event can be tortuous. Flashbacks of imagery, smells, or sensations re-create a memory that feels very real, and very much in the present.</p>
<a>traumatic</a> events. The terror returns, along with increases in heart rate, shallow, rapid breaths, shaking hands, and blurred vision. This is not the fleeting disruption of a disturbing thought, but rather a physiological earthquake demanding our
<a>attention</a> and, ideally, safe escape.
<h3>How Can We Begin to Cope With These Experiences?</h3>
<p>In other words, what you may be feeling in the moment can be named, tolerated, and allowed to pass through. It will not last forever.</p>
<a>mindfulness</a>: how can we bring our awareness to the present moment? We work on focusing attention on our breath, our feet firmly planted on the floor, our hands with fingertips lightly touching.
<h3>This Pandemic Is an Ongoing Traumatic Experience</h3>
<li>My family is vaccinated.</li>
<li>This current variant appears (fingers crossed) to be less deadly.</li>
<li>Thanks to our unbelievable scientists, new treatments are emerging regularly.</li>
<li>I don’t look forward to homeschooling while working, but I know I will be able to continue caring for others, both related to me and those seeking my professional help. </li>
<p>We are a family and we love each other. We have a safe place to sleep at night and lots of good food to eat. We are all healthy. We have a lot of family who we love and love us. You are special and kind.</p>
<a>resilient</a>, enduring the uncertainty together.

<p>Dennis Hopper (d. 2010) is the lead character and director of Out Of The Blue, first released in 1980 and now digitally renewed, distributed, and touring the country. It has lost none of its raw depiction of human pain.</p>
<p>Forty years later, a group of Hopper aficionados redid this dismal, though timeless film, where nothing redemptive will see the light of day. They did not remake the movie to cheer us up, we must conclude. </p>
<p>Yet, might this 40-year-old film have foreshadowed our nation’s current social divide? Were the writers prescient, peering ahead to our lives today? If so, I hope they’re not right about the body count.</p>

<h1> Five Common Misconceptions About Trauma </h1>
<h2> How the science of post-traumatic growth revolutionizes our approach to trauma. </h2>

<p>In this piece, she dispels the many misconceptions about the effect of <a>traumatic</a> events on our lives.</p>
<h4>Myth 1. Trauma is a life sentence</h4>
<p>Every survivor I spoke with believed in the beginning that the trauma had destroyed their life forever, and that they would never be happy again.</p>
<a>grief</a>, or trauma, by default they often pay more
<a>attention</a> to the patients who suffer the most. However, it is vital to look closely: While many people will suffer from post-traumatic
<a>stress</a> in the aftermath of trauma, few will develop full-blown
<a>PTSD</a> (so-called post-traumatic stress disorder), and even of those, most will heal with
<p>I believe that we belittle survivors by assuming that they will fail. People can be at their most vulnerable, but still tenacious at the same time.</p>
<p>University of Minnesota psychologist Ann Masten who has studied resilient children for nearly four decades calls our ability to adapt “ordinary magic." </p>
<p>We are stronger than we think.</p>
<h4>Myth 2. You only experience trauma after a life-threatening event</h4>
<p>Nobody is invincible, and none of us is resilient in all areas of our lives. It is not always the trauma with a capital T that pull the rug out from under us, but it can be everyday traumas such as a divorce, the loss of a loved one, or a surgery.</p>
<p>Pain is as piercing as we feel it. We never know what will etch itself indelibly into our heart.</p>
<h4>Myth 3. Posttraumatic stress is a disorder</h4>
<a>Psychiatric</a> Manual classifies PTSD as a mental disorder when it lasts for longer than six months, but Tedeschi prefers to recognize this “disorder” as “actually just an expression of our humanity."

<p>As Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl famously said, “An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behavior.”</p>
<h4>Myth 4. If you’re strong, you can make it through the trauma by yourself.</h4>
<p>Now every soldier carries a phone number that he or she can call at any time, anonymously, when they need help.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, when things get dire and we don’t know where to turn for help, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline can be a lifesaver. Call 1-800-273-8255 in the U.S.</p>
<p>We need to acknowledge the wound, tend to it, and don’t be afraid to reach out for help. Again and again!</p>

<a>parenting</a> practices is taking off online and it’s landing well with social media users. “Not being heard” is defined as a key feature of
<a>childhood</a> trauma by American psychologist
<a>posts that posit trauma is universal.</a> Thousands of commenters pour in to echo the same sentiment—all their difficult feelings suddenly make sense—it’s trauma.
<a>Campbell and Manning </a>noted that stories of suffering and victimhood are shared as a necessary component of high moral status.

<a>bias</a> toward possibly benign childhood experiences. While over half the American population is likely to go through an event that may be classified as trauma exposure,
<a>less than 10% </a>are likely to have a trauma response to that event and even fewer will go on to develop
<a>a commentary in Medscape </a>argues that “viewing more and more of modern life through the lens of trauma, we may overmedicalize normal emotional responses to stressors and undermine human
<a>resilience</a> in the face of adversity.”

<a>Studies have shown</a> that survivors of childhood trauma have altered neurobiological
<a>insomnia</a>, recurring nightmares, flashbacks, audio-visual processing difficulties, and hallucination-like experiences called derealization or depersonalization. Trauma survivors may find their destabilization is more akin to
<a>psychosis</a> than any particular feeling. So while trauma may include emotional dysregulation, emotional dysregulation does not infer trauma, and psychologists have the obligation to differentiate rather than blur these two concerns.
