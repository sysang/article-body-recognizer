<p>"I'm shook up," Gay said the day after the shooting. "It was scary. Everyone was sprinting out of the mall as sirens went over [the] intercom saying, 'Emergency. Evacuate. Seek shelter.'"</p>
<p>Authorities said that Lane and his companion, who police have not named, fled after the shootout. Roughly 100 police officers, including SWAT teams, conducted a search of the mall after the incident.</p>
<p>A judge issued a $1 million bail Wednesday for both men during a court appearance.</p>
<p>Berlin said a total of 12 shots were fired in the gun battle, and mall security estimates that between 15,000 and 20,000 people were in the mall at the time.</p>
<p>Berlin said there is no evidence Lane's companion was one of the gunmen. He said prosecutors have spoken to that man's attorney and expect to speak with him soon.</p>
<p>Investigators recovered both guns used in the shooting and found DNA matched to Lane and Williams on those weapons, he said.</p>
<p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced Wednesday that the state would dedicate $100 million and 200 National Guard troops to help health care professionals overwhelmed by a recent dramatic increase in the state's COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Kemp added that half of the National Guard troops will assist medical personnel in hospitals. Others will help at testing sites.</p>
<p>"This will be a challenge really across the country over the next two or three weeks," Kemp said at a news conference. "But as fast as it's moving, hopefully this will be a shorter life span than what we've seen in the past."</p>
<p>Katie Byrd, a spokesperson for Kemp, said in a statement that while Kemp does not plan to implement any vaccine mandates, he encourages Georgia residents to talk to their doctors about the benefits of the vaccine.</p>
<p>This fifth wave has surpassed both an early January peak and the Delta wave that roared through Georgia as schools opened in August and September.</p>
<p>The state Department of Public Health and hospital officials urged people not to go to emergency rooms just for COVID-19 tests.</p>
<p>Infections and hospitalizations have been centered in the Atlanta area and parts of north Georgia so far.</p>
<p>Deployment of the 200 troops will begin January 3. The Department of Public Health, additionally, is expanding staffing at COVID-19 test sites and working to secure a new testing site near Atlanta's airport, Kemp said.</p>
<p>But the Republican governor reiterated his opposition to mandates, saying he will not be implementing any measures that shutter businesses or divide the vaccinated from the unvaccinated or masked from the unmasked.</p>
<p>Kukawski was found dead in the trunk of her car last week by police a day after she was reported missing, and her 49-year-old boyfriend Jason Barker was arrested Tuesday on murder and other charges.</p>
<p>Kukawski worked for Boulevard Management and over the course of her career represented several celebrities including <a>Kim Kardashian</a>, Nicki Minaj, Offset, <a>Kanye West</a> and the estate of Tupac Shakur, <a>according to Variety</a>.</p>
<p>Barker is in jail on $3.07 million bail on one count of torture and murder, according to jail records reported by ABC7.</p>
<p>Barker has not entered a plea nor responded to the charges. It is not clear whether he has hired an attorney who could comment.</p>
<p>"We are saddened and heartbroken by the loss of our colleague, Angie Kukawski," Todd Bozick of Boulevard Management said in a statement. "Angie was a kind, wonderful person, and she will be greatly missed by all who knew her."</p>
<p>A planned meeting to return stolen dogs turned deadly when one of the individuals in attendance was fatally shot, Texas authorities said Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a video update shared Tuesday by Lt. Robert Minchew with the HCSO's homicide unit, Minchew said the man had been shot in the leg. The man, who has not been publicly identified, was taken to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Minchew said Tuesday the circumstances surrounding the shooting were initially unclear.</p>
<p>"There was a little bit of shoving, and then the guns came out," Minchew said, adding that the deceased individual "was shot right here at the gas station."</p>
<p>Another person believed to be "a friend or acquaintance" of the man who was shot ran into the nearby Walmart, where they were then detained for questioning by police, according to Minchew.</p>
<p>Gonzales did not specify the number or breeds of dogs that were allegedly stolen or the details of the reward offered for their return.</p>
<p>Once the meeting had been arranged and both parties were in attendance, "a disturbance broke out" between them, Gonzalez said. The person who was fatally shot was "a friend" of the dog owner, he added.</p>
<p>Gonzalez tweeted that the individuals who left the scene of the shooting in the vehicle were believed to be "three light-complexion black males in their 20s."</p>
<p>A photo of the vehicle allegedly involved in the shooting was also released by the sheriff Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Individuals who think they may have information about the shooting were encouraged to contact Crime Stoppers or the HCSO's homicide unit.</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to the HCSO for further comment and will update this article with any response.</p>
<p>The trend over the past week of flight cancellations continued Wednesday, partially due to harsh winter weather across the Pacific Northwest, but mostly because of COVID issues caused by the continued spread of the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Just over 900 flights within, into, or out of the U.S. have been canceled as of mid-afternoon Wednesday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware.</p>
<p>About 13.6 million people passed through TSA security checkpoints over the past week, about double the number for the same period around the holiday season in 2020, and still about 15 percent short of the number of travelers in 2019.</p>
<p>There were nearly 1,300 cancellations for flights entering, leaving or inside the U.S. Tuesday, and about 1,500 on Monday.</p>
<p>Delta, United and JetBlue have all said that the Omicron variant was causing enough staffing issues that flights were canceled.</p>
<p>The Pacific Northwest was slammed with cold and heavy snow over the weekend. Among U.S. airports, Seattle-Tacoma had the highest percentage of incoming and outgoing flights canceled Wednesday, according to FlightAware.</p>
<p>Omicron has intensified already significant staffing issues for airlines, which winnowed workforces in 2020 as air travel collapsed, only to be broadsided when vaccination rates jumped and millions of people felt comfortable flying again this year.</p>
<p>That could translate to travel headaches for hundreds of thousands of people if cancellations maintain the current pace into the weekend.</p>

<div> World Iran <a>Iran Nuclear Deal</a> <a>JCPOA</a></div>
<p>As nuclear deal talks in Vienna show promising signs, Iranian military leaders are using aggressive rhetoric to deter the U.S. and its allies from strikes on the country's nuclear infrastructure.</p>
<p>Last week, Iranian Chief of Staff Major General Mohammad Hossein Bagheri and IRGC commander, Major General Hossein Salami, both said the recent <a>Great Prophet 17 military drill</a> was a direct response to aggressive Israeli rhetoric.</p>
<a>continuing strikes</a> against Iranian and allied targets across the border in Syria. Tehran, the IRGC and Iran's network of proxy forces—among them the Lebanese Hezbollah militia—have been vital in helping President
<a>Bashar al-Assad</a> forces re-take much of the war-torn country.
<a>opposes the JCPOA</a> nuclear deal—which capped Iran's nuclear capabilities for 10 years—and former Prime Minister
<a>Benjamin Netanyahu</a> seemed a powerful influence on former President
<a>Donald Trump</a>'s 2018 decision to withdraw from the accord.
<p>JCPOA signatories—Iran, the U.S., Germany, France, the U.K., Russia, China, and the European Union—are hoping to revive the deal via the ongoing Vienna talks.</p>
<p>Russian and Iranian officials told reporters this week that the eighth round began promisingly. Tehran said success remained possible if other negotiators showed "good faith," while Russia's lead envoy praised "indisputable progress."</p>
<p>"Their strategy is going to backfire if that is their approach," Malley told <a>CNN</a>.</p>
<p>After the seventh round of talks, Secretary of Defense <a>Lloyd Austin</a> told reporters: "The president has made clear that if diplomacy fails, we are prepared to turn to other options."</p>

<p>The suspect in Monday's shooting spree in Denver, Colorado—which killed five people—left behind a <a>Twitter</a> feed boasting about his <a>gun use</a> and promoting <a>misogyny</a>, as well as lamenting the "suppression" of "male honor violence."</p>
<p>Authorities identified Lyndon James McLeod, 47, as the shooter who opened fire at several locations in Denver and nearby Lakewood on Monday afternoon. McLeod was killed in a police-involved shooting in Lakewood.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters, Denver Chief of <a>Police</a> Paul Pazen said McLeod had been "on the radar of law enforcement." Two previous investigations—one in 2020 and the other in early 2021—did not result in state or criminal charges.</p>
<p>McLeod's own Twitter account—which has been inactive since June 2020—provides a disturbing insight into the shooting suspect's extremist ideologies, from a glorification of "honor violence" to his fixation on female chastity.</p>
<p>"Yes I'm a jerk," McLeod tweeted in 2018, during a debate with another user.</p>
<p>"I have high testosterone and low patience. I've been in more steeet [sic] fights than you have teeth. I've been arrested on felony weapons charges. I've had 3 women in bed at once. I'm Aggro as [f***] dude."</p>
<p>These three "women," McLeod claimed in a separate tweet, were "teenaged girls."</p>
<p>In another post, McLeod called <a>CNN host Don Lemon</a> "racist but correct" on the same week as <a>Lemon's statement that white men are "the biggest terror threat in this country"</a> following a 2018 shooting in Kentucky.</p>
<p>"Aggro white males ARE violent will be more violent as they are made irrelevant by a country that HATES them," he wrote. "Their limbic system is in revolt against the modern world.War is coming."</p>
<p>"You can't treat the most aggressive men of your society like [s***] expect to survive," he once wrote.</p>
<h3>'Pain Demands A Response'</h3>
<p>A catchphrase McLeod often used was "Pain demands a response," from his own book trilogy Sanction, which he wrote under the pen name Roman McClay. The books are still up for purchase on <a>Amazon</a> and garnered mostly positive feedback.</p>
<p>According to reviews, both positive and negative, the first book's contents include unapologetic violence, misogyny and racism.</p>
<p>"[T]his book is packed full of rants on diversity, women, and globalization," one reviewer wrote. "There are fantasies of killing people involved in the [Black Lives Matter] movement, and bizarre threats to <a>Ben Shapiro</a>/Sam Harris/and others."</p>
<p>According to another review, McLeod gave his real name to the book's murderous protagonist.</p>
<p>In 2019, McLeod tweeted: "Nobody is scared of anyone any more. TheState [sic] has stopped 99 percent of alphas from engaging in retributive violence; they/we are too scared to lose all we have."</p>
<p>"THAT's why betas females are scamming/disrespecting incessantly. Until real alphas risk jail nothing will change. #Sanction"</p>
<p>McLeod also obsessively debated other users about a perceived requirement for women to remain chaste before marriage, painting women's sexual freedom as the downfall of society.</p>
<p>While he professed not being religious, McLeod <a>once wrote</a>, "I love religion. All religions place a massive sanction on female premarital sex! Religion DEMANDS virginity in women!"</p>
<a>Andrew Yang</a> was "alienating 30 million gun owners to virtue signal to the idiotic left" when rifles "kill less than 150 people a year."
<p>"Gun owners ain't normal," he tweeted in response to another user. "And the most hardcore 1% WILL go to war over this when the sheriff comes to enforce it. Imagine the death toll"</p>
<p>"And for what? To save 150 people a year?"</p>
<p>"I had a $75,000 bond for a weapons charge," he wrote. "I didn't even shoot those cholo [motherf***ers.]"</p>
<p>According to Denver and Lakewood authorities, Denver police first received a 911 call at around 5:25 p.m. on Monday, reporting a shooting that occured at a business on First Avenue and Broadway.</p>
<p>The suspect then broke into a residence in the 200 block of West Sixth Avenue, pursued the occupants and fired gunshots. No injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Police later received a report of a shooting at a residence in the 1200 block of Williams Street, where a man was found shot and killed inside.</p>
<p>The suspect then encountered a lone police officer while continuing his spree on foot. The officer ordered him to drop his weapon, but the shooter approached her and opened fire, striking her once. The agent then shot and killed the suspect.</p>
<p>Police believe the suspect was targeting people who were "known to him," except in Steck's case, where the issue may have been "with the hotel."</p>
<p>"Based on what we know, it does appear that the offender was targeting specific people in this case, the victims were known to the offender," Matt Clark, commander of the Denver Police major crimes division, told reporters.</p>
<p>According to the Denver Post, McLeod previously owned a business named Flat Black Ink Corp. in the area of the second shooting. The business—which McLeod put down as his books' publisher — was listed as delinquent in 2017.</p>
<div> News Gun safety <a>Discrimination</a> <a>Lawsuit</a></div>
<p>A discrimination lawsuit has been filed in Missouri against a firearms store by a prominent Muslim civil rights organization.</p>
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and the Baldwin Vernon law firm filed the lawsuit on Tuesday on behalf of Rania Barakat.</p>
<p>The gun range says it requires shooters to remove all head coverings except baseball caps facing forward. A store manager explained that shrapnel could cause the hijab and skin to burn.</p>
<p>The couple told the manager they had used several other shooting ranges with no problems caused by the hijab and that people wear long sleeves and shirts that cover their necks to protect them from shrapnel, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>The manager said the gun range had different rules, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>CAIR had asked the U.S. Department of Justice in July to investigate civil rights practices at Frontier Justice.</p>
<p>At the time, Bren Brown, Frontier Justice's president, said Barakat was not discriminated against and was asked to follow a dress code that is applied to all patrons equally, The Kansas City Star reported.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>Florida has reported record-breaking daily coronavirus cases three times in the past week as Omicron surges across the United States.</p>
<p>The Sunshine State recorded 46,923 new COVID-19 infections on Wednesday, the highest single-day increase since the pandemic began nearly two years ago.</p>
<p>The new number shattered the previous record set on Christmas Eve of 32,874 daily cases. The day before that, December 23, the daily case record was broken for the first time since August with 31,744 positive tests confirmed.</p>
<p>But the state did break into the top five U.S. states for cases per capita, the <a>Orlando Sentinel</a> reported.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Florida's largest three counties—Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach— saw their case rate spike more than 100 percent.</p>
<a>Ron DeSantis</a> has been under fire for being "MIA" as the Omicron surge hits the state. Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings asked Tuesday, "Where is Ron DeSantis now?' When is the last time you saw the governor do a press briefing on COVID-19?"
<p>Charlie Crist, a Democrat running against DeSantis in 2022, accused DeSantis of providing "ZERO assistance" amid the new wave. Crist called on the governor to deploy the state National Guard to help overwhelmed cities.</p>
<p>DeSantis has emerged as one of the most popular Republican figures in the nation for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic as he fights vaccine mandates and mask requirements for schools and businesses.</p>
<p>The penalty trial of Nikolas Cruz, who pleaded guilty to killing 17 people in a 2018 Florida high school shooting, will be delayed until the end of February.</p>
<p>In a court order, Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer said both the prosecution and defense had asked for more time to prepare their experts. COVID-19 concerns and arguments on what evidence will be permitted also contributed to the delays.</p>
<p>Several victims' parents and relatives who had attended the hearing via Zoom said this apology was likely a ploy to avoid death row.</p>
<p>They also argued that Cruz killing three school employees did not constitute "targeting appointed officials," which is counted as an "aggravating factor" that could justify the death penalty.</p>
<p>However, Scherer denied the defense's motion.</p>
<p>As with most trials, the penalty trial will include evidence such as security video and witness testimony, as well as accounts from victims' families.</p>
<p>Authorities said GPS data helped link a Florida doctor in the murder of a produce delivery driver that was fatally shot nearly two years ago in Vermont.</p>
<p>Jozsef Piri, 49, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Roberto Fonseca-Rivera.</p>
<p>Fonseca-Rivera, 44, was driving on Route 103 in Rockingham making a delivery for Katsiroubas Produce when he was reported missing after not returning to the warehouse later that night, NBC 10 Boston reported.</p>
<p>Fonseca-Rivera was found shot to death after a co-worker told the police the GPS on the truck hadn't moved in a while.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail reported during the incident Fonseca-Rivera was talking to a friend on the phone when he complained about a car driving erratically in front of him, according to the court documents.</p>
<p>The friend on the phone told police he heard Fonseca-Rivera take a "deep inhale" before hearing a sudden loud sound as if he dropped his phone on the ground, The Daily Mail reported.</p>
<p>Police allege Piri was in his truck when he rolled down the back window and shot at Fonseca-Rivera's truck while they were still both driving, <a>the </a>CT Insider reported.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Piri told investigators during a shooting he had been having a "s–t day."</p>
<p>The affidavit said the evidence showed that Fonseca-Rivera was shot from outside the cab of his truck in a way that is consistent with it being fired from another vehicle.</p>
<p>Piri's vehicle was also seen on surveillance video footage from multiple sources as being directly in front of Fonseca-Rivera's truck, the last time just under a mile from where the victim was found dead.</p>
<p>The two men did not know each other, police said.</p>
<p>Piri was initially ordered held without bail. Lawyers agreed to a $250,000 cash bond if certain conditions were met.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Steven Brown said the conditions included that Piri turn over to police any passports and firearms in his possession. If Piri posts bail, he will also be required to follow a strict curfew at his home in Naples, Florida.</p>
<p>Sometime prior to his arrest Piri, an internal medicine physician, moved from West Simsbury, Connecticut, to Naples, Florida.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report. </p>
<p>Some Americans with expired passports will be able to use them for return flights home during the pandemic.</p>
<p>All travelers, regardless of vaccination status, must show proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 24 hours before their flight's departure to the United States, the State Department added. This policy went into effect Dec. 6.</p>
<p>As of Oct. 29, it takes roughly eight to 11 weeks to either get a new or renewed U.S. passport, according to the State Department website. Expedited processing, available for an additional $60 fee, can take five to seven weeks.</p>
<p>U.S. passport holders who need a renewed passport while traveling abroad should contact the U.S. embassy or consulate closest to them, the department noted.</p>
<p>The ongoing pandemic has caused U.S. passport agencies to resort to severely limited operations, causing significant delays. When the agencies resumed regular operations in June 2020, the offices had a backlog of 1.7 million applications.</p>
<p>Initially, the backlog caused wait times for new and renewed passports to extend to 12 to 18 weeks. However, the wait times returned to their current state by late October 2021.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has also caused a recent wave of flight delays and cancellations as end-of-year holiday travel nearly returned to its pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>While icy weather <a>has caused some of the problems</a>, numerous U.S. airlines have cited the Omicron variant as <a>contributing most to the issues</a>.</p>
<a>delayed tens of thousands of travelers</a>, spoiling their holiday plans and leaving them scrambling for alternative flights.
<p>Despite the delays and cancellations, the work shortages may be somewhat alleviated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (<a>CDC</a>) recent shortening of its suggested isolation and quarantine periods.</p>
<p>On Monday, the CDC said those who had been exposed to COVID-19 or tested positive for the virus <a>could stay isolated for just five days</a> rather than the previously suggested 10-day period.</p>
