<h1>Biden told team to 'be prepared' for failed nuclear talks with Iran: Psaki</h1>
<h2>Biden administration takes harsher tone as Iran nuclear agreement remains elusive</h2>
<div><h4><a>Iran anti-government activists talk to Fox News, share urgent message for Biden</a></h4> <p>Activists urge President Biden to side with Iranian protests against the regime; Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn has the exclusive.</p></div>
<p>President Biden has told his national security team to "be prepared" if diplomatic talks fail to stymie Iran from developing its <a>nuclear capabilities</a>. </p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Thursday that Biden continues to believe the best way to stop Iran’s nuclear program is through pursuing diplomatic channels. </p>
<p>But after months of indirectly negotiating with Iran the administration’s patience appears to be wearing thin.</p>

<p>"Given the ongoing advances in Iran’s nuclear program the president has asked his team to be prepared in the event that diplomacy fails," Psaki told reporters. "We must turn to other options and that requires preparations.</p>
<p>"We have made clear to Iran that the only path out of sanctions is through nuclear compliance," she said, adding that the Biden administration has kept all sanctions it inherited from the previous administration in place. </p>
<p>"If diplomacy cannot get on track soon and if Iran’s nuclear program continues to accelerate then we will have no choice but to take additional measures to further restrict Iran’s revenue-producing sectors" the chief White House spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The administration is taking steps to show Iranian officials it is serious in its intent to economically burden Tehran. </p>
<p>Led by the director for the Office of Foreign Assets Control, Andrea Gacki, a delegation of treasury officials will head to the United Arab Emirates next week to ensure that existing sanctions against Iran are being complied with. </p>

<p>Psaki's comments come as the European Union and a Russian envoy meet with Iranian negotiators in Vienna in an attempt to repair the shattered 2015 Iran nuclear deal.</p>
<p>Biden made it a top priority for his administration to bring Iran back to the negotiating table and re-enter the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which fell apart after the U.S. withdrew from the agreement in 2018.</p>
<p>Iran has refused to engage in direct talks with the United States and negotiations have only been further stonewalled since the election of anti-Western President Ebrahim Raisi in June. </p>
<p>Iran has called for all sanctions imposed under the Trump administration to be lifted. But Western officials have reported that Tehran has backtracked on agreements made in previous negotiations, <a>Reuters</a> reported Thursday. </p>
<p>State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the "runway" for diplomatic negotiations is "very short."</p>
<p><a>CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP</a> </p>
<p>"There is not much time left," he told reporters Thursday. Adding the U.S. will stop seeking a path toward mutual JCPOA compliance if Iran does not take negotiations seriously "in the very near future."</p>
<p>"If the Iranian regime suspects the United States of weakness they will be sorely surprised," Price warned. </p>

<h1>State Department says 'too soon to tell' if progress made in latest Iran nuclear talks</h1>
<p>The State Department on Tuesday said it was "too soon to tell" if any progress had been made in restoring the 2015 Iran <a>nuclear deal</a> as talks continue with <a>Tehran</a>.</p>
<p>The eighth round of indirect talks with Iran began Monday in Vienna, in an attempt to salvage the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and reestablish mutual compliance with the nuclear deal.</p>

<p>Iran has refused to engage with U.S. officials directly following the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the agreement in 2018. </p>
<p>Talks were stonewalled for months following the June election of anti-Western President Ebrahim Raisi, before again resuming in late November.</p>
<p>State Department press secretary Ned Price told reporters Tuesday that there "may have been some modest progress" during the course of the last round of talks that concluded a week before Christmas.</p>
<p>"But it is in some ways too soon to say how substantive that progress may have been," he continued. "At a minimum, any progress, we believe, is falling short of Iran’s accelerating nuclear steps and is far too slow."</p>
<p>"This can’t continue, or it will soon be too late to return to mutual compliance with the JCPOA," he added. </p>
<p>BIDEN TOLD TEAM TO 'BE PREPARED' FOR FAILED NUCLEAR TALKS WITH IRAN: PSAKI</p>
<p>Following the U.S. withdrawal from the JCPOA, the Trump administration enforced sanctions on Iran and claimed it was not abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal.</p>
<p>The remaining member nations tied to the deal, including Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the European Union, advised the U.S. against such action and argued it would weaken the deal.</p>

<p>Iran proceeded to further negate the terms of the JCPOA by advancing its nuclear capabilities while simultaneously blocking international access to its program.</p>
<p>U.S. sanctions are at the crux of the negotiating woes as Tehran has unequivocally called for all sanctions placed on Iran during the Trump administration to be revoked. </p>
<p>But given Iran’s nuclear advancement, the Biden administration has not yet agreed to lift any sanctions. </p>
<p>"The fundamental position as of today has not changed," Price said. "Iran has at best been dragging its feet in the talks while accelerating its nuclear escalations."</p>
<p>Price said the U.S. was now assessing terms laid out in December’s negotiations and said the U.S. still believes mutual compliance with the JCPOA can be "quickly" realized "if Iran is serious."</p>
<div> <div><p> State Department spokesman Ned Price speaks during a press briefing at the State Department in Washington, DC, on February 9, 2021. (AP)</p></div></div>
<p>"But we have not yet seen sufficient urgency demonstrated by Iran," he said pointing to Iran’s "vague, unrealistic, unconstructive positions" laid out in previous talks. </p>
<p>It is unclear how many more rounds of talks JCPOA member nations will engage in or if a deal can even be struck, but world leaders have routinely warned time is running out.</p>

<p>Longtime Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who’s high atop former President <a>Donald Trump</a>'s GOP hit list, on Friday announced that she’s running for reelection in 2022.</p>
<p>"My heart is, and always has been, in Alaska, and that’s why I am proud to announce my campaign for reelection to the <a>US Senate</a> in 2022," the senator said in a campaign video announcing her candidacy.</p>

<p>This isn’t the first time Murkowski’s faced a challenging reelection.</p>
<p>Murkowski, the Alaska House of Representatives majority leader, was controversially appointed to the U.S. Senate in late 2002 by her father, who had just resigned from his Senate seat after being elected governor. </p>

<h2>In a TV interview, the vice president reflects on a year that has included criticism from both parties for not spending more time in the U.S.-Mexico border region</h2>

<p>But in a pre-recorded interview set to air Sunday, Harris identified "to not get out of D.C. more" as her "biggest failure" since taking office.</p>
<p>Harris made the remark to Margaret Brennan of <a>CBS News</a>, who spoke with Harris for this weekend’s edition of "Face the Nation."</p>

<p>The confirmation process has proved to be frustrating for new presidential administrations regardless of party. While gridlock isn’t new, the struggle to staff administrations is getting more difficult.</p>
<p>As a result, positions requiring Senate confirmation can go unfilled for several months even when the nominations are approved in committee with the support of senators from both parties.</p>

<p>While Democrats were intent on making progress on Biden's nominees, they also viewed it as too little and too late.</p>

<p>But <a>Sen. Roy Blunt</a>, <a>R-Mo.</a>, said some of the gridlock on nominations stems back four years when Democrats under Schumer's leadership tried to prevent many of President Donald Trump's nominees from being confirmed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>"Sen. Schumer doesn't have anything close to clean hands here," Blunt said.</p>
<p>Eight Republicans ended up voting with a majority of Democrats to confirm Emanuel. Three Democrats voted against his confirmation: Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusettsvand Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon.</p>

<h1>Fox News Voter Analysis: How Virginia voters decided between Youngkin, McAuliffe</h1>
<h2>Data from the Fox News Voter Analysis, a survey of more than 2,600 Virginia voters, sheds light on the key themes underlying the election</h2>
<p>Republican Glenn Youngkin bested Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor’s race, racking up strong margins among reliably Republican groups -- plus making inroads among key Democratic constituencies. </p>
<a>President Biden</a> won the state by 10 points a year ago, and outgoing Gov. Ralph Northam won by 9 points in 2017.
<p>McAuliffe won the 2013 governor’s race by 3 points and was attempting to pull off a rare feat this time around: Virginia has had just one governor <a>elected</a> to multiple terms in office since the 1860s. </p>
<p><a>FOX NEWS VOTER ANALYSIS ON VIRGINIA GOVERNOR'S RACE</a></p>
<p>Near-final data from the <a>Fox News Voter Analysis</a>, a survey of more than 2,600 Virginia voters, sheds light on the key themes underlying the election and the demographics of each candidate’s support. </p>
<div> <div><p> Virginia Republican Glenn Youngkin, left, stressed a campaign approach that differed from that of Democrat Terry McAulifee. </p></div></div>
<p>Overall, voters said the economy was the top issue facing the state, followed distantly by the <a>pandemic</a> and education. </p>
<p>McAuliffe won pandemic voters by a wide margin, but Youngkin carried the day by winning economy voters by 27 points and education voters by an even wider margin. </p>
<p>Youngkin promised to ban the teaching of critical race theory and empower parents in decisions about education. </p>
<p>One-quarter of voters cited the debate over teaching critical race theory as the single most important factor to their vote for governor, and they backed the Republican by more than 2-to-1.</p>
<p>Parents who said CRT was the single most important factor to their vote went for the Republican by a narrower 25-point margin. </p>
<p>The debate over controlling the spread of COVID-19 in schools was much more favorable ground for McAuliffe. He advocated for a statewide mask mandate for students, while Youngkin held that decisions on masking should be left to parents. </p>
<p>Six-in-10 sided with McAuliffe on the issue. </p>
<p>More than one-quarter said handling coronavirus in schools was the most important factor to their vote, and they broke heavily for McAuliffe. </p>
<p>Parents for whom COVID was the most important factor went for the Democrat by 24 points. </p>
<p>Overall, Youngkin won parents by a very narrow margin. </p>
<p>A similar number cited negotiations in Washington over Biden’s agenda as central to their vote -- and these voters went for Youngkin by 18 points. </p>
<p>Overall, voters disapproved of Biden’s performance as president. </p>
<p>A narrow majority had a positive evaluation of his handling of the pandemic, while less than half approved of the job he has done on immigration and the economy.</p>
<p>All told, two-thirds believed the country was heading in the wrong direction. This frustration benefitted Youngkin, as three-quarters of these voters backed the Republican. </p>
<p>The Republican won almost all of those with a favorable view of the former president. </p>
<p>All told, slightly more voters felt Youngkin was too supportive of Trump than felt he struck the right chord in his support. </p>
<div> <div><p> Glenn Youngkin won nearly all Virginia voters who hold a favorable view of former President Trump. (Getty Images)</p></div></div>
<p>More voters held positive views of Youngkin than McAuliffe. Less than half had favorable opinions of Northam, the Democratic Party, and the Republican Party. </p>
<p>As he did in his 2013 campaign -- and as Democrats in Virginia have done for years -- McAuliffe relied heavily on the support of Black voters. Women, the college-educated, and voters under 30 were also key parts of his coalition. </p>
<p>Still, each of these groups shifted noticeably rightward compared to 2017. Four years ago, Northam won 92% of the Black vote, 59% of women, 58% of college-educated voters, and 64% of young voters. </p>
<p>Seniors also swung, backing Youngkin by double digits after voting for Republican Ed Gillespie by 1 point in 2017. </p>
<p>Youngkin racked up substantial margins among men, Whites without a college degree, rural voters, and White evangelicals. </p>
<p>McAuliffe won urban voters by a wide margin, while rural voters went for the Republican. The two candidates essentially battled to a draw in the suburbs, with McAuliffe winning suburban women by 8 points and suburban men going for Youngkin by 7.</p>
<p>The relatively small group of independents went narrowly for McAuliffe. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a majority gave positive evaluations of Virginia's economy, though just 16% said they were getting ahead financially. Slightly more (19%) said they were falling behind.</p>
<p>Six-in-10 favored a vaccine mandate for health care workers (64%) and teachers (63%). McAuliffe came out in favor of vaccine requirements, while Youngkin held that vaccination should be a personal decision. </p>
<p>While 7-in-10 viewed racism in U.S. society (71%) and racism in policing (69%) as a serious problem, that failed to translate into a widespread call for schools to increase their focus on racism.</p>
<p>Both campaigns focused a good deal of attention on the integrity of the election -- whether votes would be counted accurately and whether election laws would prevent fraud or make it difficult for eligible voters to vote. </p>
<p>Overall, far more were confident that eligible voters would be allowed to vote (94%) than that those not eligible would be prevented from doing so (67%). </p>

<h1>Fox News Poll: Biden’s ratings down, as voters say he’s focused on wrong things</h1>
<h2>Biden receives his lowest marks as president on a Fox News survey</h2>
<div><div>NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! </div></div>
<p>There’s no way to spin the latest Fox News poll numbers — they are that bad for President Joe Biden. Here are the main takeaways on the <a>economy</a> and the Biden administration from the survey released Thursday. </p>
<p>— Higher grocery and <a>gas prices</a> are causing widespread pain, and views on the economy are ugly as a result.</p>
<p>— Only one-quarter of voters think Biden’s $1 trillion-plus social spending plan will help their family, while a majority believes they — not wealthy Americans — will pay for it.</p>
<p>— Many think Biden’s age is interfering with his job (he turns 79 on Saturday). That includes half of seniors and more than one-quarter of Democrats.</p>
<p>— Amid concern over China’s power, a majority says Biden isn’t tough enough on America’s Asian rival.</p>
<p>— Over half disapprove of the job <a>Vice President Kamala Harris</a> is doing and don’t think she is qualified to be president.</p>
<p>— Biden’s job ratings are down — both overall and on the issues — and voters think his administration is prioritizing the wrong issues. </p>
<p>Here are the numbers behind those findings:</p>
<p>Biden currently receives his lowest marks on a Fox News survey: approval stands at 44 percent, while 54 percent disapprove. It was 46-53 percent last month. His best, 56-43 percent, came in June. </p>
<a>coronavirus</a>, 15 points on the economy, and 7 points on
<a>immigration</a>. Currently, 36 percent approve on the economy and 31 percent approve on immigration. On Biden’s best issue, the pandemic, 48 percent approve.
<p><a>KAMALA HARRIS CHUCKLES WHEN ASKED IF SHE FEELS MISUSED BY BIDEN ADMINISTRATION: 'NO, I DON'T'</a></p>
<a>Democrats</a> to date for his overall performance (82 percent), as well as on the economy (67 percent), immigration (57 percent), and coronavirus (84 percent).
<a>Afghanistan</a> (27-63 percent) and
<a>China</a> (28-55 percent). Overall, 7 in 10 are extremely or very concerned about both China’s military and economic power and 6 in 10 think Biden hasn’t been tough enough on the country.
<p>Meanwhile, 46 percent think Biden’s issue positions are too liberal and 53 percent believe his age is affecting his work.</p>
<p>Yet the increased desire for government involvement is not helping Biden, as 54 percent think his administration is focused on the wrong things.</p>
<p><a><u>JESSE WATTERS: IF BIDEN DIDN'T HAVE MAINSTREAM MEDIA PROPPING HIM UP, HIS ABYSMAL POLL NUMBERS WOULD BE WORSE</u></a></p>
<p>Voters are focused on the economy, including higher prices and <a>supply chain concerns</a>. </p>
<p>Three-quarters say supply chain issues have affected them personally through sticker shock, empty shelves, or delayed deliveries. </p>
<p>Higher prices at the grocery store are causing financial hardship for 73 percent. For 33 percent, they are a "serious" hardship, up from 28 percent in August.</p>
<p>Some 12 percent are happy about high gas prices because it will spur use of alternative energy. A larger 33 percent think the higher cost makes Biden happy for the same reason. </p>
<p>Only 23 percent rate the economy positively (4 percent excellent and 19 percent good). That’s down from 33 percent at the end of former <a>President Trump</a>’s term (December 2020) -- and the lowest since May 2020. </p>
<p><a><u>GERALDO RIVERA: THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SEEMS TO GET EVERYTHING DONE 'A-- BACKWARD'</u></a></p>
<p>Most voters, 76 percent, say the economy is in fair (33 percent) or poor shape (43 percent). </p>
<p>That’s about how folks felt soon after the pandemic started: 26 percent positive vs. 73 percent negative (April 2020).</p>
<p>The economy tops the list for Republicans, followed by inflation and border security. Among Democrats, coronavirus is first, followed by the economy and climate change.</p>
<p>The White House, meanwhile, is focused on passing Biden’s social spending plan for programs ranging from childcare to <a>climate change</a>. Views split on the plan: 44 percent favor vs. 46 percent oppose. </p>
<p>"There is considerable skepticism about the president’s plan," says Shaw. "White House advisors who think that passing it will boost Biden’s approval may be underrating the extent to which attitudes on it are already highly polarized."</p>
<p>The president insists his plan won’t raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year. Only 32 percent believe that. A 59 percent majority says "people like me" will pay, including 32 percent of Democrats. </p>
<p>Views are also split on the $1.2 trillion bipartisan <a>infrastructure bill</a> Biden signed into law Monday. While 35 percent think the package will help the economy, 34 percent say it will hurt. Another 20 percent say it won’t make a difference.</p>
<p>The national registered voter survey was conducted Sunday through Wednesday. </p>
<p>Harris’ job rating is underwater by 13 points (40 approve vs. 53 disapprove). Six months ago, it was net +3 (50-47 percent). Since June, her approval is down among Democrats (-12 points), independents (-10), and Republicans (-9). </p>

<h1>Mom modifies daughter's 'Elf on the Shelf' doll with functional wheelchair</h1>
<h2>Samantha Lackey crafted elf-sized medical devices, so her daughter Stella can feel included in the tradition</h2>
<h4><a>Behind the Elf on the Shelf phenomenon</a></h4>
<p>Chanda Bell and her mother Carol Aebersold explain how their family's Christmas tradition became a pop culture phenomenon with more than 13 million elf scouts helping Santa around the world.</p>
<p>A <a>mother</a> has found a way to make <a>Elf on the Shelf</a> more inclusive for her <a>daughter</a>.</p>
<p>Samantha Lackey’s 2-year-old daughter Stella received the popular elf doll from Santa in November. Lackey went on to modify the doll – whose name is Bean – so Stella would feel represented.</p>
<p><a>'ELF ON THE SHELF': HOW THE BRAND EVOLVED OVER 16 YEARS</a></p>
<p>Stella is diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy and requires a wheelchair to get around, so Lackey fashioned an elf-sized wheelchair that can be used with the <a>toy</a>.</p>
<p>"Elf on a shelf but make it INCLUSIVE," Lackey captioned her DIY video.</p>

<p>Lackey’s modifications are fully functional and allow Stella to push Bean down ramps and other surfaces around their Phoenix home.</p>
<p>Stella and Bean’s adventures are being documented on the Lackey family’s "Strong Like Stella" Instagram page, where Lackey and her husband Jeremy actively post to spread awareness about spinal muscular atrophy, rare diseases and disability.</p>
<p>According to Lackey, spinal muscular atrophy is a "genetic disease that causes muscle wasting."</p>

<h1>U.S. Navy warship remains in port after COVID-19 breaks out among '100% immunized' crew</h1>
<h2>The U.S. Navy claimed 'the vaccine continues to demonstrate effectiveness against serious illness'</h2>
<p>A U.S. <a>Navy</a> warship held off on deploying to South America last week after an outbreak of COVID-19 among its vaccinated crew.</p>
<p>USS Milwaukee, a littoral combat ship, remained in port at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay following positive tests from some of its sailors, some of whom exhibited mild symptoms, according to a Friday <a>announcement</a> from the U.S. Navy.</p>
<p>"The crew is 100% immunized and all COVID-19 positive sailors are isolated on board and away from other crew members," the release explained. "A portion of those infected have exhibited mild symptoms."</p>

<p>The press release also said, "The vaccine continues to demonstrate effectiveness against serious illness."</p>
<p>The Navy had set Nov. 28 as the <a>deadline</a> for all service members to receive vaccination against COVID-19. More than 98% of all active<a>-</a>duty sailors have been fully vaccinated, according to the most recent data.</p>
<p>The Navy did not say how many sailors had tested positive from the ship's crew, which contains a little more than 100 people, but said the ship "is following an aggressive mitigation strategy in accordance with Navy and CDC guidelines."</p>
<p>The USS Milwaukee began its deployment from Mayport, Fla., on Dec. 14 and was scheduled to head to the U.S. Southern Command region until the outbreak.</p>

<p>Marcinko deployed to Vietnam in January 1967 in 2nd Platoon, SEAL Team 2. He participated in the May 18, 1967, assault on Ilo Ilo Hon, which the Navy has described as its most successful SEAL operation during the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>Marcinko commanded SEAL Team 6 from August 1980 to July 1983. He was also the author of several books, including his 1993 New York Times bestselling autobiography, "Rogue Warrior." The book would lead to several spinoff novels.</p>
<p>"The SEALs who knew Dick Marcinko will remember him as imaginative and bold, a warrior at heart," retired Navy SEAL Adm. Eric Olson told <a>Navy Times</a>. "He was a spirited rogue for sure, but we are better off for his unconventional service."</p>
