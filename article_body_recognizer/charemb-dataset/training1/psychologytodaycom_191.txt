<p>To live content with small means; to see elegance rather than luxury and refinement rather than fashion. To be worthy, not respectable, and wealthy not rich.</p>
<p>To study hard, think quietly, talk gently and act frankly. To listen to the stars and birds, to babes and sages with open heart.</p>
<p>Whatever new that needs to be born in our ways of being on the planet—commercial/relational, religious/<a>spiritual</a>, governmental/ecological—will be more readily birthed if we pay <a>attention</a> to these ideas.</p>
<h3>Humility Over Ideology</h3>
<a>wisdom</a>, and an innocent newness.
<p>School boards, do your best to listen. Don’t be afraid of the other side—what are they trying to protect that is not so unlike what you want to protect? Family members, where can you reach out, talk gently, listen deeply, and reconnect.</p>
<p>I wrote this sentence in 2011, at another time when I cited Channing: "Our Congressmen and women today are locked in ideological warfare that resembles WWI trench warfare: endless attacks and no movement."</p>
<p>We're 11 years on now. Legislators, get us out of this dead-end lock jam. Please listen to a former chaplain of the Congress–what do the people, not your party, need?</p>
<p>But we won’t wait for legislators—we don't need to. We start at our own idiosyncratic close-in/within places: our attitudes, thinking patterns, our hearts. Channing speaks to us in our work and personal and civic lives. </p>
<p>A good place to start? With Channing one more time: Let’s be worthy more than respectable.</p>

<h2> Reserach tells us why some people are hesitant and what we can do about it. </h2>
<li>Vaccine hesitancy is a serious public health challenge.</li>
<li>There are many reasons people are hesitant to get vaccinated, including mistrust of the government and worries about side effects.</li>
<li>There are steps public health officials, health care providers and everyday citizens can take to encourage people to get vaccinated.</li>

<a>COVID-19</a>, with 34 percent having received a booster dose. That leaves more than 100 million Americans who have made the choice to skip the COVID-19 vaccine despite clear evidence that the jabs help prevent serious illness.
<p>Vaccine hesitancy is a serious public health challenge—one that researchers are learning more about. What’s going on here?</p>
<p>In many studies, those hesitant reported worries that the vaccines are not safe or effective. They also raised concerns that the vaccines were developed too quickly.</p>
<p>While these data are interesting, the real question is, what can we do to encourage more people to get vaccinated?</p>
<p>It turns out, there is also a growing body of literature on the best ways to encourage vaccination.</p>
<a>empathy</a> and without casting judgment on the person.
<a>goals</a>, such as feeling safer when visiting at-risk loved ones or looking forward to traveling.
<p>Finally, if the person does indicate interest in getting vaccinated, offer to help them find local appointments or assist with transportation.</p>

<h1> COVID and the Great Baseline Lowering </h1>
<h2> What lessons do quarantine, illness, and forced baseline lowering have for us? </h2>
<li>Economically, physically, and socially, COVID has caused us to slow down, lower our baseline expectations, and do less. </li>
<li>Baseline lowering is never a comfortable process, though it is a healthy one. </li>
<li>COVID forced me to consider how I was living my life and what deals I was making with the universe. </li>
<p>Life occurs in cycles. Growth periods and retraction periods. COVID has been a major retraction period in so many ways.</p>
<p>Economically, physically, and socially, COVID has caused us to slow down, lower our baseline expectations, and do less.</p>
<p>Baseline lowering is never a comfortable process, though it is a healthy one.</p>
<p>The first holiday season that we were expecting to be back to normal at long last was pulled away by a new surge, one that is not prevented by vaccination or prior infection and one which is more contagious than any strain we have seen.</p>
<p>I of course sank into a depressive state for the first week of the virus. It was awful, and I’m grateful for it.</p>
<p>There was value to this time of <a>fear</a>, illness, and <a>gratitude</a>.</p>
<p>COVID forced me to consider how I was living my life, what deals I was making with the universe, and consider whether the universe was actually consenting to these deals.</p>
<p>My personal deal was, “I will be disciplined, and this discipline will immunize me to disaster.”</p>
<p>I wondered what other deals with the universe people were making, and how COVID forced us to examine these.</p>
<p>One common deal a lot of us had to confront during COVID was, “If I work x amount or make x amount of money I can be successful, live a good life, make my loved ones proud, and find <a>happiness</a>.“</p>
<p>For many of us, COVID has taught us that these deals we make may be one-sided. We may be working towards a payoff that will never come.</p>
<p>Many of us considered what the payoff to sacrificing work-life balance was once we were forced to slow down.</p>
<p>COVID has taught us that life is happening right here, right now. The only time that is guaranteed is the time we’ve already spent and this moment right now.</p>
<p>So, as we reflect on 2021, and 2020, what do we want for 2022?</p>
<p>How can we live our best lives if quarantine is back for a bit? What lessons do quarantine, illness, and forced baseline lowering have for us?</p>
<p>What deals have you been making, and what do you want for 2022 if the world doesn’t look like you had hoped it would a month or two ago? </p>

<h1> Understanding COVID-19: A Primer </h1>
<h2> Pathologist Waldemar Schmidt answers basic biology questions. </h2>
<p>As a psychologist, I am not well-versed in the technical language of viruses. As such, I took some time to ask my friend, Dr. Waldemar Schmidt, who is an MD/Ph.D. pathologist some questions about the virus.</p>
<p>1. What is the size of the coronavirus?</p>
<p>2. What, exactly, is a virus, and why do we call this a <a>corona virus</a>?</p>
<a>DNA</a> or RNA surrounded by a protein coat, that requires a living host cell to replicate, and often causes disease in the host organism" (see
<a>enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA viruses</a>.” These viruses are crowned by a collection of protruding molecules, which appear similar to the solar corona. To place viruses on the
<p>3. What is the difference between corona virus, nCoV-2, and COVID-19?</p>
<p>The disease it causes is called COVID-19, the first cases of which were identified in 2019 – hence CoronaVirusInfectiousDisease-19. The primary source of nCoV-2 is not firmly established but evidence favors a zoonotic origin.</p>
<p>4. What exactly is the COVID—19 illness that people contract?</p>
<a>essentially identical with those of a cold</a>, even in those who progress to more severe disease.
<a>heart failure, arrhythmias, renal failure, cytokine storm</a>, etc. At present, we do not know how or why this wide array of symptoms and variable clinical courses occurs.
<p>5. How is COVID-19 diagnosed?</p>
<a>everywhere on every continent and even on ships at sea</a>. Hopefully, our ability to diagnose who has the illness, who is spreading the illness, and who has developed possible or likely immunity will emerge in the months ahead.
<p>6. How is COVID-19 treated? </p>
<p>7. May we find relief through a vaccine — and when?</p>
<a>immunity is not lasting</a>, which is why you can get colds over and over.
<a>Immunity is long lasting for small pox</a>. We do not know what immunity will look like with COVID-19.
<p>8. What may be done until a treatment, cure, or vaccine is available?</p>
<a>resilience</a> and connection, and try to engage in
<a>decision-making</a> on the hoped-for path toward a brighter future.

<p>To create the function found in Figure 1, I simply went to a free online function creator (desmos.com) and put in the following equation: Y = X. This leads to a simple linear function. </p>
<p>Under some conditions, the relationship between two variables is not linear and is, rather, exponential in nature. </p>

<p>Figure 2 is a graphical representation of this simple exponential function of Y = X<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>Notice how it differs from the function in Figure 1. The main difference is this: The curve goes up much more quickly and steeply for the exponential function compared with the curve for the linear function. </p>
<p>Now let’s think about what this means when scientists say that the spread of coronavirus follows an exponential function. </p>
<p>A colloquial way of making this same point would be to say that this thing is spreading like wildfire (which tends to spread at an exponential rate).</p>
<p>If there’s ever been an event in my lifetime that has been universally humbling and that has put all people in the same boat, it’s the coronavirus. </p>

<h1> 6 Ways to Arm Your Immune System to Fight Coronavirus </h1>
<h2> Do these 6 things today to boost immunity and reduce the harm of illness. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pixabay</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>boost our immunity</a> so that if we do get exposed to the virus—or worse, we get sick—our body can effectively fight back.
<a>the immune system can get worn down by many things typical of a modern life</a>—for example,
<a>stress</a>, toxins, lack of exercise, and unhealthy eating. This prevents our bodies from effectively fighting off sickness.
<p>With coronavirus continuing to spread, it's more important than ever to support the immune system. We can do this by making a few key tweaks to our thoughts, actions, and habits.</p>
<p>Here are 6 essential ways to boost your immunity in preparation for coronavirus:</p>
<a>you're stressed out</a> your body produces stress
<a>hormones</a> which tax the immune system. So one of the most important ways to boost immunity is to reduce stress. To reduce stress, it's key to ensure you
<a>have decent work-life balance</a>, take breaks when you need them (both short "water-cooler" breaks and longer vacations), and to employ some calming or relaxing stress-reduction techniques, like
<a>practicing mindfulness</a>. And if you're already feeling really
<a>burned out</a>, taking adrenal support supplements like Ashwaganda can sometimes be helpful.
<h3>2. Sleep whenever you're tired</h3>
<a>sleeping is essential</a> to rebuilding a struggling immune system, we need to let ourselves sleep as much as we need.
<h3>3. Consume immunity-boosting vitamins</h3>
<h3>4. Reduce Inflammation</h3>
<h3>5. Exercise, but not too much</h3>
<a>too much exercise is stressful</a> on the body and can be tough on our immune system. So just keep the other tips in mind: Keep stress low, and if you're tired, then rest.
<h3>6. Stay away from toxins</h3>
<a>destroying the immune system</a>. Many other toxins and parasites seem to have
<a>negative effects</a> on immunity as well. So do a
<a>parasite cleanse</a> and minimize exposure to chlorinated drinking water, pesticides, aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., air fresheners), heavy metals, air pollution, and food additives.
<p>By taking these actions, we can help prevent ourselves and our loved ones from suffering significantly from the coronavirus.</p>

<h1> How to Break the Habit of Touching Your Face </h1>
<h2> Keep coronavirus at bay. </h2>

<a>therapy</a>, I want to share a few tricks of the trade for you and your children.
<p>Determine if your habits are conscious or <a>unconscious</a>.</p>
<p>But unconscious touching is much more insidious because you don’t realize you’re doing it. Common reasons are <a>stress</a>, <a>boredom</a>, or just plain habit. </p>
<li>Determine if your touching is unconscious or conscious. One great way is to keep a journal. Note every time you notice touching your face and the antecedents (triggers) that happen beforehand. </li>
<p>Once you’re aware of the face-touching, the question is what to do next.</p>
<p>You need to give it a competing response. In other words, trade a bad habit for a less risky one. </p>
<a>teen</a>), are you really going to carry around a toy? Probably not! The great news is — there is another option: Chakra beads look cool, so no one will notice.
<p>Another idea for the triggers for face touching is putting your hands in between your thighs if you cross your legs. This will “tie them down” and prevent you from touching your face. </p>
<p>There are other simple tips that will help prevent the spread of germs as well. </p>
<p>And speaking of fashion: </p>
<li>Love those fake eyelashes or extensions, but forget it. We are all under quarantine, so who cares if you have those long, lengthy lashes? They can make you itchy and stimulate more of the unconscious touching. </li>
<li>Do not remove the food from your teeth with your fingers. Seriously. Use your tongue. It is really not that hard with practice and a hand mirror. </li>
<li>Manicure your nails fastidiously. A lot of people bite their nails when their cuticles are hanging, or that nail edge is jagged, so make sure they look fabulous. When your nails look great, it is a visual reminder to keep your hands clean. </li>
<p>So, if you love your face, don’t touch it. And regardless of what you think about fashion, good hygiene never goes out of style!</p>

<a>my first post of this series</a>, I discussed how persuasive specific tactics might be. In this post, I will discuss who influences us.
<p>Who is most likely to be influential?</p>
<p>Not all messengers are created equal: Some people are more persuasive than others. Not surprisingly, research shows that the most persuasive people are likable, <a>trustworthy</a>, and <a>expert</a>.</p>
<a>scrutinize the expert's message for flaws</a>, and there is the risk of heightened resistance to the message, as I discussed in the
<a>first part</a> of this series.
<a>about half of Americans</a> report relatively low trust in doctors. Interestingly,
<a>skeptical audiences</a>. Hearing the information from a doctor they personally trust may have more sway than when it comes from an unknown doctor, even one that has more expertise than their own doctor.

<a>Fear</a> can be a motivator. When people are feeling
<a>anxious</a>, they tend to process information more carefully and pay more
<a>attention</a> to the messages they're hearing. So a message that
<a>evokes fear</a> makes the audience more open to persuasion. However, it's important that any attempt to increase fear is accompanied by clear direction about
<a>how to avoid the scary thing</a>. For example, one
<a>study</a> found that people were more persuaded by a fear-inducing article on
<a>climate change</a> when it contained information about solutions to the problem. Without that reassurance, people may panic and actually tune out the message when they think they

<a>people preferred a risk reduction from 5% to 0% </a>over a risk reduction from 55% to 50%, even though the total risk reduction in the two cases was identical.

<p>With a 30% probability you will have to move to Site A. </p>
<p>With a 5% probability you will have to move to Site B.</p>
<p>To reduce their risk of relocation, they were subsequently presented with the choice of two different strategies.</p>
<p>If you choose Strategy 1 (e.g. working very hard to impress the boss), you will reduce your risk of being sent to Site A by 25%. Consequently, your new risk of relocation to Site A will be 5%.</p>
<p>If you choose Strategy 2 (e.g. befriending the building manager of the new sites), you will reduce your risk of being sent to Site B by 5%. Consequently, your new risk of relocation to Site B will be 0.</p>
<p>For an overview of the two risk reduction strategies, take a look at the figure below.</p>

<p>In the wake of the coronavirus epidemic, supermarkets across the U.S., U.K., and Australia are selling out of toilet paper. Worse, videos have gone viral showing people fighting and becoming violent over toilet paper...</p>

<p>February 2004, riding in the back seat of an up-armored SUV on the “highway of death” from Baghdad airport to the Iraqi capital, I had a strange epiphany about the mortal danger I faced that morning.</p>
<p>But what I realized that morning was that my greatest peril didn’t come from an attack per se, but from the soldiers who accompanied me in the SUV.</p>
<p>But the situation wasn’t normal to me because I only went to Iraq a few weeks at a time every six months or so, and I was nervous as hell.</p>
<p>Ten minutes into the ride I spoke up. “Sorry, but I’m going to insist that you all stop talking and keep eyes out for contacts (threats) and unusual activity—like kids not playing soccer where they usually do.”</p>
<a>attention</a> to me, but their sullen looks and eye-rolls as they quieted down and turned their attention to our surroundings told me they thought I was being a killjoy, a pansy, a weenie.
<p>The normalcy bias, simply put, is people’s tendency to discount the risks of a pending or developing disaster because they interpret their current situation as a continuation of normal life.</p>
<a>coronavirus</a>, resisting a full lockdown out of a belief that the threat does not diverge enough from “normal” cold and flu season to warrant extreme measures.
<p>While we don’t yet know the full measure of the looming threat, experience in China, Italy, and Iran suggest our situation in America is far from normal.</p>
<a>leader</a> is panicking when they order a lockdown. And when the lockdown works, and the threat passes with minimal casualties, those same voters will say, “See, I told you it was no big deal. We destroyed our economy for no good reason.”
<p>In an election year, I <a>fear</a> that many politicians will respond to what they believe voters want and not to what voters need.</p>
<p>And what we all need is to accept that our current situation is far from normal, and that abnormal steps are needed.</p>
<p>Bottom line: If each of us doesn’t embrace the radical departure from normalcy that we find ourselves in—and vocally support a lockdown—most of our politicians surely won’t either.</p>

<h1> How to Concentrate When You're Working at Home </h1>
<h2> Tips for concentrating and focusing on work. </h2>

<p>Many of us are attempting to work from home, perhaps with kids jumping around. If you're struggling to concentrate, here are some tips:</p>
<p>1. Understand the evolved basis of why it's hard to concentrate when facing threat and uncertainty.</p>
<p>In evolutionary terms, your on-edge, hyper-alert feelings and your distracted cognitive state are a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>2. Recognize that you're missing the cues that help you concentrate.</p>
<p>3. Consider not attempting to work at 100 percent. Sixty percent might be more realistic.</p>
<p>Some of your cognitive and emotional resources right now are being utilized coping with the fact that we're all facing a pandemic. It's quite unrealistic to think that the equation will look like this:</p>
<p>You at 100%, minus whatever cognitive and emotional resources you're using coping with <a>coronavirus</a> = you're still at 100%.</p>
<p>Pick your own number for what you expect your functional capacity to be, but don’t pick 100%.</p>
<p>4. Try easing into work with some admin tasks rather than attempting your hardest work first.</p>
<p>5. Don't try to predict whether you'll have a productive work session.</p>
<a>productivity</a> that the state of mind I start my work in doesn't determine how my session of work goes. If I'm feeling
<p>For instance, if you write reports for your job and you've written hundreds of them, then once you get into the flow, your brain knows what order you typically write the different sections in, etc., and that conditioning will take over. </p>
<p>6. Give yourself a good recovery period after working.</p>
<a>20-minute restorative yoga routine</a> is one of my go-to's for when I need heavy-duty recovery. Restorative yoga is quite different from exercise-orientated yoga. It's basically supported
<a>lying</a> down. Sometimes my kid will do it with me. Sometimes she'll jump on me while I'm trying to do it!
<p>7. Don't watch or read news for hours and hours each day.</p>
<p>Since coronavirus is a fast-moving story, it's understandable that you might want to be watching or reading coverage of it for a couple of hours a day. However, watching and reading 3, 4, 5, or 7 hours a day, as some people are, is excessive. </p>
<p>Excessive news exposure will not help you concentrate on work.</p>
<p>8. Ignore messages that you should use your time at home to be hyper-productive.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's more useful to resist messages that the solution to any crisis (personal or communal) is to be hyperproductive. </p>

<a>research</a> indicates that stress is greater when employees are working in contexts with high demands and low control. In other words, jobs are especially
<a>stressful</a> when they are characterized by heavy workloads, time pressure, and intense
<a>concentration</a> combined with low levels of autonomy and
<a>decision-making</a> input. In fact, a recent
<a>study</a> found that jobs with low control and high demands are not just more stressful, but also may also shorten employees’ life expectancy.
<a>perspective</a> suggests that reactions to job stressors are often a matter of perception. In particular, when employees view stressful situations as a challenge, they tend to exhibit greater
<a>politics</a>, and other hassles.
