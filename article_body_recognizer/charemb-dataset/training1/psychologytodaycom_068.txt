<div> <h3> How can partners communicate about sexual concerns? </h3> </div>
<a>Sexual pain</a> is no exception; women should tell their partner how they feel during sex so that their partner can better understand their experience and support them in working with a professional to treat the condition.
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>The disorder can be characterized as being lifelong or acquired. The specifics of the disorder's development are not known, but factors relevant to its cause and treatment may include:</p>
<li>A partner's health status or challenges with sexual intercourse.</li>
<li>Relationship factors, such as differences in sexual desire or a lack of communication.</li>
<li>Individual vulnerability, such as a history of abuse or poor <a>body image</a>.</li>
<li>Cultural and religious attitudes toward <a>sexuality</a>.</li>
<li>Medical concerns such as infections or conditions that cause pain in the genito-pelvic region.</li>
<a>postpartum</a> period or after a history of vaginal infections.
<div> <h3> Why do women avoid discussing sexual pain? </h3> </div>
<a>women who experience pain during sex</a> do not tell their partner about their pain or seek professional help to alleviate it. The reasons for this include feelings of
<a>embarrassment</a> or shame, stigma around female pleasure, outdated cultural scripts about prioritizing male pleasure, and the fact that
<a>many clinicians don’t ask about sexual pain.</a>
<p>Treatment and outcome of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder depends on the cause of the pain. A clinician can help to determine a diagnosis and consult on appropriate treatment.</p>
<li>For painful intercourse after <a>pregnancy</a>, gentleness and patience should be exercised.</li>
<li>For painful intercourse in menopausal women, lubricants and <a>estrogen</a>-containing creams or medications may be used as prescribed.</li>
<li>For painful intercourse caused by endometriosis, medications can be obtained. Surgery may also be an option and might provide total relief.</li>
<li>For painful intercourse due to other complications, disease, or psychological factors, a healthcare provider can offer the best means of intervention tailored to the specific reason for the pain. </li>
<p>At a clinical visit, a patient's medical history will be obtained and a physical examination performed. Detailed medical history questions documenting difficulty with intercourse could include:</p>
<li>When did the pain first develop?</li>
<li>Is intercourse painful every time that it is attempted, or only some of the time?</li>
<li>Has it always been painful?</li>
<li>Is intercourse painful for your partner as well?</li>
<li>Is the pain in the labia, the vagina, or the entire pelvic area?</li>
<li>Does the pain occur during entry?</li>
<li>Have you experienced a significant <a>traumatic</a> event in your past, such as rape or child abuse?</li>
<li>Are you currently being treated for any illnesses, diseases, or disorders?</li>
<li>Are you currently taking any medications?</li>
<li>Has there recently been a significant emotional event in your life?</li>
<li>What steps have you taken to try to make intercourse less painful? How well have they worked?</li>
<li>What other symptoms are you experiencing?</li>
<p>Unless the problem is clearly caused by one person's physical issues, a couple should see the doctor together. If a physical problem is suspected, tests will be ordered.</p>

<a>depression</a>. Adults may display anxiety and depressive symptoms as well.
<a>Gender dysphoria</a> looks different in different age groups. According to the
<a>DSM-5</a>, health professionals deciding whether to diagnose gender dysphoria in children, adolescents, and adults should look for the presence of the following symptoms:
<li>An incongruence, present for six months or longer, between the child's experienced/expressed gender and the gender they were assigned at birth</li>
<li>A strong desire to be of the other gender (or another gender <a>identity</a>, such as <a>non-binary</a>) or an insistence that one is another gender</li>
<li>In boys (assigned gender), a strong preference for wearing or simulating female attire, and/or a resistance to wearing traditional masculine clothing</li>
<li>In girls (assigned gender), a strong preference for wearing typical masculine clothing, and/or a resistance to wearing traditional feminine clothing</li>
<li>A strong preference for cross-gender roles in make-believe or <a>fantasy</a> play</li>
<li>A strong preference for the toys, games, or activities stereotypically used by the other gender</li>
<li>A strong dislike of one's <a>sexual</a> anatomy</li>
<p>If at least six of the above symptoms are present, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria may be given if it includes:</p>
<ul><li>Clinically significant distress or impairment in major areas of functioning, such as social relationships, school, or home life</li> </ul>
<li>An incongruence between the individual's experienced/expressed gender and primary sex characteristics (sexual organs) and/or secondary sex characteristics (breasts, underarm hair), lasting for at least six months</li>
<li>A strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics</li>
<li>A strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender</li>
<li>A strong desire to be of the other gender or an alternative gender</li>
<li>A strong desire to be treated as the other gender or an alternative gender</li>
<li>A strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender or an alternative gender</li>
<p>If at least two of the above symptoms are present, a diagnosis of gender dysphoria may be given if it includes:</p>
<div> <h3> Is there debate around the diagnosis of gender dysphoria? </h3> </div>
<a>previous classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder.</a>

<p>The causes of gender dysphoria are currently unknown, but <a>genes</a>, <a>hormonal</a> influences in the womb, and environmental factors are all suspected to be involved. </p>
<p>Adult onset is typically in early to mid-adulthood. There are two common courses for the development of gender dysphoria:</p>
<li>The first, typically observed in late adolescence or adulthood, is a continuation of gender dysphoria that had an onset in <a>childhood</a> or early adolescence.</li>

<p>• Accept your child’s identity. (Do not label it as a passing phase.)</p>
<p>• Educate yourself about gender, sex, and the difference between the two.</p>
<p>• Don’t tell others that your child is trans. Your child should be the one to share that information.</p>
<p>• Don’t misgender your child or call them by their previous name.</p>
<p>• Therapy can be helpful for trans youth, but don’t automatically assume a child needs mental or medical treatment.</p>

<div> <div> <h1>Fetishistic Disorder </h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Fetishistic disorder is an intense sexual attraction to either inanimate objects or to body parts not traditionally viewed as sexual, coupled with clinically significant distress or impairment. </p>
<a>sexuality</a>. However, fetishistic arousal may become a problem when it interferes with normal sexual or social functioning, or when sexual arousal is impossible without the fetish object.
<p>Fetishistic disorder is a much more common occurrence in males than in females—in fact, the DSM-5 indicates that it appears almost exclusively in males. </p>
<p>Fetishism falls under the general category of paraphilic disorders, which refers to intense sexual attraction to any objects or people outside of genital stimulation with consenting adult partners. </p>
<p>The diagnostic criteria for fetishistic disorder, as catalogued in the <a>DSM-5</a>, includes:</p>
<li>For a period of at least six months, the person has recurrent, intense, sexually arousing fantasies, urges, or behaviors involving nonliving objects (such as female undergarments and shoes) or a highly specific focus on nongenital body part(s).</li>
<li>The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause significant distress or impair social, occupational, or personal functioning.</li>
<li>The fetish objects are not articles of clothing used in cross-dressing and are not designed for tactile genital stimulation, such as a vibrator.</li>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>Paraphilias such as fetishistic disorder typically have an onset during puberty, but fetishes can develop prior to <a>adolescence</a>. No cause for fetishistic disorder has been conclusively established. </p>
<a>childhood</a> experiences, in which an object was associated with a particularly powerful form of sexual arousal or gratification. Other learning theorists focus on later childhood and adolescence and the conditioning associated with
<a>masturbation</a> and puberty.
<a>humiliation</a>. By using fetishistic practices to exert control over an inanimate object, the theory goes, an individual may safeguard himself from or compensate for feelings of inadequacy.
<p>Fetishistic fantasies are common and in many cases harmless. According to the DSM definition, they should only be treated as a disorder when they cause distress or impair a person's ability to function normally in day-to-day life.</p>
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy can be effective, although research on the outcome of these therapies remains inconclusive. A class of drugs called antiandrogens can drastically lower
<a>testosterone</a> levels temporarily, and have been used in conjunction with other forms of treatment for fetishistic disorder. This medication lowers sex drive in males and thus can reduce the frequency of sexually arousing mental imagery.
<a>hormones</a> such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera) and cyproterone acetate help decrease the level of circulating testosterone, potentially reducing sex drive and
<a>aggression</a>—and, in the case of an individual with fetishistic disorder, potentially resulting in a reduction of the frequency of erections,
<a>sexual fantasies</a>, and initiation of sexual behaviors, including masturbation and intercourse. Hormones are typically used in tandem with behavioral and cognitive treatments.
<a>Antidepressants</a> such as fluoxetine (Prozac) may also decrease sex drive but have not been shown to effectively target sexual fantasies themselves.

<div> <div> <h1>Exhibitionism</h1> <p> <a> Reviewed by Psychology Today Staff </a> </p> </div> </div>
<p>Exhibitionistic disorder is a condition marked by the urge, fantasy, or act of exposing one’s genitals to non-consenting people, particularly strangers. </p>
<p>This condition is considered a paraphilic disorder, which refers to persistent and intense atypical <a>sexual</a> arousal patterns that are accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment. </p>
<p>The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown, but it is thought to affect approximately 2-4 percent of the male population. This condition is less common in females, although prevalence estimates are unknown.</p>
<p>A diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder can be made if the following criteria are met, according to the <a>DSM-5</a>.</p>
<li>Over a period of at least six months, a person has recurrent and intense sexually arousing <a>fantasies</a>, behaviors, or urges that involve exposing the genitals to an unsuspecting person.</li>
<li>The person has acted on these <a>sexual</a> urges with a non-consenting person, or the urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty in the workplace or in everyday social situations.</li>
<p>Exhibitionistic disorder is categorized into subtypes based on whether a person prefers to expose him or herself to prepubescent children, adults, or both.</p>
<a>alcohol abuse</a>, and an interest in pedophilia. Other factors that may be associated with exhibitionism include sexual and
<a>childhood</a> and sexual preoccupation in childhood.
<p>Some people who display exhibitionistic behavior engage in other paraphilias as well, and are consequently considered hypersexual,</p>
<a>flirting</a>. However, the behavior is not harmless, and some exhibitionists go on to commit sexual crimes such as rape.
<p>The onset of this condition typically occurs sometime in late <a>adolescence</a> or early adulthood. Similar to other sexual preferences, exhibitionistic sexual preferences and behavior may lessen as people get older. </p>
<p>Approximately one-third of sex crimes reported to the police involve incidences of exhibitionism.</p>
<a>Cognitive behavioral</a> therapy may help individuals identify the triggers that cause their urges and then manage these urges in healthier ways. Other psychotherapy approaches include relaxation training,
<a>empathy</a> training, coping skills training and cognitive restructuring (identifying and altering the thoughts that lead to exhibitionism).

<a>parenting</a> style can steer a vulnerable individual towards the OCPD spectrum, especially if the parent is highly controlling or protective, or highly punitive. In this scenario, the personality disorder develops as a coping mechanism to avoid
<a>punishment</a>. Because OCPD-like behavior has been documented in very young children, it is hard to assess the ways in which parenting and genetics might interact to stoke the disorder.
<a>psychotherapy</a> may be useful for treating obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. There is some evidence that cognitive therapy and
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy—related forms of therapy that seeks to address unhelpful thoughts and behaviors—can reduce the severity of symptoms.
<a>SSRIs</a> have also been investigated as potential treatments for OCPD.

<a>attention</a>-seeking, emotional overreaction, and seductive behavior. People with this condition tend to overdramatize situations, which may impair relationships and lead to
<a>depression</a>. Yet they are highly suggestible, easily susceptible to the influence of others.
<a>Personality disorders</a> denote rigid, inflexible, and maladaptive patterns of thinking and behaving, leading to impairment in functioning and or significant internal distress. Most personality disorders have their onset in
<a>adolescence</a> or early adulthood, are stable over time, and lead to significant inner turmoil or impairment.
<p>People with histrionic personality disorder commandeer the role of "life of the party." Here are additional characteristics of this disorder:</p>
<li>Their interests and conversation will be self-focused.</li>
<li>They use their physical appearance to draw attention to themselves.</li>
<li>They tend to believe that relationships are more intimate than they actually are.</li>
<li>Their emotional expression may be shallow and rapidly shifting.</li>
<li>Their style of speech is excessively impressionistic and lacking in detail.</li>
<li>They may do well with jobs that value and require <a>imagination</a> and <a>creativity</a>, but will probably have difficulty with tasks that demand logical or analytical thinking.</li>
<p>Data from the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on <a>Alcohol</a> and Related Conditions estimate that the prevalence of histrionic personality disorder is 1.84 percent.</p>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<p>According to the <a>DSM-5</a>, for a diagnosis of histrionic personality disorder to be given, five or more of the following symptoms must be present:</p>
<li>Self-centeredness, feeling uncomfortable when not the center of attention</li>
<li>Constantly seeking reassurance or approval</li>
<li>Inappropriately seductive appearance or behavior</li>
<li>Rapidly shifting emotional states that appear shallow to others</li>
<li>Overly concerned with physical appearance, and using physical appearance to draw attention to self</li>
<li>Opinions are easily influenced by other people, but difficult to back up with details</li>
<li>Excessive dramatics with exaggerated displays of emotion</li>
<li>Tendency to believe that relationships are more intimate than they actually are</li>
<li>Is highly suggestible (easily influenced by others)</li>
<p>In addition, the symptoms must cause significant impairment or distress in an individual. </p>
<div> <h3> Do histrionic people lack empathy? </h3> </div>
<p>Individuals with histrionic personalities may seem unempathetic, but they really suffer from little self-awareness and low <a>emotional intelligence</a>. They may appear manipulative in situations when they are not the center of attention.</p>
<div> <h3> Are people with histrionic personalities at higher risk for suicide? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>People with a <a>cluster B</a> personality disorder may have a higher risk for <a>suicidal</a> thoughts. People with histrionic personalities and mood disorders like <a>depression</a> may have an even higher risk.</p> </div> </div>
<a>genetics</a> may both be involved. HPD occurs more frequently in women than in men, although some experts contend that it is simply more often diagnosed in women, because attention-seeking and
<a>sexual</a> forwardness are less socially acceptable for women than for men.
<div> <h3> Is histrionic personality disorder related to narcissism? </h3> </div>
<p>Because depression can be associated with failed romantic relationships, patients with histrionic personality disorder often seek treatment when they are experiencing symptoms of depression. </p>

<a>self-esteem</a> is a central component: Just as people with avoidant
<a>personality disorders</a> don’t like themselves, they assume others will reject them as well, almost to a paranoid extent.

<p>The onset of trichotillomania often coincides with the onset of puberty, and symptoms typically first appear between the ages of 10 to 13. However, symptoms may also manifest in infants, younger children, older teens, or adults.</p>
<p>According to the DSM-5, the primary symptoms of trichotillomania include: </p>
<li>an urge to pull hair from the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, pubic area, legs, or elsewhere on the body</li>
<li>repeated attempts to stop or decrease pulling</li>
<li>clinically significant distress or impairment due to the hair-pulling, which can interfere with social, academic, or occupational functioning</li>
<p>The distress associated with the disorder can be severe and debilitating and may lead someone with trich to:</p>
<li>Feel acute shame, anxiety, depression, or embarrassment related to their condition</li>
<li>Avoid developing close relationships</li>
<li>Refrain from attending social events, getting one’s hair cut, or engaging in other activities that could result in exposure</li>
<li>Practice secrecy to hide pulling behavior from others</li>
<li>Use scarves, wigs, alternative hairstyles, or makeup to cover up areas of the body with noticeable hair loss</li>
<p>In general, trichotillomania often co-occurs with other psychological problems, such as anxiety, OCD, or eating, mood, and personality disorders.</p>
