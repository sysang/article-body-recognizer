<a>hide the disorder</a>. For example, parents often don’t realize that their
<a>teenager</a> has bulimia. The child might hide food in their room to binge later, run the shower to cover the sound of vomiting, or lie when asked directly about their eating. Similarly, patients in
<a>therapy</a> often need to work through other issues and develop coping skills before they feel ready to discuss

<a>compulsive behavior</a> (the need for control, exactness, and order), impulsivity (associated with abrupt and, at times poor

<a>neuroticism</a> (more frequent and intense negative emotions). Bulimia involves body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem as well.

<p>The roots of borderline personality disorder still aren’t fully understood. As is the case for many mental health conditions, it seems to be caused by complex interactions between one’s biology and environment.</p>

<h2> Treatment and Support </h2>
<p>Historically borderline was thought to be nearly impossible to treat. But today experts recognize that the condition is treatable with commitment to therapy, greatly improving the lives of those with borderline.</p>
<p>The first-line treatment for BPD is dialectical behavior therapy, which teaches patients to tolerate emotional uncertainty and distress along with coping skills to regulate their emotions and build stable relationships.</p>
<p>In addition to therapy, medications may be prescribed to help address symptoms such as anxiety or depression.</p>

<a>openness</a>. It's natural to mirror; beginning as soon as infancy, a newborn moves its body to the rhythm of the voice he hears.
<a>unconscious</a> mind may pick up on the crossed arms or averted gaze. Luckily, with knowledge and a little practice, it is possible to exert some measure of control over your own body language and to become more skilled at reading others.
<div> <h3> How can I learn to read body language? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How can you tell if someone is attracted to you? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is mirroring? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is mirroring used in persuasion? </h3> </div>
<a>persuade or influence</a> a person, mirroring can be an effective way to build rapport. Salespeople who use this with prospective clients pay close
<a>attention</a> to them and they listen, observe, mimic with positive results.
<div> <h3> Is mirroring a sign of attraction? </h3> </div>
<p>People who are <a>attracted to one another</a> indeed copy each other’s movements and mannerisms. In fact, many animals mirror as well. That is why cats circle each other, and why chimpanzees stare at each other before intercourse.</p>
<div> <h3> What does a tilted head convey? </h3> </div>
<a>tilting the head</a> exposes the neck, and perhaps shows vulnerability. The person with a tilted head is perceived as more interested, attentive, caring, and having less of an agenda.
<div> <h3> How do your eyes express how you feel? </h3> </div>
<p><a>Eye blocking</a>, or covering your eyes, expresses emotions such as frustration and worry. And sometimes the eyelids shut to show determination, while sometimes the eyelids flutter to show that you have screwed up and feel embarrassed.</p>
<div> <h3> What does touching your neck mean? </h3> </div>
<a>stressed</a> out, touching or stroking the neck signals a
<a>pacifying behavior.</a> We all rub our necks at the back, the sides, and also under the chin. The fleshy area under the chin has nerve endings and stroking it lowers heart rate and calms us.
<div> <h3> What do different hand gestures mean? </h3> </div>
<a>rubbing the hands</a> conveys stress, steepling the fingers means that a person feels confident.
<div> <h3> What is conveyed with a light touch? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What does crossing your leg while standing mean? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do you convey that you feel neutral about something? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the right way to shake hands? </h3> </div>
<a> make someone feel comfortable</a>, not to assert dominance. It is important to be sensitive to cultural norms: if you receive a weak handshake, it may be that the person comes from a background in which a gentle handshake is the norm.
<div> <h3> What are some mistakes we make when reading body language? </h3> </div>
<a>aggression</a> or refusal to cooperate. In fact, crossed arms can signal many other things, including
<a>anxiety, self-restraint, and even interest,</a> if the person crossing their arms is mirroring someone who is doing the same.
<div> <h3> Do all non-verbal behaviors serve a purpose? </h3> </div>
<a> some behaviors are mysteries. </a>

<a>reserved behaviors</a>," as they are used only when a person experiences extreme stress. Facial expressions alone can signal this state, such as pursing or sucking in the lips, often seen when a person is upset or feels contrite.
