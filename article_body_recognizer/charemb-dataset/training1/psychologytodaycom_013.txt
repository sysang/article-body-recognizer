<h2> Understanding Sexual Abuse </h2>
<p>Sexual violence is a pervasive problem. The abuse can lead to shock, fear, sadness, and in some cases, an anxiety or depressive disorder. But therapy, coping skills, and social support can relieve the burden and help survivors heal.</p>

<a>depression</a>. Yet up to 90 percent of survivors may recover naturally with time, research suggests.
<a>Mental health professionals</a> are always available to help process this painful experience.
<div> <h3> Are people more likely to be sexually assaulted by a stranger or someone they know? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is the profile of a sexual abuser? </h3> </div>
<a>according to RAINN.</a> Some may have a mental health condition such as antisocial
<a>personality disorder</a> but the vast majority do not. There is no singular profile for people who commit sexual abuse.

<h2> Healing from Sexual Abuse </h2>
<p>Survivors of sexual violence may experience physical injuries due to the assault, as well as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. This can harm one’s health, career, and relationships.</p>
<p>Therapy can often effectively address the trauma of sexual abuse. Survivors learn how to identify and understand their emotions, process their memories, develop coping skills, apply stress-management strategies, and restore their confidence.</p>

<div> <h3> What therapies can help survivors recover from sexual abuse? </h3> </div>
<a>Art therapy may also be a valuable outlet</a> for individuals to process the trauma. If a dissociative disorder is present as a coping mechanism, it is important to treat the disorder so that its root cause can be addressed. 
<div> <h3> How are dissociative disorders treated? </h3> </div>
<a>Dissociative identity disorder</a> can emerge as a result of sexual abuse, especially in children. To treat this condition—the presence of more than one
<a>identity</a> that takes control at different times—
<a>psychotherapy</a> is the primary treatment. Nonverbal forms of therapy such as art, play, and
<a>hypnosis</a> may be particularly valuable as they provide outlets for expression when verbal expression is too difficult. Therapy helps process the abuse and eventually achieve a singular, unified identity.
<h2> Helping Survivors of Sexual Abuse </h2>
<div> <h3> What are the signs of sexual abuse? </h3> </div>
<p>If you’re concerned that a loved one is suffering sexual abuse, asking them directly can lead to relief, support, and treatment. The <a>signs that an adult may have been sexually assaulted</a> include:</p>
<p>• Anxiety about specific situations that didn’t previously prompt anxiety</p>
<p>• Avoiding specific people or places</p>
<p>• Persistent sadness or depression</p>
<p>• Disturbed sleep or nightmares</p>
<p>• Self-harming behavior</p>
<p>• <a>Suicidal</a> thoughts</p>
<p>• New sexually transmitted infections</p>
<div> <h3> What can I do to support a survivor of sexual abuse? </h3> </div>
<a>listen and believe your loved one.</a> Validate their emotions, ask questions, and avoid casting judgment. Help them explore options and resources, such as seeking medical
<a>attention</a>, reporting the
<a>crime</a>, calling an abuse hotline, or seeking therapy. Although you may have strong opinions, set those aside—the survivor should make every decision for themselves when they feel ready to do so.
<div> <h3> What prevents survivors from reporting sexual abuse? </h3> </div>
<a>denial</a>, manipulation, and confusion.
<a>difficult for survivors to come forward after an assault.</a>
<div> <h3> What are the signs of child sexual abuse? </h3> </div>
<p>The signs that a child may have been sexually assaulted include:</p>
<p>• Sexually transmitted infections</p>
<p>• Genital injuries including bruising or bleeding</p>
<p>• Inappropriate sexual behavior or sexual knowledge</p>
<p>• Regressing to past habits such as bed-wetting or thumb-sucking</p>
<p>• New fear of removing clothing to change or bathe</p>
<p>• New fear of being alone at night or having nightmares</p>
<p>• New discomfort or anxiety around certain adults</p>
<p>• Excessive worry or fear</p>
<p>• Extreme agitation or angry outbursts</p>
<p>• Withdrawal from family and friends</p>
<div> <h3> What should I do if I learn that a child has been sexually abused? </h3> </div>
<p>If parents or caretakers are concerned about sexual abuse, they should gently but directly ask. While some children may bring up abuse themselves, many do not.</p>
<p>If an incident is suspected, avoid putting the child in situations in which they might encounter the potential offender or be in an unsupervised situation with an adult, until the matter is resolved.</p>
<p>If an incident is confirmed, report it. Reaching out to a rape crisis center, <a>domestic violence</a> center, or sexual assault hotline can help. (The National Sexual Assault Hotline number is 800-656-4673.)</p>
<p>Once the abuse has been reported, discuss next steps for the child with a doctor and <a>mental health professional.</a></p>
<div> <h3> What are the mental health consequences of child sexual abuse? </h3> </div>
<a>child sexual abuse dissociate</a> to cope with chronic abuse, unconsciously disconnecting from reality to some degree. Dissociative disorders are more commonly found in victims of sexual abuse than among any other
<a>psychiatric</a> population. Children who are 9 years old or younger are especially prone to dissociative disorders under conditions of severe sexual, physical, or

<div> <h3> Why don’t people disclose child sexual abuse? </h3> </div>
<a>adult victims of child sexual abuse to stay silent.</a> Survivors could feel confused as to whether the events that occurred constitute abuse. They also may not remember the events clearly, due to the tendency for children to
<a>dissociate</a>, or because the perpetrator gave them drugs or

<p>Forgiveness is the release of resentment or anger. Forgiveness doesn’t mean reconciliation. One doesn't have to return to the same relationship or accept the same harmful behaviors from an offender.</p>
<a>trauma</a>. Forgiveness has been shown to elevate mood, enhance
<a>optimism</a>, and guard against anger,
<p>However, there are scenarios in which forgiveness is not the best course for a particular person. Sometimes a victim of <a>sexual abuse</a> becomes more empowered when they give themselves permission not to forgive.</p>
<h2> How to Forgive Someone Who Has Wronged You </h2>
<p>Forgiveness can be challenging, especially when the offending party offers either an insincere apology or nothing at all. However, it’s often the healthiest path forward. </p>
<div> <h3> How do I overcome resentment? </h3> </div>
<a>To release resentment,</a> reflect on why the person may have committed the offense, sit with the pain, and then try to forgive the other person, because forgiveness can instill a sense of strength that overpowers bitterness. 
<div> <h3> How do I forgive my partner for cheating on me? </h3> </div>
<a>completely transparent and honest</a> from that moment forward to rebuild trust in the relationship. This may involve exploring the reasons for the affair to address underlying problems and prevent
<a>infidelity</a> in the future.
<div> <h3> Are there any acts that are unforgivable? </h3> </div>
<a>people who have forgiven others</a> for horrendous crimes, such as shooting them or killing their child. If forgiveness ultimately instills peace or healing, there is no action too severe for forgiveness.
<div> <h3> Do I have to reconcile with the other person if I forgive them? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>No. Forgiveness and reconciliation are <a>distinct concepts.</a> Forgiveness is internal, and the process does not hinge on the offender <a>offering an apology</a> or reconciling afterward. </p> </div> </div>

<h2> How to Forgive Yourself </h2>
<p>Forgiving another person is one thing, but what happens when we commit the offense ourselves? It’s important to take responsibility for mistakes, but intense <a>guilt</a> and <a>shame</a> aren’t a productive outcome in the long run.</p>
<p>The process of self-forgiveness can be a painful challenge but deeply valuable. Key to this process is owning up to one’s mistakes, understanding why they occurred, and helping to rectify the situation.</p>
<div> <h3> How do I forgive myself for past mistakes? </h3> </div>
<a>forgive yourself </a>by focusing on the thought, saying it aloud, or writing it down. Apologize to the person you wronged and try to improve their life in a meaningful way.
<div> <h3> Why is self-forgiveness so difficult? </h3> </div>
<a>self-forgiveness especially challenging.</a>
<div> <h3> How can I stop ruminating and self-downing? </h3> </div>
<a>silence your inner critic.</a>
<h2> The Benefits of Forgiveness </h2>
<a>Therapy</a> have been linked to greater feelings of
<a>happiness</a>, hopefulness, and
<a>optimism</a>. The process of forgiveness can also protect against serious conditions such as
<a>stress</a> disorder. The act was also shown to benefit cardiac patients, by significantly lowering their blood pressure.
<div> <h3> I've been told to forgive "for my own good?" Why? </h3> </div>
<a>release stress hormones</a> like cortisol and adrenaline whenever the person comes to mind. A steady stream of those chemicals can lead to stress and anxiety as well as dampen
<a>creativity</a> and problem solving.
<div> <h3> What are the emotional benefits of forgiveness? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Can forgiveness help reduce depression? </h3> </div>
<a>cognitive behavioral</a> therapy,
<a>can help treat depression.</a>

<h1> How Religious Community Is Linked to Human Flourishing </h1>
<h2> An analysis explores how service attendance relates to health and well-being. </h2>
<li>An analysis of data from tens of thousands of people found that those who regularly attended religious services were, on average, less likely to become depressed, to smoke, or to drink heavily.</li>
<li>Regular service attendance was also related to a lower likelihood of dying during a study's follow-up period.</li>
<li>People who frequently attend services may benefit from higher life satisfaction, purpose in life, and other indicators of flourishing. </li>
<a>psychological distress</a>. There is also some evidence for an effect on a number of other health and well-being outcomes. However, as noted in both our earlier
<a>long-form</a> reviews of the religious service attendance literature, the existing longitudinal evidence for other outcomes is often limited to only a few studies per outcome (and sometimes just a single study!). We need more evidence.

<a>loneliness</a>; slightly larger effects on increasing positive affect and life satisfaction over time; and notably larger effects on social integration (even non-religious forms) and on purpose in life.
<a>prior work</a>, we, in contrast, found a fairly sizeable effect on survival from cancer and heart disease, even though there was more limited evidence for effects on the incidence of these diseases. It may be that in some cases, religion and

<a>Human Flourishing Program</a> at Harvard have published a thorough
<a>empirical investigation</a> of this question, exploring the role of volunteering in the subsequent health and well-being of adult volunteers. The results are striking.

<h1> Anxiety Doesn't Always Look the Same </h1>
<h2> Some experiences of anxiety can be easily overlooked. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Anxiety? </li> <li> <a>Find counselling to overcome anxiety</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<li>Symptoms of anxiety can manifest in different ways. The condition can be hard to identify, particularly in children and adolescents.</li>
<li>Anxiety may involve being excessively agreeable, canceling at the last minute, or struggling to communicate thoughts clearly.</li>
<li>Anxious people may be overly self-critical. Identifying and changing harmful self-talk can help address anxiety.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>this is anxiety too</div> <div>Source: by Andrea Piacquadio from Pexel</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>scent</a> or a thought, and sometimes, it can be triggered by seemingly nothing at all.
<h3>The Silent Side of Anxiety</h3>
<li>How others feel around them</li>
<li>If they have contributed to negative feelings in the social situation they’re in</li>
<li>If they can maintain a conversation well</li>
<li>If they are being judged</li>
<li>Their safety and the safety of others</li>
<li>What to do with their hands</li>
<li>How to position their body</li>
<li>When to speak and when to stop speaking</li>
<h3>What Anxiety Can Look Like</h3>
<p>Although anxiety doesn’t have a particular “look,” there are ways that anxious people present that can be very easily confused.</p>
<li>Speaking excessively in social situations in order to cover awkward silence</li>
<li><a>Laughing</a> at everyone’s jokes and comments</li>
<li>Not laughing at anyone’s jokes or comments</li>
<li>Being excessively agreeable</li>
<li>Saying “yes” to social plans then canceling last minute.</li>
<li><a>Stuttering</a> or stammering</li>
<li>Struggling to communicate thoughts clearly</li>
<li>Repeating a thought or phrase</li>
<li>Losing one’s train of thought</li>
<h3>How to Help Yourself or Someone Who Is Feeling Anxious</h3>
<li>Wear an anxiety spinner ring and fidget with it when anxious.</li>
<li>Ask, “Are you okay?”</li>
<li>Say, “Would you like to go somewhere quieter to take a break?”</li>
<li>When you’re feeling overstimulated or overwhelmed with the situation, go to a quieter space (e.g., bathroom) and take a break. Play a game on your phone.</li>
<li>If you’re asked a question and don’t know how to respond, say “I’m not sure. Let me get back to you on that.”</li>
<li> If you don’t want to participate, say “I’m going to pass, but next time.”</li>
<p>As an anxious person, I am not good at knowing when to stop, take a break, or cut myself some slack. We can be overly self-critical. For example, we would never use the phrases below with another person:</p>
<li>“I’m so stupid.”</li>
<li>I can’t do this.”</li>
<li>“They hate me.”</li>
<li>“I’m an idiot.”</li>
<li>“Why did I do that?”</li>
<li>“Why did I say that?”</li>
<li>“Nobody is going to want to talk to me again.”</li>
<li>“They’re never going to invite me again.”</li>
<li>“Nobody cares about me.” </li>
<li>“How can anybody like somebody like me?”</li>
<p>Take a break and speak kinder words to yourself. Use phrases such as:</p>
<ul><li>This is hard for me.</li> <li>Who can I talk to?</li> <li>What can I do right now to help myself?</li> <li>I’m not dumb or an idiot.</li> <li>I’m scared.</li> </ul>
