<h1> The true cost of demand for cheap clothes, to you and the environment </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Arulnathan John </a> <a> Cheryl Tan </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: These are items Singaporeans can get more cheaply now than 10 years ago.</p>
<p>In fact, clothing prices have fallen to their lowest in a decade, according to the Consumer Price Index for last year — thanks to an explosion of retailers, including Zalora and Pomelo, competing on online platforms since 2010.</p>
<p>With prices going from as low as S$3 to S$15 for trendy clothes, Singapore’s e-commerce revenue from apparel and footwear jumped more than eightfold between 2016 and last year, from S$52 million to S$442 million.</p>
<p>But fast fashion comes at a price: The fashion industry released 2.1 billion tonnes of carbon emissions in 2018, according to McKinsey — more than the airline and shipping industries combined (900 million and 1.1 billion tonnes respectively).</p>
<p>One factor in fast fashion’s prices is volume of production. Some “mega” e-commerce retailers can release between 500 and 1,000 items per category every week, said MDIS School of Fashion and Design lecturer Kae Hana.</p>
<p>A top can be designed, produced and marketed so quickly that e-commerce has made fashion go even faster, “and it’s now called ultra-fast fashion”.</p>
<p>In this business model, retailers first find a trending style and create designs in small batches to test demand. If sufficient demand arises, more of those successful designs are produced to capture sales.</p>
<p>This can be done in double-quick time because of vertical integration in the supply chain. “(These e-commerce players) own the production companies … the fabric dyers (and) the logistics companies,” she cited.</p>
<p>This process, from concept to sales, takes as fast as two weeks or less. And with consumers “across the world”, the more an item is produced, “the cheaper it gets”.</p>
<p>The fashion industry’s long supply chain, however, is a reason for its high carbon emissions, said Chu Wong, the country co-ordinator of Fashion Revolution Singapore.</p>
<p>“It starts with the agricultural and the petrochemical industries for the raw materials. It goes on into the manufacturing industry for the fibres to be turned into fabrics and eventually into clothing,” she said.</p>
<p>“It touches the packaging industry (and) logistics industry. Eventually, it gets to the retail industry and to us.”</p>
<p>The low prices also lead to overconsumption and overproduction, she said. “Cheap fashion tempts us as consumers to purchase more because of the accessibility, and so more is produced. And that’s what makes cheap fashion so dangerous.”</p>
<p>She added that synthetic fibres, such as acrylic and nylon, are often used “because they’re cheaper” than natural ones. But they “have a higher carbon footprint” — the extraction process “is very energy-intensive” as they are oil-based fibres.</p>
<p>ECO-FRIENDLY AND INEXPENSIVE?</p>
<p>The more sustainable options include fabrics such as recycled polyester and Tencel. The latter is derived from wood pulp, usually from the eucalyptus tree.</p>
<p>But shoppers can do more than look at the fabric to find out how sustainably produced an item of clothing is, advised Susannah Jaffer, the founder of online platform Zerrin, which curates options in sustainable fashion.</p>
<p>“Natural materials, like linen, Tencel (and) bamboo, are definitely more sustainable … because (they’re) biodegradable (at the) end-of-life,” she said.</p>
<blockquote> <p>But you need to go a little bit deeper … read labels, do research on brands. Also, look at how much information they’re sharing.</p> </blockquote>
<p>Sustainable clothing is not all that better for the environment either. For example, recycled polyester is made from recycled plastic and polyethylene terephthalate bottles but is not biodegradable, she cited.</p>
<p>“When it comes to organic cotton, it uses less pesticides when it’s produced. However, it still takes 2,700 litres of water to produce an organic cotton T-shirt … the same as it would a traditional cotton T-shirt,” she added.</p>
<p>“That’s more than we’d drink in two and a half years.”</p>
<p>Usually, sustainable clothes are more expensive owing to their production methods and are produced in fewer numbers than those made from more conventional fabrics.</p>
<p>And that higher cost is the main barrier stopping Singaporeans from buying sustainable clothes, according to a DBS “conscious fashion” survey in 2019.</p>
<p>Jaffer said many fast-fashion brands are able to produce cheaper clothes in their “sustainable capsule collections” because they still produce “over 90 per cent of their collections through the traditional fast-fashion model”.</p>
<p>“It’s not possible (to have sustainable fashion at cheap prices) because you have to think about the additional costs of production, for better quality materials,” she added. “That could cost (sustainable brands) 50 per cent, 60 per cent more.”</p>
<p>Despite the higher price tags, clothes made from sustainable materials are often more cost-effective in the long run.</p>

<p>Cheap clothes are suitable for short-term wear, after which many Singaporeans would donate or discard them.</p>
<p>According to a CNA report in 2018, however, only about 10 per cent of the clothes given to the Salvation Army, for example, are sold in its thrift shops, while the remaining 90 per cent are exported.</p>
<h3><a>WATCH: Recycling in Singapore: What will it take to bring the numbers up?</a></h3>
<p>Daro Tan, a manager at SNI Trading, which has been exporting second-hand textiles for more than 10 years, said many of the clothes it receives go mainly to countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and South Africa.</p>
<p>He said exporting used clothing for reuse is more suitable than recycling, as each piece of clothing may comprise many materials, making recycling “too time-consuming” and manpower-intensive.</p>
<p>Import restrictions in other countries, however, are making things more difficult for his company. These countries, he said, want to focus on their domestic clothing industries instead of depending on imports.</p>
<p>Since 2018, tighter import restrictions have led to a 40 per cent drop in Singapore’s second-hand clothing exports. In 2019, of the 168,000 tonnes of textile and leather waste generated here, only 4 per cent was recycled, i.e. exported.</p>
<p>The rest ended up being incinerated. “It’s really a huge waste,” said Tan.</p>
<p>So what can be done to solve the problem of buying and throwing away cheap clothing to the detriment of the environment?</p>

<h1> Under siege by climate, man-made problems, a sinking Ho Chi Minh City fights to survive </h1>
<div> <p>The city is facing extreme weather more frequently, its flood mitigation responses have not kept pace, and a proposed sea dyke has sparked debate. The programme Insight finds out why the solutions will not be easy.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Derrick A Paulo </a> <a> Ikhwan Rivai </a> </div> </div>
<p>HO CHI MINH CITY: Nguyen Van Cu is a construction engineer whose speciality is raising homes. That means he has been busy of late.</p>
<p>He recently put the finishing touches to a house he had lifted by more than two metres. A few years ago, he raised a 6,000-tonne church.</p>
<p>“When the pastor said the church would be raised by two metres, nobody in the parish believed him. They just didn’t think it would’ve been possible,” Cu recalls.</p>
<p>“The pastor said to me … ‘I had faith in you, but hearing what others in the parish said (worried) me.’”</p>
<p>Today, many people in Ho Chi Minh City want their houses raised — because not only does it flood every year during the May to November rainy season, but also the flooding is getting worse.</p>
<p>The city of nearly nine million residents is facing extreme weather conditions more frequently, but the infrastructure to mitigate flooding has not kept pace.</p>
<p>While the authorities have raised the roads, one consequence is everyone is racing to raise their property higher than the road level.</p>
<p>For fruit seller Tuan Hoang, who has a fruit juice stall along the roadside, frequent flooding has made it difficult to run his business.</p>
<p>“The water would rise here. On the road, the water would be higher than half the tyre … Where the street is lower, the water would (cover) a whole tyre,” he says.</p>
<p>“It’s hard for people to stop by and buy stuff.”</p>
<p>Population growth and rapid urbanisation have caused the city to sink as much as 80 millimetres a year during the past 20 years. But worse is to come with climate change and rising sea levels.</p>
<p>By 2050, parts of Vietnam’s biggest metropolis could slip underwater, according to a report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Extreme flood risk: New report outlines potentially disastrous scenario for Ho Chi Minh City</a></h3>
<p>And with some of the solutions offered by the authorities — like building a giant dyke — sparking a debate about the suitability and risks, the <a>programme Insight </a>explores whether one of Asia’s fastest-growing economic centres can be saved.</p>
<p>CHALLENGES ON MULTIPLE FRONTS</p>
<p>Sitting in a flat delta region, 40 to 45 per cent of Ho Chi Minh City is less than a metre above sea level. So that has made it increasingly vulnerable to heavy rainfall, storms and rising sea levels.</p>
<p>Many parts of the coastal city are already subject to regular tidal floods. But climate change is not the only cause of the city’s flood problems.</p>
<p>“The second cause is the disappearance of natural canals and green spaces that help with the city’s drainage,” says 24-year-old environmentalist Hai Long Vu Diep.</p>
<p>The city has grown relentlessly, adding 1.8 million residents between 2009 and 2019, not including migrants. But the density of its green space for trees is only about two square metres per person.</p>
<p>“It’s very low,” says Ngo Viet Nam Son, the president of NgoViet Architects and Planners. “In other (advanced) cities, that may be 10 times higher, even more.</p>
<p>“When the rain comes down … we need adequate green space to hold the water.”</p>
<p>The city, which covers more than 2,000 square kilometres, is developing so rapidly that it is also sinking, especially the chunks of built-up areas near the banks of the Saigon River, where the soil is soft.</p>
<p>The land subsidence can occur quite quickly when high-rises are built.</p>
<p>“They put a lot of pressure on the current infrastructure system,” observes Son. “When it rains heavily, you can see that the area that’s most flooded is the area that’s next to some new development.”</p>
<p>Another cause of subsidence is the over-extraction of groundwater, which would create underground cavities that may collapse, thereby causing the soil on top to sink.</p>
<p>The city’s rapid expansion has left the water supply system to play catch-up. So, while waiting for piped water, many residents and businesses have resorted to extracting groundwater.</p>
<p>“Thousands of (wells) — small ones, big ones, household or industrial-scale — have been built,” notes Ho Long Phi, vice managing director (operations and research) of urban consultancy enCity.</p>
<p>“At the highest level, we could observe more than a million cubic meters per day of total groundwater extraction during the past 20 years.”</p>
<p>WATCH: Why is Ho Chi Minh City sinking? (2:44)</p>
<p>The authorities have since put in place measures to slow down the extraction of groundwater and help prevent further subsidence.</p>
<p>Owing to the distribution of piped water “all over the city”, says Ky, the rate of groundwater extraction has been “significantly reduced” to around 300,000 cubic metres.</p>
<p>Piped water was made available to Nguyen Kim Thanh’s family just over a year ago, for example, after years of them relying on groundwater as their only source of water.</p>
<p>The housewife now uses the treated water to cook. But the family still pumps water from their well “to water plants and wash (their) scooters”.</p>
<p>The reduced groundwater extraction has been crucial, but the authorities still have their work cut out for them.</p>
<p>And it is not only Ho Chi Minh City that is sinking, but also the delta region of Southern Vietnam which it sits on, from the Saigon Delta to the Mekong Delta.</p>
<p>“The whole delta has been sinking faster than the sea-level rise,” says Nguyen Huu Thien, an independent consultant and ecological expert on the Mekong Delta. “At the hotspots, we’re sinking 10 times faster than the sea-level rise.</p>
<blockquote> <p>"So the water rises and inundates the cities along this stretch of land."</p> </blockquote>
<p>Like in Ho Chi Minh City, groundwater extraction has aggravated the subsidence. But there is also another reason.</p>
<p>“Because we extract sand. To build this building, to build roads, we need sand,” says Marc Goichot, the World Wildlife Fund's freshwater lead in the Asia-Pacific. “So the sand isn’t replenishing the delta.</p>
<p>“Even if we stop the extraction of water … the subsidence will continue. It’ll be slower, but it’ll continue. So the only way to address the subsidence is by ensuring that more sediment … is able to be deposited in the floodplains.”</p>
<p>Dang Nha Cong, a fifth-generation farmer in Southern Vietnam whose family’s farming tradition goes back more than 150 years, is now worried about the future of his agricultural land and its tropical fruits, even after building a barrier around it.</p>
<p>“Everyone here suffers from floods … Even the street gets flooded,” says the 75-year-old living near Can Tho city. “If it rises another 50 to 70 centimetres or if it rises a whole metre, I wouldn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>“If the farm’s flooded, all the trees will die.”</p>
<p>Extreme flooding would also cost Ho Chi Minh City dearly. Global consultancy McKinsey estimates the infrastructure damage a once-in-100-years flood could cause today at US$200 million (S$267 million) to US$300 million.</p>
<p>The estimated knock-on effects could be an additional US$100 million to US$400 million. Real estate damage alone may reach US$1.5 billion. In 2050, the economic impact could be five to 10 times higher.</p>
<p>The threat of rising sea levels is more real for Vietnam than most others, notes Tran Ba Hoang, the head of the Southern Institute of Water Resources Research.</p>
<p>It is among the five countries most likely to be affected by global warming in future, according to the World Bank, in addition to the report by the UN intergovernmental panel.</p>
<p>“Since it’s an assessment by an international body, I think it’s a dire warning to the government of Vietnam and local authorities in areas that would be flooded owing to rising sea levels,” says Hoang.</p>
<p>As of now, he notes, the average sea level increase — as measured in the port city of Vung Tau for the last 40 years — is 0.45 cm per year, which he described as “relatively high”.</p>
<p>To protect Ho Chi Minh City and the surrounding region, authorities have proposed building a sea wall — 23 km or longer — from Vung Tau to the coastal region of Go Cong, which could cost up to US$6.8 billion.</p>
<p>It would help to prevent the rising sea waters from entering the delta. Ky, an associate professor, calls it a “far-sighted proposal” and “meaningful” project.</p>
<p>Some observers, however, believe that dykes are a “short-term” measure that alleviates the problem of rising sea levels but does not address other key issues.</p>
<p>“If you address the symptoms with the dyke, you don’t solve the problem — you move the problem,” says Goichot.</p>
<p>“Dykes stop the water from going to the floodplain. And the water going to the floodplain brings the sediment and deposits. That’s the solution.”</p>
<p>The high cost involved has led some analysts to question the project’s financial viability, given that dykes are also expensive to maintain as seen in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>“Our economic status is not like theirs … and, truthfully, the cost would be very high,” says Pham Viet Thuan, the director of the Institute of Natural Resources and Environment Economics.</p>
<blockquote> <p>"Neither the tidal angle nor the geographical features of the tidal currents in our country are the same with theirs. That’s why we can’t use a dyke to resolve the flooding."</p> </blockquote>
<p>The risk to the ecosystem is another reason to not copy the Dutch approach to building dykes, cites Goichot.</p>
<p>“You block the movement of nutrients, which is food for living organisms. And you create barriers to … the place where they feed or the place where they go to spawn, then you affect their life cycle,” he says.</p>
<p>“(The Dutch) have one of the safest deltas on the planet because they can protect themselves from floods. But now they realise that they’ve lost fisheries and lost biodiversity. And that’s a very high cost. So now they’re removing dykes.”</p>
<p>The Mekong Delta already has “high dykes everywhere” to protect its agricultural land, points out Thien. But that does not resolve the problem of flooding.</p>
<p>“When the high tide comes in from the sea, pushing the river water back … the river can’t find enough space because all the other lands are blocked by the high dykes,” he says.</p>
<p>“Water has to find room somewhere. So it has to find room in the urban area, in the cities, where they’re still pretty open.”</p>
<p>MULTI-PRONGED SOLUTION NEEDED</p>
<p>Despite objections to the super-dyke plan on account of its environmental and economic impacts, the project looks set to go ahead.</p>
<p>If it is to improve Ho Chi Minh City’s defences, however, the project would not only be costly, but also take a long time to complete.</p>
<p>In South Korea, the 33-km Saemangeum sea dyke and land reclamation project has taken 30 years since construction began, cites Ky. The sea wall itself needed almost 20 years to construct.</p>
<p>Ho Chi Minh City has barely 30 years until the results of climate change are seen in 2050. With rising sea levels, land subsidence and infrastructural shortcomings, can anything else be done to save the economic heart of Vietnam?</p>
<p>Hoang the fruit seller, who has often watched in dismay as floodwaters rushed down the streets in his neighbourhood, has only one choice.</p>
<p>“I assess how high the water is, and I raise my stall. The higher the water, the higher the stall … When it overflows, well, we have to live with the floods,” he says.</p>
<p>“I try to do my business as usual. It’s not as if I can quit.”</p>
<p>WATCH: The full episode — Asia's sinking cities: Ho Chi Minh City (48:15)</p>
<p>But that can only be a small part of a multi-pronged solution overall. “First, the authorities must swiftly and effectively deal with groundwater extraction,” says Diep, who is starting his master’s in resource and environmental engineering.</p>
<p>“Second, we must develop more green spaces and reservoirs around Ho Chi Minh City. Finally, and very importantly, the city must improve its current drainage system.”</p>
<p>It is about living with nature and not “trying to control nature”, adds Goichot. “We need to understand those processes and build with them. It’s not only a good, catchy concept, it’s really what we need to do.</p>
<p>“It isn’t so easy to implement, but it’s probably the most cost-effective way to adapt to climate change.”</p>

<h1> Struggle and suffering in India as climate change bites, but what next after ‘brutal’ floods? </h1>
<div> <p>Even as India tries to get to grips with COVID-19, another calamity is staring its people in the face. The programme Insight asks whether the nation is able to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Derrick A Paulo </a> <a> Tamal Mukherjee </a> </div> </div>
<p>DELHI: It was around 8pm when Abdul Wahab saw that the flood water had reached his doorstep and was rising steadily.</p>
<p>By 1am, water started entering his house. That was when his children panicked and started crying. “I tried to calm them and told them not to worry as I was there,” said the 32-year-old.</p>
<p>Somehow he managed to move them to the roof of a neighbour’s house. But “the situation became dire” that night, with the rising waters also bringing the threat of snakes, scorpions and leeches.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t sleep … The whole night we were shivering in the cold wind and rain. Since we were on top of the roof, there was no way to stop water falling on the children,” he said. “We were in despair.”</p>
<p>They lost all the grain they had stored, their clothes and other belongings. Every house in their village in India’s Bihar state was flooded that night, he added.</p>
<p>Torrential monsoon rains this year in the world’s second most-populous nation have caused rivers to overflow their banks, submerging thousands of villages, killing more than 1,500 people across 13 states and displacing millions.</p>
<p>Normally, India’s monsoon season stretches from June to September. But climate change has disrupted the cycle. There are now long dry spells followed by scant rainfall and then intense rain within a few days.</p>
<p>“Even though (flooding) is a recurrent phenomenon in India, this year it’s been much worse,” said Centre for Disaster Risk and Safety director general Angeli Qwatra.</p>
<p>At least 275,000 houses have been fully or partially damaged. There have been floods even in Jaisalmer, a desert district in Rajasthan state that does not normally have much rainfall.</p>

<p>“The flood situation in India is absolutely brutal,” said Bharati Chaturvedi, the founder and director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group. “It’s extraordinary how the deluge has come and swept over all of India.”</p>
<p><a>In a recent episode</a>, the programme Insight asked: Can India chart a new course for a poor nation struggling to deal with this challenge?</p>
<p>WATCH: COVID-19 and climate change — India's poor in deep water (7:06)</p>
<p>From the state of Bihar in the plains to Assam in the Himalayas to the city of Mumbai on the west coast, the impact of climate change is evident.</p>
<p>“The nature of flooding that’s changing is happening because you’re seeing more extreme rainfall events. So you’re getting massive rain falling in short durations,” said Centre for Science and Environment director general Sunita Narain.</p>
<p>“That’s why you’re beginning to see newer areas coming under floods each year. And you’re beginning to see the extent of, therefore, the flooding also increasing.”</p>
<p>The amount of rain over the year has not changed in recent times, noted Ajay Mathur, the director general of The Energy and Resources Institute.</p>
<p>“But the number of days that it’s raining has dramatically declined. So when it rains, it pours, and we have floods. And then you have many days without rain, so we have droughts,” he said.</p>
<p>“Climate change is here, and we’re feeling its impacts on a daily basis.”</p>
<p>It is an added pressure on the water-carrying capacities of rivers and drainage systems. And many states are vulnerable, since major rivers flow through them.</p>
<p>More than 40 million hectares, or 12 per cent of the country’s geographical area, are prone to floods, according to the National Disaster Management Authority.</p>
<p>“India specifically faces huge losses due to floods,” noted Qwatra. “Ten per cent of losses due to floods globally happen in India … It’s the most economic loss-causing disaster, to the tune of more than 50 per cent.”</p>
<p>Apart from the economic costs of the vagaries of nature, a 2018 study conducted by the Population Council, a research-based organisation in Delhi, suggested that around 5,600 people die from extreme weather events in India every year.</p>
<p>But this could be an underestimation, since deaths from droughts are not included.</p>
<p>MISERY, FROM POTTER TO FARMER</p>
<p>What is certain and has not changed is that the poor and the marginalised suffer the most. Rina Mudoi, for example, is faced with extreme hardship following the floods in Assam’s Barpeta district this year.</p>
<p>She makes clay pots and plates to support her ailing husband and two daughters. Even in the best of times, eking a living from earthen pottery is difficult. But doing so amid heavy rain and floods is an impossible task.</p>
<p>When the floods came, reaching knee level on her veranda, the potter had to put bricks on a bed and place her utensils — those that had already been baked — on top.</p>
<p>“Those utensils survived,” said the 49-year-old. “Most of my utensils got damaged.”</p>
<p>Ruing that most of her casts also dissolved in the water, she added: “It takes a lot of effort to knead earth. Kneading one basket of earth can take one whole hour.”</p>
<p>Around 140 people have died in the floods in Assam, with more than 56,000 homes damaged. More than 265,000 hectares of cropland have also been submerged, destroying the means of livelihood of thousands of farmers.</p>
<p>Farmers like Khalilur Rahman, 55, usually know what to do when the rains begin, for example building higher platforms to save their crops. But this year, there was no warning as the waters of the Brahmaputra River engulfed his village.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t predict anything about the water. It increased and then it decreased. It rained so much this year. The sky clears and then it rains again,” he said. “The situation is very bad this time.”</p>
<p>He could not harvest rice in time, and his jute crop died. The floods, which came thrice, dealt a double blow amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns.</p>
<p>“We can’t sell what we have. I have livestock, but if I take them to the market … there are no customers. Who’ll buy my livestock?” he lamented. “That’s how my condition is. There’s no end to our suffering.”</p>
<p>He had hoped the government would alleviate their suffering by, for example, paying for their crop damage, but was left disappointed. “They gave us relief three times — some rice, some lentils, salt, et cetera,” he cited. “That’s all.”</p>
<p>The disruption to farmers is massive and complex. With floods on the increase, rivers are depositing more and more sand over their farms rather than fertile silt.</p>
<p>“So they've lost not only crops, but also fertility,” said Chaturvedi. “We’re looking at … an overall massive, massive entry of these people who are flood-affected back into poverty.”</p>
<p>A COASTAL CITY UNDER THREAT</p>
<p>It is not only villages, however, that are bearing the brunt of climate change and flooding. India’s financial capital, Mumbai, now faces severe flooding every year and recently recorded its heaviest spell of rain since 2005.</p>
<p>WATCH: India flooded by climate change — the full episode (47:38)</p>
<p>According to a study last year by United States-based organisation Climate Central, rising sea levels put large parts of Mumbai, home to 20 million people, at risk of being submerged by 2050.</p>
<p>“There’s absolutely no doubt that Mumbai is a victim of climate change. I wish it were only climate change,” said Bittu Sahgal, the founder of the Sanctuary Nature Foundation.</p>
<p>Unplanned and unchecked growth has led to the destruction of wetlands and mangroves, which once acted as barriers against nature’s extreme events.</p>
<p>“We’ve destroyed almost all our natural drainages,” noted Sahgal. “And the storm drains that used to allow water to exit … are choked with plastic garbage.”</p>
<p>The drainage system has not been modernised as the city has grown, said Chaturvedi, who also cited the felling of over 2,000 trees last year in Mumbai’s Aarey forest — for a metro project — as another example of the deforestation problem.</p>
<p>“So we’re talking of a combination of climate change and extraordinarily poor planning … that kind of makes these freak events much severer,” she added.</p>
<p>A more recent study, by McKinsey and Company, highlighted that almost three million people living within a kilometre of the city’s coastline are under “severe” threat of flooding, storm surges and rising sea levels.</p>
<p>“Mumbai is facing a situation where without rain, just at high tide, we’re beginning to see coastal flooding,” said Sahgal.</p>
<p>“I shudder to think what’ll happen if we have a sea surge and a cyclone at the same time … We’re making a swimming pool for ourselves, and we’re going to get to see much worse flooding in the coming years."</p>
<p>Experts believe that immediate steps are needed to protect Mumbai’s environment and restore its biodiversity, and that both the government and citizens should share the task.</p>
<p>“The citizens are equally to blame because we’re voting for people who are doing the wrong thing,” added Sahgal.</p>
<p>HOPING FOR MINDSET CHANGE, AND MORE</p>
<p>To reduce the risks, the country has taken steps to deal with the natural disasters it faces. For example, the government has built barrages and levees to control the flow of water.</p>
<p>Narain hopes to see a mindset change. “The entire approach till now has been to ... hold the river down. Because the river must not flow against my wishes. It’s a very masculine approach to river management,” she said.</p>
<p>“We should be finding ways of being able to let the river water provide the bounty that it can, without the destruction.”</p>
<p>The same is true for cities, agreed Mathur, a member of the Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change.</p>
<p>“Making cities such that they can take in the larger amount of water and slowly release it — the so-called sponge city — is an alternative that allows us to live with nature rather than fight nature,” he said.</p>
<p>As the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, India must also reduce emissions as part of the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global temperature rise this century to below two degrees Celsius and even limit it to 1.5˚C.</p>
<p>India aims to limit its carbon emissions to the same levels that trees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally.</p>
<p>Last year, in ramping up its alternative energy sector, the country installed 7.3 gigawatt of solar power, strengthening its position as the world’s third-largest solar market.</p>
<p>Chaturvedi, the environmentalist, has been optimistic about India’s climate targets, but said the challenge now is that “so many of our resources have gone just to fight COVID”.</p>
<p>The fight against floods, for example, is “even worse” this year because of the pandemic, cited Narain. Relief camps have been set up, but the scale of the humanitarian crisis is so huge that the federal and state governments are at their wits’ end.</p>
<p>“Governments today are completely overworked, overstretched (and) fatigued,” she said. “But the larger question that we have to ask is, do we have the right strategy that governments can employ so that next year the flooding isn’t so bad?”</p>
<p>Whether it is one calamity or the other, “one of the biggest lessons” is that “the world isn’t acting as one”, she added. “That’s why we’re losing the battle on COVID, and we’re certainly losing the battle on climate change.”</p>
<p>For flood victims Rahman in Assam or Wahab in Bihar, change is not coming quick enough to make a difference to their lives.</p>
<p>“If I had money, I could’ve bought land in a place that couldn’t be breached by floods. We don’t have that opportunity. I’ll have to die here,” said Rahman.</p>
<p>“We’ve lost our crops, our homes and our livestock. If the government had paid (us), it would’ve been a great help. But the government won’t.”</p>
<p>Wahab added: “When the child cries for food, we don’t have anything but the same flood water to give.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing for the last few years has made us helpless, and we fear worse conditions when my children grow up.”</p>
<p>As things stand, Sahgal believes climate change has become a reminder that “we won’t be remembered well by our children and their children”.</p>

<h1> Why do you feel bloated after all that rich food? How do you ease the discomfort? </h1>
<div> <p>If you’re planning to indulge yourself this festive month, read this. And take note: It’s not just overeating that leads to bloating – rushing to finish your work before going on leave won’t help, either.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Khoo Bee Khim </a> </div> </div>
<p>You know you’ve overeaten when you’re feeling as bloated as Harry Potter’s Aunt Marjorie Dursley – the one the teen wizard inflated out of anger over her rude remarks about his parents. </p>
<p>And like Balloon Aunt Marge, it is literally gas that is giving you that uncomfortable, stuffed-as-a-turkey feeling – something you’d want to avoid during the Christmas festivities later this month.</p>
<h3><a>READ: What makes farts smelly or noisy? And is it safe to hold these in?</a></h3>
<p>HOW MUCH FOOD IS TOO MUCH FOOD – FOR MEN AND WOMEN?</p>
<p>If you’re thinking men can, well, stomach more food than women, not really. “The stomach capacity of women appear to be similar to that of men,” said Dr Gwee.</p>
<p>Maximum capacity aside, bloat can also be determined by how sensitive your stomach is. “Some people feel bloated with a little food, but some will not feel bloated even with a lot of food,” said Dr Siah.</p>
<p>LACTOSE INTOLERANCE ADDS TO THE BLOAT</p>
<p>As much as 90 per cent of Singaporeans may have varying degrees of lactose intolerance. “This is a situation when we may feel bloated, nauseous, and could even experience abdominal pain, diarrhoea and flatulence,” said Dr Gwee.</p>
<p>Christmas goodies also fit the bill when it comes to rich and fatty food. And here’s how they can turn up the bloat factor: “Fat requires more time to digest than protein or carbohydrates, so it keeps the stomach full longer,” said Dr Siah.</p>
<p>“We also consume large amounts of carbonated beverages and sweets, which increase bloating,” he said. Added Dr Gwee: “Alcohol beverages such as beer, especially those with high wheat content, can cause bloating.”</p>
<p>RUSHING WORK BEFORE THE YEAR-END HOLIDAYS ALSO LEADS TO BLOAT</p>
<p>Those with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) are “especially vulnerable to the influence of anxiety and depression on their gastrointestinal tract,” said Dr Siah, who highlighted that one in five people in Singapore has IBS.</p>
<p>EAT SLOWER, DON’T WOLF DOWN YOUR FOOD</p>
<p>HOW TO FEEL BETTER FROM THE BLOAT</p>
<p>“Overeating is probably the most common cause of bloating during Christmas. Smaller portions should ease the pain,” said Dr Siah.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Heartburn? How to deal with acid reflux when you overeat this festive season</a></h3>
<p>Going for a walk might help, said Dr Gwee, as it "could promote stomach and intestinal movements that help the food to go down easier".</p>

<div> <div> <p> <a> CNA Insider </a> </p> <h5> 'People might think we might be playing God': Inside the Child Protective Service </h5> </div> </div>
<h1> 'People might think we might be playing God': Inside the Child Protective Service </h1>
<div> <p>These social workers face hostility from parents and backlash against their decisions — all to safeguard children who are abused or neglected. CNA gains unfiltered access to their real-life cases.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Derrick A Paulo </a> , <a> Tang Hui Huan </a> , <a> Anna Tolentino </a> <a> Sharifah Fadhilah Alshahab </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: It started with her parents always arguing at home. The father remembers her mother throwing things — even breaking a fan — once she lost her temper.</p>
<p>But the couple’s arguments got more heated than that.</p>
<p>“She’d carry my daughter to the window and threaten to throw my daughter down. I always ran over to hold her hands and say, ‘You can’t do that,’” said the man, who also recounted how she “wanted to stab me”.</p>
<p>Their daughter was taken away by the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s (MSF) Child Protective Service (CPS).</p>
<p>The four-year-old is now in foster care. Her parents had already finalised their divorce when child protection officer Hon An Chi took over the case last year. But the work has only just begun for the CPS.</p>
<p>The mother, a Vietnamese, has not given up hope of caring for her daughter again. That is a risk Hon is having to manage, mindful that “every decision I make may have a direct impact on the child’s life”.</p>
<p>“People often think that our job is to simply remove children and break up families,” said the officer.</p>
<p>“But the big part of our job is to also support the families so that they can keep the child safe, and at the same time we want to rebuild the relationships between parents and the child.”</p>
<p>That is a reason CPS cases “are quite complex”, underlining the delicate work of officers like her.</p>
<p>What people do not often see — hostility of parents, scrutiny of every unpopular decision and the emotional weight of witnessing neglect and abuse inflicted on minors — is now featured in the series Inside the Child Protective Service.</p>
<p>Because for the first time, and over four months, CNA followed this team of social workers whose job is to protect Singapore’s children. (<a>Watch the three-part series here.</a>)</p>
<p>Their work, in their words, is to talk to children when they may be unsafe at home to find out what has happened to them, and find ways to ensure that they do not need to feel confused or scared.</p>
<p>“Our core work is to ensure that children are not harmed. We want to ensure that every child grows up in a safe and loving environment,” said CPS director Jai Prakash Ramalingam.</p>
<p>“We have a heavy responsibility to be the voice for the children.”</p>
<p>That responsibility, governed by the Children and Young Persons Act, has increased over the years. The CPS investigates almost 100 cases a month, compared with the 343 cases it handled in all of 2013.</p>
<h3><a>READ: As child abuse reports rise, Singapore agencies shore up protection efforts</a></h3>
<p>A new officer like Hon, who joined last year, undergoes training for up to a year. When she was six months into the job, she was already working on about 40 to 50 cases.</p>
<p>And one of the first few cases assigned to her was the daughter in danger. Fortunately, the father has a good relationship with the girl, who can stay over at his home on Saturdays if the mother is not present.</p>
<p>The mother’s contact sessions with the girl, however, were at the MSF for two hours a week, and Hon had to be around to observe them.</p>
<p>“But I may not necessarily step in because we also want to see how the mother is able to handle the child,” she said.</p>
<p>In this case, the child displayed unwillingness to interact with the mother in the initial stages, but Hon was hopeful the relationship would improve “because the mother’s trying”.</p>
<p>While more time was needed, the thing about working to reunite children with their parents is that “time isn’t on our side”, said CPS deputy director Fayane Tan.</p>
<p>“As the children grow older, it’s more difficult for (them) to return home.”</p>
<p>So, for the mother not to delay her progress towards outings with her daughter outside the MSF, which means more time to spend together, what was needed was a “safe person” to help supervise their interactions.</p>
<p>A safe person is an adult placed to prevent children from being exposed to further harm. And the CPS must assess the person’s suitability to assist in the care of the child.</p>
<p>What happens, however, if the person has a criminal record — for rioting and drug abuse in his younger days and for helping to “bring some girls in from overseas” 10 years ago, which landed him in jail for three years?</p>
<p>That was a concern when the mother proposed her new husband as a safe person, although he professed that he was “a changed person”.</p>
<p>The CPS has the ability to restrict the stepfather’s access to the child. But after a team consultation, the decision was to facilitate access and observe their interactions first.</p>
<p>“Because the stepfather is already part of the mother's life. And if the child is to return to the mother’s care, he’ll also be a part of the child’s life,” said Hon.</p>
<p>For each case, there are “hard decisions” to make. “People might think that we might be playing God,” Tan acknowledged. And the first decision is whether to remove a child from the parents’ care.</p>
<p>This was a call that child protection officer Maisurah Afiah Amin had to make for a two-year-old boy after the parents had a domestic altercation in front of his pre-school.</p>
<p>He was removed directly from the school, which provoked “a lot of anger” from the parents and paternal grandparents, acknowledged the officer. The father was so angry, in fact, that he caused a commotion at the CPS office.</p>
<p>But it was not the first time the boy had been exposed to family violence.</p>
<p>When the case was first referred to the CPS, its officers found that there was “chronic spousal violence”, especially during the wife’s second pregnancy, related Maisurah. So the second child, a one-year-old girl, was removed at birth.</p>
<p>With yet another incident, the brother joined his sister in the foster care system. “These were very real worries about the child’s safety that as a child protection officer, I couldn’t ignore,” said Maisurah.</p>
<blockquote> <p>We were especially concerned because not only was violence occurring very frequently, but the mother of the children was reported to have suffered a lot of injuries as well.</p> </blockquote>
<p>That is also why, with the mother pregnant again, the CPS had to consider whether the couple’s third child would need to be removed at birth.</p>
<p>“The baby, being a very vulnerable child, (would be) at risk of being indirectly or directly harmed whenever the parents have physical fights,” said CPS assistant manager Nurul Nadiah Mohamed Noor.</p>
<p>Reported incidents before their son was taken away showed that the father had already “involved the child in their conflictual relationship”, noted Maisurah.</p>
<p>For example, there was a public altercation between the father and the mother together with her family — while he was carrying the boy. The police had to intervene.</p>
<p>There was also a video taken by the father that showed him teaching the child to curse and “reject the mother”, cited Maisurah.</p>
<p>Yet, placing their newborn in alternative care was the last resort for the CPS. “We want ... family members who can come in to help out because that’s the most effective way,” Nadiah told the parents during their case plan discussion.</p>
<p>The problem was the couple were proposing that the father’s parents play the important role of safe persons, when the CPS had tried this before and assessed that the paternal grandparents could not be suitable any further.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of high-risk cases that the CPS’ intervention team must manage over a period of time, like a year or two, or longer. They have a caseload of about 1,200 children.</p>
<p>“We’re the team who takes on parents who are very challenging, unable or unwilling to work with us,” said Tan, who heads the team.</p>
<p>In the case of the angry father, it was only after his wife reconsidered the situation and persuaded him to accept foster care for the newborn that an agreement could be reached with the CPS.</p>
<p>The baby now joins his siblings in weekly contact sessions with the parents at the MSF.</p>
<p>These decisions that CPS officers make, such as whether to remove or return a child to the family, must stand up under the scrutiny of the Family Justice Courts.</p>
<p>And the courts do overrule the CPS’ assessments if, for example, there are no immediate safety concerns. That was the case with one family where there was suspected violence and drug use.</p>
<p>It was referred to the CPS by a hospital after the father presented himself as intoxicated or on drugs, with bloodshot eyes. There were also reports — from community agencies involved in the case — that the parents fight with each other.</p>
<p>The concern was that the three children, aged six years to four months, were being exposed to violence. In the CPS’ first interview with the two older children, they said they had seen the father hit the mother.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the parenting capacity of the couple, the court did not find substantial evidence to rule that the children should be placed out of home, as recommended by the CPS.</p>
<p>“The court felt that the parents hadn’t committed any direct harm on the children,” said CPS assistant director of investigation Tang Hong Hong.</p>
<blockquote> <p>(But the judge) didn’t throw out the case. He’s satisfied that there are CP (child protection) concerns, and (we) need to investigate further.</p> </blockquote>
<p>The work of the investigation team is thus to understand a lot more about such families in the first instance, and especially to “see the impact of whatever they're doing on the child”, said senior child protection officer Tessa Tay.</p>
<p>But that is not always easy. In this family’s case, she said the CPS “didn't get much from the children” after a second interview. Meanwhile, the father admitted only that he has “pushed” the mother before.</p>
<p>For this family, that meant no physical punishment of the children, no blaming them for the CPS’ involvement, as well as allowing its officers and those of other agencies to make announced or unannounced home visits.</p>
<p>“On top of that ... it’s important that we increase the visibility of the children in the community, so that’s why they have to go school every day, Monday to Friday,” Tay told the parents.</p>
<p>Non-attendance is not only a breach of the plan, but also calls for the CPS to go “to the house, to the school, anywhere, just to find out where the child is and whether the child is safe”, said Jai Prakash.</p>
<p>That was what happened when the two older children missed school on four out of the 12 days that followed.</p>
<p>Tang’s home visit, however, caused the mother to blow up because she needed the father to step up while she took care of their baby. And that was where the officer had to turn her focus.</p>
<p>In the end, Tang recommended that the CPS continue monitoring the family for six months. “The judge also agreed that a period of monitoring is necessary, not to guard the family but to provide support,” she said.</p>
<p>As a mother of four, Tang can understand the perspective of parents like the one who shouted at her.</p>
<p>“Caregiver stress is very real. We face our children 24/7. So without support ... it’s very hard for someone to care for children alone,” she said.</p>
<p>The job of a child protection officer is also “highly stressful”, pointed out Jai Prakash.</p>
<blockquote> <p>Very few parents would agree with what the child protection officers are doing.</p> </blockquote>
<p>One of the contentious issues is caning. On this, he said: “In situations of discipline, I’d say a child is able to understand why a parent was harsh. When it’s abuse, it’s where discipline leads to serious injuries.”</p>
<p>This was one such case that child protection officer Muhamad Mubarak Mohamed Johari had to investigate when a school counsellor found cane marks on an eight-year-old boy — “on the right side of his face, 5 cm by 2 cm”.</p>
<p>It was inflicted by the boy’s paternal aunt. She had been caring for him and his twin sister for two weeks and was getting complaints from the school about the boy misbehaving.</p>
<p>Then when he cut up his mathematics textbook, “she couldn’t control herself”. “She said it was in the heat of (the moment),” related Mubarak. “She just continued caning.”</p>
<p>The father, a widower, had left his children with their aunt because of a heart condition. He has been declared unfit to work for a year, and his medications cause him to sleep for more than 12 hours a day.</p>
<p>So the CPS decided to explore the safe adult option: The children’s paternal grandfather. Getting him to live with the family, however, was not the difficult part for Mubarak.</p>
<p>The officer had to wait to do the interview, and until the CPS could assess that the grandfather can step in, the twins had to be placed in a children’s home, apart from each other because of lack of space.</p>
<p>They could not stomach living separately, and it showed. “When a child cries, obviously it affects me ... I’m also human, and it’s hard,” said Mubarak. “I really tried my best to ensure that they were in the same home.”</p>
<p>The child protection officers have seen how sad children can be when a parent leaves. They have seen children neglected because of drugs. They have seen parents’ mental health issues compromise children’s safety. And there are times they get angry.</p>
<p>“Whenever there’s abuse or neglect, I always ask myself, 'why do you (parents) have children?” said child protection officer Atiqah Habsah Ashik.</p>
<p>And because they are worried about the children, there are cases that give them “nightmares”, said Tay. “At any point in time, a parent can escalate that one action,” she added. “I’m definitely fearful of a child dying.”</p>
<p>Every two weeks, officers are encouraged to share their problems at check-in sessions. They could be feeling stuck, tired or confused, for example. But they keep going.</p>
<p>“What keeps me in this job is basically I think it’s a form of responsibility,” said Mubarak. “A child can’t possibly go home feeling scared every single day.”</p>
<p>There are also long-term implications if a child remains in an unsafe environment, pointed out senior child protection officer Sakshi Dovedy.</p>
<p>“As a child grows older, the child would continue to engage in such behaviours to resolve any conflicts,” she said. “It’ll continue to impact him through his different stages of life and his relationships with others”.</p>
<p>In one case, she observed a four-year-old already demonstrate certain signals of that.</p>
<p>“It could be through him being louder, or him throwing things at his brothers, or being upset to the point where he’s screaming and being quite difficult to calm down,” she said.</p>
<p>“It isn’t very common for (four-year-olds) to attack other people or want to hurt them. It could be that he’s witnessed certain things that’ve been traumatic.”</p>
<p>When child protection officer Wong Wei Jin asked him where he learned to hit people, the boy and his older brother said “Mummy and Daddy”, who had fights at home.</p>
<p>“That was a bit surprising because, usually, children won’t be so able to clearly state such a thing,” added Wong.</p>
<p>In cases of parents who are unable and unwilling to change, the CPS will “shift its focus” to building up the child’s resilience, said Tan.</p>
<p>The agency’s Practice Enhancement Team works with the children to help them adjust to life changes and heal from trauma.</p>
<p>For the four-year-old the CPS is supporting, Dovedy thinks it is “promising” that the boy can remember certain emotional regulation tools that were introduced to him. And his “frequency of using physical aggression” has reduced.</p>
<p>This kind of positive change children get to experience in a different environment may even help their parents.</p>
<p>"Parents don’t suddenly wake up one day and decide to be bad parents. Sometimes they're so stuck in their ways of doing things. So we have to show them a different side through their children,” said Tan.</p>
<p>This work the CPS does with children and the fact that even abusive parents can “really love their children” were among the things that struck CNA producers Tang Hui Huan and Sharifah Alshahab.</p>
<p>“It was interesting that (the officers) would also put in sessions to help these children make sense of their lives. That’s something we didn’t think was part of their job,” said series producer Tang.</p>
<p>She added that the CPS realises “it can’t just be a small group of child protection officers looking out for these vulnerable children”, as the public, from schoolteachers to neighbours, “can keep their eyes and ears open”.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t mean that a child has to be hurt for you to call the hotline to alert the CPS. It could be emotional abuse or you just realise that something doesn’t feel right,” she said.</p>
<p>Sharifah hopes that Singaporeans “can all appreciate the complexities of these cases, and maybe afford to be more understanding of realities that aren’t our own, and ultimately create an atmosphere for children to grow up safe”.</p>
<p>For the CPS’ part, Tan believes its success rate has been “quite encouraging”. She said: “More than half of these children are returned home and remain safe in their parents’ care when we close the case.”</p>

<h1> Surviving recession: I lost my shop after 16 years. But my fashion business isn’t dead yet </h1>
<div> <p>Elsie Szto, who’s in her 50s, saw her boutique go from thriving in the CBD to slumping in a virtual ghost town. She’s one of 12 Singaporeans who shared with CNA Insider how they’ve weathered COVID-19’s economic fallout.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Goh Chiew Tong </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: “Unless you really need to, don't start a fashion business. Do something else.”</p>
<p>I once jokingly gave that piece of advice when someone asked me about the challenges of being a fashion entrepreneur during a pandemic. That was months ago, when I still had my shop, Butterflies and Marigold, in Guoco Tower.</p>
<p>We had just come out of the circuit breaker, when we had zero sales for two months — my first in 16 years of business. Needless to say, things were tough and definitely uncertain.</p>
<h3><a>EXPLORE THE INTERACTIVE SPECIAL: Surviving recession: How 12 Singaporeans Weathered COVID-19's Economic Fallout</a></h3>
<p>You would think being able to reopen in Phase 1 meant good news for us, but sales were dismal, to say the least.</p>
<p>We were located in the Central Business District (CBD), and a lot of our customers were still working from home.</p>
<p>Foot traffic dropped violently, and it was like a ghost town.</p>
