<div><div><p>You can see there’s a difference, but not a huge one.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Okay, actually it was the other way around — the first selection was Talese, the <i>second</i> was Sudowrite.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Are his words inherently superior to the machine’s? It’s arguable.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Back down the wormhole with a few more of Talese’s sentences. Here’s a blend of Talese and AI prose.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>So, you can easily tell the difference between Talese and the AI, right? Not really. Or, at least I couldn’t after walking away for a while.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>(The second, third and fifth sentences were the AI’s; the first and fourth were Talese’s.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He answered, and I explained the experiment.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Read them to me,” he said. I read him the AI-generated sentences.</p></div></div>
<p>In Talese-ian New Journalism, vivid descriptions — style — rule the day. And, it turns out, AI can do style. Yet what of criticism? That’s about analysis, ideas, <i>judgment. </i>It seemed unlikely an AI could manage those.</p>
<a>Tribune News Service</a> and other outlets. She recently published a
<i>could </i>have been something she wrote. Correcting for the facts, could the sentences be adapted back into her review?
<div><div><p>I sent her prose down the wormhole:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I asked Sudowrite what the review should say next.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I summarized crudely to see what the AI would do. It returned:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was less a movie than a 500,000 word novel about a man watching a movie.” Well, it looks like someone has taken a postmodernism class.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But then it gave me:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Which is decidedly not what Walsh wrote, but is certainly something a competent critic might write.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>I asked Walsh what she made of the fact that a computer program could, with her raw material, come up with something that sounded like a professional review.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Oddly, Gupta hasn’t optimized Sudowrite yet for nonfiction; it’s more for novelists. But he saw GPT-3 as very adaptive to journalism.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Ultimately, it’s a tool that will move things up the chain,” he said. “As a writer, you may not need to crank out words anymore. You’re more of an editor, choosing the best versions.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Does removing the painstaking bricklaying from writerly hands mean the end of journalism jobs as we know them, I asked.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>Arsenal</div></h3></div></div>
<a>Mesut Özil’s difficulties</a> with his former English Premier League club also started with a social media post, when in December 2019 he denounced China’s
<a>treatment of Uyghurs</a>, a largely Muslim Turkic minority in the northwest region of the country.
<div><div><p>Özil, who also refused to accept a pandemic-related pay cut last year, had not played for Arsenal since March 2020 when he was transferred in January to Turkish club Fenerbahce.</p></div></div>

<a>Daryl Morey summoned a spate of apologies</a> and

<a>pro-democracy protests that swelled that summer</a> that read: “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong.”

<a>a U.S.-China trade dispute</a> that exacerbated relations as each government imposed tariffs on the other, but NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly told
<a>CNBC</a> in 2018 that he didn’t see those issues affecting the league’s work there.
<div><div><p>“While we currently don’t anticipate [the trade war] hampering our continuing efforts to grow hockey in China, we also recognize there may be certain matters that are beyond our control,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We rely on the good judgment of all of our on-ice and off-ice personnel to do what they think is sensible and responsible,” he added.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Activision Blizzard</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>California-based Activision Blizzard, one of the world’s largest esports companies, <a>suspended Ng Wai Chung</a>, a Hong Kong-based professional gamer, over his 2019 statement supporting pro-democracy protests in the city.</p></div>
<a>banned</a> him from competing in digital card game Hearthstone for a year, forcing him to forfeit thousands in prize money. It also fired the commentators who conducted the interview.
<div><div><p>Longtime players vowed to quit the game <a>in protest</a> of the punishments, and the company <a>reportedly</a> lost a sponsorship with Mitsubishi Motors before Chung and the commentators’ <a>penalties were reduced</a>.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>It all began with a floating cat.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The giant feline suddenly appeared suspended over Tokyo’s Shinjuku train station. Throughout the summer, it stretched awake in the morning, meowed at passersby during rush hour and curled into a sleepy ball after midnight.</p></div>

<h2>There’s a push to send unmanned aerial vehicles to help during climate disasters like the Quad-state storms. What exactly can they do?</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steven Zeitchik</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 17, 2021 at 6:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Advocates envision a future filled with these little flying helpers, the devices becoming as common at emergency sites in a new era as firetrucks and helicopters.</p></div></div>
<a>80 percent of the drone market</a> in the United States, makes high-end drones like the industrial-grade Matrice, which has
<a>thermal capabilities</a> that can be deployed to scan for live victims in a climate disaster. DJI and other firms also make some models with
<a>“lidar,” </a>a laser tech that can be used to see 3-D images of a disaster site. For more firepower one can go to
<a>ruggedly weatherproof</a> Ghost line. (It’s used by the British Navy.)
<div><div><p>But much of the innovation is happening at boutique firms. Las Vegas-based BRINC, for instance, makes the Lemur, which has a <a>glass-shattering device</a> that can get to trapped people.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Like other drones, Pegasus’s also target wildfires: The machines help commanders on the ground by scouting and mapping the flames from above, moving easily where humans can’t go safely.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And there’s more innovation coming. German researchers have even <a>studied</a> drones that can detect a distressed person’s scream and send a call for help to emergency authorities.</p></div></div>
<a>Law Enforcement Drone Association,</a> made up of drone-friendly officers from around the country trying to push the movement forward.
<p>But there’s a reason many of the efforts are more in the volunteer realm, like <a>Dronesar,</a> a U.S.-based group of 86 volunteer pilots around the world who offer to step in to fly their drone to search for a missing person in an emergency.</p>

<div><h1>Is artificial intelligence about to transform the mammogram?</h1></div>
<h2>An MIT researcher who survived breast cancer has devised a technique that seems to predict many breast cancer cases</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Steven Zeitchik</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 21, 2021 at 7:00 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>When Regina Barzilay returned to work after her breast cancer leave seven years ago, she was struck by an unexpected thought.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The MIT artificial-intelligence expert had just endured chemotherapy, two lumpectomies and radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital, and all the brutal side effects that come along with those treatments.</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<p>Barzilay had spent years researching the AI specialty known as natural-language processing, which applies algorithms to textual data. Those skills, she realized, might be put to a different use: predicting cancer. She decided to shift her research.</p>
<div><div><p>The AI has an oracular quality: The designers themselves don’t understand how it works. They’re just certain that it does.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>That fact raises many broader social and moral implications. But there’s also a more practical matter — whether the medical establishment and insurance companies will at all embrace this.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Training Mirai</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Any family that has been affected by breast cancer knows the trajectory: A person is feeling perfectly fine when a mammogram or self-examination turns up a troubling sign, jolting everything to a stop. An MRI or biopsy then confirms the suspicion.</p>
<div><div><p>Through it all, a question gnaws: How could a body betray us without offering up so much as a warning message?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Barzilay asked another question: What if it does and we just haven’t built the tools to hear it?</p></div></div>
<b> </b>the AI would then automatically recommend further testing such as a biopsy or MRI. How well, the team wondered, could Mirai predict which mammogram belonged to a person who developed cancer over a five-year period?
<div><div><p>The AI was correct in an average of about 76 out of 100 cases, an improvement of 22 percent over Tyrer-Cuzick, translating to millions of women in the real world.</p></div></div>
<p>“This is the next, very positive step forward,” Dorraya El-Ashry, chief scientific officer for the <a>Breast Cancer Research Foundation</a>, said in an interview. “There is a lot of work to do. But it is very encouraging.”</p>
<a>Jameel Clinic</a> and the British nonprofit
<a> Wellcome Trust.</a> Barzilay and Yala early on decided to make the technology open-source so any hospital could use it; there are no patents on Mirai.
<div><div><p>“It was never a question,” Barzilay said. “This should be for everyone to build on.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A different tack</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Mirai team also hopes the AI will better represent women of color.</p></div></div>
<a>more likely</a> to die of breast cancer than White women. Ashkenazi Jewish women are
<a>10 times as likely</a> as other groups to have gene mutations associated with breast cancer.
<a>according to</a> the American Cancer Society.
<div><div><p>When Barzilay was first starting her research, most hospitals turned her away, saying breast cancer had been treated for years without AI.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Yala, meanwhile, was born in Algeria and arrived as a 10-year-old in the suburbs of Chicago after his parents fled political instability at home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I guess coming from somewhere far away made me not accept the status quo way of doing things,” the 26-year-old said. “And it definitely helped me go around the world begging hospitals for mammograms.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Trust issues</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The ethical implications for Mirai are significant.</p></div></div>
<p>Sarah Eskreis-Winkler, a radiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center’s breast imaging center and head of that<b> </b>center’s artificial-intelligence division, said she is bullish about how it can transform preventive care.</p>
<div><div><p>Much like self-driving cars, Barzilay and Lehman say, the machine does not have to eliminate error in every single case. It simply has to be marginally better than humans in the total number of cases.</p></div></div>
<a>Sharsheret</a>, a group focusing on Jewish women affected by breast cancer. “If people can understand their risk better, they can take measures to protect their health and save lives.”
<div><div><p>Many radiologists in the field are enthusiastic too. Katerina Dodelzon, Katzen’s colleague at Weill Cornell, noted the technology’s ability to take radiology “from diagnostic to prognostic” functions.</p></div></div>
<a>Google,</a> the Dutch start-up
<a>ScreenPoint</a> and the British company
<a>Kheiron Medical.</a> Those efforts have caused some consternation in the radiology community.
<div><div><h3><div>Real-world rollout</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The hurdles will arrive with them.</p></div></div>
<p>Barzilay and Yala said that adding mammograms for some younger higher-risk people will actually lower costs for insurers by helping avert expensive treatments down the road. But they acknowledged that persuading them of this will take time.</p>
<a> Young Survival Coalition,</a> an advocacy group for women diagnosed with breast cancer under age 40 — a group that has seen rates
<div><div><p>“But I think it remains to be seen how easily this could be implemented,” she said. “Because in the end, it still requires a mammogram be performed. And that isn’t simple for people under 40.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Barzilay said she has no choice but to press on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Just out of a sense of dark curiosity, she recently fed that initial mammogram into Mirai. It told her she was high-risk.</p></div></div>

<p>“The world has completely changed,” Rothberg said. “We have telemedicine now. People are taking control of their health. They don’t want to go to a lab and wait a week to get a test back. And they don’t have to.”</p>
<div><div><p>The mushrooming of the omicron variant during the holiday season has laid bare America’s testing challenges.</p></div></div>
<a>new coronavirus cases</a> are now being documented in the country every day, yet it’s surprisingly hard to be counted among them.
<a>Long wait times</a> abide for the lab-based molecular tests commonly called PCRs — hours to get swabbed, one to two days for the results. Meanwhile, the at-home antigen tests (among the brands you will probably find to be out
<a>of stock</a> at your local CVS are Abbott BinaxNOW, Quidel QuickVue and Ellume) are not only unavailable but are also rife with false negatives.
<a>numerous studies.</a> Antigen tests may not catch the virus unless it’s already replicating heavily, which means it could miss instances in which a person is infectious but not wildly symptomatic.
<a>possibly higher rate </a>of asymptomatic spread increases this danger. What’s more, Anthony S. Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Biden, has
<a> suggested </a>that some antigen tests may miss omicron entirely.
<div><div><p>Detect isn’t the only company going in a different direction.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“For the price of a gym membership, you get 10 PCR-quality tests and 24/7 access to a physician for a year,” he said, describing one plan.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the price question is not easily dismissed by experts. To import lab technology into the home could, for all its convenience, also mean bringing all the costs with it.</p></div></div>
<p>“The science is good for these molecular at-home tests,” said James Collins, an MIT professor and synthetic-biology pioneer. “But the costs are high in a way that makes me wonder if they really can have the reach they want.”</p>

<a>atomic-level test</a> is being researched to further improve accuracy. And at Japan’s Kyoto Prefectural University, a researcher, Yasuhiro Tsukamoto,
<a>discovered</a> that ostrich cells would react in a way that could make a mask glow if the wearer was positive.
<div><div><p>Experts describe the new tech as part of a pattern in which tests continually get better without ever being perfect, a dance between inadequacy and innovation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For those working on new at-home tests, however, large-scale accuracy may be beside the point.</p></div></div>
<p>“Antigen tests are the right answer when you’re talking about 300 million people,” Rothberg said from St. Barts. “But when you’re talking about your grandmother or an immunocompromised child, they’re not.”</p>
<div><div><p>He contemplated the company’s mission. “You can do all this Googling at home, but you can’t get a good test,” he said. “It shouldn’t be that way.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>This time of year always brings thoughts of how badly we messed up the past 12 months and how much better we’ll definitely make the next dozen.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For the many of us who have not spent 2021 at the gym calling our mothers while planning our weekly soup-kitchen volunteer schedule, we know the insectoid life span such New Year’s resolutions can have.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“Change my name to one of my favorite shapes,” it suggests, or “Every Friday for a year I will wear a different hat.” And, “Every time I hear bells for a month, I will paint a potato.”</p></div></div>

<a>coronavirus</a> antiviral drugs by as much as a month, potentially saving lives. Canadian researchers in September
<a>found that </a>AI made consistently better choices than doctors in treating behavioral problems. Even a button-down institution like Deloitte has a staffer who has
<a>persuasively argued </a>that we should use AI, not humans, to update government regulations.
<a>our marriage choices</a>, substantive life decisions are kind of already shaped by AI.
<div><p>Plus there’s the psychological benefit. Think about the fears of making the wrong decision now disappearing. Our blood pressure would plummet. Then we wouldn’t need an AI to tell us what blood-pressure medication to take.</p></div>
<a>to worry </a>that AI would unknowingly replicate our deep-seated biases. Not to mention
<a>all kinds of potential for global catastrophe</a> as humans give up important areas of control to a black box. But, you know, trade-offs.)
<i>tell it</i> what we want it to tell us to do. Think of it as Alfred from Batman. Yes, it can know us better than we know ourselves. But only from quietly hanging around us for so long.
<div><div><p>In talking to Shane, I asked if she could ask GPT-3 to customize some resolutions for me. I shared some personal tidbits (loves hockey, has dogs, film and tech aficionado). It returned:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>♦ “Treat every dog I meet like a celebrity.” (Can do.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>♦ “Write a film script based on the rise and fall of the Whac-A-Mole empire.” (Oh that’s actually a good idea.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>♦ “Whenever a goalie lets in a goal I will shout ‘Is that your final answer?’ ” (I already do that one.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>And finally: “Every time I see a mirror I will remember that it is the gateway to another dimension.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Done. Just as long as it doesn’t lead to the gym.</p></div></div>

<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the intersection of technology and politics.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Cristiano Lima</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>Yesterday at 9:18 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Happy Wednesday! We hope this newsletter edition will make for some good reading during your next maddening, daylong traffic jam.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below: President Biden touts the 5G agreement struck with wireless carriers, and Tesla takes heat for its new showroom in China. First up:</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Google is manipulating browser extensions to stifle competitors, DuckDuckGo CEO says</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Google is already facing mounting legal challenges from regulators globally who accuse the tech giant of maintaining an illegal monopoly over its search and digital advertising businesses. </p></div></div>
<p>But now one of its most prominent rivals is alleging that the titan is abusing browser extensions to favor its products and stifle competitors, adding a new wrinkle to the high-stakes antitrust debate and momentum to calls for new regulation.</p>
<div><div><p>Weinberg said the tweaks — although subtle — have had a major impact. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s the first time the company is publicly speaking out about how the practice has impacted its business, including what it says are millions in potential lost revenue since Google changed its prompts in 2020.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“For search engines like us that are trying to actively allow consumers to switch, [or] choose an alternative, they're making it unreasonably complicated to do so and confusing consumers,” Weinberg said of Google. </p></div>
<div><div><p>McAlister said the notification appears “regardless of the user’s chosen search provider,” and that some other browsers have “similar policies.”</p></div></div>
<p>Weinberg said he hopes by speaking out about the tactic it will strengthen calls for bipartisan antitrust legislation under consideration on Capitol Hill to ban major platforms from prioritizing their own products and disadvantaging rivals. </p>
<p>Weinberg said the drop in user retention via their extension on Chrome, which was previously unreported, is one of the most “direct” pieces of evidence they have seen about how Google’s practices have harmed their business. </p>
<div><div><p>“I think it really helps to make it concrete and show some very specific examples of where things are happening,” he said during a 30-minute video interview. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s a finding that could also serve as fodder for state and federal enforcers as they press ahead with their antitrust lawsuits against the tech behemoth.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He added, “We’ve been in touch with the DOJ and we’re trying to help them, and the states for that matter, in their case to provide them with any information that would be helpful.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But those legal bouts are poised to drag out over several years, which Weinberg said makes the need for Congress to act and pass new laws even more pressing.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We definitely need momentum on real legislation,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The two other countries that we’re focused on is Australia and the [United Kingdom],” Weinberg said. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Those are just two more regions where Google and other tech giants are now facing surging efforts to overhaul regulation of their sector.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also blasted the decision, saying in a tweet linking to a story on the move that “nationless corporations are helping the Chinese Communist Party cover up genocide and slave labor in the region.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>Tesla and Musk have broad popularity and official approval in China despite recent backlash over allegations that satellites belonging to Musk’s SpaceX presented risks to China’s space station.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Biden applauded ATT and Verizon for agreeing to a two-week delay of their 5G rollout</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Transportation officials sought a delay amid warnings by the aviation industry that 5G technology could impact airline safety systems. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>The FTC threatened legal action and fines if companies don’t protect themselves against a software bug</div></h4></div></div>
