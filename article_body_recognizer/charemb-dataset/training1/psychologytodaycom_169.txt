<h1> Are Narcissists Philosophical Zombies? </h1>
<h2> Narcissists are empty inside, devoid of an inner world just like zombies. </h2>
<li>The hypothetical beings known as philosophical zombies fail in debunking physicalism to explain human consciousness.</li>
<li>Philosophical zombies may help explain particular anomalous human psychologies.</li>
<li>Philosophical zombies, psychopaths, and narcissists all share a fundamental lack of inner worlds.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Zombie walk 2011 in Brisbane, Queensland Australia</div> <div>Source: Andrew Mercer/Wikicommons</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>The notion of philosophical zombies, though fun to talk about in introductory philosophy classes, has always seemed nonsensical to me. But the concept might be useful in conceptualizing a problematic anomaly in human psychology: <a>narcissism</a>.</p>
<p>Philosophical Zombies and Physicalism</p>
<p>Philosophical Zombies Defy Evolution and Common Sense</p>
<a>sex</a> (reproduction). Organisms that didn't play by evolution’s rules, well, they’re gone.
<p>Hominids evolved only after millions of years of precursory life forms sufficiently attuned to their environments, enabling individuals to survive (at least long enough to reproduce) and consequently whole groups and species to survive.</p>
<p>Asking why we experience the world qualitatively ignores both evolutionary theory and common sense. Asking how we experience the world qualitatively is more interesting and will presumably be answered by brain science and not philosophy of mind.</p>
<p>Another Possible Use of P-Zombies: Psychological Anomalies</p>
<p>But p-zombies could nevertheless be helpful in conceptualizing human anomalies marked by a stark lack of inner world. For instance, psychopaths and <a>serial killers</a> commonly lack <a>guilt</a> for their criminal behavior.</p>
<a>psychopathic</a> and healthy brains underlying the fact that normal people will feel guilt and
<a>shame</a> for accidentally killing someone. In contrast, serial killers reportedly do not feel these negative emotions for their intentional and repeated killings. In a sense, they are at least partially p-zombies.
<a>education</a> of any kind or party to relationships of any kind has some degree of self-awareness.
<a>meditation</a>, being open to criticism and self-improvement, or being in
<p>P-Zombies are Empty Inside Just Like Narcissists</p>
<a>anger</a> and shame. But they push those aspects of themselves deep down and instead act outwardly
<a>charismatic</a>, energetic, and proud. The shiny façade they show to the world is like the upside-down world of their inner broken selves.

<a>an analysis of the weight gain potential</a> of anti-
<a>psychotic</a> medications found that this drug caused the greatest increase in weight. The drug seems to dismantle the brain’s ability to control
<a>appetite</a>, and so patients must contend with a seemingly unceasing need to eat. This unwelcome side effect has been reported to start almost immediately: One study found that almost 60% of patients who began this drug

<p>Pharmaceutical relief for emotional disorders shouldn't cause distressing weight gain. Perhaps non-judgmental social outreach to reassure is a complementary behavorial approach reminding patients that it's what's on the inside that counts most. </p>

<h1> Setting the Record Straight on Antipsychotics </h1>
<h2> Antipsychotics are neither all good or all bad. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Psychopharmacology? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div>
<a>psychotic episode</a>. I and many others have fought vigorously against these dangerous misuses of antipsychotic medication.
<p>But in recent years, critics of psychiatry have added an additional, counterintuitive argument against antipsychotics—that they actually cause or worsen psychotic symptoms and should not be used on a long term basis.</p>
<p>Patients with chronic psychotic symptoms usually do quite well on meds and quite badly off them. The decision to stay on or go off antipsychotics has tremendous significance in a person's life—and is sometimes a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>I have asked Dr. Ronald Pies, Professor of Psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University and Tufts University, to set the record straight on what the literature does and does not say about long-term use of antipsychotics.</p>
<a>placebo</a>-controlled studies are fewer than we would like, and existing studies are always subject to different interpretations.

<p>The authors concluded that '...the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs for maintenance treatment in schizophrenia was clear. Antipsychotic drugs were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse at seven to 12 months.'</p>
<p>About 27% relapsed while taking medication, versus 64% taking a placebo. Quality of life was also better in participants staying on medication.</p>
<p>Of course, the authors noted that 'This [benefit] must be weighed against the side effects of antipsychotic drugs,” which include sedation, weight gain, and movement disorders.</p>
<p>Thanks so much, Dr. Pies, for this illuminating review.</p>
<p>Beyond the scientific literature, there are also two huge, naturalistic experiments illustrating that psychosis was, and is, an enormous problem, without invoking antipsychotics as its cause.</p>
