<div><p>A newsletter briefing on cybersecurity news and policy.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Joseph Marks</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>Today at 7:49 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Welcome to The Cybersecurity 202! Today marks one year since the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol building. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Below: The Jan. 6 attack raised major questions about Congress's cybersecurity, and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell was subpoenaed by the committee investigating it.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Maricopa County has 93 pages of pushback to that partisan election audit</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>Officials in Maricopa County, Az. have delivered a stinging rebuke to the partisan audit that state Republicans forced on their 2020 election results.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>The background</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Over the past year, the Maricopa County audit has stood as a prime example of Republicans sowing mistrust in the election process despite no substantial evidence of fraud.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>The rebuttal</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Claims of election fraud can be dangerous, Gates said at a county board meeting, linking the Maricopa audit to the Capitol attack launched by Trump supporters.</p></div></div>
<div><p>“We have seen how people react when they think that an election has been stolen. They storm the U.S. Capitol. They threaten to kill and hang and shoot election workers. And they called other Americans traitors,” he said.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The county report is a point-by-point refutation of allegations in the Cyber Ninjas audit. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The tally:</p></div></div>
<li>The report cites 22 Cyber Ninjas claims it describes as “misleading”</li>
<li>Forty-one that were “inaccurate”</li>
<li>Thirteen that were “demonstrably false”</li>
<li>It also outlines faulty claims and analysis affecting more than 53,000 ballots</li>
<div><div><p>“This audit is being held up as an example for other states to use for post-election audits and this is why it’s important to highlight these issues,” Jarrett told commissioners. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Maricopa County report’s brand of careful analysis isn’t winning the day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Similarly partisan audits are underway in Texas and Wisconsin and are being pushed in Pennsylvania and elsewhere. </p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The keys</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Jan. 6 attack raised big questions about congressional cybersecurity</div></h4></div></div>

<div><h1>Tech giants swore off donations to those who denied Biden’s win. Their cash is still likely getting through.</h1></div>
<div><p>A newsletter briefing on the intersection of technology and politics.</p></div>
<div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Cristiano Lima</div></div></span></div></span><p>with research by Aaron Schaffer</p></div></div><div>Today at 9:30 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><h4><div>Tech giants swore off donations to those who denied Biden’s win. Their cash is still likely getting through.</div></h4></div></div>
<div><div><p>A year later, major companies in the sector have largely stuck by the letter of their word, not giving funds altogether or to those specific candidates for much of the 2022 election cycle.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But critics on the left say many of these organizations violated the spirit of the commitments by donating to GOP national organizations, which made no such assurances about who will or won’t receive the funds.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This means their money could still end up supporting the candidates they rebuffed. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It’s one of the many issues for which tech companies are still answering to policymakers about their actions leading up to and in the wake of the insurrection at the Capitol. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It also shows that while some Republican tech critics are urging their colleagues to stop taking money from Silicon Valley as a sign of protest, that movement has been slow to gain steam.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Now, companies are again facing pressure from liberal watchdogs to honor or expand their donation halts, signaling that scrutiny is likely to live on beyond the anniversary.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Here’s a breakdown of how much companies have stuck to their commitments, according to federal disclosure filings reviewed by The Technology 202, confirming past reporting:</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Verizon: Like ATT and Google, the wireless carrier pledged to halt contributions to objectors and has not made any since, but it did contribute $15,000 apiece to the NRCC and NRSC.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spokespeople for Oracle, ATT, Verizon, Comcast and T-Mobile did not return requests for comment on the donations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Few companies, however, have explicitly said whether they plan to swear off donations for certification objectors for good, leaving open the possibility they quietly resume in the future.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h4><div>Twitter set up a team to monitor its site for Jan. 6 anniversary</div></h4></div></div>

<div><p>Privacy Reset: A guide to the important settings you should change now.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If you only do one thing</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Audit your apps</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What makes an Android smartphone or tablet truly yours is the apps you use on it, but it’s common for people to install apps without thinking about what they have access to.</p></div></div>
<li>If you find any apps that you don’t use frequently, just uninstall them. Go to Settings → Apps → See all apps, then find the app you want to get rid of. Tap its name, followed by the “Uninstall” button.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>If you’re still concerned about privacy</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Rethink your unlocks</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you’re a stickler for security, you many want to avoid unlock patterns and face recognition — some versions can be surprisingly easy to fool. Here’s how to change your unlock method:</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Go to Settings → Security → Screen Lock and select a new screen lock type.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p><b>Hide your sensitive notifications</b></p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Go to Settings → Apps and Notifications → Notifications and make sure the “Sensitive notifications” is unticked. (If done correctly, the toggle will appear gray.)</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If you want to be extra cautious</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Make sure your phone is encrypted</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Use Chrome wisely, or not at all</b></p></div></div>

<div><div>Your Data and Privacy</div><div><h1>Apple iOS privacy settings to change now</h1><h2>How to make your iPhone and iPad as private as possible</h2></div></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Heather Kelly</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>November 26, 2021|Updated December 14, 2021 at 6:55 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Privacy is a central part of Apple’s marketing campaigns and it sounds great in the company’s ads and product announcements. But actually making things as private as possible on Apple devices does require a bit of effort and time.</p>
<p>We’ve assembled all the settings you can change on your iPhone and iPad to make the devices as private as possible. These instructions are all based on iOS 15, the newest version of the operating system, but details can vary between updates.</p>
<div><div><p>There’s only so much that can be done on the device-side, so make sure you’re also keeping an eye on settings for the most popular apps themselves with the rest of our privacy guide.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Disable ad tracking</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Record what your apps are up to</b></p></div></div>
<li>To turn it on go to Settings → Privacy → (scroll to bottom) App Privacy Report → Turn on App Privacy Report</li>
<div><p>Big Tech is pushing apps on your devices. Here’s how to take back control of your apps</p></div>
<div><div><p><b>Revoke access to your data liberally</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>This is one of the best things you can do for your privacy. Apps can access huge swath of data about you and your device, but Apple has included a way to control who sees what.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>You can turn off Location Services and revoke access for all apps, but that might stops key features from working on certain apps like Weather or Uber. Instead, go down the list and manage them one-by-one
<div><div><p><b>Stop Apple from targeting its own ads</b></p></div></div>
<div><p>Apple makes a big fuss about other companies targeting ads, but it does it as well. The company’s ads appear in places like the App Store, Apple News and the Stocks app. There’s an easy way to turn off Apple’s targeting.</p></div>
<div><ul><li>Go to Settings → Privacy → Apple Advertising (at the bottom of the screen). Toggle off the option for Personalized Ads so it is gray.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><p><b>Stop sharing data for analytics</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Apple and its developers collect data about how you use your device and their products to improve products and services, but if you want, you can cut off access. (You may already have opted out when you set up your device.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><b>Browse the Internet while sharing less</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>These settings can make Safari more private, though you also have the option to use a third-party browser app on iOS, such as Firefox.</p></div></div>
<li>Go to Settings → Safari → Search Engine. Change your default search engine from Google to a more private option like DuckDuckGo.</li>
<li>Tap on “Clear History and Website Data” if you want a clean slate, but you may need to log on again to some sites.</li>
<li>Turn on an ad blocker. Under Settings → Safari → General, tap on Extensions. You can view Safari extensions in the app store and look for content blockers that you want to install, such as Adblock, Wipr or Crystal.</li>
<li>Feel free to use the Private Browsing mode in Safari, but remember it is just hiding your search history on the phone or connected devices.</li>
<div><div><p><b>Open emails in peace</b></p></div></div>
<div><div><p>New in iOS 15, this feature stops companies that send you emails from getting your IP address or knowing if you’ve opened their message.</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li><span>Go to Settings → Mail → Privacy Protection.<b> </b>Turn on the toggle for Protect Mail Activity.</span></li></ul></div>
<div><div><p><b>Lock down Siri</b></p></div></div>
<li>Scroll down to Siri Dictation History and hit the option to Delete Siri Dictation History.</li>

<div><div><h3><div>If you only do one thing</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Make sure all your payments are private</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>By default, any time you pay for a babysitter or reimburse a friend on Venmo, that amount and description are public and shown to your other friends on the app. Here’s how to make it private.</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>In the smartphone app, click on the profile icon, then the settings icon (looks like a gear). Select Privacy and set the Default Privacy Settings to Private (not Public or Friends).</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If you’re still concerned about privacy</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Hide past transactions</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>That first setting only changed what people can see going forward, so you’ll have to take another step to hide past payments.</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>In the same screen, scroll down to More and click Past Transactions. Tap on “Change All to Private”</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Hide your friends list</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>This may be one of the app’s sneakiest defaults, and it’s the one that got President Biden. Hide all your contacts ASAP.</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Go back to the main Privacy screen, select Friends List under More. Set to Private, then toggle off the switch at the bottom for “Appear in Other Users’ Friends Lists.”</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Don’t share location information</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>There are also some things you can do to limit what data Venmo can get about you to share or make public. Starting with your location, which is not required to make a payment.</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Go back to the main Privacy screen, select Location under More, if available. This will reroute you to your smartphone settings where you can make sure it doesn’t have location access.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Don’t share your personal contacts with Venmo</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>You can also limit which contacts are imported into the app. (It’s still easy to find people by their name or using the built in codes.)</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Consider using a different payment app. We’ve run down all the options and different use cases here.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Let’s face it. Facebook is hard to quit.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Facebook is also the connective tissue between nearly 3 billion people around the world. If you can’t leave, at least you can make your data as private as possible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Stop Facebook from targeting ads based on what you do online.</div></h5></div></div>
<ul><li>Go to Settings Privacy → Settings → Ads → Ad Settings → “Data about your activity from partners.”</li><li>Turn this off for your Facebook and Instagram accounts. (The toggle is gray if off, blue if on.)</li></ul>
<li>Go Settings Privacy → Privacy Checkup → “Who can see what you share.”</li>
<li>On the first screen, scroll down and make sure all your profile information is set to “Friends of Only Me” unless you have a reason for it being public.</li>
<div><div><h5><div>Turn off Face Recognition for photos and videos</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Facial recognition is a fast-growing feature that has unknown privacy implications for the future. Stay safe and turn it off now.</p></div></div>

<div><div><h5><div>Lock down your other ad settings</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even if Facebook can’t target ads based on what you do off the site, it can still use the data it already collected about you on the site. You can limit that with these settings.</p></div></div>
<li>Settings and Privacy → Settings → Ads (you’ll have to scroll down) → Ad Settings.</li>
<li>Under “Categories used to reach you” make sure to de-select all details about yourself.</li>
<li>Under “Interest categories” and “Other categories,” remove anything listed.</li>
<li>Click “Ads shown off Facebook” and change the toggle to “Not Allowed.”</li>
<li>And under “Social” select “Only me” for who can see what ads you have liked.</li>
<b> </b>if you have ample free time.
<div><div><h3><div>If you want to be extra cautious</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>First, save your old posts and photos someplace other than Facebook.</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Deleting old Facebook content cannot be undone, so if you want to have a record of your years of Facebook posts, likes and photos, back it up first. Do this before deleting an account forever or the next step.</p></div></div>
<li>Settings Privacy → Settings → Your Facebook Information → Transfer a Copy of Your Information. Here you can send photos, posts and notes to Google, Dropbox or other services.</li>
<div><div><h5><div>Delete all your past Facebook activity</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>“Disconnect” and delete “Off-Facebook” activity</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Outside businesses also share data with Facebook. You can cut down on those transactions with this setting.</p></div></div>
<li>Settings Privacy → Settings → Your Facebook Information → Off-Facebook Activity.</li>
<li>Go back to Settings Privacy → Settings → Your Facebook Information → Off-Facebook Activity.</li>
<li>Now click on the link on the right that says “Clear History.” You’ll be shown a warning and another button that says “Clear History.” Click and you are done. For now.</li>

<div><div><h3><div>If you only do one thing</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p>We all have hopes, dreams and wishes. But you may not realize that some of those are publicly listed on Amazon’s website. Take a moment to make your Amazon Wish Lists private (unless you don’t mind; that’s fine, too).</p></div>
<div><ul><li>Go to this link or the Amazon homepage → All → Help Settings→ Your Account → Your lists. For each list, click on the three dots on the right and select Manage List. Set the Privacy setting to Private.</li></ul></div>
<div><p>Amazon may be sharing your Internet connection with neighbors. Here’s how to turn it off.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If you’re still concerned about privacy (and use Alexa)</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>If you use Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa you should start by tightening up its various privacy controls.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Turn off Amazon Sidewalk</div></h5></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Open the Alexa app on a phone, tap the More icon → Settings → Account Settings → Amazon Sidewalk. Turn off Enabled. It should now say Disabled.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Clear and stop Alexa voice recordings</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>Alexa works by listening for commands, then saving those audio recordings to improve the underlying AI technology. You can stop the recordings from being saved.</p></div></div>
<li>In the app, go to Settings → Alexa Privacy → Manage Your Alexa Data → Choose How Long to Save Voice Recordings, then select Don’t Save Recordings.</li>
<li>Amazon claims this will “degrade” its ability to understand you. If you’re worried, you can just set it to auto delete more often.</li>
<li>Or you can do it in the Alexa app in Settings → Alexa Privacy → Review Voice History.</li>
<li>Turn on this setting to delete voice recordings at any time by voice. In the Alexa app, go to Settings → Alexa Privacy → Manage Your Alexa Data and toggle on Enable Deletion by Voice</li>
<div><div><div><div><a> Introducing Help Desk: Technology coverage that makes tech work for you </a></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><h5><div>Stop Amazon from saving your search history</div></h5></div></div>
<div><div><p>This just takes away a possibly revealing trail of everything you’ve looked up on Amazon. It’s a necessity if you share a computer.</p></div></div>
<div><ul><li>Log in to Amazon on the web. Under the search bar, click Browsing History → View and Edit → Manage history → Off. You will no longer get personalized recommendations.</li></ul></div>
<div><div><h3><div>If you want to be extra cautious</div></h3></div></div>
