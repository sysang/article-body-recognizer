<p>The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol has requested its first interview with a current member of Congress, requesting to talk to Republican Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, the panel said Monday.</p>
<a>Donald Trump</a> in the days leading up to Jan. 6.
<p>The request is the first time the committee has asked to interview a sitting member of Congress, as they said Perry was part of the internal pressure on the Justice Department to intervene in the election and stop or reverse the results.</p>
<p>The panel has also reportedly requested any records of communication between Perry and Trump or members of his legal team involved in the planning of Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Perry has said he, Trump and Clark met and discussed the concerns they had about the security and validity of the election. He has also publicly disputed and refused to accept President <a>Joe Biden</a>'s victory in the election.</p>
<p>The panel previously voted to hold Clark in contempt following a deposition in which he refused to answer questions, and Thompson has said the committee is not pursuing the charges until they try to depose Clark again.</p>
<p>His lawyer has said Clark will continue to assert his Fifth Amendment rights to not incriminate himself once the second deposition takes place. It was rescheduled because Clark is dealing with a medical condition that has not been made public.</p>
<p>An Associated Press request for comment left with Perry's office was not immediately returned.</p>
<a>a Senate Judiciary report released in October</a> outlining how Trump's effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat brought the Justice Department to the brink of chaos and prompted top officials there and at the White House to threaten to resign.
<p>The Justice Department found no evidence of widespread fraud in Pennsylvania or any other state, and senior Justice officials dismissed Perry's claims</p>
<p>Perry has previously said his "official communications" with Justice Department officials were consistent with the law.</p>
<p>The panel has already interviewed around 300 people as it seeks to create a comprehensive record of the attack and the events leading up to it.</p>
<a>Mike Pence</a> and Republican members of Congress to try to overturn the count at the Jan. 6 congressional certification. Election officials across the country, along with the courts, had repeatedly dismissed Trump's claims.
<p>An angry mob of Trump supporters were echoing his false claims as they brutally beat Capitol police and broke into the building that day, interrupting the certification of Biden's victory.</p>
<p>In his request for a meeting with Perry, Thompson wrote: "We would like to meet with you soon to discuss these topics, but we also want to accommodate your schedule."</p>

<p>Michael Fanone, the District of Columbia police officer who was dragged into a mob and beaten by rioters during the U.S. Capitol attack last January, has resigned from the force and will take a job with CNN.</p>
<a>Police</a> Department on Monday, nearly a year after the 41-year-old officer was knocked unconscious and injured during the Capitol assault, The Washington Post reported. He will officially leave the force on December 31.
<p>On Monday, CNN's chief media correspondent, Brian Stelter, tweeted that a network spokesperson confirmed that Fanone will take on a new role as an on-air contributor on law enforcement issues.</p>
<a>Donald Trump</a> in 2016 but not in 2020, was outspoken about the January 6 attack in the months that followed. He made extensive media appearances and appeared before
<a>Congress</a> to recount the attack in detail and to describe his physical injuries and emotional trauma.
<p>In July, he told the House select committee investigating the riot that he was "grabbed, beaten, Tased, all while being called a traitor to my country." He also said he heard rioters shout, "Kill him with his own gun."</p>
<p>Fanone made many public appearances following the attack, repeatedly speaking out against lawmakers who downplayed the seriousness of the day's events and warning that the riot posed a legitimate threat to democracy.</p>
<p>"Nothing, truly nothing, has prepared me to address those elected members of our government who continue to deny the events of that day. And, in doing so, betray their oath of office," the officer testified to Congress.</p>
<p>He said he believes that his public stance made him unpopular among fellow officers, who he alleged chastised him in various online forums. Fanone told the Post that there are only two D.C. police officers he still considers friends.</p>
<p>"Clearly, there are some members of our department who feel their oath is to Donald Trump and not to the Constitution," he said on Monday. "I no longer felt like I could trust my fellow officers and decided it was time to make a change."</p>
<p>"In a lot of ways, our department has forgotten about January 6 and has allowed itself to become distracted from what happened," he told the Post. "All I do is serve as a reminder of that."</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to CNN and the D.C. Metropolitan Police for further comment but did not hear back before publication.</p>
<p>A California man was sentenced to three years behind bars after sending threatening messages to dozens of journalists, politicians and their families after the 2020 presidential election and during the January 6 Capitol riot.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that Robert Lemke, 36, targeted those people "for the perceived offense of stating the facts" about then-President Donald Trump's loss in the election.</p>
<p>Lemke pleaded guilty in mid-October to one count of making threatening interstate communications to a New York-based family member of one journalist while the Capitol riot was taking place.</p>
<p>He told the family member that the journalist's "words are putting you and your family at risk. We are nearby, armed and ready. Thousands of us are active/retired law enforcement, military, etc. That's how we do it."</p>
<a>Congress</a>, other politicians and families on January 6 as a mob breached the Capitol building and disrupted the certification process for President
<a>Joe Biden</a>'s election victory.
<a>Department of Justice</a> said in a press release. He texted the brother pictures of a home in his neighborhood and said that the congressman was "putting your entire family at risk with his lies and other words."
<p>"We are armed and nearby your house. You had better have a word with him. We are not far from his either," the messages said.</p>
<p>Lemke was sentenced on Monday in Manhattan federal court, according to Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p>In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein sentenced Lemke to three years of supervised release.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<a>Department of Justice</a>'s decision not to issue mass prosecutions against
<a>Black Lives Matter</a> (BLM) and anti-fascist (Antifa) rioters involved in demonstrations in Portland, Oregon during summer 2020.
<p>Miller asked the court to compel discovery and grant an evidentiary hearing on his claim. In other words, he wanted additional time to explore his claim and then hold a court hearing to lay out his case of "selective prosecution."</p>
<p>However, Nichols denied Miller's request in a December 21 decision.</p>
<p>"There are obvious differences between those, like Miller, who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and those who rioted in the streets of Portland in the summer of 2020," Nichols wrote in his decision.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Nichols said that Miller had failed to point to any Portland case that was similar to his own.</p>
<a>Joe Biden</a> had chosen to selectively prosecute him for his conservative political beliefs while not prosecuting the BLM and Antifa protesters. However, Nichols said that Miller hadn't provided any evidence for his claim beyond "anecdotal evidence."
<a>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>. He also allegedly threatened to hunt down and hang the police officer who shot Ashli Babbitt, one of the rioters who was among the five individuals who died during the insurrection.
<p>In his defense, Miller claimed that his actions at the capitol were influenced by the baseless election fraud claims of former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>"I want to publicly apologize to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez and the Capitol police officers," <a>Miller told the court in January</a>. "I have always supported law enforcement and I am ashamed by my comments."</p>

<p>The whiff of cronyism or self-enrichment wasn't unprecedented. President <a>Bill Clinton</a> had equally pardoned 140 people as he left office, and his pardons also skewed in the direction of political cronies.</p>

<p>Lin-Manuel Miranda has once again addressed the complaints about colorism in his film, In The Heights.</p>
<p>The writer and broadway star faced backlash earlier this year when the movie about the New York City neighborhood was criticized for its lack of Afro-Latinx representation.</p>
<p>Although the Hamilton playwright addressed the complaints at the time, he has once again clarified his position on the situation and the challenges that come with creating his art.</p>
<p>"Once something has success, you're not the underdog trying to make it happen anymore," Miranda said in an interview with The New Yorker.</p>
<p>"Certainly, I have learned lessons from the reception of my work, good, bad, and indifferent," he said, adding: "You try to take all of it, and whatever sticks to your gut is what you bring with you to your next project."</p>
<p>In The Heights was released during the summer and despite positive reviews, the film's appearance was somewhat overshadowed by the conversation surrounding the demographics of the cast.</p>
<p>In July, Miranda said it was "unfair" to "put any kind of undue burden of representation on In the Heights."</p>
<p>Miranda's next project is a film for <a>Netflix</a> and his directorial debut, titled Tick, Tick... Boom!</p>
<p>The musical is an adaptation of Jonathan Larson's semi-autobiographical musical of the same name about an aspiring theatre composer experiencing a quarter-life crisis as he approaches 30.</p>
<p>"Working on Tick, Tick . . . Boom! was a wonderful place to live, reconnecting to that place of just getting it out of your head and onto the stage, and it being that simple," said of the project to The New Yorker.</p>
