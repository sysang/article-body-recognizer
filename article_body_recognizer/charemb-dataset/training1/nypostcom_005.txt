<h1> Microsoft’s $69B Activision-Blizzard deal sets stage for antitrust ‘soap opera’</h1>

<div> January 18, 2022 4:11pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 4:11pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>“This is going to be a soap opera,” Wedbush Securities managing director Dan Ives told The Post. “There’s going to be a lot of scrutiny.” </p>
<p>That environment has put Microsoft in a unique position among tech giants: It’s big enough to pony up $68.7 billion in cash, but low-key enough to have a chance of getting the deal past regulators.</p>
<p>“Microsoft knows there’s only one company that can do a deal like this,” Ives said, giving the deal a 75% to 80% chance of going through. </p>
<p>That uncertainty appeared to be reflected in Activision-Blizzard’s stock price, which stood was hovering around $82 on Tuesday afternoon — well short of the $95 per share Microsoft wants to pay for the company. </p>
<p>“That’s Activision hedging their bets,” he said. </p>
<p>Matt Stoller, an antitrust expert and activist and former staffer for Sen. Bernie Sanders, also said the high break-up fee means Microsoft and Activision-Blizzard are bracing for trouble. </p>
<p>Stoller compared the deal to Disney’s acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm and large parts of 21st Century Fox, which he argues have given the company a monopoly in the entertainment industry. </p>
<p>“Microsoft is trying to do to the gaming industry what Disney did to Hollywood,” Stoller told The Post. “It should be blocked.” </p>
<p>A potential antitrust case over the Activision deal would not be the first time Microsoft has been accused of building a monopoly. </p>

<h1> Peru beaches turn black after oil spill blamed on Tonga eruption</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 1:07pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 1:08pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>The ministry supervised cleaning of the area in the coastal district of Ventanilla, where the spill happened on Sunday during unloading of crude oil from the ship to supply the La Pampilla refinery, owned by the Spanish company Repsol.</p>
<p>“It is unfortunate. I am seeing that there is a serious impact on the coastal marine area. Initially two and a half kilometers (of damage) were reported, but now we see that it has affected two beaches,” Ramirez told reporters.</p>
<p>The Pampilla refinery said in a statement that “the violence of the waves” on Saturday due to the eruption of the volcano generated the “limited spill” of oil at a time when a ship was unloading.</p>
<p>An undersea volcano off Tonga erupted on Saturday, prompting tsunami warnings and evacuation orders in Japan and causing huge waves on several islands and regions in the South Pacific.</p>

<h1> Husband cooked ‘hormone food’ for his infertile wife — and now she’s pregnant</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 1:13pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 1:13pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A loving husband has taken the internet by storm after his wife shared a video of him cooking healthy meals to help with infertility — and now she’s expecting.</p>
<p>Rach Sullivan uploaded the heartwarming clip on social media with the caption: ”no words for this man”.</p>
<p>In the video, which has had over 1.6 million likes, Rach explained the couple found out she could have an issue that affects her fertility.</p>
<p>Desperate to have kids, her husband Tom did some research on foods that could help her hormones — and he even started an Instagram account to document the journey.</p>
<p>”When the only doctor recommendation we were given was to go on birth control, we turned to food as medicine,” she told.</p>
<p>According to Rach, Tom even as a chart on their fridge that he uses to grocery shop with and has a list of all the ingredients that sync with the different phases of her menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>”It’s actually adorable.</p>
<p>”Every week he comes up with different fun ways to combine the ingredients.”</p>
<p>Since posting the video in October, the couple is now expecting a miracle baby.</p>
<p>Now, instead of hearty meals for balancing hormones, Tom prepares dishes with foods that are the same size as their baby — when the baby was the size of a peach, the husband whipped up a delicious peach crumble with ice cream.</p>
<p>Some viewers speculated it could be a girl as the two could often be seen indulging in sweets.</p>
<p>”This is the most wholesome content on the whole internet,” one viewer wrote.</p>
<p>”These people deserve the WORLD.</p>
<p>”i love them so much.”</p>
<p>A fan added: ”It’s the fact that I come here every week to see that bump and food.”</p>
<p>”Y’all are so precious! I love the way you love each other. ❤️” someone else agreed.</p>

<h1> I’m a relationship expert – here’s why you and your partner always argue</h1>
<div> January 18, 2022 3:54pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 3:54pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A relationship expert has revealed the real reasons you and your partner may be constantly arguing.</p>
<p>Couples coach Erica Wright believes the reason you are fighting isn’t because of small tasks such as doing the dishes or your partner not texting you back on time.</p>
<p>Her video, which went viral on TikTok with over 900k views and over 100k likes, is captioned “What are you actually fighting about?” and explains the three hidden dynamics couples tend to fight over.</p>
<p>Erica said it can often be misinterpreted as arguing over surface-level things, such as not helping with household chores but explained these often have a deeper meaning to them.</p>
<p>Erica says that the big reaction is actually because of these three deeper emotions.</p>
<p>She explained the first underlying dynamic is about power and control, which may sound like ‘you always undermine me in front of the kid’ or ‘you need to unload the dishwasher my way because that’s the right way’.</p>
<p>The second underlying cause for arguing is respect and recognition, and Erica provided examples such as ‘you always make plans without even asking me first’ or ‘do you even realize how much I’m doing around the house?’</p>
<p>The third reason is being caring and closeness and this may sound like ‘why am I the only one to text?’</p>
<p>“Similarly, if your partner makes plans with friends every week but doesn’t show much interest in planning a special date night with you, that can trigger insecurity or feeling like they’re not really that interested in you.</p>
<p>“When these patterns happen again and again it creates a lens through which we observe our partner and our relationship.</p>
<p>“If we think our partner doesn’t care about us all, every interaction is seen as if we are wearing sunglasses,” Erica explained.</p>
<p>She said on the flip side that if you feel your partner does love you, you will interpret every interaction through that lens.</p>
<p>Users were grateful for Erica’s insight, one wrote: “Wow I can so relate to this, very eye-opening and you completely nailed it.”</p>
<p>Other users asked Erica how to address these issues in their relationship, one queried; “How can you go about talking about this with them though? I don’t want it to sound like blaming.</p>
<p>Erica explained that how you communicate these issues is important and making sure your partner is open to having a conversation about improving things.</p>

<h1> California town resorts to lasers to stop 1,000 pooping crows</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 18, 2022 5:49pm <div> Updated <div> January 18, 2022 6:23pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>A suburban California town has become the site of a bizarre phenomenon in which Alfred Hitchcock would delight — and would revile ornithophobia sufferers.</p>
<p>Over the past decades, Sunnyvale, a Silicon Valley town in northern California, has become the top destination for crows to roost — and it’s got to stop, Mayor Larry Klein has said.</p>
<p>“The streets are basically riddled with crow poo,” he told the New<a> York Times</a>. The 23-square-mile community of Sunnyvale sees its roughly 1,000 crow residents wreak havoc nightly, only to disappear in daylight. </p>
<p>“I’ll go inside unless I’m under an umbrella,” local Frank Hampton <a>told CNN</a>. “The city has tried everything to get the birds to find a new spot, but all success has been short lived.”</p>
<p>In a plan loosely based on science, three city workers are being charged with nightly crow watch, in which they spend an hour beaming lasers and blaring sounds into the skies in hopes of disorienting and discouraging the birds from nesting.</p>
<p>Rochester, New York, <a>tried a similar approach</a> between 2017 and 2018 in hopes of displacing some 20,000 to 30,000 birds — to <a>some success</a>.</p>

<h1> Kanye West: home across from Kim Kardashian will bring him ‘solace’</h1>
<div> January 14, 2022 5:49pm <div> Updated <div> January 14, 2022 9:57pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Kanye West is opening up about the all the drama that surfaced when he purchased a home across the street from his estranged wife, Kim Kardashian. </p>
<p>While their divorce has yet to be finalized, Kardashian, 41, filed to be “legally single” last month, stating her marriage is “irretrievably” broken. </p>
<p>A few weeks later, it was revealed that West, 44, purchased a $4.5 million teardown directly adjacent to the home he had designed and built with Kardashian. She bought the home from West in a <a>$23 million buyout.</a> </p>
<p>Now West has confirmed that he needed a home that was close to his children. </p>
<a>Hollywood Unlocked’s</a> Jason Lee. “[It was] flipped into there was something wrong with me getting a house next to my kids.”
<p>“You see when my mom took me from Atlanta to Chicago, my dad didn’t come to the coldest and most dangerous city in the world to be next to [me],” West added. “He said, ‘I’m going to stay down in Atlanta.'”</p>
<p>A source previously told The Post that it all came down to “logistics” so that he “has access to them at the drop of a hat.” </p>
<p>But Kardashian’s divorce lawyer Laura Wasser <a>told Page Six</a> it was “news to us” that the children were being kept from West.</p>
<p>Located in the Hidden Hills, the five-bedroom, four-bathroom home is outdated, with shaggy beige carpets and vintage wood paneling. </p>
<p>West was lucky with the timing as this was the first time the former owners had put the home and land up for sale in 67 years. </p>
<p>The “Donda” rapper was so desperate for the land, he offered $421,000 more than the seller’s asking price. </p>
<p>West recently shelled out a whopping $57.3 million for an <a>oceanfront Malibu estate. </a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, West is also hoping to <a>unload one of two of his Wyoming ranches</a>, which he listed for sale for $11 million in October. </p>

<h1> Escape from NYC with your very own private island, just 30 minutes away</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 2:03pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 5:39pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>You can now buy your very own private island just 30 minutes from Manhattan — if you have $4.9 million to burn.</p>
<p>Located in the upscale New Rochelle community known as Premium Point, the Mediterranean-style waterfront estate on Oak Island spans a colossal 7,800 square feet on nearly three-quarters of an acre of property.</p>
<p>Modeled after an Italian villa, it boasts six bedrooms, six bathrooms and a pool, as well as access to a private beach and boathouse, not to mention 24/7 security.</p>
<p>For easy accessibility, the island is connected to the mainland by a 50-foot-long concrete bridge, erected when the house was constructed in 1917.</p>
<p>The current owners have updated the residence to include a two-story addition complete with wine room and terrace with a built-in fireplace overlooking the water.</p>
<p>The estate offers views of Long Island Sound and Premium Mill Pond and is one of some 60 islands that dot the shores of Westchester County.</p>
<p>“You’re on the cusp of New Rochelle, which is bustling, but also the quaint village of Larchmont,” Margaret Grasso of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices told Realtor.com. “You have the best of both worlds.”</p>
<p>The exclusive gated yachting community of Premium Point, founded in 1882, hearkens back to the Gilded Age. Back then, New Rochelle was known as “Queen City of the Sound” and a popular summer destination for the wealthy. </p>
<a>sued the community’s board over maintenance fees</a>, which at the time cost as much as $30,000, alleging the board made “secret agreements” with select owners.
<div> <div> <div> 1 of 7</div> </div> </div>
<a>available to purchase for $13 million</a>, and the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Massaro House and 10-acre Petre Island near Lake Mahopac in Carmel, NY, 
<a>was listed for $12.9 million</a>.

<h1> Gisele Bundchen was ‘super helpful’ with Tom Brady’s new apparel line</h1>
<div> January 13, 2022 5:38pm <div> Updated <div> January 13, 2022 5:39pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>Tom Brady launched a new apparel line — dubbed “Brady,” of course — and his wife, fashion mogul Gisele Bundchen, helped him out with it.</p>
<p>“[I’m] very involved, and I love doing it,” Brady said on “Good Morning America”. “I just kind of love fashion and apparel. I just want to be as hands-on as possible.”</p>
<p>Brady was asked if it’s true that he is more into fashion than his supermodel wife, and punted on the answer a bit — while paying her compliments.</p>
<p>The legendary quarterback added that Gisele has been “super helpful” to him with his fashion line.</p>
<p>“She’s super helpful,” Brady said. “Like I said, she has great tastes and great sensibility too.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Brady was asked about his look at the 2018 Met Gala, where he dressed similar to a prince.</p>
<p>“I kind of liked that look, he said. “It’s the Met Gala for a reason. I think you can go out on the edge for moments like that. </p>
<p>“So, typically I kind of stick to more conservative looks. That one I went for a little bit. Some people loved it.”</p>

<h1> ‘Billion-year-old’ black diamond, blasted from outer space, could fetch $6.8M</h1>
<div> <div> <div> <header> </header> <div> <div> <p> Thanks for contacting us. We've received your submission.</p> Back to Reading </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> January 17, 2022 2:37pm <div> Updated <div> January 17, 2022 3:03pm </div> </div> </div>
<p>An out-of-this-world — literally — black diamond will go to the highest bidder at Sotheby’s next month. </p>
<p>Black diamonds like this one, also called carbonados, are formed out of a meteoric impact to Earth, forged out of the blast or deriving from the asteroid itself, Sotheby’s shared in a statement.</p>
<p>The 1-billion-year-old diamond is expected to fetch at least $6.8 million when it hits the online block, where it will be up for bidding from Feb. 3 to Feb. 9. Sotheby’s will accept cryptocurrency as payment — as well as cold hard cash.</p>
<p>The House of Gübelin in Switzerland and the Gemological Institute of America both have declared it the largest known of its kind, and it was first listed by Guinness World Records in 2006.</p>
<p>In keeping with its numeric theme, the 555.55-carat jewel was also cut with 55 facets, a technical feat for one of the toughest diamonds in existence, according to Sotheby’s.</p>
<a>told the Associated Press</a>. Khamsa in Arabic means five, “so there’s a nice theme of the number five running throughout the diamond.”
<p>The diamond had previously belonged to an anonymous owner, said Binani, though it’s not exactly clear where or how it came into existence. </p>
<p>“Its sale represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to acquire one of the rarest, billion-year-old cosmic wonders known to humankind,” she said. </p>
<h1> Your Android has six ‘secret codes’ that unlock hidden features</h1>
<div> January 15, 2022 11:02am <div> Updated <div> January 15, 2022 11:02am </div> </div> </div>
<p>You might not know this, but your Android device has several helpful features you can access via secret codes.</p>
<p>Some codes are specific to certain models, but other, more generic codes can be accessed on nearly any Android device.</p>
<p>These codes usually begin with “*#” and have long been used on mobile phones to access interesting hidden apps and settings.</p>
<p>Here are six codes worth knowing for your Android device, however it’s important to note that not all codes may work, and some may alter the functionality of your device.</p>
<h2>How to access Android IMEI</h2>
<p>Your International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number is the unique number associated with your smartphone.</p>
<p>Sometimes you can be asked for this if you want to unlock an Android to use another network.</p>
<p>To find your IMEI number, go to your dial pad and enter *#06#.</p>
<p>The number should just appear on your screen. </p>
<h2>How to view Google Play diagnostics</h2>
<p>There is a code you can input into your Android device to reveal your Google Play Services info or Firebase Cloud Messaging diagnostics.</p>
