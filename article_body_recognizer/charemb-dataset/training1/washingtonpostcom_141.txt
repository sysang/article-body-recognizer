<div><h1>2021 brought a wave of extreme weather disasters. Scientists say worse lies ahead.</h1></div>
<h2>“The weather of the past will not be the weather of the future," says a NOAA scientist. “As long as we are emitting greenhouse gases at a historically unprecedented rate, we should expect this change to continue."</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div>By Sarah Kaplan</div> and</span></div><div><span><div>Brady Dennis</div></span></div></span></div><div>December 17, 2021 at 1:18 p.m. EST</div></div>
<p>Record-shattering heat waves, devastating floods, scorching wildfires and persistent droughts are among the litany of catastrophes scientists say they can definitively link to human activities — primarily the burning of fossil fuels.</p>
<div><div><p>The world must find a way to cope with this new era of climate disasters, researchers warn. Because without major changes, the forecast will grow only worse with time.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Nearly 1 in 3 Americans experienced a weather disaster this summer</p></div>
<div><div><p>It did not take long for the project to yield <a>evidence of a transformed planet</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The intensity of these events was beyond anything that existed in a preindustrial world.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A rapid analysis conducted shortly after the event found that the heat wave would have been “virtually impossible” without human influence.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“People are suffering and dying unnecessarily,” said Kristie Ebi, director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington in Seattle and a contributor to the heat wave study.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Cassandra Rogers, a climate scientist at Washington State University, showed that the number of days per year with multiple major heat waves has spiked from about 20 in the early 1980s to roughly 150 now.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Almost every day from June through September has two or more heat waves happening around the world,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Floods, flames and heat: Images of this year’s extreme weather</p></div>
<div><div><p>With each incremental increase in temperature, climate change turbocharges Earth’s naturally-occurring processes.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As the atmosphere traps more heat, the ocean soaks up that energy and transforms it into fuel for hurricanes. High temperatures cause water to evaporate from vegetation and soil, amplifying drought.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Warmer air can also hold more moisture, so that the rain that finally does fall comes in a deluge. Fires burn hotter in this world. Floods are faster, wetter, bigger.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Changing the amount of heat in the Earth system also changes how that heat gets distributed, Lozier added. Wind patterns and ocean currents are shifting. Monsoonal rains may come late, or not at all.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Every weather event is now indelibly marked by the fact that it’s happening in a warming world, Herring said. But that doesn’t mean the effect of climate change is always clear.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But there is no doubt that the world is not done changing. The ongoing burning of fossil fuels is continuing to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and further heat the planet.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Humans have pushed the climate into ‘unprecedented’ territory, landmark report finds</p></div>
<a> roughly once every 75 years</a>. At 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels,
<a>more than 10 million additional people </a>would be exposed to flooding from sea level rise. By 3 degrees, heat waves that once had a 2 percent chance of happening in a given year will become 27 times more likely.
<div><div><p>That, Seneviratne said, is why it is imperative that humans find a way to cut emissions as quickly as possible.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Even a tenth of a degree can make a difference,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But if recent catastrophes have not been enough to motivate action on the scale that is needed, Lozier wonders what will finally push people to transform the way they live, travel and grow food.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“How much worse does this have to get?” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>At COP26, nations speed climate action but leave world still headed for dangerous warming</p></div>
<div><div><p>For Mayor Jan Polderman, as for many people in the British Columbia town of Lytton, the cost of climate change could not be more clear.</p></div></div>
<a>fast-moving wildfire tore through the area</a>, devouring scores of homes and displacing residents who had hastily fled the flames.
<div><div><p>More recently, as many residents remain scattered and await the chance to rebuild, flooding and brought on by torrential rain last month washed out main roads to the north and south of Lytton, Polderman said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“A lot of people are very fragile at the moment,” the 62-year-old mayor said. “It’s been a very tough year.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Polderman spends a lot of time these days thinking about how the town can build back in a more resilient way, one that takes into account the prospect of hotter temperatures, longer droughts, more wildfires and heavier rain events.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“We need to plan for that, so we can live through it,” he said.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>wildfire consume the homes of friends and neighbors and biblical weather batter his province, all in the past year.
<p>“I used to think that it was going to be the next generation that was going to have to deal with climate change. I think otherwise now,” Polderman said. “It’s something we better start dealing with sooner than later.”</p>

<div><div><p>FESSENHEIM, France — When President Emmanuel Macron announced the revival of nuclear energy in an address to the nation last month, residents of a small town in eastern France initially thought they had misheard him.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For the first time in decades,” Macron said in the televised speech, France “will relaunch the construction of nuclear reactors.”</p></div></div>
<a>it is first </a>in the world in its reliance on nuclear energy. A prior plan to reduce that reliance, so that no more than half of France’s electricity comes from nuclear power by 2035, is in doubt.
<a>pushing</a> the European Union to add modern nuclear energy to a list of “
<a>environmentally sustainable economic activities</a>.”
<a>more than 2,000 jobs</a> — may get a second chance. “We don’t want to be the sacrificed and forgotten ones,” said Mayor Claude Bender, who welcomed Macron’s speech as a “positive surprise.”
<a>urged Macron</a> to consider Fessenheim as a possible future site, calling the old plant’s closure a “financial,” “social” and “economic” scandal in the face of a warming climate.
<div><div><p>But one of the biggest obstacles — for Fessenheim and for Macron’s broader plans — lies about half a mile to the east of the town’s old nuclear plant. That’s where France ends and Germany begins.</p></div></div>
<a>2011 Fukushima meltdown</a> in Japan. And Berlin points to reports like one this past week, of
<a>cracks in the pipes at a French nuclear reactor</a>, as evidence that plant safety remains a problem.
<a>fiercely oppose</a> a climate-friendly designation for nuclear power, which would signal to green investors that nuclear energy is worthy of financing.
<div><div><p>The controversy may come to a head within days, with the European Commission expected to make a decision just before its Christmas break.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The saga of Fessenheim</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Perhaps no place symbolizes European divisions on nuclear energy more than Fessenheim.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The 1,800-megawatt nuclear power station here was built in the 1970s — a gigantic white block with two towering reactor-containment buildings, rising from behind a forest outside the town.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At its peak, Fessenheim “had everything,” said resident Laurent Schwein, who noted that his family’s restaurant had to be repeatedly expanded to accommodate the surge in residents and visitors.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Schwein said locals weren’t concerned about the power plant’s safety — even <a>its location</a> near <a>earthquake-prone seismic faults.</a></p></div></div>
<a>promised to close Fessenheim</a> if he were elected.
<div><div><p>“A part of ourselves was taken away from us,” the mayor said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The environment question</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Like many nuclear advocates in France, Bender argues that Germany’s anti-nuclear stance and continued reliance on fossil fuels are at odds with its self-image as a leader on climate.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Germany is largely responsible for an air pollution death toll that amounts to “multiple Chernobyls every year,” he said.</p></div></div>
<a>raze villages to make way for coal mines</a>.
<div><div><p>Macron’s government, meanwhile, says that sticking with nuclear power will help France meet its commitment to be carbon-neutral by 2050 — and is preferable to a continued reliance on fossil fuels.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If we look at it from the carbon perspective, nuclear is one of the best in class,” said Alexandre Danthine, a senior associate with Aurora Energy Research.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Environmental activists in Germany acknowledge that continued reliance on coal is a problem even in the medium term. But they are optimistic about how quickly the country can ramp up alternative energy.</p></div></div>
<a>80 percent of electricity</a> by 2030, up from the present target of about 50 percent.
<div><div><p>German anti-nuclear and environmental activist Stefan Auchter said his country’s path will be validated when the next Chernobyl or Fukushima comes. He compared the use of nuclear energy to playing Russian roulette.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Who would really believe that we can get this done without a mistake, when we can’t even build an airport?” he said, referring to Berlin’s new airport, which opened nine years behind schedule.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>An industry in celebratory mood</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>But a new generation of cheaper, safer and smaller nuclear reactors — known as small modular reactors, or SMRs — is reawakening interest in parts of Europe, in the United States and elsewhere.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“The terms of the conversation around nuclear energy in Europe are changing,” E.U. Energy Commissioner <a>Kadri Simson</a> said in a speech in November.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>France’s export hopes largely rest on those small models, which would compete with SMRs being developed by the United States, Britain and Canada.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the town of Breisach, on the German side of the border near Fessenheim, Mayor Oliver Rein is still skeptical.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When a vegan business wants to settle, it probably won’t move next to a slaughterhouse,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Still, some in Fessenheim sense that the next nuclear era may not play out in their town.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“With the pressure from the Germans, it’ll be difficult,” said Jean-Yves Tretz, 63, a retired plant worker.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Claude Ledergerber, a French anti-nuclear activist who is part of the plant’s control commission, said reactivation is technologically “no longer possible.” Too many elements have been removed, he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Playing a round of Pétanque, a French outdoor bowling game, restaurant owner Schwein said he is prepared for the last workers to leave the plant when decommissioning has been completed in the coming years.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>He has installed solar panels.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p><a>Germany portrays itself as a climate leader. But it’s still razing villages for coal mines.</a></p></div></div>

<h2>The legislation included hundreds of billions for electric-vehicle charging stations, as well as tax credits for wind and solar projects</h2>

<div><div><p>In a separate statement Sunday, Manchin countered, “The energy transition my colleagues seek is already well underway in the United States of America."</p></div></div>
<div><p>Left-leaning environmentalists blamed Manchin for walking away from negotiations. But they also directed their criticism toward Biden and Democratic leaders, who they said had allowed a single senator to hold major legislation hostage.</p></div>

<div><p>Other measures would have made it easier to build transmission lines, purchase electric vehicles and expand clean-energy infrastructure. A “green bank” would have made it simpler for a variety of firms to obtain financing.</p></div>

<div><div><p>Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) called on lawmakers not to give up on their efforts to address global warming, despite the fact that Manchin’s support remains critical in the 50-50 Senate.</p></div></div>

<div><p>The Biden administration finalized a rule Monday to cut climate pollutants from new cars and light trucks, which will keep billions of tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere and change the kinds of vehicles Americans drive.</p></div>

<div><div><p>ST. CROIX, U.S. Virgin Islands — The idle Limetree Bay refinery on this tropical Caribbean island doesn’t look like much of a prize.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bryan did not respond to requests for comment.</p></div></div>
<p>Describing the refinery’s troubled history during Tuesday’s sale hearing, Michael O’Hara — who co-leads Jefferies’ U.S. restructuring group — remarked, “It’s a tough asset. No way around it.”</p>
<div><div><p>The decisions Jones made<b> </b>more than 2,000 miles away in Houston will affect businesses and residents across this Caribbean island.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But he experienced many of the ills that others complained about.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Even people who benefit greatly from the refinery are concerned about it reopening.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The island where it rained oil</p></div>
<div><div><p>Phyllis Blackman, president of the Williams Delight Homeowners Association in Frederiksted, said she constantly hears about lingering contamination and other problems from some of her association’s 11,000 members.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“They all complain to me,” said Blackman, who had oil on her roof and in her cistern at one point.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Blackman had two daughters working at the plant before it shut down. One of them, Shakiema Hutchinson, remarked that when it came to the refinery, “They closed it down, and we’re back to zero again, with no work."</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Frandelle Gerard, executive director of Crucian Heritage and Nature Tourism, helped conduct <a>a community survey</a> with Bennington College and local nonprofits to gauge the refinery’s health impacts.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Residents are still seeking information about what happened, Gerard said, and the government has failed to publicly issue a health report.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We had people passing out and children throwing up. What all were people breathing? What was in the air?" Gerard said. "We don’t know. There’s still a lot of questions.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Tracking Biden's environmental policies</p></div>
<div><div><p>The family of Matthew Austrie is among those still searching for answers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>On May 8, he was sitting on his bed with his head in his hands when his daughter looked in the room. “What’s wrong with you?” his daughter Valda asked. “My head hurts,” he replied.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Three days later, Austrie, 83, started to vomit. Ten days later, he suffered a massive stroke. Within six weeks, he was dead.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>How and why the healthy-looking Austrie suddenly became ill is unclear. On the day he first felt sick, he had gone about his daily eight-hour routine, puttering around the garden of a second house he owned near the refinery.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As she recounted her father’s last days, Valda Austrie,<b> </b>50, wept. “He was fine all the time,” she said. “I just want my daddy back.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I don’t know what to think about it,” she said. “I didn’t want to go to a lawyer and relive everything, so I leave it in the hands of God.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Others tout the refinery as the best available path to salvation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The closing of the refinery so worried Gregory Hodge, an island native and musician who goes by the name DJ Avalanche, that he recorded <a>a rap song</a> to describe the financial hardship that would await residents.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“No more money from Limetree, the money man ‘dem pockets, they empty,” says “The Limetree Song (Eh Ruff).”</p></div></div>
<div><p>A large company such as Limetree, Hodge said, “should be able to address all the environmental concerns” while remaining open. "At the end of the day, financially, we have to find a way to keep going out here.”</p></div>
<div><div><p>St. Croix Energy founding partner Yohana Manning said he and his fellow investors — whom he wouldn’t disclose — are seeking to bring back jobs to the community.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We’re tired of asking people for things. We just want to work for what is ours," Manning said. “We want to save this refinery at all costs.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Bay Ltd., which had hoped to buy the plant and scrap it, also filed <a>an objection</a> to the sale.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Manning said he hoped federal officials would not delay the refinery’s revival.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“If Administrator Michael Regan is listening, we come in peace,” Manning said, before adding, “We also have some good lawyers, too.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s like a ticking time bomb,” she said, “that they’re waiting to see when it’s going to explode.”</p></div></div>

<p>CIUDAD OBREGÓN, Mexico — In the foothills of the Sierra Madre mountains, the carcasses of starving cattle rotted in a bone-dry reservoir. Useless fishing nets hung on dusty fences. Rowboats were stranded in the sand.</p>
<p>Down on the valley floor, Rafael Parra bent to the work of feeding the world — and unintentionally warming it.</p>
<p>A layer of chalk-white fertilizer had been scattered on the barren ground. Tractors had cut long furrows in the dry and crumbling soil. The wheat seeds would not be planted for days, but it was time to release the laughing gas.</p>
<p>“That’s all there is to it,” he said.</p>
<p>Last year, atmospheric concentrations of nitrous oxide showed a record-high increase, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<b> </b>fertilizing before planting in vulnerable areas
<b> </b>— a common practice in the valley.
<p>Over decades working in the valley, the soft-spoken scientist developed an intimate knowledge of the financial and cultural pressures that encourage wheat farmers to apply too much fertilizer — even when they could save money and pollute less.</p>
<p>“For the farmer, the cost of fertilizing too much is less than the cost of fertilizing too little,” Ortiz-Monasterio said. “That’s because they are not taking into account the environmental cost.”</p>
<b> </b>such as Brazil, India, China and Mexico — is a central driver accelerating the nitrous oxide emissions that contribute to climate change.
<p>“It’s just the ultimate story of unintended consequences,” said Marci Baranski, an expert on greenhouse gas emissions and author of a forthcoming book about Borlaug and the green revolution.</p>
<h3>‘Something big is pouring out of that bay’</h3>
<p>Ortiz-Monasterio now works out of a building on one of the city’s main thoroughfares: Boulevard Dr. Norman E. Borlaug. His office at CIMMYT is fronted by a bronze statue of Borlaug standing amid sprigs of wheat.</p>
<p>“The big pulses of nitrogen follow that perfect condition, where there’s no plants taking nitrogen up, there’s lots of it available in the soil, and microorganisms are using it for their own energy sources,” Matson said.</p>
<p>This part of the ocean has naturally low levels of nitrogen, Beman said, so bursts from the farmlands are having an outsize impact.</p>
<p>“It sure as heck looks like something big is pouring out of that bay,” he said.</p>
<div><div><p>A village is surrounded by wheat fields in the Yaqui Valley. After irrigation or rains, runoff flows from the fields through a network of drains into the Sea of Cortez. </p></div></div>
<div><div><p>An irrigation canal provides water to the fields around the Yaqui Valley. The valley spans a half-million acres amid a network of irrigation canals connected to three reservoirs.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>When the nitrogen-rich runoff from wheat fields reaches the Sea of Cortez, algae blooms spread through the water. A satellite image from November provided by Planet Labs PBC shows the green hues from chlorophyll in the algae. </p></div></div>
<p>This proliferation of phytoplankton can drive down oxygen levels in the water creating “dead zones” where sea life cannot survive.</p>
<p>“If you only measure it from the fields, you’re only getting part of the story,” said Keith Smith, an expert on nitrous oxide at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>“I remember when I was 10 years old, the boats would come back with 200 kilos of shrimp. Now, they’re getting 10 or 20 kilos in a day.”</p>
<h3>An exponential rise in emissions</h3>
<div><p>The discrepancy between Mexico's reported nitrous oxide emissions and what's in the atmosphere</p></div>
<p>The country’s emissions could be up to 4.6 times higher than what it has acknowledged in the past, according to a study done by Philippe Ciais of France’s Laboratory of Climate and Environmental Sciences, along with several colleagues.</p>
<p>Mexico’s Agriculture Ministry acknowledged its numbers probably are an undercount.</p>
<p>He said more nuanced calculations, involving fertilizer dose and farmland surface area, were used in a 2019 government estimate. But in that update, the country’s reported emissions only rose by approximately 4 percent.</p>
<p>As for why some analyses produce much higher emissions totals, León Zaragoza noted, “nonlinear modeling yields emission data higher than linear ones.”</p>
<p>Ortiz-Monasterio’s research helps explain some of the disparity. In a 2018 paper, he and several colleagues documented that when doses of fertilizer are increased, nitrous oxide emissions begin to rise along an exponential curve.</p>
<p>“As long as you’re applying under what the crop needs, the emissions are mild,” he said. “It really jumps up once you start applying more than the crop needs.”</p>
<p>The warming climate makes things worse. Hotter temperatures, especially during the non-growing season, accelerate the microbes producing nitrous oxide. Drought conditions can also stunt plant growth leaving more fertilizer unused.</p>
<p>“If you use just a global default emissions factor everywhere, you will underestimate the [nitrous oxide] emission, especially in areas where there is very intense nitrogen fertilizer usage,” Thompson said.</p>
<p>These results help explain the rapidly increasing concentration of nitrous oxide that has been measured in the atmosphere in recent years.</p>
<h3>‘Low fertilizer, low production’</h3>
<p>“There isn’t money for a GPS,” he said.</p>
<p>The quantity that the workers applied amounted to 200 kilos of nitrogen per hectare — more than CIMMYT researchers considered advisable in a year. And this was just the first fertilization of the season.</p>
<p>“Many of our partners, because of the insecurity that we’re living through right now, prefer to do all the fertilizing before planting,” Rochin said.</p>
<p>“For the environment, it would be less harmful, but yield would be very low,” he said. “Low fertilizer, low production.”</p>
<p>“These are better than the varieties we have,” said Alberto Borbón-Gracia, a government researcher. “And by a lot.”</p>
<b> </b>nitrogen that might otherwise be lost, were phased out.
<p>During the wheat testing event, Juan Manuel Cortés-Jiménez helped record the results. He has watched farmers struggle to adapt to a changing climate over the past 37 years as an investigator with Mexico’s Agriculture Ministry.</p>
<p>He bristled at the notion that Mexican farmers could be blamed for emissions when major emitters are not fixing the problem, or when leaders such as former U.S. president Donald Trump are dismissing climate change entirely.</p>
<h3>The next generation of farmers</h3>
<p>Now, only a handful of farmers still use the sensor. In the offices of one farming association, its GreenSeeker is stored next to the toilets, an unused relic.</p>
<p>“It sounds incredible, but it’s true,” said Bours, the farming association president. “A program that could help the producer save a lot and we’re not taking advantage of it.”</p>
<p>“As one farmer told me, ‘I put on 180 units of nitrogen as fertilizer,’ ” Ortiz-Monasterio said. “ ‘And later, I added 60 more as a tranquilizer.’ ”</p>
<p>“Do you smell that?” Amaya asked. “That’s chicken dung.”</p>
<p>“After working all these years trying to transfer this one technology, that’s when I realized that we need policy,” said Ortiz-Monasterio. “If we really want to make a change, we need policy.”</p>
<p>Instead of subsidies or regulation, León Zaragoza said that federal funding supports CIMMYT and other organizations so they can try to convince farmers to adopt the sensors, drones and other technology for more efficient nitrogen use.</p>
<p>And so Ortiz-Monasterio will continue to spread the gospel of efficient nitrogen. His goal is not a fertilizer ban, but rather better management: applied in the right amount, at the right time, so the plant gets what it needs and not more.</p>
<p>He hopes he’ll find the next generation more attuned to the contamination in the water supply, the algae in the Sea of Cortez and the invisible dangers of nitrous oxide.</p>

<div><p>Thomas E. Lovejoy III, an ecologist who dedicated his career to preserving the Amazon rainforest and educating Washington policymakers and the public about the dangers of climate change, died Dec. 25 at his home in McLean, Va. He was 80.</p></div>
<div><div><p>His daughter Elizabeth Lovejoy said he died of pancreatic cancer.</p></div></div>
<p>Thomas Eugene Lovejoy was born in New York City on Aug. 22, 1941. He was an only child and grew up in a privileged setting on the Upper East Side. Both his father and grandfather had been chief executives of the Manhattan Life Insurance Co.</p>
<div><div><p>He received a bachelor’s degree in biology in 1964 from Yale University and stayed at Yale to complete his PhD, also in biology, in 1971.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The solution to climate change that has nothing to do with cars or coal</p></div>
<p>Former senator Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.), president emeritus of the United Nations Foundation, was a close friend who traveled with Dr. Lovejoy to the Arctic and the South Pole, rafted through the Grand Canyon and explored deep into the Amazon.</p>
<div><div><p>“He was incredibly warm and mischievous, as well as being a first-rate scientist,” Wirth said in an interview. “Nobody more fun to be with.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Serge-suited goons followed us all over the Amazon, sweating like crazy,” Wirth said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He used to say, ‘Don’t tell me that every time I squirt an underarm deodorant it’s going to penetrate the ozone layer,’ ” Quinn recalled.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But after his visit to the Amazon in 1988 with Dr. Lovejoy — and laughing about the infamous candiru, an Amazonian fish supposedly capable of swimming up a man’s urethra — Bradlee returned a convert.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He said, ‘Well, I guess I’ve become a f---ing tree hugger,’ ” Quinn said. Bradlee assigned “somebody to cover the environment and he got with the program.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As for Dr. Lovejoy, Quinn described him as a Renaissance man, knowledgeable about politics, literature, food and wine, in addition to science.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Everybody loved him, he was so aptly named,” she said. “He was really lovely, he was a wonderful person, and joyous.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>While Kerry is looking ahead, climate experts are trying to figure out how to create a more complete picture of<b> </b>where the world is now.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Romany Webb, an associate research scholar at Columbia Law School, said “a lot of people are talking about the difference between reported emissions and real ones.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Moreover, if a country’s national climate target has inaccurate information about where its emissions are coming from, “you may end up targeting some of the wrong sources,” Webb said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Those are two key gaps that still remain, and that we need to continue to refine,” Fransen said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Kerry said at Glasgow there was a “big debate” about how frequently countries’ emissions plans — known as nationally determined contributions — should be reviewed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But for now, serious gaps in knowledge remain.</p></div></div>
<p>“We still are in a situation where there are major countries that haven’t reported emissions in a decade,” Fransen said. “That’s not a good situation to be in. Fortunately, that will not be the case anymore.”</p>
<div><div><p>Starting in 2024, every nation is expected to begin reporting emissions every two years, though countries that lack capacity or expertise can still seek more flexibility.</p></div></div>
<p>In Glasgow, negotiators hashed out the highly technical but important details to create “uniform” reporting requirements — essentially, ensuring that countries begin to detail their emissions in predictable and comparable ways.</p>
<div><div><p>Those policies need time.</p></div></div>
<a>blah, blah, blah</a>?” asked Jason Bordoff, head of Columbia University’s center for global energy policy. “It was both.” Real points of progress were made on trading carbon credits and slashing methane emissions, he said.
<div><div><p>But, he added, “if you had a longer runway to where we need to go, that would be encouraging.”</p></div></div>

<h1>Militaries are among the world’s biggest emitters. This general wants them to go green.</h1>
<h2>Richard Nugee, a three-star general, knew armed forces must adapt to a warming world. So one of the most senior officers in the British army asked for a new job: Drawing up a climate change strategy for the military.</h2>

<p>GLASGOW, Scotland — It was July 2003, and Richard Nugee, a British army officer, was baking inside the sweltering brick building that Saddam Hussein’s sons used as a smuggler’s hideout.</p>

<b> </b>he had a big problem. His troops were drinking so much water that they were flushing away their vitamins. It was nearly too scorching to fight. And he was getting a lesson that extreme weather could be as dangerous to soldiers as any insurgent.
<p>“Anybody who ignores it would be foolish,” he said.</p>
<p>Nugee said his challenge was to explain to skeptical defense officials that addressing climate change improves military effectiveness, rather than sapping it.</p>
<p>But it was his post-2001 deployments that helped drive his belief that adapting the military to climate change would improve its ability to do its core job.</p>
<p>Yet environmental activists have often focused elsewhere, most typically on places where governments are obligated to be fully transparent about the environmental impact of their activities.</p>
<p>It warns that if the rest of society switches away from fossil fuels for cars and electricity, militaries can’t risk being the last ones who are reliant on them.</p>
<p>“If you want to be climate neutral in 2050, this sector can no longer be left off the hook,” said van Schaik, the Dutch climate security expert, who has reviewed the report.</p>
<p>Top British defense officials say they are committed to addressing Nugee’s warnings.</p>
<p>Some of the old-line security establishment in the United States and Europe is waking up to the challenge.</p>
