<a>dreams</a> that usually involve efforts to avoid threats to survival, security, or physical in­tegrity and that generally occur during the second half of the major sleep episode.
<li> <p>On awakening from the dysphoric dreams, the individual rapidly becomes oriented and alert.</p> </li>
<li> <p>The sleep disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, oc­cupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p> </li>
<li> <p>The nightmare symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a sub­ stance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a <a>medication</a>).</p> </li>

<p>Cause of nightmares, as cataloged by the DSM-5:</p>
<li><a>Anxiety</a> and stress are major causes of nightmares</li>
<li>Trauma or upsetting events such as death of a loved one can bring on nightmares</li>
<li>Other causes include a fluctuating sleep schedule, sleep deprivation, jet lag, illness and fever</li>
<li>Side effects of a medication or drug</li>
<li>Medication or drug withdrawal, such as <a>sleeping</a> pills</li>
<li>Alcohol consumption or withdrawal</li>
<li>Difficulty breathing during sleep, such as sleep apnea</li>
<li>Sleep disorders, such as narcolepsy or sleep terror disorder</li>
<p>Treatment of nightmares, as cataloged by the DSM-5:</p>
<a>attention</a>, regular exercise and consistent sleep hygiene are helpful. With physical activity, you may fall asleep faster, and enjoy a deeper sleep. Other helpful tips include relaxation
<a>therapy</a> to reduce muscle tension and lessen anxiety.
<p>A new medication may also be a culprit. Discussing prescription drugs with you physician or health practitioner may be required. Discontinuing medication and trying alternatives may be needed.</p>
<p>Substances to limit or avoid altogether may include: tranquilizers, alcohol, caffeine, other stimulants, especially at bedtime.</p>
<p>However, substance or <a>alcohol abuse</a> must be addressed. Seeking help through regular therapy or support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous may help.</p>
<p>Here are some medical history questions that may be included:</p>
<li>Is there a time pattern to the nightmares?</li>
<li>Are nightmares recurrent? </li>
<li>Do they occur in the first or second half of the night?</li>
<li>Are you suddenly fully awake from sleep?</li>
<li>Do you feel intense <a>fear</a> and anxiety after the nightmare?</li>
<li>Do you remember the imagery, the plot?</li>
<li>Have you been recently ill?</li>
<li>Did you experience a <a>stressful</a> incident?</li>
<li>What is, if any, your alcohol intake?</li>
<li>Do you take medications?</li>
<li>Do you use street drugs? If so, what do you use?</li>
<li>Do you take natural supplements or <a>alternative medicine</a> remedies?</li>
<li>Do you suffer other symptoms?</li>
<p>The physical exam may include neurological and psychological assessments, blood tests, an EEG, as well as tests for liver and thyroid function.</p>
<p>If all possible above causes are ruled out, assessment by a sleep specialist may be required. The specialist may need to give a polysomnography, a test used to diagnose sleep disorders.</p>
<p>Here are some tips to regain sleep:</p>
<li>Adhere to a routine and schedule every night and morning</li>
<li>Sleeping at the same time each night can help</li>
<li>Limit caffeine and alcohol</li>
<li>Avoid <a>lying</a> in bed while awake</li>
<li>Sleep in a cooler temperature</li>
<p>Call your health-care provider if the problem persists. Sleep disorders can be treated with the right help.</p>

<h1> Is Psychology the Key to Defusing Politics? </h1>
<h2> To cut through political strife, we must understand each other. </h2>
<li>Psychology research offers many lessons for politics, including ways to understand disinformation and its effects on political engagement. </li>
<li>Although psychology is often viewed as a left-leaning field, increasingly political thinkers on both sides are turning to psychology research. </li>
<li>In the U.S. and around the world, political discourse cannot be separated from psychological science. </li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>As politics in many countries become increasingly strained, we need to focus on understanding people.</div> <div>Source: Mikhail Nilov/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>here.)</a> (This may not be true internationally;
<a>Bilewicz and colleagues</a> reported data suggesting that such a claim “seems American-centric.”) Perhaps, for this reason, mainstream political discourse in the U.S. has generally not included psychology researchers and academics.
<p>More recently, however, as disinformation seeped into, and then started to drown, much of social media, what psychology researchers have to offer is urgently needed. And pundits, writers, and thinkers on the right are listening, too. Some examples:</p>
<li>The Politicology podcast, hosted by former Republican and Lincoln Project co-founder Ron Steslow, has started to<a> include social scientists</a>, including psychologist Catherine Sanderson, in discussions about U.S. and global politics.</li>
<h3>A Focus on Emotions, Thoughts, and Behavior</h3>
<a>informational learned helplessness</a> and the ways in which misinformation can lead us to just give up. We cited Peter Pomerantsev’s work and the concept of “
<a>censorship by noise</a>” in which
<a>disinformation and its evil twin, malinformation</a>, are overwhelming, and can fuel the triumph of autocracy over democracy.

<h1> Why We Struggle with Living in the Moment </h1>
<h2> It's more than just soaking up the good moments </h2>
<li>Being present in the moment requires a perfect blend of mindfulness and mindlessness.</li>
<li>Being present in the moment is a purposeful mindset.</li>
<li>There are steps you can take to improve mindfulness and feel more present.</li>
<li>Focusing on being present in both enjoyable and mundane moments is important for mindfulness.</li>
<p>So why is something that sounds easy to do actually so difficult? Isn’t living in the moment supposed to happen organically? The truth is, not exactly.</p>
<p>There are endless reasons why this perfect blend of mindfulness and mindlessness is so hard to find, but you can likely relate to at least one of these reasons:</p>
<li>You’re not used to slowing down and allowing your mind a break from <a>productivity</a> or planning ahead</li>
<li>You let small things feel bigger than they are and allow them to consume more mental energy than they deserve</li>
<li>You anticipate the end of a “good” moment before it is over and are letting the anticipation of the end interfere with your appreciation for the present moment.</li>

<a>Research</a> shows that activities such as
<a>meditation</a>, journaling, exercise, and talking with a psychologist can help you feel more mindful and learn to feel present in the moment (Xia et al., 2019), regardless of whether it is exciting or ordinary.
<p>So instead of letting our mindfulness grow rusty as we await a rare oasis of joy, try choosing to see each moment as an opportunity to be present in the life you get to call your own.</p>
<p>Being present is the result of choosing a mindful state of mind, even when you’d rather have your head buried in the sand. It is the daily choice to look around and make your existence purposeful in whatever form it may take. </p>

<div> <h3> How is high sensitivity measured? </h3> </div>
<p>The test to measure sensory sensitivity in the adult population is known as the <a>Highly Sensitive Person Scale (HSPS)</a>. It was first developed and validated by Aron and her husband, Art Aron, in the 1990s, and is available on their website.</p>

<p>Like all personality traits, there are pros and cons to being highly sensitive. With proper support and a recognition of one’s own strengths and weaknesses, HSPs can set up environments in which they can thrive.</p>

<a>co-occur with anxiety and depression</a>—HSPs may find talk
<a>therapy</a> useful for their overall well-being.
<div> <h3> How can I cope with stress as a highly sensitive person? </h3> </div>
<a>stressful</a> situations. Getting enough sleep, eating a healthy
<a>diet</a>, limiting caffeine and
<a>planning for decompression time</a> can all be useful strategies. Talking to a friend or therapist can also help an HSP cope with heightened emotional responses to stress.

<div> <h3> What is it like to live with high sensitivity? </h3> </div>
<a>the environment</a> to suit their needs can be empowering. Most HSPs argue that, despite their sensitivity,
<a>they are still capable of overcoming challenges</a>.
<h2> High Sensitivity, Introversion, and Sensory Processing Disorder </h2>
<a>neuroticism</a>, Aron’s theory maintains that the traits are distinct from one another. Much like
<a>introversion</a> and neuroticism, however, in the eyes of those who identify with the trait, high sensitivity can bring many challenges.
<a>sensory processing disorder</a>, she and her collaborators do not believe that highly sensitive people have SPD. Similarly, high sensitivity may show up more frequently in those with
<a>ADHD</a>, but is distinct from those conditions.
<div> <h3> Is high sensitivity the same as introversion? </h3> </div>
<a>approximately 70 percent, according to Aron</a>) identify as introverts. Introversion refers to a personality trait in which someone “recharges” by being alone; high sensitivity encompasses emotional, physical, and sensory sensitivity.
<div> <h3> Can you be an extroverted HSP? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Yes. In fact, though high sensitivity more often overlaps with introversion, Aron argues that as many as <a>30 percent of HSPs are actually extroverted</a>—though they may still be perceived by others as <a>shy</a>.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> Are HSPs the same as empaths? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What’s the difference between sensory processing sensitivity and sensory processing disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>do not respond appropriately to sensory input</a>. It is distinct from sensory processing sensitivity because while an HSP may have a stronger reaction to sensory input, their brain and body will still process and respond to the stimuli correctly.

<p>Why do companies hire dishonest and unscrupulous employees, such as managers with<a> dark personality traits</a> (e.g., deceitful, manipulative, and exploitative managers)?</p>
<a>paper in press</a> in the Journal of Business
<a>Ethics</a>, suggest companies hire managers whose “willingness to push ethical boundaries aligns with organizational objectives.” One such unethical organizational behavior is creative accounting, specifically earnings management.
<h3>Earnings management and dark personality traits</h3>
<p>Previous research suggests managers with dark personality traits are inclined to engage in unethical work behavior, like earnings management.</p>
<p>Dark personality traits are associated with the following personalities.</p>
<ul><li><a>Psychopaths </a>are superficially charming but callous.</li> <li><a>Narcissists</a> feel superior and entitled.</li> <li>Machiavellians are calculating, long-term manipulators.</li> <li>Sadists lack <a>empathy</a> and enjoy cruelty.</li> </ul>
<a>aversive</a>, research indicates certain
<a>characteristics</a> of individuals with dark personalities are viewed positively in contexts like
<a>politics</a> and business. Which attributes?
<a>impression management</a> skills,
<a>creativity</a>, innovation, and
<a>leadership</a> skills, among others.
<a>Machiavellians</a>, easily rise to leadership positions. Similarly, those with
<a>narcissistic</a> tendencies are more likely to emerge as leaders, a phenomenon observed even in
<p>Harris et al., however, have a different theory: Perhaps companies hire individuals willing to do what is necessary (even if unethical) to achieve organizational objectives. Simply put, companies intentionally seek people with dark personalities.</p>
<p>Let us now turn to tests of the above hypothesis.</p>
<h3>An investigation of hiring decisions and dark personality traits</h3>
<p>Sample: 113 business professionals.</p>
<a>education</a>, and competence, but different in their personality profiles. Specifically, Candidate F possessed few dark traits, while Candidate M possessed many—high in narcissism,
<a>Machiavellianism</a>, moral disengagement, tendency to
<a>rationalize</a> and justify behaviors inconsistent with values, belief in the importance of pleasing powerful others, etc.

<p>Sample: 110 individuals with a background in accounting and finance.</p>
<p>Results: When financial statements were used for firm valuation (compared to owner monitoring), participants were more likely to select Candidate M. Why? Perhaps because of the added pressure to manipulate earnings upwards.</p>
<p>Sample: 41 executive recruitment business professionals.</p>
<p>Results: Analysis of data once again showed a higher probability of Candidate M being recommended for an interview. Thus, the authors note, individuals with dark personality traits appear to be “preselected early in the hiring process.”</p>

<p>Psychology is the study of the mind and behavior. It arose as a discipline distinct from philosophy in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>
<a>genes</a> and temperament, or the tenor of the
<a>nervous system</a>, to beliefs, memories, values, and feelings.
<p>Relationships, experience, and the nature of one’s surroundings are some external factors known to influence us from the outside in and shape individual and group behavior, often in ways that elude awareness.</p>
<h2> What Are Basic Psychological Processes? </h2>
<p>Psychology’s provenance is not only huge but it focuses most on those elements that give human experience its richness. Its major interests include:</p>
<p>• Emotions from affection to <a>guilt</a> to <a>revenge</a>, and all the other feelings that stir human behavior</p>
<p>• Perception, the awareness that operates through our five senses</p>
<p>• <a>Memory</a>, the repository of experience, ours to summon up at will</p>
<p>• Learning, the knowledge and skills we acquire and store in memory for use as needed</p>
<p>• <a>Cognition</a>, the mental processes involved in understanding the world and everything in it</p>
<p>• <a>Motivation</a>, all the desires and drives that fuel human action and behavior, whether the goal is personal growth or connection or a day at the beach</p>
<p>• <a>Dreaming</a>, the dramas unfolding in our heads while we sleep</p>
<p>• The self, that sense you have of being the coherent organizer of your mental and physical life</p>
<p>• Distress, from <a>depression</a> to obsession, from heartbreak to phobias, from <a>addiction</a> to lack of <a>confidence</a>, the many forms of human suffering that, however temporary, can impair functioning</p>
<p>• And, of course, the brain and <a>nervous system</a> that orchestrates it all.</p>

<h2> What Are Basic Principles of Psychology? </h2>
<p>Knowledge of the complexities of the mind’s operations is constantly evolving as new tools become available to literally see inside the mind or indirectly assess its workings. Still, some principles of behavior are well-established:</p>
<a>the environment</a> for clues to what will come next, so an individual can exert some means of control and stay safe.
<p>• In its preference for certainty over uncertainty (which makes us feel uncomfortable and <a>anxious</a>), the mind seeks to detect patterns—and it’s sometimes too good at it, seeing them where they don’t exist.</p>
<a>attention</a>, and another that gathers information automatically, outside of conscious awareness. Both contribute to attitudes, beliefs,
<a>decision-making</a>, and behavior.
<p>• People tend to resist change because it creates uncertainty, at least at first.</p>
<p>• The mind is built for social experience, and isolation undermines mental stability.</p>
<p>• Development occurs over the entire lifespan, as the brain generates new neurons and connections between neurons in response to exercise, mental stimulation, and a nutrient-rich <a>diet</a>.</p>
