<p>A study on office temperature complaints has suggested that women are less likely to be comfortable with their workplace temperature than men are.</p>
<p>It found that a phenomenon dubbed "overcooling" during the summer, in which air conditioning systems cool down rooms more than is necessary, may lead to women in particular feeling uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The study concluded there is "a need to rethink the approach to air-conditioning office buildings" as a result of its findings.</p>
<a>Twitter</a>, from which 16,791 tweets between January 2010 and December 2019 were studied. The tweets were limited to the U.S. and had to include a location plus keywords like "cold" and "office".
<p>From the CBE survey alone, the study found that out of 38 percent of people who said they were dissatisfied with office temperature, 64 percent were women.</p>
<p>Of those people who were dissatisfied, 20 percent said they were too cold during the summer, and 76 percent of that particular group were women. Women were also more likely to say they were too cold in the winter.</p>
<p>There were also more tweets from women (66 percent) than men (34 percent) about cold offices generally, though the study noted that this is an overrepresentation since "an estimated 55 percent of U.S. Twitter users are women."</p>
<p>In any case, the study states that overcooling is "a wasteful and unsustainable energy expense" that "may adversely impact the ability of women to focus on their work."</p>
<p>It did not offer precise reasons for overcooling, but suggested lower-than-necessary temperatures "that favor the thermal preferences of men" could be one reason.</p>

<header><div> Tech Science</div><h1>Viral Video of Tap Water Testing Positive for COVID Explained</h1><div> By Robert Lea <time>On 12/29/21 at 8:20 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> Tech Science Coronavirus <a>Viral video</a></div>
<p>A viral video on TikTok shows a COVID-19 test exposed to tap water showing positive for the virus. But this doesn't mean that COVID is present in tap water.</p>
<p>In the video, which has been viewed almost 4 million times with over 314,000 likes, Dr. Karan Raj shows the test line of a lateral flow COVID test developing after exposure to water.</p>
<p>That, Raj adds, is why, when using a lateral flow COVID test, samples are placed in a buffer solution. This solution helps the test strip maintain its pH level and rating its normal function.</p>
<p>ABC 24 has reported that some COVID-19 testing kits are not being used to test humans, but rather are being used to test tap water. It adds that this is fueling a social media trend of people testing tap water and getting a positive COVID result.</p>
<a>ABC</a> 24 that its test is not designed to be used with any other liquids or foods. This is because, as Raj points out, the chemical properties of other substances change the functioning of the device.
<p>The statement continued: "Spreading misinformation with deliberate misuse of a medical product during a pandemic is misleading, irresponsible, and dangerous to public health."</p>
<p>Infectious disease expert, Steve Threlkeld, told ABC 24: "The whole thing is ridiculous because these tests are finely tuned and you can't just put whatever material you want to in there.</p>
<p>"It's like me saying, 'you know, I need to do a blood test on you but I can't get blood so I am going to pour your urine specimen on it and run that.' I mean that would be crazy."</p>
<h2>Can COVID Be Transmitted Through Water?</h2>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a>CDC</a>) says: "The virus that causes COVID-19 has not been detected in drinking water.</p>
<p>"Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes <a>COVID-19</a>."</p>
<p>In a video produced for the World Health Organisation (<a>WHO</a>) its director of the Department of Global Infectious Hazard Preparedness, Dr. Sylvie Briand, said: "Water cannot transmit COVID-19. Drinking water is not transmitting COVID-19."</p>
<p><a>Briand</a> continued by explaining how this applies to swimming and the use of pools and hot tubs. She added: "If you swim in a swimming pool or in a pond, you cannot get COVID-19 through water.</p>
<p>The CDC adds that while COVID-19 has been found in untreated wastewater, there is still no evidence that exposure to the virus in this way could lead to the development of the virus.</p>
<p>The CDC also says that based on current information both standard municipal and individual septic systems wastewater treatments should inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>

<p>A teenager was bitten by a rogue hamster while watching the new Spider-Man movie at a theater in Mobile, Alabama, according to his family.</p>
<p>The bizarre incident occurred on December 27 during a 6 p.m. showing of "Spider-Man: No Way Home," that the teen was attending with some friends, local media outlet WKRG reported.</p>
<p>At one point during the showing, the friends saw what looked like a rat running along the aisle by their feet, the teen's mother Dana Whitton told WKRG.</p>
<p>The group put their feet up as the small creature ran past. As soon as they put their feet down, Whitton's son reached into his bucket of popcorn and was surprised to find a hamster inside.</p>
<p>One of the group then captured a short video of the teen trying to trap the hamster using the bucket.</p>
<p>After trapping the rodent, the teen picked the creature up and took it to a theater employee. But while the pair discussed the situation, the hamster bit the teen and he dropped it.</p>
<p>According to the family, the employee then picked up a broom and dustpan and swept the hamster up into it. It is not clear what happened to the hamster afterwards.</p>
<p>Whitton said her son was given a refund for his ticket by the theater manager, as well as free popcorn.</p>
<p>The owners of the hamster have not been identified. But Mobile resident Shay Brunson told WKRG that she attended the same theater on December 23 and saw four teenagers looking for their hamster.</p>
<p>The teens had taken the animal to the theater but had apparently lost it before their movie began. The group reportedly left their contact details with theater employees in case anyone found the hamster.</p>
<p>"<a>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a>," which was released in the U.S. on December 17, is a superhero film based on the eponymous character from the Marvel comics. It is the sequel to "Spider-Man: Homecoming" (2017) and "Spider-Man: Far From Home" (2019.)</p>
<p>Starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, the film follows the character after his real identity has been revealed.</p>
<p>The movie has received positive reviews from critics and has so far grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, making it the <a>highest earning film of 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Given that the origin story of the Spider-Man character involves Peter Parker being bitten by a radioactive spider, some social media users were quick to pick up on the similarities with the hamster incident.</p>
<p>"Watch out for the new Hampster Man, able to stuff large quantities in their cheeks, burrow underground, (or under blankets) and sleep inordinate amounts of time," one <a>Facebook</a> user, Danielle Andaya, said.</p>
<p>Another user, Anthony Munn, said: "Hopefully it wasn't a radioactive hamster."</p>
<p>"Good thing it wasn't a spider," another user, <a>Holley Pyron</a>, said.</p>

<p>A Welsh town is being held in the grip of fear by a most unusual source, a grey squirrel that is attacking residents.</p>
<p>Wales Online reported that the serial squirrel has indiscriminately attacked pensioners, pets, and children, jumping at people taking out the garbage, and been chasing after people down streets as they flee.</p>
<p>Residents of Buckley have been left bitten and bruised by the attacks, which have even left some of them having to have tetanus jabs.</p>
<p>The squirrel has been named "Stripe" after the Mogwai that terrorizes Gizmo in Joe Dante's 1983 film Gremlins, with some residents of Buckley labeling the squirrel a "psycho."</p>
<p>After being attacked herself and becoming concerned for the safety of youngsters, 65-year-old Buckley resident Corinne Elizabeth Reynolds took it upon herself to snare Stripe.</p>
<p>"I will sadly have to take it to my vet to be PTS [put to sleep] I'm not risking my 2-year-old grandson going in the garden till it's gone."</p>
<a>the squirrel.</a> She has since attempted to contact animal rescue charities, but as this has failed, Stripe now faces being put to sleep by vets.
<p>It would be illegal for the vets or Reynolds to release Stripe back into the wild as under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 it is illegal to release captured grey squirrels, as they are considered an invasive species.</p>
<p>"For me to want to put to sleep an animal was a step not taken lightly," she said. "But I'm not putting my grandson at risk of getting bitten by a squirrel who just lunges for an attack."</p>

<p>Amazon has reached a settlement agreement with the National Labor Relations Board to allow its workers to more freely organize unionization efforts, and said it wouldn't retaliate against those efforts going forward.</p>
<p>The settlement outlines a variety of changes Amazon will make in how it reacts to employees' unionization efforts and what it will do in the future.</p>
<a>Starbucks</a> locations across the country.
<p>Earlier this month, a Buffalo, New York, Starbucks voted in favor of unionization, meaning the coffee giant would have to negotiate with a labor union for the first time in its 70-year history.</p>
<p>According to the agreement, the online behemoth said it would reach out via email to its warehouse workers—former and current—who were on the job anytime since March 22 to notify them of their organizing rights.</p>
<p>According to the terms of the settlement, the labor board will be able to more easily sue Amazon—without going through a laborious process of administrative hearings—if it finds that the online company reneged on its agreement.</p>
<p>Abruzzo added that "working people should know that the National Labor Relations Board will vigorously seek to ensure Amazon's compliance with the settlement and continue to defend the labor rights of all workers."</p>
<p>Amazon.com Inc., based in Seattle, couldn't be reached immediately for comment.</p>
<p>Recent worker unrest comes as labor shortages are giving workers a rare upper hand in wage negotiations and demands for more flexibility in their work schedules.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<p>A group of Apple Inc. employees announced Thursday that they would be staging a walkout on Christmas Eve, and implored the public to not buy their products on that day.</p>
<p>In a statement posted on <a>Twitter</a>, the employees, represented by a group called Apple Together, said they were staging the December 24 walkout to "demand better working conditions."</p>
<p>Although the number of employees who are planning to protest is unclear, the Twitter post urged consumers to stand in solidarity with workers across Apple.</p>
<p>"Don't cross the picket line!" the statement read. "We are Apple. We deserve a respectful workplace. We deserve paid sick time. We deserve protection on the frontlines. We deserve proper mental healthcare."</p>
<p>"Demand that Apple upholds its image with your wallet. Don't shop in stores, don't shop online," the statement continued.</p>
<a>Netflix</a> who have shed light on workplace conditions.
<p>While it was reported that many executive-level Apple employees will be on holiday vacation on December 24, many retail workers are still scheduled to work at Apple stores across the country.</p>
<p>This resulted in over 500 responses from current and former workers who ended up sharing their personal anecdotes.</p>
<p>The #AppleToo organizers, who The Verge reported comprised "only about 15 current and former Apple employees," stated that they had gone through a number of internal channels at the company with no results.</p>
<p>Apple Together is not the only group demanding a look into the company's practices.</p>
<p>A <a>recent proposal</a> from a group of Apple shareholders asked the company to conduct a civil rights audit of the business amidst reports of pay inequities and racial inequality among the top corporate brass.</p>
<p>Apple's 2020 diversity report noted that the company's leadership was only four percent Black and eight percent Hispanic, with the largest portion of Apple workers being white.</p>
<p>"Given the importance of gender and racial equality, having this level of review is not only appropriate but highly beneficial," stated Jonas Kron, the head of one of the investment groups pushing for the audit.</p>
<p>The U.S. National Labor Board is also reportedly investigating at least two complaints that have been filed by Apple employees.</p>

<p>New York City's latest COVID-19 vaccine mandate requiring private-sector workers to show they have received at least one vaccine dose was implemented on Monday.</p>
<p>The new mandate requires the city's businesses to confirm and record all employees' vaccination statuses. Employees who have only gotten one dose will need to get their second within 45 days.</p>
<p>Businesses that do not comply face fines upward of $1,000, though New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said this is a last resort.</p>
<p>The businesses will also be required to sign a form affirming that they are complying with the order and display it in a "public-facing location."</p>
<p>In addition to business requirements, any New Yorkers aged 12 and older will be required to show proof of two vaccine doses–not just one anymore–to go inside restaurants, gyms and theaters.</p>
<p>On <a>MSNBC</a>'s Morning Joe, de Blasio said more U.S. cities should consider implementing mandates like New York's.</p>
<p>"We're implementing the strongest vaccine mandate in the country," he said. "This is what we need to do everywhere. Every mayor, every governor, every CEO in America should do vaccine mandates now...2022 has to be the year we leave COVID behind."</p>
<p>Businesses are not required to discipline or fire non-compliant workers, but they must keep them out of the workplace. Workers seeking an accommodation on religious grounds can come to work while their request is pending.</p>
<p>Despite supply chain and inflation woes, holiday shopping in 2021 rose at its fastest pace in 17 years.</p>
<p>"I feel really good about how the season played out," Mastercard senior adviser Steve Sadove said. "When people feel a little bit uncomfortable, you'll see a little bit of a pickup in online and a little bit of a slowdown in store performance.''</p>
<p>The numbers are preliminary results. The National Retail Federation will release its two-month results around the middle of January.</p>
<p>Americans also learned to adjust to product shortages, turning to alternatives if their top choices were not available, or looking at other venues like eBay to find their top brands.</p>
<header><div> U.S.</div><h1>US Travelers Continue to Face a Wave of Cancellations as COVID Decimates Flight Crews</h1><div> By Daniel Villarreal <time>On 12/28/21 at 12:16 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>U.S. travelers are continuing to face a wave of airlines cancellations as COVID-19 decimates flight crews.</p>
<p>From Sunday through Tuesday, airlines are forecast to cancel 8,040 flights and delay 22,849 more, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flight information.</p>
<p>Icy weather has caused some of the delays and cancellations. However, American, Delta and <a>United Airlines</a> as well as JetBlue Airways have all said that the spread of the Omicron variant among work crews <a>has contributed most of all</a>.</p>
<a>delayed tens of thousands of travelers</a>, spoiling their holiday plans and leaving them scrambling for alternative flights during the busy tail-end of the holiday travel season.
<p>Despite the rise of Omicron, end-of-year holiday travel this year nearly returned to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>Omicron can also bypass the immunity provided by vaccinations, boosters and previous infections, though its symptoms are more severe in those unvaccinated.</p>
<p>JetBlue, American and Spirit Airlines have offered pay increases to schedule holiday workers. But some would-be holiday staff can't work now anyway due to a mandatory COVID-19 quarantine period.</p>
<p>Despite the holiday delays and cancellations, the work shortages may be somewhat alleviated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (<a>CDC</a>) recent shortening of its suggested isolation and quarantine periods.</p>
<p>On Monday, the CDC said those who had been exposed to COVID-19 or tested positive for the virus <a>could stay isolated for just five days</a> rather than the previously suggested 10-day period.</p>
<p>The shortened period could help some airline workers return to help delayed travelers reach their destinations before the year's end.</p>
<p>If a flight has been canceled or delayed, passengers can get a refund by submitting a claim through the website of the federal Department of Transportation (DOT).</p>
<p>However, each claim is handled on a case-by-case basis and can take some time to resolve, depending on what each airline did in its attempt to address inconvenienced travelers.</p>

<p>The remnants of lice infestations found on ancient mummies can unlock the DNA of those that lived thousands of years ago, said research published by Molecular Biology and Evolution on Tuesday.</p>
<a>noted in 2018</a>, "the reality is that humans have had head lice living on them for thousands of years."
<p>"They were so common in the past that almost every family was in possession of a special comb to remove and keep them under control or in low numbers," she said, adding that these combs were often made of bone, wood or cactus spine.</p>
<p>As it turns out, this lice glue is remarkable in its ability to preserve the DNA of the hair and skin cells it encases—meaning that researchers were able to access otherwise-unknown information about the mummies.</p>
<p>"If you have hair, or if you have clothing, you can find nits attached," said Perotti, per Smithsonian. "We can study thousands of years of the hosts', and lice's, natural and evolutionary history just by examining the DNA trapped in the cement."</p>
<p>The method of sourcing ancient DNA via lice glue is a huge step, as other methods of accessing this information (via bones or teeth, for example) are often prohibited because they cause damage to the bodies.</p>
<p>According to researchers, the cells preserved in lice cement yielded the same amount of DNA as would be found in a human tooth—and twice as much as the petrous bone of a skull.</p>
