<p>HOMER's learning experts have provided some tips for encouraging your child to learn (and have fun doing it) this summer.</p>
<h2><span>Get Creative With a Story Box </span></h2>
<p>When we inspire creativity in kids, we're empowering their self-expression! A simple way to do this is to make a story box. Gather 5-6 items into a box and give your child time to create a story using all of the items.</p>
<p>For kids ages 5 and under, they can make up the story as they go. The only rule is they must use everything in the box as part of the story. For older kids, ask them to plan out their stories ahead of time.</p>
<p>Peggy Kaye, HOMER's Senior Director of Learning and Curriculum Design, also says, "In addition to the sheer fun, children benefit educationally, physically and psychologically when they engage in building with blocks and other materials."</p>
<p>Did you know that when children (or adults) engage in activities that use multiple senses, they are more likely to retain information? This makes cooking great for building memories, and learning too!</p>
<p>Cooking is also an easy way to introduce the following multi-step instructions. You can start with simple ones like, "Go to the pantry, get the flour, and put it on the counter."</p>
<p>Enjoying stories together helps build your child's vocabulary and language skills.</p>
<p>Reading stimulates the imagination and expands our understanding of the world around us. Most importantly, reading with your child builds a love of stories and, in time, a love of reading.</p>
<p>A great way to make reading part of your child's day is to set aside a specific time to read together. Make this time special: pick a "reading spot", get comfy, use funny voices for the characters, and stop to talk about the story as you go.</p>

<header><div> <a>World</a></div><h1>The Reality of University Without the Normal Parties, Classes or Friends</h1><div> By Basit Mahmood <time>On 8/12/20 at 7:00 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>While COVID-19 has impacted everyone, for those students receiving results and looking to head to university, its consequences could last for a lifetime.</p>
<p>On Thursday, college students across England will find out their A-level results and if they have secured a place at their chosen universities.</p>
<p>The difference this year is that no exams have been taken, no papers marked and students are relying on predictions and assessments done by teachers.</p>
<p>What will happen to their grades when they are decided not by their own work and effort in exams but by a computer algorithm looking at their school performance and postcode?</p>
<p>And is there any point in going into higher education when there will be fewer classes, fewer opportunities to meet new people and social distancing guidelines will almost certainly remain in place?</p>
<p>"I'm absolutely terrified," student Megan Cook, who hopes to study English Literature at the University of Durham, tells Newsweek.</p>
<p>Social mobility charity The Sutton Trust has warned that if A-level and GCSE results are based on predicted grades and assessments, it will be the most disadvantaged students that suffer.</p>
<p>High-attaining disadvantaged students that are more likely to have their grades under predicted than their richer counterparts, its report found.</p>
<p>Last week's results from Scotland already show that students from poorer backgrounds were <a>marked down heavily</a>, something the First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon apologized for and said would be fixed.</p>
<p>Ofqual has said that schools in England can <a>appeal results</a> if they believe their students have been penalised unfairly and if results do not reflect improvements made by the school.</p>
<p>What steps are being taken to ensure students from disadvantaged backgrounds are not disproportionately affected?</p>
<p>"It's definitely on our agenda, we're thinking about that very question," says Sir Michael Barber, chair of the Office for Students (OFS), which acts as the regulator for the higher education sector in England.</p>
<p>Access Agreements are plans set out in agreement with the OFS by universities to sustain or improve access, student success and progression among people from underrepresented and disadvantaged groups.</p>
<p>Sir Michael says universities intend to stick to their access agreements, despite the challenges posed by COVID-19.</p>
<p>With U.K. students required to pay fees of up to £9,250 for their courses, do they feel it's still worth it if most of their lessons take place online and they risk missing out on the typical university experience?</p>
<p>"Absolutely not, I think it should be a lot cheaper than it is, because it's all online," Megan says.</p>
<p>"First year it's all more about building your skills and socializing more than second or third year, at university you can't really do your first year of university online, without facing some sort of consequence for that.</p>
<p>"It should at least be cheaper, if not completely almost reformed, because they're having to scramble together to put in place an online system they've never had to do before."</p>
<p>Kai, who is also hoping to go to the university of Bath this year, says that whether universities still provide value for money as they adapt to a "new normal" in the middle of a pandemic is something he has given a lot of thought.</p>
<p>"Also towards the end of sixth form when schools were shut down across the U.K., we did online learning and for most of us it was not helpful at all so we would definitely prefer more face to face learning as opposed to Zoom calls."</p>
<p>Sir Michael says that universities have been told by the regulator to do all they can to provide students with a first-class experience.</p>
<p>"We are emphasizing to universities that they need to provide students with an outstanding education and during the three years of a degree that has lasting value and you're paying for all of that," he tells Newsweek.</p>
<p>"The beginning of the new academic year won't be easy for anyone but I do know that the universities have done very important, good and thorough planning and are well placed to meet the aspirations of students.</p>
<p>"We are in unprecedented times but if everybody goes into it with a positive spirit I am very confident that students will get a good education which is what their main purpose of going to university is as well as a good experience."</p>
<p>"I'd already set out the plan, I'm ready to go," Megan says.</p>
<p>Sir Michael says if he were 18 and thinking about going to university, deferring wouldn't be an attractive option in the current circumstances.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't defer because normally if you defer you'd be looking for work options or travel options and neither of those are particularly easy in the next 12 months," he says.</p>
<p>International student numbers are also <a>expected to fall given travel restrictions and the uncertainty, according to the British Council</a>, which it has warned could result in a loss of up to £460m in income from students from east Asia alone.</p>
<p>For some, U.K. universities face the perfect storm, but Sir Michael doesn't seem to be too worried.</p>
<p>"We are concerned about the financial health of universities and they are being helped by the government with support packages," he says.</p>
<p>He believes that the vast majority of universities are financially stable but there may be a small number of universities who run into financial difficulties.</p>
<p>"They will let us know and we will assist them," he says.</p>
<p>For thousands of students like Kai however, the future is one of uncertainty.</p>
<p>"Given the lack of certainty about my results as we did no official end of year exams to give us an indication of how we did, we have to just assume our grades based on previous results and classwork," he says</p>
<p>"Due to exams being cancelled me and a lot of others have slowed down a lot on learning and have had such a long break that going back into education may be slightly more of a struggle, especially considering it won't be under normal circumstances."</p>
<p>Let's quickly look at a few numbers first. According to Statista:</p>
<ul><li>Number of digital buyers worldwide surpassed the 2 billion mark in 2020</li><li>Global e-retail sales amounted to 2.8 trillion USD, and projections show a growth of up to 4.8 trillion by 2021</li></ul>

<p>As many students prepare to begin the new school year with online classes because of the COVID-19 pandemic, an Arkansas first-grader's parents set him up with a realistic classroom that puts some real-life classrooms to shame.</p>
<p>The first-grader took the atmosphere a step further by wearing his school uniform to the virtual class. "I want to wear my uniform because my class has to wear them," he told local news outlet WKYC.</p>
<a>Facebook post</a>, Ashley wrote that the couple "both do try our best as parents! His education is a team effort!"
<p>Posters around Bryce's pop-up classroom include information about punctuation, homophones and sentence structure. His parents told WKYC that the posters were designed in photoshop.</p>
<p>On whiteboards, his parents wrote encouraging words for him to kick off the school year, including "1st Grade Ready" and "Happy 1st Day of First Grade."</p>
<p>Newsweek reached out to Ashley Latimer via Facebook message but did not receive a response in time for publication.</p>
<p>"Today I cleared 50 entire lists and countless extra items were purchased from lovely people just passing through. Will do more this week and would love to focus on struggling districts and special needs," Teigen wrote in a <a>tweet.</a></p>
<header><div> <a>News</a></div><h1>School Districts Relax Substitute Requirements Due to Coronavirus and Teacher Shortage</h1><div> By Katherine Fung <time>On 8/27/20 at 9:49 AM EDT</time></div> </header>
<p>A teacher shortage exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a desperate need for substitute teachers across the nation.</p>
<p>In efforts to expand the pool of substitute teachers, states like Missouri and Iowa, have relaxed the requirements necessary to qualify as a substitutes teacher.</p>
<p>Iowa made similar modifications at the beginning of August. Instead of the previously required bachelor's degree, those with associate's degrees or 60 hours of college credit can now become substitute teachers for schools in the state.</p>
<p>But some worry that these changes will result in a wave of unprepared teachers who won't be able to juggle both the classroom environment and the ongoing health crisis.</p>
<p>"It is basically a band-aid on a broader issue on the possibility of being short of personnel," Iowa State Education Association President Mike Beranek told KCCI-TV on August 7.</p>
<p>Berkeley Heights Public Schools Superintendent Melissa Varley said that although New Jersey has not relaxed requirements, she would be nervous if the state followed suit.</p>
<p>"Obviously we want the best person in front of our students, whether it's online or in-person," she told Newsweek.</p>
<p>Substitute teachers have been relied on heavily, even pre-pandemic, to make up for the decreasing number of incoming teachers.</p>
<p>A poll of more than 2,000 principals, district leaders and school board members found that 71 percent of educators expect the demand for substitute teachers to increase in their schools and districts.</p>
<p>With districts being able to only fill a little over half of teacher absences, administrators have been forced to lower their standards when it comes to substitute teachers.</p>
<p>The report, commissioned by Kelly Education, one of the nation's largest educational talent solution providers, found that 47 percent of participants admitted to lowering their hiring standards for substitute teachers.</p>
<p>However, Kelly Education's president, Nicola Soares, doesn't think that the changes in teaching requirements will impact the level of education provided to students.</p>
<p>"Typically, if they have [reduced requirements], where they might have lowered credit hours to an undergraduate degree, I don't see that as material," she said.</p>
<p>Krista Stockman, the public information officer at Fort Wayne Community Schools (FWCS), said these concerns can be mitigated by making conscious efforts when staffing substitute teachers.</p>
<p>The Indiana school district, where substitute teacher requirements were relaxed a year ago to help alleviate the staffing shortage, aims to fill longer-term substitute positions with more qualified candidates.</p>
<p>"We try to first fill those with certified teachers and then next would be people with bachelor's degrees. The people with associate's degrees are really the ones just stepping into a classroom for a day at a time," Stockman told Newsweek.</p>
<p>Katnik added, "the goal was never to make it easier to be a substitute teacher. What we wanted to explore is is there a way to get the pool bigger by reaching into groups of people we hadn't been able to reach before."</p>
<p>"There's a lot of reasons why people don't get 60 hours of college credit and it doesn't necessarily mean that individual couldn't be a good substitute teacher," he said.</p>
<p>"Obviously it's frustrating. We know that our children need to be in schools. The mental health issues alone and the anxiety from being remote for so long," the superintendent said.</p>
<p>He is hopeful that expanding the pool of hiring when it comes to substitute teachers will only improve the education system.</p>
<p>"What we feel like that's going to do is not only get us more people, but maybe get us even better people," Katnik said.</p>

<a>statement</a>. The school also made it clear that the action wasn't intended to be a "punishment or admonishment" towards the teacher.
<p>The school also announced that Lifka had been reinstated on Tuesday and can keep the posters in the virtual classroom given that the graphic "does not come to overly disrupt or detract from the educational process or the learning environment."</p>
<p>Lifka told the Tribune that she didn't intend on returning unless the school supported "anti-racist policies and tolerance in our classrooms." She requested additional training and guidance for staff about inclusion.</p>
<p>Lifka said that she hopes that this leads to concrete changes and the hope to foster an inclusive learning environment for students in the district.</p>
<p>In a column titled "Get Drunk and Walk Around," for Duke's student-run media organization The Chronicle, senior Jordan Diamond argues that what people are really missing out on isn't the bar scene, but the time it takes to get to and from the bar.</p>
<p>In his bio at the end of the piece, Diamond did ask people that are looking to make their own memories by drinking and walking around to exercise caution. He asked not to disturb members of the community and to wear a mask if they do go out.</p>
<p>A New Jersey teen sparked a number of discussions last week, when teachers asked him to take down a flag supporting President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.</p>
<a>Jersey Shore Online</a> that he arrived early for his final class of the day: chemistry, when the teacher asked that he remove the flag.
<p>Ribeiro told <a>NBC News</a> that he "looked up at him and kind of just looked back down like he didn't hear him," but the teacher told him that he'd need to leave if he didn't remove the flag, and he left.</p>
<p>Ribeiro's mother Tara Jost said she was outraged by the teacher's request. "I was actually shocked. I couldn't believe that a teacher would ask my son to take down something that was in my home," she told NBC.</p>
<p>The student said that the following day, an English teacher asked the same thing, but explained that it may be a distraction, and he was happy to remove it as requested.</p>
<p>Jost told Newsweek in a Facebook message that she thinks there's a simple solution. "We really would just like an apology," she wrote.</p>
<p>Ribeiro said he felt like freedom of expression was important for students to be able to exercise. "It's important for young people to be able to express their views it's our first amendment right," he told NBC.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, podcaster and internet personality Trill Withers tweeted that a student in his nephew's class was having a crab leg feast for breakfast and offered his support for the student. "[T]his generation got it all figured out," he wrote.</p>
<p>He also shared a screenshot of a message the student sent after the teacher asked her to turn off the camera, as her crab leg feast was distracting the class. "I had 3 plates of crab legs now im [sic] ready to learn," the student wrote.</p>
<p>The former Barstool Sports commentator tweeted a little later that he was so amused by the young student's lavish breakfast that he wanted to get her response about being ready to learn tattooed on his stomach.</p>

<p>Withers did not respond to Newsweek's request for comment via Instagram direct message in time for publication, or, for a breakfast invitation.</p>

<p>Chicago teachers are braving the snow and holding classes outside as Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and the Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) continue to meet at the bargaining table.</p>
<p>What began as a symbolic first day back transpired into a movement after Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot called on teachers to return to in-person classrooms.</p>
<p>Kirstin Roberts, a pre-K teacher, was asked to return to in-person on January 6 as part of wave 1, but she said none of her coworkers felt safe to do so. Roberts was especially concerned as she lives with her elderly mother.</p>
<p>"We decided that instead of going inside the building to teach our remote students, we would teach outside," Roberts told Newsweek. "It was snowy and it was cold."</p>
<p>The preschool team was the first group to be called back, but Roberts said they were quickly joined by other colleagues who wanted to show support.</p>
<p>Although the teachers returned to their homes to continue teaching virtually the next day, the outdoor class caught the attention of other teachers concerned about their health and safety amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Elementary language arts teacher Dwayne Reed decided to follow suit when he was called back to work last week. Although the first day was manageable, he quickly realized on the second day what exactly he had signed up for.</p>
<p>"The wind started blowing unbelievably. I had a blanket and I was using the blanket as a cover but it became a wind tunnel and it was like a parachute," he told Newsweek.</p>
<p>Despite the cold weather, Reed, whose wife is pregnant with their first child, said he remains determined to continue teaching outside to avoid mitigate the risk of bringing COVID-19 home.</p>
<p>"I know that I can do my job effectively from my home," he said. "I just want to protect my wife and my child."</p>
<p>Roberts said she would continue teaching outdoors too if that's what it will take for CPS to reconsider sending teachers back at this time.</p>
<p>Lightfoot initially insisted that K-8 teachers show up for work in person on Monday, or risk being locked out of their virtual classrooms.</p>
<p>"Teachers need accommodations," elementary music teacher Quentin Washington told Newsweek. "We need to be able to say hey, I'm very uncomfortable with teaching in this building because I have a loved one at home who's at risk."</p>
<p>He said he was locked out after that day and has remained barred from his classroom.</p>
<p>Washington says Chicago teachers should not only be provided a safe reopening plan, but have access to vaccines if CPS insists they return to in-person learning.</p>
<p>CPS teachers are scheduled to begin getting vaccines this month.</p>
<p>Washington said that teaching from remote has allowed him to conduct lessons that wouldn't be possible in-person.</p>
<p>Martin, who has luckily remained indoors when teaching, called Monday "anxiety-inducing."</p>
<p>But Martin is hopeful that the two parties will strike a deal and that if teachers end up returning to schools, they will be able to do so safely.</p>
<p>In a statement made Monday evening, Jackson and Lightfoot said, "teams remain at the bargaining table with the goal of reaching a sensible agreement that allows Chicago's students and teachers to safely return to the classroom."</p>
<p>With over 70 meetings conducted since June, Monday marks the first time CPS and CTU have reached tentative agreements.</p>

<p>March 20 is International Francophonie Day. It is a time to celebrate not only the French language, but also cultural diversity and multilingualism.</p>
<p>American Francophones are, without a doubt, an important part of this cultural diversity.</p>
<p>The United States is home to a longstanding richness of multilingual heritage, yet this intrinsic commitment to multilingualism has recently been challenged by significant cuts in foreign language programs across all levels.</p>
<a>A survey</a> by the French Embassy of university French departments nationwide found that among 134 of the biggest French departments, 11 percent experienced the
<a>closure of a major</a> this year and 75 percent were affected by a decrease in staff or salaries.
<a>Researchers rediscovered language learning, particularly among young children, improved learning outcomes in a variety of disciplines over an extended period of time</a>.
<a>Empirical evidence</a> also suggested that the teaching of foreign languages encouraged the development of empathy, emotional intelligence and effective interpretive and interpersonal skills.
<a>Business leaders recognize</a> the necessity of foreign language skills, especially when it comes to negotiating and attracting foreign direct investments in the U.S. In a time of globalization, with
<a>75 percent of the world's population not speaking English</a>, multilingualism has never been more useful than it is today.
<p>Fortunately, there is good reason to hope.</p>
<a>700 million by 2050</a>, to become the second most-spoken language in the world. This will dramatically impact the U.S. labor market.
<a>Research shows that the number of positions requiring a mastery of French has more than doubled between 2010 and 2015.</a>
<a>According to the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages</a>, French is the third most in demand foreign language among U.S employers.
<p>We hope to highlight the role of French in the professional world by giving an opportunity to students who have been unable to study abroad and make in-person connections because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Monolingualism will be the illiteracy of the 21st century.</p>

<p>The U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan last month was a major wake-up call to leaders, ministers and policymakers in Europe—or at least it should have been.</p>
<a>laser-guided munitions</a> started running low within weeks. France's eight-year counterterrorism campaign in the Sahel region of Africa would have ended long ago if it wasn't for Washington's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support. The
<a>European Union</a>, which leads a security and training mission there, often looked like a bit player in its own military operation. Europe's griping over a lack of U.S. consultation on Afghanistan is just one more chapter in what seems like
<a>a never-ending story</a> of European leaders more interested in lecturing than in actually doing something, anything, to make themselves relevant.
<a>remarked</a> that "Europe can—and clearly should—be able and willing to do more on its own." In The New York Times weeks earlier, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell
<a>released</a> a five-point statement on the need to boost the European Union's autonomy so Europe as a whole could transform into a global player. In 1999, the EU
<a>agreed to establish</a> a force of 50,000-60,000 military personnel that would have the ability to deploy to a conflict zone within two months. In the early 2000s, EU ministers worked on
<a>a concept</a> that would form two joint European battlegroups of 1,500 personnel each, which would theoretically deploy on short notice. Those proposals, however, have expired on the shelf.
<a>wrote</a>, this would require Washington to challenge conventionality by reassessing its approach toward defending Europe and engaging in some introspection about whether the current U.S. force posture of
<a>70,000-80,000 troops</a> is truly necessary. In short, NATO needs a new division of labor more suitable for the post-Cold War world, one in which the U.S. is the final insurance provider of Europe's defense rather than the first-responder.
<p>The most effective way to push Europe into becoming more self-sustainable, if not independent, is for the U.S. to do less on the continent.</p>
