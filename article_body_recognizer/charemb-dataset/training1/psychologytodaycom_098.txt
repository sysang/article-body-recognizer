<h1> The Emotional Impact of Losing an Invisible Body Part </h1>
<h2> Personal perspective: Requiem for my prostate. </h2>
<li>It's important to take the time to acknowledge body changes—even those nobody can see.</li>
<li>Perceived pressure to tell well-wishers "I am fine" can distract us from the necessary grieving.</li>
<li>With care, internal and intangible losses can be visualised to aid the mourning process.</li>
<p>I am reflecting on the deeper meaning of my invisible body changes after prostatectomy. I am healed on the outside. I can do everything I used to do out in the world. But something has changed deep inside.</p>
<p>A requiem is a musical act or token of remembrance. Here is a soundtrack to this post's remembrance:</p>
<blockquote> <p>"I ache in the places where I used to play." —Leonard Cohen, 1988</p> </blockquote>
<p>I look the same externally. The real changes are quite subtle, and often hard to name. </p>
<h3>My Body Has Changed Since Prostatectomy</h3>
<p>There's a profound emptiness where my prostate used to be. It was located so deep within my pelvis that I really didn't quite know where it was.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>The emptiness within</div> <div>Source: © Shinichi Maruyama, Kusho #1, 2007, Courtesy Bruce Silverstein Gallery, New York</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But it quietly controlled my bladder literally without me giving it a thought. My prostate added hugely to all kinds of <a>sexual</a> pleasure and it produced almost all the fluid I used to ejaculate.</p>
<p>And according to some <a>spiritual</a> traditions, it was at the base of the delicate and powerful chain of energy centres, known as chakras, that lead all the way from my sitplace to the crown of my head.</p>
<h3>Taking Time to Recognise the Changes</h3>
<p>What has personally helped me get in touch with the loss was a memorial-like ritual facilitated by my somatic coach Vanissar. This helped me really connect with the loss of my prostate—a body part I hardly knew, until it was gone.</p>
<p>I am <a>grateful</a> for this opportunity to mourn. It really felt like a memorial for this lost and often overlooked little gland.</p>
<p>She held me emotionally and spiritually while I just paid <a>attention</a> to my prostate, remembered it, celebrated its life, and grieved for its death—just like a funeral.</p>
<h3>Losing Your Prostate Is Like Being on the Dancefloor When the Music Stops</h3>
<p>The metaphor that emerged was that of the DJ at a party: you don't pay a lot of attention to the DJ so long as the music plays.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Only when the music stops do we turn to the DJ</div> <div>Source: Photo by A. L. on Unsplash</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But if the music stops, the whole dancefloor grinds to a halt, and we all turn to look for the DJ.</p>
<p>My prostate, like the DJ in the analogy, made the party of life that much more enjoyable. At this moment I am rather like those dancers: frozen in time as the music stopped.</p>
<p>I am sure I can learn to dance without the DJ. It is a practice of dancing to the music within. But I sure miss my prostate.</p>
<h3>Social Pressure: "Are You Fine Now?"</h3>
<p>People around me prefer to get past the loss and the changes. The most common question I get is not "How are you?" but "Are you all fine now? Are you over it?"</p>
<p>I love their positive intent that I should be over it. But the impact is often that I minimise the actual loss.</p>
<p>It is time to recognise deep body changes after prostatectomy. I have a new body. I am slowly getting to know it. My wife is getting to know it. It's partly the same as before, and it is deeply different.</p>
<p>Am I all fine now? Yes. And no.</p>

<h2> Why People Get Divorced </h2>
<div> <h3> What are common reasons for divorce? </h3> </div>
<a>common reasons for divorce</a> include lack of intimacy, lack of commitment, infidelity, and basic incompatibility. Other prevalent causes are constant conflict, financial differences,
<a>addiction</a>, and abuse. Many people articulate the root of their divorce as a betrayal—of expectations, hopes, and

<div> <h3> Why can’t I let go of my anger toward my ex? </h3> </div>
<a>release the anger that can accompany rejection and divorce.</a> People may resist moving forward because they aren’t ready to detach from their suffering. Letting go of
<a>anger</a> means letting go of the hope that the other person will ever feel remorse, see their perspective, or come back to them.
<div> <h3> What steps can help me recover from divorce? </h3> </div>
<a>work through your emotions</a>—through journaling, friends, divorce support groups, or
<a>therapy</a>—before beginning legal proceedings. If possible, choose a process that keeps you out of court. Finally, work toward
<a>forgiveness</a>, both for your ex and yourself.

<a>15 million American adults</a>and 400,000 adolescents suffer from alcohol use disorder, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. But treatment and support are available to help those suffering begin to heal.
<p>For more information on symptoms, causes, and treatment of alcohol use disorder see our Diagnosis Dictionary.</p>

<h2> Signs, Symptoms, and Diagnosis </h2>
<div> <h3> What are the symptoms of alcoholism? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are early warning signs of addiction? </h3> </div>
<a>addiction</a> can yield physical changes, but
<a>spiritual</a> or religious practice they once valued.
<div> <h3> Where’s the line between heavy drinking and alcoholism? </h3> </div>
<a>“almost alcoholics,”</a> may not see the connection at first but would often benefit from help and support.
<div> <h3> Why does addiction go undiagnosed? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <div> article continues after advertisement </div> </div> </div>
<h2> Causes and Risk Factors </h2>
<div> <h3> Why do people start drinking? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Is alcoholism genetic? </h3> </div>
<a>depression</a>, someone who is highly impulsive and takes risks, and someone who needs more alcohol than average to experience its effects has a higher likelihood of developing the disorder.
<div> <h3> Can childhood experiences lead to alcoholism? </h3> </div>
<a>Childhood</a> trauma can fuel problematic drinking in adulthood, because the person might use alcohol to cope with feelings of
<a>anger</a>, depression, anxiety,
<a>grief</a>. Compared to people without a drinking problem, men and women who
<a>sought treatment for alcohol addiction had a higher prevalence of childhood trauma</a>, research finds. Furthermore, the greater the abuse or neglect experienced, the more severe their drinking problem was.
<a>Therapy</a> can help people who suffered as a child to address those challenges and develop healthier coping skills.
<h2> The Effects of Alcohol </h2>
<div> <h3> What does alcohol do to the brain? </h3> </div>
<a>concentration</a>, even within the first month of sobriety.
<div> <h3> Does alcohol affect creativity? </h3> </div>
<a>mania</a> or alcohol can enhance creativity is a popular belief. And it turns out there’s some evidence for that idea. Researchers found that participants who had a few drinks were
<a>better and faster at creative problem solving</a> than their sober counterparts. The reason may be that alcohol tamps down working memory and therefore sparks people to think outside the box.
<div> <h3> How does alcohol affect mood? </h3> </div>
<a>stimulant</a> to sedative in line with whether blood alcohol content is rising or falling. Given the power of
<a>alcohol on the brain,</a> people who drink heavily may come to rely on it to regulate their mood.
<div> <h3> What are the health consequences of heavy drinking? </h3> </div>
<a>diet</a> and exercise influenced health outcomes as well.
<h2> Treatment and Recovery </h2>
<p>In some cases, the first step in treating alcohol use disorder is detoxification—experiencing withdrawal in a safe setting with medical professionals. Following withdrawal, there are many paths to recovery.</p>
<p><a>Cognitive behavioral</a>therapy is another path, available in person or online. Non-abstinence-based recovery models—such as Moderation Management—advocate for reducing one's alcohol consumption rather than abstaining completely.</p>
<p>The biggest barrier to therapy of any kind that patients may face is shame and stigma; most programs address such concerns directly.</p>
<div> <h3> What steps can I take to curb my drinking on my own? </h3> </div>
<a>education</a> and support, such as through Alcoholics Anonymous, or take on a sobriety challenge. People can learn
<a>mindfulness</a>; rather than trying to soothe uncomfortable feelings with alcohol, mindfulness encourages techniques such as breathing,
<p>In a clinical setting, motivational interviewing, which cultivates the drive to change behaviors, and Screening, Brief Intervention, Referral, and Treatment (SBIRT), which funnels patients to treatment, are also helpful options.</p>
<div> <h3> What should I look for in an addiction treatment center? </h3> </div>
<p>Find a <a>treatment center</a> using the Psychology Today Therapy Directory. </p>
<div> <h3> Does Alcoholics Anonymous work? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What are the critiques of Alcoholics Anonymous? </h3> </div>
<a>religious ideology rather than scientific principles.</a> Some also disagree with the notion of admitting powerlessness to God or a higher power and completely ceding control, and the belief that
<a>addiction is a disease, a point vigorously debated</a> in the clinical and scientific communities.
<div> <h3> Does moderation rather than abstention work? </h3> </div>
<a>don’t want to abstain entirely.</a> Moderation management or
<div> <h3> Can ketamine treat alcohol use disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>ketamine</a> might help those with severe depression. Research has also targeted
<a>ketamine’s effect on substance and alcohol use:</a> One recent study found that the combination of ketamine and motivational enhancement therapy had higher rates of abstinence, longer time to
<a>relapse</a>, and fewer days of heavy drinking than people who received a control (midazolam). Another found that ketamine could effectively interfere in creating alcohol-related memories.
<div> <h3> What does it mean to be in recovery from alcohol use disorder? </h3> </div>
<a>many forms of treatment</a> available to get there.
<div> <h3> How can people in recovery avoid relapsing? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What helps ensure a long-term recovery? </h3> </div>
<a>help individuals stay in remission.</a> Research in animals shows that having more self-determination and control over one’s environment can help facilitate adaptive brain changes after ending substance use.
