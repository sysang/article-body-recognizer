<a>social anxiety</a> might think, “I feel so awkward at parties. Everyone must think I’m a loser.” This thought may lead to feelings of sadness,
<a>shame</a>, and fear, when then lead to behaviors like isolation and avoidance. CBT can help people learn to identify and challenge distorted thoughts, and then replace them with realistic thoughts, changing the cycle of anxiety.

<p>Is caffeine harming your mental health?</p>
<p>If you follow the trend of drinking strong coffee, energy drinks, and other caffeinated products every day, ask yourself whether it could be harming your mental health:</p>
<li>Is your caffeine consumption toxic: Are you drinking too much caffeine for your body weight every day?</li>
<li>How much caffeine, for you, is too much? Depending on your physiology (e.g. tolerance, weight) this might be far less than 250mg a day.</li>
<li>Do you notice symptoms of caffeine intoxication, <a>addiction</a>, or withdrawal that disturb your psychological or physical functioning?</li>
<li>Have you had psychotic symptoms after consuming caffeine?</li>
<p>If you think that caffeine is harming your mental health, stop or reduce it and speak to your clinician.</p>

<a>confidence</a> they feel can be quite heady, making them less likely to voluntarily seek out treatment for mania/hypomania. One crucial takeaway for those with mania is that

<p>Habit formation is the process by which behaviors become automatic. Habits can form without a person intending to acquire them, but they can also be deliberately cultivated—or eliminated—to better suit one’s personal goals.</p>
<div> <h3> What are examples of habits? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Why do humans have habits? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What causes a habit? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What is a habit loop? </h3> </div>
<a>produce habits</a>. These elements have been called the cue (or trigger), the routine (or behavior), and the reward. For example,
<a>stress</a> could serve as a cue that one responds to by eating,
<a>smoking</a>, or drinking, which produces the reward (the reduction of stress—at least temporarily). The “habit loop” concept was popularized by Charles Duhigg in The Power of Habit.

<h2> How to Build Better Habits </h2>
<div> <h3> What are some ways to build a good habit? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do incentives help build a habit? </h3> </div>
<a>intrinsic motivation</a>—the internal force pushing us to engage in a behavior—is ultimately invaluable,
<a>incentives or rewards may help with habit-building</a> by getting a person to begin to engage in the hoped-for behavior (such as working out) in the first place. 
<div> <h3> How long does it take to build a habit? </h3> </div>
<a>building healthy habits can also take many months</a>.
<div> <h3> Why is it so hard to change bad habits? </h3> </div>
<a>scrutinizing why a bad habit is carried out.</a> Bad habits are also ingrained in the mind due to the rewarding feelings that they bring—or used to bring, when the habit was formed. 
<div> <h3> How do I stop a habit? </h3> </div>
<a>consider why you engage in a bad habit</a>—and what other options there are—may help. So could taking some time to think about
<a>what prompts the bad habit</a> and reevaluating what you get out of it (or don’t). Consider and keep in mind
<a>why you want to make a change</a>, including how the change reflects your values. When a habit is part of an
<a>addiction</a> or other mental health condition, professional treatment may be the best way to achieve change.

<p>Schizophrenia is a serious and chronic mental illness that impairs a person's thoughts and behavior, and if left untreated, can include psychosis. </p>
<a>perimenopause</a> or menopause are thought to be a contributing factor but the mechanism is unclear and has been a source of debate within the field of
<a>psychotic episode</a>) can greatly minimize symptoms and alter the course of the disease, leading to much higher lifetime functioning.
<p>Schizophrenia is typically a chronic condition and people with this diagnosis cope with symptoms throughout life. However, many people with schizophrenia lead rewarding and meaningful lives in their communities. </p>
<p>Positive symptoms refer to the presence of psychotic behaviors not seen in healthy people. People with positive symptoms often "lose touch" with reality. Positive symptoms include the following:</p>
<p>Negative symptoms are associated with disruptions to normal emotions and behaviors. These symptoms are harder to recognize as part of the disorder and can be mistaken for <a>depression</a> or other conditions. These symptoms include the following:</p>
<li>Flat affect (a person's face does not move or they talk in a dull or monotonous voice)</li>
<li>Lack of pleasure in everyday life</li>
<li>Lack of ability to begin and sustain planned activities</li>
<li>Speaking little, even when forced to interact</li>
<p>People with negative symptoms need help with everyday tasks. They often neglect basic personal hygiene. This may make them seem lazy or unwilling to help themselves, but the problems are symptoms caused by the disorder.</p>

<li>Poor <a>executive functioning</a> (the ability to understand information and use it to make decisions)</li>
<li>Trouble focusing or paying <a>attention</a></li>
<li>Problems with working <a>memory</a> (the ability to use information immediately after learning it)</li>
<li>Slower processing speed</li>

<a>teen</a> years and young adulthood can increase the risk of schizophrenia. A growing body of evidence also indicates that
<a>smoking</a> marijuana increases the risk of experiencing psychosis, though this may occur only in those already at high risk due to genetic factors. The younger and more frequent the use, the greater the risk of having a
