<p>In this post, I offer some practical suggestions for navigating this transition from the perspective of work, family, and your wellbeing.</p>
<p>The following are some tips on being efficient and productive while working from home.</p>
<a>meditation</a> if it is part of your routine. It may be tempting to work in your pajamas from your comfy couch or even your bed. However, you may find yourself feeling less motivated to work and more inclined to take a nap.
<li>Continuum: Instead of commuting to work, take a walk around the neighborhood to get your mind out of being-at-home mode and into work mode (while keeping social distance).</li>
<a>productivity</a> and increase anxiety. In order to stay informed without getting stuck, schedule a 15-minute news check for yourself twice a day—once in the morning and once in the evening. If you find yourself feeling
<a>anxious</a> or distracted by searching out information about the virus, see my
<a>previous blog post</a> on dealing with the anxiety of uncertainty.
<p>3. Ask for help: If your oldest child can help supervise the younger one(s), discuss with them how this might work and offer a reward, such as one-on-one time with you, being able to choose a movie to watch, or extra time playing a video game.</p>
<p>6. Accept and manage interruptions: Having a plan will help reduce chaos but will not eliminate interruptions. Kids are kids, after all. You have some options for managing the interruptions:</p>

<li>Finally, accept that working from home will not be peaceful—dogs will bark and kids will walk into your workspace. Let your coworkers know this will happen and remember that the same thing will likely happen to many of them.</li>

<h1> How to Transition to Seeing Your Therapist Online </h1>
<h2> Continue the work of therapy even from a distance. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: agenturfotografin/Adobe Stock</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Seeing a therapist used to imply being in the same room with them, but not any longer. Teleconferencing has made it possible to see a mental health professional from a distance.</p>
<p>With recent requirements for social distancing, many therapists and clients have had to either pause their work or make other arrangements, including meeting by video conference. </p>
<p>I've been providing teletherapy services for about a decade now, and in the past year transitioned to doing only teletherapy. Here are some common questions and issues that come up when thinking about making the transition. </p>
<h3>Will My Therapist Agree to Online Sessions?</h3>
<a>COVID-19</a> outbreak and resulting social distancing. Most therapists generally seem to find that it's a very beneficial approach.
<a>therapy</a> relationship, and to provide continuity of care.
<a>can be very effective</a>, which has also been my clinical experience. It depends on you and your therapist, of course, but in general you should expect it to be helpful if you were finding in-person therapy helpful.
<a>obsessive-compulsive</a> disorder,
<a>insomnia</a>, relationship issues,
<h3>Will Insurance Reimburse Me? </h3>
<a>Doxy</a>, among others. There may be a fee for your therapist to use the technology depending on the service, but it should be free for you (aside from your therapist's session fee, of course).
<div> <div> <h3>THE BASICS</h3> </div> <ul> <li> What Is Therapy? </li> <li> <a>Find a therapist near me</a> </li> </ul> </div>
<h3>How Should I Prepare for My Sessions?</h3>
<p>Some important and finer points about the logistics of teletherapy:</p>
<li>Do a test of the software beforehand for your own peace of mind and to be sure it will work, and verify that you have your therapist's contact information (e.g., VSee username).</li>
<li>Find a place in your home where you'll have as much privacy as possible. This could be a challenge if kids are out of school or other family members are always home (or work from home).</li>
<li>Along those lines, I recommend ear buds for privacy and also better sound quality. That way your therapist's voice won't feed back into your microphone and out their speakers.</li>
<li>Make sure you're sitting somewhere you'll be comfortable for the length of your session.</li>
<li>Have your screen on a stable surface, since excessive movement can create a feeling of seasickness for your therapist. If they're new to teletherapy and their screen is bouncing around, ask them to do the same.</li>
<li>Be sure to close email and turn off notifications that could be distracting and dilute the experience for you. You'll want to have your full <a>attention</a> focused on your session.</li>
<li>Also close programs that could slow down your computer's processing ability and interfere with the quality of the video. </li>
<li>You may also need to work out payment arrangements with your therapist if you generally pay in person. Some therapists will keep a credit card on file for you; others will ask that you mail a check. Find out what they prefer. </li>

<h1> 7 Ways to Use the Current Crisis for Personal Growth </h1>
<h2> Although the pandemic is awful, some good may come from it. </h2>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Virtues for Life, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Let me begin with a question: Could the COVID-19 crisis be seen as a personal growth opportunity? At first blush, you would probably say, “Absolutely no way!”</p>
<a>fear</a>, worry, doubt, frustration, and
<a>confidence</a> in ourselves, our communities, our governments, and the many institutions that we have taken for granted and relied on in the past. COVID-19 tests our resolve,
<a>resilience</a>, and ability to deal with a deluge of daily bad news we read about and listen to every day, both locally and globally. You add up all of these above hardships and challenges and you get a unique “perfect storm” of a crisis.
<p>How can I say that the COVID-19 crisis can be used as a way to grow as a person? Let me explain.</p>
<p>At the heart of the COVID-19 crisis is adversity many multiples more severe and challenging that most adversity that we face in our normal daily lives. And therein lies an incredible opportunity for us to use the current crisis to grow as people.</p>
<p>So, what lessons can you learn from the COVID-19 crisis that will help you grow as a person and serve you well when you are confronted with future crises in your life?</p>
<p>#1: Allow Yourself to Feel Bad</p>
<a>grief</a>, devastation, despair,
<a>anxiety</a>, helplessness, hopelessness, frustration, and anger are just a few of the emotions we feel in response to this unprecedented disruption of our lives.
<a>rationalize</a>, or place blame for the COVID-19 crisis; it is a big deal and it can’t be made smaller than it is or explained away. Rather than resisting negative emotions, be kind and
<a>empathetic</a> to yourself and others; listen to and reflect back the feelings that are there. Allow yourself to go through the five stages of grief:
<a>denial</a>, anger, bargaining,
<a>depression</a>, and acceptance.
<p>#2: Put the Crisis in Perspective</p>
<p>#3: Embrace the Adversity</p>
<p>#4: See the Crisis as a Challenge to Overcome</p>
<p>#5: See the Crisis as an Opportunity</p>
<a>social life</a>. Finally, and most importantly, you can take action. When you don’t succumb to a victim mentality, you decrease your feelings of hopelessness and helplessness and increase your sense of competence, feelings of control, and
<p>#6: Have a Positive Attitude</p>
<p>By embracing the recommendations I offer about the COVID-19 crisis, it lays the foundation for hope, optimism, and a positive attitude and approach to it that will help you weather the storm from which there is little protection or escape.</p>
<p>#7: Generate Positive Emotions</p>
<a>pessimism</a> that the COVID-19 crisis can produce in us.
<a>career</a>, and continuing your efforts to be the best person you can, despite this substantial interruption, all are ripe for harvesting good feelings that you can use to counteract the bad feelings that you are vulnerable to every day of this crisis.
<p>Be safe, be calm, be positive (my COVID-19 motto). This is one thing you can spread that will help people be physically and psychologically healthier. </p>

<p>In the very dark cloud of the coronavirus pandemic, it is hard to find a silver lining. One positive glimmer, however, has recently come to my <a>attention</a>.</p>
<p>For these individuals, the pandemic brought about renewed contact with a relative after years, and sometimes decades, of estrangement.</p>
<a>book</a>). I learned that one of the major reasons for bridging a family rift was a nagging sense of anticipated regret.
<a>motivation</a> for action. When people are faced with difficult decisions, a critical factor for many is the regret they think they may feel in the future for an action taken or not taken now.

<h1> How to Help Older Adults Fight Loneliness During COVID-19 </h1>

<blockquote> <p>“We are a social species. Our social networks (families, tribes, communities, etc.) enabled us to survive and thrive.”</p> </blockquote>
<p>—Clifford Singer (2018)</p>
<a>COVID-19</a> outbreak has left many people more alone than they’ve been in a long time, or ever.
<p>When you stay in place without your family and friends, when you are forced to keep a social distance from all your coworkers, will you feel isolated? Rejected? Disconnected from society? How does it mentally affect you?</p>
<h3>Why the Elderly? What Does Research Show Us?</h3>
<a>depression</a>. Physiologically, loneliness and long-term social distancing can decrease someone’s ability to fight infection and inflammation. The
<a>anxiety</a> which loneliness causes can lead to a change in white blood cells as well, creating more issues for older adults.
<p>Social isolation is a method to improve public health, but how can we combat the adverse effects of social isolation, especially in the elderly at this time of the COVID-19 lockdown?</p>

<h1> How to Connect Meaningfully in a Virtual Meeting </h1>
<h2> 10 guidelines to promote meaningful connections in a time of social distancing </h2>
<a>high-quality connection</a>.”
<a>human moment</a>.” Harvard psychiatrist Edward Hallowell coined this term, saying that a human moment requires two ingredients: physical co-presence and focused
<a>attention</a>. The first ingredient is not possible when we are socially distancing. Is it possible to create virtual human moments?
<p>Here are 10 guidelines to promote meaningful connections in your virtual meetings. These guidelines are platform agnostic. They work in whatever platform you choose—Zoom, Skype, Blue Jeans, Google Hangouts, WebEx, and so on.</p>
<h3>Guideline #1: Video On</h3>
<a>pets</a>, read something, or whatever. Video on is a necessary ingredient for meaningful connections.
<h3>Guideline #2: Active Facilitation</h3>
<h3>Guideline #3: Acknowledge Reality</h3>
<a>empathy</a>. It shows that we are all in this together.
<h3>Guideline #4: Gentle Mandatory Participation</h3>
<a>extroverts</a> in the group will speak up, and the
<a>introverts</a> will just listen.
<h3>Guideline #5: Introductions</h3>
<h3>Guideline #6: Make it Personal </h3>
<p>Of course, there are countless ways to make it personal. You don’t have to think them up yourself. Engage the group. Ask everyone for suggestions about how to make it personal in your upcoming virtual meetings.</p>
<h3>Guideline #7: Learn Something New</h3>
<p>There’s a wealth of knowledge and experience in your group. Have participants share their passions, hobbies, pastimes, and knowledge with the group. Learning something new together.</p>
<h3>Guideline #8: Enable Chat in Big Meetings</h3>
<p>From time to time, the facilitator (or leader) should pause to respond to a chat comment or question. If it’s not possible to cover everything, you can capture and save the chat, responding after the virtual meeting is over.</p>
<h3>Guideline #9: Team Practices</h3>
<a>leadership</a> team cover the three points but also a fourth: Here’s something I recently learned. Because the team wants to be a learning organization, this fourth point makes learning a part of the standup.
<h3>Guideline #10. Experiment</h3>

<h2> New research helps explain how to get the spark back—and keep it. </h2>

<p>Social distancing and stay-at-home orders stemming from the COVID-19 <a>coronavirus</a> pandemic have prompted a slew of social media posts and popular media articles talking about the challenges these orders pose for our intimate lives. </p>
<p>For example, it’s easy to find articles talking about how couples are getting <a>sick of each other</a> and how there’s going to be a <a>post-COVID divorce boom</a>.</p>
<a>Kinsey Institute</a> are in the midst of conducting a long-term study on how this pandemic is affecting our sex lives and relationships.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Promescent, used with permission</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>In our first wave of data collection, we surveyed thousands of adults about the impacts they’ve experienced, and we did indeed find that a lot of people said their intimate lives had taken a hit since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>Specifically, 44% of participants said their sex life had declined recently, while 30% said the same of their romantic life.</p>
<p>However, it’s not all doom and gloom in the bedroom. At the same time, we found that 14% said their sex life had actually improved, and that 23% reported that their relationship was in a better place, too.</p>
<p>What this tells us is that, while this situation is certainly challenging and many are struggling, it’s also creating new opportunities to change our intimate lives for the better. </p>
<p>So how can you take advantage of the current situation to give your sex and love life a boost?</p>
<p>Here are four suggestions for getting the spark back in your relationship—and keeping it going through the pandemic and beyond.</p>
<p>1. Try New Things in the Bedroom</p>
<p>Human beings are <a>inherently turned on by novelty and newness</a> when it comes to sex. We grow <a>bored</a> of <a>sexual</a> routines easily—and it’s easier than ever to feel like you’re in a rut right now.</p>
<p>We can’t even leave our homes except to go grab some essentials, so it’s natural to feel some pent-up demand for something fresh, new, interesting, and exciting.</p>
<p>You can channel this need for novelty by trying new bedroom activities with your partner that you’ve always wanted to explore.</p>
<p>In our study, we found that 1 in 5 adults said they’ve made a new addition to their sex life since the pandemic began. Among the many things people reported trying were:</p>
<ul><li>Having sex in a new position or location at home</li> <li>Filming themselves having sex</li> <li>Trying a remote-controlled sex toy</li> <li>Sharing and/or acting on a sexual fantasy that they’ve never explored before </li> </ul>
<p>The people who made new additions were more likely to say that both their sex life and their relationship had improved.</p>
<p>In fact, those who tried new things were three times more likely to report improvements in the bedroom than those who didn’t make any new additions.</p>
<a>fantasies</a> you’ve never shared before.
<p>What you do doesn't matter as much as finding something that’s new and comfortable for both of you.</p>
<p>2. Find Ways to Manage Stress and Cultivate Desire</p>
<p>It’s normal to feel <a>stressed</a>, <a>anxious</a>, and on edge right now. There’s a lot of uncertainty in the world, and the news is far more depressing than uplifting.</p>
<p>If your mind (or your partner’s mind) is preoccupied with pandemic-related thoughts, that’s going to make it harder to not only get in the mood for sex but also to enjoy sexual activity. And our data supports this.</p>
<p>The more worried and stressed out participants reported feeling, the less sexually active they were and the more they said the pandemic had taken a toll on their intimate life.</p>
<p>This points to the importance of finding ways to cope with stress effectively so that you and your partner can cultivate desire—and open the door to trying those new things we talked about above.</p>
<p>Some might find it helpful to:</p>
<ul><li>Incorporate <a>meditation</a> or <a>mindfulness</a> techniques into daily life</li> <li>Disconnect from news, email, and social media to clear the mind</li> <li>Exercise, take a long bath, or give each other massages</li> </ul>
<div> <article> <div> <h3> <a>What to Do When Partners Want Different Amounts of Sex</a> </h3> </div> </article> <article> <div> <h3> <a>10 Reasons Why Some Couples Stop Having Sex</a> </h3> </div> </article> </div>
<p>Figure out forms of self-care that work for both of you so that you have some opportunities to be relaxed, in the moment, and focused on each other rather than on the pandemic.</p>
<p>3. Have a Romantic Date Night at Home</p>
<p>With restaurants, bars, movie theaters, and other popular date night destinations temporarily closed, it might seem like the idea of having a romantic evening together is far-fetched.</p>
<p>However, there’s no reason that you can’t still have a satisfying date night at home. It just takes a little effort and creativity.</p>
<p>Putting in some effort to look good will help to enhance your sexual appeal to your partner, while also showing them that you care.</p>
<p>The options are endless, and with a little <a>creative thinking</a>, you can craft a relaxing—or exciting—evening (depending on what you’re looking for) to fit any budget.</p>
<p>Making It Successful. Take care to minimize distractions during your date night so that you can be focused on each other, which probably means putting the phones and laptops away temporarily and making sure the kids are off to bed.</p>
<p>Whatever you opt to do, the key is to use this as an opportunity to disconnect from stress and reconnect with your partner.</p>
<p>4. Remember...What Comes After Sex Matters Too</p>
<p><a>Research finds that</a> couples who engage in more after-sex affection — think spooning, cuddling, and intimate conversation — tend to be more satisfied with their sex lives and relationships.</p>
<p>With rates of sexual activity down right now, these post-sex activities might be more important than ever for helping to sustain an intimate connection.</p>
<p>This kind of intimate touch releases the <a>hormone</a> <a>oxytocin</a>, which promotes feelings of bondedness and connection. </p>
<p>So, touching each other after sex can quite literally help you to stay in touch and could potentially be helpful in terms of cultivating more sexual desire and satisfaction during a challenging time.</p>
<p>In this time of social distancing and isolation, our intimate lives are facing unprecedented tests, and many people feel as though their sex lives and relationships are in decline.</p>
<a>intimacy</a> that has the potential to not only help us get through this pandemic, but also to strengthen our relationships for the long haul.

<p>Practice <a>Empathy</a> for Different Coping Strategies</p>
<p>Consider this quote (source unknown): “The first thing you should know about me is that I am not you. A lot more will make sense after that.”</p>
<a>gender</a>, temperament, life experiences, family dynamics, and
<a>neurotic</a>” and the more concerned partner may fire back, “You don’t get how serious this is! You’re in
<p>Anticipate Flare-Ups in Mental Health Challenges</p>
<a>depression</a> (and those of us who love them!) to anticipate a worsening of symptoms during this time of upheaval. Knowing that might happen can go a long way toward helping us cope if it does. Use these prompts to develop an emotional first aid plan:
<ul><li>When my symptoms worsen, something my partner can do to support me is….</li> <li>When my partner’s symptoms worsen, something that helps me feel more patient is…</li> </ul>
<p>Remember that you’ve gotten through mental health challenges before. Don't forget to validate your suffering. Offering yourself some compassion can help you tap into your <a>resilience</a>.</p>
<p>Speak With Kindness. Or Just Don’t Speak.</p>
<a>risk taking</a> my icky feelings out on you. I’m going to step away for a bit.” Use that distance to shift yourself from upset to calm. Here are two strategies that can help:
<li>Write down three things you are grateful for. Research has found that <a>gratitude</a> journaling can improve mood and support a sense of well-being (Emmons McCullough, 2003).</li>

<a>coronavirus</a>. Additionally, there is currently no evidence that companion animals could be a source of infection to people.”
<a>according to the WSAVA</a>. (You can see their
<a>latest advice for pet owners here</a>).
<a>medication</a> they might need, and supplies such as pet food, cat litter, cleaning supplies, pee pads, and so on (e.g. the
<a>BC SPCA’s disaster plan checklist for pets</a>).
<p>You may wish to check or increase those supplies. Think about any medication your pet needs and make sure you have a good supply, as well as pet food and any other supplies you might need in case you have to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Veterinarian Adrian Walton of Dewdney Animal Hospital <a>told CTV News Vancouver</a>,</p>
<p>Check with a friend, family member, or neighbour who could care for your pet in case you have to be in the hospital, and have a backup just in case they get sick too.</p>
<a>advice from the AVMA on COVID-19 and veterinary care</a>.
<p>What if we have to self-isolate?</p>
<a>from the Canadian government</a> is "avoid contact with pets if you live with other people that may also be touching them."
<p>If you have COVID-19, you should avoid close contact with your pets, and have another member of your household look after them if possible. The Canadian government has <a>this advice:</a></p>
<p>"As a precautionary measure, if you have COVID-19 symptoms or are self-isolating due to contact with a COVID-19 case, you should follow similar recommendations around animals, as you would around people in these circumstances:</p>
<li>avoid close contact with animals during your illness <ul><li>practise good handwashing and avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals</li> <li>do not visit farms or have contact with livestock</li> </ul></li>
<li>if possible, have another member of your household care for your animals <ul><li>if this is not possible, always wash your hands before and after touching animals, their food and supplies and practise good cough and sneezing etiquette</li> </ul></li>
<li>limit your animal's contact with other people and animals outside the household until your illness is resolved</li>
<p><a>The CDC advice</a> is similar:</p>
<p>If you must care for your pet or be around animals while you are sick, wash your hands before and after you interact with pets and wear a cloth face covering.”</p>
<a>scent</a> games will help. There are some more ideas for
<a>keeping your dog entertained indoors</a> and
