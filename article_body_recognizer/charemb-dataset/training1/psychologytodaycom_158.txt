<li>Research suggests that people who are high in narcissism are more likely to believe in astrology, possibly to confirm their own specialness.</li>
<li>The trait of agreeableness has also been linked to a belief in astrology.</li>
<h3>Discredited forms of knowledge remain popular.</h3>
<a>marriage</a> and divorce in over 500,000 individuals from 1968 to 2001 found no evidence that the compatibility of a couple’s star signs had any effect on whether they stayed married or eventually
<a>intelligence</a> and made the novel discovery that people who believe in astrology tend to be more narcissistic
<a>(Andersson et al., 2022). </a>Surprisingly, the study also found that believers also tended to be higher in
<a>agreeableness</a>, despite there being an inverse relationship between
<a>narcissism</a> and agreeableness.

<a>Big Five</a> personality traits, a short measure of narcissism, and an intelligence test based on visual-spatial reasoning. Belief in astrology was positively correlated with believing that it is scientific, higher
<a>openness to experience</a>, agreeableness, and narcissism, and lower intelligence. To test which of these factors related to a belief in astrology were most important, they ran a statistical model comparing all of these factors, as well as age and
<a>sex</a>, at once. This model showed that belief in astrology was associated with each of the following: female sex, being older, belief that astrology is scientific, higher levels of both agreeableness and narcissism, and lower
<a>extraversion</a> and intelligence. (Openness to experience was no longer a significant factor in the model.)

<a>Gecewicz, 2018</a>) as well as paranormal and magical phenomena more generally (
<a>Allum, 2011</a>). However, that narcissism and agreeableness were each independently associated with astrology belief appears to be a novel finding.

<a>O’Boyle et al., 2015</a>). Agreeableness is a prosocial trait that is associated with concern for others, helpfulness, and kindness. I, therefore, find it intriguing that it too was positively associated with a belief in astrology.
<a>spirituality</a> (e.g., “I see life as a journey toward fulfilment”) (
<a>Chang et al., 2015</a>). Another study found that people who rated themselves higher in “
<a>spiritual intelligence</a>” (e.g., belief that they could influence others spiritually) tended to be higher in agreeableness (
<a>Furnham Buchanan, 2005</a>). Studies have also found that belief in astrology is associated with religious belief (e.g., in God or some kind of spiritual presence) (
<a>Bauer Durant, 1997</a>); hence, people high in agreeableness who are religious might find astrology compatible with their worldview.

<h1> Attachment, Emotional Intelligence, and Adulting </h1>
<h2> How can we regulate big emotions? </h2>
<p> Posted December 29, 2021 </p>
<li>Emotional regulation does not necessarily mean feeling in control of one's emotions at all times. </li>
<li>People who experience big emotions may feel underregulated, but they can become regulated through recognizing and articulating feeling states.</li>
<li>People who can't tolerate uncomfortable emotions may unconsciously enact defense mechanisms such as deflection and detachment.</li>
<p>Many people assume that emotional regulation equates to pristine control over one’s emotions. For example, they presume an <a>emotionally intelligent</a> person rarely loses her temper or gets emotional. Yet, this is far from true.</p>
<a>attachment</a> theory. Infants and toddlers who experience a secure attachment with a
<a>caregiver</a> more easily recognize, identify, and articulate feeling states as they progress through
<a>empathic</a> listener to help her talk it out. Unpacking uncomfortable internal conflict usually leads to understanding, insight, and self-awareness.

<p>Sample: 40 female college students; average age of 24 years old.</p>
<li>Body self-esteem: The body self-esteem scale was used to measure feelings about appearance, satisfaction with weight, and evaluations attributed to others (e.g., assuming others like/dislike one’s looks).</li>
<li>Real body measurements: weight, height, waist width, and hip width were calculated.</li>
<h3>How we truly see our face and body</h3>
<p>Analysis of data found self-portraits and self-beliefs were correlated:</p>

<h1> Perception and the Unreliability of Episodic Memory </h1>
<h2> Episodic memory may improve perception despite its imperfections. </h2>
<li>Recent studies suggest that repeated replays of personal (or episodic) memories may improve our perceptual capacities.</li>
<li>Other data have shown that episodic memories are highly prone to error and distortion.</li>
<li>The unreliability of episodic memory may seem at odds with its ability to fine-tune our perceptual capacities.</li>
<li>Less error-prone, episodic memories related to dreams, hyper-focus, and expertise may play a special role in fine-tuning our perception.</li>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: George Milton/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<a>memory</a> templates you use to determine the
<a>identity</a> of what you are looking at in your surroundings (Brogaard Sørensen, in press).
<h3>The Unreliability of Episodic Memory</h3>
<p>A large body of literature has shown that episodic memories are highly prone to errors, distortions, and other imperfections (see e.g., Schacter, 1999).</p>
<a>Traumatic</a> experiences tend to lead to a narrowing of our
<a>attention</a> (Easterbrook, 1959; Christianson Loftus, 1991). During a car crash, for example, you are likely to focus more intensely on certain details while ignoring others. Later you may be unable to recall many details about the car crash.
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Alexandr/Podvalny</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>This constructive process can easily introduce memory errors. While piecing together memory fragments, the brain often incorporates erroneous information, which can result in vivid but inaccurate recollections of what actually happened.</p>
<h3>Solving the Puzzle of Memory and Perception</h3>
<p>But if recollections of episodes in our past are highly prone to errors and distortions, how can repeated recall help improve our ability to visually distinguish between items in our surroundings?</p>
<p>Or to put it differently: If epistemic memory is highly imperfect, why don't repeated replays of our episodic memories worsen rather than improve our perceptual capacities?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Matheus Bertelli/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Unlike deliberate recollections of episodes from our past, replays of episodic information during dream sleep haven't been shown to be particularly prone to errors or distortions.</p>
<p>This suggests a testable hypothesis: Involuntary replays of episodic information during dream sleep may play a greater role in fine-tuning our perceptual capacities than our deliberate recollections of episodes from our past.</p>
<h3>Hyper-Focus May Improve Memory</h3>
<p>Another way to explain how episodic memory can improve our perceptual capacities despite its general imperfection is to look closer at the role attention plays in laying down memories.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Pixabay/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>This leads to a second testable hypothesis: Replays of episodic details we hyper-focused on during a traumatic event may play a greater role in fine-tuning our perceptual capacities than replays of episodic details we didn't pay much attention to.</p>
<h3>Expertise May Improve Memory</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <div>Source: Tina Nord/Pexels</div> </div> </div> </div>
<p>These three hypotheses are all compatible with the finding that episodic memory generally is highly unreliable (cf. Brogaard Sørensen, in press).</p>

<h3>Look for Ways to Address Children's Individual Strengths and Challenges</h3>
<h3>Provide Ongoing Assessment</h3>

<a>the gender binary</a>. When people who do not identify as male or female follow “traditional” masculine or feminine behaviors and routines anyway, because of reluctance or

<h1> Why Intelligence Is So Sexy to So Many, and When It isn't </h1>
<h2> Sapiosexuality and its cultural stereotypes. </h2>
<p>“An intellectual is a person who's found one thing that's more interesting than sex.” —Aldous Huxley</p>
<p>A “sapiosexual” is someone who is attracted to intelligence. What is so appealing about intelligence? And, why are librarians perceived as sexy while philosophers are not?</p>
<p>Intelligence as a valuable capacity</p>
<p>“And all I need now is intellectual intercourse, A soul to dig the hole much deeper.” <a>—Alanis Morissette</a></p>
<a>marriage</a> was associated with the expectation of a partner being smarter than approximately two-thirds of the general population (see also Persaud Bruggen, 2018).
<p>The decline in <a>attraction</a> at extreme levels of intelligence remains an open question: Social competence difficulties attributed to people with such high intelligence may be a factor.</p>
<p>“I date men and women and identify as bisexual, and I realized the thing that linked all people that I have dated has been their brains.” —Nichi Hodgson</p>
<p>“In my sex fantasy, nobody ever loves me for my mind.” —Nora Ephron</p>
<p>Despite what the word sounds like, sapiosexuality is not a <a>sexual orientation</a> as heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality; it is a preferential attitude in choosing a partner. </p>
<a>Raab</a> (2014) further claims that “Perhaps the most intriguing thing about sapiosexual, something that might strike us as modern and open-minded, is that it removes
<a>identity</a> as well as looks from the equation of romantic attraction.”
<p>Stereotypes of sexy librarians and nerdy philosophers</p>
<p>"Philosophical discussion is my foreplay." —A LiveJournal user known as “wolfieboy," who invented the term “sapiosexual”</p>
<p>“Librarians are featured in the sexual fantasies of so many people. After all, the brain is the most important sex organ in the body…. Librarians, in my experience, are often both smart and sexy.” —Bix Warden</p>
<a>quiz</a> entitled, “How much of a
<a>philosophy</a> nerd are you?" states: “There are many smart people in the world, and the smartest are philosophers.”
<p>Of course, these generalizations—like all generalizations—miss the boat on many people (an opinion I hold not only as a philosopher but also personally). They do make it ashore, though, when we take into account prevailing stereotypes. </p>
<p>Why intelligence is so sexually attractive?</p>
<p>“His high IQ and <a>EQ</a> makes for incredible lovemaking and deep conversations. I feel like I’m falling in love with a brilliant dark-haired Einstein!” —A married woman about her lover</p>
<a>cooperation</a> from strangers than their run-of-the-mill friends.
<a>sense of humor</a>, and social status, make people seem more attractive. Sex appeal is influenced by qualities like wealth, sense of humor, class, and race.
