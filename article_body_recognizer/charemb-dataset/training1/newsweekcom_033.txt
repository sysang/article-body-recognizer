<p>And yes, it seems that understanding does exist.</p>
<p>Bowl games tend to have some sort of element of community involvement, and the Cotton Bowl is no exception. Alabama and Cincinnati were both assigned a hospital to visit in an effort to boost spirits for patients.</p>
<p>This week, those visits are happening virtually. Just in case.</p>

<p>Sex and the City costume designer Patricia Field has shared a less-than-flattering assessment of actress Cynthia Nixon's sartorial prowess.</p>
<p>Two-time Emmy winner Field served as an integral part of the original Sex and the City series, as well as the two spinoff movies, with her costume choices for the glamorous characters inspiring fans and fashion designers alike.</p>
<p>In an interview with Britain's The Sunday Times, Field shared her feelings on the new show, which she was unable to work on as she was already contracted to the Netflix series Emily in Paris, which is filmed in the French capital.</p>
<p>After suggesting that Molly Rogers, who worked with her on the original show, take her place on the reboot, Field told the newspaper of the looks she's seen: "I like some of it, I don't like all of it, but I know what Molly's dealing with."</p>
<p>"Well, I know those gals!" Field added, as she expanded on her statement. "Sarah Jessica thinks she knows everything—and she does.</p>
<p>"Cynthia Nixon thinks she knows everything—and she doesn't! Even today, when I speak with Molly, it's about Cynthia. I say, 'I remember what you are going through.'"</p>
<p>Newsweek has contacted a representative of Nixon for comment.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in her interview with The Sunday Times, she spoke of <a>Kim Cattrall</a>, with whom she is closest "socially" of the original Sex and the City stars.</p>
<p>With Cattrall not reprising her role as sex-positive publicist Samantha Jones in the reboot <a>after a public falling out with co-star Parker</a>, Field said of her absence: "It is a vacuum. I hear it everywhere. Everyone is mad she won't be in it."</p>
<p>In the premiere episode of And Just Like That..., <a>Cattrall's character's absence was explained early on</a>, with conversations between the characters revealing Samantha had relocated from New York City to London for work.</p>
<p>Field told the New York Post that she would happily work on a spinoff project with Cattrall, enthusing earlier this month: "I would love to do a show with her."</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that she's taking sides in the feud between Parker and Cattrall, as she has known the former since the mid 1990s.</p>
<p>She told the newspaper: "I knew Sarah Jessica from before [the show] because we did this film down in Miami called Miami Rhapsody, and basically, that's how I got the job on Sex and the City."</p>
<header><div> <a>Tech Science</a></div><h1>Comet Leonard Seen Speeding Through Sky in Once-in-a-Lifetime NASA Images</h1><div> By Robert Lea <time>On 12/22/21 at 10:56 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>Two sun-observing spacecrafts have caught a glimpse of Comet Leonard as it heads for a close encounter with our star on January 3, 2022.</p>
<p>The comet, also known as C/2021 A1, is the brightest object of its type to be seen over the skies of Earth in 2021, and spotting it has been a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for skywatchers.</p>
<a>predicts it will be heading out of the solar system</a> altogether.
<p>The first spacecraft to spot Comet Leonard as it undertook the final stages of its 40,000 year-long journey from the edge of the solar system to our star was <a>NASA</a>'s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A (STEREO).</p>
<a>Solar Orbiter</a> spacecraft, Comet Leonard can be seen streaking diagonally past the craft's view of the
<a>Milky Way.</a> Also visible in the video shot by the craft, which launched in February 2020, is Venus which the comet made a close passage to over December 17 and 18.
<p>In the video shot on December 17 and produced by the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI), Venus can be seen moving from left to right as the Solar Orbiter shifts into a side-on view of the comet, thus revealing more of its tail.</p>
<p>Comet Leonard will be tracked by SoloHI until it moves out of the instrument's field of view at some point on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Comet Leonard is <a>currently undergoing outbursts of brightness </a>that seem to be ice and dust being liberated from the comet's nucleus by the heat of the sun, which could even be causing large chunks of material to be blown away.</p>
<p>NASA says that if the comet survives its close encounter with our star it will be flung into the solar system never to return, echoing the opinion of Leonard, who discovered the comet in January this year.</p>
