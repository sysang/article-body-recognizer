<header><div> Newsweek Magazine</div><h1>How to Keep Learning At Every Stage of Your Life</h1><div>By Boris Groysberg and Robin Abrahams <time> On 12/29/21 at 7:00 AM EST </time></div> </header>
<p>Here's how to take advantage of the key factors at each stage of life.</p>
<p>The most necessary risk is the failure inherent in learning. Failing in front of peers is particularly painful for early adults. This can lead to a default tendency to maintain appearances at the cost of actual learning.</p>
<p>Develop learning-friendly habits—sleep, exercise and diet, along with meditation, spending time outdoors, journaling or some other reflective exercise.</p>
<p>If you think you may have dyslexia, attention deficit disorder or any other learning disability or disorder, try to get tested while you are still in the educational system.</p>
<p>Get in the habit of forming cross-generational friendships, a spur to learning that will become increasingly important over time.</p>
<p>If possible, get a neuropsychological assessment at this point to serve as a baseline of your personal "normal." Any age- or injury-related impairments later on can be assessed more accurately if you have this.</p>
<p>Late Adulthood (60+): Prune and Graft People are living, working and learning longer. Still, aging takes a toll. The biological mechanisms of learning (attention, memory, reasoning, executive function) naturally decline.</p>
<p>Tips for Late Adulthood One of the best ways to "prune and graft" is to combine physical exercise with mental activity—games, dance, tai chi, "forest bathing." Engaging the mind and body at the same time has a multiplicative effect.</p>
<p>Push back on negative stereotypes of aging and the elderly, both in society at large in terms of any internalized beliefs you might have.</p>
<p>Continue to plan future activities and projects. These do not have to be grand, ambitious undertakings, but a sense of meaningful forward motion is crucial in later life.</p>
<p>Conclusion Continual learning is a central aspect of who we are as a species. It is good for our bodies, our brains and our communities.</p>

<header><div> My Turn</div><h1>'I Was The Limo Driver in 'Die Hard''</h1><div> De'voreaux White <time> On 12/24/21 at 4:16 AM EST </time></div> </header>
<p>It's usually around this time of year that people start to say, "I've seen you somewhere before!" It's not all the time, but it happens and I'm always surprised, because it was 33 years ago that I played Argyle in Die Hard.</p>
<p>The scene at the airport where I had the sign and my shades on was then hilarious for me, because it was my character's first day on the job, but we had already done the scene in the car so I was in the groove of acting.</p>
<p>All I knew about Alan Rickman was that he was from England. He just seemed like this dude. Some actors are very focused on what they need to do, and he was just a technician; very focused.</p>

<header><div> My Turn</div><h1>'I Own an Underground Hobbit Home, a Tree House and a Giant Potato Hotel'</h1><div> Kristie Wolfe <time> On 12/27/21 at 11:32 AM EST </time></div> </header>
<p>When I was 28, I built my first tiny house. It was in the early 2000s at the beginning of the tiny home movement. Mine was not fancy at all, it was just a shed I built for around $3,000.</p>
<h2>Building a Hawaiian tree house</h2>
<h2>An underground hobbit hole and a retired fire lookout</h2>
<p>When we were building the tree house my mom kept grumbling about being up on ladders, so I told her that my next property project would be inside a hill. As a result, after the treehouse, came the hobbit home.</p>
<h2>Turning a potato into a hotel</h2>
<p>I still live in a tiny house, though it's not the original one. I built another one from a tiny house plan on the same land as the potato and the cow. I love that cow so much!</p>

<p>Eventually she gave in and got my headshots, but she thought nothing was going to come of it. A month later, I got a part in an American Playhouse TV movie called A Matter of Principle with Alan Arkin, playing one of his daughters.</p>
<p>Macaulay was still a kid though, he was completely the same and I remember going to hang out with him and his siblings who were all staying at a hotel in Chicago. His little brother Kieran Culkin was the cutest; I loved him.</p>
<p>I didn't end up placing but I enjoyed it a lot, and afterwards I finally moved up to the under 52kg weight class. But I tore my ACL in 1998, which required surgery, so the chances of recovering and making it to the next Olympics were slim.</p>
<p>There are people who have known me for years and have no idea about the movie stuff and I could just pretend that it didn't happen. But being a child actor and then an Olympic athlete is who I am. Now, I feel I'm able to appreciate it.</p>
<p>Hillary Wolf Saba is a former child actor and Olympian living in Colorado with her family.</p>

<p>The sixth day of deliberations is set to begin in the trial of former entrepreneur Elizabeth Holmes.</p>
<p>The transcript of the hearing has been sealed and further details will not be publicly disclosed. Despite this, speculation has been made that the hearing involved discussions of potential plea agreements. However, this has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<a>NPR</a>. "Whereas here, running a startup, trying to develop a new technology for blood testing, that's all very legal. The question becomes 'what were you thinking when you were doing these things?' And that's really hard to get to."
<p>The eight men and four women on the jury have been meeting in a San Jose, California, federal courthouse after absorbing reams of evidence in a three-month trial that captivated Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The jurors haven't provided any clues as to how far along they are in their deliberations during their first two days of ongoing discussions this week.</p>
<p>The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p>
<header><div> News</div><h1>Nearly 5M New COVID Cases Reported Globally Last Week, Americas See Biggest Jump</h1><div> By Erin Brady <time>On 12/29/21 at 11:09 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<p>COVID-19 cases increased by 11 percent last week, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>The United States, in particular, reported more than 1.18 million cases during the time period. Canada had the second-highest amount of cases with 78,847, while Argentina came in third place with 65,966 new infections.</p>
<p>The WHO recently warned that Europe could continue to face surging infections.</p>
<a>The Guardian</a>, "even if combined with a slightly milder disease, will still result in large numbers of hospitalizations, particularly amongst unvaccinated groups, and cause widespread disruption to health systems and other critical services."
<p>WHO also published new updates on the current status of the Omicron coronavirus variant in their report.</p>
<p>However, there is further evidence that, despite its high infection rate, Omicron might not be as severe as other forms of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The next report published by WHO will cover "only the global and regional epidemiology."</p>
<p>The gain in global cases followed a gradual increase since October.</p>
<p>Reported new cases in Africa were up 7 percent to nearly 275,000.</p>
<p>WHO said that the number of newly reported deaths worldwide last week was down 4 percent to 44,680.</p>
<header><div> News</div><h1>France Doubles Down on Vaccination Pass as Country Reports 208K New COVID Cases</h1><div> By Zoe Strozewski <time>On 12/29/21 at 11:41 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> News Coronavirus <a>France</a></div>
<p>France's government is speeding up introduction of a new health pass measure that would allow only fully vaccinated people to enter public venues like restaurants, cinemas, theaters and sports facilities.</p>
<p>Health Minister Olivier Véran defended the vaccine measure on Wednesday and urged people who have not yet gotten a booster shot to "protect yourself in the coming days."</p>
<p>"There is really little chance that this time you can escape [COVID-19]. The virus is spreading too fast," he said, speaking to the unvaccinated.</p>
<p>The pass will also be required on long-distance trains and domestic flights.</p>
<p>Véran said that in Paris public hospitals, 70 percent of people hospitalized in intensive care units aren't vaccinated.</p>
<p>He also advised the most vulnerable people who didn't get the vaccine booster shot yet to "protect yourself in the coming days. Don't take risks."</p>
<p>The speeded-up introduction of the so-called vaccine pass forms part of a government strategy to use vaccinations, rather than new lockdowns, to try to soften the impact of the Omicron variant on already overburdened hospitals.</p>
<p>France has vaccinated 77 percent of its population and is rushing out booster shots, again to combat Omicron. But more than 4 million adults remain unvaccinated, including more than 1 million people over 65.</p>
<p>The bill provides for an exception to the pass—notably to take trains and planes—for people with family or health emergencies, on the condition that they are able to present a negative test.</p>
<p>Those who aren't vaccinated but have proof of a recent COVID-19 recovery will be able to get a vaccine pass limited to six months following infection.</p>
<p>Last month, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said a trial could take place sometime between September and December 2022.</p>
<p>Brettler and Lerner said any progression toward a trial, including depositions of Andrew and Giuffre, should be halted until the court can definitively determine Giuffre's place of residence and if she should be allowed to file a lawsuit in the U.S.</p>
<p>Giuffre filed the suit in August, claiming Andrew abused her multiple times in 2001.</p>
<p>In October, the defense said the lawsuit should be thrown out because they maintained Andrew's innocence and accused Giuffre of suing him "to achieve another payday at his expense and at the expense of those closest to him."</p>
<p>The lawyers acknowledged that Giuffre may well be a victim of sexual abuse by financier <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who killed himself in 2019 while awaiting a sex trafficking trial.</p>
<p>They asked the judge to order Giuffre to respond to written legal requests about her residency and submit to a two-hour deposition on the issue.</p>
<p>The lawyers wrote that Giuffre has an Australian driver's license and was living in a $1.9 million home in Perth, Western Australia, where she has been raising three children with her husband, who is Australian.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment from Giuffre to the latest filing by the prince's lawyers was sent to a spokesperson for her lawyers by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they choose to come forward publicly, as Giuffre has.</p>
<header><div> News</div><h1>Delta CEO Letter to CDC Resurfaces After Cutting of Isolation Time Raises Questions</h1><div> By Darragh Roche <time>On 12/29/21 at 6:14 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<a>should now isolate for five days instead of 10</a>, citing scientific evidence that people are most infectious two days before they develop symptoms and three days afterward.
<p>The timing of Delta Airlines' letter and the CDC's decision has led to speculation on social media that the two are connected, with some <a>Twitter</a> users criticizing the CDC.</p>
<p>Author Don Winslow tweeted on Tuesday, tagging the CDC and Walensky: "You don't work for Delta Airlines. You should not do what its CEO ask you to do."</p>
<p>Twitter user Aaron Lockhart shared the letter and commented, in part, "When powerful corporate interests ask, they receive."</p>
<p>The letter to Walensky is available on Delta Airlines' website and the airline also issued a statement on December 21 explaining the letter and the request to shorten the isolation period.</p>
<p>"The request comes after analysis by medical experts of data that indicates the Omicron variant has a shorter incubation and infectious period among those who are fully vaccinated against the virus," Delta's statement said.</p>
<p>That statement also noted that Ting and Del Rio are both medical doctors.</p>
<p>In their letter to Walensky, the three men wrote: "To address the potential impact of the current isolation policy safely, we propose a 5-day isolation from symptom onset for those who experience a breakthrough infection."</p>
<p>"Individuals would be able to end isolation with an appropriate testing protocol. As part of this policy change, we would be interested to partner with CDC and collect empirical data," the letter said.</p>
<p>Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. airlines including Delta, Southwest and United, wrote to the CDC on December 23 arguing in favor of a reduced isolation period, warning of staffing shortages and flight disruptions.</p>
<p>U.S. travelers <a>have faced a wave of flight cancellations</a> as COVID-19 has affected flight crews and led to personnel shortages.</p>
<p>That explanation <a>won a skeptical reaction from some health experts</a> who took to Twitter to question the CDC's decision, while a union for flight attendants also criticized the move.</p>
<p>"The CDC gave a medical explanation about why the agency has decided to reduce the quarantine requirements from 10 to five days, but the fact that it aligns with the number of days pushed by corporate America is less than reassuring," Nelson said.</p>
<p>Newsweek has asked the CDC for comment.</p>
<header><div> World</div><h1>Russia Diplomat Blames U.S. for 'Cold War 2.0'</h1><div> By David Brennan <time>On 12/29/21 at 4:53 AM EST</time></div> </header>
<div> World Ukraine <a>Russia</a></div>
<p>The U.S. and its Western allies are to blame for the dire state of relations between NATO and Moscow, according to a top Russian <a>United Nations</a> diplomat.</p>
<p>First Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Dmitry Polyansky on Wednesday accused the U.S. and NATO of "exploiting" divisions in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s, and trying to "crush" the newly emerged Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Russian diplomats are on a pointed <a>public offensive</a> against the U.S. and its NATO allies, spurred by renewed tensions along the Ukraine border where tens of thousands of Russian troops remain deployed.</p>
<a>The crisis</a> has dragged on for months, with Kyiv and its Western backers calling for Russian de-escalation, but the Kremlin demanding guarantees that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO. Joint
<a>NATO-Russia security talks</a> are planned for mid-January.
<a>Vladimir Putin</a>'s argument that the West, not Moscow, is to blame for geopolitical tensions. The eastward expansion of NATO after the Soviet collapse is proof, they say, of Western duplicity and a plot to surround and smother Russia.
<p>"But eventually things have gone [the] other way very quickly."</p>
<a>QA press conference</a> last week, Putin likewise accused Western rivals of stoking conflict with Moscow. The president refused to guarantee that Russian forces would invade Ukraine again, instead demanding security guarantees from the West.
<p>"Our actions will depend not on the negotiations, but on the unconditional security of Russia, today and in the future," Putin said, referring to the planned January talks with U.S. and NATO officials.</p>
<p>"We have made it absolutely clear that NATO's expansion to the east is unacceptable," Putin said. "What's not clear about it?"</p>
<p>"We are not the ones who are threatening someone, we are not the ones who came to the border of the U.S. or the U.K.; they came to us." Putin continued. "And now they're saying, 'We will have Ukraine as well.'"</p>
<p>"You should come up with guarantees, right now—immediately," Putin said, addressing the U.S. and NATO.</p>
<p>"They just cheated us," Putin said of NATO nations. "'Not a single inch to the east,' that's what we heard in the 1990s," the president added.</p>
<p>Putin's proposal to exclude Ukraine from NATO permanently has already been publicly rebuffed in Kyiv, Brussels and Washington, D.C.</p>

<a> statement</a>. "That flies in the face of public health recommendations, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and parking farther from your destination. Those don't take 10 minutes, so why were they recommended?"
<p>The findings revealed that exercise didn't need to be done at once, so long as activity was performed at a moderate to vigorous pace.</p>
<p>Those who racked up less than 20 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous activity daily had the highest risk of early death. However, people who moved at least 100 minutes per day cut their risk by 76 percent.</p>
<p>Although the study indicates that more activity is better, it also suggests that you may be able to swap that trip to the gym for a few extra flights of stairs.</p>
