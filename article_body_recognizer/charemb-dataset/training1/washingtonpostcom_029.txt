<div><div><p>But can we expect to see that same growth under the new tax law? Maybe not.</p></div></div>
<p>Not that leveraging up is a good idea. The obvious lesson of the foreclosure crisis was that too big a mortgage is lethal to remaining a homeowner. But these days homeowners remain cautious borrowers and are steadily building equity in their homes. </p>
<div><p>New tax law expected to slow rise of home values, creating winners and losers</p></div>
<div><p>The MID is not a particularly effective way of increasing homeownership, as proponents of the tax break often argue. However, adjusting to the scaled-back MID will be financially painful for many homeowners who bought based in part on it.</p></div>
<div><p>How the tax bill impacts homeowners, buyers and sellers</p></div>
<div><p><span>Changes in tax law may prompt homeowners to move to other states</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Rent increases will thus be an increasingly serious financial burden, especially for lower-income households in urban centers like D.C.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Jared Bernstein, Jim Parrott and Mark Zandi</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 2, 2020</div></div>
<div><div><p>The nation is in the grip of an affordable housing crisis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Half of families who rent and nearly one-fourth of home owners pay more than 30 percent of their monthly income toward their housing costs, a level widely considered unsustainable.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fueling the rapid rise in rent and house prices is a severe lack of housing supply.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Nationwide, the percent of houses that are vacant has fallen to a more than 35-year low, translating into a shortfall of an estimated 1.6 million new houses.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Commentary: CFPB needs to lift restrictions that discourage minority home buying</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>The causes</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Add to that often-tight local constraints on where and what one can build, and many of the communities that most desperately need affordable housing have rules in place making that housing almost impossible to provide.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>As a result, in recent years prices for the lowest-priced houses have grown consistently twice as fast as prices for the highest-priced houses and now exceed what many families of modest means can pay.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Commentary: 10 years after going into conservatorship, Fannie and Freddie need real reform</p></div>
<p>The widening gap between the growth of wages and the cost of housing has put homeownership out of reach for more and more families, particularly families of color. The homeownership rate for African Americans has fallen to a half-century low.</p>
<div><div><p>This in turn is exacerbating the growing wealth gap. In generations past, the primary way lower- and middle-income households were able to build wealth was by owning a home.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Many are thus faced with the Hobson’s choice of long commutes, unaffordable housing or forgoing good jobs altogether. Paralyzed by this, Americans aren’t moving as much, and our economy is diminished as a result.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What can be done</div></h3></div></div>
<div><p><span>More Zandi: How the Trump administration can continue progress in U.S. housing</span></p></div>
<div><div><p>Both of these programs have the infrastructure and flexibility necessary to scale up and get affordable housing where it’s most needed.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>However, policies to increase the supply of housing will take time to reap benefits. In the meantime, we need to ease the financial pressure on those hit hardest by the affordability crisis.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>More than a decade after the housing market took down the economy, the nation finds itself in the throes of a different kind of housing crisis. Its effects are subtler, and perhaps for this reason it has gone largely ignored.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the nation must address this housing crisis in earnest, lest an entire generation of families whose parents found in housing a critical path to building wealth, find it now blocking the way.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Given the depth of the affordable housing crisis and the existence of good, practical ideas to address it, it is time for the candidates to give it the attention it deserves.</p></div></div>

<h1>A QAnon con: How the viral Wayfair sex trafficking lie hurt real kids</h1>
<h2>An Internet mob wanted to rescue a 13-year-old girl. Instead, they terrified her, derailed real trafficking investigations and incited ‘save the children’ violence.</h2>
<div><div><div><div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Jessica Contrera</div></div></span></div></span></div></div></div><div>Dec. 16, 2021</div></div></div>
<p>But it felt even more bleak to 13-year-old Samara, whose parents had been a mess of worry ever since what happened in the spring.</p>
<p>In May, Samara had stuffed a box of Frosted Flakes into her sparkly backpack, slipped out the door and run away. She had just needed a break from it all, you know?</p>
<p>It was terrifying for her parents, Samara understood that now. The search parties, the police alerts, the missing posters.</p>
<p>On this afternoon in July, she felt perfectly safe.</p>
<p>She scrolled to the next Instagram post, and the next, and the next, until her phone rang. Her dad’s name was on the screen.</p>
<p>“Something’s going on,” Kevin Duplessis Jr. told his daughter.</p>
<p>Within the last 20 minutes, more than a dozen people had called him, frantic about whether Samara was okay. Apparently, thousands of people on the Internet were talking about the same thing.</p>
<p>Samara’s name and face were going viral, along with the names and faces of half a dozen other children.</p>
<p>One tweet circulating her picture showed a screenshot of an old local news article that said Samara Duplessis was missing. The article was never updated when Samara was found safe.</p>
<p>Beside it was a screenshot of a pillow for sale on Wayfair, the online furniture superstore. It was called the “Duplessis” pillow. Its price: $9,999.</p>
<p>The person behind the post was seemingly arguing that because the pillow was marked at a ridiculous price, and because its name matched the last name of a child who appeared to be missing, Wayfair was involved in something sinister.</p>
<b> </b>Reddit, YouTube, Instagram and TikTok. Within 72 hours, the company was trending, with an estimated 1.2 million tweets about Wayfair and trafficking.
<p>In the days to come, every aspect of these claims would be found to be false.</p>
<p>They didn’t realize they were amplifying a QAnon propaganda artist trying to convince the masses that President Donald Trump was saving the country from a ring of satanic pedophiles.</p>
<p>One of those children was trying to make sense of what her dad was saying.</p>
<p>“Do not leave the house,” Kevin instructed his daughter.</p>
<p>Samara lay back on her bed. Her parents were probably just overreacting, she thought. But a few minutes later, her phone rang again.</p>
<p>It was one of her closest friends, panicked about Wayfair.</p>
<p>“If you playing, tell me now,” Samara told him.</p>
<p>He sent her screenshot after screenshot.</p>
<p>Samara didn’t know anything about algorithms that caused pricing inconsistencies. She’d never heard of QAnon. She saw only her face. Her name. $9,999.</p>
<p>With every passing minute, her certainty about her safety was slipping away.</p>
<p>With every passing minute, more people were posting her picture.</p>
<p>Many of them wrote that they didn’t know if what they were reading about Wayfair was true, but they figured that sharing it couldn’t hurt.</p>
<p>Samara was about to find out just how much it would.</p>
<h3>A conspiracy theory’s creation</h3>
<p>Bored back home in North Carolina, 20-year-old Zari had been doing a lot of doom-scrolling, including the night before, when she had been shocked by the tweets she was seeing about Wayfair.</p>
<p>“Y’all, this Wayfair Human trafficking thing is crazy,” she’d typed.</p>
<p>Now she could see why her phone was hot. It was lighting up<b> </b>with every new notification, and by morning, there were nearly 10,000 retweets. Soon there would be more than 64,000.</p>
<p>A researcher analyzing the false claims about Wayfair would pinpoint Zari’s tweet as one of the most powerful spreaders of the misinformation.</p>
<p>But she was far from the one to start it. By the time Zari read about the Wayfair frenzy, it had been simmering on the Internet for nearly a month.</p>
<p>It began, QAnon researchers say, with a tweet from a woman who calls herself Amazing Polly.</p>
<b> </b>were “deep state criminals” destabilizing the world for their own gain.
<p>He was sentenced to four years in prison for the three shots he fired into the restaurant.</p>
<p>Pizzagate was a cautionary tale, showing how online conspiracy theories about sex-trafficked children could lead to real-life violence. But that did nothing to stop more made-up stories from spreading.</p>
<p>“At the time I was doing a lot of research into human trafficking so my twitter post about the cabinets was kind of a ‘raised eyebrow’ type thing,” she said.</p>
<b> </b>gained hundreds of likes, followers and subscribers
<p>Every share was a potential for more people to “look into” the allegations — and with a few more clicks, find their way to other QAnon content. In her next YouTube video, Amazing Polly encouraged them to do just that.</p>
<p>“The people who are now just waking up because of Wayfairgate, I hope you’ll go down these other rabbit holes, too,” she said.</p>
<p>In North Carolina, Zari wasn’t going down the rabbit hole. She’d been excited at first about all the traction her tweets about Samara and the pillow were getting. She had even bragged to her mom about it.</p>
<p>“I sort of felt uncomfortable about it,” Zari said. She came to a realization: “I don’t know that this is true, really.”</p>
<p>She deleted the tweet specifically about Samara, telling her followers she wasn’t missing after all. Eventually, Zari would delete all eight of her tweets about Wayfair.</p>
<p>But she knew enough about the Internet to know that to the 64,000 people who shared what she shared, and to all the people who followed them, there was no taking it back.</p>
<p>Samara did not leave her dad’s house. Sometimes, she did not leave her bed. But even lying there, she was afraid to fall asleep. She stayed on the phone with a friend all night, not wanting to be alone.</p>
<p>“I started getting real bad anxiety. I started pacing around real heavy,” she recalled. “When I get in my head, like real, real deep in my head, I start hyperventilating.”</p>
<p>“My body is just doing whatever it can just to get me to calm down,” she said.</p>
<p>She didn’t want her parents to know how freaked out she was.</p>
<p>All the while, Samara’s mother, Tammy, kept returning to her Facebook inbox. It was full of alarming messages from strangers and distant friends.</p>
<p>So even as Tammy read the articles saying the Wayfair thing was a lie, she couldn’t shake the feeling that somehow, there was a bounty on her daughter’s head.</p>
<p>“Can my child go outside?” Tammy asked herself. “Can she go to the grocery store without people lurking? We don’t know.”</p>
<p>Samara’s parents never realized that nearly all the other “missing” kids who were named in the viral posts about Wayfair weren’t actually missing.</p>
<b> </b>but like 92 percent of all children reported missing, she was recovered.
<p>“I just started shaking all over,” Phillips recalled. “Everything was bringing back the memories of when that poster was made, when she had run away.”</p>
<p>But one day at Walmart, an employee recognized him as the boy next to pictures of the $9,999 “Dziedzic” pillow.</p>
<p>“Chill out,” Cameron told the woman. “Everything is good.”</p>
<p>She called the police anyway.</p>
<p>“You’re mad because I’m telling you that I’m <i>not</i> missing?” she asked the 530,000 viewers of her live stream.</p>
<p>A woman watching didn’t like her tone. “Put her ass back in the cabinet,” she commented.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people wanted to help these children when they believed they were victims of sex trafficking. When it turned out that they were victims of a viral hoax, the kids and their families were left to face the wreckage alone.</p>
<p>Samara’s mom tried calling the Michigan attorney general. Someone there, she remembered, told her to call the FBI. Tammy did, but said she never heard anything back.</p>
<p>After that, she decided it would be better not to talk about any of this with Samara.</p>
<p>She didn’t want her daughter to know how freaked out she was.</p>
<h3>A real victim’s fate</h3>
<b> </b>sex trafficking looked like in America. Not kidnapping. Not stranger danger. Not Wayfair cabinets or pillows. Just a person being manipulated by someone exploiting
<p>Howard knew, too, what she needed to do: call the National Human Trafficking Hotline, which provides resources<b> </b>to people being coerced into commercial sex or any kind of forced labor.</p>
<p>But when she called, she was placed on hold. It was late, so she filed a written assistance request for this victim instead.</p>
<p>That request landed in an inbox still full of people who wanted Wayfair to be investigated and Samara and the other kids in their social media feeds to be rescued.</p>
<p>Now legions of callers were parroting QAnon propaganda, most without even knowing it.</p>
<p>“The majority of people who were swept up in this misinformation really believed that this was a human trafficking ring, and that no one cared,” said hotline director Megan Cutter, who had to call in extra staff for weeks.</p>
<p>Both Polaris and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children passed on everything they were hearing about the Wayfair claims to local police and federal agencies.</p>
<p>Ongoing investigations across the country were put on hold while a viral lie took precedence.</p>
<p>At Homeland Security, that impacted all 30 field offices, said Ramon Padilla, acting division chief for the Center for Countering Human Trafficking.</p>
<p>“That time could be spent trying to identify victims, and doing the stuff that investigators need to do in order to get a prosecution, and ensure that these traffickers go to jail,” Padilla said.</p>
<b> </b>expensive cabinets in question were industrial grade and accurately priced.
<b> </b>Some pointed to Wayfair’s lack of explanation about the pricing of the other products, like the Duplessis pillow, as proof that they were hiding something.
<p>But Carpenter, working from home while figuring out how to navigate her first QAnon crisis, decided Wayfair would stay quiet.</p>
<p>“Our goal was really to try to minimize adding anything else to the story, and try to do whatever we could to not add fuel to the fire” she said.</p>
<p>The signs were also popular at rallies for Trump, who, when asked about QAnon at a town hall before the election, said, “I know nothing about it. I do know they are very much against pedophilia. They fight it very hard.”</p>
<p>All the while, the calls, texts and online reports to the trafficking hotline kept coming, burying requests like the one from the advocate in Florida.</p>
<p>The woman at the hospital was afraid of being arrested, and she didn’t want to talk to the police.</p>
<p>“You are not going to get in trouble for this,” Howard, the advocate, had assured her. She just wanted to find this trafficking victim a safe place to stay.</p>
<p>Howard called the hotline two more times that weekend.</p>
<p>By the time Polaris’s advocates connected her with<b> </b>an organization that had a room to spare, the woman who needed her help had fled.</p>
<p>Howard, who had given her a business<b> </b>card, hoped she’d get in touch. But the only call she received was from another hotline advocate, wanting to follow up on the written request that was now two weeks old.</p>
<p>The advocate apologized for the delay, explaining how backed up they were with callers demanding that they “save the children.” She was ready to provide support however she could with this case.</p>
<p>Howard explained to the hotline worker that it was too late. She never heard from the woman who asked for her help again.</p>
<h3>A true believer’s death</h3>
<p>While Samara was trying to stop thinking about child traffickers, a woman in Georgia couldn’t think about anything else.</p>
<p>Rosanne texted her sisters Blaire and Lonna about Wayfair again.</p>
<p>“It was not like ‘oh this is so crazy.’ She was really upset,”<b> </b>Blaire remembered. “She wanted to look more into it to try and help put an end to it.”</p>
<p>“In a couple-week period, she was fully into QAnon and the celebrities eating children for their adrenochrome. It happened really quick,” Blaire said.</p>
<b> </b>was touting Trump’s brilliance. By the holidays, she was talking about the election being stolen. She was certain that on Jan. 6, Trump was going to announce the arrest of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and his master plan to save the children.
<p>The Boyland family, who had been Googling for “how to get someone free from a cult,”<b> </b>couldn’t convince her not to go to Washington.</p>
<p>Rosanne told Blaire, “If I’m wrong, you guys can do whatever you want to me. I just have this deep down feeling that I’m right. I want it to be proven that I’m right.”</p>
<p>They never got to have that discussion.</p>
<p>As a mob stormed the Capitol, Rosanne was in their midst. As they battled the line of police trying to protect the polished brass doors, Rosanne was lying on the terrace, unconscious. She would become one of four rioters to die that day.</p>
<p>An autopsy found she’d overdosed on amphetamines. Her family still questions that conclusion, saying the only amphetamine in her body was the Adderall she’d been prescribed.</p>
<p>Police attempting to reach Rosanne that day were attacked with fists and flagpoles, according to prosecutors pursuing cases against some of the rioters. Video footage shows one man reaching over her body to bash a helmetless officer with a baton.</p>
<p>To her gleeful attackers on the Internet, Rosanne was a meme in the making, a woman with a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag, trampled by her own co-conspirators.</p>
<p>To Blaire, Rosanne was still the person who went with her to see Green Day for her first concert, who took the pictures at family parties, who had truly believed she was doing her part to fight something evil.</p>
<p>To those studying QAnon, Rosanne’s story was further proof that conspiracy theories about child sex trafficking were serving as on-ramps to far-right radicalization and disturbing acts of violence.</p>
<p>Outside of the insurrection, there have been at least nine QAnon-inspired crimes in 2020 and 2021 committed by people who believed they were in the midst of saving the children, according to data from<b> </b>a University of Maryland analysis.</p>
<p>“I killed my children,” Liliana Carrillo told KGET in a television interview from jail. “I hate myself for it, but like I said, I wasn’t about to hand them off to be continuously tortured and abused.”</p>
<p>“I promised,” she said, “to protect them from everything that would come their way.”</p>
<p>As these women await trials, their families are questioning what they consumed on social media — and how it twisted their minds so quickly.</p>
<p>A recent document leak from a Facebook whistleblower showed that before the company cracked down on misinformation, its own algorithms promoted QAnon content and encouraged users to join QAnon groups.</p>
<p>“This needs to go viral and something needs to happen here,” the video creator said.</p>
<p>Eventually, the chicken nugget video was banned. TikTok says its moderators proactively identify and remove false content that causes harm, along with blocking hashtags such as #pizzagate.</p>
<p>But before the video disappeared, the nugget theory had spread to Facebook.</p>
<p>Some creators making these TikToks seem genuinely concerned, Dean said. Others seem to be pandering for likes and followers. The impact is the same.</p>
<p>“It’s very easy to scare women in under 60 seconds,” Dean said.</p>
<p>Rosanne’s sisters believe she was scared, too. As the anniversary of her death approaches, Lonna and Blaire still wonder if Rosanne would have given up on QAnon once the predictions about Trump didn’t come true.</p>
<p>They have yet to go through her room, or all her journals, where they know they are likely to discover more evidence of just how radicalized she had become.</p>
<p>But they did notice one sticky note Rosanne wrote not long before going to Washington. It wasn’t about “saving the children.” It was just about one child.</p>
<p>Rosanne had recorded the date her niece lost her first tooth. What mattered most to her family now was that she couldn’t mark the second.</p>
<h3>A teen’s reemergence</h3>
<p>Samara sat in the back seat of her mom’s minivan, watching Detroit pass in a blur. She was on her way to meet new people, something that still made her uneasy a year and a half after thousands of strangers shared her pictures online.</p>
<p>“It never truly leaves your spirit," Samara said. "Just to know that somebody had the capability to take me from my family. It becomes a lifestyle, making sure I’m always cautious of who is around me.”</p>
<p>Her dad still had security<b> </b>cameras outside his door. Her mom still didn’t want her to go to in-person school, so Samara was taking<b> </b>all of her sophomore-year classes online. She didn’t go to homecoming.</p>
<p>But earlier this year, Samara convinced her parents to let her try modeling. They took her to classes at a Black-owned modeling school, where she learned to walk a runway, hold her posture and build her confidence.</p>
<p>On this November afternoon, she was headed to practice for a fashion show, where at 15, she would be the youngest model on the stage.</p>
<p>Samara got out of the van, and her mother followed. Tammy made sure a coach she trusted was inside.</p>
<p>“Mommy needs to see,” she said.</p>
<p>In her chunky-heeled boots, Samara took her place in line. She smiled at the other models. She hoped they wouldn’t Google her.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t be thinking about that. She needed to be ready for her turn. She heard “Five, six, seven, eight,” and on cue, Samara stepped out.</p>
<p>She started walking toward the full-length mirror at the end of the runway.</p>
<p>Her chin was up. Her shoulders were back. Her face was composed.</p>
<p>Here, she wasn’t missing. Or hyperventilating. She wasn’t a trafficking victim. Or a conspiracy theorist’s pawn.</p>
<p>She looked at her reflection in the mirror. For the next few moments, at least, her image was hers to control.</p>

<div><h1>Nearly 50,000 Facebook users may have been targets of private surveillance, company says</h1></div>
<h2>Report draws attention to abuses by an industry that the social media giant says engages in “indiscriminate” targeting</h2>

<b> </b>to reassess its guidance about what people should do to avoid spreading the virus to others, and to safely return to school and work to keep society functioning.
<div><div><h3><div>What did the CDC recommend?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>well-fitting masks for an additional five days.
<div><p>With omicron, many vaccinated Americans will at some point test positive. Here’s what to do.</p></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What does it mean to go into isolation?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>How long should someone with a coronavirus infection stay isolated?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>Loss of taste and smell may persist for weeks or months and should not delay the end of isolation. People still need to wear a well-fitting mask around others at home and in public for five days after ending isolation.
<div><div><h3><div>Why did the guidance change from 10 days to five days?</div></h3></div></div>
<b> </b>they experience their first symptoms and declining within several days. Some reports suggest omicron has a shorter incubation period — that is, the time between someone becoming infected and showing
<b> </b>symptoms — than previous variants.
<div><div><h3><div>Why isn’t the CDC requiring a test to end isolation?</div></h3></div></div>
<p>Asked at a briefing why the CDC updated its guidance on Jan. 4 to say that people with access to rapid tests could use them before coming out of isolation, Walensky said the agency was simply responding to questions from the general public.</p>
<div><div><h3><div>What has been the reaction to the guidance?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>In particular, the group strongly endorsed requiring a negative test before someone who has previously tested positive can end isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Shortly after the guidance was posted online, Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, said he agreed with it, except that he would recommend that people get a negative test before ending isolation.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Why are the isolation recommendations the same for those who are unvaccinated, vaccinated and boosted?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Most transmission occurs early in the infection, in the one to two days before onset of symptoms and within the first days afterward. That is true of people regardless of their vaccination status.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Does this guidance apply to K-12 school settings?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What if you have symptoms of covid-19 but can’t find a test?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>covid-19 symptoms</a> such as a fever of 100.4 F or greater, cough or shortness of breath,
<b> </b>you might have the illness and should isolate immediately. Even if you do not know if you had
<div><div><h3><div>When should you quarantine?</div></h3></div></div>
<a> symptoms</a>, isolate for at least five days from the date your symptoms began.
<div><div><h3><div>When can you end your quarantine?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>What if someone can’t get a test five days after the last close contact?</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>You can leave home after day five if you had no covid-19 symptoms during those five days.<b> </b>Wear a well-fitting mask for 10 days after the date of that contact when around others, both at home and in public.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Who does not need to quarantine?</div></h3></div></div>
<li>People 18 or older who have received all recommended vaccine doses, including boosters and additional primary shots for some immunocompromised people.</li>
<li>Children 5 to 17 who have completed the primary series of coronavirus vaccines.</li>
<li>Someone who had confirmed covid-19 within the last 90 days.</li>
<div><div><h3><div>Why are the recommendations for quarantine different for those who are vaccinated and those who are boosted?</div></h3></div></div>
<a>close contact</a> with someone who is infected.

<h2>They suggest an approach based on a ‘new normal of life with covid,’ rather than continuing efforts to eradicate the virus</h2>

<p>Six former health advisers to President Biden’s transition team released a series of journal articles on Thursday calling for a “new normal” in the nation’s approach to fighting the coronavirus and other viral threats.</p>
<div><div>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</div></div>
<p>Rather than continuing in “a perpetual state of emergency,” he and the others argue, the United States must shift to a strategy of seeking to live with the virus by suppressing its peaks, rather than attempting to eliminate it.</p>
<b> </b>comes amid experts’ growing realization that neither vaccinations nor infections appear to confer lasting immunity against the coronavirus. Some also express frustration the White House has squandered opportunities to contain the virus
<div><p>Omicron outbreak inducing whiplash for many Americans</p></div>
<div><p>“Two years into the pandemic, the U.S. is still heavily reliant on data from Israel and the U.K. for assessing the effectiveness and durability of COVID-19 vaccines and rate of vaccine breakthrough infections,” they write.</p></div>
<a>pressed</a> the White House to more aggressively help to vaccinate the world, saying that too little has been done to tamp down the risk of virus variants emerging abroad.
<div><div><p>The Biden administration also has been widely criticized for failing to move faster to acquire and distribute hundreds of millions of rapid coronavirus tests, <a>passing on opportunities</a> last year to do so.</p></div></div>
<p>In interviews, the advisers said that Biden officials faced considerable challenges in trying to both execute a pandemic strategy and plan for the future, adding that their recommendations were meant to complement the administration’s efforts.</p>

<div><div><p>The number of Americans hospitalized with covid-19 reached more than 126,000 this week — the highest level in a year. But this wave of the pandemic looks different from what came before, with dueling variants on the move.</p></div></div>
<div><div><a>FAQ: What to know about the omicron variant of the coronavirus</a></div></div>
<div><div><p>In Los Angeles, where the fast-spreading omicron variant reigns, roughly two-thirds of covid patients in the county’s public hospitals were initially admitted for other causes, officials said Wednesday.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But at CoxHealth in Springfield, Mo., where officials say the older delta variant remains a ferocious threat, the <a>coronavirus</a> remains the immediate cause for 81 percent of covid hospitalizations.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are planning on a pretty scary scenario: volumes increasing and being short-staffed,” said Steve Edwards, the hospital’s CEO, warning that omicron could soon arrive and sicken his workers.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>While most hospitalized patients are adults, the number of pediatric covid inpatients has doubled since Christmas to a seven-day average of 3,800 children.</p></div></div>
<a>Minnesota</a> and Wisconsin begging residents to get vaccinated, wear masks and take other precautions to avoid contracting covid.
<div><div><p>“We now have more COVID-19 patients in our hospitals than ever before. And the overwhelming majority are unvaccinated,” <a>read</a> one ad sponsored by Cleveland-area health systems last month.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We were coping with our delta surge, and omicron spread like wildfire,” said Keith Armitage, an infectious-disease doctor at University Hospitals.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Armitage said there were 486 covid patients in his hospital Wednesday, which he said represented “three buckets” of roughly equal size.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“First … patients admitted primarily due to an illness, covid-19,” Armitage said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>The fact that patients are showing up at hospitals with other ailments and injuries only to test positive later for covid is another indicator that omicron causes less serious illness, especially in people who are vaccinated, experts say.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Given “how crowded the ER is, and how full the hospital beds are … the short-term concern on the health-care system is highly justified,” he said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>A changing picture</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Am I worried about those? Not really,” she said. “It does make me wonder how many incidental cases we had of delta, and I don’t think we were really focused on that back then.”</p></div></div>
<p>As evidence has mounted that many people infected with omicron were initially hospitalized for other reasons, critics have argued that health-care leaders and federal officials have obfuscated why hospitalization numbers have risen in recent weeks.</p>
<div><div><p>More than a dozen hospital leaders who spoke to The Post said much of the scrutiny over why covid patients are being hospitalized is misplaced.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>John Rimmer, CarePoint’s chief medical officer and emergency department director, adding that the virus may have worsened a preexisting medical condition such as asthma or diabetes, leading to patients’ hospitalization.
<div><div><h3><div>‘Finite resources’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>The surging number of cases has collided with a separate trend: a worsening hospital <a>staffing crunch</a> that is exhausting workers, fueling rising staff turnover and leading to delays in care.</p></div></div>
<a>permanent workplace safety standards</a> to protect health workers from covid, saying that some staff members have quit because they feel at risk.
<div><div><p>In Vermont, where 52 percent of hospitals reported a critical staffing shortage, the problem stemmed from a “crisis of rural health equity” that predated covid, one researcher said.</p></div></div>
<a>Anne N. Sosin</a>, a health policy researcher at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Center at Dartmouth College.
<div><div><p>Sosin said Vermont’s hospitals had persistently struggled to recruit specialists and other staff, and she was concerned that workers who quit during the pandemic could not be easily replaced.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“When we lose health-care workers from our rural region, it’s not clear that we’ll be able to fill those positions again,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But in Rhode Island — which reported the nation’s worst staffing shortage — health workers characterized the shortfalls as unprecedented.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’ve never seen this before, in the five years I’ve worked here,” said Brooke Huminski, a clinical social worker at Butler Hospital in Providence, R.I.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That’s created a problem — now the doctors need to pick up more of the work, which is interfering with patient flow … and of course, raising my own stress levels a bit,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s a weird time to be worrying about him and also trying to function,” Huminski said.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>When Weeks was finally able to have surgery more than two weeks later, his condition from sepsis had worsened. Weeks died Nov. 28 of complications after surgery. He was 78.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The story was first reported by the Des Moines Register.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. hospitals brace for continuing surge in covid cases fueled by the omicron variant</p></div>
<div><div><p>More than 71,000 people in the United States are currently hospitalized with covid-19, with 16,344 occupying beds in the intensive care unit, according to <a>data tracked by The Post</a>.</p></div></div>
<a>Iowa Department of Public Health</a>, and state data shows that more than 85 percent of covid-19 patients occupying beds in intensive care units are unvaccinated.
<div><div><p>Less than 60 percent of the state is fully vaccinated, which trails the national rate of 62 percent.</p></div></div>
<a>turned away from 43 hospitals</a> in three states.
<div><div><p>Weeks taught math and science, and was also a principal, before becoming a schools superintendent for three school districts in the state. He retired in 2007.</p></div></div>
<p>“He said, ‘I shouldn’t be around if I don’t know what’s making me feel this way,’ ” Simanski said. “He went that extra mile to make sure he wasn’t going to infect anyone if he had covid.”</p>
<a>1 in 3 patients</a> who die in a hospital have sepsis.
<div><div><p>“I was begging for someone to look at his case,” Owenson said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“He called us and said, ‘The doctor said I’ll have to have surgery or I’ll likely die in a few days,’ ” Simanski said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Despite the 17-hour surgery on Nov. 26, Weeks was still struggling, his family said. A second surgery was performed, but it could not help his failing kidneys or intestines. He died shortly thereafter.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Days after Christmas, the family said they are still struggling to wrap their heads around how their father died — and the care he needed that he was unable to receive.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“One of the things that nags at me is if he could have gotten the care he needed earlier, would the surgery not be as onerous as it turned out to be?” Owenson said.</p></div></div>
<p>As the omicron variant continues to affect hospitals nationwide during the holidays, Weeks’s children are begging the millions who remain unvaccinated to look to their father’s example of what it is to be “a good neighbor.”</p>
<div><div><p>“The irony of it all is that someone who was committed to service and helping people his whole life ended up dying from people not being neighborly or helpful,” Simanski said.</p></div></div>
