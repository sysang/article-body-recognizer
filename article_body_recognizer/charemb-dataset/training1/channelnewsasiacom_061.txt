<h1> Commentary: Conflict in families has more negative outcomes on children than divorce does </h1>
<div> <p>There are no fixed formulas on how children are impacted by their parents’ marriages but there are common fault lines says social worker Cindy Ng.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Cindy Ng </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: In our line of work, we have the opportunity to observe upfront some of the biggest stressors that families in Singapore go through.</p>
<p>They run the gamut of financial hardship, family dysfunction and very commonly, conflict among spouses. Let me sketch out two such cases we have seen and what we can learn about how children are afflicted by conflict.</p>
<p>The first is a woman called Lily. She was the oldest of three children and for eight years since she was a child, she witnessed violence that took place regularly between her parents in their four-room flat. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Fewer marriages, more divorces in Singapore last year</a></h3>
<p>Lily’s mother eventually divorced her husband. But Lily bore the scars of these years.</p>
<p>Filled with resentment and anger, she stopped school at 12, ran away from home and eventually became pregnant with her boyfriend’s child when she was 17. </p>
<p>But despite her difficulties as a single parent, Lily was determined to be a good mother to her child. She received help from a relative and raised the child on her own.</p>
<p>She was also closely supported by her medical social worker when her baby was born, and her social worker from the Family Service Centre. </p>
<p>Lily is now 24, in a stable marriage, works full time as a front desk executive in a hotel where she is a good friend to many at her workplace.</p>
<p>On the surface of it, one would say that because she came from a broken family, Lily ended up being a dropout and an unwed mother. </p>
<p>Yet, she has turned her life around, is gainfully employed and has a family. Would society consider her to have fared poorer than her peers from intact families?</p>
<p>Consider then, the case of Siew Choo who approached our FSC after filing for a personal protection order against her husband. </p>
<p>She was terrified of him as he had repeatedly threatened to abandon her, hurt her and commit suicide whenever she raised the possibility of a separation.</p>
<p>As a result of his threats, Siew Choo remained married to her husband, and did not attempt to file a divorce. Their only child, Denise was privy to this constant conflict. </p>
<p>But Denise was very bright and a perfectionist who scored straight As in school, all through to her junior college days.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Couples who stay in unhappy unions for the sake of children may end up harming them</a></h3>
<p>She attained a scholarship with a government agency and went overseas to further her studies.</p>
<p>Denise met her partner there and decided not to return to Singapore to serve her bond.</p>
<p>On the face of it, Denise was smart, successful, a straight-A student but the truth is quite different.</p>
<p>Both cases I’ve highlighted show that family dynamics are complex, multi-faceted and highly stressful. </p>
<p>Despite the different family situations and outcomes, there is a common theme – the adults and children in both cases experienced a high level of conflict.</p>
<p>During a high level of conflict, the human body releases cortisol (commonly known as our stress hormone) which triggers a fight/flight/freeze reaction in us. After the danger or threat has passed, the cortisol level should calm down.</p>
<p>However, when individuals are subjected to prolonged and chronic episodes of stress, the body’s most important functions can be derailed. </p>
<p>During her teenage years as a young mother, Lily often complained about having difficulties sleeping, and recalled having panic attacks at night, especially when she was alone at home.</p>
<h3><a>READ: IN FOCUS: Should parents divorce or stay together for the kids?</a></h3>
<p>Those occurrences made it difficult for her to concentrate in the day when she had to either care for her young child or focus at work.</p>
<p>She believed that Denise experienced a high level of anxiety in social interactions all through her life. One wonders if there is a direct link between what Denise has witnessed in the home to her current difficulties in relationships.</p>
<p>How did Lily overcome her sleep and mental health issues to be a stable mother to her child today? How did Denise’s social anxiety pave the way for a controlling relationship with her now abusive husband?</p>
<h3><a>READ: Online portal to be set up to provide early support to couples considering divorce</a></h3>
<p>The lives of Lily and Denise suggest that perhaps it is not the parents’ marital status that predisposes a child to poorer outcomes. </p>
<p>Instead, dynamic factors such as exposure to high levels of conflict between parents, poorer support systems for single parents and the social stigma attached to a child in a divorced family may have greater impact. </p>

<h1> Commentary: Training children to support their friends can reduce school bullying </h1>
<div> <p>School bullying is a worldwide problem despite all the measures in place to deal with it. Two professors shed light on the powerful role peers can play.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Cheung Hoi Shan </a> <a> Lee Jungup </a> </div> </div>
<p>The latter wrote a personal appeal to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to look into the issue of school bullying. </p>
<p>What makes these cases particularly disturbing is the victimisation of vulnerable children with special needs, which in some cases seem to have persisted over time without any recourse for the victim. </p>
<p>Parents weighed in on the issue, prompting a response from the Ministry of Education.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Is your child a bully? How parents can spot the signs and what they should do</a></h3>
<p>The tried and tested method to deal with bullying is to punish the bullies and make them apologise to their victims. </p>
<p>As a preventive measure, MOE also refreshed the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Curriculum by emphasising the need for students to forge a kind and caring community in schools.</p>
<p>Worldwide, research has shown that school bullying is a pervasive phenomenon, one that affects not just younger children in schools, but also young adults in institutes of higher learning. </p>
<p>Hence, bullying is not a problem that children grow out of, or that results from children being immature or weak. </p>
<p>Several insights can be gleaned from two recent studies involving primary school children and university students in Singapore, conducted by our research teams at Yale-NUS College and the National University of Singapore. </p>
<p>These studies found that a combination of strong parental and peer support, as well as empathy training, might be the way forward to effectively combat school bullying across educational settings.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Many parents don’t know how to react when kids get bullied – and that’s okay</a></h3>
<p>With a strong parent-child attachment, which is cultivated through spending time with the child and being responsive to their emotional needs, children are given a safe space to share their troubles at school with a trusted adult. </p>
<p>This provides an opportunity for parents to suggest effective strategies on how the child can cope with school bullying, ensuring continuous support at home. For example, parents may role-play with the child appropriate responses towards a bully. </p>
<p>Similarly, peers who offer aid and support to one another in school facilitate the development of a positive peer culture, where children learn to engage peers without resorting to dominating strategies. </p>
<p>This is especially helpful for children who tend to react aggressively out of anxiety and a fear of rejection, which may turn into acts of bullying. </p>
<p>For students who were both a bully and a victim (the “bully-victims”), being highly attached to their peers reduced their anxiety to the same level as those who have not been involved in any bullying relationship. </p>
<p>Bully-victims are those students who bully others and at the same time are victims of bullying. Research has shown that this group of students tends to have worse mental health outcomes than those who are pure bullies or pure victims.</p>
<h3><a>READ: The Big Read: No child’s play when it comes to stamping out bullying in schools</a></h3>
<p>This insight is backed by other studies, which have shown that structured empathy training programmes are effective in lowering bullying rates among students as young as primary school.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why shaming your children on social media makes things worse </h1>
<div> <p>Harsh parenting can destroy your child's self-respect and ruin their lives, one observer points out.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Brian Edward Kinghorn </a> </div> </div>
<p>WEST VIRGINIA: Matt Cox knew he would be criticised when he forced his 10-year-old daughter to walk 8km to school in 2.2 degree Celsius weather as her punishment for being suspended from the school bus twice for bullying.</p>
<p>The video quickly garnered over 15 million views. Although some online comments called him a bully, most comments were from parents, educators and others who wholeheartedly supported his actions.</p>
<p>“I gotta give it to him this way,” the father said, as his son sulked during the ordeal.</p>
<p>And last March, a father posted a video of his 10-year-old son running a mile to school in the rain because he had also been banned from the bus for bullying. “Welcome to ‘You Better Listen to Your Dad 2018,’” the man tells viewers in the video.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Does caning still have a place in modern-day parenting? A commentary</a></h3>
<p>The notion that public shaming will work goes against research about the relative effectiveness – or rather ineffectiveness – of punishment as a means of changing behaviour.</p>
<p>As Deidre Golash, a noted public affairs scholar and author of The Case Against Punishment, put it: </p>
<blockquote> <p>The deliberate doing of harm in the mistaken belief that it promotes some greater good is the essence of tragedy.</p> </blockquote>
<p>She asserts that many parents believe that “public shaming punishments generally have the ability to positively affect their children’s behaviour.”</p>
<p>PUBLIC SHAMING WORSENS BEHAVIOUR</p>
<p>The problem is it could actually backfire. “Harsh parenting,” which can include physical aggression, psychological aggression, humiliation, yelling or threatening a child, is particularly problematic. </p>
<p>Research published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law concludes that “suffering severe humiliation has been shown empirically to plunge individuals into major depressions, suicidal states and severe anxiety states”.</p>
<p>Parents are rightly concerned about when and how to discipline their children. Social media platforms can provide helpful opportunities to share parenting advice and learn from others. </p>
<p>In the process of teaching and learning, however, some parents seem to be seeking validation for their parenting techniques without much thought to how it could impact their children.</p>
<p>Social media has exponentially increased the size of the crowd available for public shaming, and crowd dynamics are often cruel.</p>
<p>This form of punishment, which essentially amounts to parental cyberbullying, is particularly harmful because of its permanence. When videos are posted online, parents may lose control of the situation as the video takes on a life of its own.</p>
<p>IN SEARCH OF ALTERNATIVES</p>
<p>There are more effective and gentle approaches to disciplining children than shaming them online. </p>
<p>Jane Nelson, a parent educator, suggests that natural consequences, “anything that happens naturally, without adult interference,” are much more effective than punishments in shaping behaviours. </p>
<p>Walking or jogging to school may be an excellent logical consequence to getting suspended from the school bus as long as the intent is not to inflict suffering, humiliation or psychological harm. </p>
<p>The video and public shaming – which may actually be modeling the punished behaviour – are not needed.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Parents play an outsized role in academic stress children face </h1>
<div> <p>With home-based learning back on the horizon, parents have to step up even more in helping their children learn. But they also have a big role in relieving stress, say NUS researchers, Kim Yongbeom and Fung Fun Man.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Fung Fun Man </a> <a> Kim Yongbeom </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: When details of the <a>indicative score range for all secondary schools</a> for PSLE students were announced in April this year, another round of anxiety and fear struck parents and students.</p>
<p>Despite the changes in the education system over the years to reduce the emphasis on examination and tests, parents still feel the PSLE is a high-stakes one and a new scoring system doesn’t change the pressure for kids to get into good schools.</p>
<p>And so, despite learning being disrupted by the pandemic, there is still a palpable ploughing of resources in the form of tuition, enrichment classes and coaching to help children do better.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: New PSLE scoring, cut-off points for secondary school are stressful for parents all the same</a></h3>
<p>In the midst of all the uncertainty and anxiety, parents and students, once again, turned to tuition centres and enrichment classes. The question many parents wrestle with is whether private tuition is the key to academic success.</p>
<p>The desire to send students for extra classes is an understandable one. Quite often, parents may not have the expertise or time for various subjects, and hence, private tuition is often sought to bridge the gap in learning.</p>
<p>Having said that, parents should be wary of links between academic performance and extra lessons outside class. </p>
<p>Some studies done have shown that the exact relationship varies, with some research pointing to student motivation having a larger impact. </p>
<p>Other factors also matter – like quality of schooling, parental education and skills, as well as students’ perceptions of themselves.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t to say that tuition is inherently detrimental to academic performance. In the same study, the authors also noted that some levels of tuition can be potentially beneficial. </p>
<p>In particular, they found a positive association with grades and tuition hours for students up to 5.5 hours of tuition per week.</p>
<p>(Listen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:)</p>
<p>While there is nothing wrong with having one or two enrichment classes, private tuition today seems to have taken over the lives of our children - a practice both harmful and counter-productive.</p>
<p>OVEREMPHASIS ON ACADEMICS</p>
<p>The excessive prescription of private tuition is not the problem, but a symptom of the single-minded premium we place on academic excellence. </p>
<p>Perhaps it is time to rethink both, as students have just finished their mid-year exams, another chapter of their school year is an opportunity for parents to re-think their approach. </p>
<p>After all, our education has undergone huge changes, such as digitalisation, and with it come new stressors, uncertainties and teaching strategies. </p>
<p>In a 2016 study, researchers from Arizona State University observed that students whose parents put a disproportionate emphasis on academic achievement had worse academic performance and more learning problems and disruptive behaviours at school. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: These PSLE changes won’t fix our national obsession with academic achievement</a></h3>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: What is lost when we spend more on tuition</a></h3>
<p>In fact, children whose parents valued kindness did not suffer in academic performance and did much better on measures of psychological well-being.</p>
<p>Often, we don’t think about the tone of our voice – which can come across as signalling to our children that they are not “good enough”.</p>
<p>Reprimanding, making comparisons or even showing disappointment, criticism can be counter-productive at improving children’s performance. </p>
<p>When children are exposed to such criticism frequently, they can begin to criticise themselves, which could put them at higher risk of poor interpersonal functioning, depressive disorders and suicidal behaviours. </p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Tracking your child’s online activity should not be done covertly</a></h3>
<p>In fact, researchers have warned of the potentially debilitating effects of personal criticism in regards to academic motivations and learning goals. </p>
<p>These behaviours might not be evident to parents, where studies even show that parents criticise much more and praise much less than what they perceive.</p>
<p>CELEBRATING EFFORT AND HARD WORK</p>
<p>As researchers interested in this field, we are encouraged by how many more parents are trying their best to reduce their focus and heavy emphasis on academic excellence. </p>
<p>For those parents who are trying, the work of Stanford professor Carol Dweck is instructive. </p>
<p>While praising effort is important, Dr Dweck also warns against offering praise as a consolation prize. Praise is not a band-aid to be applied to poor performance and should not be offered gratuitously for any routine activity. </p>
<p>Instead, she highlights how parents should praise their kids when they move out of their comfort zone and challenge themselves, despite failing, to adopt a growth mindset.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Raising bilingual children is challenging but immensely rewarding </h1>
<div> <p>Keeping children motivated in speaking their mother tongue is often the most significant challenge to raising bilingual children, but persistence is key, says NUS’ Leher Singh.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Leher Singh </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Parents in Singapore often report significant stress when raising children to speak their mother tongue.</p>
<p>In spite of their best efforts, even at a very young age, children can simply refuse to speak in the mother tongue. This can cause family strain and even disharmony around bilingualism.</p>
<p>Even though parents value the ideals of bilingualism, in practice, raising multilingual children can be challenging.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: In English-speaking Singapore, children face huge challenges in mastering mother tongue</a></h3>
<p>This is not limited to Singapore. Annick de Houwer, a linguistics professor in Germany, has written extensively of “harmonious bilingualism”.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Learning another language has benefits - just not the economic kind</a></h3>
<p>GENUINELY HARD TO RAISE BILINGUAL CHILDREN</p>
<p>Raising bilingual children is genuinely hard. Unfortunately, it often becomes harder as children get older.</p>
<p>All over the world, there is evidence that children gravitate towards the language of their peers and larger community as they mature.</p>
<p>For many in Singapore, that language is English. As our children grow, they experience a strong desire to socially conform to their environment.</p>
<p>For example, children start speaking like their peers in terms of accent and colloquialism, shedding the home accent in favour of the accent used amongst their friends.</p>
<p>In a similar way, speaking the language that prevails in the larger community can become a powerful force. For many students, English is also the language of popular culture and entertainment choices, which gives it a great deal of social appeal.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: The slow death of cable TV and why cutting the cord isn’t too painful</a></h3>
<p>Even children who have strong mother tongue proficiency in early childhood, after a few years of primary school in English, can become dominant users of English over the mother tongue.</p>
<p>Children’s views of their mother tongue can turn from positive to negative within a few short years. For this reason, igniting children’s motivation to speak their mother tongue can be a significant challenge.</p>
<p>CULTIVATING POSTIVITY AROUND MOTHER TONGUE</p>
<p>So, what can we do? First, we can introduce our children to environments where the use of the mother tongue is relevant and useful to children in their own eyes.</p>
<p>In my experience as a bilingualism researcher and as a parent of bilingual children, I have noticed that as adults, we often cite specific reasons for why we want our children to know their mother tongue that are important to us as parents.</p>
<p>We often think about how helpful their mother tongue will be in their adult lives, for their academic test scores and later success, and other real-world factors that don’t always appeal to children.</p>
<p>Instead, thinking about reasons that might resonate with a child may be more effective. What opportunities will children feel they will miss out on if they do not know their mother tongue? Are those opportunities of personal value to the child?</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: The benefits of bilingualism go beyond knowing two languages</a></h3>
<p>Studies have shown that children who see the language as relevant to their personal goals learn it more readily and with greater motivation than those for whom mother tongue use is limited to the classroom.</p>
<p>It’s worth remembering that for each child, the touchpoint with the mother tongue is different. As with most things, young children’s preferences can be highly idiosyncratic.</p>
<p>Learning about what makes your own child tick with regards to the mother tongue and building off that connection with the language can help a child break through motivational barriers.</p>
<p>One of the most common complaints I hear from parents is that their child has stopped talking to them in the mother tongue and only wants to communicate in English.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: Surviving home-based learning in the long haul may require parents to dial back on kiasuism</a></h3>
<p>This is very common: Many children go through a phase where they resist or altogether refuse responding in the mother tongue, even if they can understand what is being said.</p>
<p>When faced with these challenges, it is easy to default back to English. But persistence is key.</p>
<p>Without creating negativity and tension, families should continue to speak in their mother tongue to children to provide continued exposure and gradually build children’s willingness to engage in conversation.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: What hope do monolingual parents have in raising bilingual children?</a></h3>
<p>To help with mother tongue learning, bilingualism researchers have often argued for setting up individualised goals.</p>
<p>BUILDING A PERSONAL CONNECTION WITH MOTHER TONGUE</p>
<p>Building a personal connection with the mother tongue, outside of the classroom, can go a long way towards encouraging its use.</p>
<h3><a>READ: Commentary: It will be a waste if parents don’t keep flexible work arrangements</a></h3>
<p>There is no doubt that raising multilingual children can be challenging for many families. It is most certainly a marathon, not a sprint.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Has COVID-19 bypassed children or could there be dangers unknown? </h1>
<div> <p>Children being infected remain a source of worry for parents, educators, and policy-makers. The pandemic has also taken a toll on their social and educational lives, say two NUH paediatric doctors.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Chan Si Min </a> <a> Olivia Leow </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Since the SARS-COV-2 virus first emerged almost two years ago, adults – particularly the older ones – have borne the brunt of the illness. </p>
<p>Children have been spared so far, with most experiencing asymptomatic or mild illness and no locally reported cases of children requiring oxygen or intensive care treatment. </p>
<p>They may have fever, cough, sore throat, and runny nose. But as things stand, COVID-19 in children here appear to be indistinguishable from the common cold. </p>
<p>This is not to say that we should let our guard down. Data from other countries show rare cases where an entity called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in Children (MIS-C) occurs in children four to six weeks following COVID-19 infection. </p>
<p>Another worry has been a growing concern about “long COVID” in which recovered patients continue to experience prolonged symptoms such as headache, fatigue and aches and pains. </p>
<h2>PSYCHOLOGICAL AND EMOTIONAL STRESS</h2>
<p>Aside from physical illness, COVID-19 also causes significant psychological and emotional stress for families. </p>
<p>Ensuring young children follow pandemic protocols, identifying those susceptible or have infected family members and then dealing with the practical challenges of quarantine and isolation can be challenging.</p>
<p>Children at risk of domestic violence also suffer. In Singapore, the first few weeks of lockdown saw a 22 per cent increase in reports of domestic violence to the police and a 14 per cent increase in referrals to social services for the same.</p>
<p>While children hospitalised with COVID-19 in Singapore are routinely provided psychosocial support, ready and free access to experienced psychologists and social workers for vulnerable families has never been more essential. </p>
<p>Schooling has also been dramatically affected by COVID-19. Home-based learning (HBL) is challenging to implement in less developed countries, with lower income families disadvantaged due to inadequate access to reliable internet and devices. </p>
<p>There are also concerns that interrupted school learning will later negatively impact children’s future earnings.</p>
<p>To reduce disruptions to children and caregivers, face-to-face lessons have commenced for months now. </p>
<p>But this creates another point of anxiety – school-based transmissions. Just how common is it? </p>
<p>A Public Health England study by Sharif A Ismail published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases in Dec 2020 found that the risk reflected that of the community, with school-based transmission increasing in tandem with community transmission rates. </p>
<p>The shift to explore vaccinating children younger than 12 by early 2022 once authorities have studied the safety and efficacy may be a welcome move when keeping children out of school may not be a sustainable solution. </p>
<p>Singapore’s move to impose HBL only on affected classes rather than cohorts can be a good middle ground to keep schools open, so our children’s education do not come to a standstill indefinitely.</p>
<p>This pandemic has altered the childhood of our kids immeasurably. Those of us responsible for their well-being, education and amusement have had to find creative ways to help them thrive. </p>

<h1> Commentary: When adult children choose to move out, relationships can improve </h1>
<div> <p>Marriage does not have to be the reason some adult children move out. Living apart can bring everyone closer, says writer Josephine Chia.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Josephine Chia </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Margaret Fuller, a 19th century American journalist, editor and feminist, said: “A house is no home unless it contains food and fire for the mind, as well as for the body.”</p>
<p>Here in Singapore, the COVID-19 pandemic has impressed upon us, the true meaning of home. </p>
<p>We suddenly have to live in close quarters, for long periods, with our family. Much as we love our family, being thrust continually into their presence, with little respite during the pandemic becomes a challenge. </p>
<p>In the light of this, young millennials or singletons have preferred to set up home away from parents who might cramp their style, so to speak.</p>
<p>The pandemic might have been the push needed for adult children to move out but changing attitudes, plentiful options for renting and higher incomes are also enabling them to leave the parental nest. </p>
<p>Let me illustrate this with an account that might be more common that we think. A young man was home alone when a pipe in the bathroom burst. As he had never dealt with such matters, he didn’t know how to contact a plumber.</p>
<p>He called his father, who was out at dinner, who told him to turn off the “stopcock” immediately.</p>
<p>“What is that?” he asked, bewildered.</p>
<p>When our children move into their own homes, they will make mistakes, but this is exactly what is needed for people need to grow.</p>
<p>There is an important caveat – there may be instances where a young adult child needs his parents to care for him. After all, not every bird can fly until their wings are ready for flight. </p>
<p>In general, most capable young adults live with their parents because it comes with all the attendant plus points. There are cooked meals, laundry is taken care of and the biggest bonus – no amount from a salary needs to go to rent.</p>
<p>In Western societies, a child wanting to move out is not seen as casting an aspersion on someone’s quality of parenting. I would argue it is emotionally healthy for young people to strike out on their own.</p>
<p>While it is true that there is no real impetus to set up a home without marriage, there is one important reason why it may be better – it is a chance for parents to deepen their relationships with their children.</p>
<h2>HEALTHIER RELATIONSHIPS</h2>
<p>In my experience talking to friends, most parents find that adult children living with them hardly have time for meaningful interactions. They often come home late from work, exchange a few greetings, have a meal and disappear into their rooms. </p>
<p>Some parents said they found relationships becoming stronger when their children move out – because when they finally meet, they have a lot to catch up on and these conversations are better too.</p>
<h2>TIME TO ENJOY LIFE WITHOUT CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Those in their 30s and early 40s in Singapore have parents who are from the Merdeka Generation (MG). Many in this generation worked hard to give their families a better life. </p>
<p>It’s perfectly understandable that many of them want to travel, although the pandemic has stalled plans, and enjoy leisure activities that bring them joy and allow them to make new friends. </p>
<p>In a sense, this relationship, now free of day-to-day caregiving is replaced by quiet, equal companionship.</p>
<p>Both parties can meet up regularly to have a nice tete-a-tete, over a meal and the conversation is more about news to share about work or relationships and less about grumbles and complaints or about getting on each other’s nerves.</p>
<p>There’s something to be said about the heart growing much fonder when you don’t see each other every day in the same small space. Despite living apart, you are still together and that is a win-win for everyone.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Squid Game violence has crept into online content targeting young children </h1>
<div> <p>Parents are being warned about children copying games and violence and this might be due to the Netflix show’s presence on social media, says a media researcher.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <a> Jessica Balanzategui </a> </div> </div>
<p>MELBOURNE: The dystopian South Korean horror series Squid Game has become Netflix’s most watched TV series, but it is quickly becoming as controversial as it is popular.</p>
<p>In Squid Game, characters compete for a cash prize by participating in challenges that augment classic Korean children’s games, with the “losers” being killed at the end of each round. </p>
<h2>PERVASIVE PRESENCE ON YOUTUBE AND TIKTOK</h2>
<p>On both the kids’ and main version of YouTube, videos aimed at children feature people - often children - playing these Squid Game-inspired games in Roblox, with the “Red Light, Green Light” challenge emerging as a particularly popular trend. </p>
<p>This challenge is also a trend on TikTok, with people emulating the game in a vast variety of real life settings and in videogames.</p>
<p>The “Red Light, Green Light” scene has become one of Squid Game’s most widely shared moments: The giant animatronic doll that acts as a deadly motion sensor in this game has been used in many Internet memes and often features in video thumbnails.</p>
<p>Most of these YouTube Kids videos are quite innocuous by themselves. However, they show how Squid Game has crept into digital content explicitly targeting young children.</p>
<h2>MURKY BOUNDARIES BETWEEN ADULT AND CHILD-ORIENTED ONLINE CONTENT</h2>
<p>Given the show’s bright, childish aesthetics and focus on playground games, it is perhaps not surprising that viral online content appeals to children. But the boundaries between adult and child-oriented content online have always been murky.</p>
<p>YouTube has been at the centre of a number of controversies regarding inappropriate content aimed at children. </p>
<p>After a historic fine of US$170 million was imposed on YouTube by the US Federal Trade Commission in 2019, sweeping changes were introduced to make the distinction between adult and children’s content clearer on the platform. </p>
<p>For instance, creators must now inform YouTube if their content is for children and machine-learning is used to identify videos that clearly target young audiences.</p>
<p>Despite these changes, YouTube remains a very different beast to broadcast television, and content popular with children on both the main and children’s version of the platform often differs markedly from kids’ TV.</p>
<p>Children’s YouTube content that riffs on Squid Game characters and scenes continues a longstanding trend of “mash-up” content for children on the platform.</p>
<p>Like Squid Game content, mash-up videos harness trending themes, search terms, and characters – often featuring popular characters in thumbnail imagery and video titles.</p>
<p>Adult anxieties about the show’s malign influence on children build on earlier concerns about this mash-up content, but also about children’s interaction with the web more generally.</p>
<p>The rising global panic about children’s participation in Squid Game challenges echoes a phenomenon in 2018 and 2019: A photo of a sinister figure – actually of a Japanese sculpture - became associated with the moniker “Momo” and went viral online.</p>
<p>An international news cycle emerged about Momo, claiming the creature was appearing in children’s content on YouTube and encouraging kids to participate in deadly games and challenges.</p>
<p>As is now occurring in relation to Squid Game, in Australia and beyond, official warnings were issued to parents about the Momo Challenge, advising them to be vigilant. It soon became clear the this was most likely a viral hoax.</p>
<p>The unruly tentacles of Squid Game’s inter-generational appeal show how streaming media challenges existing conceptions of child-appropriate content.</p>

<h1> Commentary: Why normally decisive parents worry about vaccinating young children against COVID-19 </h1>
<div> <div> <a> Edson C Tandoc Jr </a> , <a> May O Lwin </a> , <a> Akshar Saxena </a> , <a> Kim Hye Kyung </a> <a> Zhang Hao Goh </a> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore hopes to extend COVID-19 vaccines for children aged five to 11 from January 2022, said the Ministry of Health (MOH)’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak on Saturday (Nov 20).</p>
<p>It was probably only a matter of time – after countries like the United States and Israel approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for use in that age group earlier this month.</p>
<p>However, numerous opinion polls there show one-third of parents will get their kids vaccinated right away, and another one-third will adopt a “wait-and-see” approach.</p>
<p>On CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast, a mother of three described a “niggling fear” despite published data and professional reassurances.</p>
<p>Comments on social media and messaging app groups reveal common reasons for the apprehension: Possible side effects and whether the risks outweigh the benefits. </p>
<p>Some argue kids are “not likely to be severely affected” pointing out children accounted for only over 8,000 cases out of 250,000 cases reported in Singapore.</p>
<p>Others continue to claim a 2-year-old died during a Pfizer-BioNTech US trial — a falsehood debunked by fact-checkers.</p>
<h2>MORE RISK AVERSE WHEN DECIDING FOR CHILDREN</h2>
<p>Studies have found parents tend to be more risk-averse, especially on physical safety and health, when deciding for their young children than for themselves.</p>
<p>Thus, making a decision that potentially exposes their young children to harm is unthinkable.</p>
<p>We observed online criticism of those advocating for child COVID-19 vaccination as being “terrible people doing such things on innocent children” or “not human” for not standing up for their children.</p>
<p>Because of risk aversion, we still see concern in various countries about the safety of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination, despite studies repeatedly showing it doesn’t cause serious side effects as alleged.</p>
<p>Parents may thus put more weight on the COVID-19 vaccine’s risk of myocarditis, a rare side effect that landed a 16-year-old in ICU in Singapore, or on the chance of yet unknown medical implications on their development and growth.</p>
<p>Other studies have found some parents would rather not make a decision – and accept the risk their children catch a disease naturally as “fate” – than actively decide to vaccinate and potentially proactively bring them harm.</p>
<h2>BUT LESS BELIEF IN ODDS OF SEVERE INFECTION</h2>
<p>Some also believe young children aren’t at risk for COVID-19, and that they’ll recover quickly with no bad outcomes even if infected.</p>
<p>This often undergirds the reasoning for those who believe the risk of side effects from the vaccine outweighs any benefits. </p>
<p>We already observe this with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination - mothers think HPV vaccine is unnecessary if they also think their daughters are at low risk of contracting the virus and prefer a “wait-and-see” attitude.</p>
<p>It’s unsurprising then that some parents may perceive COVID-19 in a similar light. </p>
<p>Other parents also believe since almost everyone else is vaccinated, the risk of their children getting infected with COVID-19 is low – a common argument by those unwilling to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Such parents feel justified in thinking the risks of vaccination outweigh the benefits, when MOH says that fewer children have been sick with COVID-19 compared to adults - even though some cases have developed serious complications.</p>
<h2>USING INFORMATION TO CONVINCE PARENTS?</h2>
<p>Many of these perceptions are shaped by what parents read and see around them. But the barrage of information – from official news sites and anti-vaxxer platforms - makes it difficult for parents to process.</p>
<p>Some posts we saw shared on messaging apps are real news stories, such as Taiwan suspending second Pfizer doses for those aged 12 to 17 amid concerns over myocarditis that make parents question vaccine safety in younger children.</p>
<p>Exposure to inaccurate or exaggerated reports can affect parents’ decisions—a previous study found HPV vaccination rates dropped in Ireland and Denmark in 2016 due to false reports about side effects and anti-vaccination lobbying.</p>
<p>In the Philippines, a measles outbreak erupted in 2019 following a political controversy over the use of a dengue vaccine that lowered overall public confidence in all vaccines.</p>
<p>In another IN-cube survey involving 800 participants in Singapore in July, we found participants living with children reported higher levels of news consumption and spending more time on social media than those who do not.</p>
<p>However, information alone may not convince parents to vaccinate their young children.</p>
<p>For example, a US survey experiment found that government messaging debunking claims that MMR vaccines cause autism did not increase vaccination intention among study participants.</p>
<p>While refutations can reduce misperceptions, they may also lower vaccination intention if they instead reinforce risk aversion by reminding parents of potential risks.</p>
<h2>UNDERSTANDING, NOT INSTINCTIVELY JUDGING, PARENTS</h2>
<p>How parents decide for themselves when it comes to vaccination is different from how they decide for their children. Interventions to encourage people to vaccinate are not automatically transferable when dealing with parents.</p>
<p>First, parents trust health experts they are familiar with and we should encourage them to consult their paediatricians about their hesitation and fears.</p>
<p>So there needs to be deliberate effort to widely disseminate more representative perspectives from parents.</p>
<p>Hearing from young children who got vaccinated against COVID-19 in other countries without experiencing serious side effects may also give parents a more complete picture to guide their decisions.</p>
<p>Who knows if vaccination may eventually be extended even to children below five? There will certainly be more anxious parents. </p>
<p>This anxiety stems from parents caring about their children - taking to heart their role of protecting their little ones. Thus, we must delve deeper into understanding and allaying parents’ fears instead of instinctively judging them.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> COP26 told climate pledges 'hollow' without fossil fuel phase out </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>GLASGOW: Climate promises from nations ring "hollow" while they continue to invest in oil, gas and coal, UN chief Antonio Guterres said on Thursday (Nov 11), as the COP26 summit struggled to make headway on its goal to halt devastating warming.</p>
<p>Representatives from nearly 200 countries have gathered in Glasgow for painstaking talks aimed at keeping the world within the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature rise to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>But with emissions still rising and current promises putting the world on a path to heat far beyond that target, negotiators were wrangling over a range of issues.</p>
<p>"The announcements here in Glasgow are encouraging - but they are far from enough," Guterres told the COP26 climate summit, urging negotiators to "pick up the pace".</p>
<p>"Promises ring hollow when the fossil fuels industry still receives trillions in subsidies."</p>
<p>Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate said delegates had "two pathways" to choose from.</p>
<p>"There is the pathway of commitments and hype and promises and fanciful Net Zero targets and happily ever after," she told the plenary.</p>
<p>"And then there is the pathway of the best available science, of ever stronger storms and droughts and floods of toxic polluted air of real people suffering and dying."</p>
<p>COP26 President Alok Sharma warned that time was running short to clinch a deal before the meeting's scheduled end on Friday evening.</p>
<p>"We still have a monumental challenge ahead of us," he said, appealing to delegates to show more ambition.</p>
<p>"Quite a lot has been achieved. But we are still some way away from finalising those very critical issues that are still outstanding."</p>
<p>He welcomed a joint China-US pact to accelerate climate action this decade, which experts said should allay fears that tensions visible early in the summit might derail the talks.</p>
<p>The 2015 Paris Agreement saw nations promise to limit heating to "well below" two degrees Celsius and to work towards a safer 1.5 degrees Celsius cap through sweeping emissions cuts.</p>
<p>The 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming so far is already magnifying weather extremes, subjecting communities across the world to more intense fire and drought, displacement and severe economic hardship.</p>
<p>But the UN says that even the most up-to-date national pledges set Earth on course to warm 2.7 degrees Celsius this century.</p>
<p>More than 200 scientists sent an open letter to the summit Thursday urging countries to take "immediate, strong, rapid, sustained and large-scale actions" to halt global warming.</p>
<p>A handful of nations committed to phasing out oil and gas production, in what organisers Denmark and Costa Rica hope will inspire a global movement towards the ending of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>"The fossil era must come to an end," said Danish Climate, Energy and Utilities Minister Dan Jorgensen.</p>
<p>"But just as the Stone Age did not end due to lack of stone, the fossil era will not end because there's no more oil left in the ground. It will end because governments decided to do the right thing."</p>
<p>However major emitters were not part of the initiative.</p>
<p>Egypt was on Thursday was confirmed as the host of COP27, due for 2022, while the United Arab Emirates will host COP28 in 2023.</p>
<p>Wednesday saw the release of draft "decisions", which were the first real indication of where nations are 10 days into deeply technical discussions.</p>
<p>The text, which is sure to change during ministerial debates, called for nations to "revisit and strengthen" their new climate plans, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by next year, instead of 2025 as previously agreed.</p>
<p>The issues that remain unresolved at the COP26 include how vulnerable nations are supported financially to green their economies and prepare for future shocks.</p>
<p>Rules over transparency, common reporting of climate action and carbon markets are all also still under discussion.</p>
<p>Also contentious is wording in the draft text to "accelerate the phasing-out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels", something which large emitters are opposing, according to sources close to the talks.</p>
<p>And nations already hit by climate disasters are demanding "loss and damage" support from rich emitters.</p>
<p>But the main sticking point is ambition: which countries plan to slash their carbon emissions fast enough to avert dangerous heating.</p>
<p>"We need action if commitments are to pass the credibility test," Guterres said, urging negotiators not to settle for a lowest common denominator outcome.</p>
<p>"We know what must be done."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Pope tells abused mother domestic violence 'nearly satanic' </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>ROME: Pope Francis has denounced domestic violence against woman as “nearly satanic” and said parents should never slap their children.</p>
<p>The abused woman told the pope her story and asked him how she can find her dignity after she and her children suffered so much violence.</p>
<p>Francis, who has previously spoken out about “femicides”, responded by acknowledging the problem of domestic violence, which regularly makes headlines in Italy.</p>
<p>“For me the problem is nearly satanic, because it’s about profiting off the weakness of those who can’t defend themselves, who can only try to stop the blows,” he said. “It’s humiliating, very humiliating.”</p>
<p>He then added that it was also “humiliating” for a parent to slap a child. “I always say it: Never slap a child in his or her face. Why? Because your face is your dignity.”</p>
<p>Responding directly to the abused woman’s question, Francis told her that she has not lost her dignity at all.</p>
<p>“I can sense your dignity. If you had lost your dignity, you wouldn’t be here,” he said, urging her to be inspired by the image of the Pieta, the statue of Mary cradling the crucified Jesus.</p>
<p>“Look at the Madonna, and remember that image of courage,” he said.</p>

<p>VATICAN CITY: Pope Francis in his Christmas message on Saturday (Dec 25) decried increasing polarisation in personal and international relationships, saying that only dialogue can resolve conflicts ranging from family feuds to threats of war.</p>
<p>In his Urbi et Orbi ("to the city and the world") message, he called on individuals and world leaders to talk to each other rather than dig in their heels, a distancing he said has been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Francis, who turned 85 last week, listed conflicts, tensions or crises in Syria, Yemen, Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Ukraine, Sudan, South Sudan and elsewhere.</p>
<p>"We continue to witness a great number of conflicts, crises and disagreements," he said, speaking from the same balcony where he first appeared to the world as pope after his election on Mar 13, 2013.</p>

<p>Francis asked God to "give serenity and unity to families", praising those who strive to keep them and communities together in such divisive times.</p>
<p>"Let us ask him for the strength to be open to dialogue. On this festive day, let us implore him to stir up in the hearts of everyone a yearning for reconciliation and fraternity," he said.</p>
<p>He used the word "dialogue" 11 times in a speech of little more than two pages as he spoke to people huddled under rain parkas and umbrellas.</p>
<p>Francis asked God to "prevent fresh outbreaks of a long-festering conflict" in Ukraine, which has accused Russia of <a>massing tens of thousands of troops</a> in preparation for a possible large-scale military offensive.</p>
<p>Russia denies planning any attack and accuses Ukraine and the United States of destabilising behaviour, saying that it needs security guarantees for its own protection.</p>
<p>He asked people not to be indifferent to the plight of migrants, refugees, the displaced, political prisoners and women who are victims of violence, and urged leaders to protect the environment for future generations.</p>
<p>In his Christmas Eve Mass on Friday night in St Peter's Basilica, Francis said that people who are indifferent to the poor offend God, and urged all to "look beyond all the lights and decorations" and remember the neediest.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Christmas without restrictions in Omicron-free New Zealand </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>WELLINGTON: New Zealanders celebrated Christmas on Saturday (Dec 25) in the warmth of mid-summer with few restrictions, in one of the few countries in the world largely untouched by the Omicron variant of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Ninety-five per cent of adults in New Zealand have had at least one dose of the vaccine, making it one of the world's most vaccinated populations. The only Omicron cases that have been found in New Zealand have been safely contained at the border.</p>
<p>The Delta variant penetrated New Zealand’s defences in August and its largest city, Auckland, was thrust into lockdown for 188 days. At its peak, the outbreak saw around 220 cases a day. Lately, the daily average has been around 50.</p>
<p>At New Zealand’s Scott Base in Antarctica, some New Zealanders enjoyed a white Christmas. During summer on the frozen continent, the sun never dips below the horizon and in 24 hours of daylight the temperature hovers around 0 degrees Celsius.</p>
<p>Most Pacific Island nations whose health systems might have been overwhelmed by COVID-19 outbreaks have largely managed to keep out the virus through strict border controls and high vaccination numbers.</p>
<p>Health Secretary James Fong, in a Christmas message, urged Fijians to “please celebrate wisely”.</p>
<p>In remote Macuata provice, residents of four villages received a special Christmas present: Electricity was connected to their villages for the first time.</p>
<p>In his Christmas message, Prime Minister Scott Morrison referenced COVID-19's toll on society.</p>
<p>“This pandemic, it continues to buffet us,” Morrison said. “The Omicron variant is just the latest challenge that we have faced. But together, always together and only together, we keep pushing through.”</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, a student driver in the Northern Territory made off with a truck containing more than US$10,000 in Christmas hams that was empty when it was found.</p>
<p>“This behaviour can only be described as Grinch-like,” police detective Mark Bland said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> US airlines scrap nearly 1,000 Christmas Day flights due to Omicron </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>At least one airline said that it expects hundreds more cancellations on Sunday.</p>
<p>United Airlines cancelled 230 flights while American Airlines called off 90 flights, representatives for the companies said in separate statements.</p>
<p>"We are working hard to rebook as many people as possible and get them on their way for the holidays," she said.</p>

<p>Globally, FlightAware data showed that just over 2,700 flights were called off on Saturday and another 7,049 were delayed, as of 530pm EST.</p>
<p>Not all airlines were affected equally. A spokesperson for Southwest Airlines said there were no issues to report with the carrier's flights on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Omicron variant was first detected in November and now accounts for nearly three-quarters of US cases and as many as 90 per cent in some areas, such as the Eastern Seaboard.</p>
<p>The average number of new US coronavirus cases has risen 45 per cent to 179,000 per day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally.</p>
<p>While recent research suggests Omicron produces milder illness and a lower rate of hospitalisations than previous variants of COVID-19, health officials have maintained a cautious note about the outlook.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Christmas holiday, Americans scrambled for COVID-19 tests and many went ahead with their travel plans.</p>
<p>US officials have said that people who are fully vaccinated should feel comfortable proceeding with holiday travel.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Australia's New South Wales sets new daily COVID-19 case record </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>New South Wales reported 6,394 new infections, up from 6,288 a day earlier. Case numbers in the state have surged over the past two weeks but hospitalisations have lagged behind new infections.</p>
<p>“We would expect that pretty well everybody in New South Wales at some point will get Omicron,” Hazzard said. “If we’re all going to get Omicron, the best way to face it is when we have full vaccinations including our booster.”</p>
<p>Health officials reported 458 active cases in hospitals across the state, up sharply from 388 the day before. There were 52 people in intensive care in New South Wales.</p>
<p>Victoria, the country's second most populous state, reported 1,608 new COVID-19 cases and two deaths on Sunday, with 374 people in hospitals, including 77 in intensive care.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 people in Victoria spent Christmas isolating at home, unable to celebrate with family or friends. Of those, about half were reported to be active cases who contracted the virus in the days leading up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Doctors and pharmacists in New South Wales have said they are running short of vaccine doses amid a rush for shots spurred by concern over the omicron variant.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> First Omicron COVID-19 case detected in Gaza, Palestinians say </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>GAZA: The Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday (Dec 26) it had identified the first case of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The carrier is a Gaza resident who was infected within the coastal territory, ministry official Majdi Dhair told a news conference.</p>
<p>Dhair said this meant the variant, first identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong last month, existed in Gaza and was now spreading among the population. The discovery poses a new challenge to the enclave's under-developed health system.</p>
<p>"We are ahead of difficult days. It is expected that the Omicron variant will spread fast," he told reporters.</p>
<p>Gaza, with a population of 2.2 million people, has registered 189,837 COVID-19 infections and 1,691 deaths.</p>
<p>Dhair urged Gazans to get vaccinated, putting the percentage of those who had already received shots at around 40 per cent.</p>
<p>In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, three cases of Omicron variant had been detected among Palestinians on Dec 16 and the number had since risen to 23 among the 3.1 million population, Palestinian health authorities said.</p>

<p>PRISTINA: Kosovo's health ministry said on Sunday it had registered its first nine cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the Balkan country.</p>
<p>The ministry said that out of 22 people who tested positive to COVID-19 in the past 10 days, nine had been identified as Omicron variant.</p>
<p>The ministry said that out of the nine, two people came from the United States, two from the UK, one from France and four other cases were Kosovars who have not travelled outside the country.</p>
<p>The ministry added that “the Omicron variant is expected to worsen the epidemiologic situation in the country.”</p>
<p>Kosovo has seen a relatively calm period in the past weeks with only 12 positive cases and one death on Sunday.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Iran, Hezbollah aid Yemen rebel strikes: Saudi-led coalition </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>RIYADH: The Saudi-led coalition on Sunday (Dec 26) accused Iran and Hezbollah of helping Yemen's Huthi rebels to launch missiles and drones at the kingdom, where two people were killed.</p>
<p>Since the coalition intervened almost seven years ago to support Yemen's government, Saudi Arabia has regularly accused Iran of supplying the Huthis with sophisticated weapons and Hezbollah of training the insurgents.</p>
<p>Tehran denies the charges. Lebanon's Iran-backed Shiite militant movement Hezbollah has previously denied sending fighters or weapons to Yemen.</p>
<p>The latest Saudi accusation came as the coalition intensified an aerial bombing campaign against the Iran-backed Huthis in retaliation for deadly attacks on the kingdom.</p>
<p>Coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki told a news conference the Huthis were "militarising" Sanaa airport and using it as a "main centre for launching ballistic missiles and drones" towards the kingdom.</p>
<p>Malki showed reporters a video clip which he said depicted "the headquarters of Iranian and Hezbollah experts at the airport" where, he alleged, "Hezbollah is training the Huthis to booby-trap and use drones".</p>
<p>Malki showed other clips which he said showed a Hezbollah member placing explosives in a drone, and a man he identified as a Hezbollah official telling Huthi members "we must strengthen our ranks".</p>
<p>The footage could not be independently verified.</p>
<p>The Arab military coalition led by Riyadh intervened in Yemen in 2015 to back the internationally recognised government, a year after the Huthis overran the capital Sanaa.</p>
<p>Since then, tens of thousands of people have been killed, in what the United Nations has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>The Huthis come from the minority Zaidi Shiite sect of Islam and have their traditional stronghold in the mountainous north of Yemen.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2010, they fought six wars against Yemen's then-government and battled Saudi Arabia in 2009-2010 after storming over the border.</p>
<p>The deaths of two people overnight Friday from a rebel missile strike on the Saudi city of Jazan were the first such deaths in the kingdom in three years.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Malki said the international community must "stop hostile acts by this terrorist organisation," a reference to Hezbollah.</p>
<p>Since January 2018, he said, the Huthis have launched 430 ballistic missiles and 850 drones towards Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Earlier Sunday the coalition said it had struck a Huthi rebel camp in Sanaa, destroying weapons warehouses.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the coalition launched what it called a "large-scale" military operation against the Huthis after the rebel missile strike that hit Jazan.</p>
<p>The coalition raids left three civilians dead, including a child and a woman, Yemeni medics told AFP.</p>
<p>Rights groups have criticised the coalition for civilian casualties in its years-long aerial bombardment.</p>
<p>The coalition maintains its operations are carried out in accordance with international humanitarian law, repeatedly urging the Huthis against using civilians as human shields.</p>
<p>Malki also accused Iran's ambassador to Sanaa, who died of COVID-19 last week after his evacuation from Yemen, of "leading the planning of military operations in Marib" - the Yemeni government's last stronghold in the north.</p>
<p>The Huthis warned in a statement that they will "face escalation with escalation".</p>
<p>World powers and the kingdom's Gulf Arab allies condemned the rebels' deadly strike on Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>"Huthi attacks are perpetuating the conflict, prolonging the suffering of the Yemeni people, and endangering the Saudi people alongside more than 70,000 US citizens residing in Saudi Arabia," Washington's embassy to Riyadh said in a statement.</p>
<p>The coalition has intensified its air strikes on Sanaa, including last week on what it called "military targets" at the airport.</p>
<p>United Nations aid flights were interrupted as a result.</p>
<p>The insurgents often launch missiles and drones into Saudi Arabia aimed at its airports and oil infrastructure.</p>
<p>The UN's World Food Programme said it has been "forced" to cut aid to Yemen due to lack of funds, and warned of a surge in hunger.</p>
