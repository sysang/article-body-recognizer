<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Iran bars travellers from parts of Western Europe over Omicron fears </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>DUBAI: Iran has banned the entry of travellers from Britain, France, Denmark and Norway for 15 days as part of curbs following the discovery of the highly transmissible Omicron variant of COVID-19 in the Middle East's worst-hit country.</p>
<p>State television said on Sunday a similar ban imposed in late November on travellers from South Africa and seven neighbouring countries was also extended for 15 days.</p>
<p>Health authorities also indefinitely halted land travel to neighbouring Turkey, a popular tourist destination, the broadcaster said.</p>
<p>Iran, the pandemic's epicentre in the Middle East, has reported just 14 confirmed Omicron cases so far but media reports said detection kits were not widely available and officials have warned of a possible rapid spread within weeks.</p>
<p>The country has suffered 131,400 deaths in five waves of COVID-19 infections since February 2020.</p>
<p>Nearly 51.3 million of Iran's population of about 85 million have received two doses of coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Iraqi Kurds mourn their dead in Channel drowning </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>RANYA, Irak: If I don't call you back, it's because I will be in England," Shakar Ali said in his last message to his family as he attempted to cross the Channel from France to Britain.</p>
<p>But the inflatable boat he took along with around 30 other irregular migrants would never reach British shores.</p>
<p>Nearly a month after at least 27 of those migrants drowned, families of 16 of them finally got some closure on Sunday as their bodies arrived in Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>
<p>The remains arrived before dawn at the airport in the Iraqi Kurdish regional capital Arbil, where dozens of men, women and children had gathered.</p>
<p>Among the mourners, some embraced and black-clad women wept while others showed pictures of their lost kin.</p>
<p>Clutching his cane to his chest, an elderly man with a white beard showed a photo on his phone of his son Afrasia, who was just 24 years old.</p>
<p>The November 24 tragedy has been described by the International Organization for Migration as the largest single loss of life in the English Channel since the UN agency started recording data in 2014.</p>
<p>The plain wooden coffins were placed in ambulances that transported them to their hometowns of Darbandikhan, Qadrawa, Ranya and Soran.</p>
<p>A woman sobbed as she pressed her face up against a window pane. Close by, two teenagers appeared similarly shaken. One of them rested his head against a casket, bidding his final farewell.</p>
<p>In the centre of Ranya, hundreds gathered in a mosque to honour the three victims from the Kurdish town.</p>
<p>The bodies were washed in the traditional Muslim way. The crowd filled a large prayer hall, and in the heavy silence, the murmurs of funerary prayers could be heard.</p>
<p>Shakar Ali, 30, left his home two months ago, making the long trip via Turkey, Greece, then Italy, before his Mediterranean journey ended in France.</p>
<p>"He attempted the crossing to Britain seven times," his older brother Shamal said. "Each time, he failed."</p>
<p>Three years earlier, Shakar, who had a degree in petroleum geology, was searching for a job.</p>
<p>"He was unemployed until his departure," his brother, a teacher, continued.</p>
<p>He blamed the recent tragedy on the lack of job opportunities, as well as the policies of the authorities in the autonomous Kurdistan region.</p>
<p>"Because of this, hundreds of families have lost a child."</p>
<p>At the cemetery in Ranya, the young man's shrouded body was lifted on the shoulders of the men of the family.</p>
<p>A crowd gathered as the body was lowered into the grave.</p>
<p>The youngest of the family, Ramyar, recalled his last conversation with his brother.</p>
<p>"He told us 'We have started the crossing. If I call you, it means the coast guard has arrested us'," the 20-year-old recounted.</p>
<p>"'If I don't call you back, it's because I will have arrived in England'," he continued.</p>
<p>Initially set to arrive on Friday, the repatriation of the 16 Iraqi Kurdish victims was postponed twice.</p>
<p>Among the 26 bodies identified in France were 17 men and seven women aged between 19 and 46, as well as a 16-year-old and a seven-year-old child.</p>
<p>In addition to the 16 Iraqi Kurds, the victims also included an Iranian Kurd, a Somalian, four Afghans and an Egyptian.</p>
<p>Only two survivors were found, an Iraqi Kurd and a Sudanese national.</p>
<p>French investigators are still trying to establish a clearer picture of what happened during the disaster.</p>
<p>They have been investigating reports that the passengers had telephoned both French and British emergency services, appealing for help when the vessel began sinking.</p>
<p>At the airport in Arbil, the family of young Baran hung a banner on the back of a moving ambulance that carried her body back to her hometown of Soran.</p>
<p>On the banner alongside a smiling picture of the young woman it said "Bride of the sea".</p>
<p>Maryam Nuri Hama Amin - known as "Baran" to her family, a name meaning "rain" in Kurdish - was only in her 20s when she set off on the trip.</p>
<p>She was one of the first Kurdish victims to be identified from the disaster.</p>
<p>She was planning on joining her fiance, who was already in Britain, in the hope of seeking a "better life" there, her father had told AFP shortly after the tragedy.</p>
<p>While the tragedy was the worst recorded in the Channel, at least 30 people have died this week alone in three shipwrecks off the coasts of Greek islands.</p>
<p>Among the survivors were Syrians, Egyptians and Iraqis.</p>

<li> <a> CNA Eyewitness</a> <ul> <li> Send us a news tip </li> </ul> </li>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Israel sets goal of doubling number of Jewish settlers on Golan Heights </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>JERUSALEM: Israel's government set a goal on Sunday (Dec 26) of doubling the number of Jewish settlers in the Golan Heights within five years, a move that could tighten its hold on the territory it occupied in fighting with Syria in 1967.</p>
<p>Under a blueprint approved by the cabinet, which held its weekly session on the Golan, some 7,300 housing units will be built in Katzrin, Israel's main settlement in the area, and in smaller Jewish communities.</p>
<p>"The aim of the decision is to double the number of (Israeli) residents in the Golan in the coming years, meaning an addition of 23,000 people in the area," a statement issued by Bennett's office said.</p>
<p>It said two new Golan settlements are also planned, and that 4,000 homes would be built there. Some 20,000 Druze, most of whom still identify as Syrian, also live in the Golan.</p>
<p>Israel annexed the 1,200-square-kilometre Golan Heights in 1981, a move that was not recognised by the international community. Syria demands the return of the strategic plateau, which also overlooks Lebanon and borders Jordan.</p>
<p>"It goes without saying that the Golan Heights are Israeli," Bennett told his cabinet in broadcast remarks.</p>
<p>"The fact that the Trump administration recognised that, and the fact that the Biden administration made clear there is no change in that policy, is also important." he said.</p>
<p>"Legal questions are something else and over time, if the situation were to change in Syria, that's something we look at, but we are nowhere near that," Blinken said.</p>
<p>Israeli settlement in the Golan has been on a much smaller scale than in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas also captured in a 1967 war and sought by the Palestinians for a future state.</p>
<p>Unlike the West Bank, where many settlers claim a biblical link to the land and thousands commute to jobs in nearby Israeli cities, the more remote Golan offers limited employment opportunities.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Moscow considering NATO proposal to hold talks on Jan 12: TASS </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MOSCOW: Russia has received a NATO proposal to commence talks on Moscow's security concerns on Jan. 12 and is considering it, TASS news agency quoted the Foreign Ministry as saying on Sunday (Dec 26).</p>
<p>Russia, which has unnerved the West with a troop buildup near Ukraine, last week unveiled a wish list of security proposals it wants to negotiate, including a promise NATO would give up any military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine.</p>
<p>"We have already received this (NATO) offer, and we are considering it," TASS quoted the foreign ministry as saying.</p>
<p>US President Joe Biden's administration has said some of Russia's security proposals are obviously unacceptable, but that Washington will respond with more concrete ideas on the format of any talks.</p>
<p>In an interview on CBS' Face The Nation television show, Vice President Kamala Harris said Washington has been in direct conversations with Moscow about the issue and reiterated the US commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity.</p>
<p>"We've been very clear that we are prepared to issue sanctions like you've not seen before," Harris said, but declined to elaborate on the specifics of the sanctions.</p>
<p>The United States, the European Union and the Group of Seven have all warned Putin that he will face "massive consequences" including tough economic sanctions in the event of any new Russian aggression.</p>
<p>The Kremlin's demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine - that the West has already ruled out.</p>
<p>Others would imply the removal of US nuclear weapons from Europe and the withdrawal of multinational NATO battalions from Poland and from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that were once in the Soviet Union.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Israeli hospital to give fourth COVID-19 vaccine shot in trial </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>JERUSALEM: A major Israeli hospital will begin administering a fourth COVID-19 vaccine shot to 150 staff on Monday (Dec 27) in a trial aimed at gauging whether a second booster is necessary nationwide, the facility said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sheba Medical Center near Tel Aviv said its trial would shed light on the efficacy of a fourth dose and help decision-makers set health policy in Israel and abroad.</p>
<p>Israel has reported 1,118 confirmed cases of the fast-spreading Omicron coronavirus variant, with the number of people infected by it doubling every two days.</p>
<p>A Health Ministry panel of experts has recommended offering a fourth dose of the Pfizer /BioNTech vaccine to Israelis aged 60 and over who received a booster shot at least four months ago.</p>
<p>But final approval by the ministry's director-general is still pending amid public debate as to whether sufficient scientific information is available to justify a new booster drive.</p>
<p>Sheba Medical Center did not say how long its trial would last.</p>
<p>The 150 Sheba medical workers taking part in the trial, which the hospital said had received Health Ministry approval, got booster shots no later than Aug 20.</p>
<p>Separately, Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's office said he tested negative on Sunday for COVID-19 after his 14-year-old daughter was infected. It said he would self-isolate.</p>

<li> <a> CNA Eyewitness</a> <ul> <li> Send us a news tip </li> </ul> </li>
<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Crossbow-carrying intruder detained at Queen's castle in UK </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>LONDON: A man armed with a crossbow who broke into Windsor Castle, where Queen Elizabeth II is spending Christmas, has been arrested and detained for mental health treatment, police said on Sunday (Dec 26).</p>
<p>"Security processes were triggered within moments of the man entering the grounds and he did not enter any buildings," said a statement from London's Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p>"Following a search of the man, a crossbow was recovered," it added.</p>
<p>The incident happened as the Queen spent a low-key Christmas Day at Windsor Castle, west of London, with her eldest son and heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.</p>
<p>Local police on Saturday said they had found a 19-year-old man at 8.30am on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>The teenager was arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon.</p>
<p>"The man was taken into custody and has undergone a mental health assessment - he has since been sectioned under the Mental Health Act and remains in the care of medical professionals," said the Metropolitan police.</p>
<p>The Mental Health Act allows the authorities in England and Wales to detain and treat people with mental health issues without their consent.</p>
<p>Those held under the legislation are deemed to be a risk to themselves or others.</p>
<p>The Sunday Mirror newspaper said CCTV operators spotted a man carrying what appeared to be a crossbow, while the Mail on Sunday said the man used a rope ladder to scale a fence.</p>
<p>"We can confirm security processes were triggered within moments of the man entering the grounds and he did not enter any buildings," police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"Members of the royal family have been informed about the incident."</p>
<p>Although the intruder appears to have been intercepted early, it recalls an earlier, more serious intrusion in 1982.</p>
<p>On that occasion, a man in his 30s entered Queen Elizabeth's private chambers at Buckingham Palace while she was in bed before police apprehended him.</p>
<p>In July, a man was arrested after scaling the gates of the Palace.</p>
<p>And in 2020, a homeless man scaled the walls and bedded down for the night in the grounds before being caught.</p>
<p>The Queen usually celebrates Christmas at her Sandringham estate in eastern England, but she remained at Windsor Castle this year after the trip was cancelled as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>The 95-year-old's daughter Princess Anne was isolating after her husband tested positive for coronavirus, with Britain this week registering record-high case numbers fuelled by the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>British tabloid The Sun had reported that 16 family members would join the Queen for Christmas, while her grandson Prince William would stay with his family in southeastern England.</p>
<p>Elizabeth was also marking her first Christmas without her husband of 73 years Prince Philip, who died aged 99 in April and was Britain's longest-serving consort.</p>
<p>The monarch paid tribute to Philip in her traditional Christmas Day message to the nation broadcast on Saturday, referring to "one familiar laugh missing this year".</p>
<p>The Queen - already Britain's longest-reigning monarch - is due to celebrate her Platinum Jubilee next year to mark 70 years since her accession to the throne in 1952.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Singapore </a> </p> <h1> Singapore lifts travel ban for 10 African countries </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SINGAPORE: Singapore has lifted its ban on passengers from 10 African countries from entering or transiting in the country, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said late on Sunday (Dec 26).</p>
<p>The countries are: Botswana, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>From 11.59pm on Sunday, passengers arriving in Singapore with travel history to these countries within the past 14 days will come under the country's Category IV border measures. </p>
<p>MOH said it initially addoped a "more cautious risk containment approach" to reduce the spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant into Singapore. </p>
<p>"The Omicron variant has since spread widely around the world," it said, adding that Singapore is updating its travel restrictions accordingly. </p>
<p>"As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID-resilient nation."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> Sustainability </a> </p> <h1> Weather disasters cost US$20 billion more than last year: NGO </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>PARIS: The ten most expensive weather disasters this year caused more than US$170 billion in damage, US$20 billion more than in 2020, a British aid group said Monday.</p>
<p>Each year, UK charity Christian Aid calculates the cost of weather incidents like flooding, fires and heat waves according to insurance claims and reports the results.</p>
<p>In 2020, it found the world's ten costliest weather disasters caused US$150 billion in damage, making this year's total an increase of 13 per cent.</p>
<p>Christian Aid said the upward trend reflects the effects of man-made climate change and added that the ten disasters in question also killed at least 1,075 people and displaced 1.3 million.</p>
<p>Spectacular and deadly flooding in Germany and Belgium in July was next on the list at US$43 billion in losses.</p>
<p>A cold snap and winter storm in Texas that took out the vast state's power grid cost US$23 billion, followed by flooding in China's Henan province in July that cost an estimated US$17.6 billion.</p>
<p>Other disasters costing several billion dollars include flooding in Canada, a late spring freeze in France that damaged vineyards, and a cyclone in India and Bangladesh in May.</p>
<p>The report acknowledged its evaluation mainly covers disasters in rich countries where infrastructure is better insured and that the financial toll of disasters on poor countries is often incalculable.</p>
<p>It gave the example of South Sudan where flooding affected around 800,000 people.</p>
<p>"Some of the most devastating extreme weather events in 2021 hit poorer nations, which have contributed little to causing climate change," the report's press release noted.</p>
<p>In mid-December, the world's biggest reinsurer, Swiss Re, estimated natural catastrophes and extreme weather events caused around US$250 billion in damage this year.</p>
<p>It said the total represented a 24 per cent increase over last year and that the cost to the insurance industry alone was the fourth highest since 1970. </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> US monitoring COVID-hit holiday cruise ships </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>MIAMI: US authorities on Sunday (Dec 26) were monitoring dozens of cruise ships hit by COVID-19 cases, with several reportedly denied port in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Over 60 vessels were under observation after "reported cases of COVID-19 have met the threshold for CDC investigation", the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported that several cruise liners were denied port at their scheduled destinations.</p>
<p>Brenda Hammer, who was set to board the Odyssey of the Seas, a Royal Caribbean cruise ship, told AFP: "I'm a little nervous about it. I wasn't sure I still wanted to come."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, 55 people on the ship tested positive for COVID-19 which spread among passengers and crew members despite 95 per cent of people on board being vaccinated, the company said.</p>
<p>Hammer, 69, said that she ultimately decided to go ahead with her vacation because "I already paid my money".</p>

<p>The ship did not dock at the Caribbean islands of Curacao and Aruba, the last scheduled stops on its eight-day voyage out of precaution, before it returned to port at Fort Lauderdale, Florida on Sunday.</p>
<p>"We're just being optimistic about everything, even if we can't get off, we've got all our friends with us and hopefully everything inside is on," said Brij Patel, 45, ahead of boarding.</p>
<p>Another ship, the Carnival Freedom, was turned away from the Caribbean island of Bonaire, the Post reported.</p>
<p>In a statement to AFP, Carnival confirmed that "a small number on board were isolated due to a positive COVID test".</p>
<p>The Carnival Freedom arrived in Miami Sunday morning, debarked all guests and "will depart on its next voyage as planned", the company said, adding if it was denied entry to a certain port it would work "to find an alternative destination".</p>
<p>It added the CDC was "fully informed and supportive of our protocols and operational plans".</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> New York sees increase in hospitalised children as Omicron hammers US </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>WASHINGTON: With Omicron cases on the rise, New York health officials have reported an increase in hospitalised children, as the White House promised on Sunday (Dec 26) to quickly resolve the United States' COVID-19 test shortage.</p>
<p>The New York State Department of Health warned "of an upward trend in pediatric hospitalisations associated with COVID-19", in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>In New York City, it "identified four-fold increases in COVID-19 hospital admissions for children 18 and under beginning the week of Dec 5 through the current week", it said.</p>
<p>About half of the admissions are younger than five, an age group that is vaccine ineligible, the department added.</p>
<p>The number of COVID-19 cases in the United States is on the rise, with an average of nearly 190,000 new infections daily over the past seven days, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>The arrival of the new Omicron variant, compounded by holiday celebrations that typically include travel and family reunions, have caused a rush on tests in the United States, where it is difficult to get one in many locations.</p>
<p>Top US pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci on Sunday acknowledged a COVID-19 "testing problem" and vowed to make more tests available to Americans next month.</p>
<p>"One of the problems is that that's not going to be totally available to everyone until we get to January and there are still some issues now of people having trouble getting tested," Fauci told ABC News.</p>
<p>"But we're addressing the testing problem," he added, saying it should be corrected "very soon".</p>
<p>On Tuesday, President Joe Biden announced a raft of new measures as the United States battles its latest COVID-19 surge, including shipping half a billion free home tests in the wake of the Christmastime testing crunch.</p>
<p>However, the White House, whose strategy has for weeks been mainly focused on vaccinations, has faced strong criticism over the fact that many tests will not be available until January.</p>
<h2>"EXTRAORDINARILY CONTAGIOUS"</h2>
<p>Fauci on Sunday emphasised that the administration was ramping up to tackle the spike and stressed that Omicron was "extraordinarily contagious".</p>
<p>Apart from overwhelming hospitals and COVID-19 testing sites, the COVID-19 variant has forced the <a>cancellation of hundreds of flights</a> in the United States, as crews called in sick or had to quarantine after exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>Recent studies in South Africa and Britain indicate that Omicron was less likely to lead to hospitalisation than the previous strains of the virus and that the duration of hospital stays and oxygen needs for patients were lower, Fauci noted.</p>
<p>But he also warned that Omicron's apparent lower severity is likely to be neutralized by how fast it is spreading.</p>
<p>"The issue that we don't want to get complacent about ... is that when you have such a high volume of new infections, it might override a real diminution in severity," Fauci said.</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> For third day, COVID-19 crimps Americans' holiday travels </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>Commercial airlines had cancelled 1,318 flights within, into or out of the United States by mid-afternoon, according to a tally on flight-tracking website FlightAware.com.</p>
<p>At least three cruise ships were forced to return to port without making scheduled port calls after COVID-19 cases were detected on board, according to multiple media reports.</p>
<p>It was the third straight day of pain for some Americans traveling over the weekend as the Christmas holidays, typically a peak time for travel, coincided with a rapid spread of the Omicron variant nationwide.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, warned of rising US cases in coming days and potentially "overrun ... hospitals, particularly in those regions in which you have a larger proportion of unvaccinated individuals".</p>
<p>"It likely will go much higher," he said of the Omicron-driven surge even as President Joe Biden last week unveiled new actions aimed at containing the latest wave and continued urging vaccinations and other prevention strategies.</p>
<p>With rising infections, airlines have been forced to cancel flights with pilots and cabin crew needing to quarantine while poor weather in some areas added to travellers woes.</p>
<p>Enjoli Rodriguez, 25, whose Delta Air Lines flight from Los Angeles to Lexington, Kentucky, was cancelled on Christmas Eve, was one of the thousands still stranded on Sunday.</p>
<p>Delta rebooked Rodriguez on an early afternoon flight that connected in Detroit, but that flight was delayed by hours so she missed the connection to Lexington.</p>
<p>Speaking from the Detroit airport on Sunday, Rodriguez said she was surrounded by angry passengers, flustered airline representatives and families with young children in limbo.</p>
<p>"I’ve run into a lot of people sharing their horror stories here. We’re all just stuck in Michigan, Detroit, heading different places,” Rodriguez, who was rebooked on a later flight to Kentucky, told Reuters.</p>

<p>A total of 997 flights were scrapped on Christmas Day and nearly 700 on Christmas Eve. Thousands more were delayed on all three days.</p>
<p>A Delta Airlines spokesperson said "winter weather in portions of the US and the Omicron variant continued to impact" its holiday weekend flight schedule but that it was working to "reroute and substitute aircraft and crews".</p>
<p>United Airlines also said it was working to rebook impacted passengers, while a Southwest Airlines spokesperson said its cancellations were all weather related.</p>
<p>Overall, US airports most heavily impacted were in Seattle, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth and JFK International in New York.</p>
<p>A White House official, who asked not to be named, said the administration was monitoring the delays closely but noted that while they can disrupt plans "only a small percentage of flights are affected".</p>
<p>Delta on Sunday cancelled 167 flights or 6 per cent; United cancelled 115 flights or 5 per cent and American cancelled 83 flights or 2 per cent, according to FlightAware.</p>
<p>Globally, 3,023 flights were called off and more than 13,742 were delayed, as of 8.15pm EST on Sunday (Monday, 9.15am, Singapore time), FlightAware data showed. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Royal Caribbean Cruises cruise ship returned to Fortt Lauderdale, CNN reported, and on Sunday a Carnival ship went back to Miami after positive cases of the novel coronavirus were detected onboard.</p>
<p>Carnival said "a small number on board were isolated due to a positive COVID test" on board its Carnival Freedom ship that returned to Miami and left later on Sunday for its next trip with another round of passengers.</p>
<p>Representatives for Royal Caribbean did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>
<p>Overall, COVID-19 outbreaks altered at least six sailings in the past week, the Washington Post reported, echoing the turmoil facing the industry after COVID-19 erupted in early 2020.</p>
<p>Testing woes have compounded the travel angst, as many Americans scrambled for their status amid long lines and lack of at-home test kits amid the holiday travels.</p>
<p>"We've obviously got to do better. I mean, I think things will improve greatly as we get into January, but that doesn't help us today and tomorrow," Fauci told ABC's This Week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some states are already bracing for the upcoming New Year's holiday weekend, warning residents to reduce potential exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>"Omicron is surging statewide," Louisiana's health department tweeted on Sunday, noting Omicron-related hospitalisations had doubled in the past week. "We are urging everyone to take safety precautions ahead of New Year’s Eve." </p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Australia to shorten booster intervals as Omicron pushes cases to records </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>SYDNEY: Australia would further shorten the wait time for people to receive their COVID-19 booster shots, Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Friday (Dec 24), as the country grapples with record infections fuelled by the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Booster shots will be offered from Jan 4 to everyone over 18 who had their second shot four months earlier and the interval will be again reduced to three months by the end of January.</p>
<p>"These dates have been set out of an abundance of caution to give Australians early continued protection," Hunt said during a media conference in Canberra.</p>
<p>Most states had been pressing the federal government to make more people eligible for boosters to stem the growing tide of Omicron cases. Authorities two weeks ago reduced the wait time to five months from six.</p>
<p>Australia has been looking to ramp up the rollout of boosters after becoming one of the world's most-vaccinated countries against COVID-19, with more than 90 per cent of people over the age of 16 having received two doses.</p>
<p>A growing number of countries are reducing the wait time for boosters from six months after the emergence of the Omicron variant. This month, South Korea, Britain and Thailand cut that interval to three months.</p>
<p>Despite record cases, authorities are hoping the hospitals will not come under extreme pressure from the new strain, which they say appears to be less severe than other variants.</p>
<p>The number of people admitted in hospitals is rising steadily, but remains far lower than during the Delta outbreaks. Just over 4 per cent of patients in hospitals have been infected with Omicron as of Dec 20, with only one in intensive care.</p>

<div> <p>Plus-size lingerie needn’t be an oxymoron if you know where to look. These retailers have included bigger women into the conversation of sexy lingerie.</p> </div>

<p>Shopping for lingerie is serious hard work, especially for plus-sized women who often lament a lack of options. </p>
<p>Take a look around and you will soon realise that there either isn’t a plus-sized extension or the options are, unsurprisingly, very limited or mostly frumpy-looking, making browsing the available choices downright depressing. </p>
<p>And this completely runs counter to why women enjoy wearing lingerie in the first place – to feel confident and look amazing. </p>

<h1> Pop superstar Alicia Keys unveils new album KEYS in Dubai </h1>
<div> <p>The 15-time Grammy Award-winning singer's sprawling double album includes two versions of each song: Originals, produced by Keys, and Unlocked, produced by Keys and Michael Williams II, who goes by Mike Will Made-It.</p> </div>
<p>Superstar Alicia Keys on Friday (Dec 10) debuted her new album live in front of a packed crowd at the world's fair in Dubai – a lively pop performance full of soaring vocals and piano solos. </p>
<p>"We can live on the air," she crooned from beneath the vast shimmering dome at Dubai's Expo, a fortified stage ringed by riveted – and COVID-19 vaccinated – fans bouncing, grooving and nodding to the beat. "Baby, baby, we gonna rock forever."</p>
<p>Keys, 40, sauntered onstage in a glittery gold bodysuit, her hair in a tight bun, and jammed out her eighth studio album along with old classics, radiating confidence. </p>
<p>"Tonight I want you to let everything go, let everything go, and come with me on this journey," she told revellers. "I never want this night to end."</p>
<p>The 15-time Grammy Award-winning singer's sprawling double album, KEYS, includes two versions of each song: Originals, produced by Keys, and Unlocked, produced by Keys and Michael Williams II, who goes by Mike Will Made-It. </p>
<p>Her piano-driven Originals consists of emotional, intimate soul tunes oozing with love and longing, while Unlocked showcases upbeat, more clubby pop versions of the same tracks.</p>
<p>She presented the album's premise to the crowd as an experiment on Friday night. </p>
<p>"Tell me which version you like better," she said before performing starkly different versions of the same track, one swooning and one synthesised, asking for the audience's preferences through their cheers. </p>
<p>Her Dubai set also featured hits like Girl on Fire, Empire State of Mind and New Day, booming anthems to which the audience danced and sang along wholeheartedly. </p>
<p>Much of the new material maintains her characteristic RB backbone and themes of soul-searching, desire and devotion. But the Unlocked tracks offer a surprisingly distinct and stylised twist. </p>
<p>Keys' previous album Alicia, released in the thick of the pandemic last year, focused on more topical and raw themes, with vulnerable confessions and references to virus-battered health workers and ordinary people's struggles to scrape by. </p>
<p>Keys has said she felt the new tracks ushered her into more confidence and clarity, describing the album once as feeling just completely "comfortable in my skin."</p>
<p>Before singing her closing crowd-pleasing classic, If I Ain't Got You, she left the captivated audience with a final uplifting message from the piano bench.</p>
<p>"Don't wait to tell the people ... you love that you love them," she said. "This is dedicated to you. I love you so much."</p>

<div> <div> <section> <div> <p> <a> World </a> </p> <h1> Australia rules out COVID-19 lockdowns despite Omicron surge </h1> </div> </section> </div> </div>
<p>COVID-19 cases have been breaking records over the last several days, the surge fuelled by the more transmissible Omicron variant, but Morrison insisted that limiting the spread of the virus comes down to personal responsibility.</p>
<p>"We have got to get past the heavy hand of government and we have got to treat Australians like adults," Morrison told reporters, urging authorities to shift from "a culture of mandates" when it comes to masks and social distancing rules.</p>
<p>"We're not going back to lockdowns. We're going forward to live with this virus with common sense and responsibility."</p>
<p>Authorities are now aiming to ramp up the rollout of booster shots with Morrison urging states to reopen hundreds of immunisation hubs shut down after demand slowed when double-dose rates in people above 16 years topped 80 per cent.</p>

<div> <p>"The chancellor and I are sure that, if we do this book, then we will do it alone, without ghostwriters, without historians, without journalists," her longtime office manager Beate Baumann said.</p> </div>
<p>Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to write an autobiographical book explaining her most important political decisions, a news outlet in Germany quoted a close aide as saying Friday (Dec 10).</p>
<p>Baumann said the book is envisioned as a two- to three-year project and doesn't yet have a publisher, according to Der Spiegel. </p>
<p>"The chancellor and I are sure that, if we do this book, then we will do it alone, without ghostwriters, without historians, without journalists," she said.</p>
<p>Merkel, a former scientist who grew up in East Germany, entered politics as communism crumbled and joined then-Chancellor Helmut Kohl's first post-reunification government in 1990. </p>
<p>She served as minister for families and women, then as environment minister, before becoming leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union in 2000, when it was in opposition. She was elected as Germany's first female chancellor in 2005. </p>
<p>Her tenure was dominated by a series of crises: The global financial crisis, Europe's debt crisis, mass migration to Europe in 2015-2016 and the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<a>carries a lower risk of hospitalisation</a>.
<p>Coronavirus infections have soared wherever the highly infectious Omicron variant has spread, triggering new restrictions in many countries and record new cases.</p>
<p>But in another glimmer of hope two days before Christmas, a US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) official said data indicated that both <a>Merck Co's</a> and <a>Pfizer's</a> COVID-19 anti-virals are effective against the variant.</p>
<p>There were encouraging signs too about hospitalisation rates from Britain and South Africa, although the head of a leading African health agency joined the World Health Organization in cautioning that it was too soon to draw broader conclusions.</p>
<p>"Let's be careful not to extrapolate what we are seeing in South Africa across the continent, or across the world," Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC) chief John Nkengasong said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, US stock indexes and yields on US Treasuries both climbed on Thursday, partly on new optimism after Omicron helped ratchet up market volatility for much of the last month of 2021.</p>
<p>"Today is a very calm day. It’s the relief over Omicron apparently not being as bad as we feared," Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial, said.</p>
<p>Even as Omicron has begun leaving an imprint on parts of the US economy, economists say it so far seems unlikely to prevent a second straight year of above-trend growth.</p>

<p>First identified last month in southern Africa and Hong Kong, Omicron is becoming dominant in much of Europe including Britain where daily new infections have soared beyond 100,000.</p>
<p>France had its worst-ever day in terms of new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, with more than 91,000 recorded, while Germany reported its first Omicron death.</p>
<p>In Italy, the first Western country to be hit by the pandemic last year, all public New Year's Eve celebrations were banned, while Greece banned public Christmas festivities. Both countries also made outdoor mask-wearing mandatory.</p>
<p>Increases in hospitalisations and deaths in South Africa and Britain since Omicron took hold appear to have been only gradual, and AstraZeneca and Novavax joined other manufacturers in saying their shots protect against it.</p>
<p>University of Edinburgh researchers who tracked 22,205 Omicron patients said on Wednesday the number who needed to be hospitalised was 68 per cent lower than they would have expected, based on the rate in patients with Delta.</p>
<p>Imperial College London researchers reported evidence of a comparable 40-45 per cent reduction in hospitalisation risk.</p>
<p>UKHSA boss Jenny Harries said this was "an encouraging early signal", but added: "this is early data and more research is required to confirm these findings".</p>
<p>In Washington, the FDA authorised Merck's anti-viral pill for certain high-risk adult patients, a day after giving the go-ahead to a similar treatment from Pfizer.</p>
<p>Both pills worked, said Patrizia Cavazzoni, a top FDA official, adding that both interfere with how the virus replicates, a process that is not altered across variants.</p>
<h2>'DON'T OVER-INTERPRET'</h2>
<p>Scientists have warned that, with the surge in cases in Britain, even a small proportion of hospitalisations could overwhelm the healthcare system.</p>
<p>In the US Midwest, Omicron's rapid spread has hospitals "preparing for the worst," with their personnel already severely strained from a wave of the Delta variant.</p>

<p>The British data supported findings from South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD).</p>
<p>A separate South African government-backed study, yet to be peer-reviewed, on health workers given the Johnson Johnson vaccine identified <a>"clear and early de-coupling" of hospitalisation</a> from Omicron cases compared with Delta.</p>
<p>AstraZeneca said a three-course dose of its vaccine offered protection against the variant, citing data from an Oxford University lab study.</p>
<p>Findings from the study, yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, matched those from rivals Pfizer-BioNTech, and Moderna.</p>
<p>Novavax also said early data showed its vaccine - authorised for use by the European Union and WHO but yet to be approved by the United States - generated an immune response against Omicron.</p>
<p>But the older Delta variant lurks.</p>
<p>The coronavirus death toll in Russia, where officials had detected only 41 Omicron cases, passed 600,000 on Thursday, Reuters calculations based on official data showed, after a surge of Delta-linked infections.</p>
<p>Only the United States and Brazil have recorded more coronavirus deaths.</p>
