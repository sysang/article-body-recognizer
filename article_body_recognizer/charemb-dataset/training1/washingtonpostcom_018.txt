<b> </b>the gray hairs on his chin are all that keep you from assuming Vick could still make a pair of defenders comically take out each other in an attempt to tackle him.
<div><div><p>“I was a kid from the ghetto,” Vick says. “I never wanted to leave.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“That melted me,” Vick says, and in that moment, it hit him: “This is what I’m living for here.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>Being like Mike</div></h3></div></div>

<b> </b>The franchise he thought he would lead to Super Bowls had moved on, selecting Matt Ryan in the 2008 draft. He lost his grandmother. He filed for bankruptcy. He was broken.
<div><div><p>“I didn’t know if I was ever going to play again,” Vick says. “I just needed to get out of there. I learned how important it is to have your freedom.”</p></div></div>
<b> </b>When Dungy came to visit him
<b> </b>Leavenworth, Kan., he recalls, Vick said, “People think I’m a bad person, and I’m not.”
<b> </b>packed up their two daughters, Jada and London, and moved back to her native Philadelphia. Two days later, Vick says, he signed with the Eagles for an opportunity to restore his career — and a chance to win back his family.
<div><div><p>“Saved our relationship,” says Vick, who married Kijafa in 2012. “I called her and said, ‘I need your help.’ ”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Vick owns dogs but doesn’t like to discuss them at length because, he says, “people can be so judgmental.” He did mention his Rottweiler, Lotus, whom he describes as “the sweetest dog ever.”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Eldridge Dickey became the first Black quarterback picked in the first round of the draft. What happened next derailed his life.</p></div>

<div><div><p>“We’re like: ‘Ah s---. We got to deal with this motherf-----,’ ” Woodson says as he and Vick laugh.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Eagles<b> </b>lost, but Vick carved up the eventual Super Bowl champions with dynamic runs and dart-like throws, nearly completing a comeback. His<b> </b>third act had begun.</p></div></div>
<div><p>Bill Belichick may be the NFL’s best modern coach, but Andy Reid is its most influential</p></div>
<div><div><p>“Michael is innately very, very smart,” Reid says. “He’s got a memory that’s, like, ridiculous. You could tell him something one time, and it’s in the vault.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><h3><div>‘I’ll get through this’</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Dungy believes Vick’s journey has already provided enough inspiration for his children<b> </b>and anyone else who ends up ridiculed or scorned.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Brown 'no longer a Buc' after midgame exit</p></div>
<p>“He is no longer a Buc,” Arians said after the Buccaneers’ dramatic 28-24 victory over the New York Jets, in which Brady orchestrated a last-minute touchdown drive without Brown. “That’s the end of the story.”</p>
<div><div><p>And a question for the NFL at large: Why will this incident probably bring the end of Brown’s playing career when so many more serious off-field misdeeds went lightly punished?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m not talking about him,” Arians said. “He’s no longer a part of the Bucs.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>For Arians, that sidestepping is convenient. The Buccaneers got what they asked for by relying on Brown. It’s easy to say Arians should have seen it coming. The truth is, Arians <i>did</i> see it coming.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I could give a [expletive] what they think,” Arians added when asked about critics of Brown’s return. “The only thing I care about is this football team and what’s best for us.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Brady became a champion for Brown, pushing for his signing in Tampa Bay. On Sunday, he had to win a game after Brown quit on him.</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Adam Kilgore</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>September 7, 2021 at 3:39 p.m. EDT</div></div>
<p>Former Washington running back Clinton Portis faces a federal prison sentence after he pleaded guilty last week to his role in defrauding a health-care program for retired NFL players, according to a Department of Justice statement released Tuesday.</p>
<div><div><p>The charge technically carries a penalty of up to 10 years, but prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence within what federal guidelines call for, which is likely to be far less than that — possibly less than a year.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Adam C. Reeves, the Lexington, Ky., lawyer listed in court documents as Portis’s attorney, did not immediately return an email seeking comment.</p></div></div>
<div><p>On Friday, Portis became the latest of 15 former players to plead guilty to participating in a scheme to defraud the Gene Upshaw NFL Player Health Reimbursement Account Plan, which was established in 2006 to benefit retired NFL players.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Following an FBI investigation, the Department of Justice charged 10 former NFLers, Portis and a handful of other Washington players among them, <a>in December 2019</a>. It later charged five additional players.</p></div></div>
<p>Joe Horn, Correll Buckhalter, Carlos Rogers, James Butler, Etric Pruitt, Ceandris Brown, John Eubanks, Antwan Odom, Darrell Reid, Anthony Montgomery, Fredrick Bennett and Reche Caldwell, who died in June 2020, pleaded guilty before a trial.</p>
<a>he told Sports Illustrated in 2017</a>.
<div><div><p>Portis will be sentenced Jan. 6.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div>By Mark Maske7:53 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<p>The Dallas Cowboys’ comeback bid fell short and they lost Sunday to the Arizona Cardinals, 25-22, in Arlington, Tex. The defeat clears the way for the Green Bay Packers to potentially clinch the NFC’s No. 1 playoff seed Sunday night.</p>
<div><div><p>The Packers can secure the top seed with a triumph over the Minnesota Vikings, who are playing without quarterback Kirk Cousins.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Cowboys trailed, 22-7, in the fourth quarter. They closed to within 25-22 on quarterback Dak Prescott’s touchdown pass to wide receiver Amari Cooper with 4:42 to play, followed by a successful two-point conversion.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But the Cardinals held the ball for 10 plays and ran out the clock. The Cowboys were out of timeouts and therefore could not challenge an apparent fumble by the Cardinals on the game-ending possession.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Cowboys had used a timeout earlier in the half amid defensive confusion when the Cardinals had both quarterback Kyler Murray and kicker Matt Prater on the field on a fourth-down play.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Murray threw two touchdown passes for the Cardinals and Prater provided four field goals. Prescott threw three touchdown passes for the Cowboys.</p></div></div>

<div><div><div>By Des Bieler7:47 p.m.</div></div><div>Link copied</div></div>
<p>The New Orleans Saints stifled the Carolina Panthers in an 18-10 home win on Sunday. The Saints sacked Panthers starter Sam Darnold seven times, intercepted him once, recovered a fumble he lost and held him to 132 passing yards on 26 attempts.</p>
<div><p>Carolina (5-11) got 68 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown from running back Chuba Hubbard. Quarterback Cam Newton, who split playing time with Darnold last week, was used sparingly Sunday and contributed one carry for five yards.</p></div>

<div><div><p>The Chargers didn’t just eliminate the Broncos from the playoffs with a 34-13 win Sunday against Denver. They also ended the postseason hopes of the Cleveland Browns and Miami Dolphins.</p></div></div>
<p>Earlier on Sunday, the Dolphins (8-8) lost to the Tennessee Titans, snapping a seven-game winning streak that followed their seven-game losing streak this season. The Browns (7-8) are set to play the Pittsburgh Steelers (7-7-1) on Monday night.</p>

<div><div><p>It was the sixth career return, either of a kickoff or a punt, in Roberts’s 12-year NFL career. Los Angeles entered the game with an 8-7 record, while Denver was at 7-8.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Gallup was ruled out for the rest of a game Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals after suffering a second-quarter knee injury. Gallup was hurt while making an acrobatic catch for a Dallas touchdown.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Gallup had to turn around to corral a pass that was thrown to his outside shoulder near the pylon. His twisting motion appeared to put a strain on his left knee.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>A fourth-year player who was a third-round pick in 2018, Gallup came into Sunday’s game with 32 catches for 409 yards and a score this season. He missed eight games earlier this season with a calf injury.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Cowboys went to halftime Sunday with a 13-7 deficit to the Cardinals.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Lance, who ran four times for 14 yards, is making his second start of the season, following a Week 5 debut in that role. Mills, who began this season as the backup to Tyrod Taylor, made his 10th start.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The 49ers didn’t get on the board Sunday until Robbie Gould made a 37-yard field goal as time expired in the second quarter. The Texans entered the game at 4-11, while the 49ers are 8-7.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The “Sunday Night Football” game between the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings offers the latest frigid evidence for why the Packers want the home-field advantage in the postseason.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The forecast for the 8:20 p.m. game on the frozen tundra calls for a temperature of 6 degrees, with a wind chill of minus-4, that figures to make the game among the coldest in Lambeau Field history.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“For the most part, the colder it is, the slower the rush and the offense can have an advantage,” Rodgers said, “especially on a field that could be slick based on the elements.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>The LSU connection of Joe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase was unstoppable, combining for 266 yards and three touchdowns as the Cincinnati Bengals stunned the Kansas City Chiefs, 34-31.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Bengals, who clinched the AFC North with the win, had rallied from 14-0 and 28-14 deficits and took a 31-28 lead before the Chiefs tied the score on a Harrison Butker field goal.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The problem is that Burrow had been hurt on the play and left the game. With two seconds left, Evan McPherson came in and kicked the game-winner.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>With the loss, the 11-5 Chiefs drop out of the top spot in the AFC playoff standings, replaced by the Titans, who beat the Dolphins.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Burrow completed 30 of 39 passes for 446 yards, a week after he passed for 525 against the Ravens, and four touchdowns. Chase was his favorite target, catching 11 passes for 266 yards and three of those touchdowns.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>“He is no longer a Buc, alright?” Arians said during his postgame news conference. “That’s the end of the story. Let’s talk about the guys that went out there and won the game.”</p></div></div>

<div><h1>Giants Coach Joe Judge unloads epic rant after latest loss</h1></div>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Des Bieler</div></div>Reporter </span></div></span></div><div>Today at 6:30 a.m. EST|Updated today at 5:44 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>After the New York Giants suffered a desultory 29-3 road loss to the Chicago Bears on Sunday, Joe Judge <a>addressed the media</a> and took questions on his team’s game plan and how he felt about various miscues.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then the Giants’ coach was asked why fans of the 4-12 team should have “faith that you’re going to get this turned around.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>What followed was a remarkable response — more than 11 minutes long and, by some counts, containing more than 2,600 words — in which Judge extolled the “culture” he was instilling.</p></div></div>
<p>Along the way, Judge used profanity several times and made a number of eyebrow-raising assertions. Among them: “This ain’t a team that’s having fistfights on the sidelines. This ain’t some clown-show organization.”</p>
<a>taking a swing</a> at fellow defensive lineman Daron Payne. New York’s sideline has been a more peaceful place of late, but on the field Week 17 produced some moments that at least a few Giants fans and others might have found somewhat clownish.
<div><div><p>Nevertheless, Judge insisted afterward that “everyone is locked in.”</p></div></div>
<a>fired in December 2019</a> after going 5-11 and 4-12 in two seasons. According to beat writers for the team, then-Giants wide receiver
<a>Golden Tate</a> kept a set of golf clubs at his locker at some point in the 2019 season.
<div><div><p>In addition to his characterization of comments from New York players when he arrived in early 2020, Judge’s claims of what he has heard from recent and future ex-Giants made ripples Sunday.</p></div></div>
<a>noted</a>, there are relatively few members of the 2020 Giants who left the team for what could reasonably be described as appreciably
<a>more money</a>. The notion that multiple such players could be expressing regrets to Judge — which, if it were really happening, might
<a>constitute tampering</a> — seemed far-fetched to some.
<div><div><p>Another head-scratching comment arrived elsewhere in the rant, when Judge cited his experience with the 2018 New England Patriots, for whom he served as the special teams coordinator.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Halfway through the season,” he said, “we were all pretty convinced we were getting fired. We didn’t think we were going to make the playoffs.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>Oklahoma quarterback Caleb Williams announced Monday that he is entering the transfer portal. The No. 1 quarterback recruit in the 2021 class, Williams said he is open to remaining with the Sooners but wants to see what his options are.</p></div>
<a>announcement</a>, Williams noted “the sudden changes this season [that] sent shock waves though Sooner Nation and were really hard for the whole team.” Former coach Lincoln Riley
<a>follow Riley to USC</a>. Spencer Rattler, who starred at quarterback for Oklahoma in 2020 before losing his starting job to Williams this season, left the program last month and
<a>transferred to South Carolina</a>.
<div><div><p>Oklahoma’s football program responded by sharing a statement that effectively served as a pitch to Williams on why he should stay.</p></div></div>
<a>praised</a> Venables as “the right guy” for the program but said it remained to be seen “how I decide.”
<a>submitted a stellar performance</a> a week later, when he made his first start against TCU.
<div><div><p>“I’m going to take a few days off to decompress and relax with my family,” Williams said in his statement, “but thank you again everyone for all the love and support!”</p></div></div>

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Des Bieler</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>Today at 11:15 p.m. EST|Updated today at 12:04 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>The Raiders said Monday their organization was aware of the incident and “has been in communication with local law enforcement and is in the process of gathering more information.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department did not immediately respond to a request to provide the incident report.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>At a previously scheduled news conference later in the day, interim coach Rich Bisaccia <a>told</a> reporters the Raiders were “certainly disappointed in the news.”</p></div></div>
<p>“I don’t have all the facts yet,” Bisaccia said. “I’ll be able to comment, I would think, as the end of the week comes, when I get more information about what’s going to actually happen with that.”</p>
<a>charged with four felonies</a> related to those deaths while driving under the influence. The Raiders quickly released Ruggs, a 2020 first-round pick who could
<a>face 50 years or more in prison</a>.
<div><div><p>Shortly after that, the team released<a> cornerback Damon Arnette</a>, also a 2020 first-round pick, who was shown making death threats while brandishing a firearm in a video shared on social media.</p></div></div>
<a>named interim coach</a> in October after Jon Gruden stepped down. Gruden, who was in the fourth year of a 10-year, $100 million contract,
<a>resigned</a> after the emergence of racist, homophobic and misogynistic language that he used in emails while working as a TV analyst before joining the Raiders in 2018. In November, Gruden
<a>filed a lawsuit</a> that accused the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell of leaking the emails to “publicly sabotage” the ex-coach’s career and pressure him into leaving the team.
<a>Josh Jacobs was booked</a> by Las Vegas police after he allegedly crashed into a tunnel wall at McCarran International Airport. Later that month, the Clark County District Attorney’s office said it was
<a>dropping the charge</a> because Jacobs’s blood alcohol level tested below the legal limit and instead would charge him with a misdemeanor count related to his “failure to exercise due care.”
<a>said</a> in a statement that “the facts and circumstances related by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department to the news media leave serious concerns that this does not qualify as a DUI under Nevada law.”
<a>said</a>. “We’re very cognizant of the city in which we live in, so I’ll leave it at that and we’ll see what it looks like by the end of the week.”
