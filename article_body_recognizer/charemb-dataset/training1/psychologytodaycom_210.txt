<a>memory</a>—resides on both sides of the brain.
<div> <h3> What are some key functions of the left brain? </h3> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In language processing, <a>it is usually the left brain</a> that properly orders words during speech, while in visual perception, it registers the locations of objects in space relative to other objects. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3> When are some key functions of the right brain? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How is being right-handed or left-handed related to the brain? </h3> </div>
<a>In left-handed people, the motor cortex in the right hemisphere is dominant</a> for fine motor behaviors, such as writing with a pencil. The reverse is true for right-handed people—the left hemisphere is stronger when it comes to such movements.

<h2> “Left-Brained” and “Right-Brained” People </h2>
<a>the left brain/right brain dichotomy is appealing</a>, promising to teach individuals about how they think and why. But the reality of hemispheric specialization is much more complex than this popular concept suggests.
<div> <h3> Are there “left-brained” people and “right-brained” people? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How have “left-brained” people and “right-brained” people been described? </h3> </div>
<a>the "left-brained" and "right-brained" types are not scientifically supported</a>.)
<div> <h3> Where did the myth come from? </h3> </div>
<a>The concept of “left-brained” and “right-brained” individuals</a> appears to stem from research in the 1960s on “split-brain” patients, whose corpus callosum (the bridge between hemispheres) had been separated.
<a>The research revealed</a> that patients responded in different ways to stimuli such as images, depending on which brain hemisphere perceived them.

<a>sex</a> for a year or longer. Because barriers fertility can exist in both men and women, it is often said that the couple, rather than the woman, is experiencing infertility.
<h2> What Is Infertility? </h2>
<div> <h3> When should you start to worry about infertility? </h3> </div>
<a>pregnant</a> may wish to consult a doctor if they are over the age of 40, have irregular or painful periods, have a history of
<a>miscarriages</a>, have been diagnosed with pelvic inflammatory disease or endometriosis, or have been treated for cancer.
<div> <h3> Is infertility just a woman’s problem? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> How do you check for infertility? </h3> </div>
<a>hormonal</a> and genetic testing, testicular biopsy, and additional imaging.

<h2> Infertility Causes and Treatments </h2>
<a>embarrassment</a>, and social stigma. Talking to a trusted family member, friend, or therapist can often help men and women process the mix of complex emotions.
<div> <h3> What causes infertility in women? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What causes infertility in men? </h3> </div>
<a>Other risk factors</a> include overexposure to certain environmental factors, such as
<div> <h3> How can I boost my fertility? </h3> </div>
<a>medication</a> or undergo surgery to increase the chances of conception.
<div> <h3> What is assisted reproductive technology? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> What home remedies can I use to get pregnant? </h3> </div>
<a>Alternative therapies are often used</a> in conjunction with conventional treatments. Certain lifestyle changes can help improve the odds of conception: adequate sleep, maintaining a healthy weight, eat well,
<a>quit smoking</a>, cut back on alcohol and caffeine, and get regular, moderate exercise. Many people tout the benefits of yoga,
<a>mindfulness</a>. Specific vitamins can boost the reproductive system, including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, and E, folic acid, zinc, and essential fatty acids. Be sure to run any supplements by your doctor before starting a new regimen.
<h2> Infertility and Mental Health </h2>
<a>grief</a> or profound loss. Common reactions include shock, frustration, grief,
<a>depression</a>, but feelings about infertility can vary greatly depending on the source of the problems. Men, in particular, find it far easier to deal with a partner’s infertility than with their own.
<div> <h3> How do fertility treatments affect people emotionally? </h3> </div>
<a>guilt</a>. Just the sight of a pregnant woman can evoke strong negative and
<a>stressful</a> feelings. During this time, those struggling with infertility may pull away from friends and family who remind them of their difficulty with reproduction; some of their closest relationships may suffer.
<div> <h3> How do fertility treatments affect sex and intimacy? </h3> </div>
<a>stay sexually connected during infertility treatment</a>.
<div> <h3> How do you deal with infertility when your peers are pregnant? </h3> </div>
<a>jealousy</a> and other negative emotions when other couples seem to have no trouble conceiving.
<div> <h3> Does stress cause infertility? </h3> </div>
<a>PTSD</a>. If you notice that you (or someone you care about) are suddenly experiencing difficulty making decisions, severe disorganization, or dependency issues,
<a>it’s time to take stock of your mental health</a>.

<p>Unlike a manic episode, however, a hypomanic episode does not necessarily significantly disrupt a person’s work or social life and does not involve psychotic delusions or hallucinations.</p>
<p>Hypomania is a feature of some mood disorders, namely bipolar disorder and cyclothymic disorder, and those who experience symptoms of hypomania often also go through separate periods of depression.</p>
<div> <h3> What are the signs of hypomania? </h3> </div>
<p>Signs of hypomania include:</p>
<p>• Sudden confidence and assertiveness</p>
<p>• Increased energy</p>
<p>• More time spent on activities and/or unrealistic activities</p>
<p>• Reduced need for sleep</p>
<p>• Distractibility and irritability</p>
<div> <h3> What triggers hypomania? </h3> </div>
<a>antidepressants</a>, steroids), and certain medical conditions (thyroid disease, seizures, multiple sclerosis).
<div> <h3> How are bipolar disorders diagnosed? </h3> </div>
<p>There are three main <a>forms of Bipolar Disorder</a>:</p>
<p>• Bipolar II: Sometimes called "soft bipolar," bipolar II involves hypomania. To be diagnosed with this disorder, a person has to have had an episode of hypomania and an episode of depression.</p>
<p>• Cyclothymia: People with cyclothymia experience symptoms of hypomania and symptoms of mild depression. Episodes of cyclothymia tend to be shorter but are present for at least two years.</p>
<div> <h3> How does hypomania differ from positive or intense emotions? </h3> </div>

<h2> Positive and Negative Aspects of Hypomania </h2>
<p>Hypomania can, however, involve negative aspects (including irritability) and may increase the possibility of harm resulting from risk-taking behavior. It can also coincide with depressive symptoms.</p>
<div> <h3> Can someone with hypomania be fully functional? </h3> </div>
<a>Freud</a> believed, for instance, that people are fully functional when they retain the ability to do three things: work, play, and love.
<a>Hypomania becomes a problem,</a> however, if risky behaviors emerge or if the episode progresses into mania or depression.
<div> <h3> How can people with bipolar disorder control hypomania? </h3> </div>
<a>control hypomania</a>, preventing it from becoming a manic episode. Those who
<div> <h3> How do people with bipolar disorder know if hypomania is out of control? </h3> </div>
<a>hypomania has gotten out of control</a> is whether those around the person feel comfortable and safe.
<div> <h3> How is hypomania treated? </h3> </div>
<a>Therapy</a> is often used in conjunction, which can
<a>help patients understand the condition,</a> develop coping skills, adhere to their medications, and make helpful lifestyle changes.

<p>• Persistent difficulty discarding or <a>parting with possessions</a>, regardless of actual value.</p>

<a>traumatic events</a>, such as loss of a spouse or loss from a natural disaster. People traumatized by such events may show signs of hoarding symptoms at the time of the event or shortly thereafter.
<div> <h3> Are hoarding and attention deficit related? </h3> </div>
<div> <h3> Are hoarders also compulsive shoppers? </h3> </div>
<a>emotional attachments to inanimate objects</a> and extreme anxiety when making decisions, even simple ones. A person who hoards finds it gut-wrenching to make the decision of tossing a piece of garbage like a plastic bag, for example.

<div> <h3> Why are people who hoard often single? </h3> </div>

<a>Therapy</a> can help. Randy Frost, a professor of psychology at Smith College and the
<a>father of hoarding psychology</a>, along with colleagues, came up with a
<a>cognitive-behavioral</a> approach for hoarders. He includes in this therapy: Ask the person who hoards to try throwing away an item as an experiment. Not as a broad policy, but as a small trial. Then the therapist monitors how the sufferer progresses.
