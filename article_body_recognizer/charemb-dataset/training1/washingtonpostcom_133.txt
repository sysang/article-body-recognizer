<a>Northwestern University</a> and Stanford University, had already announced that they would temporarily switch to virtual instruction in early January. At
<a>Harvard University</a>, where spring classes begin later in the month, school officials said most learning and work in the first three weeks of January will be done remotely.
<div><div><p>UC-Davis will open virtually for a few days starting Jan. 3 to allow people time to get a negative test before coming to class or work in person on Jan. 10. The campus remains a safe place, university leaders said Tuesday.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Meanwhile, faculty and students at some other schools are asking whether more caution is needed at their colleges when classes resume after the holidays.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The University of North Carolina’s faculty executive committee called a special meeting for Thursday “to discuss spring semester plans in light of pandemic developments.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Online petitions have popped up asking schools to do more testing, to make decisions about remote learning more quickly, or to provide students a virtual option in January.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Some students dreading a return to remote learning and the isolation of 2020 have pushed back with alternative petitions.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>At George Washington University143 residential students were in isolation at its peak in December. Seventy-five of them stayed on campus and the others left to isolate at home during the break.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>School officials are working to expand the amount of quarantine and isolation housing they have available for the spring semester, Goldman said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>For some international students during the pandemic spike, travel home is "almost impossible."</p></div>
<div><div><p>For those students confined to dorm rooms rather than traveling and celebrating the break with family and friends, the abrupt change in the pandemic could not have felt more stark.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The room had yellow walls, a single window, a bed, a set of drawers, and an empty wardrobe without any hangers.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Unlike his dorm room, with an open window onto the busy street, fraternity row and all the usual bustle and cacophony of college and New York City life, this was unnaturally quiet.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Every night, for hours, there was a soft cooing noise he couldn’t quite place; owls, maybe?</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Sometimes, through the walls, he could hear other people coughing and hacking. He himself felt perfectly healthy, making it seem all the more discordant, as though he were trapped in a plague house.</p></div></div>

<a>all students, staff and visitors inside school buildings</a> wear masks at all times. Some states have rules that echo the CDC, requiring masks in schools statewide and prompting local protests across the country.
<a>Republican state officials</a> — who argue that parents should have the right to decide about masks for their children — against school districts — who cite the rising virus caseloads, contagious
<a>delta variant</a> and proven efficacy of masks in requiring them.
<div><p>Debates over mask mandates stir anger and confusion</p></div>
<div><div><p>This battle is playing out in courtrooms and in muscle-flexing in state capitols, in school boards and in the White House, where President Biden says he is investigating what power he may have to support mask requirements.</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>Superintendent Monica Henson and her team decided to close the school — a difficult decision in a part of the country where spotty broadband Internet access makes remote learning iffy.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I would never have dreamed in July that we would be where we are right now,” Henson said. “I feel like a lot of my role has been comforter in chief.”</p></div></div>

<div><p>In a San Francisco high school, the scars of remote schooling linger</p></div>
<p>“The default position is we want kids in school,” said John Heim, executive director of the National School Boards Association. “That’s the point that most school districts and school boards are working from.”</p>
<a>recently announced</a> that students exposed to the virus can safely continue in-person learning so long as they are regularly tested for the virus, and it released two studies showing the effectiveness of “test to stay.”
<p>“Your children are safer in school,” New York Mayor-elect Eric Adams (D) said Tuesday at a virtual news briefing announcing the plan to ramp up testing as a way of keeping cases controlled. “The numbers speak for themselves.”</p>
<div><div><p>“I think that schools will need to be thoughtful about how to use this limited resource,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“We are moving closer to a safe reopening of schools,” he <a>said in a written statement</a> after the city announced its plan. “But we are not there yet.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><p>But Paterson students have<b> </b>the advantage of technology: Those without Internet at home are given a hotspot, and when a Chromebook stops functioning, the district provides a new one.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Many of the drivers are older, making them potentially more vulnerable to the new variant. The district has researched the possibility of contracting with a bus service, but Henson said contractors are not interested.</p></div></div>

<div><p>The difficult comeback amid the surge of the omicron variant went beyond transportation, with educators reporting a striking number of absences of students and staff at numerous schools in the sprawling suburban system of 209 schools.</p></div>

<div><div><p>“It’s really hurting our kiddos, the unknown and even the arguing about what’s best,” she said.</p></div></div>
<div><p>School officials did not have information on reports of a high number of teacher absences — and a lack of substitutes — at a string of schools, including Paint Branch, Gaithersburg, Springbrook and Northwest high schools.</p></div>
<div><div><p>Parents in the county remained divided on whether schools should be open or paused until the surge ends, and whether testing should have been done before students and staff returned.</p></div></div>

<h2>Surges put 89 more schools at risk of closing, after more than 5,600 positive tests over winter break</h2>
<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Donna St. George</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>January 4, 2022 at 10:36 a.m. EST</div></div>
<div><p>D.C.-area parents and teachers split over return-to-school plans</p></div>
<div><div><p>As of 6 a.m. Monday, 5,680 students and staff members had reported having tested positive over the winter break, including 4,677 during the break’s last five days.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“This absolutely reflects a trend that we are seeing across the Washington, D.C., region,” McKnight said.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>negative test result before they set foot in classrooms, expected Thursday.
<a>staffing shortages that were already a problem</a>, she said.
<div><p>Can ‘test-to-stay’ keep kids in schools safely? A Maryland system is finding out.</p></div>
<div><div><p>The 11 district schools that are switching to virtual are designated as red schools, while 89 more are yellow.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But Tuesday’s decision drew criticism from a mix of parents and educators who pointed out that the decision to close each school was based on self-reported data that they believe is unreliable.</p></div></div>
<a>a “test-to-stay” protocol</a> in Montgomery — said the school system had broken its promise to make a decision based on in-school spread and to use the 5 percent cutoff as one indicator, not an automatic pivot point.
<div><div><p>All schools over 5 percent were switched to virtual learning, according to school district data, although officials said each decision had been considered carefully, with advice from the county health department.</p></div></div>
<p>Some parents said they were worried about what comes next, with 89 schools in the yellow zone. “Unless they make a commitment and policy decision, half of the kids in the school system will be out of school by Monday,” Reesman predicted.</p>
<div><div><p>Without testing, Martin said, “How do we know we have captured the full extent of the problem?”</p></div></div>
<div><p>Covid-19 cases, vaccination rates and hospitalizations in the D.C. area</p></div>
<div><div><p>Others were frustrated that the school system’s plans were not more proactive, nearly two years after the pandemic began.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“Omicron was not some kind of sneak attack,” said Lyric Winik, PTSA president at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School. “Where were the advance plans for handling another covid influx?”</p></div></div>
<a>Coronavirus infections have climbed </a>across the D.C. region, surpassing 2 million. The seven-day average of new daily cases is up 114 percent in Virginia, 3 percent in the District and 89 percent in Maryland as of Tuesday, according to
<a>a Washington Post tracker</a>.
<div><div><p>The test positivity rate in Montgomery County is 27 percent, according to <a>state data</a> — more than 25 times what it was in the summer and more than eight times what it was in early December.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I think it’s the wisest decision they could have made,” said Hannah Donart, a mother of two children at Monocacy Elementary, one of the schools that was switched to virtual instruction.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It was a relief actually,” she said of the move to virtual instruction. “I’m afraid of passing it on.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Students from the 11 schools will start with full-day live instruction Thursday, school officials said, following a day of teacher planning and asynchronous instruction.</p></div></div>

<p>RICHMOND — The Supreme Court of Virginia on Tuesday unanimously approved new congressional and General Assembly maps, ending a contentious redistricting process that for the first time gave no say to the state’s elected officials.</p>
<div><p>Proposed Virginia redistricting maps leave Spanberger miles away from her congressional seat</p></div>
<div><p>“[H]earing from residents from all walks of life and from all corners of the Commonwealth gave us a much deeper understanding of the issues involved and brought to our attention things that we had honestly missed,” they wrote.</p></div>
<div><div><p>While it’s possible that some of those pairings have changed by other tweaks made to the maps, the special masters said they did not consider “incumbency protection” in the new version.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“In consultation with the Court, we have rejected calls to actively educate ourselves further on the residences of incumbents,” they wrote.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The maps drew praise from Liz White, executive director of the anti-gerrymandering group OneVirginia2021.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Spokespeople for members of Congress and the state legislative caucuses either did not respond to requests for comment or declined, saying they had not yet analyzed the maps.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One exception was H. Morgan Griffith (R), <a>who took to Twitter</a> to declare he would seek reelection to the 9th District in the state’s rural Southwest.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>It was not immediately clear how much the final maps approved Tuesday vary from the proposal rolled out earlier this month. White said that at first glance, the bigger changes appeared to be to the congressional map.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>In the final map, the 7th shifts southward but still does not include Henrico County, where Spanberger lives, White said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The new 1st District picks up a big portion of Henrico and Chesterfield counties, two communities that had been separated in the first version and had sought to be united.</p></div></div>

<div><p>Pelosi names Republican Cheney to select committee investigating Jan. 6 attack on Capitol by pro-Trump mob</p></div>
<p>Pelosi selected eight members of the panel on Thursday — including Cheney — while House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is allowed to appoint five more. He has dodged questions about whom he will appoint, if anyone.<b/></p>
<div><div><p>Raskin and Luria bring distinct perspectives to the group, with Luria drawing on two decades in the military and Raskin pulling from investigations into extremism that he has led for years.</p></div></div>
<b/>She said she believes that approach will be valuable as the committee tries to do its work in a time of hyperpartisanship.
<div><div><p>But “being attacked from within is even harder to grapple with,” she added.</p></div></div>
<div><p>U.S. alleges wider Oath Keepers conspiracy, adds more defendants in Jan. 6 Capitol riot</p></div>

<div><div><p>During a meeting with other<b/> committee members Thursday, Raskin said, most appeared receptive to having Capitol and D.C. police officers testify about the violence they encountered that day.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Luria said that one of the probe’s primary objectives will be to identify intelligence and security failures leading up to the attack, in hopes of preventing another such besiegement of the Capitol.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>During their meeting, she said, Raskin made a comment that stuck with her: “He said the single biggest indicator of a successful coup is that it was preceded by an unsuccessful coup.”</p></div></div>

<div><div><h3><div>The Falwell vision</div></h3></div></div>
<div><div><p>Good grew up watching the charismatic Thomas Road Baptist pastor Jerry Falwell Sr. build an evangelical empire in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains from nothing in the 1970s.</p></div></div>

<div><p>“I think Bob himself will tell you he wasn’t the most athletically gifted person, but what he lacked in giftedness he made up for in work ethic,” said Castro, who coached Good as a graduate assistant in the ’80s.</p></div>
<div><div><p>“He always had the vision and desire to go after goals that were bigger than what was put in front of him,” Keys said, noting that he would see that same trait emerge as Good aimed for Congress years later.</p></div></div>

<b> </b>When 13 House Republicans voted for the “phony” infrastructure bill,
<a>he said he hoped</a> they would be primaried out of office.
<p>At the heart of Good’s opposition is his claim that Democrats’ trillions in spending — both on the infrastructure bill and the social-spending package — will “transform us into a Marxist, socialist country.”</p>
<b> </b>At a news conference this summer, he went further, charging that

<div><div><span><div><span><div><div>By Meagan Flynn</div></div></span></div></span></div><div>December 11, 2021 at 6:53 p.m. EST</div></div>
<div><div><p>Five years after the death of his nephew, David Trone went to Mexico looking for the source of what killed him: the opioid epidemic.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>law enforcement officials , the congressman found no signs that the epidemic was slowing.
<div><p>100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 12 months during the pandemic</p></div>
<a>successfully fought criminal charges </a>
<b> </b>related to liquor regulations, ultimately becoming a major donor to the American Civil Liberties Union.
<div><div><p>She specifically wanted to work for Trone, she said, because working on addiction and recovery issues is personal, having lost friends to addiction and an aunt to alcoholism.</p></div></div>
<a> has said</a> she lost her brother to opioid addiction, while Carleah Summers battled addiction herself and now runs recovery houses in the region.
<div><p>New opioids, more powerful than fentanyl, are discovered in D.C. amid deadly wave of overdoses</p></div>
<a>was in Western Maryland. </a>Overdose deaths have slowed in that part of the state in the first half of this year,
<a>state data shows</a> — but the crisis had been raging long before the pandemic accelerated it.
<div><p>America’s first opioid crisis grew out of the carnage of the Civil War</p></div>
<div><div><p>Then, years later, he was doing the same with his nephew.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Similar stories poured out of Trone’s district as the opioid epidemic worsened in Western Maryland, and in communities across America.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>The problem, she said, is that Ashley kept getting arrested and jailed for possession — but upon her release, the treatment options were slim at the time, and she would inevitably fall right back on heroin.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Then, his daughter, Brooke, was the one who needed treatment.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>at 19 of an overdose in her car, found parked outside their church, in 2015.
<div><div><p>“When my daughter passed,” Simmers said, “I was just consumed with guilt, about the way we dealt with it, the way the country dealt with it.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Simmers first met Trone after deciding to open a recovery home and treatment center named in his daughter’s memory: <a>Brooke’s House</a>.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“I’m like, who the hell is this guy?” Simmers said. “I didn’t know he was a rich guy. I didn’t know he had a nephew that died. I didn’t know anything about the guy.”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>But soon he would. Trone, who is known for doling out hefty donations to causes <a>and politicians he supports</a>, donated $100,000 to help Simmers get started. “I started crying right on the spot,” Simmers said.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>Fitzpatrick said he envisioned spending an entire week passing a slate of bills that the task force has put forth, while Trone broached the possibility of a large package.</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>“It’s personal to the president,” Trone said, noting Hunter Biden’s struggles with addiction. “It’s personal to so many different members. Now the question is, how do we get it moving?”</p></div></div>
<div><div><p>One of his tactics: relentlessly reminding everyone he meets with about it.</p></div></div>
<b> </b>after his meeting with the synthetic opioids commission, Trone settled in for a virtual meeting scheduled later that afternoon. It wasn’t
<b> </b>specifically pegged to addiction and mental health. But it didn’t matter.
