<p><b>TGIF, Illinois, </b>and thank you for being part of this wild and crazy family we call Illinois Playbook. I’m honored to count some of you as friends (and subscribers) and wish you all a happy and healthy 2022, Covid-19 be damned.</p>
<p><b>PROGRAMMING NOTE —</b> Illinois Playbook will be on a two-week hiatus starting Monday. I’ll be back in your inbox on Jan. 3. Please stay in touch as I’ll still be reporting, just sleeping in a bit.</p>
<b>SCOOP: </b>The head of a dark money group that helped defeat last year's graduated income tax measure is behind a campaign to elect a Republican candidate to run against Gov.
<b>JB Pritzker</b> in 2022. And the money behind the effort will come from billionaire
<b>Mike Zolnierowicz, </b>who was former Gov.
<b> Bruce Rauner’s </b>first chief of staff, is working the levers of this operation, according to two Playbook sources. The former governor, however, is not involved. Zolnierowicz, or Mike Z, did not return a request for comment.
<b>Interviews with potential candidates have been held in secrecy</b> with Zolnierowicz. Word got out, however, that there’s interest in Aurora Mayor
<b>Richard Irvin</b> to run for governor and state Rep.
<b>Avery Bourne</b> to join the ticket as lieutenant governor. Neither returned requests for comment.
<p><b>It's part of a plan for Griffin</b> <a><u>to bankroll a slate of GOP candidates,</u></a> reports Lee Enterprises’ Brenden Moore.</p>
<p><b>A source close to Griffin said the Citadel CEO</b> has not met with any candidates and has not yet decided who he is going to support.</p>
<i>is </i>clear about his concerns for Illinois.
<p><b>A source who spoke to Playbook about Mike Z,</b> also said Griffin has committed $150 million to the campaign, which would match what Pritzker spent in his first run for governor.</p>
<p><b>Other media reports have attributed “multiple sources”</b> as saying Griffin is willing to spend as much as $300 million in next year’s election.</p>
<p><b>Those numbers are all speculation,</b> according to a source close to Griffin. “The field for next year's election hasn't fully formed yet and Ken hasn't made a decision. …There is also no spending number as there is no candidate."</p>
<p><b>Still pining for Griffin's support </b>are the current field of candidates:<b> </b>state Sen. <b>Darren Bailey</b> of Xenia, former state Sen. <b>Paul Schimpf</b> of Waterloo, and businessmen <b>Gary Rabine</b> and <b>Jesse Sullivan.</b></p>
<a><u>reports Tribune’s Rick Pearson</u></a>.
<a><u>reports Crain’s Greg Hinz</u></a>.
<p><b>Covid, climate change, and corruption aside,</b> 2021 was a hopeful year in Illinois. Cheers to the playbookers who made it all happen and a few "gifts"/jokes to make you smile:</p>
<p><b>For Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot: </b>Not that we condone name-calling, but a purple leather suit she can don when she’s in the mood to write some spicy emails. She could sign them: "Lori Lightfoot Raw."</p>
<p><b>For House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch: </b>A copy of Michael Madigan’s little black book (on how to raise money for the caucus) — just for emergencies.</p>
<p><b>For Senate President Don Harmon: </b>This <u>T-shirt that reads</u> “I might look like I'm listening to you but in my head I’m playing guitar.”</p>
<p><b>For Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle: </b>A Greek language book (I have a few) to help keep her ahead on the next few variants as Covid persists and she's still passing out masks and promoting vaccines.</p>
<b>For state Democratic Party Chair and Congresswoman Robin Kelly: </b>Stationery for all the thank you notes she’ll be writing to those doing the fundraising for the state party — and for the FEC for freeing her from all those chicken dinner events.
<p><b>For House Minority Leader Jim Durkin: </b>A Michael Madigan-o-meter, so he can more easily rate how much the new speaker reminds him of his predecessor. </p>
<p><b>For Senate Minority Leader Dan McConchie: </b>Group meditation sessions to help prepare his caucus for weathering their positions on Donald Trump in an election year.</p>
<p><b>For Sen. Dick Durbin:</b> A personal Illinois Playbook hotline to make sure he calls us before he blows up someone’s political career on local television. (OK, that’s really a present for us.)</p>
<p><b>For Sen. Tammy Duckworth: </b>A nautical hat because it looks like it’s smooth sailing for her in 2022.</p>
<p><b>For Rep. Adam Kinzinger:</b> A new suit for possible cable TV gigs, and a subscription to LinkedIn Premium.</p>
<p><b>For Rep. Marie Newman: </b>If she gets reelected, a do-over on the congressional office lottery where <a><u>she gets to pick her neighbors</u></a>.</p>
<p><b>For the Chicago Black and Latino caucuses:</b> A few white wards they can use to divvy up the city, wrap up the remap and call it a day.</p>
<p><b>For Ald. Marty “The General” Quinn: </b>Artillery to <a>fight against his <u>opponents</u></a>.</p>
<p><b>For Ken Griffin: </b>Another billionaire who will spend big on Illinois politics. That way, if the GOP challenger to Pritzker doesn’t win, the blame gets spread around. </p>
<p><b>For Frank Calabrese: </b>An all-access pass to his own “map room” so he can endlessly play with census data and district lines. </p>
<p><b>For Michael Madigan: </b>A mug that reads “Political Job Creator” now that the roles he had for decades — 22nd District state rep, House speaker, and state party chair — are all held by different people.</p>
<p><b>State Reps. Marcus Evans and Ann Williams:</b> A guide for installing solar panels, to help them keep selling their success in championing the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act.</p>
<p><b>For the Obama Foundation:</b> A donor who funds a meeting space for Protect Our Parks on the presidential center grounds as a peace offering to those who oppose the center’s location. That seems very Obama, right?</p>
<p><b>Sports team owners Jerry Reinsdorf, Rocky Wirtz and Tom Ricketts:</b> A copy of “It’s a Wonderful Life” featuring <b>Neil Bluhm</b> playing the role of Mr. Potter.</p>

<p><i>This is the final installment of POLITICO California Playbook PM for the campaign and legislative season.</i></p>
<p>TIME TO EXHALE: It's been an extraordinarily long news cycle in California, dating back to the first report of Covid-19 community spread in late February 2020.</p>
<p><b>We could all use a breather.</b> </p>
<p><b>If there's any sense of normalcy right now</b>, it's in the rhythms of the government calendar. As POLITICO's Jeremy B. White laid out this morning, Newsom has about 700 bills to sift through by Oct. 10.</p>
<a>reporting a worker shortage</a>.
<a>California Playbook</a> and on
<b>HAPPY FRIDAY! </b>This is our final installment this season of California PM Playbook, a pop-up POLITICO newsletter that has served as an afternoon temperature check of California politics. Got tips or suggestions? Shoot an email to
<p><i>Compiled by Colby Bermel</i></p>
<a>highlighted</a> his first post-recall TV interview, which
<a>touted</a> his 47.2 percent support ("votes still being counted") on the second question compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger's 48.58 percent result. Elder also
<a>tweeted</a> "No regrets. No retreat," while also adding "#WeveGotACountryToSave" alongside his usual "WeveGotAStateToSave."
<b>Democrat Kevin Paffrath</b> put a
<a>said</a> it "should be easier to get Dem party support OUTSIDE a recall election."
<p><b>2022 MATCHUPS: </b>The Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies released poll findings today showing Newsom would handily defeat any of four top Republicans in a head-to-head race next year.</p>
<p><b>The data is from the same pre-Election Day survey</b> that showed Newsom defeating the recall by nearly 22 points.</p>
<p><b>In a two-candidate matchup,</b> Newsom has a 22- to 25-point advantage over Republicans Larry Elder, Kevin Faulconer, John Cox and Kevin Kiley. Newsom's lead cuts across gender, racial and age lines.</p>
<b>Such numbers could convince Elder to find other pursuits.</b> He
<p><b>"So it's hard for me to see, were I to have a rematch</b>, that the outcome would be a whole lot different. But I may change my mind over the next coming days."</p>
<b>But the recall also reinforced how geographically divided</b> California’s political landscape remains. In inland California,
<a>according to exit polls</a>, the pro-recall campaign won with 52 percent of the vote, while getting trounced everywhere else. With ballots still being counted, the
<a>recall was running ahead</a> in vast swaths of the state’s Central Valley, foothill regions and in the far northeastern reaches of the state.
<b>There were potential flickers of improvement for Newsom in inland California</b>. In Southern California, Newsom
<a>narrowly lost</a> Riverside County when he was elected in 2018. With ballots still being counted, he was
<a>narrowly defeating</a> the recall there.
<p><b>JOBS REPORT:</b> California has been adding new jobs faster than any other state in the country this year. A whopping 44 percent of all new positions added nationwide last month were in the Golden State, a figure Newsom was quick to tout today.</p>
<b>No industry was hit harder by the pandemic — or has since added more jobs</b> — than leisure and hospitality. State data show the sector has lost more than 400,000 workers during the pandemic, but has regained 360,200 since August 2020.

<b>Cast your mind back to mid-December of 2020. </b>We were in an uneasy interstice between election and certification, with California Republicans exulting in House seat flips and the horrors of Jan. 6 still to come. Gov.
<b>Few elected officials have seen their political</b> fortunes shift as dramatically in the last year as Newsom has.
<b>Now look where we stand: </b>
<b>It is a time of both repetition and change: </b>
<b>The decennial redistricting process is set to yield </b>new maps in a week or so,
<b> </b>defining the contours of California’s political landscape for the next decade. The churn is already well underway: A dozen Assembly members have already departed or announced plans to do so this year. On Thursday, Rep.
<b>Alan Lowenthal</b> became the fourth California House incumbent to reveal he will not be running in 2022. In a preview of inevitable member-on-member conflict, we could see three state lawmakers vying for the same L.A. supervisor seat: State Sen.
<b>Henry Stern </b>on Thursday joined Assemblymember
<b>Richard Bloom </b>in the contest for an opening seat that could also draw in State Sen.

<b>WELCOME TO OTTAWA PLAYBOOK. I'm your host, Nick Taylor-Vaisey.</b>
<p>The Playbook team wants to thank every reader for making Playbook part of your (early) morning routine — Hill insiders, politics junkies and casual observers alike. We read all the feedback. We love how the community grows and grows and grows. </p>
<p>We're signing off until Jan. 3. See you bright and early in 2022. </p>
<b>FIRST THING — </b>Government House Leader
<b>MARK HOLLAND</b>'s task sounded monumental. Take four election priorities and turn them into law. As former NDP House leader
<b>LIBBY DAVIES</b> told Playbook in November, Holland's success depended on his personal relationships with opposition House leaders.
<b>— Rewind:</b> Let's turn back the clock to August, when Prime Minister
<b>JUSTIN TRUDEAU</b> called an election. After securing a third term in the September vote but failing to nab a second majority, the Liberals waited more than a month to shuffle Cabinet — and almost
<i>another</i> month to recall Parliament. That left less than a month to force through a truncated legislative agenda at relative hyperspeed.
<p>Holland thanked his fellow House leaders for their "wonderful spirit of cooperation."</p>
<p>On the only legislation that came to a vote, <b>CHRYSTIA FREELAND</b>'s Covid recovery bill, Holland found a dance partner in the Bloc Québécois.</p>
<u>defending her C$7-billion bill</u>
<p><b>WHO HAS FREELAND’S EAR —</b> Deputy Prime Minister Freeland<b> </b>shared a glimpse of who she consults in her day-to-day while appearing in the Senate in her other role as finance minister of Canada.</p>
<p><b>ANDY BLATCHFORD </b>was watching:</p>
<p>Freeland dropped names after being pressed by Conservative Sen. <b>LEO HOUSAKOS</b> to explain whether she’s been snubbing top department officials.</p>
<a><u>Globe and Mail story</u></a> that reported, citing unnamed sources, that Freeland rarely takes department briefings and had not spoken to some of her assistant deputy ministers for months.
<b>MICHAEL SABIA</b>. She said she connects with Sabia by phone “four, five, maybe six times a day — some days more than that.” She stressed she works very closely with many other officials at Finance, including the department’s No. 2
<p>Freeland said she has no fewer than a half-dozen conversations with departmental officials every day, including weekends, early mornings and evenings. She said she often asks for briefing notes.</p>
<p>“I have never been a person who believes that Ottawa has a monopoly on good ideas,” she said.</p>
<b>RONA AMBROSE</b> and former Bank of Canada governor
<b>STEPHEN POLOZ</b>. She said she consults Poloz “pretty often.”
<b>OLAF SCHOLZ</b> became Germany’s chancellor, she had “very good conversations” with him in Washington. She said she has also spent a lot of time talking with U.S. Treasury Secretary
<p><b>CURSE ON CHRYSTIA —</b> Our friends at the Curse of Politics podcast had choice words for Minister Freeland in the aftermath of her <a><u>post-fiscal update interview on CTV's Power Play</u></a>. </p>
<p>We pulled some key quotes from <b>DAVID HERLE</b>, <b>JENNI BYRNE</b> and <b>SCOTT REID</b> on this week's episode (<a><u>which you can find here</u></a>).</p>
<p><b>REID:</b> Her manner seemed agitated. She seemed frustrated with Evan that she was having to explain herself. She wanted to take control of the interview instead of having a conversation. Possibly just as important, there was no message there.</p>
<p>She can't afford to <i>not</i> be better than she was — she has to be one of the government's most capable and effective communicators.</p>
<p>— For another take from another panel, here’s <a><u>CBC’s At Issue</u></a>.</p>
<b>PRAISE THE LORD —</b> Mandate letters
<u>dropped Thursday afternoon</u>
<b>— Something old, something new:</b> The
<a><u>Liberal election platform</u></a> naturally drops an awful lot of hints. But there's new stuff in the mandate letters, too. Take
<b>DOMINIC LEBLANC</b>, whose job includes improving leaders' debates "to ensure that they better serve the public interest."
<p>Government House Leader <b>MARK HOLLAND</b> was tasked with another priority nowhere to be found in the platform: "promoting free votes" that allow Liberal MPs to deviate from the government position.</p>
<p>POLITICO's Canada team pulled out <a><u>all the biggest mandate letter priorities for Pro subscribers</u></a>. Here are three highlights:</p>
<a><u>Coalition for a Better Future</u></a> that boasted in a missive to members that it has met with the PMO, Privy Council Office and Department of Finance.
<b>MELANIE JOLY</b>'s letter and came away disappointed. China merits zero mentions, though Joly will lead a "
<a><u>comprehensive Indo-Pacific strategy</u></a> to deepen diplomatic, economic and defence partnerships and international assistance in the region.”
<p>— Remember Bill C-10, the failed attempt to reform the Broadcasting Act that riled free-speech defenders before the election? It's Heritage Minister <b>PABLO RODRIGUEZ</b>'s job to <a><u>see that through once and for all</u></a>. Prepare for battle.</p>
<a><u>applies a Prairies lens</u></a>. CTV's
<a><u>her own Ctrl-F test</u></a>. ATIP guru
<a><u>disappearance of access-to-information</u></a> from the agenda.
<b>THE GREEN GIANTS </b>— Trudeau’s mandate letters give us a clearer look at how responsibilities will be split to implement the government’s ambitious climate agenda. For the first time, the environment minister (ATTN:
<b>STEVEN GUILBEAULT</b>) is the lead on driving the climate plan.
<p>Here’s <b>ZI-ANN’s</b> take: </p>
<p>There’s additional info on <a><u>Guilbeault’s long list of to-dos</u></a> and clarity on who he will partner with on key campaign promises.</p>
