<p>Of course, for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Exactly. Though by no means exclusively.</p>
<p>Who else? Well you might have trouble understanding an accent or dialect perhaps – an American watching Trainspotting, for example. Or you might just be a young person.</p>
<p>A young person? Yes. Research by captioning charity Stagetext found that young people are almost four times as likely to watch TV with subtitles as older viewers.</p>
<p>What kind of numbers are we talking about? So four out of five people aged 18 to 25 said they have subtitles on all or part of the time. For those between 56 and 75, it’s less than a quarter.</p>
<p>Though presumably they’re more likely to be deaf or hard of hearing. Nearly twice as likely.</p>
<p>So what is it about then? “I think there’s far more acceptance of subtitles by young people because it’s the norm,” said Stagetext’s chief executive, Melanie Sharpe. “They can take in far more information quickly because they’re used to it.”</p>
<p>Oh really? Indeed. TikTokker Youngmi Mayer, of Korean-American descent, <a>said:</a> “If you don’t understand Korean you didn’t really watch the same show.”</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a period romantic comedy in Korean. Maybe. Still, not as fun as real-time captioning?</p>
<p>Which is? You know, news bulletins, live sports etc when the subtitles are generated by speech-to-text programs, which are prone to <a>mishearing fails, as the BBC has often found out</a> <a>…</a></p>
<p>Do say: “Cromer, famous for its crab”; “Chinese year of the horse”; Benedict Cumberbatch.</p>
<p>Don’t say (as the BBC did): “Cromer, <a>famous for its crap”</a>; “Chinese <a>year of the whores”</a>; Benedict Couple Beer Batch.</p>

<a>mayor of Barcelona</a>, told me recently. “That’s why feminism needs to show its strength.”
<a>a corruption scandal</a> – announced that the government would propose a new sexual assault law that eliminated the distinction between rape and sexual abuse.
<p>A new exhibition at the Maritime Museum of <a>Barcelona</a> seeks to tell the story of the romantic and sexual reality of men who spend their lives at sea.</p>
<p>Some of these relationships were exploitative, given that children as young as eight were recruited as cabin boys, but the limited documentation that exists also describes many consensual relationships among crew members.</p>
<p>There is also a discussion of matelotage, a form of same-sex marriage between pirates that emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries on the Caribbean island of Tortuga that allowed the signatories to inherit from one another.</p>
<p>The second part of the exhibition looks at the creation of the hypermasculine sailor as an iconic gay image, in particular in the homoerotic work of the artist Touko Valio Laaksonen, better known as <a>Tom of Finland</a>.</p>
<p>There are examples of the kitsch masculinity of the French artists <a>Pierre Commoy and Gilles Blanchard</a>, as well as Jean Paul Gaultier’s use of homoerotic images of sailors in advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>There is also reference to the work of the French novelist and playwright Jean Genet, whose Querelle of Brest was made into a film by Rainer Werner Fassbinder in 1982.</p>
<p><a>The exhibition</a> is open until 11 November 2021.</p>

<p>The Gherkin, voted London's favourite tower, has been put into receivership 10 years after its completion helped transform the capital's skyline.</p>
<p>The 41-storey City landmark is likely to be put up for sale shortly and is expected to attract offers of more than £550m from Middle East sovereign wealth funds and other potential buyers.</p>
<p>Changing exchange rates had inflated the size of the original loan and the owners failed to make debt payments as they became due on several occasions.</p>
<p>The first 15 floors of the Norman Foster-designed skyscraper are occupied by the insurer Swiss Re, which originally owned the building. It sold out to IVG and its investment bank partner, Evans Randall, in 2007 for £630m.</p>
<p>Swiss Re spent about £238m building the Gherkin on the site at St Mary Axe of the Baltic Exchange shipping market, which was badly damaged by an IRA bomb attack in 1992.</p>
<p>It could be sold to a large global pension fund, or a US private equity house, but it was more likely that well-funded sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East or Asia would swoop, he added.</p>
<p>In December an investment firm owned by the Singapore government bought a half share of the massive Broadgate development in London for £1.7bn. Kuwait spent a similar amount buying an office complex next to Tower Bridge.</p>
<p>The Gherkin, which has won multiple awards, has run into trouble at a time when dozens of new skyscrapers are planned. Boris Johnson, the mayor, has been accused of being too eager to allow developers to change the skyline.</p>
<p>The rash of buildings with nicknames such as the Cheesegrater and Walkie Talkiehave attracted criticism, some of it from Prince Charles.</p>

<p>Although Bocuse was associated in the early 1970s with the rise of nouvelle cuisine, he later dissociated himself from that movement, saying it represented “not enough on your plate and too much on your bill”.</p>
<p>He is survived by Raymonde and their daughter, Françoise, and by a son, Jérôme, from a relationship with Raymone Carlut.</p>
<p> Paul François Pierre Bocuse, chef, born 11 February 1926; died 20 January 2018</p>
<p>Bill Buford is the author of Heat: An Amateur's Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta-Maker, and Apprentice to a Dante-Quoting Butcher in Tuscany</p>
<p>He ordered a big breakfast and we talked about the book. I wondered what Batali had made of it.</p>
<p>Heat: An Amateur's Adventures as Kitchen Slave, Line Cook, Pasta Maker and Apprentice to a Butcher in Tuscanyby Bill BufordJonathan Cape £16.99, pp325</p>
<p>I wondered if I should do a stage at Bob’s – bread is a fundamental of the French plate, why not? I asked one of Bob’s English friends, Martin Porter, a Liverpudlian in Lyon: Could he make inquiries on my behalf?</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Martin reported Bob’s saying. “Tell him to come see me one night.”</p>
<p>He stared. Was he trying to read me?</p>
<p>I come to you, I said, not only to learn how to make bread, but your bread. “It is famously good. What interests me is why.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said slowly: Ouiiiiii. He actually seemed to be getting excited. “Come. Work here. You will be welcome.”</p>
<p>“I will see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>We shook hands. I made to leave.</p>
<p>“You live across the street, right? You can stop by any time.”</p>
<p>“If you can’t sleep, come over. At three in the morning, I’ll be here. On Friday and Saturday, I’m here all night.”</p>
<p>I thought: If I can’t sleep at three in the morning, I don’t go for walks.</p>
<p>But I understood the message. Bob was making himself available. I’ll be your friend, he was saying.</p>
<p>“It’s the temperature of the air.”</p>
<p>“These two factors added together, plus the temperature of the water, should equal 54 degrees Celsius.” So, if the air was two degrees, and the flour was two degrees, the water would have to be 50.</p>
<p>“Exactly.” The water from the tap was steaming. Bob filled the carton. I asked: “Bob, you don’t use a thermometer?”</p>
<p>“Do you own a thermometer?”</p>
<p>“No.” He considered. “You know, I might.”</p>
<p>Bob poured the warm water into the basin and started an apparatus attached at the top, a mechanical kneader. Two hooks, looking like prosthetic hands, scooped up the dough very slowly.</p>
<p>He stopped the kneader and tore off a piece of dough. It was ready. It was thin and elastic. “You can see through it,” he said, laughing as he stretched it across my face like a mask.</p>
<p>Tonight’s dough would be ready the next afternoon. The morning’s baguettes would be made, therefore, from last night’s.</p>
<p>“Let’s get breakfast,” Bob said. An off-track-betting bar opened at six.</p>

<p>Put the giblets in a 38cm x 32cm lipped baking tray, add the oregano stalks, shallots, tinned pineapples and their juice, the extra pineapple juice and the sugar, and lay a rack on top.</p>
<p>Remove from the oven, cover loosely with foil and leave to rest for at least 30 minutes, so any juices from the bird drip down into the tray beneath. </p>
<p>Pour into a jug or bowl and serve with the turkey and fresh lime wedges.</p>

<p>Snacking often gets a bad rap because people associate snacks with processed and refined convenience foods that can have a negative effect on your health.</p>
<p>But when you snack smart, it can actually support your health, improve your wellbeing and keep you on track.</p>
<p>These snacks are all about proving you can have your cake and eat it too. And by that, I mean you can still snack your little heart out without throwing any health goals or dietary restrictions out the window.</p>
<h2>Garlic pita bread with lemony tahini dip</h2>
<p>Tahini is wonderfully versatile – it makes the perfect nut-free substitute for ingredients like peanut or almond butter, plus it suits both sweet and savoury dishes. When incorporated with fresh herbs, as I’ve done here, it’s a winning combo.</p>
<p>For the lemony tahini dip30g coriander leaves, torn20g flat-leaf parsley leaves, torn125ml extra-virgin olive oil135g hulled tahini125ml lemon juice, freshly squeezed 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped 1 tsp sea salt</p>
<p>Spoon the dip into a small serving bowl, place the still-warm pita breads on a platter and serve. Store leftover pita breads in an airtight container in the fridge for up to five days or freeze for up to one month.</p>
<p>I’m obsessed with fritters, rostis and hash browns. I think they’re the best way to get more veggies into your day and I simply can’t resist the golden-brown crunch that comes along with them.</p>
<p>For the chunky lime avo1 avocado, roughly diced2 limes (zest and juice)½ tsp sea salt</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 120C.</p>
<p>Place the pumpkin, arrowroot or tapioca flour, egg, chilli flakes, paprika and salt in a large bowl and mix well to make a thick and chunky batter.</p>
<p>Melt some of the butter or coconut oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add one heaped tablespoon of mixture per hash brown to the pan and press down gently with the back of your spoon to flatten.</p>
<p>To make the chunky lime avo, place the ingredients in a bowl and use the back of a fork to mash together until just combined. You want the avocado to be a little rough and chunky.</p>
<p>To serve, place your pumpkin hash browns on a share platter or serving plates, top with the chunky lime avo, chopped parsley and a sprinkle of extra chilli flakes, if desired.</p>
<p>400g cherries, fresh pitted or frozen and thawed 180g desiccated coconut250ml maple syrup, coconut nectar, or monk fruit syrup for low-carb diets3 tbsp coconut oil, warm and melted2 tsp vanilla bean paste or powder220g cacao butter125g cacao powder</p>
<p>Line a 20cm square cake tin and a baking tray with baking paper.</p>
<p>Place the cherries, desiccated coconut and half the sweetener in a food processor and blitz to form a thick, chunky paste. Add the warm coconut oil and one teaspoon of vanilla and pulse to combine well.</p>
<p>Press the cherry mixture into the prepared cake tin and flatten and spread all the way to the edges with your hands. Transfer to the freezer for 30 minutes to chill and firm up.</p>
<h2>Mini lemon and passionfruit cheesecakes</h2>
<p>If you can tolerate dairy but are eating low-carb, you can’t go past these mini cheesecakes. They’re basically tiny bite-size versions of a baked cheesecake, meaning you can grab one and eat it on the go.</p>
<p>For the crust200g blanched almond meal70g coconut sugar or granulated monk fruit sweetener for low carb85g butter, melted</p>
<p>For the lemon filling250g cream cheese125g sour cream, at room temperature2 eggs, at room temperature70g coconut sugar, or granulated monk fruit sweetener for low carb2 lemons (zest and juice)1 tsp vanilla bean paste or powder</p>
<p>For the topping125g passionfruit pulp, fresh or frozen and thawed</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180C and line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper cases (or use a silicone muffin tray).</p>
<p>For the crust, place the almond meal, sweetener and butter in a bowl and mix well to combine.</p>
<p>Spoon the crust evenly into the prepared muffin tin, then use the back of the spoon to press the mixture into the base so it is packed firm. Set aside.</p>
<p>For the lemon filling, place all the ingredients in a large bowl and beat with a handheld mixer until smooth and creamy.</p>
<p>Spoon the lemon filling over the crust and bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheesecakes are lightly golden brown on top and cooked through.</p>
<p>Allow the cheesecakes to cool slightly, then transfer to the fridge to chill for three to four hours, or until set.</p>
<p>To serve, top each cheesecake with some passionfruit pulp and enjoy.</p>
<h2>Red cabbage, apple and pomegranate salad</h2>
<p>Prep 10 minCook 10 minServes 6 as a side</p>
<p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 and line a baking tray (I use a reusable baking sheet).</p>
<p>Put the pumpkin seeds in a bowl with half the lemon juice, the chilli powder and a half-teaspoon of salt, mix well, then tip into the tray and spread out. Roast for eight minutes, until lightly golden, then remove and set aside.</p>
<p>Put the shredded cabbage in a large bowl, add the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice and a half-teaspoon of salt, then scrunch it repeatedly with a clean hand for about two minutes, until the cabbage wilts and softens.</p>

<p>Summer in Australia is synonymous with seafood, from fish and chips at the beach to prawns on the barbie. But how do we know if the seafood is sustainable – that is, harvested from healthy stocks with minimal negative environmental impacts?</p>
<p>More than a third of the world’s fisheries are being harvested at unsustainable levels, according to the latest figures from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation.</p>
<p>Research shows public awareness of the problem is growing. But 62% of the seafood Australians eat is imported, which can make it hard to determine the food’s provenance.</p>
<p>Eat farmed Australian oysters and mussels. It’s hard to go wrong here – fresh local oysters and mussels are widely available in stores and restaurants and are usually sustainable. Imported options are not widely available and are usually tinned.</p>
<li><p>When in doubt, pick fresh Australian seafood. Australian fisheries are better managed than most others around the world, making local fish usually the better choice.</p></li>
<p>My team and I <a>examined</a> more than 50,000 seafood products from south-east Queensland supermarkets, restaurants and other outlets and found only 5% could be classed as sustainable.</p>
<a>classified</a> as “say no” by the Good Fish guide, due to significant environmental impacts.
<a>working to address</a> these well-documented problems and the potential for improvement is high. It’s worth checking sustainable seafood guidelines frequently, as sustainability changes over time.
<p>The Good Fish guide <a>lists more options</a>, such as sustainable abalone (wild and farmed), mullet, mudcrabs and whiting.</p>
<p>Australia has no regulations requiring origin and species labels on cooked seafood. That means that when you buy flake, it could actually be a critically endangered species like the hammerhead or school shark.</p>
<p>Year after year the same few recipes haunt the internet like the ghosts of Christmas past. Coming at you with the ubiquity of a Mariah Carey carol is the Nutella/pastry Christmas tree.</p>
<p>Inter-family relations at our Christmas table were always fractious and spiced with loving animus, but the gift was always the amount of time, thought and effort that had gone into the offering.</p>
<p>Prep 20 minRest 3 hoursCook 45 minServes 8-10</p>
<p>For the dough 750g plain flour 75g caster sugar 2 tsp salt 14g dried yeast 9 eggs 450g unsalted butter</p>
<p>For the filling 60g unsalted butter 80g brown sugar 100g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids) 2 tbsp cocoa powder</p>
<p>For the egg wash 1 egg yolk 30ml pouring cream ½ tsp salt</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180C and mix together the egg wash ingredients with a fork. Egg wash the dough and bake for 45 minutes until firm and golden. Allow to cool on a rack and decorate further if you like.</p>
<p>Vegan barbecue is still an oxymoron for many, but as greater numbers of Australians turn to flexitarian diets, if not fully vegetarian or vegan, the meatless summer barbie is upon us.</p>
<p>Kit-wise, when doing a vegetarian barbecue, you may want to consider a model that has both a flat plate and a grill – it’ll make it easier to cook both faux meat and raw veggies.</p>
<p>Spoon’s easy take is as simple as a measure of olive oil to a measure of soy sauce in a jar, shaken well into an emulsion. You could add a little bit of Dijon mustard, she says, using the marinade on tofu, mushrooms, eggplant or cauliflower.</p>
<p>You may grill asparagus, cauliflowers and the like whole, but skewers are a good way to prep in advance. At standing events, things on sticks are always a good move. Load them with veggies and then marinate them on the skewer.</p>
<p>The magic of mushrooms shouldn’t be forgotten, often used in vegan products to mimic “meatiness”. The portobello in its natural form was a faithful burger substitute for decades before the likes of the Impossible Burger hit our consciousness.</p>
<p>While the product may mimic in look and taste, there are differences that should be considered, says Cancino, to get the best result from a plant-based patty or sausage.</p>

<h2>Candied peel Christmas tartlets (pictured above)</h2>
<p>For these little tartlets – an alternative to the mince pie – I use candied orange peel that I buy in December and keep in a stoppered glass jar to use throughout the year. The everyday tubs of peel will do at a push.</p>
<p>Makes 24For the pastrybutter 150g, plus extra for greasing the tart tinsplain flour 295gsalt a pinchice-cold water a little</p>
<p>For the fillinggolden syrup 200gsultanas 75gcandied peel 75gmixed spice a pinchbutter 25g plus a little extrasoft amaretti or plain, soft cake crumbs 85gegg 1 large, lightly beaten</p>
<p>You will need 2 x 12-cup mince pie or jam tart tins.</p>
<p>To make the pastry, cut the butter into small chunks and rub it into the flour with your fingertips. It should resemble fresh coarse breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>I sometimes add a pinch of salt. Sprinkle a little cold water over the crumbs and bring them together with your hands to form a soft, but not sticky, ball. Pat the dough into a thick disc, then wrap in kitchen paper and refrigerate for half an hour.</p>
<h2>Pork and cranberry terrine with apricot chutney</h2>
<p>Serves 8For the terrineonion 1 mediumbutter 30gthyme leaves 2 tsprosemary leaves 1 tspsmoked bacon 250gminced pork 400gground mace ½ tspjuniper berries 12dried apricots 80gfresh cranberries 60gmarsala or brandy 2 tbsp</p>
<p>To finishbacon 2 rashersbay leaves 4juniper berries 12cranberries 6</p>
<p>You will need 2 small (500ml) ovenproof preserving jars or a suitable earthenware terrine.</p>
<p>Half fill a roasting tin with hot water, place the jars or terrine into the water so it comes halfway up the sides. Bake for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Leave to cool in the switched-off oven, then remove and refrigerate overnight.</p>
<p>To make the chutney, peel the onions, then halve and cut each half into quarters. Separate the layers of onion. Warm the olive oil in a deep, heavy-based pan. Add the onions and let them cook for 10-15 minutes, or until soft and translucent.</p>
<p>Peel the apples, quarter and core them, then roughly chop. Add the apples to the pan, then the juice of the lemon. Once the apples start to collapse, halve the cherry tomatoes and stir them in.</p>
<p>Add salt and, if you wish, some coarsely ground black pepper, then bottle and seal. You should get a couple of decent-sized jars out of it.</p>
<p>It will keep, depending on the trouble you go to seal it (sterilised jars, please) for a good few weeks in a cool place. Sometimes I crack a pomegranate and add its ruby seeds to the chutney at the table.</p>
<h2>Red cabbage with apple and stilton</h2>
<p>The wine vinegar and fruit jelly melts to give a sweet-sour dressing for the cabbage. Sweetness often works rather well with blue cheese, though port has never rung my bell. Better, I think, are sweet white wines, even muscats.</p>
<p>Any blue cheese is a friend to cabbage – a favourite winter salad of mine involves tossing shredded white cabbage with slices of pear and smoked, salted almonds. A pale, crisp and nutty accompaniment.</p>
<p>Serves 2-3red cabbage 600gjuniper berries 8apples 2groundnut oil 3 tbsp white wine vinegar 150mlquince, apple or redcurrant jelly 3 tbspblue cheese 200g, such stilton or stichelton</p>
<p>Finely shred the cabbage and wash it in cold water. Crush the juniper berries with a heavy weight, such as a mortar or the end of a rolling pin. Cut the apples in half, then into segments, coring them as you go.</p>
<p>Pour in the white wine vinegar and let it sizzle. Add the fruit jelly and stir so that it melts and lightly coats the cabbage. Lift out with a draining spoon on to a serving dish. Crumble the cheese over the cabbage and apple, and serve.</p>
<h2>Roast duck with sweet potatoes and rosemary salt</h2>
<p>Serves 4duck legs 4rosemary leaves 4gsea salt 1 tbspsweet potatoes 800gduck fat 4 tbsp</p>
<p>Put the rosemary leaves and sea salt in a spice mill or food processor and process to a coarse green powder – you could use a pestle and mortar if you prefer. Rub the duck legs with a little of the duck fat then rub the herb salt into them.</p>
<p>Serve the duck with the sweet potatoes, spooning over any juices and duck fat remaining in the pan.</p>
<h2>Baked quince with maple syrup</h2>
<p>I bake mine, but like to poach them first in a light syrup. A quince is only good when it is so soft it is on the verge of collapse. They respond to sugar but also cloves, cinnamon quills and stars of anise, the prettiest of all spices.</p>
<p>Serves 4caster sugar 8 heaped tbspwater 1 litrequince 2 largelemon 1, halvedcloves 3maple syrup 4 tbspstar anise 2</p>
<h2>Stuffed chicken with chestnut, prune, apple, sage and onion</h2>
<p>Arrange the stuffing in a heap down the centre of the open chicken, then bring the sides and legs up and in to form a parcel (the skin can be helpful here). Using either a single piece of string or several lengths, tie the chicken into a bundle.</p>
<p>Rub the skin all over with olive oil, season and put the chicken breast side up in roasting tray or dish that’s just a bit larger than the bird itself. Roast for an hour, pouring the wine into the bottom of the dish after 30 minutes.</p>
