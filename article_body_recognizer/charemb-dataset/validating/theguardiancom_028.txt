<p>It was not a long love affair; we barely made it to spring. But all through autumn and into winter, we spent every other night together.</p>
<p>My new love felt like one of them: I liked that he had hair the colour of a conker, and the way he wore a bright red scarf, so that, sometimes, from the corner of my eye, he looked like a haw, like sustenance.</p>

<a>Kazakh Scientific Center of Dermatology and Infectious Diseases</a>. That is almost twice the national rate of HIV prevalence. Since 2013, HIV prevalence among the MSM community has risen by 442%.
<p>A significant contributing factor is that people, especially those in the MSM and transgender communities, are reluctant to go to medical institutions to be tested, says Suslov, which means they don’t discover their HIV status until it’s too late.</p>
<p>Homosexuality was prohibited by law in Kazakhstan until 1998. It is still illegal in nearby Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan.</p>
<p>“The situation is beginning to improve,” says Suslov. “People have become more aware of HIV and more people have begun to talk openly about the fact that they have been living with HIV for many years.”</p>

<p>According to UNAIDS, nearly 100 people die from AIDS-related <a>illnesses each day</a> in EECA.</p>
<p>“Covid-19 has made things very difficult. Trans people and men who have sex with men were mainly working in blue-collar jobs, but the pandemic greatly reduced the need for these jobs and many of our beneficiaries have struggled as a result.”</p>
<p>“When a person says thank you and tells me, for example, that they are happy to have tested negative because I helped them access PEP, I am so glad. I just love people and I want them to be OK,” says Tony.</p>

<a>World AIDS Day</a>, and was a time to remember those who have died from AIDS-related illnesses and to continue to campaign for equality of access to services regardless of someone’s background or where they live.
<p>Radian – a groundbreaking partnership between the Elton John AIDS Foundation and the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences – is taking steps to help reduce new HIV infections and to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030 in EECA.</p>
<p>Elena, a former drug user, was told by doctors that she had only three years to live when she was diagnosed with HIV 25 years ago. “It seemed like my whole life had stopped,” she says.</p>
<p>Today, her organisation supports people in Almaty living with HIV and helps them register for, and access, health services. But it is much more than a signposting service.</p>
<p>So what’s been her biggest reward over the years? “The success stories,” she says. “When you see that your work is not in vain, it’s cooler than a salary. When you see destinies change for the better – that’s the reward.”</p>
<p>Alina has been supporting people living with HIV in Romania for 17 years. Many of those who came to her in the early days are still in touch with her community organisation and are thriving. Some have even become real friends.</p>
<p>Over nearly two decades, Alina’s grassroots organisation, which has received funding through Radian, has been instrumental in helping to transform the lives of people living with HIV.</p>
<p>In the past 10 years, the number of people in Romania living with HIV has increased from 15,000 in 2010 to 19,000 in 2020, according to UNAIDS.</p>
<p>“More financial support and political will. As well as good HIV test centres, more doctors and new treatments. That’s what I want.”</p>
<p><sub>IHQ-UNB-1027 | November 2021</sub></p>
<a>while decreasing globally</a>. More than
<p>But community leaders of EECA grassroots organisations are optimistic that their work will help put a break on the regional epidemic and move it a step closer to meeting the UNAIDS goal to end HIV as a public health threat in the next nine years.</p>
<p>The HIV community leaders in EECA are sharing their personal stories to raise awareness about HIV and key challenges fuelling the epidemic in the region, in particular the stigma and discrimination associated with HIV and AIDS.</p>
<p>They are all part of the <a>Changemakers</a> campaign launched by Radian – a partnership between the Elton John AIDS Foundation and Gilead Sciences, which highlights the work of these inspirational individuals.</p>
<p>Lyubov, a 36-year-old mother and community activist from Kazakhstan, has lived with HIV for 17 years and understands the power of speaking out about her HIV status.</p>
<p>She works and lives in Almaty – Radian’s first Model City, a programme that helps fund the development of strategic city-wide HIV services.</p>
<p>Diagnosing people living with HIV and linking them to treatment and care is the “biggest gaps in the [EECA] region’s treatment efforts”, according to the UNAIDS <a>analysis</a> of the region in its global AIDS update report published in July.</p>
<a>World Health Organization</a>, trans people are 13 times more likely to be living with HIV than the cisgender adult population.
<p>Transforming the lives of people living with HIV is what drives these inspirational changemakers – despite all the obstacles.</p>
<p>But the clock is ticking, and altruism alone isn’t enough if EECA and the wider world is to eliminate HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.</p>

<h2>Beef and Saint Agur patties</h2>
<p>Jamaican patties are the perfect snack – ridiculously tasty, moreish and fun to make.</p>
<p>Prep 45 minutesCook 25 minutesMakes 8 patties</p>
<p>300g plain flour1 tsp turmeric1 tsp Jamaican curry powder120g shortening50g salted butter1 tbsp cider vinegar150ml ice-cold waterSalt1 egg, beaten for egg wash</p>
<p>Fry the beef, then add onions, red pepper, garlic, curry powder, black pepper and salt to taste. Cook for 10 minutes, then add stock and cook for another 10 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/GM4.</p>
<p>Brush the edge with egg wash, fold the pastry over and press to secure. Use the teeth of a fork to press down around the full semi-circle edge. Egg wash the top of the patties, and bake for 25 minutes. Leave to cool for 15 minutes before enjoying.</p>
<h2>Saint Agur chicken kiev</h2>
<p>The chicken kiev is a classic dish for a reason – it’s delicious. Garlicky butter, the crunch of the breadcrumbs – it’s almost unimprovable. Until you add some Saint Agur.</p>
<p>Mix the cheese with the butter, garlic, parsley and a pinch of black pepper, and stuff the chicken breast before coating in breadcrumbs and frying until golden.</p>
<p>And then comes the anticipation before you break through to the delicious juices inside.</p>
<p>Prep 25 minutesCook 20 minutesMakes 2 kievs</p>
<p>80g Saint Agur80g salted butter1 large garlic clove, crushed1 tbsp parsley, finely chopped1 tsp ground black pepper2 free-range chicken breasts100g plain flour2 eggs, beaten100g panko breadcrumbsVegetable oil, for frying</p>
<h2>Vegetable lasagne with Saint Agur</h2>
<p>For me a lasagne rich with a meat sauce is great. But in trying to reduce my meat intake, I’ve turned more to vegetable lasagnes, but I often find them lacking in … something.</p>
<p>Once cooked, the lasagne is joyful; the added dimension of bursts of creamy, tangy Saint Agur create a familiar, yet complex and utterly intoxicating dish.</p>
<p>Prep 45 minutesCook 45 minutesServes 4-6</p>
<p>2 aubergine3 courgettes750g lasagne sheets200g Saint Agur, cubedOlive oil</p>
<p>1 carrot, finely chopped2 celery sticks, finely chopped1 red onion, finely chopped1 white onion, finely chopped2 garlic cloves, crushed1 tbsp oreganoOlive oil2 tins of chopped tomatoes1 tbsp tomato pureeSalt and pepper</p>
<p>1½ pints of milk300g ricotta1 eggSalt and pepper</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/GM4. Slice the aubergine and courgettes lengthways, and dry fry, preferably on a griddle pan, for 10 minutes turning halfway.</p>
<p>Start the sauce by frying the carrot, celery, onions, garlic and oregano in olive oil until soft. Add tinned tomatoes, tomato puree, salt and pepper to taste, and cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>For the white sauce, mix together the milk, ricotta, egg, salt and pepper.</p>
<p>Bake in the oven for 45 minutes until nicely browned and bubbling. Rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
<h2>Waldorf Saint Agur salad</h2>
<p>Already a delight of texture and taste, with leaves, apple, celery and walnuts united by a mayonnaise dressing, it’s at once sweet and savoury, crunchy and crisp.</p>
<p>In a big bowl, mix together mayonnaise, yoghurt, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Gently add in the apple, celery, grapes and walnuts. Finally, add the lettuce and Saint Agur, and gently mix before serving.</p>

<p>The white wineSweet white wines such as sauternes or ice wine are an absolute classic here, but for honey-pear-syrup-sponge deliciousness, you really can’t get any better than a Hungarian tokaj aszú.</p>
<p>The beerAvoiding high bitterness is the aim here. What we want is fruity malt character, and the warming flutter of alcohol flickering in the throat to balance the cheese’s peppery funk.</p>
<p>Switch the fino sherry out for oloroso, and enjoy all those wonderful woody, autumnal aromas mingling like far-off bonfire smoke with the sky – bringing out our cheese’s umami.</p>
<p>If you’d rather enjoy the almondy-spritz of a fino rebujito to celebrate the salty, piquant nature of your cheese, absolutely go for it. And if you use lemonade instead of lemon juice and soda – who am I to judge?</p>
<p>Try something slightly sweet and slightly tannic to balance out the salty, funky flavours of the cheese – and a cider with a little bit of natural yeast earthiness will also pair beautifully.</p>
<p>Locals, however, prefer to graze on another delicacy. Blandine Pontier, technical manager at the fromagerie, has a one-step rule to best enjoy Saint Agur: “Simply add it to a galette [savoury crepe].” Bon appétit! </p>

<p>We have been together more than half our lives and have two children we adore. We have earned enough to stop work, eat out and take holidays abroad when we want.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve had the easier life. My father didn’t walk out, no teacher groomed me, I suffered no anxiety or sectionable mental illness. I’ve had nothing to be angry at.</p>
<p>You have no desire for me. Although you acquiesce to sex, from our honeymoon onwards, your body couldn’t hide that you usually didn’t want me. I’m not sure we were ever compatible and I’m finally above reminding or begging you for closeness.</p>
<p>You walked out of the couples’ therapy I had arranged. You said there was no problem to discuss, despite my pleas.</p>
<p>Our second child is a source of closeness right now. But she will grow up and we’ll be back alone with each other – and your anger – soon.</p>
<p>Whatever you have spat at me in the past, I believe you when you say I’m reliable. You joked that you would even tolerate an affair. I love you, very badly. I wish I knew how we could start again.</p>
<p>“Down’s syndrome?” I asked. In those days, I only knew of one syndrome.</p>
<p>“Yes, or something similar. The muscle tone seems to be low, and the feet are too small. See?”</p>
<p>So, if you know someone who has a child with autism, here are 10 ways you can help:</p>
<p>1. Encourage your friend to seek out whatever support is on offer from social and educational services. When parents and services work together in a mutually respectful way, everyone is a winner.</p>
<p>4. Strangers’ curiosity is often unwelcome. An inquisitive stare or an ill-judged remark can be the last straw. Having you by her side to fend off unwanted interest, or offer calm explanations will make all the difference.</p>
<p>9. A mother of an autistic child may say that she can’t come for an evening out, as it is simply too difficult for her to leave home. Keep asking, keep reminding her that she is a valued friend, and that her company is very much wanted.</p>
<p>I am incredibly grateful for the compassion Dignitas provides. I hope others in my position can say the same of the UK in the future.</p>

<p>Grammy-winning singer <a>Billie Eilish</a> has spoken about an addiction to watching pornography, starting at age 11, and how it gave her nightmares and messed her up when she started dating.</p>
<p>Eilish, who turns 20 on Saturday, was speaking on the Howard Stern Show on Sirius XM radio on Monday.</p>
<p>“I think porn is a disgrace. I used to watch a lot of porn, to be honest. I started watching porn when I was, like, 11,” the Bad Guy singer said, saying it helped her feel as if she were cool and “one of the guys”.</p>
<p>“I think it really destroyed my brain and I feel incredibly devastated that I was exposed to so much porn,” she added, saying she suffered nightmares because some of the content she watched was so violent and abusive.</p>
<p>Eilish, who was homeschooled in Los Angeles and has seven Grammy awards, is known for her often dark lyrics.</p>
<p>In the ballad <a>Male Fantasy</a> on her second album <a>Happier Than Ever</a>, she sings about being home alone and distracting herself with pornography as she recalls a broken relationship.</p>
<p>Eilish said she is now angry at herself for thinking it was OK to watch so much porn.</p>
<p>“The first few times I, you know, had sex, I was not saying no to things that were not good. It was because I thought that’s what I was supposed to be attracted to,” she said.</p>

<p>The singer said her fame had made it hard to date.</p>
<p>“It’s really hard to meet people when, you know, people are either terrified of you or think you’re out of their league,” Eilish told Stern.</p>
<p>In the same interview with Stern, <a>Eilish revealed she had Covid</a> in August and was unwell for two months and is sure she “would have died” if she hadn’t been vaccinated.</p>
<p>“I want it to be clear that it is because of the vaccine I’m fine,” she said. “I think if I weren’t vaccinated, I would have died, because it was bad.</p>
