<h1> As L.A. fights port gridlock, U.S. and global leaders pledge to curb shipping emissions </h1>
<div><div> By Anna M. Phillips </div></div>
<a>emissions to zero by 2050</a>.
<p>Calling the declaration “a big step forward,” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said Wednesday that the U.S. would help lead the effort to limit the industry’s environmental impact.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as the ports of L.A. and Long Beach, the busiest in the U.S., face increased scrutiny over cargo ship logjams and worsening air pollution.</p>
<p>When cargo ships burn fuel, they emit more than carbon dioxide, belching a combination of smog-forming pollutants, including ozone, nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, that has been linked to an increase in deaths.</p>
<p><a>Air quality data</a> for 2020 released by the Port of L.A. show that pollution increased sharply beginning last October, as the number of ships waiting to unload began to grow. Similar data for this year are not yet available.</p>
<a>projections</a> by the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
<p>But there have been few signs of that. The organization, known as the International Maritime Organization, has repeatedly delayed regulations to limit emissions in recent years.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>How a coast crowded with ships, port gridlock and an anchor may have caused O.C. oil spill</a> </p></div>
<p>A final determination for the cause of the spill may take months, but Coast Guard investigators have come up with no other explanation than anchor drag, federal sources said.</p>
<p>Chris Cannon, chief sustainability officer for the L.A. port, said it is too soon to know whether the port’s extended hours have succeeded in reducing the amount of time ships spend waiting to dock.</p>
<p>The port is still grappling with huge stacks of shipping containers and is looking at new locations away from the terminal where they can be moved so that arriving ships can be unloaded faster.</p>
<p>Ed Avol, a professor at USC’s Keck School of Medicine, said it’s difficult to predict how air pollution from the idling cargo ships will affect residents along the coast.</p>
<p>Follow a container of board games from China to St. Louis to see all the delays it encounters along the way.</p>
<p>For residents living near the ports who already suffer from asthma and other respiratory or cardiac problems, a months-long increase in air pollution could “push them over the edge,” Avol said.</p>
<p>But when the pandemic began, the ports delayed the fee. Under a <a>recently announced plan</a>, they won’t begin collecting it until April.</p>

<h1> L.A.’s port could have been in Santa Monica. Here’s how San Pedro won out </h1>
<div>Terminal Island is now home to a federal prison, which has housed Charles Manson and other notorious criminals. It’s seen here, in very different circumstances, on a vintage postcard from Patt Morrison’s collection. </div>
<div><div> By Patt MorrisonColumnist </div></div>
<p>If matters had gone differently about 125 years ago, all those monster cargo ships now backed up at anchor <a>off San Pedro</a> would instead be waiting offshore from the sands of Santa Monica.</p>
<p>Today — at least when the <a>supply chain</a> isn’t throttled — 40% of all U.S.-bound cargo comes through the twinned ports of L.A. and Long Beach, the biggest port operation in North America.</p>
<a>cattle hides</a>, was legalized and regulated — and its rules regularly flouted by ships’ captains bringing the world’s luxuries to California in exchange.
<p>Not by any stretch an ideal harbor for a soon-to-be city.</p>
<p>Why, you may be wondering, would L.A.’s port be way down in San Pedro, when there was a perfectly good beach closer at hand, at Santa Monica?</p>
<p>The fact of it is that neither place was any mariner’s notion of an ideal harbor, but by 1890, as the city’s population and eminence were muscular, the showdown between the two sites was coming on fast.</p>
<p>Huntington was not accustomed to being thwarted, and local agencies, the state Legislature and Congress were populated with men who in some fashion or another were beholden to “Uncle Collis.”</p>
<div><div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Who killed L.A.’s streetcars? We all did</a> </p></div><p>General Motors? Big Oil? Big Rubber? The demise of L.A.'s streetcars stemmed from public policy and our own appetite for automobiles.</p></div>
<p>And Huntington, right in the middle of the seven years of federal study and debate over funding a breakwater for a new port, made a costly, calculated throwdown. </p>
<p>Before his harbor heroics, and as a state official and U.S. senator, White had defended the disgraceful 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act and in 1893, <a>went on the record with ugly comments</a> about the Chinese as “an alien race” and worse. </p>
<a>Otis gloated in print</a>: “THE EAGLE SCREAMS: SAN PEDRO SELECTED AS THE PEOPLE’S HARBOR … LOS ANGELES REJOICES LOUDLY OVER THE VICTORY … PARADE IN CELEBRATION OF THE GOOD NEWS.”
<p>The Long Wharf, the world’s longest wooden pier, was dismantled by 1933, and a historical marker alone notes its tale.</p>
<p>The U.S. military found the new port sites useful. For 60 years, a military reserve site loomed on a cliff above San Pedro, principally as Fort MacArthur, and between 1932 and the 1990s, Long Beach was home port for the Pacific Fleet.</p>
<p>Some of you may have cleverly noticed the fly in the ointment. San Pedro and Wilmington were their own towns, not part of Los Angeles. How, then, could they be the Port of Los Angeles if they were not in Los Angeles?</p>
<p>Voters in L.A. and in the “city strip” voted for the idea in 1906, and three years later, Wilmington and San Pedro voted to surrender their independent city status and join Los Angeles.</p>
<a>Charles Manson</a>, and the LSD enthusiast Timothy Leary.
<p>Eighty years later, Metrolink construction forced its move to a storage yard, but San Pedro came to the rescue of its savior senator, and the statue stands now near the entrance to Cabrillo Beach. <a>For now.</a></p>

<h1> Is the ports logjam really getting better? The numbers don’t tell the whole story </h1>
<div><div> By Sam DeanStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>San Pedro Bay is looking less crowded these days. The fleet of massive container ships loitering just offshore from the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles has thinned to 46 boats from its peak of more than 80 in late October.</p>
<p>Is that a good sign for Southern California’s congested supply chain, and the breathability of its air? That depends on who you ask.</p>
<p>“It’s an apples-to-oranges comparison,” said Sal Mercogliano, professor of maritime history at North Carolina’s Campbell University and a former merchant mariner who criticized the comment on social media.</p>
<div><p><a>Business</a></p><p> <a>A broken supply chain is a moneymaking opportunity. For who? Shipping companies</a> </p></div>
<p>The logjam at the ports and larger supply chain disruptions have led to record-setting profits for big companies in the logistics business.</p>
<p>“We’ve been averaging 900,000 containers a month for 17 months now,” Seroka said. “This is really peak performance.”</p>
<p>The Port of Long Beach has been working at a similar clip, with its monthly throughput hovering around 800,000 TEUs over the same period. </p>
<p>The week of Thanksgiving showed a slowdown at the L.A. port, with only 63,000 TEUs unloaded, but the port is back to full capacity this week, Seroka said, and he believes that that number can go higher in coming months. </p>
<p>Follow a container of board games from China to St. Louis to see all the delays it encounters along the way.</p>
<p>“We had a wind event about four weeks ago, and it scared the daylights out of all of us” when 50- to 60-mile-per-hour winds started pushing boats around, Seroka said. </p>
<a>air quality in the L.A. area declined</a> and
<a>calls for regulating emissions from the shipping industry</a> intensified.
<div><p><a>Opinion</a></p><p> <a>Editorial: Supply chain issues affect almost everything, but surge in port pollution threatens our lungs</a> </p></div>
<p>It’s time for air quality officials to drop the hammer and regulate pollution from the ports of L.A. and Long Beach, where a jam of diesel-spewing cargo ships has nearly doubled emissions during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The California agencies that regulate air quality said that they were not consulted on the shift before it was announced, though they are cautiously optimistic that it could help improve the situation. </p>
<p>“We do not yet know what the net impact or benefit of these potentially higher emissions would be for our region’s air quality,” agency spokesperson Nahal Mogharabi said. </p>
<p>The container fleet may be out of sight, but it’s not out of mind. And the ports will probably continue to be a bottleneck for U.S. imports for months to come.</p>

<h1> Marine killed in crash while helping disabled vehicle on I-5 is identified </h1>

<p>The 20-year-old Marine who was struck and killed while he assisted a driver in a disabled vehicle on Interstate 5 near Camp Pendleton was identified Tuesday as Lance Cpl. Alberto Lucio. </p>
<p>Lucio, a military policeman stationed at the nearby base, stopped after a Ford Edge crashed in the southbound lanes near Las Pulgas Road about 3:20 a.m. Monday. </p>
<p>The vehicle was in the traffic lanes without its lights on, according to the California Highway Patrol and San Diego County medical examiner’s office. </p>
<p>As Lucio assisted the driver and a passenger, a box truck crashed into the Marine and the disabled SUV, the CHP said.</p>
<p>Lucio died at the scene. </p>
<p>Marine officials said he was from Smithville, Tenn. His military awards include the National Defense Service Medal and the Global War on Terrorism Medal.</p>
<p>The SUV driver, a 36-year-old man, and his passenger, a 31-year-old woman, suffered major injuries and were taken to a hospital for treatment. An update on their condition was not available Tuesday. </p>

<h1> Column: When ‘Vice President Harris’ became inevitable, trouble was sure to follow </h1>
<div><div> By Jonah GoldbergColumnist </div></div>
<p>Things have not gone well for Vice President Kamala Harris. Not only is she less popular than her boss, but according to one <a>recent poll</a>, she even broke Dick Cheney’s <a>record</a> for most unpopular sitting vice president.</p>
<p>But it’s worse than that. Cheney — fairly or unfairly — was unpopular because a lot of people thought he was in charge. He also shot a guy in the face. It was an accident, but still.</p>
<a>jumping</a> ship. And that ship is leaking like a sieve. Festivus arrived early on HMS Harris with disgruntled and loyal staffers alike airing grievances on a daily basis.
<a>former Harris staffer</a>, referencing recent support for Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg’s

<p>No matter how you slice it, giving a huge tax cut to the super-rich is a weird thing to do when you’ve been claiming that the solution to our problems is simply getting the rich to “pay their fair share.” </p>
<div><p><a>Opinion</a></p><p> <a>Jonah Goldberg: I left Fox News after 12 years. Tucker Carlson’s ‘Patriot Purge’ was the final straw </a> </p></div>
<p>Carlson’s series ‘Patriot Purge’ is a perfect example of propaganda that weaves half-truths into a whole lie. </p>
<p>Such defenses strike me as evidence they don’t know how to do any other kind of politics — only the kind where every setback looks racist and sexist.</p>
<a>two CNN reporters explain</a>. “People are expecting their historic vice president to make history every day when in fact she’s trying to carry the duties of a secondary role.”
<p>There’s obviously some truth to that. Putting her in charge of the “root causes” of the border crisis was a recipe for failure.</p>
<p>But that begs the question: Since when is it the job of the president to prioritize the political success of the vice president?</p>
<p>Huh. Of all the arguments good and bad for abolishing the filibuster, it never occurred to me that making Harris look good was one of them. But such ideas make sense when you think your job is to be symbolic and historic.</p>

<p>“Recently,” <a>wrote the man</a> who co-sponsored the “Discouraging Frivolous Lawsuits Act, “I was presented with a new opportunity to fight for the most important issues I believe in.” </p>
<p>What might those be? He didn’t bother to say.</p>

<p>After all, <a>he came very close</a> to putting his daughter Ivanka, a onetime model and handbag purveyor, in charge of the World Bank. </p>

<h1> L.A. Master Chorale cancels ‘Messiah’ singalong at Disney Hall, citing abundance of caution </h1>
<div><div> By Jessica GeltStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>The Master Chorale is replacing the event with a free outdoor singalong, “Carols on the Plaza,” at 6 p.m. Dec. 20 on the plaza at the Music Center downtown.</p>
<p> Cancellation will result in the loss of about $30,000, says Davidson, but fortunately, the Master Chorale has been the recipient of emergency funding for situations such as this. It also has a pending shuttered venues grant of $250,000.</p>
<p>Davidson says that other than the cancellation, the Master Chorale is operating under the assumption that the rest of its season will go ahead as planned, including a regular Dec. 19 performance of Handel’s “Messiah.”</p>
<p>“Our biggest concern now is to get the word out that there’s this free singalong,” says Davidson. “It’ll be fun whether there are five people or 200 or more.”</p>

<p>The most important day of Jon Batiste’s career got off to a bumpy start.</p>
<p>On Nov. 23, the day Grammy nominations were announced, Batiste was part of the morning livestream, and he had a challenging assignment: pronouncing the names of the nominees in five Latin or Mexican categories.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Batiste is adept at explaining WTF he is, analyzing what his success means and explaining what he wants to accomplish. He emphasizes two interrelated biographical details: He’s from a music family, and he’s from New Orleans.</p>

<p>‘Colbert’ bandleader Jon Batiste leads the field with 11 nominations; Tony Bennett, Olivia Rodrigo, Doja Cat, Justin Bieber and H.E.R. will vie for top prizes.</p>
<p>Batiste thinks of “We Are” as his first proper studio album, partly because it was the first time he had a budget that didn’t come out of his own pocket.</p>
<p>“Jon did it himself,” says star guitarist Robert Randolph, who played on “We Are.” “He produced and wrote the music. He’s the guy in charge, and it’s his vision.”</p>
<p>“We Are” was also the first time Batiste understood and could articulate his worldview, an idealistic and universal humanism in which music unites people but also acknowledges the specific struggle Black people face.</p>

<h1> Nick Cannon grieves the death of youngest son, Zen, from brain cancer </h1>
<div><div> By Christie D’ZurillaStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>Nick Cannon is grieving the loss of his 5-month-old son, Zen, who has died of brain cancer, the talk-show host and TV personality said Tuesday as he introduced his syndicated program. </p>
<p>“We called him Z Chillin — he was always smiling, always having the most beautiful spirit,” Cannon said. </p>
<p>They wound up taking Zen to the doctor to check out his sinuses, but it turned out the problem was worse: hydrocephalus, or fluid on the brain, and a tumor. Zen immediately had brain surgery, including a shunt to remove the fluid. </p>

<p>On Tuesday’s faith-focused “Soul of a Nation,” Nick Cannon talks about how he’s repenting rather than simply apologizing for anti-Semitic comments.</p>
<p>Cannon said he “embraced every moment” of his young son’s life, and praised Zen’s mom. </p>
<p>Around Thanksgiving, he said, the cancer’s progress sped up. “It was cancer in the brain and the tumor began to grow a lot faster. And so we knew that time was ... ,” he said, choking up. </p>
<p>At this point, near tears, he struggled to hold back his emotions. </p>

<p>“I’m holding my son for the last time. But it was a beautiful setting,” Cannon said, noting that at that point he was still preparing for his day as usual. But on the way to the airport, he said he just had to turn back. </p>
<p>“I turned around and not only did we get to see the sun rise, but we got to see the sun set too,” he said. </p>
<p>The exact date of Zen Cannon’s death is unclear. </p>

<p>Dr. Courtney Martin reached for her phone, opened the notes app to an empty screen and began to write.</p>
<p>Martin is the head of maternity services at Loma Linda University Medical Center, an accomplished physician and surgeon, a dynamic presence.</p>
<h3>As a 9-year-old, she was saved at sea. Thirty-five years later, she reunited with her rescuers</h3>
<p>Kept afloat by her orange life jacket and the bow of her family’s capsized boat, 9-year-old Desireé Rodriguez had watched helplessly as one family member after another let go of life.</p>
<h3>After getting his DNA results, he messaged a stranger: I think you might be my father</h3>
<p>One evening last fall, Joseph Arriaga sat at his laptop and sent a Facebook message to a stranger.</p>

<p>Nearly 29 years had passed when Trino Jimenez decided to write to the man who murdered his brother, prepared to never hear back.</p>

<p>“I can never forget him, but I am not consumed about an event that can never be undone,” he told Carroll in his February 2015 letter. “God loves you and even the crime of murder is a forgivable offense.”</p>

<p>To ward off the deadly virus that had invaded his small apartment, Jose Guadalupe Zubia slept in a surgical mask and cracked open a window beside his bed.</p>
<p>When his sons and daughters tested positive for COVID-19, Jose was the only one who tested negative. The children were determined to protect their diabetic father. But they lived crammed together in a one-bedroom apartment in South Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In South L.A., nearly 1 out of every 5 homes is overcrowded — typically defined as more than one person per room.</p>
<p>Nearly all their combined income went toward the rent. None of the children could afford to move out. So the Zubias had made do with an arrangement that was uncomfortable but tolerable — until the coronavirus hit.</p>

<div> Covering Kamala Harris </div>
<h1> Harris pushes for expansion of maternal healthcare, Medicaid postpartum coverage </h1>
<div><div> By Erin B. Logan, <div>Marissa Evans</div></div></div>
<p>Harris’ call to action came during the White House’s first Maternal Health Day of Action Summit, held to draw attention to the fact that the U.S. maternal mortality rate is more than double that of most other developed nations.</p>
<p>“In the United States of America, in the 21st century, being pregnant and giving birth should not carry such great risk,” Harris said during the summit.</p>
<p>Black mothers are three to four times more likely than white women to die of pregnancy complications. Native American women are twice as likely to <a>die</a> before, during or after childbirth.</p>
<p>“A healthy economy requires healthy mothers and healthy babies,” Harris said. </p>
<p>The maternal health summit is part of the Biden administration’s effort to push more states to extend Medicaid coverage for mothers up to a year after they give birth and to call out health inequities and racial health disparities. </p>
<p>Maternal health experts and advocates say extending coverage for parents during the critical one-year postpartum period helps ensure they have continued access to care.</p>
<p>Currently, states are only required to provide 60 days of postpartum coverage under Medicaid. </p>
<p>The $1.7-trillion social safety net and climate package currently being negotiated in the Senate would require states to provide one year of postpartum coverage under Medicaid. The bill passed the House last month. </p>
<div><p><a>Politics</a></p><p> <a>House approves Biden’s social spending plan</a> </p></div>
<p>House Democrats approve a sweeping measure to boost social safety net programs and climate change measures, after a delay from Rep. Kevin McCarthy.</p>
<p>Harris urged states to extend coverage on their own and not wait for Congress to act. </p>
<p>“This action will save lives and it will change lives,” Harris said. </p>
<p>The Democrats’ package would also provide $3 billion in maternal healthcare funding to expand the perinatal workforce, improve data collection and address the social factors that contribute to poor maternal health outcomes.</p>
<p>Nationally, <a>nearly 700 women die</a> each year of pregnancy complications, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. </p>
<p>In recent years, the CDC has found that some of the most <a>common pregnancy-related complications</a> include infections, cardiovascular issues, bleeding out, high blood pressure and pulmonary embolisms. </p>
<a>CDC</a>. Hispanic or Latina women had the lowest rates, with nearly 12 deaths per 100,000 live births in the same timeframe.
<p>Allyson Felix, an Olympic track star who participated in Tuesday‘s White House event, said in a statement her pregnancy complications risked her and her daughter’s life. </p>
<p>California has long been seen by public health experts as a national example of how to decrease maternal deaths. </p>
<p>By 2016, California’s maternal mortality declined by 65%. </p>
<p>The law also updates data collection and protocols for counties participating in the Fetal and Infant Mortality Review Process, and establishes a fund for midwife training programs that prioritize admitting underrepresented groups.</p>

<h1> Surgeon general warns of emerging youth mental health crisis in rare public advisory </h1>
<div><div> By Howard Blume, <div>Melissa Gomez</div></div></div>
<a>disruption took a toll</a> and worsened their mental health —
<a>especially for such groups</a> as immigrants,
<a>students with disabilities</a> and students of color from low-income families.
<p>“This is unprecedented, the amount of trauma that our students are experiencing on a mass scale,” said Loretta Whitson, executive director of the California Assn. of School Counselors. </p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>If you need mental health help, reach out. Here are some resources</a> </p></div>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected nearly everyone’s mental health. If you’re looking for help, here’s a list of resources </p>
<p>The advisory calls for a broad-based and rapid response from government, social media companies, community groups, schools, teachers, parents and even students —and listed resources available to them.</p>
<p>But even here, students have been struggling, said Jesus El, a 17-year-old senior. Despite concerted efforts from teachers, many students became disengaged after campuses shut down and learning moved online to the Zoom format.</p>
<p>And students also are having difficulties adjusting to the resumption of in-person schooling.</p>
<p>Similarly, senior Sydnee Breda-Nixon, 17, looks out for friends.</p>

<p>What is therapy and what happens in a session? What kinds are available? An introduction to a critical tool for better mental health.</p>
<p>Sydnee wasn’t doing so well herself. For a time, she lost interest in activities and engaging with family and friends. The pandemic made everything feel so dull and hopeless, she said, but her bond with an older sister helped pull her out.</p>
<p>Murthy also emphasized the role institutions play in creating accessible and seamless mental health support and noted that pandemic-relief aid — billions of dollars went to L.A. Unified alone — is supposed to target mental health.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>How Latinos are bonding over first-generation trauma</a> </p></div>
<p>First generation trauma is an emerging term in the Latino community, with people talking about it on social media. Here’s how it affects children of immigrant parents.</p>
<p>The national average of caseloads for school counselors remains high, with 424 students per counselor for the 2019-20 school year. Professional guidelines recommend a ratio of 250 students per counselor.</p>
<p>Daniel Eisenberg, a professor of health policy of management at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, said he agreed with the advisory’s holistic approach in taking on problems that had been worsening long before the pandemic.</p>
<p>“This is an issue that really requires a long-term investment from all the stakeholders mentioned in the advisory, our entire society ... for years and decades to come,” Eisenberg said.</p>
<p>A positive sign is that “young people are very <a>knowledgeable and energized about mental health</a> as an issue,” Eisenberg said.</p>
<p>Murthy said there’s a connection between the two advisories because misinformation can amplify polarization, “and that actually creates a really stressful environment.”</p>
<p>“I’ve learned from my own small children — they’re very sensitive to disagreement around them, whether their parents are arguing or other people are arguing.”</p>

<h1> L.A. approves its redistricting map, setting political boundaries for the next decade </h1>
<div><div> By David ZahniserStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to finalize its new set of district maps for the next 10 years, bringing a quiet end to a <a>frequently contentious</a> redistricting process.</p>
<a>Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum</a>,
<a>Banc of California Stadium</a> and the
<a>California African American Museum</a>
<b> </b>— moved out of Price’s district and into his own. On social media, Harris-Dawson said his district lacks major economic assets,
<a>describing the issue</a> as a matter of “Black equity, representation and fairness.”
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>First-ever redistricting commission to draw boundaries for L.A. County supervisors</a> </p></div>
<p>Each map under consideration would create a second district with a large Latino voter population. But Black and Asian voters would be grouped differently.</p>
<p>Once the redistricting plan came up, however, Harris-Dawson voted with his colleagues to approve the ordinance. No one on the council brought up Exposition Park or any other facet of the redistricting map. Councilman Joe Buscaino was absent.</p>
<p>Harris-Dawson did not respond to The Times’ inquiries about his “yes” vote. </p>
<p>Price, whose district stretches from Staples Center south to 95th Street, said he wasn’t surprised that the vote went so smoothly, given the calls from his constituents for Exposition Park to stay in his district.</p>
<p>“My constituents worked very hard to express their points of view, and I think my colleagues recognized that,” said Price, whose district is overwhelmingly Latino and considered the city’s most impoverished.</p>
<p>The council creates new boundaries for its 15 districts every 10 years, following the release of U.S. census data. To ensure equal representation, each of L.A.’s council districts must have around 260,000 constituents.</p>
<p>The tug of war over Exposition Park was a subplot of this year’s redistricting process, but it was frequently overshadowed by debates over how to reconfigure council districts in the Valley.</p>
<p>In October, a 21-member citizens commission recommended a map that would place five and two-thirds council districts within the Valley, a change aimed at giving that region’s voters more political clout. </p>

<p>As part of that proposal, the commission recommended <a>huge changes</a> to districts represented by council members Paul Krekorian, Bob Blumenfield and Nithya Raman. Neighborhood leaders in the Valley quickly rebelled.</p>
<a>expected to lose about 40%</a> of her current constituents as her district moves deeper into the Valley and takes in all or a portion of Encino, Studio City and Reseda.
<p>Like Harris-Dawson, Raman <a>voted against</a> the <a>redistricting plan</a> last month. On Tuesday, however, she sided with the rest of her colleagues.</p>
<p>Koreatown’s boundaries were also a major issue during the city’s redistricting decisions of 2002 and 2012.</p>

<h1> USC student, overseas traveler are L.A. County’s 2nd and 3rd Omicron cases </h1>
<div><div> By Luke Money, <div>Rong-Gong Lin II</div></div></div>
<p>Officials reported Los Angeles County’s second and third confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus Monday: a USC student who had recently returned from the East Coast and someone who traveled from western Africa. </p>
<p> Both the USC student, who officials said had been traveling for the holidays, and the traveler who came from western Africa were fully vaccinated and had mild COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>Close contacts who have been identified for the student are quarantining and being tested for infection, according to the county Department of Public Health. The student probably acquired the infection outside L.A. County. </p>
<p>Close contacts for the traveler from western Africa have been vaccinated and tested negative.</p>
<p>USC officials said Monday afternoon that the student “is currently isolating and doing well.”</p>

<a>comes four days after</a> L.A. County confirmed its first case of the highly mutated strain. Officials said that infection was likely also travel-related, as the person had returned to L.A. after flying to South Africa via London on Nov. 22.
<p>Additional Omicron cases have been <a>documented in San Francisco</a> and in <a>Alameda County</a>.</p>
<h1> California prepares for winter COVID-19 surge; if not from Omicron, then from Delta </h1>
<div><div> By Rong-Gong Lin II, <div>Luke Money</div></div></div>
<p>California is preparing for a winter COVID-19 surge — if not from the newly identified Omicron variant, then from the Delta variant, which still poses a severe threat and has already caused surges in other states.</p>
<p>It’s still far from clear what kind of increase California will see, and the state has been doing better than other parts of the country. But officials say they want to be ready.</p>
<p>Surge planning is also well underway in Central California, which has recently experienced a reprieve in COVID-19 hospitalizations, falling by nearly 30% since mid-November. </p>
<p>Still, the San Joaquin Valley’s most populous county, Fresno, has a COVID-19 hospitalization rate more than triple that of Los Angeles County, and Fresno officials are expecting the winter surge will again be bad.</p>
<p>If hospitals get extremely busy, they may be forced to implement crisis standards of care, Vohra said, potentially being required to ration healthcare to patients based on who is more likely to survive. </p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Surgeon general warns of emerging youth mental health crisis in rare public advisory</a> </p></div>
<p>The advisory is to call attention to a “youth mental health crisis” and recommend resources to call on and actions to take. </p>
<a>suspecting</a> that an uptick in locally reported cases late last week may be the initial sign of an increase in transmission related to Thanksgiving.
<p>“Rises like these after holidays are not unexpected,” Dr. Cameron Kaiser, a San Diego County deputy public health officer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>People should also consider testing more frequently, given the wide availability of coronavirus testing by healthcare providers as well as rapid tests that can be purchased at a pharmacy and taken anywhere, with results available in 15 minutes.</p>
<p>“We should be cautious — as cautious as we can be while we’re getting more information about Omicron. But I also want to note: Delta [is still] highly infectious,” Ferrer said. </p>
<p>While vaccinations lower the risk of infection and severe disease, it is still possible for fully vaccinated people to get infected and transmit the virus to other people.</p>
<p>“And when we travel, we need to be more careful. And we need to test, test, test,” Chinsio-Kwong said. </p>
<a>says.</a> Free testing sites can be found at the state’s website,
<a>Orange County</a> will begin offering free testing kits to incoming airline passengers at John Wayne Airport, where they can send their sample by FedEx to be analyzed. Orange County also allows residents and people who work there to
<a>request</a> free tests online, which come with prepaid return shipping.
<p>In Los Angeles, a coronavirus testing site has reopened at Dodger Stadium. </p>
<p>People must isolate for at least 10 days since symptoms first appeared or, if they were not symptomatic, 10 days after the date of their first positive coronavirus test. </p>
<p>There are several signs of progress in the fight against COVID-19. </p>
<p>Health officials across California are reporting an uptick in interest in vaccinations, including among young children, as well as booster shots.</p>
<p>For every 100,000 residents, Fresno County has 20 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while Los Angeles County has 6 and Orange and Ventura counties have 5. The San Francisco Bay Area has a rate of 4.</p>
<p>Other counties in Southern California have higher hospitalization rates. San Diego County has a rate of 9; Riverside County, 10; and San Bernardino County, 16. Some experts say it’s a sign of concern when the rate is 5 or worse.</p>
<p>Most of California’s counties are reporting substantial or high coronavirus transmission, the worst two levels of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s <a>four-tier scale.</a></p>

<h1> Judge blocks Biden’s vaccine mandate for federal contractors </h1>
<div><div> By GEOFF MULVIHILL and DAVID A. LIEB </div><div>Associated Press</div></div>
<p>U.S. District Judge R. Stan Baker, in Augusta, Ga., issued a stay to bar enforcement of the mandate nationwide.</p>
<p>Baker found that the states are likely to succeed in their claim that Biden exceeded authorization from Congress when he issued the requirement in September.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Kentucky also had issued a preliminary injunction against the mandate last week, but it applied only to contractors in three states that had sued together — Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee.</p>
<p>Limited exceptions were allowed for medical or religious reasons. The requirements would apply to millions of employees of federal contractors, which include defense contractors and airlines.</p>
<p>Separately, Biden has imposed vaccine requirements for employees of the federal government and the military.</p>
<p>The mandates are a key part of the administration’s strategy to stop the spread of COVID-19, which has killed more than 788,000 Americans since last year.</p>
<p>The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.</p>

<h1> 34,000 L.A. Unified students have not complied with vaccine mandate, signaling problems ahead </h1>
<div><div> By Howard BlumeStaff Writer </div></div>
<a>staffing shortages and confusion</a> after it was inundated at the start of the school year with about 10,000 students, a number that grew to 16,000. The 34,000 total by itself would make up one of the 25 largest school systems in California.
<p>There’s no indication that L.A. Unified is backing down — with no leniency or extended deadlines under public discussion.</p>
<a>employee mandate</a> has already taken effect, with
<a>relatively modest disruption</a>, because an overwhelming majority of workers complied. Employees could request an exemption for personal beliefs; students will not have that option.
<p>All the same, she said, “What’s the Plan B?”</p>
<p>“Do we have a hard deadline as to when we’re going to get answers on this?” an administrator asked senior district managers. “When are we going to know, respectfully?”</p>
