<p>But Marshall said that was wrong: “In fact, none of these cases had so far been processed at all.”</p>
<p>Marshall estimated that up to 150,000 people applied for evacuation, but that fewer than 5% of those got any assistance. He added: “It is clear that some of those left behind have since been murdered by the Taliban.”</p>
<p>The inbox was also at one point temporarily locked, which Marshall believes was evidence that the initial process was merely “a public relations purpose”.</p>
<h2>Evacuees prioritised without consistency</h2>
<p>Those picked were then added to a spreadsheet; however, Marshall said, the summaries of people’s cases were “inconsistent and likely often misleading”.</p>
<p>A second spreadsheet was then created on which a single senior civil servant narrowed down further the people to prioritise. “There was therefore no effective review of these decisions,” Marshall said.</p>
<h2>Lack of staff, experience and equipment</h2>
<p>Despite the gravity of the situation, Marshall said, the default expectation remained that FCDO staff would continue to work normal hours, and only be asked to do extra shifts.</p>
<h2>Poor integration between departments</h2>
<p>The night before the mass list was sent, a shorter list of “very high priority cases” was sent over. But Marshall said that when he checked on its progress 24 hours later, he discovered it had been “lost somewhere”.</p>
<p>When soldiers were drafted in to fill shifts civil servants could only be requested to fill, Marshall said their MoD clearance was not recognised by the FCDO, so they “had to be escorted” to “guard against potential espionage”.</p>
<h2>PM’s push to evacuate animals at ‘direct expense’ of those at risk of murder</h2>
<p>The fact that Nowzad said it could charter a plane itself was irrelevant, because British soldiers would have to spend time escorting the animals instead of human beings and there was limited capacity at the airport, he concluded.</p>
<p>Marshall believed the government “transported animals which were not at risk of harm at the direct expense of evacuating British nationals and people at risk of imminent murder, including interpreters who had served with the British Army”.</p>

<p>Psychiatrists are warning of a surprise rise in problem gambling among the over-65s after the largest increase in online betting since before the pandemic was recorded among the age group.</p>
<p>About 620,000 more over-65s are gambling online at least once a month than in 2019 – a bigger increase than any other age group, according to analysis of <a>Gambling</a> Commission data by the Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP).</p>
<p>“Not everyone who gambles will develop a gambling disorder, but some will. Gambling disorder is an illness and if left untreated can lead to significant depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts.”</p>
<a>The risk of addiction</a> is higher with online gambling because of its greater accessibility and lower restrictions on stakes and speed, said Matt Zarb-Cousin, the director of Clean Up Gambling, a group campaigning for industry reform.
<a>Limits of £2 a spin</a> have been placed on fixed-odds betting terminals in bookmakers, but not on slot games online where gamblers can place a bet and spin again every 2.5 seconds.
<p>The surge in senior online gambling was the sharpest rise of any age group. Next came 45- to 54-year-olds with an increase of about 340,000 online gamblers over the course of the pandemic so far.</p>
<p>The figures mean counsellors are braced for an increase in older people needing treatment for gambling disorders.</p>
<p>Women also increased their online gambling activity during the pandemic, with the proportion of the female population gambling online rising from 13.2% to 16.2%, while levels of male online gambling stayed roughly stable.</p>

<p>From gynaecological conditions to healthy ageing, these are expected to be the priorities of the final plan</p>
<p>A vision document on a strategy for women’s health in England will be published by the Department of <a>Health</a> and Social Care on Thursday after nearly 100,000 women came forward to share their healthcare experiences.</p>
<a>initial government commitments</a> on women’s health, recognising that system-wide changes are needed to tackle “decades of gender health inequality”. The final plan – the Women’s Health Strategy – will be published in the spring.
<p>The Women’s Health Strategy is expected to include a focus on six key areas, the Guardian has learned. These “priority areas” relate to specific conditions or areas of health where the public consultation highlighted particular issues.</p>
<h2>Menstrual health and gynaecological conditions</h2>
<p>In the consultation, menstrual health was the topic most chosen by respondents aged 16-17 for inclusion in the Women’s Health Strategy, and gynaecological conditions was the No 1 topic selected by those aged 18-29.</p>
<h2>Fertility, pregnancy, pregnancy loss and postnatal support</h2>
<p>The menopause was the most selected topic for women aged 40-59.</p>
<h2>Healthy ageing and long-term conditions</h2>
<p>Healthy ageing was the top topic for women aged 60 and over. Women also said that they would like the Women’s Health Strategy to cover long-term conditions such as musculoskeletal conditions, heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Mental health was in the top five most popular topics selected by women for inclusion in the Women’s Health Strategy, and was consistent across every age group.</p>
<h2>The health impact of violence against women and girls</h2>
<p>Women told the consultation that the effects of domestic abuse and violence on women’s health were wide ranging and extensive, and had a long-term effect on their physical and mental health.</p>

<p>Ratnaboli Ray regards one of the lowest points of her life as a breakthrough. After years in an arranged marriage in which she felt stifled and trapped, her mental health took a catastrophic turn in 1997, when she was in her mid-30s.</p>
<p>In her previous role, she had seen some of what patients experienced in government-run mental health facilities, where care was much worse than the kind she received in a private facility, and decided she wanted to do something about it. </p>

<p>“Like everyone that suffers with depression, you don’t get one bout of it. It comes and goes. For me, it started around 2002 I think. I went down fairly quickly and I couldn’t understand it.”</p>

<p>The terrorism threat to the UK may have been made worse by Covid lockdowns, a security minister has suggested.</p>
<p>Damian Hinds, the MP for East Hampshire who became security minister in August, told the Daily Telegraph that people spending long periods of time in their bedrooms during the restrictions could have pushed them towards radicalisation.</p>
<p>His remarks echo similar warnings from the police and the UN’s counter-terrorism committee executive directorate (CTED).</p>
<p>“Clearly, logically, when you have more people who are spending more time in their bedrooms at their computer … you are going to get a growth in that tiny proportion of people for whom that is a dark journey,” Hinds told the Telegraph.</p>
<p>“And as you know, on the internet, if you start to make those kind of downward spirals, you can quickly accelerate with the material that you come across and the other people that you can come into contact with.”</p>
<p>Since Hinds took on the brief, there have been two alleged terrorist attacks, the <a>killing of the MP Sir David Amess</a> and the <a>attack outside Liverpool Women’s hospital</a>.</p>
<p>“Islamist extremism terrorism, though, remains a potent threat. And we also have quite a few people who you might describe as having a sort of mixed or unclear or unstable mindset.</p>
<p>“Sometimes [they are] looking at flirting with different ideologies, different groups, sometimes apparently mutually exclusive, very, very different types of ideology.”</p>

<a>UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world</a>, with once-common creatures, such as hedgehogs, red squirrels and sparrows now critically endangered, and huge reductions in the abundance of wildlife across the board.
<p>Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said it was fantastic that the public wanted to support its work to reverse wildlife declines and address the climate emergency.</p>
<p>He warned that parts of the government’s agenda, such as weakening habitat regulations that protect wildlife and planning rules, threatened to undermine work for nature.</p>
<p>“The government needs to invest far more in nature – we know that more than £1bn annually is needed to create and restore wild places,” he said.</p>
<p>Broadcaster and biologist Liz Bonnin, president of the Wildlife Trusts, said it was an astonishing sum of money to raise in such a short time.</p>
<p>“Together, we can bring nature back – and we can do it at the scale needed to address our biodiversity and climate crises. Time to roll up our sleeves and get the job done!”, she said.</p>

<a>the world’s biggest fish and chip shop, Papa’s</a>. Lunch is haddock (from £8.99 with chips) in crispy batter, light as tempura, and a Hull pattie (£1.89) that tastes like battered sage and onion stuffing.
<a>Cleethorpes pier</a> has suffered fires, failed takeovers and partial demolition during the second world war; it has hosted nightclubs, bingo and wrestling. A local consortium restored its wooden walkways and stained glass six years ago and
<a>Ross Castle</a>, and couples drinking on the mellow terrace behind
<a>Corks 28</a>, just off thriving Sea View Street. Even the starlings are having a good time, chittering on the pier before swirling, splitting and combining again to settle on the ferris wheel.
<a>Cleethorpes Coast Light Railway</a> from the nearby leisure centre to its main lakeside station (£4.50 return), where a popular beer garden surrounds the tiny
<a>Greenwich Meridian Line</a>, slanting over the tarmac so that visitors can stand with a foot in each hemisphere near a signpost showing distances to Moscow, New York and London.

<a>French Revolution</a>, Notre Dame was so desecrated and neglected that it came close to demolition. Salvation came in the form of a novel, Victor Hugo’s
<a>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a>, which was so popular that its champion Eugène Viollet-le-Duc was able to rescue and restore the cathedral in 1844.
<a>Washington Monument</a>. The cathedral survived 18 direct hits by British and American bombs in the second world war.
<p>Inside, the greatest treasure is a casket of the supposed skulls of the Three Kings, donated by Holy Roman emperor Barbarossa. The casket reliquary is of gold and set with 1,000 precious stones.</p>

<a>Fort Bovisand</a>, the art deco

<p>Average UK house prices defied expectations and continued to climb last month despite the phasing out of the government’s <a>stamp duty holiday</a> at the end of September.</p>
<p>The continued increases mean that the price of an average home in the UK has risen above £250,000 for the first time on the building society Nationwide’s index.</p>
<a>Office for National Statistics</a> based on mortgage completions
<a>put the average price at £264,000 in August</a>, while the Halifax building society suggested the milestone was passed in October 2020.
<p>Meanwhile, year-on-year property price inflation remained at the high level of 9.9% last month, only just below the 10% level recorded in September.</p>
<p>The threshold for paying stamp duty was lowered from £500,000 to £250,000 in July, before the tax break came to an end in September.</p>
<p>There had been expectations that demand for house purchases would slow after the threshold for paying stamp duty was lowered from £500,000 to £250,000 in July, and the tax break then came to an end in September.</p>
<p>However, it is unclear whether house prices will continue to rise in the coming months and Gardner called the outlook for the housing market “extremely uncertain”.</p>
<p>Further property price inflation is dependent on a range of factors, including interest rates, consumer confidence and employment levels after the end of government pandemic support measures including the <a>furlough scheme</a>.</p>
<a>interest rate</a> rises could cool the market.
<p>The Bank of England will <a>reveal its latest interest rate decision</a> on Thursday. Financial markets are betting on a rate rise, as a result of rising inflation, although most City economists expect rates to remain at record lows for the moment.</p>
<p>Any rate rises over the coming months are forecast to be gradual and are not expected to have a strong impact on UK borrowers.</p>
<p>The return of the international super-rich to <a>London</a> amid the easing of coronavirus pandemic restrictions has fuelled the highest annual growth in property prices in the capital’s most expensive district since 2015.</p>
<p>Average home prices in “prime central London” – which stretches from Chelsea to Camden and Notting Hill to Westminster – have risen by 1.1% since the start of the year, according to research by the estate agent Knight Frank.</p>
<p>It said prices had risen consecutively each month for the past six months “something last achieved before the Brexit referendum in 2016”.</p>
<p>Tom Bill, Knight Frank’s head of UK research, said the jump in demand for luxury London housing was mostly being driven by the return of rich overseas buyers as coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions lift.</p>
<p>“There is a sense that buyers who put everything on hold, are coming back on the path to buying.”</p>
<p>The number of new prospective buyers registering in London in October was 56% higher than the same month a year earlier.</p>
<p>Rupert des Forges, Knight Frank’s head of prime central London developments, said: “The pandemic has not altered London’s status as a global safe haven.”</p>
<p>He said members of the international jet-set elite were buying new-build properties as well as characterful older houses. “West End developers have received over £250m of offers in the W1 postcode alone in the last month,” he said.</p>
<p>The agents said rich people’s desire to “escape to the country” during the height of the pandemic had “left some central London bargains in its wake” which were now being picked up.</p>
<p>Last summer agents reported <a>surging sales of remote vast country estates and former castle properties</a>, which until Covid-19 struck had become increasingly hard to shift.</p>
<p>Savills, which has 320 staff in a unit dedicated to such estates, said it had sold 21 estates valued at £15m-plus in a nine-month period. For comparison, just one such property sold in the whole of 2019.</p>
<p>Halifax said the average cost of a home rose by 0.9% on the previous month, <a>after rising by 1.7% in September</a>, adding more than £2,500 to the value of a typical British home.</p>
<p>It pointed to several market drivers, including first-time buyers supported by help with deposits from their parents, improved access to mortgage deals and low borrowing costs.</p>
<p>House price growth continue to remain strong despite the phasing out of the government’s stamp duty holiday at the end of September. The annual rate of house price inflation – 8.1% compared to the same month last year – was the strongest since June.</p>
<p>Wales continues to experience the strongest house price inflation in any UK nation or region, climbing 12.9% in October to an average of £198,880. The average price of a property in Scotland rose 8.6% year-on-year to £190,000.</p>
<p>In England, the north-west has returned to being the strongest-performing region, overtaking the south-west, with a rise of 10.4% – the highest rise for four months – and an average price of £205,881.</p>
<p>London continues to show the weakest growth: house prices rose just 0.8%, a fall from 1% in September, the lowest level seen since February 2020.</p>
<p>The property firm Savills said it expected prices to rise across Great Britain and revised its forecast for the next five years upwards.</p>
<p>Over the past 16 months, prices have risen in all areas of Great Britain. However, the biggest increases have been in markets outside London.</p>
<p>Over the next five years the company said it expected prices to rise by 18.8% in both regions, while in London they would go up by 5.6%.</p>
<p>“Given where we are in the housing market cycle, the north-south divide in house prices looks set to close further over the next five years,” said Lawrence Bowles, a director of residential research at Savills.</p>
<p>“There remains more of an affordability cushion beyond London and the south. The government’s levelling-up agenda has the potential to accelerate a rebalancing of the market but only if it gains meaningful traction.”</p>
<p>However, despite the big rises in the north-west and Yorkshire and the Humber, the price gap between homes there and in London will remain huge.</p>
<p>By the end of 2026, Savills expects homes to cost an average of £272,732 in the north-west and £266,417 in Yorkshire compared with £713,987 in London.</p>
<p>Since the lockdown on the housing market was eased in early summer 2020, prices have risen sharply, fuelled by stamp duty holidays, lifestyle changes and record low mortgage rates.</p>
<p>In recent weeks many of the cheapest mortgages <a>have been taken off the shelves</a> in anticipation of the rise in the Bank of England base rate as policymakers take action against inflation.</p>
<p>Rules on lending mean that banks and building societies must stress-test borrowers before advancing mortgages and only allow them to borrow sums they can afford to repay if interest rates are high.</p>
<p>New <a>mortgage lending rules</a> will do little to curb Australia’s runaway property market, regulators have admitted.</p>
<p>Stricter standards on households’ ability to pay back loans will have only a “fairly modest” impact on prices, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority executive director of policy, Renée Roberts, said on Monday.</p>
<a>increases of 22% expected by the year’s end</a>. But they
<a>are then tipped to flatten</a>, with markets expecting interest rate rises sooner than the guidance of 2024 provided by the Reserve Bank of Australia.
<p>According to market analysts CoreLogic, Australia’s housing auction market experienced its second busiest week of the year, with 3,562 homes going under the hammer, up 8.2% from the previous week.</p>
<p>Clearance rates are down due to increased supply, with 75.5% of sales successful, down from a peek of 84.4% in early October.</p>
<p>In October Apra told mortgage lenders to ensure that borrowers could continue to repay their current interest rate with a buffer of 3% for further increases, up from the previous test of 2.5%.</p>
<p>On Monday Roberts told the lower house standing committee on tax and revenue that Apra doesn’t “target house prices or matters of affordability” but is concerned with financial stability and ensuring households are able to make mortgage repayments.</p>
<p>Roberts said the aggregate impact of the new lending rules on prices will be “fairly modest” as many people don’t borrow at their full capacity.</p>
<p>Gideon Holland, Apra’s general manager of policy, said Australia’s financial system could withstand a decrease in house prices provided borrowers stayed in work and were able to service their loans.</p>
<p>Apra was not concerned about house prices “in and of themselves” but when a drop in prices coincided “with poorer economic conditions” including higher unemployment, he said.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank assistant governor, Luci Ellis, told the inquiry she accepts that low interest rates have contributed to house prices and “at some level that is our doing”.</p>
<p>But, Ellis said low interest rates and low inflation were preferable to higher inflation, which would cause Australia to have difficulty attracting investment.</p>
<p>Asked about the impact of housing prices on inequality, Ellis conceded it is a “legitimate concern” and there is an “intergenerational issue” because people whose parents rent have much greater <a>difficulty owning their own home.</a></p>
<p>Liberal chair of the committee, Jason Falinski, prosecuted the argument that increasing land supply and decreasing the constraints of planning laws would boost construction and lower prices.</p>
<p>Ellis countered that the supply of well-located land, near jobs and amenities, is constrained in coastal cities, particularly in Sydney.</p>
<p>The RBA has <a>kept interest rates at a record 0.1%</a> and has said it won’t lift them until inflation is “sustainably” within its 2% to 3% target range.</p>
<p>But borrowers are <a>rushing to lock in low interest rates</a> amid gathering expectations Australia’s central bank will declare an end to its record low cash rate earlier than its current prediction of 2024.</p>
<p>Economists say the RBA has little choice but to revise its rate rise timing given mounting evidence the economy is recovering quickly from the lengthy Covid-triggered lockdowns in NSW, Victoria and the ACT.</p>
<p>In Monday’s hearing, Ellis declined to comment on future interest rate moves, but acknowledged that the market is reflecting its belief the RBA will lift rates sooner than 2024.</p>
<a>London</a> “microflat” has a shower and lavatory separated from the main room by a partition, without even a separate wash basin.
<p>“It’s probably a bit odd, people coming in and seeing your bed in the kitchen, but I’ve just got used to it,” he says. “My neighbours live in a flat similar to mine – a couple with a two-year-old kid. That must be really tough.”</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick moved into the studio, on the ground floor of an old townhouse converted into 10 flats, in May 2018 because he was fed up with living in a house share, and liked the area.</p>
<blockquote><div> <p>The flat was refurbished but there are annoying things – I have to keep moving my bike around to get to the fridge,” he says.</p> </div></blockquote>
<p>“I have to sleep with earplugs because the boiler is right above my bed and the fridge is also making noises all night. And my sink is my kitchen sink – that’s where I wash up and shave and do my teeth.”</p>
<p>The government has recommended a <a> minimum space standard of 37 sq m</a> since 2015, although it is not mandatory – local authorities have discretion to apply it or not.</p>
<a>for example at Templefields House in Harlow, where some measure just 18 sq m</a>.
<p>If they take off, Barratt plans to roll them out across the UK. A buyer taking advantage of the government’s help-to-buy programme, which runs until March 2023, would need to earn about £40,000 a year to buy a one-bed flat.</p>
<p>The flats start at £285,000, significantly cheaper than the average £321,988 price for homes sold in Harrow in the past 12 months tracked by Rightmove, and the average house price of £510,515 in Greater London, according to Halifax.</p>
<p>However, when compared with Barratt’s standard one-bed apartments measuring 50 sq m, they cost about £1,000 more per square metre.</p>
<a>Pocket Living was set up in 2005 to build flats</a> sized 37-38 sq m and sells them at a 20% discount to the average local market rate to help young, middle-earning Londoners buy their first home.

<p>Nationwide Building Society has said there could be a “cooling” of the UK’s red-hot housing market because of rising inflation and interest rates.</p>
<p>Robert Gardner, the chief economist at the UK’s second-largest mortgage lender, said the housing market is currently “remarkably robust” despite the end of incentives such as the government’s stamp duty holiday at the end of September.</p>
<p>However, he said that in the coming months a lot would depend on the performance of the wider economy.</p>
<p>“There are a few things that could moderate [housing demand] a bit in the coming quarters. For example, there are not many homes on the market at the moment. That is likely to hold back activity.</p>
<p>“If you look at rising inflation squeezing household budgets a little and if interest rates rise, then that is likely to exert a cooling influence as well. But if the recovery holds up, then activity is likely to remain pretty solid.”</p>
<p>Last month the Bank’s chief economist, Huw Pill, said he <a>expected to see inflation top 5% by early next year</a>.</p>
<p>Joe Garner, Nationwide’s chief executive, said its policy of allowing its 13,000 office-based staff <a>to work from anywhere in the UK</a> was faring “tremendously well”.</p>
<p>He said: “We continue to see enhanced productivity. The area we are paying careful attention to is how to build culture and cohesion [with staff remote working].”</p>
