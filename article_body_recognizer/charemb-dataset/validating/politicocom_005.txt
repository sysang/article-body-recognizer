<p><b>Friday’s question — the last of 2021: </b>How many times did the word “recovery” appear in Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s fiscal update this week? (Hint: If you can’t wait until January, refer back to Wednesday's Playbook.) </p>
<p><i>Playbook wouldn’t happen without <a>Luiza Ch. Savage</a>, <a>editor Sue Allan</a>, <a>Zi-Ann Lum</a> and <a>Andy Blatchford.</a></i></p>

<b>WELCOME TO OTTAWA PLAYBOOK. I'm your host, Nick Taylor-Vaisey.</b>
<p>The Playbook team wants to thank every reader for making Playbook part of your (early) morning routine — Hill insiders, politics junkies and casual observers alike. We read all the feedback. We love how the community grows and grows and grows. </p>
<p>We're signing off until Jan. 3. See you bright and early in 2022. </p>
<b>FIRST THING — </b>Government House Leader
<b>MARK HOLLAND</b>'s task sounded monumental. Take four election priorities and turn them into law. As former NDP House leader
<b>LIBBY DAVIES</b> told Playbook in November, Holland's success depended on his personal relationships with opposition House leaders.
<b>— Rewind:</b> Let's turn back the clock to August, when Prime Minister
<b>JUSTIN TRUDEAU</b> called an election. After securing a third term in the September vote but failing to nab a second majority, the Liberals waited more than a month to shuffle Cabinet — and almost
<i>another</i> month to recall Parliament. That left less than a month to force through a truncated legislative agenda at relative hyperspeed.
<p>Holland thanked his fellow House leaders for their "wonderful spirit of cooperation."</p>
<p>On the only legislation that came to a vote, <b>CHRYSTIA FREELAND</b>'s Covid recovery bill, Holland found a dance partner in the Bloc Québécois.</p>
<u>defending her C$7-billion bill</u>
<p><b>WHO HAS FREELAND’S EAR —</b> Deputy Prime Minister Freeland<b> </b>shared a glimpse of who she consults in her day-to-day while appearing in the Senate in her other role as finance minister of Canada.</p>
<p><b>ANDY BLATCHFORD </b>was watching:</p>
<p>Freeland dropped names after being pressed by Conservative Sen. <b>LEO HOUSAKOS</b> to explain whether she’s been snubbing top department officials.</p>
<a><u>Globe and Mail story</u></a> that reported, citing unnamed sources, that Freeland rarely takes department briefings and had not spoken to some of her assistant deputy ministers for months.
<b>MICHAEL SABIA</b>. She said she connects with Sabia by phone “four, five, maybe six times a day — some days more than that.” She stressed she works very closely with many other officials at Finance, including the department’s No. 2
<p>Freeland said she has no fewer than a half-dozen conversations with departmental officials every day, including weekends, early mornings and evenings. She said she often asks for briefing notes.</p>
<p>“I have never been a person who believes that Ottawa has a monopoly on good ideas,” she said.</p>
<b>RONA AMBROSE</b> and former Bank of Canada governor
<b>STEPHEN POLOZ</b>. She said she consults Poloz “pretty often.”
<b>OLAF SCHOLZ</b> became Germany’s chancellor, she had “very good conversations” with him in Washington. She said she has also spent a lot of time talking with U.S. Treasury Secretary
<p><b>CURSE ON CHRYSTIA —</b> Our friends at the Curse of Politics podcast had choice words for Minister Freeland in the aftermath of her <a><u>post-fiscal update interview on CTV's Power Play</u></a>. </p>
<p>We pulled some key quotes from <b>DAVID HERLE</b>, <b>JENNI BYRNE</b> and <b>SCOTT REID</b> on this week's episode (<a><u>which you can find here</u></a>).</p>
<p><b>REID:</b> Her manner seemed agitated. She seemed frustrated with Evan that she was having to explain herself. She wanted to take control of the interview instead of having a conversation. Possibly just as important, there was no message there.</p>
<p>She can't afford to <i>not</i> be better than she was — she has to be one of the government's most capable and effective communicators.</p>
<p>— For another take from another panel, here’s <a><u>CBC’s At Issue</u></a>.</p>
<b>PRAISE THE LORD —</b> Mandate letters
<u>dropped Thursday afternoon</u>
<b>— Something old, something new:</b> The
<a><u>Liberal election platform</u></a> naturally drops an awful lot of hints. But there's new stuff in the mandate letters, too. Take
<b>DOMINIC LEBLANC</b>, whose job includes improving leaders' debates "to ensure that they better serve the public interest."
<p>Government House Leader <b>MARK HOLLAND</b> was tasked with another priority nowhere to be found in the platform: "promoting free votes" that allow Liberal MPs to deviate from the government position.</p>
<p>POLITICO's Canada team pulled out <a><u>all the biggest mandate letter priorities for Pro subscribers</u></a>. Here are three highlights:</p>
<a><u>Coalition for a Better Future</u></a> that boasted in a missive to members that it has met with the PMO, Privy Council Office and Department of Finance.
<b>MELANIE JOLY</b>'s letter and came away disappointed. China merits zero mentions, though Joly will lead a "
<a><u>comprehensive Indo-Pacific strategy</u></a> to deepen diplomatic, economic and defence partnerships and international assistance in the region.”
<p>— Remember Bill C-10, the failed attempt to reform the Broadcasting Act that riled free-speech defenders before the election? It's Heritage Minister <b>PABLO RODRIGUEZ</b>'s job to <a><u>see that through once and for all</u></a>. Prepare for battle.</p>
<a><u>applies a Prairies lens</u></a>. CTV's
<a><u>her own Ctrl-F test</u></a>. ATIP guru
<a><u>disappearance of access-to-information</u></a> from the agenda.
<b>THE GREEN GIANTS </b>— Trudeau’s mandate letters give us a clearer look at how responsibilities will be split to implement the government’s ambitious climate agenda. For the first time, the environment minister (ATTN:
<b>STEVEN GUILBEAULT</b>) is the lead on driving the climate plan.
<p>Here’s <b>ZI-ANN’s</b> take: </p>
<p>There’s additional info on <a><u>Guilbeault’s long list of to-dos</u></a> and clarity on who he will partner with on key campaign promises.</p>
<b>— On the docket:</b> working with Natural Resources Minister
<b>JONATHAN WILKINSON</b> to cap oil and gas emissions at current levels; collaborating with Innovation Minister
<b>FRANÇOIS-PHILIPPE CHAMPAGNE</b> to create a new C$100-million fund to seed “made-in-Canada technologies and solutions for the reuse and recycling of plastics;”and partnering with Finance Minister
<b>FREELAND</b> to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies by 2023.

<a>In a speech</a> at Universitas Indonesia, Blinken said defense of the “rules-based order” required regional states to oppose Chinese depredations. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson

<p><span><b>ANOTHER GROUNDHOG YEAR? — </b></span>As we head into the second holiday season shadowed by the pandemic, the new year might feel like a repeat of 2021. </p>
<p>“No cuddling the grandkids beneath the Christmas tree,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Tuesday, as he extended Covid-19 restrictions until mid-January in fear of the Omicron march across Europe.</p>
<p>So, how much will 2022 be like 2021? Five global health experts say these are the top issues to watch for soon after the New Year bubbly has worn off:</p>
<p>The global vaccine equity effort COVAX is ending the year with some 800 million vaccines delivered and hopes to have at least 1 billion more by March to distribute. That number is well below the initial target: access to 2 billion shots by now. </p>
<p><b>Defining full vaccination: </b>Plus, the looming question is whether the definition of being fully vaccinated will change from having had two doses to three.</p>
<i>. </i>“Clearly, vaccinating 70 percent of the world means three doses for every person in the world,” Gostin said.
<p><span><b>WELCOME BACK TO GLOBAL PULSE</b>,</span> where your host is saddened, but not surprised, that her early 2021 hope of Global Pulse becoming by now less about Covid-19 and more about learning and rebuilding from the pandemic didn’t pan out.</p>
<p><b>Programming note:</b> Global Pulse won’t publish Dec. 23 and 30. We’ll be back in your inboxes on Thursday, Jan. 6.</p>
<p><span><b>THE POST-PANDEMIC GLOBAL HEALTH ARCHITECTURE — </b></span>While it will likely take years for countries to agree on a pandemic preparedness deal after the decision last month to negotiate one, 2022 will give us some direction. </p>
<p><b>The FIF’s make-or-break moment: </b>Meanwhile, the U.S. has been pushing for the creation of a $10-billion-a-year worldwide fund for pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>“Next year is the year where it has to happen or it will never happen because all of our experience shows that political will is at its highest in a crisis,” Gostin said.</p>
<p><span><b>STICKING TO A FAMILIAR FACE —</b></span><b> </b>Other things beyond the pandemic response might look the same in 2022. For instance, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO director-general, will likely sail to a second five-year term.</p>
<p>While Georgetown University’s Gostin thinks an uncontested election harms the WHO, other global health experts who spoke to Global Pulse said continuity is key to managing a pandemic.</p>
<p>“And I think it’s also important to see if [the WHO] will be successful in their advocacy for more funding,” she said.</p>
<p>A working group this week recommended that mandatory contributions increase to 50 percent of the WHO’s base budget by 2028, but it’s uncertain whether countries would agree.</p>

<p><b>COOKING OIL IS A HOT CLIMATE SOLUTION — </b>Fuels made from plant and animal waste are in hot demand as companies that operate planes, trucks, trains and ships look for ways to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. </p>
<p>Congress is considering giving extra tax credits to one sector in particular: sustainable aviation fuel. The proposal in Democrats’ Build Back Better Act is raising questions about whether there will be enough fats, oils and greases to go around. </p>
<p><b>There is no clear-cut answer and a lot of uncertainty, </b>according to <b>Prashant Rao</b>, Citigroup’s director of biofuels equity research. The main concern is how fast new renewable diesel and SAF projects come online. </p>
<p>“Can the feedstock market keep pace with the amount of projects that have been announced? Rao said. “As with any large energy project, there is also the risk that some don’t get completed.” </p>
<p><b>Kim Carnahan</b>, senior director of net-zero fuels at sustainability consulting firm ENGIE Impact, had a different assessment. There is a limited supply of feedstocks, but it will be a decade or more before that market is saturated, she said. </p>
<p>By then, road transport could be moving toward electrification or other technologies like hydrogen fuel, said Carnahan, who also manages the <a>Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance</a>, which is creating a new carbon accounting system for SAF.</p>
<p>The sweetener is larger than the $1-per-gallon tax credit for bio-based diesel, which Build Back Better would extend for another five years.</p>
<b>David Fialkov</b>, a lobbyist for the National Association of Truck Stop Operators and Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America.
