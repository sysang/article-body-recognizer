<p>“It will be hard to live up to the expectations of everybody,” Walker said. “I can only promise that I will do my best.”</p>
<p>Attaway called Lucas “a damned liar.” He said Black people were calling him “scum” and his deputies “trash.” Attaway dismissed the protesters as “outside agitators.”</p>

<p>“Herschel Walker notwithstanding,” <a>Wilson said, “this is one of the most racist places in Georgia.”</a></p>

<i>Atlanta Constitution</i> put it. “Coretta King and Jesse Jackson were calling Herschel,”
<a>Gary Smith wrote in the fall of 1981 in <i>Inside Sports</i></a>, “trying to get him to take a stand.” (A spokesperson for Jackson confirmed this to me.)
<p>Hurt as he was, Walker’s stance came as a comfort to many in the white community who lauded his choice.</p>
<p>“He had a future, a bright future,” Curtis Dixon, who was a black assistant football coach, told me, “and he didn’t want to mess it up.”</p>
<p>“The family was focused on other things,” Phillips said of the Walkers. “They were not going to get embroiled in that.”</p>
<p>“He was all about the hate,” Caneega, who taught Walker geometry, said of E.J. Wilson, the Black pastor who was one of the leaders of the protests. “And I can’t see that he would have ever been interested in Herschel other than using him.”</p>
<p>She added: “I don’t think he backed away. I think he just navigated it in a very wise and thoughtful way.”</p>
<p>White people in Wrightsville, Williams said, had made Walker an “Uncle Tom.”</p>
<p>“What Herschel Walker doesn’t understand is that when he stops carrying that football,” Williams said, “he has to return to the Black community.”</p>

<p>“He just had an ability to say the right thing,” <a>Dooley told me recently</a>, “so he never got into any controversy.”</p>
<p>“His humbleness and how he carried himself and what he did for the University of Georgia — I think it changed a lot of people’s minds,” Frank Ros, a white Georgia teammate and one of his best friends, told me.</p>

<p>“Herschel,” said Attaway, “did not get involved in that trouble. He’s a fine young man. And he’s welcome here any time.”</p>
<p>“It’s so strange,” said Herschel Walker.</p>
<a>He even saw, he said, a potential president.</a> Here, though, at his condo, he was with the reporter because the reporter was working on a series of stories for the
<i>Atlanta Constitution</i>. “Run For Respect,” it was called. “A Study of Black Football Players and the South.”
<p>“Some people have said,” Walker said, “they thought Herschel hasn’t overstepped his boundaries in the Black-white issue — ‘he’s a good n-----.’”</p>
<p>He smiled. He looked at his wife.</p>
<p>“They always say the worst thing a Black person can do is marry a white,” Walker said to the reporter. “Did I pay attention to that?”</p>

<a>And he said a little more the same year to a reporter</a> from the

<a>Walker said in his congressional testimony</a> on the issue of reparations. “My approach is Biblical. How can I ask my heavenly father to forgive

<h2>‘The Scientific Community Is Almost Monolithic Against You’: When Dr. Oz Went to the Senate</h2>
<p>The TV doctor's campaign is all the buzz right now. He might not want to talk about it, but he's been there before.</p>
<p> Dr. Mehmet Oz testifies before a Senate subcommittee in June 2014. | Lauren Victoria Burke/AP Photo</p>
<div> <div> <p> By IAN WARD</p> <p><time>12/01/2021 04:31 AM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p><i>Ian Ward is a writer based in Washington, D.C.</i></p>
<p>There was only one problem with the doctor’s plan. Inside the hearing room, the members of the subcommittee had cast him in a different role: not as the victim of scheming fraudsters but as the fraudster himself. </p>
<a>announced</a> that he’s entering Pennsylvania’s GOP primary race for U.S. Senate. Oz — who did not respond to a request to comment for this article — joins a field that’s been left wide open by the
<a>departure</a> of Sean Parnell, an early Donald Trump-endorsed frontrunner who suspended his campaign in late November after losing a high-profile custody battle with his ex-wife.
<a>Kanye West</a> — Oz’s long and lucrative career as an advocate for alternative medicine, essentially one long campaign against the medical establishment by a man with his own media empire and an "M.D." after his name,
<i>sic</i>], I feel like I’ve been disenfranchised, like my power’s been taken away,” said Oz. “You don’t want to be on a pulpit talking about how passionate you are about life and thinking, ‘Well, if I use that word it’s going to be quoted back to me.’”
<p>Oz was one of six experts invited by the subcommittee to testify during the hearing, but once all the experts had delivered their prepared testimony, the members’ attention fell squarely on Oz, by far the most famous person in the room that day. </p>
<p>“There’s not a pill that's going to help you, long-term, lose weight, live the best life without diet and exercise,” Oz responded. </p>
<p>“Do you believe there’s a magic weight-loss cure out there?” said Heller. </p>
<p>Oz stammered. “If you’re selling something because it’s magical, no,” he said. “If you’re arguing that it’s going to be magic because if you stop eating carbohydrates you’re going to use a lot of weight, that’s a truthful statement.” </p>
<b> </b>— disclaiming "magical" while defending "it's going to be magic" —
<b> </b>are a common feature of deceptive advertising in the weight-loss industry. And despite Oz's careful parsing of claims like that,
<b> </b>several of his hearing statements
<b> </b>ran afoul of both scientific and regulatory consensus, said Eisenberg. In his written testimony, says Eisenberg,
<b> </b>Oz clearly violated the Federal Trade Commission’s guidance to dietary supplement companies when he referred to a pill’s ability to “melt” fat.
<p>“The scientific consensus is that pills cannot do that, and the regulatory consensus is [the same],” said Eisenberg. “The FTC has said no product can say in their advertisement that a product burns or melts fat.”</p>
<a>agreed</a> to pay a $5.25 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit alleging that he misrepresented the efficacy of two weight-loss pills, which he had referred to on his show as a “revolutionary fat buster” and “magic weight-loss cure.”
<p>“Yes, prayer is free,” said Oz. “That’s a very good point.”</p>
<i>New York Times </i>bestsellers —
<p>Despite the subcommittee’s focus on diet supplements, the hearing got at something deeper about what Oz’s real product is: not weight-loss pills at all, but rather the promise of an alternative reality.</p>
<p>Oz hasn’t yet offered a policy prescription for relighting the nation’s divine spark.</p>

<h2>A flood of climate aid is coming from Washington. Will those who need it miss out?</h2>
<p>Advocates for communities seeking a piece of the hundreds of billions of dollars in new assistance worry that the process may be "too weighty, too heavy and too full of bureaucracy." </p>

<div> <div> <p> By ZACK COLMAN</p> <p><time>12/23/2021 03:11 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>Washington is providing hundreds of billions of dollars to develop clean energy, eliminate contaminated drinking water and help communities withstand floods, storms and other calamities driven by climate change.</p>
<p>Many supporters’ big fear: Those who most need the cash will be unable to navigate the federal bureaucracy<b> </b>required to obtain it.</p>
<p>And some have already hit a brick wall.</p>
<b> </b>said his government spent $30,000
<b> </b>in 2020 hiring an outside engineer to assist in writing a grant proposal for a Federal Emergency Management Agency program
<p>"We applied and of course we were rejected," Craft told POLITICO. And though he resolved to try again even though no reason was given for the rejection last year, "I am not optimistic that it will ever get to where it needs to go."</p>
<p>Even so, some local officials lament what they call a lack of communication from the Biden administration<b> </b>about how to take advantage of opportunities for help.</p>
<b> </b>But those who want to tackle catastrophic climate impacts "have to learn how to jump through the government bureaucracy.”
<b> </b>while simultaneously crediting the administration for recognizing the problem.
<p>The infrastructure law Congress passed in November brought some hope that things will change, partly because it aims to help federal agencies hire staff to spread awareness of the available aid and help local officials apply for it.</p>
<b> </b>to replace pipes tainted with lead.
<p>“It has to be implemented well. I think people recognize that,” Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) told POLITICO. “And to implement it well, you're going to need adequate and qualified staff to do it.”</p>
<p>In response,<b> </b>DOE is offering technical assistance to as many as 36 low-income or “energy-burdened” communities to help them craft plans for transitioning to clean energy.</p>
<p>In December, EPA and the Appalachian Regional Commission announced a pilot program<b> </b>to help communities apply for grants.</p>
<b> </b>such as racial equity, rather than property values that have traditionally dictated which communities are worth restoring.
<p>“This is truly a moment of transformation within government at a grand scale,” Salinas said. “It feels like one of those generational opportunities to address so many systemic issues.”</p>
<b> </b>They also have criticized distributions that automatically send money to communities based on federal formulas, contending that those calculations prioritize higher property values and therefore leave them in the lurch.
<p>Beyond that, distrust remains because the federal government has not done enough to make inroads with overlooked communities, said Jade Begay, a New Mexico-based climate justice campaign director with indigenous environmental group NDN Collective.</p>
<a>report on equity</a>. Begay said the federal government assigns contractors to assist tribes with grant applications, but they often do not understand local needs.
<p>While welcomed, those efforts have also brought criticism over the Biden administration’s progress on staffing up and reaching communities it has vowed to help.</p>
<p>"The Biden administration has sent a clear signal that equity matters, and getting these funds to have impact on the ground is critical," she said.</p>
<b> </b>in a good way. It's a good problem to have. It's a lot better than the problem of ‘we have no resources at all.’”
<p>“We need to get it right, but we need to also let people know what's there for them, too. So we’ve got to educate,” Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.) told POLITICO.</p>
<p>The Democrats' success could help determine whether they can keep control of Congress in 2022 and of the White House beyond that.<b> </b></p>
<b> </b>benefits, it's gonna be a slaughter. Nobody's gonna be encouraged to come out and rally.”

<p> Michael Avenatti on the roof of the home where he is under house arrest in Venice, Calif, on Oct. 3, 2021. | Roger Kisby for Politico Magazine</p>
<div> <div> <p> By RUBY CRAMER </p> <p><time>12/22/2021 01:00 PM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/22/2021 05:27 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p><i>Ruby Cramer is a senior staff writer for Politico Magazine.</i></p>
<p>This Michael Avenatti doesn’t exist anymore.</p>
<i>three years ago</i>. The way Stormy Daniels, the central figure in the
<p>When I suggest to Avenatti that he could do his own live hits, launch his own podcast, reconnect with his friends at MSNBC and CNN — his old dinner partners in New York — he stops me.</p>
<p>“I am not a Boy Scout, and I am not a serial killer,” he says. “It’s easier for us when it comes to judging other human beings, to say, ‘He or she is 100 percent good, or he or she is 100 percent bad.’ Right? Because that makes it easy.”</p>
<p><b>It wasn’t hard</b> to get in touch with him again.</p>
<p>And so it was that Avenatti who came down around the track in March of 2018, hoping he’d make it.</p>
<p>“Ideally, you need to go on ‘60 Minutes.’”</p>
<p>“It was very heady at the time,” Avenatti says.</p>
<i>is</i> worth pausing here to remember
<p>“Yeah,” Avenatti replied.</p>
<p>“I’m going to look back some day and say, ‘This was the peak. It was all downhill from here.’”</p>
<p><b>Actually, the “peak” came later,</b> in August 2018.</p>
<p>He didn’t have six months, as it turned out. He barely had four.</p>
<i>Los Angeles Times </i>reporter Michael Finnegan said on a podcast after Avenatti’s arrest. He could “oscillate between charming and aggressive,” another reporter told me. “He wants to manage the story.” Later, in a
<i>Vanity Fair</i> event with the writer Emily Jane Fox. “I think everyone’s got some baby skeletons rolling around under the floorboards,” he told her. In an August appearance on ABC News,
<a>he promised</a> to release his tax returns. At the time, according to federal prosecutors, he owed millions to the IRS.
<p>By February 2019, he was no longer representing her. (Avenatti provided a copy of the termination letter he sent Daniels late that month, citing a “lack of communication” and a “general lack of appreciation for our work.”)</p>
<p>“Of course I made mistakes — you don’t end up in this situation without making mistakes. Whether those mistakes should put me where I am now is a different story,” he says. “I haven’t been naïve in a long, long time, but I was naïve about this.”</p>
<a>past representation</a> of Avenatti in connection with his domestic violence arrest.)
<p>“Of course, I’m nervous,” he told one network. “I’m scared.”</p>
<i>Jesus Christ, </i>he thought.
<p>When the cell door locked behind him in 10 South, Avenatti was in shock. “In a cocoon almost,” he says, “like a self-created protective cocoon.”</p>
<i>The Art of the Deal</i> by Donald Trump. Later, he was able to assemble a small collection of whatever he could get his hands on: David Sedaris’s
<i>Me Talk Pretty One Day</i>; Martin Luther King Jr.’s
<i>Strength to Love</i>; Tim Tebow’s
<i>Shaken</i>; a thick volume on the history of Iran.
<p>“It’s an anomaly. It’s bizarre,” she said.</p>
<p>Avenatti is convinced there is a more nefarious explanation.</p>
<p>“I just couldn’t even wrap my head around the fact that my dad was going to prison,” she said. “I hadn’t seen my dad as a criminal, ever. In that moment, I had to grow up really fast.”</p>
<p>“Anderson actually pushed back at one point.” Cooper, the “60 Minutes” host, had interviewed Avenatti all three times he appeared on the program.</p>
<p>“At one point Anderson said, ‘Well, you know, I mean, Michael Avenatti was a real attorney with real cases, right?’”</p>
<p><b>For a man in free fall,</b> there are three options.</p>
<p>“I’ve spent a lot of sleepless nights thinking about this, and there are only three.”</p>
<p>“Or there’s the third option,” he says, “you can fight. That’s what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>“At this point,” Avenatti says, “the only question is: Have I hit bottom?”</p>
<p>Woods was a man just like any other man, says Avenatti, with his own imperfections and failings. That’s what he was trying to tell his daughters.</p>
<p>“There are many times — ” He stops himself.</p>
<p>“There are not many times —”</p>
<p>He corrects again. “Basically all of the time — I don’t… I don’t see….”</p>
<p>“I don’t quite see how it all comes together yet.”</p>

<div> <div> <p> By ASSOCIATED PRESS</p> <p><time>12/26/2021 06:44 AM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/26/2021 01:41 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>Tutu worked passionately, tirelessly and non-violently to tear down apartheid — South Africa’s brutal, decades-long regime of oppression against its Black majority that only ended in 1994.</p>
<p>Upon becoming president in 1994, Mandela appointed Tutu to be chairman of the country’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which uncovered the abuses of apartheid.</p>
<p>Tutu’s death on Sunday “is another chapter of bereavement in our nation’s farewell to a generation of outstanding South Africans who have bequeathed us a liberated South Africa,” <a>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said.</a></p>
<p>Tutu died peacefully at the Oasis Frail Care Center in Cape Town, the Archbishop Desmond Tutu Trust said. He had been hospitalized several times since 2015 after being diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1997.</p>
<p>In recent years he and his wife, Leah, lived in a retirement community outside Cape Town.</p>
<p>Tutu’s life was “entirely dedicated to serving his brothers and sisters for the greater common good. He was a true humanitarian” said the Dalai Lama, Tibet’s exiled spiritual leader and Tutu’s friend.</p>
<a>said in a video statement</a>. “He felt with the people. In public and alone, he cried because he felt people’s pain. And he laughed — no, not just laughed, he cackled with delight — when he shared their joy.”
<p>Throughout the 1980s — when South Africa was gripped by anti-apartheid violence and a state of emergency gave police and the military sweeping powers — Tutu was one of the most prominent Black leaders able to speak out against abuses.</p>
<p>A lively wit lightened Tutu’s hard-hitting messages and warmed otherwise grim protests, funerals and marches. Plucky and tenacious, he was a formidable force with a canny talent for quoting apt scriptures to harness support for change.</p>
<p>The Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 highlighted his stature as one of the world’s most effective champions for human rights, a responsibility he took seriously for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>With the end of apartheid and South Africa’s first democratic elections in 1994, Tutu celebrated the country’s multi-racial society, calling it a “rainbow nation,” a phrase that captured the heady optimism of the moment.</p>
<p>In 1990, after 27 years in prison, Mandela spent his first night of freedom at Tutu’s residence in Cape Town. Later, Mandela called Tutu “the people’s archbishop.”</p>
<p>Tutu also campaigned internationally for human rights, especially LGBTQ rights and same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>“I would not worship a God who is homophobic,” he said in 2013, launching a campaign for LGBTQ rights in Cape Town. “I would refuse to go to a homophobic heaven. No, I would say, ‘Sorry, I would much rather go to the other place.’”</p>
<p>Tutu was arrested in 1980 for joining a protest and later had his passport confiscated for the first time. He got it back for trips to the United States and Europe, where he spoke with the U.N. secretary-general, the pope and other church leaders.</p>
<p>Tutu called for international sanctions against South Africa and talks to end apartheid.</p>
<p>As head of the truth commission, Tutu and his panel listened to harrowing testimony about torture, killings and other atrocities during apartheid. At some hearings, Tutu wept openly.</p>
<p>“Without forgiveness, there is no future,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>In July 2015, Tutu renewed his 1955 wedding vows with wife Leah, surrounded by their four children.</p>
<p>“You can see that we followed the biblical injunction: We multiplied and we’re fruitful,” Tutu told the congregation. “But all of us here want to say thank you ... We knew that without you, we are nothing.”</p>
<p>Tutu is survived by his wife of 66 years and their children.</p>
<p>Asked once how he wanted to be remembered, he told The Associated Press: “He loved. He laughed. He cried. He was forgiven. He forgave. Greatly privileged.”</p>

<p>The Covid-19 death rate in the state homes was much higher than in a separate kind of long-term care for vets, known as Community Living Centers, which are run wholly by the VA.</p>
<p>The Veterans Administration, which dispatched emergency teams and resources to both the vets’ homes and civilian health facilities during the peak of the crisis, has acknowledged it needs to do better.</p>
<p>Data matters, experts on epidemiology and long-term care say.</p>
<a>data is posted</a>. For months, data was hard to find for the roughly four dozen homes that are not under CMS purview. In mid-November,
<p>The homes understand that more needs to be done, their national association said.</p>
<p>It hasn’t happened yet, not across the board.</p>
<a>commissioned a report</a> by the St. Louis-based law firm Armstrong Teasdale on missteps and how to correct them. That report was made public.
<b> </b>As of earlier this month, Missouri had no Covid deaths in its state vets homes in 2021, she added.
<a>a state report</a> said Illinois’ LaSalle home had an outbreak that began in November 2020 and caused some 109 cases among veterans and 116 among staff. By contrast,
<p>Several other states have anomalies. But in other cases, reporting is improving. For instance, Nebraska data was missing earlier this fall; it’s now coming in.</p>
<p>For political leaders and advocates for veterans, the fight for full and accurate information on cases and fatalities has been long and frustrating.</p>
<a>Jon Tester</a> (D-Mont.) told POLITICO in an emailed statement. “That’s how we ensure states and VA are providing the best possible care veterans deserve.”
<p>Since May 2020, CMS has required long-term care facilities to submit data to the CDC — illness and death rates for both residents and staff.</p>
<p>The House and Senate Veterans Affairs Committees have pushed the VA, and the Government Accountability<b> </b>Office is reviewing the VA’s oversight and transparency. But it hasn’t become a top-tier issue for Congress overall.</p>
<p>“VA and states have a shared responsibility to oversee the quality of veterans’ care at State Veterans Homes, and we need better transparency when it comes to that oversight,” Tester added in his statement.</p>
<a>Chuck Grassley</a> (R-Iowa) earlier this year sent VA Secretary Denis McDonough a list of questions about oversight,
<a>the VA responded</a>, “VA has no recommendations at this time, and we are always glad to discuss with Congress ways to improve the oversight system of SVHs.”

<h2>Potential DOJ suits against Apple and Google delayed amid budget woes</h2>
<p>Antitrust prosecutors had aimed to wrap up their probes of the two tech giants by Dec. 31. But now a decision on whether to sue could come in March or later.</p>

<p>DOJ antitrust prosecutors had earlier aimed to <a>wrap up their probes of the two tech giants</a> by Dec. 31, culminating years of scrutiny by the department into Apple's App Store and Google's command of the online ad market.</p>
<p>But now the decision on going to court is likely to come in March or later because of continued discussions about where to file and who will make the call, the two people told POLITICO. They spoke anonymously to discuss internal DOJ deliberations.</p>
<a>torpedoed Democrats' Build Back Better package</a>, which would have given DOJ a $500 million boost for antitrust enforcement.
<p>Senate Democrats <a>vow to hold a vote</a> on the $1.7 trillion bill anyway in January. The department could also get extra cash in other upcoming legislative packages, such as a Senate-passed bill to aid U.S. competition with China.</p>
<p>For now, however, DOJ is weighing what antitrust cases can move forward with its current funding, though the people emphasized that decisions will be based on the legal merits.</p>
<p>Arlen Morales, a Justice Department spokesperson, declined to comment. Google and Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<b>Google and Apple probes</b>: The department has been investigating Google’s advertising technology business and Apple’s lucrative App Store since 2019, probes that continued even after DOJ sued
<a>Google in October 2020</a> over its online search business.
<p><b>Who will decide, and when: </b>Top DOJ decisions could make their final decisions on suing Google or Apple in the spring of 2022, the two people told POLITICO.</p>
<p>Either case would be expensive. Texas alone will require $43 million to pursue its piece of the multistate antitrust suit against Google, state Attorney General Ken Paxton has told legislators.</p>
<p><b>Speaking of money:</b> Congress’ fiscal 2022 funding bill for the Justice Department proposed giving antitrust prosecutors an extra $16 million.</p>

<p>Anthony Fauci said Sunday that there must be improvement in getting Covid tests to the American people.</p>
<p>“We've obviously got to do better,” Fauci told host Jonathan Karl on ABC’s “This Week.” “I mean, I think things will improve greatly as we get into January, but that doesn't help us today and tomorrow.“</p>
<p>Fauci told Karl there were encouraging signs about severity in the data from South Africa and the United Kingdom but that it was too soon to relax one‘s guard.</p>
<p>He also reiterated that the unvaccinated are most at-risk. “Those are the most vulnerable ones when you have a virus that is extraordinarily effective in getting to people and infecting them the way Omicron is,“ he said.</p>

<h2>Hospitals grapple with Omicron — and legal brawl over vaccinating staff</h2>
<p>More than 60,000 patients are hospitalized with Covid-19, according to the CDC, and the numbers are climbing with the highly contagious Omicron strain surging.</p>

<p>“We won't be terminating any employees in Florida until that is sorted out,” she said.</p>
<a>asked justices last week to allow the mandate to go forward</a>.
<a>nearly three-quarters of new U.S. cases</a>. And even before the strain surfaced, a large percentage of U.S. health workers were unvaccinated.
<a>to recent data</a> from the CDC. And, as of September, three in ten health care workers weren’t fully vaccinated, according to a
<a>CDC study</a>. Less than half of U.S. hospitals currently require vaccination, according to the American Hospital Association.
<p>“Vaccination rates among health care workers generally mirror those in the communities in which they live,” AHA spokesperson Colin Milligan said.</p>
<p>With the country now recording around 150,000 new infections every day and Biden’s mandate stalled, the pressure is on CMS to find a workaround.</p>
<p>Representatives of the American Hospital Association said last week that CMS hasn’t communicated a “Plan B” in case the mandate is blocked by the courts.</p>
<p>Amid the uncertainty, some health providers are seeking guidance from CMS on whether the mandate applies in some states but not others and, if so, when it takes effect.</p>
<p>Mara McDermott, vice president at health lobbying and advocacy firm McDermott+Consulting, said the “ping-ponging” of rules has left hospitals scrambling.</p>
<p>Some trade groups such as the Illinois Health and Hospital Association are advising members to follow the mandate.</p>
<p>But for many hospitals, requiring vaccination could create a staffing shortage and send workers who don’t want to be immunized seeking employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>“We have really seen many of our providers struggling with implementing their own rules of engagement for their business,” McDermott said.</p>
<p>But, she said, “that doesn't mean states and cities can’t be more aggressive.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court last week upheld New York’s requirement that health care workers be vaccinated even if they cite religious objections, and recently refused to block a similar rule in Maine.</p>
<p>North Carolina required its state health care workers to be vaccinated earlier this year. Now, more than 99 percent are vaccinated, according to Mandy Cohen, the state’s secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>Hospital leaders are now ensuring workers get a booster shot, she added.</p>
<p>“We are trying to lead by example,” Cohen said.</p>

<p>The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday <a>authorized a second antiviral pill</a> for people infected with Covid as the Biden administration works to ease the burden on hospitals swamped with patients during this most recent surge.</p>
<p>Patients will need a prescription and should start taking the pill within five days of experiencing symptoms. The treatment is taken twice a day for five days.</p>
<p>Clinical trials showed that Merck’s pill reduced the risk of hospitalization and death from the virus by 30 percent.</p>
<b> </b>Patrizia Cavazzoni, the director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
<p>On a press call Thursday, top FDA officials said that the Merck drug, whose effectiveness is significantly lower than Pfizer's, is recommended for patients for whom other treatments are not available. </p>
<p>But they insisted that doctors should decide which pill to prescribe on a case by case basis, noting that Pfizer's drug could interact badly with some other medications and isn't safe for people with severe liver or kidney disease. </p>

<section> <div> <div> <div> <a>Continue to article content</a> </div> </div> </div> </section>
<div> <div> <header> <p> Legal </p> <h1> Avenatti charged with embezzlement, fraud, cheating on taxes </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Attorney Michael Avenatti has been charged in a 36-count federal indictment alleging he stole millions of dollars from clients, did not pay his taxes, committed bank fraud and lied in bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>Avenatti, 48, was indicted late Wednesday by a Southern California grand jury on a raft of additional charges following his arrest last month in New York on two related counts and for allegedly trying to shake down Nike for up to $25 million.</p>
<p>“I look forward to the entire truth being known as opposed to a one-sided version meant to sideline me,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The new charges do not include the New York extortion case alleging Avenatti demanded millions to stay quiet about claims he planned to reveal about Nike paying high school players. Avenatti has said he expects to be cleared in that case.</p>
<p>Avenatti, 48, is also charged with not paying personal income taxes, not paying taxes for his various businesses, including two law firms, and pocketing payroll taxes from the Tully’s Coffee chain that he owned, the indictment said.</p>
<p>Between September 2015 and January 2018, Global Baristas US, the company that operated Tully’s, failed to pay the Internal Revenue Service $3.2 million in payroll taxes, including nearly $2.4 million withheld from employees, the indictment said.</p>
<p>When the IRS put tax levies on coffee company bank accounts to collect more than $5 million, Avenatti had Tully’s employees deposit cash receipts in a little-known account, the indictment said.</p>
<p>The charges are the latest major blow to a career that took off last year when Avenatti represented Daniels in her lawsuit to break a confidentiality agreement with Trump to stay mum about an affair they allegedly had.</p>
<p>Avenatti became one of Trump’s leading adversaries, attacking him on cable news programs and Twitter. At one point, Avenatti even considered challenging Trump in 2020.</p>
<p>But back home, his business practices had come under scrutiny from the IRS and a former law partner who was owed $14 million by Avenatti and the Eagan Avenatti firm, which filed for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The indictment said Avenatti made false statements in bankruptcy proceedings by submitting forms under penalty of perjury that under reported income his firm received.</p>
<p>The most glaring example of deception and fraud was described in the indictment as scheming Avenatti allegedly did to deprive clients of money they were due from legal settlements or sales of stock and the actions he took to cover his tracks.</p>
<p>In a case involving one client, Avenatti allegedly funneled a $2.75 million settlement into his bank accounts and spent $2.5 million on a private airplane, the indictment said.</p>
<p>Although Avenatti was due a portion of settlement funds for his work, the charges said he paid only a fraction of the money clients were due in some cases and strung them along while they waited to be paid.</p>
<p>Until last month, Avenatti had only provided $124,000 over 69 payments to Johnson, the indictment said.</p>
<p>After Avenatti was questioned about the alleged embezzlement during a judgment-debtor examination in federal court March 22, the indictment said he fabricated a defense for himself.</p>
<p>Avenatti had Johnson sign a document a day or two later saying he was satisfied with his representation, which the lawyer told him was necessary to get the settlement that had in fact been paid four years earlier, the indictment said.</p>
<p>When asked by The Associated Press last month about Johnson’s case, Avenatti said his client approved all transactions and accounting and had been kept in the loop.</p>
<p>“He has repeatedly thanked me for my dedication to his case and the ethics I have employed,” Avenatti wrote in an email response.</p>

<h2>Biden admin asks Supreme Court to allow nationwide health worker vax mandate</h2>
<p>Thursday's move is expected to prompt justices to issue a final decision on whether the mandate can take effect.</p>

<div> <div> <p> By RACHAEL LEVY</p> <p><time>12/16/2021 08:02 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>The Biden administration on Thursday asked that the Supreme Court allow it to impose its vaccine mandate on health care workers nationwide after lower courts froze it in two dozen mostly Republican-led states.</p>
<p>The rule formulated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has been in legal limbo for weeks after some states successfully sought injunctions, arguing that CMS overstepped its authority.</p>
<p>Thursday's move is expected to prompt justices to issue a final decision on whether the mandate can take effect, according to Sean Marotta, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells.</p>
<p>The mandate covers workers at federally funded health care facilities and was set to take effect on Dec. 6. Workers had until Jan. 4 to be fully vaccinated or to exercise limited exemptions.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the mandate could proceed in roughly half the country, while saying 24 states that challenged it were not subject to the rule.</p>
<p>In its applications Thursday, the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to stop two injunctions on the mandate that were issued by the U.S. district courts for the Western District of Louisiana and for the Eastern District of Missouri.</p>
<p>DOJ argued that requiring vaccinations was necessary as the country recorded more than 800,000 deaths from Covid-19 and with 1,300 dying per day. The department also cited the emergence of the highly transmissible Omicron strain.</p>
<p>The administration has argued that Medicare and Medicaid patients in covered facilities are among the most vulnerable to coronavirus, deserving of protection from their health care providers.</p>
<p>The mostly Republican-led states argued the requirement was unlawful and would exacerbate health care staffing shortages, particularly in rural areas.</p>
<p>CMS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<h2>Bad Covid winter brings questions about what's 'fully vaccinated'</h2>
<p>Discussions within the administration are focused on whether a third shot should be considered part of the original Covid-19 vaccine regimen.</p>

<p>It's not just an exercise in semantics. Changing the criteria and messaging could influence how quickly workplaces and public events reopen, and how much a crisis-weary and in some cases confused population responds to pleas to get booster shots.</p>
<p>“All of those ingredients are very conducive to a winter surge, not even counting Omicron yet,” said the official. “We superimpose Omicron on that, and you have a serious situation.”</p>
<p>The CDC recorded more than 150,000 new Covid-19 cases at the end of last week. The average has steadily climbed since October, shortly after the Food and Drug Administration authorized the first booster doses from Pfizer-BioNTech.</p>
<p>“Everything points to a very simple message: Go get boosted,” said a senior administration official.</p>
<b> </b>said a person familiar with the discussions within the Biden administration. “I don’t think this is a long-term solution at all,” the person added. “You cannot be getting boosters every four to six months.”
<a>stubborn vaccine resistance among perhaps 30 percent of the U.S. population</a> and projections that daily Omicron cases could be two to three times what was seen during the Delta variant wave.
<p>In a stark warning about the winter surge Thursday, Biden focused his message on those who have yet to seek a booster.</p>
<p>“There’s good news,” he said, after describing a coming surge. “If you're vaccinated and you have your booster shot, you're protected from severe illness and death.”</p>
<p>That renewed booster push is running concurrent to deliberations about what it means to be fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Those complications mean the administration is unlikely to greenlight such a dramatic shift in the coming weeks, instead relying on businesses and localities to make their own initial decisions on how to handle the question.</p>
<p>Confusion has accompanied the booster rollout from its earlier days when questions about who was eligible were blamed for sluggish uptake.</p>
<p>Top Biden administration officials have publicly touted the pace of booster shots since Omicron emerged, emphasizing the work they've done in recent weeks to make the shots more widely available.</p>
<b> </b>over whether such widespread distribution was justified.
<p>The White House’s Covid-19 response team has since focused the majority of its energy on simplifying its message and trying to spark the same sense of urgency that most Americans felt back when vaccines first became available.</p>
<p>“There are 100 million people, roughly, who are currently eligible for a booster who have already gotten vaccinated, and so we know they’re open to this message of ‘vaccines work,’” said one official.</p>
<b> </b>focused largely on what people can personally do to avoid a surge.
<p>“Get boosted, get your family and kids vaccinated, wear a mask and get tested, those are the actions that people can take,” the official said.</p>
<p>That campaign is likely to pick up over the next several weeks, especially in the wake of more evidence that boosted individuals are far better protected against Omicron than those who have only received the initial vaccine series.</p>
<p>In the meantime, health experts expect a tough winter and lingering public confusion over vaccines and boosters.</p>

<h2>Biden expanding testing and reinforcing hospitals in face of Omicron</h2>
<p>The initiatives come as Omicron blankets the U.S. and amount to a redeployment of emergency defenses seen last year.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <p> By ADAM CANCRYN</p> <p><time>12/21/2021 05:00 AM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/21/2021 04:22 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>But he rejected fears that Omicron would prompt a return of widespread lockdowns and school closures, arguing that the government is far better prepared to respond to accelerating cases and hospitalizations.</p>
<p>“This is not March of 2020,” Biden said. “We’re ready. We’ll get through.”</p>
<p>And in a notable move, the federal government is purchasing 500 million at-home rapid tests that Americans will be able to order for free beginning in January.</p>
<p>Those initiatives amount to a redeployment of emergency defenses seen last year, ahead of expectations that the more contagious Omicron variant will drive an explosion of infections throughout the winter.</p>
<p>“This is a critical moment, but we also have more tools than we’ve ever had before,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Yet even as he projected confidence, Biden’s speech illustrated the contrasting messages that the White House has sought to deliver<b> </b>nearly two years into the pandemic.</p>
<p>The president veered from dire warnings directed at those who remain unvaccinated to reassurance for the more than 200 million who have gotten their shots, while at the same time trying to prepare the nation for a skyrocketing number of cases.</p>
<p>“If you’re not fully vaccinated, you have good reason to be concerned. You’re at high risk of getting sick,” Biden said, later telling those who are vaccinated that “these cases are unlikely to lead to serious illness.”</p>
<p>He also delivered a direct appeal to conservatives who make up a disproportionate percentage of vaccine holdouts, referencing former President Donald Trump by name and touting his disclosure this week that he had gotten a booster shot.</p>
<p>“Maybe one of the few things he and I agree on,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Just minutes later after offering that olive branch, though, Biden appeared to take a harder line with that very same group, while swiping at the conservative pundits and lawmakers who have sown distrust in the Covid-19 vaccines.</p>
<p>“The unvaccinated are responsible for their own choices,” Biden said, lamenting the resistance “fueled by dangerous misinformation on cable TV and social media.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 percent of fully vaccinated adults, meanwhile, have yet to receive their boosters — alarming officials in the wake of evidence that breakthrough Omicron infections are much more likely among those who have yet to get the additional shot.</p>
<p>The U.S. is now recording more than 140,000 daily new Covid-19 cases on average, roughly double the levels seen in early November.</p>
<b>. </b>They also could not immediately say what proportion of those 500 million tests will be available on day one of the program, or what the purchase would ultimately cost the federal government.
<p>Still, it represents a sharp about face for an administration that previously dismissed the idea of sending out free tests — arguing at the time that it would be too costly and inefficient.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Biden disputed assertions that the administration had not acted fast enough, saying the speed of Omicron’s spread caught everyone by surprise.</p>
<p>“All of a sudden it was like everybody rushed to the counter,” he said. “What happened was the Omicron virus spread even more rapidly than anybody thought.”</p>

<p>President Joe Biden on Thursday announced plans to require staff vaccinations at all health facilities that receive federal funding, as part of a sweeping new plan to rein in the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The move represents a dramatic expansion of the administration’s bid to boost vaccination rates among frontline health care workers, and comes as the administration readies a redoubling of efforts to rein in the virus.</p>
<p>“This is not about freedom and personal choice. It’s about protecting yourself and those around you," Biden said. He added, "The bottom line, we're going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated coworkers."</p>
<p>Officials anticipate the broader mandate will affect more than 50,000 health facilities and 17 million workers. </p>
<p>She added that federal workers would have 75 days to comply with the mandate, unless they qualify for limited exemptions. </p>
<p>"In total, the new vaccination requirements in the president's plan cover about 100 million workers, that's two-thirds of all workers in the United States," a senior administration official told reporters on Thursday. </p>
<p>The roughly 300,000 staff at Head Start programs will similarly be required to get vaccinated, as well as those who work in schools run by federal agencies. </p>
<p>Still, it remains unclear how quickly the administration will be able to procure the rapid tests, which have been in shortage due to overwhelming demand for the products.</p>
<p>Biden touched on the administration’s plan for Covid-19 booster shots, after an initial rollout prompted broad confusion and accusations of political pressure on government health agencies.</p>
<p>The administration in the meantime is speeding shipments of monoclonal antibody treatments to states, amid a surge in demand among the harder-hit states in the Southeast.</p>
<p>The new plan comes just two months after Biden held a July Fourth celebration at the White House, where he declared that the nation was close to vanquishing the pandemic. </p>
<p>That has fueled a renewed emphasis on the pandemic fight, which Democrats view as critical to Biden’s public standing and their odds of keeping full control of Congress in 2022. </p>
<p>Republicans in the meantime are waging pitched battles over mask-wearing in schools, with some like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis vowing to punish officials that try to make it a requirement.</p>
<p>“Put simply, workers deserve a voice in their working conditions,” Kelley said. </p>
<p>Psaki said Thursday that the administration has had “a range consultations with unions” — including AFGE — over the last few months.</p>
<b> </b>The new plan coincides with rising anxiety over Covid-19 outbreaks at schools, where children under 12 years old remain unvaccinated. Biden stressed the need to set up regular testing as a way of heading off the spread of infection.
<p>The White House earlier this year allocated $10 billion to help schools create Covid-19 testing regimes, but few took advantage of the opportunity amid a lull in cases earlier this year. </p>
<p>"I have been surprised at how many are not testing routinely," Plescia said.</p>
<a>just 1,602 institutions have signed up to partake</a> in a separate $650 million federal effort to organize testing at regional coordination hubs at K-8 schools and congregate settings like homeless shelters.
<p>One industry source expressed doubt at the effectiveness of<b> </b>what they described as the Biden team employing a strategy of "No, really guys, we mean it."</p>
<p>"We all assume that it's just Texas and Iowa that aren't testing to protect kids. But the reality is plenty of affluent suburbs in Connecticut, Maryland, etc. aren't even testing at all," the source said.</p>

<h2>White House lights up Manchin after he crushes Biden's megabill</h2>
<p>The West Wing accused Manchin of "a breach of his commitments to the president and the senator’s colleagues in the House and Senate," in a blistering statement Sunday.</p>
<p> Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.): “This is a no on this piece of legislation. I have tried everything I know to do.”</p>
<div> <div> <p> By BURGESS EVERETT, NICHOLAS WU and JONATHAN LEMIRE</p> <p><time>12/19/2021 09:17 AM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/19/2021 03:14 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>Joe Manchin struck a decisive blow to President Joe Biden’s sweeping social and climate spending bill, igniting a bitter clash with his own party's White House.</p>
<p>Biden left negotiations with Manchin this week thinking the two men could cut a deal next year on his sweeping agenda. Then the West Virginia Democrat bluntly said he is a “no” on the $1.7 trillion in an interview on “Fox News Sunday.” </p>
<p>Manchin’s rollout on Fox News infuriated Democrats Sunday morning. Psaki said that the senator had brought Biden an outline of a bill similar in size and scope that "could lead to a compromise acceptable to all."</p>
<p>And while the centrist senator’s staff informed White House and Democratic aides about his forthcoming blow to Biden’s agenda, some Democrats were steamed that Manchin himself hadn’t called Biden or Schumer.</p>
<p>"Manchin didn't have the courage to call the White House or Democratic leadership himself ahead of time,” fumed one Democrat familiar with internal conversations. </p>
<a>Sunday tweet</a>. But even if the White House and moderate members of Congress get on board with trimming the package, some progressives balked at the approach.
<p>“To me, that’s not acceptable,” said progressive Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.). </p>
<p>Manchin had few defenders in his own party on Sunday. The only people praising him were Republicans, who have tried to get him to switch parties and hand them the majority. Manchin has refused repeatedly. </p>
<p>In his TV appearance, Manchin said he would be fine voting on the bill.</p>
<p>If the bill ever comes to the floor, it won’t be for a few weeks. The Senate left town on Saturday morning for the holidays and won’t return until early January.</p>
