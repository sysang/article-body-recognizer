<h2>Is your employer spying on you?</h2>
<p>In February 2020, the month before the coronavirus triggered lockdowns across the U.S., Americans logged 5% of their work hours at home, on average. After the pandemic took hold, that figure climbed all the way up to 40%.</p>
<p>Yet the <b>productivity of American workers actually increased during the pandemic</b>. In fact, it’s grown more than twice as fast during the COVID-19 era as it did during the entire decade before.</p>
<p><b>So why are so many companies spying on their remote workers?</b></p>
<p>Maybe it’s because they can, <a>my colleague Don Lee reports</a>. </p>
<p>All this surveillance can be had for as little as $50 to $100 per employee per year.</p>
<p><b>About 60% of large companies now use monitoring software</b>, according to estimates from Gartner, the technology research and consulting firm. In early 2020, only 30% did so. </p>
<p>“<b>It’s essentially become the new norm</b>,” said Eli Sutton, Teramind’s vice president of operations.</p>
<p>Sound Orwellian? That may explain why so many companies brushed off Lee’s requests to talk about why they use the software. That list includes Verizon, Keller Williams and Vonage. </p>
<p>And to make things even creepier: <b>Some companies are monitoring workers without their knowledge</b>. A study this spring found that 20% of employers who used the software hadn’t come clean with their employees.</p>
<b>The practice is generally legal</b>, so long as the tracking occurs on company-owned equipment. But a few states are trying to change that.
<a>A bill</a> under consideration in the Massachusetts Legislature would put checks on employee surveillance;
<a>another bill</a> in Illinois would restrict how companies use the software to discipline workers.
<p>If you work from home, you’re probably eager to find out whether your company is spying on you. </p>
<b>there’s no easy way for employees to find out if their employer is monitoring them</b>,” Matt Scherer, senior policy counsel for worker privacy at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology,
<a>told my colleague Arit John</a>.

<a>Then on Tuesday</a>, a federal district court in Augusta, Ga., issued a stay to prevent the vaccine mandate from being enforced anywhere in the country.
<b>The order applies nationwide</b> because one of the challengers is a trade group that represents builders and contractors around the country.

<h1> In 2021, the recall circus returned to California. Republicans sent in the clowns </h1>
<div><div> By Erika D. SmithColumnist </div></div>
<p>By March, Gov. Gavin Newsom knew he was in trouble.</p>
<p>But, this year, the COVID-19 pandemic changed everything.</p>
<p>“In 25 months, there’s been six efforts to put a recall on the ballot,” Newsom said in mid-March on ABC’s “The View.” “This one appears to have the requisite signatures,” he acknowledged.</p>
<p>Indeed, by April, Secretary of State Shirley Weber declared that <a>enough signatures had been </a><a>verified</a> — more than 1,495,709 — to force a recall election by the end of the year.</p>
<p>That campaign Newsom once dismissed as the purview of the far right — alongside Trumpism, anti-vax conspiracy theories and a refusal to wear face masks? It had suddenly gained mainstream appeal. </p>
<a>Newsom said after being caught</a>. “We’re all human. We all fall short sometimes.”
<p>“COVID fatigue,” <a>he added</a>, “is exhausting.”</p>
<p>By May, the recall circus was well underway. As was the case in 2003, when a deeply unpopular Davis was fighting for political life, dozens of unqualified clowns signed up to be candidates. </p>
<p>Among the most prominent: the millennial YouTuber Kevin Paffrath, the obnoxious Olympian-turned-reality-TV-star Caitlyn Jenner and the failed gubernatorial hopeful John Cox, who crisscrossed the state with a 1,000-pound, Kodiak bear named Tag.</p>
<a>Cox said during a campaign stop</a> in Sacramento, while Tag snacked on cookies and chicken. “We’re going to have to be tough as a beast to go against the special interest groups.”
<p>As President Biden said of Elder <a>while stumping for Newsom in Long Beach</a>, “The leading Republican running for governor is the closest thing to a Trump clone that I have ever seen.”</p>
<p>Despite all of this, by the final weeks of the race, Elder had an actual shot at being governor. Blame California’s nonsensical recall election process. </p>
<p>Lucky for Newsom, in this bluest of blue states, where the vast majority of the electorate is terrified of electing anyone at all connected to former President Trump, the governor managed to <a>handily beat back the recall</a> attempt. </p>
<p>As he said in his no-frills victory speech: “Democracy is not a football. You don’t throw it around.”</p>
<p>As 2021 comes to a close, I find myself wondering what — if anything — California learned from this embarrassingly expensive exercise in ego-stroking political theater. And what — if anything — will come of it. </p>
<p>At the very least, we seem to have learned that the recall process needs an overhaul.</p>
<p>“Californians are very frustrated that we just spent $276 million on this recall election that, from the looks of it, certified what voters said three years ago,” Assembly member Marc Berman of Menlo Park said in September. </p>
<p>Hearings are already being held by the election committees of the Legislature. </p>
<p>But I suspect the impact of the recall election won’t stop there. Rather, it will be felt most across the nation.</p>
<p>Consider that after Newsom trounced his would-be Republican ousters, political watchers speculated that his strategy of tying Republican candidates to Trump was one that would help Democrats in the midterm election. </p>
<p>Just as important, Winsome Sears won the race for lieutenant governor, becoming the first Black woman elected to statewide office in Virginia’s history. </p>
<p>Sound familiar? Call it the Larry Elder strategy, pioneered right here in California. What better way for Republicans to avoid talking about their party’s embrace of white supremacists than to promote Black conservatives?</p>
<p>Former NFL player Herschel Walker is trying the same trick in Georgia with a run for the U.S. Senate. Trump might try it too, as he weighs options for a running mate in 2024, Trump’s pollster <a>speculated to Politico</a>. </p>
<p>The night Elder lost his bid to replace Newsom, he promised his mostly white, Republican supporters that he’d be back.</p>
<p>“We may have lost the battle,” <a>he said, pacing a stage in Costa Mesa</a>, “but we are going to win the war.”</p>
<p>Not in California. But the rest of the country could be in trouble.</p>

<p>Though climate continued to polarize Washington, D.C. — see the near total lack of Republican support for the clean energy investments proposed by President Biden — there were at least some encouraging signs west of the 100th meridian.</p>
<p>Take the Colorado River and its tributaries, whose waters quench the thirst of tens of millions of people and irrigate millions of acres of farmland from Wyoming to Mexico.</p>
<p>In August, federal officials declared the <a>first-ever water shortage on the Colorado</a>, triggering cutbacks in Arizona, Nevada and Mexico.</p>
<p>If the situation worsens, California will accept cutbacks too. John Fleck, a water resources professor at the University of New Mexico, has described the agreement as a model for the future cooperation that will be needed as the Colorado dwindles.</p>
<p>“The river’s future is not all dark,” Fleck and Eric Kuhn wrote. “Innovation, cooperation and an expanded reliance on science are now the foundation for basin-wide solutions.”</p>
<a>raised pay for federal firefighters</a> and
<a>worked with California to reduce fire risk</a> by thinning overgrown forests — a stark change in approach from President Trump, who
<a>bluntly blamed the Golden State</a> for not “raking” its forests. California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a
<a>$15-billion climate package</a> that included money to fight fires, droughts, extreme heat and sea level rise.
<p>Officials also increasingly agreed on the need to set intentional, low-intensity fires — known as “prescribed burns” — of the type that <a>helped protect Lake Tahoe this summer</a>.</p>
<p>But although those solutions could pay dividends over years and decades, the fires keep getting worse.</p>
<div><p><a>Climate Environment</a></p><p> <a>As fires threaten the Ancient Ones, sequoia lovers wonder what else will no longer endure</a> </p></div>
<p>In California and beyond, some people are deeply in grief, stunned that flames could again imperil some of Earth’s oldest living things. </p>
<p>The smoke from those conflagrations spread far and wide, forcing people to breathe hazardous air up and down the West Coast and as far away as Appalachia. Scientists linked increased smoke exposure with <a>greater susceptibility to COVID-19</a>.</p>

<p>After a village in British Columbia broke Canada’s all-time heat record, hitting 121 degrees, climate scientist Andrew Weaver said the province <a>felt more like Death Valley</a>.</p>
<p>“I’ve been in a lot of hot places in the world, and this was the worst I’ve ever been in,” he said.</p>
<div><p><a>Climate Environment</a></p><p> <a>Heat waves are far deadlier than we think. How California neglects this climate threat</a> </p></div>
<p>California chronically undercounts the death toll from extreme heat, which disproportionately harms the poor, the elderly and others who are vulnerable.</p>
<p><a>Declining reservoirs, meanwhile, produced less hydroelectricity</a>, which in a cruel twist forced utilities to burn more natural gas, one of the fossil fuels heating the planet.</p>
<a>100% clean-energy mandate</a> has a 2045 deadline, a decade later than scientists say is needed worldwide to avoid the worst consequences of climate change. In the meantime, activists say the state
<a>isn’t moving fast enough</a> to build solar and wind farms, support the purchase of electric vehicles and reduce oil and gas production.
<p>Even Jared Blumenfeld, who was appointed by Newsom to lead California’s Environmental Protection Agency, acknowledged the state needed to do more, faster.</p>
<p>“Everyone is realizing the front lines of the battle are a hell of a lot closer than we ever imagined. And the threat from the enemy is real and present,” he said.</p>
<p>Though some Western states at least tried to follow California’s lead on climate — Colorado, Oregon and Washington in particular — others followed a different playbook.</p>

<a>backtracked</a> on a plan to require 100% clean energy, only to
<a>backtrack again</a> and offer a preliminary sign-off — but with a deadline of 2070, decades beyond what global climate commitments will require. New Mexico’s Democratic governor, Michelle Lujan Grisham, talked a big game on climate but also
<a>criticized</a> President Biden for attempting to limit oil and gas production. Wyoming lawmakers kept up a years-long effort to
<a>protect the state’s coal, oil and gas companies</a> from economic headwinds.
<p>Then there was Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who responded to worsening drought by declaring a need for <a>“divine intervention”</a> and asking Utahns to pray for rain.</p>
<p>The antigovernment, white nationalist-tinged ideology of Western militias began to spread nationally too, some experts said.</p>
<p>Even without the threat of armed standoffs, treasured Western landscapes faced plenty of challenges from global warming, human visitation and energy development.</p>

<p>Rising temperatures threatened iconic species, with a federal judge <a>ordering the Biden administration</a> to reconsider its decision not to protect Joshua trees under the Endangered Species Act.</p>

<p>Even beyond climate change, there are many reasons to transition to solar and wind power — the Huntington Beach oil spill among them.</p>
<a>announced its “America the Beautiful” initiative</a>. “It will take from-the-ground-up efforts in every state, using many different forms of conservation, to get there.”
<p>Again: Collaboration is key. The last year made that abundantly clear. Whether Westerners can come together to reduce emissions and fortify themselves against the disasters on the horizon is yet to be seen.</p>

<div> <div> <div><a>Politics</a></div> <h1> The Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol was bad. It may have set the stage for worse </h1> </div> </div>
<div> <div> By Doyle McManusWashington Columnist </div> </div>
<p>On Jan. 6, when followers of President Trump stormed the Capitol to try to block the election of President Biden, the insurrection seemed like a bizarre anomaly — a freak storm whipped up by pro-Trump extremists and right-wing militias.</p>
<a>“election denialism”</a> — has turned out to be
<a>larger, more durable</a> and every bit as worrisome as the violence of that chaotic day.
<p>The violence, which disrupted Congress’ constitutionally mandated count of electoral votes for hours, wasn’t as accidental as it looked — and it could well happen again, experts on terrorism say.</p>
<p>Before the riot, <a>Trump spent weeks</a> telling his followers that the election had been stolen — even though he and his lawyers had <a>produced no evidence of significant fraud</a>.</p>
<p>On Jan. 6, he told the marchers outside the White House that his vice president could block electoral votes that were pledged to Joe Biden. “If Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election,” he said.</p>
<p>That wasn’t true; the vice president doesn’t have that power. But many of the demonstrators hoped that if they put enough pressure on Pence, he would cave in to Trump’s demand.</p>
<p>Trump’s last-minute attempt to block Biden’s election came after weeks of other efforts to overturn the results.</p>
<a>find 11,780 votes</a>” to erase Biden’s lead; he refused too. Trump also unsuccessfully pressured the Justice Department to intervene on his behalf.
<p>But none of that has stopped Trump from continuing to proclaim his spurious gospel of fraud.</p>
<p>“We won on the Arizona forensic audit,” he told supporters the night after the audit results came out. “[Biden] didn’t win in Arizona; he lost.”</p>
<p>Biden won Arizona by more than 10,000 votes.</p>
<p>Still, Trump has succeeded in one important respect: He has convinced millions of Republican voters that the election was stolen from them.</p>
<p>That’s making chaos and even violence around future elections more likely, many experts fear.</p>
<p>Another survey, the Economist/YouGov poll, found that election denialism grew over the first nine months of 2020.</p>
<p>At postelection rallies, the former president repeatedly has told supporters that any time Democrats win elections, they must have engaged in fraud.</p>
<p>“There is no way they win elections without cheating,” he said in Phoenix in July.</p>
<p>It’s tempting to consider this just more evidence of what psychologists call “motivated reasoning,” the tendency to believe only those facts (in this case, imaginary facts) that conform with your partisan views.</p>
<p>But it’s more dangerous than that.</p>
<p>“About 65 million Americans believe that Joe Biden stole the election and is an illegitimate president,” Robert A. Pape, a terrorism expert at the University of Chicago, said. “That’s a lot of people.”</p>
<p>“We know that only a small fraction of people who say they are willing to engage in violence will ultimately do so,” he added. “So the size of the pool is important.”</p>
<p>One more finding from Pape’s research: Of the hundreds of people who have been arrested and charged with crimes in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, most aren’t militia members or marginal cranks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Trump and his supporters are doing plenty of groundwork to contest the results of future elections.</p>
<p>They’re changing the rules, passing laws to enable GOP-dominated state legislatures to exert control over election administration and recounts.</p>
<p>Robert A. Pape, terrorism expert at the University of Chicago</p>
<p>They could, of course, win the next election the old-fashioned way, by winning more votes than their opponent.</p>
<p>But if they fall short, they have a Plan B — one that a lot of voters already appear willing to support, and a cause for which their most militant supporters are ready to march on the Capitol again.</p>
<p>Jan. 6 may have been only a dress rehearsal.</p>

<h1> Supreme Court poised to further open the door for taxpayer funding of religious schools </h1>
<div><div> By David G. SavageStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>After imposing a strict church-state separation for decades, the Supreme Court appears poised to allow — and in some cases even require — more government funding of church-run schools. </p>
<p>Legal experts say that could open the door to church-sponsored charter schools operating with public funds in many cities. </p>
<p>The court’s shift to the right on religion and schools may not be as sharp and dramatic as on abortion and guns, but its impact could prove to be just as far-reaching. </p>
<p>Previously the high court held the Constitution called for a clear separation of church and state, which had long been interpreted to mean that public funds could not flow to religious schools.</p>
<p>But in recent years, the court’s conservatives have flipped the equation and argued this exclusion amounts to discrimination against religion. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, the court will hear a new test of church-state separation in a case from Maine, which has no public high schools in some rural communities. </p>
<p>The state pays tuition to send those students to private high schools, but only if they are “nonsectarian” schools. The state adopted this rule 40 years ago believing it was required as a matter of church-state separation. </p>
<p>Now this seemingly small case is at the center of a large dispute over when religious schools are entitled to public funding. And it arrives at a time when the court’s conservative majority has been strengthened.</p>
<p>Conservative justices in recent years have been insisting that the tradition of church-state separation should be cast aside because it grew from an anti-Catholic bias in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>
<p>These restrictions were “born of bigotry” and “arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general,” he <a>said in Espinoza vs. Montana</a>.</p>
<p>Two other justices said they would go much further and rule that states were free to promote religion. </p>
<p>The 1st Amendment forbids laws “respecting an establishment of religion,” which had been seen as barring the government from subsidizing religion. But Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil M. Gorsuch disagreed. </p>
<p>Maine Atty. Gen. Aaron Frey counters that the state and its taxpayers are paying for a “public education” for all children and do not want to “subsidize religious exercise” for some. </p>
<p>A crucial question is what are the limits of this nondiscrimination rule. Does it apply only to special state scholarships or voucher programs, or could it apply broadly, including to charter schools that can be privately owned but publicly funded?</p>
<p>Experts in education law say the next battleground will be charter schools, which have been growing in California and in many parts of the nation as privately-run, taxpayer-funded alternatives to traditional public schools. </p>
<p>But Francisco M. Negron, chief counsel for the National School Boards Assn., urged the court to move with the caution. </p>
<p>Some legal experts foresee the more conservative high court deciding that parents have a right to send their children to religious schools at public expense. </p>

<h1> Biden urges Putin to seek diplomacy, not war, with Ukraine </h1>
<div><div> By Eli StokolsStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>President Biden warned Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during a videoconference Tuesday that invading Ukraine would result in stiff economic sanctions from the U.S. and several European allies. </p>
<p>The virtual meeting, the second time the two leaders have held direct talks since their June summit in Geneva, arose after Putin mobilized about 100,000 Russian forces on the country’s border with Ukraine, sparking new fears about an invasion.</p>
<p>The two world leaders also discussed U.S. and Russian long-term work on arms control, ransomware and joint efforts on regional issues such as Iran.</p>
<p>But he is hoping to dissuade Putin from escalating the simmering military conflict along the Russia-Ukraine border. </p>
<p>Before the discussion with Putin, Biden conferred with top European allies Monday evening about the far-reaching economic sanctions any invasion would trigger.</p>
<div><p><a>World Nation</a></p><p> <a>As warnings fly between U.S. and Russia, how real is the threat of war in Ukraine?</a> </p></div>
<p>So far, tensions between Washington and Moscow over Ukraine have been restricted to a war of words, but could it flare into something more dangerous?</p>
<p>“If Putin wants to see gas flowing through that pipeline, he may not want to take the risk of invading Ukraine,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Several Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, have called for sanctions against the pipeline.</p>

<div> <div> <div>Television</div> <h1> Keep calm and watch British TV: An expert recommends 35 shows to get you started </h1> </div> </div>
<div> <div> By Mary McNamaraCulture Columnist and Critic </div> </div>
<p>Both of whom, I might add, are featured at one time or another in “Doctor Who.” </p>
<a>content war between BritBox and AcornTV</a> has made all manner of great Anglophilic TV available, and both of those
<div> <p>For the record:</p> <p>12:13 p.m. April 3, 2020An earlier version of this story listed “George Gently” as being on BritBox; it is on Acorn TV.</p> </div>
<p>So while it would be impertinent, and frankly impossible, to put together a “best of” list, here are some of my favorites, which might help you Keep Calm and Carry On. (I did mention how fond I am of murder mysteries, right?)</p>
<div><p><a>Television</a></p><p> <a>The 51 best TV shows to binge while self-quarantining, according to TV experts </a> </p></div>
<p>We polled more than 40 TV critics and journalists, inside and outside The Times, on the best TV show to binge while stuck at home.</p>
<p><b>“Agatha Christie’s Poirot” </b>(BritBox)</p>
<p>Many have played the iconic I-am-not-French-I-am-Belgian detective (including, most recently, a <a>surprisingly good Kenneth Branagh</a>), but no one beats <a>David Suchet</a>, who has done it for 25 years and 70 episodes.</p>
<p><b>“Agatha Christie’s Marple” </b>(Acorn TV, Hulu)</p>
<p>Many have also played the iconic denizen of St. Mary’s Mead, Jane Marple, but I think Geraldine McEwan best captures the trademark combination of flutter and canniness that made Miss Marple such a revolutionary and enduring character.</p>
<p><b>“Sherlock” </b>(Netflix)</p>
<a>bring the Great Detective</a> into the modern world. I watch the entire series every year. Sad, but true.
<p><b>“Prime Suspect” </b>(BritBox) </p>
<a>now-legendary Helen Mirren</a> to those Americans who did not remember her from “Excalibur,” and proved that women could head police departments and police procedurals. Holds up to this day for reasons laudable and lamentable.
<p><b>“Happy Valley” </b>(Netflix)</p>
<a>on critics’ lists</a> — it’s great.
<p><b>“Foyle’s War” </b>(Acorn TV) </p>
<p><b>“Agatha Raisin” </b>(Acorn TV)Funny, sweet, candy-colored and contemporary, this fish-out-of-water tale follows Agatha (<a>Ashley Jensen)</a> as she transforms from London publicity agent to small-town sleuth.</p>
<p><b>“Wire in the Blood” </b>(Acorn TV)</p>
<a>Robson Green</a> all over British streaming, including in “Grantchester” (see below) and several travel/reality shows. But as
<a>Tony Hill,</a> police detective and serial killer expert, he helped set the template for the wounded sleuth whose own foibles make him great.
<p><b>“Luther”</b> (Amazon)</p>
<p><b>“Cracker” </b>(BritBox) </p>
<p>Robbie Coltrane (best known now as Hagrid in the “Harry Potter” film franchise) plays a politically incorrect and delightfully <a>cranky forensic psychologist turned crime solver</a>.</p>
<p><b>“George Gently” </b>(Acorn TV) </p>
<p>Not only a terrific police drama, starring <a>Martin Shaw</a> as the title character, “George Gently” also offers a look at 1960s northeast England, and while it is not always pretty, it’s always pretty thought-provoking.</p>
<p><b>“Law and Order: U.K.” </b>(Amazon) </p>
<p>“Law and Order” with better accents, crazy wig-hats and, thank the Lord, Freema Agyeman. </p>
<p><b>“Unforgotten” </b>(Masterpiece)</p>
<p>I will watch anything that stars Nicola Walker, especially a murder mystery series in which she and her partner, played by Sanjeev Bhaskar, solve cold cases in the most <a>mesmerizing and emotionally charged</a> way.</p>
<div><p><a>Television</a></p><p> <a>An expert’s guide to reality TV for every self-quarantine mood</a> </p></div>
<p>From “Vanderpump Rules” and “Real Housewives” to “Love Is Blind” on Netflix, our guide to the reality TV to stream in quarantine has something for everyone.</p>
<p><b>“Grantchester” </b>(Masterpiece)</p>
<p><b>“Cadfael” </b>(BritBox) </p>
<p><b>“Father Brown” </b>(BritBox) </p>
<h3>Drama, pioneering women</h3>
<p><b>“Call the Midwife” </b>(Netflix)</p>
<p><b>“The Crown” </b>(Netflix)</p>
<a>Prince Charles</a> and all those diagnosed with COVID-19,
<a>“The Crown”</a> offers, among many other things, a unique take on isolation — even when you are stuck in a palace, life can be quite difficult.
<p><b>“The Bletchley Circle”</b> (Amazon) </p>
<p>Four women who <a>worked together cracking codes</a> at Bletchley Park reunite to commiserate about a woman’s life in post-WWII England — oh yeah, and find a killer. Spy craft and feminism. What better combination?</p>
<p><b>“Bramwell” </b>(BritBox) </p>
<p><b>“Collateral” </b>(Netflix) </p>
<a>Mulligan’s powerhouse talent.</a>
<div><div><p><a>Television</a></p><p> <a>Watching more TV than ever? Here are 5 shows worth your time this week</a> </p></div><p>The Times TV team recommends the five TV shows we’re watching this week — and that you should be too. </p></div>
<p><b>“Years and Years” </b>(HBO Go/Now)</p>
<p>Deeply disturbing and human in the very best way, Russell T. Davies’ <a>contemplation of a British family</a> moving slowly into a political apocalypse is a great reminder that the pandemic is not the only destructive force around.</p>
<p><b>“Ballykissangel” </b>(BritBox)</p>
<a>Colin Farrell,</a> James Nesbitt and David Harewood (which can make for a fun drinking game but only if you own an actual pint glass).
<p><b>“Cranford” </b>(BritBox) </p>
<p><b>“Pride and Prejudice” </b>(BritBox) </p>
<a>all the fuss over Colin Firth’s Mr. Darcy</a> in his translucent shirt, including the Bridget Jones book and film franchise and, if you can believe it,
<a>a statue installed in a London lake</a>, you would fear that this version of Jane Austen’s classic would collapse under its own pop cultural weight. But it doesn’t. Firth is terrific, Jennifer Ehle (currently
<p><b>“Killing Eve”</b> (Hulu)</p>
<p>If you somehow missed Sandra Oh as British intelligence officer <a>Eve Plastri</a> and her love/hate relationship with ruthless assassin Villanelle <a>(Jodie Comer),</a> now’s the chance to close the gaping wound in your cultural psyche. </p>
<p><b>The “Up” Series </b>(BritBox) </p>
<a>“63 Up,”</a> debuted in theaters late last year.
<p><b>“Broken” </b>(BritBox) </p>
<a>Haunting” and “heartbreaking”</a> does not even begin to cover it. (OK, OK, I’ve got a thing for shows about priests, and for the record, it started
<a>way before “Fleabag.”</a>)
<p><b>“Doc Martin” </b>(Acorn TV)</p>
<p>When fancy London surgeon Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes) suddenly grows faint at the sight of blood, he takes himself to the Cornish town of Portwenn. There he becomes the GP, and hilarity, pathos and personal growth ensue.</p>
<p><b>“Absolutely Fabulous” </b>(BritBox)</p>
<a>two very broken women</a> careening through midlife in a cloud of Champagne fumes and “sweetie darlings.” (See also “300 Years of French and Saunders,” also on BritBox.)
<p><b>“Miranda” </b>(Hulu) </p>
<a>slapstick and stereotypes</a>, but it’s impossible not to love Hart, who bumbles with the very best.
<p><b>“Gavin Stacey” </b>(BritBox)</p>
<a>Sweet and funny</a>, it deals with everyday life and love in often-skincrawlingly recognizable ways.
<p><b>“Crashing” </b>(Netflix)</p>
<p><b>“The Vicar of Dilbey” </b>(BritBox)</p>
<p><b>“QI” </b>(BritBox)</p>

<h1> NFL roundtable: Why Chargers didn’t collapse and Rams collapsed lowly Jaguars </h1>
<div><div> By Gary Klein, <div>Jeff Miller, Sam Farmer</div></div></div>
<a>biggest victory of the season</a>. The
<a>Rams</a> ended their losing streak at three games with a
<a>Gary Klein</a>, Chargers beat writer
<a>Jeff Miller</a> and NFL writer
<a>Sam Farmer</a> discuss what could come next:
<p><b>OK, let me start by asking this about the Chargers. Admit it. When the Chargers blew a 24-0 lead and were ahead 24-22, did you think L.A. was going to lose?</b></p>
<b>Klein:</b> Listen, with a quarterback like Justin Herbert are you
<div><p><a>Chargers</a></p><p> <a>Takeaways from Chargers’ win over Bengals: Joey Bosa could have returned </a> </p></div>
<p>What we learned from Chargers’ 41-22 road victory over the Bengals: Joey Bosa was cleared when checked for concussion but kept out as a precaution.</p>
<p><b>Chargers fans have grown accustomed to disturbing losses, collapses, weird plays ... over the years. Does anything seem different about this team compared to the Anthony Lynn teams the last few years?</b></p>
<p><b>Farmer: </b>Again, the Chargers were closers Sunday. That’s not to say they always will be, but this one goes in the confidence bank.</p>
<p><b>Do you think Sony Michel might have earned himself more snaps with his performance against Jacksonville, or is Darrell Henderson still going to get the bulk of the carries when healthy?</b></p>
<p><b>Yes, I know a win over Jacksonville is nothing to get too excited about, but what should Rams fans be especially encouraged about from that performance? </b></p>
<div><p><a>Rams</a></p><p> <a>What we learned from the Rams’ 37-7 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars</a> </p></div>
<p>Matthew Stafford is one tough guy. Odell Beckham Jr. is gaining confidence in the offense. Here’s what we learned from Rams’ win over Jacksonville. </p>
<p><b>If the Rams don’t beat Arizona next week, thoughts of an NFC West title are pretty much over. What makes you think the Rams can pull that off after already having lost to the Cardinals at home?</b></p>
<p><b>Miller:</b> This is the NFL in 2021. The Rams — and anyone else — could win as three-touchdown underdogs on Pluto. Well, OK, maybe not the Jaguars.</p>
<div><p><a>Rams</a></p><p> <a>Rams get back on their feet in win over Jaguars, but big test comes next in Arizona </a> </p></div>
<p>The Jaguars were the perfect remedy for the Rams, who were on a three-game slide. However, a lot of the season rides on next week’s game at Arizona.</p>
<p><b>Klein: </b>One game over .500 and you make the playoffs? Know that can happen. But that’s still kind of bogus.</p>
<p><b>Farmer: </b>I’m betting it takes 10 wins to get to the playoffs in the AFC.</p>

<h1> USC star Drake London chosen Pac-12 offensive player of the year despite missing games </h1>
<div><div> By Ryan KartjeStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>USC receiver <a>Drake London</a> was in the midst of his star turn when an Arizona defender <a>rolled over his right ankle</a> during a game in late October, stopping an extraordinary season in its tracks with four games left to play.</p>
<p>Yet even a broken ankle and a month away wouldn’t keep the Pac-12 from recognizing London as the conference’s offensive player of the year, an honor that never has gone to a player who missed as much of a season as London.</p>
