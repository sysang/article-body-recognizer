<p>Should you need to make a claim, the government-funded body <a>Consumer Direct has a template letter</a> you can download and send to your credit card provider.</p>
<p>The cover does not extend to items paid for with credit card cheques.</p>
<p>Purchases made on debit or prepaid cards or chargecards are not covered by section 75. Neither are purchases on credit cards that are worth less than £100 or more than £30,000. However, your card provider may offer chargeback.</p>
<p> The cover applies to Visa debit cards, prepaid cards and Visa Electron cards, and purchases made on a Visa credit card which don't qualify for section 75 cover</p>
<p> There is no upper limit on spending</p>
<p> Claims must be made to your bank, not to Visa</p>
<p>See the Visa factsheet (pdf) for more information.</p>
<p> The cover applies to Mastercard debit cards, prepaid cards and Maestro cards, and to purchases made on a Mastercard credit card which don't qualify for section 75 cover</p>
<p> There is a minimum spend of £10 but no upper limit on spending</p>
<p> There is a 120-day limit on claims which is "typically the expected delivery date of the goods or services not provided"</p>
<p> Claims must be made to your bank, not to Mastercard</p>
<p> The cover applies to transactions in the UK and overseas</p>
<p>American Express's scheme</p>
<p> The cover applies to American Express charge cards, and to purchases made on an American Express credit card which don't qualify for section 75 cover</p>
<p>These chargeback schemes are voluntary – unlike section 75 which is set in law – but do not be put off if the person you speak to at the bank claims to know nothing about them.</p>
<p>If you use your debit card to load your PayPal account and then use that account to make a purchase, you are unlikely to be able to use chargeback if there is a problem with that purchase.</p>
<p>The transaction is considered to take place the moment you load the PayPal account, not when you use that account to pay.</p>
<p>An annuity is simply a contract: your saved pot of “defined-contribution” pension money, built up over your working life, is traded for an annual income for life when you retire.</p>
<h2>Different types of annuity</h2>
<p>One thing that influences the monthly income you can get is the type of annuity you choose. Your main choices are:</p>
<p>RPI-linked annuity: At a hefty cost, your monthly payout will rise in line with inflation and protect you from losing your purchasing power. But you can end up with less if general prices begin to fall.</p>
<p>If your partner is a lot younger than you the original annuity payout will be smaller because of the increased chance of the partner living longer.</p>
<h2>Shop around and take the open-market option</h2>
<p>Comparing rates for your annuity can easily increase your income by a fifth. Use <a>the MAS annuity comparison tool</a> to compare rates from different providers.</p>
<p>You can always hedge your bets and buy more than one annuity: for example, you could spend £150,000 on an ordinary level annuity and £75,000 on an investment-linked annuity.</p>
<a>life expectancy is lower than average</a>l. On the other hand, residents of Kensington Chelsea could find themselves with much less as their life expectancy is greater.
<p>You no longer have to buy an annuity or go into income drawdown with your pension fund before your 75th birthday and, from April 2015, all restrictions on your access to your pension pot will be removed.</p>
<p>A personal loan involves borrowing a lump sum from a lender - usually a bank, building society or other financial service provider - which you agree to pay back, with interest, over a fixed period, usually between six months and 10 years. </p>
<p>If you want to borrow more than £25,000, you will need a secured loan. You will also need enough equity in your property to secure the loan. </p>
<p>Unless you choose a lender with a "one-size-fits-all" interest rate, factors including how much you want to borrow, how long you want to borrow it for and your personal and financial circumstances will all have an influence on how much you pay.</p>
<p>A bank has to have offered its typical APR (or a better rate) to at least 66% of potential customers.</p>
<p>Most loans are repaid in monthly instalments – usually by direct debit - over a period agreed before you get the money. The lender will tell you how much you need to pay each month when it agrees the loan. </p>
<p>Flexible loans, which let you borrow and pay back at will, are becoming more common, but the interest rate charged is often significantly higher. </p>
<p>If you miss a payment the lender will record the default on your credit file. Any new lender may not be put off by one or two missed payments, but if you have missed several you may struggle to get credit elsewhere. </p>
<p>The list of organisations offering loans is long and ranges from high street banks, to those that operate only on the internet or telephone, to building societies, credit unions, specialist loan companies and even doorstep lenders.</p>
<p>Most credit unions offer unsecured loans for up to five years and secured loans for up to 10 years.</p>
<h2>Getting into difficulty</h2>
<p>The best course of action is to get in touch with your lender immediately. <a>Banks and building societies</a> are often willing to help and might offer to freeze the loan temporarily or extend the repayment period.</p>
<p>Their ultimate aim is to recoup their money, but it is usually more advantageous, including cheaper, for them to reschedule your repayments than to take action against you.</p>
<p>It is particularly important to be upfront with your lender if you have a loan secured on your house or another asset, because if things go wrong you may have to sell up to pay back the loan.</p>
<h2>Organisations providing advice</h2>
<p><a>Consumer Credit Counselling Service</a>: a charity offering free, confidential advice for people in debt through its national telephone helpline - 0800 138 1111.</p>
<p><a>Citizens Advice Bureau</a>: free, impartial, confidential and face-to-face advice available via more than 3,000 outlets around the UK.</p>
<p><a>National Debtline</a>: telephone helpline on 0808 808 4000 providing free, confidential and independent advice on tackling debt.</p>
<p>An individual voluntary arrangement (IVA) - known as a protected trust deed in Scotland - offers a way of avoiding bankruptcy for people experiencing difficulty repaying unsecured debt. </p>
<p>If your creditors don't agree to an IVA, or you fail to keep to its terms, your creditors can apply to make you bankrupt instead.</p>
<h2>Who will know about my IVA?</h2>
<a> Insolvency Service</a>. Details of IVAs also appear on your credit file and remain there for six years or until the date the IVA ends if it lasts longer than six years.
<p>An IVA could be suitable if you are unable to agree - or keep to - an informal debt management arrangement. An IVA is likely to be unsuitable if you don't have the spare cash necessary to make what can be quite high monthly payments.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy offers people with debts that they cannot pay the opportunity to make a fresh start.</p>
<h2>What if I can't afford the bankruptcy fees?</h2>
<h2>Who will know about my bankruptcy?</h2>
<p>Details of your bankruptcy are published in the London Gazette and may appear in your local paper. Details of bankruptcy also appear on your credit file and remain there for six years. </p>
<h2>Is bankruptcy right for me?</h2>
<a> National Debtline</a>. A list of insolvency practitioners licensed to set up IVAs is available from the
<h2>StepChange Debt Charity (formerly CCCS)</h2>
<a>Debt Remedy tool</a>.Website:
<p>Free advice, debt management plans and individual voluntary arrangements through a service financed by the credit industry. Calls are answered 24 hours a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>When it comes to loans and mortgages, some lenders charge hefty upfront fees, and low interest rates, while others charge low fees and high interest rates.</p>
<h2>Annual percentage rate (APR)</h2>
<p>The APR tells you how much your borrowing will cost over the course of a year, as a proportion of the amount you have borrowed. So if you are borrowing £100 at an APR of 9%, you will pay £9 in interest and charges over the first year.</p>
<p>In a mortgage advert, the lender will usually quote a headline rate as well as the APR. Most lenders charge administration fees on mortgages, so APRs tend to be much higher than the headline rates.</p>
<h2>Equivalent annual rate (EAR)</h2>
<p>The calculations take into account the rate of interest being charged, how often it is charged, and the effect of compounding it - charging interest on interest - over the year.</p>
<h2>Annual equivalent rate (AER)</h2>
<p>The gross rate paid on an account offering monthly interest may be lower than the gross rate on an account offering only one interest payment a year, but when interest is compounded it may offer higher returns than the latter account. </p>
<p><a>Tax credits</a> were designed to lift millions of families out of poverty, but the system has been plagued by errors and controversy since it was launched in 2003 by the then chancellor Gordon Brown.</p>
<p>The child tax credit is a means-tested benefit paid to parents and carers who are responsible for at least one child under 16 living under their roof, or what HM Revenue Customs (HMRC) calls "a young person".</p>
<p>A child becomes a young person from 1 September after their 16th birthday, and will remain a "qualifying young person" up to their 20th birthday providing they are in full-time education or on an approved training course before they are 19. </p>
<p>You can't claim child tax credits for children at university or if they are claiming benefits, such as income support or income-based job seeker's allowance.</p>
<p>Child tax credit isn't just for the poorest families – households with an income of up to £50,000 are entitled to the full family element of the child tax credit. Those earning more get a reduced sum.</p>
<p>Couples have to make a joint tax credit claim - neither of them can claim as a single person. Where parents have split up and live separately the money should go to the person with whom the child normally lives.</p>
<p>Lone parents can also claim child tax credit. Parents or carers don't have to be in work to claim the money, which can be paid either weekly or every four weeks.</p>
<p>The <a>child tax credit</a> comes in two parts: a "family element" worth up to £545 a year, and a "child element" worth up to £2,235 for each child in the 2009/2010 tax year.</p>
<p>Families with a new baby can claim a further payment of up to £545 in the child's first year, and there are further payments for disabled children (£2,670) and severely disabled children (an extra £1,075).</p>
<p>To apply, call the tax credit helpline on 0845 300 3900. Lines are open from 8am to 8pm every day.</p>
<a>working tax credit</a> is designed to top up the earnings of people on low incomes, and the payouts are means tested. How much you get depends on how much you earn – you don't need children to qualify, although you might get more if you do have kids.
<p>Your age and the number of hours you work each week will also affect how much you get.</p>
<p>You can claim if you are aged 25 or over and working at least 30 hours a week. You can also claim from the age of 16 if you are responsible for at least one child, and are usually working at least 16 hours a week.</p>
<p>People aged 50 or over and working at least 16 hours a week can also claim if they are starting work after receiving benefits for at least six months.</p>
<p>The working tax credit is made up of a <a>number of different elements</a>:</p>
<p>As you can see, tax credits are complicated. HMRC offers an <a>online tax calculator</a> for people who want to work out how much they are likely to get.</p>
<p>To claim working tax credits call the tax credit helpline on 0845 300 3900 between 8am to 8pm.</p>
<p>Overpayments are actually an integral part of the tax credits system. Because they are means tested, your entitlement constantly changes in line with your income and other circumstances. </p>
<p>That's why your claims information must always be accurate and up to date. You must notify HMRC of any change in your circumstances within one month, as well as check award notices and point out any errors.</p>
<p>If you need more information regarding a claim or appeal, contact the tax credit helpline or your local <a>Citizens Advice bureau</a>. </p>
<p>Alternatively, <a>Community Legal Advice</a> offers free, confidential advice, as does charity <a>Taxaid</a>, which offers free advice, including on tax credits, for people on low incomes.</p>
<p>The state pension is a benefit paid by the government to people who have retired. To qualify you need to have paid national insurance (NI) contributions for a set number of years, or had them paid for you.</p>
<p>However, assuming the change is passed, the new state pension age is planned to increase as follows to:</p>
<p> 66 between November 2018 and October 2020 67 between 2026 and 2028 68 between 2044 and 2046</p>
<p>In the 2010-11 tax year the full state pension for a single person was worth up to £102.15 a week; for a couple the full pension is worth up to £204.30.</p>
<p>To get the full state pension you need to have built up a certain number of qualifying years depending on when you were born and whether you are male or female:</p>
<p> Men born before 6 April 1945 usually need 44 qualifying years. Women born before 6 April 1950 usually need 39 qualifying years. Men born after 5 April 1945 need 30 qualifying years. Women born after 5 April 1950 need 30 qualifying years.</p>
<p>You can opt to make up for a shortfall in your contributions to make sure you get a full state pension.</p>
<h2>Checking your entitlement </h2>
<p>You can also write to Retirement Pension Forecast and Advice Unit, Pensions and Overseas Directorate, Tyneview Park, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE98 1BA, or apply online at the Pension Service.</p>
<p>The government introduced pension credits in 2003 to combat pensioner poverty, replacing a similar benefit called the minimum income guarantee.</p>
<p>It is a means-tested benefit that guarantees a minimum weekly income of £137.35 for single pensioners and £209.70 for couples in 2011-12.</p>
<h2>Collecting your pension</h2>
<p>Your state pension, and any pension credits to which you are entitled, will be paid directly into your bank or building society account. </p>
<p>All pension payments are taxable.</p>

<p>Stamp duty is a tax charged by the government when you buy property or shares. There are different kinds of stamp duty, which apply to different purchases.</p>
<h2>Stamp duty on homes and land</h2>
<p>Stamp duty land tax (SDLT) is charged on the purchase of houses, flats and other land and buildings. The tax, often referred to simply as stamp duty, has existed in various forms since the 1690s.</p>
<p>The tax is currently graded into six bands and represents a percentage of a property’s purchase price. On properties costing up to £125,000 there is currently no duty to pay. After that there are five stamp duty tiers:</p>
<p> £125,000 – £250,000 = 1%</p>
<p> £250,001 – £500,000 = 3%</p>
<p>Selling a home can be a long and complex process, but there are certain steps you can follow to make it as smooth as possible.</p>
<h2>Find out how much your home is worth</h2>
<a>Zoopla</a>, or pay for a detailed report from
<a>Hometrack</a>. Remember that the final price it sells for will not necessarily be as much as the asking price.
<h2>Decide whether to use an estate agent</h2>
<p>You need to appoint a solicitor or conveyancer who will do the legal work involved in the sale. They will, for example, release details of the deeds to your buyer’s solicitors and draw up a contract of sale.</p>
<h2>Be prepared to let the buyer’s surveyor into your home</h2>
<h2>Renegotiate the price if necessary</h2>
<h2>Exchange contracts and decide on a completion date</h2>
<p>You will have to move out of the property on the day the sale completes, so it’s time to book a removal van and start packing.</p>

<p>Every week a Guardian Money reader submits a question, and it’s up to you to help him or her out – a selection of the best answers will appear in next Saturday’s paper.</p>
<p>Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU</p>
<p>If you aren't sure where you want to live, want to take on a renovation project or dream of living somewhere truly unique, there are other sites to help you in your search. Here are 15 of the best alternatives for buyers and tenants.</p>
<p>Zoopla has a similar facility. On its homepage you can "sort by" the "most reduced" properties in an advanced search.</p>
<p>Spotted any useful alternatives to Rightmove that we have missed? What are your favourite property-hunting websites? Tell us about your experiences.</p>
<p>Credit cards are available from a wide range of providers, from supermarkets to airlines and even charities.</p>
<p>Applying for a card is simple – applications can be made in a bank branch, on the phone, online or by post. To qualify for a card you will need to give information about where you live, how much you earn and what other credit cards you might have.</p>
<p>You should beware of only paying the minimum your provider asks for each month, as outstanding balances will attract interest and your debt can quickly grow.</p>
<p>As well as charging different rates, providers calculate interest from different times so it can be difficult to compare costs fairly.</p>
<p>The easiest option is to get a card from your bank, but it may not offer the best deal for your circumstances. Instead you should consider how you will use the card and look for one that suits your needs.</p>
<p>If you do not usually settle your account in full at the end of each month, opt for a card with a low interest rate on purchases. If you plan to make a big, one-off purchase it may be wise to look at cards with 0% introductory offers.</p>
<h2>Store cards and affinity cards</h2>
<p>Store cards are usually available at the point of sale and once a credit check and application form has been completed, which can take as little as 10 minutes, can be used to make a purchase.</p>
<p>Affinity cards are credit cards with an organisation’s logo on them. Usually the organisation will receive a preset donation when you make your first purchase with the card, often around £5, then smaller donations based on your subsequent spending.</p>
<p>These don’t tend to add up to much, and if the card has an uncompetitive interest rate, you may be better off choosing a cheaper card and making donations separately.</p>
<p>So, to paraphrase Kipling: how can you keep your head when all the buyers about you are losing theirs? Here are 10 things to consider before you rush to buy:</p>
<h2>What happens if interest rates rise?</h2>
<h2>The implications of your bid on your finances</h2>
<h2>The hassle of homeownership</h2>
<h2>Would a long-term tenancy make you feel as secure?</h2>
<h2>Widening your search area</h2>
<h2>Cutting out the middlemen</h2>
<h2>What is happening to prices in your chosen neighbourhood?</h2>
<h2>Is your mortgage lined up?</h2>
<h2>Estate agents are there to get as much as possible for the seller</h2>

<p><a>The state pension age rose to 66</a> last year, with two further rises planned, meaning that by 2046 those born on or after April 1977 would need to wait until 68 before they can draw the benefit.</p>
<p>However, the review will look at bringing forward that change by eight years, so that the increase is phased in between 2037 and 2039.</p>
<p>The state payment is paid to anyone who has made at least 10 years’ worth of national insurance contributions during their working lifetime. The maximum payment is £179.60 a week, but how much you get depends on how many years you contributed for.</p>
<p>The government is obliged to regularly re-evaluate the state retirement age, and it must publish the results of the latest review by 7 May 2023.</p>
<p>It said Britain’s ageing population meant it needed to make sure decisions on how to manage the cost of the state pension system were “robust, fair and transparent for taxpayers now and in the future”.</p>
<p>The review will also look at the way the pension age is set, and what data could be taken into account when deciding on a fair retirement age.</p>
<p>“It’s no wonder today’s younger workers have little faith in the state pension being there for them at all when they stop work, with many thinking they’ll end up working forever.”</p>
<p>One issue that has been raised by some critics of the current system is the impact of different life expectancy rates around the country.</p>
<p>A <a>recent report found</a> that while a man living in the London borough of Westminster could be expected to live until the age of 84.7 years, in Blackpool it would be 74.1 years.</p>
<p>The key architect of the government’s social care reform has said most older people needing care will lose out from plans to dilute protections against crippling costs in England, as Conservatives blamed Rishi Sunak for forcing the changes.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the care minister, Gillian Keegan, <a>announced</a> that state-funded care costs would not go towards the new £86,000 cap – announced by Boris Johnson in September – on the amount anyone in England would pay for social care.</p>
<p>It will save the government hundreds of millions of pounds but leave many poorer homeowners exposed to “catastrophic costs” including the need to sell their homes to cover long-term care, analysts have said.</p>
<p>Whitehall sources confirmed that budget constraints imposed by the Treasury were behind the shift, saying, “cost is absolutely a factor”.</p>
<p>Treasury sources insisted Sunak had not dictated the specific design of the cap, however, and it was up to the Department of Health and Social Care to decide how to use the proceeds of the £12bn-a-year health and social care levy.</p>
<p>Tory sources said when the news broke in Westminster late on Wednesday, a number of red wall MPs privately expressed outrage and frustration about how it would directly impact their voters. </p>
<p>“But the underlying problem is there anyway. It would be more sensible to have a flat percentage of assets that you protect.”</p>
<p>Dennis Reed, the director of Silver Voices, a UK-wide membership organisation that campaigns for the over-60s, urged the government to go back to the drawing board, labelling its plan “regressive in its impact on poorer households”.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of England’s poorest pensioners face paying the same for their old age care as wealthier people after the government published details of the new cap on home and care costs.</p>
<p>The move will save the government hundreds of millions of pounds but leave many poorer homeowners exposed to “catastrophic costs” including the need to sell their homes to cover long-term care, analysts said.</p>
<p>Amid a barrage of criticism on Wednesday night, Boris Johnson was warned that MPs in the so-called red wall could revolt when the changes are put to a vote.</p>
<a>focused on the scandal over MPs’ second jobs</a>, the Department of Health and Social Care said only private contributions would be counted.
<p>Labour said the government had “failed to be straight” with elderly people and described the care costs cap as a “con”. It said the announcement was “sneaked out today under a cloud of Tory sleaze”.</p>
<p>Torsten Bell, director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: “if you own a £1m house in the home counties, over 90% of your assets are protected. If you’ve got a terrace house in Hartlepool worth £70,000 you can lose almost everything.”</p>
<p>Analysts said the move could save the government hundreds of millions of pounds from the estimated £3bn cost of the cap, but the savings were being taken from people with low to moderate wealth not richer people.</p>
<p>The new approach will require amending the Care Act with parliamentary approval. The government said in an update published online that the “much more generous means test is the main means of helping people with lower levels of assets”.</p>

<p>A gold telephone saved from a skip has returned to the art deco bedroom for which it was commissioned eight decades ago by the socialite Virginia Courtauld.</p>
<p><a>English Heritage</a> on Friday announced that it had been given a telephone that spoke volumes about the glamorous, over-the-top lifestyle of the inhabitants of <a>Eltham Palace</a> in the Royal Borough of Greenwich, south London.</p>
<p>Courtauld and her husband, Stephen, were a millionaire couple who, in 1933, alighted on a medieval palace in Eltham and saw it as the perfect doer-upper that was both semi-rural and in easy reach of central <a>London</a>.</p>
<p>It was fitted out with all the new technology, including electric fires, a loudspeaker system broadcasting records to rooms on the ground floor, a private internal telephone exchange and <a>a huge centralised vacuum cleaner</a>.</p>
<p>At a time when most people had coal or wood fires, the Courtaulds had hot water pipes heating ceilings, floors and the first-floor quarters of <a>Virginia’s pet ring-tailed lemur, Mah-Jongg</a>, or Jongy.</p>
<p>Everything had to be fabulous, including <a>her ensuite bathroom</a>, which was lined with gold mosaic and onyx, gold-plated bath taps and a marble statue of the the Greek god Psyche.</p>
<p>Courtauld commissioned five gold telephones for the bedrooms and they were used until she and her husband moved out in 1944, fed up with the bombing.</p>
<p>The lease of the house was passed to the Army Educational Corps which became the Royal Army Educational Corps (RAEC). It moved out in the 1980s and in the process all the phones, evidently left by the Courtaulds, were thrown away.</p>
<p>Fortunately a sharp-eyed RAEC member spotted the gold phone in a skip, retrieved it and has now donated it to English <a>Heritage</a>, which looks after the palace.</p>
<p>Olivia Fryman, English Heritage’s curator of collections and interiors, said it was a wonderful donation and the only surviving gold telephone that belonged to the Courtaulds.</p>

<p>The bean poles and pea sticks are still up. Ghostly, empty now of summer. Strung with fading nasturtiums, defiant of winter for few days more.</p>
<p>I am holding on to their height and memories. Echoes of the growing season. Dialled-down reminders of what was.</p>
<p>The sunflowers are pulled, broken tree-trunk stems tidied away. The seeds have been mostly saved or eaten by birds. The rest are aged, darkened, mildewed.</p>
<p>The neighbour’s last apples are fallen. The giant cardoons have collapsed, their seed heads exploded on the ground. The loss more recent. November is a crueller month.</p>
<p>Dishes of drying seed are scattered through the house. The communal shed is cluttered, dark and damper now. Our seed needs warm and dry.</p>
<p>I have been focusing on tagetes. A new stream of first-generation flowers, dead heads gathered in the damp morning – stuffed into my pockets. I gently lay them on kitchen roll on my return.</p>
<p>I try not to make a mess; keep the shallow bowls from overflowing. I get they mean more to me than to other people in the house.</p>
<p>Seed-saving came to us by happy accident, at the start of our gardening here; from masters of the craft passing through on their way to the far west of Ireland.</p>
<p>I mourn that it’s harder now to get seed from friends from their trips: Andrew and Sarah at Adaptive Seeds in Oregon; Madeline and Holly at Brown Envelope Seeds in Cork. Until it eases, our saved seed will overflow. </p>

<p>Plants don’t need much to be happy.</p>
<p>There are plenty of liquid fertilisers that you can buy from hardware stores and garden retailers, though in true DIY frugal gardener fashion, you can easily make your own for next to nothing.</p>
<p>Here are three simple natural fertilisers for you to try making. All you’ll need is an old pillow case that you’re happy to sacrifice to the cause, a 20 litre food-grade plastic bucket, and weeds, aged manure or seaweed.</p>
<p>What happens to all the weeds that you pull from your garden? Weeds are excellent miners of minerals from the soil, and while they can be composted or fed to the chooks, they also make excellent source material for a homemade fertiliser tea.</p>
<p>After that, you can use it to water the garden by diluting it to one part weed tea to 10 parts water. Once the weeds have decomposed, feed them to the worms or the chooks, or pop them on the compost heap.</p>
<p>By using the manure to make a ‘tea’, you can gain all the nutritional benefit with none of the risk. All you need to do is stuff your pillow case ‘teabag’ with the aged manure, pop it in the bucket and fill the bucket with water.</p>
<p>Let the tea steep for two weeks, then dilute the liquid in a ratio of one part manure tea to 15 parts water. After you’ve used the liquid, simply add the leftover manure to your compost.</p>
<p>If you count yourself among the many Australians who live within a short drive to the coast, the next time you visit keep your eyes open along the sandy stretches for washed-up seaweed.</p>
<p>If your curry tree does exceptionally well and you find yourself with more growth than you have space for, they respond well to cutting back hard. The leaves can be dried or frozen. Home-dried leaves are much more pungent than shop-bought ones.</p>
<p>There is a ruthlessness to some roof terrace gardening that doesn’t sit well with me. I try to bend with it, but it doesn’t always work. It’s too often gardening without growing. Planting in pots requiring culling.</p>
<p>Our autumn terrace was mostly about blues – tall lobelia and even taller salvia. Impulse buys from my local garden centre to replenish fading spring/summer.</p>
<p>We’ll take cuttings à la Monty Don. November is when we hear the siren call of spring bulbs. And we have a limited amount of space.</p>
<p>The Danish spring show will be narcissi in greater numbers and on a broader palette. There’ll be no tulips as deer culled 98% of the 200-plus we planted last time. They particularly liked the stems, but left the narcissi alone.</p>
<p>We love to see families of deer trot through, so we’re trialling planting only from the daffodil family. I’ll report back in spring. Fingers until then firmly crossed.</p>

<p>They require low-to-medium indirect light, and protection from direct sun.</p>

<h2>How do I keep it alive?</h2>
<p>They are surprisingly hardy and weatherproof if given sunny, free-draining conditions. They will be happy in a big container, which makes them excellent for patios and balcony gardens. Once settled in, they will return year after year.</p>
<p>It’s not the cold over winter that bothers them, but the wet. If you are on anything other than sand or silt, dig in grit and well-rotted homemade compost to the planting hole.</p>
<p>They are easygoing sorts; a little staking and keeping an eye out for slugs is about all that is needed.</p>

<p>The basic theory behind wicking beds is that the water is stored in an airtight reservoir underneath the soil, and it “wicks” up through the soil to the roots above as the plants transpire moisture through their leaves.</p>
<p>Depending on its size, the reservoir can keep the soil moist for up to 10 days. It virtually eliminates evaporation from the soil and removes the chance of leaf scald, which can occur when you water your plants from above.</p>
<p>Everything you need to make one can be picked up from a hardware store.</p>
<h2>How to make a wicking bed</h2>
<p>Equipment you’ll need (the lengths will depend on the size of your garden bed):</p>
<li><p>A raised garden bed that features a firm frame</p></li>
<li><p>Brickies sand (very fine sand), enough to cover the base of your garden bed to a depth of 50mm</p></li>
<li><p>Food-grade plastic sheeting, enough to line the entire garden bed, all the way to the top</p></li>
<li><p>Two lengths of 50mm slotted agricultural pipe, one long enough to reach one-third of the length of your garden bed; the other long enough to reach the entire length of the bed</p></li>
<li><p>50mm poly pipe, enough to reach from the top to the bottom of your garden bed</p></li>
<li><p>25mm poly pipe, enough to reach half the height of your garden bed</p></li>
<li><p>A poly elbow, to join the shorter piece of 50mm slotted agricultural pipe to the 25mm poly pipe</p></li>
<li><p>Sealant, to seal the agricultural pipe in place</p></li>
<li><p>14mm construction aggregate (blue metal gravel), enough to fill the bottom half of your garden bed</p></li>
<li><p>Geotextile fabric, enough to cover the entire base of the garden bed</p></li>
<li><p>High-quality topsoil, enough to fill the top half of your garden bed</p></li>
<li><p>Mulch (pea straw or lucerne straw), enough to cover the top of your garden bed to a depth of 50mm</p></li>
<h2>Step 1: Set up your raised bed</h2>
<p>Make sure the base of the garden bed is clear of anything sharp. Consider covering the base with a layer of brickies sand, just in case. You could also use some old carpet.</p>
<p>Then spread the food-grade plastic evenly across the base and up the sides, ensuring that it reaches almost to the top of the garden bed. If your plastic is thin, you could double it over before using it.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Insert the overflow pipe</h2>
<h2>Step 4: Form the water reservoir</h2>
<h2>Step 5: Check for leaks</h2>
<p>Add water to the garden bed through the inlet pipe, and leave it overnight to see if there are any leaks.</p>
<h2>Step 6: Insert the geotextile fabric</h2>
<p>Pour in the topsoil. To keep your soil rich and healthy, ensure that you add approximately 10cm of fresh compost to the garden bed each year before planting.</p>
<p>There has been an absence of working parties in the past year or so, since Covid came at us. Many of our gardeners have mostly stayed away. In their absence the wild has crept back, their plots conquered, quickly reclaimed.</p>
<p>The more determined garden souls hung on. Patches of cultivation shining among the fallen apples, the tall nettles, the ever-longer grass. There have been rows of salads. There has been summer squash and corn. A few plots with climbing bean poles.</p>
<p>One or two others scattered flower seed in spring. A neighbouring plot was bright with beds of cosmos, calendula and other annuals. Another simply sowed poppies. Though they’ve all faded now in the cooler nights.</p>
<p>Mary, a part of whose large plot we also work, has been constant. A gifted and determined grower, there are always runner beans, giant sunflowers, tomatoes, garlic, chillies, courgettes and pumpkins of many kinds.</p>
<p>Recently she was in need of help with some late-season tidying and packing away. So come one Sunday, Howard and I turn up with power tools and sharp spades.</p>
<p>There are prized plants to re-home, echoes of previous years to be potted. Patiently waiting on their new space. There is a fruit cage to be cleared and stashed away.</p>
<p>There is real pleasure is heavier garden work sometimes. Taking down structures for winter. Clearing and preparing for another spring.</p>

<p>Many varieties of lemons will flower year-round, particularly four seasons and eureka, which are two of the easiest to grow. As lemons are self-fertile, as long as you mist the flowers to help them set, there’s a chance of fruit.</p>
<p>The lemons themselves can take up to a year to ripen and thus you have to keep on top of watering – too little, or a sudden temperature change, and the fruit (and leaves) will drop off.</p>
<a>Dr Forest’s</a> general-purpose feed (it’s excellent for other houseplants too), which is organic, made here in the UK, and full of good stuff.
<p>Anyway, time to (mostly) down tools. Hang a few bird feeders if you haven’t already. They’ll thank you for it and it’s a joy to see. A source of fresh water would be good, too, if possible.</p>
<p>It’s the month for some armchair gardening. To perhaps look back over the year. Think about what worked and what didn’t do so well. What you might try differently in 2022. Time to think about seed.</p>
<p>I will scour favoured catalogues and seed sites. Attempt to be more ruthless with some of the more ancient out-of-date packets I keep almost as totems. I tell myself I will find a home for them on the plot sometime.</p>
<p>There are bulging bags of poppy, calendula and nasturtium seed I’ll share with Kala for her garden, even though she has been collecting her own through the year. Some, we’ll take with us to the summerhouse as we reclaim more borders there.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Australian broadcaster and ardent gardener Peter Cundall died aged 94.</p>
<p>After immigrating to Australia he spent close to five decades fielding gardening questions on talkback radio, from 1967 until 2018; as well as writing extensively on gardening.</p>
<p>An early convert to organic gardening, he helped establish the Organic Gardening and Farming Society of Tasmania in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Share your fondest memories and favourite gardening tips from Peter Cundall in the comments.</p>
<p>There’s maybe nothing as naked as a winter larch. Like a sphinx cat, at first it looks wrong, as if there is something missing – newly bald, needle-less.</p>
<p>The journey here, though, is remarkable. The baby-soft new green in spring. The metamorphosis in autumn. Oranges, yellows, branches like fluffy tiger tails.</p>
<p>I planted two tiny saplings in Denmark 14 years ago. They are giants now. We are here for a quick week to see my mother-in-law, in remission from being poorly. The pain has for now near-miraculously gone.</p>
<p>The nasturtiums have spread out like extravagant octopuses. Multi-limbed, luxuriant, jewelled with dew. Most of the trees have long turned; the last hanging leaves coloured old gold and rust.</p>
<p>The twin oaks have dumped countless barrowloads. Smothering, leathery. My hands blister with gathering some of it up. The grass too long, dotted with herb robert and other flowers.</p>
<p>Henri’s hands are blistered, too: from planting narcissi bulbs. It’s dry, so we fix the mower at its highest setting. Henri trims. It works. We spread some of the broken leaf on the borders.</p>
<p>We have a polecat that moves into the roof most winters. I reluctantly block its most obvious path and scatter broken-up fat balls to placate the pheasant who shrieks indignantly under the hanging feeders.</p>
<p>We still need to thin out random cherry trees, bird-sown. But that will wait until we are back, at Christmas.</p>

<p>The sale of peat to gardeners in England and Wales is to be banned by 2024 under plans published by the government on Saturday. Ministers said they also aimed to end peat use in the professional horticulture sector by 2028.</p>
<p>The government set a voluntary target in 2011 for compost retailers to end sales of peat by 2020. But peat use fell by only 25% from 2011-2019 and increased by 9% in 2020 as Covid lockdowns boosted gardening as a hobby.</p>
<p>Pow said the weaker measures were included because “in a consultation, it is best to be fully informed with as much evidence and data as we can have, and some people in the industry are still pressing for other potential routes”.</p>
<a>Bord na Móna ended all peat extraction in 2020</a>, although its reserves are still being sold. Some big retailers of peat have implemented their own bans, including Dobbies and the Co-op in 2021, and BQ by 2023.
<p>About 70% of peat is sold to gardeners and 30% is used by professional growers. The government estimates a ban on both uses would cut CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 4m tonnes in the next two decades.</p>
<sub>2</sub> a year. In May, ministers announced a
<a>£50m plan to restore 35,000 hectares of peatland</a> by 2025, about 1% of the UK’s total. “It’s a really positive start,” said Pow, saying that these investments leveraged other funds focused on water management and increasing biodiversity.
<p>Big companies do not support diversity. And yet that is exactly what we need. Who knows what the perfect squash might be in 100 years’ time? The only way we can ensure future gardeners have a wider library of genes to draw on is to do it ourselves. </p>
