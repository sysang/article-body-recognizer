<h1>Britain’s falling birthrate will damage our society – and it’s not just Covid to blame</h1>

<p>At least 34,000 women in Poland are known to have sought abortions illegally or abroad since the country introduced a <a>near total ban on terminations</a> a year ago.</p>
<a>80 to 200,000 women a year </a>sought illegal abortions under Poland’s old abortion laws, which still tightly restricted the conditions under which women could seek terminations.
<a>Poland</a> to Belgium, Germany, Spain and the Czech Republic to access legal abortions.
<p>Of those who sought its services in the 12 months since the legislation was announced, AWB says at least 18,000 women were helped by its affiliate group <a>Women Help Women</a>, an organisation that facilitates postal access to abortion pills.</p>
<a>are facing “incalculable harm”</a> due to the new abortion legislation.
<a>Federation for Women and Family Planning</a> (Federa) in Poland, one of the groups that contributed to the report.
<p>Abortion has always been tightly controlled in Poland, and was banned until 1932, when the law changed to allow legal abortion for medical reasons or in cases of rape or incest.</p>
<a>a wave of national protests</a>, with thousands of women and girls across the country dressed in black taking to the streets in a national strike. An estimated 100,000 people demonstrated against the new legislation in Warsaw.
<a>abortion access in America</a>, Republicans on Sunday expressed confidence that the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision would soon be overturned, paving the way for a raft of anti-abortion legislation around the country next year.
<p>On Wednesday, the supreme court heard arguments over a <a>Mississippi</a> law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p><a>Observers suggested</a> that the conservative supermajority on the court appeared poised to uphold the law and potentially go further by overturning Roe, which protects a woman’s right to choose. A decision is not expected until June next year.</p>
<p>He also confirmed that if the landmark ruling was overturned entirely, Mississippi would enforce a ban on almost all abortions in the state under a so-called “trigger law”.</p>
<p>“That is a yes,” Reeves said when asked if he would enforce the “snap-back” legislation.</p>
<p>“Because if you believe as I believe very strongly that that innocent, unborn child in the mother’s womb is in fact a child, the most important word when we talk about unborn children is not unborn, but it’s children.”</p>
<p>The position is not representative of the majority of Americans. According <a>to recent polling</a>, seven in 10 are opposed to overturning Roe v Wade <a>while 59% believe</a> abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances.</p>
<a>21 US states are certain</a> to attempt some form of ban on abortion should Roe be overturned, using laws already on the books.
<p>He also noted that any decision would not lead to a national ban but could permit states to make their own determinations.</p>
<p>Indiana has enacted 55 abortion restrictions and bans in the past decade, according to the Guttmacher Institute, but does not have a “trigger law” or equivalent on the books.</p>
<p>It is listed by the institute as one of five states without these laws that are still likely to move towards almost total bans should Roe be overturned.</p>
<p>“When it comes to things like abortion, I think it’s clear it’s time to turn it back to the states,” Braun told NBC.</p>
<p>Since former president Donald Trump installed three conservative justices to the supreme court in just four years, both sides of the fight over abortion rights have been preparing for a legal showdown.</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, campaign finance data reveals that pro-abortion-access groups donated $8m in 2018 and more than $10m in 2020.</p>
<p>Those numbers outpace the public contributions of anti-abortion groups, which donated $2.6m in 2018 and $6.3m in 2020, according to data.</p>
<p>But the complexity of the network of non-profits and “dark money” funds makes it difficult to produce a full accounting of the money flows.</p>

<p>Britain is facing a “baby shortage” that could lead to “long-term economic stagnation”, a thinktank has said.</p>
<p>The <a>Social Market Foundation</a> (SMF) said the birthrate was almost half what it was at its postwar peak in the 1960s, and the country’s ageing population could lead to economic decline.</p>
<p>The birthrate in England and Wales peaked in 1964 when the number of children per woman averaged 2.93. Last year it was 1.58, well below the 2.1 replacement level needed to keep the population rate stable, and in Scotland it was even lower at 1.29.</p>
<p>“Pronatalism” is the policy or practice of encouraging the bearing of children, especially through government support of a higher birthrate.</p>
<p>“At present, there are a little under three over-65s for every 10 workers, but by the middle of the next decade that ratio will rise to 3.5, and by the 2060s the number will be closing in on four,” the report said.</p>
<p>“According to these projections, by 2050 a quarter of Britons will be over 65, up from a fifth today.</p>
<p>The report recommends the creation of a cross-departmental taskforce to ensure that when policies are being set, ministers take into account what impact they might have on population growth.</p>
<p>Dr Aveek Bhattacharya, the chief economist at the SMF and one of the report’s authors, said: “The question of whether the government should intervene to try to increase the birthrate is clearly a sensitive topic that must be delicately handled.</p>
<p>“However, given the alarming fall in fertility rates, and the risks that population ageing poses to our social and economic wellbeing, it is a discussion we should not duck.”</p>

<p>Australia has the most highly educated and skilled prime age female labour force in the OECD. Last month the ABS reported 50% of young women aged 25 to 34 have a university degree.</p>
<p>Governments and employers are starting to prioritise women’s labour force participation, seeing it as the most effective way to boost productivity and to drive the Covid recovery.</p>
<p>But our labour markets, our employment options and our care systems are not yet fit for purpose.</p>
<p>Lockdown mandated work from home for about one-third of the labour force. The sky did not fall in!</p>
<p>Now is the time to be asking employees about the types of flexibility they want to make use of and to put in place the systems and the technology that will make it possible.</p>
<a>Women</a> will flourish in good secure roles.
<p>Action by business and government in these five vital areas will lay the foundation to “build back better” for gender equality in 2022.</p>
<p>Women were doing 21 hours more unpaid work than men a week and experiencing higher levels of psychological distress in the year before the pandemic, a new report has found.</p>
<p>The annual Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (Hilda) survey is a nationally representative study involving interviews with 17,500 people in 9,500 households.</p>
<p>While household incomes were rising again after years of stagnation, the national snapshot shows poverty was also increasing, and two groups that would be hit hard by the pandemic were already disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Women and young people both reported poorer mental health, while the former were lumped with more of the burden of unpaid work, and younger people were already finding it harder to crack into the labour market.</p>
<p>In 2019, women were doing far more unpaid work than men, the study found, with the gap being particularly large in heterosexual couples with dependent children.</p>
<p>Over the life of the Hilda survey that gap has narrowed, from women doing 28.8 hours a week more unpaid labour than men in 2002 to 20.9 hours in 2019.</p>
<p>That’s partly due to men picking up slightly more of the load – they reported 27.8 hours in 2019 up from 24.7 hours in 2002. But researchers say it’s mostly due to women doing slightly less: 48.7 hours in 2019, down from 53.5 hours in 2002.</p>
<p>Housework was found to be the largest form of unpaid work, followed by caring for children, with the amount of unpaid work escalating sharply after the birth of a first child.</p>
<p>“Women with young children are the most time-stressed and you can see why,” said the report’s author Prof Roger Wilkins. </p>
<p>The report also paints a worrying picture of Australians’ mental health, with 23% of women and 19% of men reporting psychological distress in 2019.</p>
<p>In the study, participants were asked a series of questions including whether they had felt tired out for no good reason, nervous, restless, depressed or worthless, among other things.</p>
<p>Dr Ferdi Botha, one of the authors of the report, said that while some of the increase may be attributed to a better general understanding of mental health, it was still a “surprisingly large” jump in prevalence.</p>
<p>“Definitely the stigma around mental illness has declined a lot, so we think there’s a greater tendency for people to be willing to report that they are struggling,” Botha said. </p>
<p>“However, social contact frequency was one of the strongest predictors of distress by far. People are becoming more socially isolated, and we do know there are increasing trends in loneliness. It’s a known predictor of anxiety and depression.”</p>
<p>It was important to look at the relationship between economic circumstances and mental health, too, said Botha, with the study showing a correlation between higher income and lower likelihood of psychological distress. </p>
<h2>Incomes, inequality and poverty</h2>
<p>Overall, median household disposable incomes have increased by $2,116 since 2017, reaching $84,243 in 2019 – the first time median disposable incomes have exceeded 2009 levels.</p>
<p>Wilkins said one of the most concerning economic trends emerging from the <a>latest survey was a reduction in income mobility</a>, which refers to one’s ability to improve their economic position relative to others.</p>
<p>On a year-to-year basis, Hilda found 32.2% of those in the lowest income quintile were likely to move up in economic position between 2001 and 2006, compared with 30.9% between 2013 and 18.</p>
<p>“People are increasingly finding themselves stuck in a poverty trap,” Wilkins said, blaming the rate of welfare payments.</p>
<p>At the same time, those in the top bracket were more likely to remain in the highest income quintile: the proportion who remained there rose from 70.% in 2001-2006 to 74% in 2013-2018.</p>
<p>Over the life of the study, relative poverty rates have fluctuated, from a peak of 13.2% in 2007 to 9.8% in 2016.</p>
<p>But since then they have increased again each year, hitting 11.3% in 2019.</p>
<p>Poverty levels are expected to fall in next year’s survey, given the federal government briefly doubled unemployment benefits during the pandemic.</p>
<h2>Households and families</h2>
<p>Hilda also found young people are living at home for longer, with a rise in the number of women between the ages of 18 to 25 still living with their parents.</p>
<p>In 2019, 72% of women aged 18 to 21 and 50% of women aged 22 to 25 lived with their parents, up from 67.7% and 32.3% respectively in 2001.</p>
<p>Wilkins said that in general young people were less likely to be in full-time work, while university graduates were finding their incomes remaining stagnant when they did enter the workforce.</p>
<p>In the end, of course, I loved every second of the concert, ending the evening teary and tight-throated (hopefully emotion not Omicron). It was a pinprick of bright joy in the darkness, just like the best carols.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people crammed into a US carrier in a desperate attempt to escape after Taliban forces took control of the capital</p>
<p>An extraordinary image has emerged showing hundreds of Afghans packed into a US military cargo plane, in a desperate attempt to flee Kabul after the fall of the capital to the <a>Taliban</a>.</p>
<p>The picture obtained by US defence and security news site <a>Defense One</a> shows 640 people crammed into a C-17 Globemaster III, among the highest number of people ever carried in such an aircraft.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for US Central Command said the passengers on the flight – among them women and children – were safely evacuated from Kabul to Qatar on Sunday.</p>
<p>The flight had not intended to take such a large load but some panicked Afghans pulled themselves on to the C-17’s half-open ramp, Defense One reported.</p>
<p>The flight was one of several that was able to take off with hundreds onboard, and others may have carried even more passengers.</p>
<p>The desperation of many other Afghans was seen at Kabul airport on Monday as people clung to the side <a>of moving military planes</a> and at least two apparently fell to their deaths from the undercarriage soon after takeoff.</p>
<p>Video footage showed hundreds of people running alongside a military carrier as it travelled along the runway.</p>
<p>The airport – secured by the <a>US military</a> – was the only feasible route out after the Islamist group took control of the country’s land borders.</p>
<p>But US forces had to shut down the airport on Monday in an effort to contain the chaos and crowds. The airport reopened in the early hours of Tuesday, a US general said, adding that US personnel were now in charge of air traffic control.</p>
<p>The mission, he said, had never been about nation building but counter-terrorism, a threat that has now “metastasised” well beyond Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Biden had inherited a deal from Trump to withdraw forces by 1 May, he added, leaving him with a choice to either follow through belatedly on the agreement or escalate the conflict by sending thousands of troops into combat.</p>
<p>The Taliban swept into Kabul on Sunday after President Ashraf Ghani fled the country, ending two decades of a failed experiment to import western-style liberal democracy. </p>
<p>As harrowing scenes played out on television – including desperate Afghans clinging to <a>a US transport plane before takeoff</a> – the White House has scrambled to explain how the government there collapsed so quickly.</p>
<p>Biden acknowledged that the scenes unfolding in Afghanistan are “gut-wrenching”, particularly for veterans and anyone who has spent time on the ground there.</p>
<p>“We gave them every chance to determine their own future. We could not provide them with the will to fight for that future,” Biden said.</p>
<p>Biden said: “We’ll continue to speak out for the basic rights of the Afghan people, of women and girls, just as we speak out all over the world.”</p>
<p>He walked away without taking press questions and returned to Camp David. </p>
<p>Republicans drew comparisons to the humiliating departure of US forces from Saigon in Vietnam in 1975.</p>
<p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, described it as “a shameful failure of American leadership” and warned that “the likelihood that al-Qaida will return to plot attacks from Afghanistan is growing”.</p>
<p>He added: “Terrorists and major competitors like China are watching the embarrassment of a superpower laid low.”</p>
<p> Trump’s deal with the Taliban last year sought to pull forces out even earlier and even to invite the militants to Camp David while snubbing the Afghan government. </p>
<p>Polls have long shown strong public support for ending America’s longest war. </p>
<p>We never cared that much in the first place.”</p>

<a>Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar</a> admitted in a video statement in the evening. Now the group faces the challenge of ruling, he added. They are expected to proclaim a new Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan soon.
<a>Taliban</a> rule had effectively begun. Taliban commanders started the day so confident of victory that after their fighters surrounded the capital, they ordered them to stay outside the city and wait.
<p>It is expected to be used to declare a new Islamic Emirate, more than two decades after the group had established its first one, and TV footage showed Taliban fighters roaming its rooms and taking down flags to replace with their own standard.</p>
<p>Remnants of the Afghan government travelled to Qatar to meet Taliban representatives in a bid to win assurances on a peaceful transfer of power, treatment of refugees and a promise of a ban on reprisals.</p>
<p>But a US mandate that once aimed to rebuild Afghanistan had been reduced to trying to get all staff, and Afghan allies who had made the sometimes random cut, out of the country before a full Taliban takeover.</p>
<p>The exodus of those who could get out began early, after the insurgents captured the eastern city of Jalalabad, the last major centre held by the government, and the nearby border crossing with Pakistan.</p>
<p>“The Taliban have won with the judgment of their swords and guns, and are now responsible for the honour, property and self-preservation of their countrymen,” Ghani wrote.</p>
<p>On Friday they captured the second and third largest cities, southern Kandahar and western Herat, and on Saturday the northern stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif fell.</p>
<p>It then seemed a question of when, rather than if, the Taliban would take Kabul but even so the speed of Sunday’s collapse was stunning. A <a>US intelligence estimate</a> just last week had said Kabul could hold out for at least three months.</p>
<p>Over years of peace talks brokered by the US, Taliban negotiators have promised to respect women’s rights under Islam, but refused to be drawn on details. And in areas they control women already have limited education, work and freedom of movement.</p>
<a>erasing photos of women in wedding dresses</a> and women were bracing for a very different life. “I have felt very sad today; it was unbelievable for me that the Taliban were back in Kabul,” said Hawa. “They will not respect our freedom.”

<p>A summary of recent developments:</p>
<li>The US Air Force has said it is investigating the circumstances surrounding human remains that were found in the wheel well of one of its C-17s that flew out of Kabul amid the chaos of the Taliban takeover of the Afghan capital</li>
<p>More detail on the situation at Kabul airport. </p>
<p>US Central Command’s General Frank McKenzie has issued a statement saying the airfield has been secured and warning the Taliban they would be met with “overwhelming force” should they interfere with evacuation missions.</p>
<p>Currently, the airfield is secure and now open to civilian air traffic operating under visual flight rules.</p>
<p>In meetings with Taliban senior leaders in Doha on Sunday, I cautioned them against interference in our evacuation, and made it clear to them that any attack would be met with overwhelming force in the defence of our forces.</p>
<p>Members of the Hazara community in Australia have said the capture of the Afghan capital by the Taliban has re-traumatised them and left many terrified for their families still in Kabul.</p>
<p>It comes as parts of the capital Kabul, and in particular the airport, descended into chaos as residents desperate to get out of the country scrambled to find an escape.</p>
<p>The exodus from Kabul continues. Aryana Sayeed, one of Afghanistan’s biggest music stars, has taken an evacuation flight out of the capital.</p>
<p>“I am alive and well and, after a couple of unforgettable nights, have reached Doha,” she posted online.</p>
<p>“I hope and pray, as a result of the recent changes, at the very least my beautiful people will be able to start living a peaceful life without the fear of suicide bombers and explosions.”</p>
<p>UK home secretary Priti Patel has called on other nations to help take in Afghan refugees, according to an article in the Daily Telegraph newspaper.</p>
<p>Britain on Tuesday announced plans to welcome up to 5,000 Afghans fleeing the Taliban during the first year of a new resettlement programme that will prioritise women, girls and religious and other minorities.</p>
<p>Major Fox, 42, said any promises from the Taliban not to take revenge against those that had helped the British and Americans as “pure lies”.</p>
<p>“They are monsters and they are simply trying to get the west on side with their takeover,” he said. “What they are saying doesn’t match anything at all that I am hearing about on the ground and people messaging me from Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>An Afghan interpreter has pleaded with the UK government to help the families “who offered their sons when your sons needed help” in the fight against terror.</p>
<p>He told the PA news agency: “That nation (Afghanistan) had lost all hope when it was under the Taliban regime, they were only alive, they weren’t living.</p>
<p>“But the international community came, they gave them hope, they gave them dreams, they started living with humanity, and then suddenly you pull out the rug from under their feet and leave them alone like that.</p>
<p>“To the audience here in the UK please, support these interpreters and their families, their parents, their siblings, those who have offered their sons when your sons needed help.</p>
<p>“We supported you in that war against terror, many of us carry mental and physical scars.”</p>
<h2>20,000 Afghans to be given refuge in UK</h2>
<p>Some 20,000 Afghans are to be welcomed to the UK in coming years as the government unveiled the details of a scheme to provide sanctuary for those most at risk of persecution by the Taliban.</p>
<p>The prime minister, who will address MPs on Wednesday on the crisis in Afghanistan, said: “We owe a debt of gratitude to all those who have worked with us to make Afghanistan a better place over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>However, opposition parties have said the plans do not go far enough and are too vague to make a difference.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson has stressed to US president Joe Biden the importance of preserving the gains made in Afghanistan, Downing Street said.</p>
<p>“The prime minister stressed the importance of not losing the gains made in Afghanistan over the last 20 years, of protecting ourselves against any emerging threat from terrorism and of continuing to support the people of Afghanistan.</p>
<p> John Bolton, former national security adviser to Donald Trump and the US ambassador to the UN under George W Bush, said the Taliban was “not making a very convincing case” that they would stick to human rights pledges.</p>
<p>Bolton told Channel 4 News: “I think right now the Taliban have their smiley faces on because they’ve had good western public relations advice and they won’t get back to slitting throats until everybody’s out of Hamid Karzai International Airport.</p>

<p>Both Patel and Khan have chosen in the first instance to ask for an explanation, with Khan criticising the actions of the force he oversees.</p>
<p>Both main parties want to appear pro-police, but heavyweights from across the political spectrum spoke out as pictures of male officers clashing with women at a vigil for Everard flooded across mainstream and social media.</p>
<p>Some considering her fate were taken aback by the Met’s statement issued shortly before 1am on Sunday in which the Met appeared to blame those attending the vigil.</p>
<p>Assistant commissioner Helen Ball said: “We repeatedly encouraged those who were there to comply with the law and leave. Regrettably, a small minority of people began chanting at officers, pushing and throwing items.</p>
<a>a document sent on Friday to forces in England and Wales</a> by the National Police Chiefs’ Council.
<p>While police are operationally independent, the government has made it clear it wants tougher enforcement of pandemic laws and, over recent years, <a>wanted tougher action against protests</a>.</p>
<p>Some in policing will feel they are in an impossible position, faced with competing demands from politicians and shriller voices in the media, who then turn on them when police do what they want.</p>
<p>Dick is hailed by supporters <a>as a pre-eminent officer of her generation</a>. The daughter of two academics, she has a calm demeanour, and a slightly posh voice. She can seem more like a Cabinet permanent secretary than a police chief.</p>
<p>Her compassion and thoughtfulness can impress the rank and file. She told one audience at a policing conference she was “job pissed”, a term used by officers to mean they are in love with policing.</p>
<p>Dick has previously survived what many thought would have ended her career. She was in charge in 2005 when officers shot an innocent man dead, having mistaken Jean Charles de Menezes for a terrorist.</p>
<p>In the past year she has been criticised over Operation Midland, the disastrous Met investigation into a VIP paedophile ring, and by others over alleged racial discrimination in the way stop and search is carried out.</p>
<p>The future of today’s commissioner is also in the hands of politicians, against the backdrop of an angry and frustrated public.</p>
<li>More than a thousand people gathered in London’s Parliament Square on Sunday evening to make their voices heard outside the seat of government following clashes at a vigil for Sarah Everard.</li>
<li>Police took a noticeably different approach at the protest, keeping their distance from the crowd at Sunday’s event.</li>
<li>At Parliament Square, demonstrators called for the resignation of the Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, and the scrapping of the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill.</li>
<li>Dick said “none of us would have wanted to see the scenes we saw at yesterday’s event”, adding that “if it had been lawful, if it had been a vigil - I’d have been there”.</li>
<li>London mayor Sadiq Khan asked Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) to carry out a “full, independent investigation” into the Met police operation at Clapham Common on Saturday evening.</li>
<li>The home secretary said that there are “still questions to be answered” over the Met’s policing of the vigil as she asked the chief inspector of constabulary to conduct a review.</li>
<a>Police</a> in a letter posted to Twitter.
<li>Patsy Stevenson, who was photographed being pinned to the floor by two male police officers on Saturday, spoke on Sunday to condemn the policing of the <a>vigil the previous day</a> as “disgraceful”.</li>
<p>A group of five from Edinburgh Reclaim These Streets laid flowers and candles at a vigil for to remember Sarah Everard on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Two members of the group, Kat Cary and Chloe Whyte, walked up the Royal Mile to light candles at the door of Edinburgh Castle.</p>
<p>There was a markedly different police response at the protest, which was called largely in response to allegedly heavy-handed tactics at the vigil in Everard’s memory on Saturday.</p>
<h2>Reclaim These Streets accuses commissioner of putting people at 'serious risk'</h2>
<p>Reclaim These Streets has accused Cressida Dick of putting people at “serious risk” of Covid and of being “manhandled, fined and arrested” by failing to ensure peaceful vigils could be carried out with the co-operation of the Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p>The group said it had sought to make contact with the commissioner and had “only ever sought to be constructive”, pointing to the example of Nottingham where a vigil was able to proceed under the watch of officers.</p>
<p>The protest dispersed peacefully a couple of hours after it started – a markedly different end to yesterday’s vigil which saw arrests and accusations the Met Police manhandled women.</p>
<p>Aima, who didn’t wish to give her last name, co-founder of All Black Lives UK, said:</p>
<p>I think the police were fearful of harassing us at the protest, they were aggressive at the beginning but I think that they saw how angry and powerful we were and I guess they got scared, with the bad press today. </p>
<p>Speaking at the protest was extremely emotional for me I have been saying the same things over and over for months and I finally think people are getting it.</p>
<p>Patsy Stevenson, who was photographed being pinned to the floor by two male police officers on Saturday, spoke on Sunday to condemn the policing of the vigil the previous day as “disgraceful”.</p>
<a>government adviser</a> and a
<a>Tory MP </a>suggested was redolent of the language of male abusers. Hundreds more protested today.
<p>Aamna Mohdin has been speaking to people who went to vigils outside London on Saturday, with attendees saying there was a marked contrast between policing in the capital and Brighton compared with other cities. </p>
<p>Gatherings went ahead in Bristol, Cambridge and Glasgow with minimal police presence. </p>
<p>One 23-year-old who attended a vigil in Brighton criticised Sussex police:</p>
<p>At first, it was silent, then people were speaking. There was singing and tears; it was really very moving. It really escalated when the police surrounded one of the speakers.</p>

<p>A vigil in south London in response to the disappearance of Sarah Everard has been cancelled, organisers have said.</p>
<p>In a statement, the group blamed the decision on a “lack of constructive engagement from the Metropolitan police” and said Scotland Yard “would not engage with our suggestions to help ensure that a legal, Covid-secure vigil could take place”.</p>
<p>“We have been very disappointed that given the many opportunities to engage with organisers constructively the Met police have been unwilling to commit to anything.”</p>
<p>Instead, the group aims to raise £320,000 for women’s charities, with hopes to raise “£10k for every proposed fine for the 32 vigils originally scheduled”.</p>
<p>A fundraising page set up on Saturday morning <a>has raised</a> £255,000.</p>
<p>“All the women across the country who are seeking to organise their own events too are at risk of criminal prosecutions from the Serious Crime Act, which is what we’ve been threatened with,” she said.</p>
<p>Some MPs condemned the lack of police support for the vigil. The Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy tweeted:</p>
<p>The Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Daisy Cooper, tweeted that it was the government’s responsibility “to ensure people can protest safely”.</p>
<p>“Women around the UK wanted to stand in silence, 2m apart, w/masks. They’ve been threatened with whopping 10k fines. On Mon, Govt will introduce new laws to curb protests further. Really?” </p>
<p>The chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, Caroline Nokes, who had previously said she had asked the home secretary, Priti Patel, to “step in” to permit the vigil, said she hoped people would now gather virtually instead.</p>
<p>The Conservative MP said: “It is important that women come together. We can do that virtually and recognise the ongoing issue there is with violence against women and girls, perpetrated by men, but do it in a Covid-safe way.”</p>
<p>Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Nokes also called for greater action from the government over violence against women and girls.</p>
<p>The Labour MP Harriet Harman, chair of the joint committee on human rights, said the dispute between police and organisers showed that the government needed to clarify the regulations on demonstrating during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“The police’s response to do a blanket ban, to say we can treat everybody equally by stopping all freedom of associations, is not the right way to go about it.”</p>
<p>Organisers appealed to people not to attend Clapham Common for the previously planned demonstration and said details of a virtual gathering would be announced later on Saturday.</p>
<p>On Friday evening a high court judge refused an application byReclaim These Streets to make “an interim declaration” that any ban on outdoor gatherings under coronavirus regulations was “subject to the right to protest”.</p>
<p>In a further post, the group added: “We are angry. We will not be controlled. We will not be silenced.”</p>
<p>As well as the Clapham Common event, vigils were planned in at least two dozen other towns and cities.</p>
<p>Organisers of an Edinburgh vigil for Everard, which was due to be held in-person on Saturday, announced on Friday that the event had been moved online. Organisers in Glasgow are still planning to go ahead with in-person demonstrations. </p>

<a>Ford’s Dagenham plant</a> strengthened the arm of Barbara Castle, the employment secretary, but she only just squeezed the Equal Pay Act through an antagonistic Labour cabinet and unions.
<a>benchwork like mine</a> as a switch-cable operator clamping small wires, not high-paid assembly-line jobs.
<p>Until 2010, men who murdered their wives could <a>plead “provocation”</a>, while the “rough sex” defence has only just been struck out. Refuges close while <a>domestic violence rises</a>.</p>
<a>following “identity politics”</a> and “fashion” not “fact”.
<ul> <li><p>Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>
<p>A consistently high number of workers are alleging that their employers are illegally paying them less than colleagues in similar roles, according to research released to mark the 50th anniversary of the Equal <a>Pay</a> Act.</p>
<p>The act, which established the legal principle that workers should receive <a>equal pay for equal work</a>, was given royal assent on 29 May 1970, following the huge publicity generated by striking sewing machinists at Ford’s Dagenham plant.</p>
<p>The story of that struggle was revived in the 2010 film Made in Dagenham, starring Sally Hawkins, Bob Hoskins and Miranda Richardson.</p>
<p>However, 50 years on, the number of cases brought to employment tribunals are showing no sign of decreasing, according to research by the law firm DLA Piper.</p>
<p>Since the 2007-08 financial year, employment tribunals in England and Wales have received more than 368,000 complaints relating to equal pay, an average of almost 29,000 complaints a year.</p>
<p>“However, the employment tribunal statistics may only be the tip of the iceberg – it is not clear how many of the claims that are withdrawn before hearing – some 61% of cases – are actually withdrawn in return for a financial settlement.”</p>
<p>The act took effect more than five years later in December 1975 and has since been repealed and replaced by the <a>Equality Act 2010</a>.</p>
<p>From green lakes to the blue Adriatic coast to massive mountains in the north, Montenegro’s has a definite wow factor.</p>
<a>King Nikola Museum</a>. You get a good sense of the aristocratic, refined but still very Montenegrin and Slavic way in which the family lived.
<p>Further north, towards the Bosnian border, the town of Plužine sits by Lake Piva, one of the biggest artificial lakes in the former Yugoslavia. Its bright blue waters and craggy grey mountains wouldn’t look out of place in Canada or New Zealand.</p>
<p>In between is Perazića Do, which is marred by a huge unfinished hotel, but as long as you look away from the building site, the beach is gorgeous.</p>
<p>Velika Plaža, in the south beyond Ulcinj, is a very long sandy beach. There’s a choice of kitesurfing clubs along the sands, and not far away are the Ulcinj saltpans, visited by a range of migratory birds, including a huge flock of flamingos. </p>
<p>One of my favourite restaurants is Konoba Galija (+3 823-346-1717, no website) at Buljarica. There’s always fresh seafood, delivered by their little fishing boat, which ties up on the beach.</p>
<p><a>Konoba Badanj</a> in Virpazar is where I usually eat, and it’s great for a breakfast of priganice (little doughnuts with cheese and honey), before going kayaking or taking a boat trip on the lake.</p>
<a>Zvono</a>. You can whoosh along the zipline and have a strong drink afterwards: it does typically hearty Montenegrin fare – excellent trout and meat dishes.
<a>Lipovac</a>, between Virpazar and Cetinje, which is in smart contemporary buildings but makes wine in traditional clay amphorae.
<a>Stara Čaršija</a> is a classy new hotel with a spa and restaurant (doubles from €61 BB). It’s newly built but blends in with the Ottoman surroundings.
<a>Hotel Conte</a> in Perast (doubles from €75 BB), has a restaurant right on the waters of Kotor Bay, where you can eat fresh fish by candlelight.
<p>“The irony is that tourism is what originally killed Old Perithia,” says Mark, “and now tourism is bringing the village back to life.”</p>
<a>The Corfu Trail</a>, which runs from the north of the island to the south, passes through Old Perithia. There are also hikes to the top of
<a>Blue Freedom</a> plan, the Greek government has prioritised the vaccination of islands to encourage tourists. According to its
<a>online vaccination tracker</a>, just over half of eligible islanders have had both jabs (about 66,000 people).
<p>The next morning, I swing by Vasilis’ house to buy a jar of honey. “It’s funny,” he tells me, “20 years ago, I would have told you that Old Perithia had no future. Now I feel like our best days might be yet to come.”</p>

<a>Minoan site at Akrotiri</a>, buried under a volcanic eruption around 1600BC and the probable source of the Atlantis legend, will astonish even the ancient ruin-averse.
<p>If you fancy watching the island’s legendary sunset, avoid the perennial squeeze at Oia and head to the southern inland coast for an clear view of the caldera and its shifting colours as the sun goes down.</p>
<a>Chez Sophie</a>, a budget-boutique family-run hotel laid out around a kidney-shaped pool, 50 metres from Kamari beach (from €77 BB).
<a>Kalimera Hotel</a> in Akrotiri is a tad isolated but has a pool, a bus stop in front of the entrance, and yes, some caldera views (from €117 BB). If you’re after Fira’s nightlife and aren’t too fussy,
<a>Kykladonisia</a> is a converted mansion in the heart of town with smallish rooms featuring traditional furniture (€77.80 room only).
<a>To Psaraki</a>, where freshness is paramount; the waiter will advise not only on what’s fresh and what’s pre-frozen, but also whether your choice was caught locally or, alas, “further out in the Aegean” (€50). For a drink in Fira, try the buzzy
<a>PK</a> with its jaw-dropping views and lip-smacking cocktails (€12-€15): you can book a table online to watch the sunset (and even click to see the exact view from your reserved seat).
<a>Rodos Niohori Luxury Suites</a> is one such mansion that’s been converted to three luxury suites (€170 for two BB). The simpler
<a>Limeri guesthouse</a> in Monolithos makes a good base for day trips in the south (doubles from €77 BB), while
<a>Oasis Prasonisi</a> is a remote beach hotel (doubles from €160 BB). The colourful
<a>F-Charm hotel</a> is in the southern, less touristy part of Lindos and faces the serene St Paul’s Bay (doubles €115, room only).
<a>Niohori restaurant</a> by the Catholic church of Santa Maria in Rhodes town. The Tsourounakis family who have run the place since 1981 also own the butcher’s opposite, so the meat is as fresh as it gets (mains €15-€25).
<a>Limanaki </a>in Kolymbia is renowned for fish and seafood and has a choose-your-own lobster tank (€25-€50). For trad Greek, try
<a>Pezouli</a> in Ialysos (€20-€35); its Greek platter with moussaka, giouvetsi (pasta casserole), rice-stuffed veg, soutzoukakia (spicy meatballs) and baked potatoes is as good an introduction to Greek cooking as it is impossible to finish.
<a>Hatziemmanouil winery</a> near the busy town of Zipari offers a different kind of outing. Operating since 1929 in the hands of the same family, it produces white Greek wines (malagouzia, assyrtiko) and French red varieties (cabernet sauvignon, syrah).
<a>Diamond Deluxe Hotel</a> on Lambi Beach (doubles €188 BB) has a spa and the gourmet restaurant offers three-course menus for €55pp as well as first-class à la carte options. Simpler but no less fetching are the award-winning
<a>Nissia Kamares Hotel Apartments</a> in Kardamena, which remain affordable even in high season (doubles €65.80 BB, three-night minimum).
<a>Broadway</a> in Kos town to sample dishes like lamb saddle with celery root puree, shimeji mushrooms and coffee, sea bass with cauliflower cream and asparagus, and moussaka croquettes (€8-€20).
<p>Greece’s greenest island, Corfu, welcomes visitors with the sweet aroma of pine and lemon trees. In the mountainous interior myrtle and bay bushes fight it out, while venerable olive groves descendto its beach-fringed coastline. </p>
<a>Mon Repos</a>, the neoclassical villa where the Duke of Edinburgh was born, reputedly on the dining room table.
<a>San Antonio</a> in the fishing village of Kalami where the Durrells made their home. Despite being in the TUI catalogue, San Antonio’s prime location and abundance of activities elevates it above package-holiday anonymity (doubles €121 BB).
<a>Labranda Sandy Beach Resort</a> at Agios Georgios Argyradon on the west coast, close to Lake Korission as well as some of Corfu’s best beaches (doubles €132.60 all-inclusive, three-night minimum).
<a>Toula’s</a> in Agni Bay with signature dishes like crayfish moussaka, bourdeto (baked spicy scorpion fish) and lobster burgers (€20-€50) as well as a sizeable wine list.
<a>Knossos</a>, site of the first European civilisation, to admire the palace of Minos, another one to
<a>Phaistos</a>, a town that prospered even before the Trojan war, and then visit the
<a>Moni Arkadiou</a> with its unusual baroque main church. Keep going west and you’ll hit Chania, for many the prettiest town in Greece, with a breezy Venetian feel.
<a>Diktaion Andron cave</a>, the birthplace of Zeus himself, according to myth.
<a>Splanzia Hotel</a> in the old Turkish quarter; its Ottoman furnishings and homely surroundings combine with the bustle of the street outside to create an atmosphere of a Crete long forgotten (doubles €115 BB). In Rethymno stay at
<a>Villa Ippocampi</a>, which has a pool within a walled garden in the hillside village of Koutouloufari, and is only half a mile from Hersonissos (doubles €130 BB). For seaside lounging, make a reservation at the self-catering
<a>White Houses</a> at Makrygialos on the south-eastern coast near Ierapetra, the most unexplored part of Crete. There are tavernas on the doorstep and three good beaches within walking distance (doubles €110.50 room only, two-night minimum).
<a>Xalavro Open Kitchen</a> creates mouthwatering dishes like octopus with fava beans and caper chutney or sea bass with chimichurri and white fish roe (€25-€45). Hersonissos claims one of the best fish restaurants,
<a>Saradari</a>, with fresh fish converted into tartare, carpaccio or ceviche, and an incomparable monkfish burger in a squid-ink brioche bun with barbecued shrimp, onions and pickles (€18-€30). Lastly, beach bar-taverna
<a>Kleio</a> just outside Ierapetra town is rated highly by the locals for its wood-fired oven that roasts lamb, pork, chicken and goat (€15-€20).
<a>La Caraba</a>, we eat fresh interpretations of traditional dishes: caldereta, the local lobster stew, and torrijas, a sort of Spanish french toast.
<a>Mercat de Peix</a>, the old fish market in Maó, chasing anchovies and tapenade on bread down with fig pastries from the
<a>bakery</a> next door. We eat, repeatedly, at scenic winery and restaurant
<a>Binifadet</a> (if Menorca is my happy place, Binifadet’s €16-a-bottle espumoso is my happy drink).
<a>Chèspir Bar</a> on picturesque Cales Fonts port (at the end is the puerta de Eos, the first point that dawn light hits Spain). There’s a euphoric gig at
<a>Es Claustre</a>, Maó’s cathedral courtyard turned music venue. And there’s snorkelling in caves and coves around Binidalí.
<a>Hauser Wirth gallery</a>. It’s big news: international art name shacks up in quietest Balearic, its galleries filled by
<a>Mark Bradford</a>, its gardens designed by
<a>Piet Oudolf </a>(of New York High Line fame), its restaurant run by Binifadet. Its local initiatives include astronomy classes.
<a>Galeria Cayón</a> in an old Maó cinema; and contemporary gallery
<a>Es Tast de na Sílvia</a> are reinventing Menorquin cuisine. As a visitor, I wish I had more time to play; “as a Menorcan it’s certainly exciting to see,” says Rescalvo.
<p><a>Hotel Rural Biniarroca</a> is a traditional farmhouse in Sant Lluís, near Binifadet (from €120 a night BB)). In Mahón centre, <a>Jardí de Ses Bruixes</a> has a gorgeous courtyard restaurant and great breakfast (from €160 a night BB).</p>
<h2>Coves to caves: Three ways to explore the island</h2>
<a>Cova d’en Xoroi</a>, a south coast bar and club carved into the cliff face. There are day tours and DJs until dawn, but the ambient evening in-betweener eases into a spectacular sunset, with a drink, music and clifftop vista for €20, 5pm-10pm.
<a>Manor House Country Hotel</a> sits on a hill above the lake, and a nine-hole golf course splits the deciduous woodland that runs down to Manor Marine’s harbour, caravan park and lakeside paths.
<a>Swallows and Amazons</a> attractions of the area – boats, fishing, uninhabited islands, ancient ruins – it was feeding cups of Cheerios to a family of ducks on our patio each morning that most captivated our five-year-old, Isla.
<a>Blakes of the Hollow</a> is a much-loved traditional bar right in the middle of the island town. Don’t miss the excellent local gin,
<a>Boatyard</a> – and the county now has its own craft beer,
<a>Inishmacsaint</a>. For food,
<a>Franco’s Restaurant</a> has for decades served up that magical, slippery elixir called “atmosphere” alongside its excellent fare.
<a>Neil Hannon</a>, and motored back to the Manor facing a sunset over the water that would defy description by even those celebrated wordsmiths.
<a>Nelly Furtado</a> beats before dozing as their limbs turn bronze.
<p>Travelling by car also means the dog can come. Corsica is the nearest, hottest, most affordable option, so we take the Eurotunnel to Calais and point the car south for our crossing from Toulon to Ajaccio.</p>
<a>Provence</a>. The scent of pine resin, baked asphalt and salty air greet our arrival at the Mediterranean, before our overnight ferry from Toulon to Ajaccio.
<p>Cap Corse has something for everyone, and most places are within a 45-minute drive. A car is essential for getting about (the island’s scenic railway does not extend beyond Bastia), and you’ll need cash pretty much everywhere.</p>
<a>Le Pirate</a> in Erbalunga. In the same village is the charming, old-world Hôtel Castel Brando, which we discovered by accident when seeking sanctuary from an enormous dog that had started its own vendetta against our own.
<a>brocciu</a>) and honey. The latter, born of the macquis nectar but classified in six variants, depending on when it was made and with what, is particularly worth stopping for and parting with your cash.
<p>Walking to the woodshed, let alone a long day travelling on skis with heavy rucksacks, seems unappealing. So we throw another log into the woodburner and break out the cards and Kindles to wait out the weather.</p>
<p>With a tight schedule, a lost day means a change of plans: we will now retrace our route over two days via the Målia hut to our starting point.</p>
<p>We plotted the route for ease and safety, following well-travelled parts of the Hedmarksvidda, an area of low mountain moorland dotted with hamlets and crossed by roads.</p>
<p>Our starting point is the small ski station at Budor. From the trailhead, the skiing will be all uphill at first until we hit a rolling plateau.</p>
<p>We go for an evening ski through the woods around the hut, making our own tracks across the snow-covered ponds and frozen marshes.</p>
