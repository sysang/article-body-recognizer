<p>Right. Plus it could help with erectile dysfunction.</p>
<p>I’m listening. Well, in 2014, Spanish researcher Fernando Azpiroz examined the Mediterranean diet for other benefits, and found that it can also reduce the incidence of farting by 28%.</p>
<p>Astonishing. It isn’t the best fart-decreaser, though. For that you have to adopt a much more regulated anti-fart diet. But nobody is going to knock 28%.</p>

<p>A male underwear company that had its adverts pulled from social media and an appearance on a morning television show dropped has accused the industry of double standards when it comes to images of semi-clothed male and female bodies.</p>
<a>Facebook</a>, claims Parker. One featuring a model in a thong holding a basketball was blocked for going against community standards. “How is that remotely sexual?” asks Parker.
<a>Instagram</a> removed posts without explanation, and Moot employees were unable to tag products or use “swipe up to buy”, essential functions for companies when shops closed in the pandemic and e-commerce became the only way to purchase.
<a>lingerie adverts</a> by brands ranging from Agent Provocateur to newer outfits like Pour Moi, Snag, Marie Mer, DSTM and Scantilly by Curvy Kate, have been pushing buttons.
<a> “Full Metal Packet</a>”. But Cole argues that adverts like these are no more sexualised than those featuring women in their underwear. “There are still double standards in how bodies are represented when semi-clothed,” he says.
<p>An <a>ITV</a> spokesperson told the Observer: “As a topical magazine show, we are constantly in discussion about a host of potential on-air segments at any one time – some of which make it on to the show and, unfortunately, some of which do not.”</p>
<a>Health</a> Research to give a £3m grant to Professor Rosalind Eeles, of the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), and the Royal Marsden Hospital London, to lead research aimed at setting up a prostate cancer genetic testing and screening service.
<p>“The overall risk at age 70 of getting prostate cancer is about 3% and at the age of 80 to 85, it’s about 12%,” added Eeles. “What we want to do is find out, earlier in life, who among these groups is most at risk of getting the disease.”</p>
<p>Eeles stressed that such a screening service would take time to perfect. It would have to be cost-effective and simple to implement.</p>

<p><a>Clare’s Law, introduced in 2014</a>, gives people the “right to ask” their force about any previous <a>domestic violence</a> or offences that mean their partners could pose a risk to them.</p>
<p>Home Office guidance states that police will aim to complete the inquiries within 35 days.</p>
<p>Out of the 14 forces able to provide full statistics for last year, Bedfordshire proportionally failed to meet the guidance most often, as information relating to 20 of the 33 approved Right to Ask requests (61%) took more than 35 days to disclose.</p>
<p>The Met, Derbyshire and Staffordshire police, by contrast, revealed material within the advised timeframe for every request they disclosed in 2020.</p>
<p>Campaigners have reacted with alarm to the figures as timely background checks on a partner suspected of previous abuse may have proved vital for those confined to their homes during lockdowns.</p>
<p>The delays coincided with a surge in requests for information about partners’ potential violent pasts, which more than doubled from 3,479 in 2018 to 8,438 last year, according to responses from 26 out of the 43 forces in England and Wales.</p>
<p>Questions have also been raised over the reasons behind the huge disparity in how forces release the information.</p>
<p>Essex police, which did not respond to a request for comment, disclosed 36 – only 7% – of the 529 “right to ask” applications it received last year.</p>
<p>Over the same period, Norfolk constabulary disclosed 61% of the total requests it received.</p>
<p>“Other police areas may have a different approach that recognises that many people who present a risk may have been involved in concerning behaviour that has not resulted in charge or conviction.”</p>
<p>“Timely information is really important for people in deciding what action they want to take. Delay can result in not only escalation of risk but making it more difficult for people to end an unsafe relationship if that is what they want to do.”</p>
<p>A Bedfordshire police spokesperson said that the pandemic had affected the training of new staff managing the applications and had made it harder to meet people at risk.</p>
<p>The force is optimistic that it will now be able to meet the Home Office timetable for the more than 20 applications a month it receives.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Leicestershire police said the rise in the number of applications last year, along with lockdown restrictions, contributed to the delays, adding that their force will continue to do all it can to support victims of domestic abuse.</p>

<a>paternity leave</a> lasting at least three months to help challenge the UK’s entrenched gender roles and the prioritisation of work over family for men, according to shadow business secretary,
<p>The former <a>Labour</a> leader is advocating for a “reordering” of responsibilities that gives men the option of spending more time caring for children without financial penalty.</p>
<a>£150 a week</a>, prompting most fathers to cite financial constraints as the biggest barrier to taking more leave with their newly born or adopted child.
<p>The 51-year-old Doncaster MP wants fathers offered non-transferable paid leave at a generous level, which he believes would help reframe the “men at work, women at home” dynamic that current UK provision encourages.</p>
<p>More equal parental leave would also benefit women in the workplace and help <a>narrow the gender pay gap</a>, which research shows can be attributed to childcare.</p>
<p>Miliband writes: “We would start to break free from a culture which loads so much on to women, penalises them for having children, constrains them in a particular stereotype.</p>
<a>trying to convince the British electorate in 2015</a> that he should be prime minister.
<p>Groups representing fathers’ rights welcomed Miliband’s intervention in the debate.</p>
<p>Lewkowicz added that the UK has the world’s biggest differential between support for mothers and fathers – statutory maternity leave at <a>52 weeks</a> compared to the fortnight for paternity leave.</p>
<p>“A take-it-or-lose-it approach to parental leave for each parent is the only model shown to work in promoting the beneficial involvement of both parents in children’s lives,” he said.</p>
<p>The “use it or lose it” paternity scheme was rolled out in Sweden and Iceland during the 1990s and has been widely credited as a huge success.</p>
<p>In 1995 when Iceland had no paid paternity leave, men took just 0.1% of leave. Five years later, when fathers became entitled to two weeks’ paid leave – as in Britain today – that rose to 3% of total leave.</p>
<p>Now, with each parent in Iceland entitled to five months off work and paid at 80% of their salary, men take 30% of the total.</p>
<p>Such an approach helps explain why the UK is currently 28 out of 31 of the world’s richest countries in a recent ranking of family-friendly policies by Unicef.</p>

<p>“I was drinking heavily,” he says. “I could feel my relationship falling apart. My behaviour became erratic. And you can’t turn off. You take a holiday, but you don’t switch off.”</p>
<p>Carter agonised over abandoning a well-paid career he had spent decades building, but in the end he thought, “What am I doing to myself?”</p>
<p>And then there is “worn-out burnout” – just being ground down: “People have low amounts of energy, and feel exhausted on an emotional, physical and social level.”</p>
<p>An emotionally rewarding job you love is also not necessarily a shield against burning out, as Tara Lewis discovered after working as a paramedic for 16 years, before leaving in 2015. </p>
<p>A year earlier, Lewis was signed off work for six months. She adored being a paramedic. “You go into it with that whole thing of, ‘I want to do the trauma, the proper emergencies, and make a difference.’”</p>
<p>She thinks it took her “a good three years to really feel properly well again” with the help of counselling and antidepressants, although in the first couple of months after leaving her job there was “a massive improvement”.</p>
<p>While she was off work, Lewis decided to start training as a beauty therapist and the next year, when she was offered a job in a salon, she resigned from the NHS.</p>
<a>nutrition brand, Innermost</a>. It has been daunting but “it’s a healthier kind of fear, it’s not dread. I feel much happier now.”
<p>Hussein was signed off from work, and, although she was recommended antidepressants and therapy, found that what really helped her was breathwork – breathing exercises that it is claimed can transform mental and physical health. </p>
<p>She ended up leaving her job in 2016 and retraining as a breathwork and meditation teacher to help others. “Within six months, I had almost none of the previous issues that I had dealt with.”</p>
<p>The good news, says Babb, is that there are “effective ways to manage and reduce the impact of burnout. They focus on developing your stress awareness, and resilience and coping strategies.”</p>
<p>Lewis is proof that there is life after burnout – perhaps even when returning to a similar job (with critical adjustments). “So far,” she says, “it’s all been really good.”</p>
<p>When she did wake, she was no longer wearing her pyjama bottoms and had semen on her body. Magnus was sleeping beside her.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to know how many women have been raped or sexually assaulted by their partners while they slept, although a recent piece of research has suggested the number might be far, far higher than we’d like to think.</p>
<p>“The 2003 Sexual Offences Act is crystal clear,” she continues. “Consent can only be agreed when you have the capacity to make that choice – and if you’re asleep or unconscious, you don’t. We’re talking about rape – one hundred per cent.”</p>
<p>“Imagine being asleep and waking to find someone going through your personal things,” she continues. “Now imagine it’s your actual body that has been intruded into.”</p>
<p>“On that night, I’d made dinner. He’d drunk too much so I let him stay in the spare room – but I woke up to find him in with me, having sex.”</p>

<p>Government will also ‘be taking action on all the recommendations’ in report into parliament’s toxic culture, treasurer says</p>
<p>The federal treasurer, <a>Josh Frydenberg</a>, has conceded the Liberal party has “got to do more” to recruit women as he signalled the government would take action against sexual harassment in parliament before the end of the year.</p>
<p>The deputy Liberal leader made the comments on ABC’s Insiders program on Sunday where he also raised the prospect of the Coalition in opposition blocking <a>Labor’s 43% emissions reduction target</a> for 2030.</p>
<a>a significant overhaul of federal parliament’s toxic workplace culture </a>after handing down her landmark report that found one in three staffers interviewed had been sexually harassed.
<p>The report also focused attention on the Liberal party’s failure to achieve equal representation of women in parliament without quotas, despite <a>adopting targets of 50% in some states</a> including New South Wales.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Frydenberg said 38% of MPs and senators in federal parliament were women. In the Liberal party, although representation in the lower house is closer to a quarter, half of the party’s senators are women.</p>
<p>“There’s been progress – 25 years ago, about 20% of the parliamentarians were women. Ten years ago it was 30%,” he said. “Today we’re approaching 40%. We’ve made progress … we’ve got to do more.”</p>
<p>Frydenberg said it was “not right” the Victorian Liberal party continued to preselect men in winnable seats such as Casey and Menzies, where Liberal incumbents Tony Smith and Kevin Andrews are resigning.</p>
<p>He cited the fact senator Sarah Henderson is top of the Victorian Liberal ticket, and the party has preselected women to contest the marginal Labor seats of Dunkley and Corangamite.</p>
<p>Asked if the harassment detailed by Jenkins was familiar to him, Frydenberg replied “not to that extent”, saying that beyond several “very concerning allegations” what Jenkins found was a “normalised culture of misconduct”.</p>
<p>“That is completely unacceptable. In any workplace, let alone the nation’s workplace.</p>
<p>“We’ll be taking action on all the recommendations,” the treasurer said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Frydenberg raised the alarm about Labor’s 2030 climate target despite the fact a 43% emissions reduction is less ambitious than the target of several Liberal-National state governments and many business groups.</p>
<p>Frydenberg said Labor was looking to legislate its target, which they would do “in partnership with the Greens”, meaning 43% was just a “first bid” that could be increased after the election.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, we’ve got our target, 26-28% by 2030, but we’re on track for a 35% reduction,” he said.</p>
<p>Asked if the <a>Coalition</a> would block Labor’s target if it were in opposition, Frydenberg replied: “We’re not about to support Labor’s policy. We’ve got our own policy and that’s what we’re looking to implement.”</p>
<p>Frydenberg attacked <a>Labor’s policy for utilising the safeguards mechanism</a> – a cap on emissions of the biggest polluters that was implemented by the Abbott Coalition government.</p>
<p>Frydenberg said the mid-year economic update would forecast growth in Australia, citing estimates of up to 5.5% growth in 2022.</p>
<p>“We’re starting to see workforce shortages which will have some positive impact on wages,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the deputy Labor leader, Richard Marles, told Sky News that Labor had proposed “a sensible proposition” that would reduce electricity prices, create jobs and reduce emissions.</p>
<p>Marles said the 43% emissions reduction figure had been selected after looking for “practical measures we could take that we knew Australia would be willing to support” then determining “where that took the numbers”.</p>
<p>Marles noted the safeguard mechanism was “their [the Coalition’s] creation”, and all Labor had done was adopt the Business Council of Australia’s recommendation to lower the baseline of emissions over time.</p>
<p>Marles rejected the proposition the policy could cost Labor the election, or that it faced a tradeoff between inner-city environmentally conscious voters and regional voters more concerned about job security.</p>

<p>He told her she needed to go sit and “work it out”.</p>
<p>Brach, in shock from the public humiliation, retreated to a little one-person meditation hut called a gurdwara, where she spent most of the night.</p>
<p>Emily Tanner, a 34-year-old international affairs professional living in Charlottesville, Virginia, found Brach after her husband came home one night and unexpectedly told her that he wanted a divorce.</p>
<p>Self-compassion as the approach to mindfulness, rather than a result one gains from it, is a relatively new concept.</p>
<p>That same year, Brach published her first book, Radical Acceptance. When Neff read it, she thought: “She’s the one, she’s the spiritual teacher who totally gets what I’m talking about.”</p>

<p>For a long time, Brach’s relational healing came through family, friends, clients, students, peers – and her son. Only at 50 did she find a healing romantic relationship.</p>

<p>Despite low conviction rates, ministers continue to claim they are confident that the military’s justice system is “capable of dealing with all offences”.</p>
<p>The government also announced that it would be setting up a defence serious crimes unit which, while commendable in principle, puts only three out of the 20 related recommendations from its recent service justice system review into law.</p>
<p>Time and again, ministers are refusing the opportunity to take seriously the issues of bullying, harassment and assault for female personnel, instead favouring lukewarm alternatives that miss the heart of the issue.</p>

<p>A former police officer has won a court of appeal challenge over police guidance on hate incidents after claiming it unlawfully interferes with the right to freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The force recorded the complaint as a non-crime hate incident, defined by the College of Policing’s guidance as “any non-crime incident which is perceived, by the victim or any other person, to be motivated by a hostility or prejudice”.</p>
<p>The judge, sitting with Lord Justice Haddon-Cave and Lady Justice Simler, found that records of such incidents could be disclosed in an enhanced criminal record check, adding to the chilling effect.</p>
<p>She added: “The concept of a chilling effect in the context of freedom of expression is an extremely important one.</p>
<p>Sharp said the discussion around gender involved “plainly important matters of public interest on which strong views are held and publicly expressed”.</p>
<p>The senior judges also found that while the guidance had legitimate aims of preventing crime, those aims could be achieved by less intrusive measures.</p>
<p>Sharp later rejected the high court judge’s finding that a “commonsense discretion” not to record should be read into the guidance.</p>
<p>She continued: “The guidance contemplates on its face, the recording by the police of incidents as non-crime hate incidents, which are, to put it shortly, non-crime non-hate incidents.”</p>
<p>However, Sharp said the revisions “do not go very far, or not nearly far enough to address the chilling effect of perception-based recording more generally”.</p>
<p>She concluded: “The guidance should truly reflect what the police are expected to do and should not mislead by omission either the police who have to use it or the public. I do not think the tension is an impossible one to resolve.”</p>
<p>“The court has found we need to make safeguards in our guidance more explicit to help police officers proportionately enforce the law.</p>
<p>He added: “All police guidance is kept under continual review and is adapted to keep pace with the complex demands of protecting the public.” </p>
<a>China mulls bolstering laws on women’s rights and sexual harassment</a>
<p>Ministers are concerned about women’s health, <a>they have declared today</a>. Many women who have been shouting about glaring health inequalities for far too long may be forgiven for saying under their breaths: about bloody time.</p>
<p>In many countries <a>men face greater health risks</a>, but not in the UK. A study from <a>Manual, a wellbeing platform for men</a>, has found the UK has the largest female health gap among G20 countries and the 12th largest globally.</p>
<a>women with dementia received worse medical treatment than men with the condition</a>, made fewer visits to the GP, received less health monitoring and took more potentially harmful medication.
<p>Women, in particular young women, are also more likely to <a>experience common mental health conditions</a> than men, despite the fact that men account for about three-quarters of deaths registered as suicide.</p>
<a>systematically discriminating against women</a>, leaving them chronically misunderstood, mistreated and misdiagnosed”.
<p>Sexism is still rampant in healthcare, not least among staff. Despite the fact the NHS workforce is dominated by women, <a>men working in NHS trusts are still paid more than their female peers</a>.</p>
<a>being dismissed by their GPs</a>, to women
<a>struggling to get the menopause drugs they need</a> on the NHS. The consequences can be catastrophic. In June 2020 a government inquiry found that an arrogant culture in which serious medical complications were dismissed as “women’s problems”
<a>contributed to a string of healthcare scandals over several decades</a>.
<p>A recognition today by the women’s health minister Maria Caufield that there were “shocking” cases among the 100,000 women who answered a government consultation is welcome, as is the announcement that there will be a women’s health ambassador.</p>
<a>until very recently</a>, taboo. And it is good to see that campaigners’ calls to ban hymen restoration surgery have finally been heeded after the government earlier promised to ban virginity testing.
<a>Criado-Perez has said</a>, women have been considered less important in healthcare as far back as Ancient Greece.
<a>PPE designed for men to many of its staff</a> – and years of sustained funding if that is to be reversed.
<p>After 100,000 women voiced concerns, plans include menopause support, GP training and banning ‘virginity repair’ operations</p>
<p>The cost of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions will also be cut by implementing longer prescribing cycles so women will need fewer prescriptions and therefore pay less.</p>
<p>The consultation provided “stark and sobering insights” into women’s experiences of health and care and highlighted entrenched problems within the NHS, officials said.</p>
<p>Eight in 10 women said they felt they were not listened to by healthcare professionals, and there was a feeling that services for specialities or conditions that only affect women were of “lower priority” compared to other health services.</p>
<p>Many women also felt that damaging taboos and stigmas in women’s health prevented them from seeking help, and over half of respondents said they felt uncomfortable talking about health issues with their workplace.</p>
<a>Ministers pledge to ‘reset the dial’ on women’s health in England</a>
<p>I now look back on 2021 and think about the year that Australia said we want better.</p>
<a>support for earlier and holistic consent education.</a> It was triggered by 20,000 ordinary citizens who demanded it occurr.
<p>Young Australians don’t care about taboos and we don’t care about expectations. We are making it clear that we want better in 2022 and we will keep marching, keep signing, keep walking out, and keep speaking up until we get it. Listen to us.</p>

<p>China is considering strengthening its laws on women’s rights to provide more robust protection against gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>
<p>The draft regulations come amid the rise of a nascent <a>#MeToo movement</a> in China, which activists say has been hampered by the country’s strict regime of censorship and oppression against all signs of dissent.</p>
<p>The major draft revision was presented to China’s top lawmaking body for deliberation on Monday. The amendment marks a significant development in the country’s women’s rights legislation since it was implemented almost three decades ago.</p>
<p>The definition is the clearest to be provided since the law protecting women’s rights was introduced almost three decades ago. Previous provisions stated merely that sexual harassment against women was prohibited.</p>
<p>The standing committee of the National People’s Congress is expected to debate the amendments to the Law on the Protection of Women’s Rights and Interests on Friday at the earliest. The implementation timeline remains unclear.</p>
<p>The proposal comes amid a whirlwind of international attention on gender and power inequality in China, after the tennis star Peng Shuai made apparent allegations of sexual assault against a former vice-premier in early November.</p>
<a>Women’s Tennis Association has continued to voice concerns over Peng’s welfare</a> after the player on Sunday denied having accused anyone of sexual assault in what appeared to be an informal interview with a Singaporean Chinese-language outlet.
<p>The WTA has announced it will suspend all tournaments in China after several failed attempts to reach the player directly.</p>
<p>China’s patriarchal society is reflected in its ruling and business elite, which is dominated by men.</p>
<a>Zhou Xiaoxuan, a 28-year-old woman, lost a high-profile sexual harassment court case </a>she had brought against a well-known broadcasting host with strong political ties. Zhou is widely seen as the face of the country’s #MeToo awakening.
<a>Claire Foy</a> feeling exposed and exploited, she has said, ahead of the airing of the latest adaptation of A Very British Scandal, in which she stars as a duchess whose private life became the subject of salacious gossip during her divorce proceedings.
<p>Foy plays Margaret Campbell, the Duchess of Argyll, who was famed for her charisma, beauty and style and who suffered the publication of explicit photographs after her husband sought a divorce on the grounds of adultery.</p>
<p>The 1963 hearing focused heavily on the duchess’s sex life, with her husband Ian Campbell publicly estimating the number of men with whom he believed she had had sex, as well as providing explicit pictures purporting to show her in the act.</p>
<a>onscreen adaptation</a>. She said: “It’s a really hard line because basically you do feel exploited when you are a woman and you are having to perform fake sex on screen. You can’t help but feel exploited.
<p>“It’s grim – it’s the grimmest thing you can do. You feel exposed. Everyone can make you try to not feel that way but it’s unfortunately the reality.</p>
<p>“But my thing was that I felt very strongly that it had to be in it, but I wanted it to be female. I did not want it be that sort of awful climactic sexual experience you often see on the cinema screen,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour.</p>
<p>She added: “There is something about it that I just hate, the rephrasing of the ownership of that title, and it being used in a way that justifies it even more. Just the word ‘slut’, I think, probably shouldn’t exist.”</p>
<a>Dublin Murders</a>, and directed by the Norwegian film-maker Anne Sewitsky.
<p>The Greek government has come under growing pressure to introduce femicide as an offence in the country’s penal code amid outrage over the growing and unprecedented number of women being brutally murdered by their partners.</p>
<p>On Saturday police narrowly prevented an 18th woman being killed by her husband when officers broke down the door of the couple’s house as he held a knife to her throat.</p>
<p>With the Mediterranean country shaken by the sheer savagery of the killings, calls have mounted for tougher legislative action to confront what are seen by many as hate crimes.</p>
<p>“We’re already late,” he said, deploring the Greek parliament’s refusal to discuss the issue. “Recognition of femicides by the state ought to be only the beginning.”</p>
<p>A dramatic rise in domestic violence – attributed increasingly to the pandemic and months of confinement – has been accompanied by a string of brutal murders, putting <a>renewed focus on abuse in Greece.</a></p>
<p>From the start of the year, Greek media has reported victims being shot, strangled, suffocated, stabbed, beaten and drowned, with many of their arrested partners reportedly <a>confessing</a> to the murders.</p>
<p>The femicides come amid <a>unparalleled allegations</a> about sexual abuse of women in the arts and sports worlds. The revelations have been widely seen as a turning point for a society that remains one of Europe’s most socially conservative.</p>
<p>In November the centre-right government responded by <a>initiating</a> a public campaign urging victims of domestic and gender-based violence to speak out. It also established a 24-hour helpline and is set to expand a network of counselling centres.</p>
<p>The country’s gender equality minister, Maria Syrengela, described the measures as unprecedented. “There’ll be no ability for men to claim they acted in the heat of the moment, that it was a crime of passion,” she told the Guardian.</p>
<p>“And when the domestic violence law is redrafted in line with the <a>Istanbul convention</a>, we will of course advise that femicide is included,” she said. “It’s about time.”</p>
<p>It was appalling, she added, that in cases of homicide, men in <a>Greece</a> had been able to claim “provocation”, or claim that it was a crime of passion, when the murders amounted to the ultimate exercise of power over women.</p>
<a>Europe</a> to have a law that refers to femicide and that is what is important,” she added, noting that no EU member state had so far incorporated the intentional killing of women and girls as a separate criminal offence.
<p>Classes on sex education and promoting greater awareness of diversity have also been introduced in schools.</p>
<p>“It has to be recognised as a term and as a crime,” said Eirini Agathopoulou, Syriza’s spokesperson for human rights and gender equality. “We have tabled proposals twice in parliament but the government simply refuses to discuss it.”</p>
<a>Calls for femicide to become separate crime in Greece mount as two more women killed</a>

<a>three times more</a> than UK woodlands, but only about
<a>20% remain in a near natural state</a>. As well as extraction, draining of the bogs and fens for farming and forestry, overgrazing, and burning of heather on grouse shooting estates have damaged peatlands.
<p>Peatlands grow by the slow buildup of plant material in waterlogged landscapes. Their degradation means they are <a>losing more carbon</a> than they are gaining.</p>
<p>She said there had been a 25% decrease in peat sold from 2011 to 2019. More than 2m cubic metres of peat were used in 2019.</p>
<p>Asda, Lidl and others said they had targets to reduce peat sales but not yet to end them. Wyvale Garden Centres, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s were among those that had not responded to the survey by the time of publication.</p>
<p>Just 124 landowners own the majority of England’s deep peat – its single largest carbon store – new analysis has found.</p>
<a>according to Natural England</a>,
<a>equivalent to</a> the annual emissions from 540 coal-fired power stations in the US.
<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere every year because of
<a>degradation and draining</a>. Improving their management and encouraging their restoration are part of the UK’s net zero strategy, and the government is aiming to restore 280,000 hectares of peatland in England by the middle of the century.
<p>Alongside large areas owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Defence, just 124 landowners control more than 450,000 hectares of England’s peat.</p>
<a>said taxing</a> deer and grouse estates for failing to ensure their land properly locked up carbon dioxide could play a crucial role in fighting the climate crisis.
<p>In response to the analysis, the Moorland Association, which represents grouse moor owners in England, said its members protected, restored and enhanced deep peat on their land, which required careful management for sustainable grouse shooting.</p>
<p>A Defra spokesperson said it had been clear about the need to phase out rotational burning of protected blanket bog and had brought forward protective legislation, while supporting landowners with restoration.</p>

<p>Each Friday, Poretti and her family pack up the car and head north. While her three daughters, aged 13, 11 and nine, swoosh off to ski school on a Saturday morning, the couple meet friends for lunches, go for walks or unwind at home.</p>
<p>Poretti points proudly to gingham bed linen she has designed and curtains she had made by craftswomen in the Italian Tyrolean region of Trentino-Alto Adige.</p>
<p>After spending years “shopping with other people’s money” as she puts it, Poretti has “a very clear idea of what I like and don’t like”. The same confident assertion is extended to her interior.</p>
<p>While work takes Poretti and her family back to Milan each Monday, the Engadine haven gives her the balance she needs. “I used to travel all over the world with the collections,” she says. “Now I just love the idea of feeling comfortable here.” </p>

<p>The Taliban have said they seek no “revenge” on opponents and that everyone will be “forgiven”, during the first press conference held by the hardline Islamist group since <a>taking power in Kabul</a> on Sunday.</p>
<a>Taliban</a> fighters were doing precisely that. He encouraged people who had fled to the airport with their families to return.
<p>Kabul remained quiet on Tuesday, although there were allegations that insurgent fighters had drawn up lists of people who had cooperated with the government and were seeking them out.</p>
<p>Despite the Taliban’s apparently emollient tone, in a sign of the dangerous frictions ahead, <a>Nato</a> warned on Tuesday that the alliance retained the military power to strike from a distance should the Taliban host terrorist groups.</p>
<p>The Taliban has declared an “amnesty” across Afghanistan and urged women to join their government on Tuesday, seeking to convince a wary population that they have changed since their brutal rule of the country in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>“The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan with full dignity and honesty has announced a complete amnesty for all Afghanistan, especially those who were with the opposition or supported the occupiers for years and recently,” he said.</p>

<p>One day in her 20s, the right words came to Natalie Bullock Brown.</p>
<p>The accessibility of hooks’ words was exactly what Bullock Brown said she needed at a time when she felt all over the place.</p>
<p>Similarly, Bullock Brown said she spent years unpacking the social messages to conform to specific, and limiting, ideas of what a woman is supposed to be – married with children – messages imparted in particular by her father.</p>
<p>A bespoke language created by hooks helped Bullock Brown learn, grow, and forgive. hooks matters because she helped so many of us Black women and girls to trust ourselves and articulate why.</p>

<p>Do not mistake my enthusiasm. I’m not some sort of rabid Mumfluencer; there will be no homemade gingerbread decorations for the tree, no matching striped PJs for the entire family to pose in, like prisoners in Christmas jail.</p>
<p>Huh. No good reason. Really? Just life is it, babes? Ordinary life.</p>
<p>It is something that seems to be experienced by everyone I know. Fellow mothers at the school gate call to me, while we pass each other, rushing to the next thing, “How are you, Nat?”</p>

<p>Being “self-partnered” is not just for those in their 20s or 30s, but for some seniors too.</p>
<h2>‘You never get criticised’</h2>
<p>Di Moloney, 72, Melbourne</p>
<p>“I would say I’m successfully single.”</p>
<h2>‘The bigger problem is trying to live with somebody’</h2>
<p>Kerrie Lorimer, 70, Sydney</p>
<p>Kerrie Lorimer married her husband back in 1973, one month after first meeting him. They had two children and spent 14 years together before separating – and she’s been single ever since, for over 30 years.</p>
<p>“I think the bigger problem is trying to live with somebody,” she says. “I just think it’s complicated living with somebody else. I mean, even before I had a brain injury.”</p>
<p>She says one of the main benefits of being unpartnered is “that you’re independent”. </p>
<h2>‘I don’t have any constrictions’</h2>
<p>Charlene Fisher, 70, Encounter Bay, South Australia</p>
<p>However, she notes, “I would never regret marrying my husband because we produced two amazing people. They are the apple of my eye.”</p>
<p>“Because I’ve been by myself for so long, I’ve become very independent.”</p>
<h2>‘Friendships are more valuable’</h2>
<p>“And I came to the conclusion that the best way to ruin a good friendship was to get into a romantic relationship and I’ve decided that friendships are more valuable to me. I don’t want to wreck any more good friendships.”</p>
<p>That was unless he found “someone loaded” with “a big property and private jet”, he laughs.</p>
<p>Jessica*, 73, Victor Harbour, South Australia</p>
<p>Jessica*, now with two grown-up children, has been married twice, the last ending with an amicable separation two years ago. “I don’t want to be miserable for the next 10 years of my life,” she says. “I want to live it the way I want to live it.”</p>
<p>With that understanding of how good singledom can be, she hopes her daughter, who has recently separated from her third marriage, may follow in her footsteps: “I’m hoping that maybe that was the last one … because she’s really enjoying life.”</p>
<p>*Jessica requested her name be changed for privacy</p>
<a>When Harry Met Sally…</a> and
<a>Sleepless In Seattle</a>. Those films, like
<a>Love Actually</a> is so rapid that it is almost a montage of empty, treacle-thick moments: it is a raid on the Quality Street tin to Annie Hall's four-course meal.
<a>Four Weddings and a Funeral</a> fulfils its own modest expectations, but it is still (to labour the analogy) just a decently made sandwich.
<p>Three films to put on while the chestnuts are roasting:</p>
<p> Woody Allen does a classy, musical Christmas in Paris: Everyone Says I Love You</p>
<p> Nora Ephron's finest work: When Harry Met Sally…</p>
<p>My friend Alex has a range of responses to the question “And do you have another half?” depending on which she thinks the other person can take. Her nuclear option, “No, I’m a whole person,” is deployed only in the most desperate of circumstances. </p>
<p>As modern, single women, we are not supposed to feel that we’re missing out. And so we feel obliged to hide any feelings of shame or inadequacy or longing. </p>
<p>When single women weren’t assumed to be witches, they were often taken to be prostitutes – to such an extent that the two terms were interchangeable, including in court documents. </p>
<p>Emma John’s book, Self-Contained: Scenes from a Single Life, will be published in May</p>
