<h1> Bidens honor Pearl Harbor’s fallen in visit to World War II Memorial </h1>
<div><div> By AAMER MADHANI </div><div>Associated Press</div></div>
<p>President Biden and First Lady Jill Biden on Tuesday marked the 80th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor with a somber visit to the National World War II Memorial in the nation’s capital.</p>
<p>The Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor and other locations in Hawaii killed 2,403 service members and civilians and was a defining moment that led to the U.S. entry into World War II.</p>
<p>The Bidens then paused at the Pacific arch on the southern side of the memorial plaza for one last moment of reflection before departing.</p>

<div> <div> <div><a>World Nation</a></div> <h1> On 80th anniversary of Pearl Harbor attack, survivors gather to remember those lost </h1> </div> </div>
<div> <div> By Times wire service </div> </div>
<p>PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii (AP) — A few dozen survivors of Pearl Harbor gathered Tuesday at the site of the Japanese bombing 80 years ago to remember those killed in the attack that launched the U.S. into World War II.</p>
<p>Herb Elfring, 99, said he’s glad to return to Pearl Harbor considering he almost didn’t live through the aerial assault.</p>
<p>“It was just plain good to get back and be able to participate in the remembrance of the day,” Elfring told reporters over the weekend.</p>
<p>Elfring, who lives in Jackson, Mich., said he has returned to Hawaii about 10 times to attend the annual ceremony hosted by the Navy and the National Park Service.</p>
<p>About 30 survivors and about 100 other veterans of the war joined him this year.</p>
<p>They observed a moment of silence at 7:55 a.m., the same minute the attack began decades ago. Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro is expected to deliver the keynote speech.</p>
<p>The bombing killed more than 2,300 U.S. troops. Nearly half — or 1,177 — were Marines and sailors serving on the USS Arizona, a battleship moored in the harbor.</p>
<p>Several women who helped the war effort by working in factories traveled to Hawaii to participate in the remembrance this year.</p>
<p>Mae Krier, who built B-17s and B-29s at a Boeing plant in Seattle, said it took the world a while to credit women for their work.</p>

<h1> Mexican kidnap-for-ransom ring that operated in Southern California is indicted </h1>
<div><div> By Gregory YeeStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>Members of a violent kidnap-for-ransom ring based in Tijuana were indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury after they were accused of abducting nine people and killing six of them, including three U.S. citizens. </p>
<p>All six defendants face one count each of conspiracy to commit hostage taking resulting in death, conspiracy to commit extortion and extortion, according to the U.S. attorney’s office for the Central District of California. </p>
<p>All six are Mexican citizens, prosecutors said. They were arrested in Mexico and also face charges filed by local authorities. </p>
<p>Yera, Lopez and Ballardo each face an additional count of hostage taking resulting in death and an additional count of extortion, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>According to the indictment, the ring was active last year from January to April. </p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>3 Southern California men abducted, 2 killed, in cross-border kidnappings</a> </p></div>
<p>Three Southern California men were abducted, and two killed, by a Tijuana-based kidnapping ring, federal authorities said. </p>
<p>Three of the victims did not have family members who could pay ransom, and they were killed, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>In other cases, ransom payments were made. Three of the remaining six kidnapping victims, including one from San Diego, were killed despite relatives sending money, according to the indictment. </p>
<p>The victim’s mother sent $400 and eventually negotiated to pay $1,000 and give the kidnapping ring her son’s vehicle as a final payment, the indictment said. </p>
<p>“I think that they are going to kill him,” the first co-conspirator wrote. </p>
<p>“Well yes, looks like they don’t want him,” the second replied. </p>
<p>The victim was killed later that day, according to the indictment. </p>
<p>If convicted of all charges, the defendants would face mandatory life sentences or the death penalty, prosecutors said.</p>

<h1> House approves legislation to allow a debt limit increase </h1>
<div><div> By KEVIN FREKING and LISA MASCARO </div><div>Associated Press</div></div>
<div><p><a>Politics</a></p><p> <a>Supreme Court poised to further open the door for taxpayer funding of religious schools</a> </p></div>
<p>Court’s conservatives say denying taxpayer funds to church schools is discrimination against religion.</p>
<p>“House Republicans can’t support using patients and access to local doctors as leverage to increase the national debt on our children,” said Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas).</p>
<p>The measure now goes to the Senate, and if the Medicare bill becomes law, it will open the process for the Senate to raise the debt ceiling through subsequent legislation with a Democrats’ only majority vote.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) struck an optimistic note that the debt ceiling plan will pass.</p>
<p>“To have Democrats raise the debt ceiling and be held politically accountable for racking up more debt is my goal, and this helps us accomplish that,” said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas).</p>
<div><p><a>Politics</a></p><p> <a>Judge blocks Biden’s vaccine mandate for federal contractors</a> </p></div>
<p>A federal judge in Georgia blocks President Biden’s administration from enforcing a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for employees of federal contractors.</p>
<p>The increase in the debt ceiling, however, is needed to meet financial obligations accrued by both parties under past legislation. The vast majority of it predates Biden’s presidency.</p>
<p>Pelosi said that addressing the debt limit will prevent a drastic increase in interest rates for car loans, student debt, mortgages and other types of borrowing for Americans.</p>
<p>The legislation establishes a fast-track process for the days ahead. A subsequent vote will be needed to pass the debt ceiling increase itself. Once the Senate has done so, the House will take up the bill and send it to Biden to be signed into law.</p>
<p>At their private luncheon Thursday, Republican senators sounded off against the plan. Many of them will not support it.</p>
<p>The parliamentary machinations struck some House lawmakers as an “absurd” but necessary way to deal with the Senate, where the filibuster rules allow the Republican minority to block action.</p>
<p>“We’re tying ourselves into parliamentary contortions to try to help the Senate deal with this straitjacket they have put themselves into,” Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said.</p>

<h1> Fabrizio Moretti, drummer of the Strokes, invites you to step into the rhythm of light </h1>
<div><div> By Deborah VankinStaff Writer </div></div>
<a>holiday light drive-throughs</a>, even religious services in
<a>backyards and parks</a>. With family back east and still working at home 21 months into the
<a>pandemic</a>, I’d fallen into something of a social slump; my world had gotten uncomfortably small.
<p>“Who were my Jewish friends, again?” I thought, scrolling through my phone. “There must be something going on for Hanukkah,” (which had admittedly snuck up on me the <i>Sunday after Thanksgiving</i>).</p>
<p>It was dusk and the view looking into my backyard felt symbolic: worn string lights tangled in the trees, with bulbs burnt out or shattered.</p>
<p>But then I found a little sliver of Hanukkah — the lights at least — visiting with <a>the Strokes</a> drummer, <a>Fabrizio Moretti</a>. At <a>Sotheby’s</a> in Beverly Hills, of all places.</p>
<a>a Grammy</a> with his bandmates earlier this year for rock album, is also a visual artist — he studied sculpture at State University of New York at New Paltz for three years before dropping out
<b> </b>to pursue music full time. He created
<a>an immersive sculptural installation</a> that goes on view Friday at Sotheby’s. It’s part of a larger exhibition featuring work by light and space artists such as
<a>Anish Kapoor</a>, a lacquered, stainless steel disc glowing gold and green.
<p>“It’s a melted cube,” the Brazil-born, New York-raised Moretti, 41, says of his work.</p>
<p>Touring the gallery, Moretti’s tone becomes increasingly hushed the more excited he gets, until he’s speaking in a barely audible whisper under his face mask, punctuating thoughts with long pauses.</p>
<a>Yayoi Kusama’s Infinity Mirror Rooms</a>, which he discovered at the Broad museum; it’s also informed by
<a>Bruce Nauman’s</a> work, which Moretti was smitten with at New York’s Dia Beacon.
<b> </b>selected Renaissance paintings and sculptures to exhibit and the younger Moretti created immersive installations, which played with light and physical space, to guide the viewer through the exhibition.
<p>Peering into “Kube,” Moretti explains that he sees light and recurring patterns as rhythms.<b> </b></p>
<p>“Punctuation is what notes are,” he says. “In patterns, you see the similarities and the distortions.”</p>
<p>“It urges you to look closer,” Moretti says. “Your eye is tricking you.”</p>
<p>So what does all this have to do with Hanukkah? Nothing, really.</p>
<p>“Oh, snap! Of course!” Moretti says, when reminded the show would be opening on the sixth night of the holiday. </p>
<p>But art is nothing if not interpretive. And a festival of lights may be found even via an indie rock drummer at a tony auction house gallery where, outside, the streets are lined with Christmas decorations shimmering in the 76-degree sun. </p>
<p>I stood inside Moretti’s work, a million fractured versions of myself shrinking into infinity until they disappeared, swallowed up by that milky white light.</p>
<p>Somehow, this version of my Hanukkah, this year, felt appropriate.</p>
<h1> How photographer Anwar Hussein’s images helped make Princess Diana an icon </h1>
<div><div> By Ingrid Schmidt </div></div>
<a>in the biopic “Spencer</a>
<i>” </i>and “Diana, the Musical” opened last month at the Longacre Theater in New York. On the heels of these productions comes the immersive photo-centric show
<a>“Princess Diana: Accredited Access Exhibition”</a> at Santa Monica Place that’s running through March.
<p>Before Diana’s untimely death in 1997 at age 36, Anwar must have taken “potentially a million pictures” of her, his son Zak tells The Times. “All archived, in transparencies, filed away in cabinets,” he adds.</p>
<p>On the evening of the press preview, Anwar sat at a picnic bench by the Shore Hotel pool in Santa Monica to speak with The Times<i>.</i></p>
<p><b>Did you ever imagine that your work would reach so many people?</b></p>
<p><b>Your style of capturing people so naturally on film is an art. Is part of it timing?</b></p>
<p><b>I find it so interesting that you were the first to photograph a royal from the back.</b></p>
<p>Yes. Everybody said, “Why did you? What is this picture with her looking from the back?” And I said, “But look what she’s trying to say!”</p>
<p><b>Which images in the exhibit resonate most personally with you?</b></p>
<p><b>Image choices like this that showed her compassion helped to create an icon.</b></p>

<h1> Smell and sound: Artist Florian Hecker turns a historic Schindler home into a sensory experience </h1>
<div><div> By Carolina A. MirandaColumnist </div></div>
<p>It is easy to describe a scent. For example, LAX in the 1970s smelled like jet fuel and stale cigarettes.</p>
<div><p> <a>Havens: Susan Orlean and R.M. Schindler, a love story in two chapters</a> </p></div>
<p>In case you are not among her several thousand followers on social media, Susan Orlean has been teaching herself kintsugi, the ancient Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold. </p>
<p>A thousand people could give a thousand different answers since smell doesn’t lie in a scent’s source, but in the intensely personal archive of experience and sensation the smeller brings to the act. </p>
<a>a book-length work</a> inspired by the nature of timbre, the difficult-to-define resonances that allow the human ear to distinguish one sound from the next. A high C may be a high C, for example, but timbre is part of why
<a>a high C</a> sung by Maria Callas might land on the ear differently from one sung by Kathleen Battle.
<a>Fitzpatrick-Leland House</a> in the Hollywood Hills. The show was organized by Ellie Lee and Matt Connolly of
<a>Equitable Vitrines</a>, a roving arts nonprofit, with the assistance of the
<a>MAK Center for Art and Architecture,</a> which supplied the location.
<p>“Resynthesizers” dwells on the aforementioned vagaries of perception. It also goes down intellectual rabbit holes related to synthesis, the history of fragrance chemistry and the nature of the space.</p>
<p>And what a space it is: Schindler’s 1936 structure consists of several interlocking geometric forms that cling to the crest of a hillside and frame views of Laurel Canyon.</p>
<p>Hecker does little to intervene in the Fitzpatrick-Leland House — at least visually. (While the work acknowledges the house, it was not directly inspired by it; some of these ideas are ones that Hecker has been exploring for decades.) </p>

<p>Eclectic designer Bernard Judge, who helped preserve the historic Schindler House and built South Pacific lodging for Marlon Brando, dies at 90.</p>
<p>“Resynthesizers” is like a Russian nesting doll of thought experiments — a synthesis of syntheses — one that is partly explained by a dense handout flyer printed in tiny sans-serif font.</p>
<p>The piece is also quite the cacophony.</p>
<p>At least, that’s what <i>I</i> heard. The thing about smelling and hearing is that our mind looks for patterns and fills in the rest. The sound of a broken music box to my ears could be a crashing piano to someone else.</p>
<p>THIS IS AN INTERNAL DRAMA STITCHED INTO OTHER SPACES</p>
<p>It’s an astute observation. The piece <i>is</i> all internal: inside of you and inside of itself.</p>

<h1> Column: Is a ‘Viva Mexico’ salad Mexican food? A judge will soon tell us </h1>
<div><div> By Gustavo ArellanoColumnist </div></div>
<p>There was nothing Mexican about the “Viva Mexico” salad I ate recently at a fast-casual restaurant called Chop Stop in Brea.</p>
<p>Besides, Chop Stop maintained, those two “potentially questionable salads … are less than 10% of its sales.”</p>
<p>In other words, Dynamic wants Nevada Eighth Judicial District Court Judge Mark R. Denton to explore the possibility that <i>maybe</i> the Viva Mexico and Santa Fe salad <i>can</i> be <i>comida mexicana</i>. </p>
<p>A hearing is scheduled for January.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Column: In Oxnard, a tamale festival persists after becoming husk of its former self </a> </p></div>
<p>The Oxnard Tamale Festival has been only to-go for the last two years because of COVID-19. But it continues.</p>
<p>But, he added: “What makes us, as the landlords, somehow an expert on this?“</p>
<p>Legal disputes about what is and isn’t Mexican food aren’t new.</p>
<i>can</i> be considered sandwiches because they’re made with “wraps,” which just goes to show how terrible the burrito scene is in New York.
<p>Chop Stop’s lawsuit against its landlord in Las Vegas doesn’t cite any of these precedents. Its defense, instead, is to wave off <i>any</i> possibility that anyone might think the salads in question are Mexican.</p>
<p>In time for Dec. 12, the feast day for the Virgin of Guadalupe, consider Tamales Elena y Antojitos in Bell Gardens and its food truck in Watts. </p>
<p>As for the Santa Fe salad? “Santa Fe is a town in New Mexico, not Mexico or Texas,” Chop Stop’s lawsuit claims. “Cafe Rio does not have an exclusive for Southwestern food or food items.”</p>
<p>Determining what is and isn’t a style of food is a decision wrought with politics, tradition, emotion and money. In this case, Adelman argues, it also comes with a giant liability.</p>
<p>“Then I go to Cafe Rio,” he continued, “and I now have to institute a separate lawsuit to recoup rent. Then it might be determined otherwise that Chop Stop is in fact selling Mexican food.”</p>
<p>Chop Stop is trying to have it both ways.</p>
<p>That’s the beauty of the cuisine: It’s not hidebound to tradition and assimilates dishes from across the world with gusto, with the United States its hottest crucible. </p>
<p>As for Chop Stop? Use better ingredients — <i>y no se hagan</i>. </p>

<h1> TikTok conspiracies, infertility myths and other disinformation hinder Central Valley COVID fight </h1>
<div><div> By Priscella VegaStaff Writer </div></div>
<b> </b>she had heard from people she knows
<b> </b>and the internet about why she shouldn’t.
<p>“Like, your life span gets short if you’re vaccinated,” Zendejas said. “You only have this amount of time of life left. Or you’ll get sterilized and won’t have kids no more.” </p>
<p>She laughed sheepishly and shook her head. “There are a lot of things circulating, and people get scared.” </p>
<p>Nearby, Michael Rodriguez, 35, said he had seen on TikTok that the pandemic was a conspiracy created by the government. He got COVID-19 in February, but said the symptoms were mild. </p>
<p>Rodriguez needed clearance to watch Mexican regional music star Carin Leon perform in Bakersfield. His wife got vaccinated months ago, but he needed a negative test as proof of entry. </p>
<p>“I’m scared of vaccination because maybe something might happen to me,” he said. “There’s videos of people who got the shot and got sick.”</p>
<p>The two showed up to the California Farmworker Foundation — but neither ended up taking<b> </b>the COVID-19 shot.</p>
<p>Such is the power of myth when it comes to getting the potentially lifesaving jab. </p>
<p>A visit to two separate testing and vaccination clinics hosted by the California Farmworker Foundation and the Delano Union School District offered glimpses into the real culprit: disinformation. </p>
<p>“You hear something, you see something new every week,” he said. “That’s just the reality. It hasn’t stopped.”</p>
<b> </b>developed a model where they hired farmworkers and paired them with farmworkers’ children who are recent college graduates.
<b> </b>The two go into the field, job sites and neighborhoods to debunk myths through QAs, first-person vaccination experience and fliers.
<b> </b>that many Latinos’ mistrust stems from a historical suspicion of a health system in Mexico that didn’t always
<b> </b>serve their interests. Morales said in Mexico there are also people who peddle false medical cures on the street.
<p>“That’s translated here to Facebook, where people post things that aren’t effective or one that says people have died after taking the vaccine,” he said. “It’s not true, but there’s a post somewhere.”</p>
<p>Those who said they didn’t hesitate to get vaccinated had dealt with the virus firsthand or had family members die from the virus. </p>
<div><p><a>Technology</a></p><p> <a>What Facebook knew about its Latino-aimed disinformation problem</a> </p></div>
<p>Facebook has long emphasized the strength of its efforts to contain misinformation targeted at Latinos and Spanish speakers. A whistleblower’s leaks show employees raising alarms about the problem.</p>
<p>Although everyone in attendance <a>wore masks</a>, Cortes couldn’t help but wonder whether those in line carried the virus. Men, women, children.</p>
<p>Cortes got COVID-19 in February. He said he was in the hospital for days, but the depression and anxiety over the virus dampened his spirit most. As a farmworker supervisor, he let the vaccine gossip rattle his nerves. </p>
<p>“Many of us have negative mindsets,” he said in Spanish. “We are afraid, but we need to accept that this is happening and we need to protect ourselves.”</p>
<p>Cortes’ experience living through the virus solidified his belief that vaccinations can protect him and others. He escorted his younger brother to get his booster that day because he said he would have been too nervous to do so on his own.</p>
<p>His youngest son is vaccinated, but his adult daughter has pushed back against his pleas. He doesn’t have the same influence over her because she lives on her own, he said. </p>
<p>“If I could bring 10, 15 people with me, I would,” he said. “I’ll bring as many people as I can. And I always ask, ‘Did you get it?’ It’s how I feel safe.”</p>
<p>He nonchalantly told his girlfriend he’d take them and get it too. “My girlfriend was happy for me — she was more excited than I was,” he said.</p>
<p>His two girls watched as their father, a 30-year-old tractor driver sporting a black beanie, chose his left arm to get the shot.</p>
<p>Perez had been <a>skeptical</a>, even though his children’s mother received the vaccine earlier this year. He said he had been swayed by<b> </b>“crazy things” he heard<b> </b>about the vaccine carrying a chip to track people.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘I’ll wait and see,’” he said as he took a seat outside to wait his 15 minutes. “I wasn’t sure. But at the end of the day, you do what you gotta do. I’m committed.”</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>California’s coast embraces child COVID-19 shots, but demand lags inland</a> </p></div>
<p>It’s a pattern that has experts concerned and could have serious implications for how a coronavirus winter surge could spread through various regions of the state.</p>
<p>When vaccinations were available, Maria C. Garcia told herself she’d give herself some time to mull it over. Then she realized she needed it because she wanted to travel<b> </b>to the Mexican state of San Luis Potosí, where she was born.</p>
<p>“The thing is, we hear so many things,” Garcia said.</p>
<p>The grape picker said the majority of her colleagues in the fields have been vaccinated. They would regularly ask her when she would get hers. Her “soon, soon” eventually turned into “later, later.”</p>
<p>After she got her shot, Garcia joined the others outside. Her cellphone rang and she immediately told someone that she had just got vaccinated. The person on the other end audibly gasped and Garcia chuckled. </p>
<p>She thought about putting off the <a>flu shot</a>. But just thinking about being felled and left out of work by that illness made her rethink procrastinating again. </p>
<p>“I guess,” Garcia said with a sigh, “I’ll get that one, too.” </p>

<h1> ‘Remember that can easily be you’: Angelenos closest to the homelessness crisis urge compassion </h1>
<div><div> By Marisa Gerber, <div>Donovan X. Ramsey </div></div></div>
<p>On a recent morning, as<b> </b>the blanket of fog lifted into the sky, Aracelly Cauich hurried up a grassy knoll at Hollenbeck Park in Boyle Heights.</p>
<p>She recognized a man pacing nearby with a sandal on one foot and a frayed tennis shoe on the other. She smiled and the two caught up for a minute.</p>
<p>“I had housing,” the man told Cauich in Spanish, “but I lost it.”</p>
<p>“I know, I know,” she said, reassuringly. “But you’re on the list.”</p>
<p>“There is so much we can do!” she said. </p>
<p>She found that too painful, but soon took her first volunteer trip to skid row.</p>
<p>“I just felt at home, I felt like I didn’t have to change. I didn’t have to put on a façade,” she said. “I could go out there and be myself. And they could be themselves without any judgment.”</p>
<p>The volunteer work she does now brings back memories of her grandmother and other matriarchs in the community who lived in service to their neighbors in Compton.</p>
<p>“If your parents were at work, my grandmother was watching you,” she said. “If you couldn’t eat, my grandmother was feeding you.”</p>
<p>The work she does on skid row often requires her to enforce boundaries and to grow comfortable with disappointment, Raines said, but it is also deeply encouraging.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a lot of stories about getting people off the street,” she said. “But I do have a lot of stories about people still waking up despite the circumstances that they’re in and coming to see us.”</p>
<a>worsened during the pandemic</a>, Los Angeles’ homeless population is shaped by steep racial inequities. Black residents account for roughly 8% of L.A. County’s population, but 34% of its homeless population, according to
<a>a recent report</a> from the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.
<a>an ambitious but faltering push</a> to move homeless people into empty hotel rooms and
<a>outlawed</a> sitting and sleeping at parks, libraries and some other locations, even as they cleared out encampments in
<p>“Sad” is the first thing that comes to Blanca Rodriguez’s mind.</p>
<p>“I feel a deep sadness,” the 69-year-old said through tears on a recent afternoon while standing in the doorway of her shop, Blanca’s Beauty Salon, off a strip of Whittier Boulevard that weaves beneath the 60 Freeway.</p>
<p>“We’re all the same,” she said. “We all come from a mother’s womb and we will all die.”</p>
<p>She said she hopes that, going forward, politicians will prioritize immediate help for homeless people, including moving them into vacant apartments or hotel rooms.</p>
<p>“The need is now.”</p>
<p>Beverly Vasquez, a manager at Nimbus Coffee in downtown L.A., said she interacts with unhoused people almost every day.</p>
<p>Some businesses in the area, as well as some residents and police, react by shooing the unhoused away, she said, moving them somewhere else — anywhere else. </p>
<p>But she and the owners of Nimbus, all women of color, try to take a different approach where they can, handing out water during slow hours and sometimes doling out unsold pastries at the end of the day. </p>
<p>One morning while heading into work during a rainstorm, she noticed a woman she’d seen before — a thin, Black woman in her 20s or 30s — and invited her into the shop for a pastry and shelter from the rain. </p>
<p>“It is a little unsettling when you see groups of people living near your business,” Vasquez says, but still she favors a more humane approach over harsh policing of unhoused people.</p>
<p>“People have to remember that can easily be you.”</p>
<p>Back in Hollenbeck Park, a 44-year-old woman, who introduced herself using only her first name, Lourdes, sat in the shade of a palm tree, folding clothes.</p>
<p>“I just need help,” she said, “real help.”</p>
<p>Brenda Martinez, the homeless liaison for the Boyle Heights Neighborhood Council, said she believes more opportunities for drug addiction treatment and more sustainable housing options are key components to reducing homelessness.</p>
<p>“Families here are very proud. They want to be able to afford their food,” she said. “They want work. They want better wages.”</p>
<p>She finds a lot of hope in the work of people in her community, like Cauich, her close friend.</p>
<p>Now, whenever a homeless friend flashes a look of bewilderment and asks why she does what she does, she gives a variation of the same answer.</p>
<p>“I was in your shoes once.”</p>

<div> <div><a>World Nation</a></div> <h1> As Mexican cumbia band tours U.S. South, every accordion squeeze brings nostalgia </h1> </div>
<p>The Mexican band Los Ángeles Azules has been making music for four decades, winning fans worldwide.</p>
<div> <div> By Kate LinthicumStaff Writer </div> <div> <div> Photography by <div>Gary Coronado</div></div> <div> Videography by <div>Steve Saldivar</div></div> </div> </div>
<p>Antonio Romero had waited all night in a packed arena here for the band to play his favorite song, a brassy, sultry cumbia he had danced to as a teenager in Mexico City.</p>
<p>It had been 22 years since he had left home, 22 years since his friends had told him: “We found a beautiful place. It’s 100% different than Mexico, but it’s beautiful.”</p>
<i>cumpleaños</i> — the truth was his heart often ached for Mexico.
<a>have been streamed on YouTube</a> well over a billion times.
<i>guacharaca</i>, carry an undeniable magic — a synchronicity of sound and feeling that flows naturally when six brothers and sisters have been making music together for four decades.
<p>“It’s a beautiful harmony,” said Elías Mejía Avante, 65, the eldest and the band’s front man. “That’s something that is transmitted to the people.”</p>
<p>Now they were embarking on a three-date run in the South, home to America’s fastest-growing Latino population, which now exceeds 23 million.</p>
<p>“I love the South,” Ordoñez drawled. “I represent it all the way.”</p>
<p>“It’s a lot of nostalgia,” he said of the band’s music. “It kind of grows into you.”</p>
<p>Later on, Elías, the front man, began calling out different regions of Latin America. </p>
<p>“Are there people with Mexican blood running through their veins?” he asked. Thunderous applause. </p>
<p>“Are there people here from Central America?” </p>
<p>The response was a little less loud, but Ordoñez was doing his part, howling with pride.</p>
<div><p><a>Music</a></p><p> <a>The hottest ticket? For many Angelenos, it’s the return of Mexican superstars Los Bukis</a> </p></div>
<p>Mexican grupera band Los Bukis will play its first shows in 25 years at a sold-out SoFi Stadium. “The music,” says Marco Antonio Solís, “survived everything.”</p>
<p>His siblings all play efficiently enough — Elías the bass, José the timbales, Cristina the guacharaca, Guadalupe percussion and Alfredo the keyboards — but Jorge is the band’s composer and driving creative force. </p>
<p>Doña Martha made all of her kids study for other careers, a fallback in case the music didn’t work out. Elías became a doctor. </p>
<div><p><a>Music</a></p><p> <a>Celso Piña, renowned Mexican musician of the cumbia genre, dies at 66</a> </p></div>
<p>Celso Piña, a musical pioneer known for his fusion of cumbia and tropical sounds as a base, suffered a heart attack and died. He was 66.</p>
<p>But later Jorge began writing different kinds of songs, laying romantic lyrics more typical of ranchera music over shuffling cumbia beats. They became massive hits. </p>
<p>The first, “Como Te Voy a Olvidar,” was a 1996 ballad about spurned love that still leaves fans singing along: </p>
<p>That included the Southeast, where an economic boom beginning in the 1990s meant bountiful work for Latino migrants. </p>
<p>They had driven three hours to the show in the Atlanta suburb of Duluth, where Baptist churches and rambling clapboard homes are interspersed with Mexican meat markets, bakeries and ice cream shops. </p>
<p>“This music reminds me of the city, of my family,” Guerrero said.</p>
<div> <blockquote> <p>“At our events we started realizing that it wasn’t just Latinos in the audience. It was also people from the U.S. who don’t even speak Spanish.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Guadalupe Mejía Avante</p> </div>
<p>As she and her husband took their seats in the buzzing arena, Jorge was backstage, warming up the band. </p>
<p>“It’s time!” a roadie yelled, and soon the musicians were hustling through the cold hallways, dressed in matching suits and shiny dress shoes. They paused for a moment in the cavernous darkness just behind the stage. </p>
<p>Jorge silently set an intention. His goal with each show, he said, is to “wrap people in a sphere of love.” </p>
<p>Then he walked out, curled his fingers around the accordion, and began to play. </p>
<p>The next morning the band took a commercial flight from Atlanta to Fort Myers, Fla. Out the windows, verdant farmland gave way to the sky blue Gulf of Mexico, then the white beaches of Florida.</p>
<p>The band members didn’t notice. Sleeping on planes is a necessary skill when you’re in a group that has been known to play 32 shows in a month with 31 days.</p>
<div><p><a>Music</a></p><p> <a>Los Lobos nearly called it quits last year. Lucky for L.A., they made a covers album instead</a> </p></div>
<p>The pandemic forced Los Lobos off the road for the first time in 40 years. The downtime led to questions about the future, then an all-L.A. covers album.</p>
<i>naco</i>,” slang for “low class.” Then, around 15 years ago, the genre began falling out of favor even among the base audience and record sales plummeted.
<p>During those years, the band members occasionally fell back on their day jobs. Elías saw patients at his clinic in Iztapalapa, where all the siblings still live.</p>
<a>Lila Downs</a> and Carla Morrison — and Jorge began scoring for violins, cellos and other orchestral instruments, a throwback to his days at the conservatory.
<i>sinfónica</i>,” resonated deeply, with several tracks — including “Mis Sentimientos,” with singer
<a>Ximena Sariñana</a> — becoming worldwide hits. Soon, invitations to major festivals flooded in.
<a>Coachella beckoned</a>. Some of Mexico’s wealthiest citizens paid large sums for the band to play at their weddings.

<p>And their fan base expanded.</p>
<p>“At our events we started realizing that it wasn’t just Latinos in the audience,” said Guadalupe. “It was also people from the U.S. who don’t even speak Spanish.” </p>
<p>But their newfound success has been bittersweet. Last year, Doña Martha died at 94. </p>
<p>“I will never find love like yours,” went a song, “Martha,” that the band wrote for her in the 1990s. </p>
<p>“Each one of us thought we were her favorite,” said Elías, who held her in his arms as she took her last breath. </p>
<div><p><a>Music</a></p><p> <a>Amid the usual pop star flash, a more inclusive and politically charged Latin Grammys </a> </p></div>
<p>A protest song against conditions in Cuba won song of the year, and Panamanian icon Ruben Blades took home album of the year at the Latin Grammys.</p>
<p>“The audience is food for the musician’s soul,” Jorge said. “They make us play better.” </p>
<p>The crowds too were ready to hear live music again and to let Los Ángeles Azules carry them once more to homelands far away.</p>
<p>“I’m ready to party!” Lucy García yelled out her window as she pulled up to the concert venue in Estero, Fla. </p>
<p>García, 60, crossed the border from Mexico at 15 and went on to found a nonprofit that helps Latina migrants. She and her husband, a musician, have traveled to all 50 U.S. states and met Mexicans in each of them.</p>

<p>In this part of Florida, there are Latinos from across the hemisphere. A restaurant might have Mexican comedy on the television, Dominican <i>bachata</i> music on the radio and Honduran baleadas and Salvadoran pupusas on the menu.</p>
<p>People’s histories and politics differ, García said, but they all share the experience of leaving home. “Migration is a trauma,” she said. “It’s a loss.”</p>
<p>“Music is like another language,” she continued. “Music connects us.”</p>
<p>As people lined up to get in the arena, García took out her phone and started livestreaming. “Who wants to be in my Facebook Live?” </p>
<p>To a stranger wearing a bright blue dress — the color of the flag in El Salvador, her native country — García asked: “Which song are you going to sing?” </p>
<p>“El Listón de Tu Pelo,” the woman said with a smile.</p>
<p>García turned to an older couple and posed the same question.</p>
<div><p><a>Music</a></p><p> <a>As country music faces a racial reckoning, a new question: Where are the Latino artists?</a> </p></div>
<p>Latino artists are a rarity in country music, while white artists wink at the culture with songs about señoritas or tequila shots in Juarez.</p>
<p>“Mi niña, mi niña mujer,” the man said, crooning a lyric from a hit song of the same name. </p>
<p>“Where are you from?” García asked. </p>
<p>“Veracruz, Mexico!”</p>
<p>“And you?” she said, turning to a man dressed in his Sunday best. “Are you going to dance?”</p>
<p>The man gave at her look that was both incredulous and teasing.</p>
<p>“Of course,” he said. “That’s why we came.”</p>

<div> <h1> The 16 most beautiful and inviting public gardens in Southern California </h1> </div>
<div><div> By Jeanette MarantosStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>Southern California is blessed with brilliant weather year-round, so it’s no surprise we have an abundance of curated and mostly public botanical gardens, catering to just about every interest and plant this Golden State can support.</p>
<p>From a lighthouse in Crescent City, to trees changing colors in the Sierra, to funky art installations near the Salton Sea, these are the best things to do in the Golden State in the fall.</p>
<p>And often these gardens don’t permit outside food inside to minimize litter and problems with wildlife. Check before you decide to bring a picnic because you might have to eat it in the parking lot.</p>
