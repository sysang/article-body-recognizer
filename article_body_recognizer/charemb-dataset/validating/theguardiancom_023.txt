<p>Four years ago, Analiese Gregory shook things up. After a career spent working as a chef at fine dining restaurants like Paris’s Michelin-starred Le Meurice and Sydney’s Quay, she packed up and moved to a small town in Tasmania.</p>
<p>The idea was to pursue a simpler, more sustainable life – one where she could raise animals and grow her own vegetables, rather than spending 16 hours a day in a commercial kitchen.</p>
<p>Whichever part of the world she’s in, Gregory rates her collection of knives as her most cherished possession. Here, she tells us about those indispensable utensils, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings.</p>
<h2>What I’d save from my house in a fire</h2>
<p>I would save my knives because they’re the tools of my trade. My knives are a mix of things I bought around the world – some are from small Japanese makers from when I walked into a tiny shop in Kyoto, others I bought in Paris.</p>
<p>I’ve collected my knives from all over the world, so they’re quite special to me. They’re all different and I’ve got over 60. Instead of taking souvenirs from places that I go, I buy a knife.</p>
<p>My V60, which is a filter coffee pour-over thing. Coffee is my biggest vice and the thing that I’m most addicted to. But I’ve cut back so now it’s about quality over quantity – it used to be the opposite.</p>
<p>These days I’ve moved into filter coffee. It’s the thing I take travelling with me everywhere, and making one is the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning.</p>
<h2>The item I most regret losing</h2>
<p>The German software engineer Jürgen Krauss shocked fans of The Great British Bake Off when he was eliminated during the semi-finals despite having won three Star Baker accolades. Ofcom later received 115 complaints from angry viewers.</p>
<p>Not making the final must have been disappointing?Being on Bake Off was a once-in-a-lifetime experience and I’m happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>I felt sad I had to leave, of course, but I was relieved that I didn’t have to do the final bakes. It would have been daunting preparing in the few days we had. I have to say the other three did incredibly well and I admire them for it.</p>
<p>I am in a happy place. I’ve got over not being in the final. It’s just one episode I missed, just one. And I know a lot of exciting things are coming my way and people are watching what I’m going to do next – and that’s pretty amazing.</p>
<p>What do you enjoy most about baking?I view every bake a little bit like a chemistry or a physics experiment. You have to be precise with the ingredients, you have to be precise with the method. And then you end up with something beautiful.</p>
<p>I was very little when I started baking, with my mother, at home. As soon as I could stand, I was in the middle of it [all], baking cheesecakes and Christmas biscuits with her. It was something we both enjoyed.</p>
<p>I love Miles Davis but also early music composers like Johannes Ockeghem as well. In lockdown, our family got together with a neighbour and played 16th-century Venetian music in our garden. </p>
<p>The pandemic has made me realise I don’t need to go so fast or do so much. I can take time out and breathe. I can be OK about what I’ve done in my life and not beat myself up.</p>
<p>Celebrity <a>MasterChef</a> Christmas Cook-Off is on Tuesday 21 December at 8pm and Thursday 23 December at 9pm on BBC One</p>
<ul> <li><p>MiMi Aye is the author of Mandalay: Recipes Tales from a Burmese Kitchen, and host of the food culture podcast The MSG Pod</p></li> </ul>
<p>Vegetarians and vegans are sharpening their knives for MasterChef: The Professionals after analysis showed it featured meat and fish savoury dishes nine times more than vegetarian alternatives.</p>
<p>The BBC One show reaches its climax on Thursday after six weeks of searing, stuffing and sauteeing, and its makers say the recipes reflect “what is happening in professional kitchens up and down the country”.</p>
<p>But the Vegetarian Society has said the focus on meat and seafood risks turning the show into “a dinosaur” and fails to reflect growing enthusiasm for non-meat and “flexitarian” diets.</p>
<p>And the Vegan Society, which believes close to a million people in the UK may now be vegan, has called for the programme to change direction to cast more vegan chefs and challenge the contestants to produce Michelin-standard food from vegetables.</p>
<p>“Are these programmes turning into dinosaurs, not because more people are turning vegetarian and vegan but because many people are cutting out meat, particularly in terms of climate change? Where is that being reflected in the cookery shows?”</p>
<p>He added: “It’s more interesting watching someone butcher a piece of meat than chopping up a carrot.”</p>
<p>Channel 5 News has issued an apology after mistakenly revealing the winner of Celebrity <a>MasterChef</a> before the programme had been broadcast on the BBC.</p>
<p>In the episode, the TV personality went head to head against the reality star Joey Essex, Strictly Come Dancing professional dancer Oti Mabuse, the former footballer Neil Ruddock and the actor and singer Su Pollard to claim the title.</p>
<p>However, minutes before the programme was due to air on BBC One at 8pm, <a>Channel 5</a> News accidentally spoiled the announcement.</p>
<p>A statement <a>posted to Twitter by Channel 5’s News account</a> said: “We would like to say sorry for mistakenly announcing the winner of BBC1’s Celebrity Masterchef before it was revealed on the programme tonight.</p>
<p>“Apologies to all fans of the show.”</p>
<p>After the two-hour-and-15-minute challenge, the actor also presented a Jamaican Christmas black cake with a sorrel sauce and a stout and rum punch ice-cream, with judge John Torode saying: “I love it.”</p>
<p>Earlier, the stars were put through the infamous invention test where they had to create a dish using ingredients found in a seasonal Advent calendar.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Curtis has been named winner of the Great British Bake Off Christmas special, as the stars of hit Channel 4 drama It’s a Sin competed for the title.</p>
<p>The actor faced co-stars Olly Alexander, Lydia West and Shaun Dooley in the Bake Off tent as they took on a series of festive-themed challenges.</p>
<p>“I never expected to do Bake Off. Having these people there, it has just been the most incredible way to end the year.”</p>
<p>The signature round saw the celebrities tasked with making a Christmas dinner leftovers pie featuring any pastry and a filling of their choice.</p>
<p>Both Alexander and Curtis earned coveted handshakes from judge Paul Hollywood.</p>
<p>West created a Tom Yum turkey pie featuring the word “La!” in reference to the catchphrase of It’s a Sin’s main characters.</p>
<p>For the technical challenge, the contestants made chocolate yule logs from a light chocolate sponge wrapped around a whipped, boozy cream filling and finished with chocolate icing.</p>
<p>It’s a Sin tells the story of a group of young friends living in London through the HIV/Aids crisis in the 1980s and its impact on the LGBT community.</p>
<p>Created and written by Queer As Folk’s Russell T Davies, it was lauded by critics and Channel 4 said it was its streaming service’s “most binged new series ever”.</p>

<p>But, as tonight revealed, Corbett’s reasons for loathing Hastings had nothing to do with that story. Instead they were rooted in Northern Ireland, where we know Hastings spent time as one of the few Catholic police officers in the RUC.</p>
<p>While she clearly misdirected Corbett regarding H and had almost certainly never set up the meeting in the shopping centre, her reaction to Corbett’s death suggests there is more going on here than simple queasiness.</p>
<p>There is, of course, another possibility: that she’s not undercover but working for someone else, unconnected to the main OCG, who has their own nefarious agenda …</p>

<p>“With respect, sir, I dispute the lawfulness of your order.” Oh Steve, it’s always hard when your heroes turn out to have feet of clay.</p>

<p>Meat production is a major contributor to global heating and land degradation, while eating lots of red and processed meat has been linked to a greater risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the government-commissioned <a>national food strategy</a> for England recently recommended that people try to cut their meat consumption by about 30% within the next decade.</p>
<p>There was an absolute reduction of 13.7g of red meat and 7g processed meat, and a 3.2g increase in white meat consumption.</p>
<p>Stewart said: “I think the reductions that we’re seeing are positive, but we’re moving pretty slowly, and if we continue reducing our intake at the same rate, we’re not really going to be reaching these dietary targets.”</p>
<p>“That was quite surprising because a lot of literature suggests that people from lower socioeconomic status groups consume more meat … and more red and processed meat,” said Stewart.</p>
<p>Another surprise was that people born in the 1980s and 1990s were the highest meat consumers, and those born after 1999 were the only subgroup to have increased their consumption over time.</p>

<h2>Leftover roast veg and harissa spiral pie</h2>
<p>If you don’t have leftover roast vegetables, or not enough of them, chop about 1.2kg potatoes and root vegetables, drizzle them with oil, mix with half a teaspoon of salt and roast at 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6 for 30-40 minutes.</p>
<p>Prep 15 minCook 1 hr 10 minServes 4-6</p>
<p>Heat the butter in a medium pan over a medium heat and, once it’s just frothing, add the onions and salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, until they have softened and sweated down and are just darkening at the edges.</p>
<p>Put the coil on a lined baking tray and bake for 40 minutes, or until crisp and golden brown. Leave to cool slightly, then slice and serve hot, perhaps with a sharp salad.</p>
<h2>Stuffed cabbage rolls (pictured above)</h2>
<p>Prep 15 minCook 1 hrServes 4</p>
<p>Slice the 50g butter, lay over the tops of the rolls, to cover, then pop on the lid and bring to a simmer on a medium-low heat. Leave to cook gently for 15 to 20 minutes, until the rolls are soft right through.</p>

<p>While the pancakes are cooking, gently reheat the sauce. Pour some sauce on to each plate, put two pancakes on top and serve sprinkled with more icing sugar.</p>
<p>The internet, and blogs, have now largely done away with a need for it, but it remains a prized, and delicate, member of the family (the children fight over who will get it).</p>

<h2>Honey-roast quince salad with blue cheese, radicchio and seared venison</h2>
<p>When caramelised, quince becomes sweet and chewy, and makes a welcome contrast to the bitter leaves, toasted nuts and salty-sweet cheese.</p>
<p>Prep 20 minCook 1hr 15 minServes 6</p>
<p>For the salad1 radicchio100g rocket50g hazelnuts75g blue cheese (optional) 1 tbsp sherry vinegar</p>
<p>When the quince is tender, put a saute pan on a high heat. Once it’s smoking hot, add a tablespoon of oil and saute the venison for only 90 seconds to two minutes on each side. Leave to rest in a warm place for five to eight minutes. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, crumble the cheese over the leaves and scatter the chopped nuts on top. Arrange the quince slices on top with any syrup.</p>
<p>The salad makes a snazzy starter or a seriously good lunch with chips or roast potatoes on the side.</p>
<p>For the custard (or use 1 litre ready-made or Bird’s)1 litre whole milk2 whole eggs6 egg yolks150g caster sugar80g cornflour½ tsp almond essence (or 1 vanilla pod or other flavouring)</p>
<h2>3 Top with the cake and add booze</h2>
<p>Slice and arrange the cake on top of the jelly, cutting it as necessary to cover – you could use trifle sponges, boudoir biscuits, panettone, stollen or plain madeira or sponge cake here, if you prefer.</p>
<p>Sprinkle with the triple sec (other citrussy liqueurs would be excellent alternatives, as would amaretto, or the traditional sherry, or a fruit juice or syrup).</p>
<h2>4 Lay the sliced citrus on top</h2>
<p>Peel five clementines and cut them into horizontal slices.</p>
<p>Arrange these standing up on one edge all around the inside of the bowl, pressing them against the glass so they stick.</p>
<p>Fill the middle of the bowl with more clementine slices, peeling and slicing more fruit as necessary, until the cake layer is completely covered.</p>
<h2>7 Leave the custard to cool</h2>
<p>Pour the tepid custard over the layer of sliced fruit, level it out and leave it to cool and set a little.</p>
<p>Spoon in billowing clouds on top of the custard layer, cover and chill (if the trifle is hard to fit in the fridge with the cream on top, whip and top with the cream only just before serving).</p>
<p>You will need 4 thick slices of panettone. Each should weigh about 60g.</p>
<p>Put 500g of mascarpone in a mixing bowl and stir in 350g of lemon or passion fruit curd. (You can use orange curd too but it lacks the dazzling sharpness of the other two.)</p>
<p>Cover loosely and refrigerate for a good half-hour before slicing and serving. Serves 6</p>
<p> To chill the lemon syrup quickly, pour into a bowl and place in a deep bowl of ice cubes. The syrup will be cool enough to use in 10 minutes or so.</p>
<p> You could use slices of open-textured sponge cake if you prefer.</p>
<p> Should you wish, you could assemble your cake as a sort of trifle instead, tearing the panettone into small pieces, soaking them with the lemon syrup, then spooning over the lemon curd and mascarpone topping followed by a layer of whipped cream.</p>
<p>I’m very fond of <a>Green Black’s</a><a> Tasting Collection</a> (£12.99, 24 x 15g mini bars), although there are never quite enough of the bars I like. There is something wonderfully complete about starting and finishing the whole, tiny bar.</p>
<a>Irish sea-salt chocolate caramel cups</a>(£5.25 for 4) – 60% Ecuadorian chocolate and vegan caramel.
<p>But my absolute favourite small bites at the moment are Friis Holm’s tiny 5g bars. These delicious Danish babies are not overly easy to get, but I have used my power for good and they are now stocked by <a>Cocoa Runners</a> for £9.45.</p>
<p>My favourite is the close to perfect <a>50% O’Payo Milk</a>. I could buy a whole 100g bar, of course, for £9.95, and there’s a <a>hazelnut</a> version, but therein lies danger. Stay small and stay safe.</p>
<p>The big day itself might be over, but there is plenty of life in the feast yet.</p>

<p>Heat the oil in a deep pan, then lower the fritters, a few at a time, cooking them for 7 minutes or so, turning occasionally, until lightly crisp. Lift out with a draining spoon and keep warm while you cook the rest. Serve with the sauce.</p>

<p>You will need a 24cm square cake tin, lined with baking parchment.</p>
<p>Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4. In a large mixing bowl, stir together the cinnamon, ginger and flour. Roughly chop the prunes and 100g of chocolate.</p>
<p>In a small saucepan, melt the golden syrup and butter over a moderate heat, then stir in the sugar. When the sugar has melted add the mincemeat and prunes. Finely chop and add the candied peel.</p>
<p>Bake for 40 minutes until lightly spongy to the touch. Remove from the oven and leave to cool in its tin.</p>
<p>“It turns out our greatest competitor on the planet is the UK government because every time they do a fantastic deal, they kick us out of that market – starting with the Brexit deal,” he said.</p>
<p>His online retail business was hit immediately after the Brexit negotiator David Frost failed to secure a frictionless trade deal addressing sales to individual customers in the EU.</p>
<a>online meeting with Victoria Prentis</a>, a minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She suggested that emerging markets could compensate for the Brexit-related hole in the Cheshire Cheese Company’s finances.
<p>Spurrell said he had pursued new business in Norway and Canada but post-Brexit trade deals sealed by the government had put barriers in place.</p>
<p>“We no longer have any ability to deal with the EU as our three distributors in Germany, France and Italy have said we have become too expensive because of the new checks and paperwork.</p>
<p>“And now we’ve also lost Norway since the trade deal, as duty for wholesale is 273%. Then we tried Canada but what the government didn’t tell us is that duty of 244% is applied on any consignment over $20 [£15].” </p>
<p>Norwegian duty on a £30 cheese pack amounted to £190 extra, he said.</p>
<p>He noted that the Canadian company Saputo, with a market capital of more than C$14bn (£8.3bn), had done well out of the Norwegian deal as producers of three of the four “premier” cheeses singled out for “significantly reduced tariffs”.</p>

<a>Christmas pastry with a twist: Mark Best’s recipe for chocolate babka</a>
<a>Nigel Slater’s recipe for lemon panettone cake</a>
<p>Veuve Monsigny, available only at the discounter, has overtaken Lanson, one of France’s most storied names, according to figures from the data firm IRI.</p>
<p>Christmas week is the biggest of the year for food retailers as Britons stock up to tide them over the holidays. But with <a>inflation at a 10-year high</a>, many households will be trying to save money by shopping around.</p>
<p>Britons spend about £400m a year on champagne but prices are up sharply as producers have been hit hard by production problems as well as the delivery issues that have bedevilled the whole retail supply chain.</p>
<a>Wine</a> and Spirit Trade Association figures. Even Aldi, which vies to be the cheapest grocer in town has not been immune, as at £13.99, a bottle of Veuve Monsigny costs £1 more than last Christmas.
<p>Veuve Monsigny has won a number of accolades over the years, including a bronze award at the International Wine Challenge, where it was described as having a “floral palate, fresh with little development but beautiful balance and restraint”.</p>
<p>Julie Ashfield, Aldi’s managing director of buying, said it was extremely proud of the champagne that was “up there with the best bubbles available”.</p>
<p>In its annual champagne taste test, the consumer group Which? ranked offerings from Waitrose, Tesco and Marks Spencer above the likes of Moët and Lanson – and Aldi.</p>
<p>Lisa Barber, the group’s home products and services editor, said the results showed supermarket champagne brands could “more than hold their own against the famous champagne houses, delivering excellent quality and great value for money”.</p>
<p>However, Aldi’s bubbly was overlooked by the judges who instead singled out Lidl’s Veuve Delattre Brut as the “great value pick”. At just £12 a bottle, they praised its “subtle, complex aromas, fresh acidity and clean, fruity taste”.</p>
<p>Sometimes I’m slow to learn life’s lessons. Never take an antibiotic on an empty stomach. Alternate water with wine if you don’t want a hangover. Keep a spare battery in my guitar case. </p>
<p>But I’ve finally learned that I am wasting my precious, and now limited, time making a <a>Christmas</a> pudding.</p>
<p>I think in the early years, the only reason family members ate the pudding was to find the shiny threepences secreted within.</p>
<p>In recent years thought the pudding (sans two portions) would then sit in my fridge till around August, when I would sorrowfully consign it to the bin with a thud.</p>
<p>But at the end of the lunch when people are clutching their straining stomachs and groaning with satisfaction, instead of the plum pudding, I’ll proudly produce my chocolate pie and Nana’s custard slice.</p>
<p>No more slaving over a pudding no one eats. I’ve finally learned my lesson.</p>

<a>Vegan yule: plant-based Christmas recipes from Zacchary Bird</a>
<p>Wine industry suppliers have been warned to plan ahead amid rising costs and international shortages of a key ingredient in the winemaking process.</p>
<p>The sector has been affected by reduced supplies of diammonium phosphate (DAP), a nitrogen fertiliser commonly used during grape fermentation.</p>
<p>Jason Amos, the chair of Wine Industry Suppliers Australia (Wisa), told Guardian Australia that shipping delays and a reduction in supply of DAP from <a>China</a> had combined to increase costs.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen prices up to five times more expensive for us in the wine sector,” he said.</p>
<p>Amos estimates that previously, between 65 and 80% of the DAP used by the Australian wine industry was imported from China. “The quantities that are required in the wine sector are nowhere near as great as … [for] broadacre agriculture,” he said.</p>
<p>While there are European and local suppliers of DAP, Amos said it was more expensive to source the product from these markets.</p>
<p>Wisa is most concerned that small-to-medium wine producers such as family businesses may not be able to secure supplies of DAP ahead of the harvest for the 2022 vintage.</p>
<p>“What we’re also seeing is that the big corporate companies … they’ve got big tenders and they’ve been able to secure continuity of supply,” Amos said.</p>
<p>Grape picking will begin in warmer regions at the end of January and last until April in cooler areas.</p>
<h2>Why is DAP needed to make wine?</h2>
<p>Grapes are high in sugar when harvested. Strains of yeast are used to ferment that sugar into ethanol – drinking alcohol – and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Yeast are living organisms that use nitrogen as a food source. “If they don’t have enough nitrogen … the ferment won’t go to completion,” Amos said. “Also, the nitrogen has a big impact on flavour and aroma.”</p>
<p>The nitrogen the yeast consume can either come from inorganic sources – those that do not contain carbon, such as DAP – or chemically organic (carbon-containing) sources.</p>
<p>Supplies of organic nitrogen, such as those produced by other yeasts – are available and could be used as alternatives to DAP, but winemakers will not be able to rely on them wholly.</p>
<p>“If the conditions are poor – and we don’t know that until harvest time – winemakers need a mix of both inorganic and organic nitrogen to optimise the winemaking process,” Amos said. “It’s not one or the other.”</p>
<p>He said it was too early to say what impact the DAP shortage would have on consumers.</p>
<p>“In terms of quality of wine produced, I don’t have any concerns,” he said. “Technically the winemakers will have to work really hard.”</p>
<p>I like to think I have an adventurous palate. I eat many things that commonly upset people – shellfish, snails, coriander – without complaint. I don’t have any allergies and I am highly lactose tolerant.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m not ready for Marmite; I’m starting with the crisps, as a warmup. I have tasted many horrible crisp flavours in my time, but when I first came to London in 1990, prawn cocktail was a line I chose not to cross.</p>
<p>I don’t even really know how to cook them. I have seen my wife prepare beans on toast hundreds of times, without ever observing the process closely.</p>
<p>“Stop making a fuss and just try them,” she says.</p>
<p>“I’m not eating these,” I say. “These are just for the photograph.”</p>
<p>A week goes by, then another. Every morning I wake up thinking: today is the day you eat Marmite. And every day I find some excuse for putting it off.</p>
<p>Singing in Quechua, the language spread along the vast length of the Andes by the Incas, they hill the soil around plants in the numerous small plots terraced into a patchwork up and down the Peruvian mountainside.</p>
<p>“In the old days, the Incas grew these ecotypes and now we continue the path set down by our ancestors,” says Juan Huillca, a conservationist in Choquecancha, a tiny mountainside village.</p>
<a>ceviche</a>, are more prosaically called chuspi sara (small corn).
<a>Peru</a> about 6,000 years ago.
<p>Long before the climate crisis, these farmers’ ancestors adapted to growing crops in different niche ecosystems, from icy mountain peaks to sunny valleys.</p>
<a>globally important agricultural heritage systems</a>.
<p>“With a few varieties, you could not face a farming year, so the response is to have many varieties. The frosts and hailstorms have always occurred and their ancestors knew how to face them,” he says.</p>
<p>With more than 180 native domesticated plant species and hundreds of varieties, Peru has one of the world’s richest diversity of crops.</p>
<p>Backed by the UN’s <a>Food and Agriculture Organization</a>, the project supports the farmers to preserve the native species, and Llacsa Tacuri and colleagues help find markets for the multicoloured corns.</p>
<p>“Diseases like stem rust or blight arrive, sometimes we get frost or hail. That’s why we have our seed bank in order not to lose our maize ecotypes, so we can recover what we’ve lost and resow those varieties,” he says.</p>
<p>In a simple farmhouse in Ccachin lies the genetic heritage of thousands of years of crop domestication and variation. Dozens of types of dried kernels are stored in plastic containers for rainy days.</p>
<p>Sonia Quispe, a maize conservationist in Choquecancha, says the harvest is half what it would normally be.</p>
<p>Julio Cruz Tacac, 31, a yachachiq, or farming teacher, who returned to Ccachin after studying in Cusco, has seen weather patterns change.</p>
<p>“When I was little, the sun didn’t shine with such intensity, the temperature was mild,” he says.</p>
<a>harder during the Covid-19 pandemic</a> – Peru had the world’s highest Covid mortality rate.
<p>The custom of ayni, reciprocal communal work, remains in these remote villages, but a bartering form of exchange, known as trueque, has been hit by the pandemic’s economic impact.</p>
<p>“We go to the market and we trade with the fruit and coca from the farmers in the valley,” says Genara Cárdenas, 55, from Ccachin. “But now with the pandemic the people don’t want to barter, they want money.”</p>
<p>Financial pressures have affected the village’s traditional way of life, but their crops have helped them remain self-sufficient despite the economic problems.</p>
<p>Even so, the climate crisis presents new challenges, says 55-year-old farmer Victor Morales.</p>
<p>“When I was young, the rains, the frost, all had their time. But today everything has changed. We had many types of potatoes and maize, now we have varieties which are more resistant to climate change.”</p>
<p>When the term “vegan” was first coined, even vegetarians believed it was a fringe lifestyle. But the image of vegans as eccentric ascetics is now itself a marginal view.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted on behalf of<a> the Veganuary organisation</a>, which encourages people to try veganism in January, asked 2,079 adults about their attitudes towards giving up animal products.</p>
<p>Veganuary is being promoted with a cinema advertising campaign featuring<a>Succession</a><a>’s</a> James Cromwell, which began today in about 500 cinemas across the country.</p>
<p>Veganism was born in 1944 when some members of the British Vegetarian Society asked for space in the group’s newsletter for people who also avoided eggs and dairy products.</p>
<a>dozens of celebrities</a> espouse veganism. Cadbury has followed food brands such as Greggs in launching plant-based products – there is now a vegan Dairy Milk, with almond paste instead of milk. The Great British Bake Off has had
<a> Vegan Week rounds since 2018 </a>and featured the first vegan contestant, 19-year-old Freya Cox.
<a>plant-based Christmas ranges</a>, while star chefs such as Jamie Oliver list dozens of vegan recipes on their websites.
<p>Yet although one in eight home-prepared meals is now vegan, according to Kantar, with less than two-thirds of meals now involving meat, most people who eat plant-based meals are not solely vegan but <a>flexitarians</a>.</p>
<p>Another lockdown-induced change – the growing number of pet owners – has led to a boom in vegan pet food.</p>
<p>Judy Nadel and Damien Clarkson set up The Pack last year and launched their first products in September.</p>
<p>“Well, you can never go wrong with bread, cheese and tomato,” Lou Reed, poet of the <a>New York</a> streets, would sometimes remark as he passed by one of the city’s multitude of pizzerias.</p>
<p>The late musician was a fan of Coney Island’s legendary Totonno’s, close to the site of of one of the first recorded pizza parlors established by Italian immigrants in the 1880s.</p>
<p>“I feel bad because everybody has had a lot of problems with the coronavirus, no jobs, everything was closed, and the food stores that were open doubled their prices. So I try to stay open to help the people,” Muhammad added.</p>
<p>Others stopping by said the dollar slice was important to their lives because it was fast and cheap.</p>
<p>Gaglani said he’d noticed that prices had been rising. “I cant imagine New York City without the dollar slice. But even if it goes to $1.50, people will still come.”</p>
<p>The search of the perfect pizza, a quixotic undertaking, occupies some minds, including that of Scott Weiner, owner of<a> Scott’s Pizza Tours</a>, which ferries enthusiasts across the city by bus in that search.</p>
<p>Both, Weiner said, can quench the thirst – “it just depends on what the thirst is”.</p>
<p>But – despite current travails – New York’s pizza love affair is set to continue. After all, it has such a long past.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty definitive that New York is the home of the pizza in America,” Regas said.</p>
<p>The custom of the single slice, which came into being in the late 1940s, is integral to New York, despite the misgivings of more traditional pizzeria owners, said Regas. The loss of it, he believes, would be a loss to all.</p>
<p>Regas recalled a legendary pizzeria<a> Di Fara</a> on Avenue J in Brooklyn.</p>
<p>“There’s a magic to pizza. There’s an individual personality to a pizza that you don’t necessary get with a hamburger or hot dog, and that plays into the mystery and drama of the whole thing.”</p>
<p>The Pointless presenter <a>Richard Osman</a> has revealed he suffers from a lifelong food addiction, but is endeavouring to destigmatise the shame surrounding the affliction.</p>
<p>He said: “There hasn’t been a day of my life since the age of nine where I haven’t thought about problems with food and how it affects me.</p>
<p>“And it will be with me for the rest of my life, I know that. I’m either controlling it or not controlling it at any given time, and these days I control it more often than I don’t.</p>
<p>“But again, because you have to eat, it’s actually quite hard and sometimes you do slip but I try my best and I certainly have no shame about it now and anyone at home who overeats or, and thinks it’s ridiculous, you’ve just got to divorce that.</p>
<p>“We all have something that gets us through life and if that’s yours, then you have to face it head on. It’s just not being so afraid of life and afraid of what will happen if you put yourself out there.</p>
<p>“That’s a difficult journey and it doesn’t come naturally to me but the more I try it, the happier I get.”</p>
<p>“As soon as you have an addictive behaviour you know that something’s up because you know you’re hiding something or controlling something.</p>
<p>“My addictive behaviour has always been food, it has been since I was incredibly young.”</p>
<p>He reflected on how an addiction to food does not have the same “doomed glamour of drugs or alcohol” but he sees them as “identical”.</p>
<p>“It’s just booze but food … The secrecy of consuming these things, the shame behind it,” he added.</p>
<p>However, the TV presenter noted that, while quitting alcohol and drugs was “unbelievably difficult”, you often can cut them out of your lifestyle. <a>Food</a>, however, is essential, which makes tackling the addition “tricky”.</p>
<p>He added: “It’s like the A-team but everyone’s over 70 and they’ve done these extraordinary things and yet they’re invisible because of the way we treat older people.” </p>
