<p>It is a joyous, gloriously noisy scene and, experts say, a vivid illustration of a British conservation success story.</p>
<p>“It is looking that way,” said <a>Bevan, a senior lecturer at Newcastle University</a>. “Some of the outer island groups look incredibly dense.”</p>
<p>The grey seal was the first animal to be protected by modern UK legislation with the Grey Seals Protection Act of 1914. About 50% of the world population now lives in British and Irish waters.</p>
<p>The recent <a>Storm Arwen</a> had a devastating effect on some UK grey seal colonies with <a>more than 800 pups estimated to have died at St Abb’s Head in the Scottish borders</a>. Remarkably, the Farne Islands colony appears relatively unscathed.</p>
<p>“To see the mothers with the pups and the pups themselves going from being small white floppy sacks to these bubbles of fat in three weeks. Then they start moulting… they are gorgeous.”</p>
<p>The population is growing because grey seals are the opposite of fussy eaters and have no predators. Until the 1980s there might be the occasional orca on the hunt but not today.</p>
<p>That’s not to say life is anything but tough for a seal pup with 50% not making it past the first year.</p>
<p>“It is just such a harsh environment,” said Tom Hendry, a ranger. “ It is partly down to how good and experienced the mothers are. It’s not nice coming across the dead ones but it’s just part of the job, you get used to it.”</p>
<p>For the first time a thermal imagery camera attached to a drone is being used to, it is hoped, improve the accuracy of the count.</p>
<p>Rangers count the pups every four days and have continued to physically spray them, a job which comes with an element of jeopardy given how protective mothers can be.</p>
<p>“I have had some close calls in the past,” said Hendry. “Because the colony is getting denser and denser it gets a lot more difficult to get in there and spray them safely.”</p>
<p>A seal bite is not something anyone would want. “They have got substantial teeth which can do a lot of damage,” said Bevan. Plus bacteria from the mouth of a seal can cause horrific, not for the squeamish, infections.</p>
<p>The Farnes, a rocky outcrop of islands about two miles off the coast, have been looked after by the National Trust since 1925. Now is the time of grey seals and in April the puffins arrive for their breeding season.</p>
<p>Precise figures from the grey seal count are expected by February next year.</p>

<p>The member of parliament for Yardley, east Birmingham, was born in the city and still lives there with her husband and sons. Before becoming an MP, she was a Labour councillor</p>
<a>Milan Sweet Centre</a> in Balsall Heath is an institution – I’ve been going there since I was a kid and every week I buy at least 40 samosas. They also do great barfi and jalebi sweets.
<a>Flock</a> in Kings Heath – a pop-up inside the
<a>Grace + James</a> shop, bar and deli – run by Alistair. It was called Flock after me and my friends as we’d go there every morning after the school run. At Grace + James itself you can get wine and cheese, and they also run the
<a>Poli</a> pizza restaurant next door – the pizzas are great but I dream about their La Ratte potatoes cooked in lamb fat with fresh mint.
<p>In the evening I often go to <a>Eat Vietnam in Stirchley</a> – they do your regular big bowls of noodles with pork, but what I love is their Marmite peanut butter cauliflower.</p>
<a>Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery pretty much every single Saturday</a>. It’s full of beautiful pre-Raphaelite paintings. I absolutely love the building: it’s such a lovely, calm space. The surrounding area has also been completely revamped.
<p>I was a bit of a naysayer about the new <a>Library of Birmingham</a> at first, as I really liked the old brutalist Central Library building, built in the 1970s. But on reflection, it is a good thing, as the new one looks much better.</p>
<p>Kings Heath, where I grew up, has a real mix of people and architecture. There are big Victorian and Edwardian houses as well as 1970s maisonettes and tower blocks. On my street there were bail hostels next door to the houses of professors and MPs.</p>
<a>Earlybird</a>, which is right next to the beautiful
<a>old Victorian library</a>; and York Road, which has been pedestrianised, and has loads of bars, restaurants and independent shops spilling out on to the street. At the end of the street there is a great pub, the famous
<a>Sutton Park</a>, which is so huge you can totally get lost in it, has stoats and weasels, waterways and forest; and
<a>Lickey Hills</a> has great views of the city.
<p>The nightlife and food scene in Birmingham is so good because it is driven by people who specialise in one thing – and the people at Couch are definitely cocktail geeks.</p>
<p>“The <a>change is dramatic</a> in just four years,” says Chris. “They engineer the landscape in a way that reduces flooding, helps store water for drought, and boosts wildlife – and wetlands are great carbon sinks.”</p>
<a>consultation process</a> on beaver reintroduction to England’s rivers is currently going through parliament (anyone can add their voice before 17 November).
<a>Cabilla Cornwall</a>, a 300-acre former upland hill farm in the middle of Bodmin Moor with its own ambitious regeneration plans, where beavers also play a part.
<p>“I used to play in the woods as child,” Merlin says, “but I only realised how healing they are when I was recovering from PTSD after being in the army. I want people to be able to come here and recoup, to simply enjoy the peace and quiet.”</p>
<a>lynx</a>. A first step was the introduction of two beavers last summer – Sigourney Beaver and Jean Claude Van-Dam (who now have two kits, Beavie Wonder and Beavie Nicks) – and the benefits are being seen already.
<p>After our woodland tour we return to the heart of Cabilla, a slick, modern conversion of old barns – with open-plan space for yoga, a living room and long wooden tables for dining, where we feast on a colourful plant-based supper.</p>
<p>“Take a bracing walk along the clifftops,” read the info board near the trailhead at Whitehaven harbour, where I began. “The outlook is great for sea watching.” On the morning I set off, storm watching Shackleton-style was more apt.</p>

<p>For the drink750ml good apple juice75ml spiced sugar syrup (see above and method)75ml apple cider vinegar300ml water2 apples, cut into slicesNutmeg, to finish</p>
<p>To make the drink, put the apple juice, syrup, vinegar and water in a pan, add the sliced apples and warm up – don’t let it come to a boil, though. Pour into heat-resistant glasses and finish with a grating of nutmeg over the top.</p>
<p>2 lemons, peeled (reserve 6 twists to garnish) and juiced, to get 50ml50g sugar300ml dark rum1 dash absinthe1 dash Angostura bitters250ml hot green tea250ml whole milk</p>
<p>Gently warm the rum mix in a pan, then pour in the hot tea and lemon juice. In a separate pan, bring the milk to a boil, and the moment it starts to froth up, pour it into the rum mixture. It will curdle and look disgusting, but that’s OK.</p>
<p>The finished punch will keep in a sealed jar or bottle in the fridge for a couple of weeks (presuming you aren’t tempted to down it before). Serve over ice in dainty cups and garnish with a twist of lemon (or a maraschino cherry).</p>
<p>37½ml Baileys15ml vodka – we use Belvedere (infuse it with bay and star anise, if you like)100ml brewed chai, cooled – we make our own chai blend, but a shop-bought one will do just fine, preferably from an Indian food shop10ml vanilla essence</p>
<p>To garnish1 star anise1 small pinch saffron strands1 cinnamon stick</p>
<p>Pour all the liquids into a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake hard. Single strain into a rocks or lowball glass filled with fresh ice, garnish with the star anise, saffron and cinnamon, and serve.</p>
<h2>Bright side (pictured above)</h2>
<p>The challenge with non-alcoholic drinks is to make them as bold and assertive as spirited ones. Chillies and ginger provide a heat that parallels that experience (a device frequently employed by 18th- and 19th-century spirits counterfeiters).</p>
<p>Makes 1 glassfresh chilli 1 lime ½saltsugar a pinchnon-alcoholic spirit or kombucha 50ml fresh lime juice 25ml ginger 1 thumb, chopped simple syrup 25ml</p>
<p>Rub a cut piece of chilli once around the rim of a chilled cocktail glass, then rub it with a cut lime. Dip the rim into a shallow plate of salt with a pinch of sugar mixed in.</p>
<p>Combine the non-alcoholic spirit, lime juice, ginger and simple syrup in an ice-filled cocktail shaker. Shake, then strain into your glass. Garnish with a fresh piece of cut chilli placed on the rim.</p>
<p>Makes 1 glassred wine 50ml sparkling wine 50ml sparkling water 50ml ruby port 25ml</p>
<p>Combine the ingredients in an ice-filled wine goblet. Stir gently. Garnish with an orange twist and, optionally, a cinnamon stick.</p>
<p>Makes 1 glassspiced gin 50ml cloudy apple juice 100ml apple 1 slice, or 1 piece of lemon peelgrenadine 5-10ml, or pomegranate molasses (optional)</p>
<p>Combine ingredients in an ice-filled highball or rocks glass. Stir, then garnish with an apple slice or a lemon twist.</p>
<p>You can add grenadine or pomegranate molasses for a seasonal hue.</p>
<p>Combine the ice-cream and the spirit in an empty cocktail shaker. Shake without ice. Pour into a chilled cocktail glass and grate nutmeg over the top.</p>
<p>Serves 6gin 100ml (use cranberry juice for a lower-alcohol serve)bitter aperitif such as Campari 100ml sweet vermouth 200ml chilled espresso 50ml chilled prosecco 350ml</p>
<p>Combine all ingredients in a punchbowl or large pitcher with ice. Stir lightly. Garnish with orange slices, star anise, cinnamon sticks, long orange and lemon twists, and fresh cranberries. Serve in punch cups.</p>
<p>Makes 1 glasscoffee liqueur 25ml vodka 25ml oat milk 50ml (look for a barista edition or similarly creamy one)</p>
<p>Combine all the ingredients in an ice-filled cocktail shaker. Shake, then strain into a chilled cocktail glass.</p>
<p>While gin and tonics are normally relegated to warmer weather, tonic syrup is now available in many shops and makes it possible to take the classic in new directions.</p>
<p>Makes 1 glassboiling water 100-125mlwinter spice or cranberry tea 1 bagtonic syrup 25ml (available online)gin 50ml</p>
<p>Combine the water and tea in a mug and brew as normal. Add the tonic syrup and gin. Garnish with an orange or lemon twist, if you like. OFM</p>

<h2>Malted walnut and chocolate chip breakfast loaf</h2>
<p>Prep 10 minProve 1 hr 30 minCook 1 hr 10 minMakes 1 x 1lb loaf</p>
<p>80g unsalted butter250ml whole milk50g malt extract, or black treacle7g instant yeast300g strong white flour120g wholemeal flour½ tsp fine saltVegetable oil, for greasing40g walnuts, roasted and roughly chopped50g milk chocolate, roughly chopped</p>
<p>Lightly grease a large bowl with vegetable oil, shape the dough into a smooth ball and put in the bowl. Cover and leave to prove for an hour, until doubled in size.</p>
<p>Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put a small tray on top of the loaf tin, then bake the bread, covered, for 30 minutes. Turn down the heat by 20C, lift off and remove the tray and bake uncovered for a further 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Remove and leave to cool before slicing and eating with salted butter, or keep tightly wrapped for up to three days, and toast before eating.</p>
<p>Migas, which means “crumbs” in Spanish, is a traditional Spanish staple that’s eaten all over the country for breakfast, lunch and dinner. To make it, stale bread is torn up, rehydrated, then fried with lots of olive oil, garlic and herbs.</p>
<h2>Mushroom migas with oloroso</h2>
<p>Put a tablespoon of the oil in a large, heavy-based frying pan over a medium-low heat. Lightly bash the garlic with the flat of a large knife, leaving the skins on, then add to the hot oil with the herbs, so they flavour the oil.</p>
<p>Add the mushrooms and chopped onion, and saute, stirring, for about 10 minutes, until dark and rich, then transfer the mushrooms to a plate.</p>
<p>While the mushrooms are cooking, soak the bread in a bowl of water until it softens, then squeeze out any excess water and rip or cut the bread into 1-2cm pieces. The bread should be damp and fluffy but not wet.</p>
<p>“I don’t like the idea of good food being intimidating,” says Eun Hee An.</p>
<p>“It’s the only traditional Korean dish that has milk,” she says. “There was one herd of dairy cattle kept for the royal court and the physicians would make tarak-juk for the king.”</p>
<p>“So it’s king’s congee, which seems pretty special.”</p>
<p>While her recipe is “nothing like tarak-juk you get in Korea”, An says it is the combination of rice and milk that is so comforting.</p>
<p>“When we were writing a menu for [restaurant] Moon Park, my weird boyfriend [Ben Sears] kept asking me about it. We made it and it was surprisingly great.”</p>
<p>An’s culinary career began when she moved to Australia to study French cooking. Once, she says, she never would have imagined making Korean food for a living.</p>
<p>Over time, however, she found herself drawn back to the cuisine of her childhood.</p>
<p>“I grew up cooking with my grannies ... I guess the longer you’re away from it the more you grow to appreciate it.”</p>
<p>An previously ran Moon Park in Redfern and Paper Bird in Potts Point alongside Sears. After Paper Bird closed, she launched Moon Mart, an online shop selling a range of Asian condiments, pickles and snacks, in November of last year.</p>
<p>Her immediate hopes for Moon Mart are to expand the products on offer but “at some point in the future, a bricks-and-mortar space that could double as a cafe would be nice.”</p>
<p>As for a dream breakfast scenario, An describes one that will resonate with many whose loved ones are in far-flung places: “I think maybe my family is there. I haven’t seen them for a couple of years because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“And I can cook. They have never really tried my cooking properly; I left for Australia straight after high school. Also my dog Bear is there, but sadly for him he can’t eat, because Korean food is full of garlic and onion!”</p>
<h2>Eun Hee An’s tarak-juk with crab</h2>
<p>Prep 15 minCook 35-40 minServes 2</p>
<p>Season the tarak-juk to taste with ground white pepper (a little goes a long way) and a little extra shirodashi, if needed.</p>
<p>Spoon the tarak-juk into two bowls, then top each with half of the crabmeat, finely julienned ginger and finely sliced spring onion. Serve with white kimchi on the side.</p>
<p>Before Rosa Cienfuegos opened her two venues – the Tamaleria in Dulwich Hill and Itacate in Redfern – it would have been a good bet that most diners in Sydney, even the adventurous ones, hadn’t tried a tamal.</p>
<p>Cienfuegos is originally from Mexico City, and came to Australia 12 years ago. Her father opened a Mexican restaurant on Enmore Road, but found customers were not receptive to the cuisine.</p>
<p>Despite some initial doubts about how tamales might be received, the food she is best known for has become a local favourite.</p>
<p>The process of producing tamales is labour intensive, and there are no shortcuts. Even when Cienfuegos is mass-producing them for her stores, everything is done by hand, she says.</p>
<p>“There is no way you can make them with machinery. We don’t use a mixer or anything, because unfortunately, if you use a mixer, the consistency is not the same. [The dough] kind of doesn’t fluff up.”</p>
<p>Each tamal is also hand-wrapped and weighed individually both before and after steaming.</p>
<p>She also shares a recipe for barbacoa tacos: lamb is steamed for three hours until it is as tender as it can get, then served on corn tortillas with coriander, lime, salsa, onion and cactus salad.</p>
<p>Cienfuegos recalls that, while visiting her mother, who lives in Sweden, she was asked to make barbacoa.</p>
<p>“I was surprised that in the shops in Sweden, they didn’t have lamb meat! They had bear, and reindeer – I didn’t know what to make with that! Reindeer tacos, I guess? That was a funny one. I ended up making something vegetarian.”</p>
<h2>Rosa Cienfuegos’ chilaquiles</h2>
<p>Prep 10 minCook 15 minServes 4</p>
<p>For the sauce2 large tomatoes, quartered¼ onion2 garlic cloves2-3 red chilliesSmall bunch of coriander, about 25g1 tsp table salt</p>
<p>To serve4 eggs400g plain corn chips80ml thickened creamQueso fresco or feta, crumbled</p>
<p>In a blender, combine tomatoes, onion, garlic, chillies, coriander and salt and blitz until smooth and homogenous. Thin the sauce with water, starting with about 150ml and adding more if necessary – it should be quite liquid.</p>
<p>Fry the four eggs however you like, then set aside.</p>
<p>Plate chilaquiles on a large platter, then drizzle with cream and scatter crumbled cheese over the top. Add the fried eggs on top and serve immediately, while the corn chips are still crunchy.</p>
<h2>Rosa Cienfuegos’ lamb barbacoa tacos</h2>
<p>Prep 45 minCook 3 hrServes 4-5</p>
<p>For the salsa borracha, or drunken salsa1 tbsp vegetable oil½ white onion, diced10 green chillies, such as jalapeno, serrano or cayenne, finely chopped3 tomatoes, diced1 garlic clove, minced or grated2 tsp salt1 x 330ml bottle of Mexican lager</p>
<p>For the lamb1kg boneless lamb shoulder or shank, cut into 3-4cm chunks50g salt1 tbsp grated or minced garlic, about 4-5 clovesBanana leaves (available frozen at Vietnamese grocers and some specialty grocers)</p>
<p>For the cactus salad200g cactus strips (optional; look for them in Mexican delis, specialty grocers and some supermarkets)1 tomato, cut into thin wedges⅓ white onion, cut into thin wedges</p>
<p>To serve12-15 corn tortillas (choose the 14.5cm or 16cm diameter kind)1 lime, cut into wedges⅔ white onion, finely dicedSmall handful of coriander, roughly chopped</p>
<p>Place the lamb in a medium bowl, then add the salt and garlic. Combine the ingredients with your hands, rubbing the seasoning in and making sure everything is evenly distributed.</p>
<p>Once the salsa is no longer hot, blitz half of it in a blender until smooth, then return it to the bowl and stir through.</p>
<p>Combine the ingredients for the cactus salad and set aside.</p>
<p>To serve, set out the lamb, onion, cactus salad, lime wedges, coriander and salsa; each breakfaster can then assemble and eat their tacos one by one.</p>

<p>“Loads of people in my family don’t eat meat or fish,” she explains. “And in Caribbean cooking it’s not a new idea, veganism. They call it ‘ital’ and that’s how Rastafarians have eaten for decades.”</p>
<h2>Winter herb and saltfish buljol, avocado and lemon-salted cucumber</h2>
<p>For the cucumberscucumber ½ (about 100g), peeled, deseeded and diced lemon juice of ½ good rapeseed oil 50ml Maldon sea salt a big pinch black pepper a generous pinch </p>

<h2>Uncle Arnold’s rum and sultana pear cake</h2>
<p>whipped cream or custard to serve</p>
<p>Cover the sultanas in 250ml of the gold rum, and stir in the mixed spice and half of the vanilla extract. Leave to soak overnight or for a minimum of 3 hours.</p>
<p>Slice the pears into quarters lengthwise and cut out the core and any pips. Line a tall 23cm cake tin with baking paper and layer the pears in the bottom in a fan shape or whichever way you fancy.</p>
<p>In a saucepan, melt 200g of the butter, the brown sugar and the remaining 100ml of the rum on a gentle heat until the sugar has melted. Pour two-thirds of the syrup over the pears so they are covered.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 150C fan/gas mark 3½.</p>
<p>Strain the rum-soaked sultanas. In a food processor, blitz the stem ginger and dates, or chop roughly by hand, then mix with the rum-soaked sultanas.</p>
<p>Pile the cake mix into the tin on top of the pears and syrup, and give the tin a gentle shake from side to side to even out the mixture, or use a spatula or back of a spoon, and allow to settle.</p>
<p>Crush the ginger biscuits to a crumb with a rolling pin or in a food processor, and sprinkle over the top of the settled cake mix, then cover with a sheet of tin foil.</p>
<p>Slip it into the oven for about 2 hours and 30 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean when you stick it in the middle.</p>
<p>Remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin.</p>
<p>Once cooled, run a knife around the edge of the cake, lay a plate over the top, tip it upside down and the whole thing should come out. Gently peel back the paper, pour over the remaining syrup and serve sliced with whipped cream or custard. </p>

<h2>Lime leaf and togarashi spiced nuts</h2>
<p>Your family shouldn’t be the only mixed nuts at the Christmas table. These nuts, fragrant with lime leaves, make an excellent edible gift, too.</p>

<p>You were supposed to pay with credits from your job, but we were able to pay with cash. For a €5 supplement, you could have something similar to the langoustine pasta here. It always struck me as the most festive of dishes.</p>
<p>I’ve included two soups, each redolent of a chalet supper, and a pasta drunk with red wine and chestnuts. These are the heartiest of winter dishes that will see you through to Christmas.</p>
<p>If you struggle to find radicchio use a couple of heads of chicory instead. Serves 4</p>
<p>chestnuts 200g, in their shell red onion 1 garlic 1 clove olive oil 3 tbspbay leaves 3, fresh, cut in halfradicchio 200gvalpolicella ½ bottle, or another red wine pici or thick spaghetti/linguine 400g butter a little parmesan a handful, grated</p>
<p>Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Score and roast the chestnuts for 10 minutes. They can also be microwaved for 3 minutes, but please do make sure you score them properly first. They needn’t be completely cooked, just peel-able. Peel.</p>
<h2>Caserecce with langoustines</h2>
<p>garlic 2 cloves, thinly slicedchilli 1, dried olive oil 3 tbsplangoustines 20, whole parsley a small bunch white wine 1 glass tinned plum tomatoes 400g, drained and then choppedcaserecce 400g</p>
<p>Steam for 5 minutes, then turn the heat down, uncover and remove the langoustines to a plate. Add the tomatoes to the pan and simmer for 20 minutes.</p>
<h2>Squash and fontina soup</h2>
<p>winter squash 1, about 2kgolive oil 1 tbspgarlic 4 cloves, whole but peeled thyme ½ bunchbread 2 thick slices milk 750ml nutmegfontina 500g</p>
<p>Heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Peel the squash, cut in half, remove the seeds and chop into pieces. Toss in olive oil with the garlic cloves, thyme branches, salt and pepper. Roast for about 30 minutes, or until cooked, but not blackened.</p>
<p>Tear the bread into pieces and bake with a little olive oil for 8 minutes until crisp and golden. Heat your serving bowls.</p>
<p>Bring the milk to the boil with a grating of nutmeg. Cut the fontina into small cubes. Arrange with the bread in the bowls.</p>
<p>dried borlotti beans 250g (or 400g drained, tinned or jarred borlotti beans)fresh bay leaves 2sage 2 sprigsgarlic 3 peeled cloves, 2 whole and 1 choppedolive oil 4-5 tbsponion 1, dicedpancetta 100g slice, dicedsauerkraut 360g</p>
<p>Soak the dried beans overnight in cold water.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, heat another 2 tbsp of oil in a heavy saucepan and cook the onion, pancetta and chopped garlic clove over a medium heat. When soft, add the sauerkraut and top up with cold water. Simmer for 15 minutes, then add the beans.</p>
<p>Simmer together for a few minutes before putting a lid on the pot and allowing to sit for 5 minutes for the flavours to get acquainted. Serve.</p>

<p>For the Melbourne-based Japanese chef Kantaro Okada, the base of a dish is of utmost importance: “In ochazuke, the broth, the dashi, is probably the most important – not the topping, not the grilled fish.</p>
<p>“I feel like in a lot of dishes the main ingredient is quite important, but for us I think what surrounds it and the base [is more important] ... By perfecting that, or striving to, we’re very confident it doesn’t matter what goes on top.”</p>
<p>“We went through, like, 10 rice cookers to find the right one,” he says.</p>
<p>279 also offers a number of osozai (cold side dishes) and desserts, but musubi remains the focus.</p>
<p>“A lot of Japanese shops are very specialised,” Okada says. “I think all the hospitality and food stores in Japan specialise in something and try to perfect it.”</p>
<h2>Kantaro Okada’s ochazuke</h2>
<p>Prep 10 minMarinate OvernightCook 20-25 minServes 2</p>
<p>For the salmon1 salmon fillet (about 120g), skin on15g (about 2 tsp) shio koji (optional)</p>
<p>For the dashi broth720ml water28g katsuobushi (bonito flakes)4g (about 2 tsp) loose-leaf sencha2ml (scant ½ tsp) usukuchi soy sauce¼ tsp salt</p>
<p>To serve240g (scant 1⅓ cup) cooked short-grain rice2 tbsp tenkasu (tempura bits)shio kombu (seasoned salted kelp, sold cut into thin strips)6cm piece (50g) takuan (pickled daikon radish), thinly slicedwasabi</p>
<p>Pat the salmon fillet dry with a paper towel. Coat the salmon evenly with the shio koji and place in a covered container, then refrigerate overnight.</p>
<p>Place the salmon fillet skin-side down in a small baking dish or tray. On a rack set about 15cm from the grill’s heating element, grill for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the top of the salmon is slightly charred.</p>
<p>Once your salmon is done, remove from the grill and separate the fish from the skin, then discard the skin. Use a fork or chopsticks to gently flake the fish into small chunks.</p>
<p>Divide the rice in half. Wet your hands, then shape each 120g portion of rice, cupping your hands together to form rounded triangular “balls” about 3cm thick. Alternatively, use a smaller bowl to shape the rice. Place each rice ball in a bowl.</p>
<ul> <li><p>Shio koji, katsuobushi, usukuchi soy sauce, tenkasu, takuan and shio kombu can all be found at specialty Japanese grocers</p></li> </ul>

<h2>Indonesian-style salted peanut and chocolate pancakes</h2>
<p>You’ll need a 24-26cm nonstick pancake or frying pan with a lid. It’s normal for the bottom of the pancake to darken, but you don’t want it black, so keep a beady eye on it using a spatula, and turn down the heat if you think it’s cooking too fast.</p>

<p>Put the flour into a mixing bowl. Add the butter and salt. Rub gently with your fingertips until the mixture is like fine breadcrumbs. Stir through the herbs, lemon zest and cheddar.</p>
<p>For the filling, put the cloves of garlic into a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 2–3 minutes, then drain.</p>
<p>Wipe the saucepan dry. Add the garlic and 1 tablespoon of olive oil and fry on a high heat for 2 minutes. Add the balsamic vinegar and 100ml water, bring to the boil and simmer gently for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, peel the celeriac and cut it into quarters. Set aside 300g and slice the rest into 2cm-thick pieces. Put them into a saucepan, cover with hot water and boil for 7–10 minutes, until they are soft and have turned slightly translucent.</p>
<p>Drain and tip into a big mixing bowl. Add the cheese, creme fraiche, lemon juice, mustard, parsley, a splash of Worcestershire sauce and eggs. Add a good pinch of salt and grind of pepper and gently fold in the garlic cloves.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Sprinkle flour on a work surface and roll out the pastry to 3–4mm thick. Line a 20cm-diameter cake tin with the pastry, ensuring a little spills over the edges.</p>
<p>Remove from the oven, leave to cool a little, then take it out of the tin. Lay a few herbs on top and serve warm.</p>

<p>Put a deep pan of water on to boil and salt it lightly.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Peel 5 large (banana) shallots and slice them in half from root to tip. Make a spice mix with a half a tsp of ground, mild red chilli, 1 tsp of dried chilli flakes and 1 tsp each of ground cumin and turmeric.</p>
<p>Remove the potatoes from the oven, toss with the spinach leaves and, if you wish, a handful of coriander leaves. Trickle a couple of spoonfuls of yoghurt over and serve. Enough for 2</p>
<p> Chard leaves are a more robust alternative to the spinach. They will take a few minutes longer to cook. If you wish, you could finely chop the stalks and add to the sweet potatoes as they roast.</p>

<p>Prep 25 minChill 1 hr 10 minCook 20 minMakes About 16</p>
<p>For the rough puff pastry (or use 500g ready-made puff pastry)225g plain flourFine salt225g very cold butter1 egg, beaten with a very little water</p>
<p>For the snail butter filling50g parsley3 plump garlic cloves, peeled100g butter, softenedSalt and pepper</p>
<p>For the cheese and Marmite filling100g finely grated mimolette, red leicester or other hard cheese2-3tbsp Marmite (or similar), to taste</p>
<p>For the spiced sugar filling4 tbsp sugar (whatever kind you like)½ tsp ground cinnamon¼ tsp ground nutmeg1 clove, groundFinely grated zest of 1 orange</p>
<h2>1 Ready-made v homemade puff</h2>
<p>Shape the dough into a rectangle, working the pastry as little as possible to limit gluten development (which will make it tough), then wrap well and chill for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry into a rectangle that’s roughly the thickness of a £1 coin (about 3mm).</p>
<h2>5 Fold the pastry and chill again</h2>
<p>Fold the top third of the pastry rectangle down into the middle, and the bottom third up over it, as if folding a letter, so you’re left with a rectangle with three layers of pastry.</p>
<p>Give the dough a quarter turn, repeat the folding process once more, then wrap and chill for another 20 minutes. Leave the work surface floured for the moment (if practical).</p>
<h2>6 For the butter filling …</h2>
<h2>7 … and the cheese or spiced sugar filling</h2>
<p>For the cheese and Marmite pinwheels, finely grate the cheese and set aside 15g.</p>
<p>If making the spiced sugar, stir together all the ingredients: don’t worry if you don’t have all the spices, and make substitutions (ground ginger, cardamom, etc) to taste.</p>
<h2>8 Roll the dough again, and fill</h2>
<p>Working from one long side, roll up the pastry tightly into a sausage, place it seam side down on a floured work surface and cut into roughly 2cm rounds.</p>
<h2>9 Chill again, then bake</h2>
<p>Divide the rounds between two lined baking trays, spacing them well apart, and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes (or, covered, for up to 24 hours).</p>
<p>Prep 50 minChill 4 hr+Cook 40 minServes 8</p>
<p>For the biscuit crumb200g plain flour35g cocoa powder80g light-brown sugar½ tsp (3g) bicarbonate of soda⅓ tsp (2g) sea salt125g cold unsalted butter, cubed50g golden syrup</p>
<p>For the tart250g biscuit crumbs (see above and method)70g unsalted butter, melted</p>
<p>For the milk chocolate panna cotta1½ gelatine leaves50ml double cream50ml whole milkPinch of flaky salt 1 tbsp honey200g milk chocolate, chopped into pieces</p>
<p>For the creme fraiche topping130g creme fraiche130ml double cream½ vanilla pod, seeds scraped out (optional)Pinch of salt1 tbsp caster sugar50g white chocolate</p>
<p>Soak the gelatine in ice-cold water until soft, then squeeze out and set aside.</p>
<p>In the bowl of a stand mixer, whip the cooled panna cotta mixture for a minute or two, until it turns silky, then spoon over the crumb base and smooth out the top.</p>
<h2>Schneeflocken Marzipankuchen – marzipan snowflake cake</h2>
<p>Heat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4 and grease and line 2 x 20cm round cake tins.</p>
<p>Once cool, put one cake on to a plate, spoon the jam on top and spread it out evenly. Place the second cake on top.</p>
<h2>Spekulatius – spiced almond biscuits</h2>
<p>Put all the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl and stir with a wooden spoon. Add the butter and mix it into the flour using your fingertips until it has the consistency of fine breadcrumbs.</p>
<p>Add the egg and bring everything together into a dough with your hands. (Alternatively, simply put all the ingredients into the bowl of an electric free-standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment and mix until an even dough is formed.)</p>
<p>Heat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5 and line 2 large baking sheets with non-stick baking parchment.</p>
<p>Bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes until golden all over. Allow to cool on the sheets for a minute before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
<p>They will store well in an airtight container for up to 4 weeks.</p>
<h2>Schweizer Spitzen – Swiss peaks</h2>
<p>Makes about 30double cream 100ml dark chocolate (50% cocoa solids) 200g, broken into piecesunsalted butter or coconut oil 30g Kirschwasser or cherry brandy 1 tbsp</p>
<p>Stored in an airtight container, these will keep well for 2 weeks. They don’t need to be refrigerated but I think they’re particularly good when a little cold, so I like to refrigerate them 15 minutes before serving.</p>
<h2>Christbrot – Christmas bread with dried fruit</h2>
<a>available online</a>, or see note below)icing sugar 40g
<p>Put the mixed peel, raisins and currants into a bowl, pour over the rum and set aside to infuse while you prepare the dough.</p>
<p>Put the flour, sugar, salt and citrus zests into a large bowl and mix together with a wooden spoon, then add the melted butter and egg.</p>
<p>Form the dough into a round loaf shape and place it on a baking sheet lined with non-stick baking parchment. Cover with a tea towel and leave somewhere warm to rise for a final 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Heat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5.</p>
<p>Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes until brown all over and cooked through, checking after 25 minutes; if it is getting too brown cover it with a piece of foil for the remainder of the baking time.</p>
<p>Transfer to a wire rack and brush with the melted butter repeatedly until all the butter is used up. Sprinkle with the vanilla sugar, then sift over the icing sugar.</p>
<h2>Glücksbringer – lucky charms</h2>
<p>These little biscuits are full of new year’s luck – shaped like coins for prosperity, full of gold from the egg yolk and decorated with a “lucky” mushroom – you’re bound to have a good year ahead if you eat one.</p>
<p>Heat the oven to 170C fan/gas mark 5. Line 2 large baking sheets with non-stick baking parchment.</p>
<p>Bake for 8-10 minutes until golden brown. Let the biscuits cool on the sheet for a minute before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
<h2>Walnuß marzipan – chocolate-coated walnut marzipan</h2>
<p>These little sweets came about one autumn when we found the ground on our usual path to school scattered with walnuts. After dropping the boys off I rushed home, scooping up as many nuts along the way as I could carry.</p>
<a>teller</a>. I asked her one year for the recipe, but she was reluctant to pass it on. The biscuit base was spread with apricot jam, a layer of marzipan next, followed by half a walnut crown all wrapped up in a glaze of vodka icing.
<p>Makes about 20 squareswalnuts 200g, or walnut piecesicing sugar 75g, siftedvodka 1-2 tbsp dark chocolate 180g coconut oil ½ tsp flaky sea salt to sprinkle on top</p>
