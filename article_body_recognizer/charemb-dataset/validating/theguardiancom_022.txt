<span><h3>Marta on Andrew</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?Romance, naturally. Failing that, someone I could have an interesting conversation with. </p>
<p>First impressions?Positive, enthusiastic, chatty.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Postmortems, food, dogs, travelling, photography, dating, politics.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?Quite a few – all thanks to the guy at the nearby table, who decided to watch horror movie trailers without headphones on.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Absolutely.</p>
<p>Best thing about Andrew?He is very enthusiastic and easy to talk to.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?Sure, I don’t see why not.</p>
<p>Describe Andrew in three words?Chatty, inquisitive, engaging.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?No.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?</p>
<p>We would have been more compatible: we didn’t have a huge amount in common, and didn’t get much beyond small talk, which I’m not a fan of.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?8 – Andrew is a lovely guy and good company. However, there was no romantic spark.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Yes, if we ran into each other, but just as friends.</p>
<span><h3>Andrew on Marta</h3></span>
<p>First impressions?She was trying to prevent either of us stepping on broken glass when the photographer’s light fell at our feet.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Polish blood sausage, a postmortem Marta attended as a student, and how expensive it would be to feed her dog Charlie fresh entrails every day.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Flawless! Marta even used a knife and fork to dissect her prawn bao.</p>
<p>Best thing about Marta?Her no-nonsense approach to life.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Sure, my friends are the best thing about me.</p>
<p>Describe Marta in three wordsFearless, forensic, unflappable.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?We walked to the tube, thanked each other and said goodnight.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I’d have brought a pair of headphones for the horror film man.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?You never know, maybe we’ll bump into each other at a Thai cookery course.</p>
<span><h3>Rebecca on James</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for? A fun night out with someone lovely, and a heap of good wine.</p>
<p>First impressions? A well-dressed, charming man.</p>
<p>What did you talk about? Stories, games, families, Norse gods, clinical exam acting, the origins of the word trivia, our mutual love of ice-cream.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments? None. He was easy to talk to and asked me lots of questions.</p>
<p>Good table manners? Excellent. He shared all the food we ordered and poured me some unfairly generous glasses of wine. What’s not to like?</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?Yes. They’d like that – because he’s a more enthusiastic board-game player than me.</p>
<p>Describe James in three words:Warm, fun, thoughtful.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?That I’m a keen talker, unable to accurately pace eating with speaking, and just as game for conversational rabbit holes.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere? We didn’t, we were still propping up the bar close to midnight.</p>
<p>And … did you kiss? No, we didn’t.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? That we’d ordered the cheeseboard as well as dessert.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10? 9. There wasn’t a romantic connection for me, but I had a lovely time.</p>
<p>Would you meet again? Yes, for sea loitering and pints as friends.</p>
<span><h3>James on Rebecca</h3></span>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends? Definitely. I think she’d get on with them pretty well.</p>
<p>Describe Rebecca in three words: Vibrant. Delightful. Inquisitive.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you? That I was genuine, but I don’t think she saw me as a romantic prospect. </p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere? We did not. We spent five hours at the bar, happily chatting away, before we realised how late it was. </p>
<p>And … did you kiss? No, although we did hug and swap numbers.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? Ask her more questions! She got so many in, I barely had time to ask any.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10? Solid 9 out of 10. Very few things could have been improved.</p>
<p>Would you meet again? Fingers crossed! But I get the sense it would be as friends.</p>
<p>James and Rebecca ate at Plateau, Brighton. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com</p>

<span><h3>Will on Kate</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?A fun evening with someone who didn’t take themselves too seriously and a good story to share with my friends.</p>
<p>First impressions?Kate seemed far more relaxed and put me at ease very quickly.</p>
<p>Describe Kate in three wordsIntelligent, open, easy-going.</p>
<span><h3>Kate on Will</h3></span>
<p>Good table manners?Yes, no food was wasted.Best thing about Will?He was relaxed and easy to chat to. </p>
<p>What were you hoping for?A fun evening on the Guardian’s dime!</p>
<p>First impressions?Cute, chatty and early.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?I can’t really remember much after four negronis and wine but: books, scumbag Tories, coming out.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?Probably when we got kicked out of the house party we crashed. And leaving my knickers behind. I think I also fell over at some point.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Excellent, we both spoke with our mouths full.</p>
<p>Best thing about Morgan?Her energy, intelligence and sense of humour. And she was up for getting pissed.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Absolutely.</p>
<p>Describe her in three wordsFun, interesting, fit.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Maybe that I talked a mile a minute and was a bit overexcited. Also that I am “cool and hot”, because that’s what she said in a text to her friends, sent when I went to the loo.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?Yes, to that fateful house party.</p>
<p>And... did you kiss?We did. A lot.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Wear better shoes for a quick getaway.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Yeah, next week.</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?Someone to break up the week.</p>
<p>First impressions?Super tall with really nice eyes.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?I can’t wholly remember. Maybe, failing sex education in UK schools and her fairly ugly but sadly estranged cat.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?I walked into a glass wall at one point and my head still has a bump.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Who really cares?</p>
<p>Best thing about Joanne?She is obscenely fun.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Yes, asap.</p>
<p>Describe her in three wordsTactile, funny, engaging.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?I think she thought I was really great, because she said she texted her friend that while she was in the bathroom.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?Yes, to a house party we weren’t invited to.</p>
<p>And... did you kiss?Sure did.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I’m struggling to come up with anything.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Yes.</p>
<p> Joanne and Morgan ate at <a>Emelia’s Crafted Pasta</a>, London E1.</p>
<span><h3>Philip on Tom</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for? A date story I could tell my friends that didn’t end in complete disaster or me finding out he has a secret wife. </p>
<p>First impressions? Stylish and cute. He has the same trousers as me … luckily, I wasn’t wearing the same ones.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?I think a photo shoot with a complete stranger constitutes as awkward. Nothing either of us said or did after that topped the initial meet.</p>
<p>Good table manners? He ate an Indian buffet without making a mess, so I was pretty impressed.</p>
<p>Best thing about Tom?Incredibly easy to talk to: it felt like a catchup with a friend more than a date.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends? Yes, he’d fit right in.</p>
<p>Describe Tom in three words? Funny, cute, friendly.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?I think he thought I was a bit eccentric when it came to pop culture, hopefully in a good way. We seemed to share the same sense of humour. Lots of laughter. </p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere? The train home. I had work the next day.</p>
<p>Would you meet again? I don’t think there was a romantic spark for either of us, but as a person he’s great and I would meet again as friends.</p>
<span><h3>Tom on Philip</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for? To break my lockdown dating drought, free food and drinks, and to get rinsed by the Guyliner.</p>
<p>First impressions? The photographer captured our “first reactions” which was a bit awkward. Nice shoes, very smiley.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments? Not really – a few lulls in conversation but nothing terrible.</p>
<p>Best thing about Philip? He was very easy to talk to, very open.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends? If we bumped into each other.</p>
<p>Describe Philip in three words? Kind, smiley, generous.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you? That I was drinking too quickly. </p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere? We didn’t, I’m afraid – there wasn’t really a spark. </p>
<p>And… did you kiss? No – and if we had, it would have been a garlicky one!</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be? The screaming babies sitting next to us – even the manager made a comment.</p>
<p>Would you meet again? Probably not. </p>
<p>Tom and Philip ate at Farzi Cafe, London SW1</p>
<a>episode recaps of Line Of Duty</a> or
<a>Game Of Thrones</a> are must-reads for fans eager to dissect their favourite dramas, I wanted to put Blind date under the microscope.
<a>Josh and Biko</a>, who answered “Did you go on somewhere?” with a baffling trip to MM’s World in London. But to my mind, the first truly emphatic 10 – one of them even gave a bonus point for “taste in films” – came from
<a>the age of endless selfies</a>. I enthusiastically join in with the directions, shouting out “drop your hip” far too many times than is appropriate.
<h2>It’s a 10 from me: Justin Myers looks back on five favourite dates, and hears what happened next</h2>
<h2>Lizzie and Tomas, May 2017</h2>
<p>Tomas said “She looks extremely cool.”</p>
<p>Tomas said “We talked about vomit, urinal etiquette, nude cycling.”</p>
<p>Lizzie said “It was really hot in the restaurant, so I kept fanning myself like a delicate Dickensian woman.”</p>
<p>I said “I don’t think she was fanning herself because of the temperature in the restaurant, do you, readers?”</p>
<a>Lizzie and Tomas’s date</a> was published in a dark week, just after
<p>So, Lizzie’s advice: get your hair done. And from Tomas? “Apply! It’s great fun and you never know where it might lead.”</p>
<h2>Benjamin and Mark, June 2015</h2>
<p>Benjamin said “We talked about our shared desire for a Georgian terrace house by Highbury Fields.”</p>
<p>I said “Did you go to the top of the page, as I did, and check their ages again? You turn up on a date with some smooth-skinned honey in their 20s and all you can talk about is wanting a house?”</p>
<p>Mark said “Introduce him to my friends? I don’t think the opportunity will arise.”</p>
<p>I said “Can anyone smell roasting flesh? Because, baby, that burns.”</p>
<p>Benjamin said “Mark in three words? Smart, musical, cute.”</p>
<p>I said “I am trying to imagine these two ‘doing it’, but all I can picture is two John Lewis gift cards sliding around on top of each other.”</p>
<p>Best not to ask, Benjamin.</p>
<h2>Martin and Almaz, June 2017</h2>
<p>Martin said “She was elegant, with a natural brightness and upbeat aura.”</p>
<p>I said “Elegant is a man’s way of saying a woman is tall and slim without wanting to sound like a judge on Miss World.”</p>
<p>Almaz said “I thought he was joking when he said he’s a Cliff Richard fan.”</p>
<p>I said “That noise you can hear is Almaz’s taxi outside. She called it before Martin even got to the second syllable of ‘Richard’.”</p>
<p>Almaz said “Did we go on somewhere? It was a Sunday night, so no.”</p>
<p>I said “Yes, I am positive the only thing holding you back from a wild pub crawl of the capital’s low joints with Martin was the fact it was a Sunday night. You’re 28!”</p>
<a>Kayleigh Daniels Dated</a>, writing raunchy dating stories as a fictional character. Now that is a plot twist I wasn’t expecting. “I just really love dating,” she says. “Any chance to go on one, I will take.”
<h2>Tom and Emily, October 2016</h2>
<p>They said “We talked about which supermarket makes the best hummus, the importance of lamps, and Lancaster University, where we both went.”</p>
<p>I said “I’m calling it right here and now that these two will end up together, for the origin story alone.”</p>
<p>Tom said “In the panic of the hello I forgot Emily’s name.”</p>
<p>I said “I reckon you could take a look at Emily from across the aisle at your favourite Waitrose and guess she was called Emily, but we’ll let you off, Tom.”</p>
<p>They said “We got the number 52 bus (we live just down the road from one another).”</p>
<a>Clean Bandit’s Rather Be</a> playing over it.
<h2>Joanne and Morgan, January 2019</h2>
<p>Joanne said “We got kicked out of the house party we crashed. And I left my knickers behind.”</p>
<p>Morgan said “She is obscenely fun.”</p>
<p>I said “Where would these women be if one of them had said no thanks to that fourth negroni? Home, separately, knickers on. It’s no kind of life.”</p>
<p>Joanne, who is bi, despite being tagged a “hilarious millennial lesbian” by fans of the date, enjoyed the positive reaction, but nothing further happened between her and Morgan. </p>
<p>She urges all Blind daters to make the most of their moment. “I can’t believe people still do the whole ‘it’s a school night’ thing,” she says. “Guys! It’s free! Free food! Free booze! But what do I know? I’m still single.” </p>
<p>The answer to that, of course, is yes.</p>

<p>What’s going for it? Yes, Rotterdam. Were you expecting somewhere hot? Perhaps more glam, more city break, less drizzly. Some kool neighbourhood in Lisbon or Helsinki.</p>
<p>The case against Heavy leaden skies, and Dutch mist (drizzle) that gets into your bones. Those who like beauty of a more conventional ilk might find it challenging.</p>
<p>Hang out at… The fish counters in Markthal, for raw herring and a beer perched on a stool. Or try it cooked at the romantic harbourside brasserie, Hotel New York. Great Indonesian and Surinamese places, too. Fenix Food Factory for the foodies.</p>
<p>Wouter Vanstiphout ‘Rotterdam West, a 19th-century workers district: amazingly diverse. Art, architecture, film and poetry are a real force.’</p>

<p>My aunt Margaret Waddy, who has died aged 77 of a pulmonary embolism, was a horticulturist and a teacher, a quiz fan and a committed volunteer with Samaritans in <a>Cambridge</a>.</p>
<p>When the PBI was taken over by Monsanto in 2014, she retired from her job, but continued at Bottisham College until 2018. She was devoted to her students, many of whom kept in touch afterwards with news of their careers. </p>
<p>Margaret was a member of Samaritans, and for the rest of her life devoted much time and energy to volunteering – not only as a listener, but also helping with recruitment and training. She was briefly director of the Cambridge branch.</p>
<a>brief letters</a>. She often entered and won competitions, including the prize for imagining the worst opening sentence to a book.
<p>Her house in Cambridge had a narrow but elongated garden, which Margaret filled with shrubs, flowers and fruit trees.</p>
<p>She had a capacity to communicate with real warmth, based on genuine interest in people. </p>
<p>She is survived by four siblings and 10 nephews and nieces; another niece, Jen Lander, died in 2017. </p>

<p>Well connected? Trains: hourly to Carlisle and the west coast mainline, every two hours to Glasgow (1hr 45 mins). Driving: 25 mins to Lockerbie and the M74, 30 mins to the beaches at Mersehead Sands, 50 mins to Carlisle.</p>
<p>Hang out at… I had a lovely welcome at the Globe Inn and the Cavens Arms. (It wasn’t a pub crawl, honest.)</p>

<p>Schools Primaries: Whitchurch Community, just out of town, is “good”, says Ofsted, and St Rumon’s CofE Infants “outstanding”. Secondaries: Tavistock College is “good”.</p>

<p>Well connected? Trains: hourly to Colchester (40 mins), from whence the rest of the galaxy, or at least the mainline to London, Ipswich and Norwich. Driving: 40 mins to Colchester, 30 mins to the A12, 20 mins to Clacton.</p>
<p>Schools Primaries: Walton-on-the-Naze and Frinton-on-Sea are both “good”, says Ofsted. Secondaries: Tendring Technology College is “good”.</p>
<p>Hang out at… Hipkins tea room, nursing a steaming cuppa, gazing wistfully over the beach huts. Had a lovely fry-up in the Round Table family restaurant.</p>
<p>Anna de Pass “You can’t get artisan bread or a proper coffee. But that is its charm.”</p>

<p>The case against Rain, rain, go away, go away. Please. Just occasionally. Traffic can be a big problem. A touch on the dour side: embrace the drizzle, adore the grey.</p>
<p>Hang out at… The place has flooded with interesting bars, pubs and cultural venues lately. Hyssop is a fine spot, which has opened after a series of pop-ups.</p>
<p>Bargain of the week Two-bedroom Victorian semi close to the centre and Old Glossop; could do with a spruce-up; £175,000, with space4living.com.</p>

<p>The case against Conservative with a small c, though you can find edgier spots deep in its folds. Not cheap, though mildly cheaper than many other places hereabouts.</p>
<p>Schools Primaries: pretty much all “good”, Ofsted says, with Burwash CE, Maynards Green, Parkside, Netherfield and Goudhurst Kilndown CofE “outstanding”. Secondaries: Heathfield, Uplands and Robertsbridge are all “good” and Cranbrook “outstanding”.</p>
<p>Hang out at… You won’t want for idyllic country pubs, such as the Bell at Ticehurst, the Salehurst Halt, or the George in Robertsbridge. The Small Holding, at Kilndown, is the local gastronauts’ darling.</p>
<p>Richard Sutton-Smith “Even its dyed-in-the-wool blueness can’t detract from the area’s beauty.”</p>

<p>The case against Not a lot. Even the hours you have to put in to get to other big towns or cities seem worth it when you’re home.</p>
<p>Hang out at… There’s a good local food scene at spots like Rocpool and the Kitchen. Mamils take their coffee at Velocity. Dance like a whirligig at Hootananny’s folk nights.</p>
<p>Owen Smith “Cross country skiing in my lunch break.”</p>
<p>Harriet Dempster “Velocity cafe and bike workshop: a lovely community space with a friendly relaxed vibe, tasty veggie food and yummy cakes.” </p>

<p>The case against Not, in the main, a beauty, although it has its moments. Heavily sliced by infrastructure: the North Circular, spaghetti clusters of mainline railways, the Grand Union canal.</p>
<p>Hang out at… Awash with south Asian cafes and restaurants. I’m fond of the “delectable chaats” at Saravanaa Bhavan, but the banana dosas at Dosa Express... phewee.</p>
