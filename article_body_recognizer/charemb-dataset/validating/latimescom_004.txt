<div><div> By Jeanette MarantosStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>It’s almost Thanksgiving<i> (How did this happen?!)</i>, and the holidays are definitely upon us, with festive light shows blooming at many SoCal botanic gardens. My neighbors are already lacing their yards with lights. </p>
<a>excellent video</a> explaining how, if you can’t make one of the classes below.) November is also a great time to
<a>start a compost pile,</a> even if it’s just raking a pile of leaves into a corner of your property to break down over the winter.
<a>Los Angeles County Public Works</a>, for instance, still offers classes online and bins for $40. Smaller worm composting bins, a good size for a balcony, are $65. Check what’s available from your local jurisdiction.

<h2> Ahwahnee Hotel, Yosemite National Park </h2>
<div> Yosemite Valley Hotel </div>
<a>ice skating</a> on a seasonal rink in the valley’s Curry Village.
<b>Pro tip:</b> If you care more about amenities than historic grandeur (and you’re splurging), consider the intimate
<a>Chateau du Sureau</a> in Oakhurst (10 rooms) or the large
<a>Tenaya Lodge</a> in Fish Camp (352 rooms). They’re along Highway 41, a 60- to 90-minute drive south of Yosemite Valley.Also consider the
<a>special rules</a>. (2022’s most likely dates are Feb. 13-25.)
<div> <div><a> 1 Ahwahnee Drive, Yosemite Valley, California 95389 </a></div> </div>
<div> Big Bear Mountain resort </div>
<a>Big Bear Mountain Resort</a>, and lift tickets are interchangeable. The resort has set its ski season opening days: Thursday (passholders) and Friday (everyone else).If you’re going to attempt to ski and surf in one day, you might start or end at
<a>Snow Valley</a> (12 lifts, 29 trails, 240 skiable acres) in nearby Running Springs, 10 miles closer to the coast than Snow Summit and Bear Mountain. (For more on California winter resorts, including
<a>Mt. Baldy</a> in the San Gabriel Mountains, visit
<a>Midnight Moon Cabins</a> to your basic
<b>Pro tip:</b> Need a mountain breakfast?
<a>Grizzly Manor</a> (7 a.m. to 2 p.m. daily) in Big Bear Lake is known for big portions and irreverent attitude. Or, to quote the website, “bland food and salty staff.”
<div> <div><a> 880 Summit Blvd., Big Bear Lake, California 92315 </a></div> </div>
<h2> California State Railway Museum </h2>
<b>Pro tip:</b> The 4.2-mile Sacramento River Bike Trail runs right past the museum, and Amtrak’s Sacramento Valley Station is a five-minute walk away.
<div> <div><a> 111 I St., Sacramento, California 95814 </a></div> </div>
<a>Robin’s Restaurant</a> (a mainstay for more than 25 years), slurp chowder at the
<a>Sea Chest Oyster Bar</a> or dig into olallieberry pie at
<a>Linn’s Restaurant</a> (more than 30 years). The Cambria Pines Lodge hosts an annual
<a>Cambria Christmas Market</a> (2 million lights promised; through Dec. 23 this year).Be warned, however, that Cambria has been struggling with
<a>water shortages</a> since long before the current drought. If you go, be quick in the shower and frugal with the faucet.
<b>Pro tip:</b> Don’t forget San Simeon, nine miles up the road. With
<a>Hearst Castle</a> closed for at least six more months, the lodgings of San Simeon are hungry. The
<a>Cavalier Oceanfront Resort</a> offers lots of family-friendly open space and blufftop fire pits.
<div> <div><a>Click for directions</a></div> </div>
<div> Berkeley Restaurant </div>
<b>Pro tip: </b>This stretch of Shattuck Avenue, known as the “gourmet ghetto,” also includes the
<a>Cheese Board Collective</a>, just across the street from Chez Panisse and founded in the same year. Besides the bakery’s array of cheeses and breads, it has a pizzeria next door with outdoor tables, which Chez Panisse lacks.
<div> <div><a> 1517 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, California 94709 </a></div> </div>
<div> San Francisco Attraction </div>
<b>Pro tip:</b> The tiny Golden Gate Fortune Cookies factory (on Ross Alley since 1962) and the
<a>Chinatown Kite Shop</a> (on Grant Avenue since 1969) are fascinating stops for families with young children.
<div> Anaheim Amusement park </div>
<a>raised admission fees</a> in October.
<div> <div><a> 1313 Disneyland Drive, Disneyland, California 92802 </a></div> </div>
<h2> Downtown Culver City </h2>
<div> Culver City Attraction </div>
<a>Pizzette</a> from Nancy Silverton and the rooftop
<a>Bar Bohemien</a>.Couples and families linger at
<a>Culver Steps,</a> a combination of public space, retail and office space completed in 2019. Kids play amid the water jets of the
<a> Lion’s Fountain</a> in the Town Plaza.At the center of the action stands the Culver Hotel (established 1924), whose quirky flatiron shape is filled with 46 rooms and a restaurant and lobby bar (closed for now).Also nearby: the
<a>Shay Hotel</a> (opened in October), Sony Pictures studio (sorry, no tours), the
<a>Kirk Douglas Theater</a>, the
<a>Ripped Bodice</a> (an all-romance bookshop), the
<a>Museum of Jurassic Technology</a> (open by appointment, perplexing by design), the indie-spirited shopping center
<a>Helms Bakery District</a>, where furniture and design shops and other retailers have taken over a landmark 1931 bakery complex.

<a>expected to reopen</a> until January at the earliest. For details on all California ski areas, check
<b>Pro tip:</b> Whatever the season, make time to see the south shore’s
<a>Emerald Bay State Park</a>, perhaps the most photogenic corner of an extremely camera-ready lake.
<div> <div><a> 4080 Lake Tahoe Blvd., South Lake Tahoe, California 96150 </a></div> </div>
<h2> Hotel Del Coronado skating rink </h2>
<div> Coronado Ice skating rink </div>
<b>Pro tip:</b> Someone may try to tell you about Kate Morgan, a young woman who was shot to death in 1892 and is said to haunt her old room at the Del. Yes, she died. But does every old building need a hokey ghost story to make it interesting? No.
<div> <div><a> 1500 Orange Ave., Coronado, California 92118 </a></div> </div>
<a>inns, vacation rentals and casual eateries</a>. For hiking, snow play, climbing or camping, the
<a>Idyllwild Nature Center</a> (open Thursday through Sunday, about 1 mile northwest of town) is one place to start.
<a>Mt. San Jacinto State Park</a> begins at the edge of town, and
<a>Idyllwild Regional Park</a> has five trails and 88 campsites on its 202 acres.Need food and caffeine?

<div> Death Valley Hotel </div>
<div> <div><a> California 190, Death Valley, California 92328 </a></div> </div>
<div> Buena Park Amusement park </div>
<b>Pro tip:</b> On the long-popular
<a>Silver Bullet</a> ride, you go upside down six times in about two minutes, rising up to 146 feet above the ground, then swooping again. Maybe try that before your meal at
<a>Mrs. Knott’s Chicken Dinner restaurant</a>, not after.
<div> <div><a> 8039 Beach Blvd., Buena Park, California 90620 </a></div> </div>
<div> Lake Arrowhead Attraction </div>
<a>Saddleback Inn</a>, which dates to 1917, offers 14 rooms, 20 cottages and
<a>Diane’s Saddleback Grill</a>.Nearby Skypark at
<a>Santa’s Village</a> is big with families. Day passes through Jan. 2 go for $69 per adult, $59 per child (ages 4-12).
<b>Pro tip: </b>The lake has a tour boat. Head to LeRoy’s Board Shop and buy tickets for an hourlong narrated cruise on the 65-passenger Arrowhead Queen ($24.95 per adult, $19.95 per child ages 3-11).

<div> <div><a> One Legoland Drive, Carlsbad, California 92008 </a></div> </div>
<div> Mammoth Lakes Mountain resort </div>
<a>hotel rooms, condos, BBs, rental cabins and homes</a>.The resort includes
<a>about $119-$167</a> on weekends.Although most visitors drive up Highway 395 to reach the mountain (310 miles north of L.A. City Hall), this winter through April 4,
<a>Advanced Air</a> is offering several public charter flights per week to
<a>Hawthorne, Burbank and Carlsbad</a>. Also, on Dec. 19,
<a>United</a> begins seasonal daily service between Los Angeles International Airport and
<a>Bishop</a> airport, about 50 miles southeast of Mammoth.For details and updates on the slopes at Mammoth, check
<b>Pro tip: </b>For a more quiet, intimate snow escape, head for
<a>Tamarack Lodge,</a> a lakeside log-cabin inn and restaurant with an inviting stone fireplace and cross-country ski center. It’s about a mile from Mammoth Mountain. Built in 1924, it includes 11 guest rooms, 37 cabins and a gourmet restaurant,
<a>the Lakefront</a> (dinner only).
<div> <div><a> 10001 Minaret Road, Mammoth Lakes, California 93546 </a></div> </div>
<h2> McCabe's Guitar Shop </h2>
<div> Santa Monica Entertainment Venue </div>
<b>Pro tip: </b>Singer-songwriter Janis Ian, who got famous in the ‘70s with her song “At 17,” is due to play McCabe’s in March on the brink of her 71st birthday.
<div> <div><a> 3101 Pico Blvd., Santa Monica, California 90405 </a></div> </div>
<a>Gallery Bookshop</a> and the almost gritty
<a>Dick’s Place</a> bar. Nary a franchise in sight.
<a>Cafe Beaujolais</a> has been a favorite spot for special dinners, but the meal I loved most on my last visit was a vegetarian Southern dinner at
<a>Fog Eater Cafe,</a> which opened in 2019.
<div> <div><a> 45080 Main St., Mendocino, California 95460 </a></div> </div>
<div> Riverside Attraction </div>
<a>Overnight stays</a> start at $229.) While you’re there, raise a glass to hotel owner
<a>Duane Roberts,</a> a local boy who made his first fortune selling frozen burritos.

<div> <div><a> 1363 Old Globe Way, San Diego, California 92101 </a></div> </div>
<div> Olympic Valley Attraction </div>
<b>Pro tip:</b> In the Village at Palisades Tahoe, you’ll get hearty portions at
<a>Tremigo Mexican Kitchen</a> (where I loved my carne asada but couldn’t finish it) and Guinness on tap at the Auld Dubliner a few steps away.

<h2> Piedras Blancas Elephant Seal Rookery </h2>
<div> San Simeon Attraction </div>
<b>Pro tip:</b> Nineteenth-century fishermen nearly wiped out these creatures, using their blubber for
<a>lamp oil and lubrication</a>. But the tide turned in 1922, when Mexico gave the animals
<a>protected status</a>. The U.S. soon followed.As numbers grew, a colony showed up at Piedras Blancas in the early 1990s and has been growing ever since. Elephant seals also are common at

<div> <h2>Part 1: The Real Thing</h2> <h1>Dirty John</h1> <p> By Christopher Goffard </p> <p> <time> Oct. 1, 2017 </time> </p> </div>
<p>Their first date was at Houston’s, a restaurant in Irvine, where he opened the door for her and put her napkin on her lap. Candles flickered along the polished-mahogany bar; jazz drifted from speakers; conversation purred.</p>
<p>His name was John Meehan. He had thick dark hair and a warm, friendly smile that invited trust. His eyes were hazel-green, with the quality of canceling out the whole of the world that wasn’t her, their current focus.</p>
<p>He said he had a couple of kids. That he owned houses in Newport Beach and Palm Springs. That he happened to worship at her church, Mariners. That he would love to meet her grandkids.</p>
<p>And he told her that she stopped his heart, she was so beautiful. She was just his type. Her last serious boyfriend had wounded her, in parting, when he said she wasn’t.</p>
<p>John began caressing her back. She thought this was moving a little fast, but she decided to allow it. The intensity of his attention was flattering.</p>
<p>She brought John back to her penthouse, just up the block. They kissed. He wanted it to go further. “This feels incredible,” he said, stretching out on her bed.</p>
<p>She thought, “It’s just a mattress.”</p>
<p>She became uncomfortable. It turned into a fight. He just didn’t want to leave, and she had to insist.</p>
<p>She went to bed thinking, “Jerk.”</p>
<p>She thought, “Cross off another one.”</p>
<p>She designed model homes and clubhouses. She liked to hire single women and mothers because she could remember how it felt to be alone, with one child and another on the way, after her first marriage broke up.</p>
<p>That day he called to say he was sorry. He knew he’d overstepped. He just wanted to spend every minute with her.</p>
<p>“So you are the real thing,” she texted him after one date.</p>
<p>“Best thing that will ever happen to you,” he replied.</p>
<p>He began spending the night regularly at her Irvine penthouse. Her 24-year-old daughter, Jacquelyn, who lived there with her, made it clear she thought he looked like a loser. Maybe even homeless.</p>
<p>Debra wasn’t about to tell her kids that John would be moving in with her. She knew what they’d say — that she was moving too fast, acting with her heart, repeating old mistakes.</p>
<p>What her kids didn’t see was how well he treated her. How he brought her coffee in the morning. Got her groceries. Took her Tesla and Range Rover in for maintenance. Carried her purse.</p>
<p>She was convinced that her kids would understand how wonderful he was once they got to know him. She thought that if any of her kids would give him a chance, it was Terra, her youngest.</p>
<p>The family’s quietest, most docile member liked to daydream about the end of the world.</p>
<p>At 23, Terra watched and rewatched every episode of “The Walking Dead.” She spoke of the series less as entertainment than as a primer on how to survive apocalyptic calamity.</p>
<p>She made careful note of why some characters lived and others perished. It had to do with vigilance and quick reflexes and the will to fight. “The world ends,” she would say, “and those who are fit to survive will survive.”</p>
<p>She was as nonconfrontational as her sister Jacquelyn was assertive. The first word people used to describe her was “sweet.”</p>
<p>She felt protective of her mom and wondered why a guy who sounded as good as John would still be single. Her skepticism only deepened when she and Jimmy drove out to Southern California and met him.</p>
<p>Terra’s three dogs seemed anxious around John. She thought maybe they were picking up on her own unease.</p>
<p>Terra and her boyfriend moved into the spare bedroom of the new Balboa Island rental for a few days. This made it hard for Debra to maintain the illusion that John wasn’t really living there, though she tried.</p>
<p>Here came John, instantly transformed by rage. Why was Terra snooping through his stuff? Why was she trying to steal Debra from him? Did she realize that kids should be smacked for this?</p>
<p>Terra screamed at her mother: “How could you let this guy talk to me like this?!”</p>
<p>Terra left, badly shaken, with the sickening feeling that her mother was choosing John over her.</p>
<p>“They’re jealous.”</p>
<p>That was John’s explanation for her kids’ hostility to him. They didn’t want her to be happy. They just wanted her dead, so they could collect.</p>
<p>He had an explanation for why he had a nursing degree but called himself a doctor. He said he had a PhD, which earned him the title, plus advanced training in anesthesiology.</p>
<p>At the big Thanksgiving party the next day, it was impossible to ignore the sudden fissures in the family — impossible to ignore Terra’s absence. But others were willing to give John a chance.</p>
<p>Debra’s mother, Arlane, thought he dressed tackily, especially for Thanksgiving. But she made allowances for a busy professional. And he was so nice and courteous. “I think he’s a great guy,” she told Debra.</p>
<p>When Jacquelyn showed up, John asked for a private word with her. She announced that he was the devil, that anything he had to say he could say in public.</p>
<p>To John, this was more evidence that Debra’s kids were spoiled and out of control. His words tugged at her anxieties.</p>
<p>She wanted a professional’s objective advice. She found a therapist, who assessed the family dynamics and told Debra she needed to establish firmer boundaries with her children.</p>
<p>If they wanted to come over, they had to be invited. They couldn’t yell at her. They couldn’t try to run her life.</p>
<p>They couldn’t sabotage her happiness — she had a right to it, just like anybody else. If John was the man she had chosen, it was her business.</p>
<p>They were living inside a postcard. They walked the island hand-in-hand. He doted on passing babies and dogs. He liked to play-wrestle her grandkids. He acted like a kid himself, vulnerable and sweet, and single-mindedly besotted with her.</p>
<p>He liked to pose shirtless and take selfies of his washboard abs. She smiled when he’d stop in front of a mirror and say, “Damn! I’m good-looking.”</p>
<p>Wardrobe-wise, she thought he was kind of a mess, with his baggy pants and University of Arizona sweatshirts. He said his clothes had been stolen while he was in Iraq.</p>
<p>“Dress me,” he told her. “I want to please you.”</p>
<p>She took him to Brooks Brothers. She bought him shoes, dress shirts, slacks, a tweed sport coat, form-fitting cashmere sweaters — deep burgundy, navy blue. He looked good in darker tones and pastels. It felt like having a new doll.</p>
<p>He kept begging her to marry him, and she kept resisting, until she couldn’t. In early December, she was driving to Vegas on business, and he was tagging along. Why not drop by the courthouse?</p>
<p>Debra would say, “I felt this was an opportunity to love again.”</p>
<p>She kept it a secret as the weeks passed and Christmas approached. The family planned to have their traditional Christmas get-together at the Orange County home of Debra’s eldest daughter, Nicole.</p>
<p>Jacquelyn refused to go. Terra was torn. She desperately wanted to spend the holiday with her little nieces and nephews, but she didn’t even want to look at John.</p>
<p>Terra went to a therapist with her mom. They came to an understanding that Terra and John would keep their distance during the party.</p>
<p>The day came, and John bustled in with his arms full of presents for the children — dozens of presents Debra had bought. The kids surrounded him. Terra began crying hysterically. It became a scene.</p>
<p>“You promised he wouldn’t hang out with the kids,” Terra told her mom.</p>
<p>Terra’s grandmother found her in the family room, trembling and crying.</p>
<p>“I just want to leave,” Terra said. “I don’t like him. There’s something about him.”</p>
<p>She knew some people still thought of her as the little girl who needed attention. It was sometimes a fight to be taken seriously, and she would question the intensity of her own feelings.</p>
<p>In early 2015, Terra was back home in Vegas, with Jimmy and their dogs. Terra wasn’t talking to her mom. She just hoped John would go away.</p>
<p>Back in Orange County, Jacquelyn was thinking about John’s fingernails. They were dirty.</p>
<p>She had spent time around doctors, during the time she worked in sales for a plastic surgeon. Their nails were meticulously clipped and scrubbed.</p>
<p>Plus, the doctors she had known did not go everywhere in their scrubs, as John did. She thought he looked like a man wearing a costume.</p>
<p>Something else was wrong with John’s scrubs: the bottoms were frayed around the heels as if they belonged to a medical-office receptionist who ran errands in tennis shoes.</p>
<p>Jacquelyn told her to think about the loser she was dating. She thought her mom, so nice and trusting and naive, had no idea who he was.</p>
<p>When she told Terra what she was doing, Terra asked, “What if he hurts her?”</p>
<p>In Debra Newell’s family, the question carried a freight of unspoken dread, because the worst had happened before.</p>
<p>In 1984, her older sister, Cindi, had been trying to escape a husband she described as controlling and possessive. One day he pressed a handgun against the back of her neck and pulled the trigger.</p>
<p>It was the reason Debra hated firearms. It was the reason she refused to have one around, long after people began warning her that she needed one.</p>

<h1> Comedians wanted Spotify to pay them more royalties. Their albums were removed </h1>
<div><div> By Ryan FaughnderStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>To take a page from Spotify Wrapped — the audio streaming giant’s year-end viral marketing campaign — one of this newsletter’s top genres is “copyright disputes.”</p>
<p>So, of course, I’m fascinated by the recent beef between <a>Spotify and a number of famous comedians</a> whose recordings were taken off the platform amid an effort by artists to extract more money from Daniel Ek’s Swedish streamer.</p>
<i>music</i> compensation works. There are two main types of royalties in recorded music — those for performers and those for songwriters and composers.
<p>The comedians argue that Spotify, as well as other companies including Sirius XM and Pandora, should be paying them similarly as the writers of the jokes, not just as the people performing the bits. </p>
<p>“This is a right that has existed for decades and decades,” he said. “Now we’re exercising it on behalf of our members.” </p>
<p>Spoken Giants is also seeking back payments on behalf of artists for their literary rights. King said the rates for comedy bits should be similar to the revenues for songwriters, which are set by the U.S. government. </p>
<p>Spotify said in a statement that it “has paid significant amounts of money for the content in question, and would love to continue to do so.” </p>
<p>King called Spotify’s takedown of comedy albums an “aggressive” tactic. Not being on Spotify is bad for comedians because they’re missing out on a giant platform and royalties as the two sides work out their differences. </p>
<p>Now comedians are getting a taste of what musicians have dealt with for years.</p>

<p>United Talent Agency is sponsoring a SPAC focused on gaming and the “creator economy,” putting the company one “metaverse” shy of a media buzzword hat trick.</p>
<a>my colleague Wendy Lee reported</a>.
<p>UTAA said it planned to acquire a company that had compelling intellectual property, potential to scale and a proven operating team.</p>
<p>UTA’s interest in gaming and e-sports isn’t new. The rising industry of famous video game influencers has become a lucrative opportunity for talent agencies looking for bankable stars. </p>
<h2>BuzzFeed is a public company</h2>
<p>Hype for <a>BuzzFeed’s debut on the public market</a> didn’t go viral among many investors.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed had raised $16 million as part of the SPAC and secured $150 million in convertible note financing. In June, the SPAC had $288 million cash in trust.</p>
<p>BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said on Friday that the company accounted for this scenario. He said raising funds through a SPAC made it easier to acquire Complex Networks for $300 million, rather than waiting on proceeds from a traditional IPO.</p>
<p>Peretti said at a meeting with staffers on Monday that the company would focus on the long term and not worry about stock price fluctuations, which he said were to be expected for companies that were first in their category to go public.</p>
<p>Last week, BuzzFeed received some pushback from 61 staffers in its BuzzFeed News division who did a 24-hour walkout. The unionized staffers voiced their concerns about wages and whether staffers would be disciplined over traffic metrics.</p>
<p>Peretti said if a reporter were to ask someone at BuzzFeed News if they had been told they had to hit traffic quotas, “I think you will find no one has had that experience.”</p>
