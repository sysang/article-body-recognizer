<p>For hooks, it was “that act of speech, of ‘talking back’, that is no mere gesture of empty words, that is the expression of our movement from object to subject – the liberated voice”.</p>
<p>She is survived by four sisters, Sarah, Valeria, Angela and Gwenda, and a brother, Kenneth.</p>

<p>I would not be a Black feminist if it were not for bell hooks. The Feminist Wire would not exist without hooks’ urging to “talk back”. I came to Black radical resistance through her.</p>
<p>She made us face our complexities, contradictions, consumptions and appropriations. May we better and always honor her work and life by daring to sit with what audiences found so compelling about her contributions, including the parts we don’t like.</p>
<h2>Stephanie Troutman (Robbins)</h2>
<p>It is hard to know the right story to tell about my legendary friend, the singular Dr bell hooks.</p>
<p>The words of bell hooks are intimate and universal at the same time. She should have been here for many years to come, and the only comfort now is that her words will be here always.</p>
<p>She was devoted to the process of us collectively working together against domination.</p>
<p>hooks made clear that men’s pain, insecurities, fears, and inability to connect with others emotionally are all connected to men’s allegiance to patriarchy. She is sort of saying, “The call is coming from inside the house!”</p>
<p>Her work has provided men who feel frustrated, insecure, lonely and emotionally stunted a blueprint for change. The question is, are we wise enough to pick it up?</p>
<p>As she said so beautifully: “Rarely, if ever, are any of us healed in isolation. Healing is an act of communion.” We are either going to heal together or continue to bleed out. Thank you, bell hooks, for always steering us through healing.</p>
<p>Growing up, and then as a young college student, I saw the world almost entirely through the lens of a heterosexual, Black American male. I was raised to give voice to issues that mostly affected Black boys and men. bell hooks changed that for me.</p>
<a>Feminism</a> helped sensitize me to the plight of Black women, and her book The Will to Change forced me to grapple with the ways in which patriarchy is self-defeating and destructive to boys and men as well as girls and women.

<p>Joan Didion inspired writers and readers for decades. Her journalism, memoirs, and cultural and political commentary made her a unique chronicler of 20th-century culture.</p>
<p>Here are 23 quotes that encapsulate her writing:</p>
<blockquote><div> <p>We tell ourselves stories in order to live. – The White Album (1979)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>Character – the willingness to accept responsibility for one’s own life – is the source from which self-respect springs. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>You have to pick the places you don’t walk away from. – A Book of Common Prayer (1977)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>The fancy that extraterrestrial life is by definition of a higher order than our own is one that soothes all children, and many writers. – The White Album (1979)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>There’s a point when you go with what you’ve got. Or you don’t go. – a The Paris Review interview (1978)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>I did not always think he was right nor did he always think I was right but we were each the person the other trusted. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>Life changes fast. Life changes in the instant. You sit down to dinner and life as you know it ends. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005), which explores grief following the death of her husband</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>I know what the fear is. The fear is not for what is lost. What is lost is already in the wall. What is lost is already behind the locked door. The fear is for what is still to be lost. – Blue Nights (2011)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>There is no real way to deal with everything we lose. — Where I Was From (2003)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>Grief turns out to be a place none of us know until we reach it. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005)</p> </div></blockquote>
<h2>On literature and writing</h2>
<blockquote><div> <p>In time of trouble, I had been trained since childhood, read, learn, work it up, go to the literature. Information was control. – The Year of Magical Thinking (2005)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>I am still committed to the idea that the ability to think for one’s self depends upon one’s mastery of the language. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968)</p> </div></blockquote>
<blockquote><div> <p>New York was no mere city. It was instead an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself. – Slouching Towards Bethlehem (1968)</p> </div></blockquote>

<p>How was your Christmas Day? All life-affirming wonder or bah, humbug? Either way, there’s still time to view Sky’s seasonal offering, The Amazing Mr Blunden.</p>
<p>Superworm(BBC One)A Christmas animation from inimitable Gruffalo-creators Julia Donaldson and Axel Schleffer. Voices are provided by Olivia Colman (narrator) and Matt Smith as Superworm.</p>
<p>Strictly Come Dancing’s Christmas special proved a ratings hit, claiming the most viewers of any programme apart from the Queen’s festive message.</p>
<p>The Strictly special, which was won by the pop star Anne-Marie, was watched by an average of 5.8 million viewers, according to overnight figures from the <a>BBC</a>.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old singer and her professional dance partner, Graziano Di Prima, were victorious after performing a thrilling cha-cha-cha, which earned them a perfect score of 40 from the judges.</p>
<p>BBC One had eight of the top 10 programmes on <a>Christmas</a> Day. ITV took eighth and ninth place with festive episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale.</p>
<p>In the Queen’s Christmas broadcast, which was about 10 minutes long, the monarch reflected on the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the continuing impact of the coronavirus pandemic. It was watched by 7.4 million viewers.</p>
<p>Third place went to Call The Midwife with 4.7 million viewers. Michael McIntyre’s Christmas Wheel secured 4.6 million and was fourth, while Blankety Blank took fifth with 4.2 million.</p>
<p>Sixth place was taken by Mary Poppins Returns, the 2018 sequel to the well-loved 1964 film, with 3.7 million viewers, while the animated production Superworm was in seventh with 3.3 million.</p>
<p>On ITV, Coronation Street secured 3.3 million viewers and Emmerdale was watched by 3 million.</p>
<p>In 10th place, the festive EastEnders special had an audience of 2.9 million. </p>
<p>The BBC One sitcom Mrs Brown’s Boys, which usually secures high audience numbers, did not feature in the top 10.</p>
<p>Charlotte Moore, the BBC’s chief content officer, said: “Viewers chose the BBC on Christmas Day and [it] entertained them in their millions, with Strictly taking the top spot.</p>
<p>“It’s these moments, in a time of intense competition, that prove that after 99 years the BBC matters more than ever.</p>
<p>“We have an ambitious and exciting year ahead in 2022 to mark our centenary year with an unmissable range of world-class content that will celebrate and reflect the unique role the BBC continues to play in the lives of audiences across the UK.”</p>
<p>Just as we enter the final days of 2021, along comes another very fine homegrown production to cap off a bumper year for Australian television.</p>

<a>the serial killer Stephen Port</a> might still be alive today were it not for a shoddy police investigation that was the result of “ineptitude, poor systems and underfunding”, the producer of a new drama about the crimes has said.
<p>Jeff Pope is senior producer of Four Lives, a dramatisation for BBC One of the murders of four young gay men: Anthony Walgate, 23; Gabriel Kovari, 22; Daniel Whitworth, 21; and Jack Taylor, 21.</p>
<p>It stars Stephen Merchant as Port and Sheridan Smith as <a>Sarah Sak</a>, the mother of Walgate, who campaigned to prove her son had been drugged, raped and murdered. The initial police finding was that the death was unexplained but not suspicious.</p>
<a>the Radio Times</a>. “The shoddy investigation was due to ineptitude, poor systems, underfunding.”
<p>Pope has been involved, as writer or producer, in some of the most watched and well-received real crime dramas of recent years, including about the serial killers Fred and Rose West.</p>
<a>police failings probably contributed</a> to three of the four deaths.
<p>Pope and the writer Neil McKay are also working on a dramatisation of Jimmy Savile’s crimes, starring Steve Coogan. They said a future project, could be the Manchester Arena bombings of 2017.</p>
<p>Television is going through a golden age but viewers are so spoilt for choice there is a danger people miss the good stuff, the actor <a>Jamie Dornan</a> has said.</p>
<p>Dornan is about to be seen on film in <a>Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast</a> and on television in BBC One’s six-part thriller The Tourist.</p>
<a>the New York Times</a> headlined “The Golden Torso”. His breakthrough came as the
<a>sexy serial killer in the BBC drama series The Fall</a>, starring alongside Gillian Anderson.
<a>strictly daytime soap</a>”. His performance in Belfast, on the other hand, has been
<a>widely praised</a>, with speculation that he may make it on to the best supporting actor Oscar shortlist. The film goes on general release next month but has already picked up
<a>five-star reviews</a> from festival screenings.

<a>a replacement for Meghan McCain</a> as a co-host of ABC’s The View ran into criticism on Monday, over their
<a>reported</a> preference for a conservative who does not support Donald Trump’s lie about electoral fraud or attempts to overturn the last election – but is not a “Never Trumper” either.
<p>One critic said the news was “scary for a lot of reasons beyond leaving The View short-staffed”.</p>
<p>That lie stoked the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January and has since driven attempts to restrict voting by Democrats and to make it easier to overturn elections.</p>
<p>Founded by the influential journalist Barbara Walters in 1997, <a>The View</a> is a talkshow with an all-woman cast that screens on ABC on weekday mornings.</p>
<p>McCain, the daughter of the late Arizona senator and Republican presidential candidate John McCain, <a>filled the slot for a conservative voice</a> for four years, alongside Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg and Sunny Hostin.</p>
<p>Last summer, <a>McCain left</a>. She later <a>claimed</a> to have endured a “toxic work environment”.</p>
<p>On Monday, Politico <a>reported</a> that Behar, Goldberg and Hostin were “upping the pressure to pick a successor, and voicing their displeasure at having to introduce new guest hosts … in a seemingly endless process that they find disruptive”.</p>
<p>Politico said Ana Navarro, a Republican operative and frequent <a>guest host</a>, was not favoured because she was too close to the other hosts – and worked for Biden in 2020.</p>
<p>“They are really looking for a unicorn,” one “former show staffer” was quoted as saying. “They want someone who is going to fight – but not too hard, because they don’t want it to be ugly and bickering.”</p>
<p>The report prompted anger online.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” <a>wrote</a> Tom Nichols, a Never Trump conservative, academic and <a>author</a>. “Why is being a Never Trumper somehow disqualifying?”</p>
<p>Max Burns, a Democratic operative, <a>wrote</a>: “It’s increasingly impossible to find a prominent Republican voice willing to say the 6 January insurrection was wrong. That’s scary for a lot of reasons beyond leaving The View short-staffed.”</p>
<a>went further</a>: “Maybe that’s a sign that if … the average Republican viewer is a
<a>fascist</a>, there’s no obligation to make sure those views continue to be broadcast to millions like we’re all just friends who disagree with each other meeting in the middle.”
<p>A bright blue anthropomorphic dog may not have been the hero that dads had asked for – but he was the one they clearly needed.</p>
<a>an online community group</a> launched in the UK by Matt Bellis, a Bluey superfan who wanted to connect with other fathers who loved Bandit – a dry-humoured doggy dad who demonstrates a playing prowess most parents can only aspire to.
<p>Bandit is particularly loved by fathers because while he is not perfect – one episode shows him trying to turn watching the cricket into a game – he captures the fun many dads have playing with their kids, said Bellis.</p>
<p>“Bandit makes you realise you need to step up your game and it helps you bond with your kids because it gives you ideas and games you hadn’t thought of before,” said Bellis, who makes steam train boilers for a living.</p>
<p>But for those promoting gender equality and equal parenting that depiction is gamechanging, said Adrienne Burgess, the joint chief executive of the Fatherhood Institute, a UK thinktank.</p>
<p>“What Bluey does differently, and what makes it revolutionary, is it shows the lived experience of dads,” she said. “Fathers are so much more engaged than they were in the day-to-day business of raising children.”</p>
<p>While mothers did more caring during Covid lockdowns, the gender care gap narrowed. In May, the <a>Office for National Statistics found</a> that the first Covid lockdown led to a 58% increase in childcare undertaken by men. </p>
<p>“I love my son to pieces, but to begin with it was difficult. I felt lost,” he said. “It can be quite lonely as a dad sometimes, so it was really important for me to have a space where we can support each other.”</p>
<p>While fathers share photos of the memories they have created with their children, they also, he admitted, just spend a fair amount of time talking about Bluey, and of course Bandit.</p>
<p>“I think as a show it is helping dads realise that they are just as important as mums,” he said. “It’s about co-parenting, isn’t it. You know, 50/50. You’re a team.”</p>

<p>Like countless other new parents, Sara had sailed straight into the ‘iceberg’ of unrealistically high expectations</p>
<ul> <li><a>The modern mind </a>is a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their work</li> </ul>
<p>When I last saw her Sara was flourishing in her pregnancy and full of excitement and anticipation about becoming a family.</p>
<p>Just getting out the door with Ava was a monumental mission and her plans for getting back to the gym and having social catch-ups with friends were just not happening. </p>
<p>To make things worse, Ava was now teething and was irritable day and night. As for getting on to the planned landscaping for the new house …</p>
<p>While she loved her baby, here she was exhausted, lonely and bored, caught up in feelings of guilt, anxiety and resentment and trying to contemplate what had happened to her.</p>
<p>Many Indigenous and collective-based cultures have processes that wrap around a new mother so she is not left isolated, exhausted and unsupported and her role in the community is cherished and valued.</p>
<p>Although things continued to be bumpy for Sara over the months I saw her, she first and foremost was able to let go of her previous unrealistically high expectations about herself and parenthood and take the pressure and self-judgement off.</p>
<p>Instead of feeling lonely, isolated and disconnected, Sara developed a practice of self-compassion, well-wishing and connection with all new parents experiencing the challenges and joys of their first baby.</p>
<p>Ditching social media gave Sara relief from the dark art of “comparisonism” .</p>
<p>She learned to live with a messy house!</p>
<p>As our time together came to an end, Sara appeared to be much more her old self.</p>
<p>Ava was a beautiful, healthy and happy baby and Sara was able to surrender her need to feel in control of everything and instead roll with the daily ups and downs that came with parenting Ava.</p>
<p>Sara was now engaging with other aspects of herself and her life, and transformed her pursuit of being a perfect parent into a much gentler and more rewarding journey of being a perfectly good enough parent.</p>
<p>* Sara is not a real client, however her case is typical of many new mothers I see in private practice</p>

<p>Most of the resources that we are devoting to Covid in hospital are now being spent on the unvaccinated.</p>

<p>The erasure of the memorial from where it had stood for nearly 25 years came as Beijing has intensified its targeting of political dissent in Hong Kong since the Covid pandemic. </p>
<a>China</a>, where it cannot be publicly marked. It had sat on the University of Hong Kong (HKU) campus since 1997, the year the city was handed back to China from Britain.
<p>In October, HKU officials <a>ordered the removal of the sculpture</a>, which features 50 anguished faces and tortured bodies piled on one another and commemorates the pro-democracy protesters killed by Chinese troops around Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>The request was condemned by rights groups, with the international law firm Mayer Brown withdrawing from representing the university on the matter. Security guards have blocked reporters from approaching and tried to stop media outlets from filming.</p>
<p>The statue will be kept in storage and the university said it would “continue to seek legal advice on any appropriate follow-up action”.</p>
<p>Before Wednesday’s removal, students and activists carried out the annual tradition of cleaning and repainting the statue to commemorate Beijing’s crackdown on protesters. For them, it had been a symbol of Hong Kong’s wider freedoms.</p>
<p>Samuel Chu, the president of the Campaign for Hong Kong, said: “Its creation in 1997 was a touchstone for freedom in Hong Kong; its destruction in 2021 would be a tombstone for freedom in Hong Kong.” </p>
<p>HKU broke ties with its student union in April and tore down its pro-democracy displays from the campus in July.</p>
<p>In the past year, scores of opposition figures have been jailed or fled abroad, as authorities stifled dissent to make the city more “patriotic”.</p>
<p>Hong Kong used to be the one place in China where mass remembrance of <a>Tiananmen </a>was tolerated. There is no official death toll from the massacre but activists believe hundreds, possibly thousands, of people were killed.</p>

<a>extreme weather disasters </a>and
<a>political discord</a>, but for one individual 2021 will be remembered for having propelled her into national prominence.
<p>In an interview, Levine told the Guardian that she was touched not only by the honour and privilege of her new roles, but also by the “profound responsibility that I take very seriously”.</p>
<p>She added that she would be looking to make an impact “both in terms of my advocacy through the LGBTQ+ community and also through the policy changes we can make across health and human services and the administration”.</p>
<p>A graduate of Harvard and Tulane Medical School, she was trained as a pediatrician and specialised in adolescent medicine at Penn State. As such she has both personal and professional skin in the game.</p>
<p>Levine said her starting point when thinking about trans youth was how at risk they are. “Transgender youth are very vulnerable,” she said. “They are vulnerable to being bullied, to discrimination and harassment.”</p>
<a>announced</a> through its civil rights office that
<a>section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act</a>, which bans discrimination on grounds of sex, would henceforth include sexual orientation and gender identity. The decision, which is being
<a>challenged</a> by religious groups, requires health providers in receipt of federal funds to offer gender transition treatment.
<p>Levine said a priority for next year would be to roll out that rule change across the nation. “We are going to work to promulgate and distribute that for health insurance throughout the US,” she said.</p>
<p>Jim Banks, a Republican congress member from Indiana, was <a>temporarily suspended</a> from Twitter in October for willfully misgendering Levine. In a <a>tweet</a>, he said: “The title of first female four-star officer gets taken by a man”.</p>
<p>How does she cope with the virulent personal attacks? She said that as a pediatrician, treating sick children, she learned how to compartmentalize.</p>
<p>“I sublimate that. I take those challenges and I throw them into my work, and it motivates me even more.”</p>
<p>The transgender debate is just a small part of Levine’s daily workload. There is no shortage of health crises piling up on her desk, not least the gathering storm of Omicron and the resultant battle to get millions of Americans boosted.</p>
<a>health inequities</a> that have been exposed by the pandemic. “Covid-19 like nothing else has shown the depth and breadth of health disparities in the United States, particularly among individuals of colour,” she said.
<a>Health</a> Service Commissioned Corps towards dealing with the health consequences of the climate crisis. As the crisis deepens, she said, the US is likely to be affected by the spread of vector-borne diseases such as those carried by mosquitoes.
<p>Already vulnerable communities are being assailed by extreme weather conditions. <a>Life-threatening heatwaves</a> have been found to disproportionately affect communities of colour.</p>
<p>Levine highlighted the plight of many agricultural workers. “Farmworkers shouldn’t have to risk their health, even risk dying, due to extreme heat just to put food on their family’s table,” she said.</p>
<p>“Minimum-wage workers shouldn’t have to decide between cooling their homes with electricity or paying for medication. Families across the country shouldn’t have to worry about safe drinking water.”</p>

<p>1. What was the question?</p>
<p>The person at the rail station’s information desk replied: “2222222”</p>
<p>Solution: “Can you tell me from when, and to when, the train will be in the station?”</p>
<p>The person at the information desk replied: “Two to 2:00, to 2:22.”</p>
<p>2. The question I ask every year – with the smallest incremental change.</p>
<p>10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 = 2022</p>
<p>Here’s one solution. Please post others below.</p>
<p>10+(((9×8×7)−6+5)×(4+3−2−1))</p>
<p>3. Three twos and a naught.</p>
<p>7. (2 + 0!)<sup>2</sup> – 2 </p>
<p>(In the original post I also said you could use the decimal point and the symbol for repeated decimal. In fact, it has subsequently been pointed out that you don’t need these operations at all. I think the solutions above are the simplest.)</p>
<p>Thanks everyone! I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzles. I’ll be back next year.</p>
<p>I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles. If you would like to suggest one, email me.</p>
<p>I’m the author of several books of puzzles, most recently the Language Lover’s Puzzle Book. I also give school talks about maths and puzzles (online and in person). If your school is interested please get in touch.</p>
<p>And now here we are, deep in a strange festive season, where party invitations are dependent on producing a negative rapid antigen test.</p>
<p>No matter how tempting it may be, Chloe Naughton, the program director for Melbourne Fashion festival, says “the worst thing you can do is take off whatever you’re wearing and leave it in a pile on the floor”.</p>
<p>Instead, she suggests hanging it, or laying it flat on a drying rack or table to air it out before putting it away. If you have a steamer, and extraordinary willpower, she suggests giving each piece a light steam first.</p>
<h2>Stop stains on the spot</h2>
<p>If some oil falls on your shirt or pants, she says it “needs to be washed out then and there, because if the oil soaks in it will stain”.</p>
<p>It may feel weird to walk around in a moist shirt, but if you want it to survive the night, Naughton suggests you “go to the bathroom straight away and use lukewarm water and hand soap” to remove the oil.</p>
<p>If a New Year’s Day run-about to find an open dry cleaner feels a bit ambitious, rethink wearing a silk jacket or chiffon dress on a night that may get rowdy.</p>
