<a>Treehouse restaurant</a> with a pot of North Shields mussels. Revived, I walk on down the road, across the Aln, and through the fields to the Lion Bridge, with views across the river to the gothic magnificence of

<p>Since the Australian government lifted the ban on fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents leaving the country without an exemption, on 1 November, interest in overseas travel has skyrocketed.</p>
<p>The only constant now is that travel rules and regulations are constantly changing.</p>
<p>There is profound uncertainty regarding how Covid variants will impact international travel moving forward. Your first point of call should always be the Australian government’s Smartraveller website, which you can subscribe to for updates.</p>
<li><p>Complete a detailed risk/benefit analysis before you book.</p></li>
<li><p>You will also need adequate contingency funding should Covid-19 conditions require you to extend your trip, possibly indefinitely.</p></li>
<li><p>Fully research and keep up to date with all the latest requirements for leaving and re-entering Australia (and each state) and entering the countries you wish to visit.</p></li>
<li><p>Read the fine print on your travel insurance closely, and be aware of which Covid conditions are covered and not covered.</p></li>
<h2>Vaccination status and PCR tests: the paperwork</h2>
<a>myGov</a> account. It will be provided in PDF format for printing, or electronic storage on your phone. Children 12 and over must be vaccinated while those under 12 travelling with vaccinated family members will be treated as vaccinated.
<p>Currently, most flights out of Australia require proof of a negative Covid-19 PCR molecular test provided by a laboratory, which is not the same as a test from a free testing clinic in Australia.</p>
<p>In general, the PCR test must be done no more than 72 hours before the scheduled departure of the first leg of your flight (or no later than 48 hours before your departure for Singapore, and one day before your departure to the United States).</p>
<p>Prices are generally around A$150, but you can do a $79 PCR test, with a result within 90 minutes before departure, at <a>Histopath Diagnostic Specialists testing centres</a> at Sydney and Melbourne international airports.</p>
<p>A negative PCR test-result certificate will still be valid if your flight is delayed longer than the 72-hour window, but if the flight is rescheduled or cancelled you’ll need to take a new test.</p>
<p>Carry several printed copies (they do not need to be notarised) of both your ICVC and negative PCR test results, since you can’t always rely on digital technology while on the road.</p>
<h2>Consider the worst-case scenario</h2>
<p>As difficult as it may be, travellers should be realistic about all the uncertainties and potential additional expenses of international travel, especially if they get stranded overseas because of lockdowns.</p>
<p>Holly Seale, an associate professor in the School of Population Health at the University of New South Wales, has spent four months documenting the experiences of Australians stranded abroad.</p>
<p>“So many people have been wanting to reconnect with family and friends overseas for two years now.</p>
<p>“It’s also really good to have a discussion with your GP before travelling,” she suggests. “People need to expand their travel health pack.”</p>
<p>Seale suggests people consider “bringing along higher-quality masks and possibly even respirators” and likens Covid booster shots to “other traditional travel regimens, including flu and other vaccines appropriate to where they are travelling”.</p>
<p>“Down the track, getting Covid shots may be considered no different than packing anti-diarrhoea tablets.”</p>
<p>Even for seasoned travellers used to making their own bookings, the services of a travel agent can be hugely helpful in reducing your research burden around shifting rules – and paperwork if things go wrong.</p>
<p>Flight Centre Travel Group has a dedicated research team providing its travel agents with up-to-date information about Covid travel requirements and restrictions.</p>
<p>“The rules are constantly changing. You can’t check things enough these days.”</p>
<a>Smartraveller</a> site is even more emphatic, stating: “If you can’t afford travel insurance, you can’t afford to travel.”
<p>Some countries, such as Fiji and Singapore, even mandate Covid travel insurance for visitors.</p>
<p><a>NIB</a> (underwritten by Pacific International Insurance Pty Ltd) introduced Covi travel benefits last month. A number of independent travel agents have started selling NIB travel insurance.</p>
<p>Travel insurance will not cover cancellations if you’re unable to travel due to lockdowns, government travel bans or border closures at home or at your planned destination.</p>
<p>Cover-More and NIB both offer unlimited Covid medical coverage overseas, in addition to a 24-hour medical assistance team to monitor care and organise repatriation, if required. They will also cover quarantine, cancellation and rebooking costs.</p>
<p>Each company’s policies approach Covid coverage in slightly different ways, so it is essential you read the fine print. Cover-More, for instance, is currently not offering Covid insurance for multi-night cruises.</p>
<p>If Smartraveller has a “Do not travel” warning when you enter a particular country, your Covid insurance will not be valid. If the “Do not travel” status is applied when you are already in the country, your Covid-cover will be available.</p>
<p>Cancellation cover is also available if you contract Covid (or are deemed a close contact of someone with Covid) after you’ve purchased travel insurance but before you are scheduled to leave on your trip.</p>
<p> Majsay advises business travellers who normally just use their company’s policy to read it carefully, as some business policies may not have added Covid cover.</p>
<p>Majsay says that for long-haul journeys, “it’s easiest if you use one airline from your departure point through to your final destination, check your baggage all the way through and get all your boarding passes up front”.</p>
<p>Liam Hawkes from Flight Centre says: “If clients are unsure, I’m recommending the fewer countries in your itinerary, the better, to make travel as easy as possible.</p>
<p>“Most people are not asking about stopovers, because they want to get to their destination and then get home. They’re not looking for a three-day, lay-in-the-sun break.”</p>
<p>Spending time in the country you transit through is “of course, possible” Hawkes says. “But they add extra testing requirements and isolation while you wait for results.”</p>
<p>Given the appearance of the new Omicron variant, arrival regulations around the world are changing daily and you must be vigilant about checking for updates.</p>
<a>updated its testing policies</a> on 2 December (US time), shortening the time-frame for pre-departure PCR tests to one day. The
<a>UK</a> now requires travellers to self-isolate on arrival, pre-book a PCR test within two days of arrival and continue to isolate until getting a negative result.
<a>Singapore</a> has added a requirement of rapid antigen Covid tests on days three and seven.
<p>If you intend to visit multiple countries, you will need to grapple with multiple sets of rules that can change unpredictably, adding extra risk.</p>
<p>“Keeping to one part of the world or one country for the time being is going to be the safest way to travel,” says Hawkes.</p>
<p>If you or a member of your travelling group tests positive for Covid-19, you won’t be allowed to travel to Australia and will have to self-isolate until all members of your party test negative.</p>
<p>The federal government manages Australia’s international borders. However, state and territory governments regulate quarantine (and other inbound health-related requirements).</p>
<a>Victoria</a> updated re-entry rules with new isolation and testing requirements for anyone who arrived on or after 28 November, in response to the Omicron variant.
<p>No other state is accepting international arrivals except those that have applied for travel exemptions (capped nationally at 200 people a week), where 14-day hotel quarantine is required.</p>
<p>It was those two 15-minute orchestrated pieces heard perhaps millions of times by travellers boarding and disembarking Australia’s national carrier. It was a surprise. Too little sleep, I wondered, or the ghost of travel past?</p>
<a>Song Zu’s Spotlight</a> podcast.
<a>tweeted</a> that a “lack lustre curation of music focused audio/video could be the cause” of flyers’ disinterest. He also urged the carrier to take “Aussie music to the world”.
<p>While airlines like Qantas employ the talents of composers like Walker, there are those who scour the existing canon of modern music to stitch together soundscapes with, say, hotel design.</p>

<p>More than £1bn-worth of UK state pensions has been underpaid due to repeated human errors that were almost inevitable amid complex rules and outdated IT systems, a spending watchdog has said.</p>
<p>The Department for Work and <a>Pensions</a> (DWP) estimates it underpaid 134,000 pensioners, and those it can trace will be paid an average of £8,900, the National Audit Office (NAO) said.</p>
<p>Most of those affected are likely to be women and the true value of the underpayments will only become clear once the DWP has completed its review of all cases, the watchdog added.</p>
<p>“DWP must provide urgent redress to those affected and take real action to prevent similar errors in future.”</p>
<p>The errors affect pensioners who first claimed state pension before April 2016, do not have a full NI record, and should have received certain increases in their basic state pension.</p>
<p>They were brought to the department’s attention by individual pensioners, concerned experts and the media, the NAO said.</p>
<p>Errors happened because state pension rules were complex, IT systems outdated and not automated, and the administration of claims required a high degree of manual review and understanding by case workers, the NAO said.</p>
<p>Caseworkers often failed to set and later action manual IT system prompts on pensioners’ files to review payments at a later date, such as for when people reached state pension age or their 80th birthday, it said.</p>
<p>Frontline staff found instructions difficult to use and lacked training on complex cases, according to the findings.</p>
<p>Quality assurance processes focused on checking changes to case details, such as a change of address or the death of a spouse, rather than the overall accuracy of the payments, the NAO continued.</p>
<p>The department is prioritising individuals who fall into “at-risk” categories, such as those who are widowed or over 80.</p>
<p>As at August 2021, the department had not approved a formal plan to trace the estates of deceased pensioners.</p>
<p>Webb, who is a partner at consultancy LCP (Lane Clark Peacock), said the DWP needed to explain how these errors were allowed to go on for so long and what lessons had been learned. </p>

<p>The pension underpayment scandal could be the tip of the iceberg affecting many thousands more people, according to the former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb, who has led the campaign to raise awareness on the issue.</p>
<a>has been underpaid</a> due to repeated human errors that were almost inevitable amid complex rules and outdated IT systems, a spending watchdog has said.
<a>rules are complex</a>, IT systems are outdated and unautomated, and the administration of claims requires a high degree of manual review and understanding by case workers.
<p>“Tax credits are a particular risk because no citizen understands them, and so can’t challenge them, because they’re based on past earning figures and other stuff which no layperson can really understand.</p>
<p>Almost 6 million people in the UK receive universal credit, also administered by the DWP, while another 3.11 million are on tax credits, administered by HM Revenue and Customs. </p>
<p>A DWP spokesperson said Webb’s claims are unfounded. “Universal credit is a digital system that is far less complex than the legacy benefits system.</p>
<p>“There is absolutely no evidence to point to widespread universal credit payment issues,” the spokesperson added. The HMRC was also contacted for comment.</p>
<p>Meg Hillier, the chair of the public accounts committee, said: “Many pensioners – most of whom are likely to be women – have been short-changed by thousands of pounds, which they are still yet to receive many years later.”</p>
<h2>‘Money is terribly important in old age’</h2>
<p>The money was promptly paid in a lump sum and Temple’s monthly pension payment more than doubled but “there was not a single word of apology for 20 years of being grossly underpaid”.</p>
<p>“When I left the university, I went to see a local auditor because my pension seemed so low,” she said. “I particularly wanted to query it because my sister, who had never worked, was getting a bigger pension than me.”</p>
<p>The auditor, however, told Temple she was receiving the correct amount: “I didn’t take it any further,” she said. “I assumed he knew what he was talking about.”</p>
<p>“Money is terribly important in old age,” she added. “It’s disgraceful that things that are so important to people, are not important at all to those in power, with the power to change things.” </p>
<p><a>Uber</a> is to pay out millions of pounds in missed pension payments to UK drivers dating back as far as 2017 under a deal with the retirement savings watchdog.</p>
<a> supreme court ruling</a> over their employment status. Couriers for the group’s UberEats food delivery service are not included in the deal.
<a>Uber</a> said its private hire drivers would now be auto-enrolled on to a scheme through which it would contribute 3% of earnings into a pension pot. Drivers can choose to contribute up to 5% of qualifying earnings but will be able to opt out.
<p>Drivers will also receive back payments dating back to 1 May 2017 or the date of their first trip if they joined more recently.</p>
<p>Uber, whose scheme is provided by NOW: <a>Pensions</a> and managed by Adecco, called on rival operators to help create a cross-industry scheme so that drivers who worked across several apps would always benefit.</p>
<p>In May, the UK’s pension regulator said it was working closely with Uber on its scheme and called on all gig economy companies to recognise the employment rights of those who work for them and set up workplace pensions.</p>

<p>One of KPMG’s senior partners lied in an investigation into the scandal over the bed company Silentnight’s insolvency, according to an unprecedented rebuke of a big four accountant from the regulator.</p>
<p>The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said KPMG and David Costley-Wood, a partner at the firm, used an “untruthful defence” in an investigation into the <a>sale of Silentnight</a> to a private equity firm in 2011.</p>
<a>£13m fine for KPMG announced in August</a>. Costley-Wood, who was formerly head of KPMG’s Manchester restructuring division, was also fined £500,000 and barred from insolvency or accountancy licences for 13 years.
<p>The case has <a>raised serious questions</a> over KPMG’s handling of conflicts of interest, as well as its lack of cooperation with investigators into the affair in the decade since.</p>
<p>On another occasion KPMG failed to hand over relevant documents because an employee typed “Costly” rather than Costley-Wood in a search. Costley-Wood was also found to have backdated notes of a meeting.</p>
<p>HIG retained close links with KPMG’s restructuring division, despite the scandal. In March 2021 HIG bought the division from KPMG, spinning it out into a new business called Interpath Advisory.</p>
<p>Costley-Wood left KPMG and the accountancy profession in June before the FRC announced the fine, according to earlier reports and a social media profile. He was approached for comment.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Interpath said: “Now that we are no longer part of KPMG and as such, have not been involved in these proceedings, we cannot comment.” HIG was approached for comment.</p>
<p>Up and down the country retirees are reporting that the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has failed to process their state pension and to start making their much-needed payments.</p>
<p>The charity Age UK warned that claimants face delays of several months – delays, it says, that have left many of those affected in “dire financial straits”. </p>
<p>Most of those facing waits are new claimants aged 66 but the problem has also affected older people who had deferred their pension, perhaps because they carried on working past retirement age.</p>
<p>“DWP stopped my mother’s employment and support allowance right on time yet failed to pay the pension she was due,” Regan says.</p>
<p>“What really annoys me is the fact that I was promised a response back that never happened. They only finally started making the payments after I threatened legal action.”</p>
<p>“I had no choice but to be almost militant about it, that seems to be the only way to get the DWP to listen. In the end we threatened legal action, and even then it was paid after the 48-hour deadline.”</p>
<p>In Eastbourne, James is equally frustrated and has contacted her MP for help.</p>
<a>underpaid 200,000 women an average of £13,500</a>. Some who wrongly received as little as 86p a week were owed in excess of £40,000 in back payments.
<p>“It took weeks for them to send him a form,” a family member wrote.</p>
<p>Caroline Abrahams, the charity director of Age UK, says the situation has become “totally unacceptable”.</p>
<p>She says: “We are hearing from lots of older people whose state pension should have come through but who are still waiting, leaving those with little behind them in dire financial straits.</p>
<p>“Like the cut to the £20 universal credit uplift, delays in payment of state pension leave people in financial hardship,” she says.</p>
<p>The DWP conceded last month that the pandemic and staffing problems had caused backlogs in payments, with the pensions minister, Guy Opperman, telling parliament: “Normal service will be resumed by the end of October 2021.”</p>
<p>A DWP spokesperson told Guardian Money: “We are sorry that some new state pension customers have faced delays receiving payment.</p>
<p>“All those affected have been identified and we have deployed extra resources to process these as a priority. Any claims made today should not be subject to delay.”</p>
<p>David Sinclair, the director of the International Longevity Centre thinktank, says 2021 has not been a good year for the DWP.</p>
<p>“In July the <a>Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman</a> said that the DWP had failed since 1995 to provide ‘accurate, adequate and timely information about changes to the state pension age for women’.</p>
<p>Stephen Timms, the chair of the work and pensions select committee, says the DWP has serious questions to answer.</p>
<p>“It is not yet clear how many people have been affected,” he says. “The government says it is only a small number but there is growing evidence that significant numbers of people may have been affected. Many of them will risk hardship as a result.”</p>

<p>Female teachers are typically retiring on much smaller pensions than their male counterparts, research has found, with part-time working one of the biggest factors eroding women’s retirement incomes.</p>
<p>Analysis of payouts from the teachers’ pension scheme (TPS) suggests that the average pension for a female former teacher is 28% less a year than a man in the same position.</p>
<p>Women received an average of £11,581 in the 2020-21 financial year, while men got £16,034, according to the financial firm Wesleyan.</p>
<p>It based the figures on analysis of the scheme’s accounts, using the total pension payments and the number of people being paid to come up with a figure for the average annual payment.</p>
<p>Among female teachers there will be those who do draw much bigger pensions from the scheme, and those who earn much less.</p>
<p>The gender gap is lower than in the pensions market generally – in the summer, Legal General said <a>women were receiving 56% less than men</a> from their retirement funds.</p>
<p>However, it underlines how career breaks, part-time working and spending time in lower-paid roles have a lasting impact on people’s incomes.</p>
<p>Lee Quinn, an adviser at Wesleyan who speaks to teachers about their retirement planning, says the headline figures reflect what he sees.</p>
<p>“You find that a lot of teachers are married to other teachers, so you almost have a direct comparison – you’ve got two people who have gone through a similar journey through life together,” he says.</p>
<p>Quinn says the scheme is not discriminatory, and the difference is almost entirely down to female teachers building up fewer qualifying days during unpaid periods of maternity leave or while working part-time.</p>
<p>Teachers who take maternity leave beyond the 39 weeks that is paid, for example, will not accrue any pension for the period they are unsalaried.</p>
<p>During her two decades in teaching, Foster has had three children but each time took only the basic maternity leave and returned to work straight afterwards. It was only after having her third child that she went back part-time.</p>
<p>“There was a change in the TPS around 2015 – if you weren’t a high earner by then and had not accrued much, you can see that your pension will not be as good.”</p>
<p>She believes women are often put off the higher-paid jobs in the profession because “they tend to look at a job description and see what they can’t do, not what they can do”.</p>
<p>She adds: “I’m lucky because I’m quite resourceful – I’m setting up an Airbnb business to bolster my income, and doing some advisory work.”</p>
<h2>Netflix and bills: calculating the cash needed in retirement</h2>
<p>Extra cash for eating out and a Netflix subscription have been added to an index designed to show how much money people will need to live on when they retire.</p>
<p>The latest figures from the <a>Pensions</a> and Lifetime Savings Association are based on a new list of expected purchases that reflect the UK’s changing pending habits.</p>
<p>The association says that for a minimum retirement living standard, a single person needs a pension of £10,900 a year – £700 more than when the calculations were done two years ago. A couple will need £16,700, it says, a rise of £1,000.</p>
<p>These figures include necessities, plus some social and cultural spending, including a week’s holiday in the UK, a TV subscription and money to eat out about once a month. They do not include cash to run a car.</p>
<p>The moderate retirement living standard figures add a two-week holiday in Europe and some other spending. For a single person the annual pension needed is £20,800, while a couple needs £30,600 coming in.</p>
<p>For a comfortable retirement, where retirees enjoy some luxuries such as beauty treatment and three weeks’ holiday in Europe a year, the association said one person would need an income of £33,600, while a couple would require £49,700.</p>
<p>It added that one in six employees were on track to have an income somewhere between the sums needed for a moderate retirement and a comfortable one.</p>

<p>It is down to the fact that the UK state pension is payable overseas but is not uprated annually unless there is a legal requirement to do so – for example, where there is a relevant reciprocal social security agreement in place.</p>
<p>If you move to an EU country, the US or one of a disparate list of countries including Israel, Mauritius and the Philippines, your state pension increases in line with inflation.</p>
<p>Ministers have <a>previously conceded the rules are “illogical”</a> but they have argued it would be too expensive to uprate those affected, and that the priority should be targeting money at the poorest pensioners at home.</p>
<p>Research by End Frozen <a>Pensions</a> found that half of frozen pensioners feel financially insecure in their retirement, a quarter rely on family members for financial support, and a third have had to take on extra work to supplement their income.</p>

<p>The letter has been coordinated by the Labour MP for Coventry South, Zarah Sultana as part of the long-running Divest Parliament campaign, which claims the backing of more than 360 current and former MPs.</p>
<p>Another signatory, David Warburton, the Tory MP for Somerton and Frome, said Cop26 had put the UK “at the centre of international diplomacy and coalition-building in a pivotal moment for climate action”.</p>

<p>A ex-midwife is urging other former <a>NHS</a> workers to check they are not being underpaid in retirement after securing a five-fold increase in her pension, plus a £19,000 lump sum payment.</p>
<p>Luci Rozanski received the extra cash after a long battle with the NHS pension scheme, which is one of Britain’s biggest, with 1.7 million active members.</p>
<p>She and her husband, Nick, say the scheme had apparently “lost” 10 years of her pension records. They claim it is possible there could be many health service workers who have been “cheated” out of money they are due.</p>
<p>The former pensions minister Steve Webb, now a partner at actuaries LCP, told Guardian Money he strongly suspects Rozanski is “far from being alone” in losing out to the apparent error.</p>
<p>She also received the lump sum, plus more than £8,000 in underpaid monthly pension payments.</p>
<p>Rozanski worked for the NHS as a full-time nurse and midwife from 1978 to 1993, and was based at several hospitals in London that over the years have moved between different health authorities.</p>
<a>Pensions</a>, the organisation that administers the scheme. It replied that its staff had carried out “a thorough search” of its records but there was no record of contributions being paid to the NHS scheme during the period in question.
<p>Undaunted, Rozanski wrote back, enclosing more documents to back up her case and asking the organisation to “pay me the pension I am due”. It sent back a letter that was almost identical to the first.</p>
<p>Rozanski, who lives in north London, says the volte-face followed “18 months of increasingly bizarre and frustrating correspondence”.</p>
<p>Webb says he is “not stunned” to hear about Rozanski’s experience.</p>
<p>With people moving around within the NHS and changes to the running of hospitals leading to staff records being sent to new places, “you can see how it happens”, he says.</p>
<p>His advice to individuals when it comes to pension entitlements and paperwork is: “If it doesn’t look right, don’t just assume they must have got it right.”</p>
<p>His other tip is to keep all paperwork, such as payslips, even long after you think you might need it, just in case there is a problem later.</p>
<p>“Just stick them in a drawer – payslips, pension letters and so on. Don’t throw them away. You never know when they might come in useful.”</p>
<p>Ministers have pushed through an amendment to England’s social care plans, which is set to disproportionately hit poorer pensioners, despite a sizeable rebellion from backbenchers.</p>
<p>The change means that council contributions to care fees would not go towards <a>the cap</a>, which means poorer people who get means-tested help would end up paying the same as richer people if they needed care for a significant amount of time.</p>
<a>sell their homes</a> to fund care, analysts have said. The vote passed by 272 to 246, a majority of 26. There were 19 rebels for the Conservatives and 70 abstentions, of which only 13 were paired according to Labour.
<p>Rebels included a number of Tories in northern seats likely to be hit hard by the changes, including 2019 intake MPs Christian Wakeford in Bury South, Holly Munby-Croft in Scunthorpe and Mark Jenkinson in Worthington.</p>
<p>Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said Tory MPs had “voted to break their promise that nobody would have to sell their homes to pay for their social care costs and voted to hammer poorer pensioners to protect millionaires in mansions”.</p>
<p>She tweeted: “It’s an inheritance tax on the north and a con, not a social care plan.”</p>
<p>Argar said, to roars of disapproval from the Labour benches, that “no one will lose from these reforms compared to the system we have now, and the overwhelming majority will win”.</p>
<p>The chair of the Treasury select committee said he had “real concerns” about the way the change had been made and said no geographical assessments had been made.</p>
<p>As anger mounted in Westminster, Downing Street and the business minister Paul Scully repeatedly refused to guarantee that no one will need to sell their home in order to pay for care.</p>
<p>“The social care solution is all about getting a cap above which you do not need to pay – that gives people certainty,” Scully told Sky News.</p>
<a>Hunt said</a> it was a “slightly more stingy cap” than had been hoped for, but that it was “a step in the right direction”.

<a>Northern Ireland</a> starting on Wednesday, in the latest round of an increasingly bitter dispute in which university leaders have accused leftwingers within the University and College Union (UCU) of blocking progress over a possible deal.
<p>Fifty-eight universities will be affected where staff backed a ballot on <a>strike action called by the UCU</a>, halting lectures and tuition at the country’s largest universities, including the Open University and University College London.</p>
<a>Universities</a> UK (UUK) – which represents the employers in the pensions talks – argued that the strike was supported by only a minority of staff, and that the UCU’s leadership was being attacked by leftwingers.
<p>“With such divisions in UCU’s decision-making bodies, it is difficult to see how a negotiated settlement over USS could ever be possible,” UUK said in its statement.</p>
<p>In response, a UCU spokesperson said: “It is beyond disappointing that just as 50,000 university staff are set to walk out on strike UUK has decided to spend its time targeting individual UCU members.</p>
<p>But vice-chancellors are showing no signs of compromising, with some angry at the union’s actions and the failure of negotiations. “I don’t care if it’s bloody, as long as the blood spills within the union,” said one vice-chancellor.</p>
<p>“It is beyond a disgrace that senior managers in our universities have been attempting to persuade staff from acting to stop cuts to their retirement with information that is wrong and which emanated right from the top of UUK.”</p>
<p>UCU also said re-balloting on strike action would take place at 42 universities where the ballot failed by only narrow margins, and that strikes would continue into the new year.</p>
<p>While most of the universities involved voted to strike on both the pensions and pay ballots, others only meet the conditions on the pay ballot, while a handful including Imperial College London are striking solely over pensions.</p>
<p>University leaders and ministers have said the strike will bring further disruption to students who have missed months of in-person teaching and the use of facilities such as libraries because of the closure of campuses during the pandemic.</p>

<p>British households built up their savings to the second highest level on record at the start of the year as the Covid-19 lockdown limited opportunities to spend, according to official figures.</p>
<a>Office for National Statistics</a> said household savings rose sharply in the three months to the end of March as the third national lockdown constrained spending.
<p>The previous record of 25.9% was set in the second quarter of 2020 during the first Covid lockdown as the British economy plunged into recession.</p>
<p>Paul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital <a>Economics</a>, said the higher ratio suggested households had accumulated about £190bn in additional savings during lockdowns.</p>
<a>question the rate</a> at which households will run down their savings amid continuing risks posed by the pandemic and as some restrictions are kept in place.
<p>Suren Thiru, the head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said the business lobby group expected the strongest growth in spending since 1988 as the vaccine rollout continues and restrictions are relaxed.</p>
<a>highest 40% of earners in the UK and retirees</a> that have saved most, while the poorest 20% have suffered a decline in savings.
<p>The ONS also said Britain’s economy suffered a bigger hit than first thought at the start of the year, with GDP falling by 1.6% in the first quarter, compared with a previous estimate of 1.5%.</p>
<p>The answer to your first question is less clear cut. If you are buying the first property jointly with a joint mortgage, you won’t still be a first-time buyer when you come to buy the second property.</p>
<p>On average, women earn about 16% less than men, according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics.</p>
<p>Time taken out of work to raise a family can also result in broken national insurance records, and years without putting any money into savings at all.</p>
<p>The research, based on data from 4 million LG pension scheme members, found that the typical gender pension gap is 17% at the beginning of women’s careers and increases to 56% at retirement compared with men.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the average LG pension pot for a woman at retirement (£10,000) was found to be less than half that of a man (£21,000).</p>
<p>However, some women are bucking the trend. Here, we speak to women at different life stages who are determined to boost their pension savings in the run-up to, and into, retirement.</p>
<h2>Sandra Wrench, 70 – delaying the state pension</h2>
<p>Sandra Wrench, from Bedford, doubled her state pension by delaying taking it for seven and a half years, and also paying for some additional pension.</p>
<p>Since May, she has received about £16,000 a year in state pension, in addition to the £11,000 final salary pension she receives from employment.</p>
<p>As Sandra reached the state pension age before 6 April 2016, she was able to increase her entitlement by 1% for every five weeks she postponed starting to take it, under the old system.</p>
<p>By combining delaying her state pension payment with the additional amount, she doubled its value from about £151 a week to £310 a week.</p>
<p>“Women shouldn’t leave checking their state pension until the last minute,” she stresses. “It’s easier to correct any errors sooner rather than later, and there are still ways to increase the amount you get.”</p>
<h2>Kathy Honeyball, 54 – maximising her company pension</h2>
<p>Kathy is doing whatever she can to boost her pension, with dreams of retiring early.</p>
<p>The divorcee lives in Sheffield and has two sons, aged 26 and 23.</p>
<p>“I think it’s important to be in control of your future,” she says. “I’ve got a partner but we’re not married and I’ve always been financially independent.”</p>
<p>By using an online retirement calculator, Kathy has worked out that her pension savings could provide an income of about £24,000 a year from the age of 60, depending on the investment growth.</p>
<h2>Jess Keplinger, 38 – getting a head start</h2>
<p>Jess knows that taking time out of work to raise her son will have seriously effects on her pension pot.</p>
<p>“But I’m lucky, because I learned the value of saving from my parents, and I’ve built up some retirement savings,” she says.</p>
<p>She was working in events management but since having her son, who is almost three, she has struggled to find a job that was sufficiently flexible to cope with nursery pickups.</p>
<p>“It’s a situation so many mums find themselves in,” says Jess, from West Hampstead in north-west London. “I’m not able to pay into a pension at the moment but I’m working hard juggling a lot at home.”</p>
<p>Her husband works in finance, and as the lower earner, she took a career break to raise their son. She is now retraining as a self-employed naturopathic health coach.</p>
<p>Jess has about £100,000 in a self-invested personal pension (Sipp) with Interactive Investor, after consolidating four pensions from previous employment.</p>
<p>“My dad set up a Sipp and Isa for me when I was little, so I had a head start, too,” she says.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why women aren’t told at school about the value of a pension. They often bear the brunt of a massive savings gap in their 30s.”</p>
<p>Jess manages her pension herself, investing in a range of shares and funds within her Sipp.</p>
<p>“If I went back into full-time employment, I’d see a pension as one of the biggest benefits,” she adds. “When I can, I’ll start paying in again.”</p>
<h2>Taking charge of your retirement</h2>
<h2>Check your national insurance contribution (NIC) record</h2>
<a>national insurance credits</a> you have received; if gaps in contributions or credits mean some years do not count towards your state pension (that is, they are not qualifying years); and if you can pay
<p>If you find there are gaps, check the government website for things such as <a>who is eligible</a> to pay <a>class 2</a> or <a>class 3</a> contributions and how it all works.</p>
<p>The rates for the 2021-22 tax year are £3.05 a week (£158.60 for a year) for class 2, and £15.40 a week (£800.80 for a year) for class 3.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you are claiming child benefit for a child aged up to 12, or a carer’s allowance for an adult, you are entitled to NI credits, which contribute towards your state pension entitlement.</p>

<a>which works out at just under 5.8% for a year</a>. So if you are entitled to £179.60 a week, by deferring for 52 weeks you will get an extra £10.42 a week. (The above applies to those reaching state pension age after 6 April 2016).

<p>More than £200bn has been put into cash savings accounts since the Covid-19 lockdowns began in March 2020, according to the latest Bank of England data, which goes up to 30 June.</p>
<a>increased in June to 2.5%</a>, and many economists predict it will
<a>head above 3% in the autumn</a>. If you want your savings to keep pace, you will struggle. National Savings and Investments used to offer
<a>index-linked savings certificates</a>, which guaranteed that your investment would grow in spending power each year, whatever happened to the cost of living, but they have not been on sale since 2011 (existing holders can renew them).
<p>Against that backdrop, it may not seem worth putting money aside but there are some accounts offering better rates than the crowd.</p>
<h2>Put some money away each month</h2>
<p>Some of the best interest rates are offered by regular savings accounts, where you put aside money each month. Some of these accounts also give you the chance to win cash prizes.</p>
<p>The account requires a minimum balance of £1 and the maximum you can hold in it is only £600. You have to deposit between £1 and £50 per calendar month, and withdrawals are limited to one a month.</p>
<p>Nationwide has a regular savings account called Start to Save, which is designed to encourage people to build up a nest egg and gives them the chance to win prizes of £100 each by saving regularly. </p>
<p>July’s draw had a prize pot of £275,600, with 2,756 savers winning cash. The next prize draw takes place on 21 October, and the society is adding an extra one, on 24 January 2022, which is currently scheduled to be the final one.</p>
<p>The interest rates on children’s accounts are often much better than those on adult accounts.</p>
<p>HSBC has the instant access MySavings account, which pays 2.5% on balances of up to £3,000 (and 0.25% above that). Anyone aged seven to 17 can open one, although if you are under 16 you will need a parent or guardian with you.</p>
<h2>Fix your rate for a better return</h2>
<p>Some of the best interest rates are offered by fixed-rate savings accounts, where you typically have to tie up your money for a year or more.</p>
<p>These deals can tend to come and go quite quickly, so keep a close eye on Moneyfacts’s tables to see who is offering what.</p>
<p>The top-paying one-year fixed rate bonds are offering a little over 1%. For example, Tandem Bank is paying 1.07%.</p>
<h2>Make use of government top-ups</h2>
<p>Rubbish interest rates are less important if you are getting hundreds – or even thousands – of pounds of free cash from the government.</p>

<h2>8) Check subscriptions, direct debits and standing orders</h2>
<p>If you genuinely did cancel and the overpayments are the company’s fault, the direct debit guarantee can be used, and there is no time limit. Beware recurring bank card payments so beloved of firms that take annual subscription payments. </p>
<h2>9) Switch one of your savings accounts to a better rate</h2>
<p>Savings rates at the moment are pretty terrible, and if you take a look at the interest rate on your bank-account-linked savings account, you may well find you are getting a paltry 0.01%.</p>
<p>If you prefer an easy access account, you can currently get 0.65%, again with Tandem, or you can earn between<a> 0.86% and 1%</a> with a notice account.</p>

<p>Few of us probably know exactly where the money in our workplace pension or personal pension is invested. </p>
<p>If you are in a company scheme, your pension contributions will be going into an underlying fund. Log into your employer’s intranet or go online and it shouldn’t be hard to find the most recent fund factsheet or investment report for your fund.</p>
