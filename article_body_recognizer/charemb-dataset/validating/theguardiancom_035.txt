<h2>Vaccine rollout: Indigenous vaccination statistics</h2>
<p>Here, you can see national figures for the Indigenous vaccination rate over time compared with the overall vaccination rate, and the difference between the two:</p>
<h2>Vaccine rollout: vaccine production and distribution</h2>
<p>The US emerged as an early hotspot for the coronavirus and it continues to have some of the highest case and death rates in the world. It leads the world in both confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>It’s important to point out that the actual death toll is believed to be far higher than the tally compiled from government figures.</p>
<p>Map numbers shown below are from <a>Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p>
<p>Table values shown below are from <a>Johns Hopkins University</a>.</p>
<p>Coronavirus has hit the UK hard, with the country recording more than 10m cases and 140,000 deaths linked to the disease.</p>
<p>The government figures below include confirmed cases only – some people who have the disease are not tested.</p>
<h2>Where are the UK’s current coronavirus hotspots?</h2>
<p>At the start of the pandemic, London bore the brunt of coronavirus’s impact before the centre of the virus shifted northwards. More recently, hotspots have now developed again across the country, with London being hit earliest by the Omicron wave.</p>
<p>Everyday life in the UK has been subject to varying degrees of restriction since March 2020, although national restrictions were relaxed in all four nations of the UK over the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>Details of the <a>English guidance are listed here</a>, <a>Scottish guidance here</a>, <a>Welsh guidance here</a> and <a>Northern Irish here</a>.</p>
<h2>How is the disease progressing in the UK?</h2>
<h2>How does the third wave compare to the second wave?</h2>
<h2>How is the vaccine rollout progressing?</h2>
<p>By looking at vaccine take-up in the days since it became available to each age cohort, we can see that for younger age groups, take-up tends to be slower.</p>
<h2>How are case rates changing?</h2>
<p>Lockdown had brought down case rates for everyone. But different age groups have been affected differently. Throughout the pandemic working-age people between 20 and 60 have had the highest levels of infection.</p>
<h2>Find coronavirus cases near you</h2>
<p>In the table below, you can find out the number of cases per 100,000 in your area, both for the last week and since the start of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Differences in data collection and publishing schedules may lead to temporary inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Covid-19 has spread around the planet, sending billions into lockdown. Find out where the virus has spread, and where it is now most deadly</p>
<p>Since first being recorded in late 2019 in China, the Covid-19 coronavirus has spread around the world, and been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Dozens of countries have recorded over 10,000 deaths, while case counts are now in the millions in many countries. However, differences in testing mean the number of cases may be understated for some countries.</p>
<h2>How is the disease progressing around the world?</h2>
<a>advanced vaccination campaigns</a>, have managed to avoid some of the worst peaks recorded around the world.
<p>Case rates – the daily cases per million people in any country – show how many European countries faced new highs in infection during last winter.</p>
<p>The disease has caused tens or hundreds of thousands of deaths in many countries, hitting the US, Brazil, India, Mexico and Russia with particular cruelty in terms of total deaths.</p>
<p>And while most countries experienced the first wave of infections in a similar fashion, albeit at different times, new variants are – for now – changing the way different areas are suffering from further waves.</p>
<h2>Is the world rolling out the vaccine fast enough?</h2>
<p>In December 2020, a number of countries began to approve vaccines and begin vaccination programmes.</p>
<p>Many countries rolled out their vaccine programmes in early 2021, but concerns have been raised over the availability of vaccines in developing nations.</p>

<p>The UK government’s chief scientific adviser has hit back at accusations from Conservative MPs that epidemiological modellers had “spread gloom” about the <a>Omicron variant</a>.</p>
<p>Sir <a>Patrick Vallance</a> said it was not the responsibility of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) “to take a particular policy stance or to either spread gloom or give Panglossian optimism”.</p>
<p>He used an <a>article in the Times</a> to respond to criticism that was widely circulated among Tory MPs and ministers that suggested Sage’s Omicron modelling had been an exercise in fear-mongering.</p>

<p>In an apparent riposte, Vallance wrote science was “self-correcting” and about making “advances by overturning previous dogma and challenging accepted truths”.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson can “get away with things that mere mortals can’t seem to”, the former prime minister <a>David Cameron</a> has said, while suggesting there has been an “arms race” between politicians and the media to outwit one another.</p>
<p>Johnson’s team have significantly changed relationships with the media – <a>hiring personal photographers</a> on to the No 10 staff who often snap key events instead of photographers from media organisations.</p>
<p>Johnson has also used taped clips to make announcements – including most recently the announcement of <a>no new restrictions before Christmas</a> – instead of appearing at a press conference or in front of MPs.</p>
<p>In an interview with Adam Boulton for Feral Beasts, a documentary exploring Britain and the media, Cameron said the relationship had become more adversarial.</p>
<p>“I think there has been a bit of an arms race in a way,” Cameron said. “Politicians have tooled up with special advisers and the spin doctors, and the media have tooled up by even more aggressive ‘gotcha’ interviews to get that magic moment.</p>
<p>Cameron had also made a request for a personal official photographer, which was declined, which prompted him to say Johnson could get away with more than others.</p>
<p>“I mean, we were always available and keen to engage and to answer questions.”</p>
<p>Johnson had promised a more open relationship with the press with plans for televised media briefings from a £2m refurbished media suite and hired Allegra Stratton as an official spokesperson to front them.</p>

<a>WhatsApp messages that emerged</a> during an Electoral Commission inquiry into the funding showed that Johnson had been in direct contact with Brownlow in November 2020.
<p>Downing Street has said Johnson only knew Brownlow was handling the donations, rather than funding them.</p>
<p>Pressure is piling on Geidt from opposition parties and campaigners to make a call on whether to censure Johnson – or resign if there are grounds to believe he was misled.</p>
<p>Stone, who looks into standards breaches by MPs, has not yet made a call on whether to investigate Johnson. Stone said she would not investigate until the Electoral Commission had finalised its inquiries, but has now been urged by MPs to do so.</p>

<a>Boris Johnson</a> have been warned by Tory colleagues that they will damage their chances unless they stridently oppose further Covid measures in England, as MPs called for New Year’s Eve restrictions to be ruled out.

<p>New coronavirus restrictions <a>are being introduced </a>by the devolved governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, including new physical distancing rules, the closure of nightc lubs and limits on indoor gatherings.</p>
<p>The UK recorded 122,186 new Covid cases on Friday, the highest yet, while the Office for National Statistics estimated that 1.7 million Britons had the virus in the week ending 19 December, also a record.</p>
<p>Other Tory MPs also said they would consider a candidate’s position on restrictions in any leadership race.</p>

<p>Helen Morgan said the Liberal Democrats’ win, which overturned a Conservative majority of nearly 23,000, was no fluke and that her party is capable of winning over more voters than people expect.</p>
<p>Speaking during her first few days in the new job, Morgan said her election builds on the party’s success in the Chesham and Amersham byelection in June, where they also took a former Tory safe seat in a shock result.</p>
<p>“We’ve won two big byelections in just over six months. We’ve now proved the Chesham and Amersham result wasn’t a fluke,” she said.</p>
<p>“Everyone said that was about HS2, but in North Shropshire it was about issues that affect everyone in the country. I think it proves we can make a difference across a much wider area than people thought we might be able to.”</p>
<p>She said the Lib Dems, who campaigned strongly against Brexit, have proved their popularity is no longer confined to parts of the country which voted Remain – Shropshire voted to leave the EU by 56.9%.</p>
<a>cheese and wine parties</a> after work,” Morgan said.
<p>Revelations in the Guardian that Boris Johnson and 17 staff had a gathering in the Downing Street garden during the first pandemic lockdown prompted <a>fury</a>.</p>
<p>Although they knew early on that things were moving in their favour, Morgan said she was never quite sure they had done enough to win.</p>
<p>She said there were multiple issues, including anger at ambulance waiting times and concerns among the farming community, which helped swing the vote in her favour.</p>
<a>Boris Johnson</a> just really doesn’t care about the farming sector.”
<p>In her election speech, Morgan launched a blistering attack on the government, describing Johnson’s rule as a “nightly soap opera of calamity and chaos”.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson is not expected to announce further restrictions on Monday after he is briefed on the impact Christmas had on Covid infections and hospital pressures.</p>
<p>Key evidence that the government will examine on Monday includes data on the length of stay in hospitals, the transition rates to ICU and new death figures.</p>
<p>There is concern among some government figures about undeclared positive cases, including those who are asymptomatic but also those isolating after a lateral flow test whose results are not recorded by the NHS because they do not take a PCR test.</p>
<p>Before Christmas, Johnson’s cabinet pushed back against new curbs, with key opponents including the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng.</p>
<p>“Some in the cabinet take their cue from him because he has no axe to grind and will opt for lighter or tougher measures purely on the available data.”</p>
<a>Health</a> Security Agency analysis found those catching Omicron were 50-70% less likely to need hospital care compared with previous variants. “It was right that we didn’t rush last time given positive early data,” they said.
<p>A third cabinet minister said: “The data so far is still struggling to be persuasive of legal changes to be required.”</p>
<p>Government sources have ruled out some of the most controversial restrictions, including school closures. The Times reported on Monday that weddings and funerals would also be exempt from any further curbs on large gatherings.</p>
<p>Conservative MPs are expected to be fiercely resistant to any changes. One Tory MP, Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, said the prime minister should “wait and see” what happens with Omicron in the coming days before taking a decision on further measures.</p>
<p>“But, at the moment, I would urge caution because of the damage to the economy and the damage to individuals by locking them down unnecessarily.”</p>
<p>Asked whether he was concerned that England was “out of step” with the rest of the UK in terms of Omicron restrictions, the Cotswolds MP replied: “I think it is the other way round.</p>
<p>He said should Johnson choose to strengthen the measures required to tackle Omicron, it would “not be a cop-out at all” to introduce them as guidance rather than written into law, adding: “I think that would be a very sensible way to go forward.”</p>
<p>Boris Johnson is “a significant drag on Tory fortunes”, according to a poll that tested the Conservative party’s chances at the next election with different leaders at the helm.</p>
<p>The current chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has a much better chance of challenging Keir Starmer’s Labour than the incumbent prime minister, according to the poll by Opinium shared exclusively with the Guardian.</p>
<p>The pollster found 39% of people asked intended to vote Labour at the next election, seven points ahead of the <a>Conservatives</a> on 32%.</p>
<p>But when Johnson’s name was added to the voting intention question, Tory support dipped below 30%, and Labour’s lead increased from seven to 12%.</p>
<p>Sunak emerged as by far the most attractive successor, with Labour maintaining its lead but by just three points if the chancellor was to take over as leader.</p>
<p>The nine-point difference between a 12-point and three-point lead was worth about 60 seats that Tories would lose with Johnson but retain with Sunak, the polling suggested.</p>
<a>YouGov</a> opinion polling organisation, said: “It might be expected that simply reminding voters of the names of the two main party leaders would make little difference to voting intentions.
<p>“The fact that it shifts the party lead by five points suggests that Johnson is now a significant drag on Tory fortunes.”</p>
<p>Voters were asked: “Please imagine that at the next election [NAME] was leader of the Conservative party and Keir Starmer was the leader of the Labour party. Who do you think you would vote for?”</p>
<p>As well as Johnson, Opinium asked people how they would vote under three further scenarios: if Sunak, Liz Truss or Michael Gove led the Tories – and in each scenario assumed that Starmer remained Labour’s leader.</p>
<p>Truss is far less popular with the wider public than with Conservative activists, the polling suggests.</p>
<p>The latest survey of party members <a>conducted by the Conservative Home website</a> showed her as their favourite successor to Johnson, with Sunak second.</p>
<p>However, Opinium’s figures suggest that she would do even worse than Johnson, and far worse than Sunak, and lead the Tories to a crushing 16-point defeat.</p>
<p>Gove, however, would do worse again, according to the poll. With him as leader, the Tories would lag Labour by 18 points.</p>
<p>Kellner added: “As with all such polls, the numbers may change. Truss could reasonably argue that she is not yet as well known as Sunak; were she to be elected party leader, she would have ample opportunity to burnish her image.</p>
<p>“In contrast, Sunak might face a difficult spring, as living standards fall, with inflation outstripping pay, and tax rises coming in April.</p>
<p>“Even so, the gulf between Sunak and Truss is currently big enough to make the choice of Truss as leader a clear electoral risk.”</p>
<p>The seat predictions are based on a uniform swing, that is, they take no account of local factors, tactical voting or boundary changes and should be regarded as a broad guide, not a precise projection.</p>
<p>The research showed Johnson projected to win 203 seats, compared with 263 under Sunak, 162 under Truss and 136 if the party were led by Gove. The Conservative party currently holds 361 seats; 326 are needed to form a majority government.</p>
<a>the refurbishment of the prime minister’s Downing Street flat</a> and various
<a>claims of lockdown parties</a> in Whitehall and No 10 have all damaged Johnson and the Conservatives’ reputation, against a backdrop of surging Covid cases and the prospect of more restrictions nearly two years into the pandemic.
<p>Conservative MPs in marginal seats will enter 2022 with an agonising dilemma. Do they stay loyal to <a>Boris Johnson</a>, who helped them win two years ago, or depose him in order to keep their seats next time?</p>
<p>But when Johnson’s name is added to the voting intention question, Tory support dips below 30%, and Labour’s lead increases five percentage points to 12%.</p>
<a>Rishi Sunak</a>, Liz Truss or Michael Gove led the Tories. (Each scenario assumed that
<a>Keir Starmer</a> remained Labour’s leader.) Sunak emerges as by far the most attractive successor. Labour stays ahead, but by just three points.
<p>The nine-point difference between a 12% and 3% lead is worth about 60 seats that Tories would lose with Johnson but retain with Sunak – the great majority to Labour, but a handful at risk to the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party.</p>
<p><a>Liz Truss</a> is far less popular with the wider public than with Conservative activists. The latest survey of party members conducted by the Conservative Home website shows her as their favourite successor to Johnson, with Sunak second.</p>
<a>Gove</a> would do even worse: with him as leader, the Tories would lag Labour by 18 points.
<a>tax rises coming in April</a>.
<p>Even so, the gulf between Sunak and Truss is currently big enough to make the choice of Truss as leader a clear electoral risk.</p>
<p>Meanwhile one intriguing feature of Opinium’s figures is that they contradict the fashionable theory that female voters have become especially hostile to <a>Johnson</a>.</p>

<p>“I was quite tentative about it all,” said Sheldon, “but the whole thing has been an absolute dream.”</p>
<p>Dylan played the role of a pregnant Adrianna in Stratford upon Avon and on tour. She then shared the part with Sheldon, before stepping down in November before the birth of her son.</p>
<p>“I was nervous at first about how Hedydd would feel about the arrangement,” recalls Sheldon. “But having been an understudy to Hayley Atwell before, I knew that whatever my own take on the role might be, I needed to fit in.</p>
<p>“Luckily for me, Hedydd turned out to be a class act,” added Sheldon.</p>
<p>When the play’s director, Phillip Breen, learned Dylan was pregnant, he decided to make her character pregnant to match, allowing the actor to stay in the role throughout the run at Stratford upon Avon and on tour.</p>
<p>“I felt proud that other actresses in a similar position might be encouraged and inspired by my experience and hopefully feel less frightened of the prospect of juggling an acting career and having a baby,” Dylan told the Observer.</p>
<p>The RSC was following in the footsteps of Chichester Festival <a>Theatre</a>, which allowed the central role of Nellie Forbush in the musical South Pacific to be shared by the actors Gina Beck and Alex Young in the summer.</p>
<p>Raising Films also runs a website that links workers to job sharing schemes, including the Media Parents, the union Bectu’s TakeTwo, and Share My Telly Job (SMTJ), set up by Louise Patel in 2015.</p>
<a>The Time Project</a>, which is an industrywide way of recording hours for everyone working off-screen in British TV.
<p>Mothers and babies are being put at risk as vital health checks and support services remain shut months after lockdown was lifted, health professionals and charities have warned.</p>
<p>Face-to-face services for new families stopped when lockdown began in March last year and have not come back in many parts of the country.</p>
<p>Now experts fear the spread of <a>the Omicron variant</a> and the reintroduction of some restrictions means the reopening will be delayed further.</p>
<p>Missing services include drop-in baby-weighing clinics, tongue-tie clinics, face-to-face breastfeeding support and council-run baby classes and playgroups.</p>
<p>Experts have accused the government of failing to prioritise the needs of a generation of babies and their parents, with <a>cost-cutting and a shortage of midwives and health visitors</a> blamed for the closures.</p>
<p>Parents told the Observer they have been unable to access in-person support in parts of London, Essex, Sussex, Yorkshire, Berkshire, Tyne and Wear, Warwickshire and Shropshire.</p>
<a>No One Wants to See My Baby</a> report by charities the Parent-Infant Foundation, Home-Start UK and Best Beginnings.
<p>The Institute of <a>Health</a> Visiting said different interpretations of government guidance meant some areas had brought back full services while others had not, creating a “postcode lottery of support for families”.</p>
<p>It questioned official advice that routine checks could continue to be done via video and telephone calls, warning there was no evidence these were “safe or effective”.</p>
<p>“I don’t know of anything else in society that hasn’t come back, with or without restrictions… but the fact is that many of these services haven’t come back at all.”</p>
<p>After Suzanne Ekpenyong, 40, gave birth to her second child, Malakai, in West Sussex in August, she was told by health visitors she should “look at the baby to see if he’s getting bigger”, instead of trying to get him weighed.</p>
<p><a>Postnatal depression</a> and anxiety rates have tripled since the start of the pandemic, she said.</p>
<a>the public health grant</a> will continue to ensure investment is made in … frontline services.”

<a>It’s a family show: actors with new babies job-share leading roles</a>
<p>1 Start the conversation early, ideally before your child gets a smartphone or social media account so they are prepared for the risks – and benefits – of life online.</p>
<p>3 Don’t let porn become a taboo subject. Don’t let awkwardness build, the children’s commissioner’s guide says. “It should be something that parents talk about to their kids,” was the message from 16- to 21-year-olds.</p>
<p>6 Laughter can help. “Our young people told us that laughing with their parent can break tension and makes everyone feel more comfortable – they don’t want you to be too serious or scary,” the commissioner’s guide says.</p>
<p>8 Try not to overreact. If they come across porn – either accidentally or deliberately – try to explain why watching adult content too young can be harmful. “Don’t punish instead of having a proper good talk.”</p>
<p>10 Do your homework. Young people want their parents to learn about new technology. They also want parents to be better informed about the risks of the online world and how to prevent early exposure to harmful content, including online pornography.</p>
<p>Parents should start to talk to their children about online pornography and sexual harassment when they are as young as nine or 10, ideally before they have a smartphone or social media account, the children’s commissioner for England has said.</p>
<p>Dame Rachel de Souza urged parents to “talk early, and talk often” to their children in an age-appropriate way, so they are better prepared for the risks of the online world and will find it easier to raise difficult issues further down the line.</p>
<p>Concern has been growing about the ease of access to and damaging impact of online pornography on young children who often browse the internet unsupervised and are exposed to material that shows degradation and violence towards women.</p>
<a>Everyone’s Invited movement</a>, which revealed widespread sexual harassment and abuse in schools, fuelling concern that online porn can influence real-life behaviours and attitudes around gender roles, sex and consent.
<a>Children</a> have told us they want their mums and dads to create a safe, judgment‑free space for them to talk about these issues. It’s better to do that before you hit a problem rather than trying to create that mood while you’re dealing with one.”

<p>The anxieties are so poignant – would they be heading into their 20s without having had sex? Was it possible to miss the boat altogether? Could a lack of experience become such a millstone that you would be stuck with it for ever?</p>
<a>unfairly deflated by an algorithm</a>, but I can imagine the world in which it feels worse.
<a>mini Covid study</a> that found that three-quarters of cohabitants reported a change in their sex lives, which was more likely to be for the worse.
<p>Thus, a plan was hatched. Three friends would each set me up on a <a>blind date</a>. I’m good-looking (with a squint), charming (after a few drinks) and a good catch, they assured me. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>“Odd,” I thought as I set my bearings to the nearest tube. “Why is it still dark at 9am?”</p>
<p>“Also,” I thought, shortly afterwards, “why is the tube shut at 9am?”</p>
<p>These are my dating ghosts of Christmases past. And, to Thom, Louise and Katie: I am truly sorry.</p>
<p>“And you’re the most beautiful girl,” he replied.</p>

<p>There was much to love about the conference and, as I travelled home, fantasising about a hot bath and a thick duvet, I allowed my mind to wander, imagining meeting Carla in a little more comfort back in London.</p>
<p>The couple exchanged their vows. They promised to love each other, in sickness and in health. My sister came back down the aisle, on the arm of her new husband. They both looked disturbingly happy.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me,” I said. “I don’t want to know.”</p>
