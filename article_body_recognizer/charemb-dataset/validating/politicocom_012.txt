<h2>What the 14th Century Plague Tells Us About How Covid Will Change Politics</h2>

<b> </b>The recent surge in workers
<a>quitting low wage jobs</a>, especially in the leisure and hospitality industries, has left employers scrambling to fill empty positions. Some suggest that the Covid pandemic and its fallout have, at least in the short run,
<a>augmented the bargaining power of labor</a>. While the
<a>available evidence on this point is mixed</a> (there has been only a modest increase in inflation-adjusted wage rates and little change to overall levels of inequality), the history of the Black Death suggests
<b> </b>that pandemic-driven shifts in the labor supply can have important and long-lasting economic and political ramifications.
<a>poison in the air</a>. Easily treated by antibiotics today, treatments at the time consisted of ineffective and potentially damaging procedures such as bloodletting. If allowed to take its course, plague has extremely high mortality —
<a>roughly 60 percent-70</a> percent of afflicted individuals will succumb to the disease. So when the plague entered Europe via trading routes with Central Asia, the result was a calamity of unfathomable magnitude.

<h2>For 2nd straight month, Americans quit jobs at a record pace</h2>
<p>The figures point to a historic level of turmoil in the job market as newly-empowered workers quit jobs to take higher pay that is being dangled by businesses in need of help</p>
<div> <p> A hiring sign is displayed in Downers Grove, Ill., on June 24, 2021. | Nam Y. Huh, File/AP Photo</p> <div> <div> <p> By ASSOCIATED PRESS</p> <p><time>11/12/2021 12:08 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Americans quit their jobs at a record pace for the second straight month in September, in many cases for more money elsewhere as companies bump up pay to fill job openings that are close to an all-time high. </p>
<a>said Friday that 4.4 million people </a>quit their jobs in September, or about 3% of the nation's workforce. That's up
<a>from 4.3 million in August</a> and far above the pre-pandemic level of 3.6 million. There were 10.4 million job openings, down from 10.6 million in August, which was revised higher.
<a>Incomes are rising</a>, Americans are spending more and the economy is growing, and employers have
<a>ramped up hiring </a>to keep pace. Rising inflation, however, is
<a>offsetting much of the pay gains</a> for workers.
<p>It is typically perceived as a signal of worker confidence when people leave the jobs they hold. The vast majority of people quit for a new position. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, in a research note Thursday, estimates that most of the 5 million are older Americans who have decided to retire. Only about 1.7 million are aged 25 through 54, which economists consider prime working years. </p>
<p>Businesses in other countries are facing similar challenges, leading to pay gains and higher inflation in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>Competition for U.S. workers is <a>intense for retailers and delivery companies</a>, particularly as they staff up for what is expected to be a healthy winter holiday shopping season. </p>
<p>Online giant Amazon is hiring <a>125,000 permanent drivers and warehouse workers </a>and offer pay between $18 and $22 an hour. It's also paying sign-on bonuses of up to $3,000. </p>
<p>Seasonal hiring is also ramping up. Package delivery company UPS is seeking to add 100,000 workers to help with the crush of holiday orders, and plans to make job offers to some applicants <a>within 30 minutes</a>.</p>

<h2>Legal brawl over Biden's vaccine mandate could curb other workplace safety efforts </h2>
<p>The current 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court appears poised to place some limits on agency actions. </p>
<p> The Supreme Court has only twice struck down laws under the non-delegation doctrine, and the last time was nearly a century ago. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p>

<a>announced earlier this month</a>, that would make private businesses with more than 100 employees mandate vaccination against Covid-19 or have their employees submit to weekly testing for the virus. The requirement is supposed to kick in Jan. 4, but it
<a> has been stayed</a> by a federal court based in New Orleans.
<p>Some of the legal challenges argue, in part, that Congress didn’t give the Occupational Safety and Health Administration — the agency that issued the mandate — the authority to do so, and even if Congress did, then it shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>“If the Supreme Court says that the statute granting OSHA authority is vague and imprecise, you could see a number of challenges to OSHA regulations relating to workplace hazards that have gone unchallenged for many years,” he added.</p>
<p>First, though, the fight over the rule will play out before the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has a more than 2-to-1 majority of Republican-appointed judges.</p>
<p>But that court is unlikely to have the final say — as either losing party could ultimately appeal the challenge to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Critics say the vaccine-or-test mandate exceeds those parameters.</p>
<p>“That's the big overreach. And I think if the Supreme Court gets the [case], that's what they’re going to find,” said Sullivan, now co-chair of the workplace safety practice at Cozen O’Connor.</p>
<p>“Because if this isn't a grave danger, I don’t know what is,” she said.</p>
<p>Still, former OSHA officials say they are confident the vaccine-or-test emergency standard won't be thrown out.</p>
<p>The Labor Department argued that it is squarely within its right under the law to issue the standard, in its response to <a>a stay issued by a Louisiana-based appeals court earlier this month</a>.</p>
<p>The Justice Department declined to comment for this article.</p>
<p>Two Wisconsin-based manufacturers made this argument in one of the lawsuits filed against the vaccine rule in the 7th Circuit Court, suggesting that OSHA’s power should be limited to policing hazards “unique to the workplace.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has only twice struck down laws under the non-delegation doctrine, and the last time was nearly a century ago.</p>
<p>The high court has also <a>agreed to consider</a> a similar argument over whether to curb the Environmental Protection Agency’s ability to regulate carbon emissions.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if the court rules against the vaccine-or-test mandate under the non-delegation principle, it could open the door to challenges to regulations from other agencies beyond the Labor Department.</p>

<p>The decision by National Labor Relations Board Region 10 Director Lisa Henderson largely rests on the e-commerce giant's decision to install a mailbox in front of the fulfillment center to collect employees' mail-in ballots for the union election. </p>
<p>"The Employer’s flagrant disregard for the Board’s typical mail-ballot procedure compromised the authority of the Board and made a free and fair election impossible," Henderson said.</p>
<p>The new election is the latest turn in the union’s fight to form Amazon’s first-ever U.S. union. </p>
<p>Workers at the facility overwhelmingly voted — 1,798 to 738 — against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union in April. </p>
<p>But, after the union filed dozens of objections to the election results and a multi-week hearing overseen by the NLRB’s Atlanta regional office, an NLRB hearing officer recommended in August that the board conduct a new election. </p>
<p>Kerstin Meyers, the hearing officer for the NLRB's Region 10 office, found that Amazon interfered with the "conditions necessary to conduct a fair election" by installing the mailbox and offering employees anti-union badges and signs.</p>
<p>The decision Henderson issued Monday affirmed that recommendation and outlined directions for the new election. </p>
<p>The union lauded the move, saying it confirmed the objections they raised about Amazon's behavior throughout the union drive. </p>
<b> </b>and as the Regional Director has indicated, that is both unacceptable and illegal,” Stuart Appelbaum, president of the union, said in a statement. “Amazon workers deserve to have a voice at work, which can only come from a union.”
<p>Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Democrats are running out of road in their pursuit of universal paid leave, and the GOP isn't building them an off-ramp.</p>
<p>Gillibrand maintains the only way to cover West Virginians with low incomes is “a universal mandatory benefit. And the only chance of ever covering them would be something we would do now during reconciliation.”</p>
<p>Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), among the most amenable Republicans to working with Democrats, said she would essentially like to start back at the drawing board since Senate Democrats’ legislation isn’t going through the normal review process.</p>
<p>“What we should do is go through the committee process and look at all the options, hear from the experts on what would make the biggest difference,” Collins said in an interview.</p>
<p>If Manchin follows through on taking out the program, Congressional Democrats are skeptical that their GOP colleagues would ever come on board with a paid leave measure that the White House supports.</p>
<p>“I hear them express that they support it but then they want to plunder Social Security in order to pay for it,” Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said of Republicans.</p>
<p>And, it turns out, Republicans share Democrats’ skepticism.</p>
<p>“There are some who say it needs to be universal and I just don’t see that happening,” said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who is close friends with Gillibrand. “She’s not bought into my idea and I’m not bought into hers.”</p>
<a>which they say would burden employers at an inopportune time</a>.
<a>Republican-backed idea of tax credits would also not address those concerns</a>.
<p>So paid leave advocates are insistent that when it comes to instituting paid leave, it’s either now in the party-line bill — or decades down the road.</p>
<p>“If Manchin believes that, I’d love to see the list of 60 senators who would support that,” said Dawn Huckelbridge, director of Paid Leave for All. “It’s disingenuous to say that there’s another way to get this done.”</p>
<p>Even the U.S. Chamber of Commerce acknowledges that the odds of both sides reaching a bipartisan agreement on the policy are slim at best. Like Manchin, the group wants paid leave to be enacted outside reconciliation.</p>

<h2>Ryan Zinke is Running for Office Again in Montana. On Instagram, He’s Often in Santa Barbara.</h2>
<p>Donald Trump’s scandal-plagued first Interior secretary has a good shot at winning Montana’s new House seat. But his opponents have seized on a weak point.</p>
<div><div><p> Illustration by Ben Giles</p> <div> <div> <p> By MIRANDA GREEN</p> <p><time>10/08/2021 04:30 AM EDT</time></p> </div> </div> <p><i>Miranda Green is a reporter in Los Angeles.</i></p></div></div>
<p>“We really haven’t seen him in Montana,” said Cora Neumann, a Democrat from Bozeman who is one of four candidates running against Zinke so far.</p>
<a>It’s long been known</a> that Zinke splits his time between Whitefish and Santa Barbara, California, where his wife owns property and a yacht — a point
<a>about $181,000, as of July</a> —
<a>largely from non-Montanans</a>, as well.
<p>“I don’t think Ryan has been a true Montanan for a very long time,” said Fielder, now a member of the Montana Public Service Commission, a state regulatory agency.</p>

<a>the DOJ has not officially completed its work</a>. And there is a chance Zinke still could benefit from

<a>.</a> Shortly before his official campaign launch this summer, Zinke also spoke to a group at a rooftop venue in Santa Barbara overlooking the Pacific Ocean, where he referred to D.C. as a “cesspool,”

<a>Zinke gave him and Lesar of the Lincoln Memorial</a>, Malmquist characterized the interactions as a D.C. welcome for fellow Montanans and said he had not discussed the 95 Karrow development with Zinke on the trip.

<p>Covid-19 antigen tests may be less capable of detecting the fast-spreading Omicron variant, the Food and Drug Administration cautioned on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Early data suggests that antigen tests do detect the Omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity,” <a>the FDA said on Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>Many popular at-home antigen tests are intended to be used serially — meaning people should take two tests on separate days — to ensure more accurate results.</p>
<p>“Although the data is preliminary, the FDA believes it is important to share with the public,” FDA spokesperson Stephanie Caccomo told POLITICO. “We will continue to keep the public informed if additional information comes to light.”</p>
<p>The new NIH data comes less than a week after a different NIH study of heat-inactivated Omicron samples found antigen tests were able to detect the Omicron “with similar performance” to other variants.</p>

<div> <p> Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted in the sexual abuse scandal involving Jeffrey Epstein. | Laura Cavanaugh/Getty Images</p> <div> <div> <p> By ASSOCIATED PRESS</p> <p><time>12/29/2021 05:15 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>NEW YORK — The British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted Wednesday of luring teenage girls to be sexually abused by the American millionaire Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
<p>The defense had insisted Maxwell was a victim of a vindictive prosecution devised to deliver justice to women deprived of their main villain when Epstein killed himself while awaiting trial in 2019.</p>
<p>During the trial, prosecutors called 24 witnesses to give jurors a picture of life inside Epstein’s homes — a subject of public fascination and speculation ever since his 2006 arrest in Florida in a child sex case.</p>
<p>Pilots took the witness stand and dropped the names of luminaries — Britain’s Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump — who flew on Epstein’s private jets.</p>
<p>Jurors saw physical evidence like a folding massage table once used by Epstein and a “black book” that listed contact information for some of the victims under the heading “massages.”</p>
<p>There were bank records showing he had transferred $30.7 million to Maxwell, his longtime companion — onetime girlfriend, later employee.</p>
<p>But the core of the prosecution was the testimony of four women who said they were victimized by Maxwell and Epstein at tender ages.</p>
<p>Carolyn testified that she was one of several underprivileged teens who lived near Epstein’s Florida home in the early 2000s and took up an offer to give massages in exchange for $100 bills, which prosecutors described as “a pyramid of abuse.”</p>
<p>Maxwell made all the arrangements, Carolyn told the jury, even though she knew the girl was only 14 at the time.</p>
<p>Jane said in 1994, when she was only 14, she was instructed to follow Epstein into a pool house at his Palm Beach estate, where he masturbated on her.</p>
<p>Two charges, including the lone count on which Maxwell was acquitted, applied only to Jane.</p>
<p>“I was frozen in fear,” she told the jury, adding that assault was the first time she had ever seen a penis. She also directly accused Maxwell of participating in her abuse.</p>
<p>Maxwell’s lawyer asked Jane why it had taken so long to come forward.</p>
<p>“I was scared,” she said, choking back tears. “I was embarrassed, ashamed. I didn’t want anybody to know any of this about me.”</p>
<p>The last to testify, Farmer described how Maxwell touched her breasts while giving her a massage at Epstein’s New Mexico ranch and how Epstein unexpectedly crawled into bed and pressed himself against her.</p>
<p>Maxwell, 60, vehemently denied the charges through her lawyers.</p>
<p>Still, she declined to take the risk of testifying, telling the judge: “The government has not proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt so there is no reason for me to testify.”</p>
<p>“The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell are for things that Jeffrey Epstein did,” one of Maxwell’s lawyers, Bobbi Sternheim, emphasized to the jury. “But she is not Jeffrey Epstein and she is not like Jeffrey Epstein.”</p>
<p>Maxwell’s legal team questioned whether the accusers’ memories were faulty, or had been influenced by lawyers seeking big payouts from Maxwell and from Epstein’s estate in civil court.</p>
<p>She said memory can be contaminated by suggestions made by an interviewer, particularly law enforcement or the media.</p>
<p>Before Maxwell was taken from the courtroom, defense attorney Bobbi Sternheim asked that arrangements be made to give her a coronavirus booster shot, saying infection rates were rising dramatically at the lockup.</p>
<p>The legal fights involving Epstein and Maxwell are not over.</p>
<p>Maxwell still awaits trial on two counts of perjury.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday condemned Hong Kong’s arrest of seven Stand News employees and called on China to stop “targeting” the city’s free press. </p>
<p>Blinken also demanded the release of the journalists and media executives detained and charged in Wednesday’s raid. </p>
<a>editorial policy was to be independent and committed to safeguarding Hong Kong’s core values</a> of democracy, human rights, freedom, the rule of law and justice,” the announcement said. “Thank you, readers, for your continued support.”
<p>Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, has yet to clarify how journalists can avoid breaking the broad yet vague national security law.</p>

<p><b>HARRY REID’s</b> journey from a poverty-stricken rock miner’s son to the Senate majority leader was so novelistic the details seem made up. </p>
<p><b>In his obituary, </b>NYT’s Jonathan Martin <a>rightly describes Reid</a>, who died Tuesday at 82 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, growing up “in almost Dickensian circumstances” in Searchlight, down in the tip of Nevada:</p>
<p><b>“His home had no indoor plumbing, </b>his father was an alcoholic miner who eventually died by suicide, and his mother helped the family survive by taking in laundry from local brothels.”</p>
<b>On the way to the Senate there were stints as an amateur boxer </b>and a Capitol Police officer, several losing campaigns, and positions at the highest levels of Nevada politics.
<b>BARACK OBAMA</b> noted in his memoir that throughout this journey Reid “was the first to tell you that he had never lost that chip on his shoulder.”
<b>In a statement, </b>Senate Minority Leader
<p><b>In 2005, as the new Democratic leader</b> in the Senate, he brought a sharper edge to the job and immediately started to deflate the presidency of <b>GEORGE W. BUSH.</b> </p>
<b>“Reid took over as Senate leader</b> when
<b>TOM DASCHLE</b> unexpectedly lost in 2004,”
<b>“Sometimes, in a quiet or difficult moment,</b> Harry Reid would reach out,”
<a>Rep. <b>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ </b>(D-N.Y.) wrote</a>. “It was like he knew. His counsel, encouragement, kindness, and generosity was so deeply moving. It was sincere. And I will never forget it.”
<b>“HMR was a great boss, </b>a master legislative and political strategist and I know a lot will be written about all of that,”
<b>LANDRA,</b> to his daughter and granddaughters to the countless staff and advisors. I wouldn’t be where I am today without his mentorship.”
