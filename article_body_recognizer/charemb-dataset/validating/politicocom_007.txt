<p><b>Before taking off for the holidays</b>, the four long-standing hosts of “The View” had a message for executive producer <b>BRIAN TETA:</b> We’re tired of the rotating cast of Republican guest hosts. </p>
<b>When MEGHAN MCCAIN departed in August, </b>Teta initially told
<a>the Wrap</a> that he was “taking a little time” to find a replacement. Since then, ABC has tried out a variety of conservative fill-ins, including
<b>ALYSSA FARAH, MORGAN ORTAGUS, CONDOLEEZZA RICE</b>,
<b>Nearly six months in, the show </b>has yet to settle on a permanent replacement. And now, the longtime co-hosts —
<b> SUNNY HOSTIN</b> — are upping the pressure to pick a successor, and voicing their displeasure at having to introduce new guest hosts week after week in a seemingly endless process that they find disruptive to the flow of the show.
<p><b>“Right now, we still do need a really conservative voice,”</b> Hostin told <a>New York Magazine</a> in November. “And we need someone that’s not duplicative of anyone else on the panel.”</p>
<b>According to a spokesperson for “The View,” </b>the program will continue to audition potential hosts in the new year, bringing some women back for a second turn. Farah will return in January, and the show will bring in other big names, like
<b>LISA LING</b> — neither of whom exactly fit the “conservative” label — while the network continues to conduct focus groups on the audience’s reaction.
<p><b>“The problem is that they bring people on under the mantle</b> that this woman is a conservative, when they’re ‘Never Trump,’ so they don’t represent the country,” said one of the rotating guest hosts.</p>
<b>At the same time, the anti-Trump conservative </b>can’t be seen as too chummy with the other co-hosts, as the network’s market-research shows that the audience wants to see the women spar. Sources said that this has hurt the chances of
<b> ANA NAVARRO</b>, a regular fill-in on the conservative chair who worked as a surrogate for
<b>JOE BIDEN</b> in 2020: She is perceived by the producers as too friendly with the other hosts and not a traditional Republican.
<p><b>“They are really looking for a unicorn,”</b> said a former show staffer. “They want someone who is going to fight — but not too hard, because they don’t want it to be ugly and bickering.”</p>
<b>It doesn’t help that there’s a perception </b>that whoever sits in the conservative host slot is on borrowed time, with prominent Republican former co-hosts like
<b>NICOLLE WALLACE, ELIZABETH HASSELBECK, ABBY HUNTSMAN </b>and McCain leaving the show with claims of being
<a>bullied by their co-hosts and ABC executives on-set and off,</a> while veterans like Goldberg
<b>Sources said that the show</b> was eager to recruit young libertarian

<p><b>HARRY REID’s</b> journey from a poverty-stricken rock miner’s son to the Senate majority leader was so novelistic the details seem made up. </p>
<p><b>In his obituary, </b>NYT’s Jonathan Martin <a>rightly describes Reid</a>, who died Tuesday at 82 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer, growing up “in almost Dickensian circumstances” in Searchlight, down in the tip of Nevada:</p>
<p><b>“His home had no indoor plumbing, </b>his father was an alcoholic miner who eventually died by suicide, and his mother helped the family survive by taking in laundry from local brothels.”</p>
<b>On the way to the Senate there were stints as an amateur boxer </b>and a Capitol Police officer, several losing campaigns, and positions at the highest levels of Nevada politics.
<b>BARACK OBAMA</b> noted in his memoir that throughout this journey Reid “was the first to tell you that he had never lost that chip on his shoulder.”
<b>In a statement, </b>Senate Minority Leader
<p><b>In 2005, as the new Democratic leader</b> in the Senate, he brought a sharper edge to the job and immediately started to deflate the presidency of <b>GEORGE W. BUSH.</b> </p>
<b>“Reid took over as Senate leader</b> when
<b>TOM DASCHLE</b> unexpectedly lost in 2004,”
<b>“Sometimes, in a quiet or difficult moment,</b> Harry Reid would reach out,”
<a>Rep. <b>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ </b>(D-N.Y.) wrote</a>. “It was like he knew. His counsel, encouragement, kindness, and generosity was so deeply moving. It was sincere. And I will never forget it.”
<b>“HMR was a great boss, </b>a master legislative and political strategist and I know a lot will be written about all of that,”
<b>LANDRA,</b> to his daughter and granddaughters to the countless staff and advisors. I wouldn’t be where I am today without his mentorship.”
<b>NANCY PELOSI,</b> was the highest elected woman in America.)
<b>They had some big victories, </b>including an $800 billion stimulus, the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, the end of Don’t Ask Don’t Tell, and the confirmation of
<b>ELENA KAGAN</b> to the Supreme Court. In 2013 he changed Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster for most presidential nominations.
<a><b>In a letter to Reid that he shared publicly Tuesday</b></a>
<b>, </b>Obama wrote, “I wouldn’t have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn’t have got most of what I got done without your skill and determination.”
<p><b>We reached out to a number of people who knew Reid well</b> and asked them to share their remembrances. Here’s some of what we received:</p>
<p>“After we left the meeting I asked him why in the hell would you say that. Sen. Reid threw up his hands and said, ‘Because he was fat.’ (He was.) I worked in the Senate for 21 years, and unlike most politicians, he really was unafraid to mix it up.”</p>
<b>GENE SPERLING, longtime adviser to BILL CLINTON, Obama and JOE BIDEN: </b>“He used a

<p>While Schumer leads the party with relentless messaging discipline and a focus on lockstep party unity, Reid favored all-out political combat. Sometimes Reid battled members of his own party, but he reveled in partisan bomb-throwing. </p>
<a>took to the Senate floor together in 2015</a> to dispute the tone of
<a>along with two other senators</a>, didn’t matter in a chamber where Reid controlled 55 votes and just needed a simple majority for a rules change.
<p>At the moment, Schumer is left with 50 seats — severely handicapping what can be done on both Biden’s agenda and to the fabric of the Senate entirely.</p>
<p>Remembering Reid, Schumer called him “my leader, my mentor, one of my dearest friends.” The two continued speaking regularly since Reid left office. </p>
<a>longtime conservative bona fides</a> to the curb. Reid's majority was stacked with moderates from red states; Schumer's senators from Arizona and Georgia reflect the new direction of the party.
<a>voted against him in his last leadership election</a> after Democrats lost the Senate in 2014, a sign of how polarizing he was within the Democratic Party.
<p>Yet even during that period of discontent, Democrats credited Reid with having the party’s best interests in mind as he drew relentless heat from Republicans for not allowing more amendment votes. </p>
<p>“He’ll be a good leader. He won’t be like me, we’re different,” Reid predicted in a 2016 interview. “Two different personalities. He’s a press guy, I’m not.”</p>
<a>he casually explained</a> he wasn’t going to put Obama’s fast-track trade bill up for a vote. He showered Mitt Romney with dubious attacks on the Senate floor in 2012.
<p>And Reid was unrepentant about his tactics a few years later. <a>He explained the entire Romney episode</a> in blunt black and white: “Romney didn’t win, did he?”</p>
<a>he excoriated Trump</a> as a “sexual predator who lost the popular vote.” But even though he was still the minority leader, Reid also began largely deferring to Schumer in his final weeks in office.
<a>Schumer helped Senate Democrats</a> get their issue visibility in the press but didn’t force a shutdown fight. Throughout the drama, Reid mostly let his successor handle it.
<p>And for the first time Democrats asked themselves: What would Harry Reid have done?</p>

<p><i>Steve Johnson, a freelance writer in Chicago, is a former longtime Chicago Tribune television critic.</i></p>
<p>Television, the catch-all name for the stuff that gets delivered on a flattish device of the same title, had a lot to reckon with in 2021.</p>
<p>There was the ongoing confusion engendered by the slo-mo collapses of traditional cable and even-more-traditional networks and by the ever-expanding number of streaming services.</p>
<p>But mostly, in 2021, politics was there influencing, infecting and, in the best moments, enhancing the stories that occupied the small screen.</p>
<p>The year that is about to, thankfully, pass followed on the heels of the first nine months of a pandemic which all too often was used as a political weapon: Reject science to own the libs!</p>
<p>The year has seen, too, a reexamination of employment, with millions of workers suddenly refusing to accept Stalinesque bosses, soul-numbing labor or a de minimis minimum wage. Is it any wonder that unionization is resurgent?</p>
<p>And then there was the fight over critical race theory, QAnon, voting rights and oh, yeah, there was the insurrection …</p>
<h3>The World is Stacked Against You</h3>
<a>lifesaving operations via GoFundMe</a>.
<h3>Oh, Right — There’s Still a Pandemic</h3>
<p>But in terms of addressing the pachyderm in the room — the pandemic that promised to go away but keeps mutating — two series best hit the mark.</p>
<p>In 2021’s second season, it’s also fairly unnerving in playing back for us the first moments of Covid-19, when some people took it seriously, some scoffed and then everyone watched, aghast, as public spaces emptied out and hospital ICUs filled up.</p>
<p>Television wasn’t the absolute lifeline for people that it was during the lockdown of 2020. Heck, this year a second season of <a>“The Tiger King,” everybody’s early pandemic must-watch</a>, drew barely a nod from the broader culture.</p>

<h2>‘Two steps forward, one step back’: Omicron threatens new economic slide for women</h2>
<p>Unexpected school closures and reinstated lockdowns, on top of a crippled child care industry, could reverse what progress women have made since the pandemic abated earlier this year.</p>

<p>As Omicron threatens to shut down schools and shutter businesses, economists fear the new coronavirus variant could set working women back even further as they struggle to recover jobs lost during the first wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Another blow risks causing long-lasting damage, including setting back efforts to close their pay gap with men.</p>
<b> </b>Democrats have pointed to the so-called shecession as
<p>“Build Back Better has the jobs for the women.”</p>
<p>If women’s employment continues to lag, economists warn that it could widen the gender pay gap. Some women will have been out of the workforce so long they will have difficulty catching up.<b> </b></p>
<a>according to a POLITICO analysis of BLS data</a>, while men’s grew by 2.3 percent.
<p>Gaps on women’s resumes could, in the long run, aggravate the problem, economists warn.</p>
<a>according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</a> Women make up more than 98 percent of all elementary and middle school teachers; 70 percent of all waiters; and 94 percent of all child care workers.
<a>according to Pew Research Center</a> — means that if one parent has to leave work to care for a child, it likely makes most financial sense for it to be the woman.
<b> </b>workplace shutdowns, Sasser Modestino said, which could deprive them of in-person opportunities and become “a really large limiting factor going forward in terms of women's advancement.”
<b> </b>that includes investments in care, women won’t be able to reap most benefits for years — let alone in time to soften Omicron's blow.
<a>The child care industry must be scaled up</a>, and a paid leave program — if it’s included — would need to be built from scratch.
<p>But it would address some of the structural inequities that caused the pandemic to hit women so hard, supporters say.</p>

<div> <div> <header> <h1> Hochul looks to put her own stamp on New York governorship </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. — She's been governor of New York for more than four momentous months. But Kathy Hochul will truly claim the title next week, when she becomes the first woman in New York history to deliver a State of the State speech.</p>
<p>But on Jan. 5, Hochul will set out her own legislative priorities, seeking to put her stamp on the office she inherited while invigorating her campaign to win a term in her own right in 2022.</p>
<p>“One, it sends a message to the Legislature that you respect their role in the process,” Bellafiore said. “And two, in her case, it says ‘I'm not Cuomo.’ Frankly, that's probably 50 percent of her message.” </p>
<p>It won't be a one-woman show, Hochul told reporters during a virtual briefing Dec. 16. Everything from the scaled-back invite list to the policy proposals she'll push are being developed in coordination with legislative staff and leaders, she said.</p>
<p>“I've heard from countless members of the Legislature who remind me that it's definitely not a State of the State — it's called a Message to the Legislature,” Hochul said. “So returning it to the home of the Legislature is the right thing to do.”</p>
<a>delivered his annual message in the form of a speech to the Legislature in 1923.</a> Governors have been doing so ever since.
<p>That penchant for brevity might be in competition with an agenda she’s already vowed will extend through all corners of state government.</p>
<a>She wants to “overhaul”</a> New York’s 64-campus public university system and turn the state’s beleaguered ethics board — the Joint Commission on Public Ethics — “
<a>upside down.”</a> In September she
<a>promised state business leaders</a> new regional economic development funds and job training programs linking workers to their industries. In November she
<a>told Manhattan business leaders</a> that her State of the State speech would include her vision for electric vehicle infrastructure and a plan to make New York “the epicenter of the offshore wind systems.”
<p>“The State of the State is a vision document; the budget is the battle plan,” Bellafiore said.</p>
<p>Every State of the State requires a bit of bluster to rally political energy, but conditions to actually achieve any goals Hochul lays out are uncharacteristically on her side this year. </p>
<p>For the first time in years, the main story line will not include the caveat that New York is short on cash, Quinn noted.</p>
<a>filled some existing holes in education and health care</a>, and in October
<a>an update to the state’s financial plan</a> said that New York will probably have $3.8 billion more coming in than officials projected earlier in the year.
<p>Hochul <a>said the state has enough money</a> to balance its budget through 2025, and to finally begin increasing reserves to a more logical holding of 15 percent of state spending in case of future crises.</p>
<a>massive infrastructure investment</a> signed by President Joe Biden last month will speed up dithering road and rail projects across the state — visible achievements that voters may attribute to elected officials on both state and federal levels.
<p>An additional big-ticket political win in the Legislature could go a long way in Hochul’s reelection campaign, but policy priorities are nothing without lawmakers’ buy-in. </p>
<p>Hochul’s success, then, may depend on her perceived competence and her collegiality in negotiating a state budget, a historically contentious process between the executive and legislative chambers that Cuomo dominated to his political benefit.</p>
<p>“Whereas, if she's a governor for eight years, seven years from now, they'll be putting down sleeping bags in the [Assembly] chamber,” he said.</p>

<h2>Former GOP congressman faces Trump squeeze in key Senate race</h2>
<p>Former Rep. Mark Walker's looming decision: whether to drop down and run in a House primary, or continue his uphill bid against a Trump-endorsed rival.</p>
<p> The former congressman’s Senate bid remains in limbo after former President Donald Trump earlier this month privately offered to endorse Walker to run for a newly drawn House seat instead | J. Scott Applewhite/AP Photo</p>
<div> <div> <p> By NATALIE ALLISON</p> <p><time>12/30/2021 04:30 AM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>GREENSBORO, N.C. — Mark Walker has been here before.</p>
<p>Stuck in political no man’s land, facing an upcoming filing deadline, with his hopes of becoming a senator all but dashed and the boundaries of his familiar former House district in question.</p>
<a>privately offered to endorse</a> Walker to run for a newly drawn House seat instead. Also looming is a legal challenge to North Carolina’s map, which could result in the new district being abruptly redrawn to become heavily Democratic.
<p>When it works, the results for Walker have been spectacular. When it doesn’t work, so have the consequences. </p>
<p>“I’ll put my pride on the table, but I won’t put my principles,” Walker said in an interview earlier this month, days after Trump made the offer.</p>
<p>“On paper,” Walker said, running for the House again “makes a lot of sense.”</p>
<p>Then he won, against the odds.</p>
<p>He could have primaried Sen. Thom Tillis — a proposal Walker publicly floated twice in 2019, before announcing <a>he wouldn’t seek office</a> at all the following year, instead looking to an open Senate seat in 2022. </p>
<p>Despite Walker suggesting at the time that he would <a>have Trump’s endorsement in 2022</a> and entering the Senate race before his rivals, Walker was caught off guard when Trump announced at a June rally he was backing Budd.</p>
<p>Staying in the race, Walker admits, requires him to successfully forge his own path. It’s an approach that got him to Congress, but one that would be nearly impossible to replicate on a statewide level without significant funding.</p>
<a>Polling commission by the Club</a> this fall showed Budd still had not commanded a lead in the three-way primary, earning 33 percent support to McCrory’s 36 percent, while Walker had 13 percent of the vote.
<p>Budd's campaign declined to comment on the record for this story.</p>
<p>“I’ll walk away before I have to do that.”</p>
<p>Walking away would mean the middle-class 52-year-old rebuilding a career and finding a new job. And believing that his God-ordained vocation is to influence policy in Washington, Walker has no plans to soon return to full-time ministry. </p>
<p>Walker has successfully defied the establishment before. In a 2014 primary runoff, he beat out Coble’s endorsed successor, Phil Berger Jr.— the son of the state Senate president pro tem and now a state Supreme Court justice.</p>
<p>In January before the May primary that year, Walker’s congressional campaign had just $9,000 cash on hand, far less than Berger’s. </p>
<p>“That’s become problematic for him, specifically over the last two to three years.”</p>
<p>Walker quickly emerged as a leader in Congress, becoming chair of the Republican Study Committee after his first term, and then vice chair of the House Republican Conference in 2019. </p>
<p>While Walker takes the holidays to come up with a decision about his campaign plans, he is still waiting for Trump’s public endorsement for the House seat. </p>
<p>“I think for most realists, it’s a matter of when, not if, he decides to drop out of the Senate race,” Bitzer said of Walker. “It would be a minor miracle to pull off an upset of that magnitude.”</p>

<p> “People always ask, are you a coach or a broadcaster or a video game guy?” John Madden said when was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. “I’m a coach, always been a coach.” | Ben Margot/AP Photo</p>
<div> <div> <p> By ASSOCIATED PRESS</p> <p><time>12/28/2021 07:42 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>John Madden, the Hall of Fame coach turned broadcaster whose exuberant calls combined with simple explanations provided a weekly soundtrack to NFL games for three decades, died Tuesday morning, the NFL said. He was 85.</p>
<p>The league said he died unexpectedly and did not detail a cause.</p>
<p>“People always ask, are you a coach or a broadcaster or a video game guy?” he said when was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. “I’m a coach, always been a coach.”</p>
<p>When he finally retired from the broadcast booth, leaving NBC's “Sunday Night Football,” colleagues universally praised Madden’s passion for the sport, his preparation and his ability to explain an often-complicated game in down-to-earth terms.</p>
<p>“No one has made the sport more interesting, more relevant and more enjoyable to watch and listen to than John,” play-by-play announcer Al Michaels said at the time.</p>
<p>For anyone who heard Madden exclaim “Boom!” while breaking down a play, his love of the game was obvious.</p>
<p>“For me, TV is really an extension of coaching,” Madden wrote in “Hey, Wait a Minute! (I Wrote a Book!).”</p>
<p>“My knowledge of football has come from coaching. And on TV, all I’m trying to do is pass on some of that knowledge to viewers.”</p>
<p>Madden was raised in Daly City, California. He played on both the offensive and defensive lines for Cal Poly in 1957-58 and earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the school.</p>
<p>Al Davis brought him to the Raiders as a linebackers coach in 1967, and Oakland went to the Super Bowl in his first year in the pros. He replaced John Rauch as head coach after the 1968 season at age 32, beginning a remarkable 10-year run.</p>
<p>With his demonstrative demeanor on the sideline and disheveled look, Madden was the ideal coach for the collection of castoffs and misfits that made up those Raiders teams.</p>
<p>And boy, did they ever. Many years, the only problem was the playoffs.</p>
<p>In those days, a pass that bounced off an offensive player directly to a teammate was illegal, and the debate continues to this day over which player it hit. The catch, of course, was dubbed the “Immaculate Reception.”</p>
<p>Oakland won it all with a 32-14 Super Bowl romp against Minnesota.</p>
<p>“Players loved playing for him,” Shell said. “He made it fun for us in camp and fun for us in the regular season. All he asked is that we be on time and play like hell when it was time to play.”</p>
<p>Madden battled an ulcer the following season, when the Raiders once again lost in the AFC title game. He retired from coaching at age 42 after a 9-7 season in 1978.</p>

<p>The Times did not seek an immediate lifting of that part of the order, instead asking for an expedited hearing. </p>
<p>“We are pleased that parts of an unconstitutional order have been stayed, and we look forward to having the Appellate Division fully vacate the Supreme Court’s order,” <a>a Times spokesperson said</a>.</p>
<p><a>Project Veritas has until Jan. 14 to file its response</a> after the Appellate Division declined the paper’s request for another deadline, according to the Times. </p>
<a>the group “joined The Times in its very limited request to maintain the status quo</a> to allow appellate review because the proper administration of justice is paramount to American democracy, the First Amendment and the press’s freedom under it.”
<p>The case has drawn the attention of First Amendment and journalism advocates. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press has supported the New York Times in the Veritas litigation.</p>

<h2>Flight attendants fume as CDC gives airlines what they want on quarantine change</h2>
<p>Just days before the CDC announced the change, the airline industry united to press for a shortened quarantine timeframe.</p>

<p>A union for flight attendants is accusing the CDC of loosening rules for quarantine after Covid-19 exposure at the behest of the airline industry, as the Omicron variant continues to rage across the globe.</p>
<a>CDC announcement</a> shortening the recommended quarantine duration from 10 days to five days.
<p>“The CDC gave a medical explanation about why the agency has decided to reduce the quarantine requirements from 10 to five days, but the fact that it aligns with the number of days pushed by corporate America is less than reassuring,” Nelson said.</p>
<p>Delta Air Lines, the first to request the change to a five-day quarantine period, also noted that current guidance “was developed in 2020 when the pandemic was in a different phase without effective vaccines and treatments.”</p>
<p>Though their messaging to the administration came to a head last week, airlines have been lobbying to shape Covid-19 quarantine protocols for far longer. </p>
