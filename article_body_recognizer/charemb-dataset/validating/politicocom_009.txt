<h2>Could a School-Board Fight Over Critical Race Theory Help Turn Virginia Red?</h2>
<p>Debate around critical race theory pushed wealthy Loudoun County to the frontlines of the GOP’s culture wars. Republicans are hoping to turn that discord into political capital.</p>
<p> Republican Glenn Youngkin decries critical race theory at a campaign rally in front of the Loudoun County school board building, June 30, 2021. | Amanda Andrade-Rhoades for Politico</p>
<div> <div> <p> By MAYA KING</p> <p><time>07/07/2021 04:30 AM EDT</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>Maya King is a reporter at POLITICO.</p>
<a>textbook availability</a> and
<a>public construction projects</a>. Poring over budget proposals for custodial supplies and debating about whether to
<a>renew the contract</a> for a company supplying milk to cafeterias.
<a>investigation by the state attorney general confirmed those allegations</a>. So
<b> </b>officials scrambled to address racial disparities in their schools, rolling out an ambitious equity plan.
<a>according to Ballotpedia</a>, which has been tracking them since 2006.
<a>taught in school districts around the country where conservatives are attempting to ban it</a>.)
<p>Yet commonwealth Democrats have largely dismissed their efforts. In an early June press gaggle, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe dismissed the conservative uproar over critical race theory as a “right-wing conspiracy.”</p>
<p>But Jon Tigges, a businessman and conservative activist based in Leesburg, the governing seat of Loudoun County, has his eye on a bigger prize.</p>
<p>“What happens in Loudoun is going to echo across the rest of the country,” Tigges said. “If we win the battle here, that’s going to echo everyplace else.”</p>
<h3>‘That really started to get people fired up’</h3>
<a>according to the U.S. Census Bureau</a>. This is evidenced in part by its wineries and vineyards, making it a mainstay for its wealthier residents and a notable destination for visitors from Washington, D.C.
<a>20 percent of its population</a>.
<p>And at a campaign rally for Glenn Youngkin, even more attendees—some of whom were not parents of Loudoun County students—signed on.</p>
<i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>. And that legacy still lingers for Loudoun County’s students of color, as spelled out in
<p>Other parents described cultural challenges their students faced. One parent who wished to remain anonymous said that their children, who are Asian American, were called “terrorists” by their white peers.</p>
<p>Not everyone was on board.</p>
<p>“It’s really dumbing down our curriculum and then rewriting it in a way that is focused on inaccuracies,” said Karlee Copeland, a Loudoun County parent and treasurer of the county Republican Women’s Club, the largest of its kind in Virginia.</p>
<p>Loudoun County superintendent Scott Ziegler defended the equity plan, saying critical race theory is not part of the school curriculum.</p>
<p>“It’s not a way of administering schools,” Ziegler said. “It’s not a way of teaching students. It was never intended to be that way. But people who detract from equity work often use CRT interchangeably with equity work.”</p>
<p>“We’ve never talked about it in the form of, ‘How do we win our next election?’ It was, ‘These are the issues impacting our community,’” she said. “We’re conservatives—we conserve tradition. We’re not radical change agents.”</p>
<h3>‘It’s the color of your ideology’</h3>
<p>And some of those leading the fight against the school board don’t have children enrolled in the schools here.</p>
<p>“I’m a taxpayer. I’m a business owner. You know, so I paid for [school resources],” he said in an interview. “And the results coming out are just awful.”</p>
<p>“What we’re dealing with here is a modern-day civil rights issue,” Tigges said. “But instead of the color of your skin, it’s the color of your ideology.”</p>
<b> </b>Police arrived to disperse the crowd, arresting two, including Tigges.
<p>“It’s kind of difficult to believe that they want what’s best for kids when they’re behaving that way,” Reaser said.</p>
<p>“How much more room is there for escalation?,” said Reaser. “People died on January 6.”</p>
<h3>‘Viewing everything through the lens of race’</h3>
<a>whom a June poll from JMC Analytics shows is trailing slightly behind McAuliffe</a>. They argue his policy plans are insubstantial and decry his campaign strategy of leaning into culture war issues that animate the base.
<p>“The thing that’s gotten the play, obviously, is critical race theory, and then the transgender issues, but I think for our group, there’s so many different issues,” Prior said.</p>
<h3>‘It is absolutely, utterly exhausting’</h3>
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, are walking the line between engaging with Republican talking points and eschewing them altogether.</p>
<p>“Republicans are engaged in the newest round of their ongoing culture wars aimed at stoking hatred, divisiveness, and fear to drive their voters to the polls and keep those afraid of violence from speaking out,” the statement continues.</p>
<p>Some parents look at the push against teaching racial and gender equity in schools as misguided at best. Some parents of color, too, feel they have had to assume a role of de-facto race explainer to their white peers.</p>
<p>Thomas of the local NAACP said she feels the recent conservative push against critical race theory has distracted from the actual inequities that exist in the county.</p>
<p>And those leading the charge against critical race theory, she said, have goals that are political rather than educational.</p>
<p>“They are willing to springboard their pursuits on the backs of Black kids who have been suffering in this town for at least 80 years,” she said. “This is their pilot program.”</p>

<h2>The Surprising Strategy Behind Youngkin’s Stunner</h2>
<p>Glenn Youngkin’s top strategists Jeff Roe and Kristin Davison helped pull off one of the great upsets in modern politics. Here's how they did it.</p>
<p> How did Glenn Youngkin win in Virginia? His top strategists, Jeff Roe and Kristin Davison, give POLITICO's Ryan Lizza insight into the campaign. | Getty Images</p>
<div> <div> <p> By <span>RYAN LIZZA</span></p> <p><time>11/05/2021 04:30 AM EDT</time></p> </div> </div>
<p><i>Ryan Lizza is a Playbook co-author and the chief Washington correspondent for </i>POLITICO<i>.</i></p>
<p>Sometimes you want to hear from the strategists rather than the candidate.</p>
<p>What <i>is</i> interesting is how he won.</p>
<p><b>First of all, thank you, Kristin and Jeff for doing this, especially after a pretty long night for you guys. Let's just start by introducing yourselves and telling us what your involvement was with the campaign. </b></p>
<p><b>Kristin Davison: </b>Well, my name is Kristin Davison. I was one of the consultants on the race. I was more minute-to-minute, day-to-day here in Virginia, working with Jeff and the Youngkin campaign. </p>
<p><b>I want to get back to the narrative, but let's just give the overview right now of the takeaways. Why do you think your candidate won on Tuesday?</b></p>
<p>When we talk about this race, I'll just round off some of the math: About 27 percent of the vote was nonwhite, [and] about 27 percent of the vote is rural. Now you've got a wash. Now we're fighting over the suburbs. </p>
<i>we</i> ran on play into an actual daily voter's life. And most political issues don't.
<p><b>Roe: </b>Well, I'll tell you this real quick: There's a lot of [misconceptions] about it. </p>
<p><b>So they're all locked in? They knew who they were voting for, because they're watching political news. </b></p>
<p><b>Roe: </b>You do it for money; that's why you go on your own favorite networks — to say your website three times and raise $35,000. It's not for eyeballs; use local [media] for eyeballs, that's where you drive your content.</p>
<p>So we wanted to play offense. But there was a cost to that. You can't have too many messages, or you don't have any. On Election Day, Terry had 11 commercials running. We had three. We did a very simple-to-deliver message.</p>
<p><b>Kristin, I'm curious how the sort of Fox News-driven "culture war" element of the education issue helped. Was that something you had to navigate, or was it all upside?</b></p>
<p><b>If you had been advising McAuliffe, knowing your own strengths and weaknesses, what's the one thing you would have advised the McAuliffe campaign to do that would have been difficult for you guys?</b></p>
<p>That debate was on September 28, and the debate was over at 9:00, and we had a digital spot up by midnight, and the next spot up [and sent to TV] stations at 10 o'clock in the morning, because we thought he was going to walk it back. </p>
<p>In any poll, when you ask "who do you trust more" on an issue, Democrats usually dominate education. And in this race, we were winning [on] education by 9 points, which is really unheard of for a Republican candidate. </p>
<p><b>Why is that different, the gubernatorial race and Senate race, it really does make a difference? </b></p>
<p><b>Are you saying that his negative ads dragged his popularity down? </b></p>
<p>In terms of, you know, keeping anyone "out" of the race or this or that, it just wasn't a primal focus of what we were doing because we were so focused on what was going on on the ground. </p>
<p><b>Roe: </b>I've not heard there was tension. I worked with [Trump adviser] Susie Wiles the whole way through. She was awesome. Probably 90 percent of our votes are [from] people who supported the president — 95, maybe. I mean, no tension there. </p>
<p><b>Roe: </b>Was it a surge on turnout or surge in percentage [of the electorate]? </p>
<p><b>On margin, not their makeup of the electorate.</b></p>
<p><b>Roe: </b>Yeah, I mean, I've just never seen an exit poll that I would ever utilize. And I've not seen the numbers on this one. </p>
<p>First of all, we advertised to them. We advertised a lot. We needed to get 75 percent [of the rural vote]. So it's good to hear we got 76 percent. </p>
<p>To find something where the voter knows that you care about them and you're listening to them will help kind of weather whatever national headwinds are going on at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Roe: </b>I'll just add on top: We had 12 different language coalitions. We had bumper stickers in 12 different languages — I've got one here… I still don't know which one this one is.</p>
<p><b>Davison: </b>It's either Korean or Taiwanese… maybe Taiwanese? </p>
<i>wish</i> they would have passed the reconciliation bill and the spending bill. I wish they would have spent that. There's no way to spend $3 trillion and make people feel good about it. You cannot do that.
<p>When Jayapal is the speaker-designee and Nancy Pelosi looks like the moderate, the wheels are off. And that's probably a lesson for you for the Democrats — but don't show this to the Democrats, because we need that to continue to happen.</p>

<h2>Why Mike Lindell Can’t Stop</h2>
<p>The MyPillow tycoon has lost business pumping up Trump conspiracy theories, and probably lost his chance at a political future. But he believes he’s on a divine mission to overturn the election—and he’s not alone.</p>
<div><div><p> Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</p> <div> <div> <p> By DAVID SIDERS</p> <p><time>06/15/2021 04:30 AM EDT</time></p> </div> </div> <p><i>David Siders is a national political correspondent for POLITICO.</i></p></div></div>
<p>The dropper was full of oleandrin, a plant extract that he touts—alarmingly, to scientists—as both a preventative and “miracle” cure for Covid-19. He squeezed.</p>
<p>“Look at this … I can never get the virus,” he said, near the beginning of the roughly six hours I spent with him over two days at MyPillow. “It’s impossible for me to get it.”</p>
<p>“That’s got to be the stupidest thing in the history of mankind,” Lindell said of the pet blankets. “Why would I make them?”</p>
<p>Reminded “that’s what you said about pet beds,” which Lindell <i>does</i> sell, and told that there’s a market for pet blankets, he relented. “Get it, get it, get ‘em. … Go, go, go, go, go.”</p>
<i>not</i> happen, and that if it doesn’t, the fallout might be too much for Lindell.
<p>Lindell, she said, is up against “the tweeters and the Facebook people,” who she said have “so much power.” </p>
<p>“He’s done so well, I worry that he’ll lose everything,” Lenzen said. “He just has all the faith in God that God’s going to help him get all this stuff. But sometimes, God says ‘No.’”</p>
<p>If you understand Mike Lindell’s biography, however, it’s not clear what, if anything, will make him stop.</p>
<b>Before Lindell was ever talking</b>
<p>Lindell thought: “This sounds like my kind of place.”</p>
<p>“I began to feel invincible,” Lindell wrote.</p>
<i>selling alcohol</i>, if you know what I mean. I was selling fun. Family.
<p>Lindell added, “Maybe that was because, beginning in childhood, I never felt like I belonged.”</p>
<p>He recalled Lindell going “on benders for days, not just hours, days,” he said, a memory that squares with Lindell’s own memoir. At the time, Johnson said his expectation for Lindell was that “we’d end up finding him dead.”</p>
<p>“He’s a hyper guy,” Johnson said. “But he loves people.”</p>
<p>Johnson isn’t convinced, as Lindell is, that Trump will be reinstated. But he said, “I like what he’s doing. He ain’t going to back down, either.”</p>
<p>Sitting nearby, a man ordered two Jacks and Coke and said Johnson was probably right. But he felt like he’d seen this already—in Lindell’s two failed marriages, in a career that, before MyPillow took off, was always up and down.</p>
<p>“He always built things up and lost,” he said.</p>
<b>Nearly 20 years since Lindell sold the bar,</b>
<i>really</i> live in an America where 7 million more people picked Joe Biden.
<p>One difference today, Lindell said, is “the community’s a lot bigger. A lot bigger.”</p>
<p>Like Trump, Lindell was banned from Twitter for spreading election disinformation. Then came the Dominion lawsuit and the flight of retailers like Kohl’s and Bed Bath Beyond.</p>
<i>not</i> to play it, it might be Lindell.
<p>Carlson said, “He became a personality when he was advertising MyPillow, then evolved into this caricature.” Lindell, he sighed: “One of the great intellects of our time.”</p>
<b>One feature of conspiracy theories,</b>
<p>“It’s kind of batshit crazy,” said Mike Webb, a coffee shop owner in Chaska and former mayor of Carver.</p>
<p>“The guy is so out there, and he’s so narcissistic that everything he says is about him,” Webb said. “So, he follows his own meandering river in whatever he wants to do and expects everyone to follow him, and when they don’t, they’re just wrong.”</p>
<p>Dave Pokorney, a former longtime Chaska city administrator, described Lindell as “so random—at one point he’s doing something rational, and then he’s off.” He said he’s “not surprised” that Lindell believes the election was stolen.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised other people believe it,” he said.</p>
<p>For people like Lindell, the belief that Trump didn’t lose is an invitation to replace grief with something more comforting: a sense of purpose.</p>
<p>Madrid said, “You upset that, and you start to become a little unhinged. … I don’t think he’s a bad man. I think he’s a lost man.” In the election conspiracy, he said, “He found something he could hold onto.”</p>
<i>he</i> believes Trump might come back, it just might happen.
<p>He said, “There’s something to be said about that. He’s had a lot of things happen you can’t explain.”</p>
<p>When she hung up, she said that kind of call isn’t uncommon.</p>
<p>She said, “There’s a lot of people calling and saying Mike is a disciple of God.”</p>
<p>Eating popcorn while he leaned against the fence, Roepke said what Lindell is going through now isn’t all that different from when he owned Schmitty’s, the bar where “all heck was breaking loose.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think if you’ve lived on the edge and kind of the extremes, it’s just how he approaches life?” Roepke told me later. “I don’t think he’ll ever say ‘Uncle’.”</p>
<p>Roepke left the board because of his difference of opinion with Lindell about the election, deciding it was “maybe not the healthiest thing for me to continue.”</p>
<p>As for where Lindell’s conspiratorial side came from, he said, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. Lindell had built a life, wrecked it, built it again more grandly and a little chaotically. But this? Roepke said, “It’s off the rails.”</p>

<p>On the last day of 2019, President Donald Trump joined in on New Year’s Eve celebrations at Mar-a-Lago, ringing in 2020 with what was, in retrospect, a terrible prediction about the year ahead. </p>
<p>“We’re going to have a great year, I predict,” the president told assembled guests. “I think it’s going to be a fantastic year.”</p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, it was most certainly <i>not</i> a great year. In fairness, though: Who the hell could have accurately predicted what we experienced in 2020?</p>
<h2>Donald Trump, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will all get Covid — and it’ll kill one of them before Election Day</h2>
<p>Predicted by Scott Adams, March 12</p>
<p>It’s December, the election is over, and all three men are still alive. Though Trump did contract coronavirus before Election Day, after a hospitalization and VIP treatment, he quickly recovered.</p>
<h2>Kanye West will destroy Biden’s chances by siphoning off black support</h2>
<p>Predicted by Gianno Caldwell, July 5</p>
<p>In the end, Yeezy received roughly 68,000 votes for president. Biden received more than 81 million, roughly 7 million more than Trump. Exit polls by Edison Research showed Biden winning the support of 87 percent of Black voters.</p>
<h2>The coronavirus will simply “go away”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Donald Trump … many, many times</p>
<a>March 31</a>: “It’s going to go away, hopefully at the end of the month. And, if not, hopefully it will be soon after that.”
<a>April 3</a>: “It is going to go away… It’s going — I didn’t say a date. … I said ‘it’s going away,’ and it
<a>April 7</a>: “It did go — it will go away.”
<a>May 15</a>: “It’ll go away — at some point, it’ll go away.”
<a>June 15</a>: “At some point, this stuff goes away. And it's going away.”
<a>July 19</a>: “I will be right eventually. You know, I said, ‘It's going to disappear.’ I'll say it again.”
<a>Aug. 5</a>: “This thing's going away. It will go away like things go away.”
<a>Aug. 31</a>: “It's going to go away.”
<i>is </i>going away. And it's probably going to go away now a lot faster because of the vaccines.”
<a>Oct. 10</a>: “It's going to disappear; it
<a>Oct. 24</a>: “It is going away; it’s rounding the turn.”
<h2>We’ll know who won the presidency by 10 on election night</h2>
<p>Predicted by James Carville, Nov. 2</p>
<a>told MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell</a> on November 2. “What people are doing is just unnecessarily scaring people and making them nervous.”
<h2>“If he loses, Trump will concede gracefully”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Mick Mulvaney, Nov. 7</p>
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> published an op-ed by former Trump White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney arguing that Trump would “act and speak like a great president should — win or lose,” meaning that he would concede humbly if he lost.
<h2>Trump is going to dump Pence and run with Nikki Haley</h2>
<p>Predicted by Paul Begala, many times</p>
<a>August 20</a>. “It is gonna happen this week. 100%,” he tweeted on
<a>Aug. 24</a>. “Trump is about to dump Pence for Nikki Haley,” he tweeted
<a>on Aug. 25</a>. Then, with a note of self-deprecation, after Pence accepted the VP nomination
<a>on August 26</a>: “The only reason Trump didn’t do the politically smart thing and replace Pence with Nikki Haley is because I smoked Trump out and backed him down.”
<h2>Covid-19 will kill roughly 500 — make that 5,000 — Americans, tops</h2>
<p>Predicted by Richard Epstein, March 16 and March 23</p>
<a>many of whom began circulating</a> his numbers as a sign that coronavirus panic was overblown. But there was a problem with his numbers, as Epstein noted in
<a>updates a few days later</a>: his estimate of 500 dead was 10 times too small; the more accurate projection was 5,000 dead Americans at most.
<p>As of late-December, more than 333,000 Americans have died from Covid-19.</p>
<h2>If the Senate acquits Trump in his impeachment trial, he’ll invite Putin to the White House in 2020</h2>
<p>Predicted by Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), Dec. 20, 2019</p>
<h2>A clear successor to Nancy Pelosi will emerge in 2020 — and it’ll be Cheri Bustos</h2>
<p>Predicted by <span><i>Fortune Magazine</i></span>, Dec. 2019</p>
<i>Fortune </i>wrote in its annual “crystal ball” prediction feature. “Our money is on campaign committee chairwoman Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.).”
<h2>2020 will be a “low-turnout election”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Jesse Watters, Aug. 20</p>
<p>In fact, 2020 had the highest voter turnout in 120 years, with two-thirds of eligible voters casting ballots.</p>
<h2>The “most pessimistic” outcome for House Dems in 2020: Picking up at least 10 GOP seats</h2>
<p>Predicted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Aug. 20</p>
<p>Not a single House Republican up in November lost reelection, and Democrats ended up with a net <i>loss </i>of at least 10 seats. </p>
<h2>Biden’s South Carolina primary victory is “not the win [he] needed,” and Bernie will dominate Super Tuesday</h2>
<p>Predicted by Hugh Hewitt, March 1</p>
<i>Washington Post</i> column on March 1. “Super Tuesday is likely to put Sanders clearly back on top with many wins, including a thumping big blowout in California.”
<p>In reality, South Carolina proved a decisive turning point in Biden’s campaign — it was exactly the win he needed — and he won 10 states on Super Tuesday, catapulting him into a delegate lead that Sanders was never able to come back from. </p>
<h2>Susan Collins is “toast”</h2>
<p>Predicted by BD Holly (among many others), Sept. 15</p>
<p>It was a Senate race that most everyone had written off — after all, polls showed Susan Collins was the most unpopular senator in the country, with a 52 percent disapproval. Her Democratic opponent, Sara Gideon, led in every public poll in 2020.</p>
<p>Collins won by 9 points.</p>
<h2>“There isn’t a coronavirus ‘second wave’”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Vice President Mike Pence, June 16</p>
<i>Times </i>published Mitt Romney’s “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt.” But when the
<p>Since Pence’s op-ed published, there have been at least two major waves of coronavirus infections in the U.S., and the one we’re currently in is the deadliest yet.</p>
<h2>By the end of April, there will be “close to zero” new coronavirus cases in the U.S.</h2>
<p>Predicted by Elon Musk, March 19</p>
<h2>There will be a contested Democratic convention</h2>
<p>Predicted by Karl Rove, Dec. 31, 2019</p>
<i>Wall Street Journal</i> column on Dec. 31, 2019. “The nomination requires delegates switching sides after the initial first vote or a second ballot where superdelegates are permitted to participate.”
<p>In reality, Joe Biden had a clear outright majority of delegates, and, because of the pandemic, there was barely a convention at all, let alone one that was contested.</p>
<h2>Lindsey Graham will lose reelection</h2>
<p>Predicted by Adam Parkhomenko (among others), Oct. 14</p>
<p>A few weeks before Election Day, Parkhomenko, a Democratic strategist with a massive following on #Resistance Twitter, tweeted that “Lindsey Graham is going to lose to Jaime Harrison and it’s going to make my shitty year.”</p>
<h2>Trump will keep the coronavirus from coming to the U.S.</h2>
<p>Predicted by Kayleigh McEnany, Feb. 25</p>
<p>Coronavirus, of course, did come to the U.S. In fact, we now know that Covid-19 had already been here for at least a month prior to McEnany’s statement.</p>
<h2>Trump’s impeachment will be so unpopular that the Dems will lose the House</h2>
<p>Predicted by Jeanine Pirro, Feb. 5</p>
<p>“This impeachment will inure to the detriment of the Democrats and I envision — and, you know, I hope I’m right — a House that is Republican,” Jeanine Pirro said on Fox News shortly after the Senate acquitted Trump on Feb. 5.</p>
<p>Astonishingly enough, by November, the impeachment of the president barely registered as a campaign issue.</p>
<h2>Unemployment numbers for June are “going to be absolutely terrible”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Rachel Maddow, July 1</p>
<p>“They’re going to come out tomorrow. That will tell us unemployment figures for June,” Maddow told her loyal MSNBC viewers on July 1. “Brace yourself, it is going to be absolutely terrible, but we should have those as of tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>What they actually revealed was a surprise: The largest single-month job growth in U.S. history — 4.8 million new jobs — and an unemployment rate that dropped from 13.3 percent to 11.1.</p>
<h2>If Biden wins, Dems will immediately end coronavirus lockdowns</h2>
<p>Predicted by Sen. Ted Cruz, July 22</p>
<p>Biden did win in November, coronavirus cases are rapidly increasing in number, and far from lifting lockdowns, many Democratic leaders are reimposing them.</p>
<h2>Trump will win 98 percent of early votes</h2>
<p>Predicted by Greg Locke, Nov. 2</p>
<p>While it is not easy to know the precise percentage of early votes Trump won, it is a mathematical impossibility that he won 98 percent of them: There were 101 million early votes cast, but Trump received just over 74 million votes total.</p>
<h2>Between 5 and 10 Senate Republicans will vote to hear witnesses in Trump’s impeachment trial</h2>
<p>Predicted by Sen. Angus King, Jan. 27</p>
<p>As the prospect of testimony by John Bolton dangled over the Senate, NPR asked Maine Sen. Angus King whether enough Republicans — Dems needed four to join them — would vote to compel testimony. “My bold prediction will be five or 10,” King said.</p>
<p>Ultimately, only two did (Susan Collins and Mitt Romney), and the Senate did not hear from any witnesses during the impeachment trial.</p>
<h2>“We’re not going to see an effective [coronavirus] vaccine proven safe until well into 2021, if then”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Dr. Irwin Redlener (among others), May 15</p>
<p>Even so, that record was smashed in December, when the FDA approved the first of several coronavirus vaccines in development after it passed its rigorous safety standards.</p>
<h2>Biden’s vote in favor of the Iraq War will prevent him from defeating Trump</h2>
<p>Predicted by Sen. Bernie Sanders, March 6</p>
<p>“We will not defeat Trump with a candidate like Joe Biden who supported and voted for the Iraq War alongside Republicans,” Sanders tweeted on March 6.</p>
<p>Eight months and one day later, Joe Biden was president-elect of the United States.</p>
<h2>Trump will win reelection with 362 Electoral Votes</h2>
<p>Predicted by Helmut Norpoth, March 2</p>
<h2>Trump will no-show the debates with Biden</h2>
<p>Predicted by Amy Siskind (among others), Aug. 4 and Aug. 5 </p>
<h2>“The DNC will find an excuse to make sure Biden doesn’t have to debate Trump”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Kristin B. Tate (among others), June 12</p>
<h2>Coronavirus will go away “with the heat” of summer/sunlight can “kill it”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Donald Trump, Feb. 10 and Apr. 23</p>
<p>It was not so. Countries in warm-weather climates had severe Covid outbreaks, and the U.S. experienced a surge of cases over the summer.</p>
<h2>“Joe Biden will lose a general election to Donald Trump”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Carl Beijer, Dec. 21, 2019</p>
<p><i>Jacobin</i> was wrong about this.</p>
<h2>Trump is going to have a massive overflow crowd for his Tulsa rally</h2>
<p>Predicted by Brad Parscale, June 19</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Tulsa Fire Department estimated only 6,200 people showed up, and the use of the outdoor stage was scrapped due to the lack of demand.</p>
<h2>Bernie will be the Dem nominee, the GOP will retake the House and 2020 “will be a great year”</h2>
<p>Predicted by Scott Walker<span>, Jan. 2</span></p>

<a>before</a>, but we’ve never had quite the fodder that we did this year. In the 2016 presidential race,
<a>one</a> presumed front-runner after
<a>another</a> fell to the bottom of the polls; a reality TV star
<a>is currently as admired</a> as the pope; and a
<a>eurosurgeon</a> gained massive followings. In Washington, a man who
<a>once wanted</a> to give his “undivided attention” to the Ways and Means Committee
<b> </b>now speaker of the House; and a president about to enter his final year and facing a hostile Congress reached deals on
<a>Iran’s</a> nuclear program and
<a>international trade</a>. Of course, we can’t blame political pundits for being wrong in a year so full of surprises; but that won’t stop us from having some fun calling them out. Herewith, the political predictions gone wrong in 2015.
<p><b>Meerkat will change politics forever.</b></p>
<p><a><i>Lance Ulanoff</i></a><i> of Mashable, as quoted on Fox News, March 25, 2015: “This [Meerkat] is here to stay.” </i></p>

<p>In the end, Warren stayed true to her denials, opting to remain in the Senate instead of running for president. The <a>movement</a> encouraging her to run eventually suspended its campaign. </p>
<p><b>Mitt Romney will run for president again (and will win).</b></p>

<a>reported</a> that Romney was indeed running—but
<a>within hours</a> the real reason for the donor call had been reported: Romney was not launching another campaign.
<p>(Others rumored to be running included Ohio Senator Rob Portman, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan. Needless to say, none of them did.)</p>

<i>Washington Post, February 26, 2015: “So, let’s assume—gulp—that Trump is serious this time around. Heck, while we're at it, let's assume he actually runs. IT. DOESN'T. MATTER. I can't emphasize that strongly enough.” </i>
<a>until April</a>—way later than for any other top GOP candidate.) And yet, Trump announced his presidential bid in June, rose to first place in the Republican polls, and has held that place ever since.
<p><b>Trump is done for.</b></p>
<p><a><i>Senator Lindsey Graham</i></a><i>, CNN, July 20, 2015: “The American people will not tolerate what he is doing now regarding those who have served. This is a line he has crossed. This is the beginning of the end of Donald Trump.”</i></p>

<b> </b>Obama’s supposed heir apparent and the pollsters’ far and away favorite, Hillary Clinton, in the presidential race.
<a>compiled</a> a list of the worst political predictions, including those made within our own ranks, since 2013, and we’re not stopping now. So, without further ado, here are some of the political projections gone terribly wrong in 2016.
<p><b>Hillary Clinton will be elected president</b></p>
<a><i>Washington Post</i></a>’s Greg Sargent called it “a fantasy.” In July,
<a>Moody’s Analytics</a> suggested that the electoral outcome was a done deal—Clinton would win easily. In August, one of
<a>The POLITICO Caucus</a>’s GOP insiders declared that for Trump to win, “it would take video evidence of a smiling Hillary drowning a litter of puppies while terrorists surrounded her with chants of ‘Death to America.’” In September, on
<a>With All Due Respect</a>, 2008 Obama campaign manager David Plouffe broke down why he believed Hillary Clinton had a 100 percent chance of winning. In October, the editor-in-chief of
<a>Jim Nelson</a>, penned an essay titled, “Let's Face It, Donald Trump Is About to Lose.” And the day before the election,
<a>Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a> prophesied 322 electoral votes for Clinton and 216 for Trump.
<a>Jimmy Kimmel</a>’s late-night show—after reading a tweet from Trump that stated, “President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!”—confidently joked, “At least I will go down as president.”
<p>Even Trump has admitted that, on the morning of November 8, he didn’t think he was going to win. </p>
<a>Princeton Election Consortium</a> gave Clinton a 99 percent chance of winning. The
<a>Huffington Post</a>’s forecast gave Clinton 98 percent,
<a>PredictWise</a> gave her 89 percent, and the
<a>The Upshot</a> gave her 85 percent. Even
<a>FiveThirtyEight</a>, which was the most bullish on Trump, gave Clinton over a 71 percent chance of winning.
<p>All of this, of course, gave us the most shocking election night in recent memory.</p>
<p><b>Trump won’t be the Republican nominee</b></p>
<i><a>Dana Milbank</a> in the Washington Post,</i>
<i>October 2, 2015: “I’m so certain Trump won’t win the nomination that I’ll eat my words if he does. Literally: The day Trump clinches the nomination I will eat the page on which this column is printed in Sunday’s Post.” </i>
<a>Marco Rubio</a>. Almost every week brought a new proclamation that Trump had peaked and his
<a>demise</a> was soon to come. At a town hall in New Hampshire, Bush said he could “
<a>guarantee</a>” that Trump would not be the nominee.
<i>Weekly Standard</i> editor Bill Kristol said on
<i><a>Morning Joe</a></i> in December 2015, “but I have enough faith in the Republican primary electorate that they will select a talented politician over a talented demagogue.”
<p>(In May, Milbank came through on his promise in what may have been <a>the least humble way</a> possible: He sought the assistance of readers, acclaimed chefs and food critics to make swallowing literal newsprint the most enjoyable it could be.)</p>
<p><b>There will be a viable independent or third-party candidate</b></p>
<a>salivating</a>” over the possibility of Michael Bloomberg entering the race. A pollster even published an op-ed in the
<i>National Review</i>. But none of the alternatives panned out. Nor did Gary Johnson, the libertarian candidate who at one point
<p><b>The Republican National Convention will be contested</b></p>
<p><i><a>John Kasich</a> on Face the Nation, March 20, 2016: “Nobody's going to have the delegates they need going to the convention. Everyone will fall short.” </i></p>
<a>Rush Limbaugh</a> told his radio audience that he was certain the former president’s brother would be bequeathed the party’s nomination in Ohio (and if not Jeb, then Romney would get it). And in April, a whopping 90 percent of
<a>The POLITICO Caucus</a>’ panel of Republican insiders was confident that the convention would be contested.
<p><b>Women will form a firewall for Clinton against Trump</b></p>
<p><i>Washington Post’s <a>The Daily 202</a>, November 3, 2016: “College-educated white women are Hillary Clinton’s firewall.”</i></p>
<i>Washington Post</i> article titled “
<a>Donald Trump is facing an apocalyptic election scenario, thanks to women voters</a>.”
<p>In the end, Trump won a majority of white female voters and lost the overall female vote by about the same margin as Romney lost to Obama in 2012.</p>
<p><b>Red states will go blue</b></p>
<a>five to seven Senate seats</a>, and Clinton would likely turn at least
<a>a couple of red states blue</a> in the presidential race. At one point this summer, there was even speculation that states as deep red as
<p>In the end, Trump flipped six states that Obama had won (Clinton flipped none); McGinty and Feingold were both defeated (Democrats picked up only two seats nationwide); and the Republicans retained their majorities in both the Senate and the House.</p>
<p><b>Hillary Clinton will defeat Bernie Sanders in the Michigan Democratic primary in a landslide</b></p>
<p><i><a>FiveThirtyEight</a>, March 7, 2016: “Hillary Clinton has a greater than 99% chance of winning the Michigan primary.”</i></p>
<p><b>Merrick Garland will be confirmed for the Supreme Court</b></p>
<p><i><a>Harry Reid</a>, March 17, 2016: “I'm confident he is going to get approval.” </i></p>
<b> </b>Merrick Garland. But Republicans in the Senate controversially vowed to hold off on even giving Garland a hearing until a new president took office in January 2017. The more likely it looked that Clinton was going to defeat Trump, the more
<p><b>The United Kingdom won’t vote to leave the European Union</b></p>
<i><a>Matthew Shaddick</a> to International Business Times, June 17, 2016: “‘Leave’ needs to be well ahead at this stage in order to have any chance of winning, unless they can convince voters that staying in the EU is riskier than leaving.</i>
<i>That’s not going to be an easy sell when most of the nation’s political parties and representatives of big business are mostly saying the opposite.” </i>
<b> </b>When asked about the Brexit referendum just a few days out, Shaddick, the head of politics trading at a London-based betting firm, suggested to the
<i>IB Times</i> that British voters would opt to remain in the EU because there is a tendency among the undecided to favor the status quo, which he described as “the least risky option.”
<p>After the Brexit results—“leave” won 51.9 percent to 48.1 percent—there were those who <a>tried to caution</a> the pundit class not to discount possibilities outside the bounds of “normal” political opinion, or even political data. </p>
<p>Well, we all know how that went.</p>

<p>A year ago at this time, the world was falling apart. That, or on the verge of being saved. Or maybe something in between; it depended on whom you asked.</p>
<b> </b>the defeat of Hillary Clinton, the World Series victory of the Chicago Cubs, and so on.
<p>Of course, predictions are ever thus—guess at the outcome of something, and you’re bound to be wrong a decent amount of the time. And boy, did people get all sorts of things wrong this year.</p>
<p>So as 2017 gets put to bed and dreams for the new year dance in our heads, it’s worth pausing to reflect on the gulf between where we are now and where some people thought we’d be.</p>
<p>Here, a review of some of the worst prognosticators and predictions about 2017:</p>
<p><b>Prediction: ‘Trump will resign by year end’</b>Made by: Tony Schwartz</p>
<a>Schwartz tweeted</a>, not just a prediction, but a prayer; lucky for Trump, it remains unanswered.
<p><b>Prediction: ‘Will North Korea successfully test a nuclear-capable missile [in 2017]? No.’</b>Made by: Bryan Harris</p>
<p>It was a reasonable stance, but one the Kim regime has thoroughly rejected.</p>
<a>has launched</a> at least 16 tests and fired 23 missiles, including its first test of an (unarmed) intercontinental ballistic missile. Of course, Trump himself made the same prediction as the
<a>tweeting</a> on Jan. 2: “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won’t happen!”
<p><b>Prediction: Jared Kushner will be a moderating influence on President Trump</b>Made by: Rick Reed (among many, many others)</p>
<a>told <i>New York</i> magazine</a> in January, sharing a view widely held among the chattering class. “I think Jared will play that role.”
<p>In reality, Kushner has repeatedly steered Trump’s administration into perilous waters—including <a>advocating</a> the firing of FBI Director James Comey and <a>reportedly</a> urging Michael Flynn to contact Russia during the transition.</p>
<p><b>Prediction: ‘Trump will make infrastructure a high priority because it will give him a speedy bipartisan win’</b>Made by: Tory Newmyer and Geoff Colvin </p>
<a>“Crystal Ball” collection</a> from
<p><b>Prediction: Ed Gillespie will beat Ralph Northam, thanks to Corey Stewart’s voters</b>Made by: Steve Bannon</p>
<p>“I do believe that Gillespie’s going to pull this thing out,” <a>Bannon said</a>, and “it will be because of the underlying message of Corey Stewart and what he believes in, and the Trump voters in Virginia, who are gonna turn out!”</p>
<a>some observers attributed</a> to the ads Gillespie ran in the closing months—which had a Bannon-esque focus on crime by undocumented immigrants and a Stewart-ian defense of Confederate monuments.
<p><b>Prediction: ‘Trump is headed for a do-nothing presidency’</b>Made by: Josh Barro</p>
<p>In April, Business Insider senior editor Josh Barro unveiled a litany of predictions about the Trump presidency, a majority of which turned out to be incorrect.</p>
<a>negotiation talks</a> are ongoing—characterized by “acrimony, inflexibility and finger-pointing,” in the words of
<p>Barro’s suggestion highlights a messaging problem for those opposed to Trump: You can argue that he’s dangerous and wrong for the country, and you can argue that he’s ineffective; but if you argue both, the latter effectively neuters the former.</p>
<p><b>Prediction: ‘In six months, Trump will be holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy’</b>Made by: John Aravosis</p>
<a>Aravosis tweeted</a>. “I predict in 6 months Trump will be holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy.”
<a>exactly six months</a> after Aravosis made that prediction, Trump woke up at his manse in Bedminster, New Jersey, and went to the White House for a few meetings before departing to spend the evening holed up at his beloved Trump Tower in Manhattan.
<p><b>Prediction: With Scaramucci reporting to Trump, chief of staff John Kelly will be gone by January 1</b>Made by: John Podhoretz</p>
<i>Commentary</i> and a conservative columnist for the
<i>New York Post</i>, to suggest that the arrangement would work to The Mooch’s advantage. “Kelly gone by Jan 1,”
<a>Podhoretz tweeted</a> on July 28.
<i>New Yorker</i> reporter Ryan Lizza. Kelly, meanwhile, remains firmly in place at the White House; somehow, The Mooch is writing a memoir about his fleeting White House tenure.
<p><b>Prediction: Mitch McConnell will make it into 2018 without passing a tax bill</b>Made by: Laura Ingraham</p>
<a>Laura Ingraham suggested</a> that the Senate majority leader wasn’t up to the job when it came time to marshal support for a tax cut: “Prediction: The ‘sage of the Senate’ Mitch McConnell will get to 2018 and still not be able to pass a tax bill.”
<p>Shortly before 1 a.m. on Wednesday, December 20, McConnell did exactly that, and the Republican tax plan passed the Senate, 51-48.</p>
<p><b>Prediction: The House will pass AHCA (in March), ‘and pundits will fawn over Trump’</b>Made by: Peter Daou</p>
<a>Peter Daou took to Twitter</a>: “PREDICTION: #AHCA will pass the House and pundits will fawn over Trump for his big ‘win.’”
<a>blame was heaped on Trump</a> for his lack of legislative savvy. For his part, Daou later
<a>tweeted</a> that he was “happy to be wrong about this prediction, at least for today.” The House did, however, make another run at repealing Obamacare and passed a bill on May 4. It died in the Senate.
<p><b>Prediction: ‘Trump will throw Roy Moore under the bus’ following sexual assault allegations</b>Made by: Bill Kristol</p>
<i>Washington Post</i> published a
<a>blockbuster report</a> alleging that in 1979, Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Alabama’s special election, initiated a sexual encounter with a 14-year-old girl when he was 32. The
<i>Post</i>’s story eased the way for several other women to come forward with their own allegations about Moore’s inappropriate sexual behavior toward them as teens.
<p><b>Prediction: Trump’s inauguration will have a ‘record-setting’ attendance with ‘plenty’ of movie stars</b>Made by: Donald J. Trump</p>
<a>told the <i>New York Times</i></a> that he expected that his inauguration 11 days later would have strong support from celebrities.
<a>told <i>People</i></a> magazine), the turnout for his inauguration was estimated to be
<p><b>Prediction: Mueller’s probe will be ‘narrow’ and will likely be done by the end of 2017</b>Predicted by: Ty Cobb</p>
<a>Ty Cobb told Reuters</a> that the entire ordeal would soon come to a close.
<p>“I’d be embarrassed if this is still haunting the White House by Thanksgiving and worse if it’s still haunting him by year end,” Cobb said. “I think the relevant areas of inquiry by the special counsel are narrow.”</p>
<a>obtained</a> the Trump team’s emails from the transition, and that the special counsel’s staff expects to be working well into 2018—all of which is to say that Cobb was badly wrong about both the timeline of the investigation and also its heaving scale.
<p><b>Prediction: Ivanka Trump will pull Trump to the left on climate change, LGBT rights and immigration</b>Made by: Gayle King (among others)</p>
<p><b>Prediction: By September, ‘it’s going to be super-awkward to be anti-Trump’</b>Made by: Scott Adams</p>
<a>wants you to know</a> he’s a “trained hypnotist,” suggested that he expected Trump’s fortunes to change by summer’s end—and for the American people’s opinion of Trump to change along with it.
<p>“It’s going to be super-awkward to be anti-Trump in six months,” he tweeted. <a>At the time</a>, Trump’s approval rating was roughly 44 percent, with 50 percent of Americans disapproving.</p>
<p><b>Prediction: Trump will end 2017 with an approval rating above 60 percent</b>Made by: SE Cupp</p>
<a>SE Cupp predicted</a> Trump would end the year with.
<p>Technically, there’s still time for Trump to win over one-fourth of the public and bring up his approval rating, but barring some Lazarus-scale resurrection in the next few days, it isn’t going to happen.</p>
<p><b>Prediction: White House aides will keep Trump from tweeting</b>Made by: Ari Fleischer</p>
<p><b>Prediction: Al Franken could be a formidable 2020 candidate</b>Made by: Chris Cillizza (among others)</p>
<i>sui generis </i>figure in Minnesota Senator (and
<i>Washington Post</i> politics blog piece. “Who better to run against someone like [Trump] than a stand-up comedian who made a living needling people?”
