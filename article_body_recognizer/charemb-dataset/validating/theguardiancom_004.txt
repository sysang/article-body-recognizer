<li><p>Caravan parks and camping grounds can operate.</p></li>
<li><p>Carpooling is permitted. Quarantine settings for vaccinated arrivals will be altered. A cap on unvaccinated travellers may remain.</p></li>
<ul> <li><p>Mask-wearing will be mandatory while travelling on public transport, on planes and at airports, and for front-of-house hospitality workers.</p></li> <li><p>Mask wearing is not required when outdoors.</p></li> </ul>
<h2>What about unvaccinated people in NSW?</h2>
<p>Unvaccinated residents will still be under stay-at-home orders and excluded from the above settings until 15 December, or when the state reaches 95% double-dose vaccination coverage – whichever occurs first.</p>
<h2>Will overseas travel and quarantine change?</h2>

<p>The proportion of prisoners developing a drug problem in custody has more than doubled in the past five years, research suggests.</p>
<p>The analysis of survey data from HM Inspectorate of Prisons by the thinktank Reform found that the proportion of inmates who reported developing a drug problem in prison rose 8.4 percentage points to almost 15% between 2013-14 and 2018-19.</p>
<p>The study found that much of the estate was not equipped to disrupt the drug supply and that security standards varied from prison to prison.</p>
<p><a>Last year</a> the then prisons minster, Rory Stewart, said the prisons system had been unprepared for the arrival of new psychoactive drugs such as spice and had been playing catch-up ever since.</p>
<a>smuggled into prisons</a> after being sprayed on children’s drawings and letters.
<p>Aidan Shilson-Thomas, a Reform researcher and the author of the report, said: “There must always be a place in prison for those who commit serious crimes. However, prison must also be an opportunity for inmates to change their behaviour.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: “Illicit substances pose huge challenges in our prisons which is why we are investing £100m in airport-style security – including x-ray body scanners – to stop them getting in.</p>
<p>A separate report has said it will put vulnerable young women at further risk of threat further violence, abuse and exploitation.</p>
<p>The government wants to put a statutory duty on public agencies, such as healthcare and education providers, to reduce and prevent serious violence by disclosing information on service users.</p>
<p>In the letter to <a>Priti Patel</a>, to be sent on Monday, signatories say they are “appalled” by the proposals, which they believe “directly conflict with our duties and will actively put people we work with in harm’s way”.</p>
<p>“Most importantly, it will expand the criminalisation, surveillance, and punishment of already overpoliced communities.”</p>
<p>Niya, a young woman who was charged with assaulting a police officer when she was 18, said she was suicidal and in a forced marriage. </p>
<p>Her family beat her then called the police when she said she wanted to leave the marriage, she said. Surrounded by officers who told her she would be arrested, she panicked and kicked an officer.</p>
<p>“I think I would have reacted differently if they had backed off, but because they were crowding over me and not giving me any space, after going through what I just did, it was too much at that time,” she said.</p>
<p>A petition opposing the bill’s proposals has been signed by almost 600,000 people, while more than 30,000 people have written directly to the prime minister to object.</p>
<p>Charities have described as "scandalous" the annual plight of an estimated 6,000 "forgotten children" whose whereabouts are not tracked by the authorities after their mothers have been jailed.</p>
<p>In many cases the families are known to social services, which will step in, he said. However, in other cases "no one knows where [these children] are".</p>
<p>Pact is running a project to support kinship carers, which is funded by the City of London Corporation's City Bridge Trust. Clare Thomas, chief grants officer at the trust, described the work as "ground-breaking".</p>
<p>"It is about reaching into corners where there is no statutory money or causes that are underfunded. The Pact project is uniquely looking at the safeguarding of these children – it is doing something that no one else is."</p>
<p>Thomas recently came across a female prisoner who had left her child in the care of a friend. "That friend was 16," she said.</p>
<p>Experts have warned that more babies could die in prison owing to the government’s expansion of female prison places and ministers’ refusal to grant multiple requests to end the incarceration of pregnant women.</p>
<p>The report says Ms A’s cell was checked as part of a routine roll count twice during the night but neither of the officers who did the check said they noticed anything untoward.</p>
<a>expanding</a> the number of prison cells for women by 500. Many who are imprisoned have convictions linked to poverty, lack of education, poor mental health, past trauma, or have been a victim of violence.
<p>According to <a>research by Coventry University to be published in October</a>, eleven countries do not imprison pregnant women, or severely restrict their incarceration. These include Russia, Ukraine and Brazil.</p>
<p>A recommendation in the PPO report to provide specialist neo-natal medical equipment at the prison was rejected.</p>
<p>“It’s not safe to have pregnant women in prison, we are just treated like a number,” she said. “I can’t grieve for my baby yet because there are still things I don’t know, like why an ambulance wasn’t called.</p>
<p>“I want to get justice for Brooke and I decided to go public in the hope that things will change and pregnant women will stop being imprisoned.”</p>
<p>She said: “Pregnant women would be better safeguarded and more effectively rehabilitated in a secure community mother and baby unit that taught parenting skills and helped break generational cycles of incarceration.”</p>
<p>Laura Abbott, a senior lecturer in midwifery at the University of Hertfordshire, said that the poor care received by Ms A was “not an isolated case”.</p>
<p>“What’s really alarmed me is that these are pregnant women calling for help and not getting the help they need,” she said. “If women are locked in and can’t get the help they need they’re never going to be safe in prison.”</p>
<p>She said Ms A’s case highlighted a tendency for women in prison to be “blamed” for not engaging with antenatal care – and for their attempts to seek help to be ignored. “I find it hard to even imagine what she went through,” Abbott said.</p>

<p>What were you hoping for?A fun night with somebody interesting in a great restaurant.</p>
<p>First impressions?Friendly, chatty person with a stunning face and a passion for cocktails.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?After a briefly shy start, conversation flowed.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Other than the occasional spitting of food, excellent.</p>
<p>Best thing about Sofia?Very friendly and easy to talk to.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?I think she would get along with anybody, so yeah, why not.</p>
<p>Describe Sofia in three wordsOutgoing, passionate and fun.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Standard Spanish guy wearing skinny jeans, into my politics and a bit opinionated – but hopefully she saw that I know how to have fun, even if I do live in Windsor.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?We walked around Soho, but didn’t find anything open that had music, so called it a night.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for social distancing, would you have kissed?That, I guess, I cannot answer.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?To have had the photo session after the date. I would have been much more sassy.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?9. I had a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?We both boasted about our house parties, so maybe one day we’ll invite each other.</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?A fun date and/or a good story.</p>
<p>First impressions?He was a little nervous at the start.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?Explaining to the host why I was at the restaurant.</p>
<p>Best thing about Esteban?His seven siblings.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?Sure.</p>
<p>Describe Esteban in three wordsChatty, engaging, smart.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?That I enjoy Mexican-themed cocktails.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?We wandered around, gravitating towards bars playing music, but to no avail.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for social distancing, would you have kissed?Yes.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Actually, nothing. Esteban was great, the food was delicious, just the spark that was missing.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?I don’t think so.</p>
<p> Sofia and Esteban ate at <a>El Pastor, Soho</a>, London W1.</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?To be honest, I had wanted to go to the restaurant for a while, so at the very least, great food. Also, a nice evening with good conversation.</p>
<p>First impressions?Izzy was lovely and down to earth, confident but not overpowering, and easy to talk to. I was a bit nervous but she made me feel at ease, or maybe it was the wine? </p>
<p>What did you talk about?Travel, our work and the travesty that is online dating. We also discussed the heavy topics you should avoid on a first date: sexuality, religion, politics.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?We both didn’t really know a thing about wine and ended up with the sweetest white I have ever tasted. Then had the cote de boeuf.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Hers were impeccable, I had an issue when my oyster wouldn’t detach and I had to attack it with a knife.</p>
<p>Best thing about Izzy?She gave the impression she really knew who she was as a person. No false pretence, no hidden agenda. </p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?She could definitely handle them!</p>
<p>Describe Izzy in three wordsCharismatic, warm, down to earth.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Travel snob! I was quite honest: it needs to be a hotel or I’m not going.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?We were last out and it was a Monday night, so taxis home in the rain it was.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for social distancing, would you have kissed?Who knows, if circumstances had been different…</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Weather, and the day of the week. </p>
<p>Would you meet again?I’d say yes!</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?I was excited about being able to get a bit dressed up and hoping for good food, tipsiness and flirtatiousness.</p>
<p>First impressions?I liked that Hal had worn a shirt.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Travel, food, alcohol, faith.</p>
<p>Best thing about Hal?Lovely blue eyes.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?I’m not sure how well they would get along. </p>
<p>Describe Hal in three wordsFriendly, conservative and kind.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?I guess ordering oysters on a first date is a bit of a bold choice, so I’m not sure what he made of that. The conversation flowed well, so I’d like to think he found me friendly.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?It would have been a bit of a late one for a Monday to go anywhere else.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for social distancing, would you have kissed?Probably not.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I would have ordered the magnum instead of just joking about it.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?8. Lovely guy, but unfortunately no chemistry on my side.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Not romantically.</p>
<div> <div> <h3><a> Blind date: ‘I had to attack my oyster with a knife’ </a></h3> </div> <div> <div>Hal, 28, cyber security manager, meets Izzy, 28, trainee clinical psychologist</div> </div> </div> Blind date: ‘I had to attack my oyster with a knife’
<p>What were you hoping for? Sexual tension.</p>
<p>First impressions? Who’s wearing more silver? I must win.</p>
<p>What did you talk about? I think we covered it all: The Twits, nits and taxidermy were the most memorable topics.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments? I did personally feel one brewing, but when that happens I chat over it and point out something I can see, eg: “The wisteria is fake.”</p>
<p>Good table manners? I told her I wouldn’t look at her while she ate, because nobody needs that pressure, so for all I know she could have had her cutlery in the wrong hands…</p>
<p>Best thing about Lucy?She’s unapologetically herself and had the audacity to skip around with that homemade Prada handbag. Yes, Lucy!</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?If the situation arose.</p>
<p>Describe Lucy in three wordsQuietly feisty classic.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?An unusual concoction of a human. Would take to a party.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?The train, but to different destinations.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?To check four times if the pizza was definitely coming instead of just thrice.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?We really did have a great time, but no.</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?To be happily married before the year is out, with several children under my arm.</p>
<p>First impressions?She has great style and can pull off gold and silver jewellery.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Her love of taxidermy; emigrating; Poppy’s two African land snails and my recently acquired pet caterpillar; ankle-length kilts as school uniform. And it wouldn’t be a queer date without trading coming-out stories.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?She asked if my handbag really was Prada. It wasn’t actually awkward, it was quite funny.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Definitely. Poppy very kindly said that she wouldn’t watch me eat, so I felt at ease.</p>
<p>Best thing about Poppy?She knows herself well, in a really refreshing way. She has a reserved confidence and a drive to follow what makes her happy.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?In a heartbeat. She has good chat.</p>
<p>Describe Poppy in three wordsEngaging, driven, eloquent.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?I’d like to think she found me affable and funny, and that she didn’t think I spoke too much.</p>
<p>And… did you kiss?You’re worse than my mother!</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?It would take place in Monaco, I’d order a douzaine huîtres and she’d notice me looking out of place and invite me to join her table.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?A solid 8.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Platonically, yes. She’s great, but I won’t be booking the wedding band quite yet.</p>
<p> Poppy and Lucy ate at <a>The Phoenix, London W12</a></p>
<p>What were you hoping for? A fun evening with someone I may not have otherwise met.</p>
<p>First impressions?So friendly – by the time I got there he was already best mates with the restaurant manager and when we left, multiple waiters came to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?If there were, I was happily oblivious.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Definitely. We were accidentally served three glasses of prosecco on arrival instead of two, and he poured out the third between our glasses very neatly and fairly.</p>
<p>Best thing about Eamon?I think he was being himself the whole time, not putting up a front or showing off (which he wouldn’t need to do, because he’s great).</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?Yes. He seems like the type of person who would get along with anyone.</p>
<p>Describe Eamon in three wordsCaring, hardworking, funny.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?Easily entertained, distracted by singing and birthday sparklers at other tables.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?To a bar around the corner for another drink.</p>
<p>And… did you kiss?We didn’t. I’m too shy to kiss anyone on the first date. Don’t @ me.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I should have asked for sparklers at our table, too.</p>
<p>First impressions?Smiles all round!</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Her superior knowledge of books compared with my limited knowledge of books, music and why south London is better than east.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?Only the guilt of failing to put a dent in the complimentary basket of bread. I felt compelled to have a slice alongside the pizza.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Well, neither of us spilt anything over us, so based on that, I’d say yes.</p>
<p>Best thing about Tandeka?Her nature. I got the impression she was a lot more than merely book smart and was genuinely interested in what you had to say. She’s very disarming and among the most genuine people I’ve met.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Yeah, but whether she’d want to meet them is a different story.</p>
<p>Describe Tandeka in three wordsIntelligent, unpretentious, unassuming.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Good company/an amiable urban gentleman.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?We had one for the road.</p>
<p>And… did you kiss?Not on a school night.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?One more margarita.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?I had a good time and the conversation was for the most part easy, though I don’t think our relationship would move further than that.</p>
<p> Tandeka and Eamon ate at <a>Crazy Pizza</a>, London W1</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?Romance, of course! But at the least, someone who shared my passion for music and fitness. </p>
<p>First impressions?As soon as I sat down, he was very charming and I felt less nervous.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?The English police force, how to plan the best trip to Disney World, and where Nottingham is. He also gave me some Netflix suggestions. </p>
<p>Any awkward moments?We disagreed on whether aliens existed and had ever visited Earth.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Willing to share food – that’s always a good sign, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?We both love festivals, and if <a>Fall Out Boy</a> play at a festival in the UK, I’d happily invite him along.</p>
<p>Describe Ash in three wordsCharming, confident, kind.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?It was quite hard to read him.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?I caught the bus, he went on the tube.</p>
<p>And… did you kiss?I gave him the traditional two kisses on the cheek.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Ordering another plate of melted chocolate brownie.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?8 – no sparks but Ash is a lovely guy.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Not unless he arrests me one day.</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?To meet someone interesting, who feels as awkward as me about having their picture taken on the street.First impressions?Very pleasant and polite, and I liked her rocker look.</p>
<p>Best thing about Cam?She has a great sense of humour and an interesting background.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Yes, I don’t see why not.</p>
<p>Describe Cam in three wordsRelaxed, quirky and inquisitive.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Hopefully, she thought I was nice and interesting.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?No.</p>
<p>And… did you kiss?Only on the cheek, as a goodbye.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Not sitting next to the front door of the restaurant. The door went into my chair a few times.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?8. I had a lovely time.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?We didn’t swap numbers, so probably not.</p>
<p> Cam and Ash ate at<a> Fatt Punditt</a>, London W1</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?A pleasant evening and maybe the beginning of a new friendship or romance.</p>
<p>First impressions?Pretty, intelligent, easy to be with.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Our times at university, living in cold and dirty student houses (truly magical), the purpose of the jury in criminal trials. I worry I may have talked a little too much.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?I did use the expression “man” a lot, as in, “No way, man!” which is strange considering Gen is not a man.</p>
<p>Best thing about Gen?She was totally authentic and genuine, not interested in presenting any sort of image of herself. I think that’s really special.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Of course.</p>
<p>Describe Gen in three wordsNot a man!</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?I hope something loosely along the lines of “not a complete tosser”.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?We didn’t. It was raining and it felt like our evening had reached its natural conclusion.</p>
<p>And… did you kiss?No. I don’t think either of us felt such feelings towards one another, and that’s all right.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Asking the restaurant if they had non-alcoholic cocktails. I don’t drink.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?8. Although I don’t necessarily see any friendship or romance blossoming out of the evening, I think she’s a great woman.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?I’d like to, but I sense we probably won’t. </p>
<p>What were you hoping for?An excuse not to cook dinner.</p>
<p>First impressions?Long hair, short trousers.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?All the classics – university, books, films, the Crusades.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?I was mid-prosecco swig when he told me he didn’t drink.</p>
<p>Best thing about Johnny?His London museum recommendations.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?I think they might eat him alive.</p>
<p>Describe Johnny in three wordsInquisitive, open, polite.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?A vegetarian who knows disappointingly little about art.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?The bus stop.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I would have had a second (or third) cocktail.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Probably not.</p>
<p> Johnny and Gen ate at <a>Le Bab Soho</a>, London W1</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?Ideally, to meet the person I could move to the country and adopt huskies with. But generally, just to have nice chats with someone fun.</p>
<p>First impressions?Beautiful eyes, big smile, super friendly.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Cats, dogs, family, how all our friends are having babies or moving out of London, talented sisters, work, board games, the festival she’s going to, my ukulele group – everything.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?We both managed to inhale our wine. That caused choking, coughing, etc, but also mutual back patting, which was nice. Oh, and a wasp became very interested in me when I was trying to finish my meal.</p>
<p>Good table manners?No complaints at all.</p>
<p>Best thing about Katharyn?Conversation with her is so easy.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Definitely, she could give them a run for their money in a game of Catan.</p>
<p>Describe Katharyn in three wordsFriendly, sweet and fun.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Probably that I talk a bit too much.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?Unfortunately, no – she was off to meet friends for a games night and I’d been invited to a ceilidh, so we went our separate ways.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?A solid 9.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Absolutely, though probably just as mates – we exchanged numbers, so I’m hoping for an invite to one of her games nights.</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?Good food with pleasant company. I love meeting new people and Tom sounded really interesting.</p>
<p>First impressions?I arrived promptly and spotted him loitering outside the venue. I thought he looked friendly and cool.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Spending time with family now lockdown has lifted, ridiculous animal names, cladding, getting to the stage in life where everyone is starting to settle down, how excited I was to be on a Guardian Blind Date.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?A wasp wanted some of Tom’s roast, which he wasn’t keen to share. We both managed to choke on our wine.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?I don’t see why not.</p>
<p>Describe Tom in three wordsTalkative, enthusiastic, silly.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?Friendly and easygoing, I hope. Conversation flowed, but he didn’t ask me a huge number of questions.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?We walked each other to the tube. </p>
<p>And… did you kiss?We did not. There was a fully masked hug.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Maybe, but not romantically.</p>
<p> Tom and Katharyn ate at <a>The Buxton</a>, London E1</p>
<span><h3>Lottie on Amber</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?A civilised evening, lots of paneer, and for my date not to be someone I’ve previously ghosted on dating apps.</p>
<p>First impressions?Pretty, with understated confidence. Who wears a white top to a date in an Indian restaurant? What a power move!</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Our love of cheese (specifically Babybels). Our weird phobias – hers is squash and mine is the ocean. Imagine an ocean of squash – harrowing for us both.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?She’d never had an espresso martini. That’s outrageous: the waiter brought one immediately. She also guessed my age as being 31 or 32 – I’m just 26.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Very. A confident and assertive eater. She insisted I took the leftovers home – a win as the food was wildly good. </p>
<p>Best thing about Amber?Her tooth gap. </p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?As long as she didn’t mind that most are my exes, or even more chaotic than I am.</p>
<p>Describe Amber in three words?Refreshing, sincere and gracious.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?A hot mess who talks a lot and swears more. All of these things are accurate.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?We ran to the tube in the rain and shared some of the ride home. I had an early train to catch next day, or I’d have insisted on a tequila shot or two.</p>
<p>And … did you kiss?No kissing before marriage!</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?One staff member looked like Daniel Radcliffe. I wish we’d asked for a selfie.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?A confident 7.5.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Why not – probably as pals. We have a shared love of tequila and cheese.</p>
<span><h3>Amber on Lottie</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?To meet someone with energy and a great smile. </p>
<p>What did you talk about?Our conversation seemed to grow arms and legs. One minute it was about her undying love for Nicolas Cage, the next about her wonderfully spiritual upbringing.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?I don’t imagine Lottie has experienced an awkward moment in her life.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Fine, although a very slow eater.</p>
<p>Best thing about Lottie?Lottie is 100% unapologetically confident, tattoo and all. How lush!</p>
<p>Describe Lottie in three words?Delightful, insomniac, creative.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Organised but not terribly observant.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?No, but I think we were both surprised to be out past 10pm.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?The rain at the end of the evening. I almost fell over on the walk to the station.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?Solid 10.5.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Absolutely, I’m going to attend a speed dating night that Lottie is hosting and she is going to be very kind and discreet when she tells me I have no matches.</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?A face out of Caravaggio’s sketchbooks? A body cut from the Parthenon friezes? Hopes should outpace expectations.</p>
<p>First impressions?Good. With cocktails on order when I arrived, Dom was clearly on the same page as me.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Faultless.</p>
<p>Best thing about Dom?He manages to be unstoppably funny without sacrificing sincerity. He has an inner warmth. </p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends? In a heartbeat. He’d charm them all.</p>
<p>Describe Dom in three wordsDalston’s hottest ticket.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?Earnest. In need of direction.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?He offered to walk me to the station. (Notice how I didn’t answer the question?)</p>
<p>And … did you kiss?The better question is how we kissed.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?We exchanged numbers …</p>
<p>What were you hoping for?Either a free pint or a proposal – nothing in between.</p>
<p>First impressions?Tall, good-looking, dressed like an extra in Call Me by Your Name.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Lots: Catholicism, Desert Island Discs, death row meals, whether “Australiana” music is a thing.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?In hindsight, I think my outrage at him (an Australian) not knowing who Holly Valance was might have been a bit much.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Impeccable.</p>
<p>Best thing about Michael?He’s an engaging and engaged conversationalist.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends? If they promised to be nicer to him than they are to me.</p>
<p>Describe Michael in three wordsIntelligent, articulate, charming.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?A laugh, I hope?</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?No comment.</p>
<p>And … did you kiss?He came all the way from Cambridge – it would have been rude not to.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Nada.</p>
<p>Marks out of 10?A solid 9.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Michael is lovely, but Cambridge is a long way away.</p>
<p>Each lockdown cycle has been dominated by a breakout reality show. <a>Selling Sunset</a> got us through the worst of it, <a>Bling Empire</a> had its moment, and now Married at First Sight Australia is having its time in the sun.</p>

<p>The effects of staring at ourselves for hours at a time during video conference calls has resulted in a breakdown of how we perceive our own self image.</p>
<p>The phenomenon has been nicknamed “Zoom dysmorphia” by the dermatologist and Harvard Medical School professor Dr Shadi Kourosh, who has noticed an increase in appointment requests for appearance-related issues during the pandemic.</p>
<a>Snapchat dysmorphia</a> (selfie filters leading to a rise in botox usage) has existed since 2015 and is connected to so-called “

<a>culling of women by male partners</a>. Although less so, it turns out, to its rare opposite. Justice for Women draws attention to

<p>Since March 2020, 11.6 million UK workers have been <a>furloughed by their employees</a> as a result of the Covid pandemic, with the government paying up to 80% of their wages in order to keep jobs open.</p>
<a>scheme winds up</a>, we spoke to five people who have been on furlough since the start of the pandemic.
<p>I felt irritated and a bit vulnerable. I felt if I didn’t go along with it, I’d be made redundant.</p>
<p>My main difficulty is not what my company has chosen to do but the cultural perception that people on furlough have had a wonderful lazy 18 months, and it’s time they got back to work.</p>
<p>I’ve lost respect for my employers. Now I’d like something in return for keeping my mouth shut about what they’ve done – I’d like them to be flexible about continuing to work from home. But I don’t think that will happen.</p>
<p>45, operations manager for a sports complex, East SussexOverall, the experience has been an eye-opener and made me realise that life could be good inside your own four walls and with those closest to you.</p>
<p>It’s been a mad 18 months but I’ve made the most of being furloughed. Now I’m really looking forward to going back to my role next month and seeing my colleagues.</p>
<p>39, events administrator, Royal Northern College of Music, ManchesterI’ve been furloughed for a year and a half. Since my job is putting on concerts, I haven’t had anything to do. Thankfully, the college topped up my wages throughout the time.</p>
<p>But my mental health suffered significantly. I was under the constant stress of thinking my job could be discontinued at any moment. Being stuck indoors with lots of uncertainty got me down.</p>
<p>Activists have hailed a police campaign that calls on men to look first to themselves when considering how to tackle violence against women.</p>
<p>The Don’t Be That Guy campaign by Police <a>Scotland</a> includes a video in which several men describe actions often passed off as insignificant but that women might find threatening or intimidating.</p>
<p>The video bears the caption: “Most guys don’t look in the mirror and see a problem. But it’s staring us in the face. Sexual violence begins long before you think it does.”</p>
<p>In it, male actors address the viewer directly and explain how gestures that can be dismissed by some as insignificant can form part of a larger problem, from unwanted compliments to calling a woman “doll”.</p>
<p>Campaigners welcomed the framing, especially in the wake of responses to the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer that appeared to emphasise the need for female victims to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Bruce Springsteen and Barack Obama talk about the impression their fathers made on their lives and their concept of manhood</p>

<p>Springsteen Yeah, but we sort of ended up being just 60s versions of our dads, carrying all the same sexism.</p>
<p>And you don’t notice it when you’re in your 20s. But, right around 30, something didn’t feel quite right. Did you have to deal with that at all?</p>
<p>Obama So there’s some stuff that’s in common and then there’s stuff that tracks a little differently. So my father leaves when I’m two. And I don’t see him until I’m 10, when he comes to visit for a month in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Springsteen What brought him to visit you eight years after he left?</p>
<p>Springsteen When he comes back to visit you, he has another family …</p>
<p>But two things that I discovered, or understood, later. The first was just how much influence that one month that he was there had on me, in ways that I didn’t realise.</p>

<p>Obama You end up wrestling with ghosts.</p>
<p>Springsteen I guess that’s what we all do.</p>

<p>A multimillionaire <a>Silicon Valley</a> venture capitalist has refused to apologise for calling men in “important positions” who take six months paternity leave “losers”.</p>
<p>“Any man in an important position who takes 6 months of leave for a newborn is a loser,” Lonsdale said late on Wednesday. “In the old days men had babies and worked harder to provide for their future – that’s the correct masculine response.”</p>
<p>“Over ten CEOs so far today trolling me by explaining they are about to take six months off to spend with their families. Love you guys,” he said. </p>
<p>“Nothing is more important than our families*. Am excited to get home to Tayler and my girls tmrw after a short trip. *(But really, 6 months?).”</p>
<p>Lonsdale, a regular critic of “woke” politics and a close friend of Peter Thiel, a conservative billionaire and cofounder of Palantir and PayPal, was criticised by many other Silicon Valley executives.</p>
<p>Garry Tan, a cofounder of the venture capital firm Initialized Capital, said: “Initialized has 4 months leave, and I took all 4 months to make sure everyone at Initialized felt like they could do it. </p>
<p>“Respect that people have different choices, but being a dad is awesome and there is more to life than work and money.”</p>
<p>Palantir, which was founded with support from the CIA in 2003, has been linked to efforts to track undocumented migrant workers in the US. </p>
<p>The company was granted a £23m contract to work with the NHS during the pandemic. The firm analyses large volumes of data to find insights, patterns and connections.</p>

<a>beast from the east</a> was blowing, which lent things a certain portentousness. Cycling is good for talking.”
<p>Not everyone will agree that British culture is in need of another ritual in which men go off to get drunk with their mates. And while Blake and Perez want to create meaningful markers, <a>some fathers-to-be</a> do crave a traditional bender.</p>

<p>My book Study of Self was edited and created during the pandemic. Lockdowns have afforded me the time to review the past decade of my work.</p>
<p>Boys and men are more likely than women to die as teenagers or young adults, according to new research that warns the gender gap in mortality rates for that age group is widening in many countries.</p>
<p>In 2019, nearly two thirds (61%) of all deaths among 10- to 24-year-olds worldwide occurred in males, said the research <a>published in the Lancet</a> last week.</p>
<a>diseases from consuming contaminated food or water</a>. In men aged 15 to 24, the most common cause of death was “transport injury” in almost all regions.
<p>The research said that widening gender inequities in many regions have been driven by poor progress in addressing the leading causes of death for boys and young men.</p>
<p>The report also suggested that young people in the 10–24 age group were being neglected by policymakers and that the Covid-19 pandemic would probably jeopardise efforts to improve mortality rates.</p>
<p>The research said while programmes to address the social conditions in which young women live, and the impact of violence against them, were fundamental to improving adolescent health globally, boys had been left behind.</p>
<p>“Inequitable gender norms are also damaging to adolescent males, and advancing the health of all adolescents requires action to reduce inequities in outcomes wherever they occur,” it said.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan Africa has seen the slowest improvements in mortality rates, added Ward, resulting in the burden of global deaths in these age groups shifting towards that region.</p>
<p>Similarly, in management and innovation literature, the late invention of the rolling suitcase often appears as somewhat of a warning. A reminder of our limitations as innovators.</p>

<p>Name: Improbable facial hair trends.</p>
<p>Age: As long as there has been facial hair, there has been improbable facial hair.</p>
<p>Oh, here we go. Time to judge some people for their personal taste again. That sounds like an unfair assumption.</p>
<p>Well, fine, but I don’t really see what … oh my God. Right?</p>
<p>What the hell am I looking at? You are looking at a circle beard, the latest facial hair trend to sweep the world.</p>
<p>What does it remind me of? I don’t know. A hairy horse collar? The miserable result of an experiment where someone is forced to fall asleep face-down on a toilet seat that’s been covered with Pritt and beard trimmings? </p>
<p>But why? And how? And why? The circle beard has been attributed to men experimenting during lockdown. That said, people were tweeting photos of them as far back as 2014.</p>
<p>Yuck. Or remember the double moustache, where people grew an exact duplicate of their moustache under their mouths? You can still see those around.</p>
<p>Do say: “The circle beard is the future of facial hair.”</p>

<p>Age: Well, as you know, people retire at different ages, typically from about 60 onwards.</p>
<p>And they are happier then? They can be.</p>
<p>Because they no longer work, presumably. That could be one reason.</p>
<p>But [looks down] they can’t be happy about what’s happening to them physically. Well, that’s where you’re wrong.</p>
<p>Really? Go on. A recently published study has found that body satisfaction increases with age.</p>
<p>No way! Well, actually, men’s body image is relatively stable – and consistently higher than women’s. But for women, it fluctuates over a lifetime, eventually increasing the older they get.</p>
<p>Is that because by the time you get to 60, what you look like is the least of your worries? Well, yes, there are more important things than looks.</p>
<p>Is that what you tell your partner? Shh. And it’s not just about body image. We may actually get increasingly happier into our 80s.</p>
<p>So we don’t just forget things and get depressed? Not according to Levitin. “We now have strong evidence in the last 10 years that a number of brain faculties actually get better, right on up till the end,” Levitin said on Radio 2.</p>
