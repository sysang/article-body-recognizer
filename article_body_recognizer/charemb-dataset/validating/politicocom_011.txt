<p>The U.S. logged its highest single-day total of new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, with 441,278 infections surpassing the previous daily record by close to 150,000.</p>
<p>It also comes after the Christmas holiday shuttered testing sites and may have contributed to testing backlogs.</p>
<p>A CDC spokesperson said that the daily case total is likely an "overestimate" due to lagging state reporting.</p>
<p>"The counts of cases will become more stable after the new year," CDC spokesperson Jasmine Reed told POLITICO.</p>
<b> </b>new cases per day over the past week,
<b> </b>well more than double the rate in early December.
<p>The CDC revised its estimate for Omicron’s prevalence earlier Tuesday, <a>sharply cutting a previous estimate</a> that the variant accounted for 73.2 percent of cases nationwide on Dec. 18 to 22.5 percent.</p>
<b> </b>estimates Omicron made up about 58.6 percent of U.S. cases as of Dec. 25.
<b> </b>The surge comes as many Americans gather with loved ones for the holidays, with data from the Transportation Security Administration showing air travel at levels close to pre-pandemic 2019 figures.
<p>The rising caseload has prompted the Biden administration to roll out a plan to help curb the variant, includes delivering 500 free million in-home rapid tests to Americans after previously declining to make tests free.</p>
<p>The administration has urged Americans to get vaccinated and boosted and also plans on establishing FEMA surge facilities and vaccination sites while preparing to send protective equipment and troops and medical workers to overburdened hospitals.</p>
<a>officials have been optimistic</a> that it may be less severe. But some public health officials fear Omicron’s surge is again straining the nation’s health care system.

<h2>‘This was the moment’: CDC defends altered guidance amid Omicron surge</h2>

<div> <div> <p> By QUINT FORGEY</p> <p><time>12/29/2021 09:17 AM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/29/2021 12:06 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>CDC Director Rochelle Walensky on Wednesday sought to deflect several lines of skepticism about the agency’s newly shortened, five-day period of recommended isolation for asymptomatic individuals who test positive for Covid-19.</p>
<i>— </i>who appeared on at least five TV networks on Wednesday morning
<i>—</i> comes as the Biden administration has begun instituting new guidance and considering further restrictions to curb an explosion of U.S. coronavirus cases caused by the Omicron variant.
<p>On Wednesday, Walensky acknowledged that the CDC’s decision to alter the recommended isolation period “really had a lot to do with what we thought people would be able to tolerate.” </p>
<p>“We have seen relatively low rates of isolation for all of this pandemic. Some science has demonstrated less than a third of people are isolating when they need to,” Walensky <a>told CNN</a>. </p>
<i>—</i> where we were going to have a lot of disease
<i>—</i> that could be adhered to, that people were willing to adhere to and that spoke specifically to when people were maximally infectious,” she continued.
<a>would be allowed to return to work after seven days</a>, as opposed to the previously recommended 10 days, if they test negative and are asymptomatic after their isolation period.
<p>Furthermore, the CDC advised that health care workers’ isolation period could be cut to five days, or even fewer, in the event of severe staffing shortages at U.S. hospitals.</p>
<a>need to isolate for only five days</a>, not 10 days, citing increasing evidence that people are most infectious in the initial days after developing symptoms.
<p>The new CDC guidance, which is the same regardless of vaccination status, also recommends that individuals leaving isolation wear a mask for another five days following their self-quarantine.</p>
<p>“This was really a way to tell people: Make sure you isolate in those first five days, when you’re maximally infected,” Walensky <a>told NBC</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<a>told The Associated Press</a> on Tuesday. “Using a rapid test or some type of test to validate that the person isn’t infectious is vital.”
<p>“If you got a rapid test at five days and it was negative — we weren’t convinced that you weren’t still transmissible — we didn’t want to leave a false sense of security. We still wanted you to wear the mask,” Walensky told CNN. </p>
<p>“That is not going to be helpful,” Walensky told NBC. “You’re not going to be transmitting during all of that period of time.”</p>
<a>warned might be less capable of detecting</a> the Omicron variant.
<p>“We do know that the antigen test may not perform as well as it had for prior variants — the Alpha variant and the Delta variant — but it’s still picking up quite a bit of infection,” Walensky said.</p>
<p>Walensky went on to reiterate the CDC’s guidance that if an individual receives a negative result from an antigen test but experiences Covid-19 symptoms, they “should go ahead and get that PCR test” to better diagnose a potential infection.</p>
<p>Walensky also denied that the absence of a negative-testing requirement in the CDC’s new guidance was related to a shortage of tests, <a>telling CBS</a>: “This really had nothing to do with supply.”</p>
<p>President Joe Biden pledged in a White House address on Dec. 21 that his administration <a>would buy 500 million at-home rapid antigen tests</a> that Americans will be able to order for free beginning in January.</p>
<p>But <a>details about the purchasing plan remain murky</a>, and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, chair of the National Governors Association, has warned it <a>could interfere with state-level efforts</a> already underway to boost testing supply.</p>

<h2>Biden signs $768B defense policy bill that supersized his original Pentagon request</h2>
<p>The bill rejects Biden's $715 billion Pentagon budget request and instead calls for $740 billion for the Defense Department.</p>
<div> <p> The Department of Defense in Washington D.C. | Patrick Semansky/AP Photo</p> <div> <div> <p> By CONNOR O’BRIEN</p> <p><time>12/27/2021 11:49 AM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/27/2021 05:40 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>President Joe Biden signed a $768 billion defense policy bill on Monday, after Democrats and Republicans rejected his initial Pentagon plans and endorsed a major boost to military spending.</p>
<a>National Defense Authorization Act</a> — which was rolled out in its final form and passed the House and Senate overwhelmingly this month — marks the 61st consecutive year Pentagon policy legislation has become law.
<p>The White House announced Biden signed the bill into law in a statement.</p>
<p>In all, the bill authorizes $768 billion for national defense programs, which includes the Pentagon and nuclear weapons programs overseen by the Department of Energy.</p>
<p>But the defense policy bill only authorizes spending, and doesn't actually allocate any money. Lawmakers must still strike a deal to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year for the defense increase to become reality.</p>
<p>The authorized budget boost will translate into billions more for weapons procurement, including more planes and ships than the Pentagon requested.</p>
<a>Adam Smith</a> (D-Wash.) said in a statement. "Ultimately, this year’s NDAA focuses on what makes our country strong: our economy, diversity, innovation, allies and partners, democratic values, and our troops."
<p>Still, Republicans see the legislation as a conservative policy win based not only on what was included in the compromise bill, but also provisions that were scuttled in negotiations.</p>
<p>Despite Democrats controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House, the final bill received more votes from Republicans.</p>
<p>The top House Armed Services Republican, Rep. <a>Mike Rogers</a> of Alabama, praised the bill's "crucial funding increase" and focus on competition with Beijing and Moscow.</p>
<p>In addition to seeing their proposed $25 billion budget increase adopted, GOP lawmakers cheered a provision that bars the military services from dishonorably discharging service members solely for refusing the Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>Republicans also touted the exclusion of a proposal, sponsored by Rep. <a>Anthony Brown</a> (D-Md.) and backed by Democrats, that would establish a Pentagon office dedicated to countering extremism in the military.</p>
<a>Kirsten Gillibrand</a> (D-N.Y.) — was enough for some Democrats to oppose the final bill.
<p>The White House also issued a lengthy signing statement, laying out Biden's objections to implementing certain provisions, following the bill's enactment.</p>
<p>Chief among Biden's objections are provisions that bar the administration from transferring prisoners held at the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention center to U.S. soil and to four other countries — Syria, Somalia, Libya and Yemen.</p>
<p>"I urge the Congress to eliminate these restrictions as soon as possible," Biden wrote.</p>
<p>Biden also noted a provision in the bill that provides the Pentagon with an exemption from the prohibition on the use of open-air burn pits in military contingency operations outside the U.S.</p>
<p>Biden said he'd comply with congressional reporting requirements but, citing previous executive practices, would do so in a way that protects classified information.</p>

<div> <div> <header> <h1> New York governor's race shakes up with James’ exit </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<p>It's not as though the field is totally clear for Hochul: New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, Rep. Tom Suozzi and, probably, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio will all be trying to get on June's primary ballot.</p>
<a>saying in a statement that </a>“Brooklyn will at last be able to elect a Governor that will empower and uplift all Brooklynites.” It may not have been an official endorsement, but it sounded like one.
<p>Bichotte Hermelyn’s decision to back Hochul speaks volumes about the perceived viability of de Blasio’s potential campaign. Bichotte Hermelyn was among a select few<b> </b>who endorsed the mayor’s 2020 presidential bid. </p>
<p>Even before Thursday, Hochul had been solidifying her status as the early frontrunner ahead of the June primary. The governor has regularly led in the polls, topping James by 18 points in a Siena College survey released earlier this week. </p>
<p>There may be a couple of complications, however: Suozzi’s candidacy could well compete for the moderate and suburban vote that Hochul relied on when defeating Williams four years ago. </p>
<p>“Suozzi is trying to carve out a bit of an unconventional lane for a Democratic primary,” Levy said. “It’s not a wide one, but it’s certainly not no lane.” </p>
<p>Some of the state’s political observers had suggested Williams’ candidacy is unlikely to gestate completely and he would bow out if he failed to gain steam in the coming months.</p>
<p>James’ reentrance into the attorney general’s race will also shake up that primary. State Sen. Shelley Mayer (D-Westchester) <a>ended her campaign</a> soon after James’ announcement, and others are expected to follow suit soon. </p>
<p>But the attorney general’s decision to exit the race does, in fact, change the<b> </b>dynamics for the general election. Zeldin had been <a>planning on running against James in November</a>. </p>
<p>The congressman, who has been portraying Democrats as dominated by their left wing, isn't assuming Hochul will be the nominee. </p>
<p>Hochul appears to be prepared for anything. She said on Thursday, speaking at an unrelated news conference, that she likes to “always run like an underdog.” </p>
<p>“Unless everyone drops out,“ she said, “we’ll have a primary.”</p>
<p>Hochul said she’s ready to fend off a potential Republican wave.</p>
<div> <div> <header> <h1> Westchester DA won't pursue criminal charges against Cuomo </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. — Disgraced former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will not face criminal charges for alleged sexual harassment that took place in Westchester County, the local district attorney announced on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Wexton was first elected in 2018 after winning a crowded Democratic primary that perhaps proved more challenging than her landslide victory against then-GOP Rep. Barbara Comstock. Wexton is a member of the New Democrat Coalition, a moderate group.</p>

<a>failed to produce a map</a> and was rife with partisan bickering. Much of the Virginia Democratic delegation predicted that outcome from the start and warned that redistricting would then revert to the Republican-leaning state Supreme Court.
<p>McEachin, who is set to continue representing a Richmond-based seat under the new lines, said its a misnomer to suggest the state's Supreme Court skewed toward the GOP: "They're not partisan in nature. I mean, I know them personally."</p>

<h2>Florida Democrats already pointing fingers as they steel themselves for November </h2>
<p>Some in the party are grumbling about Manny Diaz, who is responsible for rebuilding the Florida Democrats. </p>

<p>ORLANDO, Fla. — Former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz was heralded as a turnaround artist when he took the helm of the Florida Democratic Party. The big question nearly a year later is whether he’s done enough to help Democrats win in 2022.</p>
<p>Diaz, tasked with rebuilding the state party ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, has not made much visible progress and is confronting a potential onslaught from Republicans.</p>
<p>“If Florida has a bloodbath come November … that’s going to be a concern, not just for myself but I’m sure for many Democrats,” said State Sen. Shevrin Jones, a Miami Gardens Democrat.</p>
<p>The angst surrounding Florida Democrats was on display during their big Leadership Blue conference held this past weekend at an Orlando resort hotel as they delved into everything from organizing to message training.</p>
<p>During caucus meetings and breakout sessions, Democrats fretted over whether they were doing enough outreach to voters — such as those in Black churches well ahead of Election Day — and whether Florida was still competitive.</p>
<p>“I call B.S.,” Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.) said<b> </b>about the state’s battleground status. There were even rumors of a push for a no-confidence vote against Diaz at the state executive committee meeting, although it never materialized.</p>
<p>Multiple Democrats said they have noticed tangible changes and credit Diaz for being more transparent about spending and budget issues.</p>
<p>“We’re not in a hole anymore, but what else?” said state Rep. Anna Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat who says there’s “more stability” in the party previously but she remains worried about messaging and field operations.</p>
<p>“Those plans take time,” Diaz said. “Am I happy with where we are? Not as happy as I would like to be. But yes I’m happy. I think we have done more in an off year than the party has ever done.”</p>
<p>“If we win Florida, it’s over — and Florida is winnable,” Diaz said.</p>
<p>But many Democrats fret that they are not<b> </b>doing enough to persuade voters about why they should vote for them.</p>
<p>Despite all the chatter about his role so far, Diaz said there’s a way to end it.</p>
<p>“Winning cures a lot of problems,” he said.</p>

<div> <div> <p> By DAVID SIDERS</p> <p><time>12/18/2021 07:01 AM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>CHARLESTON, S.C. — Democratic Party leaders moved quietly this week to lower expectations for the midterm elections as they met for year-end talks against the backdrop of an increasingly bleak electoral landscape.</p>
<p>The House? Likely gone. The Senate? A crapshoot.</p>
<p>“Success looks like we hold the Senate and we hold the House, or we narrowly lose it, so if Republicans take control, it’s a razor-thin margin,” said Colmon Elridge, the chair of the Kentucky Democratic Party.</p>
<p>“I would hope [the Republican margin in the House] is less than 20,” he said.</p>
<a>Americans are anxious about the economy</a>. Biden’s approval ratings — a
<a>metric closely tied to a party’s performance in the midterms</a> — are stuck in the low 40s, according to the
<a>FiveThirtyEight polling average</a>, and generic ballot tests pitting unnamed Republicans against unnamed Democrats have
<a>swung in the GOP’s favor</a>.
<p>“Omicron is going to lead to a surge in January, which is undoubtedly going to depress people,” said Karl Sandstrom, a campaign finance lawyer working with Democrats.</p>
<p>Of the party’s prospects in 2022, he said, “It certainly isn’t promising. But it’s a long year.”</p>
<p>In a speech to the state party association, which he leads, Martin repeatedly urged Democrats to “stop agonizing.”</p>
<p>“Look, look, Democrats, midterms are never easy,” he said. “But none of us in this room are here today because the work is easy. We’re here because the work matters.”</p>
<i>any</i> hope for success next year will hinge on Congress passing Biden’s $1.7 trillion climate and social spending package, as well as on elections reform legislation. Both are significant lifts. Biden
<a>acknowledged Thursday</a>, just as meetings picked up here, that negotiations on his
<a>Build Back Better bill will likely drag into next year</a>. Congressional action on
<a>voting rights appears even more tenuous</a>.
<p>“If we could get the Build Back Better plan passed and get a strong voting rights bill passed, Democrats will have a strong possibility of at least keeping the Senate,” said Hendrell Remus, chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party.</p>
<p>“It’s tough. It’s a tough reality," he said.</p>
<a>Omicron variant, while highly contagious</a>, appears typically to cause mild disease. The
<a>economy is showing signs of strength</a>. If the virus and inflation can be brought under control by mid-2022, the mood of the electorate may dramatically improve, likely helping the party in power.
<p>“My goal is — even if it’s slim, if it’s by one — it’s keeping control of the House and adding at least one or two more to the United States Senate,” said Jaime Harrison, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, in an interview.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the historic precedent of the president’s party losing seats in midterms, Harrison said, “The economy’s going to come back and come back strong,” benefiting incumbent Democrats.</p>

<h2>Cascade of failures upended LA County’s 2020 primary, report finds</h2>
<p>The county’s lax oversight of a hardware vendor and slowness to make crucial preparations contributed to chaos and long lines, according to a consultant’s report that POLITICO sued to obtain.</p>

<p>The election that spawned <a>malfunctions and long lines</a> during Los Angeles County’s 2020 primary was even more chaotic and poorly planned than previously indicated, according to an unpublished consultants’ report obtained by POLITICO.</p>
<a>caused confusion and hourslong waits</a> in places such as Georgia, Philadelphia, North Carolina and South Dakota.
<a>suing the county</a>, which had cited security concerns in refusing to release the full document. POLITICO had earlier reported on a
<a>shorter, county-authored analysis</a> that pointed to many of the same causes for the election disarray.
<p>But the problems didn’t start on Election Day. They began nearly a year earlier when the county missed deadlines to choose facilities that would serve as vote centers, then failed to ensure the poll books were tested.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County, with more than 4 million registered voters, was juggling multiple changes in the March 2020 election.</p>
<p>The county’s 135-page report, quietly published that spring, cited inadequate planning as well as insufficient testing and programming of poll books as the main problems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the county CEO's office hired Slalom Consulting to conduct an independent review, which remained unreleased aside from a brief summary published in 2020.</p>
<p>The report also mentions that the county’s new voting machines experienced unspecified JavaScript errors that caused a problem, but doesn’t elaborate. The county didn’t respond to questions about the two issues.</p>
<p>The poll books’ biggest problem involved syncing with the county’s voter registration records, especially because not all the devices were equally prepared for Election Day.</p>
<p>KnowInk did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Slalom report also found that:</p>
<p>Provisional ballots aren’t counted until workers verify a voter’s eligibility, and the decisions to hand them out angered voters who didn’t understand why they had to use them.</p>
<p>Vote center workers didn’t understand why syncing was slow, assumed the provisional alerts were errors and wasted time trying to troubleshoot them.</p>
<p><b>— Investigators also faulted Logan’s office</b> for insufficient oversight of KnowInk and other vendors.</p>
<p>That included the county’s failure to sign a robust support agreement with KnowInk, a lapse that had an impact when things went wrong.</p>
<p><b>— The report also singled out Logan’s office</b> for finishing the selection of vote centers just days before early voting began.</p>
<p>Although the switch to vote centers meant the county had to find fewer than 1,000 facilities — down from 4,800 precincts — those had to be available for four to 11 days, including weekends, instead of just the one day required in past elections.</p>
<p><b>— After voting started, problems with call centers emerged. </b>The county had two — one for operations, one for technology issues — and both were flooded with simultaneous calls that went unanswered.</p>
<p>Slalom made a number of recommendations to address the issues, most of which are redacted in the report.</p>
<a>to every registered voter</a>, which reduced the number of people casting in-person ballots.
<p>This and other changes seemed to work. The November election <a>went smoothly</a>, without significant wait times.</p>

<a>viral photo</a> that showed him vacationing on a yacht with his pants unzipped, holding a drink, and with his arm around a woman.
<p>“Jerry Falwell Jr’s ongoing behavior is appalling,” Rep. Mark Walker, the vice chair of the House Republican Conference, <a>wrote in a tweet</a> on Thursday that called for Falwell’s resignation.</p>
<p>Falwell on Wednesday <a>said in a radio interview that he had apologized</a> to “everyone” for the photo, which he said was taken but at the same time defended the incident as a vacation “costume party” that was “just in good fun.”</p>
<p>Falwell also described the woman in the photo as his “wife’s assistant” and said he regretted embarrassing her by posting the photo.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna try to be a good boy from here on out,” Falwell added.</p>
<p>Falwell, who is among the most vocal evangelical supporters of President Donald Trump, has been president of Liberty University, founded by his father, the late Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr., since 2007.</p>

<h2>Trump brokers deal to remake the field in N.C. Senate race</h2>
<p>The deal benefits Trump-endorsed Rep. Ted Budd, who has struggled to take command of the GOP primary in one of the nation’s key Senate contests.</p>
<div> <p> Rep. Ted Budd and former President Donald Trump shake hands. | Chris Seward/AP Photo</p> <div> <div> <p> By NATALIE ALLISON</p> <p><time>12/05/2021 11:31 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Donald Trump brokered a deal this weekend to clear the North Carolina GOP Senate field for Rep. Ted Budd, the candidate he endorsed in June but who has failed to emerge so far as the clear frontrunner.</p>
<p>“Trump offered Walker the endorsement, and it’s expected to get rolled out this week,” said Jack Minor, Walker’s former chief of staff.</p>
<p>Walker, who was rumored for weeks to be considering a House run, has not formally announced his plans to drop out of the Senate race. Candidate filing in North Carolina begins at noon Monday. </p>
<p>The new 7th District congressional seat that Walker would run for resembles the district Walker represented from 2015 through 2020. Budd currently represents much of that area in Congress.</p>
<p>Both Budd and Walker are campaigning as Trump loyalists, in contrast with McCrory, a Republican with more appeal to moderates.</p>
<p>Until recently, Hines has campaigned as a candidate in the 7th District. Trump’s maneuvering moves him out of that race and into the 4th District contest, thus clearing room for Walker to run in the 7th.</p>
<p>A primary match-up between Hines and Walker could also have become messy, potentially resulting in Cawthorn and other members of the House Freedom Caucus endorsing Hines over Walker, a former Republican Study Committee chair.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Hines said the campaign would not comment on the matter until Monday.</p>
<p>The new arrangement amounts to a truce between several key<b> </b>conservatives in North Carolina — and settles a game of Republican musical chairs that has been underway in the state.</p>
<p>Walker, a former pastor who has actively courted the evangelical Christian vote, has bashed Budd for his reliance on Club for Growth funding. The group’s super PAC is spending $10 million to support Budd in the race.</p>
<p>“President Trump deserves a lot of credit for bringing together North Carolina conservatives and proposing a path that truly benefits the voters,” McIntosh said in a statement Sunday, when asked about his attendance at the Mar-a-Lago meeting.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Trump and Budd did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<b> </b>represented more than two-thirds of what will now become the 7th District.
<b> </b>he received Trump’s “total endorsement” this spring, with the former president announcing he would support Cawthorn in the future in “whatever he wants to do.”
<p>A spokesperson for McCrory’s campaign pushed back on the notion that Budd will benefit from Walker leaving the Senate race.</p>
<p> A McCrory <a>internal polling memo</a> from October showed McCrory ahead by 15 percentage points in the three-way race. Shaw said the poll found his lead grew by another point in a head-to-head matchup with Budd.</p>
<p> A survey commissioned by the Club for Growth last month, meanwhile, had McCrory <a>up by just three points</a>.</p>

<div> <div> <header> <h1> De Blasio vowed to cut traffic fatalities, but 2021 was a deadly year </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio wasted no time in addressing one of his core campaign promises — to bring down the number of vehicular deaths on the city's streets.</p>
<p>On a January day in Queens not long after he was sworn in, de Blasio stood beside grieving parents who had lost children in auto accidents and pledged to eradicate traffic deaths and serious injuries on city streets by 2024.</p>
<p>“This loss of life is very personal for me because I can see it through the eyes of my fellow parents and of course every one of us thinks, ‘What if that was my child?’” de Blasio said in 2014.</p>
<p>That's a significant blow to de Blasio’s promise of leaving office with the city well on its way to achieving his “Vision Zero” goal — reducing traffic deaths to zero — in 2024.</p>
<a><u>died in vehicle crashes</u></a> last year hit its highest number since 2007.
<p>“We've seen a horrible impact of this pandemic beyond all the other horrors that we've seen with the loss of life, from the disease. We've seen a loss of life from crashes,” de Blasio said at a July press conference. </p>
<p>Others say the pandemic is a convenient excuse and that some of the blame must be shared by the mayor. </p>
<p>Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, said the data speaks to a “tragic story.”</p>
<p>“Vision Zero was a success. There was focus, it was a priority,” Harris said of the early days of the administration. But, he added, after a while, “[we] watched the erosion." </p>
<p>De Blasio didn’t immediately stand out as the transportation candidate when he embarked on his first mayoral campaign.</p>
<a><u>critical of Janette Sadik-Khan</u></a>, Bloomberg’s transportation commissioner who added hundreds of miles of new bike lanes and pedestrian plazas. He
<a><u>excoriated some of her projects in a 2011 letter</u></a> he wrote as Public Advocate, where he called for an environmental review of future projects.
<p>But he embraced Vision Zero as he began shaping his campaign as a progressive. It earned him the backing of StreetsPAC, a political action committee seeking to improving street safety.</p>
<p>Lander and de Blasio both represented Park Slope in Brooklyn, where the movement for safer streets grew under Amy Cohen, a resident whose 13-year-old son was killed by a van that same year.</p>
<p>“At the time, it felt he was the one most willing to drive a stake in the ground and say, ‘I’m all in on this,’” said Tom Wright, the executive director of the Regional Plan Association. </p>
<p>De Blasio made early moves to indicate a commitment to street safety. </p>
<p>“He took meaningful steps in that direction,” Lander said.</p>
<p>But progress would often be marred by his reticence to embrace bigger transportation initiatives, despite the urging of local officials and advocates.</p>
<a><u>opening streets to pedestrians wouldn’t work during the pandemic</u></a>, even as Council members and residents pushed for them. He
<a><u>opposed a congestion pricing plan</u></a> to charge drivers entering midtown Manhattan, even though
<a><u>most New York City residents don’t own a car</u></a>. At one point, he proposed
<a><u>ripping out pedestrian plazas in Times Square</u></a>.
<a><u>faulted state officials for being slow to implement it</u></a>. The pedestrian plazas in Times Square remain.
<h2><b>A different city</b></h2>
<p>Officials within the de Blasio administration pushed back against the notion that the mayor was slow to embrace big streetscape projects. </p>
<a><u>allow cars to enter bike lanes</u></a>,
<a><u>putting cyclists in danger</u></a>. Roughly half of the conventional bike lanes were installed under Bloomberg.
<p>Many of these strides were made despite the vitriol local officials displayed toward projects designed to make streets safer or help commuters. </p>
<a><u> "Staten Island secession movement</u></a>.” Queens politicians once chanted “Business Lives Matter” in
<a><u>opposing the Flushing busway</u></a>. Both policy changes were ultimately implemented.
<a><u>delayed by several years after community opposition</u></a>. Other major transportation initiatives — like a
<a><u>new busway on 5th Avenue</u></a> or
<a><u>improvements to Sunset Park roadways</u></a> — have faced setbacks.
<p>“They have not made fixing the hard infrastructure — doing the hard work of Vision Zero — a priority," said Cohen, who co-founded Families for Safe Streets after her son was killed. </p>
<h2><b>Enforcement crackdown</b></h2>
<p>From the beginning, de Blasio indicated his Vision Zero goal would primarily focus on enforcement to curb reckless driving — ticketing drivers for failing to yield to pedestrians or speeding down streets.</p>
<p>At his 2014 press conference, de Blasio stood next to his then-police commissioner, Bill Bratton, and vowed to dedicate more police resources toward deterring dangerous driving. </p>
<u>failed to come to an agreement to continue the program</u>
<a><u>Transportation Alternatives.</u></a> The city also saw an average drop of 72 percent in speeding where cameras are located, the DOT said.
<p>Enforcement has declined during the pandemic. Data from City Hall shows Vision Zero-related summonses issued by the NYPD have hit their lowest level since 2015, from a peak of 715,637 summonses in 2018 to just over 307,000 summonses in 2021. </p>
<p>By de Blasio’s own account, much of his legacy on Vision Zero has yet to be seen. He didn’t list it among his signature achievements in a <a><u>December interview with Joseph Viteritti</u></a>, a professor of public policy at Hunter College.</p>
<p>“I won’t list Vision Zero but I’ll put in the category… [of] a lot of things I think will have a very lasting impact and I hope have had profound impact already,” de Blasio said.</p>

<p>ALBANY — A study of a bill to have the state conduct a study of bills that mandate state studies has reached a conclusion: A whole lot of these studies go nowhere. </p>
<a>a report due to be released soon</a> by the state Senate’s Committee on Investigations and Government Operations and its chair, James Skoufis (D-Orange County).
<p>That study found that even many of the studies that had been completed were doomed to anonymity. Some weren’t posted on the websites of the agencies that conducted them. </p>
<p>And others simply weren’t done at all. </p>
<p>Some entities did what they were required to do. The Seafood Marketing Task Force, for example, completed its examination of seafood marketing by the 2019 due date. </p>
<p>But the fact that so many studies are never completed or are doomed to obsolescence is concerning, the report argues. </p>
<p>The report concluded that “consequences should be considered for extreme or persistent non-compliance.” </p>
<p>“I believe those consequences could and should be legal recourse,” Skoufis said. “If an agency is consistently and flagrantly ignoring a legislative directive and, thus, breaking the law, we should sue the agency and compel action.” </p>

<h2>Biden finally gets the ‘big effing deal’ signing ceremony of his own</h2>
<p>But amid the celebrations over the bipartisan infrastructure package, the question just below the surface was: Will this be his last such moment?</p>
<div> <div> <div> <p> By LAURA BARRÓN-LÓPEZ, CHRISTOPHER CADELAGO and NICK NIEDZWIADEK</p> <p><time>11/15/2021 04:32 PM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>11/15/2021 06:01 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>President Joe Biden did on Monday what his immediate predecessors couldn’t: sign a sweeping infrastructure bill into law and with a bipartisan crowd of lawmakers cheering him on as he did so.</p>
<p>But on a brisk, windy fall afternoon — 299 days into his presidency — Biden secured a win that eluded former President Donald Trump, whose <a>fruitless attempts at such a deal</a> became fodder for punchlines among the political cognoscenti.</p>
<p>The signing of the bill comes at a precarious time for Biden, coinciding with a sputtering of his approval rating that has created a mortal threat to his party’s hold on its slim majorities in Washington.</p>
<p>It has led to<b> </b>questions about whether the president will get a moment like Monday again. But the White House was eager to turn the script, with officials again encouraging comparisons to Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal.</p>
<p>“To paraphrase one of my favorite former vice presidents: It’s a big effin’ deal,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), referring to Biden’s comment to President Barack Obama at the signing of the Affordable Care Act in 2010.</p>
<p>“That’s why economists say this bill is counter-inflationary, which is so important right now,” Portman said on Monday.</p>
<p>“It shows that it can be done,” LaHood added, “and Biden was a leader on this.”</p>
<a>passed the Senate in August</a> as Democrats negotiated parts of Biden’s signature Build Back Better agenda. The two were subsequently delinked after
<a>two trips by Biden to the Hill</a> to huddle with House Democrats. The House
<a>ultimately passed the infrastructure bill on Nov. 5</a>, just days after Democrats suffered a big defeat in the Virginia governor’s race.
<a>threats of violence</a> were made
<a>against the 13 House Republicans</a> who voted in favor of the legislation, ensuring its passage despite a half-dozen Democratic defections.
<p>“It’s certainly a plus when you can do anything on a bipartisan basis, particularly something as consequential as this,” he said, “but I don’t think it’s a likely precedent for anything else happening on a bipartisan basis.” </p>

<p>On top of the potential for bad weather that looms over any upstate New York event in the middle of the winter, there were several unresolved issues that threatened to put a damper on Smith's inauguration. </p>
<p>These included the disappearance of a member of the governor’s traveling party. </p>
<p>Far more troubling, however, was the chance that Albany’s joviality could be ruined by buzzkills from the federal government. </p>
<p>In the end, however, those looking to imbibe didn’t have anything to worry about. </p>
<p>The practice of delivering a gubernatorial message in person to the Legislature wasn’t completely unprecedented. In fact, it had been common practice in the colonial era and the state’s first few decades of existence. </p>
<p>“’Huh,’ remarked the Governor, after reading the inscription, ‘those ought to be good.’ And he passed them around.” </p>
<p>Smith said his motivation for breaking with the long-standing tradition had to do with getting lawmakers to pay attention to what he had to say. </p>
<p>By all accounts, Smith succeeded at getting his former colleagues to stay in their seats. </p>
<p>The agenda he pushed at this speech was ambitious — it would require “no less than twenty-four” bills and at least a half dozen constitutional amendments, according to a tally by the Times. </p>
<p>As for the saga of Snooky, it appears to have a happy ending, though none of the three newspapers that wrote stories on his disappearance followed up with articles saying how he was found. </p>

<p>ALBANY, N.Y. — State Attorney General Tish James has suspended her campaign for governor less than two months after a highly anticipated launch, saying that she will instead focus on reelection to her current job in 2022.</p>
<a><u>never launched a full-fledged campaign</u></a> and regularly trailed Hochul by wide margins in early polls.
<u>reported that she is continuing </u>
<p>A senior campaign adviser said the governor's race didn't seem to engage James as her previous campaigns did, something which became apparent to everyone on the campaign, including the candidate herself. </p>
<i>that</i> Tish. The question is why? I think she really felt she wasn’t feeling that campaign and was excited about some stuff she was doing in the [attorney general]’s office. If that’s where you end up, then it really doesn’t make sense to run.”
<p>“I can tell you without a doubt that was not a factor at all, certainly, for her personally, and for us as a campaign,” the source said.</p>
<p>Her departure from the race changes the campaign's dynamics.</p>
<a>Tom Suozzi</a> of Long Island. Outgoing New York City Bill de Blasio could also enter the race soon.
<p>Now, Hochul is well-positioned to win support from party leaders and top donors as she seeks a full term in her own right next year.</p>
<p>Williams, who lost a bid for lieutenant governor to Hochul in a 2018 Democratic primary, said he had a "good relationship and mutual admiration" with James. Williams now has a clear path to claim support from the party's progressive wing. </p>
<p>James' exit from the governor's race will also complicate what was shaping up to be a volatile campaign to succeed her as attorney general. </p>
<p>Former Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Goldman, Fordham University law professor Zephyr Teachout, state Sen. Shelley Mayer (D-Yonkers) and Queens Assembly member Clyde Vanel have already announced their candidacies for the Democratic nomination. </p>

<p>President Joe Biden’s proposal to help millions of more families afford child care must overcome a critical hurdle first: The nation currently lacks enough facilities and workers to staff them.</p>
<p>While Biden's plan also includes money for new child care centers and hiring incentives, Democrats acknowledge that many families wouldn't immediately benefit from the infusion of resources.</p>
<p>“That's not going to happen in three days. First we have to build the capacity and get the workers, and then we will have the ability then to move on," Senate HELP Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said.</p>
<p>With trillions of dollars in federal aid already poured into the economy to counter the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the situation raises larger questions about how quickly all of the new spending Biden has proposed can be absorbed.</p>
<p>Covid made the situation worse.</p>
<p>At the height of the pandemic, <a>60 percent of child care programs around the country had closed</a> and one-third of the child care workforce had lost their jobs. <a>More than 1 in 4 child care facilities were still shuttered</a> as of December.</p>
<a>4 in 5 child care providers said they had a staffing shortage</a>. More than 1 in 3 child care workers said they were considering leaving their job this year, and an equal number of providers said they were considering shutting down their programs.
<p>Biden administration officials acknowledge that putting the new resources to use quickly presents challenges.</p>
<p>But Rouse said getting the proposed new care programs up and running "is top of mind" for Biden and pointed to other initiatives that have been stood up quickly, like the Child Tax Credit expansion.</p>
<p>Still, supporters of the plans expect the new aid to help many people immediately if it’s approved by Congress, just on a smaller scale to start with.</p>
<p>Biden’s pair of infrastructure proposals include the bulk of <a>the $775 billion caregiving plan he campaigned on</a>, which he said at the time would create 3 million new jobs and increase overall employment by about 5 million.</p>
<p>The plan also envisions boosting the wages of child care workers and providing professional development for them.</p>
<p>The American Jobs Plan, unveiled in March, recognized the need for more capacity. It would provide $25 million for construction of new child care facilities.</p>
<a>A separate analysis from the Roosevelt Institute</a> found that increasing access to child care could boost GDP by $551 billion and increase the lifetime earnings for women with two children by about $94,000.
<p>But the infrastructure that could create those results is years down the line, experts warn. Just restoring the crippled industry to its pre-pandemic state will take time.</p>
<p>“There is absolutely a lag time,” said Caitlin Codella, vice president of policy for the U.S. Chamber Foundation’s Center for Education and Workforce.</p>
<p>“There has been a ton of money that’s gone out" in the American Rescue Plan and prior rounds of Covid relief, Codella said, "and we have seen challenges, frankly, just getting that money out the door.”</p>
<p>Of the $52.5 billion in Covid relief funds appropriated to states via the Child Care and Development Block Grant program thus far, for instance, just $3.9 billion has been spent, <a>according to a July Government Accountability Office report</a>.</p>
<p>Rouse maintained that the administration has the experience getting programs off the ground and can make the transition as effectively as possible.</p>
<p>As vice president, “Biden presided over the Recovery Act, and that was very successful at getting the funds to where they needed to go,” Rouse said, referring to the program enacted in 2009 to help pull the economy out of the Great Recession.</p>
<p>She pointed to the matter of months it took to stand up the expanded Child Tax Credit program as an example of a successful ramp-up.</p>
<p>Supporters of Biden's plan point out that much of the investment in child care would be routed through the Child Care Development Block Grant program, which would minimize some of the start-up time.</p>
<p>“We have these systems in place,” said Sherry Leiwant, co-founder of left-leaning advocacy group A Better Balance. “I don't think it's really a problem at all to put more money in.”</p>

<h2>Biden takes the fight to Omicron. But the toolkit is growing bare. </h2>
<p>The policies previewed by the president are continuations or modest expansions of existing initiatives. And he’s yet to embrace the further reaching proposals.</p>

<p>The reality, however, is that most of the steps the administration plans to take are continuations or modest expansions of existing initiatives, and some experts doubt they will do much to change the pandemic’s current trajectory.</p>
<p>Biden announced on Thursday that his government will launch campaigns to expand access to vaccines and booster shots, institute stricter travel requirements and open a path toward free at-home Covid-19 testing.</p>
<p>Administration officials and others close to the Covid response concede there’s little in Biden’s new plan that’s likely to drive up the vaccination rate among those yet to get their first shots.</p>
<p>The new plan unveiled Thursday would ramp up outreach to families and older Americans, in a bid to accelerate vaccinations for children and boosters for adults and the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>The administration will also more closely track travelers into the U.S. and encourage more frequent testing, potentially giving officials a better picture of the virus’ spread and helping to head off outbreaks.</p>
