<p>A <a>legal opinion</a> drafted for Demirel’s European parliamentary group argues the EDF is a “manifest violation” of the EU’s founding treaties, which prohibit use of the bloc’s budget for “operations having military or defence implications”.</p>
<p>EU military research began in 2014, when the parliament approved a €1.4m <a>pilot project</a> on defence research. Gahler was its architect. “We thought ‘OK, we make a start with these nitty-gritty budgetary instruments that we’ve got’,” he said.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the European Commission listed projects that are likely to be funded under the defence fund, including drone technology, “ground-based precision strike capabilities”, and a new generation of ground, air and naval combat platforms.</p>
<a>regulate</a> the use of AI inside the bloc, the current draft does not cover military use.
<a>expressed concerns to the Guardian</a> over the lack of oversight on security research projects funded by Horizon. Potential ethical issues with developing weapons and other military technology will be far worse, say critics of the EDF.
<h2>‘It increases the risk of harm to civilians’</h2>
<a>2020 coup</a> was a colonel, Assimi Goïta, who was trained by France, Germany and the US.
<p>The February 2020 document also called for the mission area to be extended to “cover the whole of Mali”, as well as for increased programmes for the armed forces of Burkina Faso and Niger.</p>
<p>Senior EU figures have <a>suggested</a> using the EPF to provide support for the Libyan Coast Guard, a border force that the bloc has been supporting since 2017, despite <a>evidence </a>of human rights violations against migrants and refugees. </p>
<p>The EU official said a political consensus would be required for any such action. “I would be surprised if the EPF is used in Libya,” he added.</p>
<p>He added: “It increases the risk of harm to civilians, rather than bringing peace to the region.” </p>
<h2>Make peace with weapons?</h2>
<p>Slijper put it more bluntly: “It’s clear that the European Union is drifting farther and farther away from that initial idea of a peace project and these instruments, the peace facility and the defence fund, are very clear examples.”</p>
<p>However, in the halls of power in Brussels, these views are a minority. “Sometimes you need military means to establish peace,” said Vautmans. “A geopolitical Europe also needs the means to be able to have an impact.”</p>
<p>Young people across Europe reveal how the pandemic has made them impatient for systemic change after bearing brunt of fallout</p>
<p>Covid-19 policies risk leaving psychological and socioeconomic scars on millions of young people across Europe, with far-reaching consequences for them and society, a wide-ranging Guardian project has revealed.</p>
<p>Teenagers and young adults <a>expressed profound anxiety</a> about their future and accused governments of failing them as 15 months of lockdowns destabilised their mental wellbeing, education and job prospects. </p>
<p>The depth of despondency and anger the responses reflect is likely to ring political alarm bells, just as European governments are taming the health crisis with vaccination programmes and cautiously reopening battered economies.</p>
<p>Respondents from countries across Europe said the crisis had made them impatient for systemic change and determined that their generation would create more caring societies in the future.</p>
<p>Others revealed long spells of isolation had made them understand the need for “genuine” human interactions. “Life cannot be lived in social networks or video calls. We need people around us to make sense of ourselves,” a Dutch student said.</p>
<p> An 18-year-old in Barcelona said being “locked” for months in a small flat with her large family, and sharing one computer, had left her in a “dreadful” mental state.</p>
<p>“I feel constantly anxious,” said a 23-year-old student in Estonia. “It’s the uncertainty about the future that hurts the most.”</p>
<p>The risk, he stressed, was that a groundswell of youth discontent, combined with a <a>collapse of trust</a>, “could be captured by political forces that have an interest in undermining young people’s faith in democracy”.</p>
<p>Governments should be offering free university tuition, job guarantees and other support, Hurrelmann said. “They have to give the signal: we want you to be able to enter society and start your life.”</p>
<p>Fatigue with apps and social media is a recurring theme. “Although we are used to social media, the internet, our mobile phones and computers, now we cannot stand them any more,” was the view of an 18-year-old school leaver in Athens.</p>
<p>“We should return to doing things like spontaneous socialising and physical contact,” a student at a British university said.</p>
<p>A student in Freiburg, Germany, added: “An 18th birthday on a Zoom conference call is hardly an experience that you will still be laughing about with your friends in five to 10 years’ time.” </p>
<p>Online learning is almost universally unpopular: “I now know how bad online class is even with great teachers,” said a 20-year-old maths undergraduate in France.</p>
<p>“It has completely ruined my university experience and quality of degree,” a final-year student at a London university said. “I hate learning online, and I hate it more knowing I’m paying full prices for a couple of Zoom classes a week.”</p>
<p>Most respondents said they had struggled to get help for the psychological effects of the pandemic.</p>
<p>But the shared sense that young people mattered less than any other group in society could be fostering a new solidarity within Generation Z, Hurrelmann said.</p>
<p>Diego Maradona’s younger brother, Hugo, has died in Naples at the age of 52 just a year after the death of the Argentine football legend, the Italian football club Napoli has confirmed.</p>
<p>“Hugo Maradona has died,” <a>Napoli</a> said in a brief statement on Tuesday, confirming reports in the Italian press that the former footballer had suffered a heart attack.</p>
<p>The club said that the Napoli president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, and the team “come together around Maradona’s family and unite with them in the pain of Hugo’s death”.</p>
<p>A former Argentine youth international midfielder, Hugo Maradona played in <a>Italy</a>, Austria, Spain, Argentina and Japan before returning to Italy to settle permanently. He had a brief coaching career with amateur clubs in Naples.</p>
<p>Maradona, who had three children, recently ran on a rightwing list in municipal elections, which the left ultimately won.</p>
<p>Hugo Maradona was signed by Napoli in 1987 – joining Diego – before being loaned to Ascoli.</p>
<p>On 20 September of the same year, the two brothers played against each other with Diego’s Napoli coming out on top 2-1.</p>
<p>Diego Maradona, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, died in November 2020 aged 60.</p>

<p>Q Should I spend the equivalent of a quarter of the value of my home to reduce its carbon footprint?</p>
<p>According to the trust, <a>cladding your walls could cost about £10,000</a> if you opt for external insulation, and could save you up to £350 a year, depending on the type of property in which you live.</p>
<p>A It might be worth remortgaging now but a lot depends on whether the potential savings you could make would cover the costs of switching.</p>
<p>My boyfriend’s job means he is much savvier about getting the best out of a financial situation – I would really appreciate any advice as I feel quite out of my depth here.JD</p>
<p>Judging by the responses from readers to other letters I have answered about joint purchases where one partner was calling all the shots, if you do go ahead in spite of your reservations, it is unlikely to end well.</p>
<p>Finally, unless you can get your boyfriend to take your views into account – and select a property, price and location you are both happy with – I still think that you will regret going ahead with the joint purchase. </p>

<a>Europe</a> but said Prentis told him in a meeting on Tuesday there was nothing she could do to ease the barriers because the extra paperwork, including health certificates for each consignment of cheese, were mandatory under EU rules.
<p>But under the new rules each parcel needs to be accompanied by a health certificate costing £180, making low-value sales unviable.</p>
<p>The environment minister and her aides suggested he pursue business in “emerging markets” across the Atlantic where different barriers apply but he explained that the delivery costs were prohibitive.</p>
<p>“It was a fairly useless conversation as a whole,” he said.</p>
<p>“They think there’s an opportunity to get employment in their town, but that’s exactly what the British government should be doing.”.</p>
<p>The department also committed to sending him “further information on possible trading solutions – including on groupage [multiple consignments per truck], which some dairy businesses are using to export products successfully”.</p>
<p>“The last three months have been thoroughly unpleasant because of Brexit. It’s been terrible, it’s been one of the most stressful periods of my business life,” he said.</p>
<p>His story is emblematic of the experience of <a>many small businesses </a>hit by extra paperwork.</p>
<p>Asked if there was any chance of an exemption in the post-Brexit rules in the consumer business in the UK, he said Prentis replied: “None.”</p>
<p>“I explained [to her] that my fundamental fear is that the large expense of setting up a mirrored operation [in the EU], could all be for nothing with the increasingly hostile environments between the two sides.”</p>
<p>One option was to send truckloads of cheese to France or another EU country and fulfil orders from there.</p>
<p>But he has decided against that “because even the paperwork for wholesale shipment of goods is so onerous that it will be a full-time job for the EU exports side of the business, adding even more costs”.</p>
<a>post-Brexit trading</a> rules bite.
<a>was sent</a> a tax and customs demand for €102, while a woman in the Netherlands who bought trousers in December “with no issues”
<a>faced a €40 bill</a> for two more pairs ordered in January.
<a>France</a>, said many people may have been surprised because “they believed the tariff-free trade deal negotiated between the UK and EU meant there would be no extra charges”.
<p>Customers of the department store chain John Lewis, also popular with British citizens living in the EU, who value its “never knowingly undersold” price match guarantee and reliable customer service, have also been disappointed.</p>
<a>Europe</a> is now greeted by a page stating: “We are no longer taking orders for international delivery.”
<p>An “import fees deposit”, meanwhile, is now automatically added to orders from continental Europe placed via Amazon’s UK website, nearly doubling the cost of some items and making it significantly cheaper to find an EU alternative.</p>
<p>Hickson said fees for customs declarations were usually collected by the international shipping companies, such as DHL or UPS, responsible for transporting the goods, with customers notified of the charge – and obliged to pay – before delivery.</p>
<p>A <a>leading French consumer website</a> cited the example of a pair of trainers ordered from a UK website for £270 but manufactured in and shipped from China, saying customs duty of 16.9% and 20% French VAT would bring their cost to about £378.</p>
<p>“Our business had high hopes of continued growth in the EU market, after seeing the avoidance of the no-deal and announcement of a free trade deal.</p>
<p>“What has only become clear in the last week is that our successful B2C [business to consumer] online sales to EU consumers is now impossible to operate,” he said.</p>
<p>“It is a real shame because that means I’m now going to invest in France, provide French employment, and then contribute to the EU tax system, which was pretty much going against the whole reason that we were meant to be leaving.”</p>
<a>Food</a> and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the National Farmers’ Union along the way.
<p>But what he had not anticipated was the requirement for health certificates to accompany online orders from private customers.</p>
<p>Defra said it had worked hard to ensure UK businesses were not disadvantaged by the deal and that the farming and food minister Victoria Prentis would now be in contact with Spurrell and Defra officials to discuss further.</p>
<a>tweet</a> in English saying “help us to help you”, with a link to a page on the EU’s Access2Markets website explaining “how to report a trade barrier”.
<p>Spurrell’s Cheshire cheese company in Macclesfield and Hartington Creamery in Derbyshire turn over more than £4.3m a year and employ 25 people, and he planned to double staff numbers with a new fulfilment centre in March.</p>
<p>“I would be looking to employ another 20 people on top of the 25 we have now,” he said. “So, a substantial investment which we now have to review. I am still shell shocked by what has happened.” </p>
<p>His experience is being <a>repeated right across the country</a> with courier companies refusing to take small packages of animal or food originated products.</p>
<p>A government spokesperson said “there is extensive advice available to support businesses as they adjust to the new arrangements” and it was “vital” that traders ensured they had the correct paperwork for exports.</p>

<p>If I don't give instructions for making the meringues in question, it's because I feel that those of you who are inclined to make their own will know how to already. Those who are unsure should best stick to the boxed kind.</p>
<p>Choose a dish about 10cm deep, suitable for holding 9 savoiardi in one layer. Heat the oven to 140°C/Gas 1. Then make the meringues. Set aside 10 of them and crumble the others.</p>
<p>Before serving, smooth the remaining cream all over the pudding and decorate with the whole meringue coins (or more crumbled shop-bought meringue). I would offer a bowl of raspberries alongside.</p>

<p>The Gay Hussar is among the most celebrated restaurants in London but its fame rests not so much on the quality of its chilled wild-cherry soup and its goulash, but on its reputation as the beating heart of political gossip.</p>
<p>But after 65 years as a hotbed of political plotting, backstabbing, deal-making and gossip, it is due to close its doors for the last time in June.</p>
<p>In the end, with no decent offer on the table, Corus agreed to keep the restaurant open, giving it a minor rebrand as GH Soho, although with the restaurant’s traditional interiors and old-school meaty menu left largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Wrobel is not planning a farewell party on 21 June. “We will go quietly with a dignified ending,” he said. “There is nothing to celebrate.”</p>

<span><h3>Alizée on Rhys</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?Good food, meeting someone interesting and that my date would be as tall as me (six-foot gal over here!)</p>
<p>First impressions?Very smiley, smartly dressed and easygoing.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Our shared love of food, adventure and live music. We’ve done ski seasons in the same place, so we shared the juicy stories of what happened there. And my work in the advertising world.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?We both had a laugh when the restaurant misunderstood that we were on a blind date – they thought we were reviewing the restaurant.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Faultless. We ate loads of small plates and he remembered what everything was, and always asked if I wanted to go first before trying the food.</p>
<p>Best thing about Rhys?Being fully on board when I suggested we order a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?Yes, as a friend – he has lots of cool stories to share.</p>
<p>Describe Rhys in three wordsPositive, attentive and well travelled.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?Tall, outgoing, and he could see how much I love food and adventure.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?No.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for physical distancing, would you have kissed?No, there wasn’t a spark unfortunately.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?The food was impeccable, and he was easy to chat to, but I’m sure he’ll agree there wasn’t any sexual chemistry. He was also a lot shorter than me.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Unlikely.</p>
<span><h3>Rhys on Alizée</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?After everything that has happened in the last year, I was just very excited for the opportunity to go out, meet someone I’d never spoken to before and enjoy a fun evening.</p>
<p>First impressions?Beautiful: wonderful eyes, great smile. Taller than me (and I was wearing my “Make me taller shoes”).</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Winter, travelling, what we do for work, friends … A lot.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?Probably when I said cheers in Spanish and not French (Alizée speaks fluent French). Super smooth.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Excellent. She was eating edamame beans with chopsticks. That takes some skill.</p>
<p>Best thing about Alizée?Very easy to talk to, wonderfully personable, made me feel at ease.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Absolutely.</p>
<p>Describe Alizée in three wordsEbullient, vivacious, well travelled.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?I’ll let her answer that!</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?No, we said goodnight and went our separate ways.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for physical distancing, would you have kissed?No.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?Nothing.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Not knowingly, but if we ran into each other I know it would be a pleasure.</p>
<span><h3>Adriana on Streisand</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?A good night, some delish food and to meet someone fun and exciting.</p>
<p>First impressions?Polite, smart and good-looking, if a little flustered.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?He didn’t like the tasting menu, so that was kind of awkward. The waiter noticed and apologised and offered him some cauliflower tempura instead. </p>
<p>Good table manners?I’m sure they are great but I didn’t really get to see them because he didn’t eat much. He was very polite to the waiter.</p>
<p>Best thing about Streisand?His musical tastes: he likes reggaeton. He also seemed very kind, hardworking and family-orientated.</p>
<p>Would you introduce him to your friends?I think he might find us all a bit much.</p>
<p>Describe Streisand in three words?Opinionated, driven, serious.</p>
<p>What do you think he made of you?I have no idea, he was hard to read.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?We walked to the tube.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for physical distancing, would you have kissed?It wasn’t the vibe.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?It might have been a more enjoyable night for him if he could have left without needing to stop for a takeaway on the way home!</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Maybe as friends.</p>
<span><h3>Streisand on Adriana</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?To meet a new friend, and that it might lead to romance further down the line.</p>
<p>First impressions?Nice eyes, easy going, good energy.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Politics, family, our upbringings, work, how intense bachata dancing is.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?She is a reporter for a red-top …</p>
<p>Good table manners?Very good.</p>
<p>Best thing about Adriana?Her keenness to listen and debate with people who have different opinions.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?My friends would embrace her with open arms.</p>
<p>Describe Adriana in three words?Thoughtful, adventurous, and a good listener.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Someone who struggles to eat food that he has never tried before.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?Nah. It was getting late and we both had to get up early in the morning.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for physical distancing, would you have kissed?Well, I did give her two kisses on the cheek as we said goodbye.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?The food. I’d have liked to feel fuller.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?I gave her my number but haven’t heard back. </p>
<p>Adriana and Streisand ate at Turnips Borough Market, London SE1. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com</p>
<span><h3>Rosie on Ella</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?To meet someone interesting, enjoy some nice food and not get roasted in the write up.</p>
<p>First impressions?She was really friendly and I could tell it was going to be a nice evening. </p>
<p>What did you talk about?Berlin, where we’d both recently been, London, Morpeth, vegetarian cooking, the Blind Date column (meta), Nick Clegg (negatively), queer fantasy novels, drag kings, yellow carrots.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?No, though I dropped a spoon on myself, and a couple at the next table were having a very awkward date.</p>
<p>Good table manners?Impeccable. We were both up for three courses and sharing multiple starters.</p>
<p>Best thing about Ella?It’s hard to pick just one thing. She’s really open and engaging. We were able to get to know each other well.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Definitely, they’d get on well.</p>
<p>Describe Ella in three words?A lovely person.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?I think positive things.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?Yes, we found a pub. Ella very kindly bought me a drink, but we left before I could return the favour as we had to catch the tube before it stopped running. (Bring back the night tube!)</p>
<p>And … did you kiss?No, it was more of a friendly than romantic connection.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?I wouldn’t have accidentally ordered a pizza with ham on it!</p>
<p>Would you meet again?For sure. We might go to some queer venues and events together as friends.</p>
<span><h3>Ella on Rosie</h3></span>
<p>What were you hoping for?Something along the lines of that famous old Blind Date column: “I left my knickers at a house party we crashed”. Failing that, a fun evening with tasty food.</p>
<p>First impressions?Smiley. Immediately put me at ease.</p>
<p>What did you talk about?Cooking, recent holidays, coming out stories, lots of wonderful queer stuff.</p>
<p>Any awkward moments?Nothing could be more awkward than the hands-on-hips pose I attempted to strike for the pre-dinner picture.</p>
<p>Good table manners?I can’t fault someone who suggests ordering two types of cheese as a starter.</p>
<p>Best thing about Rosie?Her genuine interest in the world.</p>
<p>Would you introduce her to your friends?Sure!</p>
<p>Describe Rosie in three words?Engaging, funny and interesting.</p>
<p>What do you think she made of you?Adept at finding a semi-decent pub with seats on a Friday night.</p>
<p>Did you go on somewhere?A pub in Soho.</p>
<p>And … did you kiss?We did not.</p>
<p>If you could change one thing about the evening what would it be?To have eaten more of the burrata. I thought about it all the way home.</p>
<p>Would you meet again?Definitely, as friends. A trip to She Soho has been suggested.</p>
<p>Women in prison are five times more likely to have a stillbirth and twice as likely to give birth to a premature baby that needs special care, new data collected by the Observer shows.</p>
<p>Following two baby deaths in prisons since 2019 there have been increasing concerns about safety for pregnant womenand their babies.</p>
<p>Of the 125 births for which additional data was supplied, one in seven babies had a low birth weight – double the rate in the general population. Stillbirths were at a rate of 20.9 per 1,000 births, compared with 4.2.</p>
<a>18-year-old was left to give birth alone in her cell.</a> Research shows one in 10 womenwho give birth during a prison stay do so there or on their way to hospital.
<p>Anita said: “Prison is simply not a safe place for pregnant women or children.”</p>
<p>Kate Paradine, chief executive of Women in Prison, said: “<a>When a parent goes to prison it disrupts children’s lives </a>and damages mental health, with nine in 10 children forced to leave their home when their mother is imprisoned.</p>
<p>“Homelessness, instability and trauma are just some of the consequences. Sentencing guidelines already acknowledge these devastating effects but there is clear evidence these aren’t being accurately or consistently applied.”</p>
<p>If amendments to the <a>police, crime, sentencing and courts bill </a>are passed, judges will be required to state how the best interests of a child or unborn baby are considered when sentencing a pregnant woman or primary carer.</p>
<p>“Currently the court looks at the woman in the dock and her children are invisible,” says Harriet Harman, Labour MP and chair of the joint committee on human rights<a>, </a>which drafted the amendments.</p>
<p>Harman, who oversaw a 2019 report on the the right to family life,said: “We have signed up to the rights of the child being paramount and yet we trample all over those rights when it comes to the children of women in prison.”</p>
<p>Responding to the data on stillbirths she said: “The findings are shocking and shaming but not surprising.”</p>
<p>Parkrun Australia will return nationwide for the first time in months next weekend when <a>vaccine mandates</a> in New South Wales are lifted.</p>
<p>NSW is the last state to restart the free weekly 5km runs, having been suspended since 19 June, after vaccine mandates in <a>Victoria</a> were clarified last month.</p>
<p>Parkrun <a>cancelled its Victorian schedule indefinitely</a> at the start of November after the event was listed under “physical recreation” and required all participants to be fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>But Victorian health authorities eventually gave it the green light to resume on 27 November with its existing Covid framework in place.</p>
<p>“There was a nice cheer that went up in the office when we found out we were coming back that weekend … people in <a>New South Wales</a> and Victoria have been affected by Covid restrictions enormously,” he said.</p>
<p>Megan Paton has attended the Kamay parkrun in Sydney for nine years “on and off”.</p>
<p>“I can’t wait,” she said of its long-anticipated return. “My family are so happy for it to come back so I can go. I’m very excited … there’s so many looking forward to it – just being able to see each other again.</p>
<p>“There’s people I would never have met but through parkrun we talk and chat, check in on how they’re going.” ”</p>
<p>Paton made herself go for runs during lockdown but said it “wasn’t the same”. </p>
<p>“It’s just not like being there with everyone and running a proper course…not just around my suburb,” she said.</p>
<a>began with 13 runners in London in 2004</a> and has
<a>since bloomed into a global phenomenon</a>.
<p>Turner said people had felt “less motivated” to be physically active during lockdowns while they were disconnected from their communities.</p>
<p>“Parkrun provides what people have been missing most,” he said. “It’s not about the run but that focal point with the community, to come every week and have support. It’s a one-hour escape from reality.”</p>
<p>An internal parkrun survey in October found 71% of respondents were motivated to take part in parkrun to feel part of a community, and 31% to feel less isolated. More than half said their mental health had suffered as a result of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Turner said the reopened runs in Victoria, which had been streamlined with more physically distanced volunteer roles, had been attended by many people who just came along to cheer others.</p>
<p>Under the Covid-safe plan in Victoria, volunteers must be fully vaccinated and record their vaccinations status but they do not need to check the status of runners. QR codes are provided at entrances.</p>
<p>“With 430 events around the country, we needed to make sure we worked closely as possible with landowners and public health to make sure all events are compliant and take place every week,” Turner said.</p>
<p>Some 6,000 walkers and runners took part in the first week back, alongside 900 volunteers. “It’s been overwhelming,” he said.</p>
<p>“A lot of people have been in tears. It’s been quite an emotional time for the 100 communities in Melbourne without parkrun for all of 2020.</p>
<p>“So many people use the term ‘parkrun family’ they haven’t seen for a long time, so getting back and having something resembling normality was a real sigh of relief.”</p>
<p>Turner said it wasn’t uncommon for health professionals to prescribe fun runs to patients struggling with mental health.</p>
<p>“Now we’re back, we’ve had an influx of health professionals across the board looking to have discussions with patients about how parkrun can help with current treatment plans,” he said.</p>
<p>“Parkrun isn’t about running, it’s about so many more things that benefit health and wellbeing in a fundamental way.”</p>
<p>Contact with nature in cities significantly reduces feelings of loneliness, according to a team of scientists.</p>
<p>Loneliness is a major public health concern, their research shows, and can raise a person’s risk of death by 45% – more than air pollution, obesity or alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>The study is the first to assess how the environment can affect loneliness. It used real-time data, collected via a smartphone app, rather than relying on people’s memory of how they were feeling.</p>
<p>The findings pointed to interventions to reduce loneliness, the researchers said: “Specific measures that increase social inclusion and contact with nature should be implemented, especially in densely populated cities.”</p>
<a>nature is known to boost wellbeing</a>, with
<a>published in the Scientific Reports journal</a>, collected data from urban citizens
<a>across the world</a> using the
<a>Urban Mind research app</a>. People were prompted at three random times a day for a fortnight, during waking hours, to answer simple questions on loneliness, overcrowding, social inclusion and contact with nature.
<p>More than 750 people provided 16,600 of these assessments, which included the questions “do you feel welcome among [the people around you]?” and “can you see trees right now?”.</p>
<p>“Familiarity with environments was not measured, but is likely to be at play as people tend to visit the same natural environments. Such familiarity has been linked with feeling more connected to a place, with possible mental health benefits.”</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, he had already begun to feel jaded: air travel made “the world everywhere look the same”.</p>
<ul> <li><p>Tell us: has your life taken a new direction after the age of 60? </p></li> </ul>
<p>And yet … both arguments were seemingly nonsense. They were based on a report called the Global Traffic Scorecard by a company called Inrix, which sells traffic data.</p>
<p>Even more of a puzzle was the idea of cycle lanes being at least partly responsible. The papers carried the same quotes, from an Inrix employee called Peter Lees.</p>
<p>Seemingly, it was straight from Lees, who was interviewed by PA Media, the news agency. PA included them on Sunday in an embargoed story, which was then picked up by the other outlets.</p>
<p>Holidayers dreaming of summer road trips have been veered off track by a spike in rental car prices up to double pre-pandemic rates.</p>
<p>But in place of car rentals, the humble train, bus and bicycle are also making a comeback. And rideshare services are capitalising on the steep prices.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get around without a rental:</p>
<p>There may be no better way to get to know the countryside of a foreign place than by train.</p>
<p>If you’re in the mood for adventure, a quintessential Queensland train journey starts in Cairns and drops you in Forsayth via the wet tropics of the Kuranda range and through the epic grassland of savannah country.</p>
<p>From there, it’s an easy bus to Cobbold Gorge. The outback rail experience departs Cairns weekly, with tours included.</p>
<p>The modern Prospector train is a little bit more refined – complete with a buffet, on-demand entertainment systems and air conditioning.</p>
<p>There’s nothing like your means of transport doubling as a form of exercise.</p>
<p>Keen cyclists would be hard-pressed to go past Victoria’s high country – Alpine territory of deep ravines, lush vineyards and quaint gold rush towns that boast half of the state’s recognised mountain bike trails.</p>
<p>Travelling by bike is often easier when combined with trains and buses for longer distances – but be sure to check ahead if they will carry your bike and whether you need to book.</p>
<p>Before cars, before trains, before planes, there were boats. Slow, sure. But scenic? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Unless you’re prone to sea sickness, the water is a magical way to travel and get to know Tasmania. A quarter of the island’s south-west is off-limits to vehicles, with some of its most beautiful features inaccessible unless by boat.</p>
<p>Bruny Island Cruises offer a simple way to reach the island from Hobart, with options for eco-wilderness tours, gourmet sightseeing and day trips.</p>
<p>Also starting in Hobart, it’s worth a quick hour-and-a-half bus to Triabunna to board the ferry to Maria Island, a national park boasting incredible views of the bay.</p>
<p>The newly launched Uber Reserve is one alternative to the expensive car rental market. It allows riders to reserve an Uber ride up to 30 days in advance in most major cities, complete with a locked-in upfront price.</p>
<p>For those desperate to drive, the company has also launched Uber Rent, which allows users to compare car hire options in certain areas.</p>
<p>Another notable car-share option includes Coseats, modelled off Europe’s successful BlaBlaCar. The website allows drivers to offer a seat in their car for an agreed price, whether travelling from Lightning Ridge to Lismore or Melbourne to Newcastle.</p>

<a>the wooded slopes of Gerês</a>. But the ups and downs of lockdown have left me craving something a little less wild. I feel a need for repose, not action.
<p>If my activity itch strikes, a stroll through the city park or a short bike ride along the old train line (now a cycle path) should scratch it.</p>

<a>Hill of Tara</a>, in Meath, also claims it. However, the Hill of Tara is as much the centre of Ireland as my house in east Belfast is.)
<p>On the way home, I have an urge to go by way of Annaghone in County Tyrone – the geographical centre of Northern Ireland. (I’ve searched Google images. It looks a bit … field-y.) </p>
<p>In both locations I’ll be sure to stick to the western approaches. Then next time anyone asks me where I stand on Ireland, I can say without hesitation, “left of centre”.Glenn Patterson</p>

<p>It was once home to literary and artistic greats including Oscar Wilde, but now Tite Street in west <a>London</a> has a new claim to fame after Halifax named it the most expensive street in England and Wales, with an average house price of £28.9m.</p>
<p>The mortgage lender said the top 10 priciest streets in 2021 were all in the capital, mainly in Westminster or the borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where Tite Street is situated. </p>
<p>However, its £28.9m average property price is 5% lower than the £30.5m recorded for the most expensive street a year ago – Avenue Road in London’s St John’s Wood.</p>
<a>is currently for sale</a> and has been reduced to £1.65m, according to property website Rightmove.

<a>lasting power of attorney</a> (LPA) has no routine identity checks or effective fraud controls. Labour said it was a “national scandal” and called for an urgent inquiry.
<p>The scheme is intended to help manage the affairs of those who are <a>vulnerable or seriously ill.</a> The stamped paper documents can be checked by organisations such as banks and investment firms against a national register.</p>
<p>But lawyers warned that a fraudster could submit a “complete work of fiction” to the government body overseeing the scheme, with falsified names and addresses, and be handed the legal document entitling them to take over the affairs of the victim.</p>
<p>There are estimated to be about 3m such documents in the official registry. It can take up to 40 days for an application for a Lasting Power of Attorney to be registered, and it costs £82.</p>
<p>In the case identified by You and Yours, the fraudster successfully obtained the LPA using falsified names and addresses. The victim’s signature was forged, and the date of birth for the victim was incorrect.</p>
<p>The fraudster is believed to have targeted the victim’s home because it was empty while she was away to look after her mother.</p>
<p>Shari Vahl, a reporter for You and Yours, said that the lasting power of attorney system was “wide open” to fraud.</p>
<p>An Office of the Public Guardian spokesperson said: “Abuse of lasting power of attorney is extremely rare but we intend to introduce more safeguards against fraud and misuse.”</p>
<p>The <a>You and Yours investigation</a> is on Radio 4 on 27 December at 12.18pm and will also be available on BBC Sounds.</p>
<p>There are plenty of flaws in the government’s cap proposals, but the one highlighted in your story is not one of them.David LipseyMember of the 1999 royal commission on long-term care, House of Lords</p>
<p>Name: The 60-year career.</p>
<p>Appearance: A long, slow, flat, miserable march to the grave.</p>
<p>Could we track back a little? Of course. The Stanford Centre on Longevity recently published research suggesting that as many as half of today’s five-year-olds in the US can expect to live to 100.</p>
<p>That’s great! May they have long and happy lives. Wait, you’re missing the point. A world full of 100-year-olds is a world full of pensioners.</p>
<p>What’s the alternative? Why, the 60-year career, of course. It’s like a normal career, but lasts 20 years longer.</p>
<p>How dare you? Hey, don’t be like that. Maybe there are upsides to spending 60 years of your life at work.</p>
<p>Like what? I don’t know. Maybe some people like their job.</p>
<p>I don’t understand. It’s one of Stanford’s ideas: smoothing out the work/life balance so you’re not run ragged in the throes of midlife.</p>
<p>So work longer, but work less? That’s it. Doesn’t it sound wonderful?</p>
<p>Not really. I want to do nothing from my 68th birthday onwards. Well, that isn’t going to work. The pension system is outdated. It was designed in an age when workers spent their lives toiling until they bled, then died of boredom at 65.</p>
<p>So I’m the bad guy for living longer? Yes, that’s right. You should feel ashamed.</p>
<p>Do say: “When you grow up, you can be anything you want to be.”</p>
<p>Don’t say: “As long as you’re prepared to do it until the age of 80.”</p>
<p>Buying a home can be a long and complex process, but typically it involves going through these steps:</p>
<h2>Find out how much you can borrow</h2>
<p>Decide what you are looking for in a property – whether you need parking and a garden, how many bedrooms you need, if it’s a flat, whether you want it to be freehold or leasehold – and pick an area on which to focus your search.</p>
<p>Consider what you want out of the location: are local schools, transport links and shops important to you? How long are you planning to live in the property for? Here are <a>10 things to think about before you rush into a property purchase</a>.</p>
<p>Bear in mind there are <a>lots of different property websites out there</a> you can use for your search – you don’t just have to use the big ones.</p>
<p>Don’t be shy about asking questions when you are looking around a property, or afterwards. The estate agent should be able to provide you with basic details about the property, and to pass on any other queries to the people who are selling.</p>
<p>If your offer is accepted, ask the estate agent to take the property off the market. You now need to instruct a solicitor. If you need to find a solicitor, ask for a few quotes and follow up personal recommendations.</p>
<p>Instruct your solicitor to start working on a contract. They will also send the seller a list of questions to answer, including a questionnaire asking which fixtures and fittings they intend to leave when they move out.</p>
<p>A good surveyor will talk to you before the survey to find out if you have any particular concerns and afterwards to highlight and explain any issues.</p>
<p>Read the survey when it arrives. If there are a lot of problems with the property and you are not happy to carry on with the purchase, then act quickly to let everyone know, before you incur any other costs.</p>
<p>If you do want to pursue the purchase, but the survey advises that you get quotes for work that needs doing, arrange for that to be done - you will need to talk to the estate agent to arrange access to the property.</p>
<p>If a lot of work needs doing, you may want to go back to the seller and renegotiate on the price you are paying for the property.</p>
