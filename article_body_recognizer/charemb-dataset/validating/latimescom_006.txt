<p>London is the eighth USC player to receive the honor and first since Marqise Lee in 2012.</p>
<p>London was one of two USC players to be selected to the All-Pac-12 first team along with defensive lineman Tuli Tuipulotu, while UCLA had three players chosen: wideout Kyle Philips, tight end Greg Dulcich and offensive lineman Sean Rhyan.</p>
<p>At the time of his injury, he led all Power Five receivers in yards and receptions and seemed assured of running away with the Biletnikoff Award, given to the nation’s top receiver.</p>
<p>London wound up only a semifinalist for that award. Yet the conference’s coaches, who vote on the All-Pac-12 teams, still believed London to be the best offensive player in the conference.</p>
<p>Only three other receivers have won the award. Of Washington’s Mario Bailey (1991) and USC’s Keyshawn Johnson (1995) and Lee, none played fewer than 11 games.</p>
<h1> Breaking down the USC roster Lincoln Riley inherits </h1>
<p>When Lincoln Riley first addressed the team he was set to inherit last week, the new <a>USC</a> coach’s message was clear: Everyone was being closely evaluated. And everything was about to change.</p>
<p>“But change is good,” senior defensive end Nick Figueroa said last week.</p>
<p>But while wholesale changes loom, here’s a preliminary look at where USC might stand once the dust finally settles:</p>
<a>Kedon Slovis</a> was seen as one of the Pac-12’s top passers, a potential Heisman candidate and a surefire first-round NFL draft selection. But since September, when freshman
<a>Jaxson Dart</a> stepped in for an injured Slovis and exploded with an extraordinary debut at
<a>Washington State</a>, it seemed only a matter of time before the baton was passed to USC’s electric freshman.
<a>Miller Moss</a>. Both will make their impassioned pleas in the coming months to open the Riley era as USC’s quarterback of the future, with Dart the overwhelming favorite to fill that role. But they may not be the only ones vying for the title.
<a>Keaontay Ingram</a> arrived from Texas as a transfer last spring. Ingram managed to reinvigorate a dismal USC run game, but as he weighs his future, the question now is whether he showed enough to convince scouts he deserves to be drafted.
<p>Senior Vavae Malepeai has made it clear he won’t return, but in his place, USC welcomes one of the nation’s most exciting prospects in Mater Dei all-purpose running back Raleek Brown, who could offer a spark right away next season.</p>
<div><p><a>USC Sports</a></p><p> <a>Lincoln Riley era can’t start soon enough for USC after season-ending loss to Cal</a> </p></div>
<p>USC football closed out its unremarkable season with a 24-14 loss to California in the final game before Lincoln Riley takes control as coach.</p>
<h2><b>Wide receivers/tight ends</b></h2>
<a>Drake London</a>, but the injured wideout is on his way to the NFL draft, where he’ll be a first-round pick. With London gone, there’s no obvious receiver to take over top billing in a new offense that asks a lot of its receivers.
<p>The line was supposed to be the strength of USC’s defense this past season. It didn’t exactly work out that way, but the cupboard is by no means bare.</p>
<div><p><a>Sports</a></p><p> <a>Commentary: College Football Playoff committee didn’t have to fret much over its final four</a> </p></div>
<p>Once Baylor beat Oklahoma State on Saturday, there was no doubt the playoff teams would be Alabama, Michigan, Georgia and Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Beyond Mauga, Riley will have to hope for a major leap from Raesjon Davis, who was the second-highest-rated recruit in USC’s last recruiting class, but barely played as a freshman.</p>

<h1> What is Medina Spirit’s legacy following his sudden death? The answer is uncertain </h1>
<div><div> By John CherwaSpecial Contributor </div></div>
<p>Few horses have had such a short yet newsworthy career as Medina Spirit. And, a day after his <a>sudden death after a workout at Santa Anita</a>, many are wondering how his story will eventually be told.</p>
<p>Will he be the underdog horse that brought trainer <a>Bob Baffert</a> his record-setting seventh Kentucky Derby win? Or will he be the second horse ever disqualified post-race in the 147-year history of the Derby?</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome, his 3-year-old life started with an unexpected meeting and ended with a tragic and unforeseen outcome.</p>
<p>Up next will be a necropsy, an autopsy performed on animals, which will zero in on the cause of his death Monday morning. Indications point to a cardiovascular event, but in this case, nothing will be left to guesswork.</p>
<p>Scott Chaney, executive director of the California Horse Racing Board, says this might be the most important necropsy the CHRB has ever commissioned, but he says it with a qualification.</p>
<p>“It certainly will be the most scrutinized, but every fatality is important,” Chaney said. “Sudden deaths are always more complicated and difficult than musculoskeletal ones.”</p>
<p>The body of Medina Spirit was shipped to the UC Davis laboratory in San Bernardino on Monday, while tissue, blood and urine samples were sent to the Maddy Lab at the main campus of UC Davis.</p>
<p>The necropsy will be receiving heightened attention including additional samples sent to labs outside of California, according to Jeff Blea, equine medical director of the CHRB.</p>
<div><p><a>Sports</a></p><p> <a>Bob Baffert attorney: Test proves Medina Spirit wasn’t injected with banned drug</a> </p></div>
<p>An attorney representing Bob Baffert says there is evidence Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit was given medication topically, not by injection.</p>
<p>One of those will be at the University of Minnesota, which has a specialty in cardiovascular diagnosis.</p>
<p>“We just have to rely on the science and the process,” Blea said.</p>
<p>There is no timetable for the results, but sudden death necropsies can take two to three months or longer.</p>
<p>While the answers will rest with the science, the future of the sport may well rest with finding a definitive cause of death as the industry and fans wrestle with the loss of one of its biggest stars, albeit one draped in controversy.</p>
<p>“Then all of a sudden, he hooks up with Gary Young, the [bloodstock] agent, and Taylor Made [Farm] and Frank Taylor. … They find this little horse. We looked at him, and, hey, we liked him.”</p>
<p>After the horse started training, he was gaining more attention than such a low purchase horse normally gets.</p>
<p>“I have him down at Los Alamitos,” Baffert recalled. “My assistant down there says, ‘You know that horse they didn’t give much for? I think he’s OK.” And sure enough he broke his maiden.”</p>
<div><p><a>Sports</a></p><p> <a>Medina Spirit gives Bob Baffert a record seventh win in Kentucky Derby</a> </p></div>
<p>Trainer Bob Baffert earns a record seventh Kentucky Derby win when Medina Spirit holds of Mandoulan for a victory in the 147th Running of the Roses.</p>
<p>How this plays out, and how Medina Spirit is remembered, will most likely be decided by scientists and lawyers. How the public will view things is much more complicated.</p>

<h1> With Drake and Justin Bieber co-signs, Long Beach’s Giveon looks to spin his RB into Grammy gold </h1>
<div><div> By August BrownStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>In July, the Long Beach singer Giveon played to tens of thousands at Lollapalooza in Chicago, the first festival of his short but ambitious RB career.</p>
<p>Whatever catharsis the crowd went looking for that weekend, they found it in his emotionally ransacked ballads.</p>
<p>That song is, by far, the biggest of Giveon’s fast rise in music — his debut EP just came out in 2020. But for RB fans, it’s a happy surprise to see a young singer with a striking timbre and era-spanning tastes glimpse pop stardom.</p>
<div><p><a>Music</a></p><p> <a>All bangers, all the time: Lil Nas X and Doja Cat steal the show at 2021 Jingle Ball</a> </p></div>
<p>At the annual radio conglom’s parade of pop stars, BTS got the most shrieks, while Doja Cat and Lil Nas X proved ready to headline arenas on their own.</p>
<a>Chicago Freestyle</a>” and sending his own “Heartbreak Anniversary” to No. 16.
<p>That single, a gorgeous breakup-fixation ballad with its <i>“Still got your things here / And they stare at me like souvenirs,”</i> is up for RB song this year. That more writer-centric award holds particular significance for him.</p>
<p>“If you take the music away and just read the lyrics, it could be a poem,” he said. “You’re not sure what decade it’s in, and songs like that will always be timeless.”</p>
<p>But “Peaches,” which hit No. 1, did two novel things at once for him.</p>
<p>Giveon grew up in Long Beach with two brothers and a single mom; he <a>wrestled</a> at Long Beach Polytechnic High School and discovered his vocal abilities at a Grammy Museum camp for young artists. </p>
<p>While his hometown might be canonically known for G-funk and gangsta rap, its mix of throwback and future-minded music left a deep impression on him as a teen. </p>
<p>“It’s notorious for Snoop Dogg, but a lot of people fail to realize it’s a duality. There’s a big eclectic art scene, and it’s a jazzy city as well, where I get a lot of my melodies and tone,” he said. </p>
<p>“When you see him on stage, you really think of him as a seasoned performer even though his repertoire is relatively new,” Rhone said. “The audience is singing the songs word-for-word.”</p>

<h1> HarperCollins drops Chris Cuomo’s book ‘Deep Denial’ after CNN firing </h1>

<p>HarperCollins is scrapping plans to publish a book by former CNN host Chris Cuomo about the Trump years and COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<div> <div> By Yvonne Villarreal, <div>Asal Ehsanipour </div></div> </div>
<a>“The White Lotus”</a> and what she wants from Season 2. Listen and read the transcript below:
<p><b>MARK OLSEN: </b>Hello! I’m Mark Olsen.</p>
<p><b>JENNIFER: </b>Hi, how are you? Hi. </p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>I’m talking of course about Jennifer Coolidge.</p>
<a>“Promising Young Woman.”</a> And of course, there’s her roles in the Christopher Guest films like “A Mighty Wind” or “Best In Show,” where she played this poodle owner who was married to a much, much older man.
<p><b>MARK OLSEN:</b>I mean, that may be her signature role.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Well, today Jennifer joins us to talk about her performance as Tanya McQuoid.</p>
<p><b>MARK OLSEN:</b>McQuoid.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>McQuoid. McQuoid. McQuoid. McQuoid? McQuoid, right?</p>
<p>[Archival clip from ‘The White Lotus’:</p>
<p><i>Armond: Is it Gaelic?</i>]</p>
<b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Yeah, I mean, what’s so interesting is that Jennifer didn’t end up in this role by accident.
<p>[Archival clip from “The White Lotus”:</p>
<p><i>Tanya: Just dealing with all of the logistics. It was just exhausting. And I’m still dealing with it.</i>]</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b> You give a really layered and complex performance that is both hilarious and vulnerable, but particularly in scenes opposite Natasha Rothwell, who plays Belinda, the spa manager at the resort.<b> </b></p>
<p><i>Tanya: I think it’s ‘cause I’m so close to the floor.</i>]</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Let’s talk about that dynamic between them. What fascinated you about their relationship?</p>
<p><i>Tanya: I can’t get rid of this really empty feeling. I want… I want someone to figure it out for me.</i>]</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Right.</p>
<p><b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>And just got caught up.</p>
<p><i>Tanya: And feel the newness of each moment.</i>]</p>
<p><b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>Somehow it was the most pure environment I’ve ever been able to have on an acting job. Just for me, it was just a huge advantage. I don’t know if I’ll ever have that again.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Well, you were just talking about grief, and there’s a scene where you’re giving a very uncomfortable yet painfully vulnerable eulogy for your dead mother during a boat ride with, you know, a bunch of strangers.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>It felt so real and spur of the moment, and I know the boat ride itself was a challenge for you. I think you got seasick. What was it like for you playing that scene and like, did you do any improv during it?</p>
<p><b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>The actual eulogy was 100% written by Mike White. But the other parts on the boat, like, you know, all the throwing the ashes and things like the stuff I added while throwing the ashes … that was improv’d.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Wow.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL:</b>It sounds really rough. I mean, a huge part of why it resonated, your depiction of grief, it just felt so raw. And you touched on this earlier, but tell me more about what you were drawing from when playing Tanya.</p>
<p><b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>Yes. For some reason, the COVID thing made it all feel very fresh. But, you know ...I’m really sorry to hear that about your dad.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>No, I mean, I’m sorry to hear about your mom. It’s like that thing of … I thought it would happen a lot later in life. You’re never prepared. But it’s life, I guess. You know what I mean?</p>
<p>[Archival clip from “Shine”: <i>(piano from the film’s closing piano scene)</i>]</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b> And it can be like a slippery slope of how not to stay in that state of mind. Like how to pull yourself out of it.</p>
<p><b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>Right, right.</p>
<p><b>Yvonne: </b>Not easy. </p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Well, wedon’t know much about you outside of the characters you usually play, and I’ve always been curious. Can you tell me about the younger Jennifer Coolidge? About your childhood? What were you like?</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Huh.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>I’ve read in other interviews, you know, that before you made it in the arts, you described yourself in your 20s as being a mess. You were working at a restaurant in New York, but you hardly worked your shifts.</p>
<p><b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>Yeah.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Tell me more about that time in your life.</p>
<b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>Well, those were the years that I was living in New York City and I was telling people I was an actress, but I was really a waitress.
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b> How do you make sense of that time in your 20s, you know, looking back on it? How did you pull yourself out of that? Like, what was your rock bottom?</p>
<p><b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>Well, I think, you know, if you’re drinking, I don’t know if you like, figure out you’re an alcoholic ’til later.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Mm-hmm.</p>
<b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>In other words, drugs are in some weird way a gift because your addiction is sped up so quickly that like … you know you hit your bottom. I hit my bottom at 27. ...
<b/> Thank God for cocaine, it all came to a head at 27. And I sort of went to rehab, and then I actually was able to refocus my life. And in some ways my life became so simple.
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>What sort of reflection happened in your time in rehab? Like, did you set some goals for yourself while doing work on yourself in rehab?</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b><b/> Was there a time you doubted whether you’d make it in the industry?</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>You’ve said publicly before that you wanted to be a dramatic actress like Meryl Streep. How did you find your way into comedy?</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Did it feel more natural for you?</p>
<b> </b> I feel like I could have looked like Fred Flintstone and people would be like, “I love Stifler’s mom” because the build-up was good.
<p>I almost blew it. I almost didn’t take that job. And how bummed I would have been if I had stuck to my stupid way of thinking. But I really didn’t want to do the job because I had eaten so many vegan pizzas over COVID.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Was it hard sort of getting out of your head about that?</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>You were going to find a way out.</p>
<p><b>JENNIFER COOLIDGE: </b>Well, I hope she’s less sad. I hope she has some love and sex and stuff. I hope she gets all kinds of, you know, male attention.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Me too. Do you think she reconnects with Belinda?</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b> Starting out in Hollywood or even later in your career, have you had somebody that, you know, where it was empty promises?</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>Give me the names, Jennifer.</p>
<p><b>YVONNE VILLARREAL: </b>That’s it from us here at “The Envelope”! I’m your host, Yvonne Villarreal.</p>

<div> <div> By James RaineyStaff Writer </div> <div> <div> Photography by <div>Francine Orr</div></div> </div> </div>
<p>Maurine Kornfeld stood on the deck of the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center and, smiling over her teammates, warbled her response: “Thank you, all. Thank you, all,” she sang. “Thank you, swim friends. Thank you, all!”</p>
<p>Fellow swimmers marvel at the aquatic prowess of a woman who didn’t begin serious swimming until she turned 60. But they’re even more smitten by Mo, the teammate and friend, who acknowledges their lives, hopes and cares.</p>
<p>Kornfeld swims regularly at pools in Glendale and Sherman Oaks, along with the Pasadena masters team, which she competes for in meets around the world. Swimmers at each of those pools claim her as their own.</p>
<p>“It’s like you’ve become pool-ygamous,” said Nancy Niebrugge, a Rose Bowl swimmer and friend. Sitting in the hot tub after Saturday’s 6:30 am workout, Kornfeld threw her head back and laughed.</p>
<p>Kornfeld’s journey began in Great Falls, Mont., during the administration of President Warren G. Harding. Her father owned a menswear shop and her mom raised two Kornfeld boys and their sprightly sister.</p>
<p>Unusual for women in her day, Kornfeld went away to college. At the University of Chicago, she found no end to the intellectual stimulation.</p>
<p>“It was rubbing minds with some of the best and brightest,” Kornfeld said, a few years back, of the university she would support for decades to follow. “I mean, what wouldn’t be exciting?”</p>
<p>After getting bachelor’s and master’s degrees in social work, she moved to Los Angeles, where she launched a long career as a social worker — serving the L.A. Unified School District and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, among others.</p>
<p>Her first coach had to cajole her to swim with her head down. Soon, coach Dom Neefe had her not only streamlining but swimming in meets — and winning.</p>
<p>When teammates made it clear they wouldn’t let her 100th pass without a party, Mighty Mo insisted on a low-key affair.</p>
<p>Chad Durieux, a 42-year-old Canadian who has coached the Rose Bowl team for 16 years, is moving to Japan with his wife and two kids, a significant change for the coach and the team of 250 swimmers.</p>
<p>The rules of the sport (for races measured in meters) mean that Kornfeld qualified to swim in the 100-to-104 age bracket as of Jan. 1. Swimming in freestyle and backstroke events this summer, she bagged six more world records.</p>
<p>Kornfeld reacts to the achievements and the attendant acclaim with aplomb.</p>
<p>“There’s no boasting. She is just like, ‘I got my best time and I got a record. That’s nice,’ “ said Durieux. “It’s a totally different perspective than a lot of the younger kids.”</p>
<p>If she has learned anything in 10 decades, it’s to not be too cocksure of anything. She doesn’t proselytize, including on questions of longevity.</p>
<p>Simmons visited Kornfeld recently at the cozy Hollywood bungalow where she has lived for decades. She was certain about all the gifts she didn’t want or need.</p>
<p>The centenarian-in-waiting gestured at the abundance of keepsakes and thriving plants around her.</p>
<p>“Look around you,” she told her friend. “I have everything I need.”</p>

<div> <div> By J. Brady McColloughStaff Writer </div> </div>
<p>The price of oil was showing strength at over $100 per barrel, which created a hopeful mood as the University of Oklahoma board of regents met in June 2014.</p>
<p>All of this had been put into motion years before anyone knew <a>Lincoln Riley’s name</a>.</p>
<p>Given the passion he poured into the project, it just didn’t feel right that he would never work a day in his new office.</p>
<p>The young man must have been eternally grateful. Stoops had picked Riley out of East Carolina to rejuvenate his offense two years prior. The kid had been an instant success — but so successful he should be trusted with the entire enterprise?</p>
<p>The Sooner faithful did not know much about Riley, the outsider from West Texas, but they knew the only important thing: Bob said Lincoln was the right man for the job.</p>
<p>Four and a half years later on a Wednesday afternoon, the Oklahoma head coach’s office sits without a permanent occupant. A sign at the front of the red-brick building says it is closed to the public until further notice.</p>
<p>In the yard that welcomes visitors to the Switzer Center, a landscaping crew is raking up fallen maple leaves and removing yellowed shrubbery, one last cleansing before what is certain to be a long winter.</p>
<p>But in the middle of the afternoon, Riley’s decision to jump to USC leaked to reporters. Bob Stoops got a call during what was supposed to be a pleasant round of golf.</p>
<p><a>Tyler McComas</a>, who hosts a daily radio show focusing on all things Sooners, was spending time with his wife, relieved the football season was over, when he got a text from a friend that said, “Bummer about Lincoln.”</p>
<p>Within a few hours, McComas was doing an emergency show that would shatter the station’s high mark for listeners.</p>
<p>“He walked into the Taj Mahal of Oklahoma football,” says <a>Carey Murdock</a>, who runs <a>Sooner Scoop, OU’s Rivals site</a>.</p>

<p>USC sent shock waves through the sports world when it hired Oklahoma’s Lincoln Riley as its football coach. Here’s everything you need to know about Riley.</p>
<p>And yet, there Riley was early Monday morning, boarding a private jet with USC officials, his wife, Caitlin, and two daughters, Sloan and Stella, and four key Oklahoma staff members.</p>
<p>Around the time the flight to Los Angeles took off, as the sky turned pink with the sunrise, two large signs reading “TRAITOR” were hung on campus monuments. In the five stages of grief, many Sooners had skipped straight to anger.</p>
<a>#Sooners</a> for USC job.Pics grabbed by
<p>On Monday afternoon, Oklahoma called a news conference and leaned on none other than Bob Stoops, who had taken over as the interim head coach, to issue a unifying message to the fan base: It’s the players who make OU football, not the coach.</p>
<p>He would not address much about his feelings about Riley.</p>
<p>“You know, disappointed? Sure,” he said. “The rest of it, that will be between Lincoln and I personally, as it should be.”</p>
<p>Monday’s public flogging was rough for Riley’s tight circle of friends in Norman. He didn’t let many people in, but OU golf coach <a>Ryan Hybl</a> was one of them, as they bonded over their love of the links.</p>
<p>Hybl watched Lincoln’s introduction to L.A. from his office desktop computer and was moved when Riley had to pause, seemingly holding back tears, at his first mention of Oklahoma.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot I could feel through my screen,” Hybl says. “He knows what just happened. He’s still got a big heart, and he loves this place. There’s no act going on there.”</p>
<p>Hybl understood that most Sooners won’t share that sentiment. Around town, the suggestion was being made that Riley is now in the perfect place to improve his thespian abilities.</p>
<a>Cowboys to a win in Super Bowl XXX</a>, the sway of the legendary Oklahoma head coach extended far beyond Norman, where he led the Sooners to three national championships.
<div><p><a>USC Sports</a></p><p> <a>The 12 hours that transformed USC football: How the Lincoln Riley deal went down</a> </p></div>
<p>Patience and a well-timed recruiting pitch helped USC lure Lincoln Riley away from Oklahoma, sending shockwaves through the college football world.</p>
<p>“Lincoln is the first Oklahoma coach to leave for another school since 1947,” Switzer says, sitting in his office surrounded by his three German Shepherds, Panzer, Saber and Jazz, and his yellow lab, Bella.</p>
<p>It was Jim Tatum who left OU for Maryland. His assistant coach, Bud Wilkinson, took over, starting OU’s postwar dynasty with the school’s first three national championships.</p>
<p>Switzer is 84 years young. His main source of competition now is seeing if he can cook up a better Christmas light display than his son-in-law across the street, but he does keep close tabs on OU football.</p>
<p>Switzer, like everyone besides Riley, doesn’t know why he bolted. But he is confident it isn’t about money.</p>
<p>“I just wonder,” Switzer says, “did he give Oklahoma a chance to sit down and negotiate with him? I don’t think he did. I think he just made a decision and Oklahoma didn’t have a chance to counter.”</p>
<p>Switzer continues, “He’s had success recruiting out there, so why not keep all of them home? Oklahoma’s got 3 million people. What’s L.A. got? It’s a numbers game.”</p>
<p>Asked about the staggering sums of money being thrown around to lure coaches the last few weeks, Switzer provides a history lesson to add perspective.</p>
<p>He finds it ironic that OU fans, mere months after the school ditched the Big 12 for the Southeastern Conference in clandestine fashion, could fault a coach for switching schools.</p>
<p>“Can’t criticize one without looking at the other,” he says.</p>
<p>“Good riddance,” said sports talk radio host Jim Traber Wednesday afternoon. “No scruples. No integrity. He’s got one dude recruiting for both teams. Sleaziest thing I’ve seen in college football in a long time.”</p>
<p>“I wish him lots of traffic, losses, smog, high taxes,” said another voice. “Someday he’s gonna be sitting in traffic and go, ‘Was it worth it?’ ”</p>
<div><p><a>USC Sports</a></p><p> <a>Commentary: Matt Leinart, USC revel in the Lincoln Riley hire: ‘This is the happiest I’ve been’</a> </p></div>
<p>Mike Bohn understood how much USC fans yearned for a coach capable of returning the team to its glory days when he pursued Lincoln Riley.</p>
<p>Each day, Tyler McComas’ show continues to set new records.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s on edge,” McComas says. “Normal, everyday people are like, ‘I can’t sleep, I’ll wake up in the middle of the night, and I’m so upset about Lincoln.’ ”</p>
<p>The reminders of the pain were inescapable.</p>
<p>Few in Norman felt like they got know Riley. The consensus was that he was friendly yet guarded. He cut down on media access to the program when he took over, turning Oklahoma into one of the most closed-off teams in the country.</p>
<p>“He takes himself very seriously,” Murdock says.</p>
<p>“He’s a private person, and I actually think you can be a little bit more private in L.A., as odd as that may sound, because there’s so many people,” Hybl says.</p>
<p>Maybe if Riley had ingratiated himself in the community, he would have gotten more benefit of the doubt. Or maybe there was never going to be a clean exit from a place as football-obsessed as Norman.</p>

<p>USC shocked the college football world by luring Lincoln Riley away from Oklahoma. We break down the pros and the few cons of the Trojans’ big hire.</p>
<p>Would the Rileys have invested in building an exorbitant mansion in the middle of Oklahoma if they had one foot out the door and had a hunch they would soon be selling it?</p>
<p>The legends here are immortalized in bronze. That path was handed to Lincoln Riley and he spurned it, but it must be remembered he is only 38, with a whole football life in front of him.</p>

<h1> Armed robbers break into Palisades home during holiday party </h1>
<div><div> By Laura NewberryStaff Writer </div></div>
<p>An outdoor holiday party in the Pacific Palisades came to a crashing halt Friday night when two armed robbers broke into the residence and stripped guests of jewelry, phones and a watch, according to the homeowners. </p>
<p>The robbery happened on the 1200 block of Rimmer Avenue at around 7:40 p.m., the Los Angeles Police Department said. </p>
<p>“It’s more frustrating than it is scary,” the owner told The Times. “I feel lucky that no one got hurt.” The victims of the robbery, however, were quite shaken, he said. </p>
<p>An LAPD public information officer who declined to provide his full name said the suspects fled the scene by the time police arrived. The spokesman had no information on whether the suspects had been identified or apprehended, he said.</p>
<div><div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Brutal, brazen crimes shake L.A., leaving city at a crossroads</a> </p></div><p>A string of incidents at private homes and public spaces has catapulted crime in Los Angeles back into the zeitgeist.</p></div>
<p>The homeowner said he has attempted to contact the LAPD multiple times to turn over security footage — which shows the suspects walking through the front door — but has been unable to reach the department. </p>
<p>“A detective was supposed to call the women who were robbed, but that hasn’t happened yet, either,” he said. </p>
<p>The robbery is one in a <a>recent wave of property crime</a> in affluent areas of Los Angeles, including upticks in robberies in upscale corridors like Melrose Avenue and a spate of <a>follow-home robberies</a> on the Westside. </p>
<p>Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore announced Tuesday that he is setting up a task force to apprehend follow-home robbers, saying the department has not seen violent hold-ups “like this in decades.”</p>
<p>The trend, which has <a>targeted celebrities</a> and <a>upscale restaurants</a> in recent months, turned deadly early Tuesday morning when a man was shot and killed during an attempted robbery outside Bossa Nova restaurant in Hollywood. </p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Celebrities among those targeted in spate of follow-home robberies, LAPD says</a> </p></div>
<p>The LAPD says robbers are following people home to break into their houses; recent targets include Terrence Jenkins and Dorit Kemsley.</p>
<a>Jacqueline Avant</a> was shot dead in her Trousdale Estates home. Police linked the crime to the arrest of a 29-year-old Los Angeles man with a lengthy criminal record on suspicion of burglary and robbery.
<p>While robberies are up 3.2% this year citywide compared with 2020 — but down compared with 2019 — the more alarming trend is that suspects are more often using firearms, Moore told Los Angeles Police commissioners. </p>
<p>Violent crime in L.A., however, has notably increased. Homicides are up 46.7% compared with 2019, while shooting victims are up 51.4%, according to police data.</p>

<h1> Column: Parents of ex-Mater Dei football player share new details of attack, school response </h1>
<div><div> By Bill PlaschkeColumnist </div></div>
<p>He didn’t want his Mater Dei teammates to soak his locker in urine.</p>
<p>The 170-pound football player told his parents the fear of retribution prompted him to agree to fight a more experienced 235-pound teammate in the middle of a Mater Dei locker room.</p>
<p>He had seen the bullying, the teasing, the name-calling and, worst of all, he had seen the lockers of outcasts drenched in urine. He didn’t want to risk enduring that abuse. This was his ticket to acceptance.</p>
<div><p><a>High School Sports</a></p><p> <a>Lawsuit: Ex-Mater Dei football player alleges hazing led to brain injury</a> </p></div>
<p>Mater Dei High’s elite football program is home to a culture of hazing that led to a player’s traumatic brain injury, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday.</p>
<p>What happened next led to a lawsuit that has shined a light on the shrouded practices of one of the most celebrated high school football programs in America.</p>
<a>filed a lawsuit against Mater Dei</a> and the Diocese of Orange, alleging the Mater Dei administration covered up the
<a> incident</a>. When the lawsuit was made public last week, the Santa Ana school of 2,149 students found itself in the middle of public outcry that elicited the school president’s bold
<a>promise of an independent investigation</a>, a public explanation from the Orange County district attorney about his failure to press charges and a statement from the California Interscholastic Federation abdicating oversight.
<p>Seemingly everybody had chimed in except the people most closely involved.</p>
<p>“Willingness has nothing to do with being hazed, you can be willing and be hazed. I pledged a fraternity and the things I allowed them to do to me still was hazing. I did it willfully because I wanted to belong.”</p>
<p>Father of Player One, who has sued Mater Dei High School</p>
<p>His father talked solemnly about weeping when he saw his son’s battered face after the fight. His mother talked tearfully about staying up all night while applying ice to her son’s bruised head.</p>
<div><p><a>High School Sports</a></p><p> <a>Mater Dei announces independent investigation, other changes after hazing allegations</a> </p></div>
<p>Mater Dei’s president announced multiple reviews of the school’s athletic program and policies in response to hazing allegations raised in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>The Times sent a Mater Dei spokeswoman detailed questions about the parents’ statements and she declined interview requests, instead providing the following statement: </p>
<p>For Player One’s parents, it is also a human matter. Hearing their pain makes clear that what is now a full-blown school crisis could have been mitigated if the school had responded differently to the family’s concerns. </p>
<div> <div> <blockquote> <p>“My son’s face looked like Larry Holmes after 15 rounds. My kid was beat to hell.”</p> </blockquote> <p>Father of Player One, who filed a hazing lawsuit against Mater Dei High School</p> </div> </div>
<p>The family stated in the lawsuit it only received calls of sympathy after the father phoned the school and demanded someone show some compassion for their son. Principal Frances Clare never called, the family said. </p>
<p>The minute his father saw his son sitting on a training table under an outdoor tent, he knew the sink story was a lie. </p>
<p>“My son’s face looked like Larry Holmes after 15 rounds,” he said. “My kid was beat to hell.”</p>
<p>The Times sent questions for Anderson to a Mater Dei spokesperson and the school declined to comment beyond the general statement. </p>
<div><p><a>High School Sports</a></p><p> <a>Plaschke: Mater Dei must make changes after video exposes football program culture of hazing</a> </p></div>
<p>It’s difficult to understand why Mater Dei coach Bruce Rollinson and principal Frances Clare still have jobs after video exposes hazing within team.</p>
<p>“They have no right to gamble with my son’s life,” said his father. </p>
<p>“He had never been in a fight in his life,” said his father. “I don’t think he had ever been in a loud argument.”</p>
<p>Player Two was not made available for comment, but the father of Player Two responded to the allegations through his attorney David Nisson.</p>
<p>“Two things irked us about that call,” said the father. “The coach acknowledged the game. And because of the other kid’s father, the coach was in a bind?”</p>
<p>Rollinson has declined multiple Times requests for comment, including an in-person inquiry after Mater Dei won a Division 1 championship game on Nov. 26.</p>
<p>As for allegations of a cover-up, “The father said they did an extremely thorough investigation, there’s no evidence of a cover-up,” Nisson said.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Let’s have a meeting,’’’ recalled the father.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Orange County D.A. candidate calls for more scrutiny of coach in Mater Dei hazing allegations</a> </p></div>
<p>At the time, their son wasn’t doing great. The traumatic brain injury had initially left him with slurred speech and limited memory, and he was facing an hourlong reconstructive nose surgery.</p>
<p>“I told the police, ‘My son was assaulted at the school, the school was not being cooperative, and we feel like a crime was committed,’” said the father.</p>
<p>The father said Santa Ana police recommended filing felony battery charges, but the Orange County District Attorney’s office declined because it deemed the fight as mutual combat.</p>
<p>The parents of Player One understood Spitzer’s position but were disappointed in the assertion that because their son was throwing punches, he was not being hazed.</p>
<div><p><a>California</a></p><p> <a>Column: ‘Why does Mater Dei protect bullies?’ A school and Orange County diocese have lots to answer for </a> </p></div>
<p>A high school student gets assaulted. Their innocence is shattered; their lives, forever changed.</p>
<p>Also released this week was an open letter from Mater Dei’s president, Father Walter Jenkins, in which he pledged a full independent investigation.</p>
<p>“Mater Dei High School will engage an outside and independent firm to investigate student safety practices specifically within our athletic programs,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The parents of Player One are not convinced.</p>
<p>He said the family eventually decided to sue in hopes of effecting real changes in the school’s athletic culture.</p>
<p>Two weeks after the incident, Player One transferred to another school. </p>
<p>The mother of Player One, who filed a lawsuit against Mater Dei High School</p>
<p>“For me, as a parent, that’s when I knew,” said Player One’s mother, weeping. “They wanted to mess with our family in a way I didn’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Doctors have medically cleared him for everything,” said his father. “We were concerned about it but we want to support his decision to get back to a sense of normalcy as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>A month after the fight, after the family said school officials had repeatedly told them there was no video, they were given a copy of the two videos from law enforcement. </p>
<p>The mother won’t watch them. The father tore apart his office when he watched them.</p>
<p>“I was throwing chairs, punching cabinets, screaming at the top of my lungs, I lost it,” he said, tears streaming down his cheeks at the memory. “That last punch…”</p>
<p>He was particularly enraged by a student using a racial epithet while urging Player Two to attack his son in a video viewed by The Times.</p>
<p>“Get that [N-word,]” the student roars at Player One, who is white. “Get that [N-word] ... Get that [N-word] ... Get that [N-word] ... Get that [N-word].”</p>
<p>The father of Player One said the words still live in his mind, an eternal soundtrack to an episode that will haunt him forever.</p>
<p>“It’s nasty, it’s evil and angry and hateful,” said the father. “Where is the supervision? Where is the culture?”</p>
<p>As the storm clouds build around Mater Dei’s crisis of character, those are all questions yet unanswered.</p>

<h1> Coronavirus Today: As Omicron arrives, perhaps ‘we should be rooting for Delta’ </h1>
<div><div> By Karen KaplanScience and Medicine Editor </div></div>
<p>Good evening. I’m <b>Karen Kaplan</b>, and it’s <b>Friday, Dec. 3</b>. Here’s the latest on what’s happening with the coronavirus in California and beyond.</p>
<p>Well, <b>that didn’t take long</b>.</p>
<b>brought the Omicron variant onto U.S. soil</b> as
<a>an unwelcome souvenir of a trip to South Africa</a>.
<b>routinely sequences the genomes of samples to keep track of the variants circulating</b> in the community.
<b>,”</b> L.A. County health officials said in a statement.
<p>“A small number of close contacts in Los Angeles have been identified and, to date, <b>all have tested negative and have no symptoms</b>,” the statement added.</p>
<p>There have been no signs that either patient has touched off a larger outbreak, and state officials said they didn’t think Omicron’s presence would require them to reimpose lockdowns or other restrictions. </p>
<p>“There’s <b>more panic than information around this new variant</b>,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said Wednesday. “And that just means we have to keep our mind open but maintain our vigilance.”</p>
<p>The county also said it would ask skilled nursing facilities to step up their routine tests of residents and staff.</p>
<p><b>Expanded testing is one of the primary pillars</b> of a winter response plan <a>Biden unveiled Thursday</a>.</p>
<b>Those who are insured can get reimbursed for the full cost of tests</b> they purchase.
<b>past infections offered less protection against Omicron than they did against Delta</b>,
<a>they don’t think the same is true for vaccines</a>. The shots, however, only work if people take full advantage of them.
<p><a>Scientists are well-positioned</a> to keep track of Omicron now that the country has <b>stepped up its coronavirus sequencing efforts</b>. </p>
<p>Adding in the work of other labs, including some run by the CDC, <b>the U.S. is sequencing 40,000 to 80,000 specimens a week</b>. That amounts to 5% to 10% of all samples — roughly in line with the efforts of other nations.</p>
<p>“We’re in a much, much better place than a year ago or even six or nine months ago,” said Kenny Beckman of the University of Minnesota, who directs a genomics lab that sequences about 1,000 samples a week.</p>
<p>That increased surveillance should help scientists <a>answer a crucial question</a>: <b>Does the Omicron variant have what it takes to overtake Delta? </b></p>
<p>If it doesn’t, there’ll be little reason to worry about what Omicron’s many mutations allow it to do. </p>
<p>“Beta was squelched out by Delta,” said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College. “That could happen to Omicron.”</p>
<b>Delta does not have a stranglehold on Africa like it does on the U.S.</b>, and it’s possible Omicron is gaining ground there at the expense of the Alpha and Beta variants, Moore said.
<p>Delta hasn’t exactly been kind to Americans, racking up a six-figure death toll already and killing about 6,000 more of us each week. But at least we know that vaccines offer strong protection against serious illness and death. </p>
<p>“We should be rooting for Delta,” Moore said. “Better the devil you know than the devil you don’t.”</p>

<h2>Standing up for freedom or ‘looking to kill people’?</h2>
<p>California’s <a>COVID-19 vaccine mandate for healthcare workers</a> was harder to take. And when the state declared that children would have to get a COVID-19 vaccine <a>as a condition of coming to school</a>, it <b>was simply too much</b>.</p>
<b>have Oroville declare itself a constitutional republic</b>. As such, it would not enforce any federal or state order that it deemed to be in violation of its citizens’ constitutional rights,
<a>my colleague Hailey Branson-Potts reported</a>.
<b>Thomson was not the only council member who didn’t like being told what to do</b>. The declaration passed by a vote of 6 to 1. (You can watch the debate
<a>here</a>, beginning at 41:14.) When the final vote lighted up on a screen in the council chambers, members of the public whooped and clapped.
<p>Not everyone was celebrating, however. An older man who attended the meeting expressed his concern that “these ‘constitutional republic’ people would probably prevent mask mandates.” </p>
<p><b>“In other words,” he said, “they’re looking to kill people.”</b></p>
<p>But that was a minority view. Indeed, the local vaccination rate may be viewed as evidence of the public’s resistance to government edicts. </p>
<a>according to the Times Tracker</a>. Those numbers are well below the statewide figures of 72.3% and 64.5%, respectively.
<b>Oroville isn’t the first California city to get creative in expressing its exasperation with pandemic rules.</b> Atwater, in Merced County, declared itself a “
<a>sanctuary city for business</a>” last year when statewide stay-at-home orders were in effect. Coalinga, in Fresno County, deemed all of its businesses essential.
<p>Those stands were more than symbolic — they <a>cost the towns hundreds of thousands of dollars</a> in emergency COVID-19 funds. Not incidentally, coronavirus cases surged as well.</p>
<b>Oroville is now dealing with relatively high case rates.</b> In the last two weeks, the town averaged
<a>89 new coronavirus cases</a> per 10,000 residents. By contrast, downtown Los Angeles averaged
<a>27 cases per 10,000 residents</a> during that time, and San Francisco’s Sunset District averaged just
<p>But, Thomson said, there’s a difference between choosing to protect yourself and having rules thrust upon you: “OK, now you’re, in my opinion, crossing the line.”</p>
<h2>California’s vaccination progress</h2>
<p><b>See the latest on California’s vaccination progress <u><a>with our tracker</a></u>. </b></p>
<p>COVID-19 vaccines have been a contentious issue in San Diego County. Although nearly 83% of residents there are at least partially vaccinated and almost 70% are fully vaccinated, <b>some of the holdouts are digging in</b>.</p>
<p>So on Monday, the San Diego City Council voted 8 to 1 — twice — to <a>move forward with its vaccine mandate</a>. <b>Those who don’t comply by the end of December will face termination</b>. </p>
<p>“The way out of this pandemic is through vaccines,” Mayor Todd Gloria said, “and the city of San Diego should lead by example.”</p>
<p>Exemptions are available for medical or religious reasons, and the city has received at least 394 of them. More than 40% were from police officers. Overall, about 2,000 city workers are still unvaccinated.</p>
<b>A vaccine mandate for students in San Diego Unified School District</b> has been
<a>it is working on a way</a> to
<b>allow unvaccinated students to keep attending classes in person</b> — despite
<a>a statewide requirement</a> that they get vaccinated against COVID-19 if they want to come to campus.
<p>Alpine Union has a history of leniency. It was the first district in San Diego County to reopen last year, and it tried — unsuccessfully — to defy the state’s indoor mask mandate for all students and teachers.</p>
<b>an off-campus location where unvaccinated students can learn together</b> from teachers in the district. The goal would be to keep the school day as normal as possible for these students, Supt. Rich Newman explained.
<p>Newman insisted he wasn’t playing politics by pursuing the off-site academy. In fact, he said, not only is he fully vaccinated, but he’s also received a booster shot.</p>
<b>They’re caught in the middle of a political environment right now</b>.”
<a>there’s this</a>: The Sheriff’s Department said
<b>moved into full lockdown mode</b>. That means incarcerated people can’t visit with relatives, friends or their attorneys. Instead, they must remain in their cells for up to 23 hours a day.
<p>Speaking of outbreaks, <a>Amazon has been accused</a> of <b>providing “misleading or grossly incomplete” information</b> about the number of coronavirus infections its employees may have picked up in its U.S. facilities. </p>
<b>The company’s filings suggest not a single one of them was work-related.</b>
<p>“That defies science and logic,” said Eric Frumin, the center’s health and safety director. He called on the federal government to investigate the company.</p>

<b>three days before he shared a debate stage in Cleveland with his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden</b>.
<b>Trump took that as “full permission to press on as if nothing had happened,” Meadows wrote. </b>He attended a variety of public functions before the debate.
<p>Three days later, he announced in a tweet that both he and wife Melania <a>had tested positive</a> for infections. The then-president was admitted to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center later that day.</p>
<a>a scary number</a> from Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister: 1%. That’s the percentage of the country’s residents who are
<b>currently infected with the coronavirus</b>. If Americans were impacted at the same rate, that would translate into more than 3.3 million active infections.
<h2>Your questions answered</h2>
<p>Today’s question comes from readers who want to know: <b>Where did the Omicron variant come from? </b></p>
<a>warning of such a scenario</a> for months, my colleague Melissa Healy reports. Indeed, it’s been
<a>exactly a year</a> since doctors published a report on the so-called Boston patient, a 45-year-old man with
<a>a rare autoimmune disorder</a> who battled COVID-19 for 154 days before he died of the disease. During that time, the coronavirus in his body racked up dozens of genetic changes.
<p>These people could “become a factory of variants for the whole world,” said Tulio De Oliveira, the South African scientist who detected the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>Other researchers agreed with that assessment, including Dr. Jonathan Li, a Harvard infectious-diseases specialist who treated the Boston patient.</p>
<p>“If I had to guess, I would say this is likely how Omicron came about,” Li said.</p>

<div> <div> By Karen GarciaStaff Writer </div> </div>
<p>“A lot of impostor syndrome came into play, and I would often feel stressed out and anxious. I would call my parents and tell them, ‘I’m so done with this’ and just have one of those breakdowns,” she said. </p>
<p>“A lot of it was because I was put on a pedestal for a very long time due to being the first born and having so much responsibility,” Gonzalez said. </p>
<p>As the oldest of four children, Gonzalez’s dad referred to her as the leader of the pack. She set the standard for what her siblings could achieve academically and personally. She describes herself as the advocate for her family. </p>

<p>There are differing definitions of who is considered “first generation,” often dependent on whether they are born outside the U.S. or have citizenship. But Gonzalez and others are bonding over a shared experience. </p>
<a>Gina Moreno</a> talks about breaking the cycle of self-neglect as a first-generation Latina on TikTok.
<a>Erika Cruz</a> talks about the dependency that immigrant parents have with their first-generation children.

<p><a>One-on-one therapy sessions</a> gave Gonzalez the space to understand herself, acknowledge her feelings, and develop healthy coping strategies. </p>
<p>For people whose struggles feel similar to Gonzalez’s, The Times asked Southern California trauma therapists and an academic about how to define first-generation trauma, what causes it and how people can heal. </p>

<p>What is therapy and what happens in a session? What kinds are available? An introduction to a critical tool for better mental health.</p>
<h2>What is first generation trauma? </h2>
<p>The conversation about first-generation trauma is emerging in the Latino community, specifically in social media spaces focused on improving mental health. It tends to be found with the hashtag #firstgen. </p>
<p>In those same spaces are the conversations on generational (or intergenerational) trauma, which differs from first-generation trauma because it is trauma passed down through generations. </p>
<p>There isn’t a definition of the term because it hasn’t been widely explored yet, Manuel Zamarripa director and co-founder of the <a>Institute of Chicana/o/x Psychology</a> said.</p>
<p>It’s more about the specific experience of the children who struggle to reconcile the culture clashes between American society and their immigrant households. </p>
<p>“Trauma is a heavy-hitting word,” Zamarripa said. </p>
<p>He added: “In our effort to educate, we don’t want to promote or perpetuate a narrative that we’re just walking around as individuals that are significantly damaged or traumatized.”</p>
<p>Zamarripa suggests using the terms first-generation trauma or first-generation stress depending on a person’s unique experiences. </p>
<p>Here are some common experiences of children of immigrants that can contribute to first-generation trauma or stress:</p>
<a>Migration Policy Institute</a> explains assimilation as the integration of people or culture into a dominant culture and society.
<i>“te calmas o te calmo”</i> which translates to “calm down or I’ll calm you down.” Or a parent might respond by telling the child
<i>“Por que lloras? No llores.” </i>— Why are you crying? Don’t cry. Instead of acknowledging their feelings, the child is unintentionally taught to push it aside.
<h2>How do these experiences impact your life?</h2>
<p>Pezo and Agueda said that people have the mindset of working hard and not being able complain because that would mean they’re <i>“malagradecido”</i> — ungrateful.</p>
<p>Gonzalez said the reason her parents made the difficult decision of leaving their lives in Guadalajara was to have better educational opportunities for their future family and eventually build generational wealth in the U.S. </p>
<p>So when Gonzalez struggled in medical school, she ultimately feared letting her parents down. </p>
<p>“Really all that fear came from the pressure that I felt to become someone — to be somebody important in this country who could give back to their parents and make their sacrifices worth it,” she said. </p>
<div><p><a>Lifestyle</a></p><p> <a>How to find a therapist who is right for you</a> </p></div>
<p>It’s been a rough year, and maybe you are considering therapy for the first, second or fifth time. It takes patience and effort to find the right therapist. Here’s a breakdown of what you need to know.</p>
<p>There is no one way, or one right way, to work through traumatic and stressful experiences, and there won’t be a set timeline. </p>
<p>Your journey, Pezo said, will be an individual one and may involve validating your experiences with a therapist or with a trusted person (family member, friend, community leader or religious leader). </p>
<p>Here’s how mental health professionals approach first generation trauma and stress with clients.</p>
<p><b>Open conversations:</b> As you start to understand your lived experiences, Agueda said, you might be interested in talking with your parents about how a certain life event made you feel. </p>
<p>“Come at that with:<i> ‘Nunca me has dicho eso,’</i>” — You’ve never told me that — “and ask them to tell you more about it,” she said. </p>
<p>But parents or guardians might not want to get specific because it’s too painful. Agueda said to approach these discussions with humility and grace. </p>
<p><b>Learning to cope with setbacks: </b>Gonzalez felt out of balance when dealing with school, societal pressures of becoming somebody, and the inadvertent pressures from her parents. </p>
<p>“I’m so glad I went to therapy, because it really helped me to be OK with the setbacks and failures. It made me realize that it’s part of life,” Gonzalez said. </p>
<p>“I just take it for what it was. It was them trying to figure out how we were going to survive and make life better for themselves and our family,” she said. </p>
<p><b>Destigmatizing mental health:</b> Zamarripa said part of this healing journey is reframing how we understand mental health struggles. </p>

<p>San Pedro Bay is looking less crowded these days. The fleet of massive container ships loitering just off the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles has thinned to 46 boats from its peak of more than 80 in late October.</p>
<p>Is that a good sign for Southern California’s congested supply chain, and the breathability of its air? That depends on whom you ask.</p>
