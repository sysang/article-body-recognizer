<p>“They have not made fixing the hard infrastructure — doing the hard work of Vision Zero — a priority," said Cohen, who co-founded Families for Safe Streets after her son was killed. </p>
<h2><b>Enforcement crackdown</b></h2>
<p>From the beginning, de Blasio indicated his Vision Zero goal would primarily focus on enforcement to curb reckless driving — ticketing drivers for failing to yield to pedestrians or speeding down streets.</p>
<p>At his 2014 press conference, de Blasio stood next to his then-police commissioner, Bill Bratton, and vowed to dedicate more police resources toward deterring dangerous driving. </p>
<u>failed to come to an agreement to continue the program</u>
<a><u>Transportation Alternatives.</u></a> The city also saw an average drop of 72 percent in speeding where cameras are located, the DOT said.
<p>Enforcement has declined during the pandemic. Data from City Hall shows Vision Zero-related summonses issued by the NYPD have hit their lowest level since 2015, from a peak of 715,637 summonses in 2018 to just over 307,000 summonses in 2021. </p>
<p>By de Blasio’s own account, much of his legacy on Vision Zero has yet to be seen. He didn’t list it among his signature achievements in a <a><u>December interview with Joseph Viteritti</u></a>, a professor of public policy at Hunter College.</p>
<p>“I won’t list Vision Zero but I’ll put in the category… [of] a lot of things I think will have a very lasting impact and I hope have had profound impact already,” de Blasio said.</p>

<div> <div> <header> <h1> Skoufis concludes study of bill to study state studies </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<p>ALBANY — A study of a bill to have the state conduct a study of bills that mandate state studies has reached a conclusion: A whole lot of these studies go nowhere. </p>
<a>a report due to be released soon</a> by the state Senate’s Committee on Investigations and Government Operations and its chair, James Skoufis (D-Orange County).
<p>That study found that even many of the studies that had been completed were doomed to anonymity. Some weren’t posted on the websites of the agencies that conducted them. </p>
<p>And others simply weren’t done at all. </p>
<p>Some entities did what they were required to do. The Seafood Marketing Task Force, for example, completed its examination of seafood marketing by the 2019 due date. </p>
<p>But the fact that so many studies are never completed or are doomed to obsolescence is concerning, the report argues. </p>
<p>The report concluded that “consequences should be considered for extreme or persistent non-compliance.” </p>
<p>“I believe those consequences could and should be legal recourse,” Skoufis said. “If an agency is consistently and flagrantly ignoring a legislative directive and, thus, breaking the law, we should sue the agency and compel action.” </p>
<div> <div> <header> <h1> Hochul looks to put her own stamp on New York governorship </h1> </header> </div> </div>
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. — She's been governor of New York for more than four momentous months. But Kathy Hochul will truly claim the title next week, when she becomes the first woman in New York history to deliver a State of the State speech.</p>
<p>But on Jan. 5, Hochul will set out her own legislative priorities, seeking to put her stamp on the office she inherited while invigorating her campaign to win a term in her own right in 2022.</p>
<p>“One, it sends a message to the Legislature that you respect their role in the process,” Bellafiore said. “And two, in her case, it says ‘I'm not Cuomo.’ Frankly, that's probably 50 percent of her message.” </p>
<p>It won't be a one-woman show, Hochul told reporters during a virtual briefing Dec. 16. Everything from the scaled-back invite list to the policy proposals she'll push are being developed in coordination with legislative staff and leaders, she said.</p>
<p>“I've heard from countless members of the Legislature who remind me that it's definitely not a State of the State — it's called a Message to the Legislature,” Hochul said. “So returning it to the home of the Legislature is the right thing to do.”</p>
<a>delivered his annual message in the form of a speech to the Legislature in 1923.</a> Governors have been doing so ever since.
<p>That penchant for brevity might be in competition with an agenda she’s already vowed will extend through all corners of state government.</p>
<a>She wants to “overhaul”</a> New York’s 64-campus public university system and turn the state’s beleaguered ethics board — the Joint Commission on Public Ethics — “
<a>upside down.”</a> In September she
<a>promised state business leaders</a> new regional economic development funds and job training programs linking workers to their industries. In November she
<a>told Manhattan business leaders</a> that her State of the State speech would include her vision for electric vehicle infrastructure and a plan to make New York “the epicenter of the offshore wind systems.”
<p>“The State of the State is a vision document; the budget is the battle plan,” Bellafiore said.</p>
<p>Every State of the State requires a bit of bluster to rally political energy, but conditions to actually achieve any goals Hochul lays out are uncharacteristically on her side this year. </p>
<p>For the first time in years, the main story line will not include the caveat that New York is short on cash, Quinn noted.</p>
<a>filled some existing holes in education and health care</a>, and in October
<a>an update to the state’s financial plan</a> said that New York will probably have $3.8 billion more coming in than officials projected earlier in the year.
<p>Hochul <a>said the state has enough money</a> to balance its budget through 2025, and to finally begin increasing reserves to a more logical holding of 15 percent of state spending in case of future crises.</p>
<a>massive infrastructure investment</a> signed by President Joe Biden last month will speed up dithering road and rail projects across the state — visible achievements that voters may attribute to elected officials on both state and federal levels.
<p>An additional big-ticket political win in the Legislature could go a long way in Hochul’s reelection campaign, but policy priorities are nothing without lawmakers’ buy-in. </p>
<p>Hochul’s success, then, may depend on her perceived competence and her collegiality in negotiating a state budget, a historically contentious process between the executive and legislative chambers that Cuomo dominated to his political benefit.</p>
<p>“Whereas, if she's a governor for eight years, seven years from now, they'll be putting down sleeping bags in the [Assembly] chamber,” he said.</p>

<b>Perhaps just for a day. </b>“They better enjoy that one-day reprieve,” Adams said after introducing his

<a>touted</a> his 47.2 percent support ("votes still being counted") on the second question compared to Arnold Schwarzenegger's 48.58 percent result. Elder also

<a>said</a> it "should be easier to get Dem party support OUTSIDE a recall election."
<p><b>2022 MATCHUPS: </b>The Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies released poll findings today showing Newsom would handily defeat any of four top Republicans in a head-to-head race next year.</p>
<p><b>The data is from the same pre-Election Day survey</b> that showed Newsom defeating the recall by nearly 22 points.</p>
<p><b>In a two-candidate matchup,</b> Newsom has a 22- to 25-point advantage over Republicans Larry Elder, Kevin Faulconer, John Cox and Kevin Kiley. Newsom's lead cuts across gender, racial and age lines.</p>
<b>Such numbers could convince Elder to find other pursuits.</b> He
<p><b>"So it's hard for me to see, were I to have a rematch</b>, that the outcome would be a whole lot different. But I may change my mind over the next coming days."</p>
<b>But the recall also reinforced how geographically divided</b> California’s political landscape remains. In inland California,
<a>according to exit polls</a>, the pro-recall campaign won with 52 percent of the vote, while getting trounced everywhere else. With ballots still being counted, the
<a>recall was running ahead</a> in vast swaths of the state’s Central Valley, foothill regions and in the far northeastern reaches of the state.
<b>There were potential flickers of improvement for Newsom in inland California</b>. In Southern California, Newsom
<a>narrowly lost</a> Riverside County when he was elected in 2018. With ballots still being counted, he was
<a>narrowly defeating</a> the recall there.
<p><b>JOBS REPORT:</b> California has been adding new jobs faster than any other state in the country this year. A whopping 44 percent of all new positions added nationwide last month were in the Golden State, a figure Newsom was quick to tout today.</p>
<b>No industry was hit harder by the pandemic — or has since added more jobs</b> — than leisure and hospitality. State data show the sector has lost more than 400,000 workers during the pandemic, but has regained 360,200 since August 2020.

<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday pledged to keep California schools open in a statement he issued with the state's influential teachers unions the day after President Joe Biden said K-12 classrooms must not close.</p>
<p>Some schools across the country have already gone virtual or decided to break early for winter recess due to the latest Omicron-driven surge. Infected school workers, panicked parents and supply problems could prompt more closures.</p>
<p>Still, CTA's support for keeping California schools open sends a strong signal about where the political winds are blowing in the state. </p>
<p>Newsom on Wednesday also said the state will provide at least one rapid test for every K-12 public school student as children return to school after winter break. </p>
<p>The governor touted the state's public safety protocols for schools, including indoor masking, noting in a statement that California accounted for just 0.3 percent of all school closures in the U.S. this academic year. </p>
<a>A state judge this week struck down the San Diego Unified School District's mandate</a>, which has also been appealed to the Supreme Court in a separate federal lawsuit.
<p>Meanwhile, <a>the Los Angeles school district has postponed its sweeping requirement</a> amid concern that it would lock 30,000 students out of in-person learning.</p>

<h2>Cruz secures vote on Russian pipeline sanctions in deal with Schumer</h2>
<p>Cruz agreed to lift his holds on 32 nominees in exchange for the Senate voting in early January on his legislation to sanction the pipeline.</p>

<p>The Senate clinched an agreement early Saturday morning to confirm around three dozen nominees for ambassadorships and senior State Department positions, ending a stalemate between Sen. Ted Cruz and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer.</p>
<p>Cruz’s blockade, which began shortly after Biden took office, has stymied the Senate’s work on foreign policy nominations, drawing rebukes from Democrats who contend that Cruz was putting U.S. national security at risk.</p>
<p>The previous German government was in favor of the pipeline, and the State Department decided against imposing mandatory sanctions earlier this year so as to not damage the U.S.-Germany relationship while the pipeline was nearly complete.</p>
<p>In a marathon session Friday into Saturday, the Senate also voted to confirm former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel as U.S. ambassador to Japan.</p>

<p>Former President Donald Trump criticized Chinese President Xi Jinping while also rejecting the idea that the United States should boycott the upcoming Olympics in Beijing.</p>
<p>The U.S.-led boycott in 1980 was in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In retaliation, the Soviet Union and its closest allies boycotted the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In regards to Xi, Trump said in the interview that he had a great relationship with the Chinese president while in office.</p>
<p>“I really believe he liked me, I like him,” said Trump. “He is a killer but I had a great relationship with him.”</p>
<a>January 2020</a>, he celebrated a recent trade deal with China that “will bring both the USA China closer together in so many other ways.” His tweet continued: “Terrific working with President Xi, a man who truly loves his country. Much more to come!”
<p>In his far-flung interview with Bartiromo, Trump also claimed that China has “economically been ripping us off for many years” and criticized Xi for his handling of the pandemic. </p>

<h2>Thousands of Afghans stuck at U.S. military bases face long road to resettlement</h2>
<p>More than 29,000 Afghans remain on U.S. military bases thanks, in part, to a shortage of affordable housing and the pandemic. </p>

<p>For nearly four months, Siddiq, his wife and baby boy have been living on a military base in the United States, like tens of thousands of other people evacuated from Afghanistan last summer. </p>
<p>It doesn’t help that they’re at <a>Fort McCoy in Wisconsin</a>, where the weather is less than ideal this time of year. </p>
<a>a measles outbreak</a> among evacuees to
<a>Afghans fell to their deaths</a> from planes leaving Kabul and numerous potential evacuees were left behind — U.S. officials and refugee advocates are praising the resettlement effort so far.
<a>Refugee Council USA,</a> an organization assisting in the resettlement effort. “We’ve been basically building a giant plane as we fly it.”
<p>In the grander scheme, however, the job of helping vulnerable Afghans is far from over. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, “it is not easy, and there are challenges with each step and flight,” said a U.S. official familiar with the ongoing evacuation effort. “The number of people applying for the different immigrant categories grows each day.” </p>
<p>Some estimates for the number of Afghans potentially eligible for relocation to the United States run into the hundreds of thousands. </p>
<p>The tens of thousands of Afghans who have reached the United States did so following four years in which the Trump administration tried to essentially end the U.S. refugee resettlement program. </p>
<a>organizations had begun to slowly rebuild</a>. But the unexpected, massive Afghan evacuation in August turbo-charged that reconstruction effort, even as it initially taxed existing staffers and resources.
<p>On Thursday, the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service — one of the resettlement organizations that works with the federal government — launched a new office at Peace Lutheran Church in Alexandria, Virginia. </p>
<p>Dozens of people celebrated the opening of the office, which will aid newcomers in dealing with everything from finding jobs to enrolling in school. LIRS has hired some of the recent Afghan arrivals to help manage cases. </p>
<p>The Alexandria office is one of 13 new sites LIRS has launched after having to shut down 17 due to the Trump years, said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and chief executive of LIRS. </p>
<p>“America is a big country!” he points out in disbelief. </p>
<p>There’s also lingering uncertainty about how long many of the evacuees will be able to stay in the United States. Many have been permitted on U.S. soil under what’s known as the humanitarian parole program. </p>
<p><a>Congress has approved legislation</a> that would make the parolees eligible for benefits similar to those given to refugees, whose arrival in America usually comes after many months or years of security and other vetting. </p>
<p>Refugee advocates are urging U.S. lawmakers to grant a more permanent status to Afghan parolees. The Biden <a>administration has expressed support for </a>legislation that leads to that. </p>
<p>“We will continue to welcome additional qualifying Afghans over the coming weeks, months, and years to support those who stood with us over our two decades in Afghanistan,” a senior Biden administration official said in a statement. </p>
<p>The refugee advocates are especially uneasy about shifting Afghans to the U.S. asylum system. The bar for evidence and admission to that program is often so high that many people who are genuinely in danger cannot meet it. </p>
<p>It may be impossible, for example, for Afghans to provide documents demanded by asylum judges if those materials are back in Afghanistan and under the control of the Taliban government. </p>
<p>Ali, an Afghan who managed to get out of the country in August and is now living in Virginia on parole status, is among those likely to apply for asylum if no other route opens up. </p>
<p>Ali, who asked that his real name not be used to protect relatives still in Afghanistan, said he isn’t sure what his future holds, but he wants for it to be in America. </p>
<p>He may try seeking work as an educator. </p>
<p>“I felt like I’m secure now, I’m in a peaceful place,” he said. “There’s no fear of kidnapping, assassination.”</p>

<h2>Biden’s rural investments run up against the culture wars in Wisconsin</h2>
<p>Even as President Joe Biden’s agenda has promised billions to rural communities this year, Democrats are in danger of losing their last foothold in rural Wisconsin.</p>
<p> Democrats are trying to keep control of Wisconsin's 3rd Congressional District, one of their remaining footholds in rural America. | Kris Litscher Lee</p>

<p>“He’s got a big job on his hands because people hate him for no reason,” Weber said of Biden.</p>
<p>And families with two children under the age of 17, for instance, have likely received federal stimulus checks and monthly child tax credit payments this year totaling around $12,000.</p>
<p>The White House criticized efforts to detract from those gains.</p>
<p>Democrats in Congress, who fought for the funding and argue it’s helping families address rising costs, acknowledge that many people don’t know it’s something Democrats championed.</p>
<p>“No one really connects it, even though they're getting the checks,” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said in an interview. As in Wisconsin, Brown’s state has pockets of small communities that once voted Democratic but have since turned deep red.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump’s lingering influence is hard to miss across this county of rolling farmland and small villages in southwest Wisconsin. “Trump won” flags are still everywhere.</p>
<p>The district’s longtime Rep. Ron Kind, one of the remaining farm-district centrist Democrats in Congress, <a>barely survived</a> reelection last year. <a>Kind has since announced</a> he’s not seeking another term.</p>
<p>Republican leaders in the area are railing against Biden’s Covid-19 public health mandates while embracing ongoing investigations into false election fraud claims in the 2020 election.</p>
<p>Local Democratic organizers are not convinced that the investments, while historic, will be able to slow the shifting electorate.</p>
<p>Millions more are on the way from the infrastructure law to maintain roads, replace lead pipes and provide high-speed, rural broadband internet, all of which Biden and Democrats have touted as game changers for rural communities.</p>
<p>“We don't need to print any more money,” Stroh said. “Obama talked about being shovel ready and all that. That was a bunch of crap.”</p>
<p>Democrats have called for Van Orden’s disqualification <a>following reports</a> that he entered Capitol grounds during the riot. Van Orden denies that. But some voters, like Stroh, say they would support him either way.</p>
<p>As local Democrats try to push back, they’re simply overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Democrats' last hope for holding the district and their remaining footholds in rural America is a small sliver of rural voters whom they still might be able to persuade.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Washington, Democratic lawmakers are anxious to pass their social spending and climate bill as quickly as possible so they can hit the road themselves to explain the plans and push back on the GOP ahead of next year’s midterms.</p>
<p>“Republicans face a real challenge in rural Wisconsin explaining to people why they oppose delivering results that make a real difference in people’s lives,” said Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin’s Democratic senator.</p>
<p>At the very least, Bustos said, “I hope this will help regain some trust.”</p>

<h2>Renters strike back as cities cap price hikes by landlords </h2>
<p>The revival of rent control policies long derided by economists, including one of President Joe Biden’s top advisers, comes as officials scramble to contain rising prices across a range of goods and services.</p>

<p>As the cost of housing soars, one old idea is starting to get traction with voters: rent control.</p>
<p>Amid surging inflation in the 1970s, a more nuanced version of rent control took off in coastal cities where the housing stock was limited and prices were high — mostly in the Northeast and California.</p>
<p>Affordable housing advocates say they’ve also been emboldened by the success of the nationwide eviction bans imposed by the Trump and Biden administrations during the pandemic, before the Supreme Court blocked the policy in August.</p>
<a>Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) and executive director of the progressive Groundwork Collaborative. “Many things don’t feel feasible until they are, and rent controls feel feasible now.”
<p>Opponents say rent control discourages development and induces<b> </b>landlords to sell to owner-occupants as a way<b> </b>to earn the market price for their real estate.</p>
<p>Gyourko, who specializes in housing markets and real estate finance at the Wharton business school, said a better way to help struggling tenants make ends meet “is just to give them money."</p>
<p>"Don’t distort the housing market," he said. "Don’t screw up supply and make it more unaffordable in the long run.”</p>
<b> </b>what could shape up to be the nation’s most stringent rent-control policy, which city
<p>“We wanted to make sure that coverage was universal, whether you live in a home that was built a year ago or 20 years ago,” said Tram Hoang, the campaign manager for Keep St. Paul Home, which pushed for the ballot measure.</p>
<a>a financial disclosure</a>. Keep St. Paul Home
<a>spent a little under $200,000</a> through Oct. 14.
<p>“What our campaign showed is grassroots organizing can beat moneyed opposition,” Hoang said.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Multi Housing Association declined to comment.</p>
<p>The National Apartment Association, which represents landlords, is mobilizing to fight similar ballot measures next year, said Greg Brown, the group’s head of government affairs.</p>
<p>“Because of the supply issue, there’s upward pressure on rents,” he said. “These types of policies, which appear on their face to be a quick and easy solution, are getting more popular.”</p>
<p>Wu has public support for imposing rent restrictions in Boston — 59 percent of respondents in <a>a poll of voters in October</a> said they would support rent control.</p>
<p>But Wu faces an uphill battle because Massachusetts voters banned rent control in 1994. Reversing the ban would require buy-in from the state Legislature, where there doesn't seem to be much appetite, as well as from Republican Gov. Charlie Baker.</p>
<a>in a recent interview</a> that he'd “leave the door open a little bit” to the idea to help deal with skyrocketing housing costs, which he called “probably the single biggest cost-of-living problem we have in Massachusetts.”
<p>The Biden administration has stayed mum, even as it has<b> </b>encouraged states and cities to enact eviction bans during the pandemic and to ease restrictive zoning rules to make room for more affordable housing.</p>
<a>surveyed by the<b> </b>Chicago Booth Initiative on Global Markets in 2012</a> who disagreed that rent control ordinances have had a positive impact on affordable housing in the cities that have enacted them.
<p>“While well intended, theoretically they also likely limit expansions in supply and improvements in quality,” Rouse said at the time.</p>
<p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Rouse’s position and whether it has changed.</p>
<p>Rent control advocates dismiss many of the critiques as fear-mongering by industry lobbyists.</p>
<p>“This is fundamentally about housing being a human right and a necessity over a commodity that should be profited off of,” Torrejón Chu said. “We see rent control as a solution that allows for a reasonable regulation of the market.”</p>

<p>The Good Health Pharmacy in north London is one of dozens of vaccination sites that kept their doors open Saturday to administer “jingle jabs” amid a government push to offer booster shots to all adults by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Pharmacist Fenil Lalji said the shop’s owners decided to stay open because they lost a family member to the <a>pandemic</a> and wanted to do what they could to help others stay safe.</p>
<p> Health Secretary Sajid Javid on Friday urged people to “make the booster a part of your Christmas this year,” praised those who are working through the festive period to deliver the shots.</p>
<p>While infection rates are rising, public health officials hope that widespread vaccination will limit the number of people who are hospitalized or ultimately die from Covid-19.</p>

<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Airlines <a>continued to cancel </a>hundreds of flights Saturday as staffing issues tied to Covid-19 <a>disrupted holiday celebrations</a> during one of the busiest travel times of the year.</p>
<p>FlightAware, a flight-tracking website, noted 941 flights entering, leaving or inside the U.S. canceled Saturday, up from 690 <a>Friday</a>. Over 200 more flights were already canceled for Sunday. FlightAware does not say why flights are canceled.</p>
<p>“Nobody was organizing, trying to sort things out,” he said, faulting Delta for a lack of customer service. “Nobody explained anything. Not even, ‘Oh we’re so sorry, this is what we can do to help you.’”</p>
<p>Their new flight, for Monday evening, has a layover in Paris, and they are worried there will be issues with that one as well. And they have already missed a big family get-together that was scheduled for Saturday.</p>
<p>Air China, China Eastern and Lion Air, an Indonesian airline with many canceled flights, did not respond to emails Saturday.</p>
<p>To ease staffing shortages, countries including Spain and the U.K. have reduced the length of COVID-19 quarantines by letting people return to work sooner after testing positive or being exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>Delta CEO Ed Bastian was among those who have called on the Biden administration to take similar steps or risk further disruptions in air travel. On Thursday, the U.S. <a>shortened isolation rules </a>for health care workers only.</p>

<p>Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said Sunday that he understood why Americans were pessimistic and frustrated at this point in the coronavirus pandemic, but said “tremendous progress” has been made over the past two years.</p>
<p>Amid the surging wave of cases attributed to the Omicron variant, Murthy said the country has learned how to confront the pandemic.</p>
<p>Murthy added: “We will get to the end of this pandemic. It’s gone through twists and turns. But we will get there and we will get there together.“</p>
<p>“Starting that conversation is important so kids know that it’s OK for them to come to you for help. It’s also important for parents to encourage kids to seek out help, even if it’s not from them,” he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Murthy <a>issued an advisory</a> on the mental health of the nation‘s children.</p>

<p>Holiday sales rose at the fastest pace in 17 years, even as shoppers grappled with higher prices, product shortages and a raging new Covid-19 variant in the last few weeks of the season, according to one spending measure.</p>
<p>Mastercard Spending Pulse, which tracks all kinds of payments including cash and debit cards, reported Sunday that holiday sales had risen 8.5% from a year earlier. Mastercard SpendingPulse had expected a 7.4% increase.</p>
<p>The results, which covered Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, were fueled by purchases of clothing and jewelry.</p>
<p>Holiday sales were up 10.7% compared with the pre-pandemic 2019 holiday period.</p>
<p>By category, clothing rose 47%, jewelry 32%, electronics 16%. Online sales were up 11% from a year ago and 61% from 2019. Department stores registered a 21% increase over 2020.</p>
<p>After omicron hit, some consumers stayed home and shifted their spending to e-commerce — but sales stayed strong.</p>
<p>Americans also learned to adjust to product shortages, turning to alternatives if their top choices were not available, or looking at other venues like eBay to find their top brands.</p>

<h2>Fauci: ‘I don’t think people should expect’ a domestic flight vaccine mandate</h2>
<p>“It’s on the table,” he added. “But that doesn’t mean it’s going to happen. I doubt if we’re going to see something like that in the reasonably foreseeable future.”</p>

<p>Anthony Fauci on Monday said Americans shouldn’t expect a Covid vaccination requirement for domestic air travel in the near future unless “things change dramatically.” </p>
<p>“I don’t see this being announced or happening in the reasonable future unless things change dramatically,” Fauci reiterated in Monday’s interview with CNN’s Jim Acosta. </p>
<a>White House press briefing</a> earlier this month.
<p>When pressed on if his position is indicative of a divide among administration officials, Fauci disagreed. </p>
<p>Fauci’s Monday morning interview drew headlines similar to those in September, when news outlets reported his comments on domestic flight mandates in an interview with theSkimm.</p>
<p>“It’s on the table; we haven’t decided yet,” <a>he said in an interview this fall.</a> “But if the president said, ‘You know, let’s go ahead and do it,’ I would be supportive of it.”</p>

<p>Flynn ultimately informed the committee on Monday that he would sue in order to prevent the panel from enforcing its subpoena and holding him in criminal contempt.</p>
<p>Sarelson also indicated that Flynn believes the committee is preparing to subpoena phone records “pertaining to General Flynn and his family.” </p>
<p>Trump ultimately opted against taking that step, but many of those who violently attacked the Capitol anticipated he would, and cited this possibility as part of their calculus in participating in the riot.</p>
<p>“[T]he Select Committee as it currently stands—and stood at the time it issued the subpoenas in question—has no authority to conduct business because it is not a duly constituted Select Committee,” Flynn’s attorneys wrote.</p>

<h2>Kim Potter guilty of manslaughter in Daunte Wright death</h2>
<p>The mostly white jury deliberated for about four days before finding former Brooklyn Center officer Kim Potter guilty of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter.</p>

<div> <div> <p> By ASSOCIATED PRESS</p> <p><time>12/22/2021 12:45 PM EST</time></p> <p>Updated: <time>12/23/2021 01:30 PM EST</time></p> </div> </div>
<p>As she was led away in handcuffs, a Potter family member in the courtroom shouted “Love you, Kim!” Potter’s attorneys left the courthouse without commenting and didn’t immediately respond to phone messages or emails.</p>
<p>They chanted “Say his name! Daunte Wright!” Some held yellow signs that said “guilty” in large block letters.</p>
<p>Potter, who testified that she “didn’t want to hurt anybody,” looked down without any visible reaction when the verdicts were read. As Chu thanked the jury, Potter made the sign of the cross.</p>
<p>Potter’s attorneys argued that she should be allowed to remain free until she's sentenced, saying she wasn’t going to commit another crime or go anywhere.</p>
<p>“It is the Christmas holiday season,” Potter attorney Paul Engh argued. "She’s a devoted Catholic, no less, and there is no point to incarcerate her at this point in time.”</p>
<p>Chu rejected their arguments, though, saying she “cannot treat this case any differently than any other case.”</p>
<p>Outside the courthouse afterward, Ellison said the verdict brought a measure of accountability for Potter but fell short of justice.</p>
<p>Ellison said he felt sympathy for Potter, who has gone from being an “esteemed member to the community” to being convicted of a serious crime.</p>
<p>Wright’s mother hugged Ellison and said the verdicts triggered “every single emotion that you could imagine.”</p>
<p>“Today we have gotten accountability and that’s what we’ve been asking for from the beginning,” Katie Bryant said, crediting supporters for keeping up pressure.</p>
<p>“We love you, we appreciate you, and honestly, we could not have done it without you,” she said.</p>
<p>Jurors saw video of the shooting from police body cameras and dashcams. As Wright pulled away while another officer attempted to handcuff him, Potter repeatedly said she would tase him before she drew her handgun and shot him once in his chest.</p>
