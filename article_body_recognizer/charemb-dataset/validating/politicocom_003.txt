<p><b>How much of a shock to New York’s political system</b> was India Walton’s defeat of Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown in Tuesday’s Democratic primary? </p>
<p><b>Consider that Gov. Andrew Cuomo </b>and his 2010 Republican opponent, Carl Paladino,<b> </b>are offering a very similar theory on the race that dismisses Walton’s appeal to voters.</p>
<b>“You’re going to have anomalies,” </b>Cuomo
<a><u>said on Wednesday</u></a>. “I have nothing but good things to say about Mayor Brown, but he decided basically his campaign strategy, as I understand it, was basically to avoid engaging in a campaign. And then you had a very low turnout.”
<p><b>The often-inflammatory Paladino offered a very similar interpretation</b> in an interview today.</p>
<p><b>“Only 15 percent of [all registered voters] voted, </b>and the chief reason for that was that everybody just thought that Byron was going to be a shoo-in,” he said. “They’re perfectly happy with Byron Brown, who’s been a good mayor.”</p>
<b>“Byron will run a write-in campaign highly supported by everybody</b> in the city of Buffalo, and he’ll win and he’ll destroy her. She’s a communist,” said Paladino, who has been
<a><u>ginning up support for the idea</u></a>. “We’ll have people coming out of the forest to vote to make sure that she doesn’t get elected. There’s no way that woman will be the next mayor of Buffalo.”
<p><b>Brown might be able to find support in November</b> among his loyalists, the business community, Republicans, and <a><u>the local PBA</u></a>. But it’s increasingly clear he’ll have minimal Democratic establishment backing. </p>
<b>“Game over. Move on,”</b> state Sen. Sean Ryan
<a><u>told reporters</u></a> in Western New York today. “Just because you were mayor four times doesn’t mean you get to be mayor a fifth. Stop listening to Carl Paladino. ... You were sleeping and you lost.”

<a><u>announcement this week</u></a> that federal stimulus funds would be made available to increase policing, and said he hoped the city would crack down on gang and gun violence in particular by adopting a JTTF-like approach.
<p>“We need to do it with handguns and do it with the violence we're seeing in our inner city," he said. "We have not done that. That has been a real failure, and we've turned our backs on Black and brown people in this city and in this country.”</p>

<p>“Unquestionably, something is working. … So far, I think it has really led to a very representative outcome, and that’s exciting for the future of the city,” de Blasio said on "The Brian Lehrer Show."</p>
<p><b>Polls have shown Maya Wiley, who is in second place, having more success with younger voters </b>(and she appears to have gotten the vote of de Blasio’s son, Dante, which Lehrer referenced.) </p>
