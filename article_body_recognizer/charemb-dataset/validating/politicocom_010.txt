<div><div><h1>Covid’s deadly trade-offs, by the numbers: How each state has fared in the pandemic</h1></div></div>
<div>POLITICO’s State Pandemic Scorecard shows how state decisions impacted lives, jobs, education and social well-being.</div>
<div><p>By Sean McMinn and Liz Crampton<span> | <time>12/15/2021 5 AM EST</time></span></p></div>

<p>Here are some core takeaways: </p>
<li>States that imposed more restrictions such as stay-at-home orders and mask requirements did experience lower rates of death and hospitalizations. But they also tended to have worse economic and educational outcomes. </li>
<li>States whose economies are heavily dependent on tourism suffered the most economically, with Hawaii and Nevada hit hardest.</li>
<li>No state did well in every policy area. </li>
<li>Overall, rural states tended to fare better than more urbanized states on economic and educational outcomes. Many rural states, despite being less densely populated, ranked poorly in health outcomes, however. </li>
<p>“I got to the point where I was saying ‘Please, just wear the mask so you live long enough to vote against me,’” Walz said.</p>
<p>The scorecard illustrates the sobering reality of those trade-offs, based on the data currently available. </p>
<p>David Rubin, a pediatrician and director of the PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, compared making policy during a pandemic to walking a tightrope. </p>
<p>“There’s a trade-off between the degree of pandemic response and economic activity,” Rubin said. “The best performers are people who are constantly weighing those two together to maximize safety but try to minimize the impact on our lives.”</p>
<p>Here’s what the scorecard reveals in the four different policy areas. For more information on why and how we calculated these scores, please read our Editor’s Note.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, Republican-led states tended to be more resistant to mask mandates and stay-at-home edicts while Democratic governors, by and large, embraced those public health precautions, even at the expense of the local economy. </p>
<p>Large southern states with Republican governors, however, experienced worse health outcomes. Almost all of the states ranked at the bottom for health voted for former President Donald Trump in the 2020 election. </p>
<p>Vermont, a blue state run by a Republican governor, earned a nearly perfect score in the health category. Health officials there credit the state’s decision to lift lockdown restrictions in phases.</p>
<p>The scorecard suggests states that had fewer shutdowns and more rural geography tended to fare better economically than more urban states that imposed more public health restrictions. </p>
<p>“You basically had winners and losers chosen early in the pandemic,” said Jason Straczewski, vice president of government relations and political affairs for the National Retail Federation.</p>
<p>“We initially knew we were going to be in for a hurting and said ‘We’ve gotta throw everything we can at this’,” Rodriguez said.</p>
<p>The stakes are high; researchers warn that learning lost during the pandemic could set back a generation.</p>

<div><h1>We rated every race in play in 2020. This is who we think will win.</h1></div>
<div><p>Published 11/19/2019 5:00 PM ESTUpdated 11/2/2020 4:30 AM EDT</p></div>
<p>What American politics will look like after 2020 is anyone’s guess. But we’re taking our best shot.</p>
<p>The latest from POLITICO’s 2020 Election Forecast: Ratings from Senior Elections Editor Steve Shepard for every national contest, from the 538 Electoral College votes to the 435 House districts — and everything in between. </p>
<p>We’ve been updating our ratings all the way through Election Day. Some key points from our final predictions:</p>
<li><p>In the race for the White House, Democrat Joe Biden is the favorite entering Election Day. There is still a plausible path for President Donald Trump to win an Electoral College majority — but it is narrow.</p></li>
<li><p>The race for Senate control is close to a coin flip. Democrats are slight favorites, but the GOP could still hold on.</p></li>
<li><p>In the House, Democrats have strengthened their grip as the national environment has swung toward them, and the party is likely to gain seats in the election and enter 2021 with a larger majority than in the previous Congress.</p></li>

<p>Trump became the first Republican to win Wisconsin since 1984, and all indications point to another close race in 2020.</p>

<p>As Joe Biden has surged to a national lead, most high-quality polls show him with a significant lead in Michigan.</p>

<p>Democrats called the 2nd District “Obamaha,” after the Illinoisan swiped an electoral vote there in 2008. Mitt Romney took it back by a 7-point margin in 2012, but it was again close in 2016. Trump won it by only a little more than 2 points.</p>
<h3>Pennsylvania’s presidential vote</h3>

<p>Democrat Jon Ossoff is running close with GOP Sen. David Perdue in the polls — but if neither candidate earns a majority in November, the two will advance to a January 2021 runoff.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator, Colorado </h3>
<p>Cory Gardner* (R) vs. John Hickenlooper (D)</p>
<div><h6>For this seat</h6><ol><li><div>R+5</div><div>2002</div></li><li><div>D+10</div><div>2008</div></li><li><div>R+2</div><div>2014</div></li></ol></div>

<p>GOP Sen. Cory Gardner's reelection campaign has always been perilous in a state trending toward Democrats. Former Gov. John Hickenlooper has the lead.</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator, North Carolina </h3>

<p>Maine is home to the most hotly contested Senate race in the country. Democrats think they have GOP Sen. Susan Collins on the ropes, while Republicans are convinced Collins' independent streak will survive the Trump era.</p>

<h2>How Democrats are ‘unilaterally disarming’ in the redistricting wars</h2>
<p>Democrats have greater control of state legislatures than in the last round of redistricting but have turned over map-making powers in some states to independent commissions.</p>

<p>Oregon Democrats had finally secured total control of redistricting for the first time in decades.</p>
<p>Then, just months before they were set to draw new maps, they gave it away.</p>
<p>“We Democrats are cursed with this blindness about good government,” said Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, a Democratic state that will nonetheless see its congressional map drawn by a newly created independent commission.</p>
<b> </b>“But having said that, I still come down on the side of reforming this process because it's got to start somewhere.”
<p>The saga of Virginia's redistricting commission, however, has proved to be the most controversial.</p>
<a>painted the capture of the state legislature</a> as crucial to the party's redistricting fate. They took both chambers, securing total control in Richmond under Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam.
<p>Democratic legislative candidates campaigned on a pledge to back an existing amendment that would create a redistricting commission. But when it came time to vote on it, they balked.</p>
<b> </b>must approve a map — giving the GOP de facto veto power — and if the commission deadlocks, the Republican-leaning state
<p>Most Democrats in the House of Delegates voted against placing the amendment on the ballot. But nine defected and voted with Republicans to pass it, and voters overwhelmingly approved it in November.</p>
<p>"We just don't seem to have the guts to just go out and go play politics the way Republicans do," said Ben Tribbett, a Virginia-based Democratic operative.</p>
<p>That's what House Democrats proposed in their election reform bill, H.R. 1 (117). Yet that legislation, which would mandate independent redistricting commissions, is unlikely to<b> </b>make it through the Senate.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, few Democrats dispute that they have been much quicker to move toward commissions or power-sharing agreements in states where they have trifecta control over redistricting.</p>
<p>“We want fairness, and we put our money where our mouth is,” said Kelly Ward Burton, the group’s president. “We have pushed for fairness in the states where we have control or influence. We're even doing it at the national level."</p>
<p>“The Republicans are not," she added, "because they intend to manipulate the maps to hold on to power.”</p>
<p>They vowed to secure more control before the 2020 redistricting — and have. But that has made recent developments all the more frustrating.</p>
<p>"She is totally Portland-centric, and nothing outside of Multnomah County exists so far as she's concerned," DeFazio said, adding: "It's just inexplicable and arrogant."</p>
<p>In Colorado, a Democratic-led state House joined with a Republican-led state Senate in 2018 to place a redistricting<b> </b>commission proposal on the ballot.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the amendment passed with few detractors — the legislature voted to place it on the ballot, and the voters also gave it a stamp of approval. Now Colorado's eight districts will be drawn by a commission.</p>
<p>"I don't see it that way," said Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.) when asked if it was a missed opportunity for the party. "It's good government, and I think that at the end of the day that's what nonpartisan redistricting is all about."</p>
<p>Still, Republicans have control in places like Texas, Georgia, Florida and North Carolina. And they need only five seats to recapture the House, something they could possibly attain through favorable maps in those states alone.</p>
<p>The NDRC, which will serve as the party's redistricting legal clearinghouse, said Democrats remain clear-eyed about the challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<b> </b>of their plans if H.R.1 doesn't pass. "We will sue them. We fully anticipate being in court. And that will be the battlefront on which we fight for fair maps. We're ready for that."

<h2>Gridlock and dysfunction — and a few tears — hit redistricting</h2>
<p>Bipartisan commissions designed to make the two parties work together on redistricting have devolved into messes in several states.</p>

<p>Virginia voters tried to take partisan gerrymandering out of redistricting by giving map-drawing power to a bipartisan commission.</p>
<p>Instead, party politics imploded the process.</p>
<a>as a Republican co-chair bemoaned</a> “a fundamental lack of trust” poisoning the process.
<p>“Just a different path to the same place,” said Virginia state Del. Marcus Simon, a Democrat serving on his state’s commission.</p>
<p>“Maybe something like this could’ve worked 20 or 30 years ago, when we weren’t in such a polarized climate," Simon added, "where making nice with the other side wasn’t a betrayal of your whole tribe."</p>
<p>But “the problem has been in the execution,” said Josh Cohen, a Democratic consultant working with redistricting advocates in Virginia, Michigan and other states.</p>
<p>“Independent and bipartisan commissions were generally conceived with good intentions,” Cohen continued, but “in a lot of ways, they haven’t fulfilled their promise in terms of independence, representation or accessibility.”</p>
<a>watered down</a> a ballot measure that created a redistricting commission, relegating it to an advisory role.
<p>Monday’s meeting in Virginia offered an extreme example of the dysfunction. Commissioners squabbled over whether one of the Democratic co-chairs formally resigned — she said she didn’t — and whether she could reinstate herself.</p>
<p>But some Democrats still defend any effort to drag the process into the open.</p>
<p>On the GOP side, many still maintain that giving redistricting power to commissions instead of legislatures is unconstitutional, though the Supreme Court rejected that argument in a 2015 case out of Arizona.</p>
<p>And Republicans in Colorado, who otherwise would be shut out of the redistricting process entirely, count themselves fortunate.</p>
<p>That feeling is shared by Michigan Democrats, who were shut out of redistricting a decade ago and saw Republicans draw some of the most gerrymandered districts in the country.</p>
<b> </b>has struggled to meet deadlines, eliminating several public hearings last month in order to devote more time to map-drawing. It's spent hours publicly debating how and where to draw lines, producing dozens of potential drafts. It's also
<a>struggled to keep up</a> attendance among its 13 members.
<p>“These are people that by definition have never been involved in the process,” he added, “so I give them a wide berth, they're gonna make some mistakes along the way.”</p>
<p>And Michigan party operatives still expect the maps to end up mired in lawsuits. “I don’t think there’s any way, shape or form this process gets done without endless litigation,” said Jamie Roe, a Republican consultant based in Michigan.</p>
<p><b>“</b>We've got a commission that is as dysfunctional, apparently, as we feared it would be,” said Rep. <a>Gerry Connolly</a> (D-Va.) “And it's unclear whether they're going to have any work product at all.”</p>

<p>In Texas, for example, the GOP delegation presented to the state Legislature a proposal that would give Republicans at least 25 of the state’s 38 districts.</p>
<p>“We were able to get all the members together around a unified map and then submit it to the state Legislature,” said GOP Rep. Michael McCaul. “And they were pleased to have our input.”</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court’s 2018 map helped usher in four new Democratic members — all women from the greater Philadelphia area. Under the old map, Republicans controlled 13 of the 18 districts for three election cycles.</p>
<p>States like those could be the sites of future battles for control of the House over the next decade. In many of the others, redistricting will ensure that little changes from election to election.</p>

<h2>Who’s winning congressional redistricting: How we calculated our figures</h2>
<p>Projecting the partisan lean of 2022’s new congressional districts takes a bit of history and a lot of math.</p>

<p>Every 10 years, states tear up their maps for the U.S. House of Representatives and draw them from scratch, rewriting the political geography for the next decade.</p>
<p>This redistricting process is done differently in every state. Newly-drawn lines can cement a party’s hold on a state’s congressional delegation — or open up new opportunities for competition.</p>
<a>our newly-released redistricting tracker</a>.
<a>precinct-level data</a> comes from a group of researchers known as the
<a>Voting and Election Science Team</a>. For a half-dozen states, we used
<a>other precinct data </a>as compiled by The Upshot at The New York Times.)
<p>But political leanings don't tell the whole story. So POLITICO also analyzes each district's demographic profile, based on two key metrics we’ve identified as key fault lines in the next generation of American politics.</p>
<a>Hispanic or Latino origin</a>.
<p>Amid that backdrop, POLITICO's redistricting tracker aims to use a data-driven approach to highlight who stands to gain from the current round of redistricting — and what that could mean for American politics into the future.</p>

<p>House Democrats’ campaign arm is moving to boost diversity among its membership’s senior campaign staff, teaming up with a training program to place staffers at top posts on campaigns.</p>
<p>Justin Myers, the executive director of Blue Leadership Collaborative, said that the program would help ensure “cultural competency” among campaign managers, and build a pipeline to a more diverse set of party committee leaders down the road.</p>
<p>Myers said the class of managers being hired at congressional campaigns were all part of a cohort that managed Virginia state legislative races earlier this year. A dozen members of that class will manage congressional campaigns, Myers said.</p>
<p>Details of the partnership were shared first with POLITICO.</p>
<p>“These folks are going to be the next [executive directors] of the DCCC, maybe the DNC,” he said. “They're going to run big Senate campaigns. I guarantee you, one amongst this group will run a presidential [campaign] one day.”</p>

<p>Michigan Reps. Fred Upton and Debbie Dingell on Sunday said they both still have hope for cooperation in Congress despite a “pretty toxic” political culture.</p>
<p>“I mean, if we don't work together, we're not going to get this thing solved,” said Upton, a Republican, discussing the need for cooperation in confronting the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But both lawmakers, who are close friends, noted that the current situation, in and out of Washington, is quite ugly.</p>
<p>Dingell came to Congress in 2015, following in the footsteps of her husband and his father. She found herself as the target of former President Donald Trump’s ire, leading to vicious messages from his supporters. </p>

<a>died earlier in December</a> at the age of 98. Upton said he had worked in Dole’s office, and Dingell noted that Dole and her late husband, John Dingell, were World War II veterans who cooperated on various issues during their long years in Congress.
<p>“He had wonderful relationships with either Republicans or Democrats sitting down at the White House, or certainly with his colleagues in both the House and the Senate,” Upton said of Dole.</p>

<p>Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a direct and dogged figure who converted the lessons of a hardscrabble childhood into a leadership role in national Democratic politics, died Tuesday. He was 82.</p>
<a>told POLITICO</a> in December 2016, weeks before retiring from the Senate.
<p>"He's got that curmudgeonly charm that is hard to replace," said Obama in March 2015.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden on Tuesday paid tribute to "a great American" and a "dear friend." </p>
<p>"If Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word, you could bank on it. That’s how he got things done for the good of the country for decades," Biden said in a statement. </p>
<p>Reid was a "giant," <a>Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak said in a statement.</a> "Perhaps what I appreciate most about Senator Reid's legacy is he never forgot who he was or where he came from," the Democratic governor said. </p>
<p>Harry Mason Reid was born in a town he would characterize in his autobiography as “a flyspeck on the map” and “a boomtown gone bust.”</p>
<p>To attend high school, Harry had to go 45 miles to Henderson, where he was elected student body president, took up boxing, and met Landra Gould, who would become his wife in 1959. </p>
<p>Boxing would shape his outlook on life. “In a fight, you have nobody to help you,” <a>he told Kevin Iole</a> when selected to the Nevada Boxing Hall of Fame in 2018, adding: “It’s you and that guy across the ring.“</p>
<p>Reid returned to Nevada after law school, and was elected to the state Assembly at the age of 28. He never lacked for ambition; in 1974, he ran for the U.S. Senate but lost by 624 votes to Paul Laxalt. </p>
<p>After his four-year term expired, he took another shot at D.C. and this time he won, capturing a House seat in 1982. At the end of his second House term, when Laxalt retired, Reid captured the Senate seat he had sought 12 years before.</p>
<p>“Reid handled so much of the care and feeding of the caucus,” wrote Jonathan Alter in “The Center Holds: Obama and His Enemies,” “that Obama spoke even to Democratic senators he genuinely liked no more than than two or three times a year.”</p>
<p>For his part, Obama praised Reid’s leadership in the Senate. “Harry has the toughest job in Washington,” Obama told the New York Times in 2010. “He’s done as good a job as anybody could have done. He just grinds it out.”</p>
<p><a>Obama on Tuesday shared a letter</a> he wrote to Reid toward the end of his life. Landra had asked Obama and others to write letters she could read to her husband. </p>
<p>Former Republican House Speaker John Boehner on Tuesday recalled his "honest" friendship with Reid. </p>
<p>"We disagreed on many things, sometimes famously. But we were always honest with each other. In the years after we left public service, that honesty became a bond. Harry was a fighter until the end. RIP, my friend," <a>he said in a statement.</a></p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday <a>praised</a> Reid's "legendary toughness, bluntness, and tenacity." </p>
<p>"I never doubted that Harry was always doing what he earnestly, deeply felt was right for Nevada and our country," McConnell said in a statement. </p>
<p><a>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called</a> Reid "one of the most amazing individuals I have ever met." </p>
<p>“He was tough-as-nails strong, but caring and compassionate, and always went out of his way quietly to help people who needed help," Schumer said in a statement. "He was my leader, my mentor, one of my dearest friends."</p>
<a> said Chris LaCivita</a>, political director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, of Angle’s campaign after Reid won by 5 percentage points.
<p>“We had over 100 judges that we couldn’t get approved, so I had no choice,” Reid <a>told</a> the New York Times several years later. “Either Obama’s presidency would be a joke or Obama’s presidency would be one of fruition.”</p>
<p>Reid also remained a critic of President Donald Trump and his old foes in Congress. “People are under the false impression that Trump created the Republican Congress. Wrong. They created him, they created him," he <a>said</a> in 2017.</p>

<p>Sen. Ben Cardin said Sunday he’s not convinced that the Democrats’ Build Back Better legislation is dead.</p>
<p>“There is unanimity in our caucus that we want to get a bill to the president, and we are working to see what that bill will contain. President Biden is directly involved in these negotiations,” the Maryland Democrat said on “Fox News Sunday.”</p>
<p>“We are prepared to move; we just need to make sure we have unanimity in our caucus and that's what we are working on and we will start on that next week when we return,” Cardin told host Mike Emanuel.</p>
<p>“We want to see it as comprehensive as possible, but we need to make sure we have the votes to pass it, so that means it will be different than some of us would like to see,” he said.</p>
<p>Cardin said Democrats are open to potentially passing some parts of the bill as standalone items.</p>
<p>“That's a strategy decision that's being negotiated. We are open to a way to reach the finish line,” Cardin said.</p>

<div> <div> <header> <h1> Government shutdown averted as Democrats cave </h1> <p> Democrats now say they never planned to force a shutdown and only wanted to highlight insurance problems for retired coal miners. </p> </header> </div> </div>
<p>They went right up to the brink, but Senate Democrats said on Friday night that they never intended to shut down the federal government over a dispute about<b> </b>coal miners’ benefits. </p>
<p>“We’re not going to shut down the government. We’re going to keep it open,” said incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. “We’re going to provide the votes so we don’t shut down.” </p>
<p>At a news conference after his colleagues relented, Manchin conceded that the party hadn’t had enough votes to defeat the spending bill.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re gonna get to the 41 [votes] as of tonight, but we have support to take this fight on,” Manchin said. </p>
<p>As he relented hours later, Manchin said he took McConnell at his word.</p>
<p>“He said he was confident the retirees would not lose benefits next year, including more than 3,000 in his home state of Kentucky,” Manchin said. “And I believe him.”</p>
<p>The last-minute cave by Democrats began on Friday afternoon, when Manchin and other coal-state Democrats had scheduled a news conference to press the benefits issue, but it was abruptly canceled minutes before it was set to begin.</p>
<p>“It’s about as often as an eclipse that we spend the entire weekend here,” said GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona.</p>
<p>The House passed the measure with an overwhelming 326-96 vote, and lawmakers from the lower chamber have already left Washington for the year.</p>
<p>Republicans said Democrats were not getting enough blame for their brinkmanship over the mining matter.</p>
<p> “I’m still waiting for CNN to do that little time clock they always do every time Republicans are about to close down,” said Nevada GOP Sen. Dean Heller. </p>
<p> As of Friday afternoon, federal agencies had begun preparing for a brief shutdown, according to the White House Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p> While Manchin’s Republican colleague from West Virginia, Shelley Moore Capito, indicated she would likely vote against the bill, she noted that futile budget brinkmanship was not the prudent strategy.</p>

<p>President Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi — all of them offered conciliatory statements about Donald Trump's election victory.</p>
<p>Then there was Harry Reid.</p>
<p>Reid hasn't talked to Trump, and Trump has made no effort to contact him, an aide said. </p>
<p>"He will have his say" about Trump during the transition, the aide said. </p>
<p>In an interview the day before the election, Reid blasted Rudy Giuliani as a "wanna-be something" and again attacked the GOP for enabling Trump's rise. </p>
<p>Now Reid says that, since Trump "has emboldened the forces of hate and bigotry in America," the onus is on the president-elect to change that.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention significantly revised its <a>model of the breakdown of Covid-19 variants</a> on Tuesday, estimating the Omicron strain accounted for about 58.6 percent of U.S. cases as of Dec. 25.</p>
<b> </b>likely range where future analysis will fall, of 34 to 94.9 percent of all cases.
<p>The agency said the disparity was due to the rate with which the highly transmissible Omicron spread.</p>
<p>The White House didn't immediately respond to request for comment.</p>
