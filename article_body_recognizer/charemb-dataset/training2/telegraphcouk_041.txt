<header> <h1> Cambridge students' union in 'witch hunt' over racism classes leak </h1> <p> Wolfson College association branded 'Maoist thugs' over their reaction to leaking of 'white supremacy' workshop for freshers </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Ewan Somerville <time> 4 December 2021 • 8:12pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Students' union officials at a Cambridge University college have launched a “witch hunt” for the leakers of mandatory race classes for freshers, in a bid to have them ousted.</p>
<p>A bitter war of words has broken out at Wolfson College with student leaders accusing those they represent of being “very cowardly” and “sowing division”, in the latest woke row to flare at Oxbridge.</p>
<p>It came after students at the college approached The Telegraph with screenshots of compulsory anti-racism workshops all new students were told to attend this autumn term.</p>
<p>The online classes claimed “whiteness is centric” as part of “white supremacy” in modern British society, and covered microaggressions, privilege and intersectionality.</p>
<a>photographer “made them feel unsafe”</a> by asking “gentlemen to help the ladies” dismount a raised platform in ceremonial gowns.
<p>Now the Wolfson College Student Association (WCSA), the students’ union at the mostly postgraduate college, has vowed to find and ban the leakers from the union’s official online forum, where the furore has centred.</p>
<h2>Leak 'sowed division, uncertainty, and distrust'</h2>
<p>Those responsible will be removed from the 450-member WCSA Facebook group, the main noticeboard where vital updates, events and welfare issues are communicated to students since the pandemic forced messages online.</p>
<p>Students have reacted with fury at the “witch hunt”, while the Free Speech Union said a “student mob” had taken control of the college, which counts several country leaders among its alumni.</p>
<p>Scott Dunleavy, the WCSA president, told students in an angry statement last week: "It is disappointing to see that some members of this community want to sow division, uncertainty, and distrust amongst their peers.</p>
<p>“We are proud to support our entire community and address and action issues that affect us all."</p>
<h2>'College authorities should be embarrassed'</h2>
<p>Toby Young, general secretary of the Free Speech Union, said: “The college authorities should be embarrassed. They’ve relinquished their leadership role and the result is that a student mob is now in charge."</p>
<p>He added: "Why would anyone want to go to Wolfson if the college is now run by a group of Maoist thugs in short trousers?”</p>
<p>Wolfson College and its student association did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<h1> Thailand allows visitors to 'The Beach' after three-year closure to recover from mass tourism </h1>
<p> Maya Bay, featured in the Leonardo DiCaprio film, was closed so its ecosystem could recover from the impact of thousands of visitors a day </p>
<div> <div> By Reuters News Agency <time> 4 January 2022 • 1:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Thailand has reopened Maya Bay, a white sand beach made famous by the 2000 film "The Beach" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, more than three years after closing it to allow its ecosystem to recover from the impact of thousands of visitors each day.</p>
<p><a>The beach, surrounded by 328-ft high cliffs,</a> lies on the island of Phi Phi Leh in the Andaman Sea, and is only accessible by boats from nearby spots such as the islands of Phuket or Phi Phi, or mainland Krabi.</p>
<p>Authorities shut the whole of Maya Bay to the public in 2018, saying coral reefs and beach areas had been damaged by constant tourist activities. But since the start of this year some visitors have been allowed to return.</p>
<p>"The sharks have come back, coral reefs are regrowing, and the water is clear again," Yuthasak Supasorn, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"These things show that nature will heal if we give it time, and we have to work to keep it that way too."</p>
<p>Before the coronavirus pandemic, tourism accounted for about 12 per cent of Thailand's economy and was a key driver of growth, with the country attracting 40 million visitors in 2019.</p>
<p>But mass tourism has often come at a cost to the environment in Thailand and other parts of Southeast Asian, with once-beautiful tropical beaches becoming polluted and strewn with garbage.</p>
<p>"Maya Bay is beautiful, it's a marvellous place," said Manuele Panin, a 40-year-old tourist from Italy, who was visiting the beach.</p>
<p>"I think it is fine that it has been closed all this time to protect the nature and allow it to restore and recover."</p>
<header> <h1> Ditch Sunday trading laws during major floods, says think tank backed by Michael Gove </h1> <p> People left unable to buy essential supplies during crises because of restricted hours, report by Bright Blue finds </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Olivia Rudgard, Environment Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Sunday trading laws should be ditched during major floods, a think tank backed by Michael Gove has recommended.</p>
<p>Research by Bright Blue found that there have been more than 50 flash flood events in major urban areas since 2007, <a>including 10 in London</a> and at least seven in Birmingham and the West Midlands.</p>
<p>In previous severe floods, people have been unable to buy essential groceries and cleaning supplies because of restricted Sunday opening hours, the Bright Blue report found.</p>
<p>In <a>a 2015 incident in Lancaster</a>, the city had just one supermarket open, with all the others closed because of a power cut caused by the floods. But the store could not open for longer because of Sunday trading laws.</p>
<p>In England and Wales, large shops over 280 square metres can only open on Sundays for six consecutive hours between 10am and 6pm.</p>
<p>"In future similar situations, <a>relaxation of Sunday trading laws</a> during serious flood emergencies could help ensure food, cleaning supplies and replacement personal items are available to those who need them," the report said.</p>
<p>Helen Jackson, an associate fellow at Bright Blue and the report author, said: "The disruption <a>caused by Storm Arwen</a> highlights the need to make our infrastructure resilient to extreme weather and be more preventative and less reactive.</p>
<p>"This should include limiting the spread of impermeable surfaces in our cities and ensuring basic measures like drain cleaning are not overlooked.</p>
<p>"The recent furore over sewage spills highlighted the importance of adequate drainage and sewerage systems for environmental quality – but this is not just an environmental issue, it is a public safety issue."</p>
<header> <h1> Drought-stricken California goes to war on water waste </h1> <p> Golden State residents face heavy fines for for watering their lawns within two days of rainfall in a new law designed to combat waste </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Marcus Parekh <time> 5 January 2022 • 12:52pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Residents of California face fines of up to $500 (£370) for watering their lawns 48 hours after rainfall, under new rules designed to reduce the effects of droughts.</p>
<p>Under regulations adopted by the State Water Resources Control Board, fines can be applied to those who water their grass within 48 hours of rainfall, fill decorative fountains or wash their cars without a shutoff nozzle on the hose.</p>
<p>However, critics have pointed out that the new rules fail to place any curbs on agricultural production, which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the water that is diverted and pumped for human use each year.</p>
<p>The average person in Britain uses just 76 gallons of water per day.</p>
<p>In October 2021, motorists in the northern California town of Fairfield had to deal with flash floods as a powerful storm drenched communities in the region that were already scarred from devastating wildfires.</p>
<p>The so-called "bomb cyclone" of rain and wind created mudslides and brought down electric lines (below). The weather whiplash followed the busiest wildfire season in Californian history and heightened threats of flash flooding.</p>
<p>The new rules have been introduced despite heavy rain and record snowfall across the state in December, which offered some respite from a crippling drought.</p>
<p>In mid-December, 80 per cent of California was under extreme or exceptional drought conditions, though this was reduced to 30 per cent by the start of this year.</p>
<p>Governor Gavin Newsom last year called for every citizen to reduce their water usage by 15 per cent, but since July, the state’s water usage has only fallen by 6 per cent.</p>
<p>Despite the wet conditions in December, state climatologist Michael Anderson said forecasts show January, February and March could be drier than average.</p>
<p>The new rules will come into effect for one year and provide no exceptions for golf courses or other recreational facilities. Only where water use is necessary for public health and safety will exemptions be granted.</p>
<p>“We need to be prepared for continued drought.”</p>

<h1> Brexit red tape means it is now easier to export haggis to Canada than the EU </h1>
<p> Exports of delicacy to Canada double those to Germany in run-up to Burns Night, as MacSween chief warns small producers will be hardest hit </p>
<div> <div> By James Crisp, Europe Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:03pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Haggis makers have warned in the run up to Burns Night that it is now easier to export the delicacy to Canada than Europe because of <a>EU red tape after Brexit</a>.</p>
<p>James MacSween, the managing director of third generation family firm MacSween, the market leader, said his exports to the EU would be halved this year. Expat Scots now face missing out on the traditional January 25 <a>Burns Night haggis feast</a>.</p>
<p>“It has become significantly more difficult to do just routine trade into Europe,” said Mr MacSween. “It is challenging to get stuff into Europe. There’s no denying it.”</p>
<p>Since Brexit took <a>legal effect on Dec 31 2020</a>, haggis, which is <a>made from lamb, beef, oats, onions and spices</a>, has faced EU export rules for products of animal origin from non-EU countries.</p>
<p>“It’s easier for me to export haggis to Canada. I’ve got experience of Canada. Canada now recognises that I’m an exporter, I'm approved for Canada,” Mr MacSween said.</p>
<h2>Heat treatment and health certificates</h2>
<p>The Edinburgh-based company will export 3.5 tonnes of haggis to Canada this year, which is double the amount being sent to Germany.</p>
<p>MacSween exported about 3.5 tonnes of haggis to Germany, the biggest EU haggis market, to beat 2020’s end of year Brexit deadline and secure supplies for the last Burns Night.</p>
<p>This year the company has exported half as much.</p>
<p>Before Brexit, a haggis exported to Germany could simply be put on a pallet on a truck. Now, the pallet must be heat treated and documents, including an export health certificate, packing list and commercial invoice, provided.</p>
<p>“The amount of protocol that I have to do to get into France and Germany is the same as I have to do for Singapore and Canada,” Mr MacSween said.</p>
<p>Those restrictions also apply in Northern Ireland, which, <a>under the terms of its protocol</a>, continues to follow some EU rules to avoid a hard Irish border.</p>
<h2>‘Nothing to do with food safety’</h2>

<p>A Defra spokesman said haggis was an “iconic Scottish product” and the Government wanted producers to succeed as the dish gained in global popularity.</p>

<p>“It’s almost as if the impasse had nothing to do with food safety,” he added.</p>
<p>Alyn Smith, the Scottish National Party MP for Stirling and former MEP, said the haggis situation was “beyond bonkers”.</p>
<p>“There’s a wider context here that there is not a single product that has had an advantage from Brexit. Not a single one,” he said.</p>

<header> <h1> Travelling to Mars may speed up the ageing process and ruin any hope of reaching the Red Planet </h1> <p> Scientists at the Mayo Clinic hope to prevent such trips from triggering a lethal process known as cell senescence </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor <time> 1 January 2022 • 8:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Travelling to Mars may speed up the ageing process - making it dangerous to send humans to the Red Planet, scientists fear. </p>
<p>Many space agencies, including Nasa, have embarked on plans to put humans on Mars, with SpaceX planning to launch the first manned flights as early as 2026.</p>
<p>However scientists at the world-renowned Mayo Clinic hope to prevent such trips from triggering a lethal ageing process known as cell senescence, and in February will start the first-ever study into the phenomena in astronauts.</p>
<p>The team will be taking blood and urine samples from four members of the first all-civilian crew to fly to the International Space Station (ISS), to see if they can spot early signs of senescence. </p>
<p>The ISS lies within the protective magnetic bubble known as the Van Allen belt, which shields the Earth from radiation and the crew will be there for only 10 days. </p>
<p>Dr James Kirkland, an expert on cellular ageing at Mayo, said: “This flight will give us an idea of whether routine spaceflight, without even going beyond the Van Allen belt, is associated with cell senescence. </p>
<p>“If we see senescence even under these conditions, we would certainly want to do some work in preparation for a longer mission. Something will have to be worked out before or longer before interplanetary flights are really feasible.”</p>
<p>Without them, wounds heal much more slowly. In those younger years, the zombie cells are cleared away afterwards, but as people age, the immune system loses the ability to sweep them away.</p>
<p>“You find senescence in conditions where cells are under stress, and they deform,” added Dr Kirkland.</p>
<p>“Zero gravity results in changes in cell shape, and the high G-force when a rocket takes off could also conceivably contribute to DNA cellular senescence. </p>
<p>“We’ve found in preliminary studies very low doses of atomic radiation can drive a cell into senescence at much lower levels than x-rays or gamma rays.</p>
<p>“And, with atomic radiation, it could pass right through the spacecraft: it’s hard to stop. So if there’s a Mars mission this could really be a major problem.</p>
<p>“I’m a physician, not a space scientist, so my view is biased, but I’d say the health problem is pretty darn bad, and I’m very worried after what I’ve seen.”</p>
<p>Larry Connor will serve as the mission Pilot. Mark Pathy and Eytan Stibbe will be flying to the station as Mission Specialists.</p>
<p>The crew will also be taking up various kinds of human cells that are in a pre-senescent state in special incubators, to see if the conditions on the ISS tip them over into an early dormancy.</p>
<p>Luckily, if the team does find out that spaceflight causes cellular ageing there may be hope. There are currently 15 clinical trials under way in drugs called senolytics, which may fight the process. </p>
<p>There are even hopes that the drugs could be used in donor organs to ‘turn back the clock’ before they are transplanted into younger people. </p>
<p>“We will need to develop these or other drugs that target fundamental ageing processes to see if we can mitigate the damage before we go to Mars,” Dr Kirkland added. “I am touching wood that these drugs will work.”</p>
<h1> Watch: Goldfish can drive a car ... (as long as the tank isn’t empty) </h1>
<p> We could be carpooling with the popular pets in years to come, as scientists have trained them to manoeuvre a ‘fish-operated vehicle’ </p>
<div> <div> By Joe Pinkstone, Science Correspondent <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:14pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>If a team of scientists were to teach a goldfish to do anything, driving a car might not be what immediately springs to mind.</p>
<p>But that is exactly what a pioneering group of researchers have done.</p>
<p>Scientists have managed to teach goldfish to drive and they say the marine animals are as adept at navigating on land as they are in their natural habitats.</p>
<p>The researchers placed the fish inside a “fish operated vehicle” (FOV) and let the small creatures take the wheel.</p>
<p>Six goldfish managed to master the skill of navigating when placed in a tank, which was put atop a specially made four-wheeled robot.</p>
<p>The FOV was created by scientists at the Ben-Gurion University in Israel and the results of the study are published in the journal Behavioural Brain Research.</p>
<p>The robot moved in the direction the fish swam, and this was tracked with a complex of scanners, detectors and cameras.</p>
<p>A team of biomedical engineers and neuroscientists were able to train goldfish to drive the “car” and navigate themselves to targets to win rewards of fish pellets.</p>
<p>Each fish learned to steer towards a pink target in a three metre by four metre room to earn themselves a food pellet.</p>
<p>Like learner drivers, the goldfish gradually improved at their task and still got to their destinations when targets were moved and decoy targets of different colours were added.</p>
<p>The authors of the study said: "We trained goldfish to use a fish operated vehicle (FOV), a wheeled terrestrial platform that reacts to the fish's movement characteristics, location and orientation in its water tank.</p>
<p>"The fish were tasked to 'drive' the FOV towards a visual target in the terrestrial environment, which was observable through the walls of the tank.</p>
<p>"[Goldfish] were able to operate the vehicle, explore the new environment, and reach the target regardless of the starting point, all while avoiding dead-ends and correcting location inaccuracies.</p>
<p>The results of the study suggest that if fish somehow adapted to live out of water, they could find their way to food to enable their survival.</p>
<p>“It goes without saying that fish, in general, are not naturally equipped to explore terrestrial environments,” the authors added.</p>
<p>The study was led by PhD student Shachar Givon, Masters student Matan Samina and professors Ohad Ben-Shahar and Ronen Segev.</p>
<p>Ms Givon said: "The study hints that navigational ability is universal rather than specific to the environment.</p>
<p>"Second, it shows that goldfish have the cognitive ability to learn a complex task in an environment completely unlike the one they evolved in.</p>
<p>"As anyone who has tried to learn how to ride a bike or to drive a car knows, it is challenging at first."</p>
<p>Each trial lasted 30 minutes, during which the number of times the fish reached the target, how long it took them and the distance travelled each time were recorded.</p>
<p>The authors added: "When this mapping is learned by the fish, it can drive the vehicle to any location in the terrestrial environment.</p>
<p>"The findings here show that the fish were able to control the FOV and solve navigation tasks in this terrestrial environment.</p>
<p>"The fish became progressively more proficient on the task and by the last session exhibited control of the FOV and a high level of success."</p>

<h1> Don't assume your children are taught well at school, warns Britain’s strictest headteacher </h1>
<p> Katharine Birbalsingh, of the Social Mobility Commission, says there has 'never been a better time' for parents to give lessons at home </p>
<div> <div> By Camilla Turner, Education Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 9:33pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Do not assume your children are being “taught well” at school, the social mobility tsar has warned, as she says parents must give lessons at home as well.</p>
<p>Katharine Birbalsingh said there has “never been a better time” for mothers and fathers to teach their children at home. </p>
<p>Ms Birbalsingh, who was appointed as the chairman of the Social Mobility Commission last October, has been labelled <a>Britain’s strictest headteacher.</a></p>
<a>her rules mean pupils can earn a detention</a> for offences ranging from turning up to class without a ruler to breaching the silence policy by speaking in corridors.
<p>She told her social media followers that “just eating dinner together and parents talking to their children makes such a difference to the development of a child”.</p>
<p>While schools can try to make up for this, she said, there is “only so much a school can do”.</p>
<p>Ms Birbalsingh advised parents to carry out one-to-one instruction which could be revisited before bedtime.</p>
<p>Last month, she claimed that private school pupils’ learning is “stunted” and they are having to rely on parents to hire personal tutors.</p>
<p>She said she pities children who are educated at fee-paying schools, because they are “not being taught properly” during lessons.</p>
<p>“I look at those private schools and think gosh, they could be so much better. And they could be pushing children so much more and teaching them so much more," the headteacher explained. </p>
<h2>Dumbing down of standards</h2>
<p>She earned a standing ovation for her scathing attack on a “culture of excuses” and the dumbing down of standards in schools, which she said had driven her from being a Marxist to voting Tory for the first time that year.</p>
<header> <h1> What Plan B Covid restrictions mean for schools </h1> <p> The reintroduction of mandatory face masks in classrooms will last until January 26 </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matthew Robinson <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:42am </time> </div> </div>
<p>As pupils return to school after the Christmas holidays, those in Year 7 and above are being asked to wear face masks in classrooms again - after ministers drew up contingency plans to keep schools open amid fears of widespread teacher absences.</p>
<p>The Education Secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said the move was designed to help "maximise the number of children in school" and would remain only as long as needed, amid fears of omicron disrupting teaching in schools.</p>
<p>The Telegraph also has confirmation that more drastic proposals include <a>prioritising GCSE and A-Level students for face-to-face teaching</a>, should schools be hit by staff absences.</p>
<p>With the latest update revealing the continuation of <a>Plan B Covid measures</a> until Jan 26, the reintroduction of mandatory face masks in classrooms will last until this date, according to Mr Zahawi.</p>
<a>backlash, following the decision to reimpose mask-wearing in secondary schools</a>, with Tory MPs, a government scientific adviser, charities and parents' groups warning of the long-term impact of masks on children's mental health.
<h2>Which pupils have to wear face masks? </h2>
<p>In primary schools, face masks are still recommended to be worn by staff and adults when moving around in corridors and communal areas, but not in classrooms. Children in primary schools are not advised to wear face coverings. </p>
<h2>Will bubbles return? </h2>
<a>Covid</a>, the entire class or year group does not need to be sent home to isolate. 
<p>School assemblies, and break time mixing can still take place. </p>
<p>However, the Government warns that schools should ensure that contingency plans cover the possibility that it may become necessary to reintroduce bubbles for a temporary period in order to reduce mixing between groups. </p>
<p>"And decision to recommend the reintroduction of bubbles would not be taken lightly and would need to take account of the detrimental impact they can have on the delivery of education," it says. </p>
<h2>Can children still go to school if their parents test positive?</h2>

<h1> Revealed: The secret teenage British resistance force taught to garrote Nazi soldiers and build Molotov cocktails </h1>
<p> Made up of hand-selected recruits, many of them young girls, the youth army was trained to maim and kill during the Second World War </p>
<div> <div> By Martin Evans, Crime Correspondent <time> 2 January 2022 • 7:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Most people tend to associate tales of wartime resistance with France, but new research has revealed details of a secret civilian army of British teenagers, trained to strike back at the Nazis should they ever invade.</p>
<p>Made up of hand-selected recruits, many of them young girls, the British resistance was primed to sabotage German infrastructure and assassinate key enemy personnel.</p>
<p>Trained in unarmed combat and self-defence, the young women were taught to use stealth in order to approach their targets before mercilessly garroting them.</p>
<p>Others were taught to be sharp shooters or were instructed in building and deploying Molotov cocktails and other improvised explosive devices.</p>
<p>Far from the Dad’s Army image of the bumbling Home Guard, the secret resistance army - known as Section VII - was ruthless and deadly, having been highly trained by specialists from the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS).</p>
<p>Because the invasion never took place and owing to the fact all recruits had to sign the Official Secrets Act, very little was known about the members of Section VII.</p>
<p>But a new book to be published this year hopes to lift the lid on this previously hidden part of British wartime history.</p>
<h2>'Trained to kill and maim'</h2>
<p>Section VII was established in 1940 after the SIS had been deployed overseas to help train some foreign resistance movements.</p>
<p>With Britain also under threat of invasion, the Churchill government began preparing for the worst-case scenario and ordered the establishment of a secret homegrown army of saboteurs and assassins.</p>
<p>In keeping with the resistance movements in much of occupied Europe, many of the recruits were females, who were trained to eliminate the enemy by any means necessary.</p>
<p>Among those to join up was Irene Lockley from the village of South Milford in West Yorkshire.</p>
