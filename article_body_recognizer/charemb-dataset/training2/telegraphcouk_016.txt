<header> <h1> The best air purifiers for your home </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 19 February 2021 • 2:32pm </time> </div> </div>
<a>WHO</a>, pollution has become one of the primary health concerns of the 21st century. 
<a>pollution reducing house plants</a>. One of the most popular, however, is the air purifier, with sales at John Lewis jumping by 62 per cent in the year up to February 2019. 
<p>Price-wise, you’re looking at £100 for an entry price purifier, but up to £500 for top-of-the-range. </p>
<a>Which? investigation</a>, the machines can cost £72 per year to run. You’ll also have to buy new filters, roughly annually, which can cost around £50. 
<ul><li><a>Telegraph Recommended's best dehumidifiers</a></li></ul>
<h3>1. Dyson Pure hot + cool link air purifier </h3>
<p>Why we like it: It doubles up as a fan and heater, and the app's very easy to use</p>
<p><a>£549.99, Argos</a></p>
<p>It’s an unobtrusive machine which spins around almost 360 degrees – in fact it was the slenderest of the air purifiers I reviewed.</p>
<p>You’ll get stats on: overall air quality; PM2.5 and PM10s (particles); VOCs (volatile organic compounds); nitrogen dioxide; temperature, humidity and more.</p>
<p>Overall, I felt it won out due to its size, versatility and ease of use. It is, however, rather pricey, though most of the best purifiers are. </p>
<h3>2. Blueair Classic 405 air purifier </h3>
<p>Why we like it: A well designed app with unparalleled levels of information </p>
<p><a>£499, John Lewis Partners</a></p>
<p>The app allows you to easily toggle through the purifier's functions, like nighttime mode, a timer and fan speeds.</p>
<h3>3. Philips air purifier 2000i </h3>
<p>Why we like it: Not too loud, easy to set up and a quality app </p>
<p><a>£335, Amazon</a></p>
<p>The app goes into far more detail than others – should you be wearing a mask today? There's only one way to find out. Ultimately, much of it is unnecessary, but it's still vaguely interesting. </p>
<div> <div> <p><a>Buy now </a></p> <h3>4. Vax Pure Air 200 air purifier </h3> <p><a>£260, Next</a></p> </div> </div>
<p>The functions are more paired back, but you do still get nighttime mode, a timer and a remote control. I liked the easy-carry handles on either side, too, which made it easily transferable. </p>
<p>All in all, a solid device, if short of the bells and whistles of some pricier models. It was a little let down by the volume – it is certainly noisy. </p>
<h3>5. Meaco Clean air purifier </h3>
<p><a>£349.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>A big white square of a purifier, the Meaco was relatively quiet, and claims to filter out everything from pollen, dust and smoke to mould spores, pollution, viruses, bacteria and gases. Impressive. </p>
<p>It was very easy to set up (it came with few instructions), but didn't provide connectivity for in-depth information. The light was also very strong, though there is a nighttime mode. </p>
<h3>6. HoMedics TotalClean 5 in 1 tower air purifier </h3>
<p><a>£219.02, Amazon</a></p>
<p>Overall it's fine, but noisy, and it doesn't give you the connectivity and in-depth information of the better models. </p>

<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> ‘My flat is so damp there’s black mould on my bed sheets – yet the landlord says there’s no problem’ </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Katie Morley <div>Consumer Champion</div> <time> 2 September 2019 • 7:00am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<blockquote> <p>Has a company treated you unfairly? Our consumer champion, Katie Morley, is here to help. For how to contact her click here. </p> </blockquote>
<p>I am writing on behalf of myself, my partner and my neighbours, who recently moved into newly renovated flats in south London.</p>
<p>When we viewed the properties they were unfinished but we were assured they would be ready when we moved in. However, they were not, and we feel we were misled about the state of the property.</p>
<p>On top of a long list of other issues, we discovered that the flats were not registered with the council so we couldn’t access basic services such as the GP or to register to vote, nor could we insure our belongings.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t long before we discovered the flats had poor plumbing and suffered from leaks and mould. The mould has become so bad it has ruined our clothes, shoes and furniture. Recently, black wet patches have been appearing on my bedding. </p>
<p>My mother is a cancer patient and has been advised not to visit my flat as the mould could interfere with the chemotherapy treatment she is undergoing.</p>
<p>Living here is causing us great stress and has put a strain on my relationship. I have developed a skin condition, which I’ve never had before.</p>
<p>Gillcrest, the managing agent appointed by the landlord, has not accepted any responsibility and refuses to pay any compensation.</p>
<p>Having lived in a number of rampantly mouldy, mouse-infested flats throughout my 20s, I can sympathise with the upset caused by living in substandard rented accommodation.</p>
<p>Under new rules called the Housing Act, introduced in March, landlords must take steps to fix serious damp problems, such as those you describe in your flat, or you can take legal action.</p>
<p>I supplied it with evidence supporting your claims, including photos of the mould, which was forming all over the flat and your belongings, potentially posing a health risk.</p>
<p>You made a list of all the items damaged by mould and their value totalled £1,830. These were not insured as you did not have a registered address for insurance purposes. I understand the flat has now, finally, been registered.</p>
<p>I suspect the real root of the problem may have been the extractor fan in the bathroom, which did not appear to be fit for purpose.</p>
<p>When it came to the full survey results, Gillcrest said they were confidential and refused to share them.</p>
<p>Then in a cruel twist, Gillcrest decided it wanted you out. It swiftly served you and your neighbour with unexplained eviction notices.</p>
<p>I have been worried about the toll this episode has taken on your health and mental well-being. You have truly been pushed to the brink of despair.</p>
<p>Gillcrest, on the other hand, hasn’t shown much human compassion, and appears to view you as an inconvenience to its day-to-day business.</p>
<p>Despite the distress it has caused you and the damage the mould has done to your personal property, Gillcrest has offered you no compensation. You have reported Gillcrest to your council and plan to take it to the small claims court.</p>
<p>If you have been affected by issues raised in this article you can get free advice from Shelter, the housing charity. Freephone 0808 800 4444 or contact its webchat team at england.shelter.org.uk.</p>
