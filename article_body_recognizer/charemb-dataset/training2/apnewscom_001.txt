<div><div><h1>Biden pushed to speak out more as US democracy concerns grow</h1></div><div>By COLLEEN LONG and ZEKE MILLER January 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has gotten the same troubling questions from worried world leaders, ones that he never thought he would hear.</p>
<p>“Is America going to be all right?” they ask. “What about democracy in America?” </p>
<a>changes by Republicans to election laws</a> in several states.
<a>voting rights legislation</a> that its adherents say could be the only effective way to counter the rapidly emerging threats to the democratic process.
<a>the coronavirus pandemic</a> and the economy and the less visible, but equally vital, issue of preserving trust in elections and government.
<p>The president plans to deliver a speech on Jan. 6 focused on sustaining democracy — voting rights won’t be part of the remarks but will be the topic of another speech soon, White House aides said.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Images of chaos: AP photographers capture US Capitol riot</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We were trapped': Trauma of Jan. 6 lingers for lawmakers</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We have to be there': AP photographer recalls Capitol siege</h4></a></div></li>
<p>In his recent <a>commencement address at South Carolina State University</a>, Biden’s tone on the need for voting rights legislation took on added urgency.</p>
<p>And the world is taking notice. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, also has said that the riot at the Capitol has altered the view many countries have of the United States.</p>
<p>In contrast, Republicans in numerous states are promoting efforts to influence future elections by installing sympathetic leaders in local election posts and backing for elective office some of those who participated in the insurrection.</p>
<p>In Biden’s view, many of Trump’s voters didn’t wholly embrace Trumpism. Instead, Trump exploited long-standing <a>dissatisfaction with the nation’s political</a>, economic and social systems to build his coalition. </p>
<p>So Biden tailored his first-year domestic agenda to combating what he believed to be the root causes of the unease — the shaky economy and the pandemic’s drag on it — essentially to prove that government can work effectively.</p>
<p>He has directed federal law enforcement to shore up security at national institutions and improve communication systems and procedures that were in part to blame for U.S. Capitol Police being left overwhelmed for hours during the mob assault.</p>
<p>The <a>Justice Department has undertaken</a> the largest prosecution in its history, charging more than 700 defendants and still looking for more.</p>
<p>But it is voting rights that many Democrats and activists concerned about what may happen in 2022 and beyond are urging the president to make a key priority. </p>
<p>Manchin and Sinema have helped draft separate voting rights legislation, but it lacks enough Republican support to overcome the filibuster.</p>
<p>Welch was at the Capitol on Jan. 6, and the violence that day is etched in his memory.</p>
<p>“The norms that have been the bedrock of our democracy, the free and peaceful transition of power and the renunciation of violence, they’ve been shattered,” he said.</p>
<p> “Did you ever think you’d be asked that question by another leader?” Biden said.</p>
<div><div><h1>Investigation of journalists by Customs unit is under review</h1></div><div>By BEN FOXJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The review was initially reported by Yahoo News, which last month was also <a>first to report on the OIG investigation</a>. </p>

<p>“We do not condone the investigation of reporters for exercising those rights,” Miranda said. “CBP is committed to conducting its law enforcement and national security mission with adherence to the highest standards.” </p>
<p>The inspector general report was sparked after The Washington Post exposed Rambo and a leak investigation involving reporter Ali Watkins, who was with Politico at the time and now writes for The New York Times.</p>
<p>In the course of its investigation, the inspector general found that the Customs unit was using its vast databases to investigate others as well, including Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington and AP investigative reporter Martha Mendoza.</p>
<p>Rambo said he conducted CBP record checks on “15 to 20 national security reporters,” according to a FBI summary of the questioning that was contained in the inspector general’s report. </p>
<div><div><h1>3 lawmakers attended conspiracy conference on taxpayer dime</h1></div><div>January 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>SEATTLE (AP) — Documents show three Republican lawmakers from Washington used taxpayer dollars to attend MyPillow chief executive Mike Lindell’s election fraud symposium in South Dakota in August. </p>
<p>Lindell said he’d provide “irrefutable” evidence the 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump by hackers. The event, rife with debunked conspiracy theories, produced no such proof.</p>
<p>Kraft and Sutherland defended their attendance in emails, saying they’ll use information gleaned there to develop election-related legislation.</p>
<p>Klippert, who did not respond to the newspaper’s request for comment, sponsored bills during the 2020 legislative session seeking to change the state’s election system.</p>
<p>State House Chief Clerk Bernard Dean said state lawmakers have fairly broad latitude to be reimbursed for travel to events connected to their legislative work. Each member has a $9,000 annual allotment for such travel.</p>
<div><div><h1>Jan. 6 attack posed loyalty test for Indiana Rep. Greg Pence</h1></div><div>By BRIAN SLODYSKOJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Greg Pence watched the Jan. 6 insurrection unfold from an extraordinary perch. </p>
<a>Democrat Joe Biden’s win</a>.
<a>pleading for help to clear rioters</a> from the building.
<a>the House Jan. 6 committee</a>, which is investigating the origins of the insurrection that Trump fomented when he urged his supporters to march on the Capitol and
<a>“fight like hell.”</a>
<p>Pence has largely declined to discuss what transpired while he was with his brother that day, other than praising his brother as a hero for standing up to Trump. </p>
<p>His silence serves as powerful evidence of the grip that Trump still holds on his party, which has led many Republicans to dispute the seriousness of the attack and instead perpetuate the lie that Trump was wrongly denied a second term.</p>
<p>Pence declined last month to speak with The Associated Press at the Capitol. A spokesperson did not respond to multiple inquiries seeking comment.</p>
<p>Pence turned his focus in 2006 to operating antique malls he purchased with his wife, Denise, a business now worth between $5 million and $25 million, according to his congressional financial disclosure. </p>
<p>When Mike Pence’s former congressional seat opened up in 2018, his brother ran a stealthy campaign. Granting few interviews and ducking debates, he coasted to victory.</p>
<p>“I looked into the mirror and said, ‘If not me, who?’” Greg Pence told his hometown newspaper, The Columbus Republic, in a rare interview during the campaign. </p>
<p>But he also expressed deep ambivalence about the job, as well as a lack of conviction that would likely have doomed other candidates.</p>
<p>One area in which he has excelled is fundraising, raising far more money than the average first-term member of Congress. </p>
<p>Pence also has enjoyed the trappings of political life, spending over $49,000 at Trump-owned properties, while paying Trump’s pollster $137,000 during his 2018 race when there was little doubt he would win, campaign finance disclosures show.</p>
<p>So far, Democrats who serve on the committee have been tight-lipped about whether Greg Pence could be called for an interview or asked to submit documents.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to talk about any individual being called,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, a California Democrat on the committee, when asked whether an interview with Pence would be sought. </p>
<a>against forming a committee</a> to investigate the origins of the attack, calling it “bass-ackwards.” He also voted against impeaching Trump.
<p>But perhaps the most significant vote was in the immediate aftermath of the attack. </p>
<p>Hours after emerging from a secure location, Mike Pence gaveled the joint session of Congress back in and presided over the certification of the election, despite Trump’s demands.</p>
<p>Greg Pence, meanwhile, joined scores of other Republicans who sided with Trump and cast a vote rejecting the outcome in Pennsylvania, the state that clinched the election for Biden.</p>
<div><div><h1>Someone in Palm Beach tells New Yorkers leave if ‘woke’</h1></div><div>January 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Someone had a warning for New Yorkers visiting former President Donald Trump’s new hometown — leave if you are “woke.”</p>
<p>Some conservatives, however, use the word as an insult against liberals, saying it means the person is overly sensitive and moralizing and sees racism where it does not exist.</p>
<p>Trump became one of Palm Beach’s 8,800 residents in 2019, moving from his native New York City. He said in a <a>Fox News interview</a> last year “that being woke means you are a loser.”</p>
<p>Palm Beach has a heavy influx of tourists at this time of year, with visits to its resorts, restaurants and beach.</p>
<p><a>The Palm Beach Post</a> reported the notices concerned some residents, who said they seemed to show a lack of respect for those with different opinions and could be seen as a threat.</p>
<p>Police Capt. Will Rothrock told the newspaper the department is investigating to see if any laws were violated. He said it is unknown how many cars were targeted because not all the fliers were reported.</p>
<p>“We understand that the lack of civility and respect for personal property displayed by this is concerning,” he said.</p>
<div><div><h1>GOP Missouri Rep. Hill resigning for Florida consulting job</h1></div><div>January 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Suburban St. Louis-area Republican Rep. Justin Hill, known for skipping his own inauguration last year to oppose President Joe Biden’s election, on Monday announced he’s resigning from the Missouri House.</p>
<p>Hill said he’s leaving to work as a consultant in Florida. He didn’t immediately return an Associated Press call to his Capitol office Tuesday. </p>
<p>On top of Hill’s planned resignation, Republican Rep. Aaron Griesheimer previously told the Missourian that he’s also leaving for another job. Without the two of them, there will be 108 Republican House members.</p>
<div><div><h1>Despite brutal video, only GOP minority say 1/6 very violent</h1></div><div>By FARNOUSH AMIRIJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Video cameras captured the violence live, with rioters clubbing officers with flag polls and fire extinguishers, even squeezing one between doors as he begged for his life.</p>
<p>Their views were a distinct minority as overall about two-thirds of Americans described the day as very or extremely violent, including about 9 in 10 Democrats.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>'We were trapped': Trauma of Jan. 6 lingers for lawmakers</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We have to be there': AP photographer recalls Capitol siege</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<a>a false portrayal</a> of the siege taking hold despite extensive footage that shows the ransacking of the building in harrowing detail. Trump and some allies in Congress and conservative media have
<a>played it down</a>, falsely characterizing the attack as a minor civil disturbance.
<p>It’s a view that is shared by many Republicans, though few go so far as to defend the rioters themselves.</p>
<p>Bender, who said he didn’t keep up with the news coverage, added, “There were certainly outlier people who were not peaceful and were breaking through the windows and stuff like that, but I wasn’t aware of overt violence.”</p>
<a>blame Trump</a> for the Jan. 6 riot has grown slightly over the past year, with 57% saying he bears significant responsibility for what took place. In an AP-NORC poll taken in the days after the attack, 50% said that.
<p>The uptick is seen among Republicans as well, even as relatively few think Trump bears significant responsibility. Twenty-two percent say that now, up from 11% last year. Sixty percent say he had little to no responsibility.</p>
<a>his election loss to Joe Biden</a>. After Trump’s
<a>baseless claims of voter fraud</a> were
<a>“fight like hell”</a> as Congress convened to certify the election results. The attack halted that process for hours as rioters occupied the building.
<p>Still, while few Republicans blame Trump, Republicans and Democrats alike overwhelmingly say that the individual rioters had a great deal or quite a bit of responsibility for their actions during the riot.</p>
<p>About 7 in 10 Americans also say a <a>House select committee</a> should continue its investigation of the attack, while about 3 in 10 say it should not. </p>
<p>Robert Spry, a Democrat in Kingman, Arizona, said the congressional investigation is crucial for getting at the truth.</p>
<p>“We need a comprehensive report of that day. It has got to come to light what those people did to police and to that building,” Spry said.</p>
<p>Forty-one percent of Republicans agree with Spry that Congress should continue to investigate, while 58% say it should not.</p>
<p>Bell said a federal investigation into what she saw as “a terrorist attack” is appropriate, but she objects to the way the nine-member panel has been conducting the investigation since July of last year.</p>
<a>rejecting the choices of House GOP leadership</a>.

<p>A Fox News spokesperson declined to comment on the request. Jay Sekulow, Hannity’s lawyer, told The Associated Press Tuesday night that they are reviewing the committee’s letter and “will respond as appropriate.”</p>

<p>Here’s a transcript of Trump’s Jan. 6 speech:</p>
<p>Well, thank you very much. This is incredible.</p>
<p>Media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on today, I looked, and I saw thousands of people here. But you don’t see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don’t want to show that. </p>
<p>Even when you look at last night. They’re all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes. Nobody knows what the hell is going on. There’s never been anything like this.</p>
<p>We will not let them silence your voices. We’re not going to let it happen, I’m not going to let it happen.</p>
<p>(Audience chants: “Fight for Trump.”)</p>
<p>And Rudy, you did a great job. He’s got guts. You know what? He’s got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican Party. He’s got guts. He fights, he fights.</p>
<p>And he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so.</p>
<p>(Audience chants: “We love Trump.”)</p>
<p>By the way, this goes all the way back past the Washington Monument. You believe this? Look at this. That is. Unfortunately gave, they gave the press the prime seats. I can’t stand that.</p>
<p>No. But you look at that behind. I wish they’d flip those cameras and look behind you. That is the most amazing sight. When they make a mistake, you get to see it on television. Amazing. Amazing. All the way back.</p>
<p>And don’t worry, we will not take the name off the Washington Monument. We will not cancel culture.</p>
<p>And they could use Rudy back in New York City. Rudy. They could use you. Your city’s going to hell. They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York. We’ll get a little younger version of Rudy. Is that OK, Rudy?</p>
<p>We’re gathered together in the heart of our nation’s capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: To save our democracy.</p>
<p>They said, “Sir, in four years, you’re guaranteed.” I said: “I’m not interested right now. Do me a favor, go back eight weeks. I want to go back eight weeks. Let’s go back eight weeks.”</p>
<p>We want to go back and we want to get this right because we’re going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we’re not going to stand for that.</p>
<p>They’re weak Republicans, they’re pathetic Republicans and that’s what happens.</p>
<p>That election, our election was over at 10 o’clock in the evening. We’re leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds of thousands of votes.</p>
<p>And then late in the evening, or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bull——.</p>
<p>And all of a sudden. All of a sudden it started to happen. </p>
<p>(Audience chants: “Bull——.”)</p>
<p>But we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we’ve never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back. </p>
<p>You know, America is blessed with elections. All over the world they talk about our elections. You know what the world says about us now? They said, we don’t have free and fair elections.</p>
<p>No third-world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing. And you’ll hear about that in just a few minutes. </p>
<p>And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn’t, that will be a, a sad day for our country because you’re sworn to uphold our Constitution.</p>
<p>Now, it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you, we’re going to walk down, we’re going to walk down.</p>
<p>Anyone you want, but I think right here, we’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.</p>
<p>Because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.</p>
<p>I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. </p>
<p>Used to take 20 years to get a highway approved, now we’re down to two. I want to get it down to one, but we’re down to two. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down to safety.</p>
<p>We created Space Force, We, we, we. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create Space Force which, by and of itself, is a major achievement for an administration. And with us it’s one of so many different things. </p>
<p>So we’ve taken care of things, we’ve done things like nobody’s ever thought possible. And that’s part of the reason that many people don’t like us, because we’ve done too much. </p>
<p>And we set a record with Hispanic, with the Black community, we set a record with everybody. </p>
<p>And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget.</p>
<p>They gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know? And then when they found out a few weeks later, again, it took them four years to devise this screen.</p>
<p>But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women. I also want to thank our 13, most courageous members of the U.S. Senate. Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley, Kelly Loeffler.</p>
<p>And Kelly Loeffler, I’ll tell you, she has been, she’s been so great. She worked so hard. So let’s give her and David a little special hand because it was rigged against them. Let’s give her and David. </p>
<p>Kelly Loeffler, David Purdue. They fought a good race. They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and I was telling these people don’t let him use this stuff.</p>
<p>I actually think though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.</p>
<p>You know, we don’t want to give $2,000 to people. We want to give them $600. Oh, great. How does that play politically? Pretty good? And this has nothing to do with politics, but how does it play politically?</p>
<p>China destroyed these people. We didn’t destroy. China destroy them, totally destroyed them. We want to give them $600 and they just wouldn’t change.</p>
<p>All they, all these people, don’t get bored, don’t get angry at me because you’re going to get bored because it’s so much.</p>
<p>But we don’t have that anymore. We don’t have a fair media anymore. It’s suppression. And you have to be very careful with that and they’ve lost all credibility in this country.</p>
<p>We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we’ve been forced to believe.</p>
<p>And I had a campaign against Michelle Obama and Barack Hussein Obama, against Stacey. </p>
<p>But it almost seems that they’re all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country. To hurt our country. </p>
<p>You know, I read a story in one of the newspapers recently how I control the three Supreme Court justices. I control them. They’re puppets.</p>
<p>But it shows you the media’s genius. In fact, probably if I was the media, I’d do it the same way. I hate to say it. But we got to get them straightened out.</p>
<p>Today, for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it? </p>
<p>(Audience responds: “Yeah”)</p>
<p>In every single swing state, local officials, state officials, almost all Democrats, made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures. </p>
<p>That these changes paved a way for fraud on a scale never seen before. I think we go a long way outside of our country when I say that. </p>
<p>So, just in a nutshell, you can’t make a change or voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it. No judge can do it. Nobody can do it. Only a legislature. </p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, the Democrat secretary of state and the Democrat state Supreme Court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election. </p>
<p>Who would even think of that? We don’t want to verify a signature? </p>
<p>So in Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters. And the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it’s a total fraud. </p>
<p>Not only are they voting, they want an application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago, died. It’s incredible. Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters, so these are voters that don’t live in this state.</p>
<p>And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome-determinative, meaning these numbers far surpass. I lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive, massive.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day. In other words, they were received after Election Day. Let’s count them anyway.</p>
<p>Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let’s send the ballots. Oh, they’ve already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I don’t think that’s too good, right? </p>
<p>(Audience chants: “Send it back.”)</p>
<p>And many people in Congress want it sent back. </p>
<p>You will have an illegitimate president. That’s what you’ll have. And we can’t let that happen. </p>
<p>I called up a real pollster. I said, “What is that?” “Sir, that’s called a suppression poll. I think you’re going to win Wisconsin, sir.”</p>
<p>I said, “But why don’t they make it four or five points?” Because then people vote. But when you’re down 17, they say, “Hey, I’m not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there’s no way.”</p>
<p>And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media. Every time I put out a tweet, that’s, even if it’s totally correct, totally correct, I get a flag. I get a flag. </p>
<p>They have these lockboxes. And, you know, they’d pick them up and they disappear for two days. People would say where’s that box? They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was.</p>
<p>Your state legislatures said don’t do it. They’re the only ones that can approve it. They gave tens of thousands of votes. They came in in duffle bags. Where the hell did they come from? </p>
<p>These people are crooked. They’re 100%, in my opinion, one of the most corrupt, between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again last night. Just take a look at what happened. What a mess. </p>
<p>And the Democrat Party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitution — unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures.</p>
<p>As a result, Georgia’s absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off. </p>
<p>The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That’s the only way you could explain it. </p>
<p>In Fulton County, Republican poll watchers were ejected, in some cases, physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst. Water main burst, everybody leave. Which we now know was a total lie.</p>
<p>Because of him and others, you have Brian Kemp. Vote him the hell out of office, please. Well, his rates are so low. You know, his approval rating now, I think it just reached a record low. </p>
<p>They’ve rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County. Even without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we’ve identified across the state is staggering. </p>
<p>Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election. </p>
<p>More than 2,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison. People who are not allowed to vote. </p>
<p>More than 4,500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state’s own voter rolls. </p>
<p>Over 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to the Postal Service. </p>
<p>At least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated.</p>
<p>Sixty-six thousand votes, each one of these is far more than we need. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age. </p>
<p>Despite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only 11,779 votes. </p>
<p>Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in Georgia, a big beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me and from the country.</p>
<p>And not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified. </p>
<p>Eleven thousand six hundred more ballots and votes were counted, more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have more votes again than you have voters. </p>
<p>One hundred and fifty thousand people registered in Maricopa County after the registration deadline. One hundred and three thousand ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no Republican observers. </p>
<p>In Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots. </p>
<p>If you signed your name as Santa Claus, it would go through.</p>
<p>The margin in Nevada is down at a very low number, any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won Nevada, also. Every one of these we’re going over, we win. </p>
<p>In Michigan, quickly, the secretary of state, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law.</p>
<p>More than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who were deceased. </p>
<p>In Wayne County, that’s a great one. That’s Detroit. One hundred and seventy-four thousand ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from.</p>
<p>Also, in Wayne County, poll watchers observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times.</p>
<p>In Detroit, turnout was 139% of registered voters. Think of that. So you had 139% of the people in Detroit voting. This is in Michigan. Detroit, Michigan. </p>
<p>At 6:31 a.m. in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes. An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a couple of percentage points went to Trump. </p>
<p>Such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary. </p>
<p>You know what’s interesting? President Obama beat Biden in every state other than the swing states where Biden killed them, but the swing states were the ones that mattered.</p>
<p>They’re always just enough to push Joe Biden barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within a number of hours we were losing by a little. </p>
<p>In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country.</p>
<p>Senator William Ligon, a great gentleman, chairman of Georgia’s senate judiciary subcommittee. Senator Ligon, highly respected, on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with Dominion in Georgia. </p>
<p>Think of it. You go in and you vote and then they tell people who you supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody’s ever even heard. </p>
<p>They adjudicate your vote. They say, Well, we don’t think Trump wants to vote for Trump. We think he wants to vote for Biden. Put it down for Biden.</p>
<p>The letter continues. There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia. </p>
<p>(Audience chants: “We love you.”) </p>
<p>I could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it. There’s never been anything like it.</p>
<p>It’s a disgrace that the United States of America, tens of millions of people, are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification.</p>
<p>In no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity, citizenship, residency or eligibility of the votes cast.</p>
<p>So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he’s listening to.</p>
<p>We won in a landslide. This was a landslide. They said it’s not American to challenge the election. This the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world. </p>
<p>You know, you could go third-world countries, but I don’t think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don’t have voters for them. I mean no matter where you go, nobody would think this. </p>
<p>In fact, it’s so egregious, it’s so bad that a lot of people don’t even believe it. It’s so crazy that people don’t even believe it. It can’t be true. So they don’t believe it. </p>
<p>This is not just a matter of domestic politics, this is a matter of national security.</p>
<p>So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I’m calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left. </p>
<p>Today is not the end, it’s just the beginning. </p>
<p>With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that.</p>
<p>I say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the fakeness, and they challenge almost everything we say.</p>
<p>But our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech, and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in history. There’s never been a movement like that. </p>
<p>You look back there all the way to the Washington Monument. It’s hard to believe. </p>
<p>We must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can never be allowed to happen again. </p>
<p>We will also require proof of American citizenship in order to vote in American elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one, actually. </p>
<p>We will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. Therefore, they get disapp — they disappear, and then all of a sudden they show up. It’s fraudulent. </p>
<p>We will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting. </p>
<p>We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner. </p>
<p>We will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on Election Day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice.</p>
<p>We will finally hold big tech accountable. And if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in America, in the world has.</p>
<p>Despite everything we’ve been through, looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds. Although this, I think, is our all-time record. I think you have 250,000 people. 250,000.</p>
<p>If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it’s illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information.</p>
<p>We are the greatest country on Earth and we are headed and were headed in the right direction. </p>
<p>But now, the caravans, I think Biden’s getting in, the caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and rip off our country. Can’t let it happen.</p>
<p>As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We love our country. </p>
<p>We have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people.</p>
<p>Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements, still away. </p>
<p>I think one of our great achievements will be election security. Because nobody until I came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were. </p>
<p>And again, most people would stand there at 9 o’clock in the evening and say I want to thank you very much, and they go off to some other life. But I said something’s wrong here, something is really wrong, can have happened. </p>
<p>And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore. </p>
<p>Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country. </p>
<p>And I say this despite all that’s happened. The best is yet to come.</p>
<p>So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we’re going to the Capitol, and we’re going to try and give.</p>
<p>So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. </p>
<p>I want to thank you all. God bless you and God Bless America. </p>
<p>Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.</p>

<p>Under federal regulations, a special counsel can be fired only by the attorney general and for specific reasons such as misconduct, dereliction of duty or conflict of interest. An attorney general must document such reasons in writing. </p>
<p>Barr went to the White House Tuesday for a previously scheduled meeting that lasted about three hours. </p>
<div><p>Attorney General William Barr said Tuesday the Justice Department has not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. (Dec. 1)</p></div>
<p>Still, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer quipped: “I guess he’s the next one to be fired.” </p>
<a>voting irregularities </a> before the 2020 presidential election was certified, despite no evidence at that time of widespread fraud.
<p>But local Republicans in some battleground states have followed Trump in making unsupported claims, <a>prompting grave concerns </a> over potential damage to American democracy. </p>
<a>2020 election was the most secure ever</a>. He recently allowed his administration to begin the transition over to Biden, but he still refuses to admit he lost.
<p>The issues they’ve have pointed to are typical in every election: Problems with signatures, secrecy envelopes and postal marks on mail-in ballots, as well as the potential for a small number of ballots miscast or lost. </p>
<p>In the campaign statement, Giuliani claimed there was “ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined.”</p>

<div><div><h1>AP FACT CHECK: Yes, Trump lost election despite what he says</h1></div><div>By HOPE YENMay 6, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>He’s wrong on all those fronts.</p>
<p>THE FACTS: Trump’s trash talk about his former vice president is fantasy.</p>
<p>Pence had no authority under the Constitution, congressional rules, the law or custom to refer the results back to the states.</p>
<a>mob of angry Trump supporters</a> whom Trump had exhorted to “fight like hell” earlier that day after falsely claiming election fraud.
<p>“There was no role for the vice president to refer matters back to state legislatures,” said Richard Hasen, an election law professor at the University of California, Irvine. “This is not a thing.</p>
<p>“Instead, it was up to Congress to count the valid electoral college votes submitted by the states, which it did.” </p>
<p>TRUMP: The election was “corrupt” and “was indeed The Big Lie.” — statement Thursday.</p>
<p>THE FACTS: To be clear, no widespread corruption was found and no election was stolen from Trump.</p>
<p>No case has established irregularities of a scale that would have changed the outcome. </p>
<p>TRUMP: “The 2020 Election ... didn’t even have Legislative approvals from many States (which is required under the U.S. Constitution).” — statement Thursday.</p>
<p>THE FACTS: Whether the Constitution requires “legislative approvals” is questionable.</p>
<p>Trump appears to be referring to the legal argument, made in several lawsuits he backed before and after the November election, that the Constitution gives the power of election administration exclusively to state lawmakers.</p>
<p>But the Supreme Court opted not to take up any of those cases and rule on the issue.</p>
<p>Had the justices sided with Trump, it would have invalidated a number of pandemic-era accommodations like expanded mail voting that were put in place not by state legislatures, but by governors, state election officials and judges.</p>
<a>when the court in February declined</a> to take up consideration of the lawsuits, indicating they were sympathetic to the argument and saying the case could be a guide for future elections.
<p>But there’s no indication in any of the lawsuits that those changes would have altered a state’s election results. On two occasions before the election, in fact, the Supreme Court had declined to intervene in the Pennsylvania case.</p>
<a>an unprecedented effort to audit the election</a> results in Maricopa, the state’s most populous county, the audit’s findings will not affect Biden’s victory in the state or nationwide.
<p> <a>Future elections</a> may be a different matter, though, as Republican-led legislatures push changes to election laws.</p>
<p>“They can’t change the 2020 election, but they can use it as a predicate for new restrictive voting laws,” said Hasen, the election law professor.</p>

<p>He renewed his campaign promise to be a president for all Americans, whether they voted for him or not, and said the country has hard work ahead on the virus and economy. </p>
<p>But there was no concession from the White House, where Trump has continued to make unsupported allegations of fraud.</p>

<div><div><h1>Prosecutors: No charges for officer in Capitol riot shooting</h1></div><div>By ERIC TUCKER and MICHAEL BALSAMOApril 14, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal prosecutors will not charge a police officer who shot and killed a woman as she climbed through the broken part of a door during the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, the Justice Department said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said they had reviewed video of the shooting, along with statements from the officer involved and other officers and witnesses, examined physical evidence from the scene and reviewed the autopsy results.</p>
<p>“Based on that investigation, officials determined that there is insufficient evidence to support a criminal prosecution,” the department said in a statement. </p>
<p>Schamel pointed out that the officer fired only one shot and did so only after “clearly identifying himself and ordering the mob not to come through the barricade.” </p>
<p>“He used tremendous restraint in only firing one shot, and his actions stopped the mob from breaking through and turning a horrific day in American history into something so much worse,” Schamel said.</p>
<p>She fell to the ground before a police tactical team rushed into the area and gave first aid. Babbitt was later pronounced dead at a hospital. </p>
<p>Babbitt is one of five people who died as a result of the rioting, including a police officer. Three other people died of medical emergencies.</p>
<div><div><h1>Ashli Babbitt a martyr? Her past tells a more complex story</h1></div><div>By MICHAEL BIESECKERJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<div><div>This driver's license photo from the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA), provided to AP by the Calvert County Sheriff's Office, shows Ashli Babbitt. (Maryland MVA/Courtesy of the Calvert County Sheriff's Office via AP)</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The first time Celeste Norris laid eyes on Ashli Babbitt, the future insurrectionist had just rammed her vehicle three times with an SUV and was pounding on the window, challenging her to a fight.</p>
<p>Terrified and confused, Norris dialed 911 and waited for law enforcement. Babbitt was later charged with numerous misdemeanors.</p>
<a>taped a posthumous birthday</a> greeting to her in October. Trump has also demanded the Justice Department reinvestigate Babbitt’s death, though the officer who shot her was cleared of any wrongdoing by two prior federal investigations.
<p>But the life of the Air Force veteran from California, who died while wearing a Trump campaign flag wrapped around her shoulders like a cape, was far more complicated than the heroic portrait presented by Trump and his allies.</p>
<p>In the months before her death, Babbitt had become consumed by pro-Trump conspiracy theories and posted angry screeds on social media. She also had a history of making violent threats.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Images of chaos: AP photographers capture US Capitol riot</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We were trapped': Trauma of Jan. 6 lingers for lawmakers</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We have to be there': AP photographer recalls Capitol siege</h4></a></div></li>
<p>On social media, Babbitt identified as a Libertarian and ardent supporter of the Second Amendment. Her posts included <a>videos</a> of profane rants against Democrats, COVID-19 mask mandates and illegal immigration.</p>
<p>“Nothing will stop us,” Babbitt tweeted Jan. 5. “They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours....dark to light!”</p>
<p>Among Q followers, “The Storm” refers to the predicted day Trump would finally unmask the pedophile cabal, arrest and execute those deemed traitors and restore America to greatness. </p>
<p>Trump has repeatedly insisted Babbitt was murdered, and she has achieved martyr status among Trump supporters. Her name and likeness now appear on T-shirts and flags at pro-Trump rallies.</p>
<p>A Maryland personal injury lawyer representing Babbitt’s husband, Aaron Babbitt, has raised $375,000 through a Christian crowdfunding site and has threatened to file a lawsuit against the Capitol Police.</p>
<p>Key to that wrongful death claim is the contention that Babbitt, a former military police officer who was 5-foot-2 and weighed 115 pounds, would have peacefully surrendered had Capitol officers attempted to arrest her.</p>
<p>“There’s never been a person who Ashli ran across in her daily life that didn’t love her,” said Babbitt, 40.</p>
<p>That is not how Norris felt about her.</p>
<p>“He was telling me about this foulmouthed chick that’s on his shift, blah, blah, blah,” Norris recounted. “Come to find out a few months later ... they were basically having this relationship while they were at work.”</p>
<p>When she learned of the affair, she reached out to Babbitt’s husband, Timothy McEntee.</p>
<p>“You know, I was trying to keep my home life together,” she said.</p>
<p>Norris said she tried for a few months to salvage her relationship with Aaron Babbitt before finally deciding to move out of their house. Within days, Norris said, Ashli moved in.</p>
<p>When the driver of the Chevy pulled over, Norris said the white Ford SUV accelerated and rammed into her rear bumper. She said the SUV rammed her a second time and then a third, all while the vehicles continued to roll down the road.</p>
<p>After Norris dialed 911, an emergency dispatcher advised her to pull over to the shoulder and stop. As she waited for help, Babbitt got out of her vehicle and came up to Norris’ driver’s-side window, banging on the glass.</p>
<p>Norris said the force of the impact caused her seatbelt to lock tight, preventing her from getting out of her car. Within minutes, deputies arrived.</p>
<p>Court records show those charges were later updated to include traffic offenses — reckless driving, negligent driving and failure to control a vehicle’s speed to avoid a collision.</p>
<p>“I lived in fear because I didn’t know what she was capable of,” Norris told the AP. “I was constantly looking over my shoulder.”</p>
<p>In 2019, Norris filed a personal injury lawsuit against Ashli Babbitt, seeking $74,500 in damages, and she said she settled out of court with Babbitt’s insurance carrier for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>By then, Aaron and Ashli had moved to California, where she grew up and still had family. Timothy McEntee was granted a divorce in Maryland in May 2019. McEntee did not respond to voicemails and messages left at his home.</p>
<a>public testimony</a> of Capitol Police officers, 140 of whom were injured in the melee.
<p>Aaron Babbitt’s lawyer, Terrell Roberts III, did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails seeking comment. But in written statements to the media, he has said her shooting “was tantamount to an execution without trial.”</p>
<p>“Given her background as a 14-year veteran of the Air Force, it is likely that Ashli would have complied with simple verbal commands, thereby making the use of any force unnecessary,” Roberts said.</p>
<a>televised interview</a> in August that he fired as a “last resort.” When he pulled the trigger, he said, he had no idea whether the person jumping through the window was armed.
<a>cleared Byrd of wrongdoing</a> in April, concluding that he acted in self-defense and in the defense of members of Congress. The U.S. Capitol Police announced in August that they had also cleared Byrd.

<p>Two firefighters loaned to Washington for the day said they were the only medics on the Capitol steps Jan. 6, trying to triage injured officers as they watched the angry mob swell and attack police working to protect Congress.</p>

<p>Even the attackers sought medical help, and Blunt and his colleague Nathan Waterfall treated those who were passing out or had been hit. But some “feigned illness to remain behind police lines,” Blunt wrote. </p>
<p>The AP obtained the materials through 35 Freedom of Information Act requests to law enforcement agencies that responded to the Capitol insurrection.</p>
<p>Arlington’s acting police chief Andy Penn said they’d send help for the “planned and unplanned first amendment activities,” according to emails.</p>
<a>security assessment</a> warning that militia members, white supremacists and other extremists were heading to Washington to target Congress in what they saw as a “last stand” to support President Donald Trump.
<p>Federal agencies not responding were also preparing for potential violence. On Jan. 4, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said staff should try to telework for the week.</p>
<p>Two days later, it was 3:39 p.m. when Penn emailed county officials that he had “just been notified” that Arlington officers were responding to the Capitol attack and had been absorbed into the overall response led by Capitol Police. </p>
<p>That was almost 90 minutes after the mob first busted into the Capitol and more than an hour after the medics began treating injured police on the steps.</p>
<a>holding hearings </a> this week to get to the bottom of what went wrong with the law enforcement response that allowed the crowd to enter and ransack the Capitol building.
<p>One question they are looking to answer is why the Capitol Police didn’t have more help on hand early in the day, before the rally near the White House devolved into insurrection at the Capitol.</p>
<p>The emails obtained by AP — hastily written and including misspellings and incomplete sentences — show that nearby police agencies were alerted two days earlier that there might be trouble and were prepared to help.</p>
<p>They were expecting large crowds, and by the next morning they were monitoring them closely.</p>
<p>The agents were particularly interested in the right wing extremist group, Proud Boys. They noted how many were in Washington, that they were staying at a downtown hotel, and what they planned.</p>
<p>In a briefing at noon on that day, just as Trump was encouraging supporters to “ <a>fight like hell</a>,” a Federal Protective Service email said about 300 Proud Boys were at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>“No incidents at this time,” the email said. But then it warned, “The Proud Boys are threatening to shut down the water system in the downtown area, which includes government facilities.”</p>
<p>The email noted there was a man in a tree with what appeared to be a rifle near the Ellipse, and about 25,000 people were around the White House, including some who were hiding bags in bushes outside the building.</p>
<p>“Together we stand!” the officer signed off.</p>
<p>In a series of emails that followed, protective service officers messages offered a blow-by-blow account of the march to the Capitol from the rally where Trump spoke.</p>
<p>“Protesters moving towards the capitol down Pennsylvania, Constitution and Madison in numbers estimated 10-15,000,” read an email sent at 12:28 p.m.</p>
<p>The officers tracked them across the city and at 12:57 p.m. a message read, “Large group just breached the USCP barricade on the West Front,” referring to the Capitol Police barriers on west side of the Capitol Building.</p>
<p>Officers in the Virginia suburb of Vienna were already on edge two days before the Capitol breach after a video of a small, half-hour protest at the home of Republican Sen. Josh Hawley __ a Trump supporter __ attracted more than 100,000 pageviews. </p>
<p>“They claim they are coming back tonight,” Vienna Deputy Chief Daniel Janickey said in Jan. 5 emails to Fairfax County officials. </p>
<p>“WE will have some officers out there tonight monitoring in case (the) group shows up,” Janickey wrote. “Hawley and his staff have hired armed private security for (the) next 48 hours.”</p>
<p>Those protesters didn’t return. But within 24 hours, Fairfax County, Virginia, officials realized their Washington counterparts had much more trouble on their hands.</p>
<p>At 3:10 p.m. on Jan. 6, Fairfax County’s deputy county executive, Dave Rohrer, emailed more than 25 county officials: “Subject: Awareness - Police Mutual Aid Request U.S. Capitol Police.”</p>
<p>That was about two hours after the first windows had been broken.</p>
<p>The U.S. Capitol had been breached, he said.</p>
<p>Just 12 minutes later, Rohrer had an update: They were suspending any fire, rescue or emergency service transportation to hospitals in the District of Columbia and “upgrading response and command structure.”</p>
<p>The hotels “reported some problems with crowds and disorderly conduct the past few nights,” he said.</p>
<p>That evening, at 8:31 p.m., a Federal Protective Service memo alerted “there is a report of an armed militia group headed to dc from west Virginia. Query ongoing.”</p>
<p>By Jan. 7, Fairfax County Police Department Major Shawn Bennett was bristling at former Capitol Police Chief Terry Gainer’s critique of the police response.</p>
<p>“Gainer throws a lot of shame but he doesn’t offer any answers to what ‘specifically’ he would have done differently to keep the initial group from breaking down the barriers,” emailed Bennett.</p>
<p>Also on Jan. 7, Fairfax County Executive Bryan Hill was thanking his staff.</p>
