<div>Star batter Beth Mooney breaks jaw on Ashes eve as major Perry decision looms</div>
<div><div><h5>By Sarah Keoghan</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 18, 2022 — 5.40pm</time></span><span>first published at <time>11.13am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Australia’s star batter Beth Mooney will undergo surgery after suffering a fractured jaw in a training session on the eve of the women’s Ashes series.</p>
<p>Mooney, the leading run-scorer of the 2021 WBBL season, was struck in the jaw by a throw-down during a session with coach Matthew Mott on Monday evening.</p>
<p>Mooney was taken for scans which confirmed the injury. An estimated return date will be announced after surgery.</p>
<p>The injury is likely to rule out Mooney out for the Ashes series, which begins on Thursday in Adelaide, and it will also put the 28-year-old in doubt for the World Cup in New Zealand in March.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, I played a pivotal role,” Mott said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mott said it was poor timing for the injury to have occurred given the recent form of Mooney, who is ranked the world’s best T20 batter.</p>
<p>“The good news is our doctors are pretty positive,” Mott said.</p>
<p>“The way jaw surgeries are happening these days the comeback time’s a bit shorter. Hopefully she gets through that surgery well and we can find out when she can return to the group.”</p>
<p>Mott said Mooney had already voiced she is eager to come back to the squad as soon as possible, but would be following medical advice to ensure a safe return.</p>
<p>It is yet another injury blow for Australia who are already missing star duo Georgia Wareham and Sophie Molineux due to injury.</p>
<p>All-rounder Ellyse Perry will also miss Australia’s warm-up match against Australia A on Tuesday due to a COVID-19 scare but will arrive in Adelaide before the Ashes series, which begins on Thursday.</p>
<p>Given Perry’s recent patchy form in the WBBL, Mott was questioned about whether the 31-year-old still belonged in the nation’s best Twenty20 team.</p>
<p>With Mooney likely to miss the upcoming T20 series component of the Ashes, Perry now has a better chance at being named.</p>
<p>Mott said there would be some “really interesting conversations” had by selectors over the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>“People need to understand that now we have this depth in Australian women’s cricket we are able to make some more specific decisions,” Mott said.</p>
<p>“Ellyse is definitely still in the mix. She is in my opinion probably the greatest player that has ever played the game in women’s cricket. To even have these conversations is just showing how far the depth in our squad has come.”</p>
<p>Last week, selection chair Shawn Flegler also said he could not guarantee Perry a spot in the T20 component of the Ashes. Perry has played 126 T20s for her country, but has struggled with a low strike rate across her last two Big Bash seasons.</p>
<p>“We’ve made a real commitment as a selection group to make those tough decisions. We look at it as a real positive, not a negative. Certainly, Ellyse is the same,” Mott said.</p>
<p>“She is someone who has called for it in our group, for us to be really specific on our teams.”</p>

<div>Melanie Lynskey on that chilling Yellowjackets finale</div>
<p>This interview contains major spoilers from the season finale of Yellowjackets.</p>
<p>Melanie Lynskey and I are going to talk about the tragic final twist in the Yellowjackets season finale in a moment. But first, I’m still reeling from the opening minutes.</p>
<p>Shauna, with an electric carving knife, in the bathtub?</p>
<p>Case in point: the relative calm with which the adult Shauna, in the present day, dismembers her new boyfriend ... to hide the evidence of having accidentally stabbed him to death with a different, nonelectric knife.</p>
<p>“I like things with a little bit of darkness,” Lynskey said. “I like seeing how normal people can get to a desperate point.”</p>
<p>But although the parts and the budgets keep getting bigger, the roles are still the kind she loves to play: real women, wrinkles, curves and all.</p>
<p>“A lot of women out there look like me,” Lynskey said of Shauna’s come-as-you-are appearance. “That was really important to me.”</p>
<p>In an interview, she discussed her favourite fan theories, Shauna’s uncanny resolve and the one thing she told the writers her character would never do. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.</p>
<p>Q: First things first: Where does Shauna find the resolve to chop up her lover’s body in a bathtub? We even see it when she’s in the wilderness in high school, volunteering to slit the deer’s throat.</p>
<p>Q: It’s not just young Shauna who butchers animals — as an adult, she guts a rabbit in the kitchen. Are you squeamish when it comes to blood?</p>
<p>Q: How else are you like and not like Shauna?</p>
<p>Q: What about when it comes to survival skills?</p>
<p>Q: Let’s talk about Jeff (Warren Kole). Why does Shauna stay with him?</p>
<p>Q: How much did you know about Shauna’s character going into the series?</p>
<p>Q: To clarify, Jackie is for sure dead — she’s not pulling a Van?</p>
<p>A: As far as I know. I don’t see how she comes back from [freezing to death]. [Laughs.] And I think Ella’s contract was always just a year.</p>
<p>Q: A slew of fan theories about Shauna have cropped up on social media. Do you have any favourites?</p>
<p>Q: What kind of input do you have into your character?</p>
<p>Q: Have they told you anything about Season 2?</p>
<p>A: I know they haven’t even gotten into the writers’ room yet, so I want to give them a minute. But I definitely want to ask questions. I really think I probably drive them crazy.</p>

<div>‘It’s like an acid trip’: Alia Shawkat’s outrageous hipster satire bids farewell</div>
<p>Now, as Search Party begins its fifth season, Shawkat is embarking on a new challenge: saying goodbye.</p>
<p>Search Party evolved from a low-fi, if knowing, satire of youthful narcissism into an unexpectedly intricate and baroque series, free to follow its muse down some very dark corridors.</p>
<p>Speaking from Dory’s perspective, at least, Shawkat said it was OK to want to move beyond one’s close-knit gang of companions and OK to feel bonded to them, too.</p>
<p>“These people, maybe they’re not good for me, but they have to be my friends,” she said. “There’s shared trauma. They’ve killed people together. They’re in this for the long haul.”</p>
<p>On a visit to New York before the Omicron surge, Shawkat arrived for lunch at a NoHo café with a spacious wool hat to contain her curly locks and an affectionate supply of stories about the scrappy origins of Search Party.</p>
<p>Recalling the making of its pilot episode nearly seven years ago, she said: “We shot it like an indie movie, stealing shots on subways and wearing some of our own clothes. I was like, this is good but it’s never going to get made.”</p>
<p>When the first season debuted in 2016, the show drew some critical praise but not much more than a cult-size viewership; Shawkat felt it was crowded out by a glut of other post-Girls comedies that also poked fun at the habits of New York hipsters.</p>
<p>Seasons 2 and 3 of Search Party were separated by a gap of nearly three years, but the series never wavered in its efforts to blend comedy and noirish horror – a confidence its creators say stemmed from their faith in its star.</p>
<p>“We would not have taken Dory to all the places we took her if Alia wasn’t able to fill her up with so many layers and frequencies,” Rogers said.</p>
<p>Early, who plays Dory’s sharp-witted friend Elliott, said Shawkat was “majorly responsible for the emotional coherence that pulls you through the show”.</p>
<p>“Basically I show up and scream,” Early said. “Alia has to make the leaps that the show takes emotionally. She has to make them make sense on her face.”</p>
<p>Ask Shawkat what she plans to do after all of this, and she may reflexively respond, “I don’t know if I’ll ever work again, honestly.”</p>
<p>“It’s about a daughter navigating that, coming to terms with her sexuality,” she explained, “but in a funny, relatable, quirky way.”</p>
<p>Whatever follows, Shawkat has her treasured memories of her conclusion at Search Party, which felt emblematic of her time on the series.</p>
<p>The ensemble cast’s last day of principal photography took place this past summer in New York, as a looming rainstorm threatened the city.</p>
<p>Search Party (five seasons) is on Stan. Stan is owned by Nine, the owner of this masthead.</p>

<p>That’s why it was so shocking when allegations about Whedon started to appear in 2017. Accusations of appalling behaviour by his ex-wife were a shock to those who worshipped the creator of vampire-slaying drama Buffy as a feminist hero.</p>
<p>His reputation copped a further hit with the release of his original Wonder Woman script, which came across as more of an teenage boy’s wet dream than the sophisticated writing of a feminist ally. </p>
<p>Actor Ray Fisher accused him of abuse and racism on the set of Justice League, and Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot also claimed Whedon threatened her career.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Whedon broke his silence on these accusations in a bizarre, long interview for New York magazine. Reading it, it’s shocking that Whedon ever thought his comments would vindicate him or make him sound better.</p>
<p>But there is a lesson from all of this, and it’s about how to deal with criticism.</p>
<p>We’re probably all going to do regrettable things in our lives and hurt people. What defines us is how we deal with that.</p>
<p>And only one of those makes you a better person – and avoids abuse allegations on an industrial scale.</p>

<div>Eat like the French for a slimmer waistline? Skip the ‘magic’ leek soup</div>
<p>When a humble vegetable – the leek – became a plot line of an episode of the popular series Emily In Paris, viewers were shown a side of French eating culture the outside world doesn’t normally see.</p>
<p>In the Netflix show, during a meeting about how to promote leeks to US consumers, Sylvie, the Parisian chief marketing officer of Savoir, suggests luring Americans with “magic leek soup”.</p>
<p>“Leeks are a diet food for French women. We boil them and drink the water,” she says. “They’re a magic trick, a little secret.”</p>
<p>Employee Julien chimes in: “It’s a common drink that helps shed kilos.”</p>
<p>The much-envied “French paradox” refers to the idea that France’s obesity and heart disease rates have stayed relatively low, despite people eating a lot of commonly held “bad” foods high in saturated fat.</p>
<p>It’s this book, too, that introduced the rest of the world to the “magic leek soup”: the “ultimate non-diet book” begins with a 48-hour soup fast.</p>
<p>The soup is a well-known concoction that French native Valérie Nicolas, general manager of the Alliance Française de Sydney, has had before, explaining the tradition has been passed between women.</p>
<p>“It’s a nice legend,” Nicolas says. “It’s seen as a way to detox. You boil the leek and you just have the water.”</p>
<p>Normally, the soup is consumed for a maximum of two days and often before a special event, explains University of Melbourne professor of French studies Jacqueline Dutton.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There is a great fear of becoming fat in France.”</p><cite>Professor Jacqueline Dutton</cite></blockquote>
<p>“It’s been around forever,” Dutton says. “It’s the idea of having a flat stomach and starting off a new regime.”</p>
<p>“Small portions, longer meals, more diversity in the meal, care around the anticipation and planning, and conversation during and after the meal are all as important as the food itself,” she says.</p>
<p>But underpinning this is something more concerning, Dutton says. Fatness is stigmatised across the West but in France, the pressure to be thin is even more amplified.</p>
<i>grossphobie –</i> is very present in French society for both men and women.”
<p>France’s obesity rate, while rising steadily, remains low. One in six French people is obese, compared to one in three Australians.</p>
<p>Nicolas, who spent the last seven years back in her home country before returning to Australia in November, says the fear of weight gain is ingrained in women and girls especially.</p>
<i>On Ne Naît Pas Grosse</i> (“You Are Not Born Fat”), describing her experience of discrimination at work, in the health system and in everyday interactions.
<p>When the magic leek soup is proposed in Emily In Paris, Emily protests the idea and likens it to something “Gwyneth [Paltrow] would push on Goop”.</p>
<p>“That sounds so bad for you,” Emily says. “I just don’t think that we should be promoting weight-loss cures. Fad diets are really dangerous.”</p>
<p>This reaction makes sense in the context of the West’s insidious diet culture that places thinness above health. In this sense, Emily is correct, Dutton says, but she stresses that there is another context the show fails to explore.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We like to take time to go to markets, to choose our vegetables, to choose our meats, which should come from [producers] we know.”</p><cite>Valérie Nicolas</cite></blockquote>
<p>Mantzioris says while this is similar to a fasting diet, people who subscribe to the 5:2 probably still have more kilojoules on their fasting days.</p>
<p>She doesn’t recommend Australians try 48 hours of magic leek soup – pointing out it has murmurings of celery juice and the lemon detox diet – but adds “it’s what you do the majority of the time that counts”.</p>
<p>University of Sydney obesity expert Dr Nick Fuller also doesn’t advise trying the magic leek soup fast.</p>
<p>While magic leek soup might be best not to import, there are things we can learn from French food culture. Fuller says small portion sizes and valuing the social connectivity of food are two big ones.</p>
<p>Mantzioris is a fan of the respect of food preparation and quality, as well as the enjoyment. “I think that’s a really important message,” she says. “We have to eat food we enjoy, and respect the processes behind it.”</p>
<p>This resonates with Nicolas, who misses France’s abundance of markets, usually filled with organic produce.</p>
<p>“We like to take time to go to markets, to choose our vegetables, to choose our meats, which should come from [producers] we know,” Nicolas says. “There’s a very strong concern about the origin of food.”</p>
<p>She adds that the French aren’t big snackers either: “We are not eating between meals.”</p>
<p>But it’s not surprising that Emily In Paris missed all of the good parts of French eating culture. As Nicolas says of the show: “It’s funny for us because it’s a caricature.”</p>
