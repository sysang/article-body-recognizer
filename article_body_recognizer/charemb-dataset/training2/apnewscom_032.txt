<div><div><h1>As South Dakota campaigns launch, Thune mulls retirement</h1></div><div>By STEPHEN GROVESJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) — South Dakota political candidates are revving into full campaign mode this week with one big exception: Republican Sen. John Thune, who has delayed a reelection announcement as he considers retirement.</p>
<p>“One has to respect his personal decision, but it would be tragic to lose him in this role at this time,” said Tom Dempster, a former Republican state lawmaker who has remained a close political watcher.</p>
<p>“He’s stoic, he believes in virtue, he believes in reason,” Dempster said. “In the midst of this storm that the Republican Party is enduring, and America is enduring, you see in John Thune a sense of assurance.”</p>
<p>In the hours after the attack last year, Thune expressed frustration, calling the rioting “thuggery” and connecting Trump’s calls for demonstrations to the insurrection.</p>
<p>“When you sow the wind, you reap the whirlwind,” he told reporters. “You could see this coming,”</p>
<a>Thune was facing pressure</a>. A movement to oppose him in a primary — spurred by Trump’s Twitter suggestion — was gaining support and would eventually produce
<a>one candidate who was among the crowd</a> that demonstrated near the Capitol on Jan. 6.
<a>cobble together support to kill bipartisan legislation</a> that would have established an independent commission to investigate the Jan. 6 attack. Lately, he has mostly focused on scuttling the Democrats’ plans.
<p>Thune now appears well-positioned to win a fourth term. Fundraising by candidates willing to challenge him has been minuscule compared to his $14.8 million accumulated after several easy election cycles.</p>
<p>But she said that after running into Thune at a restaurant last week, she left “satisfied with what he has said to me.”</p>
<p>“In politics, it takes a long time to position yourself to be high in influence,” she said. “Anyone new coming in would not have that same influence that John currently has.”</p>
<a>a divided Republican Party</a>.
<p>“The Democrats will come up with a good candidate,” said Drey Samuelson, a South Dakota Democratic political strategist. “The political world will change if he doesn’t run.”</p>

<p>Bradley said the administration is practicing politics instead of economics and “government intervention would likely further constrain supply and push prices even higher.”</p>

<a>stalled voting legislation</a> that Democrats say is needed to protect America’s democracy.
<p>The <a>election and voting rights package </a> has been stalled in the evenly split 50-50 Senate, blocked by a Republican-led filibuster with Democrats unable to mount the 60 votes needed to advance it toward passage.</p>
<p>So far Democrats have been unable to agree among themselves over potential changes to the Senate rules to reduce the 60-vote hurdle, despite months of private negotiations.</p>

<p>How the Senate <a>filibuster </a> rules would be changed remains under discussion.</p>
<p>It seems certain that a full-scale end of the filibuster is out of reach for Democrats. Changing the rules would need all 50 votes, and Manchin and Sinema have made it clear they are unwilling to go that far. </p>
<p>Private talks with senators have been underway for weeks and continued during the holiday break. </p>
<p>Other ideas are also being considered, and some Democrats have noted that Sinema has mentioned she is open to hearing the arguments as part of a full debate.</p>
<p>Republicans are so worried Democrats will end the filibuster that McConnell has taken other actions to try to keep Manchin and Sinema close so they don’t join the rest of their party in making any drastic changes.</p>
<p>One Republican, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, argued on Monday that ending the filibuster would turn the Senate into a “Lord of the Flies”-style institution where majority rules, no matter what.</p>
<p>“It is absurd and dangerous to the institution itself,” said Lee in a statement. He said Schumer and his “disastrous plan” must be stopped.</p>
<div><div><h1>Djokovic medical exemption sparks Australian Open debate</h1></div><div>By JOHN PYEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — With his medical exemption approved, Novak Djokovic may have some explaining to do when he gets to Melbourne to defend his Australian Open title.</p>
<p>That’s a Victoria state government-mandated condition of entry for all players, staff, fans and officials entering Melbourne Park when the tournament starts on Jan. 17.</p>
<p>Australian Open tournament director Craig Tiley defended the “completely legitimate application and process” and insisted there was no special treatment for Djokovic.</p>
<p>Only 26 people connected with the tennis Grand Slam event applied for an exemption and, Tiley said, only a “handful” — estimated at about five — were granted.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Israel sets COVID-19 record amid zigzag policy and 4th jab</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>But, he suggested, it would be “helpful” if Djokovic chose to explain it to a Melbourne public still getting over months of lockdowns and severe travel restrictions imposed at the height of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I would encourage him to talk to the community about it,” Tiley said in a news conference while Djokovic was in transit. “We have been through a very tough period over the last two years.”</p>
<p>Australia only started to reopen its borders late last year when more than 80% of adults nationally had received two doses of an approved coronavirus vaccine. Restrictions were further eased when that number topped 90%.</p>
<p>Reasons allowed for anyone applying for a vaccination exemption can include an acute major medical condition, serious adverse reaction to a previous dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, or evidence of a COVID-19 infection within the previous six months.</p>
<p>Jaala Pulford, Victoria state’s acting minister for sports, said “no one is or will be receiving special treatment because of who they are or what they have achieved professionally.”</p>
<p>“Lots of people in the Victorian community will find this to be a disappointing outcome, but the process is the process,” Pulford said. “Nobody has had special treatment. The process is incredibly robust.”</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison initially said the decision was a matter for the government of Victoria, where Melbourne is the state capital.</p>
<p>Morrison later added that if Djokovic is unvaccinated, he still needed to produce satisfactory evidence upon his arrival to support the medical exemption.</p>
<p>Morrison said there’s been numerous cases in recent years where people have had to provide suitable proof to support their claims for a medical exemption, “so the circumstance is not unique.”</p>
<p>Djokovic tested positive for the coronavirus in 2020 after he played in a series of exhibition matches that he organized in Serbia and Croatia without social distancing amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>It’s not inconceivable that the 34-year-old Djokovic, who finished one win short of a calendar-year Grand Slam in 2021 when he lost the U.S. Open final to Daniil Medvedev, could have been infected again.</p>
<p>The decision on whether to elaborate now is fully in Djokovic’s court.</p>
<div><div><h1>Mired in slump, Nets set to see what Kyrie Irving can do </h1></div><div>By BRIAN MAHONEYJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — Kyrie Irving might be just the jolt the Brooklyn Nets need to escape a midseason slump.</p>
<p>After refusing to get vaccinated against the coronavirus, Irving has been unable to play at home and for much of the season was unwelcome on the road. The Nets didn’t want a part-time player, so sent him away during the preseason.</p>
<p>Things changed. The Nets decided they needed whatever they could get from Irving and are expected to put him on the court for the first time this season Wednesday at Indiana.</p>
<p>“It definitely gives us a spark,” All-Star guard James Harden said. “Obviously we’re on a three-game skid right now.”</p>
<p>But he can play in road games in the cities where there is no mandate, including all the upcoming ones during a stretch that has the Nets away for seven of their next 11 games.</p>
<p>Coach Steve Nash hasn’t said Irving will definitely debut Wednesday, but the guard is not listed on the injury report for the first time this season. </p>
<p>Even after he just recently started practicing for the first time since training camp, the Nets are confident Irving’s entrance can only be a positive.</p>
<p>“I mean, have you watched him play? He’s a master,” Kevin Durant said. “He can score 60 percent, 70 percent of his shots if you don’t guard him, and he’s a high IQ player.”</p>
<p>For sure, Irving’s talent is undeniable. He averaged a career-best 26.9 points last season, becoming the ninth player in NBA history to shoot at least 50% from the field, 40% from 3-point range and 90% from the free throw line. </p>
<p>But there’s still matters of chemistry and continuity that championship clubs crave, and the Nets will be trying to establish it with essentially two teams: one on the road with Irving, one at home without him.</p>
<p>There hasn’t been time to get as much work as hoped when he came back, as he went into health and safety protocols on Dec. 18, the day after his return was announced.</p>
<p>But on a team that’s showing flaws, whatever Irving can provide — whenever he can provide it — should solve some problems. </p>

<div><div><h1>NFL’s 2nd season of COVID just as trying as 1st, maybe more</h1></div><div>By SCHUYLER DIXONJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The NFL worked around COVID-19 with pauses and postponements during a 2020 season that figured to be the worst in dealing with the virus.</p>
<p>Now the league — and its teams, coaches and players — are just working through coronavirus concerns in 2021, even with positive tests skyrocketing compared to late in the season a year ago.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Eagles are relieved they wrapped up a postseason berth over the weekend because 12 more players landed on the COVID-19 reserve list Monday, including defensive tackle Fletcher Cox and tight end Dallas Goedert.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Israel sets COVID-19 record amid zigzag policy and 4th jab</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The league and players’ union agreed to ease return-to-play guidelines as the focus shifted from isolating infected players to encouraging vaccine booster shots as the best way to deal with the highly contagious omicron variant.</p>
<p>There were nearly 600 confirmed positive COVID-19 cases among players and league personnel from Dec. 12 to 25 compared to about 100 from almost the same timeframe in 2020, according to NFL figures. </p>
<p>But the league has only postponed three games, all in Week 15 when two games were moved to Tuesday.</p>
<p>The game was pushed back two days, and the Browns lost to Las Vegas 16-14. They were eliminated from the playoffs before losing at Pittsburgh on Monday night.</p>
<p>As the numbers escalated, the 10-day quarantine was reduced to five for players who test positive but aren’t showing symptoms. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopted similar guidelines about the same time.</p>
<p>The changes helped the unvaccinated Carson Wentz of Indianapolis avoid becoming the latest starting quarterback to miss a game. The Colts lost to the Raiders anyway, and need a Week 18 victory over two-win Jacksonville to make the playoffs.</p>
<p>Kirk Cousins, also unvaccinated, and Minnesota weren’t so lucky. He was out against Green Bay on Sunday, and the Vikings never had much of a chance in a last-gasp effort to keep their postseason hopes alive, losing 37-10.</p>
<p>“You’re just looking at the number one goal, outside of winning the division, is making it to the postseason. We have the opportunity to do that this weekend. You just want to find a way to get into the tournament.”</p>
<p>NFL players are traditionally off on Friday nights for Sunday games, and the most recent one fell on New Year’s Eve. It’s safe to say that was a topic of conversation in locker rooms.</p>
<p>Plenty of the player absences this season, particularly in December, have been late in the week, leaving a feeling of randomness as to whether teams will be missing star players. The anxiety will grow along with the stakes.</p>
<p>The rules have been changing to try to adapt.</p>
<div><div><h1>CFP championship: Matchups that will decide ’Bama-Georgia II</h1></div><div>By RALPH D. RUSSOJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The last time No. 1 Alabama and No. 3 Georgia played, things could not have gone much better for the Crimson Tide.</p>
<p>So it’s back to the drawing board for Georgia and just run it back for ’Bama, right?</p>
<p>Both teams are expecting a few new wrinkles — within reason.</p>
<p>Arkansas was one of four SEC teams that lost to both Georgia and Alabama this season.</p>
<p>Razorbacks coach Sam Pittman, along with ESPN analysts Greg McElroy and Cole Cubelic, help break down the matchups that could determine Bulldogs-Crimson Tide II.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Kansas State dominates short-handed LSU 42-20 in Texas Bowl</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Presbyterian hires Englehart to replace no-punt Kelley</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Michigan State WR Jayden Reed returning in 2022</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Long Island University hires Ron Cooper as football coach</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Alabama outside linebacker Will Anderson Jr. is the best defensive player in the country. The sophomore has 17.5 sacks among 33.5 tackles for loss. Both totals lead major college football.</p>
<p>Georgia should feel good about its offensive tackles, especially left tackle Jamaree Salyer, who was key in shutting down Michigan star pass rusher Aidan Hutchinson in the semifinals.</p>
<p>But Anderson presents a different kind of challenge.</p>
<p>“The thing I like about Alabama is all the different things they do with him,” Pittman said. </p>
<p>Defensive coordinator Pete Golding likes to use Anderson on stunts and slants to get him attacking different parts of the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>“I think he’s best when he’s on the move,” Cubelic said.</p>
<p>Anderson is a game-wrecker on an Alabama defense that’s a little underrated, and it will take a team effort by Georgia to neutralize him.</p>
<p>ATTACKING ALABAMA’S CORNERS</p>
<p>The Tide have shown some vulnerabilities in their secondary all season, and then senior cornerback Josh Jobe was lost for the playoff with a foot injury.</p>
<p>Jalyn Armour-Davis, who had been dealing with a hip problem, returned to start against Cincinnati in the Cotton Bowl but was in and out of the game.</p>
<p>Without them, freshman Kool-Aid McKinstry and Khyree Jackson are Alabama’s main cornerbacks.</p>
<p>If Georgia can hold off Anderson and the Alabama rush, it should find some holes in pass coverage, but can Bennett and the Bulldogs receivers take advantage?</p>
<p>Bennett, the former walk-on, has proved over and over that while he is no Heisman Trophy winner, he usually can get the job done.</p>
<p>Georgia’s receivers are talented, but their best weapons are tight end Brock Bowers, who had 10 catches for 139 yards in the first game against Alabama, and running back James Cook, who had four catches for 128 yards in the Orange Bowl.</p>
<p>The 230-pound Bowers often lines up in receiver spots.</p>
<p>“That guy is a problem,” McElroy said. “And there’s not really anybody that you can put on him that is going to disrupt what he can contribute to the game.”</p>
<p>It might not be a matter of whether Georgia has the players to attack Alabama’s secondary, but it’s in the Bulldogs’ DNA to play that way.</p>
<p>HOW HEALTHY IS ALABAMA’S O-LINE?</p>
<p>The story of the first Alabama-Georgia matchup was the Tide’s offensive line.</p>
<p>“Their offensive line played better in that game than they had possibly all year,” Pittman said.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs’ defense has 45 sacks this season and the SEC title game was the only one in which it was shut out.</p>
<p>Cubelic said it seemed as if Georgia didn’t have a well-thought out plan for pressuring Young the way LSU and Auburn did.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, All-America nose tackle Jordan Davis and the Georgia defensive front reverted back to regular-season form against Michigan.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest difference between the first and second meeting when Alabama has the ball is that the Tide will be without second-leading receiver John Metchie to complement All-America deep threat Jameson Williams.</p>
<p>Metchie was lost for the season against Georgia with a knee injury, but not before he had six catches for 97 yards and a touchdown. Alabama always has another receiver, but nobody else is as much as of a run-after-the-catch threat as Metchie.</p>
<p>“Now Slade Bolden can kind of be that a little bit in the slot,” McElroy said. “The young guys are great, but they’re still going to miss that presence.”</p>
<p>RUSSO’S PREDICTION: Picking against Saban and Alabama twice in the same season is never wise but: GEORGIA 28-24.</p>

<p>THIBODAUX, La. (AP) — A wintertime law enforcement fundraiser called “No Shave November” has raised about $4,000 in two months, proving so popular that a Louisiana sheriff is making it year-round. </p>
<p>More than 125 of the office’s 350 employees have been participating, and about one-third of the participants were women, Capt. Brennan Matherne, spokesman for the sheriff’s office, said Wednesday in an email. </p>

<p>“The idea of having a casual Friday every Friday with no uniforms is definitely something they are excited about,” he said. </p>
<p>Patrol deputies must wear uniforms, but Webre relaxed policies earlier this year to let them wear short-sleeved shirts — which don’t require neckties — throughout the year rather than only in the spring and summer, Matherne said.</p>
<p>Traditionally, many law enforcement agencies allowed male officers to grow mustaches but no beards.</p>
<div><div><h1>No beach weather: Florida Panhandle get snow dusting</h1></div><div>January 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>SHALIMAR, Fla. (AP) — Parts of the Florida Panhandle got a dusting of snow early Monday after temperatures dropped dramatically from the previous day when the thermometer was at typical beach weather.</p>
<p>“Well how’s this for a temperature change? “From 75 degrees at 3 in the afternoon to snow at 3 am,” the post said. “Bundle up out there!”</p>
<p>Don Shepherd, a senior forecaster for the National Weather Service in Mobile, Alabama, said in a phone interview that the dusting was “just a few little flurries.”</p>
<p><a>The last time</a> the Florida Panhandle had any significant winter weather was in January 2018 when a storm dumped snow in Tallahassee for the first time in three decades and forced the closure of schools, offices and a stretch of Interstate 10.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service in Mobile, Alabama, whose territory includes the Florida Panhandle, warned Monday that it was going to be unusually cold for the area and would feel colder than the actual temperature because of breezy conditions.</p>
<div><div><h1>Records: Wrong Wright brothers plate flew through approval</h1></div><div>By JULIE CARR SMYTHJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — The backward Wright Flyer that was at the center of an embarrassing license plate mistake in Ohio last year flew through the approval process with little to no discussion, records show.</p>
<p>Designers at the Ohio Department of Public Safety fussed over such issues as color saturation, centering and image placement. The Ohio State Highway Patrol tested the license plate’s lettering for readability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and his wife, Fran, controlled the imagery’s overall messaging — from its rural and urban themes, to its nods to Ohio’s water resources and history, to the breed of the plate’s playful pup.</p>
<p>“Y’all leave Ohio alone,” tweeted the Department of Transportation in North Carolina, where the Ohio-bred Wright brothers took their famous first flight in 1903. “They wouldn’t know. They weren’t there.”</p>
<p>The flyer is unusually shaped by modern aircraft standards, with what could be mistaken for a tail, or rudder, at the front and its big wings at the rear.</p>
<p>The mistake was fixed immediately once it was discovered. The new “Sunrise in Ohio” plate became available to the public last week. It is the state’s 76th new plate and its first since 2013. </p>
<p>Some 35,000 plates were produced before the wrong Wright Flyer was caught.</p>
<p>The plane’s orientation wasn’t discussed in any unredacted portions of the emails provided. Its only mention was in the context of a problem on an earlier plate.</p>
<p>In a Jan. 17 email, Wyatt listed the plane as the governor’s first priority.</p>
