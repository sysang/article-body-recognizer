<header> <h1> Donald Rumsfeld, former US defence secretary, dies aged 88 </h1> <p> Architect of Afghanistan and Iraq wars died at his home in New Mexico surrounded by family </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Josie Ensor, US Correspondent <time> 30 June 2021 • 8:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld, the former US defence secretary and main architect of the Iraq and Afghanistan war, died on Wednesday aged 88.</p>
<p>Mr Rumsfeld served from 2001-2006 until President George W. Bush replaced him as the US found itself bogged down after more than three years of fighting.</p>
<p>He was surrounded by family in his beloved Taos, New Mexico, the family said in a statement released on Wednesday. It is not clear how he died.</p>
<div> <blockquote><p>A statement from the family of Donald Rumsfeld: pic.twitter.com/AlKYxVvqgF</p>— Donald Rumsfeld (@RumsfeldOffice) <a>June 30, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>
<p>He had a long public career spanning several decades in Congress, the Pentagon and in the White House as chief of staff, but is most known for second term as defence secretary during the most tumultuous period of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.</p>
<p>Mr Rumsfeld oversaw the Pentagon’s response to the 9/11 terror attacks and its initial attack on al-Qaeda bases in Afghanistan, leading the charge on America’s so-called “war on terror”.</p>
<p>Two years later, US forces invaded Iraq to prevent Saddam Hussein from launching attacks with weapons of mass destruction. None were found, despite claims from Mr Rumsfeld.</p>
<p>"There are known unknowns," he said in response to a question at a Department of Defense news briefing in early 2002, about the lack of evidence, a phrase that was oft-quoted over the years.</p>
<p>The mismanaged American occupation led to a guerrilla war and sectarian violence.</p>
<p>By 2006, the wars and Mr Rumsfeld’s handling of them had become a political liability for Mr Bush. He fired Rumsfeld shortly after the midterm elections and replaced him with Robert Gates.</p>
<p>There were a series of high-profile controversies during his tenure, including the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison, as well as the detention without trial of prisoners at the military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p>Mr Rumsfeld personally authorised harsh interrogation techniques for detainees.</p>
<p>He is the only person to serve twice as Pentagon chief. The first time, in 1975-77, he was the youngest ever. The next time, in 2001-06, he was the oldest.</p>
<p>After retiring in 2008 he headed the Rumsfeld Foundation to promote public service and to work with charities that provide services and support for military families and wounded veterans.</p>
<p>Rumsfeld is survived by his wife, Joyce, three children and seven grandchildren.</p>

<div> <div> <time> 01 January 2007 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Yet Saddam remained in power, owing to a marked political reluctance to invade Iraq itself to finish off its president.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Bakr and Saddam quickly showed that they had no intention of sharing power with others. Several coup attempts were crushed in bloody fashion, and mass executions and incarcerations became part of life in Iraq.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>He also took steps to improve relations with his more immediate neighbours, most notably settling Iraq's long-standing dispute with Iran over the river boundary between them, the Shatt-al-Arab waterway.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Saddam Hussein married, in 1958, his cousin Sajida, the daughter of his uncle, Khairallah Tulfah. In addition to their two sons they had three daughters.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>When Uday was four, his father took him to watch dissidents being tortured in prison. Saddam imposed little discipline on his "cubs", allowing them to terrorise their school and teachers.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Saddam continued to have affairs, especially with blondes. Parisoula Lampsos was a mistress for three decades. He is also said to have taken as a third wife a dancer, Nedhal al-Hamdani.</p> </div> </div>

<p>Doors flying open and wheels that leant alarmingly towards each other going round corners, a Meccano-like chassis with a love for rust and engines that would struggle to pull a pram. </p>
<p>For all its door malfunctions and cornering hazards, the Herald wasn’t even particularly cheap. It went on sale for £700 in 1959, which was £100 more expensive than the rival Ford Anglia and £200 costlier than a Mini. </p>
<p>But gauge the Herald’s success by how many are still around. According to website<a> Howmanyleft.co.uk</a>, there are 2,812 still registered in the UK compared with just 2,580 Anglias.</p>
<p>Its tale is indeed what you might call a Triumph. Doomed to fail, it became nothing short of an enduring success – evidenced this week by our readers’ heartfelt letters, deterred not even by the engine going kaput.</p>

<h1> Sir Alex Ferguson's former right-hand man deployed to fix broken Manchester United dressing room </h1>
<p> Mike Phelan still has a good relationship with United's players and his role will be increasingly important to stop team's recent freefall </p>
<div> <div> By Mike McGrath <time> 5 January 2022 • 3:05pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Mike Phelan has been asked to help unify the dressing room at Manchester United and prevent the club’s torrid season from falling into further disarray.</p>
<p>United defender Luke Shaw has pointed to a lack of togetherness and motivation at the club, a malaise which began under the previous manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and which his interim replacement Ralf Rangnick is now under pressure to fix.</p>
<a>and poor use of the ball</a>.
<p>Now Rangnick has turned to Phelan, who was first-team coach under Solskjaer and Sir Alex Ferguson’s former No 2, in an attempt to build bridges in a dressing room which has divided into cliques.</p>
<p>Rangnick inherited a welter of problems from Solskjaer and recognises the need to boost morale if United are to salvage their season, even if he faces a huge task trying to do so given the poor atmosphere at the club.</p>
<a>Michael Carrick left as he wanted to spend more time with his family</a>, with Martyn Pert leaving for League One club Ipswich Town.
<p>In addition to Lense, Rangnick has brought in American coach Chris Armas, who was sacked by Toronto FC last year, and analyst Ewan Sharp.</p>
<p>However, Phelan could now play a key role in trying to get United’s season back on track. He had signed a new contract at United in October to keep him at the club until 2024, albeit on the same severance terms as before.</p>
<a>only for the former United striker to be sacked the following month</a> after an embarrassing 4-1 defeat at Watford followed humiliations at the hands of Liverpool and Manchester City.
<p>He still has a good relationship with a number of players and his role could now be <a>increasingly important in halting United’s recent freefall</a>.</p>
<p>Players’ body language was a problem identified by Rangnick during a fortuitous 1-0 win at Norwich last month and the problem deepened during a dismal 1-1 draw at Newcastle.</p>
<a>poor body language</a> was giving his opponents an advantage and saw an improvement against a Burnley team hit by Covid-19 cases. But
<a>the Wolves defeat exposed familiar problems</a> and led Shaw to question the squad’s togetherness. “I didn’t think we were all there together. To win these types of games we all need to be 100 per cent committed.”

<p>Tottenham have been much improved after the break. It is a real contest now, with both sides looking dangerous going forward.</p>
<p>Saul gets on the end of a Ziyech cross, he tries a Cruyff flick volley, not quite pulling it off. Saul has been good tonight.</p>

<p>Tottenham continue their bright start to the half. Son has the ball in space but Saul gets back to make a vital challenge. </p>

<p>There will be one minute of added time.</p>

<p>Chance for Lukaku! Ziyech puts the ball on his head and he glances it just wide! That was very close to some redemption for the striker.</p>

<p>Kane pings a lovely pass to Doherty who takes a good first touch before Ziyech dispossesses him. Important challenge, there was space in front of the left wing-back.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <p>Spurs give the ball away in their own half once again. A cross falls to Havertz who has a curling shot saved by Lloris. Nearly another costly Tottenham mistake!</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <a><time>7:53PM</time></a> <div> <h3>8 mins: Chelsea 1 Tottenham 0</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Spurs are all over the place. They cannot keep the ball and Chelsea look dangerous with every attack.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <p>Tanganga has a pass picked off by Alonso. He plays Havertz in behind who rolls it past Lloris and Sanchez can only help it into the net! Bad error from Tanganga.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>4 mins: Chelsea 0 Tottenham 0</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>It is all Chelsea in the opening minutes. They attack once more, but a free kick to the visitors gives them a welcome chance to catch their breath.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>

<p>Lukaku is involved straight away! He breaks into the Spurs box, squaring the ball but no one latches on to it. He could have shot!</p>

<h3>Hello and welcome to Telegraph Sport's live coverage of Chelsea-Spurs</h3>
<p>Tottenham manager Antonio Conte is waiting for a meeting with the club over transfer plans this month.</p>
<p>Conte intends to speak to chairman Daniel Levy and managing director of football Fabio Paratici about how his squad can be improved during the January transfer window, which opened on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Italian wanted extra time to evaluate his players and he is now ready to report back on those he wants to move forward with.</p>
<p>"My expectation is to speak with my club and then to tell them my opinions," he said ahead of his first return to Chelsea in today's Carabao Cup semi-final first leg.</p>
<p>"This is only my expectation and then the club knows after I speak to the club, they will make the decisions they want to make.</p>
<p>"I repeat I'm a manager and I'm in a position where I have to make evaluations.</p>
<p>"It's happened and now I'm waiting to speak with the club to tell my opinion that the club has to take the best decision for the present, for the future and this situation is very simple."</p>
<p>Spurs head to Stamford Bridge fearing another coronavirus outbreak, with Conte saying they had a couple of issues.</p>
<p>Steven Bergwijn and Ryan Sessegnon both miss out through injury, with the latter targeting a return in the FA Cup game with Morecambe on Sunday.</p>
<p>"Ryan Sessegnon's situation is better than Steven Bergwijn's," Conte said.</p>
<p>"I think he's almost ready to be available in the next game, in the FA Cup he'll be available.</p>
<p>"For Steve, I think we have to pay a bit more attention because his problem was in the calf, where you have to pay more attention and wait a bit before we have him available again."</p>
<p>For Chelsea, centre back Trevoh Chalobah will miss the game against Spurs after picking up a hamstring injury on Sunday, while fellow defender Andreas Christensen and forward Timo Werner are both doubts.</p>
<h1> 'I'm not sure how to take this': Moeen Ali slams Alastair Cook's England captaincy in very awkward on-air exchange </h1>
<p> The all-rounder suggested Joe Root had a stronger emotional bond with his players than Cook during Ashes analysis on BT Sport </p>
<div> <div> By Ben Bloom <time> 5 January 2022 • 2:14pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Moeen Ali accused Alastair Cook of lacking empathy as England captain during an awkward on-air television exchange before the fourth Ashes Test.</p>
<p>The pair played 37 times together during Cook's reign leading England, with the former opener also handing Moeen his Test debut in 2014.</p>
<p>In that period, Moeen scored 1,927 runs at an average of 35.03 and took 98 wickets at 42.22. In his following 27 matches under Root, he scored 987 runs at 20.56 and claimed 97 wickets at 31.04.</p>
<p>Moeen retired from Test cricket last year after an unsettled red-ball career spent under the captaincy of first Cook and then his successor Joe Root.</p>
<p>Moeen and Cook were reunited in the BT Sport studio for coverage of the fourth Ashes Test in Sydney and became embroiled in a tense exchange over how the all-rounder was handled during his international career.</p>
<p>“Cooky would never give me throw downs,” said Moeen. “Rooty has a bit more of, I would say, an emotional attachment with the players. He probably spends a bit more time with the players.”</p>
<p>Cook, who appeared to think Moeen was being light-hearted, responded: “Are you just criticising my captaincy?”</p>
<p>Moeen replied: “I am a little bit, yeah. But they are both very different. I probably did better with the bat… well, I did do better with the bat under Cooky. Whereas with the ball I was better with Rooty.”</p>
<p>Now realising the discussion had turned serious, Cook proceeded to mount a defence of his captaincy style - while also criticising Root for failing to persist with Moeen.</p>
<p>“I was going to say, I never dropped Mo," he said. "So you might criticise me, but I never dropped you. How many times did Rooty drop you?”</p>
<p>Moeen replied: “That’s true. But he also batted me from one to nine in my first year of international cricket.”</p>
<p>Cook said: “I was giving him a chance. I couldn’t work out whether he was a tailender or an opening batsman so I tried to find the perfect role for him.”</p>
<p>Moeen was employed at No 8 or 9 throughout the 2015 Ashes, before being thrust into a short-lived role as an opener just two months later for three away Tests against Pakistan.</p>
<p>A despondent Cook concluded: “I’m not sure how to take this any more. I’ve just come back from a nice holiday and walked straight into Moeen Ali off his long run.”</p>

<p>With two balls remaining in the over, the umpires oddly call on the drinks waiters. Bizarro. </p>
<h3>OVER 92 AUS 253/5 (Khawaja 61 Carey 1) </h3>
<p>Khawaja climbs into Broad's short-ball and pulls it hard through midwicket for four. Broad pitches the next one up and Khawaja nicks it into his pad, killing Broad's appeal halfway up his throat. </p>
<p>Khawaja is beaten by a jaffa that pitches on off-stump and nibbles away as his back leg comes round to leave him chest on as he faces down the pitch. </p>
<h3>OVER 91 AUS 249/5 (Khawaja 57 Carey 1) </h3>
<h3>OVER 90 AUS 248/5 (Khawaja 56 Carey 1) </h3>
<h3>OVER 89 AUS 246/5 (Khawaja 55 Carey 0) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Wood thinks he had a chance of strangling Khawaja down the legside but the left-hander got enough bat on it to tickle it wide of Buttler's dive and down to fine leg for four. No justice. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 88 AUS 242/5 (Khawaja 51 Carey 0) </h3>
<p>Broad stays over the wicket to Carey who refuses to play at the last two balls, one flies over the stumps, the other whooshes down the channel. </p>
<div> <h3>Wicket!!</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Green c Crawley b Broad 5 Nicks him off to third slip. Crawley takes a good catch low to his left. There's no way Green is a Test No6, not yet anyway. FOW 242/5</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 87: AUS 241/4 (Khawaja 50 Green 5) </h3>
<h3>OVER 86: AUS 237/4 (Khawaja 50 Green 1) </h3>
<p>Broad nibbles one back into Green who has concrete boots at the start of his innings and strikes him on the right thigh. Then he gets him playing across the line which provokes Broad's interest before getting off the mark witha thick edge.</p>
<p>Khawaja whisks two off his pads and makes his half-century. </p>

<h3>OVER 85: AUS 234/4 (Khawaja 48 Green 0) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Khawaja pulls Anderson fine for two. Wood saves the boundary. Anderson needs to keep him at that end to let Broad bowl at Green and manages to do so with two dot balls to end the over. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 84: AUS 232/4 (Khawaja 46 Green 0) </h3>
<div> <h3>Wicket!!</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Smith c Buttler b Broad 67Fantastic delivery down the corridor, just nibbled away and Smith nicks off to the keeper who managed to cling on to a straightforward catch. FOW 232/4</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Pinning Smith with a nip-backer when he hadn't played a shot but the ball was angling down, missing leg-stump. Would have been not out on umpire's call as well, let's not forget. </p> </div> </div> </div>

<h3>OVER 82: AUS 222/3 (Smith 58 Khawaja 45)</h3>
<h3>OVER 81: AUS 221/3 (Smith 58 Khawaja 44) </h3>
<p>Anderson begins with a maiden. </p>
<h3>OVER 80: AUS 221/3 (Smith 58 Khawaja 44) </h3>
<p>That's that and England take the new ball. </p>
<h3>OVER 79: AUS 216/3 (Smith 57 Khawaja 40) </h3>
<h3>The players are heading back out</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>If England can pick up wickets with the new ball, unlikely though it seems England could still have a wee chance. If these two survive an hour, we're doomed Captain Mainwaring. Doomed. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Lunch: AUS 209/3 (Smith 51 Khawaja 39) </h3>
<div> <h3>Ben Stokes Update</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Nick Hoult reports from Sydney: "Currently being treated for left side tightness. Will be assessed over the course of the next hour."</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 78: AUS 209/3 (Smith 51 Khawaja 39) </h3>
<p>Smith brings up his fifty when Malan serves up a long hop which he cuts for a single. Khawaja swats a single off a full toss and Smith ends the session with a fine leg-glance for a single. </p>
<p>Smith will have the strike on resumption in 40 minutes with two overs to go before the new ball. </p>
<div> <h3>OVER 77: AUS 206/3 (Smith 49 Khawaja 38) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Smith moves to 49 with a flick through midwicket for a single, Khawaja leans back to biff two through point. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 76: AUS 203/3 (Smith 48 Khawaja 36) </h3>
<p>Dawid Malan comes on for a couple of pre new ball overs. He starts with the flipper, or at least one that keeps straight to Smith, another leg-spinner. Set a thief to catch a thief. The right-hander uses his feet to skelp a single to mid-on. </p>
<p>Good shape from Malan until he overpitches the penultimate and final balls and both batsmen work singles down to long on. </p>
<h3>OVER 75: AUS 200/3 (Smith 46 Khawaja 35) </h3>
<h3>OVER 74: AUS 197/3 (Smith 45 Khawaja 33) </h3>
<p>Stokes had no slips, Wood has two, round the wicket to Khawaja, pitching it up and the left-hander ambles a leg-bye, trying to tickle the ball slanting across him for a single but wearing it on the outside flap of his front pad instead.</p>
<p>Smith works a single off a straight ball through midwicket. </p>
<h3>OVER 73: AUS 195/3 (Smith 44 Khawaja 33) </h3>
<h3>OVER 72: AUS 191/3 (Smith 42 Khawaja 31) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Buttler's deflection made it difficult for Root but he did get his fingers to it. </p> </div> </div> </div>

<p>Wood finishes the over, pitches it up and Smith drives a single through cover. </p>
<h3>OVER 71: AUS 189/3 (Smith 41 Khawaja 30) </h3>
<p>Root spills a catch at slip. Khawaja got it to turn and kiss the outside edge. The ball flew and hit Buttler on the thigh before popping up to first slip where Root can only parry it.</p>
<p>If it wasn't for bad luck, Leach would have none at all. How annoying. </p>
<h3>OVER 70: AUS 185/3 (Smith 39 Khawaja 28) </h3>
<h3>OVER 69: AUS 182/3 (Smith 37 Khawaja 28) </h3>
<p>Khawaja flicks a single off Leach to Bairstow at deep backward square and turns down a second when he realises it's England's gun outfielder who is swooping on the ball. </p>
<p>Smith prods a single through the onside and Leach ends the over with a flatter, skiddier one that Khawaja plays with the inside edge when hurried on to the back foot. </p>
<p>England seems as if they're just holding on for the new ball. </p>
<h3>OVER 68: AUS 180/3 (Smith 36 Khawaja 27) </h3>
<p>He control-pulls the final ball for a single and nicks the strike. All 12 Stokes' deliveries in this pell so far have been half-trackers. </p>
<h3>OVER 67: AUS 179/3 (Smith 36 Khawaja 26) </h3>
<p>Leach stays over the wicket to Khawaja. One hits a trampoline in the pitch and spits up at Khawaja who hops back to play it with the splice but relieves the pressure with a flick down to fine leg.</p>
<p>Jos Buttler is giving him more encouragement than before in the series. The keeper has been unusually quiet on this trip. He used to rabbit away. </p>
<h3>OVER 66: AUS 178/3 (Smith 36 Khawaja 25) </h3>
<p>Stokes stays round the wicket to Smith who calmly pulls the midriff-high delivery for a single. Kahwaja tucks one round the corner off his ribs and walks up the other end.</p>
<p>Stokes is a better bowler than being lumbered with this plan. At least pitch a couple up. </p>
<h3>OVER 65: AUS 175/3 (Smith 35 Khawaja 23) </h3>
<div> <div> <p>Two singles nurdled off Leach as England let the game drift away from them. Give Stokes a bowl. Whether England have ruined Leach or he isn't good enough on these pitches is moot. It just isn't working for him. </p> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 64: AUS 173/3 (Smith 34 Khawaja 22) </h3>
<h3>OVER 63: AUS 168/3 (Smith 30 Khawaja 21) </h3>
<h3>OVER 62.5: AUS 168/3 (Smith 30 Khawaja 21) </h3>
<p>Smith milks a single to cover off Leach against this absurd field with four men on the boundary when England need wickets. </p>
<p>Two balls back out there and the rain returns. The umpires look to Smith but he decides the game can go on ... for now.</p>
<p>Khawaja defends three and then carves a cut for four in the air, wide of point.</p>
<p>And then the umpires take the players off - or rather the Australian players as England stay out there.</p>

<h3>OVER 61.5: AUS 163/3 (Smith 29 Khawaja 17) </h3>
<p>Leach slides to save two at deep fine leg when Smith whips Anderson wide of leg slip and is called into action again when Smith tucks another for a single off middle. </p>
<p>Here comes the rain again. The umpires decide to stay out for now.</p>
<p>Khawaja shoulders arms to two and off the players go, Smith leading the way almost before the umpires had assented to it. </p>

<p>Leach, from round the wicket, is pitching too close to middle stump which allows Khawaja to milk singles through square leg, which he does to start the over. </p>
<p>Smith flicks a single down to midwicket against the gentle turn and Khawaja reveres sweeps for four. Dexterous hands. </p>
<p>This is a terrible field set for Leach. Singles available on the legside whenever they want them. </p>
<h3>OVER 57: AUS 152/3 (Smith 23 Khawaja 12) </h3>
<p>Anderson partly answers our prayers with a full delivery to restart the game but it's floaty and overpitched and Smith creams it through mid-on, tight to the stumps, for four. Anderson predictably ratchets back his length and Smith defends</p>
