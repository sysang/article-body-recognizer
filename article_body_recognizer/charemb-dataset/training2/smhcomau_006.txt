<p>Geelong captain Joel Selwood says he would be “proud” to see a male AFL player come out as gay, declaring there is now a “safety blanket” in place in terms of club culture.</p>
<p>As the Cats launched their specially designed jumper for Friday night’s Pride Round AFLW clash with Collingwood at GMHBA Stadium, Selwood said any openly gay male player would be welcomed.</p>
<p>“I think it would be widely accepted by all players,” he said.</p>
<p>“Even from a guy that’s been around for a long time, I’d be really proud of that person if they did.”</p>
<p>The AFL is yet to have a male openly gay or bisexual player, but the AFLW has led the way in celebrating change.</p>
<p>Geelong AFLW skipper Meg McDonald, Selwood, and club chief executive Steve Hocking raised a rainbow flag on Monday ahead of this weekend’s round.</p>
<p>Selwood said the addition of an AFLW team had changed the culture of the Cats’ men’s program.</p>
<p>McDonald said football clubs played an important role in educating communities on gender diversity.</p>
<p>“To think that such established clubs and communities are now really welcoming, not only welcoming but celebrating, everyone, I think it is really important to how the LGBTIQA+ community feels about the sport of AFL,” she said.</p>
<p>“And we want to celebrate them and we want to see them involved in the footy.”</p>
<p>McDonald is a former housemate of Carlton star Darcy Vescio, who revealed they are non-binary. Vescio made the announcement three months after Tori Groves-Little, from the Gold Coast Suns, also came out as non-binary.</p>
<p>“Darce is one of the best things about AFLW and deserves all the celebration and thanks for what is happening in AFLW,” McDonald said.</p>
<p>“It’s incredible for them to share the news and be celebrated, and for the community to see that Darce and Tory for the Gold Coast are sharing who they are.”</p>
<div>‘Immediately and correctly dispose of the ball’: AFL to crack down on holding the ball interpretation</div>
<div><div><h5>By Jon Pierik</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 18, 2022 — 8.28am</time></span><span>first published <time>January 17, 2022 — 9.48pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>AFL players have been told to expect tighter holding-the-ball and time-wasting interpretations this season, as the league seeks to avoid congestion, keep games moving and reduce the risk of injury.</p>
<p>The AFL wrote to all clubs on Monday, outlining plans on how umpires will be “less lenient towards players who have had prior opportunity and do not immediately and correctly dispose of the football”.</p>
<p>However, the AFL insists it still wants to give players the chance to release the ball when initially tackled.</p>
<p>This comes after much angst last season as to what the interpretation of holding the ball should be. Senior coaches Damien Hardwick, Brett Ratten and Chris Fagan were among those confused at various points.</p>
<p>The league has also outlined plans to crack down on time wasting. Umpires “will be less lenient towards players who deliberately delay the play. A free kick or 50-metre penalty will be awarded”.</p>
<p>The tighter interpretations come after consultation with clubs and the league’s competition committee, and were outlined by the league’s executive general manager Andrew Dillon.</p>
<p>“We are looking forward to 2022 being a year of consolidation and, as such, want to reinforce there would be no material rule changes introduced for men’s competitions this season,” Dillon said.</p>
<p>“People have different philosophies. Some people, for instance, think there should not be prior opportunity at all, which I am completely against,” Matthews said.</p>
<p>“It means if you get the ball, and get tackled ... I just think you have got to give favours to the bloke with the ball. That’s my basic philosophy.</p>
<p>“My philosophy is to protect the bloke who has got the ball in his hands, given that he has got it.”</p>
<p>The AFL has also moved to reduce head knocks and concussions by warning players they face suspensions should they choose to bump - leading to an injury - rather than tackle.</p>
<p>There were flashpoints through the 2021 campaign where decisions to bump or tackle a player while pinning an opponent’s arms split the football community.</p>
<p>The new interpretations are:</p>
<p>In 2022, umpires will be less lenient towards players who deliberately delay the play. A free kick or 50-metre penalty will be awarded under existing Law 19.2 (f).</p>
<p>In 2022, umpires will no longer give a warning to players who deliberately engage in time-wasting and a free kick will be awarded under existing Law 18.13 (d).</p>
<h3><b>Holding the Ball</b></h3>
<p>In 2022, umpires will be less lenient towards players who have had prior opportunity and do not immediately and correctly dispose of the football when they are legally tackled under existing Law 18.6.2.</p>

<div>‘Lambert would be my favourite’ says Vlastuin as Tigers mull captaincy candidates</div>
<p>Triple premiership-winning Richmond star Nick Vlastuin says the Tigers are yet to formulate how they will settle on a new captain, but he has nominated who he thinks should replace Trent Cotchin in the role.</p>
<p>The Tigers have several options to consider, with champion Dustin Martin; Tom Lynch, a former co-captain at the Gold Coast; Jack Graham; Jack Riewoldt; Jayden Short; Dylan Grimes; and Vlastuin, himself, in the mix.</p>
<p>Cotchin opted to cede the top role late last year but Vlastuin said the Tigers, having resumed pre-season training but with limited numbers because of health and safety protocols, were yet to be told how the new leader will be selected.</p>
<p>However, the tough defender said the hard-running Kane Lambert, a triple premiership teammate, is his tip to replace Cotchin.</p>
<p>“Cotch has had it for the last eight years. I am not sure how they are going to choose it, or what is going to happen, but there are plenty of options,” Vlastuin told the Richmond website.</p>
<p>“Lynchy has been really good, Kane Lambert would be my favourite, Shorty, Fridge (Jack Graham), Riewoldt, Grimesy, there are a lot of options, so it will be interesting to see what happens.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say what we want. Cotch is one sort of leader, we are probably never going to have another Cotchin, so the next captain will probably be completely different but completely perfect at the same time.”</p>
<p>Cotchin led the Tigers in a club record 188 matches but is keen to finish his career free of the added responsibility.</p>
<p>Club chief executive Brendon Gale in November gave a glowing endorsement of Martin as a leader, declaring he could “absolutely” be the next Tigers’ captain.</p>
<p>“I haven’t thought too much about it, I do like to think I’ve got some leadership qualities,” Graham said.</p>
<p>Lynch, 29, held the top role alongside Steven May for two seasons when they were at the Suns and would now be a more experienced leader. As a key forward, he is central to the Tigers’ hopes of extending their premiership era.</p>
<p>Grimes, 30, is a highly respected figure and a great role model. He claimed his maiden Jack Dyer medal last season and remains one of the league’s best defenders.</p>
<p>Riewoldt, 33, is in the twilight of his career but could do the role for a season or two, particularly if it’s felt Graham would be ready for the role come 2023.</p>
<p>Short, 25, is another in the age bracket who could take on the role for the next four or five years if it’s felt he is the best man for the job.</p>
<p>Vlastuin, a former Vic Metro captain, will turn 28 in April and is also seen as a fine potential leader with a grounded look upon life, as evidenced when he said he had spent time “on the tools” during the pre-season break.</p>

<div>De Goey case adjourned again, Pies to wait for verdict before making call</div>

<p>Collingwood will not make a call on Jordan De Goey’s future until his case is finalised after the 25-year-old’s New York court case was adjourned again until the end of the month.</p>
<p>Until that process is finalised, however, the Magpie will remain stood down as he has been since the alleged incident in New York, where De Goey was taking a break from an intensive training program, came to light on October 31.</p>
<p>Collingwood have privately conceded this week that the alleged incident was not reason enough on its own to stand a player down, but the determination was made because of De Goey’s repeated disciplinary issues.</p>
<p>Club president Jeff Browne has been briefed on De Goey’s case with the newly elected president officially meeting the players for the first time on Monday.</p>
<p>De Goey again appeared in the court via video link, represented by his lawyer Jacob Kaplan.</p>
<p>Mr Kaplan told the court he was waiting for an offer from the Assistant District Attorney in charge of the case, Brendan Mahon.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Judge Anne Swern called for a brief adjournment, and asked the parties to discuss the terms of any potential offer.</p>
<p>The possible deal would not require De Goey to return to the United States.</p>
<p>The agreement would bring to an end the proceedings which began after an alleged altercation over Halloween weekend in New York City.</p>
<p>On October 30, De Goey and a friend, Luke Dyson, were arrested at PHD Rooftop Bar at 2.44am, following an alleged confrontation with patrons that were allegedly stealing their drinks.</p>
<p>De Goey was in New York on a break from training engagements in California, as part of a contract with Monster Energy drinks.</p>
<p>According to De Goey’s charge sheet, the victim, Nicholas Barber, told police that he was struck with a bottle by Mr Dyson, and then having fallen to the ground, he was “struck with closed fists and shod feet” by both men.</p>
<p>De Goey, who was stood down from the Collingwood side following his arrest, initially said he intended to fight the charges, with an initial charge of forcible touching dropped.</p>
<p>It now appears likely that remaining assault and attempted assault charges will also be dropped for the lesser harassment charge with sources saying the defence team has footage of the incident.</p>
<p>But Judge Swern warned Mr Kaplan that the possible deal hinged on a suitable program being found for De Goey to complete.</p>
<p>“The offer will be contingent on your providing the information for the program and that program being acceptable,” she cautioned Mr Kaplan.</p>
<p>The matter was adjourned until January 28.</p>

<p>Queensland racing enthusiast Mitchell James Fenton is being accused of duping a handful of punters into placing a bet on Saturday’s Magic Millions favourite Coolangatta to win at inflated odds.</p>
<p>But after the Ciaron Maher and David Eustace-trained filly duly saluted in the $2 million Gold Coast feature, Fenton’s Twitter page ‘Horse Racing Global’ was taken down and the victims say he has not returned their calls.</p>
<p>But after the horse won, holding off Russian Conquest by a head, the @HorseRacingGL Twitter page was taken down.</p>
<p>Victims, who have asked to remain anonymous, have tried contacting their banks to cancel the transfer, but say they’re resigned to the fact they won’t be getting their money back.</p>
<p>The Queensland Racing Integrity Commission has been notified about the scam.</p>
<p>“The Queensland Racing Integrity Commission (QRIC) was recently made aware of an online scam involving an unlicenced bookmaker,” a spokesperson said.</p>
<p>“QRIC advocates for integrity in racing, and therefore encourages punters to only utilise betting agents who are licensed to operate. This information can be found at acma.gov.au.</p>
<p>“QRIC also encourages those who believe they have been scammed online to report their incident to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) via the acma.gov.au website.”</p>
<p>But the ACMA said victims should instead contact the ACCC’s Scamwatch.</p>
<p>“As a loyal follower and supporter of Horse Racing Global, we are inviting you to an invitation only membership into the Toowoomba Mafia Race Fixing Gang,” the text message, sent from Fenton, reads.</p>
<p>“As an invited prospective member the only requirement you need to fulfil to become a life member of the elitist group is to pay a once off fee off (sic) $500. This is life membership.</p>
<p>“When the race is ‘designed’ and the winner nominated all members will be immediately sent the selection.</p>
<p>The ‘Horse Racing Global’ Twitter page had over 12,000 followers before it was taken down on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mitchell J. Fenton’s LinkedIn page, which listed him as the founder and group chief executive officer of Horse Racing Global, was also taken down over the weekend.</p>
<p>The scam has also been reported to the Australian Cyber Security Centre and the ACCC’s Scamwatch.</p>

<div>Mitchell move? The key questions that need answering at your NRL club</div>
<p>The NRL’s silly season has quietened and it’s only two months until the 2022 season begins, with a host of coaches under pressure and recruits trying to justify big-money moves.</p>

<p>Will Kotoni Staggs be the yin to Adam Reynolds’ yang?</p>

<div>Players banned from pubs, clubs, movies under NRL’s new COVID measures</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>The escalating COVID-19 threat across the country has prompted the NRL to impose a series of hardline restrictions on its players, even though there’s still two months until season kick-off.</p>
<p>A handful of unvaccinated players have been barred from having any guests at home or visiting other households, while they’ve also been asked to exercise alone in public.</p>
<p>It’s the most significant step the NRL has taken since coronavirus cases surged in NSW, Victoria and Queensland last month, as the code prepares for minimal disruption to its 2022 season and the NRLW competition, due to begin in late February.</p>
<p>Restaurants and cafes are still permissible, as long as players sit at outdoor seating and are provided table service. That includes outdoor areas at pubs and clubs.</p>
<p>A partner or child of a player who doesn’t reside with them will only be allowed indoors if they can also show they’re COVID-19 free with a rapid test.</p>
<p>While the measures may seem drastic, the NRL wants to mitigate any risk when its 480 players return to pre-season training this week after the festive period and holidays interstate.</p>
<p>It’s why they told all 16 coaches they had to amend pre-season schedules for players to return to training no earlier than Thursday as they try to bed down testing procedures.</p>
<p>All players will be asked to take a RAT before entering training each day, and even members of their own household will be need to prove they’re COVID-19 free the day before players return to pre-season.</p>
<p>The dwindling number of unvaccinated players in the NRL will have even harsher restrictions imposed upon their training return, including separate bathroom and eating areas as well as segregated indoor gym use.</p>
<p>They will only be allowed to leave home for essential household tasks, and not visit another household or have visitors to their home.</p>
<p>Bulldogs player John Asiata is the only player to walk away from his contract because of his vaccination stance, later signing with English second-tier club Leigh.</p>
<p>The NRL will soon give thought to how it will deal with the inevitable mid-season outbreaks which will see players sidelined from matches while they isolate.</p>
<p>Already this summer players from the Big Bash League, NBL and A-League have been stood down for games after contracting the virus. Australian batter Travis Head will miss the fourth Ashes Test in Sydney after contracting COVID-19.</p>
<p>Raiders coach Ricky Stuart has urged Australian Rugby League Commission boss Peter V’landys to allow a club’s entire list - including development players - to be available for selection to cover COVID-19 absences in 2022.</p>
<p>The English Premier League has already been forced to postpone 18 fixtures over its busy festive period due to COVID-19 spread, but mandated clubs would be required to play if they had 13 outfield players and a goalkeeper available.</p>

<div>NRL COVID-19 chaos as clubs missing dozens of stars upon training return</div>
<p>Dozens of players and staff from Sydney’s NRL teams will be missing when all clubs officially return to pre-season training on Thursday, either isolating after contracting the virus, or being deemed a close contact of a positive case.</p>
<p>The rapid spread of the Omicron variant through Australia hasn’t spared the NRL during the festive season with sources familiar with the case numbers claiming some clubs would only have half of their top 30 players available upon their return.</p>
<p>Nearly every club has had COVID-19 positive cases or personnel on the Apollo register asked to isolate.</p>
<p>The NRL ordered all clubs to undergo a round of testing this week and told them to delay resuming pre-season until Thursday for testing procedures to be bedded down.</p>
<p>But while Australia’s summer codes including the Big Bash League, NBL and A-League have been forced to postpone matches, the NRL is confident its prevention regimes will avoid such a scenario.</p>
<p>“We will do our best to minimise disruption, but when you have 35,000 cases a day you’re not going to be immune to it,” V’landys said. “March is a long way away and hopefully things will look a lot better then.</p>
<p>“We are confident we have systems in place that will allow us to continue to play while these infections are occurring. We’ve proven that in racing at the moment.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m confident we’ll have a system in place which will enable us to play the games</p><cite>Peter V’landys</cite></blockquote>
<p>“We introduced rapid antigen tests six months ago and were one of the first ones to do it. The system has worked perfectly and even [on Wednesday] we’ve got jockeys who are positive, and they haven’t infected anyone else.</p>
<p>“We will do everything in our power for the game not to be disrupted. I’m confident we’ll have a system in place which will enable us to play the games.”</p>
<p>The Eels, Tigers, Bulldogs and Sharks will also have disruptions with positive cases among players and staff on their Apollo register.</p>
<p>The NRL managed to complete the 2020 and 2021 competition without a single COVID-19 case.</p>
<p>Every player will take a rapid test each day upon entering training in a bid to curb any outbreaks within a playing group.</p>
<p>Multiple club officials spoken to by the Herald on Wednesday said the fact the virus had swept through playing rosters might not be such a bad thing given infected persons will develop a level of immunity for several months.</p>
<p>And now the NRL will have to weigh up whether the All-Stars clash and trial matches should proceed given the disruption to pre-season conditioning.</p>
<p>Players have already been banned from attending all indoor venues in public such as pubs, clubs and cinemas and are only allowed to have 10 visitors to their household, all of whom must provide a negative rapid test beforehand and stay outdoors.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated players - of which there are fewer than 10 in the NRL - will have segregated eating and bathroom areas at training facilities, won’t be allowed any visitors to their home and must train alone in public away from club activities.</p>

<div>Mbye relishing fresh chance after joining Dragons, backs Brooks to find form at Tigers</div>
<p>A refreshed Moses Mbye has no expectation about his role at the Dragons after conceding he desperately needed a shift from Wests Tigers, who he says are close to bringing out the best in Luke Brooks.</p>
<p>The former State of Origin player is among a host of recruits for St George Illawarra coach Anthony Griffin, and is expected to be used in a utility role, which garnered him representative honours for Queensland.</p>
<p>But after asking for an early release from his big-money contract at the Tigers and then going through an on-again, off-again switch to St George Illawarra, Mbye admits even he’s unsure what role he will play for the Red V.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘You come up with an impression in your head what you think someone is going to be like, but you’re just not sure.’</p><cite>Moses Mbye on Dragons coach Anthony Griffin</cite></blockquote>
<p>“I’d played against his teams before and I had no relationship with him until he got to the Dragons. You come up with an impression in your head what you think someone is going to be like, but you’re just not sure.</p>
<p>“But he just has good expectations of what he wants out of his players, and he lets you know when you’re not living up to those expectations.”</p>
<p>The utility role isn’t new to Mbye. He started at five-eighth, fullback, centre and off the bench under Michael Maguire at the Tigers last year as the 28-year-old compensated for injuries and different strategies.</p>
<p>“I think what they’ve gone and done now is get some real experienced guys with [Tim] Sheens and [Nathan] Cayless, and I think they’ll be a real threat this year. I think they’re definitely moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>“But for me, I knew I needed a change. I didn’t have a preference where I wanted to go, but I just knew I needed a change from the Tigers. I was fortunate enough to get an opportunity at the Dragons.</p>
<div>Storm prop Tui Kamikamica a no-show at Brisbane court for assault charge</div>
<p>NRL player Tui Kamikamica did not show up to a Brisbane court on Monday for the first mention of an assault charge related to an alleged incident involving a woman outside a Brisbane hotel.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Melbourne Storm prop was issued with a notice to appear last year after the alleged incident outside an Ann Street business in Fortitude Valley on November 13.</p>
<p>Police will allege a 30-year-old woman was involved in the alleged incident, and she was not known to Mr Kamikamica.</p>
<p>The Storm player did not appear in Brisbane Arrests Court as required on Monday, but his Melbourne-based lawyer Bernie Balmer did phone in to the court to represent him.</p>
<p>Mr Balmer said his client, who was stood down by the NRL after being charged, will be pleading not guilty to the single charge of assault occasioning bodily harm.</p>
<p>“As the NRL has stood him down, there is some urgency in respect to this. I’ve spoken to a barrister in Queensland in respect to it, we would like to get a hearing as soon as we possibly can,” he said.</p>
<p>Magistrate Andrew Moloney prepared an arrest warrant for Mr Kamikamica on Monday, in light of his not being in court as required by the notice to appear.</p>
<p>However, the warrant will remain on hold until the case is next heard in court. If Mr Kamikamica does not appear in person at the next mention, the arrest warrant will be activated.</p>
<p>The case was adjourned to the Brisbane Magistrates Court on February 9.</p>

<div>Rookies set to benefit from outbreak as Broncos ready new hooker</div>
<p>The NRL’s younger players are looking to benefit from the current COVID-19 situation as the latest outbreak continues to wreak havoc across pre-season.</p>
<p>With the NRL still scheduled to start in March, teams are being forced to train with as little as half their extended squad as players continue to test positive to the virus.</p>
<p>The Brisbane Broncos have had 16 players and three members of the club’s football staff test positive, including hooker Jake Turpin.</p>
<p>Emerging hooker Cory Paix said he was eager to capitalise on the absence of first-teamers from the training field to prove he is capable of being the club’s starting No.9.</p>
<p>Paix – known to his teammates as Sonic due to his speed – switched from playing halfback in the juniors and believes his time in the No.9 spot has reinvigorated his love for the game.</p>
<p>Paix and Turpin are close friends, with the youngster eager to challenge his mate for the spot.</p>
<p>Paix said new halfback Adam Reynolds has been vital in helping the side weather the COVID-19 storm.</p>
<p>“You can see why he’s the player he is. There’s a clear mindset going into training when you know you’ve got him by your side,” he said.</p>
<p>In Townsville, about 10 Cowboys players are out of action due to COVID-19 with the squad struggling to put enough troops together to run full plays.</p>
<p>Speaking on Sunday, prop Jordan McLean said young players in the Cowboys squad were also taking full advantage of the situation.</p>
<p>The comments come after Australia Rugby League Commission boss Peter V’landys spoke about the issue on 2GB radio on Thursday, reassuring players the competition would go ahead this year.</p>
<p>“We believe we have the systems in place to avoid disruption and we’re lucky in a sense that it’s happening now and we’re learning from the experience,” V’landys said.</p>
<p>“I believe in our system and we’ve already got 30,000 antigen tests, and it will work and minimise the disruption.</p>
<p>Last week, the Penrith Panthers confirmed via a statement a significant number of their players and staff were currently self-isolating, forcing the club to push back the resumption of pre-season training.</p>
<p>Canterbury also confirmed a number of players were in isolation after testing positive while more than a dozen Dragons players and staff also have COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Eels, Tigers, Bulldogs and Sharks have also registered positive cases among their players and staff with the NRL.</p>
<p>“It won’t be a hard bubble this year, it will be what we call a soft bubble. The players will be able to go to places but they must use common sense,” V’landys said.</p>
<div>Scott’s legal team slams NRL for blocking Eels deal ahead of court date</div>
<p>Curtis Scott’s legal team has lashed out at the NRL for refusing to allow the former Canberra centre to sign a contract with Parramatta ahead of his upcoming court date.</p>
<p>Scott will attend Sutherland Local Court on Wednesday after he was arrested last week and charged over domestic violence offences alleged to have occurred in 2018.</p>
<p>Scott’s lawyer Sam Macedone claimed on Tuesday his client had been offered a career lifeline with the Eels, but that it had been blocked by the NRL.</p>
<p>Scott was originally given permission to trial for a contract with the Eels, but the league ruled out registering a contract after the latest charges.</p>
<p>Macedone said a trial date may not be available until September, which would see Scott unable to play or train the entire 2022 NRL season.</p>
<p>Scott has also been told he will not be permitted to train with the Eels. Without a contract, Scott will be forced to look for another job while the matter is resolved in court.</p>
<p>His manager, Sam Ayoub, also slammed the NRL for standing in the way of the contract.</p>
<p>Ayoub claimed the alleged victim approached the NRL in 2018 with stalking allegations against Scott in question, but said the governing body did not take action against Scott at the time.</p>
<p>The NRL said it did not act as the alleged victim did not want to make a formal complaint through the integrity unit at the time.</p>
<p>Ayoub said the NRL’s decision not to let Scott sign a contract with the Eels was frustrating given their lack of action in 2018. “We just have to let the process take its course,” Ayoub said.</p>
<p>Police will allege in court Scott assaulted a woman known to him on numerous occasions in 2018.</p>
<p>He was charged with two counts of intentionally choking a person, two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, stalk or intimidate and three counts of common assault.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bulldogs general manager Phil Gould has denied Kyle Flanagan was being shopped around to other clubs following reports Canterbury were looking to offload the 23-year-old ahead of the 2022 season.</p>
<p>Adamant the former Rooster will be remaining at Canterbury for the time being, Gould was eager to set the record straight and said a decision on the youngsters starting position would come after trials.</p>
<p>With Bulldogs recruit Matt Burton and Jake Averillo set to start as the Bulldogs halves in 2022, Flanagan will likely be pushed to reserve grade for a majority of the season. He is contracted with the Bulldogs until the end of 2023.</p>
<p>“There has been no discussions with Kyle at all. He has never been offered to other clubs,” Gould said.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the Justin Langer situation.</p>
<p>But lately? Well, lately there have been ... issues.</p>
<p>In recent times there has been a growing wariness, not to mention weariness over his deadly ... earnestness.</p>
<p>“So be patient. Stay true to yourself. And remember this: it is better for people to value you for who you are, not who you pretend to be. Who you are lasts a lifetime. Who you pretend to be changes like the change of seasons.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to be yourself, even if it means removing yourself from lives you want to be in. You are, no doubt, worthy of being valued for who you are. So be who you are.”</p>
<p>Sounds like a plan. But right now, coach, I just need to go outside for some air and ...</p>
<p>And what? You are still going?</p>
<p>“The wise man says: BE YOURSELF. YOU ARE UNIQUE and YOU ARE SPECIAL. Be happy, be healthy, be calm, be strong and BE YOURSELF.”</p>
<p>Seriously, could you believe that such a post from Langer will generate a single extra run, a single extra wicket? And if your answer is, “look it was not about them, it was about him,” I think we are getting to the nub of the problem.</p>
<p>Just as there is no “I” in “team”, there is bloody well no “insufferable self-absorption” in “coach”.</p>
<p>For compare Langer’s cited words to those of Al Pacino, playing NFL coach Tony D’Amato as he gives his dressing room speech in the film Any Given Sunday.</p>
<p>I know I do. Give it to ’em Al, as you talk to your charges three minutes before they play their make-or-break match of the season.</p>
<p>“We are in hell right now, gentlemen believe me and we can stay here and get the shit kicked out of us or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb out of hell. One inch at a time.</p>
<p>Maybe you had to see the film.</p>
<p>And yes, it is hardly the speech you’d make to cricketers. But the principle remains. To lift your charges by focusing on defending your own position? Please.</p>
<div>Inglis saves Australia’s blushes against NZ in T20 World Cup warm-up</div>
<p>David Warner’s first Australian appearance since January lasted precisely one ball, before the team’s new addition Josh Inglis conjured the winning runs against New Zealand in their T20 World Cup warm-up match in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>Smith fared better in compiling 35 (30 balls), but his dismissal began a slide that highlighted the perils of taking a questionable middle order into the global event.</p>
<p>Sent in to bat, Kane Williamson’s side looked on course for a tally of 180 plus, only to be tripped up in the closing overs on the way to just 158.</p>
<p>Inglis, who is seemingly consigned to reserve status behind Matthew Wade, then found the boundary from the only two balls he faced to allow the Australians to win by three wickets with one ball to spare.</p>
<p>Resting Glenn Maxwell, Josh Hazlewood and the just-out-of-quarantine Pat Cummins among others, Australia’s team combinations and individual displays were of as much interest as the overall outcome.</p>
<p>The Australian bowling effort was uneven, led by an outstanding spell from Adam Zampa (2-17) but without much in the way of effective support until the closing overs of the innings.</p>
<p>Martin Guptill, Daryl Mitchell, Williamson and the allrounder Jimmy Neesham all had effective stays in the middle, while Marsh’s four overs cost an unsightly 53.</p>
<p>Warner’s arrival in the middle gave him his first opportunity for a competitive hit in nearly a month, after he was swiftly discounted from the plans of Sunrisers Hyderabad in the IPL.</p>
<p>But his presumptuous charge and then finicky drive at Tim Southee resulted only in a thick edge that was pouched wondrously by Guptill, diving to his left from slip – a golden duck.</p>
<p>After a few indolent overs through the middle, they found the middle of the bat often enough to appear on their way to victory. But the “safe” singles Stoinis and Smith kept knocking around meant New Zealand were still in touch.</p>
<p>Santner duly found a way through Smith, swiftly followed by Wade sweeping straight to deep square leg second ball. When Stoinis picked out long off the next over, the Australians had lost 3-1 and still required 44 runs from 29 balls.</p>

<div>Langer expects runs to be at a premium in T20 World Cup</div>
<p>Australia coach Justin Langer has warned cricket fans to expect more low-scoring matches and tight finishes in the Twenty20 World Cup after Australia scrambled to victory against South Africa in their opening match.</p>
<p>Having bowled brilliantly, containing South Africa to just 9/118 in Abu Dhabi on Saturday night, Australia struggled to run down the seemingly inadequate total, winning by five wickets with just two balls to spare.</p>
<p>Australia’s next match is against Sri Lanka early Friday morning AEDT in Dubai, where reigning T20 World Cup holders the West Indies were bowled out for just 55 by England, who lost four wickets in the run chase.</p>
<p>“The two challenges I foresaw leading into the tournament were a lack of match practice, so it was really nice to get the points to give us something to keep building on, and also the conditions we were likely to play in,” Langer said.</p>
<p>“We saw in the IPL with the wickets they played on in the UAE, there are going to be some tight games.</p>
<p>“Often as wickets deteriorate, whether you go for the spinners or the quicks, it will mean for all the public out there, we’re going to have to get ready for some very close games.”</p>
<p>Australia made a major tactical change, dropping their leading T20 wicket-taker of the past two years, Ashton Agar, to separate the successful pairing of spin twins Agar and Adam Zampa.</p>
<p>“I can’t emphasise how tough it was on Ashton Agar. His numbers are literally outstanding. Tough on Ash and tough on Kane Richardson, who has been our best death bowler and a very good bowler in these conditions.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to have those selection headaches but it worked OK.”</p>
<p>While Australia’s bowling was top shelf, with the added bonus of Glenn Maxwell claiming the first wicket opening the bowling to finish with 1-24 from his four overs, the top order batting continues to struggle.</p>
<p>Coming off minor knee surgery, Finch failed to score, slashing to deep third man in a somewhat unlucky dismissal, while David Warner hit three boundaries before being caught from an uppish drive for 14.</p>
<p>“There were some really good signs from Davy Warner,” Langer said. “He pulled (Kagiso) Rabada for four, played a beautiful cover drive, he played a great cut shot and then one held up on his bat a bit.</p>
<p>“And he is in unbelievable physical condition. You don’t just get that, you’ve got to work very hard, so that’s a very good sign. I’m really confident he’ll come good.</p>
<p>“They’re a world-class opening partnership and I honestly believe if those two get going that’s going to set us up for real success in this tournament.”</p>

<div>‘I think he’ll walk’: Clarke expects Langer to bow out if Australia win Ashes</div>
<p>Former Test captain Michael Clarke believes Justin Langer will walk away from coaching Australia after the Ashes if the side adds a series victory over England to the Twenty20 World Cup triumph.</p>
<p>Langer’s coaching style has been under scrutiny since Australia’s defeat to India in the home Test series last summer, with the head coach’s strained relationship with the playing group the subject of numerous reports.</p>
