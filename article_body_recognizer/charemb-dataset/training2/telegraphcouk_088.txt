<h1> Mind coach Don Macpherson: 'Rugby players are treated like lepers and cast aside when most in need of support' </h1>
<p> Macpherson, who treats internationals such as George Ford, says there is too much 'virtue signalling' about mental health in the sport </p>
<div> <div> By Daniel Schofield, Deputy Rugby Union Correspondent <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<h2>'My worry is there are other Gary Speeds walking around lost'</h2>
<p>Macpherson’s job in his private consultations with players is to provide them with the mental tools to stop it ever reaching this point.</p>
<p>“I am more concerned now than ever that rugby union players will finish their rehab and worry about going home,” Macpherson said.</p>
<p>“There’s still too much virtue signalling about mental health. I want to see rugby union walk the walk because they are lagging a long way behind other sports and putting players at risk.”</p>

<header> <h1> Southampton's £100m takeover by Serbian investment group completed </h1> <p> Saints taken over by Sport Republic, which now has an 80 per cent stake, and includes former Brentford director of football Rasmus Ankersen </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Sam Wallace, Chief Football Writer <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:57pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Southampton on Tuesday night announced that a £100 million controlling stake in the club had been acquired by an investment group, led by the Serbian entrepreneur Dragan Solak.</p>
<p>Former Brentford co-director of football Ankersen meanwhile is a keynote speaker and has worked with global companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Google and AstraZeneca.</p>
<p>The pair had overseen one of the most successful transfer strategies in English football in recent years, with the likes of Neal Maupay, Ollie Watkins and Said Benrahma being sold for huge profits after arriving for small fees.</p>
<p>Sport Republic has also outlined their plans to invest in other football clubs away from Southampton, which is their first foray into club ownership.</p>
<h1> Christian Eriksen dreams of playing at 2022 World Cup despite revealing he 'died for five minutes' </h1>
<p> Midfielder has not played since collapsing during Denmark's first match of Euro 2020 last summer. He also wants a return to English football </p>
<div> <div> By Tom Morgan, Sports News Correspondent <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:06pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Christian Eriksen has described for the first time how he "died for five minutes" as he lay on the turf after suffering cardiac arrest during a match at Euro 2020 - but that his dream remains to play for Denmark at this year's World Cup.</p>
<p>He is also <a>open to a return to English football</a>, having described how "extraordinary" global messages of support helped his recovery in recent months.</p>
<p>With Italian health rules effectively banning him from playing again in Serie A, his agent Martin Schoots said: "Playing in England again would absolutely feel like coming home for Chris and his family."</p>
<p>An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) that Eriksen had fitted automatically ruled him out of a return at Inter, but English-based players and clubs are allowed to take a case-by-case approach. </p>
<p>A return to playing at any level would be a remarkable feat given Eriksen narrowly avoided death in the 42nd minute of Denmark's tournament opener against Finland last summer.</p>
<p>The team doctor later explained that Eriksen "was gone" in those frantic moments that he was resuscitated. The player released a statement soon afterwards, insisting: "I won't give up."</p>
<p>In his first full interview with Danish broadcaster DR, the former Tottenham midfielder said he was determined to chase his World Cup dream.</p>
<p>"My goal is to play in the World Cup in Qatar." Eriksen said. “I want to play. That’s been my mindset all along. It’s a goal, a dream. Whether I’ll be picked is another thing. But it’s my dream to come back.</p>
<p>“I’m sure I can come back because I don’t feel… I don’t feel any different. Physically, I’m back in top shape.</p>
<p>“That’s been my goal and it’s still some time away, so until then I’m just going to play football and prove that I’m back at the same level.”</p>
<h2>'Support from all over world has helped me through this'</h2>
<p>The former Tottenham midfielder also described how messages of support he had received had helped him recover.</p>
<p>He described the global reaction to his turmoil as "quite extraordinary, but it was very nice of everyone, and it's been a big help to me to receive all those best wishes".</p>
<p>"And people still write to me," he added. "I've thanked people I've met in person. I've thanked the doctors, my teammates and their families in person.</p>
<p>"But all the fans who've sent thousands of letters and emails and flowers, or who've come up to me on the street both in Italy and Denmark, I thank them all for the support I got from all over the world that helped me through this."</p>

<p>Sir Andrew Strauss will have a key role in deciding the futures of Chris Silverwood, Joe Root and England’s senior players when the review of the hapless Ashes tour is submitted.</p>
<p>Strauss, <a>one of only three living men to have led England to Ashes success in Australia</a>, will be tasked by the ECB to review the report of the tour by Ashley Giles, the England team director who succeeded Strauss in 2018.</p>
<p>His report will be submitted to the England Wales Cricket Board’s executive board for consideration next month before the Test series in the West Indies with Strauss providing guidance on what to do.</p>
<p>Strauss is chairman of the ECB’s cricket committee and attends board meetings in a non-voting capacity. </p>
<p>Strauss’s advice to the board will be crucial on whether they accept Giles’s recommendations on Silverwood and the structure of the England team.</p>
<p>If, for example, Giles recommends Silverwood stays on and the board disagrees then the team director’s job will be on the line as well.</p>
<p>Giles will place the performances by Silverwood and Root in the context of an exhausting schedule of 18 Test matches in 2021 and the pressures of life in restrictive bubbles. Strauss will decide whether that excuses their errors in Australia.</p>
<p>“We'll review the tour - everything will be on the table,” said Giles. “There's a lot been spoken about already and there will be a lot to come but I want the team to concentrate on these two Tests.</p>
<h2>Giles warns: ‘Things will get worse before they get better for English cricket’</h2>
<p>Just as England’s Ashes campaign limped into its final stretch, Ashley Giles painted a dispiriting picture of the state of English Test cricket and warned supporters to expect darker days to come.</p>
<p>Giles, the team director, apologised for England’s performances in Australia but partly blamed the team’s dire Ashes predicament on an intense schedule, fatigue with Covid bubbles and systemic problems in county cricket.</p>
<p>It is unlikely to please England supporters, frustrated by the team’s ineptitude and confused by a year of chopping and changing that often left Joe Root with a weakened Test team to lead.</p>
<p>With two Tests to go in the series, Giles was unable to offer much on the futures of Silverwood and Root but said there will be a “full review” with “everything on the table” when the tour ends in Hobart. </p>

<h1> Espresso shots, Kyle Walker and a £26m divorce – the inside story of Antonio Conte's split from Chelsea </h1>
<p> There will be a few awkward nods and glances when Conte makes his first return to Stamford Bridge as Tottenham head coach </p>
<div> <div> By Matt Law, Football News Correspondent <time> 4 January 2022 • 9:59am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Conte won two lawsuits against Chelsea, one for unfair dismissal and another for the wages he believed he was owed under the terms of his contract, with the full cost to the Blues made clear 18 months after his dismissal in July 2018.</p>
<p>Chelsea gave Conte the silent treatment following the Cup success during the summer in which they eventually sacked him, offering him no congratulations and leaving him in the dark over his future.</p>
<p>Some sources suspected Conte was considering an offer from Inter Milan, when he did not pick up the telephone, return messages or respond to emails as, one-by-one, he watched his main transfer targets join Chelsea’s rivals.</p>
<a>he would no longer be part of his plans by text message</a>. The Brazilian had tried to force a move to China a few months earlier and
<a>used the text to effectively go on strike</a>, leaving the Blues with little or no bargaining power over his sale to Atletico Madrid.
<p>It would not have improved the mood of the Chelsea hierarchy that Conte laughed his way through questions over Costa’s plea for the club to reduce their asking price for him, describing the striker’s words as “funny”.</p>
<p>Conte had even seen a desperate move for Fernando Llorente fail at the hands of Tottenham, a club, back on that infamous pre-season tour of Singapore and China, he had described as being one where failure could be tolerated.</p>

<header> <h1> How Wayne Rooney has put Derby County in sight of a miracle </h1> <p> This season Derby have beaten Bournemouth and West Brom and this escape act proves it is far more than just a siege mentality </p> </header>
<div> <div> By John Percy <time> 4 January 2022 • 11:07am </time> </div> </div>
<p>From Mission Impossible to the prospect of an improbable miracle, Wayne Rooney will be in the running for Manager of the Year however the season finishes for Derby County.</p>
<p>Against all the odds, Rooney has guided the stricken Championship club into a position where hopes of survival are flickering more brightly with each passing week.</p>
<p>With a 21-point deduction, a protracted takeover saga and a squad so threadbare his substitutes sometimes have milk teeth, it is one of the most uplifting stories of the season.</p>
<p>Derby’s latest result, recovering a 2-2 draw at Reading from two goals down despite the absence of their ill manager, has breathed fresh impetus into their relegation battle. </p>
<p>The teams above them in the table are twitching, in what is always a crazily unpredictable division.</p>
<p>It is now four matches unbeaten, with the gap 11 points to Monday’s opponents and safety, and suddenly League One does not appear so inevitable.</p>
<h2>Championship 2021/22 latest standings (bottom six)</h2>
<p>This season Derby have beaten Bournemouth and West Brom, drawing away at Fulham, and this escape act proves it is far more than just a siege mentality. </p>
<p>Rooney has fostered a spirit and atmosphere in the dressing room where they never give up, and his players - a combination of gnarled warriors and academy graduates - are playing above themselves to defy the doubters.</p>
<p>A football obsessive who would happily watch non-league on the television at home in the absence of any other matches, Rooney has taken all the best bits from the management manuals of Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes and Louis van Gaal.</p>
<p>Shrewd tactical tweaks, intuitive game management and fine coaching have all been evident.</p>
<p>He has revived the career of former England international Phil Jagielka, 39, who is proving an inspiration despite the uncertainty of his short-term contract running out on January 17. </p>
<p>Rooney has also got a tune out of Ravel Morrison, an old team-mate at Manchester United who has endured a nomadic career across Europe.</p>
<p>A sometimes controversial, difficult figure despite his undoubted ability, he now has 15 league appearances, the most for any club since Birmingham City in 2013.</p>
<p>There is also the backdrop of a takeover, which is still no nearer completion. Quantuma, the administrators, announced that a preferred bidder was “imminent” on Christmas Eve but interested parties are still waiting for a decision.</p>
<p>One party is fronted by former Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey, working on behalf of General Sports Worldwide, which includes former Derby chairman Andrew Appleby and former chief executive Sam Rush.</p>
<p>It is understood they tabled an increased bid of around £30 million for the club on December 23.</p>
<p>There are also persistent rumours that former Newcastle owner Mike Ashley remains interested, but is yet to make an official move.</p>
<p>Though it is believed a payment plan will be reached with HMRC over a bill spiralling towards £30m, there are other issues such as the compensation claims made by Middlesbrough and Wycombe.</p>
<p>Steve Gibson, the Middlesbrough owner, is seeking over £40m in lost revenue as he alleges <a>Derby broke financial rules in the 2018/19 season</a>.</p>
<p>Rooney has been the totemic figure representing the club during its lowest ebb, certainly since the early 1980s, and is revelling in his role.</p>
<p>Of course, it may still end in relegation. There are 21 games remaining and Derby simply could not sustain their results last season, needing a dramatic final-day draw against Sheffield Wednesday to survive.</p>
<p>He is wringing every last drop out of this squad, and it is taking a monumental effort, especially during these times of Covid-19.</p>
<p>There will be more than enough Championship clubs insisting relegation is a fitting fate for Derby, after their fights with the EFL and rule-breaking over so many years.</p>
<p>But, for now, Rooney deserves every accolade coming his way. He has proved to other former players that it’s not always worth waiting for the perfect opportunity.</p>

<p>There was no better way for Romelu Lukaku to show Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel he is the man for the big occasion. Lights blazing and camera close-up drilling into his face, Lukaku stepped up.</p>
<p>“The interview was about saying goodbye to the Inter fans,” explained the £97.5 million Belgium striker, attempting to justify his unsanctioned quotes that had landed him in such bother a few days earlier.</p>
<p>“It was not about trying to disrespect the fans, the football club, the owner, my team-mates, the manager and his technical staff.”</p>
<p>Fans? Check. Football (lest we think he might be referring to a local handball or ice hockey organisation) club? Check. Owner? Done. Team-mates? Of course. Manager? Yes. Almost there, Romelu; just one more to go.</p>
<p>Eyes dead to the world and voice as monotone as Andy Murray proposing to his fiancee, <a>Lukaku did not miss a beat</a>. A finisher of his class was never going to forget the technical staff.</p>
<p>In a 21st-century world where performative actions are as important - if not more so - than all else, the new genre of footballer hostage video steps things up to previously unseen levels of meaningless deeds.</p>
<div> <blockquote><p>A message from Romelu.</p>— Chelsea FC (@ChelseaFC) <a>January 4, 2022</a></blockquote> </div>
<p><a>Lukaku’s heinous crime had been to admit to an Italian journalist</a> that he was “not happy with the situation” at Chelsea, where he had struggled to regain his starting place after returning from injury in November.</p>
<p>There he is hugging Tuchel, while Chelsea stalwarts Cesar Azpilicueta and Petr Cech both happen to be watching and laughing. He does love the club after all.</p>
