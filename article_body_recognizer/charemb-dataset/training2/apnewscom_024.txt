<p>The urgency of the state’s nursing gap prompted a joint news conference this week by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, alongside Republican Gov. Phil Scot and state Senate President Pro Tem Becca Balint, a Democrat.</p>
<p>“Simply stated, we will not have the quality health care we need unless we have an adequate number of nurses who are well trained and well compensated,” Sanders said.</p>
<p>The nursing shortage was a problem since before COVID-19, the group said, but the pandemic has added fuel to the fire, as health care workers struggle with burnout after spending the last 20 months dealing with the virus.</p>
<div><div><h1>Activists urge Tesla to close new Xinjiang showroom</h1></div><div>January 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>BEIJING (AP) — American activists are appealing to Tesla Inc. to close a new showroom in China’s northwestern region of Xinjiang, where officials are accused of abuses against mostly Muslim ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Tesla on Friday announced the opening of its showroom in Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital, and said on its Chinese social media account, “Let’s start Xinjiang’s all-electric journey!”</p>
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations, an American organization based in Washington, D.C., on Monday urged Tesla and its chairman, Elon Musk, to close the showroom and “cease what amounts to economic support for genocide.”</p>
<p>“No American corporation should be doing business in a region that is the focal point of a campaign of genocide targeting a religious and ethnic minority,” the group’s communications director, Ibrahim Hooper, said in a statement.</p>

<p>A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Austin, Texas-based Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.</p>
<p>On Friday, the ruling party’s discipline agency threatened Walmart Inc. with a boycott after some shoppers complained online they couldn’t find goods from Xinjiang in its Walmart and Sam’s Club stores in China.</p>
<p>In December, Intel Corp., the world’s biggest maker of computer chips, apologized for asking suppliers to avoid sourcing goods from Xinjiang after the state press attacked the company and comments online called for a boycott of its goods. </p>
<p>The United States <a> has barred imports of goods from Xinjiang </a> unless they can be shown not to be made by forced labor.</p>
<p>Asked about Tesla’s situation, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said she could not comment on a particular company, but that the private sector should oppose “human rights abuses and genocide in Xinjiang.”</p>
<p>“The international community, including the public and private sectors cannot look the other way when it comes to what is taking place in Xinjiang,” Psaki said. </p>
<p>China is one of Tesla’s biggest markets. The company’s first factory outside the United States opened in Shanghai in 2019. </p>
<p>Other foreign auto brands including Volkswagen, General Motors and Nissan Motor Co. have showrooms in Xinjiang operated by the automakers’ Chinese joint-venture partners. VW also operates a factory in Urumqi.</p>
<p>Tesla also faces inquiries by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration over its Autopilot and “Full Self-Driving” systems. The company has said both are partially automated driver-assist systems despite their names. </p>

<p>David Bateman, founder and board chair of the company Entrata, claimed the COVID-19 vaccine is part of a plot by “the Jews” to exterminate people, Fox13 reported. </p>
<p>The recipients included the owner of NBA’s Utah Jazz, Ryan Smith, GOP Gov. Spencer Cox and Utah Senate Minority Whip Luz Escamilla, a Democrat.</p>

<div><div><h1>Pot, political maps, COVID aid on Hochul, lawmakers’ agenda</h1></div><div>By MARINA VILLENEUVEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — New York’s Democrat-controlled Legislature will make key decisions in 2022 on everything from the roll-out of recreational marijuana sales to how best to help New Yorkers amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Gov. Kathy Hochul has promised to announce sweeping initiatives for 2022 in her State of the State address Wednesday, including overhauls of the state’s ethics rules and the public university system.</p>
<p>The Legislature has until April to pass a budget and decide the fate of billions in projected surplus.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are also facing tough decisions on how to draw new political district maps, the fate of an expiring COVID-19 eviction moratorium and how to meet a sweeping climate change law requiring far less reliance on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>Hochul plans to deliver her address from the Assembly Chamber to distanced attendees due to the COVID-19 uptick.</p>
<p>The Democrat, who took office in August after former Gov. Andrew Cuomo stepped down amid sexual harassment allegations, has vowed to restore governmental integrity.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Idaho Power cuts coal by 2028 in plan to state regulators</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Manchin still a no, Biden's $2T bill on Dems' back burner</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Germany shuts down half of its 6 remaining nuclear plants</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Germany calls nuclear power 'dangerous,' rejects EU plan</h4></a></div></li>
<p>She’ll propose term limits and a ban on nearly all outside income for the state’s governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller.</p>
<p>Hochul has said she’ll also offer plans to boost offshore wind and electric vehicle infrastructure, expand mail-in-voting and support health care workers.</p>
<p>Hochul, of Buffalo, is negotiating with the Buffalo Bills <a>on a plan for taxpayers to help fund a stadium that could cost $1.35 billion.</a> It’s unclear whether she’ll reveal more details Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lawmakers must soon approve maps that will divide New York into new legislative and congressional districts for the next decade.</p>
<p>In 2014, voters frustrated with partisan gerrymandering tasked an independent commission with drawing up maps.</p>
<p>But on Monday, the commission failed to release a single compromise map.</p>
<p>Democratic and Republican commissioners have released two competing maps and blamed the other for failing to compromise.</p>
<p>Stakes are high in dwindling, conservative-friendly upstate communities: new Census data shows New York will lose its 27th congressional seat.</p>
<p>The Legislature has 10 days to approve or reject the maps with two-thirds votes in each chamber. If those maps fail, the commission could submit maps again.</p>
<p>And if those maps fail, the Legislature could pass maps of their own. Democrats with legislative supermajorities could potentially give themselves more districts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lawmakers face another hurdle: voters in 2014 also banned partisan gerrymandering.</p>
<p>Last March, New York allowed adults over the age of 21 to possess up to three ounces of cannabis and smoke marijuana in tobacco-friendly spots.</p>
<p>But more than nine months later, marijuana shops still can’t open.</p>
<p>Cuomo long failed to release nominees to set up New York’s recreational marijuana industry. Hochul did so in September.</p>
<p>The state cannabis board’s now drawing up new rules for CBD products, including tinctures and oils.</p>
<p>And New York expects to release regulations for recreational marijuana sales “in the first quarter of this year,” state Office of Cannabis Management spokesperson Freeman Klopott told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>State cannabis board chair Tremaine Wright has said businesses could apply for adult-use licenses as early as this fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pot activists want New York to launch the industry swiftly and ensure mega-corporations won’t crowd out small dispensaries.</p>
<p>And critics, including some Republicans, want New York to delay pot sales to give municipalities more time to review regulations.</p>
<p>About 40% of roughly 1,500 municipalities in New York opted out of legal pot sales by a Dec. 31 deadline. Those municipalities can later decide to opt-in.</p>
<p>New York has until 2030 for 70% of its electricity to come from renewable energy, under a sweeping 2019 state law aimed at reducing fossil fuel emissions.</p>
<p>The state has until 2040 to become emissions free.</p>
<p>New York’s Climate Action Council released a blueprint to reach the lofty targets in December, and the public has through April to submit comments. </p>
<p>The blueprint suggests New York could charge polluters for how many emissions they produce.</p>
<p>Lobbyists for the fossil fuel industry have long argued such proposals would raise consumer bills.</p>
<p>But environmentalists say New York must act now amid rising sea levels threatening infrastructure, decreasing air quality and severe flooding from storms.</p>
<p>The state has a long way to go: renewable energy made up 27% of New York’s electricity generation in 2020. Nuclear represented 29%, while the remainder largely came from oil and gas.</p>
<p>Hochul is facing calls for more COVID-19 relief as New York’s moratorium on residential evictions and foreclosure nears a Jan. 15 expiration date.</p>
<p>Housing advocates are warning that will fuel a flood in evictions, though landlords say court bottlenecks will prevent a surge.</p>
<p>The <a>state’s still struggling to get relief out</a>: New York has spent about half of $2.4 billion in federal rent relief funds meant to help low-and-moderate income tenants.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, advocates for undocumented workers are calling for $3 billion more for the state’s Excluded Workers Fund, which quickly ran out of $2 billion in state funds. </p>
<p>A group of lawmakers, including Sen. Anna Kaplan, want New York to set aside $2.5 billion to help New York repay $9 billion it borrowed from the federal government to pay unemployment claims amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>Democrats have proposed bills ranging from universal child care, to a future mandate on childhood COVID-19 vaccination, to legislation preventing landlords from denying a lease renewal under most scenarios.</p>
<p>Criminal justice reform advocates want Democrats to pass legislation <a>to automatically clear the records of many criminal convictions </a> at least three years from sentencing for a misdemeanor, or seven years for a felony.</p>
<p>Minority Republicans, particularly those who have run on being tough-on-crime in swing districts, vow to fight liberal bills that would increase mandates on business owners or weaken crime laws.</p>

<div><div><h1>PGE blamed for massive Northern California wildfire</h1></div><div>January 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — Pacific Gas Electric power lines sparked last summer’s Dixie Fire in Northern California that swept through five counties and burned more than 1,300 homes and other buildings, state fire officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The blaze was caused by a tree hitting electrical distribution lines west of a dam in the Sierra Nevada, where the blaze began on July 13, according to investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.</p>
<p>Cal Fire said its investigative report was sent to the Butte County district attorney’s office, which will determine whether criminal charges should be filed.</p>
<p>The finding was no surprise. PGE already had indicated its equipment may have been involved in the Dixie Fire, which burned nearly 1 million acres (3,900 square kilometers) in Butte, Plumas, Lassen, Shasta, and Tehama counties.</p>
<p>It was the second-largest fire in state history.</p>

<li><div><a><h4>Harris: 'Omicron spreading like wildfire' in Alabama</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Crews box in Colorado wildfire as investigators seek cause</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The company said it has committed to burying 10,000 miles (16,100 kilometers) of power lines and taking other measures to help prevent wildfires.</p>
<p>Those have included shutting off power to thousands — and in one case, millions — of customers during periods of hot, dry weather coupled with high winds that can knock down trees or hurl branches into power lines. </p>
<p>A historic drought and recent heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires fiercer and harder to fight in the American West. </p>
<p>PGE equipment has been blamed for several of California’s largest and deadliest wildfires in recent years.</p>
<p>Shasta and Tehama counties have sued the utility alleging negligence, saying PGE had failed to remove the tree even though it had been marked for removal two years earlier. The utility said the tree was subsequently cleared to stay.</p>
<p>It was one in a slew of legal actions against the nation’s largest utility, which has an estimated 16 million customers in central and Northern California. </p>
<p>The utility pleaded guilty in 2019 to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter for a 2018 blaze ignited by its long-neglected electrical grid that nearly destroyed the town of Paradise and became the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century.</p>
<p>PGE also filed for bankruptcy protection in 2019 after that blaze and others were blamed on its aging equipment. The utility emerged from bankruptcy in 2020 and negotiated a $13.5 billion settlement with some wildfire victims. </p>
<p>Last fall, PGE reached a $125 million settlement agreement with the California Public Utilities Commission over that fire.</p>

<div><div><h1>How to attract busy contractors to your home remodel</h1></div><div>By ANNIE MILLERBERND of NerdWalletJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Brian Gawthrop has waited over six months to remodel his home.</p>
<p>The Washington state-based certified financial planner and his wife have a long enough wish list to keep a contractor busy: a kitchen remodel, new flooring, a new deck and many other upgrades.</p>
<p>Here’s how to stand out in a crowd of homeowners vying for a contractor’s attention.</p>
<p>A contractor may be more likely to call you back if an existing customer refers you. You can try a friend, family member or neighbor who’s had work done recently.</p>
<p>Mike Williams, owner of Maryland Professional Contractors, says when he has dozens of voicemails, referrals get the first calls back.</p>
<p>Williams says he enjoys working with new customers, but the referral network supports his business.</p>
<p>“That base supports about seven full-time employees right now,” he says. “I know that was there before this boom, so I’m pretty sure after the boom we’ll have that referral base.”</p>
<p>You might also use your real estate agent. Williams says about half of his referrals come from agents.</p>
<p>BE PATIENT — AND NICE</p>
<p>Christina Starmer, building contractor at CenterBeam Construction in Jacksonville, Florida, says she returns every customer’s call, but acknowledges that not all contractors do.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really important to be extremely kind to the customers and call them back, but the customers right now are just extremely frustrated because they can’t get anyone to pick up the phone,” she says.</p>
<p>Frustrating as it is, don’t let anger get the best of you. Starmer says renovations are hard work, and a little empathy goes a long way.</p>
<p>If someone is unkind early on, Starmer assumes they’ll be unkind to her staff as well, and usually moves on to a new client.</p>
<p>Research finishes, like cabinets and countertops, before calling a contractor because they can make a big difference in the project’s cost, says Jonathan Larkin , sales manager of St. Paul, Minnesota-based JoNick Construction.</p>
<p>“It’s much easier to write up a bid if somebody has some solid ideas of what they really want,” he says.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the details ironed out, Larkin recommends setting a budget ahead of time.</p>
<p>Giving a number may feel like relinquishing leverage, but he says a reputable contractor will use your budget to help you assess options, not overcharge you.</p>
<p>Larkin recommends getting an itemized estimate in case you need to find opportunities to cut costs.</p>
<p>Gawthrop says his wife wants to start their renovations sooner than later, but he wants to stay budget-conscious. In this market, he says price seems largely at the discretion of contractors.</p>
<p>“It kind of feels like the wild west,” he says.</p>
<p>But you can maintain control of your finances. </p>
<p>Weigh each type of financing to find one that works best for you.</p>

<p>A party spokesperson said Labour leader Keir Starmer would miss the session after testing positive for the virus. </p>
<p>Confirmed new daily infections across the U.K. jumped to a record 218,274 on Tuesday, 15% more than the previous high set Dec. 31. However, inconsistent reporting during the holiday period may have inflated the daily figures. </p>

<p>Gillian Keegan, a junior minister at the U.K. Ministry of Health, acknowledged the strain in an interview with BBC Breakfast.</p>
<p>“Right now, they are under extreme pressure with the omicron variant, with the number of positive cases and the increase in hospitalizations, and at this point in (winter) time when they always have extreme pressure,” Keegan said.</p>
<p>The move would effectively shorten the time people without symptoms have to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Keegan did not confirm the report but told the BBC, “What we are doing all the time is looking at what makes sense. We don’t need to do things that are unnecessary.”</p>
<p>NHS Confederation chief executive Matthew Taylor told the BBC he would support the move if scientists deem it safe. </p>
<p>“It is still taking us too long to get an ambulance to patients. Unfortunately, due to this, patients remain at risk, which is unacceptable,” North East Ambulance Service medical director Mathew Beattie said Wednesday. </p>

<div><div><h1>New auto sales up in 2021, but long way before full recovery</h1></div><div>By TOM KRISHERJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>DETROIT (AP) — U.S. new vehicle sales rebounded slightly last year from 2020′s dismal numbers, but were still about 2 million below the years before the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Sales hit just over 15 million vehicles in 2021, up 3.4% from 2020, the year the pandemic took hold in the U.S. </p>
<p>“Demand is not off at all,” said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst for Cox Automotive. “What is off is sales, because the inventory doesn’t exist.”</p>
<p>Cox expects 2021 sales to be 14.9 million vehicles, up 2.5% from 2020, the year the pandemic hit the U.S. and forced the industry to shut down for eight weeks. But over the five years before the pandemic, sales averaged 17.3 million. </p>
<p>Among the hardest hit by the chip shortage was General Motors, which was unseated by Toyota last year as the nation’s top-selling automaker for the first time. </p>
<p>GM on Tuesday reported that last year’s U.S. sales fell 13% from 2020 levels to just over 2.2 million. Toyota, on the other hand, saw its sales rise 10.4% to just over 2.3 million.</p>
<p>The company, Cain said, expects the chip shortage to ease this year, with more available in the second half. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>Israel sets COVID-19 record amid zigzag policy and 4th jab</h4></a></div></li>
<p>IHS Markit analyst Phil Amsrud, who follows automotive chips, said supplies won’t improve immediately.</p>
<p>“We’re seeing 2022 as being an improvement over 2021, but it’s not going to start January third or fourth,” he said, adding that the second half should be better than the first.</p>
<p>There are signs that the number of vehicles on dealer lots is growing, though. It rose to more than 1 million last month for the first time since August, Krebs said. But that’s still 1.5 million below 2020 and 2.5 million fewer than in 2019.</p>
<p>Cox is predicting that U.S. new vehicle sales sales will increase by more than 1 million this year, to around 16 million.</p>
<p>Amsrud attributed the vehicle inventory growth more to automakers managing the chip shortage better, rather than any dramatic growth in chip supplies. Like GM, many have allocated chips to build more expensive models.</p>
<p>David Kelleher, owner of a Stellantis dealership in Glen Mills, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, said he doesn’t see much change in auto sales and prices this year or next, but he’s happy with that. </p>
<p>He’s making record profits, selling just about every vehicle he gets at sticker price, while customers are happy to find vehicles. They’re also getting high prices for trade-ins because used car prices have skyrocketed. </p>
<p>Owners have an average of $10,199 worth of equity in their trades, 83% higher than a year ago, J.D. Power said. </p>
<p>“The customer right now just wants the (good) experience and the car,” Kelleher said. “If you have the car and you get them the car, they’re going to be happy with you.” </p>
<p>In normal times, Kelleher would have 750 vehicles for sale on his lot. Now he’s got 12. But he isn’t paying interest on the inventory and has been able to cut advertising 30%. </p>
<p>Because of strong demand and low supplies, J.D. Power says the average new vehicle price rose to $45,743 in December, 20% higher than a year ago and the first time it finished above $45,000.</p>
<p>Sales of fully electric vehicles rose 87.9% for the year to nearly 489,000, but they still accounted for only 3.2% of the market.</p>

<div><div><h1>Missouri abortion opponents seek more restrictions in 2022</h1></div><div>December 3, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Missouri legislators who oppose legal abortion are preparing an aggressive list of bills for the 2022 General Assembly that convenes in January.</p>
<p>Proposals include requiring women to undergo an ultrasound before an abortion and raising criminal penalties for illegal abortions, The Kansas City Star reports.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court’s conservative majority on Wednesday signaled they would allow states to ban abortion much earlier in pregnancy and may even overturn the nationwide right that has existed for nearly 50 years.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court’s anticipated ruling on a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, expected in June, has raised hopes among Missouri abortion rights opponents. </p>
<p>Abortion is available at just one location in Missouri, a Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis, and only a few dozen were reported in 2020. Patients often travel to Kansas or Illinois instead.</p>
<p>At least 10 abortion-related measures had already been filed as of Thursday afternoon. </p>
<div><div><h1>US appeals court to rehear Tennessee abortion ban argument</h1></div><div>By KIMBERLEE KRUESI and TRAVIS LOLLERDecember 3, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Just hours after the U.S. Supreme Court concluded historic arguments over abortion, a federal appeals court signaled it might be willing to allow yet another restrictive ban to go into effect. </p>
<p>While the state law will remain on pause because of a lower court ruling, the move marked yet another rapid turn in the ongoing battle over abortion access currently being fought inside the country’s judicial system. </p>
<p>Reproductive rights groups representing clinics in Tennessee quickly sued the state and U.S. District Judge William L. Campbell blocked the law almost immediately after Lee gave the bill his signature.</p>
<p>While the 6th Circuit eventually ruled that the so-called reasons ban could go into effect in late 2020, the federal panel later reversed course and blocked that provision in September. </p>
<p>At the time, Judge Amul R. Thaper dissented, but also broadly addressed abortion by writing that “the courts should return this choice to the American people — where it belongs.”</p>
<p>The 6th Circuit has yet to schedule a rehearing. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Supreme Court could uphold the Mississippi law without overturning Roe, said Suzanna Sherry, a professor of law at Vanderbilt University.</p>
<p>“I cannot imagine any court holding that a ban at six weeks is not an undue burden,” she said.</p>

<p>The union initially won emergency relief to stop the closure, but the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals then put it back on last month.</p>

<div><div><h1>Justices signal they’ll OK new abortion limits, may toss Roe</h1></div><div>By MARK SHERMAN and JESSICA GRESKODecember 2, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<a>a Mississippi law</a> that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
<p>At the very least, such a decision would undermine Roe and Casey, which allow states to regulate but not ban abortion up until the point of fetal viability, at roughly 24 weeks.</p>
<p>And there was also substantial support among the conservative justices for getting rid of Roe and Casey altogether. Justice Clarence Thomas is the <a> only member of the court who has openly called for overruling the two cases</a>.</p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, asked whether the court would be better off withdrawing completely from the abortion issue and letting states decide.</p>
<p>People of color and lesser means would be disproportionately affected, supporters of abortion rights say.</p>
<p>The court’s three liberal justices said that reversing Roe and Casey would significantly damage the court’s own legitimacy.</p>
<p>“Will this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?” Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked.</p>
<p>In unusually strong terms for a high-court argument, Justice Stephen Breyer warned his colleagues they “better be damn sure” before they throw away the established abortion decisions.</p>
<p>Public opinion polls show support for preserving Roe, though some surveys also find backing for greater restrictions on abortion.</p>
<p>Among the conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts appeared most interested in a less sweeping ruling that would uphold the Mississippi law but not explicitly overrule Roe and Casey.</p>
<p>“That may be what they’re asking for, but the thing at issue before us today is 15 weeks,” Roberts said, alluding to Mississippi’s call to overturn the broader cases in addition to upholding its own law.</p>
<p>More than 90% of abortions are performed in the first 13 weeks of pregnancy, well before viability, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>About 100 patients per year get abortions after 15 weeks at the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Mississippi’s lone abortion clinic. The facility does not provide abortions after 16 weeks.</p>
<p>Even upholding the 15-week ban would mean rejecting the decades-old viability line. Abortion rights supporters say that would effectively overturn Roe and leave no principled line for when abortions might be banned. </p>
<p>Justice Neil Gorsuch, another Trump appointee, suggested the lack of a rigorous alternative might be a reason to overrule Roe and Casey entirely.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any line that could be more principled than viability,” Prelogar said.</p>
<p>Perhaps in recognition of the gravity of the issue before them, the justices took the bench at 10 o’clock without any smiles or the private jokes they sometimes share.</p>
<p>The case came to a court with a 6-3 conservative majority that has been transformed by the justices named by Trump —Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.</p>
<p>The court has yet to rule on the Texas law, and the justices have refused to put it on hold while the matter is under legal review.</p>
<p>The Mississippi case poses questions more central to the abortion right. State Solicitor General Scott Stewart said Roe and Casey “haunt our country” and “have no basis in the Constitution.”</p>
<p>He compared those decisions to Plessy v. Ferguson, the infamous Supreme Court ruling from 1896 that justified official segregation before it was overruled by Brown v. Board of Education 58 years later.</p>
<p>The Mississippi clinic argued that those two cases were correctly decided and have been relied on by women and their partners for nearly a half century, a point also made by Justice Elena Kagan.</p>
<p>The abortion decisions are “part of the fabric of women’s existence in this country,” she said.</p>
<p>“Why don’t the safe haven laws take care of that problem?” she asked.</p>
<p>Barrett, with a long record of personal opposition to abortion, acknowledged the court still has to deal with the issue of forcing women to remain pregnant against their will.</p>
<p>She described such a pregnancy as “an infringement on bodily autonomy, you know, which we have in other contexts, like vaccines.”</p>
<p>In its earlier rulings, the court has rooted the right to abortion in the section of the 14th Amendment that says states cannot “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”</p>
<p>Same-sex marriage and other rights, based on the same provision but also not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, could be threatened if Roe and Casey fall, the administration argues.</p>
<p>If the court issues its decision in late June it will be a little more than four months before next year’s congressional elections, and could become a campaign season rallying cry.</p>

<p>Both sides seem to be operating on the assumption that a court reshaped by former President Donald Trump will either overturn or seriously weaken Roe. </p>
<a>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</a>, concerns a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Roe v. Wade, which was reaffirmed in a subsequent 1992 ruling in

<p>“The battle has been happening in the statehouses for decades and it’s going to intensify,” Nash said. </p>

<p>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The Justice Department sued Texas on Monday over its new redistricting maps, saying the plans discriminate against minority voters, particularly Latinos, who have fueled the state’s population boom.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, condemned the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Monday’s lawsuit, filed in the Western District of Texas, cites several congressional districts in which Republicans drew tortured lines to lower the share of Black and Latino voters in their party’s congressional districts. </p>
<p>Although the federal lawsuit alleges Black voters are also treated improperly by the map, the bulk of the case centers around the map’s treatment of Latinos. </p>
<p>“That does complicate the narrative,” said Josh Blackman, a law professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston, noting that the Voting Rights Act claim depends on the group voting as a bloc.</p>
<p>“Texas drew a really aggressive map this decade,” Li said. “One of the most aggressive maps we have seen so far this cycle and one that heavily targets communities of color.”</p>

<p>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear the appeal of a Connecticut man convicted in the killings of a woman and her two daughters in a 2007 home invasion.</p>
<p>The court decided not to take up the case of Joshua Komisarjevsky on Monday. It did not provide an explanation, as is its custom for cases it declines to hear.</p>
<p>Komisarjevsky asked the court to hear his appeal of a Connecticut Supreme Court ruling in April that upheld his convictions for murder, sexual assault and other crimes.</p>
<p>His lawyers made several arguments, including that he was denied a fair trial because the state refused to move his trial out of New Haven to counter pre-trial publicity.</p>
<p>The two paroled burglars broke into the family’s suburban home in the middle of the night and terrorized them for hours, eventually strangling Hawke-Petit and setting the house ablaze with the girls tied to their beds, police said.</p>
<p>The crimes and their viciousness drew worldwide attention, drawing comparisons to the 1959 killings portrayed in Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood” and becoming the subjects of TV shows, documentaries and books.</p>
<div><div><h1>Biden’s Supreme Court commission releases final report </h1></div><div>By COLLEEN LONGDecember 8, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The commission tasked by President Joe Biden with studying potential changes to the Supreme Court has released its final draft report, a cautious take on proposals for expanding the court and setting possible term limits. </p>
<p>That led to calls by some progressives for changes, including adding seats to the court or setting term limits. Congress originally set the number of justices at six. The number has been nine since 1869.</p>
<p>But there’s a growing urgency from some Democratic groups to make substantial changes. </p>
<p>She criticized the lack of recommendations. “The American people deserve better than this long-awaited yet deeply unhelpful pros and cons list.”</p>
<p>Fix the Court, another group closely watching the commission, released its own blueprint, which lays out what it says are clear changes the public has said it wants. </p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Merrick Garland finally made his Supreme Court debut on Tuesday. Not in a justice’s black robe, but wearing the striped pants and jacket with tails reserved for government lawyers appearing before the court.</p>
<p>The onetime high court nominee was there to take part in a tradition that dates back more than 200 years: to be introduced to the justices as the nation’s attorney general.</p>
<p>Prelogar, who recently argued two different abortion cases before the justices, stepped to the podium and made her introduction of the nation’s 86th attorney general.</p>
<p>Garland said just five words in response: “Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.” The moment was so brief he didn’t even remove his mask. Then he slipped out of the courtroom. </p>

<div><div><h1>Court suggests religious schools OK to get Maine tuition aid</h1></div><div>By MARK SHERMANDecember 8, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>After nearly two hours of arguments, the court’s six conservative justices seemed largely unpersuaded by Maine’s position that the state is willing to pay for the rough equivalent of a public education, but not religious inculcation.</p>
<p>The court’s three liberal justices signaled they were more aligned with the state’s arguments.</p>
<p>The case is the latest test of religious freedoms for a Supreme Court that has favored faith-based discrimination claims, including in other state programs that had sought to keep public money from religious organizations. </p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh used an example of neighbors, one choosing a secular private school and the other opting for a religious school for their children. The first family gets the state aid, but not the second.</p>
<p>“That’s just discrimination on the basis of religion right there at the neighborhood level,” Kavanaugh said.</p>
<p>But Justice Elena Kagan said Maine had seemed to design its program to avoid raising “questions of religious favoritism, religious division and so forth.” </p>
<p>Students who live in a district with public schools or in a district that contracts with another public system are ineligible for the tuition program. </p>
<p>Most of the justices attended religious schools, and several send or have sent their children to them. No one spoke of those experiences in court Wednesday.</p>
<p>But Christopher Taub, Maine’s chief deputy attorney general, told the justices that the critical issue is not the location of the school, but whether it is “inculcating people in a particular religion.”</p>
<p>Taub drew the ire of Justice Samuel Alito, who noted that parents could send their children to elite private schools and have the state pick up part of the tab.</p>
<p>“That’s the rough equivalent of a public education?” Alito asked derisively.</p>
<p>Kagan said the court has allowed states to make different decisions at or near the intersection of church and state.</p>
<p>The Bangor school said it would not hire teachers or admit students who are transgender. Both schools said they do not hire gay or lesbian teachers, according to court records. </p>
<p>Last year, the high court ruled 5-4 that states must give religious schools the same access to public funding that other private schools receive, preserving a Montana scholarship program that had largely benefited students at religious institutions.</p>
<p>In that case, the court said states don’t have to allow public money to be used in private education. But they can’t keep religious schools out of such programs, once created. </p>
<p>Critical race theory made a brief appearance at Wednesday’s arguments. After Kagan asked whether a “white supremacist school” would be included in the program and Taub assured her it would not, Alito chimed in.</p>
<p>“Would you say the same thing about a school that teaches critical race theory?” he asked.</p>
<p>Taub replied: “I mean, that one’s closer because, frankly, I don’t -- I don’t really know exactly what it means to teach critical race theory.” </p>
<p>A decision in Carson v. Makin, 20-1088, is expected by late June.</p>
<div><div><h1>Native corporations face deadline for federal relief funds</h1></div><div>By BECKY BOHRERDecember 8, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Alaska Native corporations face a year-end deadline to use federal coronavirus relief funds that the U.S. Supreme Court in late June ruled they were entitled to receive.</p>
<p>She also cited challenges in setting up websites, application processes or other infrastructure to handle and distribute funds, particularly for corporations with limited staff or in areas with “basic to nonexistent” internet service. </p>

<li><div><a><h4>S Korea: Unidentified person crosses border into North Korea</h4></a></div></li>
<p>U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, an Alaska Republican, in October called the upcoming deadline an “unnecessary rush.” Corporations were allocated around $444 million, according to the offices of Alaska Sens. Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski.</p>
<p>The U.S. Senate in October passed legislation that would extend by one year — until Dec. 31, 2022 — the deadline to use the funds, and the House was expected to consider similar legislation.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Don Young, Alaska’s lone House member, is “determined” to secure an extension for Alaska Native organizations and tribes across the country, spokesperson Zack Brown said.</p>
<p>The statement said the agency does not have information on the amount of funds that have yet to be spent. The statement said Treasury supports an extension of the deadline for tribal governments and Native corporations.</p>
<p>Altogether, there are more than 180 Alaska Native regional and village corporations. Funding for Alaska Native corporations was tied up in the courts until the U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled that they were entitled to the money. </p>
<p>Treasury, in response to the GAO report, said it put into practice “lessons learned” on tribal consultations and communications and would update its tribal consultation policy. </p>
<p>Bissett said the minimum that Native corporations were expected to receive was $100,000. Bissett noted that while some corporations have faced challenges, others have already allocated their funds.</p>
<p>He said the money was provided as reimbursements. Some “health and safety modifications” were also made to the corporation’s headquarters building in Juneau, he said. </p>
<p>Pierre said Goldbelt has been fortunate working through the process and supports corporations being able to fully use their funds. He noted the pandemic and hardships, such as costs to get supplies to rural communities, are ongoing. </p>

<p>The recommendations are not just a liberal fantasy. Some of the state’s most important policymakers helped write them, including Toni Atkins, the San Diego Democrat who leads the state Senate and attended multiple meetings. </p>
<p>Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom started the group himself and in an interview last week with The Associated Press said some of the report’s details will be included in his budget proposal in January.</p>

<p>Now, California abortion providers are asking California to make it easier for those people to get to the state. </p>
<p>Planned Parenthood, which accounts for about half of California’s abortion clinics, said it served 7,000 people from other states last year.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at how to build capacity and build workforce,” said Jodi Hicks, CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California. “It will take a partnership and investment with the state.”</p>
<p>Abortion opponents in California, meanwhile, are also preparing for a potential surge of patients from other states seeking the procedure — only they hope to convince them not to do it.</p>
<p>He added: “In many ways, that work is going to be even more important, both in light of the Supreme Court’s decision and in light of whatever Sacramento decides they are going to do in response.” </p>

<div><div><h1>Court rejects Trump’s efforts to keep records from 1/6 panel</h1></div><div>By ERIC TUCKER and ZEKE MILLERDecember 10, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal appeals court ruled Thursday against an effort by former President Donald Trump to shield documents from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.</p>
<p>But Trump’s spokeswoman said the matter was far from settled. </p>
<p>In its ruling, the court said the executive privilege being asserted by Trump is not a personal privilege but instead one that he “stewards” for the “benefit of the Republic.”</p>
<p>Biden had the committee defer its requests for some of the early documents that might have posed privilege claims, and officials expect more documents in subsequent tranches will be subject to the same outcome.</p>
<p>Trump sued the House Jan. 6 committee and the National Archives to stop the White House from allowing the release of documents related to the insurrection. Biden had waived Trump’s executive privilege claims as the current officeholder.</p>
<p>Republican presidents nominated six of the nine Supreme Court justices, including three chosen by Trump.</p>
