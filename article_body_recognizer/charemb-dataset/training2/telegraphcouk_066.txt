<h1> Galina Samsova, magnetic, soaring star of London Festival Ballet and Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet – obituary </h1>
<p> With her Russian-trained technical virtuosity, she championed new works and won critical acclaim as a deliverer of fireworks </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 22 December 2021 • 2:41pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>“I can still hear that cry in my head,” she recalled. “It was a very important lesson about the power of the illusion you are conveying.”</p>
<p>She later became Scottish Ballet’s artistic director and a notable producer of classical stagings for Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet (later Birmingham Royal Ballet) and London City Ballet.</p>
<p>To British stages in the 1960s she brought Russian classical majesty and a ravishing, soaring jump, as well as a sense of humour and personality that attracted many ballet-makers in the fertile British choreographic scene.</p>
<p>Only in her forties was she invited to make her debut at the Royal Ballet as a guest artist – the performances wildly acclaimed – and she was still dancing with undimmed brilliance in her early fifties.</p>
<p>Marrying a fellow dancer who had been born in Canada, Alexander Ursuliak, she was permitted in the Khrushchev thaw of 1960 to leave with Ursuliak to join the National Ballet of Canada, where she quickly emerged as a bright star.</p>
<p>Over the next nine years she became the company’s star, often partnered by the French-Russian dancer André Prokovsky, whom she married after divorcing Ursuliak.</p>
<p>“We could have gone on dancing classics till we were blue in the face,” explained Prokovsky, characterising New London Ballet as a company for “the adventurous”.</p>
<p>For Galina Samsova, however, the break-up merely launched another remarkable chapter, and in 1978, aged 41, she began a superb decade as ballerina with Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet (the Covent Garden Royal Ballet’s sister company). </p>
<p>Finally invited by the Royal Ballet to Covent Garden, in the 1980-81 season, she danced Swan Lake and Giselle to critical ovations hailing one of the world’s outstanding artists.</p>
<p>Critics were more positively struck by Galina Samsova’s appointment that year as artistic director of Scottish Ballet, hailed as a much-needed resurrection after the death of the company’s founder, Peter Darrell.</p>
<p>Galina Samsova’s marriage to André Prokovsky ended in 1981; he died in 2009.</p>
<p>Galina Samsova, born March 14 1937, died December 11 2021</p>
<h1> Lady Nicholas Gordon Lennox, model who became the perfect diplomatic wife – obituary </h1>
<p> Alongside her husband she did much to foster Anglo-Spanish relations, and she went on to lead the development of Pallant House Gallery </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 22 December 2021 • 7:58pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>One day, on the train home to Chichester, she was unable to pay her bill in the restaurant car and a stranger, who turned out to be Lord Nicholas Gordon Lennox, younger son of the Duke of Richmond, came to her rescue.</p>
<p>They married in 1954, by which time Nicholas was private secretary to Harold Caccia, Britain’s Ambassador in Washington.</p>
<p>She also did much to promote British designers, including putting on a Mary Quant fashion show in Madrid, while the embassy dinner parties she and her husband hosted were known for a lively and eclectic mix of guests.</p>
<p>After her husband became Ambassador to Spain in 1984 the huge progress in Anglo-Spanish relations, to which the couple had contributed so much, was cemented by a state visit by the Queen in 1988, the first by a reigning British monarch.</p>
<a>Sir Geoffrey Howe</a> which ended with the Prime Minister removing herself to the Ritz while Mary Gordon Lennox medicated the shell-shocked Foreign Secretary with whisky.
<p>After her husband’s retirement, Mary Gordon Lennox continued her role as lady-in-waiting to Princess Alexandra, serving her for 50 years, which was recognised in her appointment as LVO and later CVO.</p>
<p>In 1997 Mary Gordon Lennox became chairman of the Friends of Pallant House Gallery in Chichester, which had been founded in 1982 in a Grade I-listed Queen Anne town house, to house Dean Walter Hussey’s art collection.</p>
<p>As well as increasing the number of “friends” from 700 to 4,000, she raised funds for the building of new galleries, designed by Long Kentish with Sir Colin St John Wilson, and for an ambitious exhibition programme.</p>
<p>On the death in 2017 of her brother-in-law, the <a>10th Duke of Richmond</a>, she became the gallery’s Life President.</p>
<p>In later life she continued to keep Spanish hours, swam in the sea well into her eighties, kept up with an extensive circle of friends and enjoyed the seaside garden she had carefully created over the years.</p>
<p>She faced the death of her husband in 2004 and the tragic early death of their only son <a>Anthony</a> with extraordinary fortitude. She is survived by three daughters.</p>

<h1> James Wharram, world voyager in Polynesian catamarans whose passion for boat-design went with an enthusiasm for free love – obituary </h1>
<p> He went into business making his ‘double canoes’ for people in what was described as a ‘William Morris-like boat-building commune’ </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 23 December 2021 • 10:12am </time> </div> </div>
<p>His achievement was mostly dismissed by the British yachting fraternity as a favourable wind “drift” voyage, though they ignored the storms he had weathered in the Bay of Biscay and an unusually rough trade wind passage to Trinidad.</p>
<p>The general press were more interested in photographs of the crew showing their lack of attire on board, suggestive of a ménage a trois, one national paper headline reading “Love Tangle on the Raft”.</p>
<p>He told the story of those first voyages in Two Girls, Two Catamarans (1969), which also confirmed newspaper speculation that his unorthodox views on boat design were accompanied by an equally unorthodox lifestyle.</p>
<p>For as his Dutch-born partner Hanneke Boon recalled after his death, “James lived his entire life openly with more than one woman at the same time, as many as five in his prime in the 1970s, with whom he built and sailed his boats.”</p>
<p>After the three adventurers made it to Trinidad, Jutta gave birth to Wharram’s first son, and while building the Rongo they lived in a raft house he had built out of bamboo.</p>
<p>With a combination of free love and boat-building, he established a thriving trade in self-build designs, based first in Pembrokeshire and then from 1982 in Devoran, Cornwall.</p>
<p>Between 1987 and 1992, Wharram and Hanneke Boon built the 63-foot catamaran Spirit of Gaia, which, from 1994 to 1998 they and Ruth sailed into the Pacific and round the world, to study Indo-Pacific canoe-craft.</p>
<p>Wharram only received public recognition from the sailing establishment in later years, but in 2018 he won a lifetime achievement award from Classic Boat Magazine.</p>
<p>His final project was an autobiography, written with Hanneke, and published this year as People of the Sea.</p>
<p>His wife Ruth died in 2013. She had no children, but in her obituary, written by Hanneke Boon, she was described as “mother” to Hannes, her husband’s son with Jutta, and “grandmother” to Jamie, his son with Hanneke.</p>
<p>Hanneke Boon survives him with his children.</p>

<h1> Joan Didion, novelist, essayist and screenwriter who emerged as part of the 1960s wave that became known as the New Journalism – obituary </h1>
<p> Her acclaimed 2005 book The Year of Magical Thinking effectively created the genre of grief memoir </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 23 December 2021 • 5:45pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>What distinguished her writing was her irony, her sense of the rhythms of language and the juxtapositions of the broad sweep of history with telling visual details which evoke time and a mood. </p>
<a>Gore Vidal</a>, she lived lifestyles and made her name by writing perceptive essays which anatomised the disintegrating American dream.
<p>The plot harps on the gulf between the surface narrative and the darker reality: Elena McMahon acts as her sick old father’s surrogate in one last business deal, the supply of arms to the Nicaraguan Contras.</p>
<p>Nowhere, as Joan Didion revealed in her otherwise impersonal memoir Where I Was From (2003), was the gap between the myth and the reality wider than in California, where she was born on December 5 1934. </p>
<p>“I was born in Sacramento, and lived in California most of my life,” she wrote. “Yet California has remained in some way impenetrable to me, a wearying enigma, as it has to many of us who are from there.”</p>
<p>She became an acute observer of visual reality and the nuances of speech. Aged five, she began keeping a notebook and would wander around the grounds of a local psychiatric hospital with a friend, noting down snippets of dialogue. </p>

<h1> Countess Bunny Esterházy, globe-trotting socialite and winning racehorse owner from a Hungarian noble family – obituary </h1>
<p> During the Second World War she was smuggled out of Hungary under a blanket but, postwar, led a gilded life of parties and travel </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 24 December 2021 • 6:04am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Esterházys were one of the most distinguished families in Central Europe, tracing their ancestry back to the Middle Ages, producing many interesting figures including a distinguished poet and a field marshal. </p>
<p>This was particularly unfortunate since de Vilmorin had already destroyed Bunny’s mother’s marriage to her previous husband, Pali Pálffy.</p>
<p>Bunny was only three when her father eloped with Louise. Her parents separated and divorced in 1944.</p>
<p>The Plesches went into racing and each year their enormous green Rolls-Royce would be parked outside Claridge’s hotel during the summer season.</p>
<p>Bunny had two sons, Alexander and Esmond. Her elder son died tragically at Oxford in 1985. She and Elliot were divorced in 1970.</p>
<p>She did not remarry, but enjoyed wins as an owner of thoroughbreds. She had six racing victories with Busaca, including the Yorkshire Oaks in 1977, four with Tanaka, and two with two year-old Bolak. </p>
<p>She won the Clive Graham Stakes at Goodwood in 1975, with Taros, ridden by Johnny Mercer, and walked away with the Childrey Stakes, while Busaca came second in the Ribblesdale Stakes, both at Ascot.</p>
<p>She could appear abrupt and disapproving, but hidden behind a sometimes forbidding manner was a kind and gentle heart with a generous sense of humour.</p>
<p>Though she professed to reject her Catholic background, a picture of Jesus and a rosary comforted her in her last weeks. She is survived by her son Esmond.</p>
<p>Countess Marianne “Bunny” Esterházy, born December 12 1938, died November 27 2021</p>

<h1> James Barclay, master huntsman who strove to introduce as many young people as possible to the pleasures of the countryside – obituary </h1>
<p> Born into an old hunting family, he was steeped in the sport and maintained all its traditions in a spirit of life-enhancing conviviality </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 24 December 2021 • 12:02pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>James Barclay, who has died of heart failure aged 62, was the scion of a remarkable Hertfordshire hunting dynasty whose family have been associated as masters with the Puckeridge foxhounds since 1896. </p>
<p>“We regularly had four and a half couple of dogs out from lurchers to terriers and would account for 12 brace of rabbits on a good day,” Payne recalled.</p>
<p>Barclay would think nothing of disappearing into a bramble patch to assist his hounds, once coming out covered in slurry. On another occasion he was spotted disappearing into an enormous fox’s earth until only his legs were sticking out.</p>
<p>After schooling at Stanbridge Earls, the now disbanded Hampshire public school favoured by less academic sprigs of the nobility, young James went as countryman to the North Tipperary in Ireland and then to Stephen Lambert at the Heythrop. </p>
<p>He assumed his first mastership as huntsman of the Essex and Suffolk (1983-87). It was there, in 1984, that he met his future wife Lucy Taylor at the local point-to-point.</p>
<p>On the invitation of Elizabeth-Anne, Lady Hastings, Barclay joined her in the joint mastership of the Fitzwilliam foxhounds in Cambridgeshire, which he did for 12 happy and harmonious seasons. </p>
<p>While at the Fitzwilliam, Barclay formed one of his many hunting friendships, with Major Jonathon Seed, then master and huntsman of the Royal Artillery in Wiltshire. </p>
<p>“We did week-long hunting exchanges, with all the soldiers joining in, often cub-hunting in the morning and afternoon each day. With the evening parties as well, it required a strong constitution, and James led from the front.”</p>
<p>“He cared more deeply for the countryside and hunting than anyone I know,” said Jonathon Seed. “Although he was from the Establishment he was also never afraid to take on the Establishment.”</p>
<p>There followed three more joint masterships for Barclay, at the Cottesmore (1999-2002), South Wold (2002-2003) and Grove and Rufford (2010-12), latterly as a non-riding master. </p>
<p>A countryman and family man to his boots, Barclay is survived by Lucy, and by their two sons.</p>

<h1> Raymond Illingworth, cricketer who won county titles with Yorkshire and Leicestershire and led England to two Ashes series victories – obituary </h1>
<p> He went on to become coach and chairman of selectors for his country but endured a troubled return to Yorkshire in the late 1970s </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 25 December 2021 • 3:39pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Raymond Illingworth, who has died aged 89, made his name in cricket as a Yorkshire all-rounder; he did not reach the zenith of his career, however, until he moved to Leicestershire at 36 and unexpectedly emerged as captain of England.</p>
<p>When, in the decisive final Test at Sydney, an Australian batsman was hit on his (helmetless) head, and the crowd began to throw bottles and cans, Illingworth simply led his team off the field until order was restored.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he enjoyed excellent relations with the Australian press, one journalist hailing him as “the most frank and straightforward captain ever to tour Australia”.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1946, when the 14-year-old Raymond left Wesley Street Elementary School, he averaged over 100 with the bat and had taken plenty of wickets at only two runs apiece.</p>
<p>“I have never played cricket for fun,” Illingworth wrote, “but I have always played it for pleasure.” Certainly, he would always bitterly resent every run scored off him.</p>
<p>Originally he had bowled at medium pace; while still a teenager, however, he switched to spin, developing his characteristic soft-shoe shuffle to the wicket before delivering the ball with a low arm, albeit from a classic sideways-on position.</p>
<p>The young Illingworth was also a talented footballer, whose skills at wing-half earned him the possibility of trials with Aston Villa, Huddersfield Town and Bradford City. But in those days cricket was better paid.</p>
<p>Together with his future rival Fred Titmus, in 1951 Illingworth represented the RAF against both the Navy and the Army at Lord’s, on the latter occasion batting at No 3 and collecting the only pair (a duck in both innings) of his career.</p>
<p>Fred Trueman believed that if Illingworth had played for any other county than Yorkshire he would have batted at No 3 and regularly amassed 2,000 runs a season. As things were, his progress was slower.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Illingworth made steady progress, winning his county cap in 1955 and two years later doing the double (1,000 runs and 100 wickets) for the first of six times. In 1958 he made his debut for England against New Zealand at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>In the 1960s Yorkshire won the title six times, and before 1969 never finished lower than fifth. Illingworth enjoyed a succession of golden years, doing the double four times between 1960 and 1964.</p>
<p>The reject was quickly snapped up to captain Leicestershire. Then in May 1969 Colin Cowdrey, the England captain, snapped an Achilles tendon and Illingworth was appointed in his place.</p>
<p>With rival off-spinners such as David Allen, Fred Titmus, John Mortimore and Pat Pocock available, Illingworth owed much to the appointment in 1966 of his Yorkshire colleague Brian Close as England captain.</p>
<p>Now, in the two home series of 1969, Illingworth not only proved himself as captain, beating first the West Indies and then New Zealand. He also suddenly blossomed as a Test batsman with his 113 against the West Indies at Lord’s.</p>
<p>In 1970, after South Africa’s tour of England had been cancelled, a series was hastily arranged against a powerful Rest of the World side. It was no disgrace that England were beaten 1-4.</p>
<p>Moreover, he was involved in controversy at Lord’s when he refused to support the demand of Billy Griffith, secretary of MCC, that John Snow should apologise after barging into the great Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar.</p>
<p>In an atmosphere suppurating with recrimination and bitterness, Illingworth, largely supported by the players, did his best to hold the line against Boycott, even dropping him from the side in 1981 as a disciplinary measure.</p>
<p>That winter the committee decided not to renew Boycott’s contract, only to find themselves thrown out by his supporters. This meant the end for Illingworth at Yorkshire, both as manager and captain.</p>
<p>His books included Spinner’s Wicket (1969), Spin Bowling (1979), Captaincy (1980), Yorkshire and Back (1980), The Tempestuous Years 1977-83 (1987), One Man Committee (1996) and Fire and Ashes (2005).</p>
<p>Ray Illingworth was appointed CBE in 1973. He married, in 1958, Shirley Milnes; they had two daughters. His son-in-law Ashley Metcalfe followed in his footsteps, playing cricket for Yorkshire in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

<p>Wholesomely pretty models such as Lauren Hutton replaced more exotic figures like Verushka, and the focus on the jet-setting lifestyle gave way to a preoccupation with career women: actresses, writers and artists.</p>
<p>Signalling the change in direction, one of Grace Mirabella’s first acts as editor was to have Vreeland’s old office repainted from Chinese red to beige.</p>
<p>The magazine’s articles also underwent a tonal shift. Their remit expanded beyond the fashion industry to include pieces on personal finance, fitness and the arts. </p>
<p>Any tensions, however, were initially offset by the overwhelming success of her reforms. Circulation of American Vogue tripled from 400,000 in 1971 to more than 1 million by 1985.</p>
<p>Then came the American edition of Elle magazine, a vibrant French rival that had found a huge native following in the 1960s under the slogan “Si elle lit, elle lit Elle”.</p>
<p>Elle soon overtook Vogue’s nearest competitor, Harper’s Bazaar, finding particular favour with a young audience. Grace Mirabella’s approach, Condé Nast’s research suggested, had become too staid for their tastes.</p>
<p>She was born in Maplewood, New Jersey, on June 10 1930 to Italian immigrant parents who had lost their fortune in the market crash of 1929. Her father Anthony was a wine salesman with an addiction to gambling.</p>
<p>Vreeland had coined the term “youthquake” to describe the social upheaval of the early 1960s, and the fashions that adorned the pages of the magazine were tailored to a newly powerful generation. </p>
<p>Designs were based on bold geometric shapes and incorporated modern materials such as vinyl or plastic. The mini skirt and the bikini dominated, their arrival hailed by Diana Vreeland as “the biggest thing since the atomic bomb”.</p>
<p>By that time Grace Mirabella had largely retired from publishing, preferring to live quietly at her home in New York.</p>
<p>Throughout her life she retained a fondness for soft beiges and tailored suits in natural fabrics, accessorised with a mishmash of gold and silver jewellery.</p>
<p>The one permanent feature in her wardrobe was a Cartier watch, a proposal gift from her husband William Cahan. They married in 1974 and he died in 2001. Her two stepsons survive her.</p>

<h1> E O Wilson, biologist whose work on ants led him to great discoveries about the whole living environment – obituary </h1>
<p> His book Sociobiology argued that some forms of human behaviour are genetically influenced, and opened a new field of scientific inquiry </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 27 December 2021 • 6:15pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Tall, slender and slightly stooping, and with the courtly manners of the old American South, Wilson was a brilliant, intense writer with an almost poetic polemical gift. </p>
<p>A committee set up under the population geneticist Richard Lewontin and the biologist <a>Stephen Jay Gould</a> accused Wilson of sending human nature “back to the concentration camps”.</p>
<p>At a superficial level, Wilson’s theory seemed to suggest that human behaviour might be genetically predetermined and therefore beyond the reach of educational and social policy-makers to change. </p>
<p>By extension, his critics claimed, Wilson was suggesting that some human beings are genetically superior to others, echoing Nazi doctrine on race and eugenics.</p>
<p>In the end, though, Wilson’s work on sociobiology began a whole new field of scientific enquiry and set the stage for such influential works as Richard Dawkins’s The Selfish Gene. </p>
<p>His father had a peripatetic job as a government accountant and young Edward attended 14 schools in 11 years, ending up at the Gulf Coast Military Academy.</p>
<p>With no friends of his own age, natural history became the one constant in his life. As a young boy he spent his summers in Paradise Beach, Florida, where he gained his passion for nature while exploring the beach and its wildlife. </p>
<p>Wilson was admitted to the University of Alabama, then took a doctorate at Harvard, where he got a fellowship to travel to Cuba to investigate chemical communication in fire ants.</p>
<p>Wilson noticed how the worker ants dragged their abdomens on the way back to the nest from a food source, leaving a trail to the prey for the other workers. </p>
<p>On his return to America, he accepted an assistant professorship in Harvard’s Department of Biology, where he remained until his retirement, becoming a full professor in 1964. </p>
<p>The smaller the island, the smaller its population and the more likely these populations will become extinct. Moreover, the farther away the island is from the mainland, the smaller the number of species that will arrive each year.</p>
<p>From the late 1950s, Wilson extended his studies of the social life of ants to vertebrates, research which formed the groundwork for Sociobiology, for which he received the US National Medal of Science in 1977.</p>
<p>In a later book, Consilience: The unity of knowledge (1998), he maintained, controversially, that ethics and morality were not God-given, but were tools which had evolved through genetic selection, because they were beneficial for man as a species.</p>
<p>In The Diversity of Life (1993) he charted the bewildering complexity and interdependence of life on the planet and warned that we could be facing a wave of extinctions which could ultimately destroy the world’s ecosystems.</p>
<p>In The Future of Life (2002), Wilson claimed that “for every person in the world to reach present US levels of consumption within existing technology would require four more planet Earths.” </p>
<p>Edward Wilson married, in 1955, Irene Kelley. They had a daughter.</p>
<p>EO Wilson, born June 20 1929, December 26 2021</p>

<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 28 December 2021 • 6:08am </time> </div> </div>
<p>In 1999, at the World Championships in Seville, Hunter took the title in the last round ahead of the German Sven Oliver Buder in silver and Aleksandr Bagach, back from suspension.</p>
<p>In the run-up to the 2000 Olympics, Marion Jones declared that she was going for gold medals in five events. A knee injury put Hunter out of the Games, though he kept his coaching credentials and travelled to Sydney to support her.</p>
<p>Marion Jones went on to win three golds (in the 100 metres, 200m and 4x400m relay) and two bronzes (in the long jump and 4x100m relay).</p>
<p>In 2001 Hunter announced his retirement, and the following year he and Marion Jones were divorced; she said that one of the factors was that she felt besmirched by association with a drugs cheat.</p>
<p>Marion Jones eventually admitted to lying under oath; she was jailed for six months and stripped of the medals she had won in Sydney.</p>
<p>Besides his work at the University of North Carolina, Hunter was a strength and conditioning coach at University of Colorado.</p>

<h1> April Ashley, model and actress who became one of Britain’s first transwomen to undergo reassignment surgery – obituary </h1>
<p> She overcame a tough childhood and rebounded from a disastrous court case to become a senior figure in the country’s transgender community </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 28 December 2021 • 2:09pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>April Ashley, who has died aged 86, was a model, actress and trailblazing transwoman who became one of the first people known to have undergone reassignment surgery in Britain.</p>
<a>Omar Sharif</a> and Michael Hutchence.
<p>Feeling that she was entitled to alimony, she pressed to keep the villa in Marbella she claimed Corbett had promised her. His response was to sue for an annulment of their marriage on the grounds that she was “a person of the male sex”.</p>
<p>The marriage was nullified and April’s counter-claim for a decree on the grounds of her husband’s incapacity or wilful refusal to consummate was thrown out.</p>
<p>At the age of 15, George knew he wanted to be a girl, but joined the Merchant Navy instead. But in the middle of his second voyage in the Furnace Withy liner Pacific Fortune, he made a suicide attempt and was put ashore at San Francisco.</p>
<p>Back in England he was treated in Walton Hospital’s psychiatric unit with male hormones and ECT, though the doctor noted there was nothing wrong with him except a “womanish” appearance.</p>
<p>In May 1960, aged 25, George presented himself at Dr Burou’s clinic and, having paid £2,000, underwent surgery. The process was an excruciating one and the side-effects – dizziness, nausea and swelling – lasted for two years.</p>
<p>She took the name April, after the month of her birth, and Ashley after Ashley Wilkes in Gone With the Wind: “I knew the pinnacle of happiness, a joy beyond words that few others would know,” she recalled.</p>
<p>Back in England, the Ministry of National Insurance issued April with a woman’s card and she obtained a passport and driving licence which described her as female.</p>
<a>Bob Hope</a>, Bing Crosby and Joan Collins, and later in the 1976 Mexican drama Human.
<p>After the humiliation of the court case, April Ashley rallied and opened a restaurant, April Desmond’s, or AD8, in Knightsbridge.</p>
<p>In the 1980s she married Jeffrey West, on board the Queen Mary in Long Beach, California. They parted but remained friends. In the early 1990s she worked for Greenpeace, before taking a job in an art gallery.</p>
<p>In 2012 April Ashley was appointed MBE for her services to the transgender community, and two years later was given a Lifetime Achievement honour at the European Diversity Awards.</p>
<p>April Ashley, born April 29 1935, died December 27 2021</p>

<h1> Frank Hall, soldier who fought in Normandy and the Ardennes and went on to be the verger at Winston Churchill’s funeral – obituary </h1>
<p> He joined the forced crossing of the Rhine, and was later personally thanked by Clementine Churchill following her husband’s interment </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 28 December 2021 • 3:46pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Frank Hall, who has died aged 98, took part in the Normandy landings in June 1944; he subsequently served as the verger at the funeral for Sir Winston Churchill at Bladon, Oxfordshire, in 1965.</p>
<p>After getting his call-up papers, in January 1942 Hall joined the Oxfordshire Buckinghamshire Light Infantry (Ox and Bucks LI). In November he was based at Bulford Camp, near Salisbury, and began his training in gliders at Netheravon.</p>
<p>Hall, serving with the motor transport contingent of the 2nd Battalion (2 Ox and Bucks LI), landed at Sword Beach, Normandy, on June 9, D-Day+3. As he drove off the landing craft, the jeep and trailer behind him were blown up on a land mine.</p>
<p>He swapped his jeep and trailer for a big Italian lorry and, travelling by night without using his headlamps, he delivered petrol, rations and ammunition. A round trip was often 60 miles or more.</p>
<p>Hall had a variety of jobs after the war before marrying at St Martin’s Church, Bladon, Oxfordshire, and settling in the village. His wife, Jean, cleaned the church. He became the verger, rang the bells and kept the churchyard tidy.</p>
<p>The private ceremony was attended by Churchill’s close family and personal friends. Press photographers with long-range lenses were perched in trees and, after the interment, several thousand people filed past the grave.</p>
<p>The collection box in the church was soon full and Hall produced a flour sack to hold the donations. He was introduced to Senator Robert Kennedy and received a personal letter of thanks from Clementine Churchill.</p>
<p>He retired in 1988 but enjoyed exhibiting flowers and vegetables at local shows as well as being an active member of the parish council, village hall and sports committee. He and his wife ran the dance club for many years.</p>
<p>He was appointed to the Légion d’honneur in 2016. He also received the British Legion’s 50-year certificate for organising collections on Poppy Day.</p>
<p>Frank Hall married, in 1952, Jean Maisey, who survives him with their son and daughter.</p>
<p>Frank Hall, born February 19 1923, died October 3 2021</p>
<header> <h1> Mensi, charismatic singer with the punk band Angelic Upstarts – obituary </h1> <p> He came up from the mines to deliver furious songs that galvanised the disaffected youth of the North East and beyond </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 29 December 2021 • 12:35pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>One of their finest moments came in 1979 when they played a gig at Acklington prison, having secured the booking after Mensi assured the chaplain that Angelic Upstarts were a gospel group.</p>
<p>They played their first gigs at Bolingbroke Hall in South Shields, which could be booked for a few pounds. Admission was 50p or two sacks of coal. “We gave the coal to pensioners,” Mensi recalled.</p>
<p>Many of their early lives shows erupted into violence, which was quelled by Keith Bell, a former gangster and amateur boxing champion who managed the Upstarts until 1980 when he was jailed for four and a half years for arson.</p>
<p>The Murder of Liddle Towers attracted unwanted attention from the constabulary, who attended their concerts in plain clothes and carried out what the band saw as a campaign of harassment, stopping and searching them at regular intervals. </p>
<p>They appeared on the front cover of the Socialist Workers Party’s youth magazine Rebel, and accused the local police force of being National Front sympathisers.</p>
<p>They performed the title track – which also reached the top 30 – on Top of the Pops, which represented some kind of victory against “The Man”, as Mensi refused to mime and was allowed to sing live.</p>
<p>Several more followed over the decades, the most recent being Bullingdon Bastards in 2015.</p>
<p>He ran several businesses, including property development, selling used cars and owning a pub in Jarrow, and was believed to have at least 16 children from multiple relationships.</p>
<p>Mensi, born July 4 1956, died December 10 2021</p>
<h1> Keri Hulme, pipe-smoking New Zealander whose only novel The Bone People won the Booker Prize in 1985 – obituary </h1>
<p> She initially struggled to get The Bone People published, but later the Telegraph hailed it as ‘a gem’ </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 29 December 2021 • 6:32pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Keri Hulme, the writer, who has died aged 74, won the Booker Prize in 1985 for her first and, as it transpired, only novel.</p>
<p>A weatherbeaten, pipe-smoking New Zealander of part-Maori descent, Keri Hulme worked on the book for 12 years, writing at night while by day fishing for whitebait near her home in Okarito, a West Coast former gold-mining village.</p>
<p>But despite the controversies, readers lapped up the book, which sold more than a million copies. </p>
<p>Whitebaiting remained her passion and principal occupation - “You are fishing on incoming surf, so it is physically demanding but exhilarating”. Otherwise she was content to live off her royalties and write at her own pace. </p>
<p>She began to write poems and stories, and while she was still a little girl her father turned the sun-porch into a study for her. After his death when she was 11, she became her mother’s main emotional support. </p>
<p>Having left school she worked as a tobacco picker in Motueka, before studying Law at the University of Canterbury; feeling “out-of-place” there, she returned to tobacco-picking. Later jobs ranged from mill worker to television director.</p>
<p>Describing herself as “neuter”, Keri Hulme had no interest in romance; her deepest relationship was with her mother, who died in 2019.</p>
<p>She left Okarito in 2011, complaining it had degenerated into a “nasty McMansion village”. Latterly, suffering from dementia, she lived in a care home in Canterbury.</p>
<p>Keri Hulme, born March 9 1947, died December 27 2021</p>
<h1> John Madden, American-football coach turned TV sportscaster whose high-spirited style endeared him to millions – obituary </h1>
<p> Globally the commentator who was a household name in the US was perhaps best known for his endorsement of Madden NFL video games </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 29 December 2021 • 6:37pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>With his down-to-earth style combined with a burly and somewhat dishevelled appearance, Madden was immensely well-liked by the players, who appreciated his emphasis on having fun and taking nights off.</p>
<p>After stepping down, his transition into sportscasting was almost immediate. In 1979 he was drafted in to do some colour commentating on minor football games for CBS.</p>
<p>“People always ask, are you a coach or a broadcaster or a video game guy?” he said. “I always answer that I’m a coach; always have been.” His books included Hey, Wait a Minute (I Wrote a Book!), in 1984.</p>
<p>He married, in 1959, Virginia Fields, who survives him with their two sons.</p>

<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 30 December 2021 • 3:02pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>She returned to Opera North several times, including in Benedict Mason’s Playing Away (1994), an unusual “football opera” based on the beautiful game in which she was Cynthia, the star player’s mistress.</p>
<p>Overseas, Pamela Helen Stephen appeared in Verdi’s Rigoletto with Los Angeles Opera, but in Australia her husband, who was music director of Opera Australia, was criticised for casting her at the expense of local singers.</p>
<p>That same year she was Suzuki, fussing effectively around Mary Plazas’s petite Cio-Cio-San in Anthony Minghella’s mirror-strewn staging of Puccini’s Madam Butterfly for ENO.</p>
<p>Ill health led to her withdrawing from a Proms performance of Tippett’s A Child of Our Time in 2016 and thereafter she largely retired from the music business.</p>

<h1> Jean-Marc Vallée, Canadian director acclaimed for work in film and cable TV including Dallas Buyers Club and Big Little Lies – obituary </h1>
<p> His edgy TV mini-series Sharp Objects starring Amy Adams had intricate editing by Vallée himself, under a pseudonym </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 31 December 2021 • 1:25pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Nevertheless, the film put Vallée on the Academy’s radar, as the film earned three Oscar nominations, winning for Sandy Powell’s costume design.</p>
<p>Dallas Buyers Club won three Oscars – for McConaughey, Jared Leto (as Woodroof’s transgender associate Rayon), and make-up – and was nominated for a further three including Best Picture.</p>
<p>Yet Demolition (2015), with Jake Gyllenhaal as an investment banker sent spiralling after his wife’s death, disappeared without trace commercially; and a planned Janis Joplin biopic slated to star Amy Adams unravelled amid legal battles.</p>
<p>Despite that show’s psychological complexity, Vallée was relishing his creative role as much as ever: “I love it. You know, I’m like a kid on a set, a kid playing with a huge toy and having fun.”</p>
<p>At the time of his death Vallée was attached to direct Gorilla and the Bird, based on Zack McDermott’s memoir about a lawyer who experiences a psychotic breakdown. He was also developing a feature about John Lennon and Yoko Ono.</p>

<header> <h1> Betty White, beloved star of The Golden Girls whose TV career spanned eight decades – obituary </h1> <p> She had the longest uninterrupted career of any actor in television history and scooped eight Emmy awards </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 1 January 2022 • 10:16am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Betty White, the actress and comedienne, who has died aged 99, had, according to Guinness World Records, the longest uninterrupted career of any actor in television history.</p>
<p>Every era offered her an opportunity to redefine herself and win new fans: from live broadcasting in the 1950s, to sitcom star in the 1970s and 1980s, to a beloved elder stateswoman in the early 21st century.</p>
<p>The show spawned a sitcom, Life with Elizabeth (1952-55), based on sketches that she had performed on Hollywood on Television. Betty White was both producer and star of the series and it won her her first of five Primetime Emmy Awards.</p>
<p>The Betty White Show, which she also made in the early 1950s, featured her reading viewers’ letters and singing a few songs, but was essentially filler between other, better programmes.</p>
<p>Inevitably her television personality became defined as inoffensive and bland.</p>
<p>The director called “cut” but Betty White, with perfect timing and while holding a giant soufflé, kicked the door closed with her knee. This beautifully acted piece of passive aggression stayed in the episode.</p>
<a> Rue McClanahan</a> were encouraged to swap parts.
<p>The show that she created with her three co-stars, <a>Estelle Getty</a>, Rue McClanahan and <a>Bea Arthur</a>, was one part family-friendly sitcom and one part 1980s social satire that dealt with such issues as senility, HIV and gay rights.</p>
<p>Golden Girls was the pinnacle of Betty White’s career, but not its end. Even though she was the oldest member of the cast she outlived her co-stars and continued to act.</p>
<p>By the early 2010s she had attained the status of an idol, invited to appear on countless shows to participate in sketches and add some old world class to proceedings.</p>
<p>Betty White, born January 17 1922, died December 31 2021</p>
<h1> Colonel Tom Seccombe, Royal Marines officer who demonstrated both tact and bravery in the Falklands – obituary </h1>
<p> He stood his ground when under attack by Argentine bombers, while earlier he had led cross-border operations in Borneo during Konfrontasi </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 2 January 2022 • 5:35pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Colonel Tom Seccombe, who has died aged 87, participated in several campaigns, as well as the Falklands War, a conflict in which he displayed both bravery and tact, demonstrating the versatility of the Royal Marines.</p>
<p>In 1981-82 Seccombe was one of the staff at the Royal College of Defence Studies and, with no vacancies available at his rank in the Corps of the Royal Marines, was due to go to a dull-sounding job in Brussels when the Falklands War erupted.</p>
<p>Thompson wanted Seccombe there to balance the egos of their commanders, with the dynamic Captain Chris “Beagle” Burn in command of the embarked Naval Party.</p>
<p>At the landings in San Carlos Water at the end of May 1982, Seccombe became the deputy commander of the Commando brigade, landing armed with a walking stick which he had borrowed from Canberra’s first officer.</p>
<p>In the closing hours of the war the brigade headquarters was attacked by Argentine bombers; while others hurled themselves behind the nearest rock, Seccombe stood his ground.</p>
<p>He encouraged the defending Blowpipe hand-held surface-to-air missile operators and machine-gunners by shaking his stick at the enemy in the midst of earth-shaking explosions, while rocks and metal splinters ricocheted around him.</p>
<p>He was commissioned in 1952, when he also qualified as a landing craft officer and as a swimmer-canoeist, and served in the Royal Navy Rhine Squadron as second-in-command of 2 Special Boat Section.</p>
<p>Next, he spent a year as the assault engineer of 41 Commando before being appointed as the Officer Commanding Royal Marines in the commando carrier Bulwark, and then, after the adjutant’s course, as adjutant of the RM barracks at Eastney.</p>
<p>Seccombe was then appointed to No 2 Special Boat Section in Singapore, but realising his lack of recent qualification to command such a very specialised unit in the operational environment of Konfrontasi, he sought re-appointment in 42 Commando.</p>
<p>Tom Seccombe is survived by his wife Jacqui, née Wooll, and by their two sons.</p>

<h1> Richard Leakey, Kenyan palaeoanthropologist and conservationist who advanced understanding of human evolution – obituary </h1>
<p> He also became a television personality, transformed Kenya’s National Museum, and battled wildlife poachers and corrupt politicians </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 2 January 2022 • 6:13pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Richard Leakey, who has died aged 77, was a Kenyan conservationist, paleoanthropologist and political Mr Fixit whose discoveries contributed immensely to our understanding of human evolution.</p>
<p>Richard Leakey’s parents, Louis and Mary Leakey, were the palaeoanthropologists whose discoveries at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania revolutionised theories of early human evolution, proving that man was far older than had previously been thought.</p>
<p>Of particular importance was an almost complete fossil skull, found in 1972, which Leakey believed to represent a species called Homo habilis – one of our direct ancestors – and to be about 1.9 million years old.</p>
<p>On the ground, there was a need for greater intellect and co-operative endeavour to survive. It was, he believed, the beginning of farming which introduced conflict, when people began assuming a personal stake in the land.</p>
<p>He attracted well over $300 million from foreign donors and implemented community development programmes to give people living near wildlife reserves a stake in tourism.</p>
<p>A year later, disenchanted with Moi’s leadership, Leakey helped found the Safina (Swahili for Noah’s Ark) party, dedicated to attacking corruption and political repression in Kenya.</p>
<p>A descendant of British missionaries who came to Kenya in the 19th century, Richard Erskine Frere Leakey was born in Nairobi, on December 19 1944, the second of Louis and Mary Leakey’s three sons.</p>
<p>His parents often took young Richard with them on their fossil hunting expeditions; he found his first fossil – a pig – at the age of six.</p>
<p>Deeply resentful, Richard Leakey developed a late-flowering interest in palaeoanthropology and, despite his lack of qualifications, decided to go into business fossil hunting on his own account.</p>
<p>The grant of £16,000 went to Richard, rather than to Louis Leakey, leading to a rift between father and son which was only patched up shortly before Louis Leakey’s death in 1972.</p>
<p>In 1969 Leakey contracted a bacterial infection that led to kidney failure and was told he had less than 10 years to live. The condition worsened until 1979 when he was saved from death by a transplant from his younger brother Philip.</p>
<p>By the late 1980s, Leakey had become the best known individual in Kenya and in 1989 his aura of success persuaded the country’s president Daniel arap Moi to appoint him director of the KWS.</p>
<p>Such views brought him into conflict with Moi who attacked him for being a racist and an atheist. On one occasion he was beaten in a near-riot by Moi’s supporters. In 1997 he was elected to parliament as a member of the opposition.</p>
<p>In July 1999 Moi pulled off what observers at the time regarded as one of his great political coups. He recruited Leakey as cabinet secretary with a brief to streamline the civil service and end corruption.</p>
<p>But the rapprochement with Moi proved short-lived and in March 2001 Leakey resigned after a series of clashes and after the Kenyan Parliament had overruled his attempt to reduce the number of employees in Kenya’s bloated civil service.</p>
<p>In 2015, President Uhuru Kenyatta appointed Leakey chairman of the board of the KWS, in which capacity he brokered a controversial deal which allowed a railway to pass over Nairobi National Park on an 18m tall viaduct.</p>
<p>Although he was ruthlessly opportunistic, Leakey was capable of beguiling charm, and in his private life was said to be surprisingly low key and quiet.</p>
<p>His wife and children survive him.</p>
<p>Richard Leakey, born December 19 1944, died January 2 2022</p>
<h1> Alvin ‘Seeco’ Patterson, percussionist with Bob Marley and the Wailers – obituary </h1>
<p> A father figure to Marley, he was with him when gunmen attempted to assassinate him and comforted his during his terminal cancer </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 3 January 2022 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Seeco was born Francisco Willie in Havana, Cuba, on December 30 1930; his largely absent father was Jamaican, his mother Panamanian. The family moved to Jamaica in his childhood, and he eventually settled in Kingston with his mother.</p>
<p>He became friends with another denizen of Trenchtown, Bob Marley, who was in search of a mentor and father figure. Willie introduced the nascent Wailers – Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston – to Coxsone Dodd’s Studio One.</p>
<p>The great producer and reggae and ska pioneer initially sent them packing, but Willie persisted, and they went on to cut Simmer Down, their first hit, there.</p>
<p>His musical and mining careers continued in parallel, with Willie adopting the stage name Alvin “Seeco” Patterson, his sobriquet being derived from his given name, “Francisco” (another nickname was “Pep”).</p>
<p>Then in 1966 he was injured when a gas pipe under his works canteen exploded. Marley persuaded him to concentrate on music, and the following year he made his first contribution to the Wailers, on the tracks Lyrical Satyrical I and This Train.</p>
<p>Taylor and Marley’s wife Rita were seriously injured – both made full recoveries – but Marley kept his concert date, along with Patterson.</p>
<p>In September 1980, Patterson was with Marley when he collapsed jogging in Central Park, in New York, and remained with him during his cancer treatment in New York and Germany.</p>
<p>Following Marley’s death, Patterson continued to play with the Wailers band.</p>
<p>Patterson is survived by his wife and six children.</p>
<p>Alvin Patterson, born December 30 1930, died November 1 2021</p>

<h1> Eric Cockeram, Tory MP and Normandy landings veteran who brought a business brain to the Commons – obituary </h1>
<p> He criticised nationalised industries’ confusion of subsidy with investment and resigned following a technical breach of BT share sale rules </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 3 January 2022 • 11:55am </time> </div> </div>
<a>Margaret Thatcher</a>. Though politically closer to her, he was a good friend of Heath’s Chancellor
<a>Anthony Barber</a>. When Barber moved into 11 Downing Street on the death of Iain Macleod, he lent Cockeram his house in Montpelier Square and in 1973 made him his PPS.
<p>Cockeram brought to the Commons a business brain and tried hard to impress on MPs the difference between investment, which might bring a return, and subsidy, which would not. His prime targets were British Rail, the Coal Board and British Leyland.</p>
<a> Derek Ezra </a>of “behaving like an IRA bomber” in pushing through pit closures while expecting a hefty subsidy, and was an early advocate of privatising Rolls-Royce.
<p>Demobbed a captain, he joined the family business, being president of the Menswear Association of Great Britain in 1964, chairman of Watson Prickard from 1966 to 2001, and a liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Glovers.</p>
<p>In April 1987, weeks before the election, it emerged that Cockeram and his colleague Keith Best had made more applications for BT shares than the one permitted, and that Cockeram had made a second for British Gas.</p>
<p>Standing down pending a police investigation, he told his constituents: “In December 1984 I purchased some BT shares in my name. In addition, I purchased some shares for our then only grandson.</p>
<a>John Moore</a>, was sufficiently alarmed to have every MP’s name fed into the computer processing applications for British Airways shares.
<p>The Director of Public Prosecutions announced just before the election that no action would be taken against Cockeram, but by then, aged 63, he had decided to retire. Back on Merseyside, he became chairman of Johnson Fry (Northern) Ltd.</p>
<p>A “name” at Lloyd’s, Cockeram was a Freeman of the City of London.</p>
<p>Eric Cockeram married Frances Irving in 1949; she survives him with their two sons and two daughters.</p>
<p>Eric Cockeram, born July 4 1924, died December 25 2021</p>

<header> <h1>John Schlesinger</h1> </header>
<div> <div> <time> 26 July 2003 • 12:05am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>John Schlesinger, who died yesterday aged 77, was one of Britain's most gifted, if erratic, film directors.</p> </div> </div>
<i>Midnight Cowboy</i>, for which he won three Academy awards, Schlesinger ranged from violent thrillers (
<i>Pacific Heights</i>) to gritty social drama (
<i>A Kind of Loving</i>) and from romantic epics (
<i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i>) to quirky and perceptive human studies (
<i>A Question of Attribution</i>).
<i>Honky Tonk Freeway</i>, were downright disasters and despite several commercial triumphs, he was never wholly able to dispel the doubts as to his lasting significance.
<div> <div> <p>A hallmark of his best work was the painstaking exploration of human frailty. He liked, as he put it, "to rub beneath the surface. I don't believe in characters in films who haven't got any failings."</p> </div> </div>
<i>Midnight Cowboy</i> when Jon Voight (playing a male hustler) murders a client by forcing a telephone receiver down his throat, or the passionate embrace between two men in
<i>Sunday, Bloody Sunday</i> (1971), a film which Schlesinger regarded as marking his "coming out" as a homosexual.
<i>Monitor</i> series. Some two dozen documentaries followed, on a vast range of subjects.
<i>Terminus</i> (1961), a study of the passengers flowing through Waterloo Station in the course of a day. The film took both a Golden Lion award and a British Academy award and led to Schlesinger's first feature,
<i>A Kind of Loving</i>, in 1962.
<div> <p>Adapted from Stan Barstow's novel of Northern family life, <i>A Kind of Loving</i> was notable for its frank realism. When the script was first submitted to the authorities for censorship it received 33 slashes of the blue pencil.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <p>A reference to characters attempting to buy condoms drew particularly savage admonishment. "You could be opening the floodgates," Schlesinger was told. "Soon everybody will be doing it."</p> </div> </div>
<i>Billy Liar</i> (1963), a ribald comedy featuring Tom Courtenay as an undertaker's clerk with extravagant fantasies. The modish
<i>Far From the Madding Crowd</i> (1967), from Hardy's novel, both starring Julie Christie, were highly fashionable.
<i>Sunday, Bloody Sunday</i> (1971), a tragedy constructed around an improbable middle-class, bisexual love-triangle, the collapse of the British film industry ensured that he stayed there for many years.
<i>The Day of the Locust</i> (1975) was a hyperbolic and financially disastrous adaptation of Nathaniel West's satire on Hollywood.
<div> <div> <p> <i>Yanks</i> (1979), with Richard Gere and Vanessa Redgrave, was an over-long but compelling study of the social consequences of war-time romance between American troops and the women of a Lancashire town.</p> </div> </div>
<i>Honky Tonk Freeway</i>, a dire comedy about an American mayor who paints his town pink to attract tourists. American film industry executives found it anti-American, the critics savaged it and the film was ditched by the distributing companies.
<i>Honky Tonk Freeway</i> left Schlesinger demoralised and he returned to London and to the National Theatre to direct Sam Shepard's
<i>True West</i>. Then he received a script from Alan Bennett centred round an improbable real-life encounter in 1950s Moscow between the actress Coral Brown and the traitor Guy Burgess.
<i>An Englishman Abroad</i> (1983), starring Alan Bates as Burgess and Coral Brown as herself, brought Schlesinger back to the BBC and was hailed by the critics as the "television event of the year".
<i>Madame Sousatzka</i> (1988), an adaptation of a Bernice Rubens novel about the relationship between an ageing piano teacher (Shirley MacLaine) who nurtures an Indian boy (Navin Chowdhry) as her prodigy.
<i>Pacific Heights</i> (1991), a tense cautionary tale about an upwardly mobile couple (Melanie Griffith and Matthew Modine) who rent their downstairs flat to a nightmare tenant.
<i>The Innocent</i> (1994), an adaptation of Ian MacEwan's novel, tells the story of a naive young scientist (Campbell Scott) adrift in spy-ridden 1950s Berlin, who falls in love with a young German woman (Isabella Rossellini) with tragic consequences. In
<i>An Eye for an Eye</i> (1996) Sally Field plays a woman who hears her 17-year-old daughter being raped and murdered over the telephone and hunts down the killer.
<i>A Question of Attribution</i>, about the traitor and art connoisseur Anthony Blunt. He had further critical success with
<i>Cold Comfort Farm</i> (1995), a television adaptation by Malcolm Bradbury of Stella Gibbons's novel.
<i>Les Contes d'Hoffman</i> and
