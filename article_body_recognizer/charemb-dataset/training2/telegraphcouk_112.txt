<p>Rembrandt's masterpiece The Night Watch can now be examined as never before thanks to the largest-ever digital image of an artwork, placed on the Rijksmuseum’s website.</p>
<p>As part of a mammoth research project, the 1642 portrait of Amsterdam’s civic guard marching out to defend the city can now be seen online in pin-sharp detail.</p>
<p>Robert Erdmann, senior scientist at the Rijksmuseum and described as the ‘brains’ behind the gigantic photo told Dutch paper the Telegraaf that it was like being able to zoom in to minute satellite detail via Google Earth.</p>
<p>He added that, if compared to a scan of the human body, it would be like zooming in to the level of red blood cells.</p>
<p>Taco Dibbits, director of the Rijksmuseum, added that the image had “moved the boundaries of what we thought was possible”.</p>
<p>While the photograph makes it possible for the public to view Rembrandt’s painting in more detail than has ever been possible before - even though the museum is closed due to a Dutch coronavirus lockdown - it also has a scientific goal.</p>
<p>Researchers are studying how best to conserve the painting, which has developed a white patch on one side and visible ripples in the upper left corner.</p>
<p>The detailed imaging, which was done alongside all kinds of scans including for iron, copper, calcium and arsenic, will serve as a kind of line in the sand against which all future changes can be measured.</p>
<p>On January 19, the Rijksmuseum will begin the process of remounting The Night Watch on a new stretcher, in order to try to smooth down the deformations in the canvas.</p>
