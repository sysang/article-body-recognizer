<p>The dismissal came after Elden’s attorneys did not file an opposition to the defendants’ motion to dismiss by a Dec. 30 deadline. The attorneys declined comment Tuesday. </p>

<p>The motion says the lawsuit is “on its face, not serious,” and Elden’s conduct reflects that. </p>
<p>The judge gave Elden’s attorneys until Jan. 27 to file an amended complaint that addresses the issues raised in the defendants’ motion, or the suit will be more definitively dismissed. </p>

<p>MIAMI (AP) — Rapper Pooh Shiesty has pleaded guilty to a federal gun charge in Florida and avoided a possible life sentence.</p>
<p>Lontrell Williams Jr., 22, pleaded guilty Monday in Miami federal court to conspiring to possess firearms in furtherance of crimes of violence and drug trafficking, according to court records. </p>
<p>The Tennessee native faces up to 20 years in prison, although attorneys for both sides have recommended a sentence of about eight years, the Commercial Appeal reported. A judge will determine Williams’ sentence at a later hearing.</p>
<p>As part of the plea deal, prosecutors dropped three charges, including a gun charge that had a possible maximum sentence of life in prison, the newspaper reported. According to court records, the charges related to three separate events. </p>
<p>Pooh Shiesty first gained attention following collaborations with Gucci Mane and other rappers. He released his debut commercial mixtape, “Shiesty Season,” last February. It peaked at No. 3 on the US Billboard 200.</p>

<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — FBI Director Christopher Wray’s former chief of staff has been named the interim U.S. attorney for South Carolina.</p>
<p>Corey F. Ellis was appointed to the role Tuesday by Attorney General Merrick Garland, according to a news release.</p>
<p>Ellis succeeds former acting U.S. Attorney Rhett DeHart, who began leading the office in March after U.S. Attorney Peter McCoy <a>resigned </a> along with other top prosecutors appointed by former President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>As the state’s leading federal prosecutor, Ellis will now supervise a staff of about 150, including 62 assistant U.S. attorneys.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden has yet to announce a nominee, who must be confirmed by the Senate, to serve in the role permanently.</p>
<p>DeHart, the outgoing attorney, told news outlets he planned to enter private practice.</p>

<p>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) — When Gabriel Boric is sworn in as Chile’s president he’ll not only be the youngest to lead the South American country but also the first in Latin America to sport several tattoos.</p>
<p>The question is whether he’ll openly display them.</p>
<p>One person hoping he does is Yumbel Góngora, the self-proclaimed “tattoo dissident” who inked the three elaborate designs that fill Boric’s arms and back with sweeping imagery from his native Patagonia region.</p>

<div><div><h1>Court upholds US cockfighting ban, rejects challenge in Guam</h1></div><div>By JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER December 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>HONOLULU (AP) — A U.S. appeals court ruling Wednesday affirmed a ban against cockfighting in U.S. territories. </p>
<p>In 2018, former President Donald Trump signed a law banning all animal fighting in U.S. territories. The law took effect in 2019. Prior to the law, cockfighting had been illegal in the 50 states but not U.S. territories.</p>
<p>Linsangan appealed after a U.S. judge in Guam denied his motion for a preliminary injunction against the prohibition.</p>
<p>Linsangan didn’t immediately respond to a text message from The Associated Press seeking comment on the latest ruling.</p>
<p>Attorneys representing the United States in the case didn’t immediately respond to an email from the AP.</p>
<p>The ruling said Linsangan failed to show that cockfighting is a fundamental right.</p>
<p>“Linsangan’s evidence of cockfighting as a cultural practice both predating and outside of American history does not show that cockfighting is objectively deeply rooted in our Nation’s tradition,” the ruling said.</p>
<p>The Animal Wellness Action said it hailed the ruling because it came days before Guam cockfighting derbies advertised for New Year’s Day. </p>
<p>This story has been corrected to show that the animal welfare group that hailed the ruling is Animal Wellness Action.</p>
<div><div><h1>Talks on Iran nuclear deal to resume in Vienna on Monday</h1></div><div>December 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>BERLIN (AP) — Negotiators from Iran and five world powers that are trying to revive a tattered 2015 nuclear deal will resume talks in Vienna next week, the European Union said Thursday.</p>
<p>The talks were adjourned nearly a week ago after a round marked by tensions over new demands from Tehran. They are chaired by EU diplomat Enrique Mora.</p>
<p>The EU said participants from Britain, France, Germany, China, Russia and Iran will resume their efforts on Monday. They had been interrupted to allow Iran’s chief negotiator to return home for consultations.</p>
<p>The United States has participated indirectly in the ongoing talks because it withdrew from the accord in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump. President Joe Biden has signaled that he wants to rejoin the deal.</p>
<p>The accord was meant to rein in Iran’s nuclear program in return for loosened economic sanctions. </p>
<p>Following the U.S. decision to withdraw from the deal and reimpose sanctions on Iran, Tehran has ramped up its nuclear program again by enriching uranium well beyond the thresholds allowed by the agreement. </p>

<p>Iran has also restricted monitors from the U.N.’s atomic watchdog agency from accessing its nuclear facilities, raising concerns about what the country is doing out of view.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A Biden administration effort to reunite children and parents who were separated under President Donald Trump’s zero-tolerance border policy has made increasing progress as it nears the end of its first year. </p>
<p>The Department of Homeland Security announced Thursday that 100 children, mostly from Central America, are back with their families and about 350 more reunifications are in process after it took steps to enhance the program.</p>

<p>Amid widespread condemnation, including from Republicans, <a>Trump stopped the practice</a> in June 2018 just days before a judge ordered an end to the program in response to a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union.</p>
<p>“Obviously, this is nowhere near the end,” Brane said. “This is just the beginning of this ramp up and hopefully families will see that reunifications are happening and they will feel confident coming forward.”</p>
<p>Hundreds of families have also filed lawsuits against the federal government. </p>
<p><a>The Justice Department last week told lawyers representing several groups of families that it was withdrawing from settlement negotiations, </a> after eight months of talks, and would defend each case in court. </p>
<p>That came after media reports of a proposed settlement that would include payments of several hundred thousand dollars to each affected person sparked outrage among Biden administration critics in Congress and elsewhere.</p>
<div><div><h1>Hedge fund CEO draws high-level support in GOP Senate race</h1></div><div>By MARC LEVYDecember 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Christine Toretti, Pennsylvania’s longtime Republican national committeewoman, and former state party chair Rob Gleason are among McCormick’s backers, as are fundraisers Pat Deon and Bill Sasso.</p>
<p>Whether McCormick’s high-level support will translate into victory in the May 17 primary election remains to be seen. </p>
<a>Mehmet Oz</a>, the heart surgeon, author and TV personality who carries unrivaled name recognition as the host of daytime TV’s “Dr. Oz Show.”
<a>Carla Sands</a>, Trump’s former ambassador to Denmark — have been making the rounds of party functions for most of the year, while Bartos toured the state by bus.
<p>Deon, the fundraiser, called McCormick a “winner.” </p>
<p>“He’s a salt of the earth guy who served his country and worked hard,” Deon said in a text message. “He can relate to someone who wears a hard hat or sits in a boardroom.”</p>
<p>The presidential battleground is a big electoral prize that backed Democrat Joe Biden in last year’s election and Trump in 2016.</p>
<p>Democrats have a strong primary field with far more electoral experience.</p>
<p>McCormick has avoided media, other than speaking with a conservative-friendly columnist, and has been meeting Republican officials in private meetings arranged by Toretti and other backers. </p>
<p>McCormick has lived in Connecticut since 2009 and worked for Bridgewater Associates, one of the world’s largest hedge funds. He is currently CEO.</p>
<p>To reestablish residency, the Pennsylvania native bought a house in Pittsburgh’s East End, near where he lived two decades ago before leaving in 2005 to serve in Bush’s administration. </p>
<p>Wealthy, connected candidates — McCormick, Oz and Sands — moving from blue states in pursuit of a Senate seat in purple Pennsylvania has fast become an issue in the campaign.</p>
<p>Some Republicans know McCormick through his father, who was the first chancellor of the state university system under then-Gov. Dick Thornburgh.</p>
<p>After high school, McCormick went to West Point, served in the Gulf War and got a doctorate at Princeton University before he headed into business in Pittsburgh, first as a consultant at McKinsey and Co.</p>
<p>He was a registered Democrat at the time, but found the local party hard to get involved with and instead, ended up volunteering on a Republican candidates’ countywide race, which began his transition to becoming a Republican, he said.</p>
<p>He held three different positions in Bush’s administration, departing after serving as the Treasury Department’s under secretary for international affairs.</p>

<p>Chapman will be the department’s fifth secretary or acting secretary during Wolf’s seven years at the busy agency. She will take over Jan. 8.</p>
<p>Chapman previously served almost two years in the department under Wolf as a policy director, from 2015 to 2017. Most recently she has been the executive director of the Washington-based Deliver My Vote, a voting advocacy group.</p>
<p>Chapman also helped run the voting rights program of the Washington-based Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.</p>
<p>After almost a year in the job, Degraffenreid will become a special adviser to Wolf.</p>
<div><div><h1>Trump endorsement of Alaska governor comes with a catch</h1></div><div>By AUDREY McAVOYDecember 29, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday he would endorse Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy for reelection, but only if the governor doesn’t back U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski’s bid to return to the Senate.</p>
<p>“In other words, if Mike endorses her, which is his prerogative, my endorsement of him is null and void, and of no further force or effect!” Trump said in a statement tweeted by his spokesperson Liz Harrington.</p>
<p>Trump has vowed revenge against Murkowski and other Republican lawmakers who supported his impeachment over the Jan. 6 insurrection. He’s endorsed Murkowski’s primary challenger, Kelly Tshibaka.</p>
<p>Murkowski also called for Trump’s resignation after the insurrection, in which hundreds of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of President Joe Biden’s election victory.</p>
<p>Separately, Alaska Lt. Gov. Kevin Meyer said he would not run for reelection next year. </p>

<p>But an AP investigation found that despite the new rules, racism and extremism remain an ongoing concern in the military.</p>
<p>As a result, investigative agencies such as the Naval Criminal Investigative Service or Army Criminal Investigative Division also don’t have a specific hate crime category, which impacts how they investigate cases. </p>
<p>The Pentagon did not respond to questions about how much money it has spent or budgeted for efforts solely related to diversity and inclusion, and how many employees are dedicated to it.</p>
<p>Pentagon Spokesperson Maj. César Santiago acknowledged in a statement to the AP that extremism and extremist ideology can have an outsized effect on the military force.</p>
<p>But Corke said it’s too soon to definitively say whether the updated policies will purge extremism from military ranks.</p>

<a>report</a> last year from the Government Accountability Office, show Black and Hispanic service members were disproportionately investigated and court-martialed. A recent Naval Postgraduate School
<a>study</a> found that Black Marines were convicted and punished at courts-martial at a rate five times higher than other races across the Marine Corps.
<p>DECADES OF REPEATED WARNINGS</p>
<p>Weinberger did issue a directive instructing service members to “reject participation in white supremacy, neo-Nazi and other such groups which espouse or attempt to create overt discrimination.”</p>
<p>But critics say the military’s response fell short and failed to meet the moment by not instituting new, stricter policies.</p>
<p>In July 2009, civil rights organizations again wrote to the DOD. This time to then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates urging the Obama Administration to take appropriate measures to deal with extremists in the ranks. No sweeping action was taken.</p>
<p>He also said that the new policies are unclear on how commanders would enforce the social media rules.</p>
<p>The DOD said it is commissioning a study to determine the extent of extremism in the military.</p>
<p>But in its report last week, the Pentagon said prohibited extremist activity among service members was rare.</p>
<p>“There’s no safe number of extremists in the military,” Pitcavage said.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, was one of the many members of Congress trapped in the House Chamber gallery on Jan. 6. as chaos erupted when a mob of insurrectionists stormed the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>“That was the first time in my life that I was on the receiving end of the violence of racism and white supremacy in our nation’s history,” Crow said in an AP interview earlier this year.</p>
<p>Crow said last week it’s too soon to determine whether the Pentagon’s policy updates are enough to weed out extremism, but he believes Austin is the right person to tackle the decades-long issue.</p>
<p>Experts on extremism say the military’s efforts to address racism and white supremacy need to start before recruits actually join the various services. One key area: vetting recruit’s social media posts. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said it has a robust screening procedure, including a fingerprint check and an FBI background check. Recruits are also screened for offensive, racist, or supremacist tattoos.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t currently “have the capability to conduct social media screenings,” DOD officials said in a statement.</p>
<p>That figure includes 118 individuals who are facing charges for their involvement in the Capitol insurrection. Of the 458 people, 83.6%, or 383, were no longer serving when they were arrested for committing extremist crimes.</p>
<p>Veterans like Reuben Keith Green said it’s disheartening to see the military struggling decade after decade to deal with racism and extremism in its ranks.</p>
<p>This year, he said he served as a guest speaker for a Pentagon program that was part of Secretary Lloyd Austin’s extremism stand-down.</p>
<p>But Green said while the stand-down was a step in the right direction, he believes the military has yet to address the “everyday racism that is based on extremist views.”</p>
<p>“If my CO (commanding officer) is a member of the KKK, am I going to report discrimination or extremist behavior to him or her?” Green said.</p>
<p>He also noted that none of the policies specifically address acts of discrimination or racism that are not “violent” in nature but could still have disastrous impacts on unit cohesion and service members of color.</p>
<p>“The military has let this white supremacist, racist issue fester for so long,” Green said. “They’ve been trying to hide the actual truth and now it’s blowing up in their faces.”</p>
<div><div><h1>‘Slow-motion insurrection’: How GOP seizes election power</h1></div><div>By NICHOLAS RICCARDIDecember 30, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>In the year since, Trump-aligned Republicans have worked to clear the path for next time. </p>
<p>Republicans who sound alarms are struggling to be heard by their own party. GOP Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming or Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, members of a House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection, are often dismissed as party apostates.</p>
<p>“These made up things that people do to jazz up the base is just despicable and I don’t believe any elected legislator should play that game,” said Bernier. </p>
<p>In Georgia, an election bill signed this year by the GOP governor gave the Republican-controlled General Assembly new powers over the state board of elections, which controls its local counterparts.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, the GOP-controlled legislature is undertaking a review of the presidential election, subpoenaing voter information that Democrats contend is an unprecedented intrusion into voter privacy. </p>
<p>Michigan officials say that if boards of canvassers don’t certify an election they can be sued and compelled to do so. Still, that process could cause chaos and be used as a rallying cry behind election disputes. </p>
<p>“They’re laying the groundwork for a slow-motion insurrection,” said Mark Brewer, an election lawyer and former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party. </p>
<p>Trump also encouraged former U.S. Sen. David Perdue to challenge Gov. Brian Kemp in the GOP primary. Kemp turned down Trump’s entreaties to declare him the victor in the 2020 election. </p>
<p>Additionally, some Republicans argue that state legislatures can name their own electors no matter what the vote tally says.</p>
<p>“The most motivated voters in America today are those who think the 2020 election was stolen,” he said. “Acknowledging this is afoot requires such a leap from any core American value system that any of us have lived through.”</p>

<a>The efforts are poised </a> to
<a>fuel disinformation and anger</a> about the 2020 results for years to come.
<a>two-thirds of Republicans</a> do not believe Democrat Joe Biden was legitimately elected as president.
<p>The result, experts say, is that another baseless challenge to an election has become more likely, not less.</p>
<p>This time, experts argue, is different: Never in the country’s modern history has a a major party sought to turn the administration of elections into an explicitly partisan act.</p>
<p>That’s led to <a>a struggle for control of elections</a> between the state Legislature and the commission.</p>
<a>could lead to a state takeover</a>. The legislature also passed measures allowing local officials to remove Democrats from election boards in six other counties.
<p>After one of the Republican members defied Trump, local Republicans replaced her with Robert Boyd, who told The Detroit Free Press that he would not have certified Biden’s win last year. </p>
<p>Boyd did not return a call for comment. </p>
<p>A similar swap — replacing a traditional Republican with one who parroted Trump’s election lies — occurred in Macomb County, the state’s third most populous county. </p>
<p>The Detroit News in October reported that Republicans had replaced their members on boards of canvassers in eight of Michigan’s 11 most populous counties</p>
<p>TRUMP’S RETRIBUTION </p>
<p>Trump has been clear about his intentions: He is seeking to oust statewide officials who stood in his way and replace them with allies. </p>
<p>“We have secretary of states that did not do the right thing for the American people,” Trump, who has endorsed Karamo, told The Associated Press this month.</p>
<p>Trump also encouraged <a>former U.S. Sen. David Perdue</a> to challenge Gov. Brian Kemp in the GOP primary. Kemp turned down Trump’s entreaties to declare him the victor in the 2020 election. </p>
<p>“Right now,” Richer said, “the incentive structure seems to be strongly in favor of doing the wrong thing.”</p>

<p>GOP leaders are brimming with confidence.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have a hell of a year,” said Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the national GOP’s Senate campaign arm. “Every state that Biden won by less than 10 is now a battleground state.”</p>
<p>Democratic strategists privately concede that the party <a>will be lucky</a> to hold either congressional chamber in November, although the House may be in the most immediate peril. </p>
<a>retirements</a>, dozens of Republican-controlled state legislatures that are actively
<a>reshaping</a> House districts in the GOP’s favor, a struggle to enact all of Biden’s campaign promises, and a disengaged political base — especially African Americans. Their priorities on
<a>voting rights</a> have gone unfulfilled in Democratic-controlled Washington, even after last year’s supposed national awakening on race.
<a>curb access to the ballot</a>, combined with a Supreme Court decision expected next summer that
<a>could</a> dramatically erode or dismantle
<a>abortion rights,</a> could suddenly galvanize Democrats’ most loyal supporters.
<p>But for the GOP, perhaps no challenge is bigger than Trump himself.</p>
<a>Trump’s continued lies</a> about
<a>election fraud</a> could depress turnout among the millions of loyalists who believe his baseless conspiracy theories.
<p>“We just have to limit the damage that he’s causing,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who sits on the executive board of the Republican Governors Association.</p>
<p>Two of the 10 have already announced they’re not seeking reelection. </p>
<p>With the primary election season running from March through September, GOP infighting is likely to dominate the narrative for months even as Trump’s role in national politics probably still continues to grow.</p>
<p>HISTORIC HEADWINDS FOR DEMOCRATS</p>
<a>at least two new districts</a> will be safely Republican.
<p>Democratic legislators could pad their own advantages in places such as New York, but the GOP is positioned to help its standing elsewhere far more. </p>
<p>‘WE HAVE TO DO MORE’</p>
<p>At the same time, top national Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, his party’s only Black senator, are leading a national GOP effort to prioritize electing more women and candidates of color to state-level offices. </p>
<p>Democrats are hopeful that a major shift on the politically charged case would help rally suburban women to their side — voters who lifted the party in 2018, though polling this year hasn’t been conclusive </p>
<p>For now, however, the numbers are daunting for Democrats.</p>
<p>About one-third of Americans call national economic conditions “good,” down from roughly half last March. Only 41% say they approve of Biden’s stewardship, down from 60% in March. </p>
<p>“I have to remind people that there will probably be, what, $6 billion spent on this election cycle, and we’ll spend $3 billion,” Anzalone continued. “We have something to say.”</p>

<div><div><h1>Trump schedules Jan. 15 rally in Arizona</h1></div><div>December 31, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>PHOENIX (AP) — Donald Trump is returning to Arizona for a rally near Florence. </p>
<p>The former president plans to speak at the Country Thunder Festival Grounds on Jan. 15. </p>
<p>Arizona has been at the center of Trump’s effort to cast doubt on his loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election and would be crucial to his hopes of retaking the presidency if he runs in 2024. </p>
<p>Trump was last in Arizona on July 24, when he made a wide variety of false claims about the election during a rally in Phoenix. </p>
<p>Florence, about 70 miles southeast of Downtown Phoenix, is in the heart of Pinal County, a Republican stronghold that Trump won by 17 percentage points in 2020. </p>
<div><div><h1>‘A hell of a year’: GOP eyes big 2022, but weaknesses remain</h1></div><div>By STEVE PEOPLES and WILL WEISSERTDecember 31, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Not long ago, the the Republican Party was hitting bottom. </p>
<p>The GOP had lost the presidency and House in November 2020 and would soon squander its Senate majority early in 2021 — then watch with horror as supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol last Jan. 6.</p>
<p>What a difference a year makes.</p>
<p>At its most basic level, though, GOP optimism is born of the same political headwinds that have shaped U.S. politics for decades. The party that controls the White House has a tremendous disadvantage in the first election of a new presidency. </p>
<p>“We’re going to have a hell of a year,” said Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the national GOP’s Senate campaign arm. </p>

<p>Republicans dominated last fall’s elections across Virginia, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, even in areas Biden easily carried in 2020. </p>
<p>Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison attributes the pessimism to lingering anxiety from a pandemic that will soon enter its third year. </p>
<p>“We know that the economy is roaring is some aspects. But it’s about how you feel at this moment,” Harrison said, noting that many people are still grappling with fear and anxiety. </p>
<p>Republicans face their own significant challenges. A Supreme Court decision expected next summer that could dramatically erode or dismantle abortion rights could galvanize Democratic supporters. </p>
<p>But Trump himself is an even bigger wild card. </p>
<p>The former president has waged war against fellow Republicans whom he deems insufficiently loyal. Some GOP operatives also fear that Trump’s lies about election fraud could depress turnout among is loyalists. </p>
<p>“We just have to limit the damage that he’s causing,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a member of the Republican Governors Association’s executive board.</p>
<p>Two of the 10 have already aren’t seeking reelection. </p>
<p>With the midterm primary election season running March through September, GOP infighting is likely to persist for months. Trump has endorsed 60-plus Republican candidates and plans to weigh in on dozens more. </p>
<p>Republican-controlled legislatures have aided the Republicans’ potential House fortunes by drawing new congressional districts that are even more favorable to the party.</p>
<p>Many Republican legislatures have also enacted laws making it more difficult to vote in response to Trump’s false claims of voter fraud. That’s expected to disproportionately affect Democratic-leaning African Americans and Latinos.</p>
<p>Prominent Black leaders, meanwhile, are concerned with the Democratic-controlled Congress’ inability to enact federal legislation to supersede restrictive state laws. </p>
<p>“We have to do more, and we want it to be faster,” said Stacey Abrams, a Democrat making her second bid for Georgia governor. </p>
<p>At the same time, top national Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, his party’s only Black senator, are leading a national GOP effort to prioritize electing more women and candidates of color to state-level offices. </p>
<p>“The winning formula is getting people who are from Main Street,” said Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, head of the House Republican campaign arm. </p>
<p>Democrats are hopeful that a major shift on the politically charged case would help rally suburban women — voters who lifted the party during the 2018 midterms. </p>
<p>“We are the tortoise and they are the hare,” said New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, head of the House Democratic campaign arm. </p>
<p>“This isn’t people defaulting to Republicans because they like them,” Anzalone said. “And that can catch up to them as the environment changes.”</p>

<div><div><h1>Alaska governor thanks Trump for conditional endorsement</h1></div><div>January 1, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy has accepted a conditional endorsement from former President Donald Trump for his 2022 re-election campaign, a campaign spokesman said Friday. </p>
<p>Andrew Jensen, a spokesperson for Dunleavy’s re-election campaign, confirmed to the <a>Anchorage Daily News </a> that the message was sent by the governor.</p>
<p>“It was a written message from the governor to Trump’s people,” Jensen told the Anchorage newspaper. </p>
<p>Jensen said he didn’t know if the message was meant to be public.</p>
<p>“Even if it was intended to be private, it still is consistent,” Jensen said.</p>
<div><div><h1>Alvin Bragg sworn in as Manhattan DA, taking over Trump case</h1></div><div>By MICHAEL R. SISAKJanuary 1, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>As district attorney, Bragg inherited an investigation into Trump and his business practices from his predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., who declined to seek reelection last year after 12 years in the high-profile job.</p>
<p>“This is obviously a consequential case, one that merits the attention of the D.A. personally,” Bragg told CNN.</p>
<p>The investigation resulted in charges last summer against Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, and its longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg. In the fall, Vance convened a new grand jury to hear evidence in the case.</p>
<p>Trump himself remains under investigation by the office after Vance led a multiyear fight to get access to the Republican’s tax records.</p>
<p>As a top deputy to New York’s attorney general in 2018, Bragg helped oversee a lawsuit that led to the closure of Trump’s charitable foundation over allegations that he used the nonprofit to further his political and business interests.</p>
<p>Bragg, among a growing wave of progressive, reform-minded prosecutors across the country, defeated Republican Thomas Kenniff in November after winning an eight-way Democratic primary in the spring.</p>
<p>At age 15, a police officer stuck a gun in his face and wrongly accused him of being a drug dealer as he walked to buy groceries for his father. Bragg filed a complaint at his parents’ urging, sparking an interest in the law.</p>
<p>Being elected D.A., Bragg said voters had given him a “profound trust.”</p>
<p>“The fundamental role of the district attorney is to guarantee both fairness and safety,” Bragg told supporters on election night.</p>
<div><div><h1>Conspiracy theories paint fraudulent reality of Jan. 6 riot</h1></div></div>
<p>Millions of Americans watched the events in Washington last Jan. 6 unfold on live television. Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.</p>
<p>Yet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public’s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained <a>attack </a> on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.</p>
<p>Spread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes. </p>
<p>An examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:</p>
<p>CLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T TRUMP SUPPORTERS</p>
<p>In fact, many of those who <a>came </a> to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said — <a>proudly</a>, publicly, repeatedly — that they did so to help the then-president.</p>
<p>Different versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement <a>antifa</a>. </p>
<p>The next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim. </p>
<p>Yet Carlson claimed on his show that “in potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.”</p>
<p>Carlson is a “main driver” of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal’s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.</p>
<p>Members of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.</p>
<p>“Some of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,” Gaetz said.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.</p>
<p>In truth, the rioters <a>are </a> just <a>who </a> they <a>said</a> they <a>were</a>. </p>
<p>One was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who <a>resigned </a> following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.</p>
<p>During testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by “fake Trump protesters.”</p>
<p>“We have not seen evidence of that,” <a>said</a> Wray, who was appointed by Trump.</p>
<p>CLAIM: THE RIOTERS WEREN’T VIOLENT</p>
<p>Dozens of police officers were severely <a>injured</a>. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and <a>died</a> a day later of natural causes.</p>
<a>looked </a> for lawmakers, yelling, “Where are they?” In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.
<p>That’s not how some Republican politicians have described the <a>insurrection</a>.</p>
<p>Appearing on Ingraham’s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.</p>
<p>“By and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>Johnson has since said that he doesn’t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.</p>
<a>said </a> it resembled a “normal tourist visit.” Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.
<p>Trump called the insurrection a display of “ <a>spirit and faith and love</a>.”</p>
<p>Rioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage. Outside the Capitol someone set up a gallows with a <a>noose</a>.</p>
<p>CLAIM: TRUMP DID NOT ENCOURAGE THE RIOTERS</p>
<p>Trump may now want to <a>minimize </a> his involvement, but he spent months sounding a steady <a>drumbeat </a> of conspiracy theory and grievance, urging his followers to fight to somehow return him to power.</p>
<p>“Big protest in D.C. on January 6th,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 19, 2020. “Be there, will be wild!”</p>
<p>At one point, Trump did urge his supporters to “peacefully and patriotically make your voice heard.” The rest of his <a>speech </a> was filled with hostile rhetoric.</p>
<p>“We fight. We fight like hell,” he told those who would later break into the Capitol. “And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”</p>
<p>Now, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,” Trump said on Fox News in December.</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a <a>survey</a> last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.</p>
<p>CLAIM: ASHLI BABBITT WAS KILLED BY AN OFFICER WORKING FOR DEMOCRATS</p>
<p>Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker’s Lobby outside the House chamber. </p>
<p><a>Babbitt</a>, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed. An <a>investigation</a> cleared the <a>officer</a> of wrongdoing. </p>
<p>The Capitol Police Department protects all members of Congress, as well as employees, the public and Capitol facilities. The officer wasn’t assigned to any particular lawmaker.</p>
<p>Trump falsely claimed the officer was the head of security “for a certain high official, a Democrat,” and was being shielded from accountability. He also misstated where Babbitt was shot.</p>
<p>“Who is the person that shot ... an innocent, wonderful, incredible woman, a military woman, right in the head?” Trump asked on Fox News.</p>
<p>CLAIM: THE JAN. 6 SUSPECTS ARE POLITICAL PRISONERS AND ARE BEING MISTREATED</p>
<p>No, they are <a>not</a>, despite some assertions from members of Congress.</p>
<p>Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., said the Justice Department was “harassing peaceful patriots” by investigating their involvement in the insurrection.</p>
<a>complained </a> about their time in jail, it’s wrong to argue they’re being held as political prisoners. Authorities have said the suspects in custody are being given the same access to food and medical care as any other inmate.
<p>One of the most notorious rioters, Jacob Chansley, known as the QAnon Shaman, was given <a> organic food</a> in his jail cell after he complained about the food options.</p>

<p>Rapper Kodak Black was arrested on a trespassing charge Saturday in South Florida, authorities said.</p>
<p>Black, whose legal name is Bill Kapri, later posted bond and was released, the newspaper reported. Neither his publicist nor his attorney immediately returned an emailed request for comment.</p>
<p>Black had a three-year federal prison sentence for falsifying documents used to buy weapons at a Miami gun store <a>commuted by President Donald Trump</a> on his last day in office in 2020. He had served about half his sentence.</p>
<p>He was later <a>sentenced to probation</a> last April for assaulting a teenage girl in a South Carolina hotel room. Black was originally charged with rape, but accepted a deal and pleaded guilty to first-degree assault.</p>

<div><div><h1>With Trump backing, GOP Rep. Miller challenges Rep. Davis </h1></div><div>January 2, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>OAKLAND, Ill. (AP) — Republican U.S. Rep. Mary Miller of Illinois, who has a fresh endorsement from former President Donald Trump, has announced she’ll mount a primary challenge against five-term U.S. Rep. Rodney Davis.</p>
<p>Miller, known for controversy including quoting Adolf Hitler outside the U.S. Capitol, was first elected in 2020. </p>
<p>Miller’s Oakland home was drawn into the same district as four-term Rep. Mike Bost of Murphysboro. She previously said she’d run again, but it was unclear where. Illinois lost one House seat in the <a>new map drawn by Democrats</a>. </p>
<p>While members of Congress don’t have to live in the district they represent, Davis of Taylorville raised it as an issue. </p>
<p>“Miller is so desperate to stay in Congress she’s running in a district she doesn’t live in ...” Davis’ campaign wrote in a statement Saturday. </p>
<a>announced in November</a> that he’d seek a sixth term.

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — They’ve interviewed more than 300 witnesses, collected tens of thousands of documents and traveled around the country to talk to election officials who were pressured by Donald Trump. </p>
<p>Now, after six months of intense work, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection is preparing to go public.</p>
<p>But the nine lawmakers — seven Democrats and two Republicans — are united in their commitment to tell the full story of Jan. 6, and they are planning televised hearings and reports that will bring their findings out into the open. </p>
<p>Their goal is not only to show the severity of the riot, but also to make a clear connection between the attack and Trump’s brazen pressure on the states and Congress to overturn Joe Biden’s legitimate election as president.</p>

<p>“The full picture is coming to light, despite President Trump’s ongoing efforts to hide the picture,” said Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the committee’s vice chairwoman and one of its two Republican members.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any area of this broader history in which we aren’t learning new things,” she said. </p>
<p>Still, the lawmakers hope they can present the public with a thorough accounting that captures what could have been “an even more serious and deeper constitutional crisis,” as Cheney put it. </p>
<p>“I think this is one of the single most important congressional investigations in history,” Cheney said. </p>
<p>House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California, a close Trump ally, decided not to appoint any GOP members to the committee after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., rejected two of his picks last summer.</p>
<p>Kinzinger said the investigation would be “a very different scene” if Republicans allied with Trump were participating and able to obstruct some of their work. </p>
<p>“I think in five or 10 years, when school kids learn about Jan. 6, they’re going to get the accurate story,” Kinzinger said. “And I think that’s going to be dependent on what we do here.”</p>
<p>Democrats say having two Republicans working with them has been an asset, especially as they try to reach conservative audiences who may still believe Trump’s falsehoods about a stolen election. </p>
<p>The nine-member group has bonded over a friendly text chain where they discuss business and occasionally their personal lives. There are messages wishing a happy birthday, for example, or congratulating another on a child’s wedding. </p>
<p>“It’s good, it’s how Congress should be,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif. </p>
<p>For now, though, “we are still in the eye of the hurricane,” Aguilar said.</p>

<p>This is the end for the longtime Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback.</p>
<p>And rather than fight it, the player defined by his ability to fend off defenders with his left arm and make game-changing throws with his right embraced it.</p>

<p>But the numbers — as has often been the case during an 18-year career that includes two Super Bowl victories — were beside the point.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger played. The Steelers won. And so it goes.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh (8-7-1) will finish at .500 or better for the 18th straight season, or every year since the Steelers selected Big Ben with the 11th overall pick in the 2004 draft.</p>
<p>“That’s been the story of my career,” he said. “Not always pretty, but we find a way.”</p>
<p>The Steelers need a win over Baltimore next week and a loss by Indianapolis to lowly Jacksonville to make the postseason for the 12th time with Roethlisberger, a possibility he admits is slim.</p>
<p>“This is home, you know?” Roethlisberger said. “And I just, I know I was born in Ohio, but I live here and I’ll always be here.”</p>
<p>The only people more eager for Roethlisberger to retire than his family might be the Browns. Cleveland (7-9) — which was eliminated from postseason contention on Sunday — fell to 3-26-1 when facing Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>“If anyone questions how much I want it, turn on this tape,” Mayfield said. “I kept swinging. That’s who I am. That’s who I’ve always been.”</p>
<p>Mayfield plans to have surgery on his ailing left shoulder soon, though his erratic season made his long-term outlook murky for a team where instability at the position has been the norm for decades.</p>
<p>Things are different in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger was 22 when he took over for an injured Tommy Maddox in Week 2 of his rookie season. He never let go, leading the franchise to an era of success that nearly rivaled the Super Steelers of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Yet if there’s been one constant during Roethlisberger’s career, it’s been his mastery of the Browns.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger’s last win over Cleveland provided a small measure of revenge less than a year after he threw four interceptions in a first-round home playoff loss to the Browns last January.</p>
<p>That night was supposed to be the launching point for Cleveland heading into 2021. But injuries and inconsistent play from Mayfield among others will force the Browns to watch the playoffs from home for the 18th time in the last 19 years.</p>
<p>Not so for Pittsburgh, which heads into the finale of the NFL’s first 17-game season with something to play for.</p>
<p>“We’ve got another game,” Roethlisberger said. “We’ve got to keep fighting.”</p>

<p>White House officials offered a far more muted post-call readout, suggesting the leaders agreed there are areas where the two sides can make meaningful progress but also differences that might be impossible to resolve. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>'We were trapped': Trauma of Jan. 6 lingers for lawmakers</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered </h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<p>White House officials said Thursday’s call lasted 50 minutes, ending after midnight in Moscow. </p>
<p>Russia has made clear it wants a written commitment that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO and that the alliance’s military equipment will not be positioned in former Soviet states, demands that the Biden administration has rejected.</p>
<p>Biden told Putin a diplomatic path remains open even as the Russians have moved an estimated 100,000 troops toward Ukraine and Kremlin officials have turned up the volume on their demands for new guarantees from the U.S. and NATO.</p>
<p>White House officials said Biden made clear that the U.S. stands ready to exact substantial economic pain through sanctions should Putin decide to take military action in Ukraine.</p>
<p>He “noted that it would be a mistake that our ancestors would see as a grave error. A lot of mistakes have been made over the past 30 years, and we would better avoid more such mistakes in this situation,” Ushakov said. </p>
<p>Russia’s demands are to be discussed during the talks in Geneva, but it remains unclear what, if anything, Biden would be willing to offer Putin in exchange for defusing the crisis.</p>
<p>Draft security documents Moscow submitted demand that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The security proposal by Moscow has raised the question of whether Putin is making unrealistic demands in the expectation of a Western rejection that would give him a pretext to invade. </p>
<p>Steven Pifer, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in the Clinton administration, said the Biden administration could engage on some elements of Russia’s draft document if Moscow is serious about talks. </p>
<p>Biden and Putin, who <a>met in Geneva in June</a> to discuss an array of tensions in the U.S.-Russia relationship, are not expected to take part in the January talks.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence earlier this month determined that Russian planning was underway for a possible military offensive that could begin as soon as early 2022, but that Putin had yet to determine whether to move forward with it.</p>
<p>Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s Security and Defense Council, said Thursday his country believes there is no immediate threat of a major Russian invasion.</p>
<p>“Our experts say that the Russian Federation just physically can’t mount a big invasion of our territory,” Danilov said. “There is a time period needed for preparations.”</p>
<p>Russia has denied any intention of launching an invasion and, in turn, has accused Ukraine of hatching plans to try to reclaim control of territories held by Moscow-backed rebels by force. Ukraine has rejected the claim.</p>
<p>At the same time, Putin has warned that Moscow will have to take “adequate military-technical measures” if the West continues its “aggressive” course “on the threshold of our home.”</p>
<p>Last month, Putin voiced concern that NATO could potentially use the Ukrainian territory for the deployment of missiles that would be capable of reaching Moscow in just five minutes and said that Zircon would give Russia a comparable capability.</p>
<p>Past military incursions by Putin loom large.</p>
<p>In 2014, Russian troops marched into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and seized the territory from Ukraine. Russia’s annexation of Crimea was one of the darker moments for President Barack Obama on the international stage.</p>
<p>Biden, who is spending the week in his home state of Delaware, spoke to Putin from his home near Wilmington. The White House distributed a photo of the president speaking to the Russian leader from a desk lined with family photos.</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — If a 40-point drubbing at New England didn’t get Jacksonville owner Shad Khan’s full attention, then what’s being planned for the team’s season finale just might.</p>
<p>Frustrated fans are revolting against the Jaguars and have Khan in their crosshairs.</p>

<p>Khan fired Meyer on Dec. 16. In the three games since, the Jaguars have been outplayed by equally woeful Houston and the New York Jets and then thoroughly embarrassed in a 50-10 loss at the Patriots on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lawrence’s ball security has become an issue again. The rookie has eight turnovers in his last four games, looking so out of sync Sunday that interim coach Darrell Bevell considered pulling him in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Laquon Treadwell has at least four receptions in six straight games, making a case to return next season. A first-round pick by Minnesota in 2016, Treadwell has 30 catches for a career-high 410 yards. </p>

<div><div><h1>Sudan’s PM announces resignation amid political deadlock</h1></div><div>By SAMY MAGDYJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The prime minister said his efforts to bridge the widening gap and settle disputes among the political forces have failed.</p>
<p>He warned that the ongoing political stalemate since the military takeover could become a full-blown crisis and damage the country’s already battered economy.</p>
<p>“I tried as much as I possibly could to prevent our country from sliding into a disaster. Now, our nation is going through a dangerous turning point that could threaten its survival unless it is urgently rectified,” he said.</p>
<p>The October coup had upended Sudan’s plans to move to democracy after a popular uprising forced the military’s overthrow of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019.</p>
<p>“I have had the honor of serving my country people for more than two years. And during his period I have sometimes done well, and I have sometimes failed,” Hamdok said.</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, there was increasing speculation that he would step down. National and international efforts have failed to convince him to stay in office.</p>
<p>It also called for the appointment of the next premier and Cabinet to “in line with the (2019) constitutional declaration to meet the people’s goals of freedom, peace, and justice.”</p>
<p>Sunday’s fatalities have brought the death toll among protesters since the coup to at least 57, according to the medical group. Hundreds have also been wounded.</p>
<p>Allegations surfaced last month of sexual violence, including rape and gang rape by security forces against female protesters, according to the United Nations.</p>
<p>The ruling sovereign council has vowed to investigate violence against the protesters.</p>
<p>On Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged security forces to “immediately cease the use of deadly force against protesters” and to hold those responsible for violence accountable.</p>
<p>“We do not want to return to the past, and are prepared to respond to those who seek to block the aspirations of the Sudanese people for a civilian-led, democratic government,” he added.</p>
