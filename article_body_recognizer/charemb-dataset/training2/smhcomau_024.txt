<div>Travellers anxious as WA G2G app still denies entry after February 5</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Travellers planning to come to Western Australia or residents trying to get back into the state after its borders open on February 5 will not be able to get an approval for their trips through the Good 2 Go system until closer to the date.</p>
<p>Applicants have been automatically rejected from receiving G2G passes since approvals are based on the current border settings.</p>
<p>One Perth man told WAtoday he had planned to travel with his four-month-old daughter to New South Wales so his family could meet her for the first time but had his G2G application to come back home to WA after the trip knocked back.</p>
<p>“I contacted the [government] enquiry line about the rejection and was told they will only assess based on current restrictions, regardless of the date of entry,” he said.</p>
<p>“I also asked what they expect to happen come February 5 when we’re ‘open’ but nobody has permission to enter and was told ‘we’re not in the business of speculation’.</p>
<p>He said he would have been travelling anyway based on the Premier’s commitment to re-opening.</p>
<p>“It is incredibly expensive at the moment and our flights have already been rescheduled multiple times, but we’re pretty desperate,” he said.</p>
<p>“Restricting unnecessary travel such as tourism has made sense in the past while we were vulnerable to the virus but now that vaccination is so high and the other states are all open I fear we risk getting left behind.”</p>
<p>Acting Premier Roger Cook suggested the situation might change closer to February 5.</p>
<p>“But it really depends on the public health advice that exists in the lead up to early February,” he said.</p>
<p>Tourism Council WA chief executive Evan Hall said visitors and West Australians needed certainty.</p>
<p>“The government has been very clear that’s what will apply from the fifth,” he said.</p>
<p>Opposition health spokeswoman Libby Mettam said there had been a lot of frustration around the app, especially with West Australians trying to enter the state to visit dying loved ones.</p>
<p>“Every effort must be made to provide some clarity for returning West Australians,” she said.</p>
<p>“There have also been a number of tragic cases where this government have shown a complete lack of compassion for West Australians wanting to return home for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>“We do need to see more compassion by the McGowan government.”</p>

<div>African drumming, stand-up paddleboarding and fire pits: NSW regions on spending spree</div>
<p>After almost two years of benefitting from a decline in interstate and overseas tourism, NSW regions are rapidly spending to keep a $15.8 billion local travel boom from going bust.</p>
<p>Lake Macquarie mayor Kay Fraser said it’s important to invest in tourism to ensure visitors, and in particular families, keep returning to their region.</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to give Lake Macquarie a boost so we can get those tourism dollars here and money spent in our city,” she said.</p>
<p>Hunter local Erin Gillies, along with her two daughters, mother and sister, boarded the Lake Macquarie Ferry on New Year’s Day for its launch.</p>
<p>“I’m always looking for things to do with my girls, and new things to try out, so this was brilliant and a fantastic adventure to go on,” she said.</p>
<p>Luring families has been crucial to the region’s success during the pandemic, with the Hunter grossing over $802m from intrastate day trips in the last financial year. This is almost 25 per cent more than in the 2019/20 period.</p>
<p>Last month, Lake Macquarie Council announced a summer activities program featuring Aboriginal dance lessons, African drumming workshops and stand-up paddleboarding to “get people out and about”.</p>
<p>“We’re in a really good spot for families to visit our city, so we’re harnessing that and encourage that visitor participation,” Cr Fraser said.</p>
<p>According to Destination NSW, overnight regional travel expenditure reached $15b last financial year, with 80 per cent of visitors coming from within the state.</p>
<p>In Coffs Harbour, where $4.3 billion was grossed as part of the North Coast region, tourism operators hope that can continue.</p>
<p>Ahead of summer, holiday parks in Coffs Harbour were replenished with a range of facilities, including an 18-hole mini-golf course, new beachfront cabins and an open-air cinema.</p>
<p>Similar measures have been taken south of Sydney to retain intrastate travel as domestic and overseas tourism returns to a semblance of normality.</p>
<p>Ahead of summer, firepits and plants were installed at the South Coast Retreat in the Shoalhaven, south of Wollongong, with new co-owner Vickie Read hoping to create “more of an upper-class experience” for guests.</p>
<p>“We’ve left wine in the rooms and have asked them how we can better their experience … so we’re trying our best to update the cabin and give people a better experience while they’re staying with us,” she said.</p>
<div>Flight Centre faces long-term leisure travel decline: analyst</div>
<p>Australia’s largest travel agent, Flight Centre, faces a long-term decline in its leisure business as holidaymakers shift to making more bookings online and directly with airlines after the pandemic, according to one market analyst.</p>
<p>“This trend is also likely to erode Flight Centre’s bargaining power against airline when negotiating commission rates,” Mr Han said.</p>
<p>Leisure travel accounted for around 60 per cent of bookings pre-COVID with the balance coming from its growing corporate travel division.</p>
<p>Flight Centre managing director Graham Turner responded by saying the company’s own digital shift was well underway, with online bookings now accounting for about 20 per cent of transactions compared with 8 per cent before the pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr Turner said that except for a few larger airlines with near monopolies on certain routes, he expected carriers would continue to pay the same commissions given they would be competing fiercely for passengers. </p>
<p>Mr Han noted that Flight Centre continued to win accounts in its more profitable global corporate travel business, and that it had sufficient liquidity to ride out the pandemic as it continued to “wreak havoc on earnings”.</p>
<p>Flight Centre’s shares were trading $35.54 just before the pandemic, fell to a low of $8.92 in March 2020 and had recovered to $24.42 in October last year. The stock closed at $17.90 on Friday.</p>

<p>The beauty of travel now is that every moment feels like a bonus. Each conversation, adventure and meal feels like it was taken back from a pandemic that has stolen so much – 5 million lives and counting.</p>
<p>Every day I kept coming back to the same thought – imagine if I had not gone?</p>

<div>‘Rocks are falling’: Tourists killed as cliff collapses at popular Brazil spot</div>
<p>Rio de Janeiro: Ten people were killed when the face of a massive cliff collapsed at a popular tourism spot in south-east Brazil, authorities said.</p>
<p>Boaters who narrowly escaped being crushed captured videos of the giant slab falling into Lake Furnas in Minas Gerais state on Saturday (Sunday AEDT). The rock peeled off after days of intense rain in the area.</p>
<p>Another video registered the moment the cliff came crashing down, destroying two small boats.</p>
<p>Ten people were killed and no one remained missing on Sunday afternoon, Marcos Pimenta of the Minas Gerais civil police said.</p>
<p>“Today we are suffering the tragedy of a loss in our state that resulted from strong rain,” Romeu Zema, the state’s Governor, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“He turned the boat around because he said it was better for us to get out of there,” Leite said. “But at that moment the cliff was already falling.”</p>
<p>Lake Furnas, which is near the city of Capitólio, is among a cluster of picturesque destinations popular with tourists during summer in Minas Gerais. Visitors take boats to watch waterfalls that pour into emerald-coloured water.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Pedro Aihara, a spokesperson for the Minas Gerais Fire Department, said at least 24 people survived on the two boats that were directly hit. The search concluded on Monday AEDT with all victims and survivors accounted for.</p>
<p>The videos from the scene went viral in Brazil, where intense rain and flooding in recent weeks have left at least 20 other people dead and 17,000 displaced, and damaged thousands of homes.</p>
<p>Brazil’s navy sent a team to assist rescue workers and said it would open an investigation to establish the causes of the collapse.</p>
<p>The Associated Press spoke to the head of the Applied Geology Division of the Brazilian Geological Service, Tiago Antonelli, who said the cliff wall was subject to centuries of erosion and susceptible to rain, heat and cold.</p>

<div>Heathrow calls for an end to COVID travel tests after millions of flights cancelled</div>
<p>London: The boss of Heathrow Airport has called for the removal of testing for all vaccinated travellers after rules introduced to combat the Omicron variant of coronavirus saw 600,000 flight bookings cancelled in December alone.</p>
<p>The plea coincided with a World Health Organisation (WHO) prediction that by March half of Europe’s population would be infected with the highly transmissible variant that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>Spain also weighed in, calling on Europe to debate whether the time had come to treat COVID-19 like the flu.</p>
<p>Global travel restrictions introduced by governments in an effort to contain the pandemic have seriously hindered the aviation sector.</p>
<p>Heathrow – the UK’s busiest airport – recorded just 19.4 million passenger movements in 2021, even fewer than in the first year of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The figure represents less than one-quarter of the total passenger movements recorded in 2019 – the last year Heathrow operated at normal capacity prior to the virus’ spread from Wuhan in China.</p>
<p>While some governments have reopened their borders, international travel volumes have remained low due to quarantine and testing requirements, in addition to uncertainty caused by travel bans and constantly changing rules.</p>
<p>Heathrow CEO John Holland-Kaye said there was no prospect of the aviation sector recovering for as long as travel restrictions remained in place.</p>
<p>The company called for a “playbook” to be established.</p>
<p>Restrictions introduced around the world in response to the highly contagious Omicron variant saw tens of thousands of flights cancelled over Christmas as soaring case numbers restricted passenger travel and resulted in flight crews isolating.</p>
<p>British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he can see a future where only vaccination status – rather than testing status – is required for international travel.</p>
<p>However, countries that are maintaining strict measures to curb the virus may be slow to follow suit.</p>
<p>France, which on Tuesday recorded more than 368,000 cases in 24 hours, still requires pre-departure and post-arrival tests for passengers from the UK and a host of other countries.</p>
<p>Testing demand from travellers, combined with tough testing protocols in place for schools, have led to lab and pharmacy infrastructure buckling.</p>
<p>While Omicron’s transmissibility has caused cases to skyrocket, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said this week the variant was about 75 per cent less severe.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez called for Europe to debate the way it handles COVID-19, suggesting it was time for governments to consider treating it like the flu.</p>
<p>“It’s a necessary debate – science has given us the answer to protect ourselves,” Sanchez told radio station Cadena Ser.</p>
<p>“We have to evaluate the evolution of COVID from pandemic to an endemic illness.”</p>
<p>WHO regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, warned a “west to east tidal wave” of infections could sweep across Europe by March.</p>
<p>“At this rate, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation forecasts that more than 50 per cent of the population in the region will be infected with Omicron in the next six to eight weeks,” he told a media briefing.</p>
<p>WHO said the world was still “way off” demoting the pandemic to endemic status.</p>
<div>Border opening paused over Omicron variant concerns hours before flights land</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Concerns about the Omicron strain have prompted the federal government to defer the planned reopening of the international border to December 15.</p>
<p>About 200,000 workers and students were expected to start arriving from Wednesday, but top federal ministers reviewed the plan ahead of a national cabinet meeting on Tuesday and decided to delay the reopening.</p>
<p>The federal government released a statement on Monday night confirming the decision and said travellers from Japan and South Korea would also not be allowed in until December 15.</p>
<p>Options to delay the opening of the international border on December 1 were put to the committee before Mr Morrison talked to state and territory leaders in an online meeting of national cabinet on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Members of the national security committee include Mr Morrison, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Defence Minister Peter Dutton and Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne.</p>
<p>The government wanted to open the border on Wednesday to students, skilled workers and a select group of others who have been fully vaccinated, but reassessed the timetable in response to five new cases of the Omicron variant in Australia.</p>
<p>Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Monday that Australia was well prepared for any variants, with nearly 87 per cent of the eligible population aged 16 and up now fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>“We’re not just prepared in terms of our vaccination rates, but we’re prepared in terms of our hospitals. And what we’ll do is we’ll just continue to follow the medical advice,” he said.</p>
<p>So far, the variant appears to be mild, but Mr Hunt said Australia would go further with health measures or border restrictions if necessary.</p>
<p>“We will not hesitate to take additional steps if the medical evidence is that more are required,” he told reporters on Monday morning.</p>
<p>NSW, Victoria and the ACT are working with the federal government as they review whether to extend the 72 hours of home quarantine that all international arrivals are required to undertake.</p>
<p>“They’re reviewing that, and they’re working with us,” Mr Hunt said on Monday afternoon on 2GB radio.</p>
<p>“We certainly wouldn’t rule out the fact that that period may be rolled over. And I think it’s important to provide that guidance.</p>
<p>“My understanding is that they’re certainly considering that. They’re doing it in conjunction with Commonwealth officials.”</p>
<p>National cabinet is meeting at 4.30pm on Tuesday to discuss the rapidly evolving situation with the new variant and current measures in place to reduce its spread in Australia.</p>
<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk expressed concern about the number of international arrivals who were not in hotel quarantine and said she would be seeking answers about it in Tuesday’s meeting.</p>
<p>But NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said Australia should not have a “knee-jerk” reaction to the emerging variant.</p>
<p>“We need to open up to the world, we need to do so safely,” he said on Monday morning.</p>
<p>“But we have a clear direction – vaccinations up, progressively restrictions down. Those directions remain constant,” he said.</p>
<p>“There are still pockets where people are not protected,” Mr Butler said.</p>
<p>The Omicron variant has become the dominant strain in South Africa and led to border closures around the world as cases are detected in Europe, Asia and Australia.</p>
<p>“Some reports out of South Africa are it’s mostly mild, other information we have is the hospitalisation rates are increasing. So we need to get further information there,” he said.</p>
<div>Victoria scraps quarantine for fully vaccinated overseas travellers</div>
<div><div><h5>By Annika Smethurst, Sumeyya Ilanbey and Rachel Eddie</h5><div> <span><time>October 21, 2021 — 7.31pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Victoria will scrap quarantine requirements for double-vaccinated travellers arriving from overseas as early as next month, bringing the country’s two largest states in line.</p>
<p>Two state government sources confirmed Victoria will follow the lead of NSW and no longer expect travellers to isolate either at home or in hotels if they are fully vaccinated and test negative to COVID-19 on arrival.</p>
<p>A senior federal government source confirmed the federal government had been informed of the plans, which are expected to be announced on Friday.</p>
<p>The change is expected to come into effect as soon as November 1, the same day as NSW takes the step.</p>
<p>Last week, NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet surprised the federal government by announcing his state would abandon hotel quarantine for overseas arrivals once 80 per cent of people over 16 had received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>Victoria is expected to have fully vaccinated 80 per cent of people aged over 16 by October 30 or 31.</p>
<p>The change is a further progression from revelations in The Age this week that home quarantine would be trialled.</p>
<p>Passengers booked on a special flight from London to Melbourne arriving at Tullamarine on October 27 will be allowed to isolate at home for seven days instead of being locked in a hotel room for a fortnight.</p>
<p>Under the Victorian trial, returned travellers will be monitored by a phone app with facial recognition and location technology.</p>
<p>The arrangement was originally part of a three-way agreement between the Commonwealth, NSW and Victoria to trial home quarantine before resuming regular international travel.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Premier Daniel Andrews indicated for the first time that quarantine requirements for some returned travellers could soon be dropped.</p>
<p>“Be in no doubt we will have a quarantine system that is as light touch as possible,” he said.</p>
<p>“We will almost certainly be able to do some home-based quarantine for some people [and] no quarantine for others if they are double-dose vaccinated and they have a negative test.”</p>
<p>The Premier’s office did not respond to questions on Thursday night.</p>
<p>The acceleration away from “Fortress Australia” follows a relaxation of the NSW and Victorian border this week.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, fully vaccinated people can travel with a permit from orange and green zones in NSW into Victoria without having to isolate or test negative for COVID-19.</p>
<p>People who are not double-dosed can travel into Victoria but are required to isolate until they return a negative test.</p>
<p>Fully vaccinated Victorians will be allowed to holiday in NSW from November 1.</p>
<p>Currently, anyone who has been in Victoria in the past 14 days must complete a declaration and adhere to lockdown rules while in NSW.</p>
<p>In a statement issued on Thursday night, NSW Health said this requirement would be lifted on November 1 for vaccinated people. From that date, fully vaccinated Victorians will be allowed to enter the state for a holiday or recreation.</p>
<p>Appropriate exemptions would be established for people living in border communities, the statement said.</p>

<div>NSW scraps quarantine but PM puts brakes on international tourists for now</div>

<p>Mr Morrison welcomed NSW’s move but insisted Australian citizens would take precedence before skilled migrants, international students and tourists are welcomed back.</p>
<p>“We’re not opening up to everyone coming back to Australia at the moment, I want to be clear about that,” he said. “We’re going to take this forward in a staged and careful way.”</p>
<p>“Everything all in good time. We’re not rushing into this; we’re taking it carefully step-by-step.”</p>
<p>People who transit through Sydney would still be subject to domestic border rules and restrictions.</p>
<p>Qantas announced it would bring forward its plan to restart international flights by two weeks, to November 1, in response to the NSW announcement.</p>
<p>Australian woman Kelsey May has been operating a Facebook support group for thousands of Australians stranded overseas.“There’s understandable scepticism for many people today,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said he did not think the NSW policy would affect the willingness of other state governments to open borders.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s any justification for that, particularly as we are only extending this to Australian residents, citizens and their immediate families,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m sure all premiers and chief ministers want Australians to be able to come home.”</p>
<p>However, WA Premier Mark McGowan said that NSW’s push to open borders to international arrivals could mean greater spread of the virus in NSW and that strict border arrangement would remain in place for “as long as necessary”.</p>
<p>“It is unfortunate … but it is necessary to protect our state and keep us in the very good condition we are in,” he said.</p>
<p>Queensland Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said the opening of international borders should be an issue for the Commonwealth government and national cabinet.</p>
<p>However, Mr Perrottet said the decision would see NSW reconnect with the rest of the globe as soon as possible, declaring quarantine “a thing of the past” from November 1.</p>
<p>“We’re going to get tourists back as quickly as possible,” he said, acknowledging the decision to open international borders lay with the federal government.</p>
<p>“From a NSW perspective, we’re not going to discriminate. We want people to come back in.”</p>
<p>Under the plan, people who have been double-vaccinated with an approved vaccine will be required to take a COVID-19 test before boarding a flight and show proof of full vaccination.</p>
<p>There will be no caps on fully vaccinated people and no requirements to quarantine. Overseas arrivals who are not fully vaccinated will be capped at 210 a week, and will still need to undergo 14 days’ hotel quarantine.</p>
<p>The NSW government first announced its home quarantine trial in September, saying participants would include residents, non-Australian residents and Qantas aircrew. It would run for four weeks with an option to scale up, if successful.</p>
<p>Tourism Minister Stuart Ayres, who has been responsible for quarantine in NSW, on Friday said while Qantas crew members commenced the program two weeks ago, community participants had started only this week.</p>
<p>“They will be required to regularly sign onto an app that will geolocate their whereabouts and submit to a COVID test on day six and day 14,” a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Mr Ayres said results so far had been critical in convincing the government against rolling out a statewide program, with reluctance to devote state resources to operate a complex monitoring system within a highly vaccinated population.</p>
<p>He said that, while the government will still complete the trial, it did not need to see the full results to know that it could not scale up as required.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister on Friday said he would continue to support home quarantine trials under way in other states and territories.</p>
<p>Under current international arrivals caps, which were lowered during the Delta outbreak, 750 people are allowed to return to NSW each week until the state hits its 80 per cent target.</p>
<p>Those who are double-jabbed will be able to have 20 visitors to their homes from Monday, up from the current limit of 10, and the cap on outdoor gatherings will increase from 30 to 50.</p>
<p>Caps on funerals and weddings will be removed and drinking while standing up will be allowed in hospitality venues.</p>
<p>However, allowing Sydney residents the ability to travel to the regions, originally permitted under the road map when NSW hit the 80 per cent mark, has been delayed until November 1 with vaccination rates in some parts of the state still too low.</p>
<p>Mr Perrottet said discussions were now under way with the federal government about when cruises could start operating again.</p>
<p>The state recorded 399 new local cases of COVID-19 and four deaths on Friday. There are now 677 coronavirus patients in NSW hospitals, with 145 in intensive care.</p>

<div>Australia closes borders to all visitors amid coronavirus pandemic</div>
<div><div><h5>By Anthony Galloway and Eryk Bagshaw</h5><div>Updated <span><time>March 19, 2020 — 4.58pm</time></span><span>first published at <time>4.39pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Australia's borders will close to all foreigners for six months in a drastic bid to stop the spread of the coronavirus with the unprecedented lockdown closing the $45 billion international tourism industry.</p>
<p>More than one million Australians also face being stranded overseas if they do not find a way home within days as airlines including Qantas and Virgin shut down their international operations.</p>
<p>"The reason for this decision is about 80 per cent of the cases we have in Australia are either the result of someone who has contracted the virus overseas or someone who has had direct contact with someone who has returned from overseas," he said.</p>
<p>He said the communication from the Department of Foreign Affairs had been lacking, after calling them “more than 40 times”.</p>
<p>“It’s been bedlam for the last two days out of the airport. The Moroccan government has been overwhelmed,” he said.</p>
<p>The Australian government has said it has no plans for any more assisted departures from overseas like the two Qantas emergency flights it organised earlier this year for Australians stuck in the Chinese province of Hubei.</p>
<p>The government has urged some stranded travellers to consider charter flights costing up to $300,000.</p>
<p>Australian Ambassador to Perú and Bolivia, Diana Nelson, said on social media Australians seeking to depart South America from Lima or Cusco, or from La Paz in Bolivia, should contact a commercial company running expensive charter flights.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said there were "limitations to what can be done" to bring Australians home. He said the government was working with Qantas "to make sure we can keep some flights open so Australians can make their way back".</p>
<p>"There will be Australians in many places around the world who will find themselves finding it a lot harder to get back to Australia than otherwise," he said.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison said the coronavirus has been a matter of public record for several months and many Australians have taken "wise decisions" to get back home sooner.</p>
<p>Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics show more than 60,000 Australians left Australia in January alone. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says there are an estimated one million Australians living and working overseas.</p>
<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Thursday announced New Zealand's borders would close from midnight and said the "extraordinary power" was required to keep the virus out of the country.</p>
<p>The $45 billion Australian international tourism sector will be hammered for the next six months under the new measures. The government is preparing to unveil a wage survival package for the thousands of workers expected to be laid off.</p>
<ul><li>This story has been updated to correct that Tasmania is not barring visitors from the mainland, but does require everyone entering the state to go into 14 days of self-isolation, except for emergency personnel and other essential workers.</li></ul>

<div>The best beach companion is your dog? Depends who is asking</div>
<p>It’s your dog Clancy here, writing from a beach down the coast. Here’s my news: I love it here. I’m thinking of becoming a professional surfer, or at very least a cast member of Bondi Rescue.</p>
<p>He takes a few steps into the water, then lets out a screech every time a tiny wave splashes his leg. There’s much yelping and waving of arms. He even stands on tippy-toes when each wave comes in, just to minimise the incredible pain.</p>
<p>“It’s freezing, impossibly cold,” he says to Lady, yelling over a crowd of tiny children, splashing happily about, oblivious to the apparently life-threatening conditions they are enduring.</p>
<p>Lady rolls her eyes, runs into the water, then gracefully dives beneath an incoming wave. “If anything,” she says once she’s surfaced, “it’s a bit warm”.</p>
<p>I take quiet pleasure in having at least one beach companion who doesn’t invite the derision of the crowd.</p>
<p>The afternoon sails on. We swim and, together, we examine rock pools. I dig a hole then chase a dog who is chasing a ball. I try to eat a bluebottle until Man tells me off. Bathed in the sunshine, we meet many other humans and many other dogs.</p>
<p>All too soon, it’s time to go home.</p>
<p>Back at our “camp”, Man retrieves his car keys from his shoe. “See,” he says to Lady, “I told you this would fool the thieves. It’s such a great method I invented.”</p>
<p>I just know that we’re all going to sleep well tonight.</p>
<p>Hope all is well in the country.</p>

<div>A fiscal and liquidity cliff is looming as policymakers slam on the brakes</div>
<div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>A fiscal and liquidity cliff is looming as policymakers slam on the brakes</h1></div>

<p>A year ago governments and central banks were in the midst of near-unprecedented fiscal expansion and stimulus. Now they are in the early stage of quite dramatic policy U-turns. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>The catalyst for the abrupt shifts in policy stances, of course, are the breakouts of inflation.</p>
<p>It is now contemplating the end of the buying in March and an aggressive winding down of its $US8.8 trillion balance sheet, sucking liquidity out of the US and global financial systems.</p>
<p>To lesser degrees the central banks of the other major developed economies are also considering backing out of their COVID-inspired stimulus programs.</p>
<p>Macquarie Bank research issued last week estimates more than $US2 trillion of central bank liquidity will be withdrawn over the next 18 months. If inflation rates continue to spike it could well be significantly more.</p>
<p>Governments, which responded to the pandemic with fiscal expansions unprecedented in the post-war era, are now winding back their spending rapidly as pandemic relief programs have been allowed to run off.</p>
<p>The spike in interest rates and far lower liquidity levels in prospect would be occurring in a world awash with debt. Even before the pandemic, global debt levels were high but the fiscal relief packages have swollen them further.</p>
<p>According to the Institute of International Finance, global debt was about $US250 trillion, or 320 per cent of global GDP, in 2018. By the September quarter of last year it was almost $US300 trillion, or 350 per cent of global GDP.</p>
<p>That means the finances of governments, businesses and households are now acutely sensitive to changes in interest rates and the availability of money, and it makes monetary policy decisions more difficult and sensitive than they already were.</p>
<p>If the Fed and its peers miscalculate in either direction – if they misread the outlook for inflation – they could do real damage to economies, businesses and individuals.</p>
<p>Until the pandemic and the supply chain disruptions that occurred even as consumer demand soared in developed economies, central banks were more concerned about the absence of inflation than its threat.</p>
<blockquote><p>It is the dawning recognition of the extent to which the Fed is being forced to change tack that has unsettled financial markets that have become addicted to cheap liquidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Worst-case scenarios – the open discussion among Fed officials of four, five or even six rate rises this year and an accelerated shrinkage of the Fed’s balance sheet – aren’t, however, priced in.</p>
<p>It might be, of course, that the supply chain issues bedevilling the global economy and which helped to reignite inflation might be resolved this year.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of fiscal and monetary stimulus ought to slow economic activity. The continuance and evolution of the pandemic will also act as an economic depressant.</p>

<p>Hands up if you play the daily online word guessing game Wordle. On second thoughts, don’t bother; I already <i>know</i> you’ve been playing it - because you post about it every bloody day!</p>
<p>Wordle scores have hijacked my social media feed. Each morning when I log onto Twitter my screen is a sea of mustard, grey and green grids, informing me how many guesses each user took to crack the word.</p>
<p>Stop posting about your Wordles, people. Nobody cares!</p>
<p>Except … apparently, some people do.</p>
<p>When I tweeted that everyone should stop posting their Wordles, I became an internet pariah. I was called a spoilsport, a grinch, the fun police, a thief of joy! I practically got cancelled!</p>
<p>“So just mute Wordle!” dozens of people wrote to me, as if I hadn’t considered that option. (And no, I actually hadn’t considered that option, but that’s not important right now.)</p>
<p>“Just scroll on by!” wrote other people, and yes, I’ll scroll on by. But it still raises the question: Why do people post their Wordle scores? And is anybody actually interested?</p>
<p>I’m still not posting my own Wordle scores online, but perhaps I won’t mute them after all.</p>

<div>Declaring the economy ‘open’ isn’t enough to revive our economic fortunes</div>

<p>Almost two years into the pandemic, even while armoured with vaccinations, the economic logic still stands.</p>
<p>Under a “living with COVID” mindset, we are now seeing what happens when the widespread circulation of the virus infiltrates all corners of the workforce.</p>
<p>While the early stages of the pandemic largely put a break on consumer confidence and the demand side of the economy, it’s now the supply side of the economy crumbling under the pandemic’s impact.</p>
<p>Even if consumers wanted to go out and spend again, the products aren’t there to buy and store staff aren’t there to serve.</p>
<p>It’s further proof that people are the heartbeat of the economy.</p>
<p>Opponents of lockdowns argued that lockdowns would be damaging to mental health. What they were less ready to acknowledge was that the widespread circulation of the virus would trigger anxiety, distress and emotional depletion too.</p>
<p>Obviously, we can’t live in lockdown forever. But this doesn’t mean our only alternative now is to “push through” like we’re on some sort of gritted-teeth adventure trail.</p>
<p>Schools, public spaces and public transport would be fitted with safer air ventilation systems, CO2 devices, and wider entry and exit points. Government could subsidise businesses to refit their premises in similarly innovative ways.</p>
<p>It would provide data-driven guidance to jobseekers on the skills of highest economic need in the future – healthcare, aged care and mental health – and invest in their reskilling and career transitions.</p>

<div>COVID fear and supply famine join to decimate Kmart, Target’s earnings</div>
<div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>COVID fear and supply famine join to decimate Kmart, Target’s earnings</h1></div>
<div><div><div><h5>Elizabeth Knight</h5>Business columnist</div><div> <span><time>January 17, 2022 — 3.31pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Omicron has put the ‘discretion’ back into discretionary retail. Faced with the prospect of playing dodgeball with the virus, consumers are staying away from shops in droves.</p>
<p>One need look no further for proof than Monday’s half-year earnings update from Wesfarmers - the owner of Kmart, Target, Officeworks and Bunnings.</p>
<p>During the early part of the six months period to December, the government-enforced restrictions were responsible for a drop in sales - and investors had already digested this.</p>
<p>But over December and January as physical stores reopened there emerged a new set of challenges - the scarcity of staff and an abundance of consumer fear.</p>
<p>The combination of low customer traffic and the early lockdowns has prompted Wesfarmers to pencil in a 10 per cent drop in sales from discount department store brands Kmart and Target combined for the six months to December 2021.</p>
<p>It has been the perfect storm for retailers - in addition to flagging consumer demand, costs have increased, discounts have been employed to reduce inventory and logistics have become a nightmare.</p>
<p>Managing and paying staff who are isolating is one half of the challenge. Finding staff to man stores and distribution centres is the second arm of a debilitating pincer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, managing inventory during a period where demand is unprecedentedly uncertain is nothing short of a crap shoot.</p>
<p>While Officeworks, Target and Kmart have been hit, Wesfarmers provided limited clarity around the earnings from its flagship Bunnings - saying only that in the half to December its performance was pleasing.</p>
<p>Bunnings has been a beneficiary of the pandemic for the most part as people forced to stay at home spent money and time on DIY projects. Whether the home-renovator set is happy to brave Omicron and visit Bunnings barns remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The degree of investor relief was measured by the Wesfarmers’ share price which was up 2.7 per cent at $55.45 in late afternoon trading compared with the index which was largely flat.</p>
<p>But it is a luxury that most other discretionary retailers don’t have.</p>
<p>(We saw a glimpse last week when Qantas downwardly revised traffic numbers thanks to large numbers of people either in isolation or who are reluctant to play chicken with the virus and board planes.)</p>
<p>It is the reason why business is so closely monitoring predictions from government and health officials on when Omicron will peak.</p>
<p>This will determine whether the second half of the financial year earnings can be rescued. At this stage it’s a prediction no retailer could make.</p>

<p>Amid all the hype surrounding the Novak Djokovic saga, one troubling myth needs to be dispelled: that being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and recovering from COVID-19 provides adequate immunity from the disease, making vaccination unnecessary.</p>
<p>If unvaccinated and recently infected with the virus, the message is still clear: get double vaccinated starting after symptoms have resolved. As protection wanes, Omicron can re-infect, Delta is still out there, and new variants likely to emerge.</p>

<p>WA Premier Mark McGowan has remained firm the state will stick to its February 5 date, despite being just two per cent off reaching its vaccine target and the Omicron variant already spreading in the community.</p>
<p>However, University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said the west would be close, if not already past its “peak immunity” due to a vaccine’s efficacy waning over time.</p>
<p>“There’s no epidemiological reason to hold out for the 5th, at some point you just have to open up, it’s not going to make a lot of difference,” he said.</p>
<p>Between reaching 80 per cent and 88 per cent vaccination rates in WA, a further 347,000 people’s immunity waned, making them due for a booster, while about 400,000 people received their boosters during that same time.</p>
<p>Asked on Monday if WA had reached its immunity peak, or if the state government knew when it was expected to reach its peak, Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said she did not know.</p>
<p>WA has reintroduced masks in public indoor settings, but has so far resisted enforcing gathering restrictions flagged for February 5, including the possibility of the square metre rule and capacity limits returning.</p>
<p>Professor Blakely said while there was little reason from an infectious disease point of view to keep the borders closed, the state government could have other motivations.</p>
<p>His comments come as pressure mounts on Mr McGowan to provide details on the restrictions WA can expect from February 5, and what the isolation requirements for cases and their close contacts will be.</p>
<p>WA also has a shortage of rapid antigen tests, and only recently awarded a GP tele-health contract aimed to assist positive cases with in-home care.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Premier’s office said WA’s plan to open at a 90 per cent vaccination rate was based on health advice and in line with modelling available when the decision was made in mid-December.</p>
<p>“Transition measures will be finalised in the lead up to February 5, when we know more about Omicron and have up-to-date health advice,” she said.</p>
<p>“WA is in the best position because we can watch and learn from the experiences over east and around the world, and ensure when we do transition our border controls, it is done safely and carefully.</p>
<p>“The recommended time, which is set by national immunisation bodies, between second and third [vaccine] doses is now four months, down from five.</p>
<p>“From 31 January, the recommended time between second and third doses will change to only three months.</p>
<p>“Everyone should get vaccinated and this includes third doses when they’re eligible. This will help them protect themselves, their families and community.”</p>

<div>What is the impact of the maritime heatwave?</div>
<p>Earlier this month the world’s oceans recorded their hottest temperatures in more than 60 years.</p>
<p>On one level, that sharp bite of cold when you first go for a dip in the ocean might be easier to cope with; on a grander scale, the impact on marine ecosystems and global weather patterns is profound.</p>
<p>In December, the ocean off sydney peaked more than 3 degrees above average, and temperatures remain above average in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
