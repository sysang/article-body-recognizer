<p>There’s an air of confidence from co-trainer Mitchell Kearney that consistent gelding Carlisle Bay has found the right race at Newcastle on Wednesday to improve on his winning record.</p>
<p>But there’s just one variable he can’t control, and that’s how the four-year-old leaves the gates, which will be vital to his chances in the TAB Long May We Play Handicap (1500m).</p>
<p>“I think if he jumps [well], he should win,” Kearney said.</p>
<p>“He’s had a few issues jumping, sometimes he’ll jump perfectly and sometimes he’ll fall out.”</p>
<p>Carlisle Bay has won two of his 14 starts and broke through with an all-the-way second-up win over 1300m at Scone on December 21 where he jumped with them then did some work to find the lead.</p>
<p>“We just wanted to see where he was at, ” he said.</p>
<p>“I thought the tempo wasn’t the best for him, they didn’t go as hard as they could have and made it a sit and sprint for him to the line.</p>
<p>“He’s a high cruising-speed horse and keeps going that same speed at the end.”</p>
<p>Some rain forecast for Wednesday doesn’t faze Kearney as Carlisle Bay has five placings from eight starts on soft and heavy tracks including his first-up half-length third on a heavy 10 at Wyong.</p>
<p>The four-year-old rises 8kg for the class drop to a provincial Benchmark 64, but Kearney said Josh Parr’s booking is a plus given his prowess with on-pace horses.</p>
<p>“He rates them pretty well. Our plan for Josh would be to lead or sit up outside the lead,″⁣ he said.</p>
<p>Of the others in Mitchell and Desiree Kearney’s Hawkesbury team, in-form front-running sprinter Heza Gentleman is enjoying a break after a hat-trick of Canterbury wins in November and December.</p>
<p>Last start Newcastle maiden winner Lady Shenanigans heads to Kembla on Saturday and Kearney feels eight-year-old Spin Bowles is close to a win after three runs back and is looking for some rain ahead of Canterbury on Friday night.</p>

<div>Blackstone swoops on $925m office as leases show signs of comeback</div>
<p>Private equity giant Blackstone has swooped on a half share in the Sydney Grosvenor Place tower, paying $925 million and giving heart to office property investors that the sector is coming back to life.</p>
<p>The ATO has signed up 13,000 square metres across nine floors over a 10-year term, taking the tower to 99 per cent occupancy. It is undergoing a $70 million refurbishment to include wellness features in the post COVID-19 work environment.</p>
<p>AMP Capital global head of real estate Kylie O’Connor said the Sydney ATO lease is another indication of the “overstated impact of work from home flexibility on high-quality office spaces”.</p>
<p>“Based on previous market cycles, Sydney and Melbourne CBDs recorded an average increase in occupied space of 5.6 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively over the two years following a major downturn,” she said.</p>
<blockquote><p>We are expecting the office to bounce back strongly post this latest lockdown</p><cite>AMP Capital global head of real estate Kylie O’Connor</cite></blockquote>
<p>“We are expecting the office to bounce back strongly post this latest lockdown.”</p>
<p>Blackstone had been an underbidder for the landmark tower and settled on the deal late on Thursday. It comes as the acquisitive private equity group is also bidding for James Packer’s Crown resorts.</p>
<p>Amid the capital injection into the hard-hit office sector are a swathe of new leasing deals.</p>
<p>In Melbourne, a Flinders Street office tower occupied by Victoria University has sold to a joint-venture partnership for $80.8 million.</p>
<p>The building was offloaded by Singapore-listed entity Hotel Grand Central in a deal negotiated by Colliers International’s Oliver Hay and Matt Stagg.</p>
<p>The transaction was the second in a month for Marprop after it signed a $315 million agreement in October to buy the Sofitel Sydney Wentworth Hotel, the city’s largest single hotel transaction since 2015.</p>
<p>The Officeworks lease at Chadstone will cover 8000 square metres and will take the tower to full occupancy.</p>
<p>Vicinity chief development officer Carolyn Viney said Officeworks adds to the growing list of corporates setting up office at Chadstone.</p>
<p>“Demand for office space outside Melbourne’s CBD remains high with the ‘work near home’ model proving popular as employers and employees look for locations that deliver the best in work-life balance,” she said.</p>
<p>Rob Joyes, national director of Colliers represented Vicinity and Tim Farley, national director of Colliers Tenant Advisory, advised Officeworks on the lease.</p>
<p>The lease deals are supported by the latest Office Occupancy survey by the Property Council of Australia, which showed that the number of Sydneysiders working in the office tripled last month.</p>
<p>Property Council’s NSW executive director Luke Achterstraat said the survey revealed positive signs for Sydney’s CBD with the office occupancy levels increasing from 8 per cent to 23 per cent in November.</p>
<p>“With lockdown restrictions lifting, and a festive summer ahead, there is optimism that these numbers will continue to rise and our economic recovery will remain strong,” Mr Achterstraat said.</p>
<p>Melbourne’s office occupancy jumped from 4 per cent to 12 per cent, the survey revealed.</p>
<p>Property Council of Australia chief executive Ken Morrison said that while the increases were coming off lockdown lows, the figures were heartening.</p>
<p>“We know COVID-19 and successive lockdowns left our major CBDs deserted, so it’s good news, even at this traditionally slower time of year, that people are heading back to their places of work,” Mr Morrison said.</p>
