<p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Filip Forsberg scored twice, Juuse Saros made 41 saves and the Nashville Predators beat the Vegas Golden Knights 3-2 on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Yakov Trenin also scored for Nashville, which extended its current run to 9-1-1. The victory moved the Predators past St. Louis into first place in the Central Division with 44 points.</p>
<p>The Predators’ 11-game run spans an extended holiday break that saw the team miss four postponed games due to COVID issues. Since returning, Nashville is 2-1-1, having won two in a row.</p>
<p>Hynes credited the players’ work ethic in practice and in the film room to getting back on track, diligence that has paid off in opening a three-game road trip with a win in one of the toughest NHL arenas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Vegas’ offense, which produced 13 goals in the previous three games, mustered only two goals late in the third, making the game interesting, but it wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>The Golden Knights, on a 10-3-1 run, lost their second straight at home after falling to Winnipeg on Sunday. Despite both losses, Vegas still leads the Pacific Division — and Western Conference — with 45 points.</p>
<p>William Karlsson and Shea Theodore scored for the Golden Knights. Logan Thompson made his first career start and stopped 23 shots for Vegas.</p>
<p>After a scoreless first period in which Thompson was put to the test, with the Predators outshooting Vegas 10-8, Nashville opened a 2-0 lead in the second. </p>
<p>Forsberg, who’s been on a tear, received Mikael Granlund’s pass as he skated into the zone and beat Thompson under his arm on the far side early in the second.</p>

<li><div><a><h4>Columbus takes on New Jersey for conference showdown</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Panarin and New York take on Vegas</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Trenin, playing in his 100th career NHL game, made it 2-0 later in the period, redirecting Philippe Myers’ shot from the point.</p>
<p>Forsberg scored his second goal of the game and sixth in six games when he blocked a shot, skated into the zone and used a slick move by stopping quickly in front of Thompson and backhanding the puck into the net to make it 3-0.</p>
<p>Vegas tried to take advantage of a 4-on-3 power play by pulling Thompson midway through the third for a 5-on-3 edge, but couldn’t capitalize as Saros continued his splendid play.</p>
<p>The Golden Knights finally got to Saros in the third, cutting Nashville’s lead to two when defenseman Brayden McNabb’s centering feed was knocked home by Karlsson with eight minutes left in the game.</p>
<p>Theodore took advantage of a screen in front of Saros and fired a shot that made it a one-goal game with 1:46 to play.</p>
<p>Despite the loss, Thompson was excited after making a valiant effort in front of an announced gathering of 17,804, while starter Robin Lehner and usual backup Laurent Brossoit were both scratched with injuries.</p>
<p>It was Thompson’s second NHL appearance, after playing 8:15 in relief of Marc-Andre Fleury on March 10.</p>

<div><div><h1>Terry gets 1st NHL hat trick as Ducks defeat Flyers 4-1</h1></div><div>By JOE REEDYJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<div><div>Anaheim Ducks right wing Troy Terry (19) reacts after scoring during the first period of an NHL hockey game against the Philadelphia Flyers in Anaheim, Calif., Tuesday, Jan. 4, 2022. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)</div></div>
<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) — Troy Terry added to a breakout season as he scored his first NHL hat trick Tuesday night in the Anaheim Ducks’ 4-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers.</p>
<p>“I had the puck a lot more against Colorado (on Sunday). Some scoring chances didn’t go my way the last game but they did tonight,” Terry said. </p>
<p>Sonny Milano also scored and Jamie Drysdale had two assists for Anaheim, which snapped a two-game skid. John Gibson stopped 28 shots. </p>
<p>Cam Atkinson scored Philadelphia’s goal and Carter Hart made 29 saves. </p>
<p>The Flyers have dropped two in a row after collecting points in seven straight games. They were without leading scorer Claude Giroux and defenseman Ivan Provorov after they were placed in the NHL’s COVID-19 protocols.</p>
<p>“Those are quality players but you have to adjust,” interim coach Mike Yeo said. “We had a number of opportunities, just missed the side of the net. We tried to be aggressive and didn’t get goals.”</p>
<p>Anaheim was also down a couple of key players due to COVID-19. Ducks captain Ryan Getzlaf missed his second game and rookie Trevor Zegras has been out the past three.</p>
<p>Hampus Lindholm fired a shot from the top of the left circle that was tipped in by Terry at 3:21 of the first period. It was originally ruled no goal after the puck hit the near post, but a replay review determined it crossed the goal line.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Minnesota faces Boston on 5-game skid</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Florida visits Dallas after Hornqvist's 2-goal game</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Columbus takes on New Jersey for conference showdown</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Panarin and New York take on Vegas</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Six minutes later, Terry got the puck in the neutral zone, put a nifty move on Flyers defenseman Travis Sanheim and flipped in a shot on the breakaway.</p>
<p>It was Terry’s 20th goal of the season in 35 games, making him the second-fastest Ducks player to reach that number. Corey Perry did it in 33 games in 2013-14. </p>
<p>Atkinson brought the Flyers to 2-1 with 1:18 remaining in the first on a redirect of Joel Farabee’s pass. Atkinson has 13 goals this season, but it was his first since he had a hat trick against New Jersey on Dec. 14.</p>
<p>Milano scored Anaheim’s sixth power-play goal in his last six games with 2:11 left in the second period when he took Sam Steel’s pass and put it into the short side after Hart was out of position.</p>

<div><div><h1>How will pandemic end? Omicron clouds forecasts for endgame</h1></div><div>By LAURAN NEERGAARD and CARLA K. JOHNSONJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Pandemics do eventually end, even if omicron is complicating the question of when this one will. But it won’t be like flipping a light switch: The world will have to learn to coexist with a virus that’s not going away.</p>
<p>The ultra-contagious omicron mutant is pushing cases to all-time highs and causing chaos as an exhausted world struggles, again, to stem the spread. But this time, we’re not starting from scratch.</p>
<a>next mutant </a> to emerge, too.
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Israel sets COVID-19 record amid zigzag policy and 4th jab</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The newest variant is a warning about what will continue to happen “unless we really get serious about the endgame,” said Dr. Albert Ko, an infectious disease specialist at the Yale School of Public Health.</p>
<p>“Certainly COVID will be with us forever,” Ko added. “We’re never going to be able to eradicate or eliminate COVID, so we have to identify our goals.”</p>
<p>Even when that happens, some parts of the world still will struggle — especially low-income countries that lack enough vaccines or treatments — while others more easily transition to what scientists call an “endemic” state.</p>
<p>They’re fuzzy distinctions, said infectious disease expert Stephen Kissler of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He defines the endemic period as reaching “some sort of acceptable steady state” to deal with COVID-19. </p>
<p>The omicron crisis shows we’re not there yet but “I do think we will reach a point where SARS-CoV-2 is endemic much like flu is endemic,” he said.</p>
<p>For comparison, COVID-19 has killed more than 800,000 Americans in two years while flu typically kills between 12,000 and 52,000 a year.</p>
<p>Exactly how much continuing COVID-19 illness and death the world will put up with is largely a social question, not a scientific one.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to get to a point where it’s 2019 again,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “We’ve got to get people to think about risk tolerance.”</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, is looking ahead to controlling the virus in a way “that does not disrupt society, that does not disrupt the economy.”</p>
<p>Ellebedy said baseline population immunity has improved so much that even as breakthrough infections inevitably continue, there will be a drop in severe illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths — regardless of the next variant.</p>
<p>“We are not the same population that we were in December of 2019,” he said. “It’s different ground now.”</p>
<p>Think of a wildfire tearing through a forest after a drought, he said. That was 2020. Now, even with omicron, “it’s not completely dry land,” but wet enough “that made the fire harder to spread.”</p>
<p>He foresees a day when someone gets a coronavirus infection, stays home two to three days “and then you move on. That hopefully will be the endgame.”</p>
