<p>There are live Polyjuice Potion transformations, characters that vanish into thin air, and more fire and flying wands than you can shake a broomstick at. Oh, and a stage that, at one point, appears submerged in water.</p>
<p>“I had a fear you might ask me this question,” says Harrison, as affable and effusive in person as a Labrador puppy. “Because obviously I can’t tell you anything…”</p>
<p>To what extent does he rely on the technical side of theatre? How much of what we see in The Cursed Child is, for example, a trick of the light? “A huge amount. I work in collaboration with the production team all the time.”</p>
<p>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child opens at the Palace Theatre, London W1, on Oct 14</p>

<p>Who knows where Rihanna first saw a piece of the Haas Brothers' work. At Donatella Versace’s place in Milan perhaps. Or Tobey Maguire’s LA mansion? </p>
<p>But see it she did. Earlier this year, Ms Fenty asked the twins to design a base for her 504-page book, to be published by Phaidon in the UK later this month. </p>
<p>“I love anything finely crafted. I think the spirit of the maker gets locked in to the object and the care and time taken to create it give inherent value and psychic weight,” says Simon. </p>
<p>They have also started a similar project in northern California, bringing skills and employment to a former agricultural region that offers very few opportunities to women. </p>
<p>The luxury Supreme Edition is signed and numbered and comes with a black resin stand with gold-frilled edges (£5,175). </p>
<p>Rihanna is published by Phaidon on 24 October</p>

<header> <h1> The glorious history of Ricky Gervais's Golden Globes insults </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Ed Power <time> 28 February 2021 • 7:04pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The sound of dropping jaws was deafening as Ricky Gervais stood behind the podium at the 2011 <a>Golden Globes</a> and let fly. “I Love You Phillip Morris: two heterosexual actors pretending to be gay," he began.</p>
<p>"So the complete opposite of some famous Scientologists, then. Probably. My lawyers helped me with the wording of that joke.” </p>
<p>This was Gervais’s second stint hosting the Globes – to his deep shock he’d been invited back after an equally acidic innings the previous year – and he was clearly in no mood to take prisoners.</p>
<a>Bruce Willis </a>(whom he once introduced as “Ashton Kutcher’s dad”). 
<p>“I’ve got to bite the hand that feeds me," Gervais would explain later on. ”I’d rather people laugh than gasp. But if they gasp, that's good, too.”</p>
<p>Just as tellingly Gervais was prepared to take on sacred cows who in the #MeToo era have become fair game but just a few years ago were regarded as untouchable – certainly un-mockable.</p>
<p>Gervais had a take on the uproar too: "I probably won't be here next year,” he told USA Today. Yet would be asked back on three further occasions – suggesting that, for all the outrage, the HFPA understood his worth. </p>
<p>“People get offended when they mistake the subject of a joke for the actual target and they’re not necessarily the same.”</p>
<p>As he has since confirmed, he didn’t care whose surgically-altered nose he left out of joint. Contrast his twinkling cruelty with the toxic cuddliness of Jimmy Fallon, the unspeakably upbeat talk show host who succeeded him in 2017. </p>
<p>But therein lies the genius of Gervais’s hosting. He’s not up there as a member of the Hollywood elite. He’s one of us – gazing half in awe, half in horror at the assembled great and good.</p>
<h3>Ricky Gervais's harshest Golden Globes insults</h3>
<p>“I like a drink as much as the next man. Unless the next man is Mel Gibson.”</p>
<p><b>2. On the audience</b></p>
<p>“Looking at all the wonderful faces here today reminds me of the great work that’s been done this year – by cosmetic surgeons.”</p>
<p><b>3. On Angelina Jolie</b></p>
<a>Angelina Jolie</a> and you’d think, ‘Mummy!’”
<p>“One thing that can’t be bought is a Golden Globe… officially. But if you were to buy one, the man to see would be [HFPA head] Philip Berk.”</p>
<p><b>5. On Colin Farrell</b></p>
<p><b>6. On Mel Gibson, again</b></p>
<p>"Our first presenter is beautiful, talented… and Jewish, apparently. Mel Gibson told me that. He's obsessed."</p>
<p><b>7. On Scientology</b></p>
<p>“I Love You Phillip Morris: two heterosexual actors pretending to be gay – so the complete opposite of some famous Scientologists, then. Probably. My lawyers helped me with the wording of that joke.”</p>
<p><b>8. On <a>Charlie Sheen</a></b></p>
<p><i>(Gervais refers to a 2010 incident in which police were called to a hotel-room where Sheen was staying with adult actress Christina Walsh)</i></p>
<div> <div> <p><b>9. On Sex and the City 2</b></p> </div> </div>
<p>There were a lot of big films that didn’t get nominated this year… nothing for Sex and the City 2. I was sure the Golden Globe for special effects would go to the team that airbrushed that poster.”</p>
<p><b>10. On The Tourist</b></p>
<p><b>11. On Robert Downey Jr</b></p>
<p>"Many of you in this room probably know him best from such facilities as the Betty Ford Clinic and Los Angeles County Jail..."</p>
<p><b>12</b>. <b>On the HFPA</b></p>
<p> “Next up, Eva Longoria has the daunting task of introducing the President of the Hollywood Foreign Press. That’s nothing. I had to help him off the toilet and pop his teeth back in.”</p>
<p><b>13. On Hugh Hefner</b></p>
<p>“It seems like everything this year was three-dimensional, except the characters in The Tourist.”</p>
<p><b>15. On the Golden Globes</b></p>
<p>“The Golden Globes are just like the Oscars, but without all that… esteem. The Golden Globes are to the Oscars what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton. Bit louder, bit trashier, bit drunker, and more easily bought.”</p>
<p><b>16. On Boardwalk Empire</b></p>
<p><b>17. On Justin Bieber</b></p>
<p>“Justin Bieber nearly had to take a paternity test. What a waste of a test that would have been… the only way he could have impregnated a girl is if he borrowed one of Martha Stewart’s old turkey basters."</p>
<p><b>18. On Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas</b></p>
<p>“They’re ridiculously gorgeous specimens; they’re extremely talented, and probably very interesting. I’m not sure, because I can’t understand a f---ing word they’re saying.”</p>
<p><b>19. On Colin Firth</b></p>
<p>"What you don't know about <a>Colin Firth</a> is he's very racist. I mean, really nasty stuff. I've also seen him punch a little blind kitten. Please welcome the evil Colin Firth.”</p>
<p>(Gervais is referring to a fatal car crash involving Jenner in 2015)</p>
<p>"He's the only person Ben Affleck hasn't been unfaithful to."</p>
<p>22. On Mel Gibson, and Bill Cosby</p>
<p>"I want to say something nice about Mel before he comes out. I’d rather have a drink with him in his hotel room, than with Bill Cosby."</p>
<p>"Joy and Trainwreck, no not the names of Charlie Sheen's two favourite hookers... the films of our next two presenters."</p>
<p>26. On pay Hollywood disparity</p>
<p>"I'm getting paid the same as Amy and Tina [did last year]. I can't help it if they want to share"</p>
<p>"Lucky for me, the Hollywood Foreign Press can barely speak English. And they've got no idea about Twitter. They invited me by fax." </p>
<p>"Lots of icons here tonight: Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Baby Yoda. Oh no, that's Joe Pesci." </p>
<p>28. On the Catholic Church</p>
<p>"It was a big year for paedophile movies: Surviving R Kelly, Leaving Neverland, The Two Popes." </p>
<p>29. On Jeffery Epistein </p>
<p>"In the end, he obviously didn't kill himself. Just like Jeffery Epistein. I know he's your friend, but I don't care."</p>
<p>30. On Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</p>
<p>"It's nearly three hours long. Leonardo DiCaprio attended the premiere, and by the end his date was too old for him."</p>
<p>"The world got to see James Corden as a fat pussy. He was also in the movie Cats, but no one saw that."</p>

<p>Classy? Unembarrassing?! It has clearly taken much fretting about their long-deserved reputation for the HFPA to have devised such dutiful lists of who’s likely to get an Oscar nomination, and even a handful of names who richly deserve one.</p>
<h2>The Golden Globes 2022 nominations</h2>
<h1> Silent Night, review: Keira Knightley stars in quite possibly the bleakest Christmas film ever made </h1>
<p> It begins as a traditional chamber piece, but a plot about the apocalypse makes for a very odd drama indeed </p>
<div> <div> By Robbie Collin, Film Critic <time> 2 December 2021 • 3:55pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>All is calm, all is bright at the picturesque country house where Nell (Keira Knightley) has summoned her siblings and their partners for a seasonal get-together. The roast is in the oven, the bubbly in the fridge, the Bublé on the airwaves.</p>
<p>15 Cert, 90 min. Dir: Camille Griffin. Starring: Keira Knightley, Matthew Goode, Roman Griffin-Davis, Annabelle Wallis, Lucy Punch, Kirby Howell-Baptiste, Lily-Rose Depp, Sope Dirisu, Rufus Jones, Davida McKenzie. </p>

<h1> The Hand of God, review: a wistful, winking cinematic scrapbook of growing up in 1980s Naples </h1>
<p> Paolo Sorrentino's film follows a teenager as he soaks up sights of his home city - just as the director himself did </p>
<div> <div> By Robbie Collin, Chief Film Critic <time> 3 December 2021 • 9:44am </time> </div> </div>
<p>15 cert, 130 min. Dir: Paolo Sorrentino. In cinemas now, and on Netflix from December 15</p>
<header> <h1> The tears to save Alec Baldwin’s career </h1> <p> The actor's emotional interview following the shooting of Halyna Hutchins could help determine whether we accept him back on our screens </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Robbie Collin, Film Critic <time> 3 December 2021 • 5:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>“I would go to any lengths to undo what happened,” he said, before repeating the line for emphasis – a seasoned performer’s instinctive second take.</p>
<p>Later still, Stephanopoulos asked Baldwin if he believed his career was over as a result of the incident: Baldwin replied that it could be. “I couldn’t give a sh-- about my career anymore,” he said.</p>
<p>Could the ABC interview be the first step in feeling out a new screen persona, and might it succeed? It’s hard to say, since little in recent Hollywood history is remotely comparable to Baldwin’s plight. </p>

<p> Kidman never quite convinces as US national treasure Lucille Ball, while Aaron Sorkin's drama overall is smart but not much else </p>

<p>It was the day before recess, and all through the House, not a creature was stirring except… a Chamber full of garrulous MPs. </p>
<p>“<a>Without Labour votes last night</a>, vital public health measures wouldn’t have got through,” he crowed.</p>
<p>“They vacillate, we vaccinate! They jabber, we jab. They play party politics,” blathered the Prime Minister at top-speed, gesturing at the opposition, “and we…” </p>
<p>“Get on with the job!” he roared.</p>
<a>Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian border</a>, was the Government choosing now to cut down Foreign Office staff by 10 per cent, asked an exasperated Tom Tugendhat? The Prime Minister dodged the tanks to swank about the UK overseas aid spend.

<h1> Is the extraterrestrial Chris Whitty writing his own policy on omicron? The truth is out there... </h1>
<p> Even as Tory rebels line up to give him a bashing, the Chief medical officer beams in to offer his latest, uniquely charming Covid warnings </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Madeline Grant <div>PARLIAMENTARY SKETCHWRITER</div> <time> 16 December 2021 • 6:15pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Jeremy Hunt, chairman of the committee wanted to know about his frenetic round of upcoming Christmas parties – sorry, the national interest.</p>
<p>“I’m still trying to <a>avoid making people’s choices for them</a>,” the chief medical officer enunciated primly.</p>
<p>In the committee room, things remained overwhelmingly collegiate – they good-naturedly discussed everything from care homes to <a>booster jabs</a>, occasionally stopping to applaud each other’s expertise. </p>
<p>“I understand the chair knows this well,” Prof Whitty would say. </p>
<p>“Thanks Dr Evans, you’ve touched on one of the really key things there,” said Thomas Waite to the MP for Hinckley and Bosworth, a chisel-jawed former GP.</p>
<p>At one point, Dean Russell triggered the chief medical officer's wrath by asking about the risk of prioritising Covid over other issues. </p>
<p>In the Commons Chamber, however, it proved a Tale of Two Whitties, as Tory rebels lined up to bash not just the Government, but the experts themselves. </p>
<p>"Advisers," stressed Greg Smith, the Buckingham MP, meaningfully, "pressed the panic button way beyond what this house voted for a couple of days ago."</p>
<p>"At a stroke the CMO changed government policy and put this country, certainly hospitality, into effective lockdown!” fumed Steve Brine, a former health minister.</p>
<p>Back in the wonkish confines of the Grimond Room, however, the chairman was asking what - if anything - might trigger a reappraisal of the situation. </p>
