<h1> Duke of Cambridge: I was frustrated we could not get more refugees out of Afghanistan </h1>
<p> Prince William reportedly told refugees that he wished more could have come to the UK, as many face ‘appalling’ delays for permanent homes </p>
<div> <div> By Martin Evans, Crime Correspondent <time> 3 January 2022 • 6:56pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duke of Cambridge has reportedly told Afghan refugees of his frustration at the way the UK handled the evacuation of men, women and children fleeing the Taliban.</p>
<p>The Duke is also understood to have expressed concern at the <a>length of time it has taken to find permanent accommodation</a> for those who have settled in Britain.</p>
<p>His comments were reportedly made last month during a private conversation with a group of refugees he met at a hotel, where they are being temporarily housed.</p>
<p>One of the refugees that the Duke met during his visit told The Times: “He said he was frustrated at the withdrawal effort in August. He said he wished we could have brought more people to the UK.”</p>
<p>Another refugee said: “He asked us: ‘Why is it taking so long to get into permanent homes?’”</p>
<p><a>The Duke</a> also told the refugees that they “couldn’t be more welcome” in the UK.</p>
<p>Kensington Palace refused to comment on the report.</p>
<p>Approximately 15,000 Afghans were evacuated to the UK in August following the withdrawal of US forces and the <a>rapid takeover by the Taliban</a>.</p>
<p>But it is thought as many as 12,000 are still being housed in temporary accommodation in hotels across the country.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, The Telegraph revealed that Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, was coming under mounting pressure to address the <a>“appalling” delays in resettling the refugees</a>.</p>
<h2>Afghan refugees’ ‘appalling’ wait for accommodation</h2>
<p>It is understood that as many as 4,000 of those who have not been found permanent homes are children. The Home Office is facing an angry backlash from MPs over the situation.</p>
<p>At the weekend Victoria Atkins, the minister for Afghan resettlement, suggested that some councils had failed to do enough.</p>
<h2>Government pledges to give thousands of people ‘a new life in the UK’</h2>
<p>A government spokesman said: “We helped over 15,000 people to safety from Afghanistan, and are proud to have provided homes for more than 4,000 Afghan evacuees, with over 300 local authorities pledging their support so far.</p>
<p>“The UK is taking a leading role in the international response to supporting at-risk Afghan citizens.”</p>
<header> <h1> How Prince Philip saved the world’s rarest marsupial from extinction ... without even trying </h1> <p> The population of Gilbert’s potoroo, a scarcely seen rat-kangaroo, is now believed to have passed 100 </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 3 January 2022 • 8:16pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Prince Philip saved a rat-kangaroo from extinction by securing an Australian wildlife sanctuary 60 years ago.</p>
<p>The population of Gilbert’s potoroo, the world’s rarest marsupial, is now believed to have passed 100, making scientists confident that the animal has fought off extinction after it first vanished in the 1870s.</p>
<p>Researchers are grateful that the Duke of Edinburgh successfully lobbied against the destruction of remote bushland in Western Australia which, unbeknown to anyone, contained potoroos.</p>
<p>The Duke had been trying to save an Australian bird on a visit to Perth in 1962, urging that its small coastal habitat should be spared from a new housing development.</p>
<p>The Western Australian government eventually agreed, declaring the area 260 miles south of Perth a wildlife sanctuary.</p>
<p>Thirty years later, in 1994, the bush was found to be home to a Gilbert’s potoroo.</p>
<p>It was discovered by Dr Elizabeth Sinclair, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Western Australia, who was in shock when she saw the animal.</p>
<p>“This is the most researched nature reserve in Western Australia. Surely they haven’t been sitting here under someone’s nose for, you know, for 120 years,” said Dr Sinclair.</p>

<h1> Prince Andrew ‘not entitled’ to bring up accuser’s $500k Jeffrey Epstein deal in court </h1>
<p> Judge hears Duke of York’s argument to end civil case, but his comments do not appear to bode well for Prince’s hopes of avoiding a trial </p>
<div> <div> By Victoria Ward <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:26pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duke of York is “not entitled” to invoke a settlement deal made between his accuser and Jeffrey Epstein, a judge suggested on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 12-page document was unsealed on Monday and revealed the terms of a $500,000 (£370,000) deal that the convicted sex offender made with Virginia Roberts Giuffre in 2009.</p>
<p>The agreement is at the heart of <a>the Duke’s</a> bid to have a sexual abuse lawsuit filed against him by Ms Giuffre thrown out.</p>
<p>Judge Lewis Kaplan heard arguments on the Duke's motion during a 75-minute remote court hearing in New York on Tuesday, but made his reservations clear.</p>
<p>He said his decision would be made “pretty soon”, but friends of the Duke admitted privately that they were not optimistic.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre sued the Duke for unspecified damages last year, alleging that he sexually assaulted her on three separate occasions in 2001, when she was 17.</p>
<p><a>Andrew Brettler</a>, the Duke’s lawyer, said that the “unambiguous terms” of the settlement deal protected him from litigation as a “potential defendant”.</p>
<p>“<a>Miss Giuffre</a> intended to release a broad category of individuals, including royalty, including businessmen,” he said.</p>
<p>“She waived her rights to sue them when she entered into the 2009 release agreement and accepted the money from Mr Epstein. She didn’t return that money when she decided to file this lawsuit.”</p>
<p>However, the judge said that as the terms of the deal were meant to remain secret, they could not be enforced by anyone else.</p>
<p>“The only people who could enforce it were Epstein and Giuffre.”</p>
<p>He said it would have been “easy” to include a clause shielding specific individuals from litigation had that been the intention, but suggested that the very terms of the settlement precluded “use by a third party”. </p>
<p><a>The Duke</a>, therefore, fell “within the category of people who are not entitled to use the terms of the settlement”, he added.</p>
<p>The judge noted that only Epstein, who took his own life in a New York prison in August 2019, could have explained how broad a release he had wanted and exactly what he meant by a “potential defendant”.</p>
<p>His comments do not bode well for the Duke, whose hopes of avoiding a trial currently rest on the motion.</p>
<p>Legal experts said it appeared “unlikely” that the judge would find in his favour.</p>
<p>An attempt to force Ms Giuffre to provide more specific detail about her allegations was also rejected.</p>
<p>Mr Brettler said that she had failed to give a date, a time, a location or a description of “what supposedly happened to her at the hands of Prince Andrew”.</p>
<h2>‘That’s a dog that’s not going to hunt here’</h2>
<p>He added: “With all due respect, Mr Brettler, that’s a dog that’s not going to hunt here. She has no obligation to do that in the complaint, I’ll tell you that straight out now. Not going to happen.”</p>
<p>He said that the Duke would have “every right” to that information as part of the discovery process.</p>
<p>Mr Brettler also said it was “inherently unfair and unjust” for Ms Giuffre to wait so long to sue, subjecting the Duke to the “huge burden” of finding witnesses and documents to defend against her decades-old claims.</p>
<p>David Boies, for Ms Giuffre, argued that the Duke was not covered by the 2009 release because he was not subject to Florida jurisdiction and was not accused of trafficking, as per the original lawsuit.</p>
<p>“He was somebody to whom the girls were trafficked,” he alleged.</p>
<p>The Duke has vehemently denied the claims.</p>
<h1> Girls in Pearls and domestic violence: Duchess of Cornwall adds true grit to Country Life </h1>
<p> Duchess to guest edit July edition of magazine to raise awarness of ‘difficult issues’ facing women in the countryside </p>
<div> <div> By Hannah Furness, Royal Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>It has been known for 125 years for its coverage of dogs, horses, art and landscape, not to mention its cherished Girls in Pearls.</p>
<p>The Duchess is to edit the magazine in July in honour of her 75th birthday, following in the footsteps of her husband, the Prince of Wales, who has taken the role twice.</p>
<p>The magazine said that the special edition would “reflect The Duchess’s love of horses and dogs”, revealing her “champions of the countryside, her most cherished view and favourite recipe”.</p>
<p>However, a royal source said, she also hoped to shine a light on the more “confronting” issues potentially faced by readers, <a>particularly for women</a>.</p>
<p>The issue will include articles about her key charities, including those tackling loneliness, <a>domestic violence</a> and literacy.</p>
<p>“She loves the country life, but it won’t be just horses and dogs and lovely countryside,” said a source of the Duchess’s plans for the issue.</p>
<p>“There is that slightly confronting side of the difficult issues the countryside faces. She wants to have a bit more about the challenges facing people, <a>particularly for women</a>.”</p>
<p>The Duchess will be the third royal guest editor of the magazine. She follows the Prince of Wales, who edited Country Life to mark his 65th birthday in November 2013 and his 70th in 2018. The latter became the biggest-selling issue of all time.</p>
<p>In 2020, the Princess Royal oversaw a best-selling issue to commemorate her 70th birthday. </p>
<p>Each used its pages to make the case for some of their most strongly held views, from organic farming to the importance of hedgerows to the personal mantra of “waste not, want not”.</p>
<h2>Highlighting charity work</h2>
<p>The Duchess is expected to celebrate her love of animals and cooking in the commemorative issue. She is the owner of two Jack Russell terriers, Beth and Bluebell, and is a patron of Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.</p>
<p>“The edition will also focus on the work of the Duchess as patron of over 90 charities, from Barnardo’s to The Royal School of Needlework and The Royal Society of Literature,” a spokeswoman for the Duchess said.</p>
<p>Tom Parker Bowles, the Duchess’s son and a food writer for the magazine, joked that he hoped his new boss would not be too heavy handed in her edits to his articles.</p>
<p>“As a columnist for Country Life, I’m delighted my mother will be guest editing a special issue,” he said. “But rather hoping she won’t try to muck about with my copy.”</p>
<p>The collectors’ issue is intended as a highlight in a year-long celebration of the magazine’s 125 years in print.</p>
<p>It will include the famous Girls in Pearls page, formally known as the frontispiece, which has appeared in every issue of Country Life since the first issue in January 1897.</p>
<p>The Duchess appeared on the page herself when her husband guest edited. Other members of the Royal family to star in it include the Queen, the Princess Royal, Queen Victoria, Queen Alexandra and Queen Mary.</p>

<header> <h1> How the Queen's dressmaker impressed the Queen - by refusing to tell her a secret </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Victoria Ward <time> 29 October 2019 • 5:26pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Few would be so bold as to refuse to answer a question from Her Majesty the Queen.</p>
<p>But when Her Majesty first met Angela Kelly, a Liverpudlian dockers daughter working as a housekeeper at the British Ambassador's residence in Berlin, their unusual exchange would prove pivotal for both. </p>
<p>As the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh bid farewell to the household staff following an official visit, the monarch politely asked who their next visitors would be.</p>
<p>The royal couple were taken aback when the reply came; Ms Kelly could not possibly divulge such information as it was confidential.</p>
<p>The incredulous Duke tried again; “Surely you can tell Her Majesty the Queen?” he said.</p>
<p>But Ms Kelly again replied that she had signed the Official Secrets Act and simply could not help them.</p>
<p>As she said goodbye, she told the Queen she would remember the moment for the rest of her life. “Angela, so will I,” came the reply.</p>
<a>one of the Queen’s closest confidantes. </a>
<p>Their warm friendship is detailed at length in Ms Kelly’s book, The Other Side of the Coin, the Queen, the Dresser and the Wardrobe, published on Tuesday, which offers <a>an unrivalled insight into life behind palace walls.</a></p>
<p>As such, she had a dress made up in secret, concerned that if the monarch turned up to such an important event in a shocking pink day dress, “where would it all end?”</p>
<p>The dressmaker uses the book to set a few things straight, not least the fallout from the ill-fated Annie Leibovitz shoot in 2007.</p>
<p>The BBC was forced to issue a grovelling apology to the Queen for suggesting that she had flounced out in a "huff" during a sitting with the celebrity photographer.</p>
<p>The trailer for a documentary on a year in the life of the Queen appeared to show her walking out after being asked to remove the crown - an integral part of the Order of the Garter regalia.</p>
<p>Peter Fincham, the BBC1 controller, who fuelled the controversy when he said the Queen “walked out in a huff” resigned over the incident.</p>
<p>On the day in question, she writes, it had been agreed that the Queen would meet the photographer’s daughter ahead of the portrait sitting. But when she arrived, she was met by some 15 people standing in a line, and several journalists.</p>
<p>While the BBC footage showed her apparently storming out, Ms Kelly said that in fact “she was making her way to the shoot as planned and hadn’t time to meet so many people.”</p>
<p>On one occasion, when Ms Kelly dyed her blonde hair dark underneath, the Queen looked at her and said: “Have you seen a pint of Guinness?”</p>
<p>When Ms Kelly confirmed that she had, the Queen simply responded: “Hmmmm” and Ms Kelly swiftly returned to the hairdresser.</p>
<h5>The Balmoral fancy dress party</h5>
<p>A staff fancy dress competition is held twice a year at Balmoral, judged by none other than the Queen, who dons an evening gown and tiara for the festivities.</p>
<p>However, on one such occasion recently, the monarch took a break from her judging duties and was instead having dinner with her family.</p>
<p>In her place, members of staff decided to dress up as the X Factor judging panel; Angela Kelly as Cheryl Cole.</p>
<p>“You can only imagine the look on the Queen’s face when she saw me that evening wearing a red military jacket, black leather boots and a long, dark wig,” Ms Kelly recalls.</p>
<p>“She didn’t have a clue who I was supposed to be, but she immediately recognised my assistant, Jackie, who was dressed as Her Majesty’s great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria.”</p>
<p>The theme was Balmoral and another dresser went as Victoria’s close friend, John Brown.</p>
<p>As the Queen made her way downstairs for dinner, she was heard to gleefully declare to her guests: “I’ve just been dressed by Queen Victoria and Mr Brown. And I believe by Cheryl Cole!”</p>
<h5>The Queen's 'sofa fabric' dress</h5>
<p>As Ms Kelly’s role progressed, she began to notice that the Queen’s outfits had begun to look “a little tired” and that the darker colours and longer lengths were in danger of aging the monarch.</p>
<p>The Queen increasingly sought her opinion, much to the horror of her designers who were often given short shrift during fittings.</p>
<p>On one occasion, when the Queen was draped in a piece of bold jacquard material in a large print, Ms Kelly announced that it did not suit her at all and was “totally the wrong pattern”.</p>
<p>As luck would have it, the only other person happy to proffer such forthright views happened to walk past at that moment. The Queen asked the Duke of Edinburgh what he thought of the material.</p>
<div> <div> <p>“Is that the new material for the sofa?” came the reply. Needless to say, it never saw the light of day and Ms Kelly soon began designing the monarch’s dresses herself.</p> </div> </div>
<h1> The Dowager Duchess of Grafton, steadfast confidante of the Queen who performed the duties of Mistress of the Robes with faultless discretion – obituary </h1>
<p> The office of Mistress of the Robes has its origins in Elizabeth’s reign; few people recently have had such close connections with Court </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 5 December 2021 • 1:14pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Dowager Duchess of Grafton, who has died aged 101, was the second Mistress of the Robes of the Queen’s reign, the most senior of the Queen’s ladies-in-waiting, and one of her close confidantes.</p>
<p>The Duchess became a Lady of the Bedchamber to the Queen in 1953, the year of the Coronation (in which she took part), and in 1967, as Countess of Euston, she succeeded the Dowager Duchess of Devonshire as Mistress of the Robes. </p>
<p>She particularly enjoyed the important visit paid by the Queen to Nigeria in 1956, and was prominently in attendance in Paris in 1972 and in Russia in 1994, among many others.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a long and abiding friendship was forged between them. The Eustons were to have five children and to spend as much of their lives as time and duty allowed at home in Suffolk.</p>
<p>She was not the first in her family to marry a FitzRoy. In 1875 her great-aunt, Margaret Rose Smith, had married Lord Alfred FitzRoy, later Earl of Euston and the 8th Duke of Grafton.</p>
<p>During the 1990s the Duchess put in a great deal of personal effort as president of an appeal which successfully raised £1 million towards the building of a new children’s centre at the West Suffolk Hospital.</p>
<p>Away from East Anglia, she served as a member of the board of governors of Great Ormond Street Hospital from 1952 to 1966, and she was patron of the hospital’s Nurses’ League.</p>
<p>She served as vice-president of the Trinity Hospice, Clapham Common, and was patron of the Clarence River Historical Society in Grafton, New South Wales.</p>
<p>Residents in the building were occasionally surprised to see the Queen emerging from the lift; just before the first lockdown, the Queen presented the traditional card to a centenarian in person.</p>
<a>Lady Charteris</a>, her concerned refrain was: “Can the general public see this?”
<p>The Duchess never formally retired as Mistress of the Robes, though in extreme old age she ceased to attend public engagements, particularly when her sight failed her.</p>
<p>She was appointed CVO in 1965, DCVO in 1970 and GCVO in 1980.</p>
<p>She and the Duke, who died in 2011, had two sons and three daughters. Their elder son, Lord Euston, died in 2009.</p>
<p>The Dowager Duchess of Grafton, born February 24 1920, died December 3 2021</p>
<header> <h1> The predators in the Palace and how Andrew let it happen </h1> <p> Nobody knows the real background to the Duke's relationship with Epstein and Maxwell, but it could be considered unwise at best </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Nigel Cawthorne <time> 2 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>In 2010, a year after Epstein’s release from prison, Andrew was photographed in New York’s Central Park, during a four-day stay at Epstein’s mansion, explaining to the billionaire that they could no longer stay friends.</p>
<p>So when the FBI began requesting that the prince make himself available for interview in connection with Epstein, it became clear was just how deeply Prince Andrew had allowed the duo to infiltrate his Royal life.</p>
<p>Andrew and Maxwell were seen on holiday with Epstein at Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida. Then came the invitations to Maxwell and Epstein into Royal circles in the UK.</p>
<p>Later that summer, Andrew also took Maxwell to the wedding of his former girlfriend The Hon Aurelia Cecil in Wiltshire.</p>
<p>The three amigos were back in the UK for a shooting party at Sandringham that December, mentioned in Prince Andrew’s <a>disastrous Newsnight interview</a>.</p>
<p>And who can forget the picture of Maxwell sitting on the throne inside Buckingham Palace, alongside actor Kevin Spacey, thought to have been taken in 2002.</p>
<p>Of course, there is no suggestion that Andrew knew what these friends were really like. However, all of these social events occurred during a timeframe when the sex crimes Epstein and Maxwell were convicted of took place.</p>
<p>And even after Epstein died in prison awaiting fresh sex charges in 2019 and Maxwell went to ground, the Sun reported that Prince Andrew had not cut his ties with her.</p>
<p>Now that friendship – whatever it was based on – could force Andrew to face up to his lack of initial judgement and the consequences that come when you perhaps trade centuries of caution for cash and compliments.</p>
<p>There is one friend left however who will never leave Andrew’s corner: the Queen. But, unlike her son, she is reticence itself.</p>
<p>We will never know what she thinks of Andrew allowing such an evil pairing into her homes. But, then again, perhaps neither will he.</p>

<p>The Queen has lost her second close friend in less than a month after her longstanding lady-in-waiting Lady Farnham died four days after Christmas at the age of 90.</p>
<p>Lady Farnham had been the 95-year-old monarch’s Lady of the Bedchamber since 1987 and rode alongside the Queen on the way to the Diamond Jubilee service in 2012 after the Duke of Edinburgh was hospitalised.</p>
<p>She was married to Barry Maxwell, the 12th Baron Farnham, an Irish peer and Nova Scotia baronet who died in 2001.</p>
<p>A royal source said: “It is very sad for the Queen. Everyone loved Lady Farnham, she was always so good humoured. She was also a very glamorous and attractive woman.</p>
<p>“She was always very generous to new people joining the household. </p>
<p>“It has not been a good year for the Queen - losing her husband and then the Duchess of Grafton and now Lady Farnham. </p>
<p>“They were dear friends who supported the Queen on official duties. Unfortunately a sad consequence of living a long life is that you have to say goodbye to a lot of people you care about.”</p>
<p>A death notice in the Irish Times on Dec 31 confirmed: “Diana, Lady Farnham DCVO died peacefully at home on December 29, 2021. Much loved wife, mother and grandmother. Interment of ashes at Kilmore Cathedral, Co. Cavan at a later date.”</p>
<p>Lady Farnham, whose late husband was born in County Cavan, accompanied the Queen on her highly successful tour of the Republic of Ireland in 2011 because of her Irish connections. </p>
<p>Born Diana Marion Gunnis, and known as Marion, she married Lord Farnham in 1959 and they went on to adopt two daughters, Harriet, 57, and Sophia, 54. She had four grandchildren, Araminta, 28, Henry, 26, Elsa, 15 and Celia, 13.</p>
<p>After joining the royal household in 1987, she was appointed Commander, Royal Victorian Order (CVO) in 1998, recognising her distinguished personal service to the monarch. </p>
<p>She also held the office of Justice of the Peace. She was appointed Dame Commander, Royal Victorian Order (DCVO) in 2010, which is one of the highest personal honours the Queen can bestow.</p>
