<div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Ministers must solve the energy crisis or face a devastating voter backlash </h1> <p> Households should not be forced to choose between heating and eating, and the Government is running out of time to act </p> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Ben Marlow <div>Chief City Commentator</div> <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:38pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Yet strangely, when it comes to the biggest threat to household finances - soaring energy prices - the Government seems either reluctant to act or unsure of how to, despite a crisis that has been raging since the summer. </p>
<p>Wholesale gas prices may have levelled out in recent weeks but they are still trading at more than three and a half times the levels of just a year ago, and they are on the rise again. </p>
<p>As the campaigner Martin Lewis points out, there will be millions of people who can afford the increase, but there are also millions for whom it will be “a monumental hit” and face being thrown into fuel poverty. </p>
<p>That shouldn’t be happening in modern day Britain. In the 21st century, being able to heat your home should be a basic right whoever is in Number 10.</p>
<p>The energy industry has called for state intervention to alleviate what it calls a “national crisis” and “a system-wide issue”, and yet the Government continues to sit on its hands. </p>
<p>Minsters plead that there is only so much that they can do, pointing to existing schemes for the most vulnerable including the £500m household support fund, warm home discount, and winter fuel payments, but that simply doesn’t stack up.</p>
<a> that a further 2m people are likely to join the existing 4m already living in fuel poverty,</a> and energy bosses predicting another 20pc jump in bills to as much as £2,240 in the autumn, the Government clearly must do more, and it can.
<a>cutting the latter could save as much as £300,</a> while a proposed industry-wide loan scheme could help spread the burden of sky-high prices over several years. 
<p>E.On has recommended a more radical approach to reduce the immediate burden on bill-payers, whereby the Treasury takes some or all of the cost rises onto its balance sheet, allowing sudden spikes to be repaid later.</p>
<p>Still, if the economic and social costs are not enough to wake the Cabinet from its slumber then the political fallout should be for a Government whose popularity has suffered serious damage in recent weeks. </p>
<p>Craig Mackinlay, who chairs the Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Tory MPs, has put it in plain terms. “Elections are won and lost in people’s wallets and purses,” he said this week. </p>
<p>With the London elections looming in May and Tory peer and respected political analyst Lord Hayward predicting one of the worst results in half a century for the Conservatives, ministers are running out of time to act. </p>

<p>I had no idea that generalised chirpiness and unwarranted buoyancy could hurt young people’s feelings. And so to them I have just one reply: no worries.</p>

<header> <h1> Pope Francis: Having pets instead of children is selfish </h1> <p> Pontiff sparks outrage as he laments that some married couples choose to remain childless but lavish their love on cats and dogs </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Nick Squires <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:38pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Deciding not to have children and lavishing affection instead on pets is selfish, Pope Francis has said - in remarks which provoked anger and disbelief.</p>
<p>At his weekly general audience at the Vatican, the Pope lamented the fact that some married couples opt to remain childless but transfer their love to cats, dogs and other animals.</p>
<p>“Today... we see a form of selfishness. We see that some people do not want to have a child,” the Argentinian pontiff said during the audience.</p>
<p>“Sometimes they have one, and that's it, but they have dogs and cats that take the place of children. This may make people laugh but it is a reality."</p>
<p>Couples who do not procreate deny themselves the joys of parenthood, a decision which “diminishes us, takes away our humanity”, he said.</p>
<p>The result is that "civilisation grows old without humanity because we lose the richness of fatherhood and motherhood.”</p>
<h2>Pope does not have pets of his own</h2>
<p>While his predecessor, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, is an avid lover of cats, Pope Francis does not have a pet living with him at his residence inside the walls of the Vatican.</p>
<p>He has shown affection for animals during his papacy, however – in 2016, during an audience with circus performers, he was memorably introduced to a baby black panther and patted a six-month-old tiger cub while it drained a bottle of milk.</p>
<p>His remarks about parenthood provoked anger on social media, with many people pointing out that the pope had chosen to remain childless by entering the Catholic Church as a priest.</p>
<p>Another Twitter user wrote: “Who does Pope Francis think he is, telling people what to do with their bodies? It’s 2022.”</p>
<h2>'Out of touch with reality and humanity' </h2>
<p>The Pope was accused of being “out of touch with reality and humanity” on social media.</p>
<p>The Italy-based International Organisation for the Protection of Animals said it was “strange to think that the pope considers the love in our lives limited quantitatively.”</p>
<p>“It is evident that for Francis, animal life is less important than human life. But those who feel that life is sacred, love life beyond species,” said OIPA President Massimo Comparotto.</p>
<p>The Argentine pontiff has in the past denounced the "demographic winter", or falling birth rates in the developed world.</p>
<p>Italy is a leading example of demographic decline in the West. The country has struggled with population decline for decades – long gone are the days when women had four or five children.</p>
<p>The birth rate has fallen to its lowest level since Italy was unified in the 1860s, recent figures show.</p>
<p>In 2008, more than 576,000 babies were born but that dropped to 405,000 last year, according to Istat, the national statistics agency.</p>
<p>That has prompted dire warnings that the country’s population will shrink by a fifth over the next 50 years.</p>
<p>Of Italy’s population of 60 million, almost a quarter are aged over 65 – a proportion that is only likely to grow.</p>

<p>Mr Trump had been expected to use the event at his Mar-a-Lago retreat to rail against the Congressional committee investigating his role in the chaos, and to reiterate his claims that the 2020 election was "stolen."</p>
<p>The decision marked a softening of the former president's approach as he weighs up how best to unite the party behind him for a potential White House run in 2024.</p>
<p>Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator, said Mr Trump brought up the issue of his impending press conference, which would have been only his second since leaving office, when they played golf at the weekend.</p>
<p>Mr Graham said he told the former president: "There could be peril in doing a news conference. Best to focus on election reform instead."</p>
<p>Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican senator from West Virginia, said Mr Trump had been planning an "aggressive statement" at the event, but she thought it was "not a good idea."</p>
<p>And Laura Ingraham, a high-profile Fox News host Mr Trump watches closely, had used her show to question if it was "smart" to hold a press conference because "horrific" things happened a year ago.</p>
<p>On Jan 6, 2021 rioters supportive of Mr Trump <a>stormed the US Capitol</a> trying to prevent Congress from formally certifying Joe Biden's victory.</p>
<p>They fought with police for hours, smashed windows and sent politicians and staff running for their lives.</p>
<p>One police officer died battling the rioters, and four who guarded the Capitol that day later died by suicide.</p>
<p>Four rioters also died in the mayhem, and around 140 police officers were injured.</p>
<p>Mr Biden and Kamala Harris, his vice president, will mark the anniversary with speeches at the Capitol.</p>
<p>Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said: "The president is going to speak to the truth of what happened, not the lies that some have spread since."</p>
<p>She said Mr Biden would address "those who may not believe he is the legitimate president about what he wants to do to make their lives better."</p>
<p>In a statement cancelling his press conference Mr Trump blamed the Jan 6 committee in Congress, accusing it of "total bias and dishonesty."</p>
<p>Mr Trump said he would instead discuss issues relating to Jan 6 at a rally in Arizona on Jan 15.</p>
<p>He also blamed Democrats for having "denied requests for the National Guard or Military to be present at the Capitol" before the riot happened.</p>
<p>The Jan 6 committee reportedly plans to hold public hearings in the coming months, and has already interviewed hundreds of witnesses.</p>
<p>Several high-profile former aides to Mr Trump have refused to cooperate with it.</p>
<p>In its latest move the committee asked Sean Hannity, Fox News' star host, to voluntarily answer questions about his communications with Mr Trump on Jan 6.</p>
<p>The committee has text messages sent between Mr Hannity and senior figures in Mr Trump's White House.</p>
<p>Mr Trump's cancellation decision was the latest in a series of moves that have put distance between himself and some of his more extreme supporters.</p>
<p>Last month he was booed by some during a stage appearance in texas when he confirmed that he has had his coronavirus booster shot.</p>
<p>Mr Trump also pushed back on vaccine scepticism during a recent interview with the highly supportive conservative figure Candace Owens, telling Ms Owens the vaccines were "very, very good."</p>
<p>Ms Owens later said: "People oftentimes forget, like, how old Trump is."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an Axios-Momentive poll found only 55 per cent of Americans accept that Mr Biden legitimately won the 2020 election.</p>
<p>That figure was very similar to the 58 per cent who said that in the same poll a year ago.</p>
<p>The poll also found that 57 per cent of Americans believe something similar to the Jan 6 riot will happen again in the next few years.</p>
<p>The Jan 6 Committee indicated "Watergate-style" televised hearings in prime time could be held.</p>
<p>Congressman Bennie Thompson, the Democrat chairman of the committee, said: "The public needs to know, needs to hear from people under oath about what led up to Jan 6, and to some degree, what has continued after Jan 6."</p>
<p>Congressman Jamie Raskin, a Democrat member of the committee, said: "I remember as a kid getting to watch a bit of the Watergate hearings, which were a daily spectacle that the whole country tuned into.</p>
<p>"If we can do that for a break-in in a couple of offices in the Watergate hotel, certainly we can do it for a massive break-in into the Capitol of the United States."</p>
<p>The hearings, if they go ahead, could happen as soon as March.</p>
<p>Mr Biden will use his anniversary speech at the Capitol to blame Mr Trump for the riot.</p>
<p>The White House said Mr Biden would lay out "the singular responsibility President Trump has for the chaos and carnage that we saw."</p>
<p>Mr Biden will also accuse his predecessor of trying to "distract from his role in what happened."</p>
<p>A White House spokeswoman said Mr Biden "sees January 6 as a tragic culmination of what those four years under President Trump did to our country."</p>
<header> <h1> Kazakhstan crisis exposes flaw at the heart of Vladimir Putin's authoritarian model </h1> <p> Moscow will be watching closely as its former Soviet neighbour faces an almost complete collapse of state authority </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Roland Oliphant <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:44pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>For post-Soviet autocrats, the almost complete collapse of state authority in the face of nationwide protests in Kazakhstan is the stuff of nightmares.</p>
<p>That explains his fury at Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan, and his backing of Alexander Lukashenko, the dictator of Belarus, against mass protests <a>following a fraudulent election in 2020.</a></p>
<p>But events in Kazakhstan reveal a particular fragility at the heart of his model of authoritarianism.</p>
<p>Of all the post-Soviet autocrats, Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan <a>was long considered the most successful.</a></p>
<p>He presided over a relatively wealthy and stable post-Soviet economy that, like Russia, did well out of gas, made its elite extraordinarily rich, and successfully suppressed dissent.</p>
<p>Possibly, many commentators suggested, it provided an exit strategy for Mr Putin himself.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, as crowds stormed through cities across the country demanding “shal ket” - down with the old man - that reputation was shattered.</p>
<p>That does not mean Moscow is about to intervene.</p>
<p>There is a chance that president Kasymzhomart Tokayev, with a combination of concessions and coercion, will ride out the protests yet.</p>
<p>It is unlikely to slip out of Moscow’s orbit even if the current government falls, although Moscow will be anxious to ensure the successor does not quit <a>pet projects like the Eurasian Economic Union.</a></p>
<p>Nor would it be wise to predict trouble in Russia on the basis of the uprising across the border.</p>
<p>The grievances that saw crowds storming government buildings in Almaty have deep and specific Kazakh roots.</p>
<p>Mr Putin has also built deep defences against any such occurrence in Russia.</p>
<p>The presidential administration in Moscow also keeps a hawkish eye on opinion polls and focus groups to give it fair warning of shifts in the public mood.</p>
<p>Some pro-Kremlin media outlets were already referring to a “Maidan” on Wednesday - a reference to Ukraine’s revolution that in official Russian eyes epitomises foreign interference.</p>
<p>Whatever happens in the next few days, Moscow will be watching closely.</p>

<h1> GB News, the West End and a billion-dollar fashion label: what the Grange Hill cast did next </h1>
<p> It’s fair to say that the stars of the BBC’s long-running school soap, which is soon to be made into a movie, branched out </p>
<div> <div> By Michael Hogan <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:26pm </time> </div> </div>
<a> Sir Phil Redmond,</a> now 72, is planning a Grange Hill movie, starring some of the original cast as parents and even grandparents. He’s finished the script, casting begins soon and the finished film is expected in late 2022.
<p>In fact, Grange Hill initially got flak for its gritty, unflinching look at inner city youth at a time when after-school viewing was still dominated by what Redmond called “Enid Blyton, middle class” programming.</p>
<a>Anthony Minghella</a>, who later became the Oscar-winning director of The English Patient.
<p>Was: Rebellious Suzanne Ross, who broke the rules, left school early and memorably dressed up as Boy George for the school disco.</p>
<a>Line Of Duty</a>, Strike, Silent Witness, The A Word, Britannia, Too Close and Tin Star.
<p>Was: Zammo McGuire, whose descent into heroin addiction strained his relationship with loyal girlfriend Jackie and inspired the famed “Just Say No” anti-drugs campaign.</p>
<a>Danny Dyer</a>) over some Spice girls tickets. As you do.
<p>Was: Teen tearaway Tommy Watson in the debut series.</p>
<a>Rihanna</a>. Jebbia now heads a billion-dollar fashion empire.
<p>Was: Urchin anti-hero Peter “Tucker” Jenkins, who was so key to Grange Hill's early success that he was given his own grown-up spin-off, Tucker's Luck.</p>
<p>Was: Football-mad Benny Green, a sidekick of Tucker Jenkins, who was first through the school gates when Grange Hill began and couldn’t afford a school uniform because his dad was unemployed.</p>
<p>Now: Sue-Patt became a street artist, then survived a car crash in which his older brother Michael was killed. He reportedly sank into depression and was found dead in his London flat aged 50, after his body laid undiscovered for several weeks.</p>
<p>Was: Goody two-shoes Ann Wilson, who was voted onto the school council and stood up to bullies in the early series.</p>
<p>Was: Happy-go-lucky Robbie Wright: little brother to Zammo’s girlfriend Jackie, best buddy of Ziggy Greaves and something of a playground Romeo.</p>
<p>Was: Fiona Wilson, who memorably formed rap duo named Fresh ’n’ Fly – Grange Hill’s answer to Salt ’n’ Pepa – with classmate Ronnie Birtles.</p>
<a>Harry Potter and The Cursed Child</a>.
<p>Was: Troubled teen Terence “Tegs” Ratcliffe.</p>
<p>Was: Troubled loner Danny Kendall, who became a graffiti artist and had endless run-ins with tyrannical teacher Mr Bronson. He was eventually found dead in the back of Bronson’s stolen car, having died of a neurological disorder.</p>
<p>Now: Lambeth trained as a journalist, specialising in IT. He later founded his own PR firm and held senior posts at communications giants AOL and EE. He even worked a stint as tech correspondent at some obscure publication called The Telegraph.</p>

<h1> Omnishambles complete as Tories beat a humiliating retreat from the Leadsom amendment </h1>
<p> As dawn broke over Westminster, the Government woke up with the hangover from hell – and plunged into high farce </p>

<p>“I am aware that last night’s vote has created a certain amount of controversy,” drawled Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Commons, displaying a unique gift for stating the bleedin’ obvious.</p>
<p>This was a day of low cunning and high farce as the Tories <a>beat their humiliating retreat from the Leadsom amendment</a>.</p>
<a>sacked as a PPS</a> for abstaining on the vote – did with her morning off. Perhaps a crack at The Telegraph crossword, a cheeky slurp of restorative Prosecco, or just a well-deserved lie-in. 
<p>Either way, by lunchtime she’d been reinstated – the fastest reverse-ferret since Saki’s Sredni Vashtar liberated Conradin from his maiden aunt.</p>
<a>should keep his job</a>; nicking sweets from children is good, actually. Then, once the position has become totally untenable, General Bozza will turn tail, leaving his trusted lieutenants in limbo, looking silly.
<p>But now, like Animal Farm, the flock threatened to revolt against their emasculating shepherd. Commons coffee-rooms and Tory WhatsApp groups buzzed with mutinous talk about Angela Richardson and three-line whips.</p>
<a>Rees-Mogg’s maskless face</a>. On a day when we might have been talking about
<a>Claudia Webbe</a>, Cop26 – anything at all, really – the Fat Controller had tugged the wrong lever.
<p>By mid-afternoon, <a>Owen Paterson had fallen on his sword</a>, triggering precisely the by-election the Government had wished to avoid, and with no end in sight for questions about standards in public life. </p>
<p>The omnishambles was complete. Who knows, it might even dent the Tories by half a percentage point in the opinion polls. </p>
