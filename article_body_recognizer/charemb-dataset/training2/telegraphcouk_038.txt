<h3>New data watchdog begins term</h3>
<p>John Edwards, the UK's new Information Commissioner, has begun his term amid a raft of upcoming changes to online information laws.</p>
<p>Mr Edwards, who joins on a five year term, spent the past eight years as New Zealand Privacy Commissioner, and before that worked as a barrister.</p>
<p>He succeeds Elizabeth Denham, whose term as Information Commissioner ended last year.</p>
<p>The appointment comes at the start of a busy year for information rights in the UK, with the ICO in talks with the Government over the proposed reforms to the Data Protection Act and introduction of the Online Safety Bill.</p>
<h3>Go-Ahead shares halted amid Southeastern rail scandal</h3>
<p>Shares in Go-Ahead Group have been suspended to give the company more time to finalise its delayed full-year results as it grapples with the fallout from a scandal over the Southeastern rail franchise.</p>
<p>Go-Ahead said it was working with accountancy group Deloitte to get its earnings for the year to July 3 2021 published "as soon as possible", with the results expected before the end of January.</p>
<p>Shares were suspended on Tuesday at 667p.</p>
<p>Go-Ahead was stripped of the franchise in October, with the Government seizing control of the rail contract after the firm admitted to serious errors and failures in the way it ran Southeastern.</p>
<p>The firm failed to declare more than £25m of historic taxpayer funding which should have been returned.</p>
<p>Go-Ahead said last month that it expected the Department for Transport to impose a fine on the group, although it said the full amount was unclear at the time.</p>
<h3>Pound nears two-year high against euro as traders bet on rate rise</h3>
<p>The pound is closing in on a two-year high against the euro amid growing expectations that the Bank of England will raise interest rates next month.</p>
<p>Money markets are pricing in two 15 basis points increases by the Bank's March meeting and almost a full percentage point by the end of the year, following its surprise decision to raise rates last month.</p>
<p>The pound rose 0.1pc against the euro to 83.69p, having earlier reached 83.65 pence – its highest level since February 2020. Against the dollar, it slipped 0.2pc to $1.35.</p>
<h3>Consumer credit rises £1.2bn in November</h3>
<p>Consumer credit rose by £1.2bn in November in a further sign that the economy was gathering momentum before the spread of the omicron variant.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mortgage borrowing rose sharply from £1.1bn in October to £3.7bn in November as the market began to stabilise following the end of the stamp duty holiday.</p>
<p>But Bethany Beckett at Capital Economics warned the strength in November could prove to be short-lived:</p>
<p>These data seem like old news now. Against a backdrop of surging virus infections, households’ willingness to borrow has probably dropped back again since November.</p>
<p>And, with real household disposable incomes facing a squeeze from higher inflation and higher taxes in the coming months, we suspect consumer spending may struggle to make much headway over the next few quarters.</p>
<h3>More expert reaction: Inflation biting into productivity </h3>
<p>Simon Jonsson, head of industrial products at KPMG, said:</p>
<p>It is pleasing to see that demand for manufactured goods remains robust, but inflation across a broad range of factory inputs, plus trade friction, is biting into productivity.</p>
<p>Supply chain challenges persist for many manufacturers, who will be hoping the impacts of omicron don’t worsen the situation further.</p>
<h3>Expert reaction: Manufacturing growth still subdued</h3>
<p>Rob Dobson, director at IHS Markit, said:</p>
<p>While the uptick in growth is a positive step, the upturn remains subdued compared to the middle of the year, as supply chain constraints and weak export performance constrained attempts to raise production further.</p>
<p>Manufacturers indicated that logistic issues, Brexit difficulties and the possibility of further Covid restrictions (at home and overseas) had all hit export demand at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Although supply chains remain severely stretched, there are at least signs that the situation is stabilising, with vendor delivery times lengthening to the weakest extent for a year in December.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing upturn continues in December</h3>
<p>The manufacturing sector recorded further growth in production, new orders and employment at the end of 2021, though supply chain challenges continued to slow the overall rate of growth.</p>
<p>The IHS Markit PMI rose to 57.9 in December, little changed from November's three-month high of 58.1 but still comfortably above the neutral 50 mark.</p>
<p>However, new export business remained negative and inflationary pressures remained high, with a further substantial increase in average input prices.</p>
<h3>German job market holds up despite Covid surge</h3>
<p>German employment fell by more than expected in December, suggesting the labour market in Europe's largest economy remains resilient despite a surge in Covid cases.</p>
<p>New figures from the Labour Office showed the number of people out of work fell by 23,000 to 2.4m, well above the fall of 15,000 forecast by Reuters.</p>
<p>The seasonally-adjusted jobless rate fell to 5.2pc – the lowest since March 2020, when Germany entered its first coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>However, officials warned that a jump in Covid-19 cases and renewed restrictions to contain the spread of the disease increased uncertainties.</p>
<p>This was mirrored in the fact that more companies signalled in December they could soon put more workers on furlough again.</p>
<h3>In pictures: Japan kicks off 2022 trading</h3>
<p>The new year stock rally has gathered pace around the world, with the FTSE and European stocks following the positive lead from Wall Street and Asia.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, 2022 trading kicked off with the usual ceremonial grandeur. Visits gathered to offer prayers at the Kanda Myojin shrine in Tokyo, which is frequented by worshippers seeking good fortune and prosperous business.</p>
<h3>Poll: Inflation could top 7pc this year</h3>
<p>While the FTSE is flying high today, the atmosphere is hardly one of unbridled optimism as we head into 2022.</p>
<p>Surging inflation and an escalating energy crisis have cast shadows over the economic recovery, while British households are facing a sharp cost of living crunch.</p>
<p>A survey of economists conducted by the Times found that inflation could exceed 7pc this year to reach levels not seen since the 1990s.</p>
<p>Over half of respondents expect consumer prices to rise by at least one percentage point from current levels. Prices rose by 5.1pc in the year to the end of November – the highest rate in a decade.</p>
<p>More than a third of the economists expect inflation to peak between 6 and 6.5pc, while 15pc predict it will surpass 6.5pc. Two economists, including a former Bank rate-setter, said inflation would top 7pc.</p>
<p>The Bank of England last month lifted interest rates from 0.1pc to 0.25pc in its first intervention since the start of the pandemic. More than 90pc of those surveyed said they expect rates to rise to at least 0.5pc by the end of the year.</p>
<h3>IAG shares take off on omicron hopes</h3>
<p>In a positive morning for trading on the FTSE, IAG is the stand-out winner.</p>
<p>The British Airways owner is leading the risers at the start of 2022, jumping more than 10pc to the top of the blue-chip index.</p>
<p>It comes amid wider momentum for travel and leisure stocks as investors pin their hopes on positive signs the omicron variant may not be as severe as initially thought.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 is now up 1.3pc.</p>
<h3>Tesla under fire for opening showroom in Xinjiang</h3>
<p>Tesla has been lambasted by activist groups after it said it's opened a showroom in China's Xinjiang region, where officials are accused of abuses against mostly Muslim ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Tesla last week announced the opening of its showroom in Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital, and said on its Chinese social media account: "Let's start Xinjiang's all-electric journey!"</p>
<p>The Council on American-Islamic Relations urged the electric car maker and its founder Elon Musk to close the showroom and "cease what amounts to economic support for genocide".</p>
<p>It's the latest example of a foreign company becoming caught up in diplomatic tensions over Xinjiang. The US has labelled China’s treatment of ethnic Uyghurs and other Muslims in the region as genocide.</p>
<h3>FTSE risers and fallers</h3>
<p>It's a strong start to 2022 for the FTSE 100, which has gained 1.1pc as investors take an upbeat view of the economy's prospects in the new year.</p>
<p>Travel stocks are leading the gains, with British Airways owner IAG gaining 9.5pc. Rolls-Royce is up 3.5pc, spurred on by the £53m sale of its Norwegian engine arm Bergen.</p>
<p>Commodities are also gaining ground, with BP and Shell up 3.6pc and 3pc respectively. Retailers JD Sports and Kingfisher also pushed higher.</p>
<p>The domestically-focused FTSE 250 has advanced 1.4pc, with travel stocks once again the major winners. Wizz Air and easyJet rose 9pc and 7pc respectively, while cruise operator Carnival jumped 8pc.</p>
<h3>Rolls-Royce sells Norwegian engine arm for £53m</h3>
<p>Rolls-Royce has offloaded its Norwegian maritime engine-making division in a €63m (£53m) deal, marking the group's latest efforts to bolster its balance sheet.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 company today said it's completed the sale, which was first announced in August, to British engineering firm Langley Holdings.</p>
<p>It's another step towards Rolls-Royce's target of raising at least £2bn through asset sales as boss Warren East looks to turn around the group's fortunes following a £4bn pandemic loss in 2020.</p>
<p>Bergen Engines employs more than 900 people globally and made around €200m in revenues last year.</p>
<p>New owner Langley has its headquarters in the UK and employs around 4,600 people, with main operations in Germany, Italy, France and Britain, alongside a substantial presence in the US.</p>
<h3>Wizz Air flies 2.6m passengers in December</h3>
<p>Wizz Air has revealed that 2.6m passengers booked flights during December as demand remained robust even as the omicron variant put many off travelling over Christmas.</p>
<p>The budget airline said this was a near-threefold increase on the 666,000 passengers it flew in the same month last year, meaning the load factor on its planes stood at 75.4pc compared with 56.1pc in December 2020. </p>
<p>Overall, Wizz Air flew 21.7m passengers in 2021 – up nearly a third on the 16.7m flown in 2020 when travel was hampered by numerous restrictions.</p>
<p>The Hungarian airline recently snapped up 15 daily slots at Gatwick as it looks to expand its routes from the London airport and take on rivals Ryanair and easyJet.</p>
<h3>Evergrande shares rise after trading suspension</h3>
<p>Shares in Evergrande have pushed higher following a one-day suspension after the troubled Chinese property giant was ordered to demolish dozens of buildings.</p>
<p>Chinese authorities have said the structures were built illegally on an artificial archipelago in the tourist hub, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>Shares in Evergrande climbed as much as 10pc as trading resumed, before settling up around 2pc.</p>
<h3>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes found guilty of fraud</h3>
<p>Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been found guilty of defrauding investors following a months-long trial that exposed the worst excesses of Silicon Valley's culture.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the 37-year-old entrepreneur swindled private investors between 2010 and 2015 by convincing them that Theranos' small machines could run a range of tests on just a single drop of blood from a finger prick.</p>
<p>Ms Holmes rose to Silicon Valley fame after founding the startup in 2003 at the age of just 19 and became known for her penchant for wearing Steve Jobs-like black turtlenecks.</p>
<p>She attracted both high-profile wealthy investors including media mogul Rupert Murdoch and high-profile board members. Her net worth was estimated at $4.5bn (£3.3bn) by Forbes in 2015.</p>
<p>The Theranos founder faces up to 80 years in prison, but will likely get a much lower sentence.</p>
<h3>FTSE set for strong open</h3>
<p>There's no sign of the January blues on the markets this morning, with the FTSE 100 poised to make strong gains in its first day of trading in 2022.</p>
<p>Futures tracking the blue-chip index have risen just under 1pc as traders take a bullish view of recovery hopes despite the continued spread of the omicron variant.</p>
<p>It follows record highs reached on Wall Street on Monday, while Asian stocks have also made a positive start to the year.</p>

<h1> Travel firms say scrap testing rules for UK-bound passengers because there is 'no benefit' now Omicron is rife </h1>
<p> Groups said research they commissioned into travel restrictions found domestic, not international, measures is only way to reduce omicron </p>
<div> <div> By Gareth Davies, Breaking News Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 9:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The travel industry is calling on the Government to remove all testing requirements for international travellers.</p>
<p>Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and Airlines UK said research they commissioned into travel restrictions found domestic, not international, restrictions would be the only way to reduce the spread of omicron.</p>
<p>Pre-departure and day two PCR testing were reintroduced in late November and early December in response to the spread of omicron.</p>
<p>From early December, MAG said passenger numbers at its airports fell by more than 30%.</p>
<p>The travel restrictions are expected to be reviewed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>MAG chief executive Charlie Cornish and Airlines UK boss Tim Alderslade released a joint statement on Tuesday saying the requirements could be removed "without impacting overall case rates and hospitalisations in the UK".</p>
<p>"The Health Secretary rightly acknowledged as early as 8 December that the value of any form of restrictions was significantly reduced once omicron became dominant in the UK," they wrote.</p>
<p>"This latest research by Oxera and Edge Health clearly supports the position that travel testing requirements can be removed in full without impacting overall case rates and hospitalisations in the UK.</p>
<p>Mr Cornish and Mr Alderslade said the restrictions "come at a huge cost to the travel industry" and the broader UK economy.</p>
<p>But the Laboratory and Testing Industry Organisation (LTIO) branded the calls for the "abandonment of all testing" "irresponsible".</p>
<p> A spokesman for the LTIO said: "Vaccination alongside testing provides the best protection against new, dangerous variants from entering the UK. </p>
<p>"We strongly believe that PCR tests are the best way to protect our population from the dangers of Covid-19, especially to detect new variants that could be brought into the UK from those travelling from abroad.</p>
<p>"Given the likelihood that there will be more variants this year, it would be a serious error to simply abandon testing. Such a decision would leave our country exposed to any new variants and risk further restrictions and infections."</p>

<header> <h1> Mark Cavendish's children 'feared for their lives' during burglary at knifepoint </h1> <p> Essex police have released CCTV images of people fleeing from the Cavendish family home in Ongar, Essex </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Martin Evans, Crime Correspondent <time> 8 December 2021 • 4:35pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Detectives are hunting a gang of violent armed robbers who broke into the home of British cycling star Mark Cavendish and attacked him and his family.</p>
<p>Police were called to his house in the Ongar area of Essex in the early hours of Saturday November 27 after four armed men got into the property.</p>
<p>Mr Cavendish, who had been recovering at home following a serious cycling crash, was assaulted by the gang who also assaulted his wife, the former glamour model, Peta Todd. </p>
<p>The couple’s children were also in the house at the time and witnessed the events.</p>
<p>The gang eventually made off with a Louis Vuitton suitcase and two luxury watches worth tens of thousands of pounds.</p>
<p>“No one should have to experience the sort of violence and threats made against us, let alone this happening in a family home – a place where everyone should feel safe.</p>
<p>“The items taken are simply material goods and our priority at the moment is to make sure we all recover from the incident as a family, and we know this is likely to take some time.</p>
<p>“We would like to place on record our thanks to Essex Police for a really quick response and the professionalism and the focus they are clearly putting into the investigation.”</p>
<p>Our investigation is moving along at pace and we are following a number of lines of inquiry as we seek to catch those responsible.</p>
<p>“Mr Cavendish and his wife were assaulted and threatened in their own home, in the presence of their young children, who witnessed these events. Thankfully, they are recovering, but the traumatic effect will be long standing.</p>
<p>“Today, we are releasing images of the people captured on CCTV fleeing the scene and we would urge anyone who recognises them to get in contact with us immediately.</p>
<p>“We are also releasing images of the suitcase and two watches which were stolen during the incident.</p>
<p>“It is likely the people who stole these items are attempting to offload them for sizable sums of money and I would urge anyone who is being offered these items to please get in touch with us – they are stolen property.</p>
<p>“If you have been offered these items, please contact us immediately.”</p>
<p>“We know an incident such as this will naturally cause a lot of concern within the community.</p>
<p>“There will continue to be a visible policing presence in the area as our investigations progress in the coming days.”</p>
<p>Mr Cavendish, who was born on the Isle of Man is one of biggest names in British cycling, having won a record equalling 34 stages in the Tour de France.</p>
<p>He was awarded an MBE in the 2011 Queen's Birthday Honours, for services to British Cycling and also won the 2011 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award.</p>
<p>In November he was treated in intensive care after suffering two broken ribs and a collapsed lung following a track cycling crash in Belgium.</p>

<h1> Sportswomen of the year: Lizzie Deignan reflects on an incredible year for Britain's female cyclists </h1>
<p> Number seven in our TWS moments of the year celebrates female cyclists who wowed on all kinds of terrain - from Laura Kenny to Sarah Storey </p>
<div> <div> By Tom Cary, Senior Sports Correspondent <time> 28 December 2021 • 9:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Trying to pick a rider of the year out of that lot is no mean feat. Each in their own way was remarkable.</p>
<p>Images of Deignan’s hands, bloodied from battle with the pavé, and her red-painted nails peering out from the steam in Roubaix’s famous concrete showerblocks as she took a post-race shower, immortalised the occasion.</p>
<p>From Deignan’s bloodied hands to Archibald’s sheer bloody-mindedness and restless search for perfection, which has arguably made her the world’s most dominant track rider. What a season the Scot enjoyed. </p>
<p>Utterly brilliant. Storey’s victory in the C4-5 road race in Japan this summer, in appalling conditions, was one of her best. But she is not planning on stopping there. </p>
<h1> Sportswomen of the year: BMX stars Beth Shriever and Charlotte Worthington on fame, friendship and struggle </h1>
<p> Number six in our TWS countdown are the two Olympic BMX gold medallists, speaking in first joint interview since their Tokyo triumphs </p>
<div> <div> By Fiona Tomas <time> 29 December 2021 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Back in July, nestled in the slopes of Tokyo’s Ariake Urban Sports Park, an exhausted Beth Shriever was swept up into the air by her elated team-mate, Kye Whyte, having become Britain’s first BMX Olympic champion.</p>
<p>The magnitude of what the Leytonstone-born racer achieved had barely sunk in by the time another team-mate, Charlotte Worthington, followed up with her own <a>fairy-tale sporting triumph </a>two days later.</p>
<p>“One of their make-up artists was like, ‘Was it your brother who was holding you up after the end of the race?’ I was like, ‘No … I think that’s the other BMX!’”</p>
<p>“Sometimes I think, would I rather have done a 20-minute cardio session on a bike, sweating it out, or be in a kitchen, on my feet for 12-14 hours sweating it out there? The answer is obvious.”</p>
<p>Since Worthington’s success, British Cycling has launched a BMX freestyle commission which will see £1 million investment poured into community facilities along with plans for a new national competition structure from 2022.</p>
<p>With both women now full-time athletes, have they tried each other’s disciplines? “What Chaz does is ridiculous. I would never be able to do that,” laughs Shriever. “That scares me. Doing all the flips and the drops.”</p>
<p>Worthington chips in. “I watch Beth do the big jumps and the speed and the direction she’s going at just blows my mind. It’s not something I’d be hopping onto too quickly, either.”</p>
<p>Shriever cuts across her, deliberately breaking into a smile. “They’re going to be big though, aren’t they Chaz?” </p>
<p>“They’ve got to be,” responds Worthington.</p>
<p>Spearheaded by these two poster girls, the future of British BMX is in safe hands.</p>

<div> <div> By James Corrigan, Golf Correspondent <time> 18 December 2021 • 11:08pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Asian Tour has pleaded with the RA to change its stance on denying the circuit a cherished invite to the Open Championship, and not punish it for accepting the Saudi’s $200m-plus investment. </p>
<p>But he and his 12-year-old son Charlie shot a commendable nine-under 63 in the PNC Championship’s scramble format in Orlando to stand in a tie for ninth in the 20-pair format, four off the lead of Stewart and Reagan Cink.</p>

<header> <h1> Tiger Woods 'tired but thankful' after second-placed finish alongside son at PNC Championship </h1> <p> Woods was making his first competitive appearance since nearly losing a leg in a car accident in February </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Sport <time> 19 December 2021 • 11:02pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Tiger Woods admitted he was feeling "worn out" after coming second with son Charlie at the PNC Championship.</p>
<p>The 45-year-old has been undergoing extensive rehabilitation since sustaining serious leg and ankle injuries in a car accident in February.</p>
<p>Woods made his first competitive appearance since playing in the same tournament last December and finished runner-up on 25 under, two shots behind John Daly and his son John Daly II in Orlando.</p>
<p>He said: "I'm just happy and thankful I'm able to do this. I still have my own leg, which was questionable for a while. I'm just really tired. I'm not used to this. This is my fifth round of golf this year.”</p>
<p>Tiger and Charlie, 12, reeled off 11 straight birdies but could not hold off the challenge of the father-and-son Daly team.</p>
<p>“What a blast it was," said Woods, <a>who used a buggy to get around the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club</a> in Orlando. "I'm a little worn out, but it was nice to have a cart.</p>
<p>While Tiger was the main attraction, his son Charlie displayed his father's unflappable calmness while delivering accurate drives and timely putts on a sunny day in central Florida.</p>
<p>"The fact I had my son there, he's an unbelievable player and partner,” Tiger added. “We had a great strategy going in. I thought we were going to be in there, our whole goal was never to make a bogey and we never made one.</p>
<p>"We got on a run which was great and it got interesting and tight towards the end.</p>
<p>Team Woods, clad in Tiger's trademark Sunday red shirts, started the day three shots off the pace but moved into a share of the lead after a birdie-birdie-eagle start at 14-under par.</p>
<p>After three consecutive pars, Tiger landed an approach shot close to the hole on the seventh for a tap-in and Charlie drained long putts on eight and nine to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p>Tiger drove the ball too long on the par-three 12th but Charlie was there to pick him up as his drive landed on the green and rolled back towards the hole.</p>
<p>Tiger quickly returned the favour by sinking the birdie putt after Charlie missed his attempt. The pair birdied every hole on the back nine with the exception of 18, where they were forced to settle for par.</p>
<p>Daly and his son matched Team Woods's final round 57 and finished 27-under par, a tournament record.</p>
<p>“It’s just one of the highlights of my life,” Daly said said. “To be able to play in a PGA Tour event with your son and win, it’s pretty special.</p>
<p>“We both just played great. He played unbelievable yesterday, but I played a little better today, so I made him happy.”</p>
<p>The event featured 19 father-son pairs and the father-daughter team of Nelly Korda and her dad Petr.</p>
<p>Justin Thomas and his father Mike, the tournament's defending champions, finished tied for third alongside Stewart and Reagan Cink.</p>
