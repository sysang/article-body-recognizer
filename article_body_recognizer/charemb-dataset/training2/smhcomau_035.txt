<div>Armourer in Alec Baldwin ‘Rust’ movie shooting sues prop supplier</div>
<p>Armourer Hannah Gutierrez Reed, 24, is seeking unspecified damages from prop provider Seth Kenney and his company, PDQ Arm and Prop LLC, according to the lawsuit filed in New Mexico state court on Thursday AEDT.</p>
<p>Kenney could not be reached for comment. In a December interview with ABC News, Kenney denied that live rounds on set came from his company.</p>
<p>“The introduction of live rounds onto the set, which no one anticipated, combined with the rushed and chaotic atmosphere, created a perfect storm for a safety incident,” the lawsuit states.</p>
<p>The October 21 shooting is under investigation by authorities in New Mexico and has rocked show business, claiming the life of the rising star cinematographer and wounding the film’s director, Joel Souza.</p>
<p>Reed’s suit says she recalls loading the gun with rounds labelled as dummy ammunition, shaking the box to create the signature jingling sound that the inert rounds should make.</p>
<p>“To the best of Hannah’s knowledge, the gun was now loaded with 6 dummy rounds,” the suit said.</p>
<p>Baldwin told ABC News he did not pull the trigger, saying the Colt revolver went off when he was cocking the gun and rehearsing camera angles with Hutchins.</p>

<div>‘Patch of paradise’: Property’s tree-change trend tipped to continue</div>
<p>The booming tree-change trend in property is predicted to continue into 2022, even though homebuyers may be forced back to city offices if life returns to some kind of post-lockdown normality.</p>
<p>Agents say that while the pandemic and its related city lockdowns had prompted many people to move to regional areas over the past two years, there were few signs that the pattern would change in the short to medium term.</p>
<p>McCrindle Research social researcher Geoff Bailey said homebuyers would continue to move to tree-change areas in 2022, with flexible work options offering opportunities to work city jobs from a “patch of paradise” hours away.</p>
<p>“We will continue to see Australians who love a simple lifestyle – but who can also live their values, have less commute time and more time for self-care – make the move,” Mr Bailey said.</p>
<p>A slower pace of life was attracting homebuyers to the regions, as were cheaper house prices, particularly as median house prices in Sydney and Melbourne rose well beyond $1 million, he said.</p>
<p>The tree-change trend began in earnest when COVID-19 first hit, with the number of people moving to regions in 2020 reaching its highest net level since such records began, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</p>
<p>Queensland received the largest influx of tree-changers, with 16,970 people moving into regional areas in 2020 – almost triple the number of the year before, ABS data showed.</p>
<p>Mr Bailey said this migration north took place as people fled Sydney and Melbourne during those cities’ lockdowns.</p>
<p>“The difficulty of Melbourne’s extended lockdowns and Sydney’s long lockdown was a dampener on their reputations and saw people having an aspiration to move to safer spaces [such as Queensland],” he said.</p>
<p>In Gympie, north of Brisbane, house prices jumped 27.9 per cent to a median of $447,000, but it was still cheaper to buy there than any Australian capital city.</p>
<p>Harcourts Buderim selling agent Jarrad McCarthy said the reopening of the Queensland border would bring people interstate who had been locked out of the market, as they could not inspect properties in person, back to the market in 2022.</p>
<p>“Just from my observations, I expect incoming inquiries to continue into next year,” Mr McCarthy said, adding that buyers were mostly looking for larger houses and more space to breathe.</p>
<p>“Buyers are mostly looking for four-bedroom, two-bathroom homes, nothing extraordinary. They are highly sought-after because they fit the profile.”</p>
<p>Booming house prices in Sydney and Melbourne prompted people able to work from home to move within their own states, with many buyers selling up more expensive homes in the city and moving to cheaper locales to get more bang for their regional buck.</p>
<p>LJ Hooker head of research Mathew Tiller said he expected that dynamic to continue over the short to medium term in tree-change areas. These included the already popular Blue Mountains and Hunter Valley in NSW.</p>
<p>Such areas were popular as they were within commuting distance for those working in Sydney, he said: “People returning to the office will still be able to commute back.”</p>
<p>It’s a similar story in Victoria, where the shift to regional centres has continued to gain popularity.</p>
<p>Bound Real Estate Daylesford and Hepburn director and founder Rhys Nuttall agreed that tree-changing will be strong in 2022, given changes ushered in by COVID-19, including the ability to work from home.</p>
<p>“The trend will definitely continue into the next year and beyond,” Mr Nuttall said. “People are moving out of Melbourne for the sense of community and for the extra space.”</p>

<div>Property investors, first-home buyers jumped back into the market pre-Omicron</div>
<p>Property investors jumped back into the housing market at record levels in November ahead of the Omicron outbreak and first-home buyer loans increased for the first time in months.</p>
<p>Investor lending hit a new high of $10.1 billion in November, latest data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics shows, up 3.8 per cent over the month. First-home buyer activity increased 1.9 per cent, breaking a downward trend since January 2021.</p>
<p>ABS head of finance and wealth Katherine Keenan said the overall value of new loan commitments for housing increased 7.6 per cent in November.</p>
<p>“The rise was the first since May 2021 and the largest since January 2021,” Ms Keenan said.</p>
<p>Home buyer loan commitments were strongest in NSW and Victoria, up 9.6 per cent and 9.7 per cent respectively, she said, aligning with easing COVID-19 restrictions in both states.</p>
<p>“Activity in the investor market was also strong,” she said.</p>
<p>BIS Oxford Economics senior economist Maree Kilroy said the jump in lending was due to pent-up demand from lockdowns in NSW and Victoria, though she did not think the rise would continue this year.</p>
<p>While first-home buyer loan commitments have increased, they remain at levels about 17.4 per cent below a year ago. First time buyer loan commitments jumped 12.3 per cent in Victoria over the month, while NSW was up 2.2 per cent.</p>
<p>There was an 8.2 per cent increase in loans for the construction of new homes reversing a decline since February 2021 following a significant surge on the back of the federal government’s HomeBuilder grant program.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank senior economist Kristina Clifton said the surge in new lending was surprising as some lenders had been hiking fixed interest rates and new limits had been brought in by the prudential regulator to reduce the average new loan size.</p>
<div><p>Sydney and Melbourne property values slowed dramatically in December, but finished the year with median house values up 29 per cent and 18 per cent respectively.</p></div>

<h1>Mitch Marsh flips East Freo investment property with ocean and city views for $1.59m, Agar and Richardson upgrade</h1>
<p>Australian international cricketer and Perth Scorchers star Mitch Marsh has sold his East Fremantle investment property for a $300,000 profit.</p>
<p>Marsh shifted the house through Space Real Estate for $1.59 million after buying it back in 2012.</p>
<p>The two-storey home has a big backyard, four bedrooms and two bathrooms, but the key attraction of the 802 square metre property is its 180-degree views taking in the Swan River, Indian Ocean, Perth cityscape and Fremantle Port.</p>
<p>Swan and East Fremantle Yacht Clubs, cafes, parks and the river are just a short walk from the property.</p>
<p>The 1970s-built house is prime for a renovation or to be knocked down for a new build.</p>
<p>Property prices in East Fremantle have remained steady for the past 10 years but the suburb saw growth of about 3.9 per cent over the past year.</p>
<p>The median house price for the area has increased to $1.19 million from $1.08 million over the past five years.</p>
<p>Marsh sold his Bicton house a few years ago for $2.38 million, as he upgraded to a beachside Cottesloe home he picked up for $2.75 million in late 2018.</p>
<p>The all-rounder signed on to another four years with the Scorchers on Monday and will have played 14 seasons with the club by the end of the contract.</p>
<p>"We’ve been a very successful club over a long period of time, the support we get from our fans is incredible, so it was an easy decision to sign on for another four years," Marsh said.</p>
<p>Fellow Scorcher Jhye Richardson and Ashton Agar were both active in the property market last year with the settlement of new homes in September.</p>
<p>Fast bowler Richardson bought a four bedroom, two bathroom house on a five acre block in Banjup for $1.215 million.</p>
<p>The property also features a solar heated swimming pool, rainwater tank, newly built self-contained granny flat, and a home theatre set-up featuring a projector.</p>
<div><p>Agar meanwhile has put up his Scarborough town house for rent, at $650 per week, after buying a $2.25 million home in the ritzy suburb of Dalkeith.</p><p>The three bedroom home features a tennis court and a pool.</p></div>

<div>An ice rink to come for Vaucluse’s Versailles</div>
<p>Just when we thought the $67 million waterfront home dubbed the Versailles of Vaucluse couldn’t get any more palatial, owner <b>Jerry Schwartz</b> has decided upon an addition that even Louis XIV himself would have baulked at.</p>
<p>Schwartz wants to build an ice skating rink. And no, we’re not joking.</p>
<p>The plans are valued at $700,000 but even the humblest home renovator knows the total price will quickly soar.</p>
<p>“And then I asked the builder ‘can you put one into the house?’ and he said ‘Absolutely… ’.”</p>
<p>The documents also said none of the works will be visible from the street.</p>

<div>The Peak of WA home design means living in a mansion with huge sky-framed windows</div>
<p>Most of us can only dream about living in a mansion dubbed a “flawless masterpiece” with one of the southern hemisphere’s largest sky-framed windows and stunning views of the mighty Swan River from every room.</p>
<p>For those of us less accustomed to such home design excellence, the sky-frame out of Switzerland uses advanced technology and a sleek design to allow for what can only be described as truly uninterrupted views.</p>
<p>Zorzi Builders construction director Nick D’Ercole said the owners of the Dalkeith home, known as The Peak, were much like most people building in the over-$3.5 million bracket. They wanted automated luxury, energy efficiency, and views.</p>
<p>“People are very much into views and the windows in the home are getting bigger and bigger,” he said. “It’s all panoramic.”</p>
<p>It was a challenge to move the massive panels of glass required in this build, which at the touch of a button slide open at the loungeroom level.</p>
<p>The floors underneath the carpets are heated. The spiral staircase doubles as an art piece.</p>
<p>Not to mention a climate-controlled wine cellar to fit a couple hundred bottles of wine, stone throughout, and a putting green on the roof.</p>
<p>Zorzi Builders won the Master Builders-Bankwest Housing Excellence Awards′ top prize for quality workmanship of new build for the house last weekend. Built by Zorzi, the home was designed by Andrew Boughton of Boughton Architecture.</p>
<p>The owners, who asked to remain unnamed, said they worked with Mr Boughton because he had designed other beautiful homes on the river they admired.</p>
<p>Chief awards judge Robert Shaw said the home was a modern masterpiece.</p>
<p>“Flawless is the only word that comes to mind when I think of this home. From inside out, Zorzi’s The Peak is the epitome of a modern masterpiece,” he said.</p>
<p>“The home is illuminated with windows from all angles. It is decked out with a plethora of perfectlyexecuted elements, including a basalt stone feature wall which flows throughout the home.”</p>
<p>The Best Country Home award went to Bluewater Building for a three-story home capitalising on the views of Eagle Bay.</p>
<p>Master Builders Judge Charlie Baggetta said the three-storey build made the most of the vast ocean views of Geographe Bay with strategic enclosed balconies.</p>
<p>“The stonework, tiling, cabinetry and external finishes are the perfect example of exceptionalcraftsmanship and commitment to quality,” Mr Baggetta said.</p>

<div>More real estate porn as Luxe Listings Sydney gets second season on Prime</div>

<p>“They’re all real estate rock stars,” says Tyler Bern, Prime Video’s head of content for Australia and New Zealand. “They really work hard, they care about their clients, and they are masters of their craft.”</p>
<i>Selling Houses Australia</i> is that we get to see them not just as deal machines but as human beings (that said, after four episodes I’m still on the fence about Rubinstein).
<p>Adds Bern: “This show is about the talent, it’s not a transactional show. The houses are fabulous, but they’re the backdrop.”</p>
<p>Well, sure. But for all the talk of characters and B-storylines and comic relief, there’s no getting away from the fact the backdrop consists of some truly staggering real estate, with jaw-dropping prices to match.</p>
<p>“These houses, 99 per cent of us will never set foot inside,” says Franklin. “We visit something like a quarter of a billion dollars’ worth of properties on the show.”</p>
<i>MasterChef Australia</i> and
<i>The Voice</i>. They launched Eureka in 2016, and with a slate that includes shows here and in the United States (including
<i>The Amazing Race</i> and the controversial-even-before-it’s-made Netflix docusoap
<i>Byron Baes)</i> they are enjoying a real purple patch.
<p>“We’re having a pretty good run at the moment,” concedes Franklin. “But Chris and I are like, ‘Well, you should have been with us for the first four years.’ ”</p>
<p>“There are other ways to pull people forward,” he adds with a chuckle, “than ‘have they burnt the steak or not’.”</p>

<div>Bond billionaire Bill Gross faces court over his music habits</div>
<p>“Bond king” Bill Gross is heading to court in California over his music-playing habits -- again.</p>
<p>Orange County Superior Court Judge Kimberly Knill ordered the billionaire to show up in court July 28 for a contempt hearing, after his Laguna Beach neighbour Mark Towfiq complained Gross had violated her order to keep the music down.</p>
<p>But according to a recent complaint filed by Towfiq, Gross violated the order on July 7, prompting an angry response from Gross’s lawyer, Jill Basinger.</p>
<p>Towfiq called the police though. Laguna Beach police officers came and left without issuing a citation, Gross said, according to court papers.</p>
<p>Towfiq’s lawyers then complained to Gross’s legal team about umbrellas that were put up on his property, according to a copy of an email chain the two sides exchanged.</p>
<p>Gross’s lawyers accused Towfiq of attempting to punish the Grosses for “daring to enjoy music while swimming” by asking the judge to ban the umbrellas.</p>
<p>“This is not because the umbrellas contain speakers or other amplifiers, but supposedly because they are somehow ‘harassing and intimidating,’” Gross’s lawyers said.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Towfiq didn’t immediately return a call or email seeking comment.</p>

<div>Film producer sells $30m Bellevue Hill trophy home in one week</div>
<p>As signs of softness start to show in Sydney’s broader property market, bullish results are still being set by local trophy-home owners, in some cases after just one week on the market.</p>
<p>Film producer Antoinette “Popsy” Albert is just one of a slew of owners of high-end property who have recently secured a SOLD sticker in double-quick time as buyers rush to settle their property interests ahead of Christmas.</p>
<p>Lockdowns and market uncertainty by vendors left prestige agents with few high-end housing options to offer cashed-up buyers this year, fuelling strong demand at the top end in the lead-up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Mr Albert was an early backer of Baz Luhrmann’s movie Strictly Ballroom, but he died two years before its release in 1992, leaving his wife to step in as co-producer of the Australian film.</p>
<p>Ms Albert is downsizing to Rose Bay where she bought a penthouse in the landmark Wintergarden building for $10.25 million two years ago from the late Bloch dancewear founder Betty Wilkenfeld.</p>
<p>It comes just days after the Vaucluse mansion owned by mechanic Steve Davidson and his wife Carmen sold for more than $35 million after just days on the market, through The Agency’s Steven Chen.</p>
<p>The Davidsons doubled their money on the Michael Suttor-designed mansion, having purchased it three years ago for $17 million from tech entrepreneur Gary Cohen and his wife Suzanne.</p>
<p>Last Monday, a Vaucluse mansion listed for $19 million by D’Leanne Lewis, of Laing+Simmons Double Bay, on behalf of recruitment businessman Duncan Thomson and his wife Verity, sold for close to $25 million.</p>
<p>Updated title records show the Thomson family’s Vaucluse home was bought by little-known trade businessman Christian Wang, who is trading up from a two-bedroom apartment in Chatswood.</p>
<p>Wang, who heads up investment company CW Property Group, is also director of international trade company Australink Australia, which is focussed on the dairy and infant formula trade with China.</p>
<p>Sydney’s median house price has soared this year, up 29.1 per cent in the 11 months to December, according to the latest figures from CoreLogic. However, growth in November was more subdued, up by 1 per cent.</p>

<div>Forrests’ triple property reveal includes Margaret River retreat, New Norcia farmland, Cottesloe revamp</div>
<p>The property is the Forrests’ first foray into the luxury property in the region with the estate including an eight-acre private vineyard which produces sauvignon blanc and shiraz exclusively for the on-site hotel.</p>
<p>There are 22 rooms at the hotel and an additional five-bedroom private residence along with a restaurant and conference facilities.</p>
<p>ZIZ includes iconic Australian boot brand R.M. Williams, the Cooee Restaurant in Perth and the recently purchased Gaia Retreat and Spa near Byron Bay in New South Wales.</p>
<p>The NSW retreat, which was part-owned by Olivia Newton-John, was purchased for about $30 million in October.</p>
<p>The Forrests are also investing in an eco-resort in Exmouth on WA’s picturesque Ningaloo coast and spent $42 million on a leasehold for Lizard Island at the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the Forrests bought the 6000-acre De Mole coastal estate on Kangaroo Island but have not had any development plans for the property.</p>
<p>A new design for Cottesloe’s Indiana Teahouse was revealed on Sunday and came after a public design competition stalled and the precinct the building is located in was heritage listed.</p>
<p>The beachfront building has a heritage-style design despite only being built in the 1990s.</p>
<p>The Forrests received a lease from the Cottesloe council over the building several years ago but a public competition to redevelop the site resulted in four designs where the existing structure would have been demolished.</p>
<p>Architecture studio Woods Bagot helped create the new design, which would see the reinforcement of the existing Indiana and the construction of a second building behind it with new restaurants, cafés and a kiosk spread over the site.</p>
<p>Plans for the redevelopment have been submitted to the Cottesloe council.</p>
<p>Mrs Forrest said she shared the community’s wish to preserve the western facade of the Indiana for the future.</p>
<p>The Forrests’ growing commercial food arm, Harvest Road, will benefit from the planned purchase of 7975 hectares of farmland around the New Norcia monastery in WA’s Wheatbelt.</p>
<p>It is the first time the farming land has changed hands since the monastic town was established some 175 years ago.</p>
<p>The property came up for sale in September as the order faced rising costs to compensate historical sexual abuse survivors.</p>
<p>So for the New Norcia monks have had to pay out more than $10 million to sexual abuse survivors and there could be more money to come as the national redress scheme is set to last until 2028.</p>
<p>Harvest Road chief executive Paul Slaughter said the farm was close to the company’s new feeding facility in Koojan Downs which would open next year.</p>
