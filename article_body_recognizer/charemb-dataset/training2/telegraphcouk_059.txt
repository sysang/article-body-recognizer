<header> <h1> How to make leaf mould, and why you should use it in your garden </h1> <p> When it comes to multipurpose goodness for the soil in your garden or allotment, nothing beats leaf mould </p> </header>
<div> <div> By John Walker <time> 23 December 2021 • 12:06pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Although I worked hard to set the process on track, it is nature’s patient, unseen decomposers, together with time, that have done the real magic.</p>
<p>And now it’s time to grab my sieves, reinvigorate muscles that I never knew I had, and put this rich – and free – resource to work.</p>
<h2>What is leaf mould? </h2>
<a>deciduous trees and shrubs</a> are heaped up and allowed to rot down. As they slowly moulder, only the toughest bits remain, eventually forming spongy, dark brown crumbs to rival any dessert topping. Leaf mould is easy to make,
<a>free of pests, diseases and weeds</a> (unless you gather it from where they’re seeding), a delight to handle, and you can’t possibly overdose your soil on it.
<p>The hidden alchemy that brings it about – the countless microorganisms that drive decay – gives leaf mould its almost magical quality.</p>
<p>You can buy leaf mould cages from outlets such as <a>Wayfair</a> or <a>Home Gardens Extras</a>. Alternatively, there are useful guides on how to create your own using chicken wire <a>online</a>.</p>
<p>My coarsest 1in (25mm) sieve removes little from matured leaf mould other than twigs and any wood or stones. The result is a chunky mulch that is ideal for smothering young annual weeds and blocking out light to stop others coming up.</p>
<p>If you’re impatient and have only leaf mould that is one or two years old and hasn’t yet formed “crumble”, your best bet is to use it as a mulch.</p>
<p>Using my half-inch (13mm) sieve results in a more refined mould, free of even small twigs. It’s this I covet because it has become a mainstay (along with garden compost) of my soil-building programme.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of ground to improve and sieving is impractical, take your leaf mould out as it comes, remove hard chunks of debris, and fork or dig it in.</p>
<p>As well as a soil-enhancer, I mainly use leaf mould as part of my home-made and carbon-footprint-free sowing and potting mixes.</p>
<p>For small seeds, I pass this already refined mix through my finest eighth-inch (4mm) sieve to give me a seed covering that is akin to breadcrumbs. I use it either as a light covering, or sow tiny, dust-like seed straight onto it.</p>
<p>To harness the microscopic army that magically transforms tough oak leaves into soft, brown crumbs, I keep a bucket of leaf mould next to my compost bins.</p>
<p>Whenever I add fresh material (kitchen scraps, tea-bags, coffee grinds, scrunched card, weeds), I add a handful of leaf mould, too. It keeps the compost worms happy, and helps produce cracking compost.</p>
<p>An unexpected benefit of making leaf mould is that you’re also encouraging garden biodiversity. A few months after filling a cage, I often get a flush of mushrooms over the surface, as the alchemy of decomposition begins.</p>
<p>Awareness of these temporary lodgers compels me to work more carefully, and more slowly. But patience, after all, is what making leaf mould is all about.</p>
<p>This article has been updated for winter 2021.</p>

<p>She put the alchemist into alchemilla and Aquila the eagle into the aquilegia, explaining that the nectar-rich spurs at the back of the flower were talonshaped.</p>
<p>Our one pulmonaria, with heavily spotted leaves, was called lungwort because it cured lung disease, although it didn’t really, and so on and so on. She gave me a handle to hang the Latin names on.</p>
<h2>All the things I wish I had known about gardening</h2>
<h2>1. The importance of trees for casting light and shade</h2>
<h2>2. Don’t leave gaps</h2>
<a>most efficient predator of slugs</a> and they seek out moist and damp places under foliage.
<h2>3. Only buy plants that are rooted through the pot</h2>
<p>Pre-garden centre shopping meant buying bare-root plants wrapped in newspaper and you only had two bites of the cherry, spring or autumn. Everything’s potted now, but not necessarily rooted!</p>
<a>Beth Chatto Nursery</a> for its five-sided rule. It refuses to sell anything until the roots have reached all four sides and the bottom of the pot!
<h2>4. Pick foliage over flower</h2>
<h2>5. Don’t attempt the all-year round border </h2>
<p>It sounds great in theory, but it’s loaded with problems. Everything will peak at different times, so you’ll find a shabby peony, about to enter dormancy in August, next to an autumn superstar, and spent daffodils among pristine tulips.</p>
<h2>6. Never compost problems</h2>
<h2>7. Always make leaf mould</h2>
<h2>8. Use every bit of your plot</h2>
<h2>9. Give pollinators a flower a day</h2>
<h2>10. Don’t put the whole garden to bed</h2>
<h2>11. Plant shrubs for winter scent</h2>
<p>Classics include Daphne bholua, Chimonanthus praecox and winter honeysuckle Lonicera x purpusii. Witch hazel scent varies, but ‘Aurora’ and ‘Pallida’ conjure up freesias rather than Harpic.</p>
<h2>12. Give some seeders free rein</h2>
<h2>13. No dolly mixtures please</h2>
<h2>14. Be ruthless – ditch duds</h2>
<h2>15. Choose thugs carefully</h2>
<h2>16. Divide – but only when you have to</h2>
<h2>17. Don't be afraid of colour </h2>
<p>Each season has its own colour palette, so to miss out much-derided oranges and warm-yellows in late summer and autumn is a mistake: they are the perfect partners for purples and blues.</p>
<h2>18. Invest in good tools </h2>
<h2>19. Less is more </h2>
<p>For me as a fully-fledged plantaholic, this is a work in progress. I’ve realised that four beautifully maintained, carefully positioned tubs are far better than 20, but I have trouble sticking to four. Keeping it simple looks so much better.</p>
<h2>20. Go for quality paving </h2>
<a>Bradstone Old Town Paving</a> is a good alternative.

<header> <h1> Why daffodils are the new tulips </h1> <p> Daffodils flower early, come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, smell gorgeous and flower for weeks </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Alice Vincent <time> 17 October 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Nevertheless, I – and they – persisted. And if my October mind was unconvinced, my March self was delighted. For in the depths of a wet, dark and miserable winter, there is nothing so cheering as a daffodil.</p>
<p>And how could I write about narcissus without mentioning my favourite daff-fact? Squirrels can’t abide the taste of them, so your bulbs will remain unscathed. Take that, tulips.</p>
<h2>Five best narcissus varieties to try</h2>
<li>Narcissus bulbocodium var. citrinusPalest yellow and long-flowering, this will offer delight in February and offer flowers for weeks.</li>
<li>‘Reggae’Don’t let the peach put you off. This is a subtle and pretty narcissus that looks gorgeous against an old brick wall.</li>
<li>‘Pheasant’s Eye’Also known as Narcissus poeticus var. recurvus, the squat orange-rimmed corona makes the largely white flower stand out, even in a park full of yellow daffs.</li>
<li>‘Ice Follies’Delicate, ruffled and the colour of thick cream, this is the gateway back to Big Daff territory.</li>
<li>‘Bridal Crown’Thoroughly frilly but with a phenomenal scent, these pack a punch when planted inside.</li>

<header> <h1> Forget the Christmas tree, here's how to decorate with festive foliage </h1> <p> Fill your home with fragrant festive foliage – with a little help from innovative floral designer Katie Isitt </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Alice Vincent <time> 11 December 2021 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>In either case, start by thinking about where you want your wreath.</p>
<p>“Inside, the fresh ones won’t last as long,” Katie points out. Command hooks (an adhesive brand, no tools required) are a great, non-permanent option to hang wreaths indoors without reaching for a hammer.</p>
<p>If you didn’t want to invest in flower pins (although I have a set from Niwaki, and love them), small bud vases or jars would work too.</p>
<p>She smuggles small glass vases into the foliage as a final touch, and fills them with cut hellebores. We step back, and it is gorgeous. Who needs a tree when you’ve got a yuletide forest growing magically out of the wall?</p>
<h2>Katie’s top tips</h2>
<h2>Don’t be a fashion slave</h2>
<p>It’s Christmas! Dust off the family decorations and incorporate them into something new: strung into a mantlescape or attached to foliage wrapped around a bannister. Bringing your own style to it will make it fun.</p>
<h2>Rummage around for what you’ve got</h2>
<h2>Don’t be afraid to let the mechanics show</h2>
<p>A glint of chicken wire here or a brass flower pin and copper wreath ring there won’t do anyone any harm: you’re better off concentrating on the bigger picture of the arrangement.</p>
<p>If you’re not able to pinch from the garden, see what foliage your local florist can order in for you. If it feels rash, think about how much you’re saving by not buying a tree.</p>
<h2>Compost or keep it afterwards</h2>
<p>Dried flowers will last forever, so can be carefully boxed up and stored for another year. Everything else can go in the compost bin.</p>

<header> <h1> How to grow the best bulbs for spring </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Val Bourne <time> 18 February 2017 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The year has turned. Days are getting longer once again and, on January 19, a significant thing happened in our part of the northern hemisphere.</p>
<p>The ground began to warm up again. Our gardens are slowly coming back to life and they should be producing early flowers.</p>
<p>There are lots of new plants, as well as established favourites, to tempt the bees and you. These winter gems will set your heart racing, sustain the earliest bees and bring spring one giant step nearer.</p>
<div> <div> <p>These new winter aconites are still waiting in the wings for most of us. But the common yellow winter aconite can look dazzling in early spring sunlight. You can acquire them in the green, or buy tubers in September.</p> </div> </div>
<p>Lesser celandines, now Ficaria verna (formerly <a>Ranunculus </a>ficaria), have a similar tendency to throw up doubles and singles in different foliage and flower colours.</p>
<p>Forms have been named and collected in the wild and a double named 'Flore Pleno’ has been grown in Britain for centuries.</p>
<p>In the Nineties Joe Sharman noticed that 'Double Bronze’ had produced single seedlings. “I crossed it with a plant from the orange Aurantiaca Group, but all the seedlings were single and yellow.</p>
<p>I knew the 'Double Bronze’ gene had to be in there, as well as the orange one, so I put the seedlings into a corner of woodland and, after 13 years, my first orange double appeared.”</p>
<div> <div> <p>Lesser celandines aren’t every gardener’s idea of a great plant because they have a tendency to produce lots of tiny bulbils – which travel.</p> </div> </div>
<a>Jacques Amand</a> sell 12 McMurtrie hybrids.
<p>Touches of blue, although usually rare, are abundant in the early spring garden. The most intensely blue miniature bulb is Scilla siberica and this will self-seed and grow in shade, although it will flower later in a cooler position.</p>
<p>Corydalis solida, which will also self-seed in bright woodland positions, has been revolutionised by Latvian bulb breeder Janis Ruksans, and now comes in many colours.</p>
<p>Several early bulbs also do well in lawns – the starry white-centred blue chionodoxa, <a>Anemone </a>pavonina and Crocus tommasinianus will all self-seed in lawns, although any mowing has to wait until the seeds have dropped.</p>
<h3>How to grow bulbs in grass</h3>
<li>Go for simple species bulbs, or lookalikes, rather than showy doubles. These will be bee-friendly and look natural.</li>
<li>Many species spread by self-seeding rather than by making baby bulbs, so don’t deadhead them. To allow the seeds to drop, wait at least eight weeks after flowering before you mow the grass.</li>
<li>Plant in September at twice the depth of the bulb. Lift a triangle or square of turf, using a spade, then break up the ground with a fork. Space the bulbs out on the ground, plant, then re-lay the turf.</li>
<a>Narcissus </a>pseudonarcissus (or 'W.P. Milner’) with the later flowering
<a>Ornithogalum nutans</a>, for instance.
<li>Dutch <a>crocus</a> (C. vernus) is strong enough to push through turf. The striped white and purple 'Pickwick’ and the softer violet-purple 'Remembrance’ are both excellent.</li>
<a> Scilla siberica</a>, round the trunks.

<header> <h1> Easy ways to help wildlife in your garden </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Val Bourne <time> 10 March 2019 • 4:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<h3>A natural garden depends on insects</h3>
<a> beneficial insects</a> as well as your aphids. And you’re likely to end up with more aphids because nothing’s around to eat them.
<p>They reproduce quickly without having to mate, through parthenogenesis. A newly born aphid becomes a reproducing adult within about a week and then can produce up to five offspring per day for up to 30 days.</p>
<p>The key point is that all these aphids share the same genes, including the resistance, so it’s easy to create your own super race of resistant greenfly.</p>
<h3>Native plants do matter</h3>
<p>Native trees are particularly important. The best tree for wildlife is the English oak (Quercus robur). A mature specimen supports more wildlife than any other tree and can sustain many birds too.</p>
<p>Hawthorn flowers are eaten by dormice and provide nectar and pollen for bees and other pollinating insects. The haws are rich in antioxidants and are eaten by many migrating birds such as redwings, fieldfares and thrushes, as well as small mammals.</p>
<a>Steve Backshall</a> cut his wildlife teeth there. Enough said.

<div> <div> By Val Bourne <time> 2 April 2019 • 10:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Here, expert Val Bourne has chosen a range of spring-flowering plants for different situations around the garden that will take you through from March to June.</p>
<p>1 Lungwort 'Diana Clare' (Pulmonaria) Long, silvered leaves with an apple-green cast flatter deep violet flowers, making this pulmonaria perhaps the best of all. Part shade (30cm/2ft).</p>
<p>2 <a>Bishop's hat 'Sulphureum'</a> (Epimedium x versicolor) Graceful wiry stems with two-tone yellow flowers above heart-shaped, shiny green leaves. A toughie. Part shade (30cm/2ft).</p>
<p>3 <a>Wallflower 'Bowles's Mauve'</a> (Erysimum) In flower from spring until late autumn, this bushy wallflower produces sprays of purple flowers above grey-green foliage. Sun and good drainage (75cm/2.5ft).</p>
<p>4 <a>Alpine wood fern</a> (Dryopteris wallichiana) Black bristly hairs contrast against bright green fronds when this handsome upright fern unfurls its croziers in late April. Good soil, shade (1.2 m/4ft).</p>
<p>5 <a>Tufted pansy 'Alba' (Viola cornuta)</a> A cushion of watercress-green foliage topped by wispy pansy flowers from May. Superb under roses. Shade (22cm/9in).</p>
<p>6 <a>Eastern cyclamen</a> (Cyclamen coum) Jaunty swept-back flower with a magenta nose. Grow in full sun or under trees and allow to self-seed. Good drainage (10cm/4in).</p>
<p>7 Downy <a>clematis </a>(Clematis macropetala) Let it scramble over a wall and, given time, it produces ragged, soft-petalled flowers with cool green middles. Good drainage (3m/10ft).</p>

<p>12 <a>'Pickwick' (Crocus vernus)</a> Capable of pushing through the lawn, this large-flowered crocus has lilac petals finely feathered in purple. Full sun (12cm/5in).</p>
<p>13 <a>Gold-edged winter daphne 'Aureomarginata' (Daphne odora)</a> Easy daphne with lily-scented pink flowers and yellow-rimmed green leaves. Wide rather than tall. Warm shelter (2m/7ft).</p>
<p>14 <a>Siberian bugloss 'Jack Frost'</a> (Brunnera macrophylla) Heart-shaped silvered leaves dramatically edged and veined in green, finished off with dainty blue flowers. Good soil, part shade (50cm/20in).</p>
<p>15 <a>Tulip 'Spring Green'</a> This colour-washed green and white tulip softens deep shade and mixes brilliantly with green foliage. Shade (30cm/12in).</p>
<p>16 <a>Spurge (Euphorbia polychroma) </a>A mound of acid yellow flowers throughout spring. Brightens up a dark corner or shows off vibrant tulips. Easy anywhere (38cm/15in).</p>

<p>18 Wood anemone 'Vestal' (<a>Anemone nemorosa</a>) This pristine white anemone has a neat, double centre and long-lasting flowers that spread. Woodland shade (15cm/6in).</p>
<p>19 <a>Bleeding heart 'Bacchanal'</a> Delicate, apple-green ferny foliage topped by claret-red bleeding hearts on long stems. More persistent than many. Part shade (30cm/1ft).</p>
<p>20 <a>Dog's tooth violet 'Pagoda' (Erythronium)</a> Pallid, yellow Tiffany lamps and mottled foliage make this a woodland essential. Divide after flowering to encourage more. Leaf-litter, humus-rich soil (50cm/20in).</p>
<p>21 <a>Magnolia 'Leonard Messel' (Magnolia x loebneri)</a> The slender, rose-pink petals splay outwards to form a star. Frost resistant, but site away from morning sun. Moist soil (5m/16ft).</p>
<p>22 'Grandiceps' (<a>Polystichum setiferum</a>) These elaborate polystichums look almost mossy in spring and this form has upright crested fronds. Shade but not too dry (38cm/15in).</p>
<p>23 Spurge 'Dixter' (<a>Euphorbia griffithii</a>) Asparagus-like spears develop into warm orange heads, even in deep shade, and the stems and leaf veins share the same tone. Good soil (90cm/3ft).</p>
<p>24 <a>Intermediate periwinkle (Vinca difformis)</a> Wide-eyed, white periwinkle flowers with a hint of steel-blue, for early ground cover in an awkward spot. Accommodating (60cm/2ft).</p>
<p>25 Grape hyacinth 'Valerie Finnis' (<a>Muscari armeniacum</a>) A baby-blue grape hyacinth with cool green overtones. Densely packed flowers on short stalks. Easy anywhere (20cm/8in).</p>

<header> <h1> How to layer bulbs in pots and containers - expert tips from Sarah Raven </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Sarah Raven <time> 10 September 2019 • 3:22pm </time> </div> </div>
<blockquote> <p>If you want to serve up a zingy spring feast of colour, layering is the way to go</p> </blockquote>
<p>One of my favourite sights in any garden is the huge copper at the centre of the cottage garden at Sissinghurst in spring, surrounded by a quartet of towering yews.</p>
<p>The copper is planted with 50 bulbs of one variety of tulip, the colour of their leaves almost perfectly matching the metal.</p>
<p>This is an inspiring example of what you can get from bulbs in a pot - the benchmark of a perfect marriage, to which we should all aspire. Few of us have such lovely containers, but single varieties, in a single, large pot, almost always work well.</p>
<p>Try the early-flowering tulip 'Orange Emperor' and place the pot near a tall, bushy Euphorbia characias 'John Tomlinson'. Add some purple splashes of honesty (Lunaria annua 'Munstead Purple') and you're on to a good thing.</p>
<p>If a show of 'Orange Emperor' isn't quite enough, you can easily do more. Try planting it with a later-flowering tulip, such as the very long-season parrot 'Rococo'.</p>
<p>As soon as 'Orange Emperor' goes over, you can take it out, deadhead it and plant all the bulbs in the green (with their leaves left on), to flower somewhere else next year.</p>
<p>This leaves room for a second performance from 'Rococo'. Its foliage and flower buds will be clear between the plants of the fading 'Orange Emperor', so it's easy to remove the latter.</p>
<p>To achieve these dense and flowery potfuls, you have to plant your bulbs in layers, in what the Dutch call a bulb lasagne, layering them one on top of another.</p>
<p>The largest and latest flowering goes in deepest, with the smallest and earliest on top.</p>
<p>The shoots of the lower level bend around anything they hit sitting over their heads and keep growing. I'm planting up a Perspex pot this year so I can follow each bulb as it shoots and take photographs as they grow.</p>
<p>Doing it like this, you need to plant the bulbs slightly farther apart than you would if planting just a single layer, so 1-1½in apart is the right sort of spacing.</p>
<p>The first layer can go as deep as 11-12in. Then cover them with a couple of inches of potting compost before you place the next layer of bulbs.</p>
<p>The combinations above involve a two-layer lasagne, but you can push it to three, and branch out from tulips to crocus, daffodils or hyacinths.</p>
<p>The foliage appears in January in a sheltered spot, and it can flower from February until April if you keep deadheading. I have another pot with the scented and delicate-flowered March daffodil 'Minnow' so I can compare them.</p>
<p>In my large, long tom pots (16in wide and 25in deep) I have 15 bulbs in each layer, so 45 bulbs in the triple-decker, the bottom layer planted at nearly a foot deep, the middle at 8in deep and the top bulbs 4-5in below the surface.</p>
<p>Triple deckers are designed to flower in succession, but I've also been experimenting with mixing flowers that all appear together.</p>
<p>I've had 'Prinses Irene' in my long toms mixed with a couple more early tulips - 'Havran' and 'Couleur Cardinal'.</p>
<p>The three colours work wonderfully - I call it my Venetian collection - burnt orange, black, deep red, all at their best at the same time.</p>
<p>Last spring I tried another trio of my current favourite tulip, 'Bruine Wimpel', with 'Helmar' and 'Jan Reus'. 'Bruine Wimpel' is incredible, the inside of its petals the colour of a brandy snap, the outside a mix of copper, chalk and pink.</p>
<p>It was magnificent planted with wine-red 'Jan Reus', with a zing from the deep red, yellow-flashed 'Helmar'. This provided bright, healthy foliage through March, topped with flowers from April into May.</p>
<p>• Bulbs ideally suited to pots include snowdrops, crocus, Iris danfordiae and I. reticulata, grape hyacinths, scillas, puschkinias, chionodoxas, anemones, hyacinths and daffodils (particularly the small-cupped and species varieties).</p>
<p>• Among the tulips, the Fosteriana varieties (such as 'Orange Emperor' and 'Purissima'), single earlies (such as 'Prinses Irene', 'Couleur Cardinal' and 'Cairo'), the double earlies and Triumphs (such as 'Havran') are all particularly good.</p>
<p>• Drainage is key, so pots and containers need holes in the bottom. Cover these with crocks - pottery shards or pebbles - to prevent them from becoming clogged.</p>
<p>• You can plant bulbs closer in pots than you do in the soil. Even so, they shouldn't touch each other or the pot sides.</p>
<p>• If planting just one layer of bulbs, plant at the depth you would in a garden - twice their height (3in minimum).</p>
<p>• Water after planting, and regularly in the first weeks, when roots are forming. Don't let the compost dry out.</p>
<p>• Pots of spring bulbs can tolerate some freezing weather, but need protection in periods of moderate to severe frost. Cover or circle the pots with bubble wrap.</p>
<p>• The <a>Telegraph Garden Shop</a> has a great selection of bulbs ideal for planting in pots and borders</p>

<p>Echeverias are perfectly matched to those of us who love plants in our lives, even now in midwinter, but are not the best at caring for houseplants.</p>
<p>Originating from semi-desert areas of Mexico, echeverias are able to ­survive with only the most ­occasional ­watering and in fact the commonest cause of problems is not under, but overdoing it.</p>
<p>We’ve grown Echeveria elegans here for a few years and I love it, but last spring, with more and more interesting varieties available, I decided to branch out and try several others.</p>
<h3>Echeveria trial-winners </h3>
<p>I’ve been loving that vague imitation of a spring Mediterranean hillside scene and would recommend it to anyone – even the-kiss-of-death, non-green-fingered plant lover – for next winter.</p>

<header> <h1> This could be the reason your roses aren't growing </h1> <p> Recent scientific research has found a home-spun cure can actually work to make your roses bloom </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Bunny Guinness <time> 1 March 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Roses, the nation’s favourite flower, have been grown in beds for hundreds of years – and rose replant disease has been a thorn in the flesh of gardeners for just as long as we have been growing them.</p>
<p>This is a worldwide problem. Many causes have been suggested, including eelworm, nutrient deficiency and pathogenic fungi.</p>
<p>This prompted a reader, Nick Previté, to ring me to say that more than 40 years ago he bought some roses from <a>Henry Stree</a>t.</p>
<h4>What is rose replant disease?</h4>
<p>What you do get with RRD, though, is about 50 per cent depression in growth above and below ground.</p>
<a> Institute of Horticultural Production Systems</a> at Leibniz University in Hanover, Germany.
<p>They have been researching RRD since 2010, but received significant funding in 2015 from the Mathias Tantau Foundation (Herr Tantau was a famous German rose breeder).</p>
<p>In contrast, roses grown in the irradiated soil were healthy.</p>
<p>The soil is a complex microbiome, teeming with many fungi, bacteria as well as other living organisms.</p>
<p>From their recent work, Prof Winkelmann suggests that bacteria of the Streptomyces family act as “door openers” for the pathogenic fungi to attack the roots.</p>
<p>A working hypothesis is that the bacteria are attracted to the phenolic compounds that the roses excrete, and these bacteria then weaken the rose root in some way, which allows fungal entry.</p>
<p>In three years’ time, in 2024, the use of these chemicals will be banned in Germany, so other measures to inhibit replant diseases must be found. Hence, the funding of the research which will benefit rose lovers the world over.</p>
<p>Many other interesting findings have come out. It seems that apple roots seem to sense the pathogenic fungi and actively try to avoid infected soil.</p>
<p>Scientists assume (based on work done on apples) that the rose needs to be established with the mycorrhiza for eight weeks before being exposed to a hostile environment.</p>
<p>Prof Winkelmann suggests that maybe rose growers should sell plants in containers with the mycorrhiza already incorporated.</p>
<p>This might allow easier ingress of the pathogenic fungi, making roses grown in the garden even more vulnerable than those grown in infected soil in pots in the research.</p>
<h4>What’s the answer?</h4>
<p>I asked Prof Winkelmann what she would do today, if she were replanting roses into “rose sick” soil.</p>
<h4>How to plant a rose </h4>
<p>Rosarian Michael Marriott explains how to plant a rose. </p>
<li>Choose a tough variety [e.g. shrub roses awarded the <a>RHS Award of Garden Merit</a>].</li>
<li>Soak bare-rooted and containerised roses for about one hour before planting.</li>
<li>Dig hole to depth of roots (approx 40cm), i.e. just large enough to accommodate roots.</li>
<li>Space roses of same variety 40-50cm apart. Allow about 1m between different varieties.</li>
<li>Backfill with topsoil mixed with well-rotted organic matter.</li>
<li>Make sure base of stems is about 5cm below soil level. Apply mulch.</li>
<li>Water in well (two gallons per plant) after planting and at regular intervals if at all dry.</li>
<li>Feed in April/May and again in June.</li>
<h4>Apples suffer same attacks</h4>
<p>It has also been found that peach, almond and cherry are affected by various pathogens of Nectriaceae, as indeed are plants not of the rose family, such as olive, walnut, loquat and avocado.</p>

<header> <h1> The garden jobs you must complete before any hot weather arrives </h1> <p> Getting your outdoor space in order can range from coppicing an overgrown hazel walk, to checking up on hedgehogs and celebrating magnolias </p> </header>

<p>With more people than ever enjoying their gardens, the design queries keep flooding in. I find it impossible to design a space without a decent survey, but gardeners are always reluctant to do this.</p>
<p>If you cannot afford to get a professional survey done (this could cost from £800 to £1,500 depending on size) it is quite feasible to do it yourself.</p>
<p>You can zoom out to get a usable scale – 1:100 is a useful scale for small to quite large gardens – and then print out the result. Many gardeners are surprised when they see their plot on a plan.</p>
<p>“Rectangular” areas are often nothing of the sort, and spaces are generally perceived by the eye differently from how they are in reality. This is why having a plan is essential to make your proposed design work.</p>
<p>From the basic plan, you then need to plot everything you want to keep: trees, borders, steps, pools etc. This you do using the triangulation method, which involves two long tape measures and a bit of legwork.</p>
<p>Having got the layout right, the next challenge is determining the actual levels. Often, gardens that appear flat are deceptive. For this, the Line Laser Level from Bosch (<a>£29.99</a>), which has a range of 20m, is helpful.</p>
<h4>Magnolias have a moment</h4>
<a>Royal Botanic Gardens</a>, Kew, says his favourite cultivar is M. x loebneri ‘Leonard Messel’ (above), as it never seems to be frosted and is a choice pale pink. It must have some form of anti-freeze in the tepals, he thinks.
<p>John Anderson, head gardener of <a>Savill Gardens</a>, reckons the purple forms of M. x soulangeana are slightly more frost-hardy than the white and they disguise the damage better.</p>
<p>Email: bunnyguinness@btconnect.com and put Pot Offer in the subject line.</p>
<a>Aalborg University </a>in Denmark, who has been researching the problem and trialling 18 different robotic mowers, including the iMow from Stihl, which is the one I have.
<p>Hedgehogs may sometimes be active during the day for several different reasons, such as disruption to their habitat during garden work. It is also quite often seen that mother hedgehogs teach their hoglets to forage during daylight hours.</p>
<p>My mighty little saw makes light work of slicing through branches up to 8cm diameter. So tackling my hazel walk is no big deal. It is highly satisfying to lighten the canopy, as the balance of light to shade has got a bit out of hand.</p>
<p>In order to favour the shrub roses (‘Windflower’), which are studded through a selection of ferns, hellebores, violas, topiary and honesty that grow beneath and beside the nut trees, I am hacking back a fair few.</p>
<p>I should have done this before the leaves started to break, but I am on the back foot this spring and hazels don’t “bleed” sap, so should be OK.</p>
<p>I have always found that a garden that appeals to children is not only a simple way to keep them productively occupied, but also hugely beneficial to their development, mood and well-being.</p>
<p>The grass quickly grows through the holes, so you don’t even see the mat, and you can mow over them.</p>
<p>I like them because they protect the grass (no bald areas or mud under the swing) and they cushion falls. They are around £24 per 1.5 sq/m, so money well spent.</p>
<h3>White asparagus, ricotta and anchovy crostini </h3>
<p>By Charlie Hibbert, head chef at <a>Thyme </a></p>
<li>¼ loaf of stale sourdough bread, unsliced</li>
<li>3-4 spears of asparagus, tough ends removed</li>
<li>4 anchovies (salted), the best quality you can find, sliced into 3 on an angle across the width of the anchovy</li>
<li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 160C/Gas 3.</li>
<li>Slice the loaf into the thinnest possible slices (leaving the bread in the fridge overnight can make it easier to slice).</li>
<li>Lay the slices flat on a baking tray and drizzle with olive oil and season with a little salt.</li>
