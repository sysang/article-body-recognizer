<h1> 'Spa resorts remind me of prison, but I’d happily do another stretch' </h1>
<p> The idea of being pampered in a category-A retreat used to fill this man with dread – and then he took a trip to Carden Park in Cheshire </p>
<div> <div> By Ed Grenby <time> 2 January 2022 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Off to the spa I shuffle. A light, airy, all-wood-and-windows barn of a building, with one wall made of moss, and views out over the estate, it’s as sleekly modern as a spaceship, but as warm and welcoming as a good gastropub.</p>
<p>In the Sensory room, there are even comfier, beanbaggy seats, all facing a giant cinema screen. Sadly, all that’s playing is a load of luminous fish and serene-looking turtles on a tropical reef (I keep expecting a shark to appear).</p>
<p>Forty to 80 winks later, I try out the spa’s Thermal Experiences: a Byzantine complex of rooms which run the gamut from uncomfortably hot to unbearably hot, and in every possible permutation of ickily damp and blisteringly dry.</p>
<p>There’s a terrific restaurant, too, called Elements, where I have a chocolate and miso tart that is way too splendid to be good for you; but I can put off the inevitable only so long. I have an appointment with Lydia.</p>

<h2>Flukey fun – Baja California, Mexico</h2>
<h2>Rare birds and colourful seas – Raja Ampat, Indonesia</h2>
<h2>On home shores – Hebrides, Scotland</h2>
<h2>Top tips for wildlife cruises</h2>
<h2>Seasonal attractions </h2>
<p>Wildlife has its seasons so be sure to consult your operator about what to expect and when to go</p>
<h2>Scan and scan again </h2>
<p>Binoculars are a must – not only to look at things pointed out but to scan for your own sightings</p>
<h2>Visit the bridge </h2>
<p>On expedition cruise ships the bridge is usually open to guests, except in rough weather. Pop in and chat to the crew. They can often explain, via the charts, where and when they expect to see marine life </p>
<p>The on-board lectures are often great. Most guides double as accomplished speakers and will enrich your whole experience</p>
<p>Wildlife can never be guaranteed. Conditions at sea are unpredictable and the itinerary may change overnight. You may not see everything pictured in the brochure, but invariably you’ll see other things that aren’t</p>
<p>Your cruise may include “wet landings”, when disembarking from a Zodiac on a beach, plus plentiful spray. Pack waterproof gear and wellies (if not provided by the ship), and use a dry bag to house your camera and phone</p>

<h1> Strange tales on the QE2 – from drunken crew to a breakdown caused by jellyfish </h1>
<p> A former QE2 captain and his son have set up a website dedicated to the history of the famous ocean liner – here are some of the highlights </p>
<div> <div> By Dave Monk <time> 22 December 2021 • 1:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Over 40 years the iconic Cunard liner Queen Elizabeth 2 sailed more than five million miles – and now a former captain and his son have set up a website detailing every single voyage.</p>
<p>Ron and Sam Warwick have logged all the itineraries, starting with the ship’s sea trials in 1968 right up to her farewell cruise in 2008 to Dubai, where she has now been converted into a luxury hotel.</p>
<p>Their fascinating <a>QE2 Abstract Log</a> records the 232,129 hours that the Clyde-built ship was at sea, naming the 312 ports of call and the 25 captains, starting with Commodore Warwick’s father William.</p>
<p>Year-by-year entries list mechanical problems such as engine room fires, rudder failures, collisions, a grounding – and a breakdown caused by jellyfish.</p>
<p>Records of men and women going overboard sit alongside the joy of a baby being born on the ship and the successful rescue of seamen. </p>
<p>QE2 battled 90ft waves, was involved in a bomb scare and was saluted in a flypast by Concorde. Visitors included the Queen, Princess Diana and other royals, as well as Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>There are even records of when the ship was requisitioned to carry troops in the Falklands War in 1982.</p>
<p>One of the most peculiar incidents, however, was when drunken crew members went on the rampage during a world cruise in 2005, damaging priceless tapestries.</p>
<p>Sections of the website list the most visited ports and countries, the distance sailed every year, and all the 805 transatlantic crossings. Former passengers can look up their voyages or consult an interactive map of destinations.</p>
<p>Over her history, the 1,900-passenger QE2 ploughed the seas at an average of 24.72 knots – faster than the operating speed of most modern cruise ships. </p>
<p>The exhaustive research has taken years but IT consultant Sam Warwick – now living in Australia – claims the information is at least “99.5 per cent accurate”.</p>
<p>His 81-year-old father, who was captain from 1990 until 2003, said: “When the QE2 came into service the ship's movements were recorded manually in the ship's log books. </p>
<p>“I kept a record of all my voyages during my career. Sam travelled whenever he was able to do so – from an early age he has always been interested in ships.”</p>
<p>Sam Warwick, a 53-year-old amateur diver who’s written books about cruising and shipwrecks, created the first website dedicated to the QE2 in 1995. He first became aware of the log database in 2001 when his father sent it to him. </p>
<p>“In terms of stats one of the most interesting for me personally was to discover that my grandfather had the longest voyage on the ship – 201 continuous days in command.”</p>
<p>Among the many difficulties Sam Warwick encountered was there was no standardised form of entering the names of ports – so an officer might put Barbados or Bridgetown for the same call. </p>
<h2>The QE2’s top 10 ports of call</h2>
<li>Southampton, England (727)</li>
<li>Cherbourg, France (268)</li>
<li>Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands (184)</li>
<li>Port Everglades, Florida, USA (143)</li>
<li>Bridgetown, Barbados (129)</li>
