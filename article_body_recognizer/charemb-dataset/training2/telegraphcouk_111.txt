<h1> Wolf Witch Giant Fairy, Linbury Theatre review: innovative and energetic family fun </h1>
<p> Winning costumes will keep kids entertained in this retelling of the Little Red Riding Hood story, but some decent music wouldn't go amiss </p>
<div> <div> By Nicholas Kenyon <time> 19 December 2021 • 12:05am </time> </div> </div>
<p>So all credit to the Royal Opera for embarking on a creative collaboration with the innovative theatre company Little Bulb, and producing this new Christmas show for families and children from about five years upwards.</p>
<a>Little Red Riding Hood</a> story, with the evidently relieved pay-off line “there she is – she’s alive!”.
<p>Perhaps this won’t matter to young audiences, but it does remind us for the future that the one thing that will reliably draw audiences new and old to this form of theatre is great, unforgettable music. Opera cannot do without it.</p>

<h2> <a> Jenůfa, Royal Opera, review: edgy, evocative new staging that will surely become a classic </a> </h2>
<p> Claus Guth's production of Janáček’s great tragedy tranascends its nationalistic origins and makes it a tale about all oppressive society </p>
<h2> The Midsummer Marriage feels like a Magic Flute, clad in English myth. Bring on the Tippett revival! </h2>
<p> For his debut concert as principal conductor of the London Philharmonic, Edward Gardner made an inspired choice – and executed it superbly </p>
<h2> <a> Madam Butterfly, review: no culture wars, just a very human tragedy from WNO </a> </h2>
<p> Lindy Hume's production of Puccini's contested masterpiece pares back the imperalist context to reveal a deeply moving tale </p>
<h2> <a> Rigoletto, Royal Opera, review: thrilling music, ascetic sets and a truly grotesque doll </a> </h2>
<p> Oliver Mears's new staging of Verdi's great tragedy feels like a work-in-progress but already has plenty to grab opera-lovers' attention </p>
<h2> <a> Tosca, South Facing Festival, review: ENO's field trip is opera for people who don't like opera </a> </h2>
<p> English National Opera bring their A team - including a fiercely expressive Natalya Romaniw - to a chilly park in South London. But why? </p>
<h2> Best shows to see at the Fringe and Edinburgh International Festival 2021 – from comedy to opera </h2>
<p> From theatre to poetry and jazz to classical music, these are the hottest tickets in town </p>
<h2> <a> Stop patronising audiences and let art speak for itself </a> </h2>
<p> Welsh National Opera's decision to stage talks on 'imperialism' alongside its production of Madam Butterfly is an insult to opera-lovers </p>
<h2> <a> British culture will suffer if we copy Macron’s bribery of the young </a> </h2>
<p> By yoking access to the arts to government voucher schemes and public-health policies, everyone’s cultural life is badly devalued </p>
<h2> <a> Luisa Miller, Glyndebourne, review: a terrific tonic in the naughty world of country-house opera </a> </h2>
<p> Glyndebourne's first ever production of Verdi's serious-minded drama is eloquently staged, exquisitely conducted and beautifully sung </p>
<h2> The late Graham Vick's comic Rhinegold is a triumph – if only the visionary had lived to see it </h2>
<p> The Birmingham Opera founder was a true maverick who brought a rude demotic energy to hallowed works, until his untimely death two weeks ago </p>
<h2> <a> We mustn’t stamp ‘creative friction’ out of the arts to satisfy online puritans </a> </h2>
<p> From Bernhardt and Duse to Olivier and Gielgud, we’ve always needed interpersonal tension to make great art – and good entertainment </p>
<h2> <a> Graham Vick: the man who took Birmingham Opera to the (literal) abattoir </a> </h2>
<p> Uncompromising and unconventional, the brilliant late director deployed helicopters, staged works in banking halls and used amateur singers </p>
<h2> <a> Opera Holland Park’s L’Amico Fritz is delicious romantic froth </a> </h2>
<p> With its sumptuous duets and cheerfully unchallenging plot, this charming production is 'opera without tears' </p>
<h2> The Life and Death of Alexander Litvinenko: thrilling story, bold staging, but not there yet </h2>
<p> This new work at Grange Park Opera is exciting but flawed, with its lively tale of Russian spies and assassins hobbled by a hectic score </p>
<h2> <a> The Cunning Little Vixen receives a sensual but rather patchy outdoor makeover </a> </h2>
<p> Opera Holland Park has the perfect setting for Janáček’s earthy tale, and two leads to match, but the musical quality isn’t quite there </p>
<h2> <a> Greek gods in Stetsons? This Return of Ulysses is Monteverdi done differently </a> </h2>
<p> Polly Graham’s bold production for Longborough sets the Odyssean climax in modern-day America, with a vivacious cast on top form </p>
<h2> <a> Three Buxton operas: Cinderella, Sondheim and something ‘too bawdy’ for the BBC </a> </h2>
<p> This year’s International Festival thrums along with pleasures great and small, including a revived Malcolm Arnold piece rejected in 1952 </p>
<h2> Falstaff, Scottish Opera review: David McVicar brings opulent beauty to a Glasgow car park </h2>

<h1> Halo Infinite campaign review: a dazzling ballet of sci-fi action </h1>
<p> The blockbuster shooter goes open-world with mixed results, but its impeccable combat and sumptuous vistas win out </p>
<div> <div> By Tom Hoggins <time> 6 December 2021 • 8:46am </time> </div> </div>
<a>Doom</a> games may have something to say about it, but if there is a shooter with better combat mechanics than Halo Infinite, I am yet to play it.

<h1> Ben Elton, Harold Pinter Theatre, review: motormouth is the voice of sanity in a world gone mad </h1>
<p> The self-described 'godfather of modern stand-up' marks the 40th anniversary of his stage debut with a funny, valuable show </p>
<div> <div> By Dominic Cavendish, Theatre Critic <time> 21 December 2021 • 2:53pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Ahead of making his entrance in a new show that marks the 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary of his stage debut and his first West End run, Ben Elton announces himself as ‘the godfather of modern stand-up comedy’. </p>
<p>“We’ve got a lot to get through,” he declares, as he enlarges on his theme – his confusion about the modern world. He is the incarnation of the bewildered common man.</p>
<p>At the end, we get a stark warning about a possible return – in our post-truth times - to the dark ages: “Galileo is back in the dock”. </p>
<p>Elton is valuably raging against the dying of the enlightenment. Though no swansong, it feels like he’s passing on the baton to the youth of today to take a stand.</p>
<p>Until Dec 30. Tickets: benelton.live</p>

<h1> Relax, Maureen Lipman – ‘offensive’ comedy is in rude health </h1>
<p> The 77-year-old actress suggests that comedians everywhere are self-censoring – but the reality on stage and screen is very different </p>

<p>So if Dame Maureen, 77, wants to change the shape of modern comedy, she could start by buying a few more tickets for gigs at the Frog and Bucket. </p>
<h1> Mackenzie Crook: 'Worzel Gummidge would give Extinction Rebellion the thumbs up' </h1>
<p> How The Office star channelled his own love of nature to transform the haunting 1970s scarecrow into delightful (and timely) family viewing </p>
<div> <div> By Chris Bennion <time> 27 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>“My grandfather was this shy, grumpy greengrocer,” says Crook. “It turns out he had this hobby of trying to make fake ghost photos. We had no idea. I used to do it when I was younger, too.”</p>
<p>“I think there’s an environmental message to the show,” says Crook. “It would be odd not to include it, as it’s such a current thing. But I don’t want it to be preachy, it should be almost subliminal.”</p>
<p>It will be instructive to see how the production deals with men like Ginger and, in particular Rylance’s Rooster; older men who ply young girls with booze and drugs. Byron is not a man who fits in the MeToo era.</p>
<p>Worzel Gummidge is on BBC One at 7.15pm on December 28 and 29</p>
