<div><div><h1>No truth to alleged ‘evidence’ that Capitol rioter was antifa activist</h1></div><div>By ALI SWENSONJanuary 8, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>One widespread claim highlights photos of a bearded man in a yellow sweatshirt who can be found in several images taken inside the Capitol during the riots.</p>
<p>Social media users are comparing those photos to an image of a similar-looking bearded man posing with another, short-haired man on the website PhillyAntifa.org.</p>
<p>“Indisputable photographic evidence that antifa violently broke into Congress today to inflict harm do damage,” pro-Trump attorney L. Lin Wood Jr. tweeted on Wednesday. “NOT @realDonaldTrump supporters.”</p>
<p>“ANTIFA in disguise,” read a Wednesday Facebook post with the photos shared thousands of times.</p>
<p>However, a visit to the website PhillyAntifa.org shows the bearded man people are claiming is associated with antifa was actually on the website because the site was exposing him as a “longtime neo-Nazi.”</p>
<p>But a founder of XRVision flatly denied those claims in a statement on Thursday, saying he didn’t know where The Washington Times got that information.</p>
<p>“XRVision didn’t generate any composites or detections for the Washington Times or for any “retired military officer,” nor did it authorize them to make any such claims or representations,” the statement said. </p>
<p>The statement said XRVision did identify some of the individuals at the Capitol as affiliates of “known Nazi organizations,” but not as antifa activists. </p>
<p>The Washington Times later corrected its story and apologized to XRVision in a statement.</p>
<p>The Associated Press on Wednesday debunked another false claim that a shirtless rioter wearing a fur cap with horns at the Capitol was an antifa activist. That man has voiced his support for Trump at rallies in recent months.</p>
<p>This is part of The Associated Press’ ongoing effort to fact-check misinformation that is shared widely online, including work with Facebook to identify and reduce the circulation of false stories on the platform.</p>

<p>“He means to kidnap, restrain, perhaps try, perhaps execute members of the U.S. government,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Weimer said. “His prior experience and training make him all the more dangerous.”</p>
<p>Federal authorities on Friday also arrested Dominic Pezzola, a 43-year-old former Marine from New York who identified himself on social media as being a member of the Proud Boys.</p>
<p>“I was a private citizen and doing everything right and within my rights,” Rainey said.</p>
<p>More than 125 people have been arrested so far on charges related to the Capitol riot, ranging from curfew violations to serious federal felonies related to theft and weapons possession.</p>
<p>The FBI is warning of the potential for more bloodshed. In an internal bulletin issued Sunday, the bureau warned of plans for armed protests at all 50 state capitals and in Washington, D.C., in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>“I’m basically the substitute camera,” Williams said, emphasizing that she’s “not using artistic license to move anything around.”</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Israel sets COVID-19 record amid zigzag policy and 4th jab</h4></a></div></li>

<a>to hear her speak French to her siblings.</a>
<a>which ended with last week’s conviction, </a> Williams says she produced around 100 sketches of witness testimony, attorney arguments, jurors, the judge, spectators and, above all, the defendant herself.
<p>Jeffrey Epstein, by contrast, was “incredibly fidgety.” Williams drew Epstein, <a>the ex-boyfriend-turned-employer of Maxwell,</a> at his unsuccessful bail hearings before his 2019 jailhouse suicide.</p>
<p>Here, Williams takes the AP through her sketchpad, coloring in the key moments of Maxwell’s trial with her behind-the-scenes observations:</p>
<p>Williams prefers a wall between herself and subjects: “I don’t like to become friendly with anybody I’m drawing. I’m looking at them as they’re a news story to me and I want them to stay that way.”</p>
<p>Maxwell breached that divide, attracting some attention for drawing the courtroom artists themselves. A meta sketch by Reuters artist Jane Rosenberg of Maxwell drawing her even went viral.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘OK, that’s fine. Do what you want to. But it’s not going to affect anything I do,’” Williams said.</p>
<p>Williams said Maxwell would occasionally purposefully pose, something that actually served the artist’s purposes.</p>
<p>“It’s much more captivating to have somebody, they’re looking right at the camera, or they’re looking right at the artist, and so people looking at the drawing are seeing somebody looking right at them,” Williams said.</p>
<p>The dynamic continued through the last day of the trial, when Maxwell seemed buoyed by a jury note hours before the verdict.</p>
<a> case revolved around four accusers,</a> three who testified under pseudonyms or using just first names — Jane, Kate and Carolyn. The courtroom artists were instructed not to draw likenesses, which, for Williams, meant avoiding facial features.
<p>The hands are another key, she said.</p>
<p>Jane wasn’t that animated while testifying about how Epstein grabbed her, Williams said. </p>
<p>Carolyn’s hands were particularly eye-catching.</p>
<p>A courtroom artist has to stay alert for big moments, even when a witness might not seem like a headliner.</p>
<p>An FBI analyst’s testimony yielded one of the more bizarre images from the trial, as prosecutors displayed a photograph the analyst had found that appeared to show Maxwell massaging Epstein’s foot with her breasts.</p>
<p>Williams knew that was her shot, so much so that she had no time to gauge Maxwell’s reaction.</p>
<p>“I have to tell you the truth. When I saw that, I was so focused on getting it down, I thought, I can’t, I couldn’t focus on her. I had to focus on drawing this thing,” she said. </p>
<p>The photographs were shown for what seemed like a maximum of seven seconds, “meaning I’m drawing like the wind.”</p>
<p>A government official sitting in front of Williams even turned around at one point, she said, to commend the way she captured that scene.</p>
<p>Maxwell constantly communicated with her lawyers and engaged in daily displays of physical affection with them.</p>
<p>“Oh my God. Hug fest. All those attorneys got hugs,” Williams said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”</p>
<p>Williams said she did notice Maxwell start to get slightly more agitated as the trial wore on, but her stoicism returned when the verdict was read.</p>
<p>“She put her hand up to kind of her head and her lawyer put his hand on her back,” Williams said. “And that was it. That was it. There was no other reaction.”</p>
<p>That day, there were no hugs for the attorneys as she was ushered out.</p>
<p>Williams began her career as a trained fashion illustrator.</p>
<p>“So Maxwell is right up my alley,” she said. “Whenever she walked into court, with the two U.S. marshals, she always made an entrance like she was walking down a runway, I swear to God.” </p>
<p>Williams said the British socialite made her presence apparent in the way she held herself, arms back, “her swagger, swaying a little bit.”</p>
<p>Her exits could also leave an impression, including her final one as she <a>strode out of the courtroom after the verdict.</a></p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — “Where are they?” a Trump supporter demanded in a crowd of dozens roaming the halls of the Capitol, bearing Trump flags and pounding on doors.</p>
<p>They — lawmakers, staff members and more — were hiding under tables, hunkered in lockdowns, saying prayers and seeing the fruits of the country’s divisions up close and violent.</p>
<p>Guns were drawn. A woman was shot and killed by police, and three others died in apparent medical emergencies. A Trump flag hung on the Capitol. The graceful Rotunda reeked of tear gas. Glass shattered. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, hallowed spaces of American democracy, one after another, yielded to the occupation of Congress.</p>
<p> The pro-Trump mob took over the presiding officer’s chair in the Senate, the offices of the House speaker and the Senate dais, where one yelled, “Trump won that election.” </p>
<a>Joe Biden’s</a> victory. It devolved into scenes of fear and agony that left a prime ritual of American democracy in tatters.
<p>Trump told his morning crowd at the Ellipse that he would go with them to the Capitol, but he didn’t. Instead he sent them off with incendiary rhetoric.</p>
<p>“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” he said. “Let the weak ones get out,” he went on. “This is a time for strength.”</p>
<p>His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told the crowd, “Let’s have trial by combat.”</p>
<p>Sasse went on: “Lies have consequences. This violence was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the president’s addiction to constantly stoking division.”</p>
<p>Police said they recovered two pipe bombs, one outside the Democratic National Committee and one outside the Republican National Committee and a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on Capitol grounds.</p>
<p>Yet Trump, in a video posted 90 minutes after lawmakers were evacuated, told the insurrectionists “We love you. You’re very special,” while asking them to go home.</p>
<p>Authorities eventually regained control as night fell.</p>

<p>She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died. </p>
<p>Announcements blared: Due to an “external security threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recording said. A loud bang sounded as officials detonated a suspicious package to make sure it was not dangerous.</p>
<p>It was about 1:15 p.m. when New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas, a Democrat, said Capitol Police banged on his door and “told us to drop everything, get out as quickly as we could.”</p>
<p>“It was breathtaking how quickly law enforcement got overwhelmed by these protesters,” he told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Shortly after 2 p.m., Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Vice President Mike Pence were evacuated from the Senate as protesters and police shouted outside the doors. </p>
<p>“Protesters are in the building,” were the last words picked up by a microphone carrying a live feed of the Senate before it shut off.</p>
<p>Police evacuated the chamber at 2:30 p.m., grabbing boxes of Electoral College certificates as they left. </p>
<p>Phillips yelled at Republicans, “This is because of you!”</p>
<p>Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., told reporters he was in the House chamber when protesters began storming it. He said security officers urged lawmakers to put gas masks on and herded them into a corner of the massive room.</p>
<p>Shortly after being told to put on gas masks, most members were quickly escorted out of the chamber. But some members remained in the upper gallery seats, where they had been seated due to distancing requirements.</p>
<p>As he walked out of the Capitol, Himes said he had lived in Latin America and “always assumed it could never happen here.</p>
<p>Democratic Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley was also in the balcony. “It’s not good to be around terrified colleagues, with guns drawn toward people who have a barricade ... people crying. Not what you want to see,” he said. </p>
<p>“This is how a coup is started,” said Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif. “This is how democracy dies.”</p>

<div><div><h1>General: Pentagon hesitated on sending Guard to Capitol riot</h1></div><div>By ERIC TUCKER and MARY CLARE JALONICKMarch 3, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>“The Army senior leadership” expressed “that it would not be their best military advice to have uniformed Guardsmen on the Capitol,” Walker said.</p>

<p>Walker’s testimony, however, conflicts a bit with timelines that were put out and discussed by senior military and defense leaders in the weeks after the riot. </p>
<p>The Pentagon said Miller, the acting Defense secretary, gave verbal authorization for the Guard troops to deploy at about 4:30 p.m., and that at 5:02 p.m., 154 members of the D.C. Guard left the armory, heading to the Capitol. </p>
<p>Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., said during a break in the hearing that senators “certainly will have questions” for Miller and for former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.</p>

<a>FBI Director Christopher Wray</a> said the report was disseminated through the FBI’s joint terrorism task force, discussed at a command post and posted on an internet portal available to law enforcement agencies.
<p>Though the information was raw and unverified, Wray said, it was specific and concerning enough that “the smartest thing to do, the most prudent thing to do, was just push it to the people who needed to get it.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — As the rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, many of the police officers had to decide on their own how to fight them off. There was no direction. No plan. And no top leadership. </p>
<p>Three officers were able to handcuff one rioter. But a crowd swarmed the group and took the arrested man away with the handcuffs still on.</p>
<p>“We were on our own,” one of the officers told The Associated Press. “Totally on our own.” </p>
<p>Three officers told the AP they did not hear Chief Steven Sund on the radio the entire afternoon. It turned out he was sheltering with Vice President Mike Pence in a secure location for some of the siege. Sund resigned the next day. </p>
<p>His assistant chief, Yogananda Pittman, who is now interim chief, was heard over the radio telling the force to “lock the building down,” with no further instructions, two officers said. </p>
<p>Johnson, who could not be reached for comment, was heard by an officer on the radio repeatedly asking, “Does anybody have a plan?”</p>
<p>Despite plenty of online warnings of a possible insurrection and ample resources and time to prepare, the Capitol Police planned only for a free speech demonstration on Jan. 6. </p>
<p>The riot left five people dead, including Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was hit in the head by a fire extinguisher. Another officer died in an apparent suicide after the attack.</p>
<p>Top decision-makers have offered differing explanations for why they didn’t have enough personnel. </p>
<p> <a>It’s not clear why the threat was not taken more seriously. </a> </p>
<a>he said in his testimony. </a> “The intersection of constitutional rights and legitimate law enforcement has never been more at risk by domestic actors as it is now as seditionists actively promote a revolution.”
<p>Tens of thousands of National Guard members have now been called to secure the Capitol in advance of the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Capitol Police did not respond to questions Friday. </p>
<p>Another officer said he was only told that morning to pick up a riot helmet. He said he had training on dealing with large crowds, but not on how to handle a riot.</p>
<p>“We were under the impression it was just going to be a lot of yelling, cursing,” he said. </p>
<p>As Trump called on his supporters to go to the Capitol, telling them to “fight like hell,” members of the House and Senate were inside the building to certify Biden’s victory over Trump in the Electoral College.</p>
<p>Crowds of Trump supporters, many of them linked to far-right or white supremacist groups, began gathering on both sides of the Capitol.</p>
<p>Videos from the event show the crowd climbing the walls on the western side and eventually breaching the building.</p>
<p>“The group came and snatched him and took him away in cuffs,” one officer said. “Outside of shooting people, what are you supposed to do?”</p>
