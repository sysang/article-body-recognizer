<header> <h1> The tech trends to watch in 2022 </h1> <p> The pandemic forced us to rely on technology more than ever - but what does the new year hold in store? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matthew Field and James Titcomb <time> 31 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>As technology advances, it is anyone’s guess what craze 2022 might hold. </p>
<p>Here are our predictions for the top 10 tech trends to watch out for next year:</p>
<h2>Matthew Field’s picks</h2>

<header> <h1> Tesla rival races to introduce driverless cars by 2024 </h1> <p> Sensor maker Mobileye aims to beat Elon Musk's technology for accuracy by using radar </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Titcomb <time> 2 January 2022 • 5:15pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Making predictions about technology is a notoriously dangerous sport, and the onset of driverless cars is a particularly perilous thing to forecast.</p>
<p>Google once pledged that the public would be able to buy robot vehicles from 2020 - a deadline that Toyota, General Motors and Honda also imposed on themselves.</p>
<p>In 2016, Elon Musk announced that a Tesla would be able to drive itself between the US coasts within a year, a feat that remains unaccomplished.</p>
<p>Uber’s founder Travis Kalanick once declared that autonomous taxis were critical to the company’s future; in 2020 the ride-sharing app sold off its driverless car arm to focus on profitability.</p>
<p>The safe thing to do might be to call off such predictions altogether, but Amnon Shashua is sticking to his.</p>
<p>Some time in the year 2024, Shashua forecasts, you will be able to buy a new car from a garage, plug in your address and let it drive you home. His company, Mobileye, will be the chauffeur.</p>
<p>“We know today what we need for a fully autonomous car, because we have been developing one for the past four or five years,” says Shashua.</p>
<p>From early versions of its technology such as automatic braking and headlights to more advanced modern features that have included lane keeping and adaptive cruise control, Mobileye’s systems have gradually made cars smarter.</p>
<p>The company recently celebrated the 100-millionth car sold with its system, known as EyeQ.</p>
<p>After excitement over driverless cars peaked half a decade ago, investment in the technology, and progress, has seemingly stalled.</p>
<p>Waymo, the Google spin-out that has long been seen as a leader, has largely confined its tests over the past five years to the flat, open and dry roads of Phoenix, Arizona. Analysts have downgraded estimates of its value.</p>
<p>Mobileye, meanwhile, may have tripled in value since 2016, when the <a>US microchip giant Intel paid $15bn</a> (£11bn) for the company.</p>
<p>In December, Intel revealed that it planned to float a minority stake in Mobileye next year and it is now estimated to be worth up to $50bn, although the huge economic gains promised by driverless car optimists suggest the bull case is much higher.</p>
<p>The company puts its success down to an altogether different approach to those of Waymo and Cruise, the rival start-up backed by General Motors.</p>
<a>artificial intelligence software</a> would improve to the extent that driver assistance systems would be able to operate using a smart camera - or eye - that can spot pedestrians, traffic and road signs.
<p>Today, these systems come far cheaper than the hefty “lidar” modules used by Waymo and others, making them far more palatable to carmakers and consumers on a mass scale.</p>
<p>“What Mobileye did right from the beginning is we thought the holy grail is scale. Otherwise it becomes a science experiment,” says Shashua. “The cost is really a crucial element.”</p>
<p>He says that by 2024, all the equipment needed for a fully driverless system should cost between $4,000 and $5,000. “It’s worth that to be able to push a button and go to sleep.”</p>
<p>Mobileye’s success is not just critical to Intel’s shareholders. Many of its carmaker customers are relying on it to keep up with Tesla, which has been developing its own driverless technology and allowing owners to test it out.</p>
<a> Autopilot</a>, its driver assistance system used to control speed and stay within a lane, Shashua broke off a supply agreement between the two companies due to disagreements about how Elon Musk’s giant used Mobileye’s systems.
<p>The move came shortly after <a>the first death linked to Tesla’s Autopilot</a>, which Shashua said influenced his company’s decision.</p>
<p>Shashua says unlike today’s Teslas, which rely entirely on cameras, Mobileye’s driverless system will incorporate radar and other sensors, which aim to dramatically reduce how often they fail.</p>
<p>“It shows that if you provide, for $10,000, a true level four [close to fully driverless] vehicle, people will buy it.”</p>
<p>It is not just technology that needs to improve for Mobileye’s dream to be realised, however. Regulations must follow, and while governments have promised to overhaul laws for a <a>driverless future</a>, following through is less simple.</p>
<p>Sensitivities around safety suggest that Shashua would push for cautious rule-making on self-driving cars, but he says the real risk is that politicians move too slowly.</p>
<p>“I think too much regulatory oversight would stop technological innovation. Limiting technological progress would end up damaging lives rather than saving lives.”</p>
<p>Instead, he says, responsibility will ultimately rest on motorists. “People should be accountable. They're all adults. They should know not to play a guitar while it’s on autopilot.”</p>
<h1> Ford Ranger Raptor: the £50,000 pick-up that challenges the bounds of commercial vehicles </h1>
<p> The Raptor is a pick-up that's been given super-butch upgrades by the same team that did the Ford GT supercar, but is it worth the money? </p>
<div> <div> By Jeremy Taylor <time> 23 November 2021 • 2:27pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Long term test: With picks-ups now increasingly about style and swagger, is the Raptor (surely the most excessive of any) actually now more of an alternative to the ubiquitous large SUV than it is to more utilitarian commercial vehicles? </p>
<ul><li>Our car: Ford Ranger Raptor</li><li>List price when new: £50,655</li><li>Price a s tested: £52,275</li><li>Official fuel economy: 31.7mpg</li><li>Fuel economy on test: 26mpg</li></ul>
<p>Stuck on a boat, delayed in transit, held up by Covid restrictions – six months after our Raptor was due to arrive, Ford’s humungous pick-up with attitude has crashed on to my driveway in the nick of time.</p>
<p>On the face of it, a pick-up is a refreshing alternative to the ubiquitous SUVs which dominate sales in the UK. The high-riding position, cavernous load area and standard four-wheel drive tick every box.</p>
<p>Not only that, the Raptor actually doesn’t qualify as VAT-free (like most pick-ups) because mechanical modifications to the suspension and other areas mean that it doesn’t qualify as a light commercial vehicle (LCV).</p>
<p>The front and rear wheel arches have a 15cm wider track, allowing Ford to fit chunky, 33-inch General Grabber tyres. Fox Racing shock absorbers soak up uneven terrain, while aluminium suspension arms allow increased travel in the rough stuff.</p>
<p>The squat, wide stance really beefs up the macho image, while parts of the extensively modified suspension peek out ominously underneath. Together with an aluminium sump guard, there’s no doubting what the Raptor has been designed to do.</p>
<p>I drove the Ford on a four-hour return journey to Shropshire. I can’t imagine anything more formidable than a Raptor coming around a corner to meet you on a single-track road. It has incredible presence.</p>
<p>Less impressive is on-road comfort. On a winding A-road, the suspension isn’t calibrated for comfort, with a wallow and pitch that eventually left me longing for a flat, straight motorway.</p>
<p>The load area is also high and my ancient hound can’t quite clear the tailgate. Instead, he’s taken to the back seats, where (human) leg and head room are plentiful.</p>
<p>What I need now is an obliging farmer to let the Raptor prove its worth. While my builder chums are all green with envy, the jury is out on whether this heavily modified Ford is really worth the extra spend.</p>
<h3>Health warning: This car is not what it seems</h3>
<p>So to all those drivers who sent their blood pressure soaring encountering my Raptor, just remember what’s under that huge bonnet – a sluggish, 213hp four-cylinder diesel, chugging up to motorway speeds via a 10-speed automatic gearbox.</p>
<p>And that’s unlikely to change, even with Ford set to reveal a new generation Raptor in the US that will be closely related to the VW Amorak, part of a strategic deal to share platforms on a range of commercial vehicles.</p>
<p>Every drive becomes an adventure – especially squeezing into another UK-sized parking bay (the bodywork is 50mm wider than a regular Ranger) or trying to reach a diesel pump with another vehicle parked next to you.</p>
<p>Our Raptor currently spends most of its life in two-wheel drive but there are four low and high ratios longing to be used. I hope to put that right this month when I hope Ford’s suspension wizardry will finally come into its own off-road.</p>
<p>Over the last month together we’ve covered more than 1,200 miles, including a trip to Scotland and the Lake District, when the 1.5-metre square load-bay swallowed up enough camping equipment for a family of four.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the space was completely full as items otherwise tend to slide around on the hard, plastic floor. The moulded fitting is brutal on knees too, just in case you plan to scramble on board and pack your Raptor to the hilt.</p>
<h2>Jurassic Park – It’s a Velociraptor</h2>
<p>When I’m out and about I generally try and park the Raptor somewhere it isn’t going to offend anyone. Those quiet corners of a supermarket car park, where it doesn’t matter if you take up two spaces instead of one.</p>
<p>The Raptor’s aggressive vibe might mean something if it could be brutally quick on road. Instead, this is a 2.5 ton behemoth that would barely manage to beat a Nissan Micra in a drag race.</p>
<p>At risk of angering some readers, it’s fair to assume most Raptor owners are likely to be men. The big Ford is more macho than a wrestler’s jockstrap.</p>
<p>Even clinging to the grab handles on the inside of the windscreen pillars won’t help. At least once everybody is on board, the view from inside is as high and commanding as a Range Rover (minus the luxuries, of course).</p>
<p>On the subject of practicalities, the Raptor’s flat-bed lining is moulded from hard plastic, cut in deep grooves, like a toast rack. It is fantastically hard-wearing for building materials but brutal on the knees for lifestyle luvvies.</p>
<p>Luxuries are few and far between and in truth, the Raptor doesn’t feel like a £50,000 vehicle. Hard plastics dominate the interior and no amount of blue contrast stitching – a match for the paintwork – can gloss over that.</p>
<p>However, another key topic of chat has been VAT, which cannot be reclaimed on the Raptor because of the performance modifications and reduced payload. Whatever job you have, don’t expect a 20 per cent reduction when the taxman comes calling.</p>
<p>There’s also the issue of the modest 2.0-litre, EcoBlue diesel engine – the only unit offered for UK buyers. The 213bhp simply doesn’t give a pick-up that looks this butch enough bite to go with the bark.</p>
<p>Combine that with the cost of replacing those BF Goodrich off-road tyres, off-road suspension parts, plus higher insurance, and you might wonder if a regular Ford Ranger might prove a smarter financial choice.</p>
<p>Somehow, though, the Raptor retains huge appeal, even if it makes no financial or practical sense whatsoever. It will get you noticed, it does make you feel like the king of the off-road although I think Ford has missed a trick here. </p>
<p>Had it built a VAT-free pick-up with a most substantial engine to match, the Raptor could have been king of the on-road, too.</p>

<div> <div> By Vicky Parrott <time> 15 December 2021 • 2:47pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Our car: Vauxhall Mokka-e Elite Premium</p>
<p>List price when new: £32,080 (after £2,500 Government plug-in car grant)</p>
<p>Price as tested: £33,430 (incl. Mamba Green paint at £650 and IntelliLux LED lights at £700)</p>
<p>Official range: 201 miles </p>
<p>Complete with Luton’s new ‘vizor’ grille and contrast roof, it really does look sharp and I’m often finding myself doing the car park nod of appreciation.</p>
<h2>Take a seat, just not this one</h2>
<p>Anyway, with that whinge out of the way, the Mokka-e is otherwise proving a very competent EV and family car, so I'll learn to live with the seat and carry on enjoying the rest of it. </p>
<p>It’s time to talk about the electric car stuff that remains the chief concern for most buyers – range and charging.</p>
<p>Most charging happens at home for me. My trusty 7kW PodPoint home charger will fully charge the Mokka-e in under eight hours, and thankfully you can set delayed charging easily via the car’s screen to make the most of off-peak tariffs.</p>

<header> <h1> Land Rover Defender: nothing like the old one but that’s fine with me </h1> <p> Comparisons with the old, much-loved Defender are not all this new version has to live up to </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jeremy Taylor <time> 21 December 2021 • 4:32pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Land Rover Defender 90 on long-term test: Iconic, legendary, unstoppable – the original Defender had it all but the new version is aimed at a softer driving, SUV-loving audience. Can the short-wheelbase 90 live up to expectations?</p>
<p>Our car: Land Rover Defender 90 D250 SE</p>
<p>List price when new: £51,205 </p>
<p>Price as tested: £61,125</p>
<p>Official fuel economy: 32.8 mpg</p>
<p>Fuel economy on test: 27 mpg</p>
<p>Prising a Defender out of Land Rover these days isn’t easy. Chocolates, flowers, gentle cajoling – the waiting list for eager buyers is currently up to a year, so that means “get to the back of the queue” for the rest of us.</p>
<a>short-wheelbase 90 model</a>, used to film an episode of Top Gear in Scotland. This particular car has, therefore, probably suffered more abuse in a week than the average buyer could dish out in a lifetime.
<a>commercial Defender</a>, plus VAT. Why? The company says this is due to the microchip shortage which has reduced its offering, along with pretty much all manufacturers.
<p>The £10k of extras on this car includes the all-important electronic air suspension (£1,615), which replaces the standard coil-spring set-up but is now standard on the HSE.</p>
<p>Other additional features include a tow pack (£2,200), Tracker security system (£745) and, best of all, a huge folding fabric roof (£1,800) that gives everybody on board a blast of Vitamin D.</p>
<p>It actually does everything my old Defender can do but is so technologically advanced by comparison that there really is no comparison. The 90 is a thoroughly modern, hugely capable machine that is more luxury SUV than mud-flinging workhorse.</p>
<p>Yet, if we can accept old and new Defender design is literally decades apart, that most new model buyers will likely use less than a tenth of its capabilities, then the latest Land Rover looks a very attractive family car indeed.</p>
<p>Priced in excess of £50,000 – if you can work out the model specifications – you might expect nothing less. The 90 has personality by the boot-load, although that area of the car has also been its undoing in my stewardship. </p>
<p>As first impressions go, our 90 got off to a bad start, thanks to a dodgy boot handle. And not just any handle, new Defender features a touch sensitive pad and soft-close system that supposedly takes the effort out of the whole operation.</p>
<p>Visually, I don’t think the silver paint works well with the white wheels and the fancy ClearSight rear-view mirror, that uses a camera system to relay images to the driver, just isn’t as intuitive to use as reflective glass. </p>
<p>But I’m also driving the 90 more than my old Landie and enjoying the comforts, while still feeling adventurous when the moment takes me. This really is a Defender for a new generation.</p>
<p>Has Land Rover really gone soft with the new, user-friendly Defender? As far as I can work out, not a bit of it. If you want proof, simply open the heavyweight driver’s door. It could have been carved from granite.</p>
<p>Reminiscent of a 1980s Mercedes – the last of the properly built Mercs – you have to slam the thing shut with a reassuring thud. But unlike the original Defender, there’s also no need to open the window for a slice of elbow room.</p>
<h2>Charmed, I’m sure</h2>
<p>But whichever model and spec you choose, this Land Rover has the almost unique ability to make every journey feel like an adventure. I never thought I’d say this, but it genuinely has the necessary Defender DNA to be a future classic, too.</p>

<a>Aston Martin DB5</a>, and in a way Roger Moore never would.
<p>Of course, Triumph is no stranger to landmark films, dating back to <a>1953’s The Wild One</a> starring <a>Marlon Bando. </a>Steve McQueen’s famous “jump” in The Great Escape was shot around the time Dr. No came out. </p>
<p>How Bond evolves beyond Craig’s portrayal will be fascinating to behold, but given the thrilling character-led sequences these bikes lend, chances are good that two-wheeled transport remains part of the formula. </p>

<header> <h1> Portable airbags for motorcyclists now a realistic option </h1> <p> Airbags were not considered essential riding kit due to their weight, expense and impracticality – but recent advances could change all that </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Adam Wheeler <time> 4 November 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Apparently, it will fire above speeds of 25kph (15.5mph) in Street mode but that limit is raised to 100kph (62mph) in Race configuration for the track. </p>
<p>The Tech-Air 5 set-up will require an investment of around £650, which is quite an outlay for even the most safety-conscious rider, who will have also purchased a premium helmet and protective clothing. </p>
<p>The recharging requirement is a moot point in an age where we charge phones, watches and tablets overnight anyway.</p>
<p>Yet other questions remain. How durable are the electronics and hardware? Can the lining be detachable for easier cleaning in future versions? Will Apps be supported and updated over the years? </p>
<p>Buying, wearing and using an airbag has never been easier or more accessible but one can only wonder what something like Tech-Air will look like after another few years of development.</p>
<h1> How MotoGP’s new young marvel ‘grew up’ to make championship history </h1>
<p> Fabio Quartararo has delivered France’s first ever premier class world title but the 22-year-old had to mature quickly to overcome adversity </p>
<div> <div> By Adam Wheeler <time> 26 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Quartararo then received factory backing for 2020 and claimed the opening two races of the year as his principal foe, Marquez, entered a long sequence of operations, recuperation and repercussions from a broken right arm. </p>
<p>“After that you can go faster. That’s what I need. Some other riders need that from, say, the rear. I’m more on the front. Also, for overtaking… it is a really important thing for me.” </p>
<p>“You need to think while you are riding fast,” he asserts.</p>
<p>“I think this was part of my maturity and growing-up and it was nice for me to win this year, in what was a difficult year for Yamaha. I’m proud of that.”</p>
<p>Yamaha’s Motor Racing’s MD, Lin Jarvis, opined: “He is somebody that is full of positivity and energy and focus. He is quite ‘light’, I would say.</p>
<p>He recalls: “I won in Silverstone and had a really good race in Misano and then there were only four to go when we went to Austin and Pecco was on fire at that moment.</p>

<header> <h1> 10 best UK road trips you must experience in your lifetime </h1> <p> On four wheels or two, these routes open up some of the UK's most incredible destinations </p> </header>
<div> <div> By David Williams, Travel writer <time> 22 November 2021 • 9:44am </time> </div> </div>
<p>There's no better time to plan a spring UK road trip. Begin by plotting a winding route and then get set to head for some of the most beautiful scenery the British Isles has to offer.</p>
<p>Whether it's novelty or history that you are after, here are 10 of the best British drives for 2022.</p>
<h2>1. Isle of Arran Coastal Road, Scotland</h2>
<p>Why do it? It’s like Scotland in miniature, with a hint of the Med.</p>
<p>Top tip: Don’t feel obliged to stick to the coastal route; there are soaring, deserted mountain roads, too, if you head inland – so make time for both.</p>
<h2>2. Hardknott Pass, the Lake District</h2>
<p>Best for: Confident drivers with a head for heights.</p>
<p>Why do it? To test your driving skills with hills and hairpin bends.</p>
<h2>3. The Sussex, Hampshire and Wiltshire circuit</h2>
<p>Best for: Motor racing enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Why do it? For vintage motorsport – and vintage wine at the end.</p>
<a>Cotswolds </a>– and the chance to visit three famous racing circuits.
<p>Top tip: The route is best enjoyed in two stages with a night in Winchester. Stay at the original Hotel du Vin Bistro, an elegant Georgian red-brick in the heart of the city. Rooms from £108; <a>read our expert review</a>.</p>
<h2>4. Wild and coastal Devon</h2>
<p>Best for: Bend-loving motorcyclists.</p>
<p>Why do it? To take in the best of coast and countryside, breaking your journey with a sumptuous hotel stay.</p>
<p>Kingswear Lower Ferry carries you to Dartmouth, with its dazzling harbour views. Then the A379 delivers its biggest punch of all as it climbs and narrows, offering dizzying vistas across Blackpool Sands and then Slapton Sands.</p>
<p>Best for: Open-top motoring fans.</p>
<p>Why do it? For unforgettable views of Lulworth Cove and the famed Osmington White Horse.</p>
<p>What to expect: A combination of dramatic coastline, sleepy inland villages, rolling hills and – if you time it right – deserted roads makes this drive a classic to savour.</p>
<p>More information: <a>visit-dorset.com</a></p>
<p>Best for: Grand tourers.</p>
<p>Why do it? For long coastal views – and longer sandy beaches.</p>
<p>The route: Start in Norwich for a dash of cathedral culture and history, before hitting the road to Salhouse for a view of the Broads, then wind your way back to the faster A140, heading north to the dazzling coast. </p>
<p>Top tip: Pack a satnav or a good road atlas and if you encounter busy coastal stretches, wander off the beaten track and zigzag inland.</p>
<p>Best for: Sports car fans.</p>
<p>Why do it? To travel back in time as you pass through perfectly preserved English villages.</p>
<p>What to expect: This 80-mile exploration packs in fabulous bends, far-reaching views and forgotten back roads that let you believe you are the only tourist in the Cotswolds.</p>
<p>Take the A429 via Stow in the Wold, following signs to the “Slaughters”, arriving first at picturesque Lower Slaughter then Upper Slaughter.</p>
<p>Follow Rodborough Hill to Stroud, then the A46/B4070 to Slad and Laurie Lee’s favourite pub, the Woolpack, the spiritual home of the Cotswolds.</p>
<p>Top tip: Don’t be afraid to vary your route, relying on sat-nav to hop from village to village. It’s part of the fun.</p>
<h2>8. Northern Ireland’s most beautiful road</h2>
<p>Best for: Novelty seekers.</p>
<p>Why do it? To see geological wonders, including the Giant’s Causeway.</p>
<p>What to expect: This 130-mile route offers pure driving pleasure as it follows the rugged contours of the Northern Ireland coast beneath overhanging cliffs and past craggy rocks jutting into the sea.</p>
<h2>9. Wild Snowdonia, Wales</h2>
<p>Best for: The stout of heart and leg.</p>
<p>Why do it? For epic views of Mount Snowdon – and a night at a tranquil riverside hotel.</p>
<p>What to expect: This 70-mile route has mountains, moors, coastline, pretty villages, steam trains, waterfalls, steep climbs and descents, plus the chance to climb Snowdon on foot if you’re up to it.</p>
<p>The route: Magical Portmeirion, a fantasy village “born” in 1925, makes the perfect starting point before heading through pretty Porthmadog and Tremadog, then taking the A498 and winding B4410 through Rhyd.</p>
<p>Whizz past – or, better still, climb – Mount Snowdon before a 20-minute drive to macho, muscle-bound Caernarvon Castle, standing defiantly at the mouth of the Seiont River.</p>
<h2>10. The Peak District</h2>
<p>Best for: History lovers.</p>
<p>Why do it? For an educational tour of stately homes, a gracious spa town and feats of Victorian engineering.</p>
<p>What to expect: The route encompasses 60 or so miles of exciting views, challenging bends, steep climbs and heartbeat-raising descents, with lots of opportunities to learn about historic buildings, bridges and viaducts along the way.</p>
<p>Top tip: Don’t go too fast on Snake Pass, where there are speed traps.</p>

<a>2002 Aston Martin DB7 Vantage Volante</a> convertible and a soft-top 1973 MG Midget. Robinson is considering making available a convertible 1981 Mercedes 380SL alongside them.
<p>Further north, in the Scottish Borders, the dog-friendly Trigony House Hotel has partnered with a local car-hire company to offer some truly unusual driving options, including a 1937 Austin saloon (£210 for the day).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Perthshire, that festive favourite Gleneagles has its off-road driving experience involving Argocats and original Land Rover Defenders – and for younger drivers, mini Land Rover replicas (from £120 for 45 minutes).</p>
<p>The hotel has just opened its Courtyard rooms, converted from the original 1920s chauffeur garages. At that time, Henry Ford was an unexpected guest after he became lost traversing the New Forest, having arrived by liner at nearby Southampton.</p>
<p>Traffic-clogged Knightsbridge and Park Lane may not match the visceral thrill of the B4391 through the Berwyn Mountains, but they still make for a fittingly festive treat.</p>
