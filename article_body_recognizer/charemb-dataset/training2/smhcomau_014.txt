<div>‘Can’t absorb more costs’: Small businesses say government should fund RATs</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Small business owners say they will not be able to absorb the cost of providing rapid antigen tests (RATs) to potentially COVID-exposed employees and are calling on the federal government to subsidise the tests.</p>
<p>Small businesses and industry bodies have hit back at this claim, saying that smaller employers do not have the capacity to deal with the costs and administration of supplying RATs to their staff.</p>
<p>Matt Bebe, the owner of Tar Barrel Brewery in the Melbourne suburb of Mornington, said while he had been trying to the “best of my abilities” to locate RATs for staff, they had been impossible to find.</p>
<p>His business employs between 15-20 staff, about 25 per cent of whom he says can be absent each week due to being symptomatic but unable to find a test, a situation he says has put the hospitality sector “on its knees”.</p>
<p>“To me, it’s not up to business. We need a controlled and systematic approach from the government rather than this scattergun approach that hasn’t been thought about and has left us so far behind the eight-ball.”</p>
<p>Peter Borain, chief executive of moving company MetroMovers, said small businesses were already stretched thin with the current Omicron outbreak and weren’t in the position to deal with the additional pressure of coordinating RATs for staff.</p>
<p>“Adding more burden onto us by saying we need to manage this and organise paying for and obtaining these tests, that’s an issue in itself,” he said. “It’s more issues and more distractions.”</p>
<p>“The government has got to be paying for this. Deliver them to us, and then we can hand them out.”</p>
<p>Access to RATs has been a major issue for both individuals and businesses over the past month as both state and federal governments have begun to rely on the tests more as the rapidly growing Omicron wave has overwhelmed traditional PCR testing.</p>
<p>Currently, workers in essential industries such as food supply can continue to work even when deemed a close contact of someone with COVID provided they test negative on RATs before each shift.</p>
<p>Major employees in these industries such as Coles and Woolworths have supplied workers with RATs when required, however even some of the country’s largest businesses have struggled to secure a reliable supply.</p>
<p>“We’re confident this work will result in our team getting the support that they need during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>Similarly, a spokesperson for Telstra said the business had also had some “initial challenges” finding RATs, the company currently had enough for workers in its critical divisions such as its triple zero call centre.</p>
<p>Alexi Boyd, the chief executive of small business industry body COSBOA, said the government should be looking at models similar to those of the UK’s, where citizens receive free RATs from the government.</p>
<p>She also called for better clarity for business owners over the requirements for testing of staff, saying current guidelines were vague and difficult to interpret.</p>
<p>“We’re calling for better understanding of when do workers need to be tested? When do they need to isolate? It’s all about answering all those questions,” Ms Boyd said.</p>

<div>Microsoft buys Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard in multibillion-dollar deal</div>
<p>Microsoft announced on Tuesday it was buying Activision Blizzard in a $US68.7 billion ($95 billion) deal that will unite two of the biggest forces in video games and create the world’s third-biggest gaming company.</p>
<p>Adding Activision’s stable of popular titles will help Microsoft expand its own offerings for the Xbox console and better compete with rival Sony’s PlayStation.</p>
<p>“With Activision’s stock under heavy pressure (CEO related issues/overhang) over the last few months, Microsoft viewed this as the window of opportunity to acquire a unique asset that can propel its consumer strategy forward.”</p>
<p>The scandal has taken a toll on a company already struggling to adapt to the end of a pandemic-fuelled video game boom.</p>
<p>Spencer said last November that Microsoft was reevaluating its relationship with Activision and making “proactive adjustments” in the wake of the Wall Street Journal report.</p>
<p>“We also recognise that after the close, we will have significant work to do in order to continue to build a culture where everyone can do their best work,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella on a call with investors.</p>
<p>The franchise is arguably Activision Blizzard’s most important business. In 2020, the company’s Activision segment – nearly all of which is Call of Duty – accounted for 55 per cent of the company’s operating profit.</p>
<p>But some of Activision’s games aren’t capturing the zeitgeist the way they once did. In 2021, Baird analysts published a report that revealed searches for Call of Duty and World of Warcraft were down markedly from the prior year.</p>
<p>Microsoft plans to keep making some of Activision’s games for PlayStation consoles but will also keep some content exclusive to Xbox, said a person familiar with the company’s thinking.</p>

<h3><a>‘Let’s get out’: Premier urges people to holiday as COVID cancellations bite</a></h3>
<p>Travel agents say increasing COVID-19 case numbers, which have forced thousands to isolate, have led to people cancelling bookings across the state.</p>
<div>‘No higher risk’: Melbourne Airport pushes to relax COVID-19 test rules</div>
<p>“What we’re calling on is the removal of that requirement because they [vaccinated inbound travellers] are no higher risk to the community, given we have so many cases within the community already,” Ms Argus said.</p>
<p>Travellers were at risk of being unnecessarily stranded abroad by returning a positive PCR test even after they were no longer contagious due to “viral shedding”, Ms Argus said.</p>
<p>Australians are also forced to wait 14 days before flying home after they test positive overseas if they are still “shedding”, despite positive cases in Australia only having to isolate for seven days.</p>
<p>Deakin University chair in epidemiology Catherine Bennett agreed that lifting the pre-flight testing requirement would make little difference for case numbers in Australia, provided travellers were still tested again on arrival.</p>
<p>“Especially given some ports of origin have lower rates than Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane at the moment, then it starts to become a margin gain in terms of protection,” Professor Bennett said.</p>
<p>The risk would increase for passengers on the plane, Professor Bennett said, “[but] that still tends to be low, and only impact people who happen to be sitting around someone who is positive”.</p>
<p>There have been numerous recorded cases of COVID-19 transmission on flights, but studies have suggested aircraft are relatively lower-risk environments because air inside the cabin is frequent filtered and replaced with outside air.</p>
<p>International travel remains severely depressed despite Australia reopening its border to citizens and residents on November 1 and subsequently to some types of visa holders.</p>

<div>Investors burst Redbubble shares after trading update</div>
<p>Online marketplace Redbubble’s share price was hammered during Tuesday’s session after it released a trading update that disappointed investors, making it the worst performer on the Australian sharemarket for the day.</p>
<p>“In an environment where Redbubble is a significant beneficiary of [the pandemic] … as you see those tailwinds normalise, the markets are becoming more competitive … margin expectations were unrealistic.”</p>
<p>The benchmark ASX 200 finished the day down 0.11 per cent, or 8.5 points to 7,408.8 points, despite being in green territory across the morning and early afternoon.</p>
<p>AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said the local bourse’s performance was a reflection of several elements influencing global markets at the moment.</p>
<p>“We did see a rally in oil, which added to concerns about inflation,” he added.</p>
<p>Pointsbet Holdings was the worse performer on the ASX 200, sliding 3.65 per cent to $6.08. Fintech company Zip Co was not far behind, losing 3.43 per cent to $3.66, followed by Virgin Money, which finished down 3.53 per cent at $3.55.</p>
<p>Materials, communication services and real estate were the best-performing sectors, contributing to the market’s positive performance earlier on in the day.</p>

<p>Heightened expectations of a rate hike from the Fed have kept Treasury yields rising. The 10-year Treasury hit 1.87 per cent Tuesday, the highest since January 2020. It was at 1.77 per cent late Friday.</p>
<p>Investors are now pricing in a better than 86 per cent probability that the Fed will raise short-term rates at its meeting of policymakers in March. A month ago, they saw less than a 47 per cent chance of that, according to CME Group.</p>
<p>While higher rates could help stem the high inflation sweeping the world, they would also mark an end to the conditions that have put financial markets in “easy mode” for many investors since early 2020.</p>

<p>Fortescue’s new eight-axle locomotives with an energy capacity of 14.5 megawatt-hours would be manufactured in Sete Lagoas, Brazil, the company said.</p>
<p>“The new locomotives will cut our emissions while also reducing our fuel costs and our overall operational expense through lower maintenance spend,” Fortescue chief executive Elizabeth Gaines said.</p>
<p>Distributed energy provider EDL, which built a 56-megawatt solar, wind and battery project to help power Western Australia’s Agnew gold mine, said the mining sector was making the “slow but sure transition to decarbonisation”</p>
<p>“Our Agnew Hybrid Renewable Microgrid at Gold Fields’ Agnew Gold Mine provides the mine with energy that is an average of 50-60 per cent from renewable sources, with 99.99 per cent reliability,” he said.</p>
<p>With its use of five wind turbines, the microgrid, which officially opened in November, is the first project in the industry to power a mine predominately with wind-powered electricity.</p>
<p>“Governments are setting more ambitious targets and accelerating actions on climate change,” Rio said in October. “Society at large is also demanding companies take more action to decarbonise.”</p>
<p>Fortescue, which generates more than 2 million tonnes of greenhouse gas a year, has been trialling technology in hydrogen, ammonia and battery power for trains, ship engines, haul trucks and drill rigs in a bid to achieve its target.</p>

<div>Australian miner Syrah seals Tesla deal amid dash for EV supplies</div>
<p>From Tesla to Volkswagen, car companies across the globe will need an ever-growing supply of battery ingredients to accelerate the rollout of electric vehicles, but markets for many of the raw materials are deeply under-supplied.</p>
<p>“The demand growth is such that security of long-term supply of raw materials and finished goods is absolutely critical for auto manufacturers and battery manufacturers to ensure they have a reliable supply chain in the future.”</p>
<p>“We’ve been engaged with a number of potential customers for multiple years, but really the last 12 months have seen a significant escalation of commercial discussions,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’ve been really clear, this first 10,000-tonne capacity facility is very much a first step.”</p>
<p>With China accounting for an estimated 85 per cent of anode material globally, there is an increasing focus among the EV sector and world governments on developing local supply chains, including in the US.</p>
<p>Commodity price reporting agency Fastmarkets said rising costs and tighter supply in China had driven graphite prices higher in December.</p>
<p>Analysts are now projecting EVs will account for 40 per cent of vehicle sales by 2030, fuelling a five-fold rise in demand for supplies of some raw materials.</p>

<p>It’s perfect for folks who are starting to find it difficult to follow the conversation in a crowded restaurant, or who have difficulty hearing the uni lecturer, but aren’t ready for (or don’t need) hearing aids.</p>
<p>Kindle Paperwhite ($239) Paper books have a magic to them, untouched by distractions of the outside world. Unfortunately, all magic has a mortal weakness, and for books that weakness is water.</p>
<p>Whichever gift you pick, I hope you and your loved ones have a wonderful and safe end to the year.</p>
<div>TikTok has given Instagram an identity crisis</div>
<div><div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>TikTok has given Instagram an identity crisis</h1></div><div><div><div><h5>Alice Clarke</h5>Journalist</div><div> <span><time>November 21, 2021 — 4.50pm</time></span></div></div></div></div>
<p>Social media can be wonderful. I mean, sure, it’s drastically undermined democracy and public health orders while facilitating the spread of conspiracy theories and misinformation.</p>
<p>But I just watched a video about a film called The VelociPastor: A Man Of The Claw, about a crime-fighting priest who turns into a dinosaur, so it’s probably worth it.</p>
<p>The only thing more interesting than the high-quality content that sometimes bubbles up on social media is how assorted platforms react when their supremacy is challenged.</p>
<p>TikTok hit one billion users in September, just five years after launching, making it one of the most-used and fastest-growing social media platforms.</p>
<p>That has Instagram and Facebook’s parent company, Meta, as well as Google’s YouTube, worried. Facebook, Instagram and YouTube took eight years to hit the one billion users mark. Twitter has yet to reach that milestone.</p>
<p>But Instagram decided to launch, and focus on, a new video feature, Reels, much to the chagrin of the dedicated Instagrammers who now had to master the video feature to keep their plum spot in the algorithm.</p>
<p>If these creators had to become experts in creating short videos to stay in their followers’ feeds, why wouldn’t they then take them to the big new platform?</p>
<p>Much like that “pivot to video”, this was completely avoidable. Instagram and TikTok didn’t need to compete. Instagram could have stayed the place for photos and TikTok could have been the place for short videos.</p>
<p>A social media platform is worse when it tries to be all things to all people, and changing the algorithm and focus of a photo-based app to try to capture users who prefer videos will just leave both audiences dissatisfied.</p>
<p>While TikTok has done some truly reprehensible things (like hide content from poor and “ugly” users), it knows what it is, its audience knows what it is, and it clearly does it well.</p>
<p>So what is Instagram trying to be now?</p>

<p>As the weather warms up and we begin to trade our winter coats for shorts, t-shirts and bathers, we must once more face the scourge that plagues the internet and women’s and fitness magazines this time of year.</p>
<p>Like my body, my neutrality still needs some work. But, even if I do suddenly find the time and money for a trainer and a balanced diet, I’m still not going to look like Katie McGrath, or any other professionally attractive person.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that not even Chris Hemsworth looks like Thor all the time, and even those Instagram models with the six-packs and perfect makeup don’t look like that first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>I find the idea that you don’t have to love or hate your body utterly revolutionary because sometimes just existing and getting from Point A to Point B is enough.</p>
<p>So, call a truce, it’s time to stop fighting your appearance. You exist, and that’s enough. Stop hating the parts of you the rest of the world gets to see. Self-hatred doesn’t burn calories or sculpt abs, it just makes you tired.</p>
<div>Why Christmas movies can help bring us together</div>
<div><div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>Why Christmas movies can help bring us together</h1></div><div><div><div><h5>Alice Clarke</h5>Journalist</div><div> <span><time>December 5, 2021 — 4.00pm</time></span></div></div></div></div>
<p>It’s the most wonderful time of the year: Christmas movie season.</p>
<p>I must admit, I’m not religious. I do, however, love cheesy movies, excessive amounts of turkey, and presents, so I’m very on board with Christmas as a concept.</p>
<p>Years ago, my wife suggested we watch some Christmas movies. We watched well over 100 that fateful year, and now, each year, we watch about 50. As a genre, it has some fascinating hallmarks (pun intended).</p>
<p>There are the famous Christmas movies most people think of: Love Actually, Home Alone and Miracle on 34th Street. High-quality movies with big budgets.</p>
<p>And then there are the hundreds, if not thousands, of (mostly) terrible American Christmas movies now available on our streaming services. Somehow, it’s the latter we always end up watching.</p>
<p>After much research I can now report that there are three branches of this type of Christmas movie:</p>
<p>Successful, single-city woman who hates Christmas has to go to a small town. There she will meet a man who is initially rude to her but eventually teaches her the meaning of Christmas.</p>
<p>And, finally, Christmas royalty: A commoner meets an extraordinarily rude person at work but fate keeps throwing them together until they fall in love – except he’s a prince from a Christmas Tree forest!</p>
<p>Netflix now has a film with a male lead who moves back to his hometown only to realise he loves his male best friend. Even Hallmark and Lifetime have added their first queer characters.</p>
<p>Given how bad Christmas movies are as a rule, one might wonder why so many people watch them. The answer is that they are like Christmas cracker jokes: most of them are so bad that in mocking and laughing at them, they can bring the family together.</p>

<p>’Tis the season to be jolly, and by jolly, I mean indulge in retail therapy under the guise of buying presents for our loved ones.</p>
<p>Either way, we’re all spending a lot of time in stores at the moment trying to find the perfect presents for our loved ones.</p>
<p>In other years this might see us flocking to big department stores, battling crowds and trying to find everything in the one place at the lowest price.</p>
<p>This year, I think we should try to make our gifts give twice: once to the recipient, and once to a small business who has had a particularly hellish 21 months.</p>
<p>This pandemic has been going on so long that no one is entirely sure how to measure it, but one thing is for sure – sustained lockdowns and economic uncertainty has made life really hard for small businesses.</p>
<p>We need to be turning away from the cheap and cheerful fast fashion made not to last by underpaid factory workers overseas and instead focus on fewer well-crafted pieces made with love by someone who will genuinely be thrilled by your purchase.</p>
<p>Most of us just have too much stuff these days, and too many things are treated as disposable, especially at Christmas, despite us all being aware of the ecological cost.</p>
<p>Even that family member who doesn’t care about the environment is at least mildly irritated by their lack of storage space caused by unwanted gifts.</p>
<p>Gifting experiences is also fantastic for people who already have everything. If you have a favourite restaurant that you know has been struggling, why not give a gift card or the promise of a meal out?</p>
<p>Artists have had an even tougher time with cancelled gigs and no JobKeeper, so why not give some Comedy Festival tickets for a lesser known comedian, or tickets for the theatre?</p>
<p>If you have a music lover in your life, head to a local independent record store and buy a CD or record of an Australian artist, or tickets to a gig (remember those?).</p>
<p>Not only is this going to make a struggling artist or small business owner’s day, but you get to discover great stores and artists around you, giving yourself the gift of community.</p>

<div>Disappointed with your ATAR? Here’s why it doesn’t matter</div>

<p>Congratulations to everyone who finished year 12 this year. VCE is a hard enough during normal times, and these are not those. If you got the ATAR score you wanted, then I’m so happy all your hard work has paid off.</p>
<p>This story, however, is for everyone else who is now trying to work out what comes next after their plans were dashed by a number that is supposed to represent the sum of what they learnt in 13 years, but really just reflects two weeks of testing.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a pandemic to contend with, but I did have a difficult schooling experience, including four high schools, two of which I was asked to leave (a polite expulsion).</p>
<p>I had a difficult time at school, and it didn’t destroy my life. These past two years have meant everyone had a difficult time at school, and it won’t destroy your life, either.</p>
<p>I was very lucky, and had parents who raised me to love reading and knowledge, and were willing and able to support me while I got my career off the ground. I recognise that not everyone has that, which will make this next bit harder.</p>
<p>The most important thing you can get from school, or life in general, is the ability to learn and be interested. As long as you are open to learning things and want to learn more things, the score you get on an exam doesn’t matter.</p>
<div>Making a new year’s resolution? Let’s not punish ourselves this year</div>
<div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>Making a new year’s resolution? Let’s not punish ourselves this year</h1></div>
<div><div><div><h5>Alice Clarke</h5>Journalist</div><div> <span><time>December 29, 2021 — 11.59am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>But for 2022 I’ve decided to take a different approach.</p>
<p>Perhaps we’ve learned from past mistakes. The beginning of 2020 and 2021 were both hailed as exciting events, it would be nice if 2022 could just come in quietly and not make any sudden moves.</p>
<p>So that means we need to find a normal in all of this and set goals that can be achieved regardless of whether it’s legal to go to the gym.</p>
<p>So, here are my resolutions for 2022:</p>
<p>Find an alternative phrase to “the new normal” that isn’t incredibly irritating.</p>
<p>Learn to speak Portuguese using the Duolingo app, and be able to put together conversational sentences more useful than “Não é um tatu” (it is not an armadillo).</p>
<p>Build a large Lego model of Beebo from the Legends of Tomorrow TV series. (What was lockdown for, if not adding incredibly specific facets to our already niche hobbies?)</p>
<p>Teach my wife to ride a bike. She never learned to ride a bike as a child, and I think we’ll love going for bike rides together in 2022. She is less convinced.</p>
<p>Finish every race in the Forza Horizon 5 videogame.</p>
<p>A good resolution is something that is both achievable and enjoyable. Setting an unrealistic goal is just a punishment, particularly if it’s something health-related.</p>
<p>Self-care and health goals are things we should always aim for, with the knowledge that sometimes we’ll have setbacks. They shouldn’t be turned into challenges that we will fail and feel bad about.</p>
<div><p>So, this new year, let’s all set fun goals as we get into weirdly specific hobbies we can enjoy from home – in case 2022 is just 2020, too.</p></div>

<h1>How has binge-watching changed the way we experience TV shows?</h1>
<div><p>If you’re struggling to remember what you’ve watched, don’t worry. There are scientific reasons why one binge is blurring into the next.</p><div><p>By Melinda Houston</p><time>January 12, 2022</time></div></div>
<a>one binge is blurring into the next</a>, as two experts on memory and learning, Dr Jared Cooney Horvath and Elise van den Hoven, explain.
<h3>Why can’t I remember the show I just binged?</h3>
<a>The Impact Of Binge Watching On Memory And Perceived Comprehension</a>) and concluded binge-watching may affect both sustained memory – and perceived enjoyment – of a show.
<blockquote><p>The first true-crime series might leave you shaken and shocked ... but by series 20 it probably won’t have the same effect.</p><cite>Elise van den Hoven, Professor of Human-Computer Interaction</cite></blockquote>
<p>Were you tired, stressed, distracted? Then there’s your problem right there.</p>
<h3>Why do some shows stick with me and others evaporate?</h3>
<p>“The same might be true for TV shows,” she says. “The first true-crime series might leave you shaken and shocked by what some people do to others, but by series 20 it probably won’t have the same effect.”</p>
<p>In terms of memory, the conventions of a genre are what’s called a preprint. To make a show memorable, you have to begin with that preprint – and then diverge from it.</p>
<h3>Why can I remember details of a show I watched 20 years ago, but not one I watched two weeks ago?</h3>
<p>“And once you lock a memory down, to keep it strong you have to keep periodically activating it,” Cooney Horvath says. “And the more you do it, the less you have to do it.”</p>
<h3>Is memory of TV shows/details better among digital natives?</h3>
<p>“Knowledge should stay stable and might even get better with age. Because you have more life experience, which makes it easier to link new information to what you already know.</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were using Twitter to talk about a show afterward, now we’re building a good memory. If you’re talking about it during, you’re losing focus.</p><cite>Dr Jared Cooney Horvath</cite></blockquote>
<h3>Why do I keep confusing actors and can’t remember their names?</h3>
<p>“I would ask: why do you expect to remember them in the first place?” van den Hoven says. “We have memory for survival, and names of actors are – for most of us – not necessary to survive.”</p>

<h3><a>New series The Tourist is a beautiful, thrilling mystery – you’ll be hooked</a></h3>

<p>There’s danger in adapting a great novel, as the first-time feature director works hard to reflect the literary quality of Elena Ferrante’s The Lost Daughter.</p>

<p>The Northern Irish actor shot to fame as a serial killer in The Fall, but now he’s found the role that scratches a “lot of itches”.</p>
