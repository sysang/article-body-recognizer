<p>Transpennine Express, Avanti West Coast and state-owned Transport for Wales and LNER have also been forced to cancel dozens of services.</p>
<a>end of rail franchising</a>, announced by Boris Johnson last May, means that taxpayers rather than rail operators now foot the bill for running train services.
<p>The insider said: "The DfT has emphasised to rail operators the need to run more efficient services."</p>
<p>A government source confirmed that it had asked operators to provide business plans to ensure taxpayer money is used efficiently.</p>
<p>They added: “With passenger numbers significantly down, it would be reckless and irresponsible not to ensure that the railway is more efficient and reducing its costs to the taxpayer.”</p>
<p>But officials insisted that <a>investment in the railways </a>is at record levels.</p>
<p>A DfT spokesman said: “We recognise the challenges rail operators are facing and have taken a number of steps to reduce the impact … and will consider temporary revised timetables where there are serious staff shortages. </p>

<li>Nadhim Zahawi: Masks in schools 'not ideal' but 'sensible'</li>
<li>ONS: One in 15 had virus in final week of 2021</li>
<p>Plan B measures are to continue for at least the next three weeks, Boris Johnson has confirmed as the Government unveiled a number of Covid rule changes.</p>
<p>Speaking in the Commons, the Prime Minister told MPs: "In response to the latest data the Cabinet agreed this morning that we should stick with Plan B for another three weeks with a further review before the regulations expire on January 26."</p>
<h3>That's it for another day</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson confirmed on Wednesday that Britain will retain Plan B measures for another three weeks as he hopes to avoid any further restrictions.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister noted that the UK has a higher level of booster protection than any other European country, with more than 34 million third doses now administered.</p>
<p>Tellingly, many of Mr Johnson's own MPs joined their Labour counterparts in expressing concern over rising energy prices.</p>
<h3>PCR v LFT: Lateral flows will speed up Covid isolation but could leave one in 10 with false positive </h3>
<p>The move to scrap confirmatory PCR checks for people who test positive with lateral flow has once again reignited the debate about which test is best.</p>
<p>Latest NHS Test and Trace figures from mid-December show that one in 10 lateral flow tests came back negative once checked by PCR. Under the new guidance, all those people would still be forced to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Experts argue that higher prevalence with omicron will mean fewer lateral flow positive tests are wrong.</p>
<h3>Labour: 'Our children are an afterthought' to the Government</h3>
<p>Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow education secretary, has said ventilation and regular testing are the key to emerging from the pandemic.</p>
<p>"The details simply do not rise to the challenge we face," she told the Commons. "The Christmas break was a chance to get children vaccinated and provide an ample supply of tests for families."</p>
<p>She cited Sage papers released 18 months ago which recommended that special attention was paid during the winter to the need for ventilation so that it can be implemented in a comfortable way.</p>
<p>"How can anyone look at that timeline without concluding that for this Government, our children are an afterthought? For this Government, our children are never a priority."</p>
<h3>Face masks 'sensible, pragmatic and proportionate', says Nadhim Zahawi</h3>
<p>Face coverings have been reintroduced to ensure face-to-face learning can continue, Nadhim Zahawi told MPs.</p>
<p>Mr Zahawi added that he hoped face masks can be ditched on January 26. More than 350,000 carbon dioxide monitors have been delivered to schools, he added, which teachers are finding "helpful to manage ventilation".</p>
<p>"In the majority of settings, existing ventilation measures are perfectly adequate for the job. But for the very few cases where maintaining good ventilation is more challenging, we are sending up to 8,000 air-cleaning units from next week."</p>
<h3>Safeguard your family by getting jabbed, says Nadhim Zahawi</h3>
<p>Schools will have received their lateral flow supplies in advance of the start of new term, the Education Secretary has said.</p>
<p>All secondary, college and university students and staff have been asked to self-test at least twice a week, Nadhim Zahawi confirmed, and said advice and support for testing supplies was available via 119.</p>
<p>Any international students required on arrival will be supported by their universities, with visa concessions to remain in place.</p>
<p>"The best way people can safeguard themselves and their families is by getting jabbed... the British public have responded magnificently, with around 60 per cent receiving all three jabs," Mr Zahawi said.</p>
<p>He urged parents to get second doses for their 12-to-15-year-olds booked in as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Government will do 'everything in our power' to keep schools open, says Zahawi</h3>
<p>Nadhim Zahawi told the Commons he has "absolute faith in our teaching communities".</p>
<p>"Teachers, classroom assistants, nursery providers, heads and lecturers in all our education settings have worked miracles throughout this pandemic," he said.</p>
<p>Face-to-face learning will continue to be a priority of the Government, Mr Zahawi added, and noted that the Covid Workforce Fund would be extended to the February half-term to soothe funding pressures on schools.</p>
<p>"Teachers know it, parents know it and children know it better than any one of us."</p>
<h3>Staff absence in schools 'probably likely to rise'</h3>
<p>Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, has addressed the Commons amid the "transition from pandemic to epidemic".</p>
<p>"I am very glad to say we have already seen the first volunteers heading back to our classrooms, including at least two of our own [Caroline Ansell and Jonathan Gullis]."</p>
<p>He said schools are suffering "some degree of staff absences", which was around eight per cent at the end of last year, which is "probably likely to rise".</p>
<h3>'Unparliamentary language from both sides'</h3>
<p>Sir Lindsay Hoyle has slapped down "unparliamentary language from both sides" of the House during today's debate.</p>
<p>"I don't want it... I want us to start going forward in a new year with more tolerance and better respect for each other," the Speaker of the Commons has said.</p>
<p>"I don't want to continue this argument or that debate any further, so I think just for now let's turn the temperature down and I don't want to get into further arguments about what was said from both sides."</p>
<h3>Lobby latest: Reducing isolation would speed up Covid spread, says No 10</h3>
<p>Any further cut to the seven-day isolation period would risk increasing the spread of Covid, Downing Street has said.</p>
<h3>Boris Johnson must set out route to normality, urges second Tory MP</h3>
<p>Steve Brine, the Tory MP, echoes Steve Baker in asking Boris Johnson for a "long-term plan for living with Covid in 2022", questioning whether the current measures are "sustainable".</p>
<p>"The Prime Minister deserves real credit, I think, for his recent decisions in respect of Covid," says Mr Brine. "He has followed the evidence but he has also taken I think the wider view of our society and our economy which has to be right.</p>
<p>"Can I ask my Right Honourable friend to also take the long view because it is increasingly clear we are a long way from learning to live with Covid but we also have an NHS on a permanent war footing and that's not sustainable.</p>
<p>"So what is the long-term plan for living with Covid in 2022 and could that include any changes to mandatory isolation, test and trace as for instance we see different isolation dates in the US and Germany to here in the UK?"</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said his ministers will continue to "keep isolation timings under review" as they do not want to "release people back into society so soon" that they are still infectious.</p>
<h3>Lobby latest: 'We don't rule anything out'</h3>
<p>More than 20 hospital trusts have declared "critical incidents" over Covid. the Prime Minister's official spokesman has confirmed.</p>
<p>It is "too early to judge" the full impact of omicron and "we don't rule anything out", the spokesman added at today's Lobby briefing.</p>
<h3>'The eyes of the world are literally on us'</h3>
<p>Michael Fabricant, the Tory backbencher, says the "eyes of the world are literally on us", citing international newspaper reports covering Boris Johnson going it alone compared to other countries in not imposing more draconian restrictions.</p>
<p>He asks Boris Johnson to maintain a "watching brief" on all other variants "because there may be more variants - some of them may be more serious".</p>
<p>"It's because we are the most boosted, the most tested and we have the most antivirals of any European country that we are also able to be the most open," Mr Johnson says. "Millions of people are doing the right thing."</p>
<p>Zarah Sultana, the Labour MP, calls on Mr Johnson to "listen to workers and trade unions and actually support NHS staff" by giving NHS staff FFP3 masks and rewarding them with "a genuine pay rise of 15 per cent".</p>
<p>Mr Johnson notes that Labour voted against the Tories' most recent healthcare legislation.</p>
<h3>More than 194,000 Covid cases confirmed</h3>
<p>A total of 194,747 new cases of Covid have been confirmed this afternoon.</p>
<p>A further 334 coronavirus deaths have been also reported today, which includes delayed reporting numbers from over the Bank Holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Week-on-week, hospital admissions with Covid are up 58.5 per cent, Department for Health data show.</p>
<h3>Testing changes will also apply to care homes, confirms PM </h3>
<p>Hillary Benn, the Labour MP, says that up until now the advice has been that care home residents should not be tested for 90 days after a positive PCR result unless they develop symptoms.</p>
<p>"Given the changes to the testing arrangements announced today, does that advice still hold?" he asks.</p>
<p>"No it doesn't, and I will ensure he is advised on the new arrangements," Mr Johnson replies.</p>
<h3>Communication with teachers could be better, says Labour MP</h3>
<p>Kim Leadbeater, the MP for Batley and Spen, praises teachers and support staff for working "heroically" throughout the pandemic, but cautions that they are "struggling".</p>
<p>"I share what she said about the amazing work that's been done by teachers and schools up and down the country, and they've done incredible things to make their schools Covid-compliant," the Prime Minister says.</p>
<p>"We communicate with them the whole time and the Secretary of State for Education has done a formidable job of interacting with teachers and with parents and trying to get our messages across."</p>
<h3>Stepping up boosters the way back to the 'old normal', says Boris Johnson</h3>
<p>Steve Baker, the MP for Wycombe, credits Boris Johnson with doing his "level best" with trying to save lives and preserve prosperity across the country.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson says "the plan is the one we have in place" - to continue with Plan B, which will be reviewed in three weeks before its planned expiry on January 26.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean there won't be further challenges, but I think life will return to something much closer to normality, it won't be necessary to have the restrictions we currently have in place."</p>
<h3>JCVI 'keeping fourth jabs under review'</h3>
<p>Greg Clark, the Tory MP, suggests that NHS workers should get a fourth Covid jab so they do not get infected and can stay at work to ease pressure on the health service.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson says the JCVI are “keeping fourth jabs under review”</p>
<p>The SNP's Ian Blackford accuses Boris Johnson of a "reckless gamble which risks lives and risks the NHS", asserting that it means "avoidable deaths and long Covid".</p>
<p>The correct approach would be more caution to slow transmission, he suggests, referring to restrictions in Scotland and the other devolved nations (see 2.28pm).</p>
<p>Mr Johnson encourages Mr Blackford to "take back what he said" and accuses him of "totally untrue" comments, as the Speaker intervenes to encourage Mr Blackford to "calm down" and "start the new year as we mean to go on".</p>
<h3>High praise from one Prime Minister to another...</h3>
<p>Theresa May commends Boris Johnson for "resisting calls from the Labour Party and others for more restrictions before Christmas, and also the changes he has announced today".</p>
<p>"Omicron is less severe than previous variants," the former Prime Minister says. "We will see new variants in future, the likelihood is they will continue to be less serious.</p>
<p>"It is not in our national interest to completely or partially shut down sections of our economy every we see a new variant."</p>
<p>"We have to remain cautious, and I can't tell the House we can rule out absolutely everything to protect the public. But I'm confident we can get through this wave of omicron with the balanced and proportionate approach we are taking."</p>
<h3>Boris Johnson: Labour don't know what they're talking about</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson wonders why Angela Rayner "continues to attack" Britain's testing operation and accuses her of coming out with "the inverse of the truth" during her intervention.</p>
<p>"It really is extraordinary that they run down this country and its achievements time and time again," he says. "We're doing 520,000 PCR tests every day, 1.25 million every day... we've done 400 million tests in the country.</p>
<p>"She talks about schools, we delivered 31 million tests to schools in the run up to Christmas. She made an incredible point - she said this country doesn't have its own diagnostic capabilities. They don't know what they're talking about!</p>
<p>"We have a plan for dealing with Covid, all they do is carp from the sidelines."</p>
<h3>Government is asleep at the wheel, claims Angela Rayner</h3>
<p>The NHS is not "surfing but struggling to stay afloat" despite Boris Johnson's comments that Britain can "ride out" the omicron wave, the deputy Labour leader says.</p>
<p>Angela Rayner thanks the trusts who have been "upfront" about the reality of the situation, and calls on the Prime Minister "to give a frank assessment of the state of our NHS".</p>
<p>"Isn't the truth that the health service went into this wave with the longest waiting lists on record and major staff shortages? After a decade of Tory mismanagement, the NHS wasn't prepared for Covid."</p>
<p>She accuses the Government of having been "asleep at the wheel", and notes that the Welsh Government - which is Labour run - has had to lend four million lateral flow tests to England</p>
<p>"If he was happy to defend Dominic Cummings, the former Health Secretary, and Owen Paterson, why won't he defend those public servants who are actually doing the right thing?"</p>
<h3>Boris Johnson confirms Plan B will remain in place for next three weeks</h3>
<p>Mr Johnson starts a statement on the omicron variant by paying tribute to vaccine volunteers and health workers, noting that more than 10 million vaccines have been administered since the start of his Omicron Emergency Boost scheme.</p>
<p>"We have a higher level of booster protection than all our European neighbours, with over 34 million boosters administered in the UK," he says.</p>
<p>"The Cabinet agreed this morning we should agree to stick with Plan B for the next three weeks, with a further review before the regulations expire on January 26... This Government does not believe we need to shut our country again."</p>
<p>He reiterates advice to work from home where possible and wear face coverings in crowded settings and on public transport.</p>
<h3>Angela Rayner offers Boris Johnson chance to correct the record</h3>
<p>"Nobody wants to mislead the House and I'm sure the Prime Minister wouldn't want to do that," Angela Rayner says, asking Mr Johnson to correct the record on his claim that he never called inflation fears "unfounded".</p>
<p>It came after Beth Rigby, the Sky journalist who interviewed Mr Johnson in October, highlighted that he did indeed make such a remark in October. </p>
<p>She is informed by the Speaker that it is not a point of order, and instead a point of clarification.</p>
<h3>Government 'should not be held to ransom', claims Sir Edward Leigh</h3>
<p>The Government "should not be held to ransom" while cutting trade deals, Sir Edward Leigh claims after reports that the UK could enable visa-free entry for people from India making it easier for them to live and work here.</p>
<p>"Would he agree with me that our new working class voters who voted for Brexit did not vote to replace immigration from Europe with immigration from India. Is he determined to connect with our supporters and control immigration?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, and yes" is Mr Johnson's answer. He accuses Labour of an "everywhere and always" approach to both immigration and the economy, talking up the Government's own Borders Bill.</p>
<h3>Can we use Brexit to scrap VAT on energy bills, asks DUP MP</h3>
<p>Sammy Wilson, the DUP MP for East Antrim, asks whether "we can use our Brexit freedoms" to cut VAT on energy bills and review the green levy.</p>
<p>"We are addressing the issue of... Don't forget the cap is still in place, and all the mitigations I've talked about are there," Mr Johnson says.</p>
<p>In another jibe at the Labour Party, he adds: "What we must do above all is make sure this country has a better supply of cheap and affordable energy which they hopelessly refused to do during their 13 wasted years in Government."</p>
<h3>Johnson defends pandemic sick pay</h3>
<p>Andy McDonald, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough, challenges Boris Johnson on the £96-a-week sick pay for those who have been unwell during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson responds that the Government made statutory sick pay payable from day one, so it is 75 per cent more generous when people have to isolate.</p>
<p>The key is to keep people in "higher-wage, higher-skill jobs", Mr Johnson adds, claiming: "That is what we are doing."</p>
<h3>Plaid MP warns of 'irreversible damage to wellbeing' of dementia patients</h3>
<p>Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru MP, raises the experiences of her own mother, who has dementia, and says there remain many care homes and hospitals where visits can be denied - causing "irreversible damage to wellbeing".</p>
<p>She calls on everyone with dementia, wherever they live, to have the "right to family life" guaranteed.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson extends his "deepest sympathies", and says: "I know how her feelings must be exacerbated by the difficulties that so many people are facing because of the restrictions we're having to put on care homes, and I sympathise deeply.</p>
<h3>Sir Ed Davey calls on PM to do 'much, much more'</h3>
<p>Sir Ed Davey takes to his feet - although not before Sir Lindsay Hoyle calls him "Ed Balls". Sir Ed says that he is sure Boris Johnson will want to help him welcome the new MP for North Shropshire, who had her first day in Parliament today.</p>
<p>"Does the Prime Minister accept that he could be doing much, much more than he is doing to prevent millions of people going hungry and cold this year while he remains, for now at least, in the warmth and comfort of Number 10?"</p>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Boris Johnson jokes that "Balls is the word" for Sir Ed's question, and wonders whether it is "the same Ed Balls stroke Davey who was an energy minister" during the coalition Government years.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Boris Johnson and Ian Blackford clash on cost of living</h3>
<p>Ian Blackford cites research suggesting working families will be up to £1,200 worse off by April because of a combination of tax hikes and rising energy bills.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson says it is hard to take from self-described "humble crofter" Mr Blackford, who is visibly unhappy with the reference to his past comments amid his ex-banking days.</p>
<p>The PM once again hails his party's "balanced and proportionate" approach, for which support would be "welcome and deserved".</p>
<p>Mr Blackford accuses Mr Johnson of "the same old nonsense from the same failing Prime Minister - we've had the year of Tory sleaze, but now we've got the year of Tory squeeze from family budgets".</p>
<h3>'We're taking the tough decisions this country needs', insists PM</h3>
<p>Angela Rayner asks Boris Johnson: "Will he finally stop and change course, or will he plough on with what will be a disaster for thousands of families?"</p>
<p>As a direct result of Universal Credit reform so far, a single mother with two children is £1,200 better off, retorts Mr Johnson.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister concludes their exchange by saying the Government was "getting on with the job".</p>
<h3>'Any decent Government' would help taxpayers on energy, says Rayner</h3>
<p>Angela Rayner claims "any decent Government" would help taxpayers ahead of energy price hikes in April. She says "even Tory backbenchers" are now calling for VAT on energy bills to be cut, one of Labour's most prominent demands.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson accuses Ms Rayner of having the "barefaced cheek" of wanting to cut VAT having campaigned for Remain.</p>
<p>Sensing the Prime Minister's raised voice and demeanour, Ms Rayner asks Mr Johnson: "How's it going? Are you okay?"</p>
<p>She accuses the Tories of "whacking more taxes on working people" at a time of soaring energy prices, which will lead to a £1,200 "iceberg" for working families.</p>
<h3>Boris Johnson: Labour would have kept us in lockdown</h3>
<p>She refers to Martin Lewis's warnings of a "seismic hit" to energy bills.</p>
<p>In response, the Prime Minister refers to cold weather payments for four million people a week and measures to cut taxes for those on Universal Credit while increasing the living wage by £1,000.</p>
<h3>Johnson and Rayner trade barbs over leadership</h3>
<p>Angela Rayner says inflation is almost at six per cent, the level highest since the travails of John Major's Conservative Party in the 1990s.</p>
<p>"Familiar stuff - the Prime Minister promised wage rises would offset inflation, they haven't and they won't," she tells the Commons. "Millions of British workers now face rising bills... The Prime Minister needs to get a grip on this."</p>
<p>Boris Johnson refers to Ms Rayner's job as the shadow secretary state of work - and quips about "the future job she's got in mind".</p>
<p>He says employment is higher than before the pandemic, and the "instinctive" response of Labour was towards more restrictions when omicron hit.</p>
<p>"I've heard on the grapevine there might be a vacancy for Prime Minister soon, so maybe I should have aspirations," Ms Rayner responds.</p>
<h3>'How did he get it so wrong?' Rayner asks Johnson on inflation</h3>
<p>Angela Rayner, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, pays tribute to Desmond Tutu and thanks key workers and vaccine volunteers at the start of Prime Minister's Questions.</p>
<p>Ms Rayner notes that Boris Johnson described fears about inflation as "unfounded" in October, and asks: "How did he get it so wrong?" The remarks were made by Mr Johnson in a broadcast interview with Sky News in October 2021:</p>
<p>.@AngelaRayner says in Oct @BorisJohnson claimed fears about inflation were “unfounded”PM: “I said not such thing”He did, on camera 👇🏻 https://t.co/q4VPmbJbrv</p>— Beth Rigby (@BethRigby)
<p>Mr Johnson insists he "said no such thing" and adds: "What we are doing is making sure that we protect the people of this country throughout what is unquestionably going to be a difficult period.</p>
<h3>Geoff Hoon's 'revelation' does little to rewrite the history around Tony Blair and Iraq </h3>
<p>It’s odd how arguments over the Iraq war in 2003 have been interpreted and remembered nearly two decades later, writes Tom Harris. </p>
<p>Given that Saddam had actually used chemical weapons to murder thousands, it was hardly credible for opponents to claim they didn’t exist, so they settled for dubious claims of moral relativism instead.</p>
<h3>Breaking: PCR tests to be ditched for travellers arriving in UK </h3>
<p>PCR tests are set to be ditched for travellers arriving in the UK, saving a family of four returning from holiday up to £200.</p>
<p>Ministers are understood to have agreed on Wednesday that travellers will instead only have to take a lateral flow test, which cost on average around £20 to £30 rather than the £80 for PCR swabs.</p>
<p>The Cabinet’s Covid Operations committee also backed plans, first revealed in the Telegraph, to scrap pre-departure tests currently required for travellers within 48 hours of their return to Britain.</p>
<p>The moves will be a major boost for holidaymakers planning winter sun breaks and the beleaguered travel and tourism industry.</p>

<h3>One in 15 in England had Covid during final week of 2021, ONS data suggest</h3>
<p>Around 3.3 million people in England had coronavirus in the last week of 2021, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest.</p>
<p>This equates to one in 15 people, according to the latest ONS estimate. In London, around one in 10 people were likely to test positive for Covid in the week up to December 31.</p>
<p>One in 20 people were estimated to have had the virus in the same week in both Scotland and Wales, a figure that stood at one in 25 in Northern Ireland.</p>
<h3>Nicola Sturgeon: We must 'adapt our thinking' to seek 'more proportionate' Covid response</h3>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon has admitted the Scottish Government must "adapt our thinking" in the wake of the omicron variant, writes Simon Johnson, our Scottish Political Editor.</p>
<p>Ms Sturgeon, who has to date taken a tougher stance on restrictions than Boris Johnson since England's so-called 'Freedom Day' last July, said there were "no easy answers" in adapting to the continued challenges posed by Covid.</p>
<h3>No more restrictions but no existing ones scrapped until Jan 17</h3>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed that Scotland will not introduce any further immediate restrictions but no existing ones are to be scrapped until at least January 17, writes Simon Johnson.</p>
<p>"More generally, we are not proposing any new protective measures today," she said in an address at Holyrood this afternoon.</p>
<p>"However, with the virus so prevalent, we do consider it important to continue to apply some brake on transmission, particularly in settings posing the highest risk.</p>
<p>Ms Sturgeon's SNP administration continues to "strongly advise the general public to limit social contact as much as possible".</p>
<p>"We do consider it's important to continue to apply some brake on transmission, particularly in settings posing the highest risk," she told MSPs.</p>
<h3>Another critical incident declared in Norfolk and Waveney</h3>
<p>NHS Norfolk and Waveney Commissioning Group became the latest health body to declare a critical incident this afternoon, as it citing "unprecedented pressure" on its services.</p>
<p>Cath Byford, the chief nurse at the group, warned on New Year's Eve that local health services were facing some of the most "significant and sustained" pressures that they had experienced in recent years.</p>
<p>"During this time our first priority has to be providing the most urgent and lifesaving care. This means that many patients in less urgent need of care may have to wait longer than we would like," she said.</p>
<h3>Plan B extension has the support of the Cabinet, says No 10</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson has the support of his Cabinet in extending Plan B restrictions before their original expiry date of January 26, according to a Number 10 statement.</p>
<p>The Cabinet did not introduce any restrictions further to the Plan B package before Christmas amid considerable opposition to new any rules at all from the Tory backbenches.</p>
<p>It looks as though there will not be any further curbs, and Mr Johnson will instead roll over the current laws, which encourage people to work from home if they can and entail Covid certification, or so called 'vaccine passport', for large venues.</p>
<p>"The Prime Minister said the Government would continue to give the NHS all the support it needs to further manage the pressure it is under.</p>
<h3>Ditch Sunday trading laws during major floods, says think tank</h3>
<p>Sunday trading laws should be ditched during major floods, a liberal conservative think tank backed by Michael Gove has recommended.</p>
<p>Research by Bright Blue found that there have been more than 50 flash flood events in major urban areas since 2007, including 10 in London and at least seven in Birmingham and the West Midlands.</p>
<p>In previous severe floods, people have been unable to buy essential groceries and cleaning supplies because of restricted Sunday opening hours, the Bright Blue report found.</p>
<p>In a 2015 incident in Lancaster, the city had just one supermarket open, with all the others closed because of a power cut caused by the floods. But the store could not open for longer because of Sunday trading laws.</p>
<p>In England and Wales, large shops over 280 square metres can only open on Sundays for six consecutive hours between 10am and 6pm.</p>

<h3>What Plan B Covid restrictions mean for schools </h3>
<p>As pupils return to school after the Christmas holidays, those in Year 7 and above are being asked to wear face masks in classrooms again - after ministers drew up contingency plans to keep schools open amid fears of widespread teacher absences.</p>
<p>Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, said the move was designed to help "maximise the number of children in school" and would remain only as long as needed, amid fears of omicron disrupting teaching in schools.</p>
<p>The Telegraph also has confirmation that more drastic proposals include prioritising GCSE and A-Level students for face-to-face teaching, should schools be hit by staff absences.</p>
<p>With the latest update revealing the continuation of Plan B Covid measures until Jan 26, the reintroduction of mandatory face masks in classrooms will last until this date, according to Mr Zahawi.</p>

<h3>Hospitals in Bristol declare 'critical incidents' amid rising pressure</h3>
<p>'Internal critical incidents' have been declared at hospitals across Bristol because of rising Covid and non-Covid pressures on services.</p>
<p>Both the University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust and the North Bristol NHS Trust, which run 12 hospitals and centres between them, said they had reached their "highest state of alert".</p>
<p>The Healthier Together Partnership noted that both of the acute trusts had declared critical incidents across the Bank Holiday weekend.</p>
<p>"This meant they were able to open up extra beds and ward space, as well as request additional staff," the Partnership said.</p>
<p>"Like other areas of the country, many staff across health and care are either unwell with Covid-19 or isolating."</p>
<p>Members of the public can take the "most important" protective action by getting their first, second or booster dose of a vaccine, the Healthier Together Partnership urged.</p>
<h3>Chances of false positive 'very low' amid lateral flow change</h3>
<p>The chances of a false positive result are "very low" because of how high Covid levels currently are, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has said.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <p>"It remains really important that anyone who experiences Covid-19 symptoms self-isolates immediately. They should also order a PCR test on gov.uk, or by phoning 119."</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Breaking: Confirmatory PCR test no longer needed after positive lateral flow result</h3>
<p>Asymptomatic people in England who test positive for coronavirus on a lateral flow device will no longer need confirmatory PCR tests from next Tuesday, it has been announced.</p>
<p>The UK Health Security Agency has confirmed that the change will take effect on January 11.</p>
<h3>'Around a million people' self-isolating with Covid as testing rules set to be relaxed</h3>
<p>“Around a million people” are currently self-isolating due to coronavirus, the care minister has confirmed ahead of a planned relaxation of testing rules.</p>
<p>Ms Keegan added that yesterday was a record day for home deliveries of testing kits, with 741,000 sent out yesterday.</p>
<h3>PCR test delays force pub and restaurant workers to isolate for almost two weeks </h3>
<p>Pub and restaurant staff are being forced to isolate for almost two weeks because of delays in Covid PCR tests, industry leaders have warned ahead of an expected relaxation of the rules.</p>
<p>Anyone who does not have Covid symptoms but gets a positive lateral flow result, accounting for about 40 per cent of cases, must then get a confirmatory PCR test.</p>
<p>They must isolate for 10 days after the PCR, but delays in the testing system means that it can take as many as four days to get a slot - effectively condemning people to as many as 14 days indoors.</p>

<h3>Public 'not getting what they deserve' at this point in pandemic, says paramedic</h3>
<p>A paramedic from the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) has said members of the public are "not getting what they deserve" at the current stage of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The NEAS today confirmed that it had indeed asked members of the public to take their friend or relative to hospital themselves in "non life-threatening" situations.</p>
<p>The paramedic, who asked not to be named, told the PA news agency: "I feel awful because we are at a stage where the public are not getting what they deserve despite us trying to do all we can to support them."</p>
<p>They added that the service was "drowning under the pressure of a perfect storm" amid a record number of omicron cases and high levels of staff absence.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter how good the PPE is because frequently staff are being exposed to Covid in their personal lives with family members testing positive. Colleagues working on New Year said it was absolutely rammed.</p>
<p>"So we understand if the public are terrified about being asked to drive a relative to hospital, it's not ideal, but if that's an option that leads to a swifter outcome for their loved one, that has to be done."</p>
<h3>Scrap testing rules for UK-bound passengers, urge travel firms</h3>
<p>The travel industry is calling on the Government to remove all testing requirements for international travellers, writes Gareth Davies.</p>
<p>Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and Airlines UK said research they commissioned into travel restrictions found domestic, not international, restrictions would be the only way to reduce the spread of omicron.</p>
<p>Pre-departure and day two PCR testing were reintroduced in late November and early December in response to the spread of omicron.</p>
<p>From early December, MAG said passenger numbers at its airports fell by more than 30 per cent. The travel restrictions are expected to be reviewed later today.</p>

<h3>Covid passes offer 'false sense of security', claims Tory MP</h3>
<p>A Tory MP has claimed that Sir Keir Starmer testing positive proves that Covid certification measures provide a "false sense of security".</p>
<p>"Presumably, Sir Keir will be triply vaccinated so what does this say about vaccinations protecting against picking up and passing on the disease?" wrote Chris Green, the MP for Bolton West and Atherton.</p>
<p>"He demonstrates that vaccine passports will give a false sense of security and is a project looking for a justification."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Barry Sheerman questioned current Covid precautions after revealing that a member of his staff has tested positive.</p>
<p>"He is isolating, of course, but are we working hard enough to keep our staff healthy?" he asked.</p>
<h3>Turning off the gas straight away would leave Britain 'more reliant on foreign imports'</h3>
<p>North Sea gas cannot be turned off overnight as it would leave Britain "more reliant on foreign imports", the Business Secretary has said.</p>
<p>Kwasi Kwarteng set out his agenda for the new year in a series of videos posted to his social media channels this morning.</p>
<p>"We're transitioning to net zero - we're not simply flicking the light switch off of a very important industry."</p>
<p>Backing British science and making the most of newfound Brexit freedoms will also be top priorities going into 2022, Mr Kwarteng also said.</p>
<h3>Which critical workers will be required to take daily Covid tests? </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Around 100,000 critical industry workers will be required to take daily lateral flow tests from Jan 10 in a bid to alleviate the staffing shortage crisis gripping Britain, the Government has confirmed.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Boris Johnson announced at a press conference on Tuesday Jan 4 that critical personnel will be covered by the scheme, although the criteria will be less expansive than previously. </p>
<p>Here, we look at who may be included in the scheme and how the Government has previously defined key workers.</p>
<h3>Don't assume your children 'taught well' at school, says social mobility tsar</h3>
<p>Do not assume your children are being “taught well” at school, the social mobility tsar has warned, as she says parents must give lessons at home as well.</p>
<p>Katharine Birbalsingh said there has “never been a better time” for mothers and fathers to teach their children at home. </p>
<p>Ms Birbalsingh, who was appointed as the chairman of the Social Mobility Commission last October, has been labelled Britain’s strictest headteacher.</p>

<h3>Cabinet meets at Downing Street as Johnson hopes gamble will pay off</h3>
<p>The Cabinet has met this morning at Downing Street where Boris Johnson was expected to urge his ministers to stick with the current course of measures.</p>
<p>"As our NHS moves to a war footing I will be recommending to Cabinet tomorrow that we continue with Plan B," Mr Johnson told a press conference yesterday.</p>
<p>"Because the public have responded and changed their behaviour - changed your behaviour - buying valuable time to get boosters in arms."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Simon Hart, the Wales Secretary, praised the decision not to lock down again before Christmas, and said it "took nerve".</p>
<p>"As well as the economic factors, we gave significant weight to mental health and behavioural implications of further restrictions," he said.</p>

<h3>London Tory MPs 'appalled' by Sadiq Khan's drugs plans</h3>
<p>Two London-based Conservative MPs have said they are "appalled" by attempts by the Mayor of London to move towards effectively decriminalising cannabis use.</p>
<p>The Telegraph's Tony Diver reported yesterday that Sadiq Khan is planning to end the prosecution of young people caught with cannabis. Under-25s in the boroughs of Lewisham, Bexley and Greenwich will initially be subject to the scheme.</p>
<p>"We now stand together in saying that we do not support any weakening of drugs laws and we do not want our borough to be a guinea pig for this policy – and nor do Bexley residents.”</p>
<p>The MPs had previously criticised the merger of the police force in Bexley with Lewisham and Greenwich.</p>
<h3>Priti Patel: X-ray checks would curb 'appalling abuses' of asylum system</h3>
<p>Adult asylum seekers suspected of lying about their age could face new X-ray checks under measures unveiled by the Home Secretary today.</p>
<p>Priti Patel is to establish a scientific committee that will look at ways to analyse new arrivals to Britain who claim that they are under 18.</p>
<p>Last week, the Telegraph reported that the number of adult migrants falsely claiming to be children has more than trebled in a year to a record 1,100.</p>
<p>"The Borders Bill will end many of the blatant abuses that have led to our immigration and asylum system being abused," Ms Patel wrote this morning.</p>
<p>"We're changing UK laws to introduce new scientific methods for assessing the age of asylum seekers to stop these appalling abuses."</p>
<h3>Ambulance service confirms it asked friends or relatives to take 'non-life threatening' patients to hospital</h3>
<p>The North East Ambulance Service has confirmed that it asked patients with "potentially non-life threatening" calls to be taken to hospital by a friend or relative if an ambulance was delayed over the Bank Holiday.</p>
<p>Dr Mathew Beattie, medical director at NEAS, described the decision as "incredibly difficult" but said it formed part of the highest level of its clinical escalation plan.</p>
<p>Dr Beattie added: "Under normal circumstances, we would move up and down our clinical escalation levels reactively as each point is triggered or demand reduces.</p>
<p>"The measures we took over the bank holiday weekend were implemented because we have seen activity fluctuating dramatically with surges in demand.</p>
<p>"This was an incredibly difficult decision to take, but when patients are waiting an average of an hour for an ambulance that should be responding within 18 minutes, there is a risk for them coming to harm if they cannot get to hospital quickly."</p>
<h3>Breaking: Sir Keir Starmer tests positive for Covid again</h3>
<p>Sir Keir Starmer has tested positive for coronavirus again, a Labour spokesman said.</p>
<p>Angela Rayner, his party's deputy leader, will deputise for him at Prime Minister's Questions at 3pm today.</p>
<p>It is the Labour leader's sixth time in isolation after previous Test and Trace rules meant he had to self-isolate whenever a close contact of his tested positive.</p>
<p>Sir Keir previously tested positive for Covid on October 27 last year, which also meant he had to miss PMQs.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sir Keir set out Labour's vision for 2022 in a speech in Birmingham in which he promised to build "a new Britain" and called for the return of "decency" in public life.</p>
<h3>Liz Truss to wine and dine EU counterpart at stately home</h3>

<p>Over dinner at the 17th-century venue on January 13, she will present a series of “constructive proposals” to ease the trade disruptions caused by the Brexit rules for Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The pair will continue discussions the following day, with Ms Truss keen to end the row over the province in order to reset wider EU-UK relations, which have suffered as a result of the feud.</p>

<h3>Group of at least 66 migrants are first to cross English Channel in 2022 </h3>
<p>At least 66 people in two boats crossed the English Channel to the UK on Tuesday, the Home Office has said. They are believed to be the first such arrivals to reach Britain in 2022.</p>
<p>The group, which included a handful of young children including a baby, were intercepted in the English Channel and brought into the Port of Dover on an RNLI lifeboat at about 11am.</p>
<p>They were brought off the lifeboat in the harbour before being taken to the immigration processing centre.</p>
<p>The group are thought to be the first to make the treacherous 21-mile journey this year due to a brief weather window which brought calmer conditions at sea.</p>
<p>About 20 others arrived later on Tuesday afternoon, brought to shore on the Border Force vessel Hurricane.</p>

<h3>Boris Johnson rejects energy bill VAT cuts to help struggling families </h3>
<p>Boris Johnson has indicated that he will not cut VAT on energy bills because it would help “a lot of people who perhaps don’t need the support” with rising living costs.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister on Tuesday night dismissed demands to enact the move to help struggling families, amid fears that residential energy bills could double to £2,000 in April when the price cap is set to rise.</p>
<p>Speaking at a televised Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson was challenged about a vow he himself made in May 2016 to scrap VAT from energy bills if Britons voted Leave.</p>
<p>He denied having misled voters with his previous remarks, but signalled that the Treasury would consider actions that were targeted only at the families most in need of support.</p>

<h3>You can't expect 'everything to remain the same' with elective surgery, claims minister</h3>
<p>It is "unreasonable in the face of omicron to expect everything to remain the same" as some hospitals cancel non-urgent operations, the care minister has claimed.</p>
<p>Annual contingency planning means "often [slowing] down electives", according to Gillian Keegan, even though the Government "obviously wants" the backlog to remain cleared.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Today programme, Ms Keegan said: "What we do is we have these contingency plans where they can call for mutual aid, they can call for more volunteers, they can call for military aid if they need."</p>
<p>"But right now, if we have emergencies due to a lot of admissions at AE that is one of the measures hospital trusts will look at. But obviously we want everyone to get their elective surgery as soon as they can."</p>
<h3>I want to forgive my attacker, says stabbed MP</h3>
<p>A former minister has said he would meet the woman who stabbed him more than 11 years ago as part of a "restorative justice process", Danielle Sheridan reports.</p>
<p>Stephen Timms, the Labour MP for East Ham, revealed he had received a letter from Roshonara Choudhry, a British former student and an Islamic extremist who is serving a life sentence for attempted murder. </p>
<p>Choudhry, who stated that she had been influenced by online sermons of Anwar al-Awlaki, the leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, was the first al-Qaeda sympathiser to attempt an assassination in Britain. </p>
<p>In one of three letters, she apologised to Mr Timms for having stabbed him several times at a constituency surgery in 2010.</p>

<h3>NHS struggling in a 'prolonged way' rather than on a war footing</h3>
<p>Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the NHS is struggling in a "prolonged way" rather than suddenly being on a "war footing".</p>
<p>"What we need to do is make sure everyone understands that," Dr Henderson told the BBC's Today programme. "There isn't something magical we can do now, this is a prolonged crisis.</p>
<p>She also called on Boris Johnson to adopt "calm, sober language" and explain the pressures on the NHS to patients after his comments that Britain should be able to "ride out" the current wave of coronavirus.</p>
<h3>Ministers seek to ensure Covid testing system 'makes sense' after demand surge</h3>
<p>Ministers are seeking to ensure the Covid testing system "makes sense" after a surge in demand for lateral flow tests, the care minister has said. </p>
<p>"So they are looking at what makes sense, because most people are doing many, many lateral flow tests in a week or a couple of times a week at least.</p>
<p>"So they are looking now because we know there is quite a high positive rate with PCR tests. We keep these things under review all the time."</p>
<p>She pushed back on the prospect of any further restrictions, saying any decision to introduce further measures is “not one to be taken lightly… It’s not easy to lock down a country, it comes with costs and consequences”.</p>
<h3>NHS ordered to investigate reports that heart attack victim told to get a taxi to hospital </h3>
<p>The health minister has asked NHS England to look at reports that people are being asked to transport heart attack or stroke sufferers themselves as ambulances are overstretched.</p>
<p>The advice is said to have been given out at North East Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, the Health Service Journal reported.</p>
<p>She added that any decision to introduce further measures is “not one to be taken lightly… It’s not easy to lock down a country, it comes with costs and consequences”.</p>
<h3>Key workers not covered by daily lateral flow scheme can get tests ‘very easily’</h3>
<p>Key workers not covered by a new daily lateral flow testing scheme can get tests ‘very easily’, the care minister has said.</p>
<p>“They can get tests very easily, actually. The main channel for most people is to get tests via the main channels, either booking to get something sent to your home or pharmacies."</p>
<p>Ms Keegan said there had been a "couple of surges in demand" which meant tests had not been available, but added ministers and officials had worked over Christmas to triple its capacity by the end of February.</p>
<p>While people waiting a week for a PCR result is not “typical”, she conceded “some people are waiting too long” until confirmation on whether or not they have Covid.</p>

<header> <h1> How to quit your job in six easy steps </h1> <p> Handing in your notice can end in disaster if handled badly, but these are the best tips to follow </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jessica Beard <time> 4 January 2022 • 4:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Many of us will be looking to make a fresh start in 2022 with our attentions turning to enhancing our careers - whether that means finding a suitable stepping stone or taking a leap of faith.</p>
<p>Some may have already set the ball rolling, but those yet to hand in their notice should be careful not to make any faux pas that could ruin their move. </p>
<p>Telegraph Money has listed out six tips to ensure your <a>professional reputation</a> is kept intact and you leave on the best terms possible. </p>
<h2>Check your current contract</h2>
<p>Before determining a start date with a prospective employer, you should read through your current contract to double check your notice period. This can vary depending on how long you have been with the company. </p>
<p>There is still time to reassess your decision at this stage so it is important not to make a rushed decision and ask yourself some questions about why you are looking to move:</p>
<ul><li>What are your motivations for leaving?</li><li>What would you be giving up by quitting?</li><li>Can you afford to leave?</li></ul>
<h2>Wait until you have signed your new contract</h2>
<p>Jumping the gun and handing your notice in before receiving your new contract is one of the biggest mistakes you can make. It is crucial to read through and sign the contract before you make your current employer aware of your intention to leave.</p>
<h2>Set up a meeting with your current boss</h2>
<p>A formal resignation requires you to send a letter, or an online copy of it, to your HR department. However, it is considered more respectful to tell your manager first. Do not tell any of your coworkers beforehand.</p>
<p>If possible, you should leave on good terms to maintain your professional reputation, which involves being honest with your current employer. </p>
<h2>Be prepared for a counter offer</h2>
<p>Even before breaking the news to your boss you should consider how you would react if they tried to keep you. </p>
<p>There is a chance your boss will make a counter offer, for more money or greater responsibility if they value your work and want you to stay with the team. </p>
<h2>Be ready to work your notice period</h2>
<p>Notice periods can vary hugely depending on your employer, industry and how long you have been in the role. You should be prepared to maintain a professional standard throughout your notice period, no matter how long. </p>
<p>If you are going to a direct competitor, there is a chance that your employer could place you on gardening leave, in which case you will not have to work for the remainder of your notice. </p>
<p>It is courteous to offer to help train another employee if you overlap with the person taking on your job. </p>
<h2>Check your holiday record</h2>
<p>Check your contract to see if this is in writing. If it is not, then there is a chance your employer does not have the legal right to deduct money from your final pay.</p>
<p>This guide is kept updated with the latest advice.</p>

<header> <h1> Current ‘work from home’ guidance: how to claim tax relief and what are your rights? </h1> <p> Workers in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have been advised to work from home </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jessica Beard <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:36am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Boris Johnson issued guidance calling for Britons to "work from home" where possible from December 13, 2021.</p>
<p>Workers had been returning to the office as the number of coronavirus cases flatlined, but the spread of the omicron variant triggered increased restrictions from the Government.</p>
<p>Following a meeting of the Cabinet, the Government asked all workers in England to stay away from the office and other work sites where possible.</p>
<p>In normal times, employers have the power to decide whether it is necessary for staff to be physically present at work. But the new guidance states that workers should stay away from workplaces unless it is strictly necessary. </p>
<p>Here are your rights when it comes to flexible working:</p>
<h2>What is the official guidance?</h2>
<p>As the new variant spread, each of the four nations of the UK introduced tougher guidelines.</p>
<p>In England, the official guidance came into force from December 13, with people asked to work from home where possible. The Prime Minister said: "Work from home if you can, go to work if you must but work from home if you can."</p>
<p>In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told workers to work from home where possible until at least the middle of January.</p>
<p>The devolved governments of Wales and Northern Ireland also asked citizens to avoid the office where possible. </p>
<h2>What should my employer do to protect me at work? </h2>
<p>Those who still need to go into their workplace could face confusion over what rules should be followed.</p>
<p>The Government relaxed its two-metre rule over the summer of 2021, but businesses still have a legal duty to manage the risks faced by their employees. </p>
<p>Employers that do ask workers to come in have been told to put in place a number of measures to protect them from contracting coronavirus, such as keeping offices well ventilated. </p>
<p>The measures can be found on the <a>Government website</a>. </p>
<h2>What about if you need to self-isolate?</h2>
<p>When employers are aware of the requirement to self-isolate, they must not knowingly allow the employee to attend the workplace, according to employment lawyers Eversheds Sutherland. Non-compliance risks a fine, starting from £1,000. </p>
<h2>Can I ask my employer for flexible working?</h2>
<p>Yes, all employees have the right by law to request flexible working, which can include working from home. The only requirement is that they have worked for the employer for at least 26 weeks.</p>
<p>Employers can turn these requests down only if they have reasonable cause to do so, for example if the type of work involved cannot be done from home. They can refuse applications as long as they have a "good business reason". </p>
<p>A move to flexible working would be a permanent change to someone’s working arrangements and may be difficult to reverse. </p>
<p>Alexandra Mizzi of Howard Kennedy, a legal firm, said employers often use the potential impact on performance as a reason to refuse working from home requests. </p>
<p>“However, they will find it much harder to justify refusal when home working has worked out fairly well,” she added. </p>
<h2>Can I claim tax relief or an allowance for working from home?</h2>
<p>The Government website states that you are able to claim tax relief for 'additional household costs' if you have to work from home on a regular basis - either for all or part of the week. </p>
<p>Those who are eligible can claim tax relief for gas and electricity, metered water and business phone calls.</p>
<p>Applicants cannot claim for the entirety of the bill - just for that which relates to work - and you are not eligible if you choose to work from home.</p>

<p>A shop worker with dementia has won an age harassment claim against Asda after bosses asked her if she wanted to retire. </p>
<p>Joan Hutchinson resigned after the company created a “humiliating environment” for the pensioner, with her manager making her feel “too old to be there”, a tribunal heard. </p>
<p>The then 73-year-old had worked at the supermarket branch in Deeside, Wales for 20 years.</p>
<p>In 2020, Mrs Hutchinson was diagnosed with dementia after showing a number of symptoms for the past three years. </p>
<p>During this time, colleagues “violated her dignity” by rummaging through her bag to help her find her personal effects, the employment tribunal heard. </p>
<p>On another occasion, the supermarket changed her hours so she did not have to drive in the dark, the panel heard. </p>
<p>Mrs Hutchinson was later forced to give up driving after going the wrong way around a roundabout, while at work she was often seen to be “forgetful and confused”, the tribunal heard.</p>
<p>However, Mrs Hutchinson refused to speak to the supermarket's occupational health department or have her bosses speak to her family.</p>
<p>While shielding during the first national lockdown, Stacey Weston-Laing, her manager, who had been helping deliver groceries to her door, asked her in several telephone conversations if she wanted to retire. </p>
<p>The tribunal found the question to be discriminatory, as “it is something that would not have been raised with an employee who was not of retirement age in similar circumstances in terms of presenting medical symptoms”.</p>
<h2>Conduct 'amounted to disability-related harassment'</h2>
<p>The shop worker eventually retired on September 25 2020 and took the retail giant to the tribunal. She won her claims of age and disability discrimination, as well as constructive dismissal.</p>
<p>The tribunal heard how Ms Weston-Laing and a number of other colleagues became concerned about Mrs Hutchinson “appearing confused, losing keys and forgetting things”.</p>
<p>During her 12-week isolation during the first lockdown, Ms Weston-Laing brought her shopping while she was isolating and said she would be happy to drop groceries off if she needed anything.</p>
<p>But Joanne Clitherow, Mrs Hutchinson’s daughter, told the tribunal that her mother said Ms Weston-Laing had twice asked if she wanted to retire during a telephone conversation over lockdown.</p>
<p>Her mother said “no” and had been upset, as she felt they did not want her at Asda any more.</p>
<p>Ms Weston-Laing told the tribunal it was Mrs Hutchinson who had initiated the subject, as she was scared of coming back to work having seen things on the news, and wanted to know what would happen if she decided to retire.</p>
<p>However, the tribunal found it was the manager who had raised the possibility of retirement “on more than one occasion”. </p>
<p>Alison Frazer, the employment judge, concluded: “The conduct was unwanted and it related to her condition as it was brought about by her memory impairment.</p>
<p>“It had the effect of violating her dignity. We found that that act amounted to disability-related harassment.”</p>
<h2>‘Unreasonable’ to ask about retirement</h2>
<p>Last month, a tribunal ruled that asking elderly workers when they plan to retire is age discrimination, after a Ministry of Defence civil servant successfully sued his employer.</p>
<p>Ian Tapping, an experienced official, who was in his 60s, had launched a grievance against bosses and was worried he was going to lose his job.</p>
<p>During a meeting with human resources to discuss his concerns, his plans for retirement were raised, an employment panel heard.</p>
<p>James Bax, the employment judge, said: “In the circumstances of someone who wanted to know that his position was secure, it was unreasonable to ask him to consider when he intended to retire."</p>
