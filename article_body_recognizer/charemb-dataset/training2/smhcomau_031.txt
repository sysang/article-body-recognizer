<p>Giant-killers APIA Leichhardt have become the first state-league team to conquer two A-League opponents in the FFA Cup, punishing a woeful Western Sydney Wanderers 2-1 to advance to the quarter-finals and heap pressure on their coach Carl Robinson.</p>
<p>The NPL NSW outfit famously toppled the reigning A-League champions Melbourne Victory at Leichhardt Oval three years ago; on Tuesday night, they did it again at the same venue on another memorable night for the 1987 National Soccer League champions.</p>

<h3><a>‘Arnie, I can’t breathe’: How COVID made Graham Arnold a better coach</a></h3>
<p>The Socceroos mentor has come in for heavy criticism lately, mostly from former teammate Mark Bosnich. In this exclusive interview, he opens up like never before.</p>
<div>‘I want to give you a kidney’: The gay Socceroo whose text message saved a life</div>
<p>The text message that saved Ian Pavey’s life landed at 2.05pm on Sunday, February 28, earlier this year.</p>
<p>“Hey mate it’s Steve from St Vincent’s,” the message said. “I want to investigate if I could give you a kidney. Consider it please.”</p>
<p>Pavey, 67, responded as anyone would when a text offering the vital organ you need to stay alive comes out of nowhere on a Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>“Who is this?” he replied.</p>
<p>Stephen Laybutt, 44, is many things; some of it commonplace, much of it remarkable.</p>
<p>Football fans know him as the journeyman defender who played 15 matches for the Socceroos from 2000-2004 before a ruptured Achilles tendon ended his career while playing for the Newcastle Jets in the A-League in 2008.</p>
<p>More recently, he’s known for his work in the rehab unit at St Vincent’s Private Hospital, spending hours in the pool and gym with patients recovering from surgery for dicky knees and hips.</p>
<p>That’s where he met Pavey, whose knee replacement was a minor concern in comparison to his failing kidneys, which had required dialysis for the past three years.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know how sick I was until I was instantly well,” Pavey says of his transplant. “Steve never faltered.”</p>
<p>Only those close to Laybutt, though, truly understand how much life he had to live before he could help others.</p>
<p>When Adelaide United midfielder Josh Cavallo, 22, revealed in an emotional video in October that he was gay, it was met with almost universal support from the football world as superstar players and powerhouse clubs tweeted their support.</p>
<p>Laybutt never felt that comfortable during his playing career.</p>
<p>Laybutt grew up in Wollongong before getting a scholarship at the Australian Institute of Sport, where he became friends with future Socceroos teammate Lucas Neill.</p>
<p>He signed with the Brisbane Strikers and played up front before injuries slowed him down and he became an aggressive centre-back.</p>
<p>Injuries, including a broken ankle, held him back. But bones and ligaments heal quickly. Coming to terms with your true self takes a little more work.</p>
<p>“[My sexuality] had a massive effect on my career,” Laybutt says. “I wish I’d played in a World Cup – but it was still a half decent career.”</p>
<p>Retirement from football allowed him to confront who he really was.</p>
<p>Life became easier when he met his partner, Michael Lutteral, in 2010. He started working at St Vincent’s Private two years ago.</p>
<p>When Pavey wasn’t working with Laybutt recovering from his knee operation, he was often in another part of the hospital receiving dialysis.</p>
<p>“I just liked his attitude,” Laybutt says. “He was always positive. I thought, ‘I should help this guy’. People have asked me what the thought process was behind it. I just thought it was the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>That’s when he sent the text that saved Pavey’s life.</p>
<p>“You only ever hear the bad stories about hospitals,” Pavey says. “I’m luckier than most people because I live here, in Australia. Good things can happen in this world.”</p>
<p>Pavey had been on the organ waiting list for almost three years. His wife, Roberta, wanted to donate her kidney but, after months of testing, it was deemed incompatible.</p>
<p>“I told people at lunch one day about the text from Steve and they thought someone was hoaxing me,” he recalls. “They didn’t believe me.”</p>
<p>Neither did those closest to Laybutt.</p>
<p>“It was harder selling it to my partner and parents,” Laybutt says. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>Months of testing followed to make sure they were compatible and that Laybutt could live with just one kidney.</p>
<p>Dates for the operation were set then abandoned because of Sydney’s COVID-19 lockdown before the transplant eventually took place in late October.</p>
<p>Ever wondered what it feels like to wake up missing a kidney?</p>
<p>“Very sore!” Laybutt says. “But the kidney took straight away. Ian was doing better than me initially, which happens, but I was up and about after three days.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the hospital, Pavey couldn’t believe his luck.</p>
<p>Laybutt didn’t want any of this written. He only agreed to meet after a friend reached out to the Herald, knowing he had a story to tell.</p>
<p>When Cavallo came out, he sent a message of support via social media but didn’t hear back, which he understands given the avalanche of messages the young player received.</p>
<p>Rumours circulated when Laybutt came out to his circle of friends, and he received calls from journalists.</p>
<p>“A few rumours went around, some media approached me, but I didn’t return their calls,” he says. “I went into hiding. I wasn’t ready to come out. Are you ever ready?”</p>
<p>“I’m comfortable in my skin now,” he says. “I’m not embarrassed or ashamed. It’s who I am.”</p>

<div>Year in review: Kerr stands up and Josh stands tall in wild year of global football</div>
<p>After the nightmare of 2020, this was football’s year of recovery. Fans were allowed back into stadiums, international football resumed and tournaments cancelled the year prior finally took place.</p>
<p>It wasn’t all rosy, however. The cost of COVID-19 hit clubs and players the hardest. Budgets were slashed, players made huge sacrifices just to get the A-League running while greed hit new heights for some of the biggest clubs in Europe.</p>

<p>They barged their way past security and broke into the stadium for a game they didn’t have tickets to attend as violent clashes erupted inside the ground. Fans also booed players taking the knee against racism.</p>
<p>Sam Kerr’s stocks seemed to rise higher than Bitcoin in 2021, with the Matildas captain etching herself as one of the biggest names in Australian sport.</p>
<p>She was voted the third best player in the world, labelled the best female striker on the planet, and won an FA Cup and league title with Chelsea. She even drew praise for knocking over a pitch invader when security was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Her impact is felt with the Matildas brand, which is growing at a similar rate, attracting blue chip sponsors, huge TV ratings and record crowd figures.</p>
<p>Few in Australia would have known much about Josh Cavallo on the morning of October 27. By that evening, he was the talk of world football, receiving praise from Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Liverpool, Borussia Dortmund and Gerard Pique.</p>
<p>Wherever that takes him, he has already made a huge impact on the sport.</p>

<div>McGree transfer highlights Australia’s lowly place in football’s pecking order</div>
<i>The Athletic</i>. That figure could rise as high as $8.3m if McGree, 23, hits certain performance-based benchmarks in his contract.
<p>The answer – according to Bruce Djite, who oversaw McGree’s sale to Charlotte as Adelaide’s ex-director of football – is simple, straightforward, and a little sobering for Australian soccer.</p>
<p>“The A-League is not held in high regard internationally, it’s not given the kudos it deserves,” Djite told the Herald and The Age.</p>
<p>The problem, Djite said, was that most overseas clubs simply aren’t looking to Australia for players and won’t trust them enough to spend big until they’ve seen them perform in better leagues.</p>
<p>For instance, Birmingham never contacted Adelaide about McGree and were brought in on Charlotte’s end of the deal. The Americans deserve credit for spotting a diamond in the rough and finding a way to maximise its worth.</p>
<p>“People have got to understand that when you’re overseas and you’re talking about Australian footballers, no one’s really getting excited. That’s just a fact,” he said.</p>
<p>“MLS is starting to get these sort of deals. They’ve matured to a level well beyond the A-League, if we’re honest,” Djite said.</p>

<div>A-League salary cap 'incompatible' with domestic transfer market, says players union</div>
<p>Australia's players union has offered highly conditional support for a domestic transfer system, saying it would be incompatible with a salary cap.</p>
<p>Although that proposal has yet to be tabled to the game's stakeholders, Professional Footballers Australia called for caution and said an open market cannot work with a salary cap.</p>
<p>The white paper will be tabled next month but players and clubs have already been informally told of FFA's intention to introduce the transfer window and other regulation changes.</p>
<p>The PFA said players were open to the idea but only if other strategic issues were resolved, such as an alignment of the A-League with the National Premier Leagues, regulations on training compensation fees and youth academy registration fees.</p>
<p>More importantly, the PFA wants the salary cap axed, saying it restricts earnings and work opportunities.</p>
<p>FFA declined to comment on the PFA's stance when contacted on Thursday.</p>
<p>While the A-League has never allowed clubs to buy players from other sides, a transfer market did operate in the defunct National Soccer League, which was riddled with financial problems.</p>
<div>FFA keen to establish domestic player transfer system</div>
<p>Football Federation Australia is planning to move ahead with the creation of a domestic transfer system in the A-League, something lower level clubs and advocates of junior development have been urging for years.</p>
<p>Currently, A-League clubs are not allowed to sell players to each other, only to overseas clubs. Lower level clubs in the NPL divisions can receive only small amounts in compensation if an A-League club takes a player they develop or employ.</p>
<p>"It is a vital piece that has been missing from the Australian football landscape for many years now and is central to our current development challenges," Johnson said.</p>
<p>The task now, he said, was to develop a workable, modern system with mechanisms which incorporated "best practice".</p>
<p>"These mechanisms include how we calculate the value of a transfer fee and any associated training reward, creating value in a player's registration to encourage clubs to sign professional players for longer-term contracts."</p>
<p>A transfer system would help "create solidarity between professional and grassroots football", said Johnson, and it would also "encourage fiscal responsibility and sustainability of clubs and competitions".</p>

<p>Ellie Carpenter has embraced the heightened expectations around the Matildas, declaring the team’s ambition to not only win the Asian Cup for the first time in over a decade but keep clean sheets while doing it.</p>
<p>Carpenter and her teammates are preparing to fly to India on Monday, having spent the last week in a pre-tournament camp in Dubai where coach Tony Gustavsson has been putting the final touches on their preparations.</p>
<p>Gustavsson endured a rollercoaster first year in the job in 2021 - while he guided Australia to their best finish at the Olympics, the team won only three of 16 games, and held their opponents scoreless just twice.</p>
<p>The Asian Cup, which starts for Australia on Friday night (Sydney time) against Indonesia looms as a pivotal moment for the Swede.</p>
<p>Carpenter, who was part of the team that lost the 2010 final to Japan under then-boss Alen Stajcic, said the team was aiming high.</p>
<p>“We haven’t won it since 2010, the Asian Cup, and I think all of us girls know that we need to win this. We know that we can if we play our best football and bring what we brought during the Olympics to every game here,” she said.</p>
<p>“We want to bring that trophy home.”</p>
<p>At times, Carpenter - who plays for Olympique Lyonnais and is considered one of the world’s best fullbacks - has been played as a central defender.</p>
<p>“This is a tournament now, so we’re ready, and one of our goals this tournament is to keep clean sheets. Us defenders know that. We’re getting down to business in this tournament.”</p>
<p>There are some fresh faces around the team, with inexperienced quartet Cortnee Vine, Holly McNamara, Karly Roestbakken and Winonah Heatley competing for the final two spots in Australia’s 23-strong selection for the Asian Cup.</p>
<p>“Bringing some new faces in like Jens, our new assistant coach, [means] some new tactics and new words there we haven’t had before. It’s a nice refresher,” Carpenter said.</p>
<p>“His insight is really important for us, especially in tournament mode - anything can happen in a tournament but if you’re prepared for pretty much everything, we’re just going to give ourselves the best shot.”</p>

<h3>‘Australian Open more important than any player’: Stars split on Djokovic visa saga</h3>
<p>Leading players are disappointed that the ongoing visa saga of Novak Djokovic has completely overshadowed the start of the Australian Open, which they are focused on.</p>
<div>Serbian leaders accuse Australia of ‘torturing and tormenting’ Djokovic in ‘scandalous’ decision</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>A unanimous ruling by a three-judge bench rejecting Djokovic’s appeal against the cancellation of his visa on Sunday dealt a final blow to his hopes of chasing a record 21st grand slam win at the Australian Open.</p>
<p>Speaking on the BBC, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic was highly critical of the Australian process that led to Djokovic’s deportation, asking why it dragged on for 10 days.</p>
<p>“He came to Australia with a medical exemption proposal and then you were mistreating him for 10 days.</p>
<p>“Why did you do it? Doing a witch-hunt against him? This is something that no one can understand,” he said.</p>
<p>Djokovic’s family said in a statement they were “very disappointed” with the decision by the Australian authorities, and that the court ruling was related to “politics and all [other] interests”.</p>
<p>“Despite the scandalous behaviour towards Novak, we believed that the sport would win,” the family said.</p>
<p>Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic also described the decision to deport Djokovic as “scandalous”.</p>
<p>Djokovic, 34, flew out of Australia bound for Dubai on Sunday evening after saying in a brief statement that he was extremely disappointed by the court ruling and would respect it.</p>
<p>The Serbian Tennis Association (TSS) said in a statement that the “farce is over” and “politics has beaten sport”.</p>
<p>“Novak Djokovic ... has been denied an opportunity to win a milestone 10th title [in Australia]. Political pressure has led to the revocation of his visa to satisfy ‘public interest’,” the TSS said.</p>
<p>“It begs the question whether athletes will from now on be incarcerated like criminals and deported when it suits the political interests of powerful individuals,” it said.</p>
<p>Serbian Sports Minister Vanja Udovicic, a former professional water polo player, said Djokovic was the best tennis player ever.</p>
<p>“Everything else is nonsense and shame, absurdity and hypocrisy! Legend, pride of Serbia, we are with you,” he said.</p>
<p>In the Serbian capital Belgrade, Djokovic’s home city, many support him though some felt he should have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>“I think Australia should be ashamed of itself and that the decision was not a just one. I am sorry for Novak as a tennis player and as a person,” said Danilo Mircic, a student.</p>
<p>“If I were him, I would get vaccinated and avoid problems in the future,” said Aleksandar Janjic, a middle-aged computer programmer. </p>
<h3>Reaction to the decision</h3>
<p>Novak Djokovic: ”I will now be taking some time to rest and to recuperate, before making any further comments beyond this.</p>
<p>“I am extremely disappointed with the court ruling to dismiss my application for judicial review of the minister’s decision to cancel my visa, which means I cannot stay in Australia and participate in the Australian Open.”</p>
<p>“Despite the scandalous behaviour towards Novak, we believed that the sport would win.”</p>
<p>Aleksandar Vucic, Serbian President: ”I spoke to Djokovic and told him we cannot wait to see him. I told him he is always welcome in Serbia.”</p>
<p>ATP Tour: ”Today’s decision ... marks the end of a deeply regrettable series of events. Ultimately, decisions of legal authorities regarding matters of public health must be respected.</p>
<p>“Irrespective of how this point has been reached, Novak is one of our sport’s greatest champions and his absence from the Australian Open is a loss for the game.</p>
<p>“ATP continues to strongly recommend vaccination to all players.”</p>
<p>Ana Brnabic, Serbian Prime Minister: ”I think that the court decision is scandalous, I am disappointed, I think it demonstrated how the rule of law is functioning or better to say not functioning in some other countries.”</p>
<p>Scott Morrison, Australian Prime Minister: ”I welcome the decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe.</p>
<p>Andy Murray, former world No.1 to BBC: ”It is not great for the tournament because it is better when all of the top players are playing in the event.</p>
<p>“Novak is someone I have known since we were 12 years old, he is someone who I respect and have competed against. I don’t like [that] he is in this situation and I don’t like he has been in detention.</p>
<p>“The situation has not been good all round for anyone. It feels everything here happened extremely last minute and that’s why it became such a mess.”</p>
<p>“Could we have a new number one? Well, it’s possible. I think so much depends on how much Novak is allowed to travel, how many tournaments he is allowed to play, and in the end, is he going to have to get vaccinated?</p>
<p>“His career is on the line and he might have to do something that he doesn’t really want to do.”</p>
<p>Vasek Pospisil, Canadian tennis player: ”Novak would never have gone to Australia if he had not been given an exemption to enter the country by the government.</p>
<p>“He would have skipped the Australian Open and been home with his family and no one would be talking about this mess.</p>
<p>“There was a political agenda at play here with the elections coming up which couldn’t be more obvious.”</p>
<p>Alize Cornet, French tennis player: ”I know too little to judge the situation. What I know is that Novak is always the first one to stand for the players. But none of us stood for him. Be strong @DjokerNole.”</p>
<p>John Isner, American tennis player: ”Nole always has and always will be class. He’s an absolute legend in my book that has brought so much good to millions around the world. This isn’t right.”</p>
<p>Renae Stubbs, former Australian tennis player: ”This is a sad, sad day for tennis, Australia, the Australian Open and obviously for @DjokerNole. I honestly cannot believe it’s come to this ... ”</p>
