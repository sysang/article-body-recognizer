<p>Trump Jr. added, “He’s got to condemn this s—- ASAP.” </p>
<p>The panel voted 9-0 to recommend the contempt charges. The House is expected to vote Tuesday to refer the charges to the Justice Department, which will decide whether to prosecute the former Republican congressman. </p>
<p>“These texts leave no doubt,” Cheney said. “The White House knew exactly what was happening at the Capitol.” </p>
<p>Terwilliger noted that the contempt statute has been used infrequently over time and argued that a contempt referral of a senior presidential aide “would do great damage to the institution of the Presidency.” </p>

<p>“Hey Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home ... this is hurting all of us ... he is destroying his legacy,” Fox News host Laura Ingraham texted Meadows, according to the committee. </p>
<p>“Please get him on tv. Destroying everything you have accomplished,” Brian Kilmeade wrote.</p>
<p>In response to one text from Trump Jr., Meadows texted: “I’m pushing it hard. I agree.”</p>
<p>Cheney also detailed texts that she said were from members of Congress and others in the Capitol. </p>
<p>“Hey, Mark, protestors are literally storming the Capitol,” read one text. “Breaking windows on doors. Rushing in. Is Trump going to say something?”</p>
<p>Another appeared to come from a member in the House chamber. “There’s an armed standoff at the House Chamber door,” the text read, according to the panel. </p>
<a>response of the National Guard</a>, which was delayed for hours as the violence escalated and the
<a>rioters beat police</a> guarding the Capitol building.
<p>In a text exchange with an unidentified senator, the committee said, Meadows said Trump believed Vice President Mike Pence had power to reject electors in his role presiding over the Jan. 6 certification. </p>
<p>Pence did not have that power under the law, as the vice president’s function is largely ceremonial. </p>

<div><div><h1>Far too little vote fraud to tip election to Trump, AP finds</h1></div><div>By CHRISTINA A. CASSIDYDecember 14, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The cases could not throw the outcome into question even if all the potentially fraudulent votes were for Biden, which they were not, and even if those ballots were actually counted, which in most cases they were not. </p>
<p>The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the voting. Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast additional ballots. </p>
<p>The findings build on a mountain of other evidence that the election wasn’t rigged, including verification of the results by Republican governors. </p>
<p>“I just don’t think you should make a fool out of yourself by saying 400 votes,” he said.</p>
<p>These are some of the culprits in the “massive election fraud” Trump falsely says deprived him of a second term: </p>
<p>A Wisconsin man who mistakenly thought he could vote while on parole. </p>
<p>A woman in Arizona suspected of sending in a ballot for her dead mother. </p>
<p>A Pennsylvania man who went twice to the polls, voting once on his own behalf and once for his son. </p>
<p>The cases were isolated. There was no widespread, coordinated deceit. </p>
<p>The cases also underscore that suspected fraud is both generally detected and exceptionally rare. </p>
<p>Even in the state with the highest number of potential fraud cases — Arizona, with 198 — they comprised less than 2% of the margin by which Biden won. </p>
<p>White House spokesman Andrew Bates said the AP’s reporting offered further proof that the election was fairly conducted and decided, contrary to Trump’s claims.</p>
<a>who ordered sanctions against attorneys allied with Trump</a> for intending to create “confusion, commotion and chaos” in filing a lawsuit about the vote-counting process without checking for evidence to support the claims.
<p>Even Trump’s former attorney general, William Barr, said a month after the election that <a>there was no indication of widespread fraud</a> that could change the result. </p>
<p>For its review, AP reporters in five states contacted roughly 340 election offices for details about every instance of potential voter fraud that was identified as part of their post-election review and certification process. </p>
<p>A <a>state-by-state</a> accounting: </p>
<p>The cases are bipartisan. Some of those charged with fraud are registered Republicans or told investigators they were supporters of Trump. </p>
<p>Holz said he had no intention to break the law and only did so after he asked poll workers if it was OK. </p>
<p>After being recognized and confronted, Thurman fled the building, officials said. Thurman’s attorney told the AP the incident was the result of miscommunication at the polling place. </p>
<a>He agreed to plead guilty</a> to a reduced charge of voting more than once in the same election.
<p>Hartle’s attorney said the businessman, who is an executive at a company that hosted a Trump rally before the election, had accepted responsibility for his actions. </p>
<p>In the past, those lists have generated small numbers of fraud cases. In 2018, for example, Wisconsin used the report to identify 43 additional instances of potential fraud out of 2.6 million ballots cast. </p>
<a>Republican state senators issued a report earlier this year</a> saying they had found “no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud” in the 2020 election.
<p>Not only do election officials look for fraud, they have procedures to detect and prevent it. </p>
<p>If everything doesn’t match, the ballot isn’t counted. </p>
<p>Often, an administrative error can raise questions that suggest the potential for fraud. </p>
<p>In other cases, it could be as simple as a voter signing on the wrong line next to another person’s name in a paper pollbook at their polling place. Once researched, it quickly becomes clear no fraud occurred. </p>

<p>The scenes of bedlam and fear at the center of national government erupted quickly, but journalists wondered whether they should have been a surprise.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to believe that this is going on,” said CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. “This is unprecedented, it is dangerous and this is so, so embarrassing for the United States of America.”</p>
<p> The social media giants Twitter and Facebook took the unprecedented step of suspending Trump’s privileges to post messages on their platforms, at least temporarily. Both companies said Trump had violated their policies.</p>
<p>Journalists had gathered to follow Congress’ counting of electoral college ballots to seal the victory of President-elect Joe Biden, a normally routine event turned tense by the challenge to the vote by some of Trump’s political allies.</p>
<p>“The mob has overtaken the process of trying to certify the Electoral College,” said Fox News Channel reporter Chad Pergram. “Security here at the U.S. Capitol has failed.”</p>
<p>Given Trump’s speech and two months of baseless charges that the election was rigged, several journalists raised questions about why law enforcement seemed so unprepared.</p>
<p>“The shock I have is how easy this was,” said NBC’s Chuck Todd.</p>
<p>As images of people banging on a door at the Capitol aired, ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos said, “that is not Ukraine, that is not Belarus.”</p>
<div>Full Coverage: <a>Election 2020</a></div>
<p>“I just wonder whether someone is going to ... call a spade a spade and I am giving you the opportunity right now,” O’Donnell said.</p>
<p>On CNBC, Shepard Smith ordered a tape of Trump’s message stopped in midstream. “Stop the tape,” he said. “That is not true, and we are not airing it.”</p>
<p>CNN’s Abby Phillip said Americans needed to question whether Trump was even capable of leading the country for the next two weeks.</p>
<p>“He is inciting violence against the government itself, lawlessness, vandalism and he’s also completely MIA in terms of his principal job, which is to keep this country safe,” she said.</p>
<p>“We don’t have all the facts,” he said.</p>
<p>There were tense moments for reporters outside the Capitol. A Fox News reporter asked a man to stop blocking his camera. A crew from The Associated Press had its equipment stolen and destroyed.</p>
<p>When Congress resumed debating Wednesday evening, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and MSNBC played all or a portion of Utah Sen. Mitt Romney’s speech condemning objections to the vote certification. Fox did not show Romney.</p>
<p>The nation’s largest broadcasters, ABC, CBS and NBC, devoted virtually all of their prime times to the Washington drama.</p>

<p>The comments concerned his uncle, who contacted Meredith’s mother. His mother, who was alarmed by her son’s extremist social media postings and knew he had been experiencing mental health difficulties, called the FBI. </p>
<p>Meredith’s lawyers argued there was no serious intent for Meredith to follow through on the threats, noting he sent the messages to family and friends.</p>
<p>Family members say Meredith was immersed in the QAnon movement, which is centered on the baseless belief that former President Donald Trump was fighting a cabal of Satan-worshipping, child sex trafficking cannibals. </p>

<div><div><h1>Texts show top Trump defenders’ private alarm on Jan. 6</h1></div><div>By WILL WEISSERTDecember 15, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Here are some of the frantic messages that Trump allies sent to <a> White House chief of staff Mark Meadows</a> as the insurrection was unfolding and what they’ve said publicly about the events since then:</p>
<a>impeached </a> President Trump for inciting the insurrection — Trump Jr. began advancing
<a>the false narrative</a> that authorities knew violence was coming on Jan. 6 but didn’t do enough to prepare — in part because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ignored warnings about what might occur.
<p>GOP members of Congress, including House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy, <a>have since advanced</a> similarly false claims about Pelosi delaying military assistance to help Capitol Police officers trying to quell the attack. </p>
<p>“Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home,” the Fox News Channel host wrote, according to text excerpts Cheney read. “This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy.”</p>
<a>false</a> claims that the rioters included leftist provocateurs, saying, “They were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports Antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.”
<a>false assertion</a> that there were “legitimate concerns” that voter fraud potentially marred the 2020 election won by Democrat Joe Biden, but she noted, “That never should have lent any license to violence or other chaos.”
<p>Ingraham said during her Tuesday show that, “Both publicly and privately, I said what I believe: that the breach of the Capitol on Jan. 6 was a terrible thing.” </p>
<p>“Crimes were committed. Some people were unfairly hounded and persecuted and prosecuted,” she said. “But it was not an insurrection.” </p>
<p>“Can he make a statement? Ask people to leave the Capitol?” the Fox News Channel host wrote to Meadows about Trump, according to text excerpts read by Cheney.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Hannity opened his show likening what occurred during the Capitol attack to demonstrations around the country after the murder of George Floyd by a Minnesota police officer. </p>
<p>“All riots, obviously, are bad. All of them,” Hannity said. “And on this program, we strongly condemn the violence on Jan. 6 just like we condemned all of the violent riots in the summer of 2020.”</p>
<p>Hannity called Cheney reading his Meadows text “a weak attempt to smear yours truly and, presumably I guess, President Trump,” and argued that what he wrote was consistent with what he said on the air the day of the Capitol attack. </p>
<p>“I say the same thing in private I say to all of you,” Hannity said. </p>
<div><div><h1>House votes to hold Mark Meadows in contempt in Jan. 6 probe</h1></div><div>By FARNOUSH AMIRI and MARY CLARE JALONICKDecember 15, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Meadows was also Trump’s top aide in the White House, giving him more plausible grounds to claim executive privilege. Bannon had not worked in the White House since 2017.</p>
<p>The Justice Department will also be weighing those factors as prosecutors decide whether to move forward with the case. If convicted, Bannon and Meadows could each face up to one year behind bars on each charge. </p>
<a> frantic texts from the day of the attack</a> revealing members of Congress, Fox News anchors and even Trump’s son urging Meadows to persuade the outgoing president to act quickly to stop the three-hour assault by his supporters.
<p>Republicans on Tuesday called the action against Meadows a distraction from the House’s work, with one member calling it “evil” and “un-American.” </p>
<p>Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio praised Meadows: “Make no mistake, when Democrats vote in favor of this resolution, it is a vote to put a good man in prison.” </p>
<p>Trump also defended Meadows in <a>an interview, </a> saying: “I think Mark should do what’s right. He’s an honorable man. He shouldn’t be put through this.” </p>
<p>And Meadows’ attorney George Terwilliger defended his client in a statement before the vote, noting that he had provided documents to the panel and maintaining that he should not be compelled to appear for an interview.</p>
<p>Terwilliger said, “The Select Committee’s true intentions in dealing with Mr. Meadows have been revealed when it accuses him of contempt citing the very documents his cooperation has produced.”</p>

<p>Meadows himself has sued the panel, asking a court to invalidate two subpoenas that he says are “overly broad and unduly burdensome.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters: “I do think we’re all watching, as you are, what is unfolding on the House side. And it will be interesting to reveal all the participants who were involved.”</p>
<p>He added that he was not in contact with Meadows on the day of the attack.</p>
<p>Democrats quoted at length from Jan. 6 text messages provided by Meadows while he was cooperating with the committee.</p>
<p>Trump Jr. added, “He’s got to condemn this s—- ASAP.” In response to one of Trump Jr.’s texts, Meadows said: “I’m pushing it hard. I agree.”</p>
<p>“These texts leave no doubt,” she said. “The White House knew exactly what was happening at the Capitol.” </p>
<p>The investigating panel has already interviewed more than 300 witnesses, and subpoenaed more than 40 people, as it seeks to create the most comprehensive record yet of the lead-up to the insurrection and of the violent siege itself. </p>

<p>Hannity, like Ingraham a prime-time host, wondered whether Trump could give a statement and ask people to leave the Capitol.</p>
<p>The network had no immediate comment Tuesday about the texts.</p>
<p>For journalists, the ethical lines are clear: Your job is to report the news, not try to influence the actions of newsmakers.</p>

<p>“I don’t consider them in the traditional definition of a journalist,” said Aly Colon, a professor of media ethics at Washington and Lee University. “But even so, they are representative of a news operation at Fox.”</p>
<p>Their actions leave questions about whether their loyalty was to Trump or to viewers, who expect to learn about the news from them or at least get news analysis, Colon said.</p>

<p>Not everyone thinks what the Fox hosts did was wrong, including a consultant who ran Fox’s news operation for eight years during the 2000s.</p>
<p>“I do think it was helpful to have them, or anyone else who had influence or potential influence over the president, tell him what needed to be done,” said Michael Clemente, a former executive vice president at Fox News.</p>
<p>At a point of national crisis, that’s more important than the objectivity rules that most journalists are bound by, he argued.</p>
<p>Graham said he didn’t think the news will be a bombshell to Fox viewers. “It shows Fox being anti-riot, so they will be heartened by that,” he said.</p>
<p>She complained about the “continual video loop” of the Capitol breach. She said the demonstration was “99% peaceful,” but “because of a small contingent of loons, these patriots have been unfairly maligned.”</p>
<p>Some critics said they saw a disconnect between what the Fox personalities said publicly and texted privately.</p>
<p>On their shows Tuesday, both Hannity and Ingraham argued that there was no difference between what they said publicly on Jan. 6 and what they texted Meadows.</p>
<p>“Both publicly and privately, I said what I believe — that the breach of the Capitol was a terrible thing,” Ingraham said.</p>

<div><div><h1>As Jan. 6 probe begins, Dem vows: ‘We have to get it right’</h1></div><div>By MARY CLARE JALONICKJuly 26, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, Bennie Thompson, didn’t realize the severity of the Jan. 6 insurrection until his wife called him.</p>
<p>People are breaking into the building, London Thompson told him, and it was on television. “I’m watching people climbing over the wall right now,” she said.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t register,” the Mississippi Democrat recalled in an interview with The Associated Press. “I said, ‘You can’t break in. There’s police and barricades and a lot of things out there.’”</p>
<p>“It was a horrible day,” said Thompson, “still almost surreal that it even occurred.”</p>
<a>as the chairman of a select committee</a> that will investigate the attack. The panel will hold its first hearing Tuesday with
<a>police officers who battled the rioters</a>.
<a>a violent insurrection that many House Republicans increasingly play down and deny</a>.
<p>“We have to get it right,” Thompson said. If the committee can find ways to prevent anything like it from happening again, “then I would have made what I think is the most valuable contribution to this great democracy.”</p>
<p>Several Democrats and Republicans said Thompson was the right choice to lead an investigation that is certain to be partisan and fraught. </p>
<p>New York Rep. John Katko, who is now the top Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, gave a similar assessment. Thompson is “a good man, a patriotic American” and a “productive partner,” Katko said in statement. </p>
<p>Only two Republicans voted to create the panel — Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger. Pelosi first appointed Cheney to the committee and then <a>added Kinzinger</a> on Sunday after McCarthy <a>withdrew his picks</a>. </p>
<p>“I’m looking forward. in the long run, to try to have as many of the 13 members that I can,” Thompson said last week. </p>
<p>“I think he has a very even keel that will help him get through this,” Schiff said. </p>
<p>Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, another Democrat appointed to the select committee, says both parties have “partisan brawlers” — and Thompson is not one of them. </p>
<p>“He’s a workhorse, so he likes getting stuff done,” Raskin said. “And I think that’s the right spirit for this.” </p>
<p>The effort did not end in violence and John Kerry, the defeated Democratic presidential candidate, did not lead or join the effort to deny Bush his victory.</p>
<p>A frequent critic of Trump, Thompson joined other Democrats in filing <a>a lawsuit against the former president after the insurrection</a>, charging that he incited the attack and conspired to prevent Congress from certifying Biden’s victory. </p>
<a>the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers</a>. The Justice Department has filed charges against members of those groups in connection to the attack, and the panel is expected to investigate them as part of its probe.
<p>The FBI’s assessments about the growing dangers of domestic extremism, he said, show that “the significance of this committee’s work is as important as it can ever get.” </p>

<div><div><h1>Florida man arrested, charged in Jan. 6 attack on US Capitol</h1></div><div>December 15, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A Florida man has been arrested on charges related to storming the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 insurrection and attacking a police officer, officials said.</p>
<p>Attorney Jason Kreiss, who is representing Courson, said he couldn’t comment on the case because he hasn’t yet seen the government’s evidence.</p>
<p>Since Jan. 6, more than 700 people have been arrested in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach of the U.S. Capitol, officials said. More than 220 people have been charge with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.</p>
<div><div><h1>Congress OKs bill giving Capitol Police power to call troops</h1></div><div>By MARY CLARE JALONICKDecember 15, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Capitol Police Chief is poised to gain new authority to call National Guard troops to the Capitol under legislation that passed the House and Senate this week. </p>
<p>“Jan. 6th showed us that every minute counts during an emergency,” said Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the chairwoman of the Rules panel and lead author of the legislation. </p>
<p>The bill would also require the board, which meets privately, to appear publicly at joint House and Senate hearings. The Capitol Police Board hasn’t met in a bicameral hearing since 1945, according to the Senate Rules Committee.</p>
<p>The report was heavily critical of the board, finding that three of its members on Jan. 6 did not understand their own authority and could not detail the statutory requirements for requesting National Guard assistance. </p>
<p>Two of the three board members, the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms, were pushed out in the days after the attack. Sund, the Capitol Police chief, resigned under pressure. Current Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger was sworn in in July.</p>
<p>Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, the top Republican on the Rules panel, said he has long been concerned that the structure of the police board has created unnecessary delays. </p>
<p>“This bipartisan bill addresses a major security challenge that was evident on January 6th, and is part of our ongoing effort to strengthen Capitol security moving forward,” Blunt said. </p>
<p>Blunt said the Capitol building and staff are safer than they were a year ago. But he added there is more to be done.</p>
<p>“This issue is not unique to us. Every police force in America is looking for more officers to get on their team,” Blunt said about the nearly 200 officers who have left the force since Jan. 6</p>

<div><div><h1>Colorado, Florida men accused of assaulting police on Jan. 6</h1></div><div>By COLLEEN SLEVINDecember 15, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>DENVER (AP) — A man from Colorado and another from Florida who are accused of assaulting police officers in separate incidents during the Jan. 6. riot at the U.S. Capitol were being held in federal custody Wednesday.</p>
<p>Courson’s lawyer, Jason Kreiss, said he could not comment on the allegations because he has not seen the evidence in the case yet. </p>
<p>According to court documents released Tuesday, the officer was part of a line of officers protecting the state Capitol. MacCracken is also accused of pushing and shoving a second officer in the line.</p>
<p>MacCracken appeared in federal court in Grand Junction Tuesday. He will continue to be detained at least until another hearing scheduled for Friday.</p>
<p>He is represented by a lawyer from the Denver federal public defender’s office, which does not comment on cases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two men who allegedly assaulted officers, Donald Hazard, 43, of Hurst, Texas, and Lucas Denney, 44, of Mansfield, Texas, during the riot were arrested Monday.</p>
<p>Footage shows Hazard grappling with U.S. Capitol Police officers, falling down a set of stairs under scaffolding on the west side of the Capitol and fighting with one officer as they were both falling, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. </p>
<p>A telephone message and an email sent to Hazard’s lawyer was not immediately returned. No lawyer was listed as representing Denney in court records. </p>

<p>The committee said Waldron “reportedly claimed to have visited the White House on multiple occasions after the election” and had spoken to Meadows eight to 10 times.</p>
<p>The angry mob of Trump’s supporters were echoing his false claims as they brutally beat police and broke into the building that day, interrupting the certification of President Joe Biden’s victory. </p>

<div><div><h1>Former WVa councilman enters plea in Capitol riot case</h1></div><div>December 17, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>PARKERSBURG, W.Va. (AP) — A former councilman for the city of Parkersburg, West Virginia, who is charged with breaching the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 riot has pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts.</p>
<p>Eric Barber, 43, admitted to entering the Capitol and stealing a portable charger from a C-SPAN media station during a remote hearing Thursday, the Parkersburg News and Sentinel reported.</p>
<p>“When I entered the Capitol building, I knew we weren’t supposed to be there,” he said after the judge asked if the charges were accurate.</p>
<p>Barber was elected to the Parkersburg City Council in 2016 as a Democrat. He changed his registration to independent a year later, then changed it again to Republican before losing his re-election bid last November. </p>
<p>As part of the plea agreement, other misdemeanor counts will be dismissed. Barber’s sentencing was set for March 31.</p>

<div><div><h1>Toughest sentence yet for any Capitol rioter: over 5 years</h1></div><div>By COLLEEN LONGDecember 17, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A Capitol rioter who attacked police officers working to hold back the angry pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6 was sentenced Friday to more than five years behind bars, the most so far for anyone sentenced in the insurrection.</p>
<p>Robert Palmer, 54, of Largo, Florida, wept as he told U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan that he recently watched a video of his actions that day and could not believe what he was seeing.</p>
<p>“Your honor. I’m really really ashamed of what I did,” he said through tears. </p>
<p>Palmer said in a handwritten letter to the judge that he felt betrayed by Trump and his allies who fed them conspiracy theories. </p>
<p>“Trump supporters were lied to by those at the time who had great power,” he wrote. “They kept spitting out the false narrative about a stolen election and how it was ‘our duty’ to stand up to tyranny.” </p>
<p>Palmer, who has been held at the D.C. jail among fetid conditions that prompted a review by authorities, said it wasn’t fair that he be punished so severely when the ringleaders aren’t even behind bars. </p>

<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Courtright, 23, of Hurricane, West Virginia, sobbed as she told U.S. District Court Judge Christopher Cooper that “if I could take back anything in my life it would be my actions on Jan. 6.” </p>
<a>like scores of other rioters</a> — reveling in the moment. “Can’t wait to tell my grandkids I was here!” she wrote, and inside the Senate chamber, she was photographed holding a “Members only” sign.
<p>“I will never be the same girl again,” the University of Kentucky student said through tears. “This has changed me completely.”</p>
<p>After the riot, <a>she dug in on social media </a> when she was criticized for her actions, before eventually deleting her accounts. Courtright is among the youngest of those charged in the Capitol riot so far.</p>
<p>Her attorney on Friday argued she had no idea what she was doing and that she wasn’t a political activist — she didn’t even vote in the election she was there to protest. The judge seized on that during his remarks. </p>
<p>Cooper also noted that Courtright made it to the floor of the U.S. Senate at about the exact time that Ashli Babbitt, on the House, side was shot dead. </p>
<p>“Do you know how many people died on Jan. 6, 5. Including Ms. Babbitt?” he asked. “Five.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how many Capitol police officers committed suicide after Jan. 6, harmed from the trauma of that day? Four,“ the judge added. “So was it cool to have been there?”</p>
<p>“No,” she answered emphatically. </p>
<p>Still, the judge said the recommended six months in prison was too high and sentenced her instead to 30 days, one year of supervised release, and 60 hours of community service. </p>
<p>He said he hoped she could pull her life together and that she “should not be judged by the worst mistake you have made in your life.”</p>
<div><div><h1>Republicans resist saying 3 simple words: ‘Joe Biden won’</h1></div><div>By THOMAS BEAUMONTDecember 17, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>They are just three little words, but they have become nearly impossible for many Republicans to say: “Joe Biden won.”</p>
<p>In Minnesota this week, five GOP candidates for governor came up with 1,400 other words when asked by conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt for an answer. </p>
<p>On NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday, GOP Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas would only concede: “Joe Biden was sworn into office.”</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Insurrection prompts year of change for US Capitol Police</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Teachers at culture war front lines with Jan. 6 education </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Jan. 6 attack posed loyalty test for Indiana Rep. Greg Pence</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Trump cancels Florida press conference scheduled for Jan. 6</h4></a></div></li>
<p>When <a>The Associated Press set out to count every fraud claim</a> in the states disputed by Trump, it found fewer than 475 potential cases — 15 hundredths of 1% of Biden’s winning margin in those states. </p>
<p>The doubt has been fueled by Trump, who has argued without evidence that the election was “rigged” and has urged his supporters to reject the outcome. He’s set out to oust fellow Republicans who voted to certify the results. </p>
<p>“Painfully, Joe Biden won the election, and it’s very painful to watch. He’s the president. We know that,” McDaniel told Washington reporters at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor. </p>
<p>On Friday, Josh Mandel, a GOP candidate for Senate in Ohio, called for more investigations into the vote in battleground states. “I think Trump won,” he said in an interview on Hewitt’s radio show. </p>
<p>“It is an important question and needs to be framed, I think, as I did. I expect it will be often asked and answered (or not) of many candidates in the year ahead,” Hewitt tweeted after the Minnesota debate. </p>
<p>The answers demonstrate the pressure for Republican primary candidates to appeal to, or at least not offend, the vocal Trump wing of the party, strategists say. </p>
<p>But in February, though he stopped short of saying Biden “stole” the election, he was equally hesitant to declare Biden had been “legitimately elected,” according to the nonpartisan political watchdog group Politifact. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, the discomfort for Republicans played out in full view from the debate stage in suburban Minneapolis.</p>
<p>One-by-one, five Minnesota Republicans running for governor talked around Hewitt’s question: “Did President Biden win a constitutional majority in the Electoral College.” </p>
<p>State Sen. Michelle Benson spilled 240 words recruiting Republican poll-watchers and blasting Minnesota’s Democratic secretary of state before Hewitt bluntly asked again: “Did President Biden win?”</p>
<p>Her answer: “He was certified by Congress as having won the Electoral College.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has scheduled a trial in April for two former Virginia police officers charged in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.</p>
<p>An order signed Friday by U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper says a jury trial in Washington, D.C., will start on April 4 for former Rocky Mount police officers Thomas Robertson and Jacob Fracker.</p>
<p>Robertson and Fracker pleaded not guilty in February to charges including obstruction of an official proceeding and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building. </p>
<p>The FBI says they posed for a photograph inside the Capitol during the attack and later posted about the riot on social media.</p>
<p>Town Manager James Ervin announced the officers’ firings less than a month after the riot.</p>
<p>More than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. Over 150 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanor charges, and over 50 have been sentenced. Trial dates have been set for more than 40 defendants.</p>

<p>A Michigan man has pleaded guilty to illegally entering the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, as an angry mob tried to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden’s victory following a rally by then-President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors say Daniel Herendeen of Chesterfield Township, in Macomb County, entered the building “wearing body armor, a black military style backpack, black goggles, and an American flag mask,” The Detroit News reported. </p>
<p>Herendeen pleaded guilty to entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds during a hearing Friday in Washington. The charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison and a $100,000 fine. </p>
<p>Police were beaten and bloodied, five people died and there was about $1.5 million in damage done to the U.S. Capitol during the insurrection. More than 700 people have been charged. </p>
<div><div><h1>Man who joined Capitol melee gets nearly 4 years in prison</h1></div><div> By MICHAEL KUNZELMANDecember 21, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>A man who joined a mob in one of the most violent attacks on police during the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol was sentenced on Monday to nearly four years in prison.</p>
<p>“The attack on the Capitol that day was an attack on the very rule of law in our country,” Lamberth said.</p>
<p>Justice Department prosecutors recommended a four-year prison sentence for Thompson, a longtime resident of Washington state who moved to Georgia approximately six months before the riot.</p>
<p>“Autism is not and should not be an excuse for bad behavior, but rather, it should be considered when a person’s individual culpability and degree of social understanding is called into question,” she wrote.</p>
<p>The judge also said autism isn’t an excuse for assaulting a police officer. He noted that Thompson had a job that paid him $90,000 a year before the riot.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone <a>told a congressional committee</a> in July that the fight in the tunnel was “nothing short of brutal.” He was pulled into the mob, beaten and repeatedly shocked with a stun gun.</p>
<p>Thompson’s actions on Jan. 6 “show an absolute disregard for the rule of law coupled with a willingness to incite and engage in violence,” prosecutors wrote in a court filing.</p>
<p>Thompson, who worked for a rental property management company, drove to Washington, D.C., from Atlanta. He didn’t enter the Capitol before he left.</p>
<p>In his apology letter to the officer, Thompson said he is still trying to understand his “inexcusable” behavior on Jan. 6.</p>
<p>“You deserve to be treated with respect and I didn’t show you any with my actions that day,” Thompson wrote.</p>
<p>Thompson is the third rioter to be sentenced for assaulting police at the Capitol. The other two, <a>Robert Palmer</a> and <a>Scott Fairlamb</a>, were sentenced to prison terms of 63 months and 41 months, respectively.</p>
<p>More than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot. Over 150 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanor offenses punishable by a maximum of six months imprisonment. Nearly 70 defendants have been sentenced.</p>

<p>A California man has been sentenced to three years in prison for threatening harm in text messages sent during the attack on the U.S. Capitol to a New York-based family member of a journalist, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Robert Lemke, 36, was sentenced Monday in Manhattan federal court, according to Damian Williams, U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. </p>
<p>Lemke, a resident of Bay Point in the San Francisco Bay Area, pleaded guilty in October to one count of making threatening interstate communications.</p>
<p>The messages sent to the journalist’s relative stated in part that the journalist’s “words are putting you and your family at risk. We are nearby, armed and ready.”</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged that the messages were among threatening text and audio messages sent to approximately 50 people from November 2020 through early January 2021.</p>
<p>In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein also sentenced Lemke to three years of supervised release.</p>

<p>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — An Iowa man charged earlier for his participation in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol was arraigned Tuesday on a new federal indictment that includes a felony count that could carry up to 20 years in prison.</p>
<p>Leo Christopher Kelly, 36, of Cedar Rapids, who has been free on pretrial release, appeared via video for his arraignment. His attorney, Kira West, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf.</p>
<p>A plea agreement apparently is no longer under consideration, according to the information that prosecutor Michael Gordon James provided Judge Royce Lamberth during the hearing.</p>
<p>“The parties have discussed a negotiated plea but that will not occur in this case so this matter should be set for trial,” James said.</p>
<p>Lamberth said he will set at trial date later. He scheduled a status update hearing for Feb. 25.</p>
<p>He was <a>released Jan. 19 </a> by a federal magistrate who noted his extremely limited criminal history.</p>

<div><div><h1>In milestone deal, Proud Boy pleads guilty in Capitol riot</h1></div><div>By MICHAEL KUNZELMAN and LINDSAY WHITEHURSTDecember 22, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>A New York man pleaded guilty Wednesday to storming the U.S. Capitol with fellow members of the far-right Proud Boys, a milestone in the Justice Department’s prosecution of extremists who joined the Jan. 6 insurrection.</p>
<p>Matthew Greene is the first Proud Boys member to publicly plead guilty to conspiring with other members to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote. He will also cooperate with authorities under the terms of his plea agreement. </p>
<p>Greene was arrested in April after a grand jury indicted him in the same case as two other alleged Proud Boys, Dominic Pezzola and William Pepe. They have pleaded not guilty.</p>
<p>Other extremist group members have been charged with conspiring to carry out a coordinated attack on the Capitol, including more than 20 people linked to the anti-government Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>On the morning of Jan. 6, Proud Boys members met at the Washington Monument and marched to the Capitol before President Donald Trump finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House.</p>
<p>In August, U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly ordered Greene held in pretrial detention.</p>
<p>“He encouraged an associate to read up on guerrilla warfare and to use the tactics used by the Taliban and to ‘be prepared to do uncomfortable things,’” prosecutors wrote.</p>
<p>Greene “has concluded that his personal beliefs and ethics do not align with those of the Proud Boys,” and he is “anxious to publicly disavow his brief membership in this group,” his lawyer wrote.</p>
<p>More than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the riot. Over 150 of them have pleaded guilty, including at least two other defendants with Proud Boys ties.</p>
<p>Andrew Bennett, a Maryland man whom prosecutors described as a Proud Boys “admirer” but not a group member, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor offense and was sentenced in October to three months of home detention.</p>

<p>All told, eight of 17 Missourians charged in the Capitol riot have entered guilty pleas.</p>

<p>The judge didn’t immediately rule on Thursday’s request by prosecutors. </p>
<p>“He then dropped to the ground and stated something to the effect of ‘Just kill me now.’ He then stated, ‘It’s over,’” prosecutors wrote in a court filing.</p>
<p>Police recovered an AR-15 assault rifle, 60 rounds of ammunition, weapon accessories and combat fatigues from Grant’s car. Grant bought the rifle in April from a North Carolina gun dealer, according to a police report.</p>
<p>“Grant’s statements are of such a concerning nature that there is reason to believe he is a danger not only to the community, but also to himself,” prosecutors wrote.</p>
<p>Peter Cooper, Grant’s attorney in the riot case, didn’t immediately respond Friday to an email seeking comment.</p>
<p>Prosecutors initially didn’t seek Grant’s pretrial detention after his Oct. 14 arrest in North Carolina on Capitol riot-related charges.</p>
<p>Grant also entered the Capitol and went inside at least two private Senate offices, according to prosecutors.</p>
<div><div><h1>Anti-coup protests in Sudan amid turmoil after PM resigns</h1></div><div>By SAMY MAGDYJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>CAIRO (AP) — Sudanese took to the streets in the capital of Khartoum and other cities on Tuesday in anti-coup protests as the country plunged further into turmoil following the resignation of the prime minister earlier this week. </p>
<p>Sudan has been politically paralyzed since the coup. The military takeover came more than two years after a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government in April 2019. </p>
<p>Ahead of the protests authorities closed major roads and streets in Khartoum and Omdurman, according to activists. That tactic has been employed in the past two months to prevent demonstrators from reaching government buildings.</p>
<p>Hamdok’s resignation has thrown the country into further uncertainty and “deprived the generals of the fig leaf” they used to continue their military rule, said Mohammed Yousef al-Mustafa, a spokesman for the association.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for “meaningful dialogue” between all Sudanese parties to “reach an inclusive, peaceful and lasting solution,” according to U.N. spokesman Stéphane Dujarric.</p>
<p>Western governments warned that a unilateral move by the military to appoint a new prime minister and Cabinet risks plunging the country into conflict.</p>
<p>In a joint statement Tuesday, the European Union, the U.S., the U.K. and Norway said they won’t support “a Prime Minister or government appointed without the involvement of a broad range of civilian stakeholders.”</p>
<p>Sudan’s largest Umma party called for the return to the 2019 constitutional document governing the transitional period, which calls for the military to relinquish the leadership of the ruling sovereign council.</p>
<p>“This is the only way for the salvation of the nation, the integrity of the transitional period and the accomplishment of its tasks within the agreed-upon timeframe,” the party said in a statement.</p>
<p>Elbadawi, <a>who resigned in 2020</a>, was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Jibril Ibrahim, a rebel leader who joined Hamdok’s government last year following a peace deal with the transitional administration, called for a political compromise to resolve the crisis.</p>
<p>“Let us agree to work together for the sake of Sudan,” tweeted Ibrahim.</p>

<p>MOSCOW (AP) — Russian President Vladimir Putin said Sunday he would ponder a slew of options if the West fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding NATO’s expansion to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back its military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Russia has denied an intention of launching an invasion and, in its turn, accused Ukraine of hatching plans to try to reclaim control of the territories held by Moscow-backed rebels by force. Ukraine has rejected the claim.</p>
<p>Asked to specify what such Moscow’s response could be, he said in comments aired by Russian state TV Sunday that “it could be diverse,” adding that “it will depend on what proposals our military experts submit to me.”</p>
<p>Putin said the talks with the U.S. will be held in Geneva. In parallel, negotiations are also set to be held between Russia and NATO and broader discussions are expected under the aegis of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.</p>
<p>In remarks broadcast Sunday, Putin said Russia submitted the demands in the hope of a constructive answer from the West.</p>
<p>“We didn’t do it just to see it blocked ... but for the purpose of reaching a negotiated diplomatic result that would be fixed in legally binding documents,” Putin said. </p>
<p>He reaffirmed that NATO membership for Ukraine or the deployment of alliance weapons there is a red line for Moscow that it wouldn’t allow the West to cross.</p>
