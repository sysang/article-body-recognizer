<div>Move to postpone Tokyo Games set to impact Birmingham 2022</div>
<p>The decision to postpone the Olympics to 2021 will have a ripple effect on other big sporting events and throw the timing of the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in 2022 into question.</p>
<p>The Olympics being held in 2021 immediately crowds the calendar with the Euro 2020 soccer event already postponed to June and July next year.</p>
<p>If the world athletics are delayed to 2022, as organisers have admitted is now a possibility, that would potentially cause problems for the timing of the Birmingham Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p>Birmingham organisers said they are confident the games will not be affected.</p>
<p>"We remain fully committed to hosting in Birmingham in 2022," Games chief David Grevemberg said.</p>
<p>"Over the coming weeks, we will continue to work collaboratively with international federation partners to ensure the XXII Commonwealth Games maintains its position and stature on the global sporting calendar."</p>
<p>Birmingham 2022 is due to start on 27 July.</p>
<p>Athletics is the biggest sport at both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games and so central to decision-making.</p>
<p>Tokyo organisers finally made their decision on postponing only after the US Track and Field and then World Athletics implored them to shift the date.</p>
<p>These scheduling matters however are trifling compared to the more important decision to move this year’s Olympics.</p>
<p>The world championships being moved into 2022 would pose problems for Birmingham.</p>
<p>Staging two major athletics meets in one season would be very difficult for athletes and so there will be pressure for Oregon to push back for 12 months to 2022.</p>
<div><p>As opposed to the world championships the Commonwealth Games only relates to a comparatively small number of countries.</p></div>
<div><div><div>Michael Gleeson is an award-winning senior sports writer specialising in AFL and athletics.Connect via Twitter or email.</div></div></div>
<div>World athletics championships to run into Commonwealth Games</div>
<p>The rescheduled world athletics championships will finish days before the start of the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, after being pushed back a year amid a reshuffle caused by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
<p>The next world track and field championships will be held in Oregon, USA, from July 15-24 in 2022.</p>
<p>The new dates for the world championships mean they will end just three days before the Commonwealth Games begin in England on July 27 and run to August 7.</p>
<p>The European athletics championships will be held in Munich, Germany, from August 15-21.</p>
<p>"This will be a bonanza for athletics fans around the world," Sebastian Coe, president of World Athletics, said in a statement. "They will be treated to six weeks of absolutely first-class athletics."</p>
<p>"We would not have chosen to have three major championships back-to-back but it will give us a unique opportunity to promote our sport and its stars around the globe over a six-week period."</p>
<p>The previous world championships were held in Doha last year and the 2023 edition will take place in Budapest.</p>
<p>World Athletics said these dates would enable athletes to compete in all three events, where eligible.</p>
<p>"The new schedule will prevent a direct conflict between any of these major events and, with careful programming, will ensure athletes can compete in up to three world-class competitions," said World Athletics in a statement.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Games, postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, will be held from July 23 to August 8 2021.</p>
<p>Swimming is likely to move its world championships as well because it overlaps with the new Olympic dates in 2021.</p>

<p>The AFL and Cochrane Entertainment, the organisation engaged to produce next month's grand final entertainment, have been caught in a furore over a call-out for performers who will not be paid.</p>
<p>Dance schools in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast were invited by email to have dancers apply to participate in a "large scale performance" on October 24 that was looking for "strong performers" over the age of 15.</p>
<p>The event is the half-time entertainment at the AFL Grand Final, which will take place at The Gabba this year, with a dance ensemble of 300 people. Those who were successful began rehearsals on Sunday.</p>
<p>The dance community said the AFL Grand Final was an example of performers being exploited.</p>
<p>There will be two tiers of dancers used at the event: professional paid dancers will perform on stage with an as yet unnamed singer, and the mass volunteer dance ensemble. Volunteers will receive merchandise and meals during rehearsals.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of performing artists are out of work due to the coronavirus pandemic with many unable to access JobKeeper as a result of the transient nature of their employment.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance, the union that represents dancers, said it had been assured only dance students would be used in the production.</p>

<h1>From the Archives, 1962: Great day for Australia at Games</h1>
<h2>Australia had won four gold medals for swimming and diving at the Commonwealth Games in Perth, bringing the swimming tally to 14 gold medals from 19 events decided, and Australia's overall total to 21.</h2>
<p>PERTH, Wednesday. — Australia has won four gold medals for swimming and diving at the Commonwealth Games, bringing the swimming tally to 14 gold medals from 19 events decided, and Australia's overall total to 21.</p>
<p>England won the other two gold medals decided today, also for swimming and diving.</p>
<p>Two world records were set in a day of controversial finishes. Gold medal winners were Kevin Berry (Australia), who won the 220-yard butterfly from team-mates Neville Hayes and Brett Mill.</p>
<p>Berry's time lopped 11.4s off the previous Games record.</p>
<p>Anita Lonsborough (England) won the 110-yard Breaststroke in a hotly disputed finish with New Zealand champion Vivien Haddon.</p>
<li>Sue Knight (Australia) won the springboard title for her second gold medal, while Lyn McArthur (Australia) was third.</li>
<li>Brian Phelps (England) won the highboard event for his second gold medal. Australian Graham Deuble was second.</li>
<li>Australia's Men's 4 x 110-yard freestyle relay team shattered the world record by 1.2 secs in winning the event in 3 min 43.9 secs</li>
<li>Australia's medley relay team bettered the Australian record by winning in 4 min 12.4 secs.</li>
<p>The Australians' performance in taking 14 of the 20 events, with more wins expected, has given local swimming a terrific lift.</p>
<p>Miss Sargeant's time was given as three tenths of a second slower than Miss Ludgrove. But the automatic watches showed that Miss Ludgrove had recorded 2 min. 35.27 secs., and Miss Sargeant 2 min. 35.45 sees.</p>

<div>From the Archives, 2006: A story of hope and fish, the Games open in Melbourne</div>
<p>First published in The Age on March 16, 2006</p>
<p>A story of hope - and fish</p>
<p>None of which was traditionally likely to involve ducks, trams or small children, but then the modern Games opener requires more than bagpipes, bearskins and a volley of muskets for its effect.</p>
<p>Each host city must stage something bigger, louder, brighter and smokier than its predecessors . . . which in this case pits Melbourne against the likes of Manchester, Cardiff and Brisbane, so the bar is not insurmountable.</p>
<p>And how did Melbourne rate? Well, we may have lacked a vast child-stuffed kangaroo, but we did have several species of waterfowl, fish and a koala in its underwear. There was no Kylie, just Delta Goodrem (Kylie Lite), Dame Kiri and Steve Kilbey.</p>
<p>Last night’s ceremony, therefore, was bold, bright, and deeply strange. What narrative there might have been was only revealed through a close reading of the complex, detailed storyboard that accompanied the production.</p>
<p>An observer innocent of this text might as well have been watching an unsubtitled Latvian staging of Lear. In the round. Played by fish, with constant fireworks.</p>
<p>None of which is to say that last night’s show - cheap seats $490 - didn’t fulfil the exacting requirements of a great opening ceremony. The compulsory elements, held in common among all performances of this type, were well executed.</p>
<p>There was, of course, a national anthem, a tune presented at the MCG in sign language, presumably in case of public address failure.</p>
<p>There was an oath, a flag raising, welcome speeches and the mandatory nod to indigenous residents whose ancient capitulation made all of this possible.</p>
<p>Cat Empire actually appeared to be playing their instruments live.</p>
<p>It was big, it was loud, it was colourful and occasionally airborne. In the end it all went up in smoke. In other words: a triumph of its type.</p>

<p>FFA are set to begin the process for the overhaul of Australia's transfer system, aimed to rapidly accelerate player development that will pump a potential $40 million in transfer revenue into the domestic game every year.</p>
<p>The proposals and consultation process are aimed at achieving two targets; creating an internal domestic transfer economy and increasing Australia's international transfer revenue at least 15-fold.</p>
<p>The A-League's aim of matching Japan's transfer revenue could clubs rake in more than $40m a year.</p>
<p>FFA will also run transfer education programs for all clubs, including NPL teams, on matters around training compensation fees for junior players and ways to increase player value on the transfer market.</p>
<div>Sweet 16: Australia tipped for biggest Olympic gold medal haul since 2004</div>
<p>The Australian Olympic Committee has dumped its medal target for Tokyo but it hasn’t stopped expectations soaring about what this Australian team could achieve.</p>
<p>Gracenote’s predictions are a statistical model produced by crunching the results from previous Olympic Games, world championships and world cups and weighing other factors that might influence an Olympic campaign.</p>
<p>If the predictions are accurate:</p>
<p>• Kaylee McKeown will leave Tokyo as one of the brightest stars of global swimming, with the 20-year-old tipped to become a triple Olympic gold medallist.</p>
<p>• Slalom canoeist Jessica Fox will top an already extraordinary sporting CV with a brace of gold medals at her third Olympics.</p>
<p>• Australia’s world champion women’s coxless four rowers will become the first Olympic champions in the newly added event.</p>
<p>• And Australian women will win 24 of the 40 medals and contribute to another four medals in mixed events.</p>
<p>Under the projections, Australia would be sixth for gold medals, with 16. On the overall medal count, however, Australia’s 40 medals have them projected to finish ninth, just behind France and Italy.</p>
<p>And therein lies the rub.</p>
<p>Bullish predictions for Australian teams heading into previous Olympics have been hitched to the world rankings of swimmers, and in the case of some athletes, dragged like an anchor through the water.</p>
<p>Gracenote’s analysis leading into Rio had Australia winning 16 gold medals and finishing fifth on the medal table. Instead, Australia won eight gold, its smallest haul since 1992, and finished 10th overall.</p>
<p>The AOC’s publicly stated goal of a top-five medal table finish at the Olympics, for years an article of faith in the Australian Olympic movement, was exposed as wildly optimistic.</p>
<p>Three-time Olympian Kenny Wallace, a deputy chef de mission in Tokyo and member of the athletes’ commission, which convinced the AOC to ditch medal targets, said it was also unhelpful to athletes.</p>
<p>“To set a target is irrelevant because everyone who is here wants to do the best that they can anyway,” he said on Tuesday. “We don’t need to push down their throats that this is the target we need to reach.</p>
<p>“The decision came years ago within the athletes’ commission to drop that medal target because we saw it as another burden that we didn’t need to have.”</p>
<p>“Will we see the full benefits in Tokyo? Definitely not. But I think we have seen enough to know that this will build us into a really good position for Paris and hopefully, by the time the Brisbane Games come along.”</p>
<p>The AIS still places a premium on Olympic, Paralympic and Commonwealth Games medals when making decisions about high-performance funding but since overhauling its funding strategy three years ago, it now takes a more balanced approach.</p>
<p>The AIS, like the AOC and athletes, wants to win, but it also sees supporting athletes who can become role models for their communities, and a sports system that can produce healthier, happier athletes, as central to its mission.</p>
<p>This means that Tokyo will not be the sole determinant whether an athlete or a sport continues to receive government funding.</p>
<p>As for these Games, the AOC has adopted a broader notion of what success looks like.</p>
<p>The disruption of the pandemic on international competition, the relative isolation of the Chinese team and an absence of regular drug testing has made Tokyo a particularly difficult Olympics to predict.</p>
<p>Some of the Australian team predictions will raise eyebrows.</p>
<p>But if the Gracenote predictions prove to be accurate, Australia will leave the Olympic village with a diverse and eclectic group of medallists.</p>
<p>Sally Fitzgibbons is tipped to win a gold medal in surfing when the first Olympic shortboard competition gets under way at Tsurigasaki Beach and the depth in our triathlon squad means we are likely to medal in the newly included mixed team relay.</p>
<p>Sailor Matthew Wearn has arrived in Tokyo as favourite in the laser class and our mixed trap shooting team of Laetisha Scanlan and James Willett are also predicted to win gold.</p>
<p>If these heady expectations are realised, more than 80 Australians could come home with a medal around their necks.</p>

<p>On Friday, Newbery wrote a letter to the Brisbane Arrests Court explaining her failure to appear in the court to deal with the stealing charge.</p>

<div><h5><a>Flashback</a></h5></div>
<h3><a>From the Archives, 1956: Women’s great day at Olympics</a></h3>
<p>On day 10 of the Melbourne Olympics, Australian women dominated the track and pool.</p>
<div>Decathlon great tells Moloney to pick one championships next year</div>
<p>One of the greatest decathletes of all time has advised Australia’s rising star Ash Moloney not to attempt to back up for two decathlons in barely two weeks next year when the Commonwealth Games follow days after the world championships.</p>
<p>Ashton Eaton, the two-time decathlon Olympic gold medallist and three-time world champion, said Tokyo bronze medallist Moloney would be better to choose one championships rather than push himself to attempt the double.</p>
<p>Damian Warner, the Olympic champion from Tokyo, is from Canada and is also able to compete at both. It would be highly likely he would compete at the worlds over the Commonwealth Games.</p>
<p>Eaton, the former world record holder, did not hesitate when asked if it was conceivable to attempt the two decathlons within weeks of each other.</p>
<p>“No. Not at that level. People have done it and he could do it, obviously he could do it no problem, but I don’t think it is a good idea,” he said.</p>
<p>“Maybe at his age, 21, it wouldn’t be so bad because the body recovers quickly but when you are an elite athlete, no. Put it this way, if it was me I would choose one or the other.”</p>
<p>Eaton was the overall world record holder in decathlon and still holds the world 400 metres record in the event. The 21-year-old Australian Moloney has the third quickest time in the 400m after Eaton.</p>
<p>That speed in running events is what will set the young Moloney up to improve on his Olympic bronze in years to come, according to Eaton.</p>
<p>“He has had a lot of success, more success than I had at that age and that’s going to be interesting for him, how he handles that.</p>
<p>“If he wants to continue on until Brisbane that is from now an 11-year-career. Which will not be easy, it’s just … it just will not be easy.</p>
<p>Eaton, who was in a live online conversation with Moloney this week as part of an AIS sports technology conference, said the advantage he and Moloney had was their strengths were in running, which were events that scored.</p>
<p>“I tried to minimise my mistakes in my weak events. Things like the shot put, I am not going to throw 17 metres like Kevin Mayer but if I can not throw under 14 then I am OK. That was the strategy, limit the damage and maximise the upside.</p>

<div>‘Arnie, I can’t breathe’: How COVID made Graham Arnold a better coach</div>
<p>The Socceroos coach rarely drops his guard and opens up like this about himself but is doing so, here in the plush surrounds of the Bathers’ Pavilion at Balmoral Beach, after reaching out to this masthead late last week.</p>
<p>Specifically, he wanted to come out swinging for his players following the national side’s last three World Cup qualifying matches: a 2-1 away loss to Japan, a scoreless home draw against Saudi Arabia and a 1-1 away draw with China.</p>
<p>Those results have them parked in third spot in Group B, behind Japan and Saudi Arabia, with four matches remaining, the first against Vietnam on January 27.</p>
<p>Just what this means for the Socceroos on their path to the World Cup finals in Qatar in November depends on your perspective.</p>
<p>The unicorn-and-rainbow view is their “destiny is in our own hands”. A top-two finish will see them go straight through.</p>
<p>The doomsday outlook is if they finish third they will have to play the third-placed side in Group A. Win that and they will have to walk through the valley of death otherwise known as playing the fifth-best team from South America. Yuck.</p>
<p>They’re not laughing now.</p>
<p>“Bozza is the least of my worries,” Arnold says dismissively. “I have bigger worries. He’s entitled to his opinion. He’s a great guy.”</p>
<p>Speaking on Stan Sport FC, Bosnich seized on the remarks.</p>
<p>“I wonder what not playing great looks like,” the former Socceroos goalkeeper said. “Playing great for me means you’ve won 3-0 and it’s a Barcelona-esque-from-10-years-ago performance … Come on.”</p>
<p>Bosnich also said Arnold would take his criticism as a personal attack. They hadn’t spoken for 18 months, he claimed.</p>
<p>“I can show you an email an interview I did with Boz, on Fox Sports, in November last year,” Arnold says. “It’s not true.”</p>
<p>I love Boz. I love Arnie. They’re devoid of bullshit and ooze passion for their code. Whenever anyone in Australian football rumbles with one another, it feels more like a family feud than the Hatfields taking on the McCoys.</p>
<p>I ask Arnold why he hasn’t reached out to his friend to clear the air.</p>
<p>“Why hasn’t he reached out to me?” he shoots back. “He’s the journo. If he wants to ask questions, why didn’t he reach out to me?”</p>
<p>Arnold says he doesn’t watch TV nor read the newspapers, but there are enough people in his circle who keep him in the loop about what’s being said about him and his side.</p>
<p>On the morning we meet, his phone pings with texts alerting him to Bosnich’s comments the night before, and then published in the Herald, that Australia will struggle to qualify for Qatar unless there’s a “tweak” of tactics.</p>
<p>It’s a regular criticism of this particular Arnold team: a one-dimensional attacking structure that struggles to break down opposition defences.</p>
<p>“When Bozza says a tweak of tactics, I wish it was that easy,” Arnold says. “A tweak? What’s a tweak?”</p>
<blockquote><p>‘If I went on TV and said ‘we’d played shit and it wasn’t good enough’, what am I going to get [from the players] next game?′</p></blockquote>
<p>He picks up a glass and moves it a few centimetres.</p>
<p>This is the important context that Arnold’s critics either don’t appreciate or won’t adequately acknowledge: no other Australian team has had to endure what the Socceroos have had in the past year or so.</p>
<p>He’s lived out of a suitcase for most of it, deciding not to return to Sydney because he would have spent more time in hotel quarantine than out of it.</p>
<p>The Socceroos have had to make it work because the alternative was not playing in the World Cup.</p>
<p>The match against Saudi Arabia highlighted Arnold’s struggle: just four days before the match, only five of his players were in the country.</p>
<p>Arnold identified a long time ago that players are delicate souls. He had to back them publicly, not bash them up.</p>
<p>It explains why he believes he’s become a better human and better coach.</p>
<p>As for an end date, Arnold won’t entertain his future beyond the Socceroos.</p>
<p>“But I’m not going anywhere. We’re building something that’s great. I know I’m not allowed to say that word, but that’s my belief.”</p>

<h3><a>‘Best striker in the world’: The inevitability of Kerr becoming Australia’s greatest ever</a></h3>

<h3><a>Sam Kerr leads Chelsea to FA Cup final win over Arsenal at Wembley</a></h3>
<p>Matildas superstar Sam Kerr scored a stunning individual goal as Chelsea thrashed Arsenal 3-0 to win the Women’s FA Cup at Wembley Stadium on Sunday.</p>
<div>‘Best striker in the world’: The inevitability of Kerr becoming Australia’s greatest ever</div>
<p>Every few generations, an Australian player comes along that commands the spotlight in British football.</p>
<p>The last two decades have been relatively quiet for Australians in the UK – until Sam Kerr moved to Chelsea in 2019 and put herself on centre stage.</p>
<p>Chelsea’s fans voted Kerr the player of the match and her face was plastered on the front page of Monday papers in Britain.</p>
<p>Many online were quick to draw comparisons of Kerr to another Chelsea great, Didier Drogba, while others were left bemoaning how she was only voted the third best women’s player on the planet six days earlier.</p>
<p>Australia’s captain finished behind Barcelona’s attacking midfield duo Alexia Petullas and Jennifer Hermoso in the Ballon d’Or last week, causing a slight stir within the Anglo football world.</p>
<p>“As far as I’m concerned Sam Kerr is the best striker in the world,” Chelsea coach Emma Hayes said after the FA Cup final.</p>
<p>And few could argue. Kerr has a goal haul replicated by few, a list of individual accolades she couldn’t even keep count of and a trophy cabinet that’s growing every season.</p>
<p>But it’s not the statistics that make the strongest claim for Kerr being the world’s best striker. It’s the seeming inevitability that follows her success.</p>
<p>The rarest commodity in football – goals – are simply routine for Kerr. So much so that she strikes fear into even the most seasoned defenders. Even the world’s elite are at odds how to keep her quiet.</p>
<p>A fortnight ago, the coach of world champions USA conceded he had no reliable strategy to stop Kerr. </p>
<p>Monday morning was yet another example. Australia wasn’t surprised to wake up to the news of Kerr scoring a double in the final, only the manner in which she did.</p>
<p>The striker is on the cusp of breaking the scoring record for her country across both the Matildas and Socceroos, needing just one more to equal Tim Cahill’s record of 50. Similarly, that is a matter of “when” not “if”.</p>
<p>Had she misfired against Arsenal, she would have had legitimate excuses. Instead, she walked away with the trophy and two sublimely taken goals.</p>
<p>“Champions don’t make excuses or become victims or look for anybody else to manage them,” Hayes said of Kerr.</p>
<p>At a time when there are no Australian men playing regularly in England’s top flight, the women have become the flag bearers.</p>
<p>But it’s Kerr who’s the toast of the town. She’s already joined the ranks of Marston, Johnston, Bosnich, Kewell and Viduka.</p>
<p>The inevitability of her career is that it is another matter of “when, not if” she’ll surpass them. If she hasn’t already.</p>

<h3>‘Forget the gender’: Why the new-look A-League Women is glued to the men</h3>
<p>What was once known as the W-League is now called the A-League Women. Can a new name, logo and strategy revive interest in the competition?</p>
<div>‘I sense something there’: Can teen sensation lift Kerr even higher?</div>
<p>Kerr is the talk of football after her spectacular second-half double for Chelsea not only sealed a 3-0 win over Arsenal in the FA Cup final, but earned her player-of-the-match honours.</p>
<p>It comes after the 28-year-old finished third in the voting for the women’s Ballon d’Or, following another year in which she has been an ever-present threat for Australia at international level.</p>
<p>But Gustavsson senses there is even more to come from Kerr if another Matildas teammate - much like strike partner Fran Kirby does at Chelsea - can help lighten the attacking burden on her shoulders.</p>
<p>Fowler, 18, could be the one. Kerr last month hailed the teenager as the best finisher in the Matildas team and said the Cairns-born prodigy was on track to becoming a world-class talent like herself.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, you just sense something. And I sense something there,” Gustavsson told the <i>Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i>.</p>
<p>“Without putting too much pressure on them, but when you watch the games, you see that there’s something there. She can help get more out of Sam.</p>
<p>“If you have a threat in front of the backline as well, Sam can focus more on being the vertical threat in the goal zone. Right now, Sam has to link a bit too much, and Sam wants to carry the team.</p>
<p>She now plays at French top-division club Montpellier, where she has scored eight goals in 29 appearances, and has emerged as a key player for the Matildas this year.</p>
<p>“What I love with Mary is she’s a young player that still is humble enough to know that she has a lot to learn. But also, she’s confident enough to know that she’s good enough,” Gustavsson said.</p>
<p>Chelsea manager Emma Hayes hailed Kerr as a “credit to Australia” and the world’s best striker after the FA Cup final.</p>
