<p>From lockdown winner to post-pandemic loser quicker than it takes the fridge alarm to beep furiously as you frantically unload the weekly Waitrose shop.</p>
<p>Flogging appliances online should be a fairly straightforward business but not in these supply-constrained, logistically challenged times, as AO World shareholders are finding out to their great cost once again.</p>
<p>Perhaps that’s a good thing – a profit warning sent investors scrambling for the exit on Tuesday morning and the share price crashing another 15pc.</p>
<p>Having briefly flirted with heady heights of more than 400p at the turn of the year, the shares ended the day at 105p, a fall of more than three quarters and way below the 285p listing price.</p>
<p>And no wonder. It's the second time that forecasts have been sharply downgraded since the beginning of October, giving the impression of a company that suddenly finds itself in the middle of a mounting crisis.</p>
<p>Warnings of “meaningful supply chain challenges” and “poor availability” just weeks before Christmas will send shockwaves through the high street.</p>
<p>None of these issues are exactly new to UK businesses, which raises questions about whether AO World is simply managing them less adroitly than others.</p>
<a>was always going to be a one-off</a>.
<p>Even if you buy the argument that lockdown accelerated the structural shift in shopping habits, such levels were never going to be sustainable once the high street reopened.</p>
<p>Profits are now expected to be between £10m and £20m, a hefty shortfall in a short space of time, even taking into account the extraordinary macro-economic circumstances.</p>
<p>And a warning that it expects such pressures to last into the second half of the financial year will cause yet more alarm.</p>

<header> <h1> Boris Johnson rejects energy bill VAT cuts to help struggling families </h1> <p> Tory MPs hit back after Prime Minister says such a move would help ‘a lot of people who perhaps don’t need the support’ </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lucy Fisher, Deputy Political Editor and Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:11pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Boris Johnson has indicated that he will not cut VAT on energy bills because it would help “a lot of people who perhaps don’t need the support” with rising living costs.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister on Tuesday night dismissed demands to enact the move to help struggling families, amid fears that <a>residential energy bills could double</a> to £2,000 in April when the price cap is set to rise.</p>
<p>Speaking at a televised Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson was challenged about a vow he himself made in May 2016 to scrap VAT from energy bills if <a>Britons voted Leave</a>.</p>
<p>He denied having misled voters with his previous remarks, but signalled that the Treasury would consider actions that were targeted only at the families most in need of support.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said he was “not ruling out further measures” and acknowledged that the UK did now enjoy the “freedom to regulate our own VAT”, but set out his opposition to the proposal.</p>
<p>His intervention came as the weather is about to get colder, with the <a>first widespread frost of the winter</a> expected this week, meaning families are likely to rely more heavily on central heating.</p>
<a>growing cost of living squeeze</a>.
<h2>‘VAT should be cut as a Brexit dividend’</h2>
<p>Mr Johnson’s comments came after 20 Tory MPs and peers <a>wrote to The Telegraph</a> last weekend demanding that he intervene to address the cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>Mr Mackinlay said: “VAT should be cut permanently as a Brexit dividend. Heating your home is as much of a right as buying children’s clothes. We don’t do it for fun. It’s a basic right and need.”</p>
<p>The MP, who chairs the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, also renewed calls for green levies to be suspended on energy bills, which analysts estimate could save households about £200 a year.</p>
<p>He warned that targeting support for poorer families through the welfare system would be “a disincentive to work, which is a very unconservative principle”.</p>
<h2>Boris Johnson more ‘Heath than Thatcher’</h2>
<p>The news came as Liam Fox, a former Conservative Cabinet minister, accused Mr Johnson of being more like Sir Edward Heath than Margaret Thatcher over tax and spend.</p>
<p>Writing for the ConservativeHome website, Dr Fox said that he did not think that “all is well in the Boris Johnson premiership”.</p>
<p>He added: “For many Conservatives, including myself, the current government smacks too much of ‘big tax, big spend, big state’ – more reminiscent of Edward Heath than Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>“<a>The question of the Northern Ireland border</a> remains a thorny subject, and for many a continued border within the United Kingdom is incompatible with the entire ethos of a Conservative and Unionist Party.”</p>
<p>Dr Fox added that it was important to remember “we are 11 years into a period of Conservative government (or at least Conservative led) and it would be more remarkable if we were not having a dip in the polls”.</p>
<p>He added that “governments have recovered from much worse positions than this, as those who remember the more difficult times of the 1980s will attest”.</p>
<p>He said: “Leadership changes can bring about short-term improvements in political fortunes, but the internal wounds can leave long lasting scars, as the political assassination of Margaret Thatcher prove.”</p>
<a>issues such as levelling up</a>.
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> I'm still mortified by my emergency ambulance callout </h1> <p> Covid has made the entire nation feel like their health is a burden on the NHS </p> </div> </div> </header>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Judith Woods <time> 18 November 2021 • 7:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>The breathlessness and exhaustion crept up on me over a period of a few days last month. Pains in my jaw. A stabbing in my ear. An abrupt need to sit down while queueing outside the bank.</p>
<p>At home, I started cooking supper, then I felt the colour drain, I stumbled. My husband put me to bed, gave me a glass of water, switched on the Archers.</p>
<p>My chest grew tight, my breathing shallow, pains radiating up my arm to my jaw. Both my parents had heart disease; my mother almost died. My father died of cardiac arrest in bed while reading three of us a story.</p>
<p>My sister had a heart attack a few years ago. I felt as though I was being sucked into a sinkhole so I reached for my phone and called 999.</p>
<p>An ambulance came – within an hour, my husband says, although I was too confused to keep track. The paramedics carried out an ECG and checked my blood pressure. I opened my eyes, was able to focus.</p>
<p>False alarm. I was fine. Nobody said the words “panic attack” but I knew. And my first response? Not a flush of relief but a rush of guilt. I thanked them effusively, apologised too profusely.</p>
<p>They wanted to take me to hospital to get thoroughly checked out. I demurred, too mortified to take up any more precious, limited resources. </p>
<p>I knew how lucky we were to have been seen so quickly.</p>
<p>Since July, 10,000 more people have died from non-Covid illnesses than is usual in England and Wales, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. We are in crisis on all fronts.</p>
<p>During the summer a neighbour of mine – a nonagenarian cancer survivor – fell over in his garden. He couldn’t get up but he point blank refused to let anyone call 999.</p>
<p>He’s not wrong. This week we learnt of Emily Saunders, a singer-songwriter on holiday in Devon who fell outside at 8pm, breaking her leg.</p>
<p>She called for an ambulance and the operator said she shouldn’t move but there were no available vehicles; they were all queueing at the nearest AE, 18 miles away.</p>
<p>“The experience of not knowing when or even if one would turn up was terrifying,” she said. It would be almost seven hours on the cold concrete before a crew arrived. Did I mention she also suffers from an autoimmune disease and asthma?</p>
<p>Then came hours waiting to be admitted. She was finally given a bed literally 24 hours after her accident. A disgrace? At least Saunders lived to tell the tale.</p>
<p>I fear that for this Government tragedies are becoming statistics. How else can it be that 4,500 people died after waiting 12 hours on a hospital trolley last year?</p>
<p>Friends have told <a>how their children’s mental health collapsed during the lockdowns</a>. They needed urgent help. Or if not help then support. Or if not support then advice.</p>
<p>Fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, grandparents. Patients who waited patiently – their reward, a death without dignity.</p>
<p>I still find my callout excruciatingly embarrassing. How dare I waste everyone’s time? Our NHS may have pulled through the pandemic but the truth is, it no longer feels like ours.</p>
