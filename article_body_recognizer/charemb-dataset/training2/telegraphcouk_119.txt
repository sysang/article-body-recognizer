<p>The target, never named, wasn’t hard to identify: Britain, who’d committed the cardinal sin of going it alone, securing a vaccine supply, and vaccinating 27% of her population when the EU lags at 6% (and France at 4%).</p>
<a>Macron’s public criticism of that same vaccine</a> earlier this month, plucked out of one unsubstantiated German newspaper report. (The Oxford vaccine, despite new Scottish data over 400,000 people, is still reserved in France to the under-65s).

<p>Aside from the deliberate snub to his deputy leader, Sir Keir Starmer’s reshuffle this week has widely been seen as a good one. Which, admittedly, is a bit like asking, “Apart from that, Mrs Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?”</p>
<p>While the shadow cabinet has now been strengthened with experience and political ability, Starmer is taking a big gamble in placing his hopes on a group of individuals who fought at his side to frustrate the will of the Leave-voting majority.</p>
<p>Cooper herself has already paid a heavy price for her Remainer tendencies, seeing the majority in her Northern seat slashed from nearly 15,000 to barely 1,000 at the 2019 election.</p>
<p>While Starmer appears to care little about the Left-Right balance of his frontbench, the pro-Remain balance is likely to leave his party dangerously vulnerable in the very areas where it needs to prosper at the next election.</p>

<p>Few could oppose such a system. If a minister is acting ultra vires, then he or she is acting against the will of parliament as expressed in legislation, and if a senior judge won’t point this out, who will?</p>

<a>Liberal Democrat</a> – clinging to the edge for dear life. So which one does he kick off first? The Tory, of course. Business before pleasure.
<a>North Shropshire will go to the polls</a> to elect a replacement for disgraced former cabinet minister
<a>Owen Paterson</a>. It’s one of those classic battlegrounds at which the Lib Dems have historically gained advantage by being the less hated of the three main options.

<p>In most normal countries, the preceding paragraph would be a marmalade-dropping moment. They’ve been threatening who for what?</p>
<p>Welcome to Scotland, where citizens must constantly be reminded that it is the Conservative Party who are the villains, lest we start to examine the available evidence and draw some very different conclusions.</p>
<p>In fact it’s regarded as much more than a sin: it is seen as treason itself. <a>In Scotland in 2021, it is a justification for hatred</a>.</p>
<p>She later revealed the full extent of the abuse she had received: she had been left in tears after the messages, with one threatening to damage her van, while another warned her not to “walk down dark alleyways”.</p>
<p>“The messages left me in tears, but the support since has been fantastic, I’ve had a lot.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to hand it to the Tories,” was the refrain often heard over post-campaign drinks. “If we behaved like the Tories and got rid of rubbish leaders, we’d have won a lot more elections.”</p>
<p>The ongoing <a>saga of Partygate</a> has further eroded Tory MPs’ support for the prime minister. The North Shropshire by-election next week could well become the latest flashpoint in the road to a no confidence vote.</p>
<p>The loss of a formerly safe seat is always a good excuse for any party to start panicking, and Conservatives need less of an excuse than usual these days. Which is odd, for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>That could still happen, of course, especially if further misjudgments made by the Prime Minister come to light. But for the time being the Tories should thank God that Labour is not yet seen as their obvious replacement as a party of government.</p>
<a>defeat in North Shropshire</a> as well deserved and much will depend on the party’s reaction and on the degree of humility expressed following defeat.

<p>The venue was the No lobby of the House of Commons. Drinks, as far as we know, were not served (but who knows <a>what photographic evidence to the contrary may emerge</a> in the near future). </p>
<p>The occasion in question was a get-together of old friends, on the far-Left of Labour and the mainstream of the Conservative party, to rebel against Covid passports. </p>
<a>Jeremy Corbyn</a> — who would regularly, frequently and happily walk through the division lobby in protest at whatever the then government was trying to do.

<header> <h1> 'A cheering mob danced on the statue': How slave trade symbol became focus of Black Lives Matter protests in Bristol </h1> <p> Police admitted they chose not to intervene but are now hunting those responsible </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Martin Evans, CRIME CORRESPONDENT <time> 7 June 2020 • 8:37pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>For 125-years the imposing figure of Edward Colston has overlooked the centre of Bristol, his bronze statue testament to his 17th Century philanthropy .</p>
<p>But for many in today’s proudly diverse city, the former slave trader’s presence has become a divisive reminder of a dark past when fortunes were built on the inhuman transportation and sale of men, women and children.</p>
<p>A fierce debate has raged in recent years as to whether the statue should be removed and placed in a museum rather than remain on its city centre plinth.</p>
<p>But that debate became redundant when protesters attending the Black Lives Matter march tore it down and unceremoniously dumped it in the city’s harbour.</p>
<p>In scenes reminiscent of when Saddam Hussein’s statue was torn down in Baghdad during the Iraq war, demonstrators used ropes to pull the bronze memorial from its pedestal.</p>
<p>A cheering mob then danced on the statue before dragging it through the streets and throwing it in the nearby quay.</p>
<p>Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, condemned the act as one of “sheer vandalism”, while her predecessor, Sajid Javid, who grew up in Bristol, said the actions of the mob were “criminal damage".</p>
<p>Ms Patel said: "I think that is utterly disgraceful and that speaks to the acts of public disorder that actually have now become a distraction from the cause in which people are actually protesting about and trying to empathise and sympathise with.</p>
<p>"That is completely an unacceptable act and that speaks to the vandalism - again as we saw yesterday in London - but sheer vandalism and disorder completely is unacceptable.</p>
<p>"It's right actually the police follow up on that and make sure that justice is undertaken with those individuals who are responsible for such disorderly and lawless behaviour."</p>
<p>“If Bristolians wants to remove a monument it should be done democratically - not by criminal damage.”</p>
<p> Avon and Somerset Police said they had launched an investigation to identify those “who clearly committed an act of criminal damage”.</p>
<p>There was mounting criticism over the failure of the police to intervene, but one officer told the BBC that it had been a tactical decision in order to prevent tension.</p>
<p>“So once it was down we made a decision the right thing to was to allow it to happen because what we did not want is tension.”</p>
<p>But some said the actions of the demonstrators had been inevitable because the people of the city had been ignored on the issue for too long.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid today should never have happened because this statue should have been taken down peacefully and put in a museum which is where after all we should remember history.”</p>
<p>Protestor, John McAllister, 71, had earlier removed black bin bags which had been used to cover the statue.</p>
<p>He said: ”It says 'erected by the citizens of Bristol, as a memorial to one of the most virtuous and wise sons of this city'.</p>
<p>"The man was a slave trader. He was generous to Bristol but it was off the back of slavery and it's absolutely despicable. It's an insult to the people of Bristol."</p>
<p>Meanwhile in London marchers also defaced the statue of wartime leader Winston Churchill, daubing the words ‘Churchill was a racist’ on the monument.</p>
<p>Someone also climbed on to the podium and strapped a Black Lives Matter sign to the belly of the statue.</p>
<p>A group of four uniformed police stood nearby as the crowd took photographs and chanted “Churchill was a racist”.</p>
<p>Banners with messages such as "British Colonialism is to Blame" and "What if it was your son?" had been left at the base of the column.</p>
<p>The incidents marred a second day of Black Lives Matters protests, which had largely gone off peacefully, despite warnings from the Government and the police not to take part because of the continuing dangers from coronavirus.</p>
<p>Thousands marched through Manchester without incident, while there was also a large gathering outside the US Embassy in London, with protesters denouncing the death of George Floyd in custody.</p>
<p>On Saturday night 14 police officers were attacked when a violent mob began throwing missiles and fighting outside Downing Street.</p>
<p>In one sickening incident a female mounted police officer was left with serious injuries when her horse bolted and ploughed into a traffic light.</p>
<p>The officer was thrown from the horse and suffered a broken collarbone and collapsed lung.</p>
<p><a>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick condemned the actions of what she said had been a violent minority</a>.</p>
<p>"I know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. </p>
<p>“There is no place for violence in our city. Officers displayed extreme patience and professionalism throughout a long and difficult day, and I thank them for that.</p>
<p>"I would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face this deadly virus."</p>

<h1> Ghislaine Maxwell 'could file for mistrial' after juror reveals he suffered childhood sexual abuse </h1>
<p> Speaking to media for the first time, a juror indicated that he had suffered past abuse and that this had informed his decision </p>
<div> <div> By Josie Ensor, US Correspondent, New York <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:54pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Ghislaine Maxwell could file for a retrial after one of the jurors in her sex-trafficking trial revealed he was a victim of childhood sexual abuse, legal experts told The Telegraph.</p>
<p>Speaking for the first time since <a>Maxwell was found guilty in by New York court last week,</a> one juror described himself as a survivor of sexual abuse and indicated that this had informed his decision.</p>
<p>“In the first instance it would likely form the basis for a motion to Judge (Alison) Nathan for a new trial,” she said.</p>
<p>Maxwell's legal team has already declared its intention to appeal, however, it has not laid out the legal grounds.</p>
<p>A judge may declare a mistrial in a criminal case for several reasons, including lack of jurisdiction and incorrect jury selection. When a mistrial occurs, the proceedings become null and void, however a new trial may then be heard.</p>
<p>The US legal system allows both the prosecution and defence teams to veto candidates.<a> In selecting 12 primary jurors</a>, Maxwell’s team had 10 challenges and the prosecution six.</p>
<p>In an interview with the MailOnline on Wednesday, "Scotty" said he could not remember that question. He also revealed that another member of the jury shared an experience of sexual abuse during deliberations.</p>
<p>One potential juror was dismissed during the judge’s questioning, known as voir dire, after she told the court she informed her sister’s school of alleged sexual abuse her sister had suffered at the hands of a teacher.</p>
<p>Unlike in the UK, jurors in the US are permitted to speak to the media after they have reached their verdict and they have been dismissed.</p>
<p>Juror "Scotty David", who used his real first and middle name but declined to give his surname, told Lucia Osborne-Crowley of Law360 that he believed Maxwell’s four accusers.</p>
<p>He told his fellow jury members that, like the victims in the case, he did not speak of the assault until later. “I didn’t disclose my abuse until I was in high school,” he said.</p>
<p>He said he believed this helped the jury understand the women’s delay in reporting.</p>
<p>"David believes this helped the jury understand that it’s possible that these women were telling the truth," read the piece, which featured on <a>The Independent</a> website.</p>
<a> Maxwell has been held accountable.</a> This verdict shows that you can be found guilty no matter your status.”
<p>Maxwell, 60, is facing up to 65 years in prison after being found guilty on five of her six charges.</p>
<h1> Prince Andrew challenges accuser’s residency status in bid to have sex abuse case thrown out </h1>
<p> Duke of York’s legal team makes second attempt to have civil case against him dropped, claiming Virginia Roberts Giuffre is not a US citizen </p>
<div> <div> By Victoria Ward <time> 28 December 2021 • 7:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duke of York has launched a fresh bid to have his sexual abuse case thrown out of court on the basis that his accuser is not a US resident.</p>
<p>It states that, rather, she lives with her husband and three children in Perth, Australia.</p>
<p>Under federal court law, a US citizen who has permanent residency abroad cannot invoke diversity jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre, now 38, claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew on three separate occasions in 2001, when she was 17, and is seeking unspecified damages.</p>
<p>The Duke’s legal team, <a>led by Los Angeles-based lawyer Andrew Brettler</a>, has asked Lewis Kaplan, the judge, to halt proceedings while they investigate Ms Giuffre’s residency status.</p>
<p>They want the discovery process, which could involve members of the <a>Royal family being subpoenaed</a>, to be put on hold while written and oral evidence is taken from Ms Giuffre.</p>
<p>The motion argued that Ms Giuffre has lived in Australia for all but two of the past 19 years.</p>
<p>The motion claimed that Ms Giuffre only recently registered to vote in Colorado, using her mother and stepfather’s mailing address.</p>
<p>The court documents stated that she and Robert Giuffre, her Australian husband, moved to New South Wales in 2002 where they lived for at least 11 years before temporarily relocating to Florida, where they stayed for 14 months.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre is then said to have moved briefly to Penrose, Colorado, in 2015 before returning to Australia that October.</p>
<p><a>The Duke’s</a> motion also accuses her of being “inconsistent” about her domicile arrangements in her various lawsuits pertaining to her time with <a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>.</p>
<p>Judge Kaplan is due to hear arguments on the Duke’s first motion to dismiss the case on January 4.</p>
<p>He has argued that as Ms Giuffre was 17 – the age of consent in New York – at the time of the alleged offences, she must prove she was forced to have sex with him against her will.</p>
<p>He also claimed that the “plain language” of a 2009 financial deal Ms Giuffre made with Epstein, the convicted sex offender, prevents her from suing the Duke.</p>
<p>If that attempt to get the case thrown out is unsuccessful, depositions were expected to begin promptly, with a trial slated for next autumn.</p>
<p>David Boies, Ms Giuffre’s lead counsel, has revealed that he plans to seek depositions from two British witnesses, who are “close to Andrew who would have knowledge of his actions”.</p>
<p>He added: “That might include his ex-wife. It could possibly be his brother.”</p>
<p>The Duke’s legal team has branded the civil action “baseless” and said “sensationalism and innuendo have prevailed over the truth”.</p>
<p>Their response states that the Duke “never sexually abused or assaulted” Ms Giuffre and unequivocally denies her “false allegations”.</p>
<header> <h1> Prince Andrew's lawyer says case against him is 'baseless' as judge warns him to stop wasting time </h1> <p> Judge tells lawyers for the Duke: 'Cut out all the technicalities and get to the substance' </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Victoria Ward and Josie Ensor, US Correspondent <time> 13 September 2021 • 11:07pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duke of York’s US lawyer has described the sexual assault claim filed against him as “baseless, non-viable and potentially unlawful”, as a judge warned him against wasting time and money on technicalities.</p>
<p>Andrew Brettler, who is based in Los Angeles, told a New York court on Monday that the Duke had not been properly served the lawsuit.</p>
<p>He added that he believed a 2009 settlement signed by his accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein released the Duke and others from “any and all potential liability”.</p>
<p>The 30-minute pre-trial case management hearing, that took place via telephone before judge Lewis Kaplan, was occasionally fraught as the two sides clashed for the first time.</p>
<p>The judge suggested that Prince Andrew’s lawyers were making the case “more complicated” than it was by challenging the method of service.</p>
<p>“You have a pretty high degree of certainty that he can be served sooner than later," he told Mr Brettler. “Let's cut out all the technicalities and get to the substance.”</p>
<p>Mr Brettler insisted that a British High Court official should authorise the service of documents, arguing that the Duke had not been properly served under international law.</p>
<p>But the judge pointed out that the Hague Convention was “optional” and that a plaintiff could order service upon a foreign national under US law.</p>
<p>David Boies, for Ms Giuffre, maintained that Prince Andrew had been served when the papers were delivered to his home at Royal Lodge, Windsor on August 27.</p>
<p>“We’ve proceeded to serve Prince Andrew in several ways pursuant to Article 10 of the Hague Convention,” he told the judge.</p>
<p>Judge Kaplan concluded that Prince Andrew would have the papers served on him at some point, either through Mr Brettler or via the UK Central Authority.</p>
<p>He scheduled the next conference for October 13, giving Ms Giuffre's legal team time to find an alternative method of service.</p>
<p>Mr Brettler was instructed by Prince Andrew within the last fortnight and applied to take part in the court hearing just hours before it was due to start.</p>
<a>represented several men facing sexual assault charges, including Hollywood actor Armie Hammer</a>, comedian Chris D’Elia, who was accused of soliciting child pornography from 17-year-old girl, and Hollywood director Bryan Singer.
<p>Mr Hammer is currently under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department after being accused by a 24-year-old woman of violent rape and physical abuse throughout their four-year on-and-off relationship.</p>
<p>Several other anonymous women also came forward with accusations of sexual impropriety.</p>
<p>Mr Brettler has denied the allegations on his behalf, claiming all of their interactions were "completely consensual".</p>
<h1> Ghislaine Maxwell victim’s testimony proves Prince Andrew accuser is lying, claims lawyer </h1>
<p> Alan Dershowitz wants to depose 'Carolyn', who he told a court was recruited for sexual abuse by Virginia Roberts Giuffre </p>
<div> <div> By Josie Ensor, US Correspondent, New York <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>A Harvard lawyer suing Prince Andrew’s accuser has claimed that testimony given by her former friend at Ghislaine Maxwell's trial is evidence she is “not a victim”.</p>
<p>In a filing in New York on Tuesday night, Alan Dershowitz said he wanted to depose one of Maxwell’s four accusers, who told a court she was recruited for sexual abuse by Virginia Roberts Giuffre as a teenager.</p>
<p>Carolyn, who was 14 at the time and gave evidence under her first name only, said Ms Giuffre, then aged 18, brought her to Epstein’s house in Palm Beach, Florida, where the pair were greeted by Maxwell.</p>
<p>She said the girls, who were friends from school, were paid $300 in $100 bills at the end of each encounter.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre has acknowledged recruiting girls for Epstein, in what has been likened to a pyramid scheme of abuse, claiming she was coerced into doing so by Maxwell.</p>
<p>Carolyn’s testimony could also be seized upon by Prince Andrew’s lawyers as they <a>attempt to discredit Ms Giuffre</a>, who is now 38 and living in Australia.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre sued Mr Dershowitz for defamation in 2019. He then countersued Ms Giuffre, claiming she had made false claims about him so that she could extort money from a member of Epstein’s inner circle.</p>
<p>As well as Carolyn, Mr Dershowitz is seeking to depose Ms Giuffre’s husband, ex-boyfriend and father, as well as former employees of Epstein’s residences. </p>
<p>“Prof Dershowitz is also entitled to inquire of these witnesses whether plaintiff ever did or said anything to suggest to them that she was 'a victim of sex trafficking and repeated sexual abuse' as alleged,” his legal team wrote.</p>
<h1> Prince Andrew’s accuser signed $500,000 deal with Jeffrey Epstein agreeing no legal action against ‘second parties’ </h1>
<p> Agreement signed by Virginia Giuffre is at the heart of Prince Andrew’s bid to have the sexual abuse case against him dismissed </p>
<div> <div> By Victoria Ward <time> 3 January 2022 • 6:20pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duke of York’s accuser was paid $500,000 by Jeffrey Epstein in an attempt to settle her claims that she was sexually exploited by the billionaire and his friends.</p>
<p>The document from 2009 is at the heart of Prince Andrew’s bid to have the sexual abuse case against him dismissed, which will be heard by a New York judge on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Should he fail, the Duke faces the prospect of a lengthy discovery and deposition process that could involve close members of family and his police protection officers, ahead of a trial in the autumn.</p>
<p>Prince Andrew has vehemently denied the claims.</p>
<p>His lawyers have argued that he is entitled to “complete release” from the lawsuit as a direct result of the 12-page agreement Ms Giuffre made with Epstein.</p>
<p>By signing the deal in November 2009, Ms Giuffre agreed to immediately abandon a civil claim she had lodged against Epstein, the convicted sex offender, six months earlier.</p>
<p>She also agreed not to pursue legal action against any “second parties” or “any other person who could have been included as a potential defendants” in her civil complaint.</p>
<p><a>Andrew Brettler</a>, the Duke’s Los Angeles-based lead counsel, will argue that by including a reference to royalty in her original lawsuit, she had made Prince Andrew a potential co-conspirator.</p>
<p>The “second parties” also “forever” released from legal action include Epstein’s “agents, attorneys, predecessors, successors, heirs, administrators, assigns and/or employees”</p>
<p>Mr Brettler is expected to argue before judge Lewis Kaplan on Tuesday that as the agreement was made in direct response to the lawsuit, the claim against Prince Andrew - the only member of the royal family to whom it could refer - is invalid.</p>
<h2>Document thought to have been used by Epstein's former lawyer in abuse claim</h2>
<p>The same document is thought to have been used by Alan Dershowitz, Epstein’s former lawyer, to ge<a>t the abuse claims Ms Giuffre made against him struck out </a>in August.</p>
<p>Mr Dershowitz previously told The Telegraph: “I cannot imagine how the case against the Prince will not be dismissed based on the dismissal of the case against me.”</p>
<p>In a legal memorandum filed in October, Mr Brettler said that by settling her claim with Epstein, Ms Giuffre had provided a general release of all claims against the financier and numerous others.</p>
<p>“Epstein’s former attorney, Alan Dershowitz, and Prince Andrew are axiomatically among the releasees in that 2009 settlement agreement.”</p>
<p>David Boies, Ms Giuffre’s lawyer, has described the settlement as “irrelevant” to the case.</p>
<p>He originally urged Judge Kaplan not to disclose the document to Prince Andrew but later changed tack and said he should be allowed the opportunity to review it and “make whatever arguments they believe appropriate based on it."</p>
<p>The Duke is thought unlikely to dial in to the mid-afternoon hearing, which is expected to last around an hour, and will instead wait to be briefed by his legal team immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>Judge Kaplan will either make his decision known at the end of the hearing or hand down a written ruling within days, it is thought.</p>
<p>If he loses, Mr Brettler has asked Ms Giuffre to provide more detail about her allegations, claiming her lawsuit is “ambiguous and wholly devoid of factual allegations” concerning the New York incident.</p>
<p>The Duke received a setback last week when a request to halt proceedings in order to <a>investigate Ms Giuffre’s residency</a> status was denied.</p>
<p>Mr Brettler argued that because she lived in Australia, the New York federal court could not hear the case. However, the potential for a legal challenge to the court’s jurisdiction remains on the table.</p>

<p> After the latest Ashes embarrassment, the time is now for drastic changes, starting with a comprehensive reform of the county game </p>
<div> <div> By Tim Wigmore <time> 3 January 2022 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Just don’t blame it on the Hundred. England’s <a>Ashes debacle</a> has been years in the making; the Hundred only launched five months ago.</p>
<a> reaching the last World Cup finals in both one-day internationals and Twenty20.</a>
<h2>Improving access to the game</h2>
<h2>Improving the quality of County Championship cricket</h2>
<p>Amid the debris of England’s mauling in Melbourne, Joe Root highlighted the need for the Test side to follow the <a>“reset” in the one-day side after the humiliation of the 2015 World Cup.</a></p>
<p>All of this suggests that playing more Championship games in the height of summer will be no panacea. More important is the quality of the games.</p>
<p>A streamlined structure, with all counties playing in white-ball cricket, could save funds - allowing greater investment into the recreational game - while raising the standard in the Championship.</p>
<h2>Changing the incentives for players</h2>
<p>England’s centrally contracted players are paid handsomely: fringe Test players like Rory Burns and Zak Crawley are on deals worth in the region of £400,000 a year, including contracts, tour fees and bonuses. </p>
<p>The problem with incentives “is below,” says one leading agent. “From a financial perspective there is no incentive to play first-class cricket.”</p>
<p>England picked 25 Test players this year. It was not until their ninth Test of the year, in August, that England finally selected their strongest possible team from the players who were fit.</p>
<h2>The structure of the England team</h2>
<p>For all England’s Test problems, their outstanding white-ball side highlights what English cricket is still capable of. By making better use of its talents, England might yet have a side among the world’s best in all formats. </p>
<div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Time for England to show some character – and three key improvements </h1> <p> I've been 3-0 down in an Ashes series and still managed to salvage pride, knowledge and progress from the dead-rubber Tests </p> </div>

<p>What can England get out of the fourth Test? Pride would be a good start. </p>
<p>People will be judging a few individuals over the next couple of weeks. We always know an Ashes series can be a career-maker or career-ender. </p>
<p>I want to see three things this week, starting with a determination to play competitive cricket. I don’t want to see the towel thrown in like it was in Melbourne. </p>
<p>Secondly, I want energy and buzz in the field and commitment from the group to hold the chances they create. These guys can field. Prove it. </p>
<p>Thirdly, I don’t want to see a bowler bowling a no ball. It is a basic of the game. </p>
<p>In 2002-03 we went into the Sydney Test 4-0 down and by winning that fifth Test I learned a huge amount about myself and playing cricket over here. </p>
<a>could argue that James Vince should be here</a> and obviously Jofra Archer and Olly Stone would be in the squad but that is about it. There are not many bashing the door down. 
<a>new technical changes</a> under the scrutiny of a Test match so soon? He’s not had enough time. They are working on making him stiller and making sure his right foot is not going as far over. I’m not sure you can do that in a few days.
<p>I would pick Stuart Broad and rest Ollie Robinson. He has been good enough but his pace has been down. He needs a break. Mark Wood, Ben Stokes, James Anderson, Jack Leach and Broad would be my bowling attack this week. </p>
<p>Broad <a>should have played at the MCG</a>. He is fit but England have not believed he is in their best XI for two of the three games played so far. He has something to prove this week.</p>
<p>But it is not the bowling that is the problem. It is with the bat England have been so poor. They need to prove to us they can play and show some snarl, some real character.</p>
<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> James Anderson: It's natural to question the future after losing the Ashes - but I want to carry on </h1> <p> From speaking to Stuart Broad, it is clear he definitely has not had enough yet either </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> James Anderson <time> 3 January 2022 • 11:00am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Unfortunately I have been on a few tours that have not ended well in Australia. There is always an air of uncertainty when you lose convincingly so who knows what the future will hold.</p>
<p>It is natural you start thinking about what happens next but the message from the chats I’ve had with the captain and senior players around me is to keep going.</p>
<p>Personally, even in these challenging times, I feel in a really good place with my bowling, and have done for a while. I will have to wait and see but I have no intention of finishing.</p>
<p>I just want to keep working hard and I would love to be part of the West Indies tour in March. I see that as my next challenge. Stuff is taken out of my hands in that respect but all I can do is bowl well and keep contributing.</p>
<p>I still get enjoyment out of bowling. I still love playing for England. I feel like I can actually help this team move forward. For me, that is why I keep going. </p>
<p>He is a competitor which is why he is narked about being left out in Brisbane where it was green and in Melbourne where there was a lot of grass on the pitch.</p>
<a>we become more consistent instead of just showing glimpses</a>. If we can jump that hurdle then we can actually progress and compete with the best in the world.
<p>Players have a chance in the next two games <a>to cement a place in the team and show everyone what they can do</a>. </p>
<h1> The Ashes may be lost but England careers and credibility of the series is on the line in Sydney </h1>
<p> How England play over the next five days will have personal ramifications, for Sydney has been the last staging post for many past players </p>
<div> <div> By Nick Hoult, Chief Cricket Correspondent, in Sydney <time> 3 January 2022 • 6:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>When even Mr 5-0 himself, Glenn McGrath, describes the gulf in class between England and Australia as “disheartening” then you know this Ashes series badly needs a contest in Sydney.</p>
<a>outpouring of support for Joe Root from his team-mates</a> is just a lot of well-meaning noise for a nice guy or has some actual truth to it. 
<p>Just <a>sacking head coach Chris Silverwood is unlikely to be enough</a>. James Anderson and Stuart Broad know <a>one of them could be the fall guy this time</a> to protect a captain who has made far more mistakes than them on this trip.</p>
<p>Broad can see the writing on the wall after being left out for Test matches on pitches in Brisbane and Melbourne that suited his style. When he did play in Adelaide, Root criticised the lengths bowled.</p>
<p>He has been in constant touch with Silverwood, who deserves some sympathy given he is isolating and feeling helpless at a time when his boss, Ashley Giles, is in Sydney talking to people about what has gone wrong.</p>
<p>They are likely to pick the same top six as Melbourne, despite the 68 all out in the second innings, and Broad or Chris Woakes for Ollie Robinson may be the only change. </p>
<p>England (likely): Hameed, Crawley, Malan, Root, Stokes, Bairstow, Buttler, Wood, Broad, Leach, Anderson.</p>
<p>Australia (likely): Warner, Harris, Labuschagne, Smith, Khawaja, Green, Carey, Cummins, Starc, RIchardson, Lyon.</p>
<h1> If England want to win Tests, our county players need more first-class cricket - not less </h1>
<p> There is an undisputed market for one-day cricket, but one of the three present competitions must go - preferably the ludicrous Hundred </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Simon Heffer <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:00am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>It is undeniably important to give the Australians, and anyone else we play, a serious contest, otherwise cricket becomes pointless. And, given the present debacle, that consideration must be a top priority.</p>
<h2>Counties should compile two squads: one for one-day games, another for first-class matches</h2>
<p>The ECB’s stakeholders must get their axes out, and get on with it.</p>
<header> <h1> Haseeb Hameed, beware - the Ashes is where an England opener's ambitions go to die </h1> <p> Given the dearth of openers, it seems absurd that Hameed could be playing for his Test career - but history suggests otherwise </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tim Wigmore <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>For modern English Test openers, this has been the curse of the Ashes: it is where Test careers go to die. Now, the sequence of Ashes series ending the Test careers of an England opener threatens to extend further.</p>
<a>seldom encounters in the County Championship</a>.
<h2>Listen: Sir Geoffrey Boycott's latest Ashes briefing</h2>
<h1> Remembering Sydney, 1883: England regain the Ashes for the first time – with a fistfight at the finish </h1>
<p> Fred Spofforth, Australia’s opening bowler, 'cut up the wicket more disgracefully than I have ever seen,' wrote England captain Ivo Bligh </p>

<p>In Sydney, England regained the Ashes for the first time - and in the only one of all the 2,446 Tests ever played to end in fighting between the two teams.</p>
<h2>Walter Read (a champion amateur boxer) had to stand in front of Barlow to protect him</h2>
<p>Melbourne’s “Punch”, after the Sydney Test, published the verse immortalised by being stuck to the urn, probably by the ladies of Rupertswood:</p>
<p>When Ivo goes back with the urn, the urn;</p>
<p>Studds, Steel, Read and Tylecote return, return;</p>
<p>The welkin will ring loud,</p>
<p>The great crowd will feel proud,</p>
<p>Seeing Barlow and Bates with the urn, the urn;</p>
<p>And the rest coming home with the urn.</p>
