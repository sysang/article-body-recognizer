<h1> Questor: what lessons can we learn from our successes and failures over the past year? </h1>
<p> Questor share tips: insights gleaned from the fortunes of the shares we tipped in 2021 will help us navigate this year’s uncertain landscape </p>
<div> <div> By Robert Stephens <time> 2 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>This highlights the importance of portfolio diversification. Even the most compelling investment opportunities can be blown off course by unforeseen circumstances that cause material underperformance relative to the wider stock market.</p>
<a>our May tip</a> mean it now trades on a price-to-earnings ratio of just 10. This is in spite of a booming property market that contributed to a 124pc increase in its pre-tax profits in the 2021 financial year.
<p>However, its 10.9pc gain and 7.8 percentage point outperformance of the FTSE 100 since our tip show that a contrarian investment approach is a prerequisite for any investor who seeks to outperform the wider market.</p>
<p>Likewise, the opportunities from buying stocks that have had a relatively disappointing history, but which can capitalise on changing industry trends, are illustrated by <a>our advice to buy Sainsbury’s</a>.</p>
<a>advised readers to avoid fund management firm Abrdn</a> in August, the firm’s shares have fallen by 19.3pc.
<p>These events also provide opportunities to use experience gained from events in previous years that, while unlikely to perfectly repeat, should help guide us in what looks likely to be another interesting year for stock market investors.</p>
