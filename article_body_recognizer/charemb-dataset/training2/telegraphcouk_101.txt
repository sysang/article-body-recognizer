<p>Under-18s who are not double jabbed can enter, but all children aged two or over must take a test. Children who aren’t fully vaccinated must also take a second Covid-19 test three to five days after their arrival. </p>
<p>Those aged 12-18 can only enter if they remain in the same province for seven days; under-12s can travel in the country if not double jabbed, but must be with an immunised adult.</p>
<p>Children cannot enter unless fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated travellers aged 12 or older face seven days of quarantine, even if travelling with fully vaccinated adults.</p>

<p>After widespread closures last winter, ski resorts across Europe have opened for business. </p>
<p>But with the outbreak of the omicron variant sparking new lockdown measures and border closures, and Covid measures now the norm at resorts, it's worth putting time into the preparation for your trip.</p>
<p>But rest assured, once you take those first turns on corduroy pistes, all the hassle will melt into the background and your pre-planning will be worth it – I speak from experience. </p>
<p>By getting organised before you go, and making a checklist of things you need to do, you can minimise the confusion and worry – here we walk you through the process, day by day.</p>
<h2>14 days before you travel</h2>
<h2>Check in with your tour operator</h2>
<p>If you have booked with a tour operator, check direct with them for their latest updates. For example, leading operator Inghams has a <a>Covid-19 Hub</a> for advice and information, and Crystal Ski has <a>a very good information page here</a>.</p>
<h2>Check the status of your destination</h2>
<p>It is important to know if your destination is on the red list. The gov.uk website lists <a>those on the red list here</a> (it is currently empty, after all 11 African countries were removed on December 15).</p>
<a>the US</a> have also recently announced tightened rules for testing.
<h2>Ask yourself these key questions</h2>
<p>Once you’ve established the status of your destination, check the finer rules for travel. Questions to ask yourself include:</p>
<li>Do you need to take a pre-departure PCR or lateral flow test? (Yes, if travelling to Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Canada and the USA)</li>
<li>Do you need to take a test on arrival? (Yes, if travelling to Canada or Norway)</li>
<li>Do you need a Covid booster? (Yes, if travelling to Austria)</li>
<li>Is the NHS App accepted as proof of vaccination where you are going? (Yes, in all major ski destinations)</li>
<li>If you’re travelling with unvaccinated children and teenagers, have you worked out what tests you need to do while on holiday? <a>Find all the rules surrounding vaccinations and skiing this winter here</a></li>
<h2>Book your ski passes and equipment rental online</h2>
<h2>10 days before you travel</h2>
<h2>Organise your pre-departure tests</h2>
<p>You can either order a home test kit or book an appointment at a clinic or drive-through test centre. It is also possible, though costly, to book a private GP to visit your home and administer a test.</p>
<p>If you book a home test kit, make sure you check the time scales correctly – most home kits promise to arrive within 24 hours, and you need to send them back the same day that you take the sample for results within 48 hours. </p>
<p>Here is a <a>list of the government-approved test clinics and companies</a>.</p>
<h2>Download the official Covid app for your destination</h2>
<h2>Seven days before travel </h2>
<h2>Double check all the rules for your destination</h2>
<h2>Stock up on face masks</h2>
<h2>Find out where to get a test</h2>
<p>Check the website for the ski resort you are visiting for their information and specific rules on Covid and how and where to get tested in resort (local pharmacy details should be listed, as well as designated testing sites).</p>
<h2>Three days before travel </h2>
<a>sworn statement</a> of absence of Covid symptoms, and for Switzerland (and transit through Geneva) you must complete an
<a>entry form</a> for the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. 
<h2>Pre-departure testing time</h2>
<h2>Create an account for your Passenger Locator Form</h2>
<a>Passenger Locator Form</a> on your return – it’ll save you precious time you could spend on the slopes instead. 
<h2>Last day before travel </h2>
<h2>Organise the final bits of admin</h2>
<h2>Follow any rules for arrivals</h2>
<p>Some countries require visitors to take a test on arrival, some such as Canada require you to isolate until the results are known or for longer.</p>
<h2>Three days before your flight home</h2>
<a>the official UK government guidelines</a> — and let’s hope by now the whole family has got used to swabs down the throat and up the nose, though we know it’s particularly hard for children. 
<h2>The day before your flight home </h2>
<p>To fill in the <a>Passenger Locator Form</a> you need:</p>
<ul><li>Travel details including times and dates</li><li>Your address in the UK</li><li>Booking reference numbers for Covid-19 Day 2 tests</li><li>If needed, an invoice number for your quarantine hotel booking</li></ul>
<p>While it is not necessary to print out, there’s no harm in having a paper copy if you have easy access to a printer, otherwise, take a screenshot on your mobile phone. </p>
<p>After completing those final few turns on the slopes, return all your equipment to the hire shop and head out to the shops to buy any last-minute souvenirs, such as that wedge of raclette, to keep the ski spirit alive when you get back to the UK.</p>
<h2>Two days after arrival in the UK</h2>
<p>Regardless of where you went skiing or your vaccination status, anyone who has been abroad must take a PCR test within two days of arrival. This includes all children over the age of five. And you must self-isolate until the result comes back.</p>
<a>government-approved PCR testing companies here</a>. You can take an express test and some companies offer a same-day result service – these are more expensive, of course. Here are the
<a>quickest, easiest and cheapest Day Two tests for travel</a>.
<h2>Eight days after arrival in the UK</h2>
<p>If you are unvaccinated, you should still be isolating and on day eight take a second PCR test (as detailed above). Provided the result is negative, you will be permitted to continue life as normal on day 10 after your return. </p>

<header> <h1> Why you should consider Scotland instead of the Alps for a ski holiday this winter </h1> <p> With a fresh ban on travel to France, a trip to the Highlands could be skiers' best chance to hit the slopes this winter </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lucy Aspden, Online Ski Editor <time> 16 December 2021 • 4:37pm </time> </div> </div>
<a>turmoil in Europe</a> following a fourth wave of Covid cases and the spread of the omicron variant, leading to a ban on ski holidays in France this Christmas and tightened restrictions on arrivals in the UK, ski resorts in the Highlands could be the
<a>best risk-free choice</a> British skiers and snowboarders have this winter.
<a>Billy Morgan</a> has also strengthened the appeal – the bronze medalist summed up its mystic appeal for viewers: “Scotland has its own magic.”
<p>“It’s fundamentally important we have a good season,” he added, explaining the Scottish ski industry has lost more than £12million over the past two winters.</p>

<p>I’ve always found the rallying cry of Game of Thrones’ House of Stark somewhat overly dramatic, but this year is different. Winter is coming, and it’s the winter we’ve all been waiting for.</p>
<a>Christmas</a>. I can’t remember a time where I couldn’t look outside and not see snow as presents are placed under the tree – it’s magical.
<a>hidden gem</a>. You don’t have to stray too far off the beaten path – just be inventive. For example, instead of Val d’Isère, stop at lesser-known Sainte Foy, where there’s plenty of fun terrain.
<a>parents</a> with young children start late in the season – no one wants to be cold when they learn. This year Easter is particularly late, great news for those committed to travelling during school holidays.
<p>A ski holiday in December is full of festive cheer and first-to-the-slopes bragging – aim high for a snow sure start to the season.</p>
<p>Quiet pistes, plentiful powder days and low-season prices – there’s no better way to start the new year than on the slopes.</p>
<p>Avoid the half-term carnage by heading off the beaten track during the busiest month of the season, when the slopes are primed and resorts are buzzing.</p>
<p>As the days get longer, holidaymakers can revel in warmer temperatures and bluebird skies – ideal for learning the ropes or spending long lunches on a sun-filled terrace.</p>
<p>The end of the season is cause for celebration, with the Easter holidays, lively festivals and revved-upped après-ski making April one of the most exciting times to head to hit the slopes.</p>
