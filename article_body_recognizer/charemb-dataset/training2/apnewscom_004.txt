<div><div><h1>Rabbi wounded in synagogue shooting sentenced for fraud</h1></div><div>January 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Yisrael Goldstein, 60, also was ordered to pay about $2.8 million in restitution. He pleaded guilty in 2020 to wire and tax fraud.</p>
<p>However, federal Judge Cynthia Bashant said Goldstein should go to prison because he defrauded people who thought they were helping the synagogue “when in fact it was really just to benefit you,” the Union-Tribune reported.</p>
<p>“It was for your personal benefit and your own greed, and I can’t ignore that fact,” the judge said.</p>
<p>The rabbi received an outpouring of support, addressed the United Nations and met with President Donald Trump at the White House.</p>
<p>John T. Earnest, a 22-year-old white supremacist, was sentenced last week to life in federal prison, adding to the life term he received three months earlier in state court. </p>
<p>Before the attack, Goldstein had been under investigation by federal authorities and he stepped down as rabbi in November 2019, citing exhaustion. </p>
<p>The scheme and others spanned years and even decades, prosecutors said, and resulted in losses in federal taxes, to the synagogue that never received the donations and to companies that matched donations and never got back their contributions.</p>
<p>The rabbi also admitted taking about $185,000 from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services by submitting fake invoices for damage related to 2007 wildfires.</p>
<p>At least 20 people were involved in the schemes and a half-dozen, including Goldstein, pleaded guilty to federal charges, prosecutors said. </p>
<div><div><h1>Homer Plessy, key to ‘separate but equal,’ on road to pardon</h1></div><div>By JANET McCONNAUGHEYNovember 12, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The state Board of Pardons’ unanimous decision to clear the Creole man’s record of a conviction now goes to Gov. John Bel Edwards, who has final say over the pardon. </p>
<p>“Gov. Edwards is traveling today but looks forward to receiving and reviewing the recommendation of the Board upon his return” Tuesday evening, spokeswoman Christina Stephens said.</p>
<p>The pardon recommendation came as New Orleans began a weekend marking the tumultuous integration of its public schools on Nov. 14, 1960, six years after the Brown decision. </p>
<p>“She said to me, ‘Get up boy, your name is Plessy — you’ve got work to do,’” Keith Plessy said.</p>
<p>Plessy, a 30-year-old shoemaker, lacked the business, political and educational accomplishments of most of the other members, Keith Weldon Medley wrote in the book ”We As Freemen: Plessy v. Ferguson.”</p>
<p>“His one attribute was being white enough to gain access to the train and black enough to be arrested for doing so,” Medley wrote.</p>
<p>More than six decades before Parks was arrested in Alabama, police forcibly removed Plessy from the car, and he was imprisoned in the parish jail.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruled in Plessy v. Ferguson that state racial segregation laws didn’t violate the Constitution as long as the facilities for the races were of equal quality.</p>
<p>Plessy pleaded guilty to violating the Separate Car Act a year later and was fined $25. He died in 1925 with the conviction still on his record.</p>
<p>Keith Plessy and Phoebe Ferguson, the great-great-granddaughter of John Howard Ferguson, the judge who oversaw his case in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court, now lead a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights education.</p>
<p>“We cannot undo the wrongs of the past but we can and should acknowledge them,” Phoebe Ferguson told the pardon board.</p>
<p>The New Orleans City Council honored Plessy’s role in history in 2018 by giving his name to a section of the street where he tried to board the train.</p>
<p>The move to pardon Plessy comes amid a wider discussion about whether convictions or arrest records of civil rights activists should be overturned or removed.</p>
<a>Claudette Colvin,</a> a Black woman who was 15 when she refused to move to the back of a bus months before Parks did so, has sued to wipe out her conviction. Civil rights attorney
<a>Fred Gray,</a> who represented Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., has said he might file a suit to do the same for them.
<p>But some civil rights advocates have said they <a>don’t want</a> their arrest records expunged.</p>
<p>After the Supreme Court ruling in 1896, “Homer Plessy returned to obscurity,” Medley wrote. </p>
<p>He worked as a laborer, warehouseman, clerk and, starting in 1910, a collector for a Black-owned insurance company.</p>
<p>His obituary noted only the date and time of death and that he was the “beloved husband of Louise Bordenave.”</p>
