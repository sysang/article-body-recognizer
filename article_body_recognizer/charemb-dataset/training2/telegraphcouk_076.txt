<p>Fairy lights strung from trees or pergolas add to twilight magic. I love solar lights as they require no wiring acrobatics. Those from <a>The Solarcentre</a> have a USB charger to allow a top-up in darker months. </p>
<p>Light levels are high, windows are open and the air is warm; this is the time my house plants are at their happiest and put on the majority of their annual growth. I feed them weekly while the going is good to help them make the most of it.</p>
<p>My tomatoes now need feeding at least every fortnight with a high-potash fertiliser, and near daily watering. Tomatoes have “feeding roots” near the surface of the compost, so I feed into the top of my pot, then water into the saucer.</p>
<p>Bitter, vibrantly coloured radicchio and chicory can be eaten cooked or raw all winter, and I sow mine now. These most Italian of vegetables can be found in great variety in the <a>Seeds of Italy catalogue</a>. </p>
<p>Day lilies are beautiful, easy, edible and bloom in sun and in shade. Check <a>Woottens of Wenhaston </a>for a huge selection. </p>
<p>Autumn-planted garlic should be ready to harvest about now, but let the plant tell you when it is ready: the leaves will bend and turn yellow, and then it is time to lift.</p>
<p>If you have a shady spot, consider Impatiens omeiana, a hardy busy lizzie with silvery patterned foliage and exotic, orchid-like flowers. Find unusual cultivars at <a>Farmyard Nurseries</a>.</p>
<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Why has Succession’s Shiv Roy become so badly dressed? </h1> <p> She was a stealth-wealth style icon but now everyone’s talking about her terrible outfits in the season three finale </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Bethan Holt <div>Fashion news and features director</div> <time> 16 December 2021 • 5:52pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>So how and why has Shiv’s transformed from chic to bleak so fast?</p>
<p>A simple but unsatisfactory explanation would be that this happened somehow by accident. That costumes which worked in the dressing room simply failed to translate on camera or that the costume designers took their eye off the ball.</p>
<p>Shiv’s fallibility is everywhere in season three, from (spoiler alert!) her failure to secure the right lawyers for her father in the first episode to her failure to foresee her fate in the finale.</p>

<p>Today, most women - whether they are 30 or 60 - are looking for the sort of flexible, comfortable, flattering clothing that they can wear to a meeting in the morning, a park walk in the afternoon and a casual dinner in the evening. </p>

<p>You should never be waistband-conscious in a CDD, nor should it inhibit sofa-lazing capabilities, but you’re also party-ready. Genius.</p>
<p>Bethan wears a velvet dress, £110, Thought; shoes, jewellery and bag, Bethan’s own</p>
<p>Nothing screams Christmas quite like raspberry-pink velvet and puff sleeves, so the dress I’m wearing here, by Thought, is an instant winner – the kind of piece that will impress for many Christmases to come. </p>
<p>This year, I’m asking extra of my CDD as it needs to accommodate a baby bump as well as my big lunch, but Thought’s design has stepped up to the task admirably.</p>
<p>1. Cotton-poplin dress, £195, <a>Daydress</a>; 2. Queen Máxima of the Netherlands; 3. Maggie Gyllenhaal; 4. Cotton dress, £249, <a>Kemi Telford</a></p>
<a>Ganni’s seersucker style</a> is smocked, so it will give you shape without digging in, while
<p>Legs don’t get bloated after a second helping of pigs in blankets, so if you’re confident with your pins, a minidress (very much ‘back’ this year) would work well too. </p>
<h2>Five of the best </h2>

<p>Over lockdown, loungewear brand <a>Pangaia</a> went from strength to strength. With their innovative, sustainable materials, their offering of wardrobe basics in a rainbow of colours proved to be popular for those working from home. </p>
<p>Their recycled cashmere collection includes skirts, hoodies, cardigans, hats and trousers, available in 6 colours. The signature 365 hoodie comes in 19 colours and is made from 50 per cent recycled and 50 per cent organic cotton.</p>
<p>1. Recycled cashmere hoodie, £225, <a>Pangaia</a>; 2. Recycled cashmere trousers, £240, <a>Pangaia</a></p>

<p>So here’s the conundrum. It’s Christmas. Even if you normally wear jeans and a T-shirt on the big day, this year, you may want to make concessions.</p>
<p>On the other hand… it’s Christmas. There will be food. And slave duty in the kitchen. And maybe a nap, or something that involves sitting on the floor while trying to mime Killing Eve to your three-sheets-to-the-wind charades teammates.</p>

<p>In this time between Christmas and New Year, stay cosy in a statement knit and don a practical puffer for woodland walks with family and friends. </p>
<p>If you’ve got a favourite coat in a darker colour like navy or black, brighten it up with a rainbow scarf, like this one from Plümo, which will provide a much needed hit of dopamine dressing as we head towards January.</p>
<p>RoZo’s cropped fleecy jacket is perfect for when the weather is cold, but not quite cold enough for your winter coat. The boxy shape means you can still fit a chunky jumper underneath and layer a scarf over the top.</p>
<p>Fleecy jacket, £120, <a>RoZo</a></p>
<h2>Individually unique bangles</h2>
<p>Each of Dower Hall’s Waterfall bangles are handmade, so the shape and texture of each will be unique. Stack it up with their other bangles or wear alone as a statement piece.</p>
<p>Gold vermeil bangle, £135, <a>Dower Hall</a></p>
<p>Amsterdam based brand Extreme Cashmere offers exactly what is says on the tin - beautiful luxury cashmere pieces in a wide range of styles, from dresses, rugby shirts, hats and scarves. This beanie will pack into a bag or pocket easily.</p>
<p>Cashmere beanie, £64, <a>Extreme Cashmere</a></p>
<h2>Layer over a roll neck</h2>
<p>Wear this shirt layered over a roll neck whilst the weather is cold, and as a jacket in the spring. The waist tie will create a flattering shape and will look great with skinny jeans and knee high boots.</p>
<p>Brushed flannel shirt jacket, £228, <a>Rails</a></p>
<div> <div> <p>Leather boots, £480, <a>ATP Atelier</a></p> <h2>Comfortable fit</h2> <p>Dress these check trousers up or down - wear with a sleek roll neck and loafers for the office, or a loose jumper and trainers for the weekend.</p> </div> </div>
<p>Cotton blend check trousers, £260, <a>Wood Wood</a></p>
<p>French brand Sessun’s patchwork cross body bag has a distinctly ‘70s feel, with a pattern that is exclusive to them. Pair with brown suede for the full ‘70s look.</p>
<p>Leather bag, £210, <a>Sessun</a></p>
<p>‘Tis the season for a puffer coat, and why not one that will work double duty? This one from Kin at John Lewis is reversible, and is perfect for long dog walks with spacious pockets and a handy hood.</p>
<p>Puffer coat, £129, Kin at <a>John Lewis</a></p>
<p>This generously sized scarf from Plümo is guaranteed to brighten up any winter outerwear. Since many people opt for navy or black coats, use a scarf as a way to add colour.</p>
<p>Poly yarn scarf, £49, <a>Plümo</a></p>
<h2>Pattern inspired by traditional Ukrainian rugs</h2>
<p>Toast’s autumnal coloured intarsia floral jumper is a pared back yet statement knit that will make people ask where you got it from. The flowers reach all the way round to the back as well.</p>

<p>It has a lovely slightly oversized fit that is hugely forgiving but also very flattering. I can see myself wearing this all day long, layering it with a cosy knit for afternoon walks. </p>
<p>Isabel wears a limited-edition Winter Frankie dress in red linen (made specially for Stella), £198, <a>Faith Rowan Leeves</a>; boots, Isabel’s own</p>
<p>The crimson red is perfectly festive for this time of year and can be dressed up with a bit of gold jewellery and boots for a. smarter effect, but I promise that you will still be wearing this come the warmer months with tan sandals. </p>
<p>An all year round investment made by a brilliant small British brand that you won’t be able to take off as it's such an easy to wear piece. </p>
<h2>Three of the best </h2>
<p>I love this <a>tartan check dress by Minkie London</a> that will become an annual wardrobe staple you return to year after year. Every good dress wardrobe needs a stellar tartan dress for the festive season. </p>
<p>This sumptuous <a>plum velvet dress by Lexy London</a> is comfortable enough to wear in the daytime for lunches but will also style up easily for any smarter social event. It is a really lovely tone that will flatter anyone. </p>
<div> <div> <p>A lovely <a>winter floral option with pretty velvet trimmings by Iris</a>, who know how to create some feminine drama with their dresses. I would wear this with winter white boots and a cosy coat.</p> <h2>Team it with...</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>1. Velvet headband, £195, <a>Jennifer Behr</a>; 2. Wool Fair Isle cardigan, £215, <a>Cabbages Roses</a>; 3. Big Chip bag made from recycled crisp packets, £55, <a>The Jacksons</a></p> </div> </div>
<header> <h1> How to master casual-luxe this Twixmas </h1> <p> Look beyond the PJs and leggings and you’ll find a whole new category of clothing that’s cosy, but special too </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Bethan Holt, Fashion news and features director <time> 26 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Whether your casual-luxe look needs to work for making yet another vat of mulled wine or going for a long country walk, the principles are similar. </p>
<p>Search out soothing colours and textures with the subtlest hint of festive cheer about them – corduroys, brushed cottons and soft knits in Fair Isles, tartans or rich shades of berry, pine or ochre will work beautifully.</p>
<p>Bethan wears a jumper, £325, Navy Grey; brushed-cotton shirt, £115, <a>With Nothing Underneath</a>; maternity jeans, £69, <a>Isabella Oliver</a>; polo-neck and boots, both Bethan’s own</p>
<p>Tweed trousers and a knitted waistcoat (a genius layering item to wear with everything from polo-neck jerseys to dresses and blouses) work beautifully with a flounced-collar shirt.</p>
<a>brushed-cotton shirts</a> and
<a>Navy Grey’s new Hardy jumper</a>, made using wool from British sheep (both of which I’m wearing here), I was mood-boarding how I’d ideally wear them on a blustery beach in Wales or by a log fire in a remote country cottage. 
<p>Your casual-luxe choices should have the power to make you feel like an elevated version of yourself in the same way a great party outfit can.</p>
<a>Fair Isle waistcoat</a>, £175,
<a>frill-collar shirt</a>, £135, and
<a>tweed trousers</a>, £245, all from
<a>Hill House Vintage x Brora</a>; The Duchess of Cambridge; stylist Natasha Goldenberg; influencer
<p>So yes, have your moment curled up in a onesie in front of the TV. But give yourself the gift of a few casual-luxe moments too, you’ll feel all the better for it. Happy Twixmas!</p>
<h2>Six of my favourites </h2>
<a>Massimo Dutti</a>; shearling-lined boots, £186,
<a>12 Storeez</a>; checked skirt, £150,

<header> <h1> 7 festive style lessons from the Duchess of Cambridge and her royal carol concert guests </h1> <p> From velvet accessories to festive trouser suits, the royals and the Middletons made a stylish impact at Westminster Abbey </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Bethan Holt, Fashion news and features director and Melissa Twigg <time> 9 December 2021 • 10:44am </time> </div> </div>
<p>At almost the exact moment Boris Johnson told a weary nation that more Covid restrictions were coming our way, the royals proved that Christmas 2021 was very far from being cancelled.</p>
<h2>Go bold in festive red</h2>
<h2>Pep up any outfit with a pie-crust collar</h2>
<p>A shirt like this has the power to be a wardrobe staple, perfect for wearing alone or layered underneath neutral knits or sharp blazers - a more feminine alternative to the polo neck jersey. </p>
<h2>Velvet accessories make any outfit feel Christmassy</h2>
<p>Princess Beatrice opted for an elegant fawn-coloured coat (the same style worn in bottle green by Pippa Middleton) but it was her choice of accessories which made her ensemble especially perfect for a carol service. </p>
<h2>Buy a dressy, bias-cut coat</h2>
<h2>Try a festive suit </h2>
<h2>Mix burgundy with white</h2>
<header> <h1> Why everyone should have a trophy cardigan like the Duchess of Cambridge's £1,350 style </h1> <p> Plus, the best affordable versions under £150 to buy now </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Bethan Holt, Fashion news and features director <time> 20 December 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Occasionally a Duchess of Cambridge fashion moment comes along when you least expect it. An apparently routine charity or school visit can become rather more exciting (in style terms) thanks to a surprising new wardrobe addition. </p>
<p>This happened on Friday, too, when a seconds-long appearance in ITV’s trailer for a carol concert hosted by the Duchess showed her wearing an especially fashion-forward and festive Miu Miu cardigan. </p>
<p>The £1,350 bright red design was filled with ultra-pretty details, including a rose pattern, bobble embellishments, delicate pearl buttons and a feminine white collar making it a marvellous choice to ring in the festive season. </p>
<p>The Miu Miu cardigan which Kate debuted on Friday is now sold out despite its elevated price tag, but there are many more trophy cardigans available which would conjure a similarly chic sense of festive spirit. </p>
<p>Here are three reasons why channelling the Duchess with your own trophy cardigan could be this year’s perfect Christmas style solution…</p>
<h2>It’s ideal for a dialled-down celebration</h2>
<p>While I still fully advocate getting dressed up, your outfit can be a little more casual and cosy than you were planning, which is where a trophy cardigan comes into its own. </p>
<p>It works brilliantly for dinner table or Zoom dressing (when all anyone’s seeing is your top half) then you can be as comfy or as formal on your bottom half as you like - wear anything from a fancy skirt to leggings.</p>
<h2>It’s more versatile than a Christmas jumper</h2>
<p>We’ve yet to glimpse the Duchess’s full outfit, but you could amp up the kitsch-ness of a trophy cardigan by wearing it with a kilt or tea dress or you could give it a sleeker, sophisticated spin with tailored black trousers. </p>
<h2>You can wear it after 1st January</h2>
<h2>Six of the best trophy cardigans under £150</h2>
<a>Oliveclothing</a>; 2. purple, £139,
<a>Brora at John Lewis</a>; 3. Cherry fairisle, £89, Laura Jackson x Label at
<a>Next</a>; 4. floral jacquard, £29.99,
<a>Zara</a>; 5. gold button, £120,
<a>Stories</a>; 6. black and white, £119,

<p>It wouldn't be Christmas without the Royal family, would it? Their annual appearences on Christmas morning are as highly anticipated by many of us as mince pies and turkey sandwiches.</p>
<p>From The Duchess of Cambridge's tartan Miu Miu coat to Princess Diana's yellow checks and The Queen's chic 1950s dresses, we've rounded up the most stylish royal Christmas looks from the 1930s until now...</p>
<h2>1. The Duchess of York with Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret, 1934</h2>
<h2>2. Queen Elizabeth, 1953</h2>
<h2>3. The Queen, Princess Margaret, Prince Charles and Prince Edward, 1962</h2>
<h2>4. The Royal family, 1968</h2>
<p>This image includes a fabulous array of looks from the royals on Christmas Day 1968. Particularly noteworthy are Princess Anne's striped coat and the ostentatious hats worn by the Queen and the Queen Mother.</p>
<h2>5. Princess Margaret with her children, 1969</h2>
<div> <p> Princess Margaret showed off her perfect beehive as she balanced her daughter Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, in suitably festive tartan, on her lap at Windsor Castle on Christmas Eve 1969.</p> <h2>6. Princess Diana, 1981</h2> </div>
<h2>7. Princess Diana and a gaggle of Royal children, 1987</h2>
<p> The Queen looked jolly in a pink checked dress and coordinating jacket as she delivered her Christmas speech in 1990. Of course she accessorised with her signature jewels, too - a triple strand pearl necklace and sapphire brooch. </p>
<h2>9. Princess Diana, 1993</h2>
<p> A year after her separation from Prince Charles was announced, Princess Diana switched on the Christmas lights on Bond Street. She looked incredibly festive for the occasion in her tartan jacket by Bellville Sassoon. </p>
<h2>10. Princess Diana, 1993</h2>
<h2>11. Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie, 1996</h2>
<p>Don't Beatrice and Eugenie look adorable in their matching riding coats, berets and muffs, worn on Christmas Day in 1996? You can just see their forest green party dresses peeping out from underneath their coats, too. </p>
<h2>12. Princess Diana, 1996</h2>
<p> Princess Diana looked the epitome of chic as she attended a Christmas party at Banqueting House in London in December 1996. By this point, she understood that an LBD is always a good idea, no matter what the event. </p>
<p> Of course sometimes Her Majesty surprises us too, as she did in 2005 when she swapped her usual eye-catching brights for this elegant camel look which was completed with a bow-adorned hat and fur trim. </p>
<h2>15. Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge, 2011</h2>
<h2>16. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, 2013</h2>
<p> For 2013's Christmas Day service at Sandringham, the Duchess of Cambridge opted for a suitably festive tartan coat by one of her favourite brands: Alexander McQueen. She accessorised the look with a hat by Gina Foster.</p>
<div> <div> <p>The Queen looked resplendent in clashing shades of purple and red on Christmas Day in 2014.</p> <h2>18. The Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte, 2016</h2> </div> </div>
<h2>19. The Countess of Wessex, 2017</h2>
<p>Sophie, Countess of Wessex opted for an elegant floral coat dress by Erdem, which she accessorised with simple blue pumps and a berry-toned clutch bag. The style recalls the fit and flare silhouettes loved by the Queen in the 1950s. </p>
<h2>20. The Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan Markle, 2017</h2>
<div> <p> The Queen set the tone for a stylish Sandringham Christmas, wearing this biscuit-hued coat and Burberry headscarf to alight the train at King's Lynn.</p> <h2>22. The Duchess of Cambridge and the Duchess of Sussex, 2018</h2> </div>
<h2>23. Princess Charlotte and the Duchess of Cambridge, 2019</h2>
<h2>24. The Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, 2020</h2>
<h2>25. The Duchess of Cambridge, 2021</h2>
<a> saw a very stylish royal turn out</a>. In trailers for the event, broadcast on Christmas Eve, Kate donned
<a> a £1,350 festive cardigan by Miu Miu</a> - the perfect regal take on a Christmas jumper.

<div> <div> By Bethan Holt, Fashion news and features director <time> 27 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>From casual to red carpet, high street to high end, the Duchess of Cambridge had one of her best-dressed years yet in 2021. Here are the highlights… </p> <h2>Think pink</h2> </div> </div>
<p>Days after Meghan and Harry’s bombshell Oprah interview, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited School 21 in Stratford for their first in-person engagement of 2021. </p>
<h2>Prince Philip’s funeral </h2>
<p>Style was never going to be the biggest talking point from the funeral of Prince Philip, and yet the Duchess showed the power of a carefully thought-through outfit to bring added gravitas to such a solemn occasion. </p>
<p>In her meticulously tailored Catherine Walker and co. coat and veiled hat, Kate looked serious yet immaculate while the addition of pearl and diamond jewellery loaned from the Queen’s collection gave a regal yet personal touch. </p>
<h2>10th anniversary portrait</h2>
<p>William and Kate celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary in April, marking the occasion with <a>a charming film showing their life in the Norfolk countryside</a> and a new portrait of the couple together. </p>
<p>Even if her wardrobe is now filled with bespoke designer pieces, the future queen made us remember that she loves to trawl the Kings Road for sensible investments as much as the next modern Sloane Ranger.</p>
<a>chic and striking in a £849 heather tartan coat</a> by Holland Cooper, the glossy equestrian-glam label founded by Jade Holland Cooper. The trench-coat styling felt fresh and new while still looking entirely appropriate. 
<h2>Alessandra Rich at Wimbledon</h2>
<p>From high street to high end, the Duchess added some striking new designer buys to her arsenal in 2021, among them this polka dot Alessandra Rich skirt which she wore to Wimbledon. </p>
<p>The final piece of the jigsaw in the success of this outfit was those bright white accessories - a new Mulberry handbag and Jimmy Choo stilettos which gave it a fashionably modern touch. </p>
<p>It was a big moment in the spotlight for the Duchess and her eye-catching outfit exuded a kind of passion and confidence which we have only begun to see emerge from her in the past couple of years. </p>
<p>Kate teamed a pleated Christopher Kane skirt with a coordinating polo neck knit, making the ensemble look especially contemporary by accessorising with tan Ralph Lauren heels and a matching DeMellier London handbag. </p>
<a>wearing a £1,350 Miu Miu cardigan in a trailer for Together at Christmas</a>, the Westminster Abbey carol service which she organised as a tribute to those who have suffered especially or worked particularly hard during the pandemic.
<p>With its rose pattern, bobble embellishments and sweet Peter Pan collar, the Duchess’s cardigan was the ultimate vintage-chic fashion statement to round off a very stylish year. </p>

<p>The classic country style beloved by the royals and their set hasn’t changed much over the years. </p>
<p>And what could be more apt for a frozen, travel-free January than borrowing from the people who can’t think of anything better than a brisk stride around the moors of Britain in the bleak midwinter? </p>

<p>It’s been the year style has been put on ice in favour of track suit pants and slippers. But now it’s time to rediscover your fashion confidence and dip your toe back into something braver. </p>
<p>In our Wardrobe Whisperer column, our team will find a solution for every style crisis.</p>
<h2>Dear Wardrobe Whisperer, </h2>
<p>I’m a bit of a shopaholic and my wardrobe is crammed full of beautiful blouses, dresses and accessories that I’ve picked up on my sprees. </p>
<p>I’m determined to take a pause now and get some wear from what I already have, but I feel as if I totally lack those staples that actually make an outfit work. Where do I start? ­</p>
<p>The key to a capsule wardrobe is in identifying the pieces you reach for again and again. For me, it’s charcoal straight-leg jeans and a blazer. You talk about dresses and blouses, so your go-to might be a midi-dress.</p>
<p>Then you need to build a little sartorial architecture around these pieces, and there are four essentials that will really make your wardrobe sing.</p>
<p>Model wears a <a>flannel blazer</a>, £295, <a>silk/cotton blouse</a>, £165, <a>cord trousers</a>, £185, and <a>flannel slip-on trainers</a>, £225, all <a>Me+Em</a></p>
<p>I would put a blazer at the top of your wish list. It can be worn over dresses, under coats, with jeans and skirts, and smartens everything else you’re wearing. </p>
<p>If you’re petite, avoid a boyfriend style and go for something more fitted. Consider brown, beige or navy if black isn’t for you – they look more chic with bright colours in any case.</p>
<p>You should also consider a pair of trousers that you can wear with your favourite blouses. The shape doesn’t really matter, as long as they suit you and are versatile enough to go with other items in your wardrobe. </p>
<p>If you lean towards pussy-bow-style blouses, consider a slim-fitting pair; try a wide leg to balance more form-fitting tops.</p>
<p>1. Metallic ribbed-knit tank, £195, <a>Ganni</a>; 2. Wool blazer, £149, <a>Massimo Dutti</a>; 3. Wool turtleneck, £45, <a>Cos</a>; 4. Wool-mix trousers, £245, <a>Closed</a>; 5. Leather boots, £225, <a>Russell Bromley</a></p>
<a>Onloan</a>, which starts at £69 for two items a month. It will help satisfy that urge to shop, which, as other shopaholics will appreciate, can be very hard to shake off.

<header> <h1> Dame Joan Collins’ best style moments </h1> <p> A new BBC documentary about the actress airs on New Year’s Day </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tamara Abraham, Acting Senior Fashion Editor <time> 31 December 2021 • 10:53am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Collins’ style evolution spans eight decades and countless showstopping looks. These, though, are the highlights:</p>
<div> <div> <p>Collins on the set of Turn the Key Softly in 1953. That tightly cinched belt and pencil skirt is typical of the era, but those full, pleated sleeves lend the look plenty of drama, making it pure Joan.</p> <h2>1967</h2> </div> </div>
<p>You don’t need to know the date of this photo to know that it’s from the Seventies. The frothy collar and the tent-like silhouette are typical of the period. Note the coordinating hair accessory holding up her gravity-defying ‘do.</p>
<div> <div> <p>The knitted headband, the camel coat, the Gucci shoulder strap, the glimpse of pussybow blouse. You don’t even need to see the rest of this airport arrival outfit to know it’s a good one.</p> <h2>1981</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Collins became an instant icon when she assumed the role of Alexis Colby on Dynasty. The shoulder-padded power suits and matching hats would come to define a fashion era.</p> <h2>1982</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Nobody does an airport arrival like Joan. Here she is again in 1982 in a suede shorts suit that wouldn’t look out of place on an influencer today.</p> <h2>1985</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Here, Collins is draped in white fur for the celebration of her marriage to Peter Holm in December 1985. The look was completed by diamond jewellery and a rhinestone studded minaudière.</p> <h2>1987</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Yes, there was a whole Dynasty dress collection, and of course Collins was on board to promote it. Here she is at its launch, blurring the lines between her on-screen persona and real life.</p> <h2>1987</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>This is Preppy Joan, in character as Alexis on Dynasty, serving lessons in how to carry off a visor. It’s proof she can look just as powerful in a cable knit as she does in a structured suit.</p> <h2>1995</h2> </div> </div>
<p>A rare picture of Collins off-duty, but you won’t catch her in faded jeans. The roll-neck knit, tailored trousers and soft loafers are a masterclass in low-key luxury. Quite the contrast with the wall of magazine covers beside her.</p>
<div> <div> <p>Wearing a white suit as only she can, Collins ushers the shoulder pad into the new millennium.</p> <h2>2002</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Joan on the cusp of her seventies, proving there’s no upper age limit when it comes to wearing sheer fabrics.</p> <h2>2004</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Joan looks wonderful in red, and she knows it. This scarlet trench is an outfit in itself.</p> <h2>2007</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>This black and gold cape dress is elegant and easy to wear, yet high-impact. Probably her best red carpet look of the decade.</p> <h2>2012</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Collins received her Damehood in 2015 in an outfit that would make Alexis proud. The cape-style jacket, the hat, the monochrome, the gloves… It was a look worthy of the milestone moment.</p> <h2>2019</h2> </div> </div>
<div> <p>Joan has been a loyal Valentino fan for decades, and in 2019 she became a face of the house, posing for its Christmas campaign. The appointment came a year after she modelled for high street footwear giant Kurt Geiger.</p> <h2>2021</h2> </div>
