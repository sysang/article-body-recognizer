<h1> New opponents lined up for Tyson Fury after 'greedy' Dillian Whyte fails to agree purse split </h1>
<p> Andy Ruiz Jr. and Robert Helenius are frontrunners to be next, plus analysis of what this means for the heavyweight division in 2022 </p>
<div> <div> By Gareth A Davies, Boxing Correspondent <time> 29 December 2021 • 3:26pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Tyson Fury's US promoter Bob Arum has disclosed Andy Ruiz Jr. and Robert Helenius are now the frontrunners to be his next opponent in March after failing to reach agreement with Dillian Whyte on a purse split.</p>
<p>Fury had been ordered earlier this month to defend the World Boxing Council heavyweight title against fellow Briton Whyte, who is interim champion and mandatory challenger.</p>
<p>"We can't [leave Fury] inactive because of the problems caused by this arbitration between the WBC and Whyte."There have even been discussions for Fury to defend the 'Ring Magazine' title instead.</p>
<p>The complication in negotiations revolves around Whyte's outstanding legal arbitration case with the World Boxing Council sanctioning body, with an outcome not expected until March.</p>
<p>The dispute has rendered the sanctioning body unable, legally, according to a WBC spokesperson, to intervene in a closed period for negotiation.</p>
<p>Arum told Telegraph Sport that Fury's next contest would "100 per cent be in the UK", Manchester having become the most likely venue.</p>
<p>"Particularly in the age of the pandemic where you don’t know the kind of spectators you’re going to get like in the last Tyson Fury fight where we did the event and did a great gate.</p>
<p>"It would have been even bigger if we had the UK fans there, which they couldn’t go because of the travel ban in the United States. </p>
<p>"We’ve offered them [Team Whyte] a good deal, a purse deal, far more than they’ve ever gotten in any fighting and that hasn’t moved them."</p>
<p>"Dillian Whyte and his people should come to the table and make a deal to fight Tyson Fury, period end of the story. But that’s not likely to happen, so they’re going to play out the arbitration.</p>

<p>Tyson Fury's highly anticipated fight with Dillian Whyte is in major doubt following a purse dispute between the two parties.</p>
<p>Whyte, the interim WBC champion, was the organisation's No 1 contender for more than 1,000 days without a title shot, and had taken legal action against the WBC.</p>
<p>Promoter Arum has disclosed Andy Ruiz Jr. and Robert Helenius are now the frontrunners to be Fury's next opponent in March.</p>
<p>"I'll leave it up to my promoters to sort out. Usyk holds all the other belts, Anthony Joshua has a big name, but I'll beat any challenger, I don't care who it is. I'll happily beat Whyte up and give him a boxing lesson," said Fury. </p>
<p>Fury, from Manchester, has not competed in the UK since his comeback fight in August 2018.</p>

<p>March 2022 is when Fury is expected to fight next.</p>
<p>Should the fight go ahead, there are currently three potential locations for the fight - Cardiff, Manchester, or Las Vegas, Nevada</p>
<h2>How to watch Fury-Wilder III on TV</h2>
<p>Fury's recent fights have been broadcast on BT Sport pay-per-view while Whyte's bouts has been on Sky Sports box office.</p>

<p>But going back to those grass courts in 2022, she will be the reigning US Open champion and the top-ranked British female after climbing 324 places in the rankings in mere months.</p>
<p>Her poise in the face of intense pressure in New York has been much lauded, but Wimbledon in 2022 will be a test and a homecoming like no other. Molly McElwee</p>
<p>Whenever and where the 46-year-old returns it will undoubtedly be the professional game’s most awaited day.</p>
<p>And then in early December came a <a>hit and giggle parent-and-child 36-hole competition</a> in Orlando and so what had been the traces of a dream suddenly became the roots of a reality.</p>
<a>on an 18-match winning streak and have not lost since 2019</a>. Wales have also secured their place, while Scotland will compete for a last remaining qualification spot in February in Dubai.
<p>Given New Zealand’s stringent Covid measures - and with 82 per cent of the country's adult population vaccinated - players could be required to be double jabbed for the tournament. Fiona Tomas </p>
<a>the third of four Test matches</a>, with England facing 2023 RWC pool opponents Argentina and Japan beforehand and finishing against world champions South Africa - is a fascinating fixture for a couple of reasons.
<p>Will Mercedes ace them like they did in 2014? Or will F1’s new era be everything it was hoped? We will only start to have an idea when the cars hit the track for the first time in testing. Luke Slater</p>
<p>Who is England’s final taker? Up steps Bukayo Saka and, this time, he buries the ball confidently past Alisson to win the final for England. After 56 years of hurt England are finally the world champions once more.</p>
<h2>Women’s football</h2>
<p>It was no surprise to see Jamaica’s <a>Elaine Thompson-Herah </a>crowned World Athletics female athlete of the year after claiming Olympic titles in 100 metres, 200m and 4x100m in Tokyo.</p>
<p>That mark is something Thompson-Herah has stated she will target in 2022, with the women’s sprints some of the most highly anticipated events at the summer’s World Championships in Eugene, United States.</p>
<p>Thompson-Herah will be favourite to triumph over both 100m and 200m, having also moved second on the all-time list behind Griffith-Joyner for the longer sprint in 2021.</p>
<p>Helen Housby’s buzzer beater in the final against Australia changed everything for netball in England, catapulting a fringe sport into the headlines.</p>
<p>Despite finishing only third at the World Cup a year later, defending Commonwealth champions England will likely head into a home Birmingham Games as favourites.</p>
<p>While the core of the side that triumphed so spectacularly in 2018 remains intact, head coach Jess Thirlby has also been able to bring through a number of younger players in the intervening years to create squad depth unrivaled in world netball.</p>
<p>As ever, Australia and New Zealand will provide the stiffest competition, having dominated the global game since its inception. The upcoming Quad Series in January should be informative when England take on those two nations, plus South Africa.</p>
<p>Off the back of series wins in recent months against New Zealand and Jamaica, England are now at the stage where only victory will suffice. Confidence is high, and so are expectations. Ben Bloom</p>
<a>think Great Britain's gold-medal winning exploits in swimming and triathlon and the athletics mixed relays</a> - an expanded programme at February's Winter Games in Beijing promises plenty more standout memories.
<p>Mixed gender team events have been added in short-track speed skating, ski jumping, freestyle skiing aerials and snowboard cross, bringing the total number of events in which both men and women compete together to nine.</p>
<p>Britain's best chance of mixed team success, however, comes in an event which made its Olympic debut four years ago with Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds flying the flag in mixed curling having been crowned world champions in Aberdeen in May. Pippa Field</p>
<p>So, actually, the first moment of truth for Reach For The Moon will come in a Derby trial but, no question, it would give the Queen and the sport a huge filip were he to line up at Epsom on the first Saturday in June. Marcus Armytage</p>

<h1> How F1 cars are changing in 2022 – and why it could be good news for Lewis Hamilton </h1>
<p> We take a look at every little detail that we know about next year, analysing who it might favour and whether it will shake up the order </p>
<div> <div> By Luke Slater <time> 3 January 2022 • 11:05am </time> </div> </div>
<a>won their first race for nine years</a> and there were podiums for every team but Alfa Romeo and Haas. 
<p>We take a look at every little detail that we know about next year. </p>
<h2>What are the regulation changes for 2022?</h2>
<p>So often in the past few years we have seen drivers drop back from one to three or four seconds behind the car ahead in order to preserve their tyres. That is not what racing should be. </p>
<p>According to estimates by F1, the current cars lose 35 per cent of their downforce when around 20 metres behind, and a loss of 47 percent at 10m. In the new cars that should reduce to four per cent and 18 per cent respectively. </p>
<p>This is partly by virtue of increased “ground effect”. In other words, the downforce being generated is more from beneath the car, not from “on” it. </p>
<p>“We'll only really know in that first test session when the cars hit the track for real and follow each other,” he tells Telegraph Sport. </p>
<p>“Hopefully, because it's [2022’s aero vs 2021’s] achieved in a different way aerodynamically, that allows them to follow closer. I think the jury's still out at this stage.”</p>
<h2>Will the 2022 cars end up close to the concept car made by F1?</h2>
<h2>Who might the new regulations favour?</h2>
<p>A set of regulation changes this significant will always lead to hope of a shaking-up of the order. But it is optimistic to believe that the grid will be turned on its head. The top teams are there for a reason. </p>
<a>slight change in aerodynamic regulations</a> - after a strong 2020 - but have ploughed huge resource into the team after
<p>Expect Haas, who never developed their 2021 car to prioritise 2022, to be much improved. </p>
<h2>Who might be caught out?</h2>
<p>That is hard to say at the moment but, in short, teams who developed their 2021 cars deep into the season may find themselves behind. </p>
<p>The worry for Red Bull might not be so much the aero regulations, but the issue of engines. Yes there is an effective development freeze on power units, but Honda’s departure from F1 can only be a negative for the team’s future. </p>
<p>Things might not be so bad in the short term as Honda will retain some influence and involvement technically - though they will be branded as Red Bull engines - but the long-term future remains uncertain. </p>
<h2>Will it lead to a return of 2014’s one-team dominance?</h2>
<a>Brawn GP’s double diffuser</a> in 2009, which was also the year Red Bull went from midfield also-rans to contenders. 
<p>Karun Chandhok, Davidson’s colleague at Sky and former HRT and Caterham driver, believes this to be the case. The regular return to the podium of teams like McLaren, AlphaTauri, Alpine and Aston Martin could be short-lived. </p>
<p>“On the chassis side, I think both Red Bull and Mercedes, they're very good teams that start at a high level. I'm fairly sure that in the short term, the gap to the midfield will open - the rich will get richer.”</p>
<p>Might we see a return to the bad old days when Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes hoovered up 90 per cent of the podiums and wins between them?</p>
<h2>Reasons to be optimistic </h2>
<p>A season like 2021 will be hard to replicate but there are reasons for optimism. Or, at least, reasons to not expect a repeat of the dulling dominance Mercedes had when the regulations changed for 2014. </p>
<p>Firstly, the emphasis on the engine. 2014’s new regulations revolved primarily around the arrival of hybrid power units. Mercedes’ was the best by far and outclassed their rivals at Renault and Ferrari, and later Honda. </p>
<p>“I think that's a huge piece of the puzzle that will pretty much go untouched. And therefore, at least from a power sensitivity point of view you won't you won't see a repeat of 2014,” Davidson says. </p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton is not responding to Formula 1's authorities despite their threats of action after he failed to show up to an end-of-season trophy gala following his controversial title defeat.</p>
<p>Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the newly-elected FIA president, admitted Lewis Hamilton is not "100 per cent", but he is confident he will not walk away from F1 after the furore in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>However, Ben Sulayem said in his first press conference there could be “no forgiveness” for a potential rule breach after Hamilton missed the prize-giving in Paris last month.</p>
<a>Wolff saying he was “disillusioned”</a>.
<p>Ben Sulayem, who was elected last month, has already announced plans to make changes to F1’s rulebook to prevent a repeat of what happened in Abu Dhabi. But he does not believe Hamilton will quit the sport.</p>
<p>He said: “I’ll ask your question: did Lewis declare that he’s not going to race? No. Exactly. Being a driver, you declare yourself, you don’t let the rumours [talk].</p>
<p>“I’m confident that Lewis [will return]. Lewis is a big part of motorsport, and of course of Formula 1, the new era [can add to] Lewis’ wins and achievements, and also Verstappen is there.</p>
<p>“I am very confident that you will see a very challenging Formula 1 season next year.”</p>

<header> <h1> Katarina Johnson-Thompson interview: 'I'm not an athlete you can depend on - but I'm not finished' </h1> <p> After Olympic heartbreak last year, the heptathlete has changed training base again and refocussed on 2022 </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Ben Bloom, Athletics Correspondent <time> 2 January 2022 • 10:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Success, she says, “is having no regrets”. Of those, she has a few. But her failure to finish at the Tokyo Olympics is not one of them.</p>
<p>The truth is that Johnson-Thompson should never have even been there. When she ruptured her Achilles in December 2020, medical consensus was that she could not recover in time to compete against the world’s best in less than eight months.</p>
<p>That she did was testament to her unyielding determination and sheer physical prowess. That she then collapsed mid-competition with a calf injury in the other leg was nothing but bad luck.</p>
<p>“Sometimes s--- things happen,” she says, matter of fact in her first newspaper interview since the Olympics. “Hard work doesn’t always pay off.”</p>
<h2>'I truly believe that I could have won a medal'</h2>
<p>Solid high jump and shot put performances followed, and she sat fifth in the overall standings when the issue worsened in the 200m warm-up. “Athletes have to make a decision on whether to go or not, and I decided to run,” she recalls.</p>
<p>Incredibly, her start was spectacular and it was only after “the best bend of my entire career” that her competition ended so dramatically. Stricken, she collapsed to the track, only to rise again when a wheelchair emerged.</p>
<p>“At the same time, I just wanted to finish. That’s the overwhelming sadness for me that I couldn’t finish the job off after the amount of work that everybody put in to get me there.</p>
<p>“I was gutted that I had to stop and that the story had to end that way. I don’t like this narrative attached to me any more, but that’s what happened.”</p>
<h2>'I’m at peace with what happened'</h2>
<p>In recent months, Johnson-Thompson has been reading A Path Through the Jungle, a book written by renowned sports psychiatrist Steve Peters that aims to “develop robustness and resilience”.</p>
<p>Tokyo, she says, was not another case of two steps back after one step forward; it was simply “a really bad thing that happened”. One that was out of her control.</p>
<p>She noticeably kept a low profile in the months after, twice going on holiday, renovating a house in Liverpool, walking her two dachshund dogs Bronx and Chorizo, and undergoing surgery on the problematic calf that ruined everything in Japan.</p>
<p>Instead of viewing her Tokyo experience negatively, she insists she takes confidence from being able to fight back from an operation on her ruptured Achilles and three months of missed training to even make the Olympic start line.</p>
<p>It was during those gloomy times of uncertainty and rehabilitation that the “robustness and resilience” trumpeted by Peters was so needed, not now.</p>
<p>“But there is nothing positive that comes from what then happened in Tokyo. It’s not going to inspire me to do better. It was a really bad thing that happened, but the good thing is I’m over it.”</p>
<h2>'I’m not an athlete that you can depend on'</h2>
<p>Things are never so straightforward with Johnson-Thompson. When her Montpellier-based coach Bertrand Valcin took up a new role with the French Athletics Federation after the Tokyo Olympics, she was left seeking someone new to work with.</p>
<p>The outcome was a move to Florida in November to work under Petros Kyprianou, alongside his group of international multi-eventers and jumpers.</p>
<p>The life she had worked so hard to build in Montpellier — her town centre apartment, her favourite coffee shop, her friends — was dismantled and moved across the Atlantic, where she knows no one.</p>
<p>“I learned to love my life in Montpellier,” she says. “It was so hard for me to settle down there but I did, and I love that place. It’s very sad that I had to leave.</p>
<p>“I will miss it for sure. It’s sad that it’s just memories now. That seems to be my life, every Olympic cycle I start again.”</p>
<p>“With my career, it’s had ups and downs, I’ve learned a lot, and I hope I can finally just go forward and achieve what I’m meant to achieve.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I wouldn’t have it any other way. I would love to be the most consistent athlete ever who won all those champs and didn’t learn any lessons - that would have been amazing.</p>
<p>“But unfortunately that’s not me and I’ll have to wait until Paris if I want to achieve an Olympic medal.”</p>
<p>“Fulfillment is getting the most out of myself, and I don’t think I’ve done that yet. I’m still not finished.”</p>

<h1> Row brewing around Fallon Sherrock’s possible inclusion in Premier League Darts line-up </h1>
<p> PDC has delayed the line-up announcement, with Sherrock tipped for inclusion despite losing in the first round of the World Championship </p>
<div> <div> By Ben Bloom <time> 4 January 2022 • 12:39pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A potential row is brewing over this year’s delayed Premier League Darts line-up announcement after Fallon Sherrock’s possible inclusion was dismissed as undeserving by prominent figures in the sport.</p>
<p>The make-up of the Premier League is traditionally announced immediately after the PDC World Championship final, which took place on Monday night, but organisers have confirmed they will not reveal details for the moment.</p>
<p>Sherrock, who in 2019 became the first woman to win a match at the PDC World Championship, has been strongly tipped for inclusion in a line-up that is expected to follow the same 10-player format employed since its expansion in 2013.</p>
<p>Prior to the World Championship, PDC chairman Eddie Hearn said Sherrock was firmly in consideration for a Premier League spot.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to get growth at a younger level across females in darts, she’s the kind of person that’s going to inspire that.</p>
<p>“When she broke through at the Worlds in 2019 you wondered whether it would be a one-off, but she’s proved it’s not. For me, with a commercial hat on, she has to be considered for the Premier League.</p>
<h2>'Sherrock's performance against Beaton wasn’t good enough to warrant a Premier League spot'</h2>
<p>But Mardle said he had changed his mind after Sherrock’s early World Championship exit.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is challenging and a great experience in a lot of ways, but it can really bash you as well. It can be unforgiving.</p>
<p>“Commercially, yeah, it would be good in a lot of ways to have Fallon in it, but I don’t think it would be good for Fallon. And I am not sure it is fair to the other players.</p>
<p>“You cannot undercut somebody that maybe is entirely deserving without question with something which might be publicity.”</p>
<p>Kim Huybrechts, who reached the third round at the recent World Championship, said: “I think I’m going to get a lot of responses, but the Fallon hype is getting a bit too much to be honest.</p>
<p>“She’s very good but the hype is getting a bit too big. Let the girl be who she wants to be. Let her play darts and do what she’s good at. Forget the media circus, just let her play darts.</p>
<p>“Premier League? She has a good chance with Sky. Does she deserve it? I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>This year’s Premier League is currently due to start on February 3 in Cardiff, although strict Covid measures in Wales mean a crowd would not be allowed under existing rules.</p>

<header> <h1> Long Covid worsens staff shortages in ambulance services </h1> <p> Retired workers asked to return and patients told to take themselves to AE, as 1 one in 20 staff at some trusts are reporting the condition </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lizzie Roberts, Health Reporter <time> 5 January 2022 • 9:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Long Covid is making staff shortages in ambulance services worse, it has emerged, with more than one in 20 members of staff in one trust absent for more than a month with coronavirus-related sickness.</p>
<p>New data reveal some 40,000 work days across four major ambulance service trusts were lost due to the condition.</p>
<p>It comes as NHS services struggle to cope with rising staff sickness rates and Covid cases.</p>
<p>North East Ambulance Service asked patients to take themselves to accident and emergency for suspected strokes or heart attacks over the New Year weekend, due to a surge in demand.</p>
<p>West Midlands Ambulance Service asked retired staff to return to the frontline to <a>“increase the quality and amount of care” it can provide.</a></p>
<p>The new data, obtained through Freedom of Information requests, suggests trusts’ staffing levels have been impacted by workers experiencing long-term effects from Covid infection.</p>
<p>NHS England defines long Covid as patients experiencing ongoing symptoms, including fatigue, breathlessness, a cough and muscle pain. Clinical guidelines say the signs and symptoms can continue from four to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus submitted Freedom of Information requests to ambulance trusts across England and found some workers have been absent for more than a year due to Covid-related sickness.</p>
<p>North West Ambulance Service said one member of staff was absent for 544 days due to Covid-related sickness between March 2020 and September 2021.</p>
<p>South East Coast Ambulance Service had a member of staff who was off sick for 515 days, while a London Ambulance Service worker was absent for 350 days. At the East Midlands Ambulance Service, a worker was sick for 308 days.</p>
<p>South East Coast Ambulance Service recorded 7,390 days in total as lost due to a Covid-related sickness lasting more than 12 weeks.</p>
<p>North West Ambulance Service said it had lost 33,654 full-time equivalent days for workers absent for more than 28 days at a time.</p>
<p>That meant that 398 workers were off sick for more than 28 days - six per cent of its 6,300 workforce.</p>
<h2>'Operational gaps being filled'</h2>
<p>Richard Webber, of the College of Paramedics, said he was not aware of national long Covid absence rates.</p>
<p>However, he said some trusts were currently reporting <a>“20 to 30 per cent” sickness rates</a>, which was partly to blame on PCR turnaround times.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the North West Ambulance Service said it did not record long Covid absences specifically, and stressed some of the employees included in the figures could have been hospitalised for long periods of time with Covid.</p>
<p>The spokesman added that volunteer and private providers, as well as military support, has enabled them to “fill as many operational gaps as possible”.</p>
<p>“Staff who suffer from long-term sickness are closely monitored and supported by their managers and are carefully reintegrated into their roles when well enough to return,” they said.</p>
<p>“The Government cannot continue to ignore those who are suffering as a direct consequence of protecting our country during the darkest days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“They must recognise long Covid as an occupational disease, provide formal guidance to employers on the issue and create a compensation scheme for key workers who have been unable to return to work.”</p>

<h1> Are humans really to blame for MRSA superbug? It turns out the answer is a prickly subject </h1>
<p> Hedgehogs have been living with the bacteria for two centuries, suggesting the use of drugs did not cause antibiotic resistance </p>
<div> <div> By Will Bolton <time> 5 January 2022 • 9:36pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Hedgehogs have been living with MRSA on their skin for the last two centuries, a new Cambridge study has found, suggesting humans did not cause antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>Scientists have uncovered startling new evidence that the superbug arose in the natural world long before the use of <a>drugs such as penicillin</a>, which have traditionally been blamed for its emergence.</p>
<p>The new research has the potential to fundamentally change our understanding of where and how MRSA developed.</p>
<p>The study revealed hedgehogs carry a fungus and a bacteria on their skin which are locked in a “battle for survival”.</p>
<p>Antibiotics designed to kill the bacteria are secreted by the fungus. However, in response, the bacteria has evolved antibiotic resistance - becoming Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA.</p>
<p>Up to 60 per cent of hedgehogs carry a type of MRSA called mecC-MRSA, which causes one in 200 of all MRSA infections in humans, according to the study.</p>
<p>The researchers suggest natural biological processes, not antibiotic use, drove the initial emergence of this superbug among hedgehogs about 200 years ago.</p>
<p>The study was an international collaboration including the University of Cambridge, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, Denmark's Serum Statens Institut and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, which has traced the genetic history of the bacteria.</p>
<p>The scientists began investigating the discovery, which was first found in hedgehogs in Denmark and Sweden, and subsequently found high levels of MRSA in swabs taken from hedgehogs across Europe and New Zealand.</p>
<p>"Our study suggests that it wasn't the use of penicillin that drove the initial emergence of MRSA, it was a natural biological process.</p>
<p>"We think MRSA evolved in a battle for survival on the skin of hedgehogs, and subsequently spread to livestock and humans through direct contact."</p>
<h2>‘Stark warning’ over the use of antibiotics</h2>
<p>Penicillin was not discovered until 1928, by Alexander Fleming at St Mary's Hospital, in London.</p>
<p>Given that almost all the antibiotics used today arose in nature, the researchers say it is likely resistance to them already exists in nature too.</p>
<p>Overuse of any antibiotic in humans or livestock will favour resistant strains of the bug, so it is only a matter of time before the antibiotic starts to lose its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has warned that MRSA and other superbugs could return medicine to the "Dark Ages" if not used responsibly.</p>
<p>Professor Mark Holmes, a researcher in the University of Cambridge's department of veterinary medicine and a senior author of the report, said: "This study is a stark warning that when we use antibiotics, we have to use them with care.</p>
<p>"There's a very big wildlife reservoir where antibiotic-resistant bacteria can survive and, from there, it's a short step for them to be picked up by livestock and, then, to infect humans."</p>
<h2>No reason to fear hedgehogs</h2>
<p>Previous work led by Prof Holmes first identified mecC-MRSA in human and dairy cow populations.</p>
<p>At that time, it was assumed the strain had arisen in the cows because of the large amount of antibiotics they are routinely given.</p>
<p>However, the researchers say the new findings are not a reason to fear your local hedgehogs, as humans very rarely get infections with mecC-MRSA</p>
<p>Prof Holmes said: "Wild animals, livestock and humans are all interconnected - we all share one ecosystem.</p>
<p>"It isn't possible to understand the evolution of antibiotic resistance unless you look at the whole system."</p>
<p>The research, published in Nature, was funded by the Medical Research Council.</p>

<header> <h1> Quadrantid meteor shower 2022: how to watch the peak and other key UK dates </h1> <p> Meteor showers come and go throughout the year, but when in January can you watch the Quadrantids? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Megan Slack and Raven Saunt, Evergreen Content Editor <time> 3 January 2022 • 12:29pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Many of us will be marking our calendars for January 3 to catch a glimpse of the Quadrantids in the first significant meteor shower of the year.</p>
<p>Set to peak late at night until dawn on January 4, the Quadrantid meteor shower is also one of the most unusual, as it is likely it originated from an asteroid.</p>
<p>The meteor shower was first spotted by the Italian astronomer Antonio Brucalassi in 1825, and astronomers suspect the shower originates from the comet C/1490 Y1, which was first observed 500 years ago by Japanese, Chinese and Korean astronomers.</p>
<p>It is known for its "bright fireball meteors", which is, according to NASA, among the best annual meteor showers.</p>
<p>The Quadrantids appear to radiate from the extinct constellation Quadrans Muralis, which is now part of the Boötes constellation and not far from the Big Dipper.</p>
<p>Because of the constellation's position in the sky, the shower is often impossible to see in the Southern Hemisphere. However, there is a chance of spotting it up to 51 degrees south latitude.</p>
<p>The best spots to see the display are in countries with high northern latitudes, like Norway, Sweden, Canada and Finland.</p>
<p>But don't worry if you miss out on seeing the Quadrantids, as there are plenty of other opportunities to see the sky full of streaks of light.</p>
<p>Here, we have compiled a complete guide on when, where and how you can see all the meteor showers of 2022.</p>
<h2>What exactly is a meteor shower?</h2>
<p>A meteor shower occurs when Earth passes through the debris stream occupying the orbit of a comet or, in simpler terms, when a number of meteors flash across the sky from roughly the same point.</p>
<p>Meteors are sometimes called shooting stars, although they actually have nothing to do with stars.</p>
<p>Anything larger than a grape will produce a fireball, which is often accompanied by a persistent afterglow known as a meteor train. This is a column of ionised gas slowly fading from view as it loses energy.</p>
<h2>Meteor, meteoroid or meteorite?</h2>
<p>A meteor is a meteoroid – or a particle broken off an asteroid or comet orbiting the Sun – that burns up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a "shooting star".</p>
<p>Meteoroids that reach the Earth's surface without disintegrating are called meteorites.</p>
<p>Meteors are mostly pieces of comet dust and ice no larger than a grain of rice. Meteorites are principally rocks broken off asteroids in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter and weigh as much as 60 tonnes.</p>
<p>They can be "stony", made up of minerals rich in silicon and oxygen, "iron", consisting mainly of iron and nickel, or "stony-iron", a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Scientists think about 1,000 tons to more than 10,000 tons of material from meteors falls on Earth each day, but it's mostly dust-like grains, according to NASA, and they pose no threat to Earth.</p>
<p>There are only two recorded incidents of an injury caused by a meteorite. One of these instances saw a woman bruised by a meteorite, weighing eight pounds, after it fell through her roof in 1954. </p>
<h2>Meteor showers in 2022</h2>
<p>The Lyrid meteor shower occurs between April 16 and April 25 every year, and 2022 will be no exception. These meteors travel through the atmosphere at approximately 107,000mph and explode about 55 miles above the Earth's atmosphere. </p>
<p>Nicknamed "Lyrid fireballs", these cast shadows for a split second before leaving smokey debris trails that linger for minutes behind.</p>
<p>The shower is visible in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and offers stargazers a chance to see up to 18 meteors per hour during its peak. In 2022, the peak will fall between April 22 and 23.</p>
<p>It occurs when the ionised gas in the meteors' trail burns up as it enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating the glow that can be seen streaking across the night sky. </p>
<p>Flakes of comet dust, most no bigger than grains of sand, strike Earth's atmosphere travelling 49 km/s (110,000 mph) and disintegrate as streaks of light.</p>
<h2>Eta Aquarids meteor shower</h2>
<p>Also known as the Eta Aquariids, the Eta Aquarids is the first of a pair of meteor showers that originate from Halley's Comet, the most renowned cosmic body of them all. In 2022, the Eta Aquarids will peak between May 5 and 6. </p>
<p>The shower produces shooting stars when the Earth passes along Halley's debris stream, which, in turn, creates tiny particles that burn in the upper atmosphere. </p>
<p>During its peak, the Perseids sparkle in the summer sky, when the Earth collides with particles of debris left behind by the Swift-Tuttle Comet.</p>
<p>In 2021, the Moon was only 13 per cent full and set as the meteors began to appear - allowing viewers to see around 50 to 75 meteors per hour on its optimum night.</p>
<p>The shower found its name from the Greek word, Perseidai, meaning the sons of Perseus in Greek mythology, which refers to the point in which they appear to hail. </p>
<h2>Draconid meteor shower</h2>
<p>Also known as the Giacobinids, the Draconids belong to periodic comet 21P/Giacobini-Zinner and are best seen in the Northern Hemisphere (though it is still possible to see them in the Southern Hemisphere). </p>
<p>In 2022, the shower will hit its peak between October 8 and 9 but unfavourable weather conditions, including cloud and fog, have often overshadowed the view for spectators in previous years. </p>
<p>Extra special and rare, the shower is only visible from earth every 75 or 76 years - in 2022, it will peak during the early hours of October 21 and 22 and be visible across both hemispheres.</p>
<p>The Orinid meteors appear to come from the Orion constellation direction, usually travelling at around 41 miles per second, meaning you could catch as many as 20 meteors per hour. </p>
<h2>Leonid meteor shower </h2>
<p>The Leonid meteor shower occurs when the Earth passes through the Tempel-Tuttle comet, which rotates around the Sun every 33 years. When this happens, thousands of shooting stars are visible from our planet.</p>
<p>In 2022, it will peak in mid-November and viewers may be able to spot approximately 10 to 20 meteors per hour. However, this may be a little optimistic, as the meteors may fall under the horizon across the UK.</p>
<p>The next impressive display is not expected until 2034.</p>
<p>The Geminids will grace our skies from December 17 to December 26 in 2022, peaking on December 22.</p>
<p>It always appears from the Gemini constellation, hence its name.</p>
<p>While the Ursids may be the last of the annual meteor showers, it is by no means least. </p>
<p>Yes, the shower is typically sparse in meteors; however, the Moon is in its first-quarter phase at this time of the year, and so, you won't have to worry that its light will tint your view of the meteors.</p>
<h2>How to watch meteor showers in the UK</h2>
<p>Unsurprisingly, meteor showers are best enjoyed once night falls, in the darkest conditions.</p>
<p>Meteorologists also suggest avoiding light pollution, so stargazers and photographers alike escape built-up areas, and head to the countryside, or a National Park, where you can view the showers in all their glory.</p>
<p>Choose a dark location away from stray lights and give yourself at least 20 minutes to appropriately adapt in total darkness. </p>
<li>Galloway Forest Park: Galloway is a couple of hours from Glasgow and an hour from Carlisle. The park's most popular spot for stargazing is Loch Trool.</li>
<li>Exmoor and around: Exmoor was granted International Dark-Sky Reserve status by the International Dark-Sky Association in 2011. Light pollution has managed to make the area more appealing to amateur astronomers.</li>
<li>Romney Marsh: Night once provided cover for smugglers known as Owlers, but today Romney Marsh offers celestial bounty, arching over a landscape adorned with the spires of ancient churches.</li>
<li>North York Moors: As well as stunning night skies, the North York Moors boast historic market towns such as Helmsley and Pickering, plus appealing coastal spots, including Scarborough and Whitby.</li>

<header> <h1> Wolf Moon 2022: what time it peaks in the UK and other full moon dates </h1> <p> Full moons illuminate the sky every month - but what time will January Wolf Moon peak? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Raven Saunt, Evergreen Content Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 4:07pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The first full moon of 2022 will be the Wolf Moon, expected to grace our skies at 11.48pm on January 17.</p>
<p>This full moon was so named because villagers used to hear packs of wolves howling in hunger around this time of the year. It's also known as the Old Moon, Ice Moon and Snow Moon, although the latter is usually associated with February's full moon.</p>
<p>Here we've compiled a complete guide to the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite and the largest and brightest object in our night sky, which has enchanted and inspired mankind for centuries.</p>
<p>From supermoon to blue moon, here's everything explained in one place.</p>
<h2>When is the next full moon?</h2>
<p>The next full moon, otherwise known as the Wolf Moon, will reach it's peak on Monday, January 17 at 11.48pm.</p>
<h2>How often does a full moon occur?</h2>
<p>A full moon occurs every 29.5 days and happens when the Moon is completely illuminated by the Sun's rays. It occurs when the Earth is directly aligned between the Sun and the Moon. </p>
<p>While most years see 12 full moons, some years have 13. This means that some months will see two full moons, with the second known as a Blue Moon.</p>
<p>This happened in 2020, when 13 full moons graced our skies, with the two full moons in October, as well as four penumbral lunar eclipses. </p>
<h2>Why do full moons have different names?</h2>
<p>The early Native Americans didn't record time using months of the Julian or Gregorian calendar. Instead tribes gave each full moon a nickname to keep track of the seasons and lunar months.</p>
<p>Colonial Americans adopted some of the moon names and applied them to their own calendar system which is why they're still in existence today, according to the Farmer’s Almanac.</p>
<h2>When are the full moons of 2022?</h2>
<h2>February: Snow Moon</h2>
<p>The Snow Moon is named after the cold white stuff because historically it's always been the snowiest month in America. It's also traditionally referred to as the Hunger Moon, because hunting was very difficult in snowy conditions.</p>
<p>As temperatures warm, earthworm casts begin to appear and birds start finding food. It also has multiple other names including the Sap Moon, Crow Moon and Crust Moon, while its Anglo Saxon name is the Lenten Moon.</p>
<p>The Worm Moon graces our skies in the same month as the Spring Equinox. This full moon is important because it is used to fix the date of Easter, which is always the Sunday after the first full moon following the spring equinox. </p>
<p>April's full moon is known as the Pink Moon, but don't be fooled into thinking it will turn pink. It's actually named after pink wildflowers, which appear in North America in early spring.</p>
<p>It is also known as the Egg Moon, due to spring egg-laying season. Some coastal tribes referred to it as Fish Moon because it appeared at the same time as the shad swimming upstream. </p>
<p>The Pink Moon appears during the same month as a <a>meteor shower</a>. </p>
<p>Spring has officially sprung by the time May arrives, and flowers and colourful blooms dot the landscape.</p>
<p>This full moon is also known as Corn Planting Moon, as crops are sown in time for harvest, or Milk Moon, as May was previously known as the "Month of Three Milkings". </p>
<p>In 2022, this will coincide with a total lunar eclipse. Those in the UK will not be able to see every part of the eclipse, but will still be able to see it at totality when the entire Moon turns red.</p>
<p>This full moon is named after the beginning of the strawberry picking season. It is also known as Rose Moon or Hot Moon, commemorating the start of the summer's warm weather.</p>
<p>It appears in the same month as the summer solstice, the <a>longest day of the year</a>, in which we can enjoy around 16 hours and 38 minutes of daylight.</p>
<p>Named due to the prevalence of summer thunder storms. It's otherwise known as the Full Buck Moon because at this time of the year a buck's antlers are fully grown. </p>
<p>Synonymous with the final days of summer and the beginning of the harvest, the Sturgeon Moon is named after the prehistoric-looking fish that Native Americans would catch at this time of year.</p>
<p>It is also often referred to as the green corn moon, the grain moon, and the red moon for the reddish hue it often takes on in the summer haze.</p>
<h2>September: Harvest Moon</h2>
<p>Some tribes also called it the Barley Moon, the Full Corn Moon or Fruit Moon. </p>
<h2>October: Hunter's Moon</h2>
<p>October's full moon is so named as it came to signify the ideal time for hunting game, which were becoming fatter from eating falling grains, as people planned for the cold months ahead.</p>
<p>It is also known as the Travel Moon and the Dying Grass Moon.</p>
<p>Beavers typically start building their winter dams in November, leading to this full moon moniker. In addition, winter frosts historically began to take their toll during this time, hence its alternative name of Frost Moon, too.</p>
<a>Holcomb Observatory</a> at Butler University, Indiana.
<p>The final full moon of the year is the Cold Moon, which is so named after the long and dark nights as winter's grip tightens. </p>
