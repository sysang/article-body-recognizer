<p>It certainly took off quickly Down Under, first in New South Wales, then spreading to other Australian wine regions. Some plantings of shiraz in the country are well over 100 years old.</p>
<p>Expect the flavours of a premium Aussie shiraz to be blackcurrant, plum, brambles (this fruitiness is so good with the succulent meat and with cranberry sauce), with twists of black pepper and a little sweet spice (think clove and cinnamon). </p>
<p>I detect dark chocolate and liquorice in some of the wines. And most important for matching with the Christmas spread is the texture: so smooth, ripe and rounded, with a fresh fruity finish.</p>
<p>You don’t need to do this hours in advance, just whenever you can during a hectic day. Even at the last minute, decanting an Aussie shiraz will have a magical effect on this gentle giant of the wine world.</p>

<h1> Coventry United handed reprieve after 'verbal agreement' is reached to save club from liquidation </h1>
<p> Businessman Lewis Taylor expected to back manager Jay Bradford, and pay players and staff wages from December once sale has gone through </p>
<div> <div> By Tom Garry, Women's Football Reporter <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:46pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Women’s Championship club Coventry United have been rescued from the brink of liquidation after shareholders reached a verbal agreement for an 11th-hour sale of the club.</p>
<p>But that was avoided after a deal to save the club was agreed in principle on Tuesday, leaving Taylor poised to essentially purchase the company for £1 in exchange for taking on the existing debts.</p>
<p>The formal takeover of the club may take a few more days to complete, but the verbal agreement between the parties has been deemed sufficient to call off the liquidators and halt the process of closing down the company.</p>
<p>Taylor has vowed to invest in the region of £200,000-250,0000 initially to ensure the club can complete the season and plan for the future.</p>
<p>"It might take up to a week to get the whole thing done, we still need to do the legal transfer of ownership of the club, which will now take place over the coming days, but this is stage one complete.</p>
<p>Taylor is already a financial supporter of women’s football, as his company Energy Angels sponsor Wolves Women, who are third in the northern section of the third tier of women's football.</p>
<p>Taylor intends to give his full backing the team’s manager, Jay Bradford, and believes the squad are more than capable of staying in the Championship this season.</p>
<p>Their first scheduled match back after the Championship’s winter break, an away trip to Bristol City on January 9, was called off according to a statement by the West Country club on December 29.</p>

<p>The Tokyo Aquatic Centre was one Olympic venue in 2021 where there was just a modicum of atmosphere.</p>
<p>Entire teams and coaching staff would attend each morning session when the medals were decided and the tension among the British contingent on July 26 was palpable.</p>
<p>Peaty had not lost a 100m breaststroke of any meaning since 2014 and, while that sequence was ultimately never under serious threat, the pressure of upholding seven years of dominance over the space of just 57 seconds was still vast.</p>
<p>His time of 57.37sec was marginally slower than some had forecast, but still the fifth best in history and quicker than anyone before or since.</p>
<h2>Tyson Fury knocks out Deontay Wilder</h2>
<p>What a fight, what a night. Gareth A Davies</p>
<h2>Petr Cech calms Super League protesters</h2>
<p>Why did the European Super League collapse? Ask any of the Chelsea supporters who marched on Stamford Bridge in April, and they will give you one answer: fan power.</p>
<p>To them, and to supporters of other clubs across the country, it was the strength of feeling from the fans which proved crucial in forcing the surrender of the European giants. </p>
<p>It is hard to argue with that assessment, especially when one considers the look of shock that was etched on the face of Petr Cech as he emerged from Chelsea’s stadium to address the club’s furious fans. </p>
<h2>Max Verstappen drives over Lewis Hamilton</h2>
<p>After playing nicely for a few races, the relationship really soured at Silverstone when the two rivals touched at Copse on the opening lap, sending Verstappen careering into the barriers at an estimated 51G. </p>
<p>“I don’t think I have ever been hit on the head by a car before. I’m so grateful I am still here.” Tom Cary</p>
<h2>Mark Cavendish equals Eddy Merckx</h2>
<p>It wasn’t just one of cycling’s great comebacks, it was one of sport’s great comebacks, up there with Tiger Woods, Sir Bobby Charlton, Niki Lauda, Monica Seles, and Muhammad Ali. </p>
<p>It looked at that stage as if the outright record would be his. It wasn’t to be. And it may never be. But for one glorious summer, Cav was back. Tom Cary</p>
<h2>England beat Germany at the Euros</h2>
<p>For England, even though they went on to reach the final of Euro 2020, losing a penalty shoot-out to Italy, this was the game that defined the competition for them: the last-16 victory over Germany.</p>
<p>Maybe it was also the game that defined Gareth Southgate’s five-year reign – so far – as manager. Win and he received full vindication for his approach, his tactics, his team selection. Lose and he would have been vilified.</p>
<p>It was a ragged and tense encounter and the fans, 45,000 of them inside Wembley as Covid restrictions eased – for a fixture originally scheduled for Dublin - simmered as they were not sure they really believed in the team or the manager.</p>
<h2>Emma Raducanu wins the US Open</h2>
<h2>Rachel Blackmore wins the Grand National</h2>
<p>“I don’t feel male or female right now,” the 31 year old Irishwoman replied when asked how it felt to be the first woman winner. “I don’t even feel human.”</p>
<p>It is a fair point: after the year she had, taking the double of the Gold Cup and the Grand National, she might well be described as superhuman. This is a jockey not just keeping up with the lads, but way out in front. </p>
<h2>Tom Daley cries tears of joy</h2>
<p>At his fourth Olympics, the boy who was a household name before even becoming a man finally had his chance. He, and Lee, nervelessly refused to let it pass.</p>
<p>There was no more poignant British Olympic gold than Daley’s in Tokyo because there was no better known member of Team GB and no one whose entire life has been as forensically analysed.</p>
<p>Remarkably, despite people knocking him for ‘only’ winning Olympic bronzes before this summer, he stuck at his day job and refused to indulge in fame.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful snapshot that encapsulated more than most of us could know. Ben Bloom</p>
<h2>Phil Mickelson wins the PGA Championship</h2>
<p>Of course, the healthy and safety brigade were not at all impressed and an apology from the organisers was duly issued the next day, but in the actual moment the fans swarming around Phil Mickelson as he walked up the 18th was joyous indeed. </p>
<p>The South Carolinans were unashamed in heroic worship of Lefty. Immensely popular anyway, this US PGA success elevated him from the darling of the American galleries to undoubted all-time great. </p>
<p>A triumph for the aged, here was a bugle call to those with ear trumpets everywhere.</p>
