<h3>The controversial: ASIC chairman James Shipton</h3>

<p>By the time the allegations hit the Federal Court, Papas was safely ensconced in Greece. Liquidators were left to chase down assets (including a $60 million property portfolio) and recoup as much of the allegedly missing funds as possible.</p>
<h3>The winners: Afterpay founders Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen</h3>
<p>Afterpay’s fresh-faced founders Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen saw off their doubters when Afterpay struck a $39 billion deal in August to sell the company to US giant Block (previously Square), headed up by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey.</p>
<p>Shareholders and market watchers cheered the deal which sailed through with 99.8 per cent of votes cast favouring the Block buy-up.</p>
<p>Not a bad outcome for a company that was only founded in 2014 and possibly perfectly timed given the increasing interest in regulators in the buy now, pay later sector.</p>
<h3>The vindicated: Australia Post former chief Christine Holgate</h3>
<p>Also in August, came the vindication of former Australia Post boss Christine Holgate when the government-owned group agreed to pay her $1 million plus $100,000 for legal fees over its handling of her 2020 departure.</p>

<div>Traders walk a tightrope in a topsy-turvy market</div>
<p>A year of extraordinary returns on the Australian stock market has been counter-balanced by difficult real-life conditions with lockdowns, anxiety over rising COVID case numbers, protests and border closures.</p>
<p>Supply chains were stretched and elongated as cargo ships raced around ports rushing Chinese-made goods to the rest of the world and driving shipping prices up to historical highs.</p>
<h3>2021 was just 2020’s second half</h3>
<p>New York-based senior portfolio manager for American Century, Trevor Gurwich, said there were several surprises in 2021 with the pandemic throwing up new challenges all the time.</p>
<p>“It was a tough market for fundamental investors. During 2021, the thing that surprised was the Delta variant and keeping it under control, plus vaccine hesitancy,” he said over a video call held before the Omicron variant was announced.</p>
<p>“That has put a monkey wrench into the economies because it has delayed that opening and made things far more uncertain.”</p>
<p>He also said 2021 was more like the second-half of 2020, and it was difficult to understand one year without the other.</p>
<p>The first half of the story saw everyone stuck-at-home while the second-half saw a new willingness to step outside.</p>
<p>“Towards the end of 2020, what we saw was the results from the election and approval of the vaccines that would effectively combat COVID-19. That really injected a lot of value cyclically into the market,” Mr Gurwich said.</p>
<p>“You saw banks rally, energy rally, a lot of the commodity companies rallying. What you saw was a really big adrenaline rush into the markets in the first half of 2021.”</p>
<p>It may have started with a rush, but the year soon turned into a very unusual roller coaster ride, according to Annie Liu, the former head of supply chain, battery and energy at Tesla, and now a non-executive director at Vulcan Energy.</p>
<p>For example, one of the biggest dramas was a shortage in semiconductors - a complex issue. It started when backend packaging factories in Asia were forced to shut down in mid-2020 due to COVID-19.</p>
<h3><b>The Green Dollar</b></h3>
<p>“They are coming to us, and they have this new pot of money, and they are saying ‘well we have very strong views on how it should be invested. What’s the overall philosophy?’,” Mr McCauley said.</p>
<p>In the last two years he has noticed ultra-high net wealth clients wanted to invest in renewables to help decarbonise the economy and were putting pressure on companies to eradicate modern slavery in their global supply chains.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the pandemic gave companies a chance to prove themselves. Australia’s banks played a social role during the pandemic when they agreed to defer mortgage repayments for people whose income was affected by the lockdowns.</p>
<p>“That’s a big ESG tick,” Mr David said.</p>
<h3>Mergers and acquisitions</h3>
<p>And if anyone doubted how much money was still sitting on the sidelines right up to the end of the year, CSL’s $16.4 billion bid for Swiss pharma company Vifor in mid-December made it crystal clear.</p>
<p>“We don’t expect the level of MA activity to continue as it has in 2021,” Mr David said.</p>
<p>However, he also warned that “the worst deals are done at the top of the market”, and CSL-Vifor was no exception.</p>
<p>“Vifor is a specialty pharmaceutical business, with revenue dependent on new product launches to offset patent expiry on existing drugs,” Mr David said.</p>
<h3><b>Materials and commodities </b></h3>
<p>Prices spike in mid-2021 for two of Australia’s biggest commodities - iron ore and coal - as China raced to make steel needed for domestic and foreign infrastructure projects launched by governments to keep their economies going.</p>
<p>But for lithium miners, stock prices kept rising right to the end of the year due to insatiable thirst for battery-ingredient minerals like lithium, nickel, and rare earths. The green dollar kicked it higher after the Glasgow climate conference.</p>
<p>Lithium miner IGO has gained nearly 70 per cent this year, while Orocobre, which changed its name to Allkem, has jumped close to 102 per cent. Pilbara Minerals has jumped over 170 per cent.</p>
<p>“Whether this is going to crash again in the near future similar to 2018 and 2019?...I don’t think so,” said Ms Liu.</p>
<p>“Back in 2018 most electric vehicle (EV) original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), except for Tesla, were not ready to commit, resulting in an over-supply situation in the market at that time.”</p>

<div>‘Huge investor demand’ turned 2021 into bumper year for IPOs</div>
<p>The Australian sharemarket has seen one of its strongest years for initial public offerings ever in 2021, with 240 companies listing on the ASX this calendar year.</p>
<p>More importantly, the quantity of sharemarket floats has not been at the expense of quality, according to ASX’s head of listings, Max Cunningham.</p>
<p>The market operator hosted a record number of billion-dollar-plus floats, with nine debutantes breaking this barrier in 2021.</p>
<p>“I think that’s probably the one stand-out statistic,” Mr Cunningham says.</p>
<p>And that does not include near-misses like 29Metals, which hit the market with a $960 million valuation, and Vulcan Steel, which clocked in at $930 million.</p>
<p>Australian IPOs rose 159 per cent in 2021, and proceeds rose by 144 per cent, according to data by consultancy EY.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘We’re well, well above forecast.’</p><cite>Max Cunningham, ASX’s Group Executive, Listings</cite></blockquote>
<p>“Right now the market is hot,” says Hogg. And it bodes well for 2022.</p>
<p>“Provided the market continues to trade at these levels, my view is we’ll see a number of parties coming out early in the new year to try and aggressively push IPOs even prior to the half-year results,” he says.</p>
<p>The multiple-billion-dollar floats partly reflect the sophistication of the pre-IPO market, which gives companies access to funding alternatives to help develop their business ahead of an IPO at higher valuations.</p>
<p>“A lot of those companies have chosen to access private capital and stay private longer, and come to market when they’ve got more mature business models,” Cunningham says.</p>
<p>Judo Bank is a case in point. It raised hundreds of millions of dollars over five rounds of private funding before listing in November with a $2.3 billion market valuation.</p>
<p>Hotel commerce platform Siteminder was another billion-dollar-plus IPO in November that relied on private capital to build its business before staging one of the most successful sharemarket floats this year.</p>
<p>IT service management company Airwallex and graphic design site Canva are each worth billions and have yet to go public.</p>
<p>The big floats may have set a record, but the sheer number of floats still deserves attention.</p>
<p>The ASX views 120 annual listings as an average outcome in the current IPO cycle, which began 2013, and 140 listings is considered good.</p>
<p>Just before Christmas, the ASX had recorded 240 listings - the highest number since a record crop in 2007 which topped 300.</p>
<p>“We’re well, well above forecast,” Cunningham says.</p>
<p>In 2020, the ASX listed just 114 companies despite a strong lift in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Investors have not been put off by the fact that many prominent floats have not performed to plan this year.</p>
<p>This includes consumer finance provider Pepper Money, which is trading materially below its IPO price. So has Latitude Financial, which finally made its way to market on the third attempt.</p>
<p>The multi-billion dollar float of APM Human Services has never traded at the $3.55 paid by investors ahead of its IPO. Others, like property conveyancer PEXA, were treading water before recent MA speculation gave it a boost.</p>
<p>There were also late disappointments like Chalice Mining’s gold assets spin-off Falcon Metals. It dropped 37 per cent below its 50c IPO price at its trading debut on the Wednesday before Christmas.</p>
<p>Hogg says technology and healthcare companies are expected to underpin anther hot year for IPOs in 2022, but warns that the IPO window of opportunity could close quickly if the market loses confidence.</p>
<p>“Market confidence is quite fickle, it can change very quickly,” he says.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen it too many times in my career where we think it’s all going well, and then suddenly, something comes out of the blue that just shuts the window.”</p>
<p>But the ASX says there is a strong pipeline of companies lining up for a float early in the new year already, with candidates across the industrial sector, retail, tech, healthcare, and financials.</p>
<p>“When I speak to the investment banks, they have a similar perspective,” says Cunningham. “There is this huge investor demand.”</p>

<h3><a>Inflation is here, but how long will it stay?</a></h3>
<p>The jury is still out on how sticky inflation is going to be as the world plots its way out of the pandemic, and it’s a debate that will dominate markets in 2022.</p>
<div><h5>Opinion</h5><h5>Sharemarket</h5></div>
<h3>Buckle up, investors! It could be a wild ride in 2022</h3>
<p>The shifting course of the pandemic and central bank policies next year will create a framework for greater risk and volatility than we saw in 2021.</p>
<h3><a>RBA’s next big call shapes up as a cliffhanger for economists</a></h3>
<p>Economists are split over the fate of the Reserve Bank’s bond-buying program, and the Omicron variant only adds to the uncertainty.</p>
<h3><a>Why Jerome Powell pivoted on inflation</a></h3>

<h3><a>Bank of England raises rate in attempt to control inflation</a></h3>

<div>Inflation and China failed to rattle markets. 2022 might be different.</div>
<p>The surge in inflation is even more striking given that, unlike what textbooks and prior experience would suggest, its impact on markets has been muted.</p>
<blockquote><p>Two changes to the landscape — rapid inflation, and questions about the viability of investing in China — caught nearly everyone off-guard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yields on government bonds, for example, have been relatively subdued, with 10-year US Treasury notes still trading around 1.50 per cent. Indeed, if anything, yields adjusted for inflation have fallen deeper into negative territory.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, stocks have gone from one record high to another, reaching a total of 70 for the SP 500 Index this year.</p>
<p>This makes the new year an uncertain proposition for the economy, for markets and for public policy.</p>
<p>Will inflation derail economic growth while also worsening inequality? How long will it take for the Federal Reserve to catch up to inflation realities, and which policy measures will it deploy?</p>
<p>How quickly will a tightening of market financial conditions follow the pivot to fewer stimulus policies from central banks? How big will the economic and financial impact be, in the US and across the world?</p>
<p>Will yields rise as bond investors look to limit the erosion in the real value of their investment? If so, how will stocks react?</p>
<p>Which countries and sectors are particularly sensitive to higher market volatility?</p>
<h3>The China investability surprise</h3>
<p>The evolution of inflation and China’s investability constituted big surprises in 2021, as did their lack of spillover into other areas. It remains to be seen how benign last year’s surprises will stay for the global economy and markets.</p>

<div>Theranos verdict won’t stop investors from pouring money into the next big fraud</div>
<p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of the medical device company Theranos, was convicted on multiple counts of defrauding investors following a four-month trial in federal court in San Jose.</p>
<p>The case raises the important question of whether the testimony and result will serve as object lessons for investors confronted with cheery promises in the future. Bet your money that the answer is “no.”</p>
<p>High-tech investing is predisposed to take even clearly hyperbolic projections as part of the game.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, that’s true. All entrepreneurs making pitches to venture capital funds are inclined to promise castles in the air and riches beyond the dreams of Croesus, or they won’t be invited through the door.</p>
<p>The current frenzy is driven in part by what venture investors call “tourists” — investors coming from outside the venture community and bidding up deal prices.</p>
<p>In 2013, when venture investor Aileen Lee first coined the term “unicorn” for startups valued at $US1 billion or more, she identified 39. Today, the venture research firm CB Insights lists more than 900.</p>
<p>Theranos presents a perfect example of the pitfalls of the new dynamic.</p>
<p>First, the promise of disruption. In this case, the target was the medical testing industry.</p>
<p>By contrast, Holmes said, her tests could cost consumers pennies in relative terms and could be performed on blood volumes that would fit in a container the size of a pain-reliever capsule.</p>
<p>The first journalists to publicise Theranos in 2013 and 2014 made the fundamental error of taking Holmes at her own level of self-esteem.</p>
<p>Rago quoted Holmes promising “a watershed opportunity to change the trajectory of health costs through price transparency.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the investment ecosystem had been running at full speed. Among the very first to sign on was former Secretary of State George Shultz, who met Holmes while he was a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution on the Stanford campus.</p>
<p>Shultz joined the Theranos board in 2011. He may have been instrumental in luring other Hoover fellows into the fold, including former Defence Secretary William Perry, former General James Mattis and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>According to John Carreyrou, the Wall Street Journal reporter who finally exposed Theranos, Shultz also brought Theranos to the attention of the Journal editorial board, resulting in Rago’s article.</p>
<p>None of those board members had experience in the biomedical field, but their names alone were enough to give the company credibility. Even veteran venture investors were swayed by the trappings of success.</p>
<p>That glossed over the obvious point that if the technical aspects of Theranos were fabricated, the social implications might not be too vast — or too positive.</p>
<p>Members of the DeVos family, whose fortune derives from the Amway multi-level marketing company and which includes Donald Trump’s Education secretary, Betsy DeVos, among its members, met with Holmes after the Fortune article appeared.</p>
<p>The family planned to invest $US50 million, jurors were told, but after the meeting raised its stake to $US100 million — in part because the family was led to believe that it was among a handpicked group of investors invited to join in.</p>
<p>“I do believe that I was misled — intentionally,” he wrote. “But I was also culpable, in that I failed to prove certain exasperatingly opaque answers that I repeatedly received.”</p>
<p>How many of the factors that enabled Theranos to raise hundreds of millions of dollars without a workable technology have changed?</p>
<div><p>That’s human nature. The only difference is that the numbers next to the dollar signs are bigger.</p><p>The Los Angeles Times</p></div>

<h3><a>As pandemic takes its toll, investors keen to donate returns</a></h3>
<p>Financial planner Peter Burke says in the face of the pandemic, investors are keen to donate some of their money to support their local communities.</p>
<h3><a>‘Makes me nervous’: Veteran fund manager Geoff Wilson urges caution in bull market</a></h3>
<p>Future Generation’s Geoff Wilson is unnerved by the excess in the market, and says it’s important to focus on the medium to long term than immediate market gains.</p>
<div>As pandemic takes its toll, investors keen to donate returns</div>
<p>Financial planner Peter Burke usually helps his clients decide where to invest their millions of dollars but now he asks them to give some of their returns away, joining the growing interest in impact and sustainable investing.</p>
<p>Over the past four years, Mr Burke has been asking his clients at Burke Britton Financial Partners to suggest charities to support in the group’s local area of Geelong.</p>
<p>Across Mr Burke’s 500 clients between $18 million to $20 million is invested in Future Generation - and the group can vote for where their slice of those donations go.</p>
<p>“For those of us who have done reasonably well in life, don’t take it for granted... there’s a big proportion of the population who are economically seriously deprived,” he said.</p>
<p>His clients’ money supports a range of groups including Kids Plus, which offers therapy to children with physical disabilities, and Geelong Mums, which collects and redistributes toys and household goods for those in need.</p>
<p>The pandemic has been tough for many smaller businesses but for sharemarket investors and startup founders it has delivered significant returns, with a soaring market and free-flowing venture capital.</p>
<p>Ninety-nine per cent of millennial investors reported they wanted their portfolios to take these factors into account.</p>
<p>Mr Burke said he would like to see more funds offer charitable donation options, observing that plenty of fund managers “have made buckets of money” but few funds have a mandate to give some profits to other causes.</p>

<div>Investment returns tipped to be lower in 2022</div>
<p>It is the start of a new year and financial market experts are making their annual fearless forecasts for the performance of share and property markets.</p>
<p>If the pundits are right, returns from major asset classes will not be anywhere near what they were last year.</p>
<p>Australian share prices, as measured by the benchmark SP/ASX 200 Index, ended 2021 about 13 per cent higher. After adding dividends, the total return was a stellar 17 per cent.</p>
<p>However, Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP, says despite solid economic growth, rising profits and still easy monetary conditions, investors should expect only reasonable returns this year.</p>
<p>He is forecasting the SP/ASX 200 to finish the year at about 7800 points – about 5 per cent higher than its current level.</p>
<p>Property had a stellar 2021 and experts are predicting further price growth this year, albeit at a much slower pace.</p>
<p>Sydney dwelling prices rose by 25.3 per cent last year and Melbourne’s prices ended the year 15.1 per cent higher.</p>
<p>However, the most recent CoreLogic figures show the tide is turning.</p>
<b> </b>monthly dwelling price growth rate, which peaked at 3.7 per cent in March last year, slowed to just 0.3 per cent in December. Melbourne’s monthly growth rate, which peaked at 2.4 per cent last March, was minus 0.1 per cent in December.
<p>AMP’s Dr Oliver expects house prices to soften and to start to fall later this year because of poor affordability, rising fixed rates, higher interest rate serviceability buffers, reduced home buyer incentives and more listings.</p>
<p>AMP economists expect property prices to rise just 5 per cent nationally this year, with prices likely to fall by 5 to 10 per cent during 2023.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank economists expect dwelling price growth of 7 per cent nationally in 2022, before a 10 per cent fall in 2023.</p>
<p>However, the national forecasts likely mask a wide price divergence between the big cities and regional areas.</p>
<p>Pressley says the price growth in the regions is being driven by net migration from the cities and the work-from-home phenomenon, which he reckons is likely to become a permanent change.</p>
<p>Economists at Russell Investments are forecasting official interest rates to remain unchanged this year. That is mostly because the economy has not yet seen the same levels of wage pressure as other countries.</p>
<p>If they are right, that will mean bank deposits continue to pay next-to-nothing. That would help support the sharemarket, which is expected to pay a grossed-up dividend yield of about 5 per cent.</p>
<p>Of course, there are plenty of issues that could derail any of the above forecasts.</p>
<p>The worry list includes the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the risks of other new variants, a rise in inflation and interest rates, any fragility in Chinese economic growth, and tensions between Russia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Then there is the no small matter of a federal election, which must be held no later than May.</p>

<div>Benjamin Netanyahu ‘discussing plea bargain’ in corruption trial</div>
<p>Jerusalem: Former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is negotiating a plea bargain to end his corruption trial, a source briefed on the matter said, but talks have snagged over a condition that would remove him from politics.</p>
<p>The source said Netanyahu, 72, was discussing a deal with Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit under which he would plead guilty to reduced charges and have any resulting jail term commuted to community service.</p>
<p>The State Attorney’s Office declined to comment. A lawyer for Netanyahu, who has denied all wrongdoing and accused prosecutors of a politically motivated witch-hunt, did not immediately reply to a request for a comment.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has vowed to unseat his successor, Naftali Bennett, a nationalist straddling a coalition of highly diverse parties.</p>
<p>Likud failed to form a new government last year in part because kindred parties refused to join Netanyahu, citing the ongoing trial.</p>
<p>The idea of a plea bargain was promoted by a former Supreme Court president, Aharon Barak.</p>
<p>He told Kan radio it would ease the pressure on the justice system, which has spent years defending itself against allegations from Netanyahu loyalists that he was being denied due process.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party said he did not know about any such negotiations.</p>
<div>In milestone, COVAX program delivers billionth shot</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>London: It’s a “remarkable milestone” that, at times, seemed out of reach.</p>
<p>But this weekend Covax distributed its billionth coronavirus shot, less than 11 months after the vaccine-sharing initiative delivered its first dose in Ghana.</p>
<p>But while the vaccine, which was sent to Rwanda, is a significant moment for what has become the largest vaccine procurement and supply operation in history, it lags well behind where the scheme hoped to be.</p>
<p>Here, we take a brief look at the scheme’s achievements to date.</p>
<p>Covax has distributed one in 10 doses worldwide</p>
<p>Across the world, more than 11.2bn doses have now been distributed in the drive to vaccinate the world against COVID. Just under 10 per cent of these have come via Covax.</p>
<p>The initial idea had been to ensure every country had enough shots to protect the most vulnerable segment of their society, such as medics and the elderly.</p>
<p>A senior official from Ivory Coast, Patrick Achi, followed soon after, and urged the country’s 200,000 workers to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>“Vaccination gives us hope to return to normal - to hug our friends, to go back to work, to live like we once did. To enjoy the human warmth we all know and miss,” he said.</p>
<p>Covax is responsible for purchasing and distributing vaccines, but once they reach a country it’s up to governments to get the shots into arms.</p>
<h3>Transport by boat, bike - and snow dogs</h3>
<p>It’s an intense logistical challenge to reach every corner of the globe. To reach remote villages in Nepal people have strapped vaccine boxes to their back and trekked through mountains, while healthcare workers in the Amazon travel via boat.</p>
<p>Motorbikes and bicycles are also used to transport the precious cargo - but so are snow dogs, camels, donkeys, drones, sleighs and even elephants, according to Unicef.</p>
