<h1> Worried the end is nigh? Ditch the queues and grab a spade – here's how to grow food for free </h1>
<p> Gardening offers a peaceful escape from coronavirus... and a source of fresh food. Take some tips from Huw Richards, the grow-your-own guru </p>
<div> <div> By Morgan Lawrence <time> 18 March 2020 • 11:20am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Who on earth would want to face the supermarket right now?</p>
<p>You’ll likely be met with scenes not too dissimilar from the pages of a dystopian novel: shelves of toiletries, vegetables, medication and dried goods laid bare, save for the odd packet of soybean pasta.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, supermarkets joined forces to release a letter to consumers in response to a rise in panic buying: “We would ask everyone to be considerate in the way they shop,” it states.</p>
<a>we’re wired to be that way. </a>
<p>Panic-buying is a withdrawal symptom from a lifetime of having whatever we want, whenever we want. The mere suggestion that supermarket stock could be scarce sends us all into a frenzy. </p>
<p>But it wasn’t always like this.Just ask anyone who lived throughout the last national emergency: the Second World War.</p>
<p>Simply put, vegetable patches offer the security and control that supermarkets cannot give during times of crisis.</p>
<p>For Huw Richards, this is precisely why he started gardening. For one year, he challenged himself to grow his own food for free and gained valuable insight and tips along the way. </p>
<p>It's time to grab a spade and dig for victory once more. </p>
<h3>Humble beginnings </h3>
<p>His parents, Steven and Clarissa, encouraged the children to take an active interest in rural farming, showing them as often as they could the connection between the vegetables growing on the plot and the dish on the table.</p>
<p>His journey had humble beginnings.</p>
<p>He found that, like many craftsmen, artists and video-makers, the sudden rise to social media stardom was not without its challenges. “If I could go back in time, I would tell myself not to focus on negativity,” he says.</p>
<p>His determination paid off, and a career as an author then began. Opening his inbox to find an email from the publisher Dorling Kindersley, he set to work on first book, <a>Veg in One Bed.</a></p>
<h3>Huw Richards’s top tips to grow food for free</h3>
<h4>Use somebody else’s garden</h4>
<li>“Perennial plants are the most important things in the first year, as it gives them time to establish. A great example is strawberry plants: people give them away and I do so every year because they breed like rabbits.</li>
<li>“The best thing about strawberries is that they don’t like super-fertile soil. If you plant now, simply pop in the ground mixed with coffee grounds or liquid compost and you’ll get a harvest in June or July.”</li>
<h3>Huw Richards’s Welsh cheesy leeks</h3>
<p>Prep time: 5 minutes | Cooking time: 20 minutes </p>
<ul> <li>5 leeks, trimmed and cut into 3cm lengths</li> <li>Large knob of salted butter, softened</li> <li>80g Hafod cheddar cheese, grated</li> <li>Freshly cracked black pepper, to garnish</li> </ul>
<li>To begin the leeks, clean and cut into 3cm lengths.</li>
<li>Place the leeks into a medium pot of boiling salted water and cook until softened.</li>
<li> Once softened, drain, and fire up the grill to a high heat.</li>
<li>Transfer the leeks into a shallow, ovenproof dish in a single layer. Try not to overlap the lengths.</li>
<li>Glaze with softened butter and liberally grate the Hafod cheddar over the top. Finish with a hefty crack of black pepper.</li>
<li> Put the dish underneath the grill until caramelised and bubbling.</li>
<li> Serve immediately.</li>
<header> <h1> Letters: Apocalyptic Covid projections have harmed the public’s faith in science </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 26 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – I work in a radiation-protection capacity, and part of my role involves providing reassurance to employees and the public based upon the scientific facts.</p>
<p>Dr Gordon McCabeBournemouth, Dorset</p>
<p>SIR – According to the Covid Tracking Project, the highest number of daily Covid deaths in the United States this year was just over 2,000 in April.</p>
<p>We have now seen a lot of exaggerated modelling from Professor Ferguson and his team. Why is the Government still listening to them?</p>
<p>Richard DaviesBrentwood, Essex</p>
<p>SIR – I am the musical director for a pantomime at the Kenneth More Theatre in Ilford.</p>
<p>Some businesses can go online to survive – but we can’t. The same applies in many other sectors: pubs, restaurants and the travel industry, to name but a few.</p>
<p>We need another approach to dealing with new variants.</p>
<p>Mr Zahawi may therefore hope, but I don’t think he can expect.</p>
<p>David S AinsworthManchester</p>
<p>SIR – Geraldine Wills <a>(Letters, December 20)</a> is understandably concerned about being deprived of her effective oil boiler.</p>
<p>They will then be expected to dig up their gardens and install expensive and ineffective ground-source heat pumps, along with all the new radiators and insulation that will be required, at a likely cost of at least £20,000.</p>
<p>Taken alongside the attacks on livestock farming in particular, and the eco-lunatic policy of rewilding 30 per cent of agricultural land, it would appear this is all part of Downing Street’s hostility to rural Britain.</p>
<p>Adrian GobbiBedale, North Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – According to the National Grid, our average electricity demand last week was 34.8 GW .</p>
<p>Some 55.3 per cent was supplied by gas generation, and 7.7 per cent by renewable solar and wind energy.</p>
<p>Is the Government’s future energy policy sustainable when it is not unusual to experience freezing fog on the coldest days of December?</p>
<p>Colin SeymourSkegness, Lincolnshire</p>
<p>SIR – I disagree with Graham Lomas <a>(Letters, December 19)</a>, who argues that traditional performances of Handel’s Messiah are superior.</p>
<p>As with a Mozart or Verdi opera, it’s all about the music.</p>
<p>Michael KeeneWinchester, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – I am fortunate enough to live in an old rectory. Not infrequently I receive letters addressed to me at “The Old Wreck Tree” <a>(“Pointed misprint”, Letters, December 19)</a>.</p>
<p>Rupert JohnsonWantage, Oxfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – Some years ago, the director of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, the Regius Keeper, received a letter from abroad addressed to “The Religeos Kipper”.</p>
<p>SIR – When I was on holiday in Spain many years ago, a porter with a board saying “Message for Señor Firehose” came walking through the foyer.</p>
<p>We took no notice until it became clear that it was for one of our party – whose surname is Fairhurst. He is still known by the Spanish version.</p>
<p>Patrick WhiteLondon SW20</p>
<p>SIR – My mother told us that she was at school with a boy called Stan Still.</p>
<p>Linda MoffatStudley, Warwickshire</p>
<p>SIR – A few years ago, a friend of mine called Andy Banks married an American girl.</p>
<p>Dave SiswickHebden Bridge, West Yorkshire</p>
<a>letter on HS2 (December 19)</a>, it is ironic that there has been a furore in the North East over the cancellation of the Leeds link, which local people wanted to go ahead, whereas in the South they want the whole HS2 project cancelled.
<p>Simon Bathurst BrownCamberley, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – I read plenty about Northern Powerhouse Rail and HS2 but precious little about joining up our railway line along the South Coast.</p>
<p>It still isn’t possible to take a direct train from Plymouth to Southampton; to make such a journey one has to travel 50 miles inland via Westbury.</p>
<p>A cheap and quick win would be to join up the tracks at Dorchester and at Yeovil to enable proper east-to-west travel. Is anyone in Westminster listening to the West Country?</p>
<p>Christopher WoodPlymouth, Devon</p>
<p>SIR – As a child in the 1950s I used to get sixpence a week in pocket money. I had an Ovaltine tin, and my brother made a slit in the lid, then soldered the lid on for me, so I wasn’t tempted to fritter the money away.</p>
<p>Susan LaphamPenzance, Cornwall</p>
<p>SIR – Brian Christley<a> (Letters, December 19)</a> says that saving cash enables children to learn the value of money, and that the process “cannot be replicated in a cashless world”.</p>
<p>Richard WoodsDover, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – Confusion reigns in the kitchen at the best of times, but when appliances start bleeping, it is hard to tell which is which. Why can’t we select from a range of sounds, as we do with phones?</p>
<p>Robert WardLoughborough, Leicestershire</p>
<h2>Cyclists riding roughshod over other road users</h2>
<p>SIR – I respect <a>cyclists’ </a>right to safety on public highways, and accept that their cycling in the centre of a lane is often in order.</p>
<p>SIR – Cyclists should perhaps remember that the original purpose of roads was to facilitate getting from A to B for business, social and domestic purposes, rather than to enable middle-aged men in Lycra to pursue their fitness regimes.</p>
<h2>This Government is Conservative in name only</h2>
<p>SIR – Traditional Conservative ideas are based on government doing as little as possible within a framework of sound financial management and freedom of individual choice.</p>
<p>Today, however, we have a Conservative Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, who is closer in thinking to the Labour opposition than he is to his own MPs and wider party.</p>
<p>He has introduced higher taxes and proposed more state intervention, with coercive measures to limit personal freedoms in the guise of Covid restrictions.</p>
<p>If there is no change of direction there will be no chance to recover voters’ support.</p>
<p>David SaundersSidmouth, Devon</p>
<p>SIR – I hope that Mary Moore <a>(Letters, December 19)</a> does not leave the Conservative Party over certain MPs’ recent criticism of Professor Chris Whitty.</p>
<p>The party needs a strong membership made up of people who are able to argue cogently from a position of informed opinion.</p>
<p>J Alan SmithEpping, Essex</p>
<header> <h1> Letters: Experienced volunteers are being rejected for vital vaccination work </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 27 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – The Oxon, Berks and Bucks health trust has decided that only trained nurses can give vaccinations. So my daughter, who vaccinated for three months during the main programme, is not now qualified to give the booster injection.</p>
<p>Presumably the nurses who are used leave vital work to take the place of my daughter and other volunteers.</p>
<p>My daughter frequently receives texts urging her to come back, but when she replies is told (again) that she is no longer qualified, not being a nurse. She works as an occupational therapist, licensed by the NHS.</p>
<p>It is the general public who are disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Sheila EllisonThatcham, Berkshire</p>
<p>SIR – I absolutely hate Christmas. I would have been much, much, happier being in our local vaccination venue over these Christmas holidays giving jabs to those who need boosters.</p>
<p>I was willing to do it for nothing. Unfortunately, even though I am a practising GP with more than 40 years’ experience, I was told I could not do so because I “haven’t been trained”.</p>
<p>So I had to stay at home with a bad head and indigestion instead.</p>
<p>Dr David JenkinsLocum GPFerryside, Carmarthenshire</p>
<p>SIR – How frustrating to see some retired nurses unable to re-register to act as vaccinators because of the arbitrary cut-off date enforced by the Royal College of Nursing.</p>
<p>Patricia ReesWeyhill, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – My vulnerable partner was admitted to hospital for a non-Covid related issue shortly before her booster was due. However, the hospital could not vaccinate her because, I was told, they are not licensed to do so.</p>
<p>This major shortcoming in provision seems at odds with government policy.</p>
<p>Martin LeechWindlesham, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – With the prospect of further Covid vaccinations, it is time to set up a Vaccination Service, in some ways like the Blood Transfusion Service.</p>
<p>This would ensure proficient staff to administer an increasing range of vaccines and remove the need continually to deflect frontline health workers, including GPs and pharmacists, from their principal roles.</p>
<p>SIR – I, too, am the treasurer of a parochial church council (Letters, December 24). I am also a retired licensing agent.</p>
<p>Peter WeaverHeathfield, East Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – PCCs can avoid paying extortionate licence fees for live performances of so-called “restarted” copyright hymns and carols by inviting a musically qualified parishioner to re-draft an out-of-copyright original.</p>
<p>Keith MunghamPotto, North Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – Hong Kong University has removed <a>a sculpture commemorating the victims of the Tiananmen Square massacre</a> to accord with mainland China’s authorised version of history.</p>
<p>Here in Britain we remove statues that may “cause offence” to modern values. There doesn’t seem much difference to me.</p>
<p>Bob VassBollington, Cheshire</p>
<p>SIR – After you published my letter (<a>December 23</a>) about having had no post for 10 days, the postman delivered 21 Christmas cards in one morning.</p>
<p>Brian HallingStratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire</p>
<p>SIR – In the village of Ceres in Fife an anonymous villager has knitted this lovely <a>topper for the post box</a>. What joy it brings.</p>
<h2>The Prince’s hole truth</h2>
<p>SIR – I gazed with astonishment at the holed knee in the<a> jeans worn by Prince Harry</a>, Duke of Sussex.</p>
<p>He is to be heartily supported in reaching out to others in this way. We wish him seasonal greetings and a happy new year.</p>
<p>Barry BondLeigh-on-Sea, Essex</p>
<p>The couple listed a number of charities they support but the general rule of life is: the person in the room boasting about giving gives the least.</p>
<p>T B CockroftRotherwick, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – Why do the media keep referring to the Duchess of Cambridge as Kate Middleton? After 10 years of marriage it is time for people to recognise that Middleton was her maiden name.</p>
<p>Paul SlaughterAlsager, Cheshire</p>
<h2>An MP for the Falklands</h2>
<p>By offering such closeness to the British Overseas Territories we would, for once, be following a good precedent set by the French.</p>
<p>SIR – The British Overseas Territories should be treasured: they are truly British and loyal to the Crown.</p>
<p>Rene SchurtenbergerSeer Green, Buckinghamshire</p>
<p>SIR – I wish rail workers could think of a more constructive way of settling grievances than by screwing up Christmas for many, once again.</p>
<p>Martin MoyesHolt, Wiltshire</p>
<h2>On Today: they’re off!</h2>
<p>SIR – Moving from the Broadcasting House newsroom to Today in May 1978, as assistant editor, I started the Today racing tips a couple of months later despite the editor’s view that I would never get it past the BBC hierarchy.</p>
<p>Alan AshtonBishop’s Stortford, Hertfordshire</p>
<h2>Noel Coward’s last word on playing the Virgin</h2>
<p>SIR – Lady Diana Cooper may have put Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, in her place (<a>Letters, December 22</a>), but she met her match in Noel Coward.</p>
<p>Following her great success in London and New York as the Madonna in Karl Vollmöller’s play, The Miracle, she met Coward at a party and said: “Noel, I saw your new play last week and I yawned, and I yawned, and I yawned!”</p>
<p>Coward replied with the perfect put-down: “Diana Darling, last year I saw you playing the Virgin and I laughed, and I laughed, and I laughed!”</p>
<p>John Bromley-DavenportMalpas, Cheshire</p>
<h2>The tables turned in those old school reports</h2>
<p>SIR – My English teacher wrote in my report (<a>Letters, December 24</a>): “Mark must realise that not everything in life is amusing, and failure certainly isn’t.”</p>
<p>He left teaching shortly afterwards, which amused me.</p>
<p>Mark RobbinsBruton, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – The report from my chemistry teacher after my first term was: “Friendly, but futile.”</p>
<p>SIR – My school report when I was about six went: “Tries very hard for a very short time.”</p>
<p>Nanny laughed; my mother was not amused.</p>
<p>Lady GageBrackley, Northamptonshire</p>
<p>SIR – “Agius has shaky fundamentals,” wrote my maths teacher. I’m not sure I ever quite recovered from this.</p>
<p>Marcus AgiusExbury, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – My housemaster gave rather brief end-of-term reports. One read “Unexpected talent with a hula hoop.” This was followed shortly afterwards by: “Rather a dark horse.”</p>
<p>Michael Wyldbore-SmithPreston on Stour, Warwickshire</p>
