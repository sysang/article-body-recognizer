<p>Some of the several blazes in the area Thursday were sparked by downed power lines. </p>
<p>Six people who were injured in the fires were being treated at UCHealth Broomfield Hospital, spokesperson Kelli Christensen said. A nearby portion of U.S. Highway 36 also was shut down.</p>
<p>One video captured by a bystander outside a Superior Costco store showed an apocalyptic scene with winds whipping through barren trees in the parking lot surrounded by gray skies, a hazy sun and small fires scattered across the ground.</p>
<p>“The wind rocked the bus so hard that I thought the bus would tip,” she wrote in a message to The Associated Press. </p>
<p>“The sky was dark, dark brown, and the dirt was blowing in swirls across the sidewalk like snakes,” she said.</p>
<p>Angstman later ended up evacuating, getting in a car with her husband and driving northeast without knowing where they would end up. </p>
<p>The fires prompted Gov. Jared Polis to declare a state of a emergency, allowing the state to access disaster emergency funds.</p>
<p>The evacuations come as climate change is making weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive, scientists say. A <a>historic drought</a> and heat waves have made wildfires harder to fight in the U.S. West.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of Boulder County is in severe or extreme drought, and hasn’t seen substantial rainfall since mid-summer.</p>
<p>“With any snow on the ground, this absolutely would not have happened in the way that it did,” said snow hydrologist Keith Musselman, who was at home when the fire broke out not far away.</p>
<p>Musselman said this severe fire risk can be expected in September and October following a dry summer, but the lack of any precipitation – snow or rain – this late in the season is highly unusual.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service predicts up to a foot of snow could fall tomorrow in Boulder, and that moisture would bring substantial relief, Musselman said.</p>

<p>At least seven people were injured, but remarkably there were no immediate reports of any deaths or anyone missing in the aftermath of the blaze outside Denver.</p>
<p>Cathy Glaab found that her home in the town of Superior where she lives with her husband had been turned into a pile of charred and twisted debris. It was one of seven houses in a row that burned to the ground.</p>
<p>“The mailbox is standing,” Glaab said, trying to crack a smile through tears. She added sadly, “So many memories.”</p>
<p>Despite the devastation, she said they intend to rebuild the house they had since 1998. They love that the land backs up to a natural space, and they have a view of the mountains from the back.</p>
<p>“We thought we lost everything,” he said, as he held his mother-in-law’s china in padded containers. They also retrieved sculptures that belonged to Dixon’s father and piles of clothes still on hangers. </p>
<p>The wildfire erupted Thursday in and around Louisville and Superior, neighboring towns about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Denver with a combined population of 34,000.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands were ordered to flee as the flames swept over drought-stricken neighborhoods with alarming speed, propelled by guests up to 105 mph (169 kph).</p>
<p>At a Costco in Superior, two store employees came running toward the checkout lines, one of them shouting, “Everyone evacuate, evacuate, evacuate!” said Katrina Peterson, who was inside.</p>
<p>A video she made showed dark skies and whirling debris outside. The falling ash filled her ears, and she had to squint to keep it from getting in her eyes. The store was left standing.</p>
<p>The cause of the blaze was under investigation. Emergency authorities said utility officials found no downed power lines around where the fire broke out.</p>
<p>He had watched from the hillside as the neighborhood burned.</p>
<p>“We might have our very own New Year’s miracle on our hands if it holds up that there was no loss of life,” Gov. Jared Polis said, noting that many people had just minutes to evacuate.</p>
<p>The wildfire broke out unusually late in the year, following an extremely dry fall and amid a winter nearly devoid of snow so far.</p>
<p>Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle said more than 500 homes were probably destroyed. He and the governor said as many as 1,000 homes might have been lost, though that won’t be known until crews can assess the damage.</p>
<p>“It’s unbelievable when you look at the devastation that we don’t have a list of 100 missing persons,” the sheriff said.</p>
<p>The sheriff said some communities were reduced to just “smoking holes in the ground.” He urged residents to wait for the all-clear to go back because of the danger of fire and fallen power lines.</p>
<p>“The good news is I think our house may be OK,” Owens said.</p>
<p>But from now on, she said, she plans to have a bag packed in case of another fire.</p>
<p>“I never thought a brush fire could cause this kind of destruction,” Owens said. “I want to stay here. No matter where you live, there are always going to be natural disasters.”</p>
<p>Superior and Louisville are filled with middle- and upper-middle-class subdivisions with shopping centers, parks and schools. The area is between Denver and Boulder, home to the University of Colorado.</p>
<p>Scientists say climate change is making weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.</p>
<p>Bruce and Mary Janda faced the loss of their Louisville home of 25 years in person Friday after learning it had been destroyed through a neighbor’s photos.</p>
<div><div><h1>Officials: Nearly 1K structures destroyed in Colorado fire</h1></div><div>By BRITTANY PETERSON and EUGENE GARCIAJanuary 2, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle also said Saturday that investigators are still trying to find the cause of the wind-whipped blaze that erupted Thursday and blackened entire neighborhoods in the area located between Denver and Boulder. </p>
<p>Pelle said utility officials found no downed power lines around where the fire broke out. He said authorities were pursuing a number of tips and had executed a search warrant at “one particular location.” He declined to give details.</p>
<p>The totals given by Pelle include destroyed barns, outbuildings and other structures, but the vast majority were homes, Boulder County spokesperson Jennifer Churchill said late Saturday.</p>
<p>Officials had previously estimated that at least 500 homes — and possibly 1,000 — were destroyed in the fire, which by Friday was no longer a threat. Residents have slowly started returning to see the scale of the devastation.</p>
<p>Authorities had said earlier no one was missing. But Churchill said that was due to confusion inherent when agencies are scrambling to manage an emergency.</p>
<p>At least 991 homes and other buildings were destroyed, Pelle said: 553 in Louisville, 332 in Superior and 106 in unincorporated parts of the county. Pelle cautioned that the tally was not final.</p>
<p>The snow and temperatures in the single digits cast an eerie scene amid still-smoldering remains of homes. Despite the shocking change in weather, the smell of smoke still permeated empty streets blocked off by National Guard troops in Humvees. </p>
<p>The conditions compounded the misery of residents who started off the new year trying to salvage what remained of their homes.</p>
<p>Families filled a long line of cars waiting to pick up space heaters and bottled water at a Salvation Army distribution center at the YMCA in Lafayette, just north of Superior. </p>

<p>Monarch High School seniors Noah Sarasin and his twin brother Gavin had been volunteering at that location for two days, directing traffic and distributing donations.</p>
<p>“We have a house, no heat but we still have a house,” Noah Sarasin said. “I just want to make sure that everyone else has heat on this very cold day.”</p>
<p>Both teared up when a man entered the shop and joked aloud that he’d lost his coffee mugs — and everything else — in the fire. The man was in good spirits, laughing at the irony of the situation.</p>
<p>“I have a space heater and a house to put it in. I don’t even know what to say to them,” Hilary said, wiping away a tear.</p>
<p>Superior resident Jeff Markley arrived in his truck to pick up a heater. He said he felt lucky to be “just displaced” since his home is intact. </p>
<p>“We’re making do, staying with friends, and upbeat for the new year. Gotta be better than this last one,” Markley said.</p>
<p>Not everyone felt as positive.</p>
<p>Dozens trudged through the snow to determine the condition of their homes and take belongings.</p>
<p>Viliam Klein bent over in grief when he saw the ruins of his 100-year-old home in Superior for the first time Saturday. Smoke rose through the snow-covered ashes; a few neighbors walked past, carrying what they could from their own destroyed homes.</p>
<p>“At this point I’m just honestly overwhelmed and I can’t feel much anymore,” Klein said. He sifted pieces of ash with his hands; wisps of smoke rose from his glove-covered palms. He surveyed what remained of the neighborhood.</p>
<p>“It didn’t snow all winter of 2021. No wonder this all went up like kindling,” Klein said.</p>
<div><div><h1>Democrat-led New Mexico delves into political redistricting</h1></div><div>By MORGAN LEEDecember 7, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) — Efforts to draw new political maps in New Mexico began in earnest Monday as a Democrat-led Legislature convened a special legislative session on redistricting.</p>
<p>Map recommendations have been provided to legislators by a citizens’ advisory panel under a hybrid redistricting system. Legislators can adopt, modify or discard the suggested maps and start from scratch.</p>
<p>“If they really want to be taken seriously by this body, they should tell us where the money came from ... and how it was spent,” Moores said.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Center for Civil Policy defended its reimbursements for travel and child care for people who attended the hearing to state their views as expenses that were “common and acceptable.”</p>
<p>Separately, Sen. Jacob Candelaria of Albuquerque condemned an unpublished state Senate map from Democratic colleagues that he claims would dilute the influence of Latino voters in Albuquerque’s working class West Side.</p>
<p>“You would strip representation from people that I represent, many of whom are Hispanic, simply because it benefits you at the ballot box,” Candelaria said.</p>
<p>New Mexico presents unusual challenges in efforts to comply with the U.S. Voting Rights Act and preserve communities of interest and give minority voters a fair shot to elect candidates of their choice.</p>
<p>Boundaries are likely to change significantly for a congressional swing district in southern New Mexico that flipped to Republican control in 2020, amid population growth in a major oil-production region.</p>
<p>Those changes have national implications. Republicans need a net gain of just five seats to take control of the U.S. House and effectively freeze President Joe Biden’s agenda on climate change, the economy and other issues.</p>
<p>Democrats currently hold two congressional seats out of three for New Mexico.</p>
<p>The special session also is open to proposals for spending roughly $1.1 billion in federal pandemic relief.</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court ruled in November that those relief funds must be appropriated by the Legislature and not just the governor.</p>
<div><div><h1>New York City poised to give voting rights to noncitizens</h1></div><div>By BOBBY CAINA CALVANDecember 7, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — New York City, long a beacon for immigrants, is on the cusp of becoming the largest places in the country to give noncitizens the right to vote in local elections.</p>
<p>Noncitizens still wouldn’t be able to vote for president or members of Congress in federal races, or in the state elections that pick the governor, judges and legislators.</p>
<p>The law would give an electoral voice to the many New Yorkers who love the city and have made it their permanent home, but can’t easily become U.S. citizens or would rather remain citizens of their home nations for various reasons.</p>
<p>It would also cover “Dreamers” like Eva Santos, 32, who was brought to the U.S. by her parents at age 11 as an unauthorized immigrant, but wasn’t able to vote like her friends or go to college when she turned 18.</p>
<p>“It was really hard for me to see how my other friends were able to make decisions for their future, and I couldn’t,” said Santos, now a community organizer.</p>
<p>More than a dozen communities across the United States currently allow noncitizens to vote, including 11 towns in Maryland and two in Vermont.</p>
<p>The move in Democrat-controlled New York City is a counterpoint to restrictions being enacted in some states, where Republicans have espoused unsupported claims of rampant fraud by noncitizens in federal elections.</p>
<p>“This is about whether we are living in New York City, we are contributing to New York City and paying taxes in New York City,” said Rodriguez, a Democrat.</p>
<p>“Look, there’s obviously an argument: We want people involved, we want to hear people’s voices,” de Blasio recently said on the television news program “Inside City Hall.”</p>
<p>“I still have a concern about it. Citizenship has an extraordinary value. People work so hard for it,” he said. “We need people in every good way to want to be citizens.”</p>
<p>The minority leader of the City Council, Joseph Borelli, a Republican from Staten Island, said the measure will undoubtedly end up in court.</p>
<p>“It devalues citizenship, and citizenship is the standard by which the state constitution issues or allows for suffrage in New York state elections at all levels,” Borelli said.</p>
<p>Giving nonresidents the right to vote could empower them to become a political force that can’t be easily ignored, said Anu Joshi, the vice president of policy of the New York Immigration Coalition.</p>
<p>The answer should be a “resounding yes,” he said.</p>
<div><div><h1>State House, Senate districts OK’d in South Carolina</h1></div><div>December 8, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina state senators approved new districts for the Senate and House Tuesday, but legal challenges are almost certain before filing begins in March for the 2022 elections.</p>
<p>The Senate voted 41-2 in favor of its lines, and the House approved its own districts on a 96-14 vote last week. Each chamber typically doesn’t alter the plans of the other chamber when they approve the plan.</p>
<p>The new maps didn’t make wholesale changes in the districts drawn a decade ago. But some changes were inevitable after South Carolina added nearly 500,000 people in the 2020 U.S. Census while still having 24 of its 46 counties lose population.</p>
<p>“Lots of people to shift around,” Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Luke Rankin said.</p>
<p>Both the House and Senate maps have to be signed by Gov. Henry McMaster, but the Republican governor is almost certain to approve the work of the GOP-dominated General Assembly.</p>
<p>Leaders in both the House and Senate said they tried to change the 2020 maps as little as possible from the 2010 maps which did get federal approval.</p>
<p>Larger changes had to be made in the 124 House districts. Three districts were moved to different fast-growing locations. Five pairs of incumbents – three sets of Democrats and two sets of Republicans – were put together.</p>
<p>The new House map cuts the number of general election races where the winning margin is projected to be within 5 percentage points almost in half to just nine districts, said Lynn Teague, vice president for the South Carolina League of Women Voters.</p>
<p>“This lack of competition is a very serious threat to representative democracy. General election votes become meaningless because the outcome is certain, or nearly so,” Teague said.</p>
<p>“Democrats: Be happy. Republicans: Don’t be greedy. This is a good plan,” said Rankin, a Republican from Myrtle Beach.</p>
<p>“On the whole, the Senate hasn’t moved us backward and has done its work with consideration for what they heard from citizens across the state,” Teague said.</p>

<p>“The United States has a thriving democracy, but it’s been hurting in recent years,” said Michael Abramowitz, the president of Freedom House, whose annual report marked a 15th consecutive year of a global democratic slide.</p>

<p>“The bottom line is this was a transparent, fair process,” said Sen. Craig Zucker, a Montgomery County Democrat, just before the Senate overrode the veto.</p>

<p>“This is not the end of the process,” Hogan said, before signing the veto at a desk. “This is just the beginning. The courts will be the final arbiter, not the partisan legislature. These maps cannot and will not stand.”</p>

<div><div><h1>NYC lawmakers pass bill giving noncitizens right to vote</h1></div><div>By BOBBY CAINA CALVANDecember 9, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Only a potential veto from Mayor Bill de Blasio stood in the way of the measure becoming law, but the Democrat has said he would not veto it. It’s unclear whether the bill might face legal challenges.</p>
<p>The Council’s vote was a historic moment for an effort that had long languished.</p>
<p>Councilman Francisco Moya, whose family hails from Ecuador, choked up as he spoke in support of the bill.</p>
<p>“This is for my beautiful mother who will be able to vote for her son,” said Moya, while joining the session by video with his immigrant mother at his side.</p>
<p>Noncitizens still wouldn’t be able to vote for president or members of Congress in federal races, or in the state elections that pick the governor, judges and legislators.</p>
<p>The city’s move could enflame the national debate over voting rights, particularly among some who wrongly assert that rampant fraud by noncitizens has taken place in federal elections.</p>
<p>Last year, Alabama, Colorado and Florida adopted rules that would preempt any attempts to pass laws like the one in New York City. Arizona and North Dakota already had prohibitions on the books.</p>
<p>Even if de Blasio were to decide to veto the bill, there was enough support to override it. The measure would become law by default if the mayor decides not to act on it. Incoming mayor Eric Adams has said he supports the bill.</p>
<p>City Councilman Joseph Borelli, the Republican leader, said a legal challenge is likely. Opponents say the council lacks the authority on its own to grant voting rights to noncitizens and should have first sought action by state lawmakers.</p>

<p>A Senate redistricting bill from Democratic state Sen. Linda Lopez of Albuquerque cleared its first hurdle with a 6-3 committee endorsement. A second committee review for the bill is scheduled before a possible Senate floor vote.</p>

<p>In three of the districts, Native Americans would account for at least 62% of the voting-age population. </p>
<p>Two additional districts would be roughly 35% Native American each, ensuring significant influence in elections. </p>
<p>“I hope that wasn’t intentional or partisan in nature,” said Republican Senate minority leader Greg Baca of Belen, who could be paired against GOP Sen. Joseph Sanchez in future elections in the the proposal.</p>
<p>Baca and Republican colleagues lamented that none of the maps recommended by a citizens advisory board have been translated directly into proposed legislation. </p>
<p>New Mexico adopted an advisory board to vet maps proposals at public meetings. State lawmakers have the final say in a hybrid approach designed to temper political inclinations.</p>
<p>“We empowered a body to produce maps, and we have yet to see any one of those maps,” Baca said.</p>
<p>The proposed Senate political map also pairs two incumbent Democrats in a single Albuquerque-based district.</p>
<p>Separately Thursday, two Native American communities voiced opposition to a congressional redistricting plan that would extend the state’s traditionally Democratic northern 3rd District into a conservative oil-producing region of the state.</p>
<p>Lobbyist Conroy Chino, representing the Indigenous communities of Taos Pueblo and Acoma Pueblo, said that the Democratic-backed redistricting proposal would have a negative influence on political representation for the two tribes.</p>
<p>Despite the criticism, the congressional redistricting bill from Democratic Sen. Joseph Cervantes and Rep. Georgene Louis advanced Thursday toward a Senate floor vote, with a 6-3 endorsement by the judiciary committee.</p>
<p>Chino also noted a close relationship between Taos and Acoma pueblos and Leger Fernandez, a first term congresswoman an attorney with lengthy experience on Indigenous issues and projects.</p>
<p>The plan would also bolster a Hispanic majority in New Mexico’s southern 2nd Congressional District by extending its boundaries into Albuquerque.</p>

<p>Former NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the summit was a good “starting point” for a “year of action.”</p>

<p>But his first year in office has been a period that he says has been marked by a “backward slide” for democracy around the globe. </p>
<p>The summit was held as the Biden administration has been pressing Russia’s Vladimir Putin to step back after a massive buildup of troops on the Ukraine border that has created growing concern in Washington and European capitals.</p>
<p>Biden earlier this week said he warned Putin of “severe consequences” if Russia invaded.</p>
<p>White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the invitations were not mean to be intended as a “stamp of approval” and the administration was seeking a “diverse range of voices and faces and representatives at the discussion.”</p>
<p>“What’s true around the world is also true in the United States,” Biden said. “The sacred right to vote, to vote freely, the right to have your vote counted is the threshold liberty for democracy.”</p>

<p>Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos accused Evers of being a hypocrite for abandoning maps that had been created following a series of hearings around the state and public comment in favor of ones drawn in secret.</p>
<p>Democrats are also pursuing a federal lawsuit and last week the U.S. Supreme Court <a>rejected a lawsuit</a> by Republican lawmakers attempting to end it. The federal court has deferred taking action until the state Supreme Court case is concluded. </p>
<p>Republicans have a 61-38 majority in the Assembly and 21-12 majority in the Senate. They also hold five of eight congressional seats.</p>
<p>Evers also said his maps create more competitive districts than the ones approved by the Legislature.</p>
<div><div><h1>Proposed Virginia maps scale back majority Black districts </h1></div><div>By MATTHEW BARAKATDecember 15, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>FALLS CHURCH, Va. (AP) — Proposed redistricting maps under consideration by the Virginia Supreme Court would constitute a significant reduction in the number of majority Black districts in the General Assembly.</p>
<p>But the maps submitted to the court create a much higher number of majority-minority districts, those in which Blacks, Hispanics and Asians combined represent more than 50% of the population in a given district.</p>
<p>They said they were concerned that the maps would be subject to a legal challenge if they drew them with racial considerations in mind, so they drew them without regard to race and then evaluated the racial composition after the fact.</p>
<p>The special master who oversaw the redrawn maps in 2018 was Grofman.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Joe Manchin settled in at President Joe Biden’s family home in Delaware on a Sunday morning in the fall as the Democrats worked furiously to gain his support on their far-reaching domestic package.</p>
<p>The two-hour-long session was the kind of special treatment being showered on the West Virginia senator — the president at one point even showing Manchin around his Wilmington home.</p>
<p>But months later, despite Democrats slashing Biden’s big bill in half and meeting the senator’s other demands, Manchin is no closer to voting yes. </p>
<p>In an extraordinary display of political power in the evenly split 50-50 Senate, a single senator is about to seriously set back an entire presidential agenda.</p>
<p>“We’re frustrated and disappointed,” said Sen. Dick Durbin, the majority whip. “Very frustrated,” said another Democratic senator granted anonymity to frankly discuss the situation Thursday.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Images of chaos: AP photographers capture US Capitol riot</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We have to be there': AP photographer recalls Capitol siege</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Biden said in a statement Thursday night that he still believed “we will bridge our differences and advance the Build Back Better plan, even in the face of fierce Republican opposition.”</p>
<a>passage of the president’s signature “Build Back Better Act,”</a> as well as Democrats’ high-priority voting rights package, would most likely have to be delayed to next year.
<p>Failing to deliver on <a>Biden’s roughly $2 trillion social and environmental bill </a> would be a stunning end to the president’s first year in office. </p>
<p>The White House has insisted Manchin is dealing with the administration in “good faith,” according to deputy White House press secretary Andrew Bates. </p>
<p>Manchin, though, has emerged as an uneven negotiator — bending norms and straining relationships because he says one thing one day and another the next, adjusting his positions, demands and rationale along the way. </p>
<p>Democratic senators have grown weary of their colleague, whose vote they cannot live without — but whose regular chats with Republican leader Mitch McConnell leave them concerned he could switch parties and take away their slim hold on power. </p>
<p>“I got nothing — n-o-t-h-i-n-g,” he drawled to the reporters waiting outside the Democrats’ closed door lunchroom Thursday as it became clear there would be no Christmas deal.</p>
<p>So far, Manchin has gotten much of what he wanted: Biden halved what had been a $3.5 trillion proposal to $1.75 trillion, once Manchin gave his nod to that figure. </p>
<p>Manchin insisted the corporate tax rate Biden proposed raising to 28% would not inch past 25% — in fact, it ended up not being raised at all, thanks to opposition from another hold-out Democrat, Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. </p>
<p>But what Manchin actually does want is much more unclear. And it all raises the question of whether Manchin even wants Congress to pass any “Build Back Better Act” at all. </p>
<p>For progressives, the stalemate Manchin engineered was exactly what lawmakers have feared after Congress signed off on a companion $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill rather than force the two bills to move together to Biden’s desk.</p>
<p>Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who helmed Biden’s latest compromise version to House passage, downplayed the Manchin negotiations as part of the process. “This is legislating,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s a non-starter — the price of a decade-long child tax cut would consume the bulk of Biden’s bill. </p>
<p>All this while Democrats also need support from Manchin, and Sinema, for Senate rules changes so they can overcome the <a>60-vote threshold needed to overcome a Republican filibuster </a> to pass voting rights.</p>
<p>Manchin met with McConnell on Thursday, as they often do.</p>

<p>Biden’s statement was a much-needed intervention, allowing Senate Democrats an off-ramp to what has been months of tangled negotiations that appear nowhere near resolved as time runs out ahead of the Christmas holiday. </p>

<p>The Treasury Department says the expanded tax credit has helped the families of 61 million children. </p>

<div><div><h1>Tribes prevail as redistricting plans advance in New Mexico</h1></div><div>By MORGAN LEEDecember 17, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Democratic state Sen. Shannon Pinto, a Navajo Nation member from Tohatchi, described her vote for the bill as a gesture of appreciation for sovereign tribal nations and the state Legislature.</p>
<p>Native American communities account for about 12% of residents in New Mexico. Tribal leaders are seeking to bolster political influence amid frustration with public education, basic infrastructure and economic opportunities.</p>
<p>The Senate-approved bill would shore up Native American voting-age majorities in three Senate districts and ensure robust minority Indigenous voting blocs in two other districts. The state Senate has 42 seats.</p>
<p>Tribal leaders say their communities negotiated painstakingly to arrive at a consensus proposal for the heavily Indigenous northwest of the state.</p>
<p>Elements of that consensus plan would leave Republican state Sen. Joshua Sanchez of Bosque outside the boundaries of his current district, to compete in a neighboring district against Senate minority leader Gregory Baca of Belen.</p>
<p>New Mexico presents unusual challenges in efforts to comply with the U.S. Voting Rights Act and preserve communities of interest and give minority voters a fair shot to elect candidates of their choice.</p>
<p>Nearly half of New Mexico residents claim Hispanic ancestry — the largest share of any state. The state also includes 23 federal recognized tribes.</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Linda Lopez of Albuquerque, sponsor of the Senate redistricting bill, said she believed the 2020 census provided a “serious undercount” of remote tribal populations in the northwest of the state.</p>
<p>She also acknowledged that the redistricting process was inherently political, in New Mexico and statehouses across the country.</p>

<div><div><h1>Abrams seeks national voting rights action before 2022 race</h1></div><div>By JEFF AMYDecember 20, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>DECATUR, Ga. (AP) — Stacey Abrams, who built her national reputation by advocating for voting rights, is calling on Congress to take action on federal voting rules as the Democrat launches a second bid to become Georgia’s governor.</p>
<p>Senators including Georgia Democrat Raphael Warnock, Abrams’ close ally, have been arguing in recent days that the Senate must try again on federal voting standards, despite earlier setbacks.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>In Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>This year, Republicans pushed through a new voting law in Georgia which, among other things, cuts days for requesting an absentee ballot, shortens early voting before runoff elections and limits drop boxes.</p>
<a>won the state’s 16 electoral votes</a> and then Warnock and fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff won runoffs in January, delivering control of the U.S. Senate to their party.
<p>Abrams insists she can still win election in Georgia next year even if there are no changes to its new law.</p>
<p>“I will do everything in my power to make certain that these new onerous voter suppression laws do not effectively block voters from their right to vote,” she said. “And so yes, there’s absolutely a pathway to win.”</p>
<p>Abrams said that pathway leads in a different direction than the traditional approach to policy taken by Southern Republicans, instead seeking to improve the prospects of those who don’t get a fair shot today.</p>
<p>In a lacerating attack on Kemp, Abrams argued he failed to recognize the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and has been callous in his refusal to expand the Medicaid health insurance program to poor adults.</p>
<p>Kemp maintains he’s struck the right balance between health and the economy during the pandemic. He noted that he avoided unpopular lockdowns and that Georgia has a record-low unemployment rate right now.</p>
<p>“I don’t really know what it is, and I’m someone who’s paid very close attention to politics,” Abrams said.</p>
<a>turned sour</a> on Biden and Democrats, Abrams believes she can still win. She said that’s in part because Georgia is different, with a population on the cusp of
<a>becoming majority nonwhite</a>, and because her approach is different, with a focus on “one Georgia” where she says “I’m going to talk to every community and I’m going to have plans for every community.”
<p>Republicans, though, maintain that Abrams will never overcome the tide of anti-Democratic sentiment and hope to lure wayward white suburbanites home, as well as pry away some African American, Latino and Asian voters.</p>
<p>Abrams is preaching patience to those communities.</p>
<p>“Winning an election isn’t about magic,” she said. “Voting isn’t magic. It is medicine. It takes time, it takes effort, it takes continued investment.”</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court could clear the way for Georgia to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. Passed in 2019, the law is currently on hold before an appeals court. Abrams called it a “forced pregnancy bill.”</p>

<p>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — New California congressional maps finalized Monday leave the Los Angeles area with one fewer U.S. House seat and set up a handful of highly competitive races for next year’s midterm elections. </p>
<p>Democrats have more registered voters in 43 of the newly drawn districts, according to California Target Book, an organization that analyzes redistricting data. But a registration edge doesn’t always translate to electorate wins.</p>
<a>plans to lead</a> a media organization launched by former President Donald Trump. Like Valadao, Democratic Rep. Josh Harder saw his Modesto-area district sliced almost in half, perhaps creating a more complicated path to re-election.
<p>California is one of 10 states that relies on an independent commission to draw lines, rather than judges or partisan lawmakers, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. </p>
<p>Latinos, who account for 40% of California’s population, will make up a majority of the voting-age population in 16 of the 52 new districts, said Evan McLaughlin, a redistricting expert who works with Democrats. </p>
<p>Other California lawmakers who don’t plan to seek reelection are Democratic Rep. Jackie Speier, who represents the San Francisco Bay Area, and Democratic Rep. Karen Bass, who plans to run for mayor of Los Angeles. </p>
<div><div><h1>Court rules against victims’ rights measure voters supported</h1></div><div>By MARK SCOLFORODecember 21, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The justices ruled 6-1 that the sprawling proposal violated the Pennsylvania Constitution’s requirement that amendments address a single topic to prevent lawmakers from bundling together items that might not pass on their individual merits.</p>
<a>litigation played out</a>. A Commonwealth Court judge previously ordered the Department of State to
<a> refrain from certifying</a> those election results.
<p>Reggie Shuford, executive director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, which represented the voter and state chapter of the League of Women Voters that successfully challenged the referendum, said the Legislature had tried to mislead voters.</p>
<p>“The Legislature attempted to do too much at once, which is prohibited to keep voters from being overwhelmed,” Shuford said. “We are grateful that the court ruled the right way on this important principle.”</p>
<p>The court majority said it “can easily envision a voter supporting one or more of these rights without approving of all of them,” so voters needed to be able to weigh in on them separately.</p>
<div><div><h1>NJ selects new congressional district map drawn by Democrats</h1></div><div>By MIKE CATALINIDecember 22, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — The bipartisan New Jersey commission charged with drawing the boundaries for congressional districts for the next decade voted Wednesday to approve a map put forward by Democrats. </p>
<p>“We did not go in with an extreme gerrymandered partisan Democratic map that we were gonna tweak at the edges,” she said.</p>
<p>Republican commission chairman Doug Steinhardt said he was disappointed with the vote which he said was the “antithesis” of empowering voters. </p>
<p>Another change is the addition of all of GOP-leaning Warren County to the 7th District, which is currently represented by Democrat Tom Malinowski. Malinowski picked up the seat in 2018 for the Democrats, defeating Republican Leonard Lance. </p>
<p>The 5th District, where Democrat Josh Gottheimer unseated a Republican incumbent in 2016, no longer has Warren County towns but added a few in Bergen County, the state’s biggest county where Democrats have performed well recently. </p>
<p>“In the end I decided to vote for the Democratic map simply because the last redistricting map was drawn by Republicans,” he said. </p>
<p>Steinhardt said after the meeting that Wallace amounted to a 7th Democratic member instead of a true independent. </p>
<p>Micah Rasmussen, the director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, said it was hard to ignore the fact that Democrats have such a big registration advantage over Republicans. </p>
<p>The commission wrapped up its work early after holding 10 public hearings, some remotely and some in-person. The state constitution gives New Jersey until Jan. 18 to certify its map. </p>
<div><div><h1>Wisconsin lawsuit seeks reinstatement of 31,000 voters</h1></div><div>By SCOTT BAUERDecember 22, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The League of Women Voters of Wisconsin on Wednesday filed a federal lawsuit seeking to have the Wisconsin Elections Commission reinstate voter registrations for nearly 32,000 people who were deactivated this summer.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit argues that the 31,854 voters should not have had their registrations deactivated because they weren’t given notice that it could happen or a deadline to avoid it.</p>
<p>Riley Vetterkind, a spokesman for the elections commission, declined to comment.</p>
<p>The commission mailed postcards during the summer of 2019 to more than 230,000 voters identified by the Electronic Registration Information Center as having possibly moved. </p>
<p>The <a>state Supreme Court ruled </a> in April that the law applied to local election clerks, not the state commission, and dismissed the lawsuit.</p>
<p>At its June meeting the commission deadlocked on whether to change its 2019 decision to deactivate the voters. Since no change to that earlier decision was approved, the commission moved ahead and deactivated them.</p>
<p>Voters who were removed from the rolls can become eligible to cast ballots again by re-registering. </p>
<p>The League of Women Voters lawsuit filed Wednesday argues that the due process rights of the deactivated voters were violated. </p>
<p>That constitutional right to register to vote can’t be taken away without an appropriate process, Poland said.</p>
<p>“The state failed to follow that process, and so we are going back to court to ensure that the Wisconsin Elections Commission gets the message loud and clear that they must abide by the US Constitution,” Poland said in a statement.</p>

<p>“We have worked too long and too hard to give up now, and we have no intention of doing so,” Rep. Pramila Jayapal, head of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in a statement Wednesday. </p>
<p>Jayapal said she and members of the caucus have expressed the need for the White House to pursue achieving the plan’s goals through a combination of Biden’s executive powers and legislation, instead of legislation alone.</p>

<p>Biden spoke Tuesday about the families who would benefit from the Democrats’ ambitious, if now highly uncertain, plan to pour billions of dollars into child care, health care and other services.</p>
<p>“Senator Manchin and I are going to get something done,” Biden said.</p>
<p>The president’s off-the-cuff remarks were his first public statement since Manchin’s announcement over the weekend that he would not support the bill, as is. </p>
<p>Since then, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told Democrats on a 90-minute video call to expect a vote in January on the package.</p>
<p>Schumer told senators the party was “not giving up” on the proposal, according to a Democrat who was on the private call Tuesday and provided details on condition of anonymity. </p>
<p>But the Democrats face serious questions over whether the initiative can be refashioned to win Manchin’s crucial vote and head off a devastating defeat for the party.</p>
<p>Manchin and his party are so far apart, his relationships so bruised after months of failed talks, it’s unclear how they even get back to the negotiating table, let alone revive the more than 2,100-page bill.</p>
<p>All of that is encouraging to McConnell.</p>
<p>“I want to get things done,” Biden said. “I still think there’s a possibility of getting Build Back Better done.”</p>
<p>Coupled with solid Republican opposition, Manchin’s vote is vital on this and other initiatives, including the Democrats’ priority voting rights legislation that Schumer also said would come to an early vote. </p>
<p>Cecil Roberts, president of the United Mine Workers of America, outlined the ways the package would benefit union members, such as those in West Virginia, the most coal-dependent state in the country.</p>
<p>The next steps remain highly uncertain for the president and his party, with Congress on recess for the holiday break.</p>
<p>The White House appeared to take interest in Manchin’s and the centrist coalition’s preference for a reimagined bill that would do far less but for longer than the bill passed by the House.</p>
<p>But it will be extraordinarily difficult for Democrats to rebuild trust in their ranks for a fresh round of negotiations, having devoted much of Biden’s first year in office to what is now essentially a collapsed effort.</p>
<p>The package was among the biggest of its kind ever considered in Congress, unleashing billions of dollars to help American families nationwide — nearly all paid for with higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. </p>

<div><div><h1>Arizona congressional boundaries shift toward GOP</h1></div><div>By JONATHAN J. COOPERDecember 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>PHOENIX (AP) — Arizona’s independent redistricting commission on Wednesday unanimously approved new boundaries for congressional districts that are likely to shift the state’s congressional delegation in favor of Republicans. </p>
<p>Republican Commissioner Doug York said an earlier draft was better for the GOP, and he credited the commission with approving a map that wasn’t favored by either side.</p>
<p>Lerner tried in vain to tweak one competitive district in the North Valley to reduce its Republican leaning before the final vote. </p>
<p>Kirkpatrick has already announced plans to retire. The new district boundaries for the region she represents include eastern Tucson, Casa Grande and most of southeastern Arizona. </p>
<p>Eric Holder, the former U.S. attorney general under Democratic President Barack Obama, said Tuesday night that the maps could draw a lawsuit. </p>
<p>Maps drawn by the Arizona redistricting commissions based on the 2000 and 2010 censuses both were challenged in court. </p>
<p>The commission adopted draft maps in late October and then held a monthlong series of meetings across the state before starting its final set of meetings last week.</p>
<p>Republicans generally liked the district maps drawn after the 2000 census, and those done following the 2010 census were regarded as more favorable to Democrats, prompting strong criticism from Republicans.</p>
<div><div><h1>Judge: Arizona voters have right to decide tax cut repeal</h1></div><div>December 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>PHOENIX (AP) — A judge has ruled Arizona voters have a constitutional right to decide a referendum in November 2022 that seeks to repeal tax cuts that were approved by the Legislature and signed into law by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. </p>
<p>But Cooper, whose ruling was issued on Monday and became publicly available on Wednesday, said the constitution blocks referendums for appropriations and noted the tax cut law in question did not appropriate money. </p>
<p>Kory Langhofer, one of the lawyers for the Arizona Free Enterprise Club, said the group will appeal the decision. </p>

<p>A coalition opposed to the tax cuts collected signatures to ask voters to repeal the tax cuts. The judge has not yet ruled on the anti-tax group’s challenge of the validity of the signatures.</p>
<p>Arizona’s constitution allows voters to block new legislation by collecting signatures from 5% of the people who voted in the past general election. If they do, the law is put on hold until voters decide at the next general election.</p>
<div><div><h1>High court again taps election law expert to redraw lines</h1></div><div>By SUSAN HAIGHDecember 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Tuesday the lawmakers had faced “external pressures” to redraw the congressional lines in a certain way.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Kevin Kelly, R-Stratford, however, blamed the state’s all-Democratic congressional delegation for the process falling apart, accusing the five U.S. House members of wanting to retain safe districts. </p>
<p>Persily has also served as a court-appointed expert to craft congressional or legislative redistricting plans in Maryland, Georgia, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, according to his Stanford Law School biography.</p>
<p>Despite Persily’s appointment, the court on Thursday encouraged the state legislators to continue working on a compromise plan, noting that the justices “maintain hope that action by the commission will be forthcoming.”</p>
<p>If they end up reaching a consensus, the lawmakers are instructed to inform the court and submit their plan to the justices and Persily for consideration.</p>
<p>Persily is also not allowed to consider where the incumbent members of Congress live or other political data, including party registration statistics or election returns.</p>
<div><div><h1>South Carolina sued over newly drawn state House districts</h1></div><div>By JEFFREY COLLINSDecember 24, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The lawsuit was anticipated. South Carolina’s maps have been challenged in courts, sometimes successfully, for the past 50 years.</p>
<p>The groups said they reserve their right to sue later over the 46 <a>South Carolina Senate districts</a>, which don’t come up for election until 2024.</p>
<p>The <a>lawsuit</a> cites 28 of the 124 House districts where race was used to either exclude or concentrate Black voters in districts to dilute their overall political power.</p>
<p>There are lines that split Anderson into four districts “like a shattered mirror” to prevent Blacks from having enough clout to influence the result in any of the districts, the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>There is the bunny ear that extended into Chester to put Black voters in the city into a Fairfield County district that is already overwhelmingly minority instead of surrounding areas, the NAACP said.</p>
<p>They also said the maps kept more districts where minorities were the majority of voters than plans by the NAACP and other groups.</p>
<p>The NAACP said their plan had more districts where Black voters were 40% to 50% of the population and could influence more elections.</p>
<p>The group ran a computer program that generated nearly 12 billion possible House maps and found just over 400 had more bias than the one proposed by the chamber.</p>
<a>state Senate’s idea</a> kept the districts similar to the 2010 map, but made the 1st District, which is the only thing approaching a competitive district, more Republican.
<p>The House <a>had a more radical change</a> that would have kept the Charleston area more whole. but backtracked on the proposal before a public meeting scheduled for next Wednesday.</p>
<div><div><h1>Gorbachev’s resignation 30 years ago marked the end of USSR</h1></div><div>By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOVDecember 25, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Just minutes earlier, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev announced his resignation in a live televised address to the nation, concluding 74 years of Soviet history.</p>
<p>In his memoirs, Gorbachev, now 90, bitterly lamented his failure to prevent the USSR’s demise, an event that upset the world’s balance of power and sowed the seeds of an ongoing tug-of-war between Russia and neighboring Ukraine.</p>
<p>“I still regret that I failed to bring the ship under my command to calm waters, failed to complete reforming the country,” Gorbachev wrote.</p>
<p>The Soviet leader analyzed the tough dilemma in his memoirs, noting that an attempt to order the arrest of the republics’ leaders could have resulted in a bloodbath amid split loyalties in the military and law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>What would have happened had Gorbachev resorted to force is hard to imagine in retrospect, the Carnegie Center’s Trenin observed..</p>
<p>When the leaders of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine declared the Soviet Union defunct, they didn’t pay much attention to what would happen to the 4-million-strong Soviet military and its massive nuclear arsenals.</p>
<p>After the Soviet collapse, it took years of U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to persuade Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan to hand over to Russia the Soviet nuclear weapons left on their territories — a process finally completed in 1996.</p>
<p>“The leaders of the republics that announced the end of the Soviet Union in December 1991 did not think through all the consequences of what they were doing,” Gorbachev’s aide, Pavel Palazhchenko, told the AP.</p>
<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose two decades at the helm is longer than Gorbachev and Yeltsin’s tenures combined, has famously described the Soviet collapse as “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century.”</p>
<p>More than seven years of fighting in Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland has killed over 14,000 people. Tensions flared up in recent weeks over a Russian troop buildup near Ukraine that fueled Western fears of an invasion.</p>
<p>Moscow has denied plans for an offensive and sternly urged the U.S. and its allies to provide a binding pledge that NATO wouldn’t expand to Ukraine or deploy weapons there — a demand rejected by the West.</p>
<p>Putin and his officials countered the Western argument that Russia doesn’t have a say in the alliance’s expansion by emphasizing the country’s right to protect its core security interests. </p>
<p>The Russian leader further toughened his rhetoric Thursday amid spiraling tensions with the West, blaming Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin for handing Russian lands to Ukraine to “create a country that had never existed before.”</p>

<div><div><h1>Whitmer limits redistricting panel’s use of closed meetings</h1></div><div>By DAVID EGGERTDecember 27, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Monday that she signed legislation to prohibit Michigan’s new redistricting commission from citing exceptions under the Open Meetings Act to hold closed sessions.</p>
<p>Her signature last week came days after the state Supreme Court <a>ruled against the panel</a> in a test of a constitutional requirement that it conduct all of its business at open meetings.</p>
<p>It was the commission’s first meeting after Detroit residents and others criticized how draft plans had no districts where a majority of the voting-age population is Black.</p>
<p>The court, in a 4-3 ruling, ordered the panel to <a>release a recording of the closed session and seven memos</a> sought by news organizations that sued.</p>
<p>Commissioners will meet this week to approve U.S. House, state Senate and state House maps.</p>

<p>Oral arguments in two lawsuits challenging the new 4-year map showing boundaries for 15 U.S. House districts were pushed online by a new COVID-19 surge.</p>
<p>Phillip Strach, an attorney for Republican legislative leaders, said the people wanted less partisan districts “and that’s absolutely what they got.”</p>
<p>Strach said Republicans’ expert found Democratic U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown would have won eight or nine of them. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NDRC’s constitutional challenge contends the map leans 12-3 in favor of Republicans, although the GOP describes it as 6-2, with the remaining seven districts being competitive.</p>
