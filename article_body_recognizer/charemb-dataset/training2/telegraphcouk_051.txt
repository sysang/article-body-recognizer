<p> Scotland's First Minister announces a raft of new Covid measures, but confirms no further restrictions will be imposed until after Christmas </p>
<h1> Nicola Sturgeon ‘dithering’ over relaxation of Scotland’s Covid isolation rules </h1>
<p> First minister faces claims she is leaving businesses ‘in limbo’ after refusing to confirm whether she will cut 10-day requirement </p>

<p>Nicola Sturgeon has been accused of dithering over a relaxation of Scotland's strict self-isolation rules after she again delayed a decision over whether to cut quarantine to seven days.</p>
<a>keen to follow England's lead by reducing the 10-day requirement</a>, but faced claims that she was leaving businesses "in limbo" after refusing to confirm whether she would make the change. Any alteratiom would not come into force until Jan 5.
<p>Ms Sturgeon said more evidence about the severity of <a>the omicron variant</a> was needed as Scotland recorded 15,849 new Covid cases – a record high – with "steep increases" expected in the coming days.</p>
<p>However, during a virtual sitting of Holyrood on Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon said any changes in Scotland would not come in until after the festive period.</p>
<p>Douglas Ross, the Scottish Tory leader, claimed Scottish firms were "once again being treated like an afterthought", adding: "They're craving clarity and certainty from the Scottish government.</p>
<p>Ms Sturgeon said that while results from studies <a>suggesting omicron causes less severe illness</a> were promising, a major surge of cases could "cancel that out".</p>
<p>"But that will be short lived, because the risk we take is that we will actually accelerate the spread of the virus, and then that pressure on the economy will increase in the medium to longer term."</p>
<p>Liz Cameron, the chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said firms wanted to see an urgent reduction to the 10-day rule, which she warned was "having a detrimental impact on business operations and the wider economy".</p>
<p>"Employers are struggling to keep businesses open due to staff self-isolating, and those who can open are seeing undue pressure placed on employees who are backfilling for absent colleagues," she added.</p>
<p>Leon Thompson, UKHospitality Scotland's executive director, said the delay had added to problems for the sector following a "dismal" Christmas period.</p>
<h1> All Scottish pubs may have to hire door staff if vaccine passport scheme extended </h1>
<p> Situation ‘too ridiculous to even contemplate’ if bars must enforce ban on customers who have not been double-jabbed, say industry leaders </p>
<div> <div> By Daniel Sanderson, Scottish Correspondent <time> 10 November 2021 • 9:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Every pub in Scotland could be forced to hire door staff if plans to expand the country's vaccine passport scheme to all hospitality venues go ahead, industry leaders have warned.</p>
<p>John Swinney, the Deputy First Minister, revealed on Tuesday that SNP ministers were considering extending the controversial scheme, which <a>applies to nightclubs and large events</a>, to other hospitality and leisure venues.</p>
<p>But Mr Swinney faces mounting criticism for failing to set out exactly which premises the rules could apply to. In a meeting with hospitality bosses on Wednesday, Scottish government officials refused to clarify the scope of a possible extension.</p>
<p>There are fears that, should the scheme be expanded, existing guidance – which states that nightclub door staff who carry out vaccine checks and refuse entry must have a Security Industry Authority (SIA) licence – would apply to pubs.</p>
<h2>‘How would it work without door staff to enforce it?’</h2>
<p>Nightclubs have already complained that there is a shortage of accredited door staff in Scotland, and Paul Waterson, a spokesman for the SLTA, warned that any extension of the scheme would prove unenforceable.</p>
<p>However, analysis by The Telegraph has shown that the pace of the rollout actually slowed among younger Scots after the scheme was announced.</p>
<h2>SNP urged to ‘come clean’ to businesses</h2>
<a>rules on face masks</a> could be tightened, with an announcement due next week, but has so far declined to say how.
<p>However, Douglas Lumsden, the economy spokesman for the Scottish Tories, called on the SNP to "come clean" and provide "the most basic details" to businesses of what specific restrictions they are considering.</p>
<p>A Scottish government spokesman said: "As the Deputy First Minister has made clear, the situation around the pandemic is serious so we are being open about all the options available to us that may be required to protect the public.</p>
<p>"No decisions have been made and parliament will be informed if and when any decisions are reached. We continue to liaise closely with stakeholders, including the hospitality sector."</p>
<header> <h1> Covid isolation cut from 10 to seven days as ‘test to release’ introduced </h1> <p> Shorter quarantine periods for people who test positive among new rules brought in to ease impact on NHS staffing </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tony Diver, Political Correspondent and Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor <time> 22 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>People who test positive for coronavirus must now isolate for seven days rather than 10, under new rules that allow positive cases to “test to release”.</p>
<p>Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, is said to be concerned that the Government’s 10-day isolation rules have had a crippling effect on the NHS because so many staff are off work with the virus.</p>
<p>From Wednesday, infected people will be required to conduct lateral flow tests on days six and seven of their isolation, and the period will end if both are negative.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated people who come into contact with a positive case will still be required to <a>isolate for 10 days</a>.</p>
<p>Figures show that by Sunday night, 4,700 NHS staff in London were absent from work, up 140 per cent on the previous week.</p>
<h2>London named as ‘major incident’ zone</h2>
<p>The capital, which has been hit hardest by the arrival of the omicron variant to the UK, has been named a <a>“major incident” zone</a> by Sadiq Khan, the city’s mayor.</p>
<p>If rates of staff absence continue to increase at the same rate, then one third of NHS staff will be absent by New Year’s Day.</p>
<p>The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, conducted analysis that suggested one in 10 NHS workers in England could be absent over the Christmas period.</p>
<p>The union has argued for Parliament to be recalled to approve restrictions on indoor gatherings, which it says would reduce strain on the health service.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, a senior government source said that the reduction in the isolation period would go some way to easing the impact of staff shortages.</p>
<p>People who test negative on day seven and leave isolation will nonetheless be advised to avoid poorly ventilated indoor spaces, <a>work from home and limit contact with the vulnerable</a>.</p>
<p>“It’s vital people keep playing their part by testing regularly and isolating if they test positive. And I urge you to Get Boosted Now to protect yourself and those around you.”</p>
<p>The shorter isolation period is also supported by Prof Neil Ferguson, who sits on the Government’s Sage committee and said seven days was likely to be sufficient as long as patients test negative on the last day.</p>
<p>“All the modelling and analysis would suggest if it is coupled with lateral flow testing, [isolating for just seven days is] not going to reduce the effectiveness of the measures that much,” he said.</p>
<p>Although the Government will be required to change the law to formally alter the rules, existing regulations make provision for positive cases with a “reasonable excuse” not to isolate. </p>
<p>The Government now considers testing negative for the virus after seven days as a “reasonable excuse” to leave isolation.</p>
<p>Ministers will change the isolation regulations in Parliament in the new year.</p>
<h1> Nicola Sturgeon’s deputy ‘twisting data’ to justify Scotland’s strict Covid rules </h1>
<p> John Swinney accused of misleading public after citing study that applied to week before new regulations came in </p>
<div> <div> By Daniel Sanderson, Scottish Correspondent <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:21pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon's deputy has been accused of "twisting data" to justify Scotland's stricter Covid rules, with Ms Sturgeon coming under renewed pressure to relax tough self-isolation requirements.</p>
<p>However, he came under attack after it emerged that the study applied to the week ending Dec 23, before new rules such as a ban on large crowds, <a>the closure of nightclubs</a> and restrictions on hospitality, came into force.</p>
<a>cut the self-isolation requirement from 10 days to seven</a>, provided two negative lateral flow tests are recorded.
<p>Mr Swinney was on Tuesday accused of misleading the public in the run-up to the statement after he suggested Scotland's new rules were contributing to lower infection rates.</p>
<a>in London</a>, where the ONS estimated that one in 15 people had the virus. At various points in the pandemic, the same study, which is published weekly, has shown Covid to be more prevalent in Scotland than England.
<p>"It's ridiculous for John Swinney to claim data from before extra restrictions came into effect proves his restrictions are working," Alex Cole-Hamilton, the leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, said.</p>
<a>being admitted for other reasons</a>.
<p>Figures published by the Scottish government show that <a>just one person with the omicron variant</a> required intensive care treatment as of Dec 31.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Christine Tait-Burkard, a Covid expert at the University of Edinburgh, said it was "almost without a doubt" that case numbers would rise further due to the return of schools this week.</p>
<p>However, she said Scotland was "almost in the best possible situation" due to high vaccination rates, treatments available for those who did fall seriously ill and the emergence of the less deadly omicron strain. </p>
<p>Douglas Ross, the leader of the Scottish Tories, said more evidence had emerged that omicron <a>was causing less severe infections</a> and that maintaining the current rules on self-isolation was "unsustainable".</p>
<p>"Nicola Sturgeon's dithering and delaying is continuing to have a major impact on frontline services and the wider economy, due to the sheer numbers having to isolate," he said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Scottish government said claims that Mr Swinney had misled the public were "totally unfounded".</p>
<p>He added: "Prior to Boxing Day there were already substantial differences in Covid protections between Scotland and England – most importantly on wearing face coverings.</p>

<p>Nicola Sturgeon has abandoned her tougher coronavirus self-isolation rules, cutting the period from 10 to seven days in line with the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>The Scottish First Minister had faced pressure from opposition parties to make the change, which applies as long as people test negative on days six and seven of isolation. The changes will come into effect at midnight on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ms Sturgeon said that current restrictions on large gatherings, hospitality and leisure businesses will remain until at least Jan 17, but that no further restrictions to tackle omicron will be announced.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Scottish Parliament, the First Minister said: "These changes are significant and not completely without risk.</p>
<p>Ms Sturgeon's relaxation of the restrictions came as she confirmed that 16,103 new Covid infections had been recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>She said that more than one in 20 people in Scotland are likely to have the virus and she expects this to rise further, warning the volume of cases means Covid-19 "still has the potential to overwhelm us".</p>
<h3>And that's all for today...</h3>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon abandoned her tougher coronavirus self-isolation rules, cutting the period from 10 to seven days in line with the rest of the UK. </p>
<p>The Scottish First Minister had faced pressure from opposition parties to make the change, which applies as long as people test negative on days six and seven of isolation. </p>
<p>The changes will come into effect at midnight on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, PCR tests are set to be ditched for travellers arriving in the UK, saving a family of four returning from holiday up to £200.</p>
<p>It comes as pre-departure tests, costly Day two PCR tests and self-isolation on arrival have been scrapped for fully vaccinated travellers and under-18s, a significant move welcome by both British holidaymakers and the travel industry. </p>
<p>Speaking in the Commons, Boris Johnson confirmed that Plan B measures will continue for at least the next three weeks as the Government unveiled a number of Covid rule changes.</p>
<h3>Testing changes will also apply to care homes, confirms PM </h3>
<p>Hillary Benn, the Labour MP, says that up until now the advice has been that care home residents should not be tested for 90 days after a positive PCR result unless they develop symptoms.</p>
<p>"Given the changes to the testing arrangements announced today, does that advice still hold?" he asks.</p>
<p>"No it doesn't, and I will ensure he is advised on the new arrangements," Mr Johnson replies.</p>
<h3>Boris Johnson: Face masks in schools will 'not last a day more' than needed</h3>
<p>Face masks in schools will "not last a day more" than needed, Boris Johnson has said.</p>
<p>Robert Jenrick, a former Tory minister, said masks for pupils are "not cost-free" and do "affect the quality of teaching and the wellbeing of our children".</p>
<p>He asked in the Commons: "What assurances can (Mr Johnson) give me and parents across the country that this measure will be constantly reviewed and will only last as long as absolutely necessary?</p>
<p>Mr Johnson replied: "I can give him the categorical assurance that masks in schools will not last a day more than we need them."</p>
<h3>More than 194,000 Covid cases confirmed</h3>
<p>A total of 194,747 new cases of Covid have been confirmed this afternoon.</p>
<p>A further 334 coronavirus deaths have been also reported today, which includes delayed reporting numbers from over the Bank Holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Week-on-week, hospital admissions with Covid are up 58.5 per cent, Department for Health data show.</p>
<h3>Communication with teachers could be better, says Labour MP</h3>
<p>Kim Leadbeater, the MP for Batley and Spen, praises teachers and support staff for working "heroically" throughout the pandemic, but cautions that they are "struggling".</p>
<p>"I share what she said about the amazing work that's been done by teachers and schools up and down the country, and they've done incredible things to make their schools Covid-compliant," the Prime Minister says.</p>
<p>"We communicate with them the whole time and the Secretary of State for Education has done a formidable job of interacting with teachers and with parents and trying to get our messages across."</p>
<h3>Stepping up boosters the way back to the 'old normal', says Boris Johnson</h3>
<p>Steve Baker, the MP for Wycombe, credits Boris Johnson with doing his "level best" with trying to save lives and preserve prosperity across the country.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson says "the plan is the one we have in place" - to continue with Plan B, which will be reviewed in three weeks before its planned expiry on January 26.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean there won't be further challenges, but I think life will return to something much closer to normality, it won't be necessary to have the restrictions we currently have in place."</p>
<h3>The latest travel announcement is the best news we could have hoped for</h3>
<p>Today’s decision to end the need for fully-vaccinated travellers to show evidence of a negative lateral flow test taken within 48 hours of returning to England is a vital boost to holidaymakers and the travel industry, writes Nick Trend.</p>
<p>And it’s not surprising. </p>
<h3>JCVI 'keeping fourth jabs under review'</h3>
<p>Greg Clark, the Tory MP, suggests that NHS workers should get a fourth Covid jab so they do not get infected and can stay at work to ease pressure on the health service.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson says the JCVI are “keeping fourth jabs under review”</p>
<p>The SNP's Ian Blackford accuses Boris Johnson of a "reckless gamble which risks lives and risks the NHS", asserting that it means "avoidable deaths and long Covid".</p>
<p>The correct approach would be more caution to slow transmission, he suggests, referring to restrictions in Scotland and the other devolved nations (see 2.28pm).</p>
<p>Mr Johnson encourages Mr Blackford to "take back what he said" and accuses him of "totally untrue" comments, as the Speaker intervenes to encourage Mr Blackford to "calm down" and "start the new year as we mean to go on".</p>

<h3>Johnson announces change to Covid travel rules</h3>
<h3>Boris Johnson confirms Plan B will remain in place for next three weeks</h3>
<p>Mr Johnson starts a statement on the omicron variant by paying tribute to vaccine volunteers and health workers, noting that more than 10 million vaccines have been administered since the start of his Omicron Emergency Boost scheme.</p>
<p>"We have a higher level of booster protection than all our European neighbours, with over 34 million boosters administered in the UK," he says.</p>
<p>"The Cabinet agreed this morning we should agree to stick with Plan B for the next three weeks, with a further review before the regulations expire on January 26... This Government does not believe we need to shut our country again."</p>
<h3>Johnson defends pandemic sick pay</h3>
<p>Andy McDonald, the Labour MP for Middlesbrough, challenges Boris Johnson on the £96-a-week sick pay for those who have been unwell during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson responds that the Government made statutory sick pay payable from day one, so it is 75 per cent more generous when people have to isolate.</p>
<p>The key is to keep people in "higher-wage, higher-skill jobs", Mr Johnson adds, claiming: "That is what we are doing."</p>
<h3>Wales follows England on change to PCR tests</h3>
<p>Wales is to scrap confirmatory PCR tests for asymptomatic Covid sufferers in an attempt to reduce pressure on laboratories, the Welsh Government has confirmed.</p>
<p>Eluned Morgan, the Health Minister, announced the changes on Wednesday, bringing the country in line with the rest of the UK.</p>
<p>It follows advice by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), which said that from January 11 asymptomatic people in England who test positive will no longer require a confirmatory PCR test.</p>
<h3>Boris Johnson: Labour would have kept us in lockdown</h3>
<p>She refers to Martin Lewis's warnings of a "seismic hit" to energy bills.</p>
<p>In response, the Prime Minister refers to cold weather payments for four million people a week and measures to cut taxes for those on Universal Credit while increasing the living wage by £1,000.</p>
<h3>Welsh First Minister engaged in 'political posturing' over Covid restrictions, says Tory MP</h3>
<p>The First Minister of Wales engaged in "political posturing" with Christmas Covid restrictions, a Tory MP has said.</p>
<p>Wales Secretary Simon Hart replied: "There has been a huge effort on the UK Government and Welsh Government to try and maintain public confidence in what has been an incredibly trying period of time."</p>
<p>He added: "The recent raft of measures and some of the confusing examples have left even the most loyal people doubting whether he (Mark Drakeford) is still up to making those decisions."</p>
<h3>Risk of getting stuck abroad main deterrent for holidaymakers, finds poll</h3>
<p>Almost half of travellers questioned for a survey said they were not willing to leave the UK. </p>
<p>Among those who aren’t planning to holiday abroad, 62pc named Covid-19 risks as the reason in the research by GoCompare Travel Insurance.</p>
<p>The top concern related to Covid was the possibility of getting stuck overseas, followed by the prospect of having to cancel their trip. Catching the virus being the third most cited reason.</p>
<p>The poll of 3,000 consumers top place at the start of December – before the spread of omicron.</p>
<h3>PCR tests to be ditched for travellers arriving in UK</h3>
<p>PCR tests are set to be ditched for travellers arriving in the UK, saving a family of four returning from holiday up to £200, reports Charles Hymas.</p>
<p>Ministers are understood to have agreed on Wednesday that travellers will instead only have to take a lateral flow test, which cost on average around £20 to £30 rather than the £80 for PCR swabs.</p>
<p>The Cabinet’s Covid Operations committee also backed plans, first revealed in the Telegraph, to scrap pre-departure tests currently required for travellers within 48 hours of their return to Britain.</p>
<h3>France to allow asymptomatic healthcare workers to keep working</h3>
<p>France is allowing healthcare workers who are infected with Covid-19 but have few or no symptoms to keep treating patients rather than self-isolate, in a bid to alleviate staff shortages at hospitals.</p>
<p>It is a calculated risk, with the possibility that Covid-positive health workers and carers could infect colleagues and patients weighed against what the government says is a need to keep essential services running.</p>
<h3>Brussels Airlines runs 3,000 empty flights to hold onto take-off and landing slots</h3>
<p>Brussels Airlines has operated 3,000 empty or nearly empty flights over the winter to prevent it losing take-off and landing rights at major airports, reports The Bulletin,</p>
<p>Lufthansa, the carrier's parent company, ran 18,000 flights this winter that would otherwise have been cancelled due to lack of passengers.</p>
<p>The group plans to cancel 33,000 scheduled flights by the end of March due to a drop in bookings following the spread of the omicron variant.</p>
<h3>One in 15 in England had Covid during final week of 2021, ONS data suggests</h3>
<p>Around 3.3 million people in England had coronavirus in the last week of 2021, data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests.</p>
<p>This equates to one in 15 people, according to the latest ONS estimate. In London, around one in 10 people were likely to test positive for Covid in the week up to December 31.</p>
<p>One in 20 people were estimated to have had the virus in the same week in both Scotland and Wales, a figure that stood at one in 25 in Northern Ireland.</p>
<h3>France to ease UK travel restrictions after 'supersonic' rise in its cases</h3>
<p>Travel restrictions between the UK and France will be eased slightly amid a "supersonic" rise in French infections, a French government spokesman has said.</p>
<p>Gabriel Attal said that France will make it a "bit easier " to travel to and from the UK, widening the official list of valid reasons for travel.</p>
<p>The French Government banned British holidaymakers from travelling to France late last year amid a surge in omicron cases in the UK.</p>
<p>Travellers have only been allowed to enter France for specific valid reasons, including nationals or residents returning home, urgent family matters and essential work. The extended list of valid reasons for travel has not yet been clarified.</p>
<p>The easing of travel restrictions comes amid a "supersonic" rise in Covid infections in France, which shows no signs of slowing down in the coming days, Mr Attal said.</p>
<p>He said that infections were reaching "stratospheric levels" in the Ile-de-France region around Paris and some other parts of France, and said that the situation in hospitals could worsen in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Omicron is now dominant in France and is driving a high number of daily infections. A total of 271,686 new Covid infections were reported in France over the past 24 hours.</p>
<h3>Scottish NHS is 'depleted' and 'exhausted', says Sturgeon</h3>
<p>Scotland's NHS workforce is "depleted and ever more exhausted" because of the new wave of Covid-19, Nicola Sturgeon has said.</p>
<p>The First Minister told MSPs there were three key impacts of the recent spike on the health service, saying: "First, from dealing with non-Covid backlogs built up over the course of the pandemic.</p>
<p>"Second, many NHS staff are absent and self-isolating because they have Covid, or are close contacts of people with it.</p>
<p>"This means the increasing pressure on the NHS is being managed by a depleted and ever more exhausted workforce.</p>
<p>"And third, as we keep saying, even with a lower rate of hospitalisation, the sheer volume of cases caused by the much greater transmissibility of Omicron will lead to more patients with Covid ending up in hospital."</p>
<h3>Sturgeon: £55 million of government support to businesses affected by Covid-19</h3>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon has allocated £55 million of Scottish Government support to businesses impacted by Covid-19.</p>
<p>The First Minister announced £28 million for the taxi industry, £19 million for close contact services such as beauticians and hairdressers, £5 million for sport and £3 million for tourism.</p>
<p>The funding is part of a £375 million made up of savings from the Scottish Government and Barnett consequentials from south of the border.</p>
<h3>New road map to be published in next few weeks, says Sturgeon</h3>
<p>A new road map for dealing with Covid-19 will be published by the Scottish Government in the next few weeks, Nicola Sturgeon has said.</p>
<p>The First Minister said the country will have to "adapt our thinking about how to manage the virus and become more resilient to it in future".</p>
<p>She added: "There are no easy answers here, but adapting to the ongoing challenge of Covid is inescapable.</p>
<p>"The Scottish Government is currently working on and will publish within the next few weeks a revised strategic framework, which will set out more fully how that process of adaptation can be managed.</p>
<p>"We will seek views from across Parliament as we develop this new framework in more detail.</p>
<p>"However, the changes I am about to confirm to the requirements on self isolation and testing are an early indication of an already adapting response."</p>
<h3>Sturgeon: First change to self isolation applies to those who test positive for Covid-19</h3>
<h3>Sturgeon: Scotland follows England on change to PCR tests</h3>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon has announced that Scotland will follow England on PCR testing.</p>
<p>The changes will take place from midnight tonight.</p>
<p>She told Scottish Parliament: "Scotland, and the UK as a whole, has one of the most extensive PCR testing systems anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>"However, with infection levels are as high as they are, we must fully utilise all available testing capacity - PCR and lateral flow.</p>
<p>"For those with symptoms of COVID, the advice remains to book a PCR test. "And the advice to everyone is to test regularly with lateral flow devices, especially before meeting up with others.</p>
<p>"However, from tomorrow, if your lateral flow test is positive there will no longer be any need to take a PCR test to confirm the result.</p>
<p>"Anyone identified as a close contact who is over 18 years and four month and not fully vaccinated will still be asked to self-isolate for 10 days and take a PCR test."</p>
<h3>Sturgeon: No more restrictions but no existing ones scrapped until Jan 17</h3>
<p>The First Minister said: "More generally, we are not proposing any new protective measures today.</p>
<p>"However, with the virus so prevalent, we do consider it important to continue to apply some brake on transmission, particularly in settings posing the highest risk.</p>
<h3>One in 40 in Scotland have Covid, says Sturgeon</h3>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon said: "The weekly survey published by the Office of National Statistics gives a better indication - in the week to 23 December, it suggested that one in 40 people in Scotland had COVID.</p>
<p>"The results of the most recent ONS survey – published just a few minutes ago – suggest that in the week to 31 December that had risen to one in 20."</p>
<h3>Nicola Sturgeon: One million cases since onset of pandemic set to be reported tomorrow </h3>
<p>Addressing Scottish Parliament Nicola Sturgeon says that tomorrow's cases will take us to one million reported cases since the onset of the pandemic.</p>
<p>She said that 16,103 cases were reported yesterday, adding that in Scotland the number of cases has increased by 87 per cent.</p>
<h3>Nicola Sturgeon: We are not setting out any additional measures</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Nicola Sturgeon has said that she is not proposing any additional measures.</p> <p>She said existing guidance will stay in place for a further week.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Boris Johnson has support of Cabinet to keep Plan B measures in place</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson has the support of his Cabinet to keep Plan B restrictions in place ahead of a review of the regulations before they expire on January 26, Downing Street has said.</p>
<p>"The Prime Minister said the Government would continue to give the NHS all the support it needs to further manage the pressure it is under.</p>
<p>"Cabinet agreed this approach and put on record its thanks and appreciation for the incredible efforts of NHS staff who are once again rising to the challenge of the global pandemic."</p>
<h3>What Plan B Covid restrictions mean for schools </h3>
<p>As pupils return to school after the Christmas holidays, those in Year 7 and above are being asked to wear face masks in classrooms again - after ministers drew up contingency plans to keep schools open amid fears of widespread teacher absences.</p>
<p>Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, said the move was designed to help "maximise the number of children in school" and would remain only as long as needed, amid fears of omicron disrupting teaching in schools.</p>
<p>The Telegraph also has confirmation that more drastic proposals include prioritising GCSE and A-Level students for face-to-face teaching, should schools be hit by staff absences.</p>
<p>With the latest update revealing the continuation of Plan B Covid measures until Jan 26, the reintroduction of mandatory face masks in classrooms will last until this date, according to Mr Zahawi.</p>
<p>Matthew Robinson has all the details</p>
<h3>Hospitals in Bristol declare 'critical incidents' amid rising pressure</h3>
<p>'Internal critical incidents' have been declared at hospitals across Bristol because of rising Covid and non-Covid pressures on services.</p>
<p>Both the University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust and the North Bristol NHS Trust, which run 12 hospitals and centres between them, said they had reached their "highest state of alert".</p>
<p>The Healthier Together Partnership noted that both of the acute trusts had declared critical incidents across the Bank Holiday weekend.</p>
<p>"This meant they were able to open up extra beds and ward space, as well as request additional staff," the Partnership said.</p>
<p>"Like other areas of the country, many staff across health and care are either unwell with Covid-19 or isolating."</p>
<p>Members of the public can take the "most important" protective action by getting their first, second or booster dose of a vaccine, the Healthier Together Partnership urged.</p>
<h3>Public 'not getting what they deserve' at this point in pandemic, says paramedic</h3>
<p>A paramedic from the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) has said members of the public are "not getting what they deserve" at the current stage of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The NEAS today confirmed that it had indeed asked members of the public to take their friend or relative to hospital themselves in "non life-threatening" situations.</p>
<p>The paramedic, who asked not to be named, told the PA news agency: "I feel awful because we are at a stage where the public are not getting what they deserve despite us trying to do all we can to support them."</p>
<p>They added that the service was "drowning under the pressure of a perfect storm" amid a record number of omicron cases and high levels of staff absence.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter how good the PPE is because frequently staff are being exposed to Covid in their personal lives with family members testing positive. Colleagues working on New Year said it was absolutely rammed.</p>
<p>"So we understand if the public are terrified about being asked to drive a relative to hospital, it's not ideal, but if that's an option that leads to a swifter outcome for their loved one, that has to be done."</p>
<h3>Scrap testing rules for UK-bound passengers, urge travel firms</h3>
<p>The travel industry is calling on the Government to remove all testing requirements for international travellers, writes Gareth Davies.</p>
<p>Manchester Airports Group (MAG) and Airlines UK said research they commissioned into travel restrictions found domestic, not international, restrictions would be the only way to reduce the spread of omicron.</p>
<p>Pre-departure and day two PCR testing were reintroduced in late November and early December in response to the spread of omicron.</p>
<p>From early December, MAG said passenger numbers at its airports fell by more than 30 per cent. The travel restrictions are expected to be reviewed later today.</p>

<h3>PCR tests to be temporarily suspended for positive lateral flow test results</h3>
<p>People in England without Covid-19 symptoms who have a positive lateral flow test will no longer need a confirmatory PCR test from January 11, the UK Health Security Agency said.</p>
<p>From January 11th in England, people who receive positive lateral flow results for Covid-19 will be required to self-isolate immediately and won’t be required to take a confirmatory PCR test.</p>
<p>This is a temporary measure while Covid-19 rates remain high across the UK. Whilst levels of Covid-19 are high, the vast majority of people with positive LFD results can be confident that they have Covid-19.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong bans indoor dining after 6pm</h3>
<p>Hong Kong is rolling out fresh restrictions for the first time in almost a year amid fears the city is on the brink of a major winter Covid outbreak.</p>
<p>Indoor dining will be banned after 6pm while some venues will be closed completely, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>There will also be a return to social distancing rules that were in place a year ago and eased after Chinese New Year 2021, while flights from eight countries – including the UK and US – will be banned from 8 January.</p>
<h3>Ireland axes tests for arrivals</h3>
<p>The Irish government is scrapping requirement for people to provide a negative PCR or antigen test to enter the country, reports Independent.ie. </p>
<p>Government sources told the news site that tests are longer needed given that omicron accounts for more than 95pc of Ireland's cases. </p>
<p>Passengers will still need to show their proof of vaccination or recovery from Covid, or a negative PCR test taken before departure.</p>
<h3>Which critical workers will be required to take daily Covid tests? </h3>
<p>Around 100,000 critical industry workers will be required to take daily lateral flow tests from Jan 10 in a bid to alleviate the staffing shortage crisis gripping Britain, the Government has confirmed.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson announced at a press conference on Tuesday Jan 4 that critical personnel will be covered by the scheme, although the criteria will be less expansive than previously. </p>
<p>Here, we look at who may be included in the scheme and how the Government has previously defined key workers.</p>
<h3>Pupils ‘vilified’ if they don’t take Covid tests or wear masks in class</h3>
<p>Pupils who do not wear face masks are being told to sit at the back of the class, while those who fail <a>to test twice a week</a> will be denied lessons, breaks and lunch time with their peers, writes Camilla Turner.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, children are being told to wear coats and scarves in lessons if they are cold, as windows will be kept open for ventilation.</p>
<p>Ministers have been urged to launch an “urgent” crackdown on schools that “abuse” <a>official Covid guidance</a> by going further than what is advised.</p>

<h3>PCR test delays force pub and restaurant workers to isolate for almost two weeks</h3>
<p>Pub and restaurant staff are being forced to isolate for almost two weeks because of delays in Covid PCR tests, industry leaders have warned ahead of an expected relaxation of the rules.</p>
<div> <div> <p>Anyone who does not have Covid symptoms but gets a positive lateral flow result, accounting for about 40pc of cases, must then get a confirmatory PCR test.</p> <p>Read the full story from Hannah Boland here</p> </div> </div>
<h3>Covid outbreak hits cruise ship in Italy</h3>
<p>Dozens of passengers were taken off a cruise ship in Genoa, Italy, after testing positive for Covid.</p>
<p>Some 45 guests disembarked the MSC Grandiosa this week in Genoa.</p>
<p>More passengers who tested positive are expected to be offloaded in Civitavecchia or in Palermo, Sicily.</p>
<p>RaiNews24 reported more than 100 guests are infected.</p>
<h3> 'Travel bans and restrictions don't prevent infections coming into the UK</h3>
<p>Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, said "harsh testing measures have really hurt recovery in the sector".</p>
<p>He added: "Travel bans and restrictions don't prevent infections coming into the UK, as we've seen, but simply damage consumer confidence and slow bookings.</p>
<p>"I don't need to take any tests to travel from London to Edinburgh by train, where I mix with lots of people, so why should it be any different to travel from Brussels to London by train?</p>
<p>"Testing should only be done when I'm back in the UK and planning to visit relatives or go to a large event."</p>
<h3>Emmanuel Macron pledges to 'p--- off' France's unvaccinated until they get the Covid jab</h3>
<p>Emmanuel Macron has sparked uproar by pledging to “p--- off” France’s unvaccinated in denying them access to even more aspects of daily life, writes Henry Samuel.</p>
<p>The French president’s inflammatory comments came as the government seeks to push through parliament legislation that will make vaccination compulsory to enjoy cultural activities, use inter-city train travel or visit a cafe from January 15.</p>
<p>No longer will it be possible to have a recent test or a recovery from the coronavirus to qualify for the country's Covid pass.</p>

<h3> Israel reports all-time high for new cases, despite border closures</h3>
<p>Israel has recorded its highest-ever number of new Covid-19 infections, driven by the omicron variant, despite restrictions on travel and required quarantines, the government reported on Wednesday. </p>
<p>The record of 11,978 cases diagnosed on Tuesday marks the most new infections reported in a single day since the start of the pandemic. The previous record was set Sept. 2 with 11,345 new infections logged during the delta variant's wave. </p>
<p>Now, Israel is believed to be the first country to offer a 4th vaccination to people 60 and older, as well as those with compromised immune systems.</p>
<h3>NHS struggling in a 'prolonged way' rather than on a war footing</h3>
<p>Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the NHS is struggling in a "prolonged way" rather than suddenly being on a "war footing".</p>
<p>"What we need to do is make sure everyone understands that," Dr Henderson told the BBC's Today programme. "There isn't something magical we can do now, this is a prolonged crisis.</p>
<p>She also called on Boris Johnson to adopt "calm, sober language" and explain the pressures on the NHS to patients after his comments that Britain should be able to "ride out" the current wave of coronavirus.</p>
<h3>You’ll need a Covid booster vaccine to travel abroad, warns Boris Johnson</h3>
<p>Booster vaccines are likely to be needed for travel to many countries within weeks, Boris Johnson warned as he urged people to come forward for a third jab.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said the travel requirement was likely to become "the norm" very soon, adding that it would be "very much to people's advantage" to take up the jabs.</p>
<p>Third vaccines are also set to be needed for vaccine passports in England after everyone has been offered a third vaccine. That milestone has now been reached – but more than nine million eligible people have yet to take up the offer.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, Mr Johnson said the Government would "give people plenty of time" before requiring a third jab for vaccine passports and urged millions to come forward.</p>
<h3>Moroccan tour operators protest pandemic restrictions</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Moroccan tour operators threatened with bankruptcy due to border closures protested Tuesday, calling for the tourism industry to be "saved".</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p> About 200 industry workers demonstrated in front of the tourism ministry in Rabat, demanding the reopening of borders and talks with the authorities, citing the "dramatic collapse" of the industry in the wake of the pandemic. </p>
<p>Lahcen Zelmat, head of the national federation of the hotel industry, said the situation for tourism was "catastrophic" and called for borders to be reopened and bank loan payments to be delayed.</p>
<p>Raja Ould Hamada, the owner of a travel agency in Marrakesh, said the most recent border closure was a "fatal blow" to the industry, claiming "other competing countries" such as Egypt, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates had benefitted.</p>
<h3>Ambulance service confirms it asked friends or relatives to take 'non-life threatening' patients to hospital</h3>
<p>The North East Ambulance Service has confirmed that it asked patients with "potentially non-life threatening" calls to be taken to hospital by a friend or relative if an ambulance was delayed over the Bank Holiday.</p>
<p>Dr Mathew Beattie, medical director at NEAS, described the decision as "incredibly difficult" but said it formed part of the highest level of its clinical escalation plan.</p>
<p>Dr Beattie added: "Under normal circumstances, we would move up and down our clinical escalation levels reactively as each point is triggered or demand reduces.</p>
<p>"The measures we took over the bank holiday weekend were implemented because we have seen activity fluctuating dramatically with surges in demand.</p>
<p>"This was an incredibly difficult decision to take, but when patients are waiting an average of an hour for an ambulance that should be responding within 18 minutes, there is a risk for them coming to harm if they cannot get to hospital quickly."</p>
<h3>Man charged after anti-vaccine protest outside Sajid Javid’s home </h3>
<p>A 60-year-old man has been charged with criminal damage following reports of an anti-vaccine protest outside Sajid Javid's London home.</p>
<p>A video posted online appears to show a person delivering a letter with an anti-Covid vaccine message to what they claimed was the Health Secretary's home in Fulham, south-west London.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police said Geza Tarjanyi, 60, of Leyland, Lancashire, was arrested on Monday.</p>
<p>The force said he was due to appear in custody at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, charged with having an article with intent to destroy or damage property. He was then bailed to appear at Isleworth Crown Court on Feb 1.</p>
<h3>Covid-19 care home deaths down</h3>
<p>Some 55 care home resident deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales were registered in the week to December 24, down slightly from 60 in the previous week.</p>
<p>In total, 44,521 care home residents in England and Wales have had Covid-19 recorded on their death certificate since the pandemic began.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <p>It is the Labour leader's sixth time in isolation after previous Test and Trace rules meant he had to self-isolate whenever a close contact of his tested positive.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Hong Kong bans flights from eight countries</h3>
<p>Hong Kong has announced strict new anti-coronavirus controls today, banning flights from eight nations, shutting bars and gyms and cancelling evening restaurant dining after the omicron variant was detected within the city.</p>
<p>The restrictions are the latest economic blow to Hong Kong which has pursued a zero-Covid strategy that has kept cases low but left residents cut off from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Like mainland China, Hong Kong has maintained some of the world's harshest measures throughout the pandemic - including virtually closed borders, weeks-long quarantines, targeted lockdowns and mass testing.</p>
<p>The city has recorded 114 omicron cases as of Tuesday evening, with the vast majority identified at the airport or during the 21-day hotel quarantine that is mandatory for most arrivals.</p>
<h3>You can't expect 'everything to remain the same' with elective surgery, claims minister</h3>
<p>It is "unreasonable in the face of omicron to expect everything to remain the same" as some hospitals cancel non-urgent operations, the care minister has claimed.</p>
<p>Annual contingency planning means "often [slowing] down electives", according to Gillian Keegan, even though the Government "obviously wants" the backlog to remain cleared.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Today programme, Ms Keegan said: "What we do is we have these contingency plans where they can call for mutual aid, they can call for more volunteers, they can call for military aid if they need."</p>
<p>"But right now, if we have emergencies due to a lot of admissions at AE that is one of the measures hospital trusts will look at. But obviously we want everyone to get their elective surgery as soon as they can."</p>
<h3>Moves to relax Covid testing rules would be 'welcome', says Immigration Union</h3>
<p>Lucy Moreton, a professional officer at the Immigration Services Union, said she would "welcome" the moves to relax Covid testing rules.</p>
<p>When asked about the proposed changes, she told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme: "If scientists are happy that LFDs are sufficient for that, then yes that would be welcome."</p>

<p>The UK Government knew "this was going to be one of the most pressurised winters" for the NHS and that extra investment had been given to help the service cope, a minister has said.</p>
<p>"We always knew that this was going to be one of the most pressurised winters and they are doing an absolutely amazing job.</p>

<h3>Minister hints at removing 'unnecessary' testing requirements</h3>
<p>A record number of lateral flow tests were mailed to people on Tuesday, Gillian Keegan said, as she hinted at removing "unnecessary" testing procedures.</p>
<p>Asked what might be behind teams looking at relaxing the rules around follow-up PCR tests, the health minister told BBC Breakfast: "What we've got is many, many more lateral flow tests.</p>
<p>"Yesterday was a record - we sent out 741,000 lateral flow tests to people's homes.</p>
<p>"We're doing so many of these and they are really accurate when you've got a very infectious variant like Omicron.</p>
<p>"So, actually, what we are doing all the time is looking at what makes sense, we don't need to do things that are unnecessary."</p>
<h3>There may be news today on follow-up PCR testing, says minister</h3>
<p>There is "no official" update yet on whether testing rules will be changed in England so that those who test positive in lateral flow tests will not need a confirmatory PCR, according to a health minister.</p>
<p>Gillian Keegan, asked about The Telegraph's front page, told BBC Breakfast: "The teams are looking constantly at what makes sense and what works, etc, but I don't have any official news or updates for you this morning."</p>
<p>Pressed on whether the rule change was being brought in for those who are asymptomatic, the minister replied: "As I say, I don't have any official news on that but I know that the teams are looking at testing and testing regimes.</p>
<p>"We've introduced so many lateral flow tests now and they are very accurate - they are really accurate if people are infectious, so I guess they are looking at the regime all the time in terms of what makes sense.</p>
<p>"I don't have any official news but the teams will announce it once they have come to their conclusions."</p>
<p>Asked whether the announcement could come on Wednesday, she said: "You may be able to expect some news - I don't know when."</p>
<h3>Lateral flows are very accurate, says Spi-M expert</h3>
<p>Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Modelling group (Spi-M), told BBC Breakfast that lateral flows were very accurate when it came to recording a positive result.</p>
<p>"Of course, with a PCR test what happens is a number of those can get sent away for sequencing and then you get more information regarding the virus itself.</p>
<p>He said it was "very, very important" that if any changes were brought in regarding dropping some PCRs that people still recorded their results from lateral flows.</p>
<p>Regarding the potential change to travel testing requirements, he said when there were very high numbers of cases in the UK, testing upon entry to the UK "becomes less important" as cases are already circulating.</p>
<p>"So, again, that's probably why the change is coming in to support the travel industry and reduce a lot of the testing requirements."</p>
<h3>Covid testing rules to be relaxed to solve staff shortages</h3>
<p>Covid testing rules will be relaxed as part of efforts to shorten isolation periods and ease <a>the staffing shortages</a> crippling Britain, The Telegraph understands.</p>
<a>bin collections delayed</a>, 
<a>trains cancelled</a> and 17 hospitals in Greater Manchester announcing on Tuesday that they would be suspending some 
<a>non-urgent surgery</a>, with 15 per cent of staff off sick.
<p>Millions of people who test positive on <a>lateral flow devices</a> will be told they do not need to take follow-up PCR tests, which currently delay the official start of isolation for hundreds of thousands.</p>
<h1> Edward Colston’s history as a slave trader ‘irrelevant’, statue-toppling trial hears </h1>
<p> Supporters wave banners as the accused arrived at court, while a statue of King William III in Queen Square is found vandalised </p>
<div> <div> By Izzy Lyons, Crime Correspondent <time> 13 December 2021 • 2:03pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Edward Colston’s history as a slave trader is “wholly irrelevant” to the trial of four protesters accused of toppling his statue, jurors have been told.</p>
<p>Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, Jake Skuse, 33, and Sage Willoughby, 22, are accused of pulling the Colston statue off a plinth before <a>throwing it into Bristol Harbour</a> during a Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstration in June last year.</p>
<a>“remains a divisive figure”</a> the trial “is not about the justification or the vilification of him”.
<p>The prosecution argued that the four defendants were part of a “criminal enterprise with others” that toppled the bronze memorial before spitting on it, covering it in paint and rolling it 520 metres into Bristol Harbour.</p>
<h2>Damage estimated at £3,750</h2>
<p>An estimated £3,750 of damage was done to the statue - including losing its staff and a coat tail - but the council has decided not to restore it, while £350 of damage was done to the railings of a nearby bridge.</p>
<p>Mr Hughes QC said that around 10,000 people had been at the BLM march on 7 June 2020 and police described it as “friendly, engaging and very much a community event with an emphasis on coming together to make a change”.</p>
<p>He said a small group peeled off the march and congregated around the statue after the majority of the crowd had passed by.</p>
<p>“It was pulled down by members of the small group who include the first three defendants - Ms Graham, Mr Ponsford and Mr Willoughby,” Mr Hughes said.</p>
<p>The jury was shown footage of Mr Graham, Mr Ponsford and Miss Willoughby allegedly passing ropes to one another to place around the statue’s neck.</p>
<p>Referring to the ropes, Mr Hughes QC said: “You may think that is suggestive of pre-planning the statue toppling.”</p>
<h2>Cheers from public gallery</h2>
<p>Mr Hughes QC said it is the prosecution’s case that who Colston was is “wholly irrelevant” to the issues jurors will have to decide in the case.</p>
<p>“The prosecution accepts that Edward Colston was and remains a divisive figure among the community of Bristol and beyond,” he told the court.</p>
<p>“It is common ground that he was a slaver and much of his fortune was built on the slave trade, and in later life he was something of a philanthropist.</p>
<p>“This prosecution is not about the justification of the vilification of him.”</p>
<p>He continued: “But for the defence this position is quite the contrary, the position is that it is relevant and this is something you will have to decide in due course.”</p>
<p>Colston’s statue, which was erected 170 years after his death in 1895, has since been placed in a museum in Bristol Harbour, near where it was toppled.</p>
<p>Mr Graham, of Colston Road, Bristol, Mr Ponsford, of Otter Close, Hampshire, Mr Skuse, of Farley Close, Bristol, and Miss Willoughby, of Gloucester Road, Bristol, all deny the charges and are on unconditional bail.</p>
<h2>Another Bristol statue vandalised ahead of trial</h2>
<p>A statue of King William III was found vandalised on Monday morning as the trial of four protesters accused of toppling the Edward Colston memorial got underway.</p>
<p>The statue of King William III in Queen Square in Bristol city centre, around 500 meters from where the Colston statue once stood, was found wrapped in red and white ‘fragile’ tape.</p>
<p>However, it was not clear on Monday who targeted the statue and why.</p>
<p>On Monday, a group known as the “Colston Four” were greeted by dozens of supporters waving banners as they arrived for the start of their eight-day trial.</p>
<p>Among the signs being held outside the court were messages including “we’re glad not to see Colston on a pedestal anymore” and “solidarity with the Colston statue topplers.”</p>
<header> <h1> Headteacher of school founded by slave trader Edward Colston says he refuses to 'obscure history' by changing its name </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Camilla Turner, Education Editor <time> 2 November 2017 • 5:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The headteacher of a leading girls’ school founded by the slave trader Edward Colston said he refuses to “obscure history” by changing its name. </p>
<p>John Whitehead, principal of Colston’s Girls’ School in Bristol, told parents that the school will be keeping its name because there is “no benefit” in “denying the school’s financial origin”.</p>
<p>He said it is important for pupils to “engage thoughtfully” with the past, rather than attempt to brush it out altogether.</p>
<p>In a letter to parents, Mr Whitehead said: “It has been suggested that Colston’s Girls’ School should change its name in order to remove the association with Edward Colston.</p>
<p>"We have considered this suggestion and we have listened carefully to views on both sides. After much discussion, it has been agreed that it would not be appropriate to rename the school."</p>
<p>“To the contrary, by enabling our students to engage thoughtfully with our past, we continue to encourage them to ask questions about present-day moral values and to stand up for what they believe is right.”</p>
<div> <div> <p>Colston has been celebrated as one of Bristol's major philanthropists, and part of his huge fortune was used for a number of philanthropic projects, including the building of schools, almshouses and churches.</p> </div> </div>
<p>In 1710, Colston set up a school for "100 poor boys", then handed over the management of the school and his endowment to the Society of Merchant Venturers of Bristol.</p>
<p>In 1873 it was proposed that a portion of the endowment should be set aside for a day school for girls and in 1891 Colston's Girls' School opened for 300 pupils.</p>
<p>Last month the school, which is one of the best girls' schools in Bristol, stripped all mention of Colston from an annual service in his honour and instead said it will acknowledge the "damage done by slavery".</p>
<p>Officials at the school ruled there will be no mention of Edward Colston at his Commemoration Day service at Bristol Cathedral. Traditionally the service has involved present and former students wearing a chrysanthemum, Colston's flower.</p>
<p>But this year the service, which is will take place this month, the girls will no longer be required to wear the flower.</p>
<p>Colston Hall, Bristol’s concert hall, recently announced it will change its name as part of a rebranding in 2020. Meanwhile Colston’s Primary School is holding a consultation with its parents over whether it should change its name.</p>
<p>The row over Colston's legacy has echoes of the "Rhodes Must Fall" campaign, in which students in Oxford demanded the removal of a statue to the British colonialist Cecil Rhodes erected at Oriel College.</p>
<p>Oxford University refused to give into calls from campaigners, but the so-called “Rhodes effect” prompted a string of student movements calling for universities to sever ties with individuals and objects associated with colonialism.</p>
<p>Jesus College at Cambridge University took down a bronze cockerel statue which had been looted during a British colonial expedition to Nigeria in the 19th century, after students asked for it to be repatriated.</p>
<p>And Queen Mary University of London removed a foundation stone laid by King Leopold II amid student complaints that he was a “genocidal colonialist”.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, students at the University of Bristol have demanded that one of the city’s most famous landmarks, the Wills Memorial Tower, be renamed due to its alleged links to the slave trade.</p>
<header> <h1> Statue of slave trader Edward Colston pulled down and thrown into harbour by Bristol protesters </h1> <p> Bronze memorial had stood in city centre since 1895 </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Martin Evans, CRIME CORRESPONDENT <time> 7 June 2020 • 10:15pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Police in Bristol are hunting a mob who toppled a 125-year-old statue of the slave trader, Edward Colston, before dumping it in the harbour during a Black Lives Matter march.</p>
<p>The incident came as an estimated 10,000 people gathered in the city to demonstrate against the killing in the United States in police custody of the unarmed black man, George Floyd.</p>
<p>After marching to the statue, which has been at the centre of a long running debate in Bristol, the protestors attached ropes to the bronze figure before pulling it from its stone pedestal.</p>
<p>Cheering loudly and dancing on the figure the group, many of whom were white, then dragged it to the nearby quay where it was thrown into the water.</p>
<p>Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, condemned the actions of the group and said such acts of vandalism were a “distraction from the cause in which people are actually protesting about”.</p>
<p>One demonstrator was photographed leaning on the statue's neck with his knee in an imitation of the choke hold used by US police against George Floyd last month.</p>
<p>Avon and Somerset Police superintendent Andy Bennett said 10,000 people had attended the Black Lives Matter demonstration in Bristol and the majority did so "peacefully".</p>
<p>But he added officers would be seeking to identify protesters who pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston.</p>
<p>"An investigation will be carried out to identify those involved and we're already collating footage of the incident," he said.</p>
<p>“So once it was down we made a decision the right thing to was to allow it to happen because what we did not want is tension.”</p>
<p>Colston's likeness had been the subject of an 11,000-strong petition to have it removed.</p>
<p>Protestor John McAllister, 71, tore down black bin bags used to hide the statue to denounce it in front of fellow protesters, before a rope was tied around it and used to pull it down.</p>
<p>Mr McAllister said: "It says 'erected by the citizens of Bristol, as a memorial to one of the most virtuous and wise sons of this city'.</p>
<p>"The man was a slave trader. He was generous to Bristol but it was off the back of slavery and it's absolutely despicable. It's an insult to the people of Bristol."</p>
<p>Edward Colston was involved in the Royal African Company, a trading company that was engaged in the slave trade in the 17th century.</p>
<p>The company is thought to have transported around 84,000 African men, women and children in the time Colston was involved.</p>
<p>Around 19,000 died on their journey to the Caribbean and the Americas. </p>
<p>In London a second day of protests saw Winston Churchill’s statue defaced with the word ‘racist’ daubed across the plinth.</p>
<p>Thousands of demonstrators ignored coronavirus health warnings for a second day to gather in towns and cities across the UK including London, Manchester and Bristol.</p>
<p>Metropolitan Police said 12 people were arrested and eight officers injured during Sunday's anti-racism demonstrations in central London.</p>
<p>Most of the arrests were related to public order offences while one was for criminal damage following an incident at the Cenotaph.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening, Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: "People have a right to protest peacefully while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.</p>
<p>"These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve.</p>
<p>"Those responsible will be held to account."</p>
<p>It comes after Scotland Yard said 29 people were arrested and 14 officers were injured during clashes between police and protesters the day before.</p>
<p>On Saturday a largely peaceful march tuned ugly when a mob attacked police officers outside Downing Street.</p>
<p>They threw missiles including bicycles at mounted police officers and one female officer was badly hurt when her horse bolted and careered into a traffic light.</p>
<p>Almost 30 police officers have been hurt in recent days and the Met Commissioner, Cressida Dick, said the number of assaults had been “shocking and completely unacceptable”.</p>

<header> <h1> Derek Chauvin sentenced to 22½ years for murder of George Floyd </h1> <p> Ahead of the judgment, the former police officer spoke directly to the Floyd family to offer condolences for his death for the first time </p> </header>

<p>Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22½ years in prison on Friday night for the killing of George Floyd, whose death <a>sparked a global protest movement</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of the judgment, Chauvin <a>broke his silence</a> to speak directly to the Floyd family as he offered his "condolences" for the 46-year-old’s death for the first time.</p>
<p>There were mixed responses from the hundreds of people who had gathered outside the Hennepin County District Court in Minneapolis to hear the sentence, with some shouting "no justice" as they heard the news.</p>
<p>But the Floyd family called it a "historic" sentence that would bring the "nation one step closer to healing by delivering closure and accountability".</p>
<p>As he delivered the sentence, Judge Peter Cahill said his decision was not based on "public opinion" but did acknowledge the "tremendous pain" Mr Floyd's killing had caused, in particular to his family.</p>
<p>The sentence is almost 10 years longer than the presumptive sentence for Chauvin's most serious offence, second-degree murder.</p>
<p>Chauvin, a white former officer, was <a>convicted of murder and manslaughter in April</a> after he was filmed last year kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as he gasped "I can't breathe".</p>
<p>The footage of the fatal arrest in Minneapolis led to intense scrutiny of systemic racism in policing in the US and across the globe in a case that has come to be seen as a turning point for police accountability.</p>
<p>Chauvin's conviction is the longest ever received by a former police officer in such a case, according to Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison, who led the prosecution.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had demanded a 30-year prison term, saying "his conduct shocked the nation's conscience".</p>
<p>Chauvin's lawyer, Eric Nelson, had requested a probation, urging the judge to consider mitigating factors, saying "he's not coming into this as a career criminal".</p>
<p>He also noted that thousands had written in support of the former officer.</p>
<p>With good behaviour, Chauvin will serve two thirds of the sentence behind bars and the rest on parole, meaning he is likely to spend at least 15 years in jail.</p>
<p>He added cryptically: "There's going to be some information in the future that would be of interest, and I hope things would give you some peace of mind".</p>
<p>Four members of the Floyd family also addressed the court to deliver victim impact statements.</p>
<p>Floyd's seven-year-old daughter, Gianna, appeared via video to tell the court she missed playing with her father. "We used to have dinner every single night before we went to bed. My daddy always used to help me brush my teeth," she said.</p>
<p>Asked what she would say to her father if she could, she replied: "I miss him all the time... I love him."</p>
<p>Chauvin met his gaze but appeared expressionless behind the face mask he was wearing because of Covid restrictions.</p>
<p>A second brother, Philonise Floyd, wept as he asked Judge Cahill to give "the maximum sentence possible". "My family has been given a life sentence," he said.</p>
<p>Chauvin's mother, Carolyn Pawlenty, spoke publicly for the first time to plead for leniency for her son. She said the public image of her son had been reduced to a "racist", but was "far from the truth".</p>
<p>"Derek has played over and over in his head the events of that day. I've seen the toll it has taken on him," she said.</p>
<p>She told the judge: "I believe a lengthy sentence will not serve him well. When you sentence my son, you will also be sentencing me."</p>
<p>The crowd gathered outside the courthouse shook their heads as she spoke, noting she had made no reference to Mr Floyd.</p>
<p>Asked his reaction to the sentence, President Joe Biden said: "I don’t know all the circumstances that were considered but it seems to me, under the guidelines, that seems to be appropriate."</p>
<p>Outside court, Mr Floyd's partner, Courteney Ross, told The Telegraph she felt "disappointment" that Chauvin did not receive a higher sentence. </p>
<p>"But I thank everyone who rallied and protested and fought laws in order for this day to come because if it weren't for them it might not even be a day that Derek Chauvin faced in jail," she said. "It's a beginning," she added.</p>
<p>Activists outside the court said Chauvin’s sentence had spurred them on to further action as they marched through the streets on Friday night.</p>
<p>“To say that we are disappointed in this sentence is an in an understatement. It’s simply not enough,” said Michelle Gross from Communities United Against Police Brutality. </p>
<p>She added that urgent police reform legislation was now needed in Minnesota.</p>
<p>Jerrode Johnson, a Minneapolis resident, said he was frustrated by the disparity between Chauvin's sentence and those of many African Americans. </p>
<p>"You've got drug dealers who are getting 30 [years] to life, but he killed a human being and they gave him 20 years," he said. "Justice has kind of been served, but I think he should have got more personally". </p>
<p>Chauvin's sentence may increase when he faces further federal charges over Mr Floyd's death. </p>
<p>Three other officers involved in the fatal arrest, J Alexander Keung, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, will face trial on separate charges in March 2022. </p>

<header> <h1> Intervening to prevent toppling of Colston statue could have sparked a riot, says Chief Constable </h1> <p> Police have admitted they took a tactical decision to allow the incident to take place </p> </header>

<p>Police in Bristol have said they did not intervene to prevent the toppling of the controversial Edward Colston statue in order to prevent further violence that could have ramifications across the country.</p>
<p>Critics hit out at Avon and Somerset Police after they said they had taken a 'tactical decision' to allow a mob to pull down the statue of the 17th Century slave trader and throw it in the city's dock.</p>
<p>But Andy Marsh, Chief Constable of the force defended the decision insisting had his officers tried to stop it happening, it could have sparked widespread violence in Bristol and beyond.</p>
<p>"Midway through the protest we saw CCTV images in our control room of people, protesters on top of the Colston statue. Within two minutes that statue had been pulled down.</p>
<p>"We had deployed officers to respond to take appropriate action, but the commanders on the ground made the decision that to intervene, to arrest suspects would likely lead to injuries to suspects, injuries to officers.</p>
<p>"People who were not involved in damaging property being drawn into a very violent confrontation with police that could have had serious ramifications for the city of Bristol and beyond.</p>
<p>"Can you imagine scenes of police in Bristol fighting with protesters who were damaging the image, the statue of a man who is reputed to have gathered much of his fortune through the slave trade?</p>
<p>Critics had condemned the approach and Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, said the actions of the mob had been “utterly disgraceful”.</p>
<p>John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation said the decision not to act sent a "negative essage".</p>
<p>He said: "I understand there has been a lot of controversy about this statue for many years - so the question is why didn't those in the local authority consider taking it down long before rather than waiting for these actions?"</p>
<p>He added: "I am a police officer so I don't support this lawlessness we saw where this statue was ripped down and rolled down the street and pushed into the river because that is not how we do things.</p>
<p>"I understand the anger but not to have a police presence there was something - I have been a police officer for 27 years - that was a decision I have not seen taken before."</p>
<p>But policing minister, Kit Malthouse said he understood why officers had taken the decision not to intervene.</p>
<p>In London 35 police officers were injured over the weekend when demonstrations against the killing of George Floyd in the United States turned violent.</p>
<p>Mr Malthouse said: “Police officers in a public order situation have to bear in mind all sorts of factors, not least the safety of their officers and the wider duty they have towards public safety before they intervene in a crowd.</p>
