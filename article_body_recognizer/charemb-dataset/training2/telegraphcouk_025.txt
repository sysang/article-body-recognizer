<header> <h1> Tory lockdown rebels unite to form Covid Recovery Group </h1> <p> Mark Harper and Steve Baker are the chairman and deputy chairman of the new Covid Recovery Group, which launched on Tuesday </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent <time> 10 November 2020 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Dozens of Conservative MPs have formed a new backbench group to fight the imposition of a third national lockdown at the beginning of next month, The Telegraph can disclose.</p>
<p>Former Government Chief Whip Mark Harper and former Brexit Minister Steve Baker are the chairman and deputy chairman of the new Covid Recovery Group, which launches on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, has pledged that MPs will be given a vote on the next set of restrictions in England <a>which will replace the national lockdown when it ends on Dec 2</a>.</p>
<p>By last night, 50 Tory MPs had formally joined the anti-lockdown group, with another 45 MPs considering membership after joining a special WhatsApp group to coordinate the work of the group.</p>
<p>The group will be seen in Westminster as an echo of the European Research Group, a grouping of Tory MPs who were successfully whipped by Mr Baker to oppose Theresa May's Brexit deal in the last Parliament.</p>
<p>It will also be considered a response from backbench Conservative MPs to the decision by Nigel Farage to apply to the Electoral Commission to rebrand his Brexit Party as a new anti-lockdown party called Reform UK.</p>
<a>series of regional lockdowns after the national restrictions end on Dec 2</a>. But the group will be a headache for Mr Johnson if he tries to pursue a third national lockdown, and needs Labour votes to pass it through the Commons.
<p>Backbench Tory MPs were infuriated last week to be <a>asked to vote for the national lockdown based on inflated death forecasts, which then were quietly revised down after the lockdown came into force</a>.</p>
<ul> <li><a>Mark Harper: Lockdowns cost lives - we need a different strategy to fight Covid-19</a></li> </ul>
<p>He added: "We are all hoping that the positive developments this week lead to a safe and effective vaccine being rolled out across the population in the next six months.</p>
<p>"In the meantime we need some much needed balance in this debate, to avoid further lockdowns and unnecessary restrictions, and to start living in a sustainable way until we get there."</p>
<p>The new group is publishing three "Guiding Principles" on Wednesday that will be "governing its instincts ahead of the vote about what happens when the lockdown ends on Dec 2", it said.</p>
<p>The chief demand is that ministers undertake and publish a full cost-benefit analysis of restrictions on a regional basis looking at the economic and health costs of a lockdown.</p>
<p>They say: "MPs must be in a position to assess the relative health implications on both sides of the argument of repeated restrictions, with a view to removing them immediately if it cannot be proved that they are saving more lives than they cost."</p>
<p>MPs in the Covid Recovery Group come from a number of wings and intakes of the Conservative Party. Lockdown rebels such as William Wragg and Sir Robert Syms are on the steering group.</p>
<p>“The country is crying out for a radically different and enduring strategy for living with the virus and the Covid Recovery Group will assist the government in leading the UK out of the Covid crisis and into a positive future.”</p>
<header> <h1> Conservative Party manifesto: What are Boris Johnson's policies and NHS plans? </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Anna Mikhailova, Deputy Political Editor ; Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent ; Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor and Danielle Sheridan, Political Correspondent <time> 14 December 2019 • 10:42am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Boris Johnson launched the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto, with the slogan Get Brexit Done, Unleash Britain's Potential. The 59-page manifesto was released 18 days before yesterday's general election vote. </p>
<p>Speaking at its launch in Telford, Shropshire, the prime minister said the choice facing the country in this "closely fought" contest had "never been starker".</p>
<p>Here is an at-a-glance looks at the key commitments:</p>
<h3>The NHS and social care </h3>
<li>50,000 extra nurses to be recruited</li>
<li>50 million extra GP appointments a year </li>
<li>£34 billion extra funding a year for NHS</li>
<li>Cross-party agreement sought to solve social care crisis</li>
<li>Free hospital parking for selected patients and staff</li>
<p>An extra 50,000 nurses would be recruited into the NHS to combat acute shortages under a Conservative Government.</p>
<p>The manifesto also pledges to reintroduce annual bursaries of up to £8,000 after they were axed four years ago to help pay for nurses’ living costs during training.</p>
<p>The figure is double Labour’s pledge of 24,000 nurses and would cover the current vacancy gap of more than 43,000 nurses.</p>
<p>Some 14,000 of the 50,000 would be new undergraduate nurses, a quarter would be from abroad recruited through a new fast-track visa and 5,000 would be degree apprenticeships.</p>
<p>The remainder would come from extra retention achieved through funding for professional training, childcare for people wanting to return, and new forms of "management support.”</p>
<p>Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, yesterday declined to say whether the Conservatives made a mistake by axeing nurse bursaries but he acknowledged there was a need to provide "incentives".</p>
<p>The nurses are in addition to 6,000 more doctors in GP surgeries and 6,000 more primary care staff such as physiotherapists and pharmacists promised in the manifesto.</p>
<p>The Conservatives say new staff should enable the NHS to deliver 50 million more appointments a year in GP surgeries, an increase of more than 15 per cent.</p>
<p>But it ducks any radical proposals to reform social care, policy which proved so damaging for Theresa May in 2017.</p>
<p>It pledges an extra £1 billion of funding every year for more social care staff and better infrastructure, together with a new entitlement to an extra week of leave for people who care unpaid for loved ones, most of whom are women.</p>
<p>However, the search for a long-term solution is left to what can be agreed through a cross-party consensus with a “prerequisite” that “no-one needing care has to sell their home to pay for it,” according to the manifesto.</p>
<p>Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Affairs, said: “One notable omission is any plan for social care. </p>
<p>“In his first speech as prime minister Boris Johnson promised to ‘fix the crisis in social care once and for all’. After two decades of dither by both parties in government it seems we are no further forward.”</p>
<p>A green paper on social care has been delayed several times by the Government but Mr Hancock said on Sunday: "What I want to do is sit down with other parties and come up with a long-term solution that really sticks."</p>
<p>The manifesto also pledged to cut NHS waiting times for operations and AE waiting times - both of which are currently at the worst ever level - and improve cancer survival.</p>
<p>The manifesto pledges to sort out NHS pensions, which have led to rising waiting lists as senior doctors cut their hours in the face of hefty tax bills. “Within our first 30 days, we will hold an urgent review,” it says.</p>
<p>Mental health will be treated with the same urgency as physical with new laws to give patients suffering mental ill health given greater control over their treatment.</p>
<p>A crackdown on health tourism will ensure overseas patients pay their “fair share” and the NHS surcharge paid by those from abroad will be increased.</p>
<li>Increasing National Insurance threshold to £9,500 next year, with the "ultimate ambition" to raise to £12,500</li>
<li>Scrapping plan to cut corporation tax from 19% to 17% - Increasing employment allowance for small businesses, to raise up to £500m a year</li>
<li>Reduce national insurance contributions for companies that employ veterans</li>
<p>By AThe Conservatives have abandoned plans to deliver sweeping tax cuts as they promised not to “gamble with taxpayers’ money.”</p>
<p>Boris Johnson’s promise, made when he ran for Tory leader, to raise the threshold at which people pay 40 per cent income tax from £50,000 to £80,000 did not make it into the manifesto.</p>
<p>The Conservatives also did not include any cuts to stamp duty or inheritance tax.</p>
<p>Instead the party has committed to a “triple lock" on taxes, which will mean no increases in income tax, national insurance and VAT for five years.</p>
<p>The manifesto says: “This is a tax guarantee that will protect the incomes of hard-working families across the next Parliament.”</p>
<p>The government has also scrapped a planned cut to corporation tax from 19 per cent to 17 per cent, which will be used to fund spending increases for public services. The policy will raise £6bn a year by 2023.</p>
<p>Asked why he has abandoned his pledge to deliver income tax cuts, Mr Johnson insisted he has not “lost any tax-cutting zeal.”</p>
<p>“That’s why we’re cutting taxes on National Insurance, which helps every taxpayer in the country. That’s why we’ve raised the personal allowance.</p>
<p>The pledge to lift the 40 pc income tax threshold would have cost the Treasury about £8 billion, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the economic think tank.</p>
<p>Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation, another think tank, said: “Brexit is happening, but big tax cuts aren’t. That is the short version of an already very short Conservative manifesto.</p>
<p>He added: “Surprisingly this is actually a tax raising manifesto as both these tax cuts and proposals for £3 billion of extra day-to-day spending are paid for by scrapping a planned £6 billion cut to Corporation Tax.</p>
<p>The figures are based on the March economic forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said the triple lock policy is a "pretty disappointing kind of promise.”</p>
<p>He added: "It's tying the hands of the Chancellor for the next five years in terms of the most obvious increases that you could put into place if you wanted transparently to raise more money."</p>
<li>£4 billion for new flood defences</li>
<li>£9.2 billion for energy efficiency measures in schools, hospitals and 2.2 million homes</li>
<li>Export of plastic to non-OECD countries banned</li>
<li>Ban on gas boilers in new homes from next year</li>
<li>2 million new green jobs in next decade</li>
<li>Net zero carbon emissions by 2050 </li>
<p>A £4 billion cash injection for new flood defences is pledged in the manifesto as a “priority” after criticism of Boris Johnson’s Government for its slow response to this month’s floods in the north of England.</p>
<p>The money will be part of the extra £100 billion infrastructure spending and will be a priority in the first Budget of a new Conservative Government, according to the manifesto.</p>
<p>About 5.4m properties in England are at risk of flooding from rivers, the sea and surface water. Annual flood damage costs the country an estimated £1.1bn.</p>
<p>Some £6.3 billion of that will be used to instal energy saving measures to cut bills in 2.2 million homes largely in disadvantaged areas and social housing.</p>
<p>The plans are designed to meet the legal target to cut greenhouse emissions to zero overall by 2050 to tackle climate change.</p>
<p>It is less ambitious than other parties, with the Lib Dems promising net zero emissions by 2045 and Labour pledging to deliver the substantial majority of greenhouse cuts in the 2030s.</p>
<p>Among other measures are ban on gas boilers from all newly-built homes from next year, rushing it forward from the original 2025 for outlawing central heating systems based on fossil fuels.</p>
<p>The export of plastic waste to non-OECD countries will be banned, while a new levy will be introduced to increase the proportion of recyclable plastics in packaging. </p>
<p>Penalties for fly-tipping will be increased, those on community sentences will be made to clean up parks and streets and a deposit return scheme will be introduced for plastic and glass.</p>
<p>A new independent Office For Environmental Protection would introduce own legal targets, including for air quality, while an extra £1 billion is pledged to encourage mass production of electric cars.</p>
<h3>Childcare and education </h3>
<li>An extra £1billion to fund summer holiday care for 250,000 children</li>
<li>A new arts premium to invest in arts, music and sport in secondary schools "to fund enriching activities for all pupils"</li>
<li>More new free schools but the ban on new grammar schools will not be lifted</li>
<p>An extra £1 billion for after-school and holiday childcare was pledged by Boris Johnson yesterday "so that working parents do not have to choose between their careers and their children".</p>
<p>The party's manifesto said that the cash would provide help with childcare for 250,000 more primary school children during the summer holidays to lift a "heavy burden"from working parents.</p>
<p>The party's manifesto said: "Raising a family should be the most fulfilling experience of your life. But for too many parents, the costs of childcare are a heavy burden. </p>
<p>"We want to give parents the freedom, support and choice to look after their children in the way that works best for them.</p>
<p>"We will establish a new £1 billion fund to help create more high quality, affordable childcare, including before and after school and during the school holidays."</p>
<p>It added: "We will fund more high-quality childcare before and after school and during the holidays so that working parents do not have to choose between their careers and their children.</p>
<p>"It is one in which a deep commitment to entrepreneurship and business is matched by a desire to ensure that the jobs that are created are highly skilled, well-paid and fulfilling."</p>
<p>Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister and Conservative leader, said: "We will also support those with children who are training with money for childcare costs."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the manifesto a previous commitment from the 2017 manifesto to lift the ban on new grammar schools was dropped.</p>
<p>Instead the party pledged to "back heads and teachers on discipline" and to help teachers to tackle bullying "to help schools with the worst behaviour learn from the best".</p>
<p>In addition, there was a commitment to invest in arts, music and sport, including offering an "arts premium" to secondary schools. This premium would be used "to fund enriching activities for all pupils", the document said.</p>
<p>On student finance, there was a commitment to look at interest rates on student loans, but there was no firm promise to cut university tuition fees.</p>
<li>Continue to exceed Nato target of 2 per cent of GDP on defence and increase defence spending by at least 0.5 per cent every year of new parliament </li>
<li>Modernise equipment </li>
<li>Invest in training and equipping Armed Forces</li>
<li>Maintain Trident </li>
<li>Invest more in cybersecurity </li>
<li>Set up UK's first Space Command </li>
<p>Defence spending will rise by 0.5 per cent above inflation every year under a Tory government, the manifesto pledges, as the secretary of state insisted the armed forces will not be cut. </p>
<p>The Government has pledged to continue to exceed the Nato target of 2 per cent of GDP, as it said that “the security of our nation comes first”. </p>
<p>As well as modernising army equipment it said it will invest in training and equipping the UK’s Armed Forces. </p>
<p>It pledged to maintain our Trident nuclear deterrent, as well as adapting to new threats such as cyber warfare and establishing the UK’s first Space Command. </p>
<p>It comes after Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, was forced to dismiss reports that funding for troops was going to be cut as “total rubbish”.</p>
<p>“There are no plans to shrink the Army,” he said. </p>
<p>“In fact my direction to the Army has been to improve recruiting and retention levels.”</p>
<p>"We believe in our armed services, I travel around the world and they are loved,” he added.</p>
<p>It comes after The Telegraph revealed that the Prime Minister risked losing the veterans’ vote if he failed to protect soldiers from historic prosecutions. </p>
<p>The manifesto added that it would introduce new legislation to “tackle the vexatious legal claims that undermind our Armed Forces and further incorporate the Armed Forces Covenant into law”. </p>
<li>MPs will start to vote on Boris Johnson's Brexit deal before Christmas</li>

<li>The Human Rights Act will be updated to ensure "a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government”</li>
<p>Brexit will "unleash the potential of the whole country" and help "to forge a new Britain" if voters return a majority Conservative government, Boris Johnson said yesterday.</p>
<p>Speaking at a launch event for the party's general election manifesto in Telford, he reaffirmed his commitment to take the UK out of the EU and "get Brexit done" by the end of January to "end the acrimony and the chaos".</p>
<p>The party's general election manifesto said that leaving the EU would allow the UK to "release that lion from its cage and take this amazing country forwards".</p>
<p>Brexit was mentioned 61 times in the party's manifesto, more than tax and the NHS and three times more than the 21 Brexit references in Labour's policy document, published last week.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson's Brexit deal was "signed, sealed and ready" to be implemented. It would "keep the UK out of the single market, out of any form of customs union, and end the role of the European Court of Justice".</p>
<p>The deal would begin its passage through Parliament shortly after MPs return to work in the week before Christmas.</p>
<p>A trade deal with the EU would be agreed next year while the implementation period following the UK's exit at the end of December would not be extended.</p>
<div> <div> <p>However there was no mention of the UK leaving at the end of 2020 without agreeing a trade deal in contrast with the 2017 manifesto which said "no deal is better than a bad deal for the UK".</p> </div> </div>
<p>Mr Johnson peppered his speech with criticism of his Labour rival Jeremy Corbyn over his decision to remain neutral in a second referendum saying: "He used to be indecisive – now he’s not so sure."</p>
<p>A Tory Government would "aim to have 80 per cent of UK trade covered by free trade agreements within the next three years, starting with the USA, Australia, New Zealand and Japan", the manifesto said.</p>
<p>The deals would be "negotiated in parallel with our EU deal" while the UK would seek to "forge stronger links with the Commonwealth ... with which we already share deep historical and cultural connections". </p>
<p>One of the key pledges was to ensure that new freeports can benefit all the four nations of the UK so that they will all have "the opportunity to be successful innovative hubs for global trade". </p>
<p>The manifesto said: "We will create up to ten freeports around the UK, benefiting some of our most deprived communities."</p>
<p>Leaving the EU would also allow the UK to "introduce a firmer and fairer Australian-style points-based immigration system" to give the Government "real control over who is coming in and out".</p>
<p>While migrants would be required to "contribute to the NHS – and pay in before they can receive benefits" there was a Tory pledge to bring down migrations to a net tens of thousands every year was dropped.</p>
<p>The manifesto said: "There will be fewer lower-skilled migrants and overall numbers will come down. And we will ensure that the British people are always in control."</p>
<p>The Conservatives also pledged to get rid of the Fixed Term Parliaments Act which was repeatedly used by MPs to stop him calling the election because it caused “paralysis at a time the country needed decisive action”. </p>
<p>The manifesto also that a Constitution, Democracy Rights Commission will look at the relationship between the Government, Parliament and the courts and establish proposals that restore trust in UK institutions and how democracy operates</p>
<p>The Government would also seek to update the Human Rights Act to “ensure that there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government”. </p>
<ul> <li>Pensions triple lock</li> <li>Older Person's bus pass</li> <li>Winter fuel payment </li> <li>TV licences for the over-75s</li> </ul>
<p>In a bid to win over pensioners the manifesto has promised a pensions triple lock and to continue the winter fuel payment and Older Person's bus pass.</p>
<p>The triple lock guarantees state pensions rise each year by either wage growth, inflation, or a 2.5 per cent increase. </p>
<p>It means the basic state pension is worth £106.8 a year more than it would have been if only a “double lock”, based purely on earnings and prices, had been applied. </p>
<p>In the manifesto the Conservatives say the lock was introduced because the Government wanted “those who have worked hard and put in for decades can be confident that the state will be there to support them when they need it”. </p>
<p>On the subject of free TV licences for the over-75s the manifesto added that while it recognised "the value" of the service it believed that it should be funded by the BBC. </p>
<p>It comes after the broadcaster announced in June that it would scrap the free licences, with the exception of low-income households, and would instead make them pay the annual £154.50 fee. </p>
<p>The manifesto added that the above benefits would ensure “older people have the security and dignity they deserve”. </p>
<h3>Policing and crime </h3>
<li>20,000 extra police officers</li>
<li>Longer sentences for violent and sex offenders</li>
<li>Extra 10,000 prison places</li>
<li>Faster, tougher sentencing for knife offenders</li>
<li>Life sentences for child murderers</li>
<li>Tougher community sentences</li>
<p>Tougher community sentences will see offenders put to work cleaning up parks and streets, under law and order plans in the manifesto that confirm a big boost to police numbers and longer sentences for violent criminals.</p>
<p>The manifesto says a Conservative Government would toughen community sentences by tightening curfews and “making those convicted do more hours of community payback to clean up our parks and streets.”</p>
<p>Better protection for police officers - including an expansion of tasers and body worn video - is promised alongside confirmation of the recruitment of 20,000 additional police officers over the next three years.</p>
<p>A Conservative Government would also consult on increasing the maximum prison sentence for assaulting an officer from six months to a year, while a police covenant would be enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Increased powers for police to stop and search known knife offenders and bring them to court quicker “within days, not weeks,” are also confirmed, with the manifesto stating: "Those who use a knife as a weapon should go to prison."</p>
<li>Day-to-day spending boost for public services - £1.5bn in 2020-21, rising to £2.9bn in 2023-24</li>
<li>Borrow £100bn over five years to fund longer-term infrastructure projects</li>
<li>Of this, £22bn allocated over the next five years</li>
<p>Labour will spend £28 for every extra £1 the Tories spend, Boris Johnson’s manifesto has revealed.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has pledged to boost day-to-day spending on public services by £1.5bn in 2020, rising to £2.9bn by the end of the next Parliament.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson also confirmed plans to borrow £100bn more over five years for longer-term investment as part of a manifesto pledge to deliver a “transport revolution”.</p>
<p>Of this, £22bn was allocated on funding pledges including potholes, hospital car parks and research and development.</p>
<div> <div> <p>This month Sajid Javid, the Chancellor, announced new fiscal rules, which would allow him to both borrow more to invest in infrastructure while still balancing the budget by 2022-23. </p> </div> </div>
<p>In the manifesto, Mr Javid said he would not “gamble with taxpayers’ money or this country’s economic future.”</p>
<p>The manifesto repeated the pledge and says: “We will not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, but will invest thoughtfully and responsibly in infrastructure right across our country in order to increase productivity and wages.”</p>
<p>It adds: “This means that debt will be lower at the end of the Parliament – rather than spiralling out of control under Labour. And we will use this investment prudently.”</p>
<p>Mr Javid stressed he would not allow spending to get out of control, and said: “We will never risk our economy and undermine the hard work of the British people with reckless plans for spending, borrowing and spiralling debt.”</p>
<p>He also said the £22bn boost to infrastructure spending is “far smaller than what would be permissible within the Conservatives stated fiscal targets.”</p>
<p>"And we're going to do that in a way that enhances the productive potential of the country, i a measured and thoughtful way.</p>
<p>"We would have to reassess our thinking if interest rates were to spike."</p>
<p>Mr Javid said the party has published “the most detailed, transparent and rigorous manifesto costings document ever of any party, in any General Election. We detail every new cost, and exactly how it will be met.”</p>
<p>This is then predicted to rise to £5.2bn - largely thanks to the saving from scrapping the corporation tax cut. The figures are based on the March economic forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility.</p>
<header> <h1> Energy bills 'will climb to £2,000' – here's how the price cap works </h1> <p> Tips and ideas on how to cut your bills </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Will Kirkman <time> 12 October 2021 • 8:43am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Energy firms could be allowed to charge households hundreds of pounds more next year with experts predicting bills to rise to more than £2,000.</p>
<p>Regulator Ofgem has signaled it will review how the energy price cap works after a surge in wholesale prices pushed suppliers to breaking point.</p>
<p><a>It is expected to rise again in April</a> and experts at Cornwall Insight, an energy market analysis firm, said it could climb by almost £400, even if Ofgem does not change how the cap is calculated.</p>
<p>Jonathan Brearley, chief executive of Ofgem, said there are no plans for the price cap on energy bills to rise before April, but warned that "<a>legitimate costs do have to be passed through</a>". </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Joe Malinowski, founder of price comparison website TheEnergyShop.com, predicted the rise could be anywhere from £500 to £800 – pushing the average bill to over £2,000 in a worst case scenario. </p>
<h2>How is the price cap set?</h2>
<p>Regulator Ofgem sets the price cap based on a "broad estimate" of how much it costs a supplier to provide gas and electricity services to a customer.</p>
<p>The calculation is mainly made up of wholesale energy costs, network costs such as maintaining pipes and wires, policy costs including Government social and environmental schemes, operating costs such as billing and metering services and VAT. </p>
<p>Dr. Craig Lowrey, of Cornwall Insight, said that in addition to spiraling wholesale prices, the cost of moving customers from failed suppliers to larger more stable one will also contribute to the price cap rising. </p>
<p>Failed suppliers will also be unable to pay industry levies, including low carbon levies, leaving surviving firms to pick up the bill, which will also contribute to the cap rising.</p>
<h2>How to protect yourself from rising bills</h2>
<p>If you are moved to a new supplier, or your fixed-term deal comes to an end, locking in to a new fixed-term deal could currently cost hundreds of pounds more than rolling on to the supplier's default tariff.</p>
<p>This means it is cheaper for the time being to remain on a default tariff, which is protected by the price cap, until better deals become available.</p>
<p>In some cases, <a>providers have hidden default tariffs from their websites</a>. This means customers may be unaware it would cost them less to simply roll on to their supplier's default tariff, rather than switch deals.</p>
<p>However, if the price cap were to climb by as much as £800, as Mr Malinowski warned, locking in to the cheapest deal now would save hundreds of pounds. This prediction is an outlier, however.</p>
<h2>What happens if my supplier goes bust?</h2>
<p>Gillian Cooper of Citizens Advice said: “If you’re a customer of a failed supplier, Ofgem will move you onto a different one. This can take a few weeks, but your gas and electricity supply will continue in the meantime. </p>
<p>"Your new supplier will contact you and it’s good to be prepared beforehand. Take a note of meter readings, keep old <a>energy bills</a> and make a note of your account balance. </p>
<p>"Wait until your new supplier is appointed before cancelling any direct debits. This should all make the transition easier.”</p>
<h1> How a rise in National Insurance contributions will impact workers, pensioners and businesses </h1>
<p> Boris Johnson’s £36bn tax raid to fund social care reforms will see retirees still in work being made to pay NI for first time </p>
<div> <div> By Harry Yorke, Whitehall Editor <time> 7 September 2021 • 8:54pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Pensioners still in work will be forced to pay National Insurance contributions (NIC) for the first time, as Boris Johnson announced a £36 billion tax raid to pay for his social care reforms.</p>
<p>As part of a new health and social care levy, which will come into effect from 2023, those still working past the state pension age will be asked to contribute 1.25 per cent on their earnings.</p>
<p>The change will impact 1.3 million working pensioners, according to official figures, who under the current tax system, stop making NICs when they reach 66, the state retirement age.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, economists suggested Mr Johnson had decided to include working pensioners in response to allegations that hiking NICs over income tax amounted to a raid on lower paid and younger workers to fund the care of wealthy older people.</p>
<p>Setting out the plans in Parliament, the Prime Minister told MPs that he recognised the raid <a>breached the Conservative manifesto pledge</a> not to raise NICs, income tax or VAT.</p>
<p>However, he insisted it was necessary due to the unforeseen impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the nation’s finances, while the Chancellor Rishi Sunak said tax rises were the only way to generate the necessary sums.</p>
<h3>How is the money being raised?</h3>
<p>Ministers will launch the tax raid from April 2022, when NI contributions are set to increase by 1.25 percentage points.</p>
<p>The rate of dividend tax, which is levied on income drawn from investments, will also be increased by the same amount.</p>
<p>According to the Government’s own estimates, the NICs hike will raise £11.4 billion annually while the dividend tax change will generate £0.6 billion, providing £36 billion in total over three years.</p>
<p>The majority of this revenue will then be channelled into clearing NHS backlogs, which have piled up during the pandemic, with just £5.4 billion <a>set aside for social care during this period</a>.</p>
<p>From 2023, the 1.25 percentage point rise will then be separated from NI and will appear as a separate entity on individuals’ pay slips as a health and social care levy.</p>
<p>The tax raid will impact everyone from shopworkers, freelance artists to company directors.</p>
<p>Under the planned increase to NICs, those earning more than £67,100 will have to pay an additional £715 more a year, while basic rate taxpayers earning £24,100 will contribute an extra £180.</p>
<p>Number 10 insists the burden will fall primarily on the wealthy, with 6.2 million people earning less than £9,568 not contributing to the levy, while the highest earning 14 per cent will pay around 50 per cent of the revenues.</p>
<p>The self-employed will also see a 1.25 percentage point rise, as will employers, who are required to make contributions, although small businesses will be largely shielded due to tax reliefs.</p>
<p>The Government will also increase the rate of dividends tax, which it says will ensure that company directors and contractors who fund their income through investment make the same contribution to the NHS and social care package.</p>
<p>From 2023, when the NICs increase becomes a standalone health and social care levy, pensioners in work will begin contributing for the first time.</p>
<p>However, Labour and tax experts have pointed out that under the plans, many landlords will avoid the increase.</p>
<p>This is because NICs are not levied on income from rental property, although Downing Street suggested that many landlords with multiple properties had incorporated into a company, meaning that they would likely be taxed more through dividends.</p>
<h3>How will the money be spent?</h3>
<p>Mr Johnson’s immediate focus is delivering a major cash injection to the NHS to help it clear the backlogs that have built up during the pandemic.</p>
<p>With more than 5.5 million people now waiting for non-emergency treatment, the majority of the £36 billion raised over the first three years will go towards the health service.</p>
<p>The remaining £5.3 billion will be spent on social care, almost half of which will go towards funding the new £86,000 cap on lifetime care costs.</p>
<p>The leftover funds will go towards improving the quality of care and enabling local authorities to pay higher fees to care providers.</p>
<p>The Government has said this will also end the system whereby self-funding residents pay significantly more in order to subsidise people funded by the state.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson has also promised to invest £500 million in the social care workforce, which is currently grappling with 100,000 staff vacancies, poor wages and significant issues with training and career progression.</p>
<p>From 2025 the additional funding will increasingly shift away from the NHS towards social care, although Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said it was too early to say how many billions of pounds in extra funding will be made available.</p>
<p>As part of the long-term plans for reform, the Government will also publish a white paper in the coming months which will set out how it intends to better integrate the NHS with social care.</p>
<h3>Backlash from business</h3>
<p>While the public fallout among Tory MPs was notably mooted on Tuesday night, the announcement was met with widespread condemnation from leading business groups, who have branded the NICs rise a “jobs tax”.</p>
<p>With UK firms already braced for a hike in corporation tax, several warned that the increase would hamper the economic recovery from Covid-19, while others suggested it would de-incentivise bosses from hiring new workers.</p>
<p>Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: “Businesses strongly oppose a rise in national insurance contributions as it will be a drag anchor on jobs growth at an absolutely crucial time.”</p>
<p>Lord Bilimoria, the president of the Confederation of British Industry, added: “Businesses accept difficult choices need to be made, but are already set to be hit by a substantial rise in corporation tax in 2023.</p>
<p>“After all that business has gone through during the pandemic and the fantastic Government support that followed, now is not the time for tax increases. It’s time to stimulate investment and growth in the economy.</p>
<p>"National Insurance increase will directly hurt a business's ability to hire staff, at a time when businesses have faced a torrid 18 months and are now fighting crippling labour shortages.”</p>
<h1> Boris Johnson announces National Insurance rise, including for pensioners, plus dividend tax increase </h1>
<p> No one will be required to pay more than £86,000 for social care in their lifetime, under reforms that will see a rise of 1.25pc points </p>
<div> <div> By Tony Diver, Political Correspondent <time> 7 September 2021 • 2:52pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Boris Johnson has announced a 1.25 percentage point tax hike to fund landmark reforms of England's adult social care system and a backlog of NHS appointments.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s announcement, which is the biggest shake-up of social care in decades, will provide means-tested social care funding for people with assets between £20,000 and £100,000 for the first time.</p>
<p>People with savings of more than £23,250 currently receive no support from the Government to pay for the cost of social care.</p>
<p>Those with savings of less than £20,000 will receive fully-funded care, while those with savings between £20,000 and £100,000 will be given partial support.</p>
<p>No one will be required to pay more than £86,000 for social care in their lifetime, under a new cap introduced from October 2023.</p>
<p>The reforms will be paid for with an <a>increase to national insurance,</a> which is levied on anyone who earns more than £9,564 per year. </p>
<p>He told MPs: "A universal system of free care for all would be needlessly expensive when those who can afford to contribute to their care should instead. </p>
<p>"The state should target itself, by protecting people against the catastrophic fear of losing everything, to pay for the cost of their care," he said.</p>
<p>The money raised will partially be diverted to the NHS until mid-2025, as £36 billion is funnelled to the health service to reduce backlogs and waiting lists created by the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Extra money will also be sent from Westminster to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which Mr Johnson said would receive more money they paid in, in a “union dividend”.</p>
<p>He said the announcement would launch the “biggest catchup programme in NHS history,” by “increasing hospital capacity to 110 per cent and enabling 9 million more appointments scans and operations”.</p>
<p>More money will also be spent on the training and hiring of care staff, while local authorities will receive an “uplift” in funding from central government they spend on care services.</p>
<p>The additional tax will also be levied on people who receive income from share dividends.</p>
<p>People who work after the state pension age will also be told to pay 1.25 per cent.</p>
<p>A typical basic-rate taxpayer will pay around £180 per year under the scheme, while higher rate taxpayers will pay £700.</p>
<p>The Government has been criticised for raising the additional revenue from national insurance contributions, which are levied on more low-paid workers.</p>
<p>The top 14 per cent of earners will pay around half of the cost, Mr Johnson’s spokesman said.</p>
<p>From April 2022, employees will begin to pay the levy through an increase in their national insurance contributions. From April 2023, the levy will be listed as an additional line in workers’ pay slips.</p>
<a>reduce the impact on individual workers’ salaries</a>. Income tax, which has been suggested as another way to raise additional tax revenue, is only levied on employees.
<p>It is understood that around 70 per cent of the additional costs for employers will come from the biggest 1 per cent of businesses.</p>
<p>Current rules on housing assets, which prevents people who receive care at home from having to sell their houses, will remain.</p>
<p>The Government will be required to pass legislation to bring forward its reforms.</p>
<p>But Mr Johnson is <a>facing a rebellion</a> from senior Tory backbenchers, who say the national insurance increase is a breach of the Conservative Party’s 2019 manifesto, which promised to keep contributions at current levels.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said he "accept[s] that this breaks a manifesto commitment, which is not something I do lightly".</p>
<p>"But a global pandemic was in no one's manifesto," he said. </p>
<p>Around half the Cabinet is thought to have objected to the proposals, but ministers not involved directly in the plans were not presented with the details until Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson’s spokesman described the mood in Cabinet as “positive”, and denied suggestions that the Prime Minister had used the spectre of a reshuffle to keep ministers in line.</p>
<p>Three former Tory chancellors and the former Conservative Prime Minister John Major have objected to the plans.</p>
<p>“On any basis, that has got to be wrong,” he told The Telegraph.</p>
<header> <h1> Tory MPs threatened to quit over National Insurance rise </h1> <p> Whips' office scrambled to head off rebellion from Red Wall MPs before Tuesday's vote in the Commons </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tony Diver, Political Correspondent ; Harry Yorke, Whitehall Editor and Lucy Fisher, Deputy Political Editor <time> 14 September 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>At least three rebel Conservative MPs threatened to resign from the Government over the decision to hike National Insurance to pay for social care, The Telegraph can reveal.</p>
<a>furious Red Wall MPs</a> and parliamentary private secretaries (PPSs) over the weekend to threaten their political careers, after they said they would rebel against the Government in Tuesday's National Insurance vote.
<p>Dozens of Conservatives could abstain or vote against Mr Johnson on Tuesday's bill, <a>which will increase National Insurance payments</a> for both employees and firms by 1.25 percentage points.</p>
<a>Red Wall Conservative MPs</a> who were elected in 2019 and have since taken jobs as PPSs, were understood to be on the brink of resignation over the weekend before No10 convinced them they should remain in post.
<p>PPSs are unpaid and are not members of the Government, but act as ministers’ informants on the back benches to gauge the mood of the party. They are required to support the Government in votes.</p>
<p>A third PPS is understood to have agreed to vote for the national insurance rise after they were told on Sunday morning that ministers <a>had decided to scrap plans for vaccine passports</a>.</p>
<p>Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, announced the scheme had been shelved less than two hours later on a broadcast round.</p>
<p>Two further PPSs had threatened to resign over vaccine passports, The Telegraph has been told.</p>
<p>“The whips have come across pretty hard to the PPSs and 2019 intake across the board and said: ‘You're not going anywhere if you don't vote for this’,” one MP said.</p>
<p>Another described Downing Street’s whipping operation at the weekend as “pretty rough”.</p>
<p>The threats to junior MPs who joined Parliament at the last election came as several senior backbenchers prepared to rebel on the plans.</p>
<p>Tory MP Sir Roger Gale, who abstained last week, signalled he may vote against the proposal.</p>
<p>"The PM is trying to rush this through to stop people discussing it properly. There is a great deal of hostility to it," he said</p>
<p>Sir John Redwood, a prominent low-tax Tory, said: "I will certainly not be voting for it. I will either abstain or vote against."</p>
<p>David Davis and Sir Iain Duncan Smith, both former Conservative cabinet ministers, on Monday night said they were undecided on whether to vote for the bill.</p>
<p>"Frankly, the more I look the more concerned I am," Mr Davis told The Telegraph.</p>
<p>Johnny Mercer, a former defence minister, said he would abstain because he believed the social care measures should be paid for by a rise in income tax, not national insurance.</p>
<p>“I think people would expect that if we ask for money from them there should be reform involved,” he added.</p>
<p>Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, on Monday gave the clearest indication yet that his party would fund social care reform through capital gains tax, not a levy on earnings like income tax or national insurance.</p>
<p>Labour and the Liberal Democrats will vote against the increase.</p>
<h1> National Insurance: Why the rumblings of an all-out Tory rebellion are growing louder </h1>
<p> The dispute has crystallised a contradiction at the heart of the 2019 manifesto: namely 'levelling up' by spending without raising taxes </p>
<div> <div> By Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent <time> 6 September 2021 • 10:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>It was the moment when months of secret talks about how to fund a new deal for social care finally blew up in the public, prompting a furious reaction from Conservative MPs and party grandees.</p>
<p>The Telegraph, along with other newspapers, splashed their front pages last Friday with the news that Boris Johnson was finally about to set out his long-promised plan to overhaul social care.</p>
<p>MPs had been waiting for the plan since Mr Johnson announced on the steps of 10 Downing Street in July 2019 that he had a "clear plan" for social care.</p>
<a>National Insurance tax </a>to pay for a new NHS and Social Care Levy that broke a key pledge in the 2019 general election manifesto.
<p>One Cabinet minister described it as "a tax raid on supermarket workers and nurses so the children of Surrey homeowners can receive bigger inheritances".</p>
<p>That came after Sir John Major, the former Tory Prime Minister, said increasing national insurance was a "regressive" way to raise money, and urged the Government to increase taxes for all to fund social care.</p>
<h3>Former chancellors raise concerns</h3>
<p>And in Monday's Telegraph, three former Tory Chancellors (usually governed by an unofficial agreement not to criticise the incumbent in 11 Downing St) broke cover.</p>
<p>Philip Hammond, Ken Clarke and Norman Lamont added their voices to the disquiet, saying it would unfairly hit young workers, leave wealthier pensioners unscathed or could lead to a voter backlash.</p>
<p>By the time MPs returned to the House of Commons after their summer break, the beginnings of a rebellion were starting to take shape.</p>
<p>Perhaps in a bid to keep a lid on any further criticism, Number 10 made clear that Mr Johnson's diary was free on Thursday, in an unspoken threat that a ministerial reshuffle could be imminent.</p>
<p>Yet around half a dozen Tory MPs – including normally placid Conservatives such as Mark Garnier, a former international trade minister – were already making clear that they were uncomfortable with the plans.</p>
<p>Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, and a former deputy chairman of the party, added that "it's going to hit the low paid, then I think that would cause me huge worries".</p>
<h3>Cash will go to NHS first</h3>
<p>MPs were also spooked by a suggestion that the cash raised from the new NHS and Social Care Levy will initially help to clear the operations backlog in NHS hospitals before starting to fund social care at a later stage.</p>
<p>Some pointed to how Labour plans to increase spending in the NHS early in Tony Blair's second term as prime minister barely dented performance levels.</p>
<p>One Tory MP said he feared the "NHS empire" was like a "cash addict" which would just swallow the increased spending with little improvement in performance, as it did under Labour.</p>
<p>Conservative MPs have also been irked about Mr Javid's involvement, as he was behind allowing councils to add two per cent to council tax bills to pay for local social care in 2016 when he was Housing Secretary.</p>
<p>Outside of the walls of Parliament, normally Tory-friendly lobby groups such as the TaxPayers' Alliance were gearing up for a fight over any increase in National Insurance.</p>
<p>Lobby journalists were sent a briefing by the Alliance in which it reminded them how Mr Johnson had himself said in the Commons in 2002 that "national insurance increases are regressive".</p>
<h3>Polling support for tax rise</h3>
<p>Allies of Mr Johnson were pointing to the widespread support for an increase in National Insurance to pay for social care in polling.</p>
<p>Polls by Ipsos Mori and YouGov over the summer found two thirds of the public support the idea of a one per cent National Insurance rise to pay for social care reform.</p>
<p>MPs worry that the voters being polled do not readily understand that the increase would be paid by everyone, not just a well-off minority.</p>
<p>Voting down a Finance Bill (if the plans are included in a future Budget) was risky as historically such a move has been seen as a vote of no confidence in the Government.</p>
<h3>Rebellions in the Commons</h3>
<p>The two previous biggest rebellions under the Johnson premiership failed to overhaul the Government's 84-strong working majority.</p>
<p>In July, the Government won a Commons vote with a majority of 35 over cutting spending on overseas aid from 0.7 per cent of GDP to just 0.5 per cent, despite a rebellion in which 25 Conservatives joined Labour in opposing it.</p>
<p>Number 10 has released the first part of the plan, when Mr Johnson unveiled an extra £5.4 billion over the next six months to support its response to Covid-19.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said: "This funding will go straight to the frontline, to provide more patients with the treatments they need but aren’t getting quickly enough."</p>
<p>Next will come the plan for social care. Fiscal hawks such as Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, have made clear that they will form their view when they see the detail.</p>
<p>Mr Sunak and Mr Johnson were due at a "welcome back" reception of the 1922 Committee on Monday, where they were expected to try to calm nerves among jumpy backbenchers.</p>
<h3>Manifesto contradiction</h3>
<p>But, for some of them, the row has crystallised a contradiction at the heart of the 2019 manifesto which commits the Tories both to "levelling up" by spending heavily in poorer areas, and not increasing taxes, like National Insurance.</p>
<p>One normally loyal senior Tory MP said: "This is the first skirmish in a long war; we have a Conservative Government that is addicted to spending money."</p>
<p>And a former Cabinet minister was despairing about the direction of travel in Mr Johnson's Government. "Can you name a single Conservative policy at the moment? This is going to blow up," he said on Monday night.</p>
<p>“It’s fair to say that we’ve got a tough autumn ahead. That doesn’t mean there won’t be disagreements, there always are, but we should never lose sight of the central fact that we are a team.”</p>
<p>Mr Johnson made a joke at expense of Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, saying: “We opened up our nightclubs and then sent our ministers out to enjoy them.”</p>

<header> <h1> Jacob Rees-Mogg: I’m Tory scum and proud </h1> <p> Commons leader brushes off incendiary attack made by Labour’s deputy leader, saying the party had helped turn him into a ‘fine’ person </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Harry Yorke, Whitehall Editor <time> 4 October 2021 • 5:41pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg has said he is proud to be “Tory scum” as he claimed the Conservative Party had turned him and other members into “fine people”.</p>
<p>The Commons leader on Monday sought to brush off comments made by Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner last week, adding that he was “not too fussed” about critics slinging insults.</p>
<p>“And I think those of us who are proud to be Tory scum look at what fine people we’ve been made by being Tories and by being educated by this great party and by following the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher and Boris Johnson.”</p>
<p>Mr Rees-Mogg also sought to make light of the torrent of abuse he had been subject to as an MP, revealing that vandals had recently defaced the front door of his home by painting on it the word “scum”.</p>
<p>“My wife said this is outrageous, shocking – they should have put Tory scum,” he added. “If you’re going to put it, you’ve got to do it right!”</p>
<p>However, Nadine Dorries, the Culture Secretary, was less forgiving, telling Tory members in Manchester on Monday that Ms Rayner’s comments risked normalising the abuse of politicians.</p>
<p>Ms Dorries added that she would not recommend a career in politics to her daughters because of the abuse levelled at female MPs.</p>
<p>“I really felt those comments by Angela needed to be shut down last week.”</p>
<h1> Policymakers watch in horror as Britain’s cost of living crisis widens </h1>
<p> Rising prices, rising taxes, rising mortgage rates; those sunlit uplands espoused by the Government seem an awfully long way off </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Jeremy Warner <time> 6 November 2021 • 2:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<a>latest surge in inflation</a>, and there is good reason to think it remains so.
<a>neither the Government or the economy can afford a rise in interest rates</a>. 
<p>What’s more, the costs of going green are only just beginning to bite. If wages don’t keep up, people’s pockets will be badly hit. </p>
<p>Small wonder that consumer and business confidence, having rebounded sharply from the depths of the pandemic, is again waning, if not yet falling off a cliff. </p>
<p>On top of everything else, Covid seems to be coming back. Amid a renewed surge in cases and hospitalisations, both the Netherlands and Belgium have already moved to reimpose a number of social distancing measures.</p>
<p>It must only be a matter of time before Britain follows suit, at least on vaccine passports and use of facemasks. </p>
<p>We can but hope it proves unnecessary, but you can already feel it in the air; economic confidence is again draining away.</p>
<p>“All my costs are rising”, says the owner. “I’ve got to put up prices to match, or I’m out of business”. Most bosses say the same.</p>
<p>The Bank of England still insists that the inflation is transitory, but how long is transitory? Certainly a lot longer than the Bank thought it would be just three months ago.</p>
<p>The bright spot in the economy is of course the labour market, which by the look of it continues to go gangbusters despite the end of furlough. </p>
<p>Acute labour shortages in some sectors are also driving some big wage increases for those lucky enough to have the bargaining power. The trouble is that the job openings are very unevenly spread; there is a mismatch in both skills and geography.</p>
<p>Beyond an apparent maelstrom of trade deals, most of which are just rollovers from existing EU agreements, there doesn’t as yet seem to be much of a plan for the post Brexit economy, and certainly very little sign of a Brexit dividend.</p>
<p>The Government, moreover, behaves as if it is an embattled revolutionary force still fighting some kind of shady business, City and Whitehall establishment determined to undermine the “will of the people”. </p>
<p>Can we not just move on? For how much longer can Brexit, and the divisions it stirred, be used as a cover for failings elsewhere?</p>
<p>The Government aspires to a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy, but as things stand, it is just wishful thinking. Rising prices, rising taxes, rising mortgage rates; those sunlit uplands seem an awfully long way off.</p>
