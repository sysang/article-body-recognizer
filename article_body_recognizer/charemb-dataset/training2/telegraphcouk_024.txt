<h1> Kew Gardens' plan to 'decolonise' its collections may be in breach of its legal obligations </h1>
<p> Think tank Policy Exchange is calling on the Environment Secretary to review whether it is deviating from its statutory powers and duties </p>
<div> <div> By Daniel Capurro <time> 28 December 2021 • 9:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Plans by Kew Gardens to “decolonise” its collections could be in breach of its legal obligations, a think tank has warned.</p>
<p>In a new report, Policy Exchange says that the institution may be in breach of the National Heritage Act 1983, which created the current board for Royal Botanic Gardens (RBG) Kew and sets out its responsibilities.</p>
<p>RBG Kew hit back at the accusations, with a spokesperson insisting that the plans were “within the remit of our charter under the Heritage Act”.</p>
<h2>Downing Street support</h2>
<p>The report, written by Ursula Buchan, a journalist and former student at Kew, is understood to have support from Downing Street. </p>
<p>“Nor is there any indication that visitors want or support this kind of change. As this paper shows, it is vital that Kew's reputation as a world-leading centre for the study and preservation of botany will be restored," they added.</p>
<p>While immediate action is unlikely to be forthcoming, the report is expected to be seen as a warning shot to RBG Kew.</p>
<p>The Government has been attempting to rein in efforts by public institutions to pursue ‘decolonisation’ agendas and has installed a policy of “retain and explain” for controversial objects and statues.</p>
<p>It has also been engaged in several controversies over appointments to museum boards of trustees.</p>
<p>RBG Kew is an executive non-departmental public body sponsored by the Department for Environment, Food Rural Affairs and runs Kew Gardens.</p>
<p>Subsequent editions of the document have had the phrase “decolonise” replaced with “re-examine”.</p>
<p>At the time, Richard Deverell, RBG Kew’s director, hit back at critics of the plans.</p>
<p>“Like so many other organisations, parts of Kew’s history shamefully draw from a legacy that has deep roots in colonialism and racism,” he told The Guardian.</p>
<p>He added: “There is no acceptable neutral position on this subject; to stay silent is to be complicit.”</p>
