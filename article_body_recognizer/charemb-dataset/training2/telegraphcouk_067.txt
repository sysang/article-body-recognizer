<div> <div> <time> 05 December 2007 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p> Marit Allen, who has died aged 66, was the costume designer on more than 40 films over 25 years after enjoying a successful career as a fashion journalist.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Born in Cheshire on September 17 1941, Marit Allen was the elder of two daughters of Roger Allen, landlord of an hotel at Lymm.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>She inherited her Christian name, her hair colour, and her love of craft and design from her Norwegian mother, an exotic, flame-haired beauty who had lit up this rural backwater in the straitened 1940s and 1950s.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Reflecting the new interest and enthusiasm for youth that were evident everywhere she created the "About Twenty" pages with Caterine Milinaire. This was unlike anything previously published in Queen.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Three years later she followed Beatrix Miller to Vogue, at the time when a youthful David Bailey was forging his personal and professional partnership with another 1960s icon, Jean Shrimpton.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>At Vogue Marit Allen initiated the "Young Idea" pages and took credit for promoting the careers of people such as Sally Tuffin and Marion Foale, Zandra Rhodes, Mary Quant and John Bates.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>She captivated Norman Parkinson and Bailey, who then included her in their pictures - a "first" for any fashion editor.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Even the older members of the fashion elite were caught up in her energy and enthusiasm: Cecil Beaton's memorable image of Twiggy on a mantelpiece was the result of Marit Allen's imagination and persuasive powers.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>She gave up her career at Vogue when the first of her children arrived.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <p>Through her husband Marit Allen was introduced to the world of film, and the possibilities excited her. Fashion, for all its thrills in the 1960s, was limited, but in film she could express her love of character and narrative.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Her first job was on Kaleidoscope, starring Warren Beatty and Susannah York. Kaleidoscope's producer, Elliot Kastner, said of her that "she seemed so smart and had such good taste".</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Almost all those with whom she subsequently worked - directors, actors and producers - were to echo these sentiments.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>According to Roeg, Donald Sutherland found his character only on the day when Marit Allen produced a large pair of woolly gloves; he put them on and never removed them for the duration of the shoot.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>This year her designs for two films - the Edith Piaf biopic La Vie en Rose and Mike Newell's adaptation of the Gabriel García Márquez novel Love in the Time of Cholera - have been tipped for Oscar nomination.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Marit Allen was the only costume designer to have worked on more than one of Ang Lee's films. She worked with him on Ride with the Devil, Hulk and, in 2005, Brokeback Mountain.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>For Brokeback Mountain she, Lee and the cinematographer, Rodrigo Preito, studied Richard Avedon's book Photographs of the American West.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Some days later, on November 26, she died in hospital having never regained consciousness.</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p> Marit Allen's marriage to Sandy Lieberson was dissolved in 1983. She is survived by two daughters and a son.</p> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <time> 13 October 2014 • 12:01pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Sir Jocelyn Stevens, who has died aged 82, forged a formidable reputation for himself as a saviour of ailing institutions, first in the newspaper industry and later as head, successively, of the Royal College of Art and English Heritage. </p>
<div> <div> <p><sup>Sir Jocelyn Stevens at the The Crescent, Buxton (Paul Armiger)</sup></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Years later, one of his art directors still quailed at the memory of being picked up by Stevens and shaken like a rat by a terrier, while change from his pockets cascaded on to the floor. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Stevens became the managing director of Beaverbrook Newspapers in 1974, and continued as its deputy chairman when the group was bought out by Trafalgar House under Victor Matthews. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Jocelyn Edward Greville Stevens was born on Valentine’s Day 1932. His mother, the daughter of the newspaper magnate Sir Edward Hulton, died shortly after giving birth to him. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>His father afterwards remarried and Jocelyn grew up with his stepfamily in Scotland; his stepbrother, Blair (later Sir Blair) Stewart-Wilson, would became Master of the Queen’s Household. </p> </div> </div>

<header> <h1> The Earl of Snowdon – obituary </h1> </header>
<div> <div> <time> 13 January 2017 • 5:53pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The 1st Earl of Snowdon, who has died aged 86, was an outstanding photographer, an implacable champion of the disabled, and a designer and film-maker of note.</p>
<p>He managed to remain on cordial terms with his former in-laws and, as he grew older, cut a courtly, aristocratic figure curiously at odds with the raffish, bohemian reputation of his youth.</p>
<p>He first became involved with the Royal family when, in 1956, he wrote (characteristically, out of the blue) to Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, asking if he might take photographs of her son on his 21st birthday.</p>
<p>At first, all seemed to be well. The young couple settled into apartments at Kensington Palace. A son, Viscount Linley, was born in 1961, and a daughter, Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, in 1964.</p>
<p>“It is an arrangement that provides every ingredient for a successful system,” remarked one commentator at the end of the 1960s, “hard work, circus spectacular, and pleasure.”</p>
<p>In 1976, after much unfavourable publicity concerning the Princess’s relationship with Llewellyn, a statement was issued saying that the Snowdons were to separate and that the Princess would carry out her public duties unaccompanied.</p>
<p>There were, at that time, no plans for a divorce; but in May 1978 the marriage was dissolved, and in December the same year Snowdon married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg. Their daughter, Lady Frances, was born the following year.</p>
<p>“It’s not that one is making a special case of disabled people,” he once said. “It’s just trying to ensure that they enjoy some of the same rights as the able-bodied.”</p>
<p>Snowdon and his second wife divorced in 2000. </p>
<p>His son David succeeds as the 2nd Earl of Snowdon.</p>
<p>The 1st Earl of Snowdon, born March 7 1930, died January 13 2017</p>

<div> <div> <time> 23 February 2014 • 8:45pm </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Beatrix Miller, who has died aged 90, was the exacting and benevolent longtime editor of British Vogue, who for two decades cultivated a hothouse of creativity at the glossy bible to high-fashion. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p><sup>Beatrix Miller in 1964</sup></p> </div> </div>
<div> <p>Even in the demotic Sixties, however, she continued to attach great significance to the aristocracy and the Royal Family, and was prepared to hold back an issue from the printers to get in photographs of a noble wedding or party. </p> </div>
<div> <div> <p><sup>Drawing of Beatrix Miller and Grace Coddington (GRACE CODDINGTON)</sup></p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>She could, on the other hand, be immensely supportive and would allow editors, against all received wisdom, their head and never allowed editorial to be dictated to by the demands of advertisers. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>On retiring, in 1985, she helped set up a “think tank” with, amongst others, Sir Terence Conran and the designer Jean Muir, to provide a link between the government and the fashion industry. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>She never appeared on television or gave an interview, rarely attended public engagements and seldom entertained, preferring, when not at her Hanover Square office, to garden or read a book at her home in Chelsea. </p> </div> </div>

<p>His tumour, however, could not be removed, and two strokes followed, which eventually confined him to his house.</p>

<h1> Courtenay Lloyd, well-loved schoolmaster who taught Russian to spies and married an exiled princess – obituary </h1>
<p> The polyglot Lloyd taught at the Cambridge Joint Services language school, then at Bradford Grammar, where he let his showman side emerge </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 4 January 2022 • 2:49pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>VE-Day saw him in Orkney, where, he recalled, the habitual quiet was shattered by drunken servicemen taking service cars for joyrides and pranging them.</p>
<p>Lloyd subsequently taught Russian at RAF College Cranwell and published a First Russian Reader in 1965. In 1964, with the Cold War thawing, he took up a post teaching modern languages at Bradford Grammar School.</p>
<p>In contrast to his quiet demeanour at home, where he was content to let his voluble wife do most of the talking, Lloyd proved to be something of a showman as a teacher, and was much-loved.</p>

<h1> Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff, eccentric French TV star twins at the centre of a notorious scientific controversy – obituary </h1>
<p> Papers they wrote on theoretical physics were published in reputable peer-reviewed journals but found later to be of no scientific value </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 4 January 2022 • 4:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Their “serious” scientific careers began in the 1990s when the Bogdanoffs, who had falsely claimed to have PhDs, decided to rectify the omission and embarked on studies at the University of Burgundy.</p>
<p>The Bogdanoffs responded by publishing supportive statements from one academic, who denied writing them, while scientists who had approved the papers for publication were variously defensive or red-faced and apologetic.</p>
<p>Igor Yourievitch and Grichka Yourievitch Bogdanoff were born on August 29 1949 in the small village of Saint-Lary, Gascony, south west France, Igor preceding his brother into this world by 40 minutes.</p>
<p>She and her baby daughter retreated to the Château de Saint-Lary, near Auch, where Igor and Grichka were brought up, its library inspiring in them a fascination with astronomy and science fiction.</p>
<p>Both brothers completed degrees in mathematics, and in 1976 they published The Keys to Science Fiction, which led to guest appearances on French television.</p>
<p>Dark-haired, square-jawed and good-looking, the Bogdanoffs became the pin-ups of France’s small screen and went on to present and produce several more television shows, mostly dealing with science fiction and space exploration.</p>
<p>In 2010, when they turned up during the Cannes film festival at a party for the jeweller Chopard, one commentator described their cheekbones as “so high and bulbous as to appear to threaten their owners’ vision”.</p>
<p>Grichka never married, but Igor was twice married and had six children, four from his first marriage and two from his second marriage to Amélie de Bourbon-Parme, a writer and historian. Both marriages were dissolved.</p>
<p>Igor and Grichka Bogdanoff, born August 29 1949: Grichka died on December 28 2021 and Igor on January 3 2022</p>
<h1> Assunta ‘Pupetta’ Maresca, beauty queen turned Camorrista who gained notoriety for ‘killing for love’ – obituary </h1>
<p> After her 1959 trial for shooting dead her husband’s killer, the ‘Diva of Crime’ became an instant celebrity as she was packed off to prison </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 4 January 2022 • 9:46pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Assunta “Pupetta” Maresca, who has died aged 86, was a one-time beauty queen and gangster’s moll who became known as “Lady Camorra” – a reference to the powerful Neapolitan mafia.</p>
<p>Her life was turned into a television film, Il Caso Pupetta Maresca, in 1982 starring Alessandra Mussolini, granddaughter of the former Italian dictator.</p>
<p>When she was 19 she won a local beauty contest and caught the eye of Pasquale Simonetti, a powerful local Camorrista who fixed the prices of fruit and vegetables in Naples markets and dealt in smuggled goods.</p>
<p>The police did not seem inclined to intervene in a Camorra turf war, and when Esposito reportedly had the effrontery to attend Pasquale’s funeral, Pupetta decided to take matters into her own hands.</p>
<p>She and her younger brother Ciro tracked Esposito down and on August 4 1955 she pulled out her Smith Wesson and gunned him down in front of the Naples Palace of Justice.</p>
<p>She was sentenced to 18 years, later reduced to 13 by the Court of Appeal, of which she eventually served 10. In prison she was reportedly regarded by inmates and guards as a woman of honour and treated with the deference owed a capo.</p>
<p>After her release from prison Pupetta became involved with another Camorrista, Umberto Ammaturo, a gun and drugs runner known as ‘o pazzo (“the mad one”), with whom she had twins.</p>
<p>Pupetta also suspected Ammaturo, but continued to live with him and to be involved in Camorra activities.</p>
<p>In 1982 she and Ammaturo were charged with killing Aldo Semerari, a forensic psychiatrist who had helped Ammaturo escape prison by teaching him to feign insanity. Ammaturo fled the country, leaving Pupetta in Italy to face charges.</p>
<p>Assunta “Pupetta” Maresca, born January 19 1935, died December 29 2021</p>
