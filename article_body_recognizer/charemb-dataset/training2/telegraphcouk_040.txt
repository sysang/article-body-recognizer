<p>But, falling in the festive season, it's also often referred to as Moon before Yule or Long Nights Moon.</p>
<p>A blood supermoon is a lunar eclipse which occurs during a full moon. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this phenomenon is only visible from certain parts of the world, with NASA saying that those in Hawaii have the best view. </p>
<h2>Total lunar eclipses</h2>
<p>A total lunar eclipse, otherwise known as a 'blood moon', occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth’s shadow. At the distance of the Moon, this shadow appears like the bull’s eye at the centre of a dartboard.</p>
<p>The next total lunar eclipse is not set to take place in the UK until May 16, 2022.</p>
<p>Does this well-known phrase have anything to do with the Moon? Well, yes it does. We use it to refer to something happening very rarely and a blue moon is a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>A seasonal blue moon describes the third of four full moons to occur in an astronomical season.</p>
<p>There's lots of other moons, too - how many do you know?</p>
<p>We all know what these are. They come around every month and light up the sky at night.</p>
<p>Most experts agree that this refers to the second new moon in a calendar month, while some use the term to describe the third new moon in a season of four new moons. The last black moon took place on August 19, 2020.</p>
<p>Ever looked up at the night sky to see a full moon so close you could almost touch it? Well you've probably spotted a supermoon.</p>
<p>The impressive sight happens when a full moon is at the point in its orbit that brings it closest to Earth. To us Earth-lings, it appears up to 30 per cent brighter and 14 per cent bigger. </p>
<p>Supermoon is not an astrological term though. It's scientific name is actually Perigee Full Moon, but supermoon is more catchy and is used by the media to describe our celestial neighbour when it gets up close.</p>
<h2>How many supermoons are there in 2022?</h2>
<p>In 2022, there will be a supermoon on June 14 and on July 13.</p>
<p>Head outside at sunset when the Moon is closest to the horizon and marvel at its size. As well as being closer and brighter, the Moon (clouds permitting) should also look orange and red in colour.</p>
<p>Why? Well, as moonlight passes through the thicker section of the atmosphere, light particles at the red end of the spectrum don't scatter as easily as light at the blue end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>So when the Moon looks red, you're just looking at red light that wasn't scattered. As the Moon gets higher in the sky, it returns to its normal white/yellow colour. </p>
<h2>Will the tides be larger?</h2>
<h2>Tell me more about the Moon</h2>
<li>The Moon is 4.6 billion years old and was formed between 30-50 million years after the solar system.</li>
<li>It is smaller than Earth - about the same size as Pluto in fact.</li>
<li>Gravity on the Moon is only 1/6 of that found on Earth.</li>
<li>The Moon is not round, but is egg-shaped with the large end pointed towards Earth.</li>
<li>It would take 135 days to drive by car to the Moon at 70 mph (or nine years to walk).</li>
<li>The Moon has "moonquakes" caused by the gravitational pull of Earth.</li>
<li>Experts believe the Moon has a molten core, just like Earth.</li>
<h2>How was the Moon formed?</h2>
<p>Only 12 people have ever walked on the Moon and they were all American men, including (most famously) Neil Armstrong who was the first in 1969 on the Apollo 11 mission. </p>
<p>The last time mankind sent someone to the Moon was in 1972 when Gene Cernan visited on the Apollo 17 mission.</p>
<p>Although Armstrong was the first man to walk on the Moon, Buzz Aldrin was the first man to urinate there. While millions watched the Moon Landing on live television, Aldrin was forced to go in a tube fitted inside his space suit.</p>
<p>The mineral, armalcolite, discovered during the first moon landing and later found at various locations on Earth, was named after the three Apollo 11 astronauts, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.</p>
<p>An estimated 600 million people watched the Apollo 11 landing live on television, a world record until 750 million people watched the wedding of the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer in 1981.</p>

<header> <h1> Chinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the Tiger </h1> <p> 2022 is the Year of the Tiger, but what do the Chinese zodiac signs mean and how do people celebrate? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 4 January 2022 • 4:15pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Chinese New Year will soon be upon us – and with it comes a host of superstitions that will apparently dictate how the next 12 months will play out for each of us.</p>
<p>Here is everything you need to know about the annual celebration, as well as recipes to cook for a delicious family feast.</p>
<h2>When is Chinese New Year 2022?</h2>
<p>The Chinese year will start on Feb 1 2022 and end on January 31 2023, when the Year of the Water Rabbit begins.</p>
<p>The new year, also known in China as the Spring Festival, is marked by the lunisolar Chinese calendar; this means the date changes from year to year. </p>
<p>The festivities usually start the day before the new year and continue until the Lantern Festival, the 15th day of the new year. </p>
<p>The Chinese zodiac is divided into 12 blocks (or houses) just like its western counterpart, but with the major difference that each house has a time-length of one year instead of one month. </p>
<p>Each Chinese New Year is characterised by one of 12 animals that appear in the Chinese zodiac – last year was the Year of the Ox.</p>
<p>People born in the Year of the Tiger are characterised as being brave, competitive and confident. But, on the other hand, they can sometimes be unpredictable, irritable, and overindulgent.</p>
<p>Lucky numbers for people born in the Year of the Tiger are one, three and four, and their lucky colours are blue, grey and orange. Their lucky flowers are cinerarias and anthuriums.</p>
<h2>Which Chinese zodiac sign are you? </h2>
<p>Your sign is derived from the year you were born in the Chinese lunar calendar. </p>
<li>Rat: 2020, 2008, 1996, 1984, 1972</li>
<li>Ox: 2021, 2009, 1997, 1985, 1973</li>
<li>Tiger: 2010, 1998, 1986, 1974, 1962</li>
<li>Rabbit: 2011, 1999, 1987, 1975, 1963</li>
<li>Dragon: 2012, 2000, 1988, 1976, 1964</li>
<li>Snake: 2013, 2001, 1989, 1977, 1965</li>
<li>Horse: 2014, 2002, 1990, 1978, 1966</li>
<li>Sheep: 2015, 2003, 1991, 1979, 1967</li>
<li>Monkey: 2016, 2004, 1992, 1980, 1968</li>
<li>Rooster: 2017, 2005, 1993, 1981, 1969</li>
<li>Dog: 2018, 2006, 1994, 1982, 1970</li>
<li>Pig: 2019, 2007, 1995, 1983, 1971</li>
<p>The years above are a rough guide; bear in mind that if you were born in January or February it may be slightly different as the new year moves between January 21 and February 20.</p>
<p>According to Chinese astrology, the year of your birth sign is believed to be one of the most unlucky years of your life. It is thought that people in their zodiac year offend Tai Sui, the God of Age, and incur his curse.</p>
<h2>What does your Chinese zodiac sign mean? </h2>

<h2>Chinese New Year traditions</h2>
<p>In preparation for the new year, the Chinese will clean their homes and put up red decorations and lanterns.</p>
<p>The celebrations will then officially kick off with a New Year’s Eve family dinner, with fish and dumplings being served to encourage prosperity.</p>
<p>Shou Sui, which translates as “after the New Year's Eve dinner”, follows the traditional feast, where families stay awake throughout the night and gather for fireworks at midnight to banish evil.</p>

<h2>Chinese New Year's Day taboos </h2>
<p>There are many superstitions surrounding Chinese New Year. These are to be avoided on the first day of the festival:</p>
<li>Medicine: Taking medicine on the first day of the lunar year means one will get ill for a whole year.</li>
<li>Porridge: It is considered that only poor people have porridge for breakfast – and people don’t want to start the year “poor”.</li>
<li>Sharp objects: The use of knives and scissors is to be avoided as any accident is thought to lead to inauspicious things and the depletion of wealth.</li>
<li>The broom: If you sweep on this day then your wealth will be swept away too.</li>
<li>Crying children: The cry of a child is believed to bring bad luck to the family so parents do their best to keep children as happy as possible.</li>
<li>Theft: Having your pocket picked is believed to portend your entire wealth in the coming year being stolen.</li>
<li>Debt: Money should not be lent on New Year’s Day and all debts have to be paid by New Year’s Eve. If someone owes you money, do not go to their home to demand it. Anyone who does so will be unlucky all year.</li>
<li>An empty rice jar: A depleted receptacle may cause grave anxiety as the cessation of cooking during the New Year period is considered to be an ill omen.</li>
<li>Damaged clothes: Wearing threadbare garments can cause more bad luck for the year.</li>
<li>Killing things: Blood is considered an ill omen, which will cause misfortunes such as a knife wound or a bloody disaster.</li>
<li>Monochrome fashion: White or black clothes are barred as these two colours are traditionally associated with mourning.</li>
<li>Giving of certain gifts: Clocks, scissors, and pears all have a bad meaning in Chinese culture.</li>

<h1> Omicron symptoms: What they are and how the new Covid variant differs from previous strains </h1>
<p> Everything you need to know about the latest variant, including slowing its transmission and the protection offered by vaccines and boosters </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:23am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The omicron variant, which has double the number of mutations compared to the delta variant, is highly contagious and has led to cases being found worldwide.</p>
<p>The UK confirmed the presence of <a>omicron</a>, which was first detected in South Africa, on Nov 27.</p>
<p>The doubling rate of omicron in some regions is now down to less than two days, and weekly hospitalisations are up by 10 per cent nationally, the Prime Minister said in a press conference on 15 December.</p>
<p>Sir Chris Whitty, England's Chief Medical Officer, said: "It looks as if delta which has been with us for a while is still flat, and the growth is omicron. </p>
<p>"So what we've got is two epidemics, on top of one another, an existing delta epidemic, roughly flat, and a very rapidly growing omicron epidemic on top of it."</p>
<p>However, the Prime Minister praised the public's response to the <a>Government's booster drive</a>.</p>
<p>Over 59 per cent of people aged 12 and above in the UK have been boosted so far, with a record number of 968,665 booster jabs administered on Dec 21 alone.</p>
<p>Below, we have answered the key questions about the variant, the vaccines, and what the future may hold:</p>
<h2>What are the main symptoms of the omicron variant?</h2>
<p>Experts have warned that omicron is triggering a <a>“rather different” set of symptoms</a> compared to previous variants. The main symptoms of the omicron variant are being reported as:</p>
<ul><li>Fatigue</li><li>Headache</li><li>Other body aches (including lower back pain)</li><li>Sore or "scratchy" throat</li><li>Runny nose</li><li>Sneezing</li></ul>
<a>milder disease compared to previous waves</a>, with 29 per cent fewer hospitalisations than the Wuhan strain and 23 per cent fewer compared to delta.
<h2>How long before omicron symptoms appear?</h2>
<p>The time it takes for a person infected with omicron to develop symptoms after exposure may be shorter than previous variants, current evidence would suggest.</p>
<p>This means that the "incubation period" - when you have the virus, and it is working its way through your system - could be as little as three days before symptoms appear.</p>
<h2>How is this different to previous variants?</h2>
<p>Emerging evidence indicates that omicron spreads more easily, which is resulting in a faster and higher peak than previous variants, even if immunity from severe disease continues.</p>
<p>During the first three waves, 100 per cent of the 55,000 Covid-19 patients hospitalised in Netcare facilities needed oxygen. So far, during the new wave, only 10 per cent of 337 hospitalised patients need oxygen.</p>
<p>It was stressed, however, that these were only preliminary results and that the situation could change. </p>
<p>During a press briefing at Downing Street on Dec 15, Sir Chris Whitty said there should be "really serious caution" over reports that a reduction in hospitalisations was being seen in cases of omicron in South Africa.</p>
<p>He said: "The first caution on this is simply a numerical one - if the rate of hospitalisation were to halve but you're doubling every two days, in two days you're back to where you were before you actually had the hospitalisation.</p>
<p>"If the peak of this is twice as great, then halving of the size of the hospitalisation rate, you still end up in the same place. And this peak is going very fast."</p>
<p>In an address on Dec 12, Boris Johnson warned of a "tidal wave" of omicron and said: "Do not make the mistake of thinking omicron can't hurt you, can't make you and your loved ones seriously ill."</p>
<h2>What happens if I have omicron?</h2>
<a>lateral flow tests</a>, not just those who come into contact with omicron. 
<p>The UK Health Security Agency is continuing to carry out targeted testing at locations where confirmed omicron cases were likely to have been infectious.</p>
<h2>What is the risk of reinfection with omicron?</h2>
<a>published on the Medrxiv website</a>, surveyed nearly three million people infected with Covid. It found that the risk of reinfection from the omicron variant is three times higher than for the delta and beta strains of the virus.
<p>The authors concluded: "Evidence suggests that the omicron variant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection." </p>
<h2>Why is it called omicron?</h2>
<p>Officials at the World Health Organisation skipped two letters of the Greek alphabet when naming the latest Covid variant in order to avoid "stigmatising" China, and perhaps its premier Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>A WHO source confirmed the letters Nu and Xi had been deliberately avoided. Nu had been skipped to avoid confusion with the word "new" and Xi had been ducked to "avoid stigmatising the region", they said. </p>
<h2>Do vaccines protect against the variant?</h2>
<p>Mr Johnson said on Dec 12 that two doses of a Covid vaccine are "simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need" from the "tidal wave of omicron coming". </p>
<p>"But the good news is that our scientists are confident that with a third dose – a booster dose - we can all bring our level of protection back up," he said. </p>
<p>On Dec 15, Sir Chris Whitty reiterated the Prime Minister's words, stating that the protection provided by the vaccines was going to be "eroded" because the current vaccines are "less well matched" to the omicron variant. </p>
<p>He added that the point of <a>boosters</a> was to replicate the previous level of protection.</p>
<h2>Do booster jabs protect against the variant?</h2>
<p>Data from a government-funded Covboost trial, published in The Lancet, has found that <a>booster jabs</a> produce <a>long-lasting T-cells</a> that are likely to work against all current and future coronavirus variants, including omicron.</p>
<p>Lab studies using blood samples of triple and double-jabbed individuals were infected with omicron and analysis revealed antibodies effectively neutralise the variant of concern</p>
<p>On Dec 12, Mr Johnson announced the launch of the Omicron Emergency Boost, "a national mission unlike anything we have done before in the vaccination programme".</p>
<p>Sir Chris Whitty has said it is not yet clear how regularly we will need to have booster jabs in the future. </p>
<p>But <a>German research</a> suggests that the latest variant can evade antibodies that are produced by booster jabs to a significant extent.</p>
<p>Sandra Ciesek, the director of the Institute of Medical Virology at University Hospital Frankfurt, stated on Dec 7 that early laboratory results showed boosters may not be a panacea against omicron. </p>
<p>Blood taken from subjects who had received three jabs performed better against omicron than those which had not been boosted, but was nevertheless much reduced compared to delta.</p>
<p>"BioNtech three months after booster only 25 per cent neutralising versus 95 per cent with delta," she wrote <a>in a tweet</a>. "Up to 37 times the reduction in delta vs. omicron."</p>
<h2>What has WHO said about the omicron variant?</h2>
<p>The World Health Organization has said that omicron has been detected worldwide, stating that the highly mutated variant could have a "major impact" on the trajectory of the pandemic.</p>
<p>He urged governments to urgently take action to curb Covid transmission in the face of omicron and the still dominant delta strain. </p>
<p>"We're running out of ways to say this but we will keep saying it. All of us. Every government and every individual must use all the tools we have right now."</p>
<p>Dr Tedos also warned that travel bans are unlikely to be effective to halt omicron's spread now the new variant has been widely identified.</p>
<p>It comes as Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead of the Covid response, suggested that the emergence of an omicron-type variant was "entirely predictable" - particularly in light of vast imbalances in the global vaccine rollout.</p>
<p>She said reducing transmission and increasing vaccinations is key to ending the pandemic.</p>
<p>Dr van Kerkhove told a briefing: "This is one of the scenarios that is completely predictable. The virus has been evolving since the beginning. We cannot only focus on vaccination coverage. </p>

<h1> What Covid Plan B means for you: work from home, vaccine passports and extended mask mandate </h1>
<p> Boris Johnson announced that Plan B measures would remain in place until January 26 in a bid to limit the spread of the omicron variant </p>
<div> <div> By Christopher Hope, Chief Political Correspondent ; Camilla Turner, Education Editor and Danielle Sheridan, Political and Defence Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:31am </time> </div> </div>
<p>In a bid to stop a rapid increase in hospitalisations from the omicron variant, Boris Johnson announced the tightening of Covid restrictions across the country on Dec 8 2021.</p>
<p>People were asked to work from home if possible from Dec 13, with <a>vaccine passports</a> now required in nightclubs and for football matches as of Dec 15.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced on Jan 3 2022 that <a>he would not be implementing further restrictions</a> - allowing Plan B measures to remain in place until they expire on Jan 26.</p>
<p>Face masks are compulsory in most indoor venues, but not in pubs, bars or restaurants.</p>
<p>The Government’s Covid-19 winter plan, <a>first published in mid-September</a>, made clear that ministers would move to this Plan B if the NHS was “likely to come under unsustainable pressure”.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister came to his decision following meetings with officials, scientific advisers and his Cabinet at No 10 after cases in South Africa, where omicron was first detected, doubled in a week.</p>
<p>Any review of the restrictions will happen “no later” than early January “and possibly before”.</p>
<p>The news was welcomed by experts including the Royal Society for Public Health, which said moving to Plan B would “slow down the spread of disease and buy us time to roll out the boosters”.</p>
<p>However, some councils sounded the alarm, with one in London saying it would be “a hammer blow” to traders who had fought so hard to stay in business during the lockdowns over the past two years.</p>
<a>Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary</a>, said that the restrictions were not what the Government wanted to introduce.
<h2>What are the current rules in Wales?</h2>
<p>The Welsh Government announced <a>the return of tougher Covid restrictions after Christmas</a>, with social distancing being reimplemented as of Dec 27, as well as the closure of all nightclubs in the country.</p>
<p>An additional £60 million was also made available to support businesses affected by the tougher measures.</p>
<p>Face coverings are now required in most public indoor venues, such as cinemas, theatres and places of worship in England.</p>
<p>They were first made compulsory in shops and on public transport in England in an effort to slow the spread of omicron on Nov 30.</p>
<p>However, there are exemptions where it is not practical to wear one, such as when people are eating, drinking, exercising or singing.</p>
<p>“For that reason, face masks will not be required in hospitality settings,” No 10 said.</p>
<p>Asst Chief Constable Owen Weatherill, the strategic lead at the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said in November that officers would engage with people not wearing face coverings and encourage them to do so.</p>
<p>Face masks were required to be worn by customers in England until July 19 in pubs, bars and restaurants when they were not seated.</p>
<p>Anyone going to “nightclubs and settings where large crowds gather” will now have to show proof that they have been double vaccinated against the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As of Dec 15, people have been required to <a>demonstrate their Covid status</a> to get into any venues where large crowds gather.</p>
<p>This includes unseated indoor events with 500 or more attendees, unseated outdoor events with 4,000 or more people and any event with 10,000 or more people present.</p>
<p>Proof of a recent lateral flow will also be accepted for the unvaccinated, Mr Johnson said after he had “taken clinical advice since the emergence of omicron”.</p>
<p>Hours after Mr Johnson announced the introduction of vaccine passports, the NHS Covid Pass was inaccessible to users owing to technical issues.</p>
<p>When the rules were announced by Mr Javid in the Commons, William Wragg, a Tory MP, was heard shouting “resign”. </p>
<p>Greg Clark, a former Cabinet minister, added that he thought Mr Javid had “reversed his position and jumped the gun”.</p>
<p>People have been asked to <a>work from home </a>“if they can” since Dec 13 in a bid to slow the spread of omicron in workplaces.</p>
<p>Employers were “encouraged... to discuss working arrangements with their employees”, Mr Johnson said, as this requirement was guidance only and not a legal requirement.</p>
<p>He said: “Go to work if you must, but work from home if you can. And I know this will be hard for many people, but by reducing your contacts in the workplace you will help slow transmission.”</p>
<p>The return of working from home was condemned by Cllr Rachael Robathan, the leader of the City of Westminster Council, who feared for shops and firms that relied on office workers to stay open.</p>
<p>The decision came just days after Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish First Minister, said that people should work from home until January.</p>
<p>Anyone found to have been in contact with someone who has <a>contracted the omicron variant</a> will be able return to the community after a negative lateral flow test.</p>
<p>The announcement has been a crumb of good news given that the current rules initially said that contacts of someone with omicron would have to isolate for 10 days at home.</p>
<p>Testing was a “vital tool in controlling the spread given the likely increased transmissibility of omicron”.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said: “As omicron spreads in the community, we will also introduce daily tests for contacts instead of isolation, so we keep people safe while minimising the disruption to daily life.”</p>
<p>The Education Secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said the move was designed to help "maximise the number of children in school" and would remain only as long as needed, <a>amid fears of omicron disrupting teaching in schools</a>.</p>
<p>The Telegraph also has confirmation that more drastic proposals include <a>prioritising GCSE and A-Level students for face-to-face teaching</a>, should schools be hit by staff absences.</p>

<h1> Prince Harry and Charles: has their fragile relationship been damaged beyond repair? </h1>
<p> As he continues his Californian lifestyle, the Duke of Sussex could not seem more estranged from the House of Windsor he once rallied behind </p>
<div> <div> By Camilla Tominey, Associate Editor <time> 7 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>It wasn’t always this way. Before Prince Harry’s decision to repeatedly throw his father under a bus, he was arguably closer than Prince William to Prince Charles.</p>
<p>The prince’s senior aide Michael Fawcett – the man he always said he could not live without – was forced to resign as the head of The Prince’s Foundation last month. </p>
<p>Fawcett was spotted shopping at Homebase at the weekend after an independent investigation last week found he had colluded with “fixers” representing Mahfouz who were trying to secure an honour in return for donations. </p>
<p>Mahfouz is thought to have donated at least £1.5 million to Royal charities – including £50,000 to Harry’s Sentebale charity and a further £10,000 to Walking With the Wounded, another charity of which he is patron.</p>
<p>It is certainly an understatement to say the relationship between Charles and both his sons has been a complex one over the years.</p>
<p>Referring to the Princess of Wales’s now discredited 1995 interview with Martin Bashir, the source added: “I think the dynamics changed quite a lot after Panorama.”</p>
<p>The more William and Charles worked together to protect the monarchy from the growing crisis, the more Harry and Meghan are said to have felt marginalised.</p>
<p>The New Year 2020 release of a photograph showing the Queen and her three heirs – Charles, William and Prince George, only served to compound the Sussexes’ sense of frustration,</p>
<p>His father had asked him to commit his plans for a ‘quasi’ Royal role to paper, but Harry refused, fearing they would be leaked by Clarence House – hardly a ringing endorsement of his father’s operation. </p>
<p>Money also played a part in the breakdown of the relationship with father and son – as evidenced by Harry’s dismay at the plug being pulled on his family’s taxpayer-funded security.</p>
<p>According to one well-placed source: “Like any parent, Charles did get fed up with the constant calls from Harry for more money.</p>
<p>“He... did his utmost to make them feel financially supported... I think a lot of parents will be able to identify with that.”</p>
<p>Tellingly, however, those who know Charles best insist he won’t be angry at Harry’s latest salvo – just sad. </p>
<p>In the year Charles said goodbye to his beloved father, it looks horribly like he is also in danger of losing his darling boy too.</p>
<h1> Sick of the ‘no-shows’: My postcard from the booster frontline </h1>
<p> This vaccine volunteer has a message for those who say ‘no’. Do you not realise that we are on the brink of yet another national emergency? </p>
<div> <div> By Miranda Levy <time> 13 December 2021 • 4:06pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>When I got home last night I switched on the TV. There was Boris at 8pm, with a statement. We need to battle the “tidal wave” of omicron cases, he said, to avoid the risk of a New Year lockdown.</p>
<p>Of the 250 people expected at my clinic yesterday there were about 30 ‘no shows’: those with appointments who simply did not appear.</p>
<a>we are using Pfizer</a> in this clinic, and doses have to be calculated exactly. Uncertainty over the final number of patients means the clinical lead is unsure how many vials she needs to open. (A vial holds six doses). 
<a>the chance of a blood clot with AstraZeneca was minuscule</a> – that you were far more likely to get this serious illness with Covid itself – the odd person spat out their annoyance and left.
<p>“It’s just flu”. Well, try telling that to my hitherto sanguine hospital consultant brother who saw a previously perfectly healthy member of his team die in an agony that haunted him for weeks.</p>

<h1> How current Level 4 restrictions compare to February 2021 - does this signal a move towards lockdown? </h1>
<div> <div> By Gareth Davies, Breaking News Editor <time> 13 December 2021 • 3:10pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>On Dec 12, the UK Covid Alert level was increased to four, meaning the epidemic is "in general circulation, transmission is high and direct Covid-19 pressure on healthcare services is widespread and substantial or rising".</p>
<p>In a statement, the four UK chief medical officers and the NHS England national medical director said the emergence of Omicron "adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services".</p>
<p>But what does level four mean in practice? </p>
<p>Last time the UK entered level four was on Feb 25, when we were de-escalating from the most severe level five.</p>
<p>During that time, the restrictions in England were as follows: </p>
<li>Primary and secondary schools were closed</li>
<li>Indoor hospitality and non-essential retail, such as hairdressers and clothes shops, were closed</li>
<li>Entertainment venues, such as cinemas, zoos and theme parks, were closed</li>
<li>'Stay At Home' order was in-place</li>
<li>Organised outdoor sport was banned</li>
<li>Mixing between households was prohibited</li>
<p>This time around, the restrictions are nowhere near as restrictive.</p>
<li>Wear a face covering in most indoor public places and on public transport</li>
<li>Get tested and self-isolate if required</li>
<li>Work from home, if you can</li>
<li>Let fresh air in if you meet indoors. Meeting outdoors is safer</li>
<p>Here, we take a look at the history of how and when restrictions were put in place, and if it could mean we are heading for another lockdown. </p>
<h2>Mar 23, 2020: The first national lockdown</h2>
<p>On Monday, 23 Mar 2020, more than 27million people watched the Prime Minister address the nation to announce extraordinary measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus. </p>
<p>It became the ninth most watched TV moment in the UK's history. </p>
<p>Boris Johnson asked the public to stay at home and said that the police would have powers to issue fines to those who left home without a reasonable excuse.</p>
<p>People were allowed to leave the house to exercise once a day, but only with members of their own households. </p>
<p>Schools were closed to all children apart from those of key workers.</p>
<p>All but essential high street businesses were closed and some shops were permitted to operate deliveries. </p>
<p>Police were provided with powers to fine people, and the first review of the restrictions on Apr 16 saw the lockdown extended. </p>
<p>At this stage, there were 6,650 confirmed Covid cases in the UK, and there had been 335 Covid deaths. </p>
<p>By May 7, the regulations had been reviewed again, and three days later Mr Johnson began to plot Britain's route out of lockdown. </p>
<h2>May 10, 2020: The roadmap to freedom</h2>
<p>By the time the Prime Minister announced the beginning of the end of the first lockdown, deaths had topped 30,000, and there were more than 200,000 Covid cases in the UK.</p>
<p>Addressing the nation again on May 10, he set out England’s "roadmap for the next phase" of the lockdown.</p>
<p>The third formal review came on May 28, and this gave birth to the rule of six. </p>
<p>On June 1, for the first time since Mar 23, people were allowed to meet people not in their households in groups of six providing they were outside or in gardens. </p>
<p>The change of rhetoric removed the prohibition on being outside without a "reasonable excuse" and replaced it with a requirement to have a "reasonable excuse" to stay overnight somewhere other than your home.</p>
<p>By the end of May, there were some 4,000 daily Covid cases being reported, and 1,452 daily Covid deaths.</p>
<h2>June 23, 2020: Major changes for a 'free' summer</h2>
<p>Major changes to England’s lockdown were announced on June 23. </p>
<p>This was the last time major changes were announced connected with a formal review point of the lockdown laws. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced in a statement to the House of Commons that from the July 4: </p>
<li>Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers some leisure facilities and tourist attractions would be able to reopen</li>
<li>Two households would be able to meet indoors</li>
<li>Staycations in England would be permitted and “accommodation sites” in England would be reopened.</li>
<li>Weddings with a maximum of thirty attendees would be permitted.</li>
<p>Following the announcement, the Government published guidance on what people “can and can’t do after 4 July”. </p>
<p>This implied that, barring amended restrictions to gatherings most restrictions would be revoked from July 4.</p>
<p>It paved the way for a relatively restriction-free summer, as people made use of the "Eat Out To Help Out" scheme, which saw the Government picking up 50 per cent of the bill when people ate at pubs and restaurant during August. </p>
<p>But we were only just beginning, and in July we got a glimpse of what was to come when Leicester became the first city to be hit with a local lockdown.</p>
<h2>Oct 2020: Local lockdowns, tiers and reimposing restrictions</h2>
<p>Leicester was the first city to be placed into local lockdown on July 1.</p>
<p>More areas were placed in local lockdown during the summer and autumn and by October there was a complicated patchwork of local restrictions across England.</p>
<p>On Sep 9, the rule of six was reintroduced as the Prime Minister announced the tightening of coronavirus restrictions for England. </p>
<p>He said that "over time, the rules have become quite complicated and confusing" and that therefore the Government was "simplifying and strengthening the rules – making them easier for you to understand and for the police to enforce".</p>
<p>He announced that from Monday Sep 14, people would be prohibited from meeting socially in groups of more than six in any setting.</p>
<p>But as cases soared from 3,577 on Sep 10 to 7,045 on Sep 23, Mr Johnson announced that the following day on Sep 24, all pubs, bars and restaurants must operate a table service only, except for takeaways and imposed a 10pm curfew. </p>
<p>To simplify the local restrictions, a tiered system was announced on Oct 12, which would come into force two days later. </p>
<p>He told the Commons: "In recent months we have worked with local leaders to counter local spikes with targeted restrictions. </p>
<p>"This local approach has inevitably produced different sets of rules in different parts of the country, which are now complex to understand and to enforce. </p>
<p>"So just as we simplified our national rules with the rule of six, we will now simplify and standardise our local rules by introducing a three-tiered system of local Covid alert levels in England, set at medium, high and very high." </p>
<li>Tier 1: (Medium) - Rule of six, hospitality businesses must close at 10pm</li>
<li>Tier 2: (High) - People are prohibited from meeting people they do not live with indoors, hospitality businesses must close at 10pm</li>
<h2>Nov 5, 2020: Second national lockdown</h2>
<p>On Oct 31, the Prime Minister addressed a Number 10 press conference to announce that a new national lockdown would be imposed from Nov 5. </p>
<p>Setting out the details on Nov 2, he said the rules during the second national lockdown resembled those imposed during the first. </p>
<li>Stay home: Individuals are permitted to leave home when they have a "reasonable excuse"</li>
<li>There was a nonexhaustive list of reasonable excuses which includes buying essential goods, conducting work which it is not "reasonably possible” to do from home and for "open air recreation"</li>
<li>Minimise their social contact: Individuals were only permitted to gather inside with those in their support bubble</li>
<li>People were permitted to meet one person at a time outside</li>
<li>Non-essential high street businesses had to close or move their business to delivery only</li>
<li>Hospitality businesses (such as restaurants and pubs) could continue to sell food and drinks for consumption at home</li>
<h2>Nov 25, 2020: Tier four attempting to save Christmas</h2>
<p>Some changes were made at the end of November in a last-ditch attempt to save Christmas. </p>
<p>The Governments in the four nations of the UK set out plans to allow families and friends to meet more at Christmas than was previously allowed under the coronavirus restrictions. </p>
<p>They stated that during the 23-27 December period, up to three households could form an exclusive Christmas bubble.</p>
<p>Equivalent legislation was introduced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. </p>
<p>However, alongside the legal provision for people to meet up over the Christmas period had been a message from scientists and the Government that people should exercise caution. </p>
<p>But on Dec 19, 2020, the Prime Minister, and the Government’s Chief Scientific Adviser and Chief Medical Officer, announced in a Downing Street press conference that urgent changes needed to be made to coronavirus restrictions. </p>
<p>This was in response to rapidly increasing cases of Covid-19, especially in London, the South East and East of England, and concerns about a new mutation - known then as the Kent variant.</p>
<p>On Nov 25, when the easing was announced, daily cases were at 16,608. By Dec 20, that figure was 32,441.</p>
<p>A stricter tier of coronavirus restrictions, tier four, was announced on Dec 19 to apply across London and large parts of the South East of England and came into force at 7am on Dec 20. </p>
<p>The tier four rules were broadly similar to those in place during the national lockdown in November. </p>
<p>In tier 4 areas, people were required to stay at home unless they have a reasonable excuse to leave. </p>
<p>All non-essential retail and hospitality businesses were close and people could only meet with one other person in certain public outdoor places. </p>
<p>Christmas was cancelled for millions.</p>
<p>In tier four areas, the rules were not be relaxed at all over the Christmas period. </p>
<p>No indoor gatherings were allowed over the Christmas period - with certain exceptions to this, including support bubbles. In tiers one to three, Christmas bubbles were allowed, but only for one day on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said: "As Prime Minister, it is my duty to take the difficult decisions, to do what is right to protect the people of this country. </p>
<p>"Given the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, and the potential risk it poses, it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned."</p>
<h2>Jan 6, 2021: Third national lockdown</h2>
<p>By the beginning of January, the death toll from Covid had topped 75,000 people and there were more than 50,000 daily cases being reported, almost a 50 per cent increase week-on-week. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister addressed the nation to announce a third national lockdown for England.</p>
<p>The third national lockdown came into force on Jan 6 as the Covid alert level was raised to its most severe - five. </p>
<p>People were required to stay home and were only permitted to leave with a reasonable excuse. Meeting one person outside for recreation was not permitted under these national rules. </p>
<p>However, two people not in a support bubble were allowed to meet to exercise.</p>
<p>There were limited exempted larger gatherings from this rule, but religious services and some small weddings were exempt.</p>
<p>The third national lockdown also involved the closing of schools, something that was not a feature of the second lockdown. </p>
<h2>Feb 22, 2021: The roadmap to freedom</h2>
<p>The UK shifted from level five down to level four in February 2021. </p>
<p>Mr Johnson set out a four-step plan for easing lockdown restrictions in England, as part of the Government’s roadmap out of lockdown. </p>
<p>At the end of these steps, the UK would be back to Covid alert level three.</p>
<li>International travel ban</li>
<li>Rule of six or two households (outdoors)</li>
<li>People prohibited from meeting inside with people not in their household/support bubble</li>
<li>Outdoor gatherings involving more than six people or people from only two households prohibited</li>
<li>Exemptions include gatherings of people from only two households and organised team sports</li>
<li>Non-essential retail, hospitality venues and close contact venues must remain closed</li>
<li>People are prohibited from meeting inside with people not in their household/support bubble</li>
<li>Outdoor gatherings involving more than six can happen</li>
<li>Non-essential retail and personal care services can re-open</li>
<li>Hospitality venues may offer food and drink for consumption outdoors</li>
<h2>Step 3 (no earlier than May 17)</h2>
<li>Outdoor gatherings over 30 people prohibited</li>
<li>Indoor gatherings involving more than six people are prohibited</li>
<li>Hospitality can reopen inside with table service</li>
<li>Businesses such as nightclubs and sexual entertainment venues must remain closed</li>
<h2>Step 4 (No earlier than June 21)</h2>
<ul><li>Removal of all legal limits on social contact</li><li>Reopening of nightclubs and easing of restrictions on large events and performances</li></ul>
<p>Although the alert levels are largely for guidance, we are now just one level away from the most severe, which has always resulted in a full national lockdown. </p>
<p>The caveat this time around is the mass rollout of the vaccination programmes. The alert levels are:</p>
<li>Level one: Covid-19 is not known to be present in the UK</li>
<li>Level two: Covid-19 is present in UK, but the number of cases and transmission is low</li>
<li>Level three: a Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation</li>
<li>Level four: a COVID-19 epidemic is in general circulation; transmission is high and direct Covid-19 pressure on healthcare services is widespread and substantial or rising</li>
<li>Level five: as level four and there is a material risk of healthcare services being directly overwhelmed by Covid-19</li>

<p>Maxwell was acquitted of one count of enticing a minor to travel across state lines to engage in an illegal sexual act.</p>
