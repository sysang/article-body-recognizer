<h3><a>Emojis not good enough: We need a real inquiry into COVID policies</a></h3>

<p>Many businesses are warning they are in uncharted territory, with the economic effects of the Omicron wave seen by many as worse than previous COVID outbreaks.</p>
<div>2022: a year for good economic health</div>
<p>What to expect from our economy in 2022? It is forecast to be a year of recovery and rebuilding, setting us on a path to a sustained period of expansion.</p>
<p>However, the big lessons from 2020 and 2021 is that such expectations can be left in tatters by further waves of the global COVID-19 pandemic, which remain a clear risk this year.</p>
<p>Still, I expect 2022 to be a year of strong growth for the Australian economy – what economists call “above trend” growth.</p>
<p>It should be a consumer-led period of economic growth, with a big stockpile of savings accumulated during pandemic lockdowns being spent on goods and services as people’s appetite to venture out re-emerges.</p>
<p>The growth should continue to push the unemployment rate lower, perhaps to levels we have not seen for more than a decade. This should put upward pressure on wages.</p>
<p>The re-opening of borders will enable non-residents to return to meet some of this additional labour demand and relieve pressure, but they will also create additional demand in the economy.</p>
<p>However, progress towards broad-based higher wages growth will likely be slow and this is key for the interest rate outlook.</p>
<p>Although the RBA is unlikely to lift rates prematurely, it will eventually raise them, with the timing becoming clearer as the economic outlook improves.</p>
<p>A federal election by May makes the promise of politically expedient fiscal largess likely and this should underpin the economic recovery.</p>
<p>There are other risks besides the COVID-19 pandemic. Most notable are the trade and geopolitical tensions that Australia, the US and others have with China.</p>
<p>While Australia may hold ethical and moral high-ground on many issues, it also faces a greater economic risk from disputes with China than most other countries.</p>
<p>China, for the most part, still needs Australia’s high-quality iron ore, some commodities and agricultural products, but it does not need too much else.</p>
<p>A key test will come with the re-opening of international borders.</p>
<p>Chinese tourists and students outnumbered all others leading into the pandemic, and whether these numbers return is questionable, should the relationship not improve.</p>
<p>While there is always risks, there is a certain optimism that 2022 will be a better year for the economy and possibly the start of a sustainable growth path.</p>

<p>I have scant sympathy for a high-profile person with such disregard for health and safety rules.</p>
<h3><a>Crying out for a statesman, we instead get mediocrity</a></h3>
<p>What a sorry excuse for a Prime Minister we have. Deborah Snow’s interview reveals a man who has done nothing, aspires to nothing, apologises for nothing and takes responsibility for nothing.</p>
<h3><a>Keep schools open for the children’s sake</a></h3>
<p>Even during COVID we need to ensure the mental well-being and general health by interacting.</p>
<h3><a>Coalition ‘redirection’ exposes the disabled</a></h3>
<p>Among all the stories of government inaction and chaos around Omicron there is an emerging pattern of individuals and organisations being told by suppliers that their RAT order has been taken by the federal government.</p>
<h3><a>Public should choose head of state, not politicians</a></h3>
<p>The Australian Republic Movement model for presidential nomination is hardly a “choice” for voters because political parties will control who gets on the ballot paper.</p>

<div>Microsoft’s historic $96b deal comes with a lot of games - and a spotty reputation</div>
<p>But along with the substantial benefits comes a few major concerns.</p>
<p>While Microsoft has a good reputation regarding the health and wellbeing of its teams, the worry would be that it wouldn’t do enough to clean house at Activision following the merger.</p>
<p>“Microsoft is committed to our journey for inclusion in every aspect of gaming, among both employees and players,” Mr Spencer said.</p>
<p>“We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment. We’re looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard.”</p>
<p>Also included as if to show receipts was a graphic of Microsoft’s gaming leadership team, a slim majority of whom are women, complete with preferred pronouns.</p>
<p>We can take some guidance in answering this question from Microsoft’s recent acquisition of Zenimax, which at $US7.5 billion was the previous biggest gaming aquisition but orders of magnitude smaller than Activision.</p>
<p>And yet games from studios Microsoft previously acquired — including Minecraft — are still offered everywhere, and the company maintains that it will support series on systems where they already have big built-in fanbases.</p>

<p>While senior Republicans in the US have condemned the way President Donald Trump fanned the flames of violent insurrection last week, Australia’s acting Prime Minister has deliberately downplayed the horror of what played out in Washington DC.</p>
<p>McCormack’s comments reflect a deliberate and concerted effort to embrace racist rhetoric, in order to downplay the political violence in the US. And their significance cannot be understated.</p>

<p>When Facebook decided last Thursday to cease distributing news content in Australia, the condemnation from the federal government and local media companies was swift and ferocious.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister accused the tech giant of “unfriending” the country. Front pages in capital city newspapers were dominated by headlines accusing Facebook of treating Australians with “contempt”.</p>
<p>Facebook’s decision to pull the plug on news was not only entirely consistent with the logic embraced by both the government and media companies who have been advocating for the code, but was predictable.</p>
<p>In that context, the reaction from local news outlets pretending that this was some unforeseen circumstance and effectively labelling Facebook an enemy of the state isn’t just self-serving, it’s incoherent.</p>
<p>It’s this tension that the media code is trying to resolve. Media companies want the tech giants to pay them money to make up for what they claim is lost advertising revenue.</p>
<p>Both of these strategies are equally legitimate, and both have their own risks. But it’s pretty clear one is much more heavily reliant on the decisions and imperatives of foreign-based tech companies driven by their own self-interest.</p>
<p>New financial penalties for companies that act as a vehicle for misinformation, particularly material that is likely to radicalise or incite violence, are another way to force platforms like Facebook to limit the social harm they can cause.</p>

<p>This time around things feel worse because we made the sacrifices needed to keep each other safe by locking down for months and months, and despite a litany of government failures we got vaccinated in record numbers.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, with hundreds of thousands of Australians still being blocked from visiting family interstate due to a logistical breakdown in testing capacity as a result of under-resourcing and arbitrary test-before-travel requirements.</p>
<p>At first glance, you might be wondering, isn’t this exactly what we did? After all, governments at a state and federal level have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on a range of measures to help contend with the worst of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Compounding the strain put on testing capacity by the rise in case numbers are the requirements implemented by states like Queensland and South Australia, which force fully vaccinated travellers to be tested within three days before their arrival.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire pandemic, Australian governments have relied on border controls, at an international and domestic level, and continue to rely on them, as an alternative to building up local health infrastructure.</p>
<p>Instead of actually responding to the crisis, the government decided the easiest and cheapest thing to do would be stop anyone coming in.</p>
<p>In fact, figures presented to the national cabinet in October showed that the country had 200 fewer ICU beds than at the beginning of the pandemic. Fewer beds, fewer contact tracers, fewer testing centres.</p>

<p>It was powerful symbolism, with Boland himself stating that he hoped the moment could be “a springboard for young Aboriginals to get involved in the game of cricket”.</p>
<p>Two of the other players there at the time, Rana Naved-ul-Hasan and Adil Rashid, backed up Rafiq’s allegation.</p>

<p>Welcome to the real story behind the Novak Djokovic saga.</p>
<p>Scott Morrison’s own comments over the past few days make this abundantly clear.</p>

<div>‘I don’t think, I know’: Macron breaks through Morrison’s fog of spin</div>

<p>“I don’t think, I know.”</p>
<p>This might have been because of the comma separating “I don’t think” and “I know”: the comma being among the more wishy-washy punctuation marks.</p>
<p>Or maybe, the speaker being French, I succumbed to cultural stereotyping and assumed this was dialogue sprung from a Jean-Luc Godard film, wherein a smouldering Jean-Paul Belmondo says in a Parisian bar: “I don’t think, I know.”</p>
<p>An assertion of epistemological crisis, in other words, as in: “I don’t think I know what is real or true. I am losing faith in the very possibility of knowledge itself.”</p>
<p>It was only after I watched the video report from the G20 summit in Rome that I realised Macron’s answer to the journalist’s question, “You think he lied to you?” was blunt, less a comma than a full stop.</p>
<p>To translate the French President’s comment into Australian: “No mate, I don’t think the bloke lied to me. I bloody know he did.”</p>
<p>The statement is bracing, like someone dunking your head underwater. It got me thinking about how Morrison-speak makes everything so hazy it’s like living in a Godard flick.</p>
<p>I know (or think I know) the channelling of historical subtext when I see it. Morrison might as well have said: “Well, would you disclose state secrets to those axe-grinding, cheese-eating surrender monkeys?”</p>
<p>But I can almost hear the plaintive cry: “Et tu, Biden?”</p>
<p>In Glasgow, nations are urging Australia to make deeper cuts earlier, nations including France and Britain. Meanwhile Australia is busily forging new alliances on the slow phase-out of fossil fuels with Russia and Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Is the rest of the world seeing through the fog from the fellah downunder?</p>

<p>In December 2019 I boarded a China Airlines flight to Taipei for what we in the trade call a “junket,” a propaganda tour, organised in this instance by Taiwan’s Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>Newcomers to Taipei also notice the number of streets named after cities and municipalities in China: Qingdao, Hangzhou, Tianjin, Nanjing and Guangzhou.</p>
<p>A briefing at the headquarters of a defence think-tank in a military compound gave us hours of mirth: a dimly lit hall, backdrop of sombre burgundy drapes, long table of experts in front of name tags, seven dark-suited men.</p>
<p>In August 2019 John Howard described the anti-government protestors in Hong Kong as “inspirational.” Last month Tony Abbott told a conference in Taipei that “nothing is more pressing right now than solidarity with Taiwan.”</p>
<p>Both former prime ministers can be criticised till kingdom come on foreign policy.</p>
<p>But when former Liberal leaders make rousing speeches about “solidarity” while the true believer serves up a near-pathological deficit of empathy, I must admit the heart breaks a little.</p>

<p>“Everyone is on their own journey,” she says. The lessons in resilience learned during the pandemic, with its unexpected turns, will stand you in good stead for life, she tells the graduates.</p>
<p>The principal’s speech quotes Martin Luther King Jr and Confucius, but even she would admit to being up-staged by the international students representative.</p>
<p>“Being an international student is hard, let me tell you,” the student starts. Studying is hard enough in one’s language, she says, let alone a foreign one.</p>
<p>She thanks the teachers who gave up their free time until she understood. She thanks the classmates who stood by her side.</p>
<p>“Since my parents do not fully understand English, allow me to say some words to them in Vietnamese …”</p>

<div>Scott Morrison embraces culture wars with religious bill</div>

<i>Herald Sun</i> published online last Wednesday. (Forgive me, high priests of the woke Twitterverse: for I have sinned and read Bolt!)
<p>Not for the first time, he criticised Morrison for shirking from the culture wars. Morrison has “said nothing on free speech, identity politics or ... cancel culture”, Bolt wrote.</p>
<i>cancel culture</i>” – check! – by protecting people of faith from those who seek to “marginalise and coerce and silence” them. In an age of “
<i>identity politics</i>” – and that’s a trifecta! – people are often “identified by our gender, our age, our sexuality, our race, our ethnicity”.
<p>And Morrison went on to say that in relation to these attributes we’re rightly protected against discrimination, but human beings are also “soul and spirit”, and these elements also deserve protection.</p>
<p>This is the same PM who in the aftermath of his 2019 election win pledged to “burn for the Australian people” – which seemed a weird turn of phrase to everyone but Pentecostals.</p>
<p>Classroom material has obviously evolved since my time!</p>
<p>All this said, I’m cheering for the bill. For as a person of fervent faith and belief, I surely come out a winner. As the late and great contrarian Christopher Hitchens liked to say, the Enlightenment is my faith.</p>
<p>This arguably means I could say whatever I like in this column and not get sacked, as long as I make the statement in good faith.</p>

<p>In the “best of” lists that always sprout this time of year, the category of best TV show invariably features <a><i>Mare of Easttown</i></a>, and rightly so.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we’re naturally drawn to shows such as <a><i>Succession</i></a> because we love watching the very rich with their palatial homes and luxury yachts coming undone, forced to make haste on their private jet to Sarajevo.</p>
<i>Mare,</i> or even Scott Morrison’s 2019 victory.
<p>As I’ve noted on several occasions, independent Zali Steggall’s ultimately successful bid to unseat Tony Abbott in Warringah had progressives mesmerised. Meanwhile, they, and the Labor Party, forgot there was an election to win.</p>
<i>actively</i> campaigned in Higgins, home to the establishment blue-bloods of Toorak and Malvern, replacing the party’s original candidate with high-profile senior barrister Fiona McLeod.

<i>pay no heed </i>to these blue-ribbon rumbles lest you lose touch with the battlers. Mind you, I’m not sure why Wilson’s offering Labor this sound advice. Why not keep mum and let progressives “miscalculate”?
<p>Liberal incumbents are trying to defuse what they know is a threat. Indeed, Wilson gives the game away in referring to the candidates’ line of being tired of their local MP’s voting record as a “poll-tested phrase”.</p>
<p>So the phrase polls well, huh? Maybe voters in these electorates are indeed tired of the liberal Liberals struggling to exert influence within the Coalition and falling meekly into line.</p>
<p>All voicing their frustration with the policies eroding the party’s moral core on climate change, on women, on integrity in politics, because whatever their day jobs most women have solid expertise in cleaning up dirt.</p>
<p>We could be in for a cliffhanger.</p>

<p>If, as British prime minister Harold Wilson famously quipped, a week is a long time in politics, it’s an aeon during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Even the birth of yet another baby – his second in less than two years with new wife Carrie – couldn’t soften the public’s disgust.</p>
<p>Then along comes Omicron. Within days, cases in NSW reach record highs.</p>
<p>The upside is we have the luxury of debating the likelihood of worst-case Omicron scenarios wherein hospitals get overwhelmed with the sick, rather than finding the wave already upon us and the options few.</p>
<p>If I was a cricket enthusiast I’d no doubt find a current analogy to describe this very long game.</p>
<p>Some public health experts want numbers slashed at Victoria’s Boxing Day Test. They want to ban large gatherings in pubs and nightclubs until scientists can get a better handle on Omicron.</p>
<p>My only response is a sinking feeling, and the question emblematic of summertime Australia: are we there yet?</p>

<p>But every difficulty can be met with grace, and I’m grateful for sound advice when it comes my way.</p>
<p>For instance, after prolonged lockdowns many of us need a refresher on social skills. And in the lead-up to the holiday season people were offering sensible tips about <i>keeping yourself nice </i>when in company.</p>
<i> staying on the line for a short customer satisfaction survey</i> to give “feedback” on your “experience” with the company.
<p>So you complete the bloody survey, and, worse, pretend you’re a satisfied customer, lest your honesty means the disembodied customer service assistant’s children go hungry.</p>
<p>Surely no employer would have the time or patience to read through such a document. Not unless they have a personality disorder.</p>

<div>Election race tightens after Morrison takes a summer battering</div>
<p>Scott Morrison needed a summer of love. He got a summer of loathing instead.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister has taken a battering from voters over his handling of the pandemic during a time of heightened anxiety over the Omicron strain and real fury over the test kit shortage.</p>
<p>Voters used to say Morrison and the Coalition were listening to them and focused on the right issues. He led on this measure by 13 percentage points last May when case numbers were down and budget spending was up.</p>
<p>Now Anthony Albanese and Labor hold the upper hand on the same question. Their lead is only a single percentage point but is part of a shift against the government on all fronts.</p>
<p>Whatever the question, the government has lost ground. Who is best to lead the country? Morrison and the Coalition are ahead by three percentage points but they used to be ahead by nine. At their peak in May they led by 18 points.</p>
<p>Who is honest and trustworthy? Morrison led on this question from April to October but slipped badly in November and has now lost his lead. Albanese is ahead with a small margin, at just a single percentage point, but the trend has gone his way.</p>
<p>The January survey compounds the impression of a government sliding down a dusty hill while trying to dig its boots into the ground or grab hold of something to stop the descent.</p>
<p>Liberal and Nationals MPs were hoping Australians would emerge from the Christmas and New Year holiday feeling more comfortable about their fortunes and putting the government in a good position to contest the election.</p>
<p>But the summer of discontent has wrecked the dream of a snap poll in March and tightened the race for the election in May.</p>
<p>Because the Resolve Political Monitor gives respondents a way to make unprompted remarks, the frustration with Morrison echoes through the results.</p>
<p>“We’ve been under-prepared during this whole pandemic,” said one respondent. “He isn’t taking responsibility.”</p>
<p>“Too slow to react,” said another. “The RATs issue is just the latest one. We should be prepared for this.”</p>
<p>Voters are not convinced by Albanese, however. “He should be outlining his vision now in the lead-up to the election, but I hear nothing of him,” said one respondent.</p>
<p>“What has he made better during the last term?” asked another. “I cannot think of any positive impact.”</p>
<p>What stands out is the way the Morrison and the Coalition have lost standing among ordinary Australians on the basic test of managing the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Omicron summer has led to new, harsher assessment of this leader and his government.</p>
<div>Australia no longer has a credible way of calculating how many people have COVID-19</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>All this seems a bit ad hoc, like policy patched together on the run.</p>
<p>Yet state and federal health authorities have known for months that Australia was facing exactly this situation because as soon as they shelved the COVID-zero strategy, it was recognised that the virus would spread. Where was the planning?</p>
<p>The living-with-COVID strategy emerged in large part because Australia had achieved commendably high vaccination rates. But the Omicron variant of COVID-19, with its high rate of transmissibility, has proved to be a completely different beast.</p>
<p>But one outcome of the shift to RATs is a severe deficiency of data about transmission of the virus, its spread throughout the community, the infection rate per head of population, and more.</p>
<p>Such data is vital for ensuring fast, effective and appropriate hospital responses, for determining the timing of booster vaccines, and for devising strategies for managing the workforce generally. It also assists in identifying variants swiftly.</p>
<p>But in recent weeks, the directives about testing and reporting have become increasingly confusing and at times contradictory. They have been as rubbery as a pair of thongs.</p>
<p>We have said it before and it demands repeating: rapid antigen tests need to be free of charge and widely accessible to everybody.</p>
<div><p>Australians truly deserve better than the vacillating responses coming from governments at this time. They want genuine leadership, compassion and clear, accurate messages to help them navigate the way ahead.</p></div>

<div>Governments can’t wing return to school plan</div>

<p>The failure of governments to plan for obvious problems has been one of the most frustrating aspects of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Another such challenge is coming in three weeks, however, when schools are due to go back after the summer break.</p>
<p>NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet says he is “incredibly confident” that schools will go back on time and that it is “not negotiable”, but he has been guilty of over-confidence and under-planning in the past.</p>
<p>The Herald agrees that schools should go back as normal. NSW school children have missed out on the equivalent of half a year of school over the past two years due to COVID-19 restrictions and the costs are mounting.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Some countries only send home the specific classes ... or in some cases, they only send home the students who have tested positive.’</p></blockquote>
<p>There has already been an increase in children seeking help for mental health problems. And that is not counting the burden of home learning on working parents.</p>
<p>Governments should learn from the northern hemisphere where schools have already returned from their Christmas break.</p>
<p>Rather than close whole schools after a single case, some countries only send home the specific classes where the case is detected or in some cases, they only send home the students who have tested positive.</p>
<p>The other huge challenge will be finding enough teachers. In Britain, it has been forecast that a quarter of teachers will be off sick at times during the peak of the Omicron wave.</p>
<p>Governments should mandate third dose boosters for teachers and give them priority access in vaccination lines. They are frontline staff.</p>
<p>If teacher numbers still fall short, schools may have to merge classes. Schools should also be given extra funding to recruit casual teachers.</p>
<p>The federal government has asked states to submit their plans for re-opening by Wednesday but even that is cutting it fine. It will take weeks to allocate staff and distribute rapid antigen tests and train teachers in the new rules.</p>
<p>After that — but well before students return — the government must communicate the plan to parents and students. Everyone must be prepared for what is likely to be a difficult February.</p>
<p>There must be no repeat of the flying by the seat of the pants which has characterised the past month.</p>

<p>In Sydney, two vaccination hubs on the north shore were incorrectly listed for weeks on the NSW vaccine booking website which had allowed parents to make appointments that were not available.</p>
<p>So, in opening up, Mr Morrison cannot afford to appear the federal government is again “strolling out” vaccinations, this time for the youngest school children.</p>

<p>We can all thank Novak Djokovic for one thing. The legal action he took challenging his deportation from Australia has thrown a searching public light on all the key players in this debacle.</p>
<p>But Australian officialdom has come out of the saga looking worse than Djokovic.</p>
<p>The fact is Mr Tiley wanted Djokovic in the country. He wrote in a November letter that it “goes to the heart of the viability of the Australian Open”. So it appears he simply hoped for the best.</p>
<p>The court case illuminated all this, but did not adjudicate any of it, except for the last point: that Djokovic was mistreated and lied to at the airport.</p>
<p>Besides, if, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison says, we are to “ride the wave” of our own, home-grown Omicron tsunami, it’s difficult to understand the practical utility of deporting one unvaccinated man.</p>

<p>The issue of how to alleviate these staff shortages is likely to be high on the agenda again when national cabinet meets on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, national cabinet has already narrowed the definition of a close contact and shortened the compulsory period of isolation from two weeks to as little as one.</p>
<p>These changes are already less than ideal from the point of view of disease control. Some of those released early into the community are still likely to be contagious.</p>
<p>But the risk was moderate and some relaxation was unavoidable, given the shortage of workers.</p>
<p>The Herald accepts that some further measures might be needed to keep the economy turning over but allowing bar staff to turn up for work sick with COVID-19 is not one of them.</p>
<p>ACTU secretary Sally McManus has said that if rules are further weakened there must be safety plans to protect co-workers.</p>
<p>The current shortage of rapid antigen test kits creates another major obstacle to bringing workers back from isolation early.</p>
<p>Tests given to workers for daily checks will not be available for health workers, school students and the vulnerable.</p>
<p>Further relaxation of isolation rules should only be in strategic sectors of the economy and based on the best scientific evidence of infection control. It should be linked to the availability of RA tests.</p>

<p>Last year the tiny Caribbean island state of Barbados achieved something of which Australia’s political system seems incapable. It dropped its ties to the British monarchy and became a republic.</p>
<p>But the ever-optimistic Australian Republican Movement has crafted a proposal which it hopes will break the political deadlock by healing the rift inside the republican camp over how to select a president that thwarted the 1999 referendum.</p>
<div>Politicians must heed their health experts</div>
<p>Since the first days of the COVID-19 pandemic, health experts have repeatedly cautioned government authorities about the inherent dangers in allowing the virus to rip through the community.</p>
<p>The fear that public hospitals, aged care homes, doctors and ancillary healthcare networks could become overwhelmed with sick people, and the obvious dysfunction and tragedy that would present, is why we had lockdowns in 2020 and 2021.</p>
<p>Now the hospital systems in the nation’s two biggest states are close to breaking point. </p>
<p>All this is because federal and state governments – sometimes in opposition to the health advice offered by their leading health officers – have adopted strategies that all but guarantee the virus will become endemic.</p>
<p>They eased social restrictions, lifted lockdowns as vaccination rates topped 90 per cent, opened interstate borders and more.</p>
<p>Perhaps the path to “endemic” was deliberate, a decision taken behind closed doors and never properly explained. Community patience, and confidence in the ability of authorities to properly manage pandemic risks, had waned.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the number of active COVID-19 cases has soared along the east coast in recent weeks, especially in NSW and Victoria. And sure enough, the states’ hospital systems and aged care homes have come under severe pressure.</p>

<p>As for Australians generally, they don’t “want to spend every afternoon talking about politics,” Mr Morrison said.</p>
<i>that’</i>s a big idea.”
<p>And again: “Economy strong, Australians safe, Australians together. That’s what I’m trying to do. Every single day.”</p>
<p>Safety, security, togetherness. It might be a modern-day rendering of Mr Howard’s infamous slogan – and no doubt Mr Morrison would be delighted to emulate his predecessor’s electoral success.</p>
