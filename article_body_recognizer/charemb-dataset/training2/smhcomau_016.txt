<p>The NBL hopes it will complete all seven games scheduled for this weekend after COVID issues in recent weeks, while the Sydney Kings expect to have imports Jaylen Adams and RJ Hunter back fit for this round which will be a big boost to their hopes.</p>
<h3>WNBL begins Victorian summer</h3>
<p>The WNBL has begun its run of games in Victoria during January, with the Perth Lynx beating Southside Flyers 83-79 in Ballarat on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The league was due to play 15 games around the state during the coming weeks, with the Lynx playing in many of the games as they are unable to host teams in Western Australia at present.</p>
<p>The Lynx look a serious contender despite being away from home, with WNBA forward Marina Mabrey starring with 23 points, nine rebounds and six assists in the win.</p>
<p>Melbourne Boomers take on the Lynx in Ballarat on Monday in what should be another stern test of both sides’ title hopes.</p>

<div>Delly masterclass nets United's sixth win in a row</div>
<div><div><h5>By Russell Bennett</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 16, 2022 — 8.53pm</time></span><span>first published at <time>4.25pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>A vintage display from guard Matthew Dellavedova led Melbourne United to their sixth straight win in a tense clash with fellow title aspirants the Illawarra Hawks at the WIN Entertainment Centre in Wollongong on Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>His scoring output set a new career-high from NBA, NBL, and US college games he’d played in.</p>
<p>In a sign of just how impressive his display was, Dellavedova entered the clash with season averages of just eight points per game on just 32 per cent from the floor.</p>
<p>He would finish this clash with 61 per cent shooting - including an astonishing 63 per cent from deep.</p>
<p>Lual-Acuil, White, and Agada were beasts on the boards - particularly at the offensive end, generating plenty of extra looks for the visitors.</p>
<p>As both teams looked to push the ball in transition in the early going - looking for shots at the rim - they both found their range from deep as the contest progressed.</p>
<p>Justinian Jessup and big man Harry Froling led the way in that regard for the Hawks, shooting a combined 9-12 from beyond the arc.</p>
<p>Froling’s confidence continued to grow throughout the game, providing the Hawks with a real point of difference, but the combination of Dellavedova’s scoring and play-making ability set the visitors apart.</p>
<p>“Luc Longley said perfectly in Australian Story that he was still unlearning what it was to be an NBA player,” Anstey said.</p>
<p>“Today, in Illawarra, Matthew Dellavedova did a lot of on-court unlearning of what made his NBA career so successful, and reminded plenty of people how good he really is.”</p>
<p>On Saturday night, the Brisbane Bullets were firing on all cylinders as they proved far too strong for a South East Melbourne Phoenix side that last played an NBL game 28 days prior.</p>
<p>The Bullets led by a whopping 31-6 margin at the end of the first, which the Phoenix couldn’t recover from.</p>
<p>Nathan Sobey led a balanced scoring effort for Brisbane.</p>
<p>United are second on the standings behind the Perth Wildcats, with the Phoenix - who have still only played five games so far this season - in fourth behind the Hawks.</p>

<div>‘We should be embarrassed’: Kings’ late collapse hands Breakers win</div>
<p>Sydney coach Chase Buford has told his team they should be “embarrassed” after his Kings gave up a 10-point lead against the bottom-placed Breakers on Sunday afternoon to hand the New Zealand side their second win of the season.</p>
<p>The Breakers failed to lead through the first three-quarters of the match but took advantage of a major fourth-quarter collapse from the Kings and finished the game on an 18-1 run to claiming the boilover result at Qudos Bank Arena 82-75.</p>
<p>Losing the final quarter 30-18, the late-game collapse has become a pattern for the Kings in recent weeks with Buford adamant the issue could be fixed. The Kings have won just one of eight final quarters this year.</p>
<p>“I’ll raise my hand, that’s on me,” he said about the problem.</p>
<p>“It’s something we’ve got to work on. It has cost us in three or four of our losses so far. We have to make quick decisions with the basketball, we can’t get sticky and hesitant with the game of the line.”</p>
<p>The Breakers managed just 30 points in the first half before catching fire in the second. The win is a major confidence boost for the New Zealanders, who have been forced to remain in Australia due to the current COVID-19 situation.</p>
<p>The loss is the third straight defeat for the eighth-placed Kings.</p>
<p>“We should be embarrassed by the way we finished the game. It’s as simple as that,” Buford said.</p>
<p>“It’s got to hurt because that’s not good enough.”</p>
<p>Breakers star Finn Delany led the way for the visitors with 21 points and nine rebounds.</p>
<p>“I am just happy for the boys. They’ve been through a lot ... it’s a good win for us,” he said.</p>
<p>“We’ve had guys in and out, and we continue to build chemistry on the floor. We know we have to stay patient, keep working and get better.”</p>
<p>Kings forward Xavier Cooks tallied 19 points and 13 rebounds, but needed further help from his teammates.</p>
<p>The Kings are now in a dire spot mid-season with major concerns over their shooting ability.</p>
<p>Star recruit RJ Hunter went down in Sydney’s second loss of the season to the Illawarra Hawks and has been ruled out for the rest of the season due to the knee injury.</p>
<p>The Kings will face back to back games against the Brisbane Bullet in their next two clashes.</p>

<div>Mark Wood’s exhilarating pace barrage shows what could have been</div>
<p>There’s something raw and real about Test cricket when fast bowling becomes express.</p>
<p>Ask the Australians who faced Mark Wood as he demolished the home team’s batting line-up on Sunday in a career-best performance on a sporting Bellerive Oval pitch.</p>
<p>Wood claimed 6-37 as the Australians were bowled out on the third day of the fifth and final Ashes Test in Hobart for just 155, their lowest Test total for four years.</p>
<p>Tellingly, his first four wickets came from short balls aimed at the batsmen, starting with a brute of a bouncer that caught Usman Khawaja’s glove the night before. There’s line and length then there’s brute strength.</p>
<p>When the physical challenge of self-preservation overrides any of the nuances which can make cricket’s purest form such an intriguing contest it becomes a different game.</p>
<p>It was certainly a different game for Travis Head, who bludgeoned the second century of his COVID-19 truncated series in the first innings to seemingly set up the game for Australia.</p>
<p>During that counter-attacking century, Head faced just two genuinely short balls from Wood and played them both awkwardly. Most were around off stump, feeding his favourite shot square on the off side.</p>
<p>There was none of that on Sunday as Wood homed in on Head’s body and, almost inevitably, caught the glove as he half-flicked, half-fended down the leg side to fall for just eight.</p>
<p>Cummins is a respectable lower-order batsman but after almost an hour at the crease gaining a collection of bruises he decided to preserve his body and aimed a wild swing at a delivery from Wood which cannoned into the stumps.</p>
<p>Australia could have been bowled out for 150 then too and the series may have looked more like a contest.</p>
<p>However, Broad and Anderson were rested for the opening Test in Brisbane and Wood was rested for the second Test in Adelaide.</p>
<p>While Anderson, 39, and Broad, 35, wouldn’t have been able to play every Test, England should have thrown the kitchen sink at the start of the series and worried about that later.</p>
<p>Instead, both bowlers have delivered more overs since the series was decided and the Ashes retained.</p>
<p>Going 2-0 down after Adelaide without putting their best attack on the park was a serious case of over-thinking by muddled minds.</p>
<p>Anderson explained why he couldn’t play the last Test in conditions tailor made for him under lights on a green surface.</p>
<p>Which does not matter because the Ashes and the series are both long gone.</p>
<p>Wood appears a better bowler than he’s ever been. Lengthening his run-up to generate more momentum through the crease has taken the strain off his body and lessened his injuries.</p>
<p>Sadly Wood has managed just 25 Tests at the age of 32, such has been his battles to stay fit over a seven-year career.</p>
<p>This late burst of bowling success for England is hardly a fillip for the future but the rare glimpse of a golden sunset on an otherwise grey and murky tour.</p>
<p>Anderson and Broad are in their farewell Ashes series, Wood may struggle to keep his extreme pace up for the next Ashes in 18 months and Ollie Robinson resembles more of a talented teddy bear than any sort of action hero.</p>

<div>Djokovic an easy target in anti-vaxxer witch hunt</div>
<p>Clearly, the outcome of the Federal Court case on Sunday has implications for Novak Djokovic. How about for the Australian Open?</p>
<p>People are saying he is getting special treatment because he is Novak Djokovic, when in fact it’s the opposite, as now it’s only because he <i>is</i> a high-profile and “influential” person that he is facing deportation.</p>
<p>The facts are that Djokovic came to Australia with one sole aim, to try and defend his Australian Open title. Agree with him or not, and unpopular as he is here, it is accepted he met the rules.</p>
<div>England batters would get found out in a fish and chip shop</div>
<p>If you are taking guard on off-stump and are getting bowled around your legs, like Ollie Pope was in Hobart, it cannot be right.</p>
<p>What is paramount is where your eyes are - they need to be on middle and off stump. You have to find where that position is for your eyes. If you crouch - like Pope does, which is a problem - you will need to get further over towards the off side.</p>
<p>You can have all the shots in the world, like Pope does - but they are no use if you cannot stay in. He looks a good player at times, and then he does the most stupid things. It is all because he is worried about his off-stump and just outside.</p>
<p>Only two players have enhanced their reputations on this Ashes tour. One is a fast bowler, Mark Wood, the other a young kid, Zak Crawley, playing in the last two Test matches.</p>
<p>Wood’s pace unsettled so many of the Aussie batsmen, hitting them on the gloves, arms and body.</p>
<p>He got them out of their comfort zone, resorting to having a dart at hooking him and getting out.</p>
<p>He was a breath of fresh air and if he can stay fit, he will have lots more success.</p>
<p>He has a simple, orthodox technique with lovely timing. Please, Crawley, do not be a flash in the pan as we need a lot more from you.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Only two players have enhanced their reputations on this Ashes tour. One is a fast bowler, Mark Wood, the other a young kid, Zak Crawley, playing in the last two Test matches.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Then, there were a few players who did enough to keep their reputations. Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad had limited opportunities, but when they did play, they showed their quality.</p>
<p>Ollie Robinson was fine, but I just feel if he is going to be a factor abroad, he needs a bit more pace.</p>
<p>In his short international career, he has got away with “putting it there” and been lucky with a few bowler-friendly pitches.</p>
<p>More venom from his height would make him a real handful on any surface, like Joel Garner and Curtly Ambrose. To increase his speed, he must get fitter and leaner.</p>
<p>Then there were the flops. Jos Butler dropped catches and his batting was dreadful. Early on, his feet were all over the place, leaving him too far away from the ball when it was around off stump.</p>
<p>He was caught at cover from a leading edge poking at the ball and then whacking it to deep midwicket as soon as he came in.</p>
<p>Buttler is great against ordinary bowlers, but against top-class bowling he was found out.</p>
<p>Haseeb Hameed, I am sad to say, has not got it. No matter how decent he looks in the nets or in county cricket, he has struggled and will struggle at international level playing like he does in a straight line.</p>
<p>Rory Burns is ugly to watch. If that is the best of what English cricket has to offer, then God help England. His technique you would not give to a friend.</p>
<p>The guy has tremendous determination and guts. I take my hat off to him and full credit for everything he gets out of his batting, but England need to find someone better.</p>

<p>Sociology professor Lauren Rosewarne, who specialises in gender, pop culture and politics at the University of Melbourne, says one part of the trend is not entirely new.</p>
<p>“We’ve been through periods in pop culture history where the stars of the day have played with our ideas of gender, Boy George and David Bowie being two obvious examples.”</p>
<p>The difference in 2022, says Rosewarne, is that it’s a reflection of the widespread questioning of gender itself.</p>
<p>“A binary masculine/feminine identity isn’t the reality for an increasing number of people – particularly young people,” she says.</p>
<p>It’s a long way from the days of Lynx two-in-one gel and shaving foam. Or as one Twitter user put it, “Remember when we used “Metrosexual” because we needed to distinguish that there are straight cis men who shower?”</p>
<p>“The term ‘metrosexual’ was, for a brief period of time, being used to describe things like men’s sculpted facial hair and an interest in fashion,” says Rosewarne.</p>
<p>These women are sex symbols. Kardashian and Fox in particular built their brands on their looks. Wilde recently posed naked to promote her partnership with a new skincare line.</p>
<p>So what’s going on? Is it the pandemic? That we should eat, drink and date heavily-tattooed boys, for tomorrow we die? Or is it that the acceptance of gender non-conforming roles isn’t limited to Generation Z?</p>
<p>And after staring down the barrel of the red-hot male gaze for so long, have they grown weary of it? Perhaps the scrutiny they’ve faced for decades has given them a type of fearlessness that these men might be drawn to.</p>
<p>Wilde met Styles after casting him in her upcoming movie, Don’t Worry Darling. Before they were officially an item, she expressed her reasons to US Vogue. </p>
<p>“[Harry’s] very modern, and I hope that this brand of confidence as a male that Harry has –truly devoid of any traces of toxic masculinity – is indicative of his generation and therefore the future of the world.”</p>
<p>As far as celebrity trends go, this one might be a keeper.</p>

<p>I texted back my reply to my friend: “Oh, I can relate.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I am bigger than seven telephone books of regret for all the stuff that I’ve done.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There have always been those who hear this from mums, roll their eyes and think, “You wanted children. You asked for this.”</p>
<p>Because so many, even our closest loved ones, don’t or can’t see it either.</p>
<p>We were a furtive society with our little secrets. But secrets are for the forbidden, the taboo, the shameful.</p>

<h3><a>Shore and ore: Two factors driving record rent rises</a></h3>
<p>The top 10 places for rent increases around Australia are either coastal holiday hotspots or resources towns.</p>
<h3><a>‘Not really that great’: The ripple effect of booming rents in Byron Bay</a></h3>

<h3><a>A landlords’ market: Perth tops nation for rental yields as prices boom</a></h3>
<p>Got a rental property gathering dust? Now might be the time to put it online, with new figures showing it costs more to rent in Perth than it does in Melbourne.</p>
<h3><a>Melbourne house rents the nation’s cheapest despite record high</a></h3>
<p>Melbourne house rents rose to a record $445 per week over the December quarter, but despite the leap they’re still the cheapest of Australia’s capital cities.</p>
<h3><a>The city where house rents are growing fastest in Australia</a></h3>
<p>The second-best performing city was Canberra, where house rents rose by 12.5 per cent over the year to $675 per week.</p>
<div><h5><a>Adelaide</a></h5></div>
<h3><a>‘A landlord’s market’: Big drop in rentals signals tough times for tenants</a></h3>
<p>Rental vacancy rates around Australia continue to be low and will probably tighten even further over 2022.</p>
<h3><a>How to end a fixed-term lease early</a></h3>
<p>Terminating a fixed-term lease before it expires is usually expensive for tenants, but there are certain circumstances where hefty costs can be avoided.</p>
<div><h5>Commercial real estate</h5></div>
<h3><a>Blackstone swoops on $925m office as leases show signs of comeback</a></h3>
<p>Private equity giant Blackstone has bought on a half share in the Sydney Grosvenor Place tower, giving heart to office property investors that the sector is coming back to life.</p>
<h3><a>Lendlease and Keppel REIT take $327m punt on North Sydney office growth</a></h3>
<p>Global property giant Lendlease and Singapore-based Keppel REIT are taking a large bet on the growth of the North Sydney office market with the purchase of a $327.7 million tower development.</p>
<h3><a>Big investors chase stable childcare assets</a></h3>

<h3><a>Investa inks lease deal of the year as office markets steady</a></h3>
<p>The major landlord has signed one of the significant deals of the year to retain insurance giant Aon in Sydney after markets were hard hit by the pandemic and lockdowns.</p>
<div>Shore and ore: Two factors driving record rent rises</div>
<p>Record rent rises across Australia are being driven by two factors: shore and ore.</p>
<p>“When you look at the top 10 areas for rent increases, it’s all either coastal holiday areas or resources towns,” said Domain chief of research and economics Dr Nicola Powell.</p>
<p>“I think this is the time they’ll be showing their biggest increases too, as it’s the big changeover time in rental properties for the holiday season, so they’ll be at a real pressure point.”</p>
<p>So, what are the top rental movers and shakers around Australia, and why?</p>
<p>CRESCENT HEAD, NSW: Median rent $680; Annual rise 54.5 per cent</p>
<p>On the Macleay Valley Coast, 340 kilometres north of Sydney in the Kempsey Shire, Crescent Head is set between the ocean – with a world-renowned surf break – and the river.</p>
<p>BROULEE, NSW: Median rent $750; Annual rise 50.0 per cent</p>
<p>On the south coast, between Batemans Bay and Moruya in the Eurobodalla region, 300km from Sydney, this is a favourite spot for those who love outdoor life and a favourite holiday destination for Canberrans.</p>
<p>MOUNT COOLUM, QUEENSLAND: Median rent $750; Annual rise 47.1 per cent</p>
<p>A Sunshine Coast favourite, Mount Coolum encompasses many distinct areas, and the staggering rental growth has mostly been driven by a smaller sub-sector, locals say.</p>
<p>“The exciting part is right on the beach, which the locals call The Boardwalk, and rent growth there is driving increases for the whole area,” said James Henley of Richardson Wrench, Coolum.</p>
<p>SOUTH HEDLAND, WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Median rent $588; Annual rise 47.0 per cent</p>
<p>Resources prices are still rising, so people continue to be keen to move to the Pilbara’s South Hedland, a suburb of Port Hedland, to work for the iron ore industry.</p>
<p>With borders snapping closed for a long time, it means there’s no fly-in-fly-out workforce, so everyone has either had to buy properties or rent them. This has in turn put unprecedented pressure on rental prices.</p>
<p>“Resources areas are generally showing a significant rise in rents as a result of mining doing so well,” Dr Powell said.</p>
<p>VAUCLUSE, SYDNEY: Median rent $2900; Annual rise 45.0 per cent</p>
<p>With the COVID-19 lockdowns making everyone realise how important lifestyle is, there are still some who prefer to stay in Sydney but, if they can afford it, live in some of the most salubrious areas.</p>
<p>Vaucluse, in the eastern suburbs, is one of those.</p>
<p>“It also has its own little beach, so it’s a good compromise rather than going to the coast,” said Dion Markovics of Raine Horne Double Bay.</p>
<p>“It’s always a very lovely place to live, and there’s been a lot more demand than supply.”</p>
<p>DOUBLE BAY, SYDNEY: Median rent $2000; Annual rise 42.9 per cent</p>
<p>It’s also very close to the beaches at Bondi, Coogee and Clovelly.</p>
<p>“People are really looking for lifestyle and fresh air,” Mr Markovics said.</p>
<p>“The changes in the infrastructure in Double Bay mean it’s now appealing to a younger demographic too, which is creating a lot of supply for both rental property and homes to buy, pushing up the prices of both.”</p>
<p>QUEENSTOWN, TASMANIA: Median rent $250; Annual rise 42.9 per cent</p>
<p>The largest town in Tasmania’s west, Queenstown was once the world’s richest mining town. Now there are studies to see if it might be worth reopening the copper mine, with resource prices soaring so high.</p>
<p>“We’ve had so much demand for properties and very low stock, which has been pushing rents higher and higher.”</p>
<p>PORT HEDLAND, WESTERN AUSTRALIA: Median rent $851; Annual rise 41.6 per cent</p>
<p>Port Hedland, like its suburb South Hedland, and the home of the country’s biggest bulk export port servicing the iron ore mines inland, continues to experience rents rising rapidly as a result of surging iron ore prices.</p>
<p>The industry has proved pretty impervious to the COVID slump, and rents have risen sharply accordingly. In the previous September quarter, house rents skyrocketed by 45.4 per cent.</p>
<p>WEST GLADSTONE, QUEENSLAND (units): Median rent $250; Annual rise 38.9 per cent</p>
<p>Often described as the gateway to the Southern Great Barrier Reef – think Heron Island and Lady Musgrave Island among others – West Gladstone is an area with a proud industrial history but also a tourist favourite.</p>
<p>Unit rents have risen sharply with an influx of other Queensland and inter-state renters coming to a place that’s a very pleasant escape and offers work.</p>
<p>SOUTH HEDLAND, WESTERN AUSTRALIA (units): Median rent $451; Annual rise 38.8 per cent</p>
<p>BUNDALL, QUEENSLAND: Median rent $895; Annual rise 37.7 per cent</p>
<p>A suburb on the Gold Coast, on the Nerang River, just behind Southport, Bundall is considered by many to be a picturesque and relaxed place to live, with a network of canals creating waterfront homes, and the beach, cafes and shops nearby.</p>

<h3><a>Why this year’s Sydney property market is one for the record books</a></h3>
<p>As first-home buyers flooded back into the market in 2020, they were suddenly washed back out again by investors.</p>
<h3><a>Gavel-lanche: The year Sydney’s auction market went crazy</a></h3>
<p>Sydney’s property market has never seen a year like 2021, with low stock levels and even lower interest rates fuelling rapid price growth.</p>
<h3><a>Australia’s most searched property locations in 2021</a></h3>
<p>The pandemic may have seen people run to the regions but here’s where buyers are still searching the most.</p>
<div>Four-bedroom house offered free, with just one catch</div>
<p>It’s the home that’s free to a good home: A four-bedroom Sydney house available for free, with one catch.</p>
<p>Only the house itself is on offer, not the land, and the new owner must arrange to remove it and transport it somewhere else.</p>
<p>The residence offers room for the whole family, with four bedrooms, and is advertised as being about 60 years old and in good condition with a modern kitchen and laundry.</p>
<p>Sydney’s median house price is almost $1.5 million, the latest Domain data shows.</p>
<p>Even in Kirrawee in Sydney’s south, where the free house currently stands, the median house price reached $1.3 million in the 12 months to September, up 18.2 per cent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Relocating a house can cost in the ballpark of $70,000, depending on the circumstances, plus reconnection to services and plaster setting at its new site.</p>
<p>Owners have been known to sell houses for relocation, without the land. The house used as the set for Australian film The Castle sold for $40,000 at auction in 2017, when it was offered as a relocatable home. How’s the serenity?</p>
<p>Another house-only deal made headlines the following year when it was offered for $5000. Set on a block slated for a new build, the house could have cost up to $25,000 to demolish instead.</p>
<p>The deadline to clear the Kirrawee site is the end of February.</p>

<div>Fresh record expected for Bill Papas’ waterfront holiday home</div>
<p>Hot on the heels of selling alleged fraudster Bill Papas’ home in Rozelle last week, liquidators are pressing ahead with the sale of the colourful soccer identity’s luxury holiday home on the NSW Central Coast.</p>
<p>The Hamptons-style home in Wagstaffe is expected to set a record for the region, with agents at Central Coast Belle Property putting a $12 million to $15 million price tag on the waterfront property.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be the first time the property has set a record for the Central Coast – it made history when it sold for $9.5 million in 2020.</p>
<p>However, by the time the allegations went public, Papas was in Greece. His assets have since been frozen and an arrest warrant was issued for him late last year for contempt of court for allegedly breaching those orders.</p>
<p>The Wagstaffe property was the most expensive and desirable property purchased by Mr Papas in recent years. Mr Tesoriero purchased a limestone brick home in 2019 in Melbourne’s Hawthorn for $7.95 million.</p>
<p>To advance the marketing campaign for the Wagstaffe property, agents have hired Australian model Elyse Knowles to appear in a high-end lifestyle shoot at the home.</p>
<p>Belle Property’s Cathy Baker is handling the sale of the north-facing property that is named “Agave”.</p>
<p>“From the resort-style pool to the private entertaining area and the well-thought-out bedrooms and chic light-filled living spaces, it is the epitome of coastal living and the ideal holiday home,” she said.</p>
