<p>Andy Murray has won the third set to take a two sets to one lead over Nikoloz Basilashvili.</p>
<p>The pair are on serve in the fourth set, this match has been a power hitting delight as Basilashvili tees off at every opportunity and Murray has responded when chances arise.</p>
<p>Murray just held serve to make it 2-2 on John Cain Arena.</p>

<p>Steve Johnson was injured and ailing so he swung for the fences and it proved the right tactic for the right time as he came back from two sets to one down to beat Australia’s Jordan Thompson in five sets.</p>
<p>Johnson hit hard for his winners and quickly conceded the point if it wasn’t working out as he scored a 7-6, 6-7, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3 victory.</p>

<p>World no. 2 Daniil Medvedev is through to the second round after a straight sets victory over Swiss Henri Laaksonen on centre court.</p>
<p>The 1.98m tall Russian is the new tournament favourite after the removal of Novak Djokovic, who beat him in last year’s Australian Open final.</p>
<p>Medvedev said he would watch tonight’s match between our very own Nick Kyrgios and Brit Liam Broady, the winner of which he will play in the next round.</p>
<p>After dropping his opening service game, Medvedev was never seriously challenged again on serve during his 6-1, 6-4, 7-6(3) win.</p>
<header><div> <span>yesterday <time>4.38pm</time></span></div><h2>Johnson, Thompson enter fifth set</h2></header>
<p>Jordan Thompson and Steve Johnson are blasting away in the fifth set of their match which is tied at 1-1 with Thompson winning his service game to take a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>Johnson appears to be carrying a leg injury so is firing away with his forehand winners in a hope of blasting Thompson out.</p>

<p>Basilashvili showed why he is a seed with that performance and now Murray has to find a response.</p>
<p>On Rod Laver Arena, Daniil Medvedev is into a third-set tiebreaker with Henri Laaksonen after winning the first two sets.</p>

<p>Andy Murray and Nikoloz Basilashvilii are playing a fifth set on John Cain Arena after the Georgian power-hitter won the fourth-set tiebreak.</p>

<p>We would like to make clear from the outset that we respect the decision of the Immigration Minister and the finding of the Federal Court of Australia over the weekend.</p>
<p>Tennis Australia has been working closely with both the Federal and Victorian government for the past year to deliver a COVID safe Australian Open for the players, staff, and fans.</p>
<p>Embarking on a major international sporting event during a global pandemic that continues to evolve and challenge us all, is profoundly demanding for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>The board and Member Associations commend the Tennis Australia CEO and the entire Tennis Australia team for their hard work and dedication to delivering a spectacular summer of tennis.</p>
<p>As the Australian tennis family, we recognise that recent events have been a significant distraction for everyone, and we deeply regret the impact this had on all players.</p>
<p>There are always lessons to learn, and we will review all aspects of our preparation and implementation to inform our planning – as we do every year. That process always starts once the Australian Open champions have lifted their trophies.</p>
<p>Australia has a strong and proud tennis tradition, and it has been fantastic to see the crowds out cheering for the world’s best players in the lead up to and over the opening days of the Australian Open.</p>
<p>We, like the players, and all tennis fans here and around the world, are keen for the focus to now be on the game we are all so passionate about.</p>

<div>New tournament favourite Medvedev cruises into second round</div>
<p>World No. 2 Daniil Medvedev has said that winning last year’s US Open gave him a lot more confidence, and it was on display in his first round match at Melbourne Park on Tuesday as he cruised to a straight sets victory over Henri Laaksonen.</p>
<p>The tournament’s default top seed didn’t blink after dropping his opening service game, breaking back instantly and benefiting from his Swiss opponent’s unforced errors to take the first set 6-1.</p>
<p>A hard court fan, Medvedev said he felt the courts at Melbourne Park were playing “a little bit faster this year”. He also said he liked pressure - a good thing given the weight of expectation falling on him in this tournament.</p>
<p>In other men’s matches, 26th seed from Bulgaria Grigor Dimitrov needed four sets to dispatch with Czech Jiri Lehecka 6-4, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, after a rough service game from Dimitrov at 3-3 in the second allowed Lehecka to go up a break.</p>
<p>Thirteenth seed Diego Schwartzman of Argentina was victorious in three solid sets against Serbian Filip Krajinovic, while Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut won in four against Italian Stefano Travaglia.</p>
<p>And in a gruelling four-hour, five-setter between two Americans, 22nd seed John Isner overcame a resurgent Maxime Cressy 7-6, 7-5, 6-7, 6-7, 6-4 to advance to the second round.</p>

<div>Barty breezes through first round with clinical win over Tsurenko</div>
<p>Ashleigh Barty. World No.1. Reigning Wimbledon winner. Two-time grand slam champion. And, in an important departure point from the top men’s player, fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>Now perhaps even more importantly in an immediate sense than all of that, she is also a first round Australian Open winner. Not only that she won that first round in straight sets losing just one game and in less than an hour.</p>
<p>“I think I have been able to do that better the last few years of my career.</p>
<p>For the tournament favourite and loved local, she was remarkably able to avoid pre-Open attention because of the Djokovic imbroglio (you might have read something about that).</p>
<p>On opening night the focus turned as it ought, to the tennis court not the law court and to the number one who is here and not the one who is on a plane home.</p>
<p>Barty was world No.1 then but at 23 was still adjusting to life at the top. Now at 25 she is accustomed to it and is delivering the consistency of performance of the world’s best player.</p>
<p>At 32, Tsurenko might have wondered who she offended to twice cop the local favourite in the opening round.</p>
<p>This time Barty knew to be on her game from the opening and that, despite her opponent needing a qualifier to be here, history warned her there was no player to take lightly.</p>
<p>Barty closed her down in her first two service games to skip out to an early lead and take the opening set comfortably.</p>
<p>She was in full control while Tsurenko found it difficult to make any inroads on the Australian’s game.</p>
<p>Barty, despite being considerably shorter than most of her opponents, was punishing on serve, giving Tsurenko no look in.</p>
<p>Barty shut down the second set in the same clinically efficient way she began the first, winning the match 6-0 6-1.</p>
<p>Barty said she is looking forward to the inaugural First Nations Day celebration at the tennis on Wednesday, albeit she will be playing and not able to join in the celebration as she might like.</p>
<p>Barty now advances a step closer to the tantalising fourth round match-up with last year’s winner Naomi Osaka.</p>

<div>Frain, Plapp claim gold in national cycling championships</div>
<div><div><h5>By Sophie Smith</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 16, 2022 — 5.52pm</time></span><span>first published at <time>1.04pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Lucas Plapp soloed to victory in the Australian national road championships on Sunday in Buninyong, near Ballarat, and will wear the green and gold bands in his first full season with powerhouse team Ineos Grenadiers.</p>
<p>Plapp, who was a trainee with Ineos for the second half of last season, claimed the elite men’s event from James Whelan of Team BridgeLane, and Brendan Johnston in a shade over four hours and 52 minutes around the 185-kilometre course.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nicole Frain surprised the favourites and won gold in the elite women’s event with a solo attack in the closing kilometres of their title race.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old was part of a leading group of 12 riders that contested the pointy end of the 104.4-kilometre circuit race before she made her decisive move.</p>
<p>Frain finished four seconds ahead of Grace Brown (FDJ Nouvelle-Aquitaine - Futuroscope), who took silver, and Alyssa Polites (Sydney Uni Staminade), who claimed the bronze medal.</p>
<p>“I thought if I just get a little bit of a gap I’m just all in. It’s now or never because having Ruby [Roseman-Gannon] and that still there, I didn’t want them there, not for me, and then the gap opened,” Frain said.</p>
<p>The under-23 women’s race is held with the elite race. Polites claimed the under-23 title ahead of Neve Bradbury (Canyon-SRAM) and Emily Watts (Knights of Suburbia Racing), who finished 55 seconds adrift of Frain.</p>
<p>Frain is a latecomer to the sport and won gold in what was only her fourth appearance at the nationals. She considered whether to celebrate over the line as she powered toward it, unsure of the gap she had on the field behind.</p>
<p>“It probably wasn’t until it was about 50 to 100 metres to go that I thought, ‘Oh, this is real. Do I put my hands up? How do I do this?’” she said.</p>

<div>Coolangatta and Russian Conquest set to meet again in Slipper lead-up</div>
<p>Magic Millions Classic quinella Coolangatta and Russian Conquest are set to see a lot more of each other as both have Golden Slipper claims following their thrilling duel on the Gold Coast on Saturday.</p>
<p>There was only a long neck between them at the post and it might have just been the James McDonald ride on Coolangatta, going for home on the turn, that proved the difference.</p>
<p>“She is a very good filly, and she beat a pretty good one as well,” McDonald said. “She is right up with the better two-year-olds I have ridden this season and I look forward to seeing her back in Sydney.</p>
<p>“She really dug in for the fight there when the other filly came at me.”</p>
<p>Coolangatta will have a couple of weeks off and is likely to run in either the Sweet Embrace Stakes or Reisling Stakes as a Slipper lead-up.</p>
<p>“The Magic Millions was the first goal and then Slipper,” co-trainer Ciaron Maher said. “She is one of the best two-year-olds we have and I still think she can improve for the races in the autumn.</p>
<p>“She has been in Sydney for a long time and Jack Bruce knows her well, so we’ll see how she comes back and decide which is the best option for her heading into the Slipper.”</p>
<p>Co-trainer Paul Snowden believes Russian Conquest can turn the tables of the Magic Millions result back in Sydney.</p>
<p>“We will take her home and get her ready for the Reisling Stakes. The breaks went Coolangatta’s way on Saturday and that was difference, I can’t wait to have another crack at her,” Snowden said.</p>
