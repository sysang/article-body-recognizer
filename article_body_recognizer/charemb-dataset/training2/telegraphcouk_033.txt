<header> <h1> Soaring energy bills put Britons off paying higher taxes to save the planet </h1> <p> Poll finds more than 60 per cent refusing to pay more to fund Number 10’s net zero plans due to fears over rising cost of living </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor <time> 3 January 2022 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Sixty per cent of Britons say that they are not willing to pay higher taxes on their energy bills to help reach the Government’s net zero targets, according to a poll.</p>
<p>Some 70 per cent of Britons said they had worried about energy costs over the festive period, with more than 60 per cent saying they did not believe they would benefit from the Government’s green subsidies.</p>
<a>net zero policies</a>, according to the poll commissioned by campaign group Net Zero Watch.
<p>It comes as Boris Johnson was told that he must intervene to address <a>Britain’s cost of living crisis,</a> with 20 Tory MPs and peers calling on him to scrap taxes on energy bills.</p>
<h2>‘Public have not had their say’</h2>
<p>Five former ministers are among a group of backbenchers who are calling on Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, to step in amid fears that household energy bills could double to £2,000 by April.</p>
<p>“<a>The general public are quite obviously not onside</a>, and we need to be very careful about just whose shoulders are going to be carrying the very considerable costs of net zero.”</p>
<h2>Net zero a ‘greater political crisis than Poll Tax’</h2>
<a>a political crisis greater than the Poll Tax</a>, and these figures show that the Government is heading straight for such an eventuality.
<p>“The British people are clearly deeply unhappy about paying higher taxes to help reach net zero targets and feel they haven’t been consulted about the choices the Government are making.</p>
<p>“Grants for air pumps and <a>electric cars</a> are all very well, but how many people can actually afford to pay all the additional costs? Twenty per cent think they will actually benefit.”</p>
<header> <h1> Ministers raise £1.1bn from NatWest stake sale </h1> <p> Taxpayer stake in former Royal Bank of Scotland falls to just under 55pc after sale of a further 5pc holding </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lucy Burton, banking editor <time> 11 May 2021 • 10:45am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Taxpayers now own less than 55pc of NatWest after the Government sold a £1.1bn stake in the bailed-out bank. </p>
<p>The Treasury said on Tuesday that its placing of 580m shares, a 5pc stake, had been sold to institutional investors at 190p a share. The share sale cuts taxpayers' stake in the bank from 59.8pc to 54.8pc. </p>
<p>Shares in NatWest closed at 197.1p on Monday, 3.5pc higher than the sale price. </p>
<p>Taxpayers bought into the bank at 502p a share to rescue it during the 2008 financial crisis, but the Government later said it was “unrealistic” to expect taxpayers to make a profit from what was a "crisis situation".</p>
<p>The latest share sale comes after the Treasury sold £1.1bn of NatWest shares back to the bank in March in a move that crystalised a loss of about £1.8bn for taxpayers.</p>
<p>That was the first time the Government has sold shares in the bank since 2018 when it offloaded a 7.7pc stake.</p>
<p>The Treasury has said it does not expect to fully dispose of its shareholding in NatWest until 2026, meaning it could take nearly two decades for the lender to escape the shadow of the financial crisis.</p>
<p>The bank was rescued following years of disastrous mismanagement under disgraced banker Fred "the Shred" Goodwin and has been through a brutal restructuring ever since.</p>
<p>The lender changed its name to NatWest last year after almost 300 years as it tried to shake off the toxic legacy of RBS.</p>
<p>The Government offloaded its remaining stake in Lloyds Banking Group in 2017, almost a decade after its 2008 rescue.</p>

<p>Kwasi Kwarteng is to hold crisis talks with energy companies on Wednesday amid pressure to prevent a further string of corporate collapses, after wholesale gas costs jumped 25pc as cold weather set in across Europe.</p>
<p>The Business Secretary is scrambling to head off fresh chaos in the market following the failure of 26 suppliers last year.</p>
<p>Consumer energy bills are expected to rise 56pc or more in April when months of soaring wholesale costs hit households, fuelling a growing cost of living crisis. </p>
<p>The industry is pushing for measures ranging from removing the 5pc VAT charged on<a> energy bills</a> to setting up a £20bn loan fund so suppliers can spread wholesale costs over several years to lessen the impact on consumers.</p>
<p>Talks between Mr Kwarteng and major suppliers took place on Monday last week but no solution was reached. Greg Hands, the energy minister, also spoke with some smaller suppliers on Tuesday. </p>
<a> a wave of bankruptcies</a>. 
<p>Russia has been accused of using the crisis to put pressure on Germany to approve its new <a>Nord Stream 2 pipeline</a> under the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine. </p>
<p>Ofgem, the regulator, has already set out a plan for suppliers to raise third-party loans to pay for the burden of taking on customers from failed rivals - costs which are passed onto consumers. </p>
<p>Companies are also pushing for a broader private loan scheme which they can use for support.</p>
<p>The amount being claimed by suppliers for failures this year already runs to £1.8bn, while the Government has set aside nearly £1.7bn to run <a>Bulb in special administration</a> after it collapsed in November. </p>
<p>One source said: "There is an immediate issue of cash-flow here and if nothing happens bills will go up dramatically. Everyone is aware of that. </p>
<p>"A big hit all at once, or even over 12 months, is going to be unsustainable for a lot of people. There needs to be a financial mechanism to pay for this, which will ultimately be charged back to consumers. </p>
<p>City sources said pension funds may be able to invest in the loans if they are later securitised. Ofgem is running a consultation on the proposals for the costs of failed suppliers, closing on January 27.</p>
<header> <h1> ‘Painful’ £2,000 energy bills price cap coming for consumers </h1> <p> Rising gas prices and the costs linked to suppliers' collapses are expected to pile pressure on households </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matt Oliver <time> 21 December 2021 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Millions of households face a “painful” rise of up to £700 in their energy bills when the price cap is updated next spring, analysts have warned.</p>
<p>With gas prices expected to remain high after surging this winter, Investec estimates the average capped bill could rise from £1,277 per year to £2,000 when the limit is reviewed in April.</p>
<p>That represents an increase of 56pc or £723 – roughly £60 per month extra.</p>
<p>“Although well trailed, this will still come as a shock to many,” energy analyst Martin Young wrote.</p>
<p>Rising gas prices and the costs linked to the <a>failure of 25 suppliers this year</a>, which are spread across all consumers, account for the bulk of the increase.</p>
<p>Mr Young said £300 of the new total was made up of taxes or government levies, giving ministers some leeway to cushion the blow.</p>
<p>For example, they could set VAT on energy bills to zero – as has been called for by many MPs – or shift the cost of green energy levies to general taxation.</p>
<p>But he warned: “It will still be painful. Whichever way you look at it, this is not going to be pretty.”</p>
<p>It comes after experts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight last week predicted the price cap could rise to £1,800 per year, an increase of £523.</p>
<p>Whatever the change, the rise will pile further pressure on household finances at a time when families are already being hit by national insurance rises and surging inflation.</p>
<p>Some 15m homes in Britain are protected by the energy price cap, which limits how much suppliers can charge people who are not on fixed deals.</p>
<p>Ofgem, the industry regulator, currently reviews the limit every six months but is currently consulting on whether this could be shortened to three months or even less in emergencies.</p>
<p>However, the role of the cap has come under the spotlight in recent months after the collapse of a string of <a>energy suppliers</a>, including Bulb, the seventh biggest.</p>
<p>Some of the collapsed firms argued that the cap blocked them from raising prices to compensate for rocketing wholesale gas costs –forcing them to sell energy at a loss.</p>
<p>But the Government has dismissed this, saying firms should have bought energy far enough in advance to protect themselves from price swings.</p>
<p><a>Consumer watchdog Citizens Advice</a> accused Ofgem of a “catalogue of errors” earlier this month, in a report that claimed the regulator had failed to take action against “unfit” suppliers in poor financial health.</p>

<h1> France and Germany at odds over EU proposal to classify nuclear and gas energy as ‘green’ </h1>
<p> French Government keen to pursue policy that the German Economy Minister has called ‘greenwashing’ and ‘wrong’ </p>

<p>A proposal from the European Union to label nuclear and gas energy as “green” has come under heavy fire from the German Government.</p>
<p>The draft plan says that gas and nuclear energies are essential for the transition to cleaner power.</p>
<p>But Steffi Lemke, the German Environment Minister, said the proposal was “absolutely wrong”, while her Austrian counterpart Leonore Gewessler said Vienna would sue the bloc if it passed.</p>
<p>The stance puts the countries on a collision course with France, which generates 70 per cent of its energy from nuclear power and is leading the charge for it to be classified as sustainable.</p>
<p>President Emmanuel Macron recently announced a <a>billion-euro investment</a> in <a>nuclear energy expansion</a>.</p>
<p>Under the European Commission’s proposal, investments in new nuclear energy facilities should be classified as “green” if they meet certain technical standards including a specific plan for the disposal of radioactive waste.</p>
<p>The plan would include nuclear and gas energy projects in the EU’s “sustainable finance taxonomy” scheme, encouraging billions in private investment to help prevent climate change.</p>
<p>Robert Habeck, Germany’s Economy Minister, said the proposals smacked of “greenwashing” and questioned whether they would “even be accepted by financial markets”.</p>
<p>“Labelling nuclear energy as sustainable is wrong – this (is a) high-risk technology,” he said.</p>
<p>Bloss said the sustainability label was now “fraudulent” and that it was “absurd” nuclear and gas “are put on the same level as solar and wind power with this proposal”.</p>
<p>While Luxembourg has joined Germany and Austria in opposition, several other EU member states including Finland and the Czech Republic as well as France have called for greater use of the technology.</p>
<p>The proposal will become law in 2023 if it is backed by a majority of EU members.</p>
<header> <h1> Ghosts of Weimar haunt Germany as tabloids attack EU bankers over soaring inflation </h1> <p> Newspapers are only voicing a deep-rooted obsession with inflation that dates back 100 years in Europe's biggest economy </p> </header>

<p>Britain’s central bankers rarely find themselves the targets of a tabloid ‘monstering’ but in Germany, it is open season. </p>
<p>Isabel Schnabel, the nation’s most senior economist and a member of the European Central Bank’s governing council, was the latest victim this week as the pages of Germany’s Bild screamed: “Arrogance attack!” </p>
<p>In November his successor Christine Lagarde got the same treatment, being branded “Ms Chanel”, and “Luxury Lagarde making savers and pensioners poorer” while spending thousands on designer jackets. </p>
<a> voicing a deep-rooted obsession with inflation</a> that dates back 100 years to the Weimar Republic and post-war hyper-inflation, which wreaked most havoc on the asset-owning middle classes devastated by soaring prices.
<p>The disaster unleashed by a weak Government <a>turning to the money printing</a> to fund World War One war reparations has lodged a “race memory” of inflation wariness, according to Frederick Taylor, author of The Downfall of Money.</p>
<p>“These are the sorts of people who go to universities, who get doctorates, and who write for newspapers,” Taylor says. </p>
<a>The attacks on the ECB for slamming German savers are in a similar vein</a> to the tone of the Eurozone crisis a decade ago, the author adds - the attitude that “we are supporting all these dodgy unstable countries with our money”. 
<p>If the current spike “had happened under the reign of the Bundesbank, with its long tradition of being better than almost all other central banks, it would have been easier for them to get away with it, than the comparatively new ECB. </p>
