<h1> Confessions of a rugby journeyman: Gloating rivals, money worries – and still loving the game </h1>
<p> Richard de Carpentier, former England Sevens forward, has battled redundancy and a string of job rejections before feeling valued with Bath </p>
<div> <div> By Kate Rowan <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:00am </time> </div> </div>
<a>with changes in the boardroom</a>.
<p>De Carpentier would be forgiven for wanting to keep a low profile while the storm rages but after a torrid two years where his career was hanging in the balance, he at least has some perspective.</p>
<a>as part of the National Lottery-funded GB Sevens programme</a>. The dream was to go to the Tokyo Olympics and finally win a medal: as it was, he was overlooked and found himself without a club and fearing for the future.
<p>Acting as his own agent, he spent weeks ringing around clubs asking for trials - to no avail.</p>
<p>After a string of rejections, De Carpentier was close to despair when he picked up the phone to Bath director of rugby Stuart Hooper.</p>
<p>"He was very honest with me," he says. "I said to him I know what the perception is. As I didn’t have an agent, I was doing it all myself. He said he would give me a month’s trial and I would be paid for it. That was amazing.”</p>
<p>To speak to De Carpentier is to understand the gnawing uncertainty and fear that swirls around the life of the journeyman rugby player, and particularly one whose career was primarily forged in sevens.</p>
<p>"All the hard work I had put into my rugby career to get onto the property ladder to be booted off it because I was made redundant. We were only able to buy on the Isle of Wight because of that family support.”</p>
<p>At the time, De Carpentier was so shocked he could barely move when he was told the news: he simply sank on to a wall at the Great British base in Loughborough. Even now, the emotion of the memory is enough to make his voice crack.</p>
<p>“I have to constantly remind myself not to be really negative and bitter about it," he says. "Especially when I see some lads who went ahead of me... I think they are good rugby players but I think I would have brought something different.</p>
<p><a>“In the Games, in matches against Fiji, New Zealand and Argentina</a>, they were dominated physically, getting smashed in breakdowns. I know that I am a heavy lump and I am good at not getting cleared out."</p>
<p>Consolation came in two forms - some kind words from Simon Amor, his old coach - "he told me: 'Looks like they could have done with you out there'" - and being able to spend the summer with Rudi.</p>
<p>Prioritising family is non-negotiable for De Carpentier, but the lifeline offered by Bath - and the tight Covid protocols that surround Premiership clubs - has not made that straightforward.</p>
<p>De Carpentier is not seeking sympathy and neither do Bath's current struggles leave him disconsolate. </p>
<p>“I say don’t give up. I have been told over my career by a couple of coaches that I am not good enough. If you want to do something you can do it if you kick on and try your best.”</p>

<h2> Playing the Six Nations in England is price worth paying to get fans in stadiums </h2>
<p> Tournament needs crowds to create its unique flavour and all avenues must be explored in these unusual times </p>
<h2> <a> Bath can recover but it will take time - and a reset in attitude from the players </a> </h2>

<h2> England will have tougher Tests - but Tonga win was far cry from Six Nations kick-fest </h2>

<h2> <a> England must tap into new attacking intent in autumn of adventure </a> </h2>
<p> With New Zealand, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and Japan in Europe over next five weeks, the lie of the land will become clearer </p>
<h2> Combinations are crucial in picking a Test team... so this is my England starting XV for the autumn </h2>
<p> Great Test teams are settled - the side Eddie Jones picks for Tonga should play against Australia and South Africa as well </p>
<h2> <a> A women's Lions tour would be an incredible shot in the arm - but it can't all be about England </a> </h2>
