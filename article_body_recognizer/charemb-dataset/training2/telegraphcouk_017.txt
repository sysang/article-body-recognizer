<header> <h1> The best wake-up light alarm clocks, tested </h1> <p> These sunrise alarm clocks offer a gentler and more natural way to wake up </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:13am </time> </div> </div>
<a>overcoming seasonal depression</a>. 
<a>cortisol</a> and can potentially lead to bad mood and inertia. 
<a>Good sleep</a> is key to overall wellbeing, so along with other non-negotiables such as finding the
<a>duvet cover</a> for you, an alarm clock that wakes you up gently and helps you start the day feeling well-rested is a small change to your sleep routine that can have a big impact.
<a>Light therapy</a> has long been used to treat
<a>SAD,</a> and these days a wake up light alarm clock means you can access the treatment at home. 
<p>There are many on the market, ranging from around £20 to £200. They all perform the function of waking you with light rather than startling sounds, but the more expensive have features like <a>DAB radios</a> and reading lights. </p>
<p>I tested the best wake up light alarm clocks on the market. Here are my favourites... </p>
<h2>The best wake up light alarm clocks</h2>
<h2>1. Lumie Bodyclock Shine 300</h2>
<p><a>£109.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Lumie Bodyclock Shine 300 is a more basic version of the Luxe Lumie alarm clock. While it doesn't have many of the snazzier features of the more advanced version, it's a lot cheaper. Aesthetically, it's very similar. </p>
<p>Like its definitively luxe counterpart, it is also proven to treat SAD.</p>
<h2>2. Lumie Bodyclock Luxe 750D</h2>
<p><a>£199.99, John Lewis</a></p>
<p>Definitely a market leader, the Lumie Bodyclock Luxe 750D is a cut above its competition. Despite its high-tech features, it's incredibly easy to use for even the most technophobic. </p>
<p>While some SAD alarm clocks are fiddly and complex to set up, the Bodyclock Luxe comes almost ready to go - all you have to do is set the time. It was even pre-set to wake me at my usual time of 7am. </p>
<p>With 20 wake up sounds, you'll find the right one for you - I even awoke happily without any sound, just light (almost) as nature intended it. It's pricey, but if you can afford it, this is the best wake up light I tried. </p>
<h2>3. ALFALED Sunrise Alarm Clock</h2>
<p>A fairly basic light alarm clock, but it works well enough. It has a battery-powered option, though with limited functionality. </p>
<p>It took me a while to set up, and was a little fiddly. But the SAD alarm aspect worked well. Of all the calming nature sounds available - cows, sheep, water - I opt for comforting farm animals, a wistful longing for a rural life perhaps. </p>
<p>Like other sunrise alarm clocks, the light starts to turn on 30 minutes before alarm time, but this lamp probably wouldn't suffice as a bedside lamp. </p>
<p>Overall, it's not bad, the does-what-it-says-on-the-tin option. You'll miss out on the jazzier aspects of some others, but it's perfectly good nonetheless.</p>
<h2>4. Beurer WL 90 4-in-1 wake up light</h2>
<p><a>£99.99. Amazon</a></p>
<a>SAD </a>wake-up light, it does the trick, and can be used as an ambient mood lamp too. With 256 different lighting options, you will definitely find the right one for you. 
<p>You can stream music or play via Bluetooth and there are 10 wake-up melodies. Aesthetically, it may divide opinion, and it's on the expensive side. But the Beurer light alarm clock ticks all the important boxes. </p>
<h2>5. Philips wake-up light HF3531/01</h2>
<p><a>£149.99, Philips</a></p>
<a>old Apple Mac</a>. Just like the sun, Philips' wake-up light begins red, and within half an hour - to your desired wake-up time - turns bright yellow. It'll leave you feeling positively nourished during the bleak winter months. 
<p>There are only five wake-up sounds, so less choice than some of the best SAD alarms. But the piano sounds are pleasant, and Philips state they've put a lot of clinical research into it.</p>
<p>With so many options out there, it can be tough to find the right SAD alarm clock. Prices vary drastically, but even the cheaper options will wake you with a soothing light. </p>
<p>For affordability, we particularly enjoyed the <a>Alfaled</a>, which doubles up as a very good reading light and has a big, accessible button for changing light strength and colour (even rotating between settings, if you prefer). </p>
<a>Bodyclock Luxe 750D</a> from light therapy specialists Lumie. Not only does it look smart, it's incredibly easy to use - even arriving with a 7am alarm time - and has extra features like a DAB radio. 
<h2>Why buy an SAD alarm clock?</h2>
<p>To recap, they're clinically proven to help treat SAD and they make waking up more manageable. Many can provide soothing lighting and sound functions and some have a 'sunset' setting, which can help you nod off to a better night's sleep.</p>

<header> <h1> The best electric toothbrushes for clean teeth and healthy gums – tried and tested </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Abigail Buchanan <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:13am </time> </div> </div>
<p>It may not be the most exciting of purchases, but an electric toothbrush that cleans properly and thoroughly could make a tangible difference to your general health. </p>
<p>That’s no exaggeration: research published in 2016 found that good dental hygiene could slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s, and that gum disease can speed up mental decline. </p>
<a>adaptor</a> before buying. 
<h2>How I tested the best electric toothbrushes</h2>
<h3>The best electric toothbrushes for 2022</h3>
<h3>1. Spotlight Oral Care Sonic electric toothbrush</h3>
<p><a>£110, LookFantastic</a></p>
<p>Why we like it: It checks off style, performance and value for money in one</p>
<p>I expected a lot from this brand, which was founded by two cosmetic dentists, and the Spotlight Oral Care Sonic Toothbrush more than delivered. </p>
<div> <div> <h3>2. Philips Sonicare 9900 Prestige electric toothbrush</h3> <p>£299.99, Amazon</p> <p>Why we like it: Quite simply the most impressive electric toothbrush on the market (just expect to pay for it)</p> </div> </div>
<p>Like most premium electric toothbrushes, it’s based on sonic technology, and the bristles move up to 62,000 times as you clean. The AI-based Philips Sonicare app then gives real-time feedback and personalised recommendations. </p>
<div> <div> <h3>3. Oral-B iO Series 9 Ultimate Clean electric toothbrush</h3> <p>£249.99, Amazon</p> <p>Why we like it: The best for smart technology</p> </div> </div>
<p>It comes with a travel case and magnetic charger, with a three hour quick charge time. The battery life is perfectly decent, but not as impressive as the Spotlight Oral Care brush in the top spot. </p>
<div> <div> <h3>4. Ordo Sonic+ electric toothbrush </h3> <p>£49.99, Boots</p> <p>Why we like it: Excellent value for money</p> </div> </div>
<p>This is a stylish-looking sonic toothbrush that gives models four times the price a run for their money. </p>
<a>£59.99</a>). It comes with mouthwash and a reusable mouthwash bottle, interdental brushes, Ordo toothpaste and the Sonic+ toothbrush itself.
<div> <div> <h3>5. Oral-B Pro 2 2500 CrossAction electric toothbrush</h3> <p><a>£35.40, Amazon</a></p> <p>Why we like it: The best value for money</p> </div> </div>
<p>It offers two cleaning modes (Daily Clean and Sensitive) which you click a simple button on the front of the toothbrush to switch between. The rubberised handle is comfortable to hold, and it comes with a travel case. </p>
<div> <div> <h3>6. Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean electric toothbrush</h3> <p>£88.98, Amazon</p> <p>Why we like it: Gentle on sensitive gums</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h3>7. Colgate ProClinical 250R electric toothbrush</h3> <p>£50, Amazon</p> <p>Why we like it: A reliable, affordable electric toothbrush from a dentist-approved brand</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h3>8. FOREO ISSA 2 Electric Toothbrush</h3> <p>£149, FeelUnique </p> <p>Why we like it: A unique silicone design</p> </div> </div>
<p>The brush is powered by sonic pulse technology that cleans at a maximum of 11,000 pulsations per minute. The head is made of silicone and PBT polymer bristles, which gives it a very different feel to other toothbrushes. </p>
<h5>Frequently asked questions about electric toothbrushes</h5>
<h3>Do I need an electric toothbrush?</h3>
<p>The evidence, and the expert advice, says yes. The Telegraph caught up with dentist Dr Toby Edwards-Lunn, who helped pen a detailed guide on how best to brush teeth, and he was unequivocal on the benefits of going electric.</p>
<p>"This day and age the technology is so good, you don't need to put any elbow grease into it. The brush does it for us", said <a>Dr Edwards-Lunn</a>. "From the age of six to 96, all my patients are aided by using an electric toothbrush." </p>
<p>Simply switching to an electric toothbrush cannot guarantee healthy teeth. A good toothpaste, brushing technique, brushing at the right time and flossing are all crucial too. But an electric toothbrush is certainly a good start. </p>
<h3>Will electric toothbrushes help with gum disease?</h3>
<p>And with more than half of patients the dentist sees having a high plaque score – even those who brush twice a day –moving to an electric option will certainly help. </p>
<h3>Will electric toothbrushes help with receding gums?</h3>
<p>"Because an electric toothbrush does the work for you, and will hopefully tell you when you're pushing too hard, it can help protect against further recession." </p>
<h3>Will electric toothbrushes whiten my teeth? </h3>
<h3>Can electric toothbrushes damage my teeth?</h3>
<p>The same goes for breakfast, where acidic things like fruit can soften the outer surface, and immediate brushing would be harmful. As for scratching the teeth, as long as you don't push too hard, you should be all right. </p>
<header> <h1> The best heated clothes airers for drying laundry in the winter </h1> <p> Tried and tested: the space-saving alternative to tumble dryers and clothes lines, which is said to extend the life of your clothes </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Madeleine Howell <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:14am </time> </div> </div>
<p>As far as domestic gadgetry goes, a heated clothes airer may not sound like the most exciting of purchases. But as a means of drying your clothes in winter, it’s hard to beat.</p>
<a>£12 for 500ml</a> – but
<a>Pure Cashmere Wash, £7 for 250ml from Pure Collection</a>, is also very good.)
<a>the best steam irons</a>). 
<p> Here's my pick of the best heated clothes airers on the market...</p>
<h2>1. Lakeland Dry:Soon Deluxe 3-Tier heated airer and cover</h2>
<p><a>£199.98, Lakeland</a></p>
<p>Why we like it: the addition of a ventilated cover speeds up the drying process</p>
<a>bras</a> and Sally Hughes of laundry experts Kair recommends it to make
<p>Personally, I favour the larger version – if you’re using it anyway, you might as well dry two loads at once and then put it away until next time. Both come with Lakeland's standard three-year guarantee.</p>
<h2>2. Argos Home indoor heated electric clothes airer</h2>
<p>Why we like it: The most compact of the lot; easily hidden away in between use.</p>
<p>This winged design works well for hanging shirts and for laying a few things flat, but doesn’t carry as many items as either the Lakeland or the Dunelm. It's one for a single person or a couple rather than a family.</p>
<p>And because it opens flat and horizontal (it measures 93x84x54cm), it may not work so well in the space you have. Plus, I found it isn’t tall enough for some of the dresses and longer items I own.</p>
<p>It comes with a one year manufacturer’s guarantee, but you can also purchase Argos Replacement Care (£14.49), which lasts for three years, and you can get same day delivery.</p>
<p>Don’t send your children off to university without one.</p>
<h2>3. Black and Decker 3-tier heated airer</h2>
<p><a>£102.99, Robert Dyas</a></p>
<p>Apparently, it holds up to 15kg of washing on 21m of drying space. It’s also incredibly sturdy. As with all of these airers, it arrives assembled - so all you need to do is simply fold it out, plug it in and switch it on. Ta da!</p>
<h2>4. Minky winged 12m heated clothes airer with cover</h2>
<a>£2.48, Asda</a>)? But did you know that Sophie Hinch’s favourite washcloth brand also does a heated clothes airer, available from Argos? 
<p>The Minky Wing offers 12m of drying space, and holds up to 10kg of laundry (one generous wash load, pretty much). It has a one year-guarantee. </p>
<p>Personally, I’m not so keen on wing-shaped heated airers as I think they take up an unnecessary amount of space when folded out, but it depends what you’re drying. </p>
<p>I’ll concede it’s quite good if you’re drying wool jumpers flat and then dangling socks and shorts from the “wings”. </p>
<h2>5. Aldi Easy Home heated airer</h2>
<p><a>£39.99, Aldi</a></p>
<p>Oh, Aldi, how we love your special buys. Not only is Aldi’s cheese and wine section improving all the time, but so is its budget homeware offering.</p>
<p>This winged heated clothes airer has earned a spot on our list purely because it represents such utterly undeniable good value for money, with a three-year warranty and twenty heated bars for the efficient drying of damp washing.</p>

<header> <h1> The best pillows for a luxurious night’s sleep </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Abigail Buchanan and Jack Rear <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:16am </time> </div> </div>
<p>We’ve worked our way through a constant rotation of new pillows to find the best of the bunch, sampling traditional favourites and hi-tech new products in a quest for the perfect night’s sleep. </p>
<p>The first thing we learned is that material is an important factor in the pillow you choose. Broadly speaking, there are four types that you need to know about:</p>
<p>Without further ado, here's our pick of the best pillows...</p>
<p>(Product reviews by Abigail Buchanan)</p>
<h2>How I tested the best pillows </h2>
<h2>The best pillows for 2022</h2>
<h2>1. Simba Hybrid pillow</h2>
<p>Why we like it: The ultimate fusion of tech and tradition</p>
<p>I knew I liked this pillow the first night I slept on it. I knew I loved this pillow when I felt disappointed every night I had to rotate it out to test the other pillows on this list.</p>
<p>The only downside is the cost – the Simba Hybrid is a significant outlay. However, I feel confident in saying that it is worth every penny.</p>
<div> <div> <h2>2. The White Company luxury Hungarian goose down pillow</h2> <p>£80, The White Company</p> <p>Why we like it: The last word in luxury</p> </div> </div>
<p>Though it’s by no means the cheapest pillow you can buy, I would be confident in saying the quality makes it good value for money.</p>
<div> <div> <h2>3. Panda London memory foam bamboo pillow</h2> <p>Was £44.95, now £40.46, Panda London</p> <p>Why we like it: A memory foam pillow as it should be</p> </div> </div>
<p>If you have sensitive skin, this could be the pillow for you, as it is OEKO-TEX certified free from irritants and chemicals, and the soft, smooth bamboo cover is naturally antimicrobial. </p>
<div> <div> <h2>4. Scooms Hungarian goose down pillow</h2> <p>£75, Scooms</p> <p>Why we like it: A perfectly plush down pillow with an anti-allergy finish</p> </div> </div>
<p>Unlike other down and feather pillows, which tend to flatten out after a few nights’ sleep, this one required zero plumping. </p>
<div> <div> <h2>5. Beaumont Brown Savoy duck down pillow </h2> <p>£69, Beaumont Brown</p> <p>Why we like it: The very best duck down pillow </p> </div> </div>
<p>This boutique bedding business began by selling to luxury hotels before opening sales directly to consumers. While the most premium pillows traditionally use goose down, I was a huge fan of this squashy and supportive duck down pillow. </p>
<div> <div> <h2>6. Kally Sleep cooling pillow</h2> <p>£29.99, Kally Sleep</p> <p>Why we like it: Premium tech for great value</p> </div> </div>
<p>The hollow fibre and foam inner is excellent at regulating temperature. Having slept on this pillow over the course of several scorching summer nights, I found that I wasn’t tossing and turning in search of the cool side. </p>
<p>The filling is sealed into the pillow. On one hand, this means the cover has to be hand washed instead of thrown in the washing machine, but on the upside, there are no zips sticking out as with some of the other pillows I tested. </p>
<div> <div> <h2>7. Loaf Perfect Kip pillow</h2> <p>£80 for 2, Loaf</p> <p>Why we like it: An excellent all-rounder</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <h2>8. DUSK duck feather and down pillow</h2> <p>£37.60 for 2, DUSK</p> <p>Why we like it: A reliably comfortable pillow at a great price</p> </div> </div>
<h2>9. Brook + Wilde Everdene cooling pillow</h2>

<header> <h1> The best lawnmowers and everything you need to know before you buy </h1> <p> There isn't a 'one size fits all' when it comes to lawnmowers. Here's our pick of the best on the market, plus buying dos and don'ts </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Abigail Buchanan <time> 20 July 2021 • 8:53am </time> </div> </div>
<a>the Lawn Association</a> and author of Modern Lawn Care: The Complete Guide to a Happy and Healthy Lawn. “Lawn mowing is pruning under a different name.” 
<h3>The main types of lawnmower</h3>
<p>Before you start your search, it's important to note the two main types of mowers: (1) Rotary lawnmower (2) Cylinder lawnmower. </p>
<p>Still have questions? We've added FAQ below for a checklist of what to consider when shopping for a lawnmower, from petrol vs electric to type of lawn finish. </p>
<h3>The best lawnmowers to buy now</h3>
<h4>The best petrol lawnmowers</h4>
<h3>1. Honda HRG416SK IZY Self-Propelled Petrol Lawnmower</h3>
<p><a>£418, Lawnmowers Direct</a></p>
<a>£332, Amazon</a>), which offers the same 41cm cutting deck and efficient mowing power at a slightly lower price.
<h3>2. Cobra MX534SPH Self-Propelled 4-Speed Petrol Lawn Mower</h3>
<p><a>£425.99, Just Lawnmowers</a></p>
<h4>The best cordless lawnmowers</h4>
<h3>3. EGO Power LM2135E-SP 52cm Cordless Self-Propelled 7.5Ah 56v Mower</h3>
<p><a>£849, Ego Power Plus</a></p>
<h3>4. Stihl RMA 339 C Cordless Lawn Mower</h3>
<p><a>£429, Lawnmowers Direct</a></p>
<h3>5. Bosch CityMower 18 18V Cordless Lawn Mower</h3>
<p><a>£229, Just Lawnmowers</a></p>
<h4>The best lawnmower for small gardens</h4>
<h3>6. Bosch Rotak 32R Electric Lawnmower</h3>
<p><a>£83.95, Amazon</a></p>
<h4>The best robot lawnmower</h4>
<h3>7. Husqvarna Automower 105</h3>
<p><a>£799, Husqvarna</a></p>
<h4>The best budget lawnmower</h4>
<h3>8. GARDENA Comfort reel mower 400 C</h3>
<p><a>£135.95, Amazon</a></p>
<h3>FAQ: Your lawnmower checklist</h3>
<li>Corded electric mowers are cheaper and lighter, but the cable can be inconvenient and poses a health and safety risk if it were to get snagged or caught.</li>
<h3>Blades and cutting deck</h3>
<h3>Robot lawnmowers </h3>
<p>Robotic lawnmowers are a boon for time-poor or less mobile gardeners as they’re fully automatic. While some lawnmowing purists aren’t so keen, Garner says the technology in robot mowers has come on leaps and bounds.</p>
<h3>Other factors to consider</h3>
<li>Noise: For obvious reasons, petrol lawnmowers are far noisier than their electric or manually-powered counterparts.</li>
<li>Handlebars and manoeuvrability: Folded handlebars will make your lawnmower much easier to store. Some lawnmower handlebars are ergonomic and/or height adjustable, which can make them more comfortable to use.</li>
<header> <h1> A flowering hedge, fantastic moths and a tip for sticky secateurs </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Helen Yemm <time> 18 January 2019 • 4:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<h3>A FLOWERING (mostly) EVERGREEN (largely) HEDGE</h3>
<p>Anne Hawkins – via email</p>
<p>My recommended components for a flowering mixed hedge consisted of mostly evergreen flowering shrubs, providing berries and cover for birds, as well as forming an informal “backdrop” in a smallish garden.</p>
<p>While in a small garden, this could be seen as satisfying and therapeutic garden “faffery”, for a long hedge like yours it could be viewed as unacceptably high maintenance.</p>
<p>Bill Halkett – via email</p>
<p>Secateurs usually jam because of a build-up of dried sap and general garden grot on the blades. A good clean, followed by a wipe with an oily rag, sorts the problem out. Presumably you have tried that.</p>
<a>Gardena </a>still make some that are similar. Maybe it is time for you to acquire a “spare”.

<header> <h1> The best hedge trimmers for easy garden maintenance </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 26 February 2021 • 4:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<a>lawnmower</a> for maintaining your garden, used for cutting, pruning and shaping both hedges and stand-alone bushes. 
<a>cordless vacuums</a>, cordless hedge trimmers and the new generation of extremely lightweight hedge trimmers make it easier than ever to blitz even the most jungle-like of green spaces in a short amount of time.
<h4>What should I look for when buying a hedge trimmer? </h4>
<p>If you'll be maintaining tall, large hedges, you'll need a long-reach hedge trimmer with a telescopic shaft. Beyond that, other considerations (cordless versus corded, weight, special features) are largely a matter of personal choice.</p>
<h4>What is the most powerful electric hedge trimmer? </h4>
<p>Blade length, material, and tooth gap are arguably more important for handling thick branches and larger hedges.</p>
<ul><li>See also: Telegraph Recommended’s review of <a>the best secateurs on the market</a></li></ul>
<h4>How thick a branch can a hedge trimmer cut?</h4>
<p>Most experts believe you shouldn't try to tackle branches thicker than 33mm, at risk of damaging the blade.</p>
<p>Here is our pick of the best hedge trimmers, selected by The Telegraph:</p>
<h3>1. Flymo Sabre Cut cordless hedge trimmer</h3>
<p><a>£140.11, Amazon</a></p>
<p>If you're a fan of Flymo, you might also want to check out the Flymo EasiCut (<a>£60.95, Amazon</a>), which makes even lighter work of trimming.</p>
<div> <div> <p><a>Buy now</a></p> <h3>2. Ryobi cordless extended reach hedge trimmer</h3> <p><a>£85.26, Amazon</a></p> </div> </div>
<h3>3. Makita electric hedge trimmer</h3>
<p><a>£136, Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Makita is a powerful, heavy duty tool for serious gardeners and landscapers. It's an extra long reach trimmer thanks to the handle system, and you can adopt four different safe hand positions for easy cutting in any position. </p>
<h3>4. Husqvarna petrol hedge trimmer</h3>
<p><a>£264.99, Amazon</a></p>
<h3>5. Greenworks cordless hedge trimmer</h3>

<p>The double reciprocating blades make this lightweight petrol hedge trimmer by Mountfield the best choice for making light work of thick hedges.</p>

<header> <h1> The best chef's knives for impressive results </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:26am </time> </div> </div>
<a>slow cookers</a>, possibly the most ancient device of all, the knife, remains. 
<a>they inspire an almost cult-like following</a>. 
<p>As Hayward writes: "The day you go out and intentionally drop £50 or more on a knife is the day you declare to the world that you're not just someone who makes dinner, you're now a cook."</p>
<p>Here is our pick of the best chef's knives available to buy, including both Western and Japanese styles. </p>
<h3>1. Wüsthof classic cook's knife, 20cm</h3>
<p>Why we like it: It's the best all-rounder; a real workhorse </p>
<div> <div> <p><a>£89, Amazon</a></p> </div> </div>
<p>Wüsthof have been making knives in Solingen, the "City of Blades", since 1814, and their precisely made blades have received plaudits from the likes of Tim Hayward.</p>
<p>Overall, a quality knife that I felt encouraged me to hold it in the correct manner, due to the positioning and smoothness of the bolster and heel, and allowed me to chop, slice, cut and dice my way to a more enjoyable kitchen experience. </p>
<h3>2. Kai Shun classic scalloped santoku knife, 18cm</h3>
<p>Why we like it: Beautiful look and very fine slicing </p>
<p><a>£131.25, Russums</a></p>
<p>The lightness means you can get through quite a lot without tiring the wrists or arms out. However, I didn't find cutting in a rocking motion, a method I often use for herbs, to be as effortless as with the Wüsthof. </p>
<h3>3. Mercer Culinary Genesis 10-inch chef's knife </h3>
<p>Why we like it: A good value knife</p>
<p><a>£79.56, Restaurant Store</a></p>
<p>Mercer claim to supply over 90pc of North American culinary academies with kitchen gadgets, so one would expect their knives to be sturdy, durable, sharp and comfortable – ideal, then, for the budding chef. </p>
<p>If you're looking for a chef's knife under £100, however, I'd suggest the Mercer Genesis. </p>
<h3>4. TOG Knives santoku knife, 17cm</h3>
<p><a>£210, Tog Knives </a></p>
<p>First thing to say is that, upon opening the box, you'll be met with a stunning product. The dark maple handle, etched with traditional patterns, is a sight to behold. It's comfortable to grip, and very well balanced in the hand. </p>
<p>But, most importantly, the knife cuts well. It's got a razor-sharp, all-purpose blade that is equally as useful with meat as with fruit and veg. Chiffonading herbs is easy as can be. </p>
<h3>5. F. Dick 1905 fully forged chef's knife, 21.5cm</h3>
<p><a>£114.99, Nisbets </a></p>
