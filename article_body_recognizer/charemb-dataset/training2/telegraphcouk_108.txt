<p>The ’Tweeners show up at church and local council meetings, and are generous hosts: the only downside is that they hoard all the gardeners, housekeepers and grooms. </p>
<p>The male species can be spotted by the quality of his (not cashmere) sweater. It is neither moth-eaten (meaning he’s no aristo) nor neatly pressed (Chelsea). It’s wrinkled enough to suggest a “sporty” attitude. </p>
<p>Large swathes of these valleys are inhabited by ’Tweeners, but behind their backs they’re pejoratively called “London folk”. This is because, when Covid restrictions relax, many vanish to the capital, in quest of Deliveroo.</p>

<header> <h1> The foods with the highest carbon footprint – and what to eat instead to be more eco-friendly </h1> <p> Reducing the meat and dairy in your diet can help reduce your carbon footprint, so here's where to start </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 9 November 2021 • 9:51am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Doing the weekly shop can be a complex issue. Not only must one weigh up the cost of things, and whether or not they’re good for our health, but more than ever we are compelled to consider the environmental impact of our purchases. </p>
<p>The Government denied the paper represented policy, and insisted it was simply academic research. Nevertheless, after the introduction of a sugar tax in 2018, it would not be a surprise if a tax on high-carbon food and drink was in the pipeline.</p>
<a>climate change as a threat</a>, food and drink is seen as an area where we can really make a difference. 
<h2>What foods to swap to recude your carbon footprint</h2>
<p>The most comprehensive meta-analysis on the topic to date, by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek and published in the journal Science in 2018, studied almost 40,000 farms in 119 countries. </p>
<p>Axing meat and dairy from your diet, the Poore and Nemecek study claims, can reduce an individual’s carbon footprint by two thirds. </p>
<li>Minced beef: beans instead of mince in a chilli con carne or lentils in a cottage pie are good options – nuts, beans and tofu are the lowest carbon offenders when it comes to high-protein foods. </li>
<a>Vegan cheeses</a> perform better, though the environmental impact of soy and nuts is far from insignificant – and the flavour leaves a lot to be desired. The best option, perhaps, is to just eat less. 
<a>Chocolarder</a> in Cornwall has sail-shipped chocolate;
<a>Willie’s Cacao </a>is another good option.
<a>carbon-neutral milk</a>. 
<h2>Is shopping locally the answer?</h2>
<p>Only highly perishable fruit and vegetables, such as asparagus or berries, tend to travel by plane, and are best avoided. A general rule is to swerve perishable foods that have travelled a long distance. </p>

<header> <h1> The pleasure pandemic: How lockdown helped our sex lives </h1> <p> The founders of a sexual wellness app had a hotline to the pandemic bedroom, here's what they learnt about lockdown and libido </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lisa Williams <time> 29 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>So while we were being told to stay home and protect the NHS, could we have saved our sex lives in the process?</p>
<a>a predictable slump in sexual satisfaction</a> for single people and those not living with a partner, while most of those lucky enough to be locked down with their other halves didn’t report a change. That doesn’t mean it was easy, though.
<p>“For some couples there was too much closeness,” says Anna Hushlak who, as the co-founder of sexual wellness app Ferly, had a hotline to the pandemic bedroom.</p>
<p>“Too much closeness has a massive impact on our desire. It's really hard to... feel that sense of desire when you're operating like a single entity. There's actually nothing left to connect with because you become one and the same.”</p>
<p>“All the distractions were gone... so we were confronted with what's missing from our life,” explains Billie Quinlan, a former marketing executive who set up Ferly with PHD researcher Hushlak in 2019. </p>
<p>Pictured: Anna Hushlak and Billie Quinlan</p>
<p>Many are recently separated and looking forward to their next chapter in their lives or finally feeling old and confident enough to cast off any taboos of their upbringing.</p>
<p>While sexual freedom isn’t a zero sum game – women improving their own body confidence and awareness doesn’t mean the opposite has to happen to men – Quinlan acknowledges that it might seem like that sometimes.</p>
<p>“I think generally, as a society, we just need to be so much more empathetic to each other,” she says.</p>
<p>But things are looking hopeful. 12 per cent of Ferly users are men who want to learn more about that perennial question – what do women want?</p>
<p>Hopefully they’re finding their answers.</p>

<h1> Davina McCall: Menopausal women leaving jobs as they feel they’ve lost their marbles </h1>
<div> <div> By Hannah Furness, Royal Correspondent <time> 29 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Millions of women could be leaving the workforce after the menopause left them feeling they have “lost their marbles”, Davina McCall has warned.</p>
<p>The television presenter, fitness instructor and campaigner said that the effect of the menopause on women could be a “drain” on the economy.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, you feel like you’ve lost your marbles so badly that you are unable to continue [your work].</p>
<p>“Now imagine the drain on businesses and the economy if 13 million women leave their jobs because they just felt like they couldn’t continue.”</p>
<p>It is estimated that about 13 million women are currently perimenopausal or menopausal in the UK.</p>
<p><a>On embracing her 50s</a>, she said: “It’s a time of liberation. <a>It’s a time of shedding the shackles of inhibition</a> and of giving a damn. Because I haven’t always felt like that.</p>
<p>“It’s not just being on telly and it’s not just being a show-off. It’s that I don’t really care what people think, which is very liberating.</p>
<p>“I’ve never met a more kind of rowdy bunch of irreverent people than menopausal women. When we’re left to our own devices, we are very bloody funny.”</p>
<a>a range of workout DVDs</a> and equipment, McCall said that she works at her physical health to “stay alive longer, and I really enjoy the way that it helps my head stay clear of negativity”.
<p>“I’m just in a really good, happy, balanced state,” she said. “Sometimes I feel a bit guilty… but I’ve got nothing to complain about.”</p>
<p>The full interview is published in the December issue of <a>Women’s Health</a>, on sale from December 30</p>

<p>In or out, information avoider or seeker, in our home town or across the border, it looks like we’ll be having the weirdest New Year ever in a variety of ways.</p>
<h2>The Covid-cautious outdoor gathering</h2>
<p>Remember the fire pit or chiminea you sourced a year ago for all those chilly rule-of-six drinks outside? It’s time to get it out again and gather up the kindling/click on Amazon for smokeless fire logs. </p>
<p>And then, if you do successfully avoid alcohol, make a plan for a celebratory rather than groggy New Year’s Day. Across the UK (except for Wales), Parkrun, the free weekly timed 5k run, kicks off at 9am.</p>

<p>I would have spat out my tea at a survey revealing the nation thinks you start “slowing down” in your mid-40s, but I didn’t have time to make one before writing this.</p>
<p>The poll of 2,000 found that 43 is the age most Britons believe they will “slow down” after a fast-paced existence for 25 years.</p>
<p>Who are they kidding? I’m 43 and I don’t think I’ve ever worked harder in my life.</p>
<p>I had this fantasy that once I hit 40, and the children were at the stage where I no longer need to carry baby wipes, I’d be cruising towards retirement. Less work, more pay was the ambition. </p>
<p>It therefore follows that our 40s have no choice but to be the decade when we ramp it up, not take it down a gear. We’ve done the nitty-gritty of baby care. Now is the <a>time to refocus on our careers</a>.</p>
<p>No. I have got to make hay while the sun shines (and gives me wrinkles). Botox, anyone? Thank you, I’ll have my entire face frozen in time, please. </p>
<p>It is a cruel decade because, as well being the period when you feel the most pressure to “make it”, your 40s also tend to coincide with midlife crises, the menopause and your children taking school exams.</p>
<p>Maritally, it is the time when relationships, under the dual strain of work and domestic life, either sink or swim. Little wonder, then, that in 2019, the average age at the time of the divorce was 47.7 years old for men and 47 for women. </p>
<p>While husbands start chasing younger women and taking up cycling in some desperate attempt to cling on to their dwindling testosterone supplies, wives stop producing as much oestrogen and progesterone. What a callous hand Mother Nature plays.</p>
<p>Just as we are finally breaking through the glass ceiling – truly making a name for ourselves after decades of grafting – women are suddenly inflicted with hot sweats, brain fog and a lack of libido. </p>
<div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> The world would be a better place if women held the purse strings </h1> <p> The sad truth is that we will never be handed the mankind’s money; we have to fight hard enough simply to get what’s owed </p> </div>

<p>Here's a peculiar Little Women detail about my Northern Irish upbringing that would have novelist Louisa May Alcott reaching for her quill and historian Lucy Worsley punching the air to the roar of the suffragettes.</p>
<p>Our role model earned the money and spent the money, drove the car, put up shelves, shovelled the coal and sent us all to university.</p>
<p>Although she would have brindled at the word “feminist” my science teacher mother told us: “if you don’t know how to be a housewife nobody will ask you to be a housewife”.</p>
<p>Wow. These days only the residents of Millionaires’ Row can afford to be housewives. It’s the ultimate totem of marrying well. But I digress.</p>
<p>To me, men were “other”. But not better. Why would they be? How could they be? In my – admittedly circumscribed – experience, power wasn’t gendered.</p>
<p>According to the UN, as of September 2021 there were just 26 women serving as heads of state or leaders of government out of 195 countries. At the current rate, gender equality at this level will take another 130 years.</p>
<p>This, despite the fact women make up 50 per cent of the population. This despite the fact that again and again studies show that businesses with women in senior roles perform better than male-run companies.</p>
<p>Research published in July 2021 by diversity consultancy The Pipeline revealed a 40 per cent increase in performance during 15 months of the Covid crisis.</p>
<p>Yet according to a Treasury report in July, women now make up only 22 per cent of executive committees and 32 per cent of boards in the UK financial sector.</p>
<p>Research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that <a>the average working-age woman in the UK earns 40 per cent less than her male counterparts</a>. Oh and blokes pocket £700 more than women with every pay rise.</p>
<p>If we can’t get the same money for the same job, what in the name of Croesus are the chances of men letting us sort out the global economy?</p>
<p>Two years to effect visible, palpable change, Barack Obama suggested. Not long. But long enough. Are the men who rule most of us (and yes, that includes the Vatican, Sister) willing to give it a punt?</p>
<p>A sad reflection of subsistence living but also a snapshot of divergent priorities. The truth is women will never be handed the world’s money; we have to fight hard enough simply to get what’s owed.</p>

<p>The situation is so bad that even Gordon Brown condemned the withdrawal last week, railing at the irony of nations who vowed to end absolute poverty this decade catapulting a whole nation straight into it.</p>
