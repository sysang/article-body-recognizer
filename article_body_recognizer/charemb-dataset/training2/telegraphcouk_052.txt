<p>Sir Keir Starmer said police had difficult decisions to make in judging whether to intervene in situations like that in Bristol.</p>
<p>He told LBC Radio: "I was very struck by Superintendent Andy Bennett, who was the police officer, the superintendent, on the ground who judged the situation.</p>
<p>"And he said he was really disappointed by the vandalism and the bringing down of the statue. But he didn't think it was the right thing to intervene, because it might make the situation worse."</p>
<p>But there was also criticism of the policing of the demonstrations in London, where protestors defaced a statue of Sir Winston Churchill and also clambered onto the Cenotaph in Whitehall.</p>
<p>One person could be seen attempting to set fire to a union flag on the Cenotaph just hours after the country had marked the 76th anniversary of the D-Day landings.</p>
<p>Unrest which followed the largely peaceful demonstration resulted in 36 police officers being injured.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents more than 30,000 front line police officers in London, has said officers were ill equipped to deal with the violent scenes.</p>
<p>"Whilst we understand and appreciate the cause that is being highlighted, a violent minority have decided to attack our colleagues. We have sadly seen colleagues bloodied this weekend. It is never acceptable.</p>
<p>“If bottles and fireworks are being thrown at our police officers, we should have public order equipment on. No ifs. No buts. Our colleagues’ safety should be of paramount importance to our police leaders.”</p>

<header> <h1> Vandals who criminally damage memorials to face up to 10 years in jail </h1> <p> Current rules limit jail terms to a maximum of three months unless vandals cause more than £5,000 worth of damage </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor <time> 9 March 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Vandals who criminally damage memorials face up to 10 years in jail under a new law.</p>
<p>The Government is to scrap the current rule that limits jail terms to a maximum of only three months unless vandals cause more than £5,000 worth of damage.</p>
<p>It means they will face up to 10 years in jail and/or a fine of up to £2,500 regardless of the value of the damage to a memorial.</p>
<a>Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill</a>, will include those who urinate or defecate on a statue – although because the offence relates to criminal damage, these are more likely to be covered by public order offences.
<a>protests where the Cenotaph</a> and
<a>Sir Winston Churchill’s statue</a> by Parliament were daubed with graffiti, forcing them to be boarded up, and statues linked to the slave trade were damaged including the toppling of Edward Colston’s in Bristol.
<p>One man linked to a far right group was even seen urinating next to the <a>memorial to PC Keith Palmer</a>, who died protecting Parliament from a terror attack in 2017.</p>
<p>More than 120 Tory MPs supported a backbench desecration of war memorials bill which will now be subsumed into the new legislation.</p>
<p>Former army officer James Sunderland, who co-sponsored the bill, said: “We have seen far too many incidents of vandalism where the judges have not had the powers to respond adequately to the public outrage.</p>
<p>“I don’t think for a second the courts are going to be sentencing people to 10 years but it gives the judges the powers effectively to deal with it.”</p>
<p>Jonathan Gullis, a co-sponsor of the bill and former teacher, said the toppling of statues like Colston’s in Bristol was “unhelpful and divisive.”</p>
<p>“We have uncomfortable truths about how this country got its wealth but it doesn’t justify tearing down statues,” he said.</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas Soames, Sir Winston Churchill’s grandson, said desecrating memorials was “disgusting and horrifying” although he questioned if 10 years jail might “overdo the point”.</p>
<p>“Maybe increase the fines to £10,000 and up to four years in prison. but I am thrilled the Government is doing something about it,” he said.</p>
<p>The new sentencing and police bill, to be unveiled on Tuesday, also gives new powers to police to curb non-violent protests including dictating start and finish times, and setting maximum noise levels – enforced by tougher sentences.</p>
<p>It will also close a loophole used by protesters to breach conditions so that an offence will be committed if the protester ought to have known about restrictions. Blocking entrances to Parliament will also become an offence.</p>
<a>sports coaches and religious leaders from engaging in sexual activity with 16- and 17-year-olds</a>, as revealed last week by The Telegraph. It will put them on a par with teachers.

<p>Sir Winston Churchill’s statue is to remain free from its hoarding - and will be joined by Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela when their coverings are removed before the weekend.</p>
<p>It prompted widespread condemnation with Boris Johnson saying that protecting a statue of Winston Churchill from potential vandalism by boarding it up was "absurd and shameful.”</p>
<p>The latest moves came as the Metropolitan Police released 35 images of people wanted in connection with the investigation into violent clashes in central London during recent demonstrations.</p>
<p>Police have so far made 230 arrests have been made to date, of which 128 involved the Far Right protests last weekend.</p>
<p>Commander Bas Javid said: “We are now asking for the public’s help in identifying people, who we need to talk to about the violence seen at the protests. If you have any information, no matter how small, please get in touch.”</p>
<p>The pictures have been drawn from hours of CCTV analysed by officers as well as body worn video from officers and footage circulated on social media.</p>

<p>Four people have been charged with criminal damage over the toppling of the statue of Edward Colston in Bristol in June.</p>
<p>Rhian Graham, 29, Milo Ponsford, 25, Jake Skuse, 32, and Sage Willoughby, 21, are all due to appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court on January 25, the Crown Prosecution Service said.</p>
<p>The statue of 17th-century slave trader Colston was toppled and thrown into Bristol harbour on June 7 during a Black Lives Matter protest.</p>
<p>It was later recovered from the water by Bristol City Council and assessed to have suffered £3,750 worth of damage.</p>
<p>No arrests were made at the time but Avon and Somerset Police launched an investigation.</p>
<p>The CPS said on Wednesday that it had authorised charges following a review of a file of evidence from the force.</p>
<p>A spokesman said: "The Crown Prosecution Service reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against all four are now active and that they have the right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>"It is extremely important there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice these proceedings."</p>
<p>Following the toppling of the statue, officers reviewed CCTV footage and other pictures and video to identify those believed to be involved.</p>
<p>One man was arrested, with seven men and one woman asked to attend a police station for a voluntary interview.</p>
<p>In September, Avon and Somerset Police said detectives would approach the CPS for a charging decision against four people - three men and a woman.</p>
<p>The five other people - men aged 18, 20, 29, 33 and 47 - were offered a conditional caution for the offence of causing criminal damage to property valued under £5,000.</p>
<p>Under the conditions of the caution, they had to complete a questionnaire from a history commission set up by Bristol City Council.</p>
<p>They had to pay a fine of £100, which would be sent to Bristol-based charity Nilaari, and take part in two hours of environmental improvement works arranged by Bristol City Council.</p>

<header> <h1> Extinction Rebellion protesters plotting further action against newspapers </h1> <p> Activists plan to resume their tactics of mass disruption after escaping conviction in several recent court cases </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Hayley Dixon, Special Correspondent <time> 29 April 2021 • 2:52pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Extinction Rebellion protesters have vowed to continue their attacks on the British press after activists escaped convictions for a printworks blockade on a technicality.</p>
<p>Emboldened by victory in recent court cases, this weekend will see the activist return to their tactics of mass disruption with around 200 roadblocks planned across the country.</p>
<p>Despite widespread condemnation of targeted attacks on the press, they are also plotting further action against newspapers in the coming months, The Telegraph can reveal.</p>
<p>The news comes after Katie Anne Ritchie-Moulin, 22, Harrison Radcliffe, 21, and Luca Vitale, 22 were all cleared of trespass after blockading a printing press in Knowsley in September last year.</p>
<p>In a night of chaos which prevented the distribution of 500,0000 copies of national newspapers, including The Telegraph, Daily Mail, and the Sun, activists targeted the Merseyside plant and a second in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire.</p>
<p>But the three from Knowsley were cleared at Liverpool Magistrates' Court on Wednesday after the manager could not say with certainty where the boundary was between public and private land.</p>
<p>After the verdict, <a>Home Secretary Priti Patel said</a>: “The free Press is a cornerstone of our democracy, and the disruptive and frankly dangerous tactics deployed by these individuals last year were totally unacceptable.”</p>
<p>She pointed out that the Government is strengthening protest laws as the police say the “current legislation used for managing protests is not fit for purpose.'</p>
<p>Sources at the time of the blockades claimed that the decision of Hertfordshire Police to charge 51 people with the lesser offence of obstruction of the highway was made because of the same difficulty in establishing that boundary.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s verdict came just days after six XR protesters were cleared by a jury of <a>criminal damage on Shell’s London headquarters</a> despite the judge directing that they had no defence in law.</p>
<p>After his acquittal Mr Radcliffe said: "The next step is continuing this and trying to keep pressure on the press."</p>
<p>An XR spokesman confirmed on Thursday that they see the press as a target, and they are planning a mass “Free the Press” “uprising” on Sunday 27 June.</p>
<p>Details of how they plan to target newspapers including The Telegraph have yet to be revealed, but the proposals have caused concern among free speech campaigners.</p>
<p>Toby Young, General Secretary of the Free Speech Union, said: “Political protestors targeting newspapers because they’re not more sympathetic to their cause is a very worrying development.”</p>
<p>It comes as the green activists are set to ramp up their action now coronavirus lockdowns are easing, beginning this weekend with a “Rebellion of One” in which individual protesters will sit down in the road to block traffic.</p>
<p>A spokesman said that they have around 200 people signed up to sit down on the road on May 1.</p>
<p>According to XR’s own estimates each “Rebellion” could force five police officers to respond, meaning 1,000 police officers would be tied up dealing with the blockades.</p>
<p>Zoë Blackler, from the XR media team, said that the Shell decision in particular “shows that when people learn the truth about the damage being done to our planet they will support radical action to stop it”.</p>
<p>She said: “The government needs to take notice, tell the truth about the dangers we all face, and trust the people to do what is necessary.</p>
<p>“Until that happens, XR remains committed to peaceful mass protest, and brave citizens will continue to disobey, whatever the legal consequences."</p>
<h1> We were sentencing Edward Colston ‘to death’, statue-toppling protester tells trial </h1>
<p> Jake Skuse, one of four on trial for criminal damage, tells court: ‘I knew I was in the right, I knew everyone wanted it down’ </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 22 December 2021 • 8:50pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A protester who helped roll the statue of Edward Colston to Bristol Harbour and throw it in the water has said he was staging a symbolic "sentencing" of the slave trader.</p>
<p>The memorial to the 17th century merchant was <a>toppled during a Black Lives Matter march</a> in June 2020, before being dragged and rolled 500m and dumped in the harbour.</p>
<p>It became an iconic moment in the anti-racism protests staged around the world in the wake of the <a>murder of George Floyd by police in the US</a>.</p>
<p>Jake Skuse, 33, is one of four people on trial for criminal damage for allegedly orchestrating the moving of the statue to the water's edge.</p>
<p>His co-defendants Rhian Graham, 30, Milo Ponsford, 26, and Sage Willoughby, 22, are <a>accused of helping to pull the statue down</a>.</p>
<p>Giving evidence on Wednesday, Skuse told the court he accepts rolling it towards Pero's Bridge, named after an enslaved man who lived in Bristol, and <a>throwing it in the harbour</a>.</p>
<p>"I don't think the council did their job properly - if there was a racist piece of graffiti, they would have removed it," he said.</p>
<p>The defendant was not present when the statue was pulled down, and instead arrived a few minutes later after receiving a telephone call from a friend about it.</p>
<p>Skuse said he felt it would be "significant" to drag the statue along the cobbles to the harbour, because he thought enslaved people might have been dragged to the ships there.</p>
<p>He said he was not sure if his history was correct, but added: "It just felt right."</p>
<p>Skuse was caught on CCTV shouting "say something" as the statue was hoisted over the railings.</p>
<p>He told the court he had wanted someone to say something to mark the occasion.</p>
<p>"It was like a sentence, we were sentencing him to death - we all had to come together and say a few words and then he (Colston) could f— off."</p>
<p>When asked if he thought he was damaging the statue, he said: "It didn't even enter my head. It was a piece of trash on the floor when I turned up.</p>
<p>"I knew I was in the right, I knew everyone wanted it down, I knew Bristol wanted it, everyone wanted the same thing."</p>
<p>The defendant said he felt the statue should be thrown in the river "so the council couldn't do their job incorrectly again and put it back up".</p>
<p>Graham, of Colston Road, Bristol; Ponsford, of Otter Close, Bishopstoke, Hampshire; Skuse, of Farley Close, Bristol; and Willoughby, of Gloucester Road, Bristol, are on unconditional bail.</p>

<p>It may be early days, but the Sentence of the Year contest for 2022 already looks a foregone conclusion. On Saturday, the following line appeared towards the end of a newspaper report about an anti-vaccine march.</p>
<p>“John O’Looney, a funeral director and antivaxer, had been due to speak at the march but is believed to be in hospital with Covid.”</p>
<p>Reading that sentence, it’s hard to avoid feeling a pang of sympathy for our comic novelists. Not even the most revered among them could hope to get a line like that past their editors.</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr Amis, it’s very droll. I’m just wondering whether perhaps the name you’ve given to this eccentric conspiracy theorist is a touch lacking in subtlety.”</p>
<p>It’s certainly an interesting theory. I can’t help feeling, however, that it may contain a tiny flaw.</p>
<p>Still, not everyone necessarily hates the thought of living under a dictatorship. For one man, in fact, it appears to have an irresistible allure.</p>

<p>I’m afraid we have reached the point where the Duke of York must give up his titles to protect his mother. It may be a sleazy joke on social media for some. For the monarchy it could not be more serious.</p>

<div> <div> By Annabel Rivkin and Emilie McMeekan, The Midults <time> 31 December 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Imagine for a moment that this letter read, ‘Dear AE, my wife has cut her hair very short and she looks unfeminine and ridiculous. How can I make her see that she ought to know better?’ It’s not hugely comfortable reading is it?</p>
<p>So often we see our own self-image reflected in the decisions of the people we love. Our issues with controlling their decisions will be, more often than not, to do with our own vulnerabilities. </p>
<p>Your seething resentment and embarrassment will humiliate him and, although people may not remember what has been said, they will always remember the way someone else has made them feel.</p>
<p>You could, we suppose, explain to him that you are finding the change in his appearance a little uncomfortable and that you don’t like the man bun, but – and this is a GARGANTUAN but – you love him however he looks.</p>
<p>Go easy, Pained. Don’t turn a hairstyle into a horror story.</p>

<div> <div> By Shane Watson <time> 31 December 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>After we’ve all endured yet another tough 12 months, these are the people we want to see more of in the coming year. </p> <h2>Oprah </h2> </div> </div>
<p>So far these have all been refugees from the UK – in 2021 we had Harry, Meghan and Adele – but the next Hollywood makeover could come from anywhere.</p>
<p>As in Abba the avatars – back in all their Seventies platform-booted, flick-fringed and feather boa-ed finery for a series of concerts – and still sounding like the happiest days of your youth, even if you weren’t yet born.</p>
<h2>Gareth Southgate </h2>
<p>We also predict the relaxed open necked linen shirt, accessorised with a silver link chain and gold watch (purely decorative, it doesn’t work) is a look that may catch on in media circles.</p>
<a>Miss Americana</a>) and because she is going out with a Brit (Joe Alwyn) and lives here (not sure where but somewhere), so there’s a big opportunity that appears to be being wasted. Glastonbury maybe? Hope so.
<a>Soane designer</a> responsible has gone to ground. But surely she’ll have to surface in 2022, and aren’t we dying to see who she does up next?
<p>The point is TC has still got star power like few other actors and, 36 years after the original Top Gun was released (gulp), Top Gun Maverick is out in May. Can’t pretend you’re not excited.</p>
<a>Clarkson’s Farm</a> we are most looking forward to seeing more of, when the new series drops, but needs must, so we’re picking Charlie. 
<a>ITV’s An Audience with Adele</a> back in November, Adele nominated Kaluuya the person she would most like to collaborate with in future. Bit of a shock for Dua Lipa and her bezzie, Stormzy, but there you go, that’s showbiz. 
<p>And because every millisecond of this occasion was scripted and rehearsed and rehearsed until it was wink and gesture perfect, we must </p>
<p>The Queen was not the only person who stayed up late to watch the <a>US Open</a> and then retired to bed wondering if they had just witnessed the best women’s tennis match in history. </p>
<p>Aside from being handy with a racket Raducanu is the athletic role model marketing people can only conjure in their dreams (how nice does she look in her Nike tennis gear?) and she’s ours!</p>
<p>And she’s just getting started! (Also a shout out to Tim Henman who played a blinder as her courtside Dad in the absence of her actual Dad.) We very much hope to be seeing him cheering her on in the Royal Box come Wimbledon.</p>
<p>It’s been confirmed that there will be a fourth season of <a>Succession</a>, the slick, sharp, dog-eat-dog saga about power struggles within a media dynasty from the most in-demand writer of the hour, Jesse Armstrong. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Sarah Snook (Shiv Roy) will play Anne Elliot in a TV adaptation of Persuasion, which is terrific news for those of us who like to watch the cogs whirring under that calm ginger cat that got the cream exterior.</p>
<p>He rang Ed Sheeran after Ed became a dad, Adele when she hit the big time, Kate Garraway when her husband Derek Draper was in the ICU, Ant when he fell off the wagon – and those are just the ones we know about.</p>
<a>Belfast</a>, is already being tipped for Oscars. Although in the end
<a>The Power of the Dog</a> may just beat them to it.
<p>(You may remember Linda was partial to a denim skirt, a poncho and clogs and had a mullet to compete with Rod Stewart’s. We didn’t appreciate her look enough at the time.)</p>
<p>The star of the first season of <a>Bridgerton</a> is hotly tipped to be the new James Bond, though only as hotly as Tom Hardy and Richard Madden, so may we just say, Rege is what we’re thinking. </p>
<p>Of them all he is the fittest, looks by far the best in clothes (especially a waistcoat) and has the potential to revive suits and tailoring in general in a way that Daniel Craig just didn’t.</p>
<a>The Duke of Cambridge</a> has finally very much grown into his looks, which especially work for us when he is wearing his RAF blue-grey greatcoat and cap. The cap is possibly the key.
<a>The Crown </a>and frankly it feels like an age since we got our last Dom West fix (Uncle Matthew in 2021’s
<a>The Pursuit of Love</a>). He’s like Olivia Colman, we need one of them appearing in something at all times.
<h2>And the ones we'd like to see less of...</h2>
<p>So, Madonna (she’s not the only one, but she does go the extra distance) thinks, “I’m getting it all out, people are going to be amazed…” Well, yes they are, but not in the way you hope. </p>
<div> <p>And all the multi-millionaire, now-grown-up stars of the Harry Potter series. Two words: self-satisfied and disloyal – also dim and self-serving – but it’s the first two that kill it for us every time.</p> <h2>Adele</h2> </div>
<div> <div> <p>For spreading the rumour that the Covid vaccine causes impotence. Woah. What about shrinking genitals and hair loss? We heard that.</p> <h2>Stanley Johnson</h2> </div> </div>
<p>If you were PM you would want your dad around when you need him but otherwise very much in the deep background. Might be better if Stanley stepped back for a while.</p>

<h1> Resolutions shouldn’t be about self-harm – which is why I’m giving up dating apps </h1>
<p> After vowing to read the entire works of James Joyce in 2021, this New Year our dating columnist is going easy on herself </p>
<div> <div> By Stacey Duguid <time> 1 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>A tangle of fairy lights, the chaotic rush of last-minute presents, piles of unwritten cards, cardboard boxes waiting to be broken down ready for the recycling bin. </p>
<a>New Year’s resolutions</a>.
<p>We’re going about this New Year’s Day thing all wrong. Instead of removing treats and little crutches that help us through the day, month and year, why not consider some thoughtful additions rather than donning a hair shirt?</p>
<p>The high bar has been lowered since the Joyce escapade, but I’ve still managed to craft a fairly robust list of resolutions, or, as they are now known in these woke times, “intentions”.</p>
<p>By the end of lockdown, they were in love. In LOVE! (The humans, not the dogs, although the dogs may have liked each other too, who knows and who cares, frankly).</p>
<p>I think of her hopeful message often, either while out walking the dog or en route home from yet another digital dating mishap. How generous she was to share her story with me, a total stranger. </p>
<p>Dog walks, or just walks generally, can provide fitness, mental headspace, and, it turns out, new relationships. Intention two is to walk more.</p>
<p>However, I did make one lasting intention, an idea jotted down on a loose piece of paper and kept in a jewellery box in my bathroom: do less, enjoy more. </p>
<p>Drained from leaving the family home and moving house twice in three months, not to mention the wider cultural effects and emotional impact of Covid-19, I remember feeling wrung out. So intention three is to continue to do less, enjoy more.</p>
<p>For years I’ve carried in my head a list of things to do in retirement, things that feel impossible to achieve at the moment what with kids, work, etc. </p>
<p>I decided a few years back to go back to art school in retirement, but by doing less and enjoying more, by the end of last year I began working with a mentor, the <a>artist Tony Hull</a>. </p>
<p>One of the things on the list of stuff I planned to do in retirement is gardening. However, this month I shall (fingers crossed) exchange and complete on the house I’ve been trying to buy since last October. </p>
<p>Walk more, do less and enjoy more, make art, embrace gardening and stay off dating apps – simple intentions for a chaotic world.</p>
<p>I’m already wondering who I’ll bump into at the garden centre…</p>
