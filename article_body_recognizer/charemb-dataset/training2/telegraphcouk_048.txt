<p><a>“Megxit,”</a> declares the Duke, “was, or is, a misogynistic term.” I find this remark surprising. So, for the Duke’s benefit, I could take this opportunity to clear the matter up for him.</p>
<p>This antipathy, of course, is nothing new. In February, the Duke said he and his wife had left Britain to escape the country’s “toxic” media.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it might make it harder for the Duke to sell copies of the autobiography his publishers have reportedly paid him $20 million for. But I think this is a sacrifice we should be willing to make.</p>
<h1> 'No identity – they never had control': Former Manchester United players tear into dire Wolves defeat </h1>
<p> Paul Ince, Gary Neville, Rio Ferdinand - along with Jamie Redknapp - distinctly unimpressed with United after the 1-0 loss to Wolves </p>
<div> <div> By Tom Morgan, Sports News Correspondent <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:55am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Manchester United faced blistering criticism from former players Paul Ince, Gary Neville and Rio Ferdinand after Ralf Rangnick's side slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to Wolves. </p>
<a>following a dismal performance</a> in a 4-2-2-2 system which preceded Joao Moutinho's winner for the away side in the 82nd minute. The former Tottenham and Liverpool midfielder suggested United's display was even worse
<a>than the 4-1 defeat to Watford</a> which led to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer losing his job. 
<p>Sitting alongside Redknapp, Ince, who played for both United and Wolves, described United's performance in the first half as "dead". </p>
<div> <blockquote><p>It’s not good. It really isn’t!</p>— Gary Neville (@GNev2) <a>January 3, 2022</a></blockquote> </div>
<p>Redknapp drew a withering comparison between United and their runaway Premier League leading neighbours Manchester City. </p>

<header> <h1> Transfer notebook: Newcastle United target Sevilla defender Diego Carlos </h1> <p> Plus: Nathan Patterson has completed his £12m move to Everton from Rangers and will wear the No 3 shirt at Goodison Park </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Mike McGrath and Sam Dean <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:48pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Diego Carlos, the Sevilla centre-back, is on Newcastle’s list of potential signings as they look at alternatives to Sven Botman. </p>
<p>Botman has been Eddie Howe’s No 1 choice but Lille are reluctant to sell, bringing Carlos into the frame as a high-profile target in a priority position. </p>
<p>Tottenham’s Joe Rodon is a loan option which Howe is considering but the club would also like a proven top-level centre-back to help them climb out of the relegation zone and Carlos is highly regarded at St James’ Park. </p>
<p>The Brazilian, 28, has been an outstanding performer for Sevilla during the last two seasons, which has included a Europa League triumph as well as beating Wolves and Manchester United in the knockout stages. </p>
<p>Sevilla would be expected to make a huge profit on the £13.5 million they paid Nantes to land the defender from the French club in 2019, with his market value now beyond £30m. </p>
<p>Newcastle, despite being threatened by relegation, are close to signing Kieran Trippier from Atletico Madrid and are also targeting a striker during the window. </p>
<h2>Maitland-Niles on verge of joining Roma</h2>
<p>Ainsley Maitland-Niles, the Arsenal midfielder, is close to joining Roma on loan for the rest of the season.</p>
<p>Maitland-Niles has started only two games in the Premier League this season and is wanted by Jose Mourinho, the Roma head coach.</p>
<p>Maitland-Niles, who has five England caps and can also play as a full-back, will join fellow Englishmen Chris Smalling and Tammy Abraham in Italy if the deal can be finalised.</p>
<p>Discussions are ongoing between the two clubs but any loan is unlikely to include an option or obligation for Roma to buy Maitland-Niles in the summer.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old was keen to join Everton in the summer, but Arsenal blocked the move.</p>
<h2>Everton sign Patterson from Rangers in £12m deal</h2>
<p>Nathan Patterson has completed his £12m move to Everton from Rangers and will wear the No 3 shirt at Goodison Park. </p>
<p>The Scotland right-back, 20, has agreed a five-and-a-half-year deal which will run until 2027 and joins Ukraine left-back Vitalii Mykolenko as the club’s early January signings. </p>
<p>Patterson says he spoke to Seamus Coleman before signing and will now be competing for the right-back place with the Everton captain in Rafa Benitez’s line-up. </p>
<p> “It is really exciting to come to a club that has huge talent in the team. I am going to work my socks off and hopefully I can do well with them in training and in games.</p>
<h2>Pogba in no rush to decide future</h2>
<p>Paul Pogba can talk to European clubs about a pre-contract for next season but he will return from injury at Manchester United before making any decision on his future. </p>
<p>The France midfielder, 28, is in the final six months of his contract at Old Trafford and is recovering from a groin injury, which raised the possibility of committing to another team for 2022/23 before pulling on the United shirt again. </p>
<h2>Monaco eye Eriksen move</h2>
<p>Monaco are one of the clubs monitoring Christian Eriksen as he steps up his training this month after suffering a cardiac arrest during Euro 2020 last year. </p>
<p>The former Tottenham midfielder, 29, had his contract terminated at Inter Milan under Italian regulations preventing him playing with an internal defibrillator. </p>
<h2>Livingston want Liverpool defender</h2>
<p>Liverpool youngster Morgan Boyes has been targeted by Scottish Premiership club Livingston on a permanent deal. </p>
<p>The 20-year-old centre-back has been playing on loan at Fleetwood Town this season but has been recalled ahead of a potential move north of the border. </p>
<h2>Stoke keeping it in the family</h2>
<p>Stoke were dealt a blow when Harry Souttar suffered a serious knee injury which is expected to rule him out of the season. But they are considering a very similar replacement in his brother John. </p>
<p>John Souttar, 25, has impressed scouts while playing for Hearts and for Scotland. His younger brother plays for Australia.</p>
<h2>Middlesbrough leading race for Arsenal's Folarin Balogun, on loan</h2>
<p>Middlesbrough are leading the race to sign Arsenal striker Folarin Balogun on loan until the end of the campaign. The 20-year-old is highly rated at the Emirates Stadium but has struggled for first-team opportunities this season. </p>
<p>Nottingham Forest were also interested in signing Balogun but talks are understood to have collapsed last week. Forest went on to secure the loan signing of Aston Villa striker Keinan Davis. </p>

<h1> Stuart Broad is younger than James Anderson - but must prove his worth to prevent his career ending earlier </h1>
<p> One half of England's great new-ball partnership is frustrated at missing out on Tests at the Gabba and MCG and contemplating his future </p>
<div> <div> By Tim Wigmore <time> 2 January 2022 • 6:21pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Whenever England’s two highest Test match wicket-takers are compared, Stuart Broad likes to make a simple point. While he and James Anderson are considered to be of the same generation, Broad is actually four years younger.</p>
<a>there is now a sense that Broad’s wonderful career might end earlier</a>. In 2021, Broad played seven Tests, and only took 12 wickets - fewer than two per Test - at an average of 39.5. Anderson played 12 Tests, snaring 39 wickets at 21.7.
<p>Yet Broad says that his hunger to play Test cricket remains undimmed. And <a>recent history attests to how foolhardy it can be to write-off Broad</a>. </p>
<a>declared that he was “frustrated, angry and gutted”</a> with the decision - and promptly took 29 wickets at 13.4 in the rest of the summer. 
<p>But if 2021 did not see an obvious collapse in Broad's skills, it did see something as significant for his future: the emergence of an obvious replacement.</p>
<sup>st</sup> over and the second new ball; Robinson’s 12 in this phase of the game came every 52 balls. As he demonstrated in Galle, Chennai and Melbourne, Anderson remains outstanding with the old ball.
<p>Broad’s future worth to England, you suspect, rests on whether he can demonstrate his effectiveness in altogether less favourable conditions. If he plays, the last two Ashes Tests will surely allow him this chance. </p>
<h1> ‘Money-hungry sex kitten’ report rejected as part of Prince Andrew’s defence </h1>
<p> New York judge describes Duke's submission of newspaper clippings and accuser's The Billionaire’s Playboy Club manuscript as 'PR stunt' </p>
<div> <div> By Victoria Ward <time> 17 December 2021 • 8:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duke of York has failed in his bid to have newspaper cuttings describing his accuser as a "money-hungry sex kitten" taken into account by a New York judge, after it was dismissed as a PR stunt.</p>
<a>her sexual abuse complaint</a>.
<p>However, he agreed to take into account <a>a settlement deal</a> made between Ms Giuffre and Jeffrey Epstein in 2009, which the Duke has argued contains a release that invalidates her claim against him.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre, now 38, <a>claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew</a> on three separate occasions in 2001, when she was 17. She is seeking unspecified damages.</p>
<h2>‘Sensationalism and innuendo’</h2>
<p>The Duke’s lawyers are <a>seeking to have the complaint dismissed</a>, branding the civil action “baseless” and arguing that “sensationalism and innuendo have prevailed over the truth”.</p>
<p>They submitted a rebuttal of the “threadbare” complaint in October and attached as evidence several media reports and Ms Giuffre’s manuscript.</p>
<p>One American newspaper report described Ms Giuffre as a “money-hungry sex kitten” and quoted former friends who say she enjoyed living the high life and bragging about the money she made.</p>
<p>Another contained an interview with her ex-boyfriend, Philip Guderyon, who said he would drive her to Epstein's Palm Beach mansion.</p>
<p>“She was like the head b----,” he claimed. “She'd have like nine or 10 girls she used to bring to him. She never looked like she was being held captive.”</p>
<p>Also submitted as evidence was the 2011 interview Ms Giuffre gave the the Mail on Sunday, which was sold, along with the now infamous photograph of her with the Duke, for an alleged $160,000.</p>
<p>Ms Giuffre is said to have tried to get her manuscript, titled The Billionaire’s Playboy Club, published in 2011.</p>
<p>The Duke’s lawyers drew attention in their court filing to a description of a two-night liaison she allegedly had with Prince Andrew in New Mexico, which she later admitted had never happened.</p>
<p>Judge Kaplan will hear arguments on the Duke’s motion to dismiss the case on January 4.</p>

<header> <h1> France to ease UK travel restrictions after 'supersonic' rise in its cases </h1> <p> French government to widen list of valid reasons to travel to the country as case numbers are now similar to those in the UK </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Henry Samuel <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:18pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Travel restrictions between the UK and France will be eased slightly amid a "supersonic" rise in French infections, the French government announced on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Gabriel Attal, a government spokesman, said that France would make it a <a>"bit easier " to travel to and from the UK</a>, widening the official list of valid reasons to do so.</p>
<p>The French government sparked travel chaos for thousands of British holidaymakers - many of whom had hoped to go on ski holidays in the Alps - by banning them from coming to France late last year amid a surge in omicron cases in the UK.</p>
<p>The extended list of valid reasons for travel has not yet been clarified.</p>
<h2>Covid case numbers now similar in France and UK </h2>
<p>Mr Attal simply said the government had decided to “widen the list of compelling reasons, notably professional” given the fact that case numbers were now on similar levels in both countries.</p>
<p>The precise changes would be decided at a defence council meeting in the coming days, he said. </p>
<p>Upon arrival in France, all passengers must self-isolate for 48 hours after which they are to free to move around if they test negative. Police are conducting checks to ensure people are respecting the quarantine rules.</p>
<h2>Infections reaching 'stratospheric levels'</h2>
<p>The French decision to ease travel restrictions comes amid a "supersonic" rise in Covid infections in France, which shows no signs of slowing down in the coming days, said Mr Attal.</p>
<p>Omicron is now dominant in France and is driving a high number of daily infections. A total of 271,686 new Covid infections were reported in France over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>There were 218,000 new cases in the UK on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Infections are reaching "stratospheric levels" in the Ile-de-France region around Paris and some other parts of France and the situation in hospitals could worsen in coming weeks, said Mr Attal.</p>

<div> <div> By Simon Briggs, Tennis Correspondent <time> 1 November 2021 • 10:59pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Andy Murray wasted seven match points on Monday night – a career-worst statistic – as he was eliminated from the Paris Rolex Masters in the first round. </p>
<p>His conqueror was the so-called “Pitbull”, Dominik Koepfer, who refused to buckle at the end of a contest that was limited in quality but compelling in its gruesome fascination.</p>
<p>Late period Murray is a man for a marathon. He is too cussed to lie down easily, but not confident enough – because of his physical restrictions and limited training schedule – to be a comfortable front-runner. </p>
<p>When he is behind, he lifts himself. When he is ahead, he struggles to close. The upshot is the sort of painful struggle we saw last night, which just went on, and on, and on.</p>
<p>The deciding tie-break lasted more than 18 minutes before eventually falling the German’s way by an 11-9 margin.</p>
<p>Murray ascribed his uncertain start to a late switch in opponent, but admitted that there was no explanation for his ongoing struggle to hit the ball with any accuracy. </p>
<p>Norrie is still an outside bet to finish among the leading eight men of 2021, but he told reporters: “It's cool to have this added pressure of playing for an extra event at the end of the year.”</p>
