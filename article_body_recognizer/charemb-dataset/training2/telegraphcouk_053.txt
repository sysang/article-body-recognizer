<h2> <a> How cancel culture came to define 2021 – and the casualties it left behind </a> </h2>
<p> In 2020, cancel culture was a new term for many. In 2021 'cancellation' is one of our biggest fears. What changed, and who has it claimed? </p>
<h2> Page featuring JK Rowling's first national newspaper interview up for auction </h2>
<p> The former penniless author, then known as Joanne Rowling, was awaiting the result of $100 million bidding war for Harry Potter in July 1997 </p>

<h2> <a> The toxic ‘trans actor’ debate is ruining our culture – and lives </a> </h2>
<p> An actor 'cancelled' over a trans role has revealed the devastating impact it had on his health. Where will this idiotic puritanism end? </p>
<h2> <a> Trans activists aim to make women fearful of speaking openly about gender. And they're succeeding </a> </h2>

<p> Cancelled, toppled and forgotten – our hand-wringing about the past starts with ignorance in the classroom. It's time for a change </p>
<h1> Maya Forstater: ‘I am fighting for the right to say men can never be women’ </h1>
<p> As she wins a landmark appeal against an employment tribunal, Forstater explains why fighting her case on transgender issues is so important </p>
<div> <div> By Jane Gordon <time> 10 June 2021 • 12:34pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Maya Forstater never expected to become famous, let alone infamous. Three years ago she was, in her own words, just a rather ordinary middle-aged, middle-class, working mother and wife.</p>
<a>Twitter</a>, posting (she has counted) around five to 10 tweets a day. Little did she know that she would soon be right at the centre of a Twitter storm, with one of the world’s most famous authors,
<a>YouTube which have had millions of hits</a> portraying me as an awful, terrible person because of my views has been really hard on them. Because they can’t go out and defend me and, yes, because they love me.’
<a>mothers as ‘people who are pregnant’</a>.
<a>being dropped by her employers</a> and losing a subsequent employment tribunal.
<a>Financial Times’ Top 100 Women in Business</a>. Forstater questioned the idea of Bunce being recognised by the FT as a woman and refused to rescind her views.
<p>Forstater’s tribunal setback made the papers, but what propelled her story from minor news into international cause célèbre happened a day later – when JK Rowling sent an unexpected, supportive tweet.</p>
<a>#ThisIsNotADrill</a>,’ she wrote.
<p>‘I hadn’t made contact with JK Rowling before she tweeted, so that was a complete surprise but since then I have had a little bit of direct messaging with her. We haven’t met although I hope we will one day,’ says Forstater.</p>
<p>It occurred in an online debate following the Scout Association’s decision to U-turn on its trans policy. Among the changes, it scrapped advice that Scout leaders should not call children ‘boys or girls’.</p>
<p>‘I said that if a male child identifies as female and they are at camp, you have to think about where they are going to shower so that they will be safe and comfortable but you can’t do that by making the girls unsafe.’</p>
<p>‘I have no problem with whatever he does, but being awarded as a woman in business, I thought was obscene.’</p>
<a>Gender Recognition Certificate</a> and they go into female prisons, the women are vulnerable, most of them have been abused and even just to be locked up with someone who you know to be a man is frightening,’ she says, clearly upset.

<h2> Diane Kruger on having a surprise baby in her 40s: ‘I’m glad I didn’t have a kid at 30 – I would have resented it’ </h2>
<p> The model-turned-actor reveals all on motherhood, marriage and reinventing the female action hero </p>
<h1> Diane Kruger on having a surprise baby in her 40s: ‘I’m glad I didn’t have a kid at 30 – I would have resented it’ </h1>
<div> <div> By Sarah Bailey <time> 1 January 2022 • 9:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Last night was the first Diane has spent completely alone since welcoming a daughter with her fiancé Norman Reedus, the <a>Walking Dead</a> actor, three years ago. </p>
<p>Kruger wears cady dress, £4,200, <a>Valentino</a></p>
<a>Inglourious Basterds</a>, starred in the American TV remake of The Bridge, and won the Best Actress award at Cannes in 2017 for her performance as a grief-stricken mother in the German-language film In the Fade.
<p>She stars alongside an ensemble cast of global heavy-hitters: Jessica Chastain, Lupita Nyong’o, Penélope Cruz and Bingbing Fan. ‘Pretty awesome girls,’ says Diane.</p>
<p>Diane wears jacket, £850, and skirt, £855, both <a>Tory Burch</a>; sandals, £750, <a>Jimmy Choo</a></p>
<p>‘She pitched it to me as this female-driven spy film that’s more Jason Bourne than Charlie’s Angels,’ says Diane, with just the teeniest eyebrow raise. </p>
<p>‘When do you ever get to do that?’ The role – her first since giving birth – was intensely physical and getting herself to the required level of fitness was a consideration.</p>
<p>Though she was a curious child, she did not get along with school. ‘I grew up having a very strict sort of Catholic upbringing, which I detested.’</p>
<p>Her unhappiness was exacerbated by her father’s alcoholism (her parents divorced when she was in her teens), and it’s not hard to imagine why circumstances propelled her to leave home as early as she could. </p>
<p>She was a talented ballerina, studying at the Royal Ballet School in London in her summers, before an injury at 13 put paid to her ambition to dance professionally.</p>
<p>In the end, it was modelling that provided Diane with the escape route she was searching for, when, at 15, she won an Elite modelling competition in Germany and moved to Paris, fast-tracking her entrée into the fashion industry. </p>
<p>It was an exhilarating ride for about five years, before the novelty started to pall. ‘And then it just became a little lonely for me, a little redundant.’</p>
<p>Making the pivot to acting, as she has done so successfully, I wonder if she ever felt burdened by the preconceptions about her modelling career? Did she have to fight hard to be taken seriously?</p>
<p>If modelling was the springboard out of Germany and the opening act of Diane’s life adventure, the second game-changing moment involved a homecoming of sorts, when she made In the Fade. </p>
<p>She yearned to make a German-language film and pursued In the Fade director Fatih Akin, asking him to consider her. ‘In a way that changed my life a little bit. </p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2022, she feels excited about this next chapter in their family story. ‘Next year will be a big change for us for sure. It’s a year of redefining what we want to be and where we want to be as a family.’ </p>
<p>Reedus is finishing his 12-year run on The Walking Dead, and this means one less stop on the commute back and forth between various film and TV sets and their home in New York.</p>
<p>Having said that, Diane has enrolled their daughter in the Montessori school system, which means she can tap into regular schooling if there happens to be a Montessori nursery where one of them is shooting. </p>
<p>Kruger wears a verano dress, £1,350, <a>Emilia Wickstead</a> and satin mules, £625, <a>Jimmy Choo</a></p>
<p>One last topic to discuss: fashion. Has her style changed with motherhood? ‘For sure. I spend most of my days in the playground or getting dirty doing crafts. I’m literally in my pyjamas dropping off at school!’ </p>
<p>‘I kind of promised myself that starting next year, I’m going to make more of an effort and dress up during the week, or at least dress nicer,’ she laughs.</p>
