<p>Sydney and Melbourne home buyers face tougher lending standards within months as house prices in the two largest Australian cities rise hundreds of dollars every day.</p>
<div>Glimmer of hope for first-home buyers in 2022</div>
<p>First-home buyers whose new year’s resolution was to get into the property market might have to think again, with experts forecasting another tough year for aspirational homeowners.</p>
<p>“Next year will probably be tougher … it’s simply because the average level of prices is going to be higher than what it was this year,” said Shane Oliver, AMP Capital’s chief economist.</p>
<p>“Affordability is still deteriorating, just not as rapidly.”</p>
<p>First-home buyers also took a hit when government incentives, such as HomeBuilder, were wound back, according to Dr Oliver.</p>
<p>“I suspect when price gains start to slow down that might provide a bit of a window for first-home buyers,” he said, adding that was likely to occur in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>There are a number of factors pointing to slowing momentum in the property market, some of which appeared towards the end of 2021, according to EY Oceania’s senior economist Jonathan McMenamin.</p>
<p>“Increasing [interest] rates is another and a slight easing of clearance rates, which is now nationally down to 70 per cent,” Mr McMenamin said.</p>
<p>“We are starting to see a tightening in the labour market and, I suppose, the lowest unemployment rates across all the states, and that should put upward pressure on wages growth.”</p>
<p>Aspiring first-home buyer Pankaj Kumar is hopeful 2022 is the year he can crack the property market, but he is under no illusions that it will be any easier this time round after missing out several times last year.</p>
<p>“I’m very hopeful, otherwise I’ll go mad. But it’s really difficult, it not only brings pressure to yourself but also creates emotional impact to your family,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Kumar added there was a financial toll on top of the emotional toll, after spending thousands of dollars on contract reviews and building inspections.</p>
<p>While there are more properties to choose from and agents continue to tell him the market has cooled down, Mr Kumar said vendors know buyers are “desperate to buy”.</p>
<p>“When there were 10 people coming to auction, they now only see four to six [buyers]. That doesn’t mean it is not a hard chase for those people. It is still there,” he said.</p>
<p>The tougher lending landscape has also impacted his borrowing capacity, narrowly missing out on a property in late 2021 as a result.</p>
<p>“Everything is tightened now. I could have bought this last property if the bank didn’t tighten their guidelines.</p>
<p>“I’m being impacted by at least $1000 every month because of the change of interest rates.”</p>
<p>There is little doubt that taking out a home loan as a first-home buyer will be harder in 2022 compared to the start of last year, according to Mortgage Choice Blaxland, Penrith and Glenmore Park principal Rob Lees.</p>
<p>He puts it down to the change in the serviceability buffer that will see mortgage holders stress tested 3 per cent above their interest rate, up from 2.5 per cent, and stricter debt-to-income ratios.</p>
<p>“It’s probably reasonable, so people aren’t overextending themselves.</p>
<div><p>“Banks are honouring the pre-approvals but once it expires that will have an impact, and it may very well be that their maximum borrowing will be less.”</p></div>
<div>Sydney and Melbourne property values slow to lowest levels in a year</div>
<p>The nation’s two biggest capital cities recorded the slowest property price growth in the nation at the end of 2021, with both Melbourne and Sydney recording falls for some homes.</p>
<p>“As stock levels normalise and affordability constraints along with tighter credit conditions drag down demand, it’s reasonable to expect growth conditions will be more subdued in 2022,” Mr Lawless said.</p>
<p>Canberra house prices increased 0.6 per cent in December to $1,015,900, with apartments up 2.1 per cent to $584,100.</p>
<p>The strongest performer was Brisbane where the median house price jumped 3.1 per cent to $782,967 and apartments appreciated 1.6 per cent to $386,420.</p>
<p>Melbourne was the only capital city with an overall fall of 0.1 per cent, while Sydney recorded a rise of 0.3 per cent. All other city home values increased at a faster rate.</p>
<p>The regions surged again in December, with NSW houses up 2.5 per cent and Victoria up 1.7 per cent.</p>
<p>“These regions show less of an affordability challenge relative to the larger capitals, as well as better support for housing demand with Queensland in particular showing strong interstate migration,” Mr Lawless said.</p>
<p>“Additionally, we haven’t seen the same level of supply response seen in other regions, with the trend in advertised supply remaining well below average in these markets.”</p>

<div>‘Storm clouds gathering’ for Sydney and Melbourne property markets</div>
<p>Melbourne house prices and Sydney apartment values eased at the end of the biggest boom year in three decades, prompting economists to warn a downswing has begun in these two major property markets.</p>
<p>Property prices fell in Melbourne’s inner east and inner south, as well as Sydney’s city, inner south and eastern suburbs.</p>
<p>AMP Capital chief economist Shane Oliver said a “cyclical property downswing” was now under way. Dr Oliver forecasts national prices to rise 5 per cent in 2022, followed by a 5 to 10 per cent fall in 2023.</p>
<p>“Storm clouds are gathering for the property boom,” Dr Oliver said. “We expect a further slowing in national home price gains ahead of a peak and then price falls from later this year and in 2023.”</p>
<p>CoreLogic research director Tim Lawless said a surge in properties listed for sale as the year ended helped take the heat out of the Sydney and Melbourne markets, in addition to affordability limits and people leaving the states during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“As stock levels normalise and affordability constraints along with tighter credit conditions drag down demand, it’s reasonable to expect growth conditions will be more subdued in 2022.”</p>
<p>The most expensive quarter of homes across all the capital cities increased 2.6 per cent over the final three months of the year, compared to 3.7 per cent at the bottom and middle of the market.</p>
<p>SQM Research managing director Louis Christopher said total listings nationally were down over the month though Sydney recorded an increase when adjusting for seasonality.</p>
<p>The regions surged again in December, with NSW houses up 2.5 per cent and Victoria up 1.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Propertyology head of research Simon Pressley said businesses struggling during the pandemic and the loss of people from Sydney and Melbourne to the country or interstate represented a “huge challenge ahead”.</p>
<p>“I’m absolutely certain that work-from-home is a permanent structural change and the pursuit of an idyllic regional lifestyle will accelerate indefinitely,” Mr Pressley said.</p>
<p>CommSec chief economist Craig James said dwelling price growth would continue to moderate, rising 7 per cent next year on Commonwealth Bank forecasts and falling 10 per cent in 2023.</p>
<p>“A pick-up in listings, affordability constraints, rising fixed mortgage interest rates and new regulatory measures to tighten serviceability requirements for new mortgages are all conspiring to slow price momentum,” he said.</p>
<div>Lithium squeeze to drive higher prices as EV sales hit fast lane</div>
<p>A one-off cargo sold at auction by ASX-listed miner Pilbara Minerals in the September quarter sold for a staggering $US2240 a tonne.</p>
<p>Analysts have now begun updating their forecasts on the assumption that market tightness is likely to persist well into 2022 and the rally could have further to run.</p>
<p>Bank of America last week lifted its share price targets for a number of ASX-listed lithium producers including Allkem (16 per cent higher), Pilbara Minerals (13 per cent) and IGO (3 per cent).</p>
<p>Australia is the world’s biggest producer of lithium and accounts for an estimated 30 per cent of known resources. Most lithium in Australia, however, is exported as spodumene concentrate, rather than refined battery-ready material.</p>
<p>However, the increase will be insufficient to keep pace with near-term demand. “Hence, we expect spot pricing to remain elevated,” Mr Gabb said.</p>

<div>‘Treated like idiots’: Farmers wrestle land back from mining giant</div>
<p>Thirteen years after farmers started fighting to save the fertile Liverpool Plains in northern NSW they have bought back the land a Chinese miner had planned a mega coal project on.</p>
<p>But they won’t declare victory over fossil fuels until coal seam gas is banned from one of the nation’s most productive agriculture regions.</p>
<p>Caroona Coal Action Group spokesperson and local farmer Susan Lyle, who has dedicated a large portion of her life to battle the Shenhua mine, said governments were too slow to realise the project was environmentally untenable.</p>
<p>“I’ve been involved in the fight for the past decade and all along we were treated like idiots, government just wouldn’t listen to us,” Ms Lyle said.</p>
<p>Following public opposition former premier Gladys Berejiklian agreed in July 2017 to pay Shenhua $262 million to hand back 51 per cent of the exploration licence, but none of that land was slated for mining and the project proceeded.</p>
<p>Professor Acworth showed the ancient Mooki riverbed, buried deep underground, directly links the proposed mine pit to aquifers underneath the fertile black soil plains that supply the farmers’ bores that make the region so productive.</p>
<p>Lock the Gate Alliance spokesperson Georgina Woods said the future of the region was far from secure with the threat of a possible renewed coal seam gas mining licence hanging in the balance.</p>
<p>“To safeguard this foodbowl forever, the Perrottet government must also now cancel the remaining 1.1 million hectares of gas licences that hang over a large area of the north west, much of which is on the Liverpool Plains,” she said.</p>
<div>BHP bets on new African nickel mine as electric car era dawns</div>
<p>Melbourne-based BHP has struck a deal to invest $US100 million ($130 million) in the Kabanga Nickel project, regarded as the world’s largest development-ready nickel sulphide deposit, which is scheduled to begin first production in 2025.</p>
<p>Investors are now betting EVs will account for 40 per cent of new vehicle sales by 2030. BHP expects demand for nickel to quadruple by mid-century.</p>
<p>“This investment secures access to a world-class nickel sulphide resource and is aligned with BHP’s strategy to capture opportunities in future-facing commodities,” a BHP spokesman said.</p>
<p>In a historic move last year, BHP agreed to sell its global oil and gas division to Perth-based Woodside Petroleum, partly to free up its ability to increase spending on copper and nickel.</p>
<p>“BHP is the ideal partner for Kabanga Nickel, bringing significant advantages and expertise that will enable us to move ahead with the project,” Kabanga Nickel chief executive Chris Showalter said.</p>
<p>“Through development of Kabanga ... Tanzania will have a growing role in the supply of the battery metals needed to move to a global low-carbon economy.”</p>
<p>Doto Biteko, Tanzania’s minister of minerals, welcomed Kabanga Nickel’s investment in the country and said Tanzania stood “ready to help the world” in the production and refining of essential metals.</p>
<p>“Tanzania has a vision to become an important hub for critical decarbonisation minerals,” he said.</p>
<p>BHP shares were trading 3.8 per cent down at $44.74 in early afternoon trading.</p>
<div>BHP’s nickel partner sees high demand for ‘greener’ EV metals</div>
<p>Kabanga Nickel chief executive Chris Showalter said BHP’s investment decision would enable the venture to fast-track its pre-development works and strengthen its ability to keep to its timeline targeting first production by 2025.</p>
<p>“We’ve heard a number of the auto manufacturers saying, ‘By 2025, we really need to ramp up production, we really need these metals’,” Mr Showalter told The Age and the Herald.</p>
<p>However, supplies are failing to keep up with ballooning demand, leaving the auto industry reliant on metals sometimes sourced from jurisdictions with known environmental or human rights problems.</p>
<p>While commercial offtake negotiations had not yet begun, Mr Showalter said the company was fielding interest from a number of battery manufacturers and carmakers.</p>
<p>“It’s quite widely known they are really scrambling to try to secure the inputs for batteries... and it’s going to become increasingly harder for them to do that in an ESG-friendly way,” he said.</p>

<p>The chief executive of Australian coal miner New Hope has abruptly resigned after just 18 months in the job, and will depart the business immediately.</p>

<p>New Hope chairman Robert Millner said Mr Schmidt had led the company through a turbulent time for the business and the wider coal mining industry including a severe downturn in demand and prices for the fossil fuel.</p>
<p>“We are grateful to Mr Schmidt for his contributions to the business and wish him well in the future,” he said.</p>
<p>However, in a sign of the fossil fuel’s enduring near-term demand, coal prices rallied in 2021 amid a sharper-than-expected post-pandemic rebound in economic and industrial activity colliding with global supply shortages.</p>
<p>New Hope, which sunk to a $156 million loss in 2020, returned to profit last year on the back of the rebound in coal prices.</p>

<p>Gina Rinehart’s family company Hancock Prospecting plans to develop a 20 million tonnes per year iron ore mine on Mulga Downs, the cattle station where the heiress with an estimated worth of $31 billion grew up.</p>
<p>Hancock Prospecting, which reaped a profit of $7.3 billion last financial year, first wants to start developing “imminently” a smaller mine that would operate for up to five years.</p>
<p>The development of the mine was delayed when iron ore prices tumbled. About 900 hectares of land would be cleared to mine up to five million tonnes of iron ore annually.</p>

<div>‘Critical shortage’: Miners face talent crunch as metals demand fires up</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Mining companies are struggling to find workers to fill specialist roles from engineers to train drivers as COVID-19 travel restrictions between states and a collapse in skilled migration exacerbate the industry’s labour squeeze.</p>
<p>Top Australian miner BHP does not expect the problems to ease this year as continued investment in resources and construction collide with ongoing labour mobility restrictions.</p>
<p>“Like many, we are seeing constraints in labour availability and supply chain disruption across our Australian operations,” BHP head of Australian mining Edgar Basto said.</p>
<p>“We expect labour market tightness and competition for skills to increase in 2022.”</p>
<p>BHP told investors temporary rail labour shortages in WA had contributed to a 5 per cent drop in iron ore output in the September quarter, while lithium miner Pilbara Minerals was also facing project delays due to a labour shortage.</p>
<p>“There is a critical shortage in some occupations including mining engineers,” Ms Constable said. “It is positive to see various engineering occupations added to Australia’s priority skilled migration list.”</p>
<p>By mid-2023, WA’s mining and resources sector might need up to 40,000 more workers, according to modelling commissioned by the Chamber of Minerals and Energy WA.</p>
<blockquote><p>“We expect labour market tightness and competition for skills to increase in 2022.”</p><cite>BHP head of Australian mining Edgar Basto</cite></blockquote>
<p>The talent crunch could threaten Australian miners’ ability to meet significant future growth expected across the sector as rising urbanisation and the clean-energy revolution fuel enormous demand for raw materials.</p>
<p>Ms Constable said the most in-demand jobs across the sector were mining engineers, heavy-duty diesel fitters, electricians, geologists, electrical engineers and metallurgists.</p>
<p>“The commodities the Australian mining industry produces are essential for modern life and new technologies, and there is tremendous long-term career opportunities in the sector,” she said.</p>
<p>BHP said it was investing in a training academy to create 2500 new job-ready apprentices and trainees over the next five years, primarily in regional areas.</p>
<p>Mr Basto said both industry and government had a role to play in putting Australia in the best position to bounce back from COVID-19 “stronger, more resilient and ready to grasp new opportunities”.</p>
<p>Across the wider Australian economy, senior business leaders have cited workforce shortages as by far their biggest and most immediate worry as the battered labour market re-emerges from COVID-19 lockdowns.</p>
<p>Border closures over the past two years have been a strong factor in minimising the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, but have left businesses across the economy “urgently requiring additional people resources”.</p>

<div>Rio Tinto warns Omicron may hit top export iron ore as WA reopens</div>
<div><div><h5>By Nick Toscano</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 18, 2022 — 4.08pm</time></span><span>first published at <time>9.19am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Mining giant Rio Tinto has warned the threat of widespread Omicron infections and staff absenteeism once Western Australia opens its border to the rest of the country could worsen the state’s labour crunch and hit iron ore output.</p>
<p>Rio Tinto warned its target to increase iron ore output from WA in 2022 would be contingent on the impact of the spread of Omicron, the COVID-19 variant that has caused crippling workforce shortages in Australia and around the world.</p>
<p>Rio’s new chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, on Tuesday said operating conditions remained “challenging” including due to prolonged pandemic-related disruptions across its operations.</p>
<p>Analysts said Rio Tinto’s mine-capacity issues were likely to “weigh again in 2022” at the same time as the iron ore price came under pressure.</p>
<p>“Although iron ore prices have provided the shares some solace in recent weeks, we continue to see a challenging outlook for iron ore over the course of 2022,” Royal Bank of Canada analyst Kaan Peker said.</p>
<p>Iron ore, which steel-makers heat with coal at high temperatures to churn out liquid metal, is Australia’s biggest export, accounting for a record $150 billion in 2021.</p>
<p>However, the iron ore price fell sharply in the second half of the year as Beijing deepened cuts across its steel mills to reduce emissions from one of its worst-polluting industries and global supply began to pick up.</p>
<p>While China’s steel production rose again in December to its highest level since August and helped bring iron ore back above $US120 a tonne, investment bank UBS said it remained “cautious” on the commodity’s outlook.</p>
<div><p>“We expect demand to be weak and supply to lift in 2022,” UBS analyst Myles Allsop said.</p></div>

<div>‘Quite disempowering’: Crypto’s curious case of stolen identity</div>
<p>As the old adage goes, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. But for Power Ledger boss Jemma Green, it’s more like a frequent form of frustration.</p>
<p>Crypto executives, traders and personalities are constantly battling a stream of opportunistic scammers attempting to trick others into giving up their cash.</p>
<p>But, to the surprise of no one, upon sending the funds the victim receives nothing, with their money and the scammer disappearing into the digital back alleys of the crypto world.</p>
<p>“On my TikTok, there’s constantly some new Fred Schebesta that comes in and asks people to WhatsApp them about some new hot cryptocurrency project,” Finder boss Fred Schebesta (the real one) says.</p>
<p>“It looks like a scam, and it almost always is, but it’s very hard to stop the bots. It just constantly happens.”</p>
<blockquote><p>‘I don’t accept phone calls, I don’t click on emails, I don’t respond to text messages anymore.’</p><cite>Finder CEO Fred Schebesta</cite></blockquote>
<p>“I don’t accept phone calls, I don’t click on emails, I don’t respond to text messages anymore unless I know who you are,” he says.</p>
<p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) generally runs a tight ship when it comes to tracking down and alerting people to scams, with its ScamWatch division tracking 18,000 different scam reports in November alone.</p>
<p>“It is an awful lot of money to lose,” she says. “The whole investing theory of ‘don’t put all your eggs in one basket’ seems to go out the window when people get involved in crypto.”</p>
<p>Many of these scammers have since moved to more private services such as Telegram and Discord, where they can message potential victims one-on-one.</p>
<p>Similarly, a spokesperson for Meta - Facebook and Instagram’s parent company - said the business had a team dedicated to identifying and preventing these sorts of scams.</p>
<p>“While no enforcement is perfect, we continue to investigate new technologies and methods of stopping these scams and the people behind them,” they said.</p>
<p>“I really do think we’re seeing this mentality of people seeing everyone who made a fortune in the first boom,” she says. “So they really want to be in on the next best, big thing.”</p>
<div>NFTs and the trillion-dollar Bitcoin boom: The year cryptocurrency took off</div>
<p>It was the year cryptocurrency really hit the mainstream.</p>
<p>The value of Bitcoin hit $US1 trillion ($1.4 trillion) this year as interest in the cryptocurrency hit new heights. The market is now so large in Australia some surveys suggest more than one in ten Australians hold some form of the digital currency.</p>
<p>At the same time a range of new developments caught the imagination of the wider business sector, with startups working to expand the uses of the blockchain-based technology.</p>
<p>However, as new opportunities emerged the popularity of the asset class led to concerns about consumer protection and raised the spectre of regulation.</p>
<p>Here are the big crypto stories of the year:</p>
<p>Public interest in NFTs – or non-fungible tokens, a one-off original digital asset like an artwork or special-release music album that is created with the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies – soared in 2021.</p>
<p>An NFT by artist Beeple sold for $US70 million at an auction held by auction house Christies, while Twitter founder Jack Dorsey raked in $US2.9 million by selling his first-ever tweet as an NFT.</p>
<p>Even the Australian Financial Review got in on the action, raising 11.8888 Ether (worth $US56,667 at the time) in a charity auction of an NFT of its Young Rich magazine cover.</p>
<p>El Salvador became the first country in the world to accept Bitcoin as legal tender, meaning it could be exchanged for goods and services.</p>
<p>El Salvador has a large money remittance industry and a growing number of locals and nationals based abroad using cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Back home, the Commonwealth Bank became the first local bank to allow its customers to trade cryptocurrencies through its app, which is used by millions of Australians.</p>
<p>The corporate watchdog ASIC also gave the green light to a range of cryptocurrency-related ETFs, and an increasing number of fund managers and market watchers announced plans to pursue cryptocurrency-related investment products for their clients.</p>
<p>But there was a step backwards in the development of cryptocurrencies, with China banning the energy-intensive mining of the coins.</p>
<p>In December, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg revealed a set of sweeping regulatory changes aimed at improving oversight of the cryptocurrency sector and including new taxation treatments for digital assets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Australian banking sector got a warning from the transactions regulator Austrac and a Senate committee for its widespread policy of debanking customers - stopping to deal with customers - that ran cryptocurrency trading businesses.</p>
<h3>Regulators’ warnings</h3>
<p>Amid all the positive buzz, there were sage warnings from regulators about the dangers of this largely unregulated marketplace.</p>
<p>The ACCC said earlier this year that nearly half of all complaints to consumer hotline ScamWatch were about the digital assets.</p>
<p>And the new chair of the corporate watchdog, Joe Longo, told a business summit: “In my view consumers should approach investing in crypto with great caution”.</p>
<p>A key example of the risks of the unregulated cryptocurrency market was highlighted by the collapse of Australian-based exchange MyCryptoWallet in December.</p>

<div>Billionaires are embracing crypto in case ‘money goes to hell’</div>
<p>Thomas Peterffy took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal in 2017 warning of the dangers that bitcoin futures posed to capital markets.</p>
<p>He owns some himself, while his firm Interactive Brokers Group recently offered customers the ability to trade Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash, after detecting “urgency” from its clients to get in on the action.</p>
<p>Peterffy, 77, said Interactive Brokers will offer the ability to trade another five to 10 coins or so starting this month.</p>
<p>It’s possible that cryptocurrencies could reap extraordinary returns — even if the opposite is also true, Peterffy said.</p>
<p>“I think it can go to zero, and I think it can go to a million dollars,” he said in an interview. “I have no idea.”</p>
<p>His approach highlights the shifting attitude toward crypto by investors who once scorned or were wary of digital tokens but realised, especially in 2021, that they can’t bear to miss out on the potential for big gains.</p>
<p>Even as prices swung wildly, investors large and small dived into Bitcoin and Ethereum as well as non-fungible tokens, dog-themed assets and shitcoins, including the aptly-named $USASS Coin.</p>
<p>Crypto moved increasingly into the mainstream of finance, albeit with mixed success.</p>
<p>Faring better, Coinbase went public and now has a $US54 billion market valuation. Its founder, Brian Armstrong, is worth $US9.7 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p>
<p>“So much money is pouring into this space it would make no sense if crypto prices would go much below that,” Novogratz stated.</p>
<p>There’s still plenty of scepticism from Wall Street and the ultra-wealthy, but also pragmatism.</p>
<p>The bank’s clients are “adults”, Dimon has said.</p>

<p>Taking the musings of social media seriously was one of last year’s expensive lessons for sophisticated investors.</p>

<div>Bitcoin-at-$US100,000 calls become uncomfortable after pullback</div>
<p>Bitcoin’s getting a drubbing this week as the Federal Reserve readies a removal of stimulus, but bulls are feeling as emboldened as ever.</p>
<p>“Cryptocurrencies benefited from the Fed’s massive liquidity injections since 2020,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co. “It pushed these assets too far, too fast.”</p>
<p>In conjunction with riskier assets like US equities, Bitcoin and other digital assets tumbled Wednesday after minutes from a recent Fed meeting showed officials were willing to withdraw stimulus sooner than many had previously expected.</p>
<p>Still, that hasn’t stopped other industry participants such as Messari co-founder Ryan Selkis from poking fun at the basis of some of the sky-high predictions.</p>
<p>And earlier this week, Goldman Sachs analyst Zach Pandl wrote that Bitcoin could hit $US100,000 if it continues to take market share from gold.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Cryptocurrencies benefited from the Fed’s massive liquidity injections since 2020. It pushed these assets too far, too fast.”</p><cite>Matt Maley, chief market strategist for Miller Tabak + Co.</cite></blockquote>
<p>“Now that this stimulus is going to become less plentiful more quickly than the markets had been thinking, it makes sense that these assets are falling in tandem,” said Maley.</p>
<p>Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist at Ally, says investors were already jittery entering the year thanks to uncertainty over the Fed’s policy path.</p>
<p>Greg Bassuk, chief executive of AXS Investments, an asset-manager that focuses on alternative investments, says Bitcoin should comprise a portion of an investor’s portfolio.</p>
<div>Bitcoin diehards are about to find out if it really was a bubble</div>
<p>Both of those theories are about to face their biggest test yet.</p>
<p>It’s not looking good so far: Bitcoin is already down some 40 per cent from its highs, while No. 2 coin Ether and other “altcoins” have also suffered steep declines.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s been written off time and again as dead, denounced as rat’s poison, and castigated as a bubble only to come back stronger each time.</p></blockquote>
<p>“We shouldn’t discount that in the future Bitcoin use cases may evolve to where it reinvents itself and gains importance anew,” he said.</p>
<div>The world’s biggest crypto fortune began with a friendly poker game</div>

<p>The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix draws princes, movie stars and world-famous athletes every year to party on Yas Island, the entertainment hub about 30 minutes from the centre of downtown.</p>
<p>Binance’s success underscores the vast riches being created in the unshackled cryptoverse, even with recent declines, but controversy has swirled around the firm.</p>
<p>Binance’s future may hinge on whether it can reconcile with the world’s regulators and find a welcoming location to establish its headquarters.</p>
<p>For now, though, the money is pouring in.</p>
<p>“Coinbase might appear to be the 800-pound gorilla from a US perspective, but Binance is significantly bigger,” said DA Davidson Co. analyst Chris Brendler.</p>
<p>Zhao declined to comment for this story, and Binance disputed the accuracy of Bloomberg’s estimates of the firm’s market value and his net worth.</p>
<p>“Crypto is still in its growth stage,” Binance said in a statement. “It is susceptible to higher levels of volatility. Any number you hear one day will be different from a number you hear the next day.”</p>
<h3>‘I’m not an anarchist’</h3>
<p>In one recent 24-hour span, Binance completed $US170 billion of transactions. On a really slow day, he said, it’s about $US40 billion — and that’s up from as little as $US10 billion two years before that.</p>
<p>In the crypto world, these are gargantuan numbers. Binance routinely facilitates as much trading as the next four largest exchanges combined.</p>
<p>When Bloomberg’s Erik Schatzker asked the billionaire about his wealth during the November interview in Singapore, Zhao demurred. “I don’t care about wealth, money, rankings,” he said.</p>
<p>The slender crypto entrepreneur, donning rimless glasses and a slightly oversize striped tie, added that such matters are a distraction and that he’s prepared to give away almost all of his fortune before he dies.</p>
<p>Whether Zhao can hang on to what he’s gained remains to be seen, and he has plenty of reason to be concerned about his firm’s unbridled growth.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Binance said the company is “working with regulators around the world and we take our compliance obligations very seriously.”</p>
<p>Zhao has said he welcomes — and wants — regulation.</p>
<p>“I’m not an anarchist,” he said at the Bloomberg forum. “I don’t believe human civilisation is advanced enough to live in a world without rules.”</p>
<p>Fortunes built on crypto have ballooned along with the value of digital tokens, which totalled $US2.09 trillion on January 7, up from $US135 billion three years ago.</p>
<p>Exchanges such as Coinbase, Gemini, FTX and Kraken have attracted hefty valuations in public and private markets, and Binance’s popularity with users and myriad products may be even more enticing to investors.</p>
<p>And some businesses have run afoul of regulators. BitMex, once the world’s largest crypto-derivatives exchange, is a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>Binance’s revenue is realised across hundreds of crypto tokens, which the firm doesn’t convert to traditional currencies, Zhao told Bloomberg during the November interview.</p>
<p>“We just hold them,” he said. “If you calculate the number today, it’s one number, and 5 minutes later it’s a different number because every price is changing.”</p>
<p>Zhao, a Canadian citizen, was born in China’s Jiangsu province. His father, a university professor, was exiled to the countryside during the Cultural Revolution and, when CZ was 12, moved the family to Vancouver.</p>
<p>Exposed to technology at a young age, Zhao later studied computer science and eventually landed finance jobs in Tokyo and New York, including a four-year stint at Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News.</p>
<p>His road to crypto riches began in Shanghai in 2013 during a friendly poker game with Bobby Lee, then CEO of BTC China, and investor Ron Cao, who both encouraged him to put 10 per cent of his net worth into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Binance succeeded in creating “user stickiness,” in part by allowing clients to use Binance Coin to reduce trading fees, said Tim Swanson, head of market intelligence at Clearmatics, a London-based blockchain firm.</p>
<p>“They don’t even have to be the first to list a coin anymore for liquidity to aggregate there,” Swanson said of Binance.</p>
<p>Zhao’s firm is also the largest provider of derivatives trading by volume, letting users speculate on crypto with even more risk and potential reward.</p>
<p>Now Binance is trying to settle on a location, Zhao said during the November interview, adding that an announcement about the headquarters would be coming “in a very short period.”</p>
<p>Binance’s ability to operate just about anywhere has made it difficult for regulators to establish jurisdiction over the company.</p>
<p>“Their approach was, ‘We don’t need a regulator, we are decentralised,’” said Brendler, the DA Davidson analyst. “That worked really well for growing and scaling and product innovations.”</p>
<p>Binance has been filling senior posts with former employees of UAE regulators, and it signed an agreement with the Dubai World Trade Centre authority to help craft a crypto regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Not all of Binance’s efforts to ingratiate itself to regulators have gone smoothly.</p>
<p>“To raise capital, we believe that the company needs to show a path to settling on a global headquarters and consolidating operations,” said Robert Le, an analyst for Pitchbook.</p>
<p>If Binance pulls it off, it could make Zhao even richer than Elon Musk, currently the world’s wealthiest person, and No. 2 Jeff Bezos, whom Zhao said he admires.</p>
<p>“I don’t know him personally,” Zhao, speaking at the November Bloomberg event, said of the Amazon.com Inc. founder. “But I would love to be associated with him in the future.”</p>
<div>The strange alliance of crypto and MAGA believers</div>
<p>So what’s that about?</p>
<p>Still, it does seem important to understand the cultish aspects of the cryptocurrency movement.</p>
<p>First, however, a bit (ahem) about the economics.</p>
<p>Yet bitcoin and its rivals now have a combined market valuation of more than $1 trillion. What do investors think they’re buying?</p>
<p>But let’s leave market predictions aside and ask what’s with the deepening alliance between bitcoin and MAGA?</p>
<p>The point, then, is that while there are real economic issues associated with cryptocurrencies, their rise has a lot to do with the broader political madness that has American democracy on the brink.</p>

<div>Block debut opens the ASX gates for other crypto listings</div>
<p>When the newly merged Block/Afterpay debuts on the ASX on January 20 this year, the bourse will host its first significant cryptocurrency player, but the payments giant won’t be the last.</p>
<p>“We are moving on it, and our goal is to bring investment grade opportunities in various crypto asset classes to the ASX in the coming months and years,” Cunningham says.</p>
<p>“Our thinking on this is just to make sure that these assets have an appropriate level of maturity, and security for when they come to market.”</p>
<p>Significantly, Bitcoin is not a dirty word to the ASX, neither is speculation.</p>
<p>The main issue for the market operator is the security of the transaction and custody of the goods involved. Moving a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin is a very different proposition to moving a billion dollars worth of gold right now.</p>
<p>While it has borne the brunt of criticism, the ASX pointed to cordial relations with other crypto-related players, like Iris Energy, which was contemplating a listing on the ASX before opting for a Nasdaq listing last year.</p>
<p>Investors can get exposure to the crypto market right now, of course, via the Betashares Crypto Innovators ETF (exchange traded fund).</p>
<blockquote><p>I don’t think speculating on the currency is a bad thing, we’ve got that with gold we have that with oil futures, we have a range of those asset classes.</p><cite>ASX’s Max Cunningham</cite></blockquote>
<p>Cunningham hints that ETFs are a big focus. “We’re finalising what we think underlying Bitcoin, and other type crypto assets, will look like in the ETF space.”</p>
<p>Launched in November last year, Betashares Crypto Innovators ETF provides exposure to listed global companies in the crypto economy.</p>
<p>This includes crypto brokerage firm Coinbase, Bitcoin miners and other companies helping to build crypto infrastructure - the so-called picks and shovel providers to the crypto gold rush.</p>
<p>“It’s designed to capture the publicly traded companies around the world that build the infrastructure that allows the crypto economy to hum,” Bitwise Asset management’s Matt Hogan says. Hogan helped design the index fund.</p>
<p>The picks and shovels of the Bitcoin mining sector – the equivalent of investing in mining and mining equipment suppliers in the traditional economy – is a theme that the ASX embraces as it looks for crypto exposure for investors.</p>
<p>But the Block/Afterpay debut later this month will give investors immediate access to a group with a significant crypto business – it made $US1.8 billion in revenue from Bitcoin trading in its most recent quarterly result.</p>
<p>Block owns 8,000 Bitcoin and is developing a wallet for Bitcoin storage, a decentralised, open platform to exchange Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The question is, which companies will follow its lead?</p>
<p>The ASX is not naming any companies it is in talks with, but there are contenders out there which have completed recent rounds of funding with expectations of an IPO this year.</p>

<div>North Korean hackers stole over half a billion dollars in crypto in 2021: report</div>
<p>“From 2020 to 2021, the number of North Korean-linked hacks jumped from four to seven, and the value extracted from these hacks grew by 40 per cent,” said the report, which was released on Friday AEST.</p>
<p>“Once North Korea gained custody of the funds, they began a careful laundering process to cover up and cash out,” the report added.</p>
<p>North Korea does not respond to media inquiries, but has previously released statements denying allegations of hacking.</p>
<p>The attackers used phishing lures, code exploits, malware, and advanced social engineering to siphon funds out of these organisations’ internet-connected ‘hot’ wallets into North Korea-controlled addresses, the report said.</p>
<p>Many of last year’s attacks were likely carried out by the Lazarus Group, a hacking group sanctioned by the United States, which says it is controlled by the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea’s primary intelligence bureau.</p>
<p>The group has been accused of involvement in the “WannaCry” ransomware attacks, hacking of international banks and customer accounts, and the 2014 cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures Entertainment.</p>
<p>North Korea also appeared to step up efforts to launder stolen cryptocurrency, significantly increasing its use of mixers, or software tools that pool and scramble cryptocurrencies from thousands of addresses, Chainalysis said.</p>
<p>The report said researchers had identified $US170 million in old, unlaundered cryptocurrency holdings from 49 separate hacks spanning from 2017 to 2021.</p>
<p>The report said it is unclear why the hackers would still be sitting on these funds, but said they could be hoping to outwit law enforcement interest before cashing out.</p>
<p>“Whatever the reason may be, the length of time that (North Korea) is willing to hold on to these funds is illuminating, because it suggests a careful plan, not a desperate and hasty one,” Chainalysis concluded.</p>
<p>North Korea on Friday berated the Biden administration for imposing fresh sanctions against the country over its latest missile tests and warned of stronger and more explicit action if Washington maintains its “confrontational stance.”</p>
<p>In a statement carried by North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency, an unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesperson defended the North’s recent launches of purported hypersonic missiles as a righteous exercise of self-defence.</p>
