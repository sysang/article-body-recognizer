<h1> Liverpool face fixture pile-up chaos after League Cup semi-final with Arsenal is postponed after Covid outbreak </h1>
<p> The first leg of the Carabao Cup tie will now be played at Anfield on January 13 with the second leg at the Emirates a week later </p>
<div> <div> By Chris Bascombe and Sam Dean <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:59pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Liverpool face January fixture chaos after their plea to postpone the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final with Arsenal was granted on Wednesday due to the severity of the club’s Covid outbreak.</p>
<p>The repercussions for Jurgen Klopp’s side mean they now have five fixtures in a 15-day period, taking in both legs of their tie with Arsenal, two Premier League fixtures and the FA Cup third round.</p>
<p>Sunday’s meeting with Shrewsbury Town is expected to go ahead as planned despite Liverpool closing down their training ground until tomorrow amid rising cases.</p>
<p>Liverpool postponed tomorrow’s FA Youth Cup tie with Burnley because they anticipate that many of their academy players will now be required to step up to first-team duty against Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>The situation has rapidly deteriorated at Anfield over the past few days. Klopp has been in isolation since last Saturday when he tested positive ahead of the final training session before Liverpool played Chelsea.</p>
<p>Lijnders’ scheduled pre-match press conference ahead of the first leg was immediately postponed, and within an hour Liverpool announced the temporary shutdown of all first-team operations.</p>
<p>“The decision was made after consultation with the relevant public health authority,” read a club statement.</p>
<p>The flurry of new positive tests came after Liverpool had made their approach to the EFL, warning they would not have the players and staff to meet the necessary criteria for their semi-final, first leg.</p>
<p>With so many senior staff and players unavailable, the EFL board had no option but to rearrange the dates. It means Arsenal will have the advantage of playing the second leg at home.</p>
<p>There are repercussions for Arsenal, who also face five games in 15 days, although unlike Liverpool they do not have upcoming European commitments to consider.</p>
<p>The rescheduling of the match at the Emirates means that Arsenal’s derby with Tottenham Hotspur will now fall between the two semi-final legs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Arsenal have been charged by the Football Association for allegedly failing to ensure their players “conducted themselves in an orderly fashion” following a red card in their match against Manchester City last Saturday.</p>
<p>The club has until tomorrow to respond to the charge, which centres on the dismissal of Gabriel Magalhaes in the 59th minute of City’s 2-1 victory at the Emirates, although it is understood they will not be appealing.</p>
<p>Gabriel was shown a second yellow card for a foul on City forward Gabriel Jesus, just a few minutes after he had been booked for dissent in the aftermath of a penalty scored by Riyad Mahrez.</p>
<p>The Brazilian, and a number of his Arsenal team-mates, reacted furiously to the decision and immediately surrounded referee Stuart Attwell.</p>
<p>Arsenal have been charged with a breach of FA Rule E20.1. Crystal Palace and Aston Villa were both fined earlier this season for breaching the same rule, with Palace fined £45,000 for two breaches and Villa fined £20,000 for one breach.</p>

<header> <h1> The best secateurs for pruning your garden </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Madeleine Howell <time> 4 January 2022 • 10:27am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Novice gardeners and experienced horticulturalists are united in their requirement of a good pair of secateurs (otherwise known as pruning shears) with a steel blade.</p>
<p>Swiss brand Felco (which is very good) is the most widely used here in the UK (the Felco 2 secateurs are a design classic, which have been in production for 70 years and come with a lifetime guarantee – more on which below).</p>
<a>Niwaki: Pruning, Training and Shaping Trees the Japanese Way</a>) – that he discovered the benefits of Japanese tools (not only are
<a>Japanese chef’s knives</a> superior, but it would seem we also have something to learn from their gardening tools).
<p>Lerigo devoutly describes his chosen make of Japanese secateurs, Okatsune, as a bit of kit that Marie Kondo would approve of: simple, effective, and capable of sparking joy, time and time again.</p>
<p>Here, we present our pick of the very best secateurs and pruning shears, tried and tested...</p>
<p><a>£49.70, Amazon</a></p>
<p>Why we like them: sharp, Rockwell scale approved carbon steel and "life-changing" functional design </p>
<a> Bunny Guinness</a> has described them as “life-changing, so sharp, so well made – they have done me prouder than any other make I have owned.”
<a>scentless camellia oil</a>), and store with blades closed to protect the blades (and you).
<p>For the purposes of comparison, like the Felco No.2’s, they have a maximum cutting diameter of 25mm.</p>
<h3>2. Niwaki GR Pro secateurs</h3>
<p>Why we like them: these secateurs are so appealing they're practically an objet d'art</p>
<p>Known to Hobson affectionately as his “double yellows”, the bright yellow <a>Niwaki GR Pro secateurs </a>are made with KA70 carbon steel, they’re a 23cm long pair of whoppers, weighing 239g.</p>
<p>See also: our guide to the <a>best hedge trimmers</a> available to buy</p>
<p><a>£46.59, Amazon</a></p>
<p>Why we like them: a signature postbox-red design classic with a lifetime guarantee</p>
<p>The sharp blade of these Felco 2’s (first manufactured in 1948) proved well-suited to the most unruly of shrubs and the thickest of tough branches, but also the most delicate of stems and plants with thinner stems in need of deadheading.</p>
<p><a>£46.55, Amazon</a></p>
<p>The cut is clean and effortless: however, the stainless steel blade has a cutting capacity of diameters of 20 mm – less than the Felco and Okatsune secateurs featured here.</p>
<h3>5. Sophie Conran secateurs</h3>
<p><a>£29.95, Harrods Horticultural</a></p>
<h3>6. Wilkinson Sword RazorCut Comfort Bypass Pruner</h3>
<p><a>£16.50, Amazon</a></p>
<p>However, while they promise the standard 20mm cutting capacity I’ve come to expect from many brands, the reality is more like 15mm. Fine for a cheap pair of secateurs, but not a product that's likely to last you a lifetime.</p>
<h3>How do I care for the blades of my secateurs?</h3>
<p>Do not twist or apply uneven pressure: try to cut branches diagonally, not straight across. Blades may chip or crack through misuse and bad luck, although damage can be ground out with a file.</p>
<h3>What do I do if the blades of my secateurs jam and the stems get caught between them?</h3>
<a>gardening expert Helen Yemm</a>, secateurs usually jam because of a build-up of dried sap and general garden grot on the blades. A good clean, followed by a wipe with an oily rag, sorts the problem out. Presumably you have tried that.

<header> <h1> The best dehumidifiers to keep damp and mould at bay </h1> <p> A dehumidifier could be the solution to keep your home free from damp and mould this winter </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 4 January 2022 • 1:50pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>There are two main types of dehumidifier: refrigerant and desiccant. A refrigerant dehumidifier filters in air which then hits cold coils within the machine. The water condenses and drips into a tank, to be emptied when full. </p>
<p>Still, if you’ve noticed any of the following, it might be time to consider a dehumidifier:</p>
<li>Mould on walls, especially ceilings or corners. These can spread and become toxic, with repercussions for those with respiratory problems.</li>
<li>Musty smells and mildew.</li>
<li>Condensation. If your windows regularly become wet during winter, your room might be too humid.</li>
<li>Water damage. It could be a leak, or it could be a problem with ventilation.</li>
<a>hygrometer</a> (often built in, otherwise you can buy one separately). As dehumidifiers capture water, you’ll have to regularly pour out the contents. 
<p>Some other things to note:</p>
<p>You can vacuum your room before use, to prevent spreading dust around the dehumidifier thus clogging up the filter. You should also vacuum the filter regularly to stop it blocking up. </p>
<p>Keep the device positioned away from walls, furniture or curtains. This is tricky, as dehumidifiers can be quite ugly, so you’ll want to tuck them in a corner, but it helps it to work more efficiently. </p>
<p>Here are the best dehumidifiers currently on the market. </p>
<h2>The best dehumidifiers for 2021</h2>
<h2>1. Meaco 20l low energy refrigerant dehumidifier </h2>
<p>Why we like it: Low energy and high capacity </p>
<p><a>£238.95, Aircon Centre</a></p>
<a>Demi Stanley of Fantastic Services</a>. Stanley praises this low-energy model's ability to pull away moisture from the air highly efficiently over large spaces. Patrick Houghton, of
<p>At over £200 it's not the cheapest of models, but its lower levels of energy usage may save you in the long run. It comes with a built-in <a>air purifier</a>, an added bonus, so your environment will not only be less humid, but cleaner too. </p>
<p>This British company's dehumidifier is about as good as it gets, and it comes with a three year warranty.</p>
<h2>2. Honeywell 12L TP Compact Energy Star Compressor Dehumidifier with Dust Filter</h2>
<p>Why we like it: As good-looking as dehumidifiers get</p>
<p><a>£138.95, Aircon Centre</a></p>
<h3>3. EcoAir DD1 MK5 classic desiccant dehumidifier </h3>
<p><a>£179.94, Amazon</a></p>
<p>It's worth noting the dehumidifier has recently been renamed as the DD1 Classic Mk5, but you're more likely to see it listed as the DD122 FW online. </p>
<h3>4. Ebac 3850e 21 litre refrigerant dehumidifier </h3>
<p><a>£315, Amazon</a></p>
<h3>5. Pro Breeze 500ml compact and portable mini air dehumidifier </h3>
<p><a>£39.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>The 500ml tank, the size of your average water bottle, means it will require regular emptying. On top of that, it's very quiet.</p>

<h3>20 fabulous family holidays for 2022</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>The future is looking bright for family holidays abroad this summer, with several travel testing requirements eased today. So here is our pick of the best breaks for 2022. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>'Travel will be 90% back to 2019 levels before the end of spring'</h3>
<p>Derek Jones, CEO of travel firm Kuoni, is confident that holidaymakers are over the worst.</p>
<h3>'This should represent the end of futile travel measures'</h3>
<p>Steve Heapy, CEO of Jet2.com and Jet2holidays, said demand for its trips was already on the rise. He added:</p>
<h3>'I'm not sure the Government actually knows why it is retaining the arrival test'</h3>
<p>Danny Callaghan, CEO of the Latin American Travel Association, has joined calls for an end to all travel testing. He said:</p>
<h3>Surge in demand for holidays expected</h3>
<p>Flight search giant Skyscanner believes a surge in demand for overseas trips is certain to follow today's easing of travel restrictions. </p>
<p>She added that in September 2021, when UK arrivals testing restrictions were eased, Skyscanner saw an immediate 133% spike in visits to the site in the hour following the announcement (compared with the previous day).</p>
<h3>'The best news we could have hoped for'</h3>
<p>Despite some holiday companies damning the Government with faint praise, Telegraph Travel's Nick Trend believes we should ultimately be pleased by today's announcement. </p>
<p>Read the rest of his analysis. </p>
<h3>Travel boss welcomes today's news</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, has tweeted about the potential end of Day 2 PCR tests for fully vaccinated travellers. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>'It's time to remove testing entirely for vaccinated travellers'</h3>
<p>Willie Walsh, director general of aviation association IATA, has urged the Government to press ahead with the lifting even more restrictions on travellers.</p>
<h3>A two-year timeline of Britain’s chaotic travel rules</h3>
<h3>Virgin Atlantic welcomes return to pre-omicron testing regime</h3>
<p>Shai Weiss, CEO of Virgin Atlantic, has welcomed the easing of restrictions ahead of the key January holiday booking window.</p>
<h3>How the changes were announced</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Grant Shapps likes using Twitter (and emojis) to deliver important changes to national policy. Today was no different. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Easing of travel rules 'marks an important step towards learning to live alongside the virus'</h3>
<p>Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, the industry body representing UK-registered carriers, said today's travel update is "a hugely welcome move at a critical time in the booking season for passengers".</p>
<p>"Today marks an important step towards learning to live alongside the virus, helping passengers and the travel sector look ahead to what will be an all-important spring and summer season."</p>
<h3>What are the new travel rules?</h3>
<p>From 4am on January 7, fully vaccinated travellers (and children aged 5 or over, children aged 4 and under are exempt) will: </p>
<ul> <li>No longer need to take a pre-departure test for return to England</li> <li>Can take a lateral flow test, rather than a costlier PCR, on or before Day 2</li> <li>Will NOT be required to self-isolate until they receive their test result</li> </ul>
<h3>Stricter travel rules caused 'unnecessary damage to the whole sector'</h3>
<p>Clive Wratten, chief executive of the Business Travel Association, said:</p>
<h3>'We must start to see a consistent approach' to travel rules</h3>
<p>Julia Lo Bue-Said, CEO at Advantage Travel Partnership, said of today's announcement:</p>
<h3>Confirmed: UK eases testing regime for travellers</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson has scrapped the travel testing regime introduced to combat the Omicron variant.</p>
<p>In a statement to MPs, the Prime Minister said that fully vaccinated travellers entering England will no longer have to take pre-departure tests from 4am on Friday.</p>
<p>He said that PCR tests, currently required on or before day two of a traveller’s arrival in the UK, will also be ditched and replaced by lateral flow tests, which are up to £60 cheaper per person.</p>
<p>Passengers will also no longer have to self isolate until they get a negative test result. However, if they test positive with a lateral flow, they will be required to take a PCR swab and self isolate for up to 10 days.</p>
