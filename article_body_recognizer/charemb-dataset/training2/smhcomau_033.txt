<p>Doing it then gave her the opportunity to ascend the ranks; she’s now the general manager of fundraising and marketing at Mission Australia.</p>
<p>“I took a step back professionally, but it gave me some amazing opportunities like visiting the slums in Mumbai and the Philippines,” she says.</p>
<p>One thing she wishes she’d done is stop more. “To be present,” she says, “and grateful for my privilege.”</p>
<p>Michelle McLean from Melbourne is 40 and swapped her marketing job in her late 30s to retrain as a clinical myotherapist. It ushered big changes for her.</p>
<p>“I went from a job I hated with every inch of my soul to an industry I was born to work in,” she says. “I lost 25 kilograms in my 39th year and did more spiritual work on myself.”</p>
<p>There was a trade-off though. “I’d like to have travelled more but I was a poor student and improved my life in so many ways that travel just wasn’t up there in the priorities,” she says.</p>
<p>One thing he discovered in his 30s compensates: volunteering. “I co-founded Lifesavers with Pride to bring more gay people into the lifesaving movement, first at North Bondi, then nationwide,” he says.</p>

<h1>How do we age and can we ‘delay’ it?</h1>
<h2>When we glance in a mirror, we can be taken aback – how did we get to this age? Yet the process starts before we are born. What happens in our bodies over time? And how can we embrace our later years?</h2>
<div><h5>By Sophie Aubrey</h5><time>January 16, 2022</time></div>
<p>It’s a fact that many of us don’t want to face: with every tick of the clock, every one of us is ageing. It feels scary. But it needn’t.</p>
<p>“Being human and living our lives is all about change, and that’s what ageing is, it’s change over time,” says Professor Julie Byles, a social gerontologist and researcher at Newcastle University.</p>
<p>Ageing is intrinsic to the living species on this planet but how we grow old, and the factors that influence the process, are complex and unpredictable. </p>
<p>“Ageing is universal but not uniform: it’s universal because it happens in all cells and all species, but it’s not uniform in that we don’t all go through it in the same way,” Professor Byles says.</p>
<p>Australia has one of the highest life expectancies, ranking ninth among OECD countries behind Switzerland, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Japan, Sweden, Israel and Spain.</p>
<p>As the World Health Organisation says, with good health a longer life brings opportunities: to pursue new activities, a long-neglected passion or even a fresh career.</p>
<p>Can we slow ageing? How does it happen? And how can ageism be a form of self-sabotage?</p>
<h3>How do we typically age?</h3>
<p>While most people don’t start feeling the effects until at least their 30s, the seeds of ageing start when we do.</p>
<p>Ageing is not programmed, though. As we move through the world, we suffer little bits of damage – it could be from sunlight, bacteria, a sprained ankle, a shonky DNA copy, bad food – that the body then works to repair.</p>
<p>“It’s happening throughout every second of our existence,” says Flicker.</p>
<p>But over time our physiological reserves drop, so we’re left accumulating damage that our body gradually can’t keep up with fixing – and this can manifest in all sorts of ways.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The thing about ageing is it’s affecting every system of the body and different parts get impacted differently. No two 80-year-olds will be the same.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The changes we experience as we age are neither linear nor consistent, and there is an extraordinary level of variability among older people.</p>
<p>Then there are the changes we often notice from our 40s, says Lange: skin loses elasticity; hair turns grey as pigment cells in our follicles slowly die; we become long-sighted as the lenses of our eyes stiffen; in some people, hearing dulls.</p>
<p>“If you’re frail,” says Gregorevic, “your body is already working so hard at the best of times just to get through daily life. So, when you get a cold it takes all your energy.”</p>
<p>But it’s not all bad news.</p>
<h3>Does ageing necessarily involve disease?</h3>
<h3>What difference does the life you’ve led make to ageing?</h3>
<p>There’s a cheeky saying in gerontology, says Byles: “If you want to age well, pick your parents.”</p>
<p>Being born with as few DNA errors as possible gives you a good headstart in life; aspects such as a good education, financial security and access to nutritious food in childhood add to your stocks.</p>
<p>A quarter of how we age is determined by genetics, according to the World Health Organisation, and the rest comes down to lifestyle and socioeconomic factors.</p>
<p>COVID-19 lockdowns, which limited exercise and socialising, have underlined just how important lifestyle is in ageing. Lange says the months in lockdown in Victoria had devastating impacts on physical and cognitive function for older people. </p>
<p>There are other factors outside our control.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Being brought up in poor housing, abject poverty, poor nutrition, a whole range of other things; all of that has contributed to our elders having chronic health conditions today.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The life expectancy of Indigenous Australians is about eight years less than for non-Indigenous Australians.</p>
<p>Aunty Geraldine Atkinson, a Bangerang woman and co-chair of the First Peoples’ Assembly of Victoria, says more must be done to support healthy ageing in Aboriginal communities.</p>
<p>“Being brought up in poor housing, abject poverty, poor nutrition, a whole range of other things; all of that has contributed to our elders having chronic health conditions today,” she says.</p>
<h3>So, can we ‘delay’ ageing?</h3>
<p>Still, any geriatrician will tell you a balanced diet and regular exercise are key to supporting healthy ageing and, in turn, a longer life. Stimulating your mind also helps minimise disease risk, Gregorevic says.</p>
<blockquote><p>“At every age, I change my behaviour so that I can do the best I can with the physiological systems I have. And I don’t look for immortality.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Lazarus encourages people to first accept they are going to get old, and then change their lifestyle – to truly enjoy the journey of ageing and retain their independence.</p>
<p>“At every age, I change my behaviour so that I can do the best I can with the physiological systems I have. And I don’t look for immortality,” he says.</p>
<p>A comprehensive study in 2015 found 26 common illnesses could be positively affected by exercise, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, dementia, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and some cancers.</p>
<p>“The most effective anti-ageing option we have is exercise,” Lange says. “It produces beneficial effects for pretty much everything we’ve ever looked at.”</p>
<h3>Why does ageism matter?</h3>
<p>Byles adds: “I have a theory that everyone thinks they’re 30. You have a concept of yourself, so we always think we’re younger, which is great. But then we can get a shock.”</p>
<p>She believes part of this is our own ageism, where we value our youth as more relevant. Indeed, we live in a culture that glorifies youth.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The acceptance of poorer service provision in aged care reflects an undervaluing of the worth of older people.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And a World Health Organisation global survey of more than 83,000 people found that one in two had ageist attitudes.</p>
<p>One of the great tragedies of ageism is that people internalise it and develop a negative bias against their older selves, Gregorevic says.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s really important not to categorise everybody older than 65 as old ... There’s nothing magical about this age. It doesn’t mean people are all of a sudden decrepit.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Not all Australian communities suffer from ageism.</p>
<p>In Aboriginal culture, an elder is someone recognised for their knowledge and ongoing contribution to their community, and they are not neglected. They are traditionally referred to as “Aunty” or “Uncle”.</p>
<p>It’s different in other countries, too.</p>
<p>“When you’re in Beijing and you go for a walk to parks, they’re full of older people doing tai chi, dancing. There’s no sense that, I’m too old to do that,” Byles says.</p>
<p>Byles, who helped create the anti-ageism Every Age Counts campaign, says people could be enjoying life more as they age.</p>
<p>“Ageing is a great individual and societal success. We should be embracing it,” she says.</p>
<h3>What do you gain as you age?</h3>
<p>The fact is we do typically become happier as we age, with research showing older people tend to have brighter moods and fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety than younger counterparts.</p>
<blockquote><p>“You use your brain to solve problems throughout your life ... [and] each time you learn a new strategy you can apply it to other problems, and that’s wisdom.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Plus, she says, we often care less about what other people think, which can be really liberating. And there is a sense of contentedness that comes from understanding, with time, where you and the puzzle pieces of your life fit.</p>
<p>People keep improving their vocabulary well into their 60s and 70s. And while brain speed and working memory peak in early life, this doesn’t make 20-year-olds equipped mentally to run the country.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her own life, Rosenman considers herself to have become more patient and tolerant, and she enjoys having more time.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Ageing is a great individual and societal success. We should be embracing it.”</p></blockquote>
<h3>How do you deal with the fear of nearing the end of your life?</h3>
<p>But, Lange says, most people reach a point where they no longer fear dying.</p>
<p> “People usually accept it will come ... which is quite freeing.”</p>
<p>Lange encourages people to focus on ageing well rather than fixating on the idea that getting older means they’re approaching death – which is only one moment at the very end of a life journey.</p>
<p>Flicker agrees: “I think people eventually realise that if you’re not dead yet then maybe life is to be lived, and ... really you should try to enjoy the living as much as you can, no matter what is happening at the time.”</p>
<p>“We need to remember that life is finite and, in a way, that that’s a real gift.”</p>
<p>Like all of us, Lazarus feels taken aback when he sees his older face in the mirror but says there isn’t any age that he wishes to be frozen in.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure where I put myself. I see this old man and I see myself, but ... do I wish I were 20 again? Not really,” he says. “I can’t place myself in any decade because I’ve really enjoyed myself.”</p>

<div>The new breed of fashion influencer selling houses and style</div>
<p>That energy has helped Rubinstein, 32, achieve enough spectacular sales to keep his wardrobe packed with more than 200 suits, designer watches, pristine Nike Air Force 1 sneakers and Tom Ford ties.</p>
<p>“I have been approached multiple times by a bunch of brands and I’m currently working on an ambassador deal with Patrick Johnson,” Rubinstein said.</p>
<p>While many female agents continue clinging to a style of fitted dresses and red-soled heels borrowed from newsreaders, men are using an adventurous approach to attract buyers, sellers and followers.</p>
<p>“Sydney is more showy with its hectic suits,” Fox says. “It’s a little more Los Angeles and Melbourne is probably closer to New York in its approach.”</p>
<p>Baya Ou Yang, senior account manager at fashion content agency Milkbar Digital, says that real estate agents are prime candidates to work with fashion brands.</p>
<p>“More fashion brands are looking to align themselves in non-fashion spaces,” Ou Yang said.</p>
<p>For Rubinstein, interest in his immaculate dress sense is just another bonus that he won’t miss, should fashion opportunities like the ambassador role with P Johnson fail to eventuate.</p>
<p>“I’ve already sold his houses, so that’s the perfect deal.”</p>

<p>What was your first fashion moment?When I was eight years old, I saved up my money before a trip to the UK and spent it all on a pair of silver Dr Martens boots.</p>
<p>Is there something you’d never wear? Athleisure when I’m not exercising.</p>
<p>Is there a current trend you like?I’m loving getting away from a slimmer aesthetic, the push towards looser-cut clothing in streetwear and technical clothing, like hiking wear.</p>
<p>What shoes do you wear the most?Loafers and plain plimsolls – vulcanised rubber sandshoes I buy from Japan.</p>
<p>Who’s your favourite fashion icon?Gianni Agnelli had incredible style: understated, elegant and timeless.</p>

<div>Why artist Benja Harney will try any style</div>
<p>How would you describe your style?Japanese hiker goes to the outback via Udaipur. It’s colourful, eclectic, and influenced by my travels.</p>
<p>What are the three essential items in your wardrobe? Shorts: I have so many pairs it’s bonkers. A hat with a wide brim, like a cricket hat. And a necklace, mostly beautiful, brightly coloured African Heishi beads.</p>
<p>What is the oldest thing in your wardrobe?My grandfather’s pocket watch.</p>
<p>And the most recent addition?I’m learning to sew and pattern-make and bought some coral-coloured linen fabric to make my own samue – a Japanese-style monk’s jacket.</p>
<p>What’s your favourite fashion era?2100. I can’t wait to see what I’ll be wearing in the future.</p>
<p>Who’s your favourite designer?Issey Miyake for the way he approaches the fabric, the pleating, that technical approach to fashion. His clothes are quite challenging to wear; you’ve got to make sure you wear them and not they you.</p>
<p>Where do you shop?I try to get to Japan every year, so I wait to buy my clothes in Tokyo. A few of the brands I’m into are Montbell, Narifuri, Beams and United Arrows.</p>
<p>Do you have a favourite fragrance?Acqua di Parma Colonia is so chic, Ralph Lauren Polo is classic and retro, and I love Monocle’s Hinoki.</p>
<p>And your worst fashion mistake?Once, after I broke up with an ex, I stopped wearing my colourful clothing and started being really drab. I thought it would help me on the dating scene if I toned it down; that was a mistake.</p>
<p>What was your first fashion moment?My sense of personal identity crystallised when I was 18 or 19 – the Britpop vibe and raving. The Face magazine was my style bible.</p>
<p>What are you coveting? A piece of flashy custom bling; I’d like to have a chunky brushed-gold and lapis statement ring made by a local jeweller.</p>
<p>Is there anything you’d never wear? No. I’d give anything a crack. Fashion’s experimental, it’s meant to be fun.</p>
<p>What shoes do you wear the most?I’m a shoe guy. “Spare no expense on shoes and sunglasses” is one of my mottos. Lately, I’m wearing Sebagos, a boat shoe with a fashion edge. And I love a loafer – Gucci, Prada, Lanvin.</p>
<p>What do you wear to bed? Not much.</p>
<p>Do you have style muse? Gandhi, or a samurai.</p>
<p>What do you wear when you work?When I’m in my studio working on paper projects I tend towards sturdy workwear: RB Sellars shirts, Stan Ray painter pants and Blundstones.</p>
<p>What’s your favourite casual Sunday look?I’m a keen hiker; I’ll be walking in Selewa mountain trainers, a pair of brightly coloured utilitarian shorts, a wide-brimmed hat and a little jacket to keep the rain off.</p>

<p>Merlin is based on the equally eccentric novelist and composer Lord Berners who lived at the Palladian marvel Faringdon House with his lover, his lover’s wife and a flock of dyed pink pigeons.</p>
<p>Adding more style to the spirit of Lord Berners, costume designer Sinead Kidao injected a touch of Cecil Beaton, after seeing an image of the photographer in the ’30s wearing tiny cotton shorts.</p>
<p>“I suggested copying Beaton’s look for Andrew Scott as Lord Merlin, and I’m fairly sure that’s what got me the job,” Kidao told BritishVogue.</p>
<p>The weave of the shirt and its relaxed fit sets it apart from bland corporate polos with popped colours. Knitted polos have enough formality to see you through a catered picnic lunch, while offering the comfort of a regular T-shirt.</p>
<p>Melbourne menswear designer Christian Kimber has nailed the heritage look with a forgiving, slightly oversized fit.</p>
<h3>High-waisted, baggy trousers</h3>
<p>By now you would have noticed that trousers have been expanding beyond calf-hugging styles towards a more relaxed silhouette.</p>
<p>There are two great advantages to these higher waisted styles: your shirt will not become untucked when you rakishly lift a gently tanned arm to sweep your fingers through your hair; there’s much greater air circulation on humid days.</p>
<p>“Generous cuts in trousers give their wearer a carefree look,” said P Johnson head tailor Tom Riley. “It’s a refreshing attitude after a few decades of very slim trousers which frankly only flatter a small few of us.”</p>
<p>Look for light linen and cottons and pay attention to underwear, if that’s your preference. Nude and cream tones work best beneath white, rather than anything with a South Park print.</p>

<div>Inside the eclectic wardrobe of one Australian perfumier</div>
<p>How would you describe your personal style? Nonchalant with a dash of eclectic flair. I’m into classics and being comfortable; I certainly don’t follow trends.</p>
<p>What are three essential items in your wardrobe?Levi’s jeans, a white T-shirt and Riviera shoes: they’re French slip-on loafers that come in amazing colours and retro designs. I have more than a dozen pairs.</p>
<p>What’s the oldest thing in your wardrobe?A cedar wood beaded necklace I bought from an antiques dealer in Istanbul.</p>
<p>And the most recent addition?A pair of US Rubber Company sneakers: canvas with a black vulcanised sole.</p>
<p>What’s your favourite fashion era?The ’80s. Jeans, T-shirts with a pop of fluoro, straw hats; Wham’s Club Tropicana would be my ideal, basically.</p>
<p>And your worst fashion mistake?In the ’80s I wore a vintage brown, cream and orange striped knit shirt with brown check pants to a nightclub and discovered the meaning of polyester; I was itchy, scratchy and sweaty all night.</p>
<p>What’s at the top of your current wishlist?A Jérôme Dreyfuss bag from the Paris store – I’d love to go back.</p>
<p>Is there something you would never wear? Meggings.</p>
<p>What shoes do you wear most often?Rivieras, huaraches and sneakers. I love Spanish brand El Ganso for the pop of colour and cool stripes.</p>
<p>What’s your favourite off-duty, casual Sunday look? During the warmer months it’s a pair of Orlebar Brown shorts with a terry towelling shirt and some sandals. That’s me.</p>

<div>Virgil Abloh shocked the system – fashion was only part of it</div>
<p>“What is diversity?” Abloh once asked a visitor to Vuitton headquarters in Paris just hours before one of his menswear presentations.</p>
<p>The answer was everywhere you looked. Since Abloh’s arrival at the label, Vuitton’s drab corporate offices on the Right Bank had been transformed into something more closely resembling a communal gathering space.</p>
<p>“I want all this to mean something,” he said then, words that echoed something he had told this reporter just months before he was officially named to his post at Louis Vuitton.</p>
<p>“Me being here, in this space is about so much more than just making stuff that’s cool because it’s luxury,” Abloh said.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Me being here, in this space is about so much more than just making stuff that’s cool because it’s luxury.”</p></blockquote>

<div>The long and short of the best Australian swimsuits for men</div>
<p>Three Australian labels are doing their best to elevate men’s swimsuit game to levels that stretch beyond public acceptability to admiration.</p>
<p>The Goldilocks principle applies to men’s swim shorts. Too long, and you’re ready for the basketball court instead of the beach. Too short and in a cold breeze vulnerable parts will feel colder than porridge.</p>
<p>“Length is important,” said Jac + Jack co-founder Jacqueline Hunt without the slightest wink nor nudge. “It’s a bit more of a grown-up concept. We wanted a shorter short that had great, classic, stylish appeal.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“It’s a bit more of a grown-up concept. We wanted a shorter short that had great, classic, stylish appeal.”</p><cite>Jacqueline Hunt, Jac + Jack co-founder</cite></blockquote>
<p>“There have been years of research,” Hunt said. “We wanted to launch with recycled nylon but they ended up being very sheer. Dangerously sheer. In the end we found a Japanese nylon with a super soft sensibility and ease.”</p>
<p>The short shorts are big on detail, with mesh lining and a hidden key loop in the back pocket and subtle logo.</p>
<p>Smith expanded his skill set from banking to men’s swimwear four years ago and has seasonally refined the classic brief style, which is sexy without having to sacrifice modesty or resort to gimmicky details.</p>
<p>“When I started I was using myself as a fit model and I soon realised that it really didn’t work for the variety of body shapes out there. With some modifications, we now have a style that is less cheeky, intentionally.”</p>
<p>Smithers, currently only available online, is about to make the leap into the wholesale market after finding success in the American market.</p>
<p>“Customers there favour solid colours and tend to be more conservative. Men here are more adventurous and playful. Once again, thank you Budgy Smuggler for paving the way.”</p>
<p>“Men want to feel the joy of wearing prints and being out and about,” Franks said.</p>
<p>Franks has always included styles for extroverted men in her collections but with the stronger style exchange between gendered styles in international fashion, they are being embraced with greater enthusiasm by male fans.</p>
<p>“We have more than doubled the breadth of our menswear offering due to incredible international demand for the category. Our matching shirts and board shorts have long been at the heart of our offering.”</p>
