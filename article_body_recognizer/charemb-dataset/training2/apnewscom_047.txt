<p>“Some say the world will end in fire,” wrote the poet Robert Frost -- and for much of 2021, Associated Press photographers captured scenes of a world ablaze, amid rumblings of ruin.</p>
<p>And at La Palma in the Canary Islands, the inferno is in the Cumbre Vieja volcano. But more than 10,000 million cubic meters of ash turn the world into a negative, with black ash taking the place of white snow.</p>

<p>Those men on horseback in 10-gallon hats are not the cowboys of classic Westerns; they’re border agents, corralling Haitian migrants as they try to cross the Rio Grande into the United States.</p>
<p>And the man and woman caught in a passionate embrace in Barcelona, Spain, are not characters in a romantic comedy; behind them, a riot rages over the imprisonment of a rapper convicted of insulting the Spanish monarchy. And the streets are on fire.</p>

<p>A total of 8,587 new cases were confirmed in the past 24 hours in Croatia, which presents a 50% rise since last week, Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said during a government session.</p>
<p>“The numbers show that omicron is spreading, we know it is a highly contagious variant that is present here,” he said. ”This is a warning how important it is to use everything at our disposal for protection from coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Plenkovic said authorities will monitor the situation and discuss possible tightening of rules in the coming days. He said about 63% of adults in the population of 4.2 million people have been fully vaccinated so far. </p>

<div><div><h1>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h1></div><div>By CARLA K. JOHNSONJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The explosive increase in U.S. coronavirus case counts is raising alarm, but some experts believe the focus should instead be on COVID-19 hospital admissions. And those aren’t climbing as fast.</p>
<p>Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr, director of ICAP, a global health center at Columbia University, said the case count does not appear to be the most important number now.</p>
<p>Instead, she said, the U.S. at this stage of the pandemic should be “shifting our focus, especially in an era of vaccination, to really focus on preventing illness, disability and death, and therefore counting those.”</p>
<p>Daily case counts and their ups and downs have been one of the most closely watched barometers during the outbreak and have been a reliable early warning sign of severe disease and death in previous coronavirus waves.</p>
<p>But they have long been considered an imperfect measure, in part because they consist primarily of laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19, not the actual number of infections out there, which is almost certainly many times higher.</p>
<p>Now, the value of the daily case count is being called into question as never before. </p>
<p>For one thing, the skyrocketing increase reflects, at least in part, an omicron-induced stampede among many Americans to get tested before holiday gatherings, and new testing requirements at workplaces and at restaurants, theaters and other sites.</p>
<p>But also, case numbers seem to yield a less useful picture of the pandemic amid the spread of omicron, which is causing lots of infections but so far does not appear to be as severe in its effects.</p>
<p>Case counts have lost relevance, said Andrew Noymer, a public health professor at the University of California, Irvine.</p>
<p>“Hospitalizations are where the rubber meets the road,” Noymer said. “It’s a more objective measure.” He added: “If I had to choose one metric, I would choose the hospitalization data.”</p>
<p>Even hospital numbers aren’t a perfect reflection of disease severity because they include patients admitted for other health problems who happen to test positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Still, health experts are not prepared to do away with case counts. </p>
<p>“We should not abandon looking at case numbers,” said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, “but it is important to acknowledge we’re seeing only a portion of the actual number of cases.”</p>
<p>Case numbers can point to future hot spots and indicate whether a wave of infection has peaked, Mokdad said.</p>
<p>“To give up on knowing if cases are going up or down, it’s flying blind. How can we as a country not know the epidemic curve for infection?” Mokdad said. </p>
<p>If testing has lost its relevance, he said, it is because the U.S. never developed a way to consistently and reliably monitor infections. </p>
<p>“It’s not acceptable to cover failure by changing the rules,” he said.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Long after most other lawmakers had been rushed to safety, they were on the hard marble floor, ducking for cover.</p>
<p>As danger neared, and as the rioters were trying to break down the doors, they called their families. They scrambled for makeshift weapons and mentally prepared themselves to fight. Many thought they might die.</p>
<p>“When I looked up, I had this realization that we were trapped,” said Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a former Army Ranger who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. “They had evacuated the House floor first. And they forgot about us.”</p>
<li><div><a><h4>'We were trapped': Trauma of Jan. 6 lingers for lawmakers</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered </h4></a></div></li>

<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The lawmakers were finally taken to safety roughly an hour after the siege began. </p>
<p>Interviewed by The Associated Press before this week’s anniversary of the attack, 10 of the House members who were in the gallery talked of being deeply shaken by their experience.</p>
<p>Most indelibly, the loud clap of a gunshot, reverberating across the cavernous chamber. </p>
<p>“I’ve heard a lot of gunshots in my time, and it was very clear what that was,” Crow said. “I knew that things had severely escalated.”</p>
<p>Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., was among those sheltering in the gallery. The former police chief in Orlando shuddered when police said there had been a “breach” of the building. </p>
<p>“I knew that meant that the police had somehow lost the line. And I also know, having been a former police officer, that they would have done everything in their power to hold that line to protect us,” she said.</p>
<p>Demings said she told a colleague sheltering with her in the gallery: “Just remember, we’re on the right side of history. If we all die today, another group will come in and certify those ballots.”</p>
<p>Congress reconvened that night, certifying Biden’s election victory before sunrise. </p>
<p>Rep. Annie Kuster, who sought treatment for post-traumatic stress, says the gallery group connects almost daily on the text message chain.</p>
<p>The rioters were inches from the doors of the gallery. </p>
<p>When Kuster made it home two days later, she watched hours of video from the insurrection. It only compounded the trauma. </p>
<p>“I remember my husband coming in, and I was just sobbing,” Kuster said. “And he was holding me, saying, ‘I don’t know if this is the best thing for you to see.’”</p>
<p>“But we have to — we have to acknowledge the reality of what happened that day. And what’s challenging for us is that we are both victims and witnesses to the crime on our country.”</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Jan. 6 riot was an insurrection with a 360-degree view. </p>
<p>The Associated Press compiled a short film of the day’s key moments to capture the record and rebut falsehoods that continue to spread about what happened. </p>
<p>“And we fight,” Trump told the crowd. “We fight like hell. And if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.”</p>
<p>That rhetoric presaged an unthinkable episode of political violence that briefly disrupted America’s peaceful transfer of power. </p>
<a>began searching for lawmakers</a>, forcing evacuations of the House and Senate.

<p>In the <a>crowd were members</a> of the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and other extremist groups. Some of the rioters had served in the <a>military or law enforcement</a>. A handful were <a>active police officers</a>. </p>
<p>Hundreds were injured and five people died during and after the insurrection. </p>
<p>The Capitol was declared secure at 8 p.m. Lawmakers convened again and certified that Trump had lost to Joe Biden. </p>
<p>Videos from Jan. 6 helped quickly disprove <a>claims </a> that left-wing anarchists staged the riot. The rioters <a>were there to support Trump</a>, as many have subsequently said in court. </p>

<div><div><h1>‘We have to be there’: AP photographer recalls Capitol siege</h1></div><div>By J. SCOTT APPLEWHITEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Capitol was under siege. By Americans. </p>
<p>Here, he remembers some moments that stood out to him — moments that, so many months later, he is still processing as a photojournalist and as an American. </p>
<p>“The Capitol has been breached!” the Capitol Police officer shouted to lawmakers. Tear gas was in the Rotunda. “Get out your escape hoods and prepare to evacuate!” the officer said. </p>
<p>From the officers came loud commands: Evacuate. Now. Stragglers were not tolerated — members of Congress, staffers, journalists, all. </p>
<p>But the move to safety was not immediate. Because they didn’t know what was on the other side of the door. </p>
<p>You could hear the growl of the mob just outside. In the chamber, the officers were focused, their guns aimed. And I was trained on the door as well — with a telephoto zoom. </p>
<p>I kept steady and held tight on that spot.</p>
<p>When the breach of the Capitol was announced and evacuation began, it was a chaotic and uncertain process. Evacuate to where? The mob was on the other side of the doors.</p>
<p>After the evacuation order came, AP photographer Andy Harnik lingered and took many important images: lawmakers taking cover, and Capitol Police holding rioters at gunpoint. </p>
<p>The Capitol is where I work every day, and I am a familiar face to most police. When those on the chamber floor shouted up at me to get out, I told them I was fine and refused to leave. This is what we do: We stay and report.</p>
<p>The officer, in plain clothes, was Lt. Michael Byrd. Moments later, outside the House chamber, he shot and killed protester Ashli Babbitt as she climbed through a broken window of a barricaded door leading to the Speaker’s Lobby.</p>
<p>From that point on, I was the only journalist and the only person remaining in the balcony to witness the standoff in the House chamber.</p>
<p>After the lawmakers and press evacuated, those doors were secured. For another two hours, I was locked in. Then an FBI tactical team swept through and threw me out of the building.</p>
<p>The news went on, as it always does. </p>
<p>The result, if you will, was like a mosaic — views from different photographers all around the Capitol that composed a more complete picture.</p>
<p>I’ve witnessed plenty of violence and upheavals before, coups and revolutions, when I was doing conflict coverage abroad, but I am still shocked to experience it here. It was Americans attacking America.</p>
<p>What I saw, and what my camera captured, during the standoff at the House chamber a year ago was this: a place where a line was drawn — with courage, duty and guns.</p>
<p>To do that, we have to be there.</p>
<p>EDITOR’S NOTE — J. Scott Applewhite is a longtime Associated Press photographer in Washington who has covered seven administrations since 1981. He marked his 40th anniversary with the AP the day before the Capitol attack.</p>
