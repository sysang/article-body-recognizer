<header> <h1> Overblown, daft and Americanised, Diamonds Are Forever made a fool of Sean Connery </h1> <p> With behind-the-scenes tension, terrible storylines and dodgy stunts, the only good thing about this film was its two gay henchmen </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tom Fordy <time> 4 January 2022 • 1:48pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Connery would return in 1971 for Diamonds Are Forever, his sixth and – so he insisted – final go as James Bond (though a decade later Connery learned to never say never again) which turns 50 this month.</p>
<a>Roger Moore</a> about the falling out, “but Sean seems to hold onto a grudge.”
<p>The shot of the car entering the alleyway was performed on the Universal backlot, while the shot of the car exiting the alleyway was done by a second unit in Vegas.</p>
<p>There was some debate about whether it was appropriate for families – particularly the smutty innuendo around Lana Wood's Bond girl, Plenty O’Toole. “Named after your father, perhaps,” says Bond.</p>

<p> Sam Peckinpah's most controversial film took his obsession with toxic masculinity to extremes – and pushed his stars to breaking point </p>
<h2> <a> In defence of Jeremy Strong: why attack him for taking his job so seriously? </a> </h2>

<h2> <a> ‘Warren Beatty should be spanked’: how Reds turned Hollywood’s golden boy into a monster </a> </h2>
<p> Beatty's 'iffy project about a communist who dies in the end' sent budgets spiralling and Jack Nicholson mad. Then he cast Diane Keaton… </p>
<h2> <a> Gene Hackman’s one-man war on The Royal Tenenbaums </a> </h2>
<p> The actor was abusive towards director Wes Anderson from day one. But their volatile relationship was arguably what made the film so good </p>

<header> <h1> Covid lateral flow tests: how reliable are they and where can I get a kit? </h1> <p> Alongside booster jabs rapid tests are at the heart of the government's omicron response – here is everything you need to know </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Anne Gulland, Global Health Security Deputy Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:28am </time> </div> </div>
<a>more than 2.5 million on December 12 2021</a>, compared with half a million on the same date in November. 
<p>The Government hopes the tests will give people the confidence to meet up with family and friends.</p>
<p>But how do the tests work, how accurate are they and where can you get them?</p>
<h2>What is a lateral flow test?</h2>
<p>You should also use them before visiting people who are at higher risk of severe illness if they get Covid; or if you are a contact of someone who has tested positive for the virus. </p>
<p>He said the tests were a quick way of checking in real-time whether or not you are infected and infectious. </p>
<h2>What should I do if I test positive?</h2>
<h2>When do I have to isolate?</h2>
<p>Self-isolation is when you do not leave your home because you have or might have coronavirus.</p>
<p>If you do test positive on a lateral flow test, you must self-isolate until you get the results of your PCR test.</p>
<p>The rules in England are that if you do the PCR within two days of a positive lateral flow test and your PCR is negative, you can stop self-isolating.</p>
<p>However, if you do the PCR later than two days, you need to self-isolate even if you get a negative result.</p>
<a>isolation rules</a> have had a crippling effect on the NHS because
<a>so many staff are off work with the virus</a>.
<h2>How accurate are lateral flow tests?</h2>
<p>Lateral flows have high sensitivity and do not give many false positives, however they do give false negative results. </p>
<p>A <a>Cohcrane review of 64 studies </a>found that they correctly identify 72 per cent of infected people who have symptoms, and 78 per cent within the first week of becoming ill. </p>
<p>This was echoed by Sir Chris Whitty during a briefing on January 4. He said lateral flow tests are a "very good guide" to whether someone is at that moment infectious.</p>
<p>If someone is still positive "they do need to stay in isolation" until they are negative, he warned.</p>
<p>PCR tests can remain positive for a long time, Sir Chris pointed out, and said PCRs are "extremely good because they are very sensitive" but lateral flow tests are better at determining whether someone is infectious.</p>
<h2>Can I trust a negative lateral flow test?</h2>
<h2>Can a lateral flow test detect omicron?</h2>
<p>Follow the instructions in the test kit and do not eat, drink or smoke 30 minutes before testing. Wash your hands with soap and water and wipe down the surface you are going to place your kit on. Blow your nose and then wash your hands again.</p>
<h2>Where can I get hold of the tests?</h2>
<p>This article has been updated with the latest guidance, Protect yourself and your family by learning more about <a>Global Health Security</a>.</p>
<h2> Swabbing nose and throat for lateral flow tests more accurate than nose-only samples </h2>
<p> Drop in test sensitivity may be especially significant for omicron variant, which is thought to first replicate in the throat </p>
<h2> <a> PCR vs LFT: Lateral flows can cut Covid isolation but could leave one in 10 with false positive </a> </h2>
<p> Move to scrap confirmatory PCRs for people who test positive with lateral flow reignites debate about which Covid test is best </p>
<h2> <a> London’s Covid cases and admissions peak without overwhelming NHS, figures suggest </a> </h2>
<p> Boris Johnson may have been right to avoid further curbs, with seven-day case rates having been falling in the capital since Dec 26 </p>
<h2> Travelling to Mars may speed up the ageing process and ruin any hope of reaching the Red Planet </h2>
<p> Scientists at the Mayo Clinic hope to prevent such trips from triggering a lethal process known as cell senescence </p>
<h2> <a> Omicron causes just a quarter of deaths compared to previous Covid waves, first data suggests </a> </h2>
<p> Researchers looking at South Africa said there had been a clear decoupling of cases, hospitalisations and deaths compared with other waves </p>
<h2> <a> Catching omicron Covid variant may protect against delta </a> </h2>
<p> Researchers from the Africa Health Research Institute found that the blood plasma of people infected with omicron was able to control delta </p>
<h2> <a> Just one-fifth of new Covid hospital patients are true cases </a> </h2>
<p> Treat data with caution, say experts, as situation in hospitals during omicron wave is different to ‘horrific scenes’ of a year ago </p>
<h2> Scrap Covid self-isolation within months and let us start living with virus, says scientist </h2>
<p> Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at East Anglia, said people who test positive should be allowed to 'go about their normal lives' </p>
<h2> <a> Pro-lockdown experts criticised for trying to rebrand Covid restrictions as 'protections' </a> </h2>
<p> Social media users called the move to soften the language around tougher measures by scientists and medics 'dishonest' </p>
<h2> Far fewer people in hospital with Covid this Christmas despite cases being three times higher </h2>
<p> Doctors said they are 'cautiously optimistic' that no new restrictions will be needed </p>
<h2> <a> Darkest days could be behind us as data hint that omicron cases may have peaked </a> </h2>
<p> With Winter Solstice out of the way, latest Covid statistics show signs of a slowdown and some experts believe lockdown will not be needed </p>
<h2> Workers have already cut their social contacts to lockdown levels, so can they really be expected to tolerate further curbs? </h2>
<p> Analysis: The Government may finally find it has exhausted the nation’s goodwill </p>
<h2> <a> Sage wants entire households to avoid events and gatherings if just one person tests positive </a> </h2>
<p> The recommendation has not yet been adopted by the Government, but further restrictions are being considered as omicron cases surge </p>
<h2> <a> Modelling behind Sajid Javid’s claim of 200,000 daily omicron infections ‘no longer valid’ </a> </h2>
<p> Health officials admit it is now wrong to assume the doubling rate will remain constant, as new measures are slowing the spread of Covid-19 </p>
<h2> <a> Chris Whitty is ‘running the show’ on Covid policy, complain Tory MPs </a> </h2>
<p> Backbench backlash after Chief Medical Officer's comments urging people to cut back on socialising were stronger than Boris Johnson's </p>
<h2> Britain may be ‘better off’ with omicron than it was with delta, says Chris Whitty </h2>
<p> Burden on health service may be reduced by shorter peak of infections and milder illness </p>
<h2> <a> Omicron surge likely to make data on Covid deaths very unreliable – here's why </a> </h2>
<p> Variant could skew hospital and deaths figures to the point that they become largely useless in driving policy </p>
<h2> <a> Professor Chris Whitty: You can go to a party... if that is your priority this Christmas </a> </h2>
<p> Prof Whitty says he wants to 'avoid making other people's choices for them' but stressed that the public must prioritise this Christmas </p>
<h2> <a> Omicron ‘is going to be a problem’ and cause rise in hospitalisations, says Prof Chris Whitty </a> </h2>
<p> Chief Medical Officer warns public not to 'over-interpret' South Africa data and says rise in hospital numbers is a 'nailed-on prospect' </p>
<h2> Omicron spreads 70 times faster in airways than delta but 10 times slower in lungs </h2>
<p> Scientists say it may explain why the variant is very transmissible yet less severe although a higher viral load may worsen immune response </p>
<h2> <a> Wuhan lab leak 'now the most likely origin of Covid', MPs told </a> </h2>
<p> Dr Alina Chan says there is also a risk that Covid-19 is an engineered virus </p>
<h2> <a> Omicron wave may be no worse than a flu pandemic, says former government adviser </a> </h2>
<p> First real-world study also finds that excess natural deaths are significantly lower than in previous waves </p>
