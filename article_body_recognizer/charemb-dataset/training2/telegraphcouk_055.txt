<header> <h1> Rare luxury watch worth up to £500,000 for sale - but you cannot see it before you buy </h1> <p> Seller is so afraid gangsters will steal the Richard Mille timepiece that buyers instead must rely on photographs at auction </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Max Stephens <time> 11 November 2021 • 3:25pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>One of the world's rarest watches will go on sale this weekend - but auctioneers have forbidden buyers from seeing the item in person before purchasing.</p>
<p>The anonymous vendor agreed to sell his limited-edition Richard Mille watch, valued at between £300,000 and £500,000, to refurbish his new multi-million pound house.</p>
<p>Only nine watches of the Richard Mille RM 030 Carbon Kronometry AN CA 1999 were manufactured by the luxury Swiss brand.</p>
<p>However, the seller is so afraid of "shotgun-toting gangsters" stealing the timepiece from Rowley's Auctioneers, in Cambridgeshire, that he has refused to hand it over until after the sale.</p>
<p>Bidders will instead have to rely on photographs presented at the auction on Saturday.</p>
<p>The successful buyer will then meet the vendor at a Richard Mille branch in Bond Street, London.</p>
<p>Once the watch is officially verified by experts at the shop, the buyer will send a "pre-agreed codeword" over the phone to Rowley's to approve the transfer of funds.</p>
<p>Roddy Lloyd, managing director for Rowley's, said the cloak-and-dagger approach of the sale was highly unusual, but the only way to make the sale happen.</p>
<p>He said: "It's very uncommon. It has never happened before, not with us anyway.</p>
<p>"It is such a vulnerable item, because it's small.</p>
<p>"If it was a massive painting, it would be difficult to sell and easy to identify. But a small watch, limited edition, would be easy to sell on the black market and very easy to put in your pocket and disappear with.</p>
<p>"The seller was adamant that it was a security risk and that it might not only be stolen, but that somebody might turn up here and try to burgle or threaten us."</p>
<p>The seller is believed to be a "rather scruffy-looking" British man aged in his late 20s.</p>
<p>Mr Lloyd said the range of watches is popular with "Premier League footballers and singers". </p>
<p>He added: "The sale will also include plenty of other antiques and collectables but it's fair to say that, unusually, the most expensive item will be in absentia." </p>
<p>Drake, the Canadian rapper, bought a diamond-encrusted Richard Mille watch for £4 million on his 35th birthday last month.</p>
<header> <h1> Bidding war expected for author Ralph Ellison's wristwatch </h1> <p> The upcoming sale of a watch that belonged to the author of one of the greatest 20th-century American novels, Invisible Man </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tracey Llewellyn <time> 8 December 2021 • 5:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>While his name may not be as familiar in British literature as George Orwell or DH Lawrence, in the US, Ralph Waldo Ellison is considered every bit as ground-breaking, controversial, and thought-provoking as his English counterparts.</p>
<p>But while spending the summer of 1936 in New York, he met the author Richard Wright and decided not to return to Tuskegee. Instead, he took a job with the New York Federal Writers Program.</p>
<p>Ellison had several essays and short stories published by titles including The New Republic and Saturday Review and continued to write and study authors from Joyce to Dostoevsky and Hemingway during the Great Depression. </p>
<p>But it was while serving as a cook in the US Merchant Marine during the Second World War that Ellison first started to think of writing a novel – an ambition that came to fruition in 1952 with the publication of Invisible Man.</p>
<p>A milestone in American literature, the National Book Award winning tome is as relevant today as it was 70 years ago. The impassioned novel tells the story of a man invisible “simply because people refuse to see me”. </p>
<p>He had stumbled across the e-catalogue less than 24 hours before the sale went live and, although the images were poor, the raised Omega sign on the dial, showed that it had a Calibe 321 movement, which initially piqued his interest. </p>
<p>“The catalogue description was short and simple: ‘Omega Speedmaster Professional with stainless steel band. Provenance: Ralph and Fanny Ellison Charitable Trust’,” says Walbye. </p>
<p>Other images show that he wore it for another 26 years until his death in 1994. Knowing that he was halfway to proving the link, Walbye asked Clerizo to help establish the connection. </p>
<p>Clerizo goes one step further, saying: “For me Ellison's Invisible Man is one of the highest peaks in American literature. His technique and his style rank with Faulkner, Joyce and Proust. </p>

<h1> Inside the space camp where billionaires get a taste of zero gravity with their oysters and champagne </h1>
<p> A new $30,000 'astronaut orientation' weekend offers the elite a luxurious preview — without going into space </p>
<div> <div> By Ruaridh Nicoll Bordeaux <time> 14 October 2021 • 10:11am </time> </div> </div>
<p>After performing press-ups on Mars and making giant leaps across the moon, we step up into the weightlessness of space. There I float for a moment, astounded and uncertain, before crashing back to Earth.</p>
<p>I attempt to levitate Buddha-like in the centre of the cabin but there is a shout of “feet down” and we all collapse to the floor. All that remains of that tiny globe of water falls with us, leaving a rivulet running down my face.</p>
<p>When the invitation to take part in three days of astronaut training at one of France’s finest hotels arrived at my home in Havana, I was skeptical. It sounded as preposterous as that sentence. </p>
<p>As we break from our initial briefing, Guame tells us we have the run of the hotel for the four nights we are there, but warns: “Given the programme, maybe not too much drinking.”</p>
<p>The entrepreneurs fit easily into each other's company, and with the smooth good manners of the French elite they seamlessly include scuffy parvenues such as me. Camaraderie is increased by the arrival of champagne, followed by plates of oysters.</p>
<p>While we don’t necessarily ask for the Moon, it seems we want to circumnavigate the Earth. For this we board a virtual version of Musk’s Dragon capsule. </p>
<p>“Last year we were in Cape Canaveral to see some of our experiments launched and Nicolas said, ‘All the hotels are ugly, we need to build a five-star hotel, a place to train future astronauts’,” Karine tells me. </p>
<p>True luxury isn’t just champagne and oysters, it’s access to amazing people and experiences. Orbite, it’s fair to say, provides them all.</p>
<p>As I walk out onto the apron of Bordeaux airport for the zero-gravity flight the following day, I can’t help but worry that all the peerless hospitality of the last few days has turned me into a fat-tronaut.</p>
<p>Stellar Frontiers can arrange this three-day, four-night Astronaut Orientation experience from £30,000 per person. This price includes five-star hotels and all space-related activities. International flights not included.</p>

<a>the influence he has over cryptocurrency.</a> He can decimate a market overnight by typing one sentence into his phone. What must it feel like to have that kind of power at your fingertips?”
<p>Corporate CEOs and other members of the elite are unlikely to control their own social media accounts, hence their feeds often sounding so bland. That’s why people in the public eye often need a second 'secret' account set to private. </p>
<p>As Keith McNally has clearly realised. On Tuesday the restaurateur posted that he was taking a month off Instagram but that he would be back soon – and “with a vengeance”. And perhaps with a new social media team in place...</p>
