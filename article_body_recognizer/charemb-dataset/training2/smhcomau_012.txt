<div>Australia, New Zealand combine for Tonga disaster response</div>
<p>Australia will partner with New Zealand to support the island nation of Tonga recover from the eruption of an underwater volcano on Saturday, sparking evacuation orders after the blast generated tsunami warnings across the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern spoke on Sunday about coordinating the countries’ aid effort, which will include offers of supplies and personnel to work with non-government organisations.</p>
<p>Minister for International Development and the Pacific Zed Seselja said Tonga had accepted assistance from Australia and New Zealand, and the details of this effort will continue to evolve as the situation on the ground became clearer.</p>
<p>Mr Seselja said it was a “fluid situation” and the government was yet to receive detailed information, but it was ready to offer more assistance as the situation demands.</p>
<p>“The Australian government stands ready to do much more as the situation unfolds as we understand the situation better. And we’ll be making those offers through officials,” he said.</p>
<p>Ms Ardern said there had been significant damage in Nuku’alofa, but the situation appeared to be “calm and stable”, however, outlying areas and islands in the Tongan archipelago had not been assessed.</p>
<p>“Power has been restored to some parts and mobile phones are working. However, I would note that we have not yet received the news from other coastal areas of Tonga or the other islands.”</p>
<p>Ms Ardern offered initial financial assistance of AUD$472,000, which she said was only a starting figure and more would be offered.</p>
<p>Tonga remains virtually COVID-free, and Ms Ardern and Mr Seselja said their disaster response plans would work with the county’s strict border control measures.</p>
<p>Mr Seselja said Australia has been “working on a lot of procedures in the last couple of years as to how to deliver humanitarian assistance”.</p>
<p>Communications with Tonga have been disrupted by the blast, but there are patrol boats on the scene, Mr Seselja said.</p>
<p>Mr Seselja said anyone in the Tongan community in Australia who wants to assist should provide financial support to aid organisations.</p>
<p>Labor international development and Pacific spokesman Pat Conroy welcomed the government’s offer of support to Tonga.</p>
<p>“We hope that no one has been harmed and no lives have been lost,” Mr Conroy said. “Australia must remain a partner of choice to Pacific nations and assist them in their times of need.”</p>
<div>More eruptions predicted for volcano off Tonga as tsunami’s effects felt around the globe</div>
<p>When coastal geologist Ian Goodwin went surfing at Avalon Beach at sunrise on Sunday, he could feel the after-effects of the tsunami that had ripped through Tonga only hours earlier.</p>
<p>“Paddling out was tough, the waves were smaller and choppier,” he said. “There was a sizeable swell running and unusual currents. It was like the ocean was completely confused.”</p>
<p>On Sunday night, there were reports it had contaminated vital water supplies and had severely increased the air pollution of the island.</p>
<p>Professor Abram said a similar event to the explosion of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano had not occurred since the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines.</p>
<p>“If it has put enough matter into the stratosphere, then we could see cooler temperatures for the next year or so,” she said.</p>
<p>In late 2014 and early 2015, a series of eruptions in the area, about 60 kilometres north of the capital, created a small island and disrupted international air travel to the Pacific archipelago for several days.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Bureau of Meteorology issued renewed tsunami alerts and marine threat warnings for all of Australia’s east coast, with lifesavers closing all beaches affected by the warning. NSW beaches remained closed on Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Meteorologist Sarah Scully said warnings were expected to be cancelled into Sunday evening, with the highest wave recorded at 1.27 metres on Norfolk Island.</p>
<p>“So an enormous amount of energy was released by the volcanic eruption, and that was trapped by the oceans,” she said, noting a 0.82-metre wave was recorded on the Gold Coast and a 0.77-metre wave at Twofold Bay.</p>
<p>For a tsunami warning to be cancelled, an area would need to have no significant wave height for six hours, Ms Scully said.</p>
<p>From Bondi to Newport, many surfers chose to remain in the water, but Bondi’s ironman series was called off.</p>
<p>University of Newcastle coastal scientist Hannah Power said geological evidence from massive eruptions shows the events are not “usually one-off” and often come in multiples.</p>
<p>“Tsunami waves come in clusters,” Associate Professor Power said.</p>
<p>“We might see another eruption in days, weeks or even years. Often the first wave is not the biggest, so people can become complacent.</p>
<p>Dr Power said forceful and unusual currents of water were being “pushed upstream in estuaries, and then pulled back downstream” as the tsunami waves propagate into and out the estuary system.</p>
<p>“We have ... aircraft ready to deploy and are looking at the deployment of a Navy vessel should it be required,” she said.</p>
<p>“The Tongan government has agreed to an offer for assistance from the Australian government of a P8 surveillance flight, which we hope will be able to deploy [Monday] morning,” Mr Seselja said.</p>
<p>Pending ash and weather, the flight will assess damage to critical infrastructure such as roads, ports and powerlines, which will determine the next phase of the response.</p>
<p>University of Auckland Professor Shane Cronin, a vulcanologist, told New Zealand’s RNZ radio the umbrella ash cloud from the explosion was 300 kilometres wide at some point.</p>
<p>“The cloud covered the [nearest] island, that’s why it went completely dark. The ash doesn’t let any light through,” he said.</p>
<p>Professor Cronin said there would “almost certainly be more eruptions” in the next few days and weeks.</p>
<p>ANU’s earthquake and tsunami scientist Professor Phil Cummins said while Australia’s east coast had historically avoided large tsunamis, the number of southern volcanoes along the Tonga-Kermadec trench do pose risks.</p>
<p>“If that trench had a large earthquake or a volcanic flank collapse [then] that could cause a significant tsunami on Australia’s eastern coast.”</p>
<p>University of NSW’s coastal researcher Mitchell Harley said the one-metre tsunami waves that hit Sydney’s shores over the weekend generated strong currents, making surfing and boating hazardous.</p>

<p>After a weekend of closed beaches due to the devastating volcanic eruption in Tonga, Sydneysiders flocked to the sea on Monday as temperatures in parts of the city nudged 30 degrees.</p>
<p>“I used to come here with my family as a child. I remember feeling so relaxed, I’m thrilled my two boys will finally be able to experience it after so long,” she said.</p>
<p>“It may seem strange given we’re only a couple of hours from Sydney, but both lockdowns saw us unable to visit. It’s so beautiful, and we’ve had great weather, so we’re feeling very lucky,” she said.</p>
<p>Kingswood primary school teacher Mirvat Sbeity spent the day getting a swimming lesson from her eight-year-old daughter Julie.</p>
<p>“I’ve always wanted to learn and who better teacher than my daughter. She’s such a good swimmer and the water is so clear here. We did breaststroke and freestyle,” she said.</p>
<p>Fiona Willis went for a swim at Redleaf pool in Sydney’s east on Monday morning after the swell at Bondi Beach caused by Tonga’s Hunga Hunga Ha’apai volcano shut down the Icebergs pool, and her two sons’ lessons.</p>
<p>A hazardous surf warning was issued by the Bureau of Meteorology on Monday urging the east coast of the state to consider staying out of the water in light of the severe swells caused by the eruption.</p>
<p>Until recently, Mrs Willis worked as a communication’s manager in the finance industry but found juggling the demands of home schooling, looking after her younger son, and a busy fulltime job too overwhelming.</p>
<p>“ It was just too much. My youngest child’s preschool closed, I was working all evening and I just couldn’t keep it all up,” she said.</p>
<p>The Willis’s are in limbo as they await a move to West Australia when the state border reopens in February.</p>
<p>“We can’t even look at accommodation yet as we’re not sure whether we’ll have to go into hotel quarantine or if they’ll change plans at the last minute, it’s incredibly stressful.”</p>
<p>For Mrs Willis, the worst part is not knowing where or when they’ll be able to enroll their son in school.</p>
<p>“The delayed border reopening is preventing us from any kind of stability and last year was already hard enough,” she said.</p>
<p>Despite all the complications and pressure over the past two years, Mrs Willis takes solace in all the quality time she’s spent with her children over the past year.</p>
<div>‘Worst thing is not knowing’: Tongan players’ agonising wait for contact from loved ones</div>
<p>The hardest thing for the Tongan rugby league players is the silence and not knowing if their loved ones have made it to safety following the underwater volcano eruption that rocked the Pacific nation over the weekend.</p>
<p>Woolf and the players were treated like rock stars when they met King Tupou VI before a Test against Australia in 2018. Tonga defeated Australia a year later, which sparked a party on the streets of Auckland.</p>
<p>There has been talk among some players about putting together a relief package for the locals rather than raising money. NRL clubs posted messages of support on social media.</p>
<p>“You hope everything is alright, and everyone is in your thoughts, but not having that contact at the moment makes it really difficult.</p>
<p>“There are so many terrific people over there, and when our players go over, the way we are accommodated and treated, there is a real sense of belonging, and you appreciate how grateful the people are to have the players.</p>
<p>“It’s devastating to hear this has gone on. The fact there’s no communication coming out of there at the moment, you can only hope everyone has got to higher ground.</p>
<p>“We’d love communication to come out of there sooner than later so everyone can work out what sort of help is needed.”</p>
<p>Hurrell lived in Tonga until his late teens before he moved to New Zealand to kickstart his NRL career with the Warriors. He lost his mother in 2020, but his father and siblings still reside in Tonga.</p>
<p>“All the players have either parents or siblings, grandparents, aunties and uncles living there - they have all been affected and are hoping for the best,” Woolf said.</p>
<p>“The reason the players make the sacrifices they do to play for Tonga is the chance to make their families proud.</p>
<p>“The time will come to represent Tonga at the World Cup, and hopefully we can put some smiles on their faces.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure Samoa would love to be involved and the entire country would get behind it,” Woolf said.</p>
<p>Tonga, whose last Test was the historic win over Australia, will have a warm-up game against France in France before the World Cup, which will begin in England at the end of October.</p>

<p>The development marks the beginning of the end for the sprawling real estate empire started 25 years ago by founder Hui Ka Yan, setting off a lengthy battle over who gets paid from what remains.</p>
<p>Chinese junk dollar bonds held earlier gains of as much as three cents on the dollar after the downgrades.</p>

<div>Turn on the tap: $4b worth of pubs change hands in frothy market</div>
<p>A wave of cash is flooding into pubs as venues from the inner-city to the bush change hands making them one of real estate’s hottest sectors.</p>
<p>Real Capital Analytics estimates transaction volumes are on course to eclipse previous highs. Sales volumes for pubs dropped precipitously in 2020 after COVID-19 hit, slumping 22 per cent compared to the year before.</p>
<p>“Investors don’t appear to have been completely put off by the numerous lockdowns Melbourne has undergone and the one in Sydney,” RCA’s Pacific head of analytics Benjamin Martin-Henry said.</p>
<p>HTL Property managing director Andrew Jolliffe, who kicked off the latest transaction bonanza when he negotiated the sale of the Hotel Hollywood in Sydney’s Surry Hills in April, says investor interest is at an all-time high.</p>
<p>In late December, former Nine Entertainment boss David Gyngell and the widow of the late actor and writer John “Strop” Cornell, Delvene Cornell, sold the Hotel Brunswick near Byron Bay for $68 million to listed fund manager MA Financial.</p>
<p>Each pub in the portfolio provided extremely rare Western Sydney growth corridor real estate. “The Stanford family’s Sydney portfolio set new benchmarks both in terms of record pricing and yields,” Jolliffe says.</p>
<p>Bruce Solomon, a pub industry veteran, set the bar high with his purchase of the Carousal Inn, in Sydney’s western suburb of Rooty Hill, from the Stanford family for an eye-watering $64 million.</p>
<p>“The big attraction of hotels is the consistency of revenue. As it used to be in the old days, people still have a drink when they’re celebrating or have a drink when they commiserate.”</p>
<cite>Pub veteran and Solotel director Bruce Solomon</cite>
<p>Solomon runs the Solotel Group with his family and celebrity chef Matt Moran and says pubs are attractive when they are part of a community where locals and visitors relax and enjoy being social after months of lockdowns.</p>
<p>Solotel has owned the Darlo bar in Sydney’s city fringe for decades and also runs the Opera Bar and Barangaroo House in the city, among other popular venues. “The pub trade has been remarkably resilient,” Solomon says.</p>
<p>Justin Hemmes’s Merivale is setting its sights on building its Victorian portfolio where it splashed out a combined $80 million to purchase the coastal Lorne pub and Tomasetti House in Flinders Lane.</p>
<p>Musca says the weight of money looking for pub investments will continue to drive an “extraordinary period of transactional activity.”</p>
<p>Pub veteran Arthur Laundy last year swooped on the Bay View at Woy Woy, on the NSW Central Coast for $38 million. Laundy says community pubs are in “high demand.”</p>
<p>Long-time publican and hotel operator Fraser Short will take the reins of The Sir George from mother-daughter ownership duo Liz Prater and Kate Hufton this February after paying $14 million for the property.</p>
<p>On the corporate side, listed property fund manager Charter Hall has become the country’s biggest pub owner after investors in landlord ALE Property approved a $1.7 billion takeover.</p>
<p>ALE Property was the country’s biggest pub landlord with 78 high-profile pubs and bottle shops across the country that are majority-leased to the newly listed drinks and pub operator Endeavour Group.</p>
<p>The ALE portfolio will add to the Hostplus and Charter Hall fund’s existing portfolio of 62 Endeavour Group’s leased assets.</p>
<p>The ALE portfolio is attractive as the assets have long-term leases with lengthy options, a quality operator, and low site coverage, which provides redevelopment potential over time and are materially under-rented.</p>

<div>The smart companies that avoided RAT trap by bulk ordering kits last year</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Finding a rapid antigen test has become like a game of snap for millions of Australians who spend hours searching pharmacies and supermarkets before supplies are sold out within minutes of hitting shelves.</p>
<p>But some forward-thinking businesses secured supplies months ago, knowing the tests would hold the key to helping keep them afloat.</p>
<p>Gerry Harvey started putting in orders for tens of thousands of RAT kits in September and now supplies them to most Harvey Norman staff nationally.</p>
<p>“We are probably doing this as well as or better than anyone,” he says.</p>
<p>“We saw that Omicron virus was kicking off really strongly overseas ... and we figured it was going to here.”</p>
<p>“You could argue we have an advantage, but in fairness we’ve got to take a few risks in business,” Harvey says. “Whereas governments are probably in a different position to that.”</p>
<p>Executive director of Business Sydney Paul Nicolaou says while some big businesses are providing tests to staff in the workplace, “small and medium-sized businesses are scrambling”.</p>
<p>“They are literally getting people to drive around the city just to find kits for their workers,” he says.</p>
<p>“They need to get their staff to work otherwise their businesses won’t survive the next couple of weeks.”</p>
<p>Nicolaou says some businesses are spending up to $15,000 to provide onsite testing for workers.</p>
<p>“The thing that has helped the most has been the relaxation of requirements for close and casual contacts.”</p>
<p>Managing director of Allied Express Transport Michelle McDowell made a big financial investment in providing free rapid antigen testing on site to help keep the business afloat.</p>
<p>The business employs 1000 drivers and 450 staff in its offices and depots to transport goods including pharmaceuticals, electronics, automotive spare parts and online retail purchases.</p>
<p>“It was crucial for us to keep those supply chains open,” she says.</p>
<p>An external rapid antigen test supplier provides the tests to Ms McDowell’s employees in Chullora. The results are recorded and reported to staff via text messages.</p>
<p>“They have some fantastic software in place that records all the results. We use the software program to manage the return to work of staff,” McDowell says. “In the last two weeks we’d be 40 per cent down on our staff.</p>
<p>“The rapid testing has really helped to keep our business safe. While it is picking up a lot of [positive] results now, it has really safeguarded us and has allowed us to continue to operate.”</p>
<p>Since September, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has been calling for RATs to be freely and widely available for small business and other industry settings.</p>
<p>“Larger corporates in higher-risk industries have generally been better prepared as they moved to implement RAT programs late last year and had existing stockpiles to utilise,” ACCI chief executive Andrew McKellar says.</p>
<p>“Smaller businesses on the other hand don’t have the same access to suppliers nor the internal resourcing to manage what is an administratively complex and expensive program.</p>
<h3>How big business is working with RATs to combat the Omicron wave</h3>
<li>Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank are among the big banks providing rapid antigen tests to employees, mainly to staff in its branches. </li>
<li>National Australia Bank is helping employees source RATs when needed, and says it is trying “to not impact the overall supply of tests to those that need them in the community”.</li>
<li>Telstra is providing tests for staff in its call centres and its central operations centre. It has asked the remainder of staff to keep working from home.</li>
<li>One of Australia’s biggest law firms, King Wood Mallesons, is finalising a rapid test “surveillance program” to give staff who want to return to the office with “peace of mind”.</li>
<li>Microsoft says it is encouraging its Australian staff to work from home, and it does not require office-based employees to take a rapid antigen test before coming into work.</li>
<li>“However, from next week we will be providing some of our frontline staff with rapid antigen tests,” a spokeswoman says.</li>
<li>Google Australia was not providing RATs to staff, with most still working from home.</li>
<li>Ernst and Young is reviewing its policies and considering ordering RATs for “workplace situations where they might be required”, a spokesperson said.</li>
<li>KPMG Australia acknowledged the need to prioritise RATs for staff who most needed them.</li>
<li>PwC has not introduced any requirements for staff to have a rapid test before attending its offices or travelling. It says it will monitor the situation as the tests become easier to access. </li>
<li>Most Medibank office staff are still working from home, but homecare staff are supplied with RATS in “line with the applicable government recommendations in the state or territory” where they are based, a spokesperson said.</li>
<li>Woolworths supermarkets started supplying RATs across four Sydney distribution centres in August and now supplies them to all its centres around the country, apart from those in WA.</li>
<li>Energy infrastructure business APA Group says it is working to “procure and deploy rapid antigen tests to APA sites across the country to support our people and keep people safe”.</li>
<li>APA’s essential workers who service critical infrastructure will get priority while office staff have been advised, for now, to keep working from home.</li>

<div>Seven completes Prime deal as executives exit</div>
<p>Seven West Media has completed its $133.88 million acquisition of Prime Media Group’s business and assets, placing the Kerry Stokes-controlled network in a much stronger position as it moves into 2022.</p>
<p>Shareholders approved the deal to merge the two long-time business partners at an extraordinary meeting on December 23.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Prime shareholders will receive 36¢ per share including a special fully franked dividend of 26¢. Prime shareholders will receive a distribution on January 22.</p>
<p>Prime told the ASX on Friday that it intended to proceed with a winding-up or other dealing with the shell company following the payment of the distribution in January or February. It expects its shares to be suspended from trade from January 25.</p>
<p>Seven West Media chief executive James Warburton, who has long advocated for the businesses to merge into a larger company, said the deal was a game-changer for both businesses.</p>
<p>“We now have the potential to reach more than 90 per cent of Australia’s population each month as one integrated company and to give advertisers and agencies easy and seamless access to metro and regional markets,” he said.</p>
<p>Seven also plans to reinvest in content and expand its delivery of the group’s offering in regional markets.</p>
<p>As expected, the completion of the deal saw Prime’s most senior staff leave the company. Chief executive Ian Audsley and chief financial officer John Palisi stepped down on December 31 after being made redundant as part of the sales process.</p>
<p>Prime’s chairman, Cass O’Connor, praised Mr Audsley’s contribution to the business in a statement put out on Friday.</p>
<p>Mr Palisi has been appointed as a non-executive director of Prime to assist with the winding-up of the shell company.</p>

<div>Village Roadshow trapped on COVID-19 rollercoaster</div>
<p>The owner of Village Roadshow says its ongoing viability hinges on the Omicron wave not triggering new restrictions on its cinemas and theme parks, after suffering another heavy loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>VRG Holdco, the entity that owns the storied business, ran at a net loss of $35.8 million in the 12 months to June 30, 2021, according to accounts lodged with the corporate regulator on December 20.</p>
<p>That result compares to a $117.4 million loss in the 2020 financial year and a $6.6 million loss in the pre-pandemic 2019.</p>
<p>Village’s Gold Coast theme parks – which include Warner Brothers Movie World, Sea World and Wet’N’Wild – were also battered by social distancing requirements and loss of visitors due to border closures.</p>
<p>In 2021 the group’s Gold Coast theme parks ran at a $4.6 million loss and its cinemas ran at a $1.8 million loss, while its film distribution business delivered a $4.6 million profit.</p>
<p>VRG Holdco’s directors said the business remained a going concern, but based that on the assumption that its theme parks and cinemas could operate free from major COVID-19 disruptions.</p>
<p>While the Omicron outbreak has not triggered new lockdowns, state governments have reintroduced measures including compulsory mask-wearing indoors, including in cinemas, in an effort to curtail rapidly growing case numbers.</p>
<p>The company’s $229.6 million revolving debt facility was due to be repaid on January 15 this year, but in October, its lenders agreed to extend the maturity date to July 31 next year.</p>
<p>The group also received $16 million worth of payments through the JobKeeper wage subsidy in 2021 and another $3.9 million from the federal government’s Supporting Australia’s Exhibiting Zoos and Aquariums program.</p>

<p>Hooray for eating out! Here are three things Amelia missed about that – and three more she didn’t miss at all.</p>
<div>‘Desperate to find answers’: Hospitality sector turns to apps for help</div>
<p>LinkedIn largely caters to a particular demographic: the urbane, ‘white-collar’ professional, most likely tertiary educated, and looking to take the next step on the career ladder in their office-based job.</p>
<p>So, they created Sample, a professional networking app. “We really believe in democratising access to opportunity,” Mr Gibb added.</p>
<p>Sample is just one of an emerging cohort of new players entering the marketplace to take advantage of the sector’s newfound enthusiasm for tech solutions amid the dearth of hospitality workers.</p>
<p>“There is an absolute labour crisis in this industry that’s brutal, and ripping [it] apart,” said mobile table ordering app meu founder Stevan Premutico, who also founded Dimmi (now TheFork).</p>
<p>“I think people were honestly just desperate to find answers.”</p>
<p>Upon payment, the meu platform gives diners tipping options of 5, 10, or 15 per cent. After the most recent spate of lockdowns ended, Mr Premutico said tipping via meu ticked up by 27.5 per cent.</p>
<p>“We proved that if you get rid of the barriers and the friction, and you allow a customer to sit at the table, push a button and get a beer and a burger to the table, you will spend significantly more.”</p>
<p>Yet not much is seen of what goes on behind the scenes, in the early hours of the morning when chefs and kitchen staff are busy preparing for the day ahead.</p>
<p>“There’s no such thing as Coles or Woolies for the wholesale side. It’s all very specialised individual suppliers.”</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle, according to Lipschitz, is convincing hardened chefs to do things a different way. But once they do, they stay with it, even when they jump to a different job.</p>
<p>“The changed behaviour always leads to them sticking for life,” Mr Lipschitz said. “We’re really encouraged by the fact that a little bit of hesitancy and changed behaviour in the beginning always works in the end.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s the ideal market for hospitality tech players to show collegiality and help.”</p>

<div>Inside Australia’s growing pirate electric car market</div>
<div><div><h5>By Nick O'Malley</h5><div>Updated <span><time>December 28, 2021 — 3.48pm</time></span><span>first published <time>December 27, 2021 — 5.00am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Australia’s slow uptake of electric vehicles has led to the spread of a cottage industry in parallel imports, with small businesses springing up to bring in low-cost second-hand cars from Japan.</p>
<p>J-Spec will source the car, test its battery and ensure it is legal to drive on Australian roads at a fraction of the cost of the high-end Teslas that are slowly pushing into the Australian market.</p>
<p>Due to importation and road safety regulations and the fact Australia, like Japan, drives on the left-hand side of the road, most of the cars are sourced from Japan.</p>
<p>Many are Nissan Leafs, but small transit vans are also becoming popular. Regulations prevent these small importers from bringing in models already available on the Australian market.</p>
<p>“The future is electric, anyone who can’t see that is lying to themselves,” he says. He still loves the internal combustion engine, even though about 15 per cent of his business is now electric.</p>
<p>In Hobart, Anthony Broese van Groenou, a PhD candidate at the University of Tasmania specialising in energy systems, co-founded The Good Car Company out of frustration at what he sees as a lack of EV policy direction from Canberra.</p>
<p>Mr Broese van Groenou says he believes it will be impossible for Australia to meet its emissions reductions targets without rapidly electrifying its car fleet. But without federal incentives the process is not moving fast enough, he says.</p>
<p>He believes electric cars are crucial to decarbonisation not only for their own reduced emissions, but with the right equipment EVs could charge during periods of low demand and had the potential to sell power back into the grid at peak periods.</p>
<p>“One million electric cars would provide the same amount of dispatchable power as two coal-fired power plants,” he says.</p>
<p>Mr Jafari has also called on governments to buy electric cars in their fleets to build a healthy second-hand market.</p>
<p>The Good Car Company imports for individual clients, but also brings down prices on second-hand EVs even further by facilitating bulk purchases for groups around the country.</p>
<p>In Yackandandah in north-east Victoria, Russell Klose, who once imported cars and parts from a business in Albury-Wodonga, has come out of retirement with his son Cam and friend Matt Grogan for the same reason.</p>
<p>They have formed Kilowatt Cars, and are now waiting on a licence to begin to sell low-priced second-hand electric cars also sourced from Japan.</p>
<p>“It is the sort of thing people have just given up on the Australian government doing, so we are doing it for ourselves,” he said.</p>
<p>According to Mr Broese van Groenou, an entry-level second-hand, first generation Leaf will cost about $20,000 and arrive with a range of around 110 kilometres, suitable for most commuting.</p>
