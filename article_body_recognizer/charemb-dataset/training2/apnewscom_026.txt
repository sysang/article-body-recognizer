<div><div><h1>Last parent of a child killed in 1963 church bombing dies</h1></div><div>January 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — Maxine McNair, the last living parent of any of the four Black girls killed in a 1963 Alabama church bombing, died Sunday. She was 93. </p>
<p>McNair’s family announced her death in a press release. A cause of death was not given.</p>
<p>Three members of the Ku Klux Klan were eventually convicted in the case, the first in 1977 and two more in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Maxine McNair worked as a teacher for over three decades in Birmingham public schools. Her daughter, Lisa McNair, said she changed many lives through education and left a lasting legacy through the students she touched. </p>
<p>Maxine McNair’s husband, Chris McNair, died in 2019 at the age of 93. He was one of the first Black members of the Alabama legislature since Reconstruction, and a Jefferson County commissioner.</p>
<p>In 2013, Maxine McNair attended an Oval Office ceremony in which President Barack Obama awarded the four girls the Congressional Gold Medal, one of the country’s highest civilian honors.</p>
<p>Funeral arrangements for a celebration of Maxine McNair’s life are pending. </p>
<p>Denise McNair was one of five girls who had gathered in a downstairs bathroom at the 16th Street Baptist Church on Sept. 15, 1963, when a timed bomb planted by KKK members went off outside under a set of stairs. </p>
<p>The fifth girl and sister of Addie Mae Collins, Sarah Collins Rudolph, was blinded in one eye by the blast. She later provided testimony that helped lead to the convictions of the men accused of planting the bomb.</p>
<div><div><h1>Snow storms and pandemic ground flights, delay holiday’s end</h1></div><div>By MATT O'BRIENJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Wintry weather combined with the pandemic to frustrate air travelers whose return flights home from the holidays were canceled or delayed in the first days of the new year.</p>
<p>More than 2,600 U.S. flights and more than 4,400 worldwide were grounded Sunday, according to tracking service FlightAware.</p>
<p>That followed Saturday’s mass cancellations of more than 2,700 U.S. flights, and more than 4,700 worldwide.</p>
<p>“It was absolute mayhem,” said Natasha Enos, who spent a sleepless Saturday night and Sunday morning at Denver International Airport during what was supposed to be a short layover on a cross-country trip from Washington to San Francisco.</p>
<p>Saturday’s single-day U.S. toll of grounded flights was the highest since just before Christmas, when airlines began blaming staffing shortages on increasing COVID-19 infections among crews.</p>
<p>A winter storm that hit the Midwest on Saturday made Chicago the worst place in the country for travelers throughout the weekend. About a quarter of all flights at O’Hare Airport were canceled Sunday.</p>
<p>“It was a lot of people in a very small space and not everybody was masking,” said the 28-year-old financial analyst. “There were a lot of exhausted kids and some families were so stressed out.”</p>
<p>And thousands of miles from the closest snow storms, Hawaiian Airlines said it had to cancel several flights between islands and across the Pacific due to staffing shortages.</p>

<p>Delta Air Lines said Sunday it was issuing a travel waiver for planned flights this week out of mid-Atlantic airports in Baltimore and Washington in preparation for forecasted winter weather.</p>
<p>American Airlines said most of Sunday’s canceled flights had been canceled ahead of time to avoid last-minute disruptions at the airport.</p>
<p>SkyWest, a regional carrier that operates flights under the names American Eagle, Delta Connection and United Express, grounded more than 500 flights Sunday, about 20% of its schedule, according to FlightAware.</p>

<div><div><h1>Biden would push for less US reliance on nukes for defense</h1></div><div>By ROBERT BURNSSeptember 21, 2020 GMT</div></div>
<p>China, whose relatively small nuclear force is growing in sophistication, is cited by the Pentagon’s top nuclear commander as a leading reason why the United States should go all out on nuclear modernization.</p>
<p>Just days before Trump entered the White House, then-Vice President Biden cautioned against abandoning Obama’s approach.</p>
<p>“In practice, there are often pressures to continue the status quo,” Acton said in an interview.</p>
<p>Biden embraces the notion that nuclear weapons should play a smaller role in defense strategy and that the ultimate goal should be a nuclear-free world. He has not spelled out how he would pursue this, but he has dropped clues.</p>
<p>“Bad idea,” Biden said in July 2019. Having these makes the U.S. “more inclined to use them,” he added.</p>
<p>Obama considered but rejected a shift to “no first use.”</p>
<p>Some have speculated that Biden would consider dropping the plan to build a new nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile force, replacing the Minuteman 3 fleet fielded in 1970. That project is expected to cost at least $85 billion.</p>
<p>Loren Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute, believes Biden would stick to the missile program.</p>

<div><div><h1>Angst over China, Russia lessens chance of US nuke changes</h1></div><div>By ROBERT BURNSJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Then China happened — revelations about its expanding nuclear force and <a>talk of potential war with Taiwan.</a></p>
<p>And then Russia happened — <a>signs that it might be preparing to invade Ukraine.</a></p>
<p>Now, major shifts in U.S. nuclear weapons policy seem much less likely, and while Biden may insist on certain adjustments, momentum toward a historic departure from the <a>Trump administration’s policy</a> appears to have stalled.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>'We were trapped': Trauma of Jan. 6 lingers for lawmakers</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>'We have to be there': AP photographer recalls Capitol siege</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<a>Biden and Putin discussed Ukraine by phone on Thursday,</a> and senior American and Russian officials are scheduled to follow up with more detailed talks in Geneva on Jan. 9-10.
<p>Tom Z. Collina, policy director at Ploughshares Fund, an advocate for nuclear disarmament, says the China and Russia problems complicate the politics of Biden’s nuclear review but should not stop him from acting to reduce nuclear dangers.</p>
<p>In March, in what the White House called <a>interim national security guidance</a>, Biden said China and Russia had changed “the distribution of power across the world.”</p>
<p>“We will take steps to reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy,” the guidance said without offering details, while also ensuring a safe and reliable U.S. nuclear force and seeking arms control opportunities.</p>
<p>“Because of what China has done, it has really changed the complexion of this review,” says Robert Soofer, who was the Pentagon’s top nuclear policy official during the Trump administration and led a 2018 nuclear review.</p>
<p>“Rather than it being a review that examines reducing the role of nuclear weapons and even eliminating a leg of the triad, now they’ve been obliged to basically stay the course and determine how to tweak it at the margins.”</p>
<a>“real anxiety” among U.S. allies in Europe over Russian defense and nuclear policy.</a>
<p>Kahl did not preview the policy review outcome, but he said it is intended to fit inside a broader defense strategy, which also is to be published early in 2022.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether Biden will approve any significant change in what is called “declaratory policy,” which states the purpose of nuclear weapons and the circumstances under which they might be used.</p>
<a>“only consider the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances to defend the vital interests of the United States or its allies and partners.”</a> It did not define “extreme circumstances.”
<p>But some argue that China and Russia this year have changed “today’s threats,” perhaps keeping Biden on a cautious path.</p>
<div><div><h1>FDA expands Pfizer boosters for more teens as omicron surges</h1></div><div>By LAURAN NEERGAARDJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The U.S. is expanding COVID-19 boosters as it confronts the omicron surge, with the Food and Drug Administration allowing extra Pfizer shots for children as young as 12. </p>
<p><a>Boosters</a> already are recommended for everyone 16 and older, and federal regulators on Monday decided they’re also warranted for 12- to 15-year-olds once enough time has passed since their last dose.</p>
<p>The FDA also said everyone 12 and older who’s eligible for a Pfizer booster can get one as early as five months after their last dose rather than six months. </p>
<p>FDA vaccine chief Dr. Peter Marks said even though serious illness is uncommon in younger teens, a booster will help them avoid that risk — while also helping reduce the spread of omicron or any other coronavirus mutant.</p>
<p>The FDA based its latest booster decision largely on real-world data from Israel that found no new safety concerns when 6,300 12- to 15-year-olds got a Pfizer booster five months after their second dose.</p>
<p>Likewise, the FDA said even more data from Israel showed no problems with giving anyone eligible for a Pfizer booster that extra dose a month sooner than the six months that until now has been U.S. policy. </p>
<p>While the FDA didn’t consult its independent scientific advisers before making that decision, the CDC’s own advisory panel is sure to closely weigh how much benefit this age group is likely to get before backing the extra shot.</p>
<p>Children tend to suffer less serious illness from COVID-19 than adults. But <a> child hospitalizations are rising</a> during the omicron wave -- most of them unvaccinated.</p>
<p>Pediatrician and global health expert Dr. Philip Landrigan of Boston College welcomed the FDA’s decisions, but stressed that the main need is to get the unvaccinated their first shots.</p>
<p>The vaccine made by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech is the only U.S. option for children of any age. About 13.5 million 12- to 17-year-olds — just over half that age group — have received two Pfizer shots, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>For families hoping to keep their children as protected as possible, the booster age limit raised questions. </p>
<p>Pfizer is studying its vaccine, in even smaller doses, for children younger than 5. </p>
<p>What about timing of boosters for adults who got the Moderna or Johnson Johnson vaccines?</p>

<div><div><h1>NASA’s new space telescope ‘hunky-dory’ after problems fixed</h1></div><div>By MARCIA DUNNJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The tennis court-size sunshield on the James Webb Space Telescope is now fully open and in the process of being stretched tight. The operation should be complete by Wednesday.</p>
<p>The $10 billion telescope — the largest and most powerful astronomical observatory ever launched — rocketed away Christmas Day from French Guiana. Its sunshield and primary mirror had to be folded to fit into the European Ariane rocket.</p>
<p>The sunshield is vital for keeping Webb’s infrared-sensing instruments at subzero temperatures, as they scan the universe for the first stars and galaxies, and examine the atmospheres of alien worlds for possible signs of life.</p>
<p>Getting the sunshield extended last Friday “was really a huge achievement for us,” said project manager Bill Ochs. All 107 release pins opened properly.</p>
<p>But there have been a few obstacles.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>NASA nails trickiest job on newly launched space telescope</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Climate change, new construction mean more ruinous fires</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Jake's mice: Searching for answers to the puzzle of autism</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>NASA estimates metrics of exploding meteor that shook ground</h4></a></div></li>
<p>They also repointed the telescope to limit sunlight on six overheating motors. The motors cooled enough to begin securing the sunshield, a three-day process that can be halted if the problem crops up again, officials said.</p>
<p>“Everything is hunky-dory and doing well now,” Lo said. </p>
<p>Ochs expects the tightening of the sunshield to be drama-free. </p>
<p>“The best thing for operations is boring, and that’s what we anticipate over the next three days, is to be boring,” he told reporters in a teleconference.</p>
<p>If that holds true, the telescope’s gold-plated mirror — more than 21 feet (6.5 meters) across — could unfold as soon as this weekend.</p>
<p>Launched in 1990, Hubble, which sees primarily visible light, has peered as far back as 13.4 billion years ago. Astronomers hope to close the gap with Webb, which is 100 times more powerful.</p>
<p>In another bit of good news Monday, officials said they expect Webb to last well beyond the originally anticipated 10 years based on its fuel efficiency.</p>
<div><div><h1>Ontario shuts schools, indoor dining, gyms amid infections</h1></div><div>By ROB GILLIESJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Premier Doug Ford also announced the closure of indoor dining. Gyms and cinemas will also close and hospitals have also been told to pause all non-urgent surgeries.</p>
<p>“We’re bracing for impact,” Ford said</p>
<p>Ford said they are expecting a “tsunami” of cases and noted just one percent of 100,000 new cases a day could overwhelm hospitals. Ontario has a population of more than 14.7 million.</p>
<p>“They had no choice,” said Dr. Andrew Morris, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Toronto and the medical director of the Antimicrobial Stewardship Program at Sinai-University Health Network. </p>
<p>“It was going to be brutal one way or the other. Show me who isn’t facing these realities? Anywhere?” he said.</p>
<p>“How does one add hospital capacity? You need add physicians and nurses, etc. They don’t just appear,” Morris said. </p>
<p>The reopening of schools has been delayed until at least Jan. 17. Just last week, the government announced schools would open on Wednesday. </p>
<p>Retail stores will be limited to 50% capacity in Ontario and indoor social gatherings will be capped at five people.</p>
<p>The new measures will begin Wednesday. </p>

<p>The search is focused on an area where a passer-by captured video of a burning shed on the day the fire began, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle told a news briefing. He said dozens of people have been interviewed thus far.</p>
<p>Experts from the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the U.S. Forest Service were participating in the investigation, Pelle said.</p>
<p>The sheriff declined to offer many more details on Monday, a day after saying that the fire “originated somewhere” in the neighborhood with the burning shed.</p>
<p>Declaring that ”the stakes are huge,” Pelle said he would not comment on the probe until he was ready “to announce some progress — perhaps that may be a week, perhaps that may be a month.”</p>
<p>Getting it right, he said, was “more important than the urge for speed that a lot of folks are feeling right now.”</p>
<p>No downed power lines were found in the area being investigated, according to the county’s Office of Emergency Management.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, teams continued searching Monday for two people who were still missing, and survivors sorted through the charred remnants of their homes to find whatever was left.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, authorities executed a search warrant, but the sheriff declined to elaborate and did not comment on whether he thought the fire was arson.</p>

<li><div><a><h4>Investigators narrow search for origin of Colorado wildfire</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>2 missing; survivors count blessings after Colorado fire</h4></a></div></li>
<p>In the search for the missing, crews were looking for a woman in the town of Superior and a man from the nearby community of Marshall. Pelle said the crews were sifting debris by hand and using small tools.</p>
<p>“When you get a pre-evac or evacuation notice, hop to it. The residents did, and most of them are with us today,” he said.</p>
<p>While homes that burned to the foundations were still smoldering in some places, the blaze was no longer considered an immediate threat — especially with frigid temperatures and a blanket of snow that fell Saturday.</p>
<p>The two towns are about 20 miles (30 kilometers) northwest of Denver and have a combined population of 34,000.</p>
<p>Among the homes that were still intact, utility crews went door to door to check if natural gas and electricity could be safely restored.</p>
<p>“Is there toxic fumes? Are we OK to move back in?” asked Nancy Alderson, who said she was worried about plastics and other materials consumed in the blaze.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, authorities distributed thousands of space heaters to families who endured several days of freezing temperatures inside homes spared by the fire.</p>
<p>Some of his neighbors weren’t so lucky. Down the street stood a row of burned homes.</p>
<p>“That just blows me away,” Johns said. “The houses aren’t there, and you can’t recognize your own block.”</p>
<div><div><h1>US close to ending buried nuke waste cleanup at Idaho site</h1></div><div>By KEITH RIDLERJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>BOISE, Idaho (AP) — A lengthy project to dig up and remove radioactive and hazardous waste buried for decades in unlined pits at a nuclear facility that sits atop a giant aquifer in eastern Idaho is nearly finished, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>The cleanup project, started in 2005, is named the Accelerated Retrieval Project and is one of about a dozen cleanup efforts of nuclear waste finished or ongoing at the Energy Department site. </p>

<li><div><a><h4>Slumping tech stocks weigh on SP 500 even as Dow gains</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The project involving the landfill is part of a 2008 agreement between the Energy Department and state officials that required the department to dig up and remove specific types and amounts of radioactive and hazardous material. </p>
<p>The agency said it removed about 13,500 cubic yards (10,300 cubic meters) of material — which is the equivalent of nearly 50,000 storage drums each containing 55 gallons (208 liters).</p>
<p>Most of the waste is being sent to the U.S. government’s Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico for permanent disposal. Some waste will be sent to other off-site repositories that could be commercial or Energy Department sites.</p>
<p>The Energy Department said it is 18 months ahead of schedule in its cleanup of the landfill.</p>
<p>Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson represents the area that benefits from millions of federal dollars brought into the state by research work done at the Idaho National Laboratory.</p>
<p>The report said contamination levels at all but a handful of nearly 180 wells are below acceptable standards for drinking water as set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>The nuclear site started operating in the late 1940s under the Atomic Energy Commission, a forerunner to the Energy Department, and contamination of the aquifer began in 1952, according to the U.S. Geological Survey report.</p>
<p>In 1989, the area became a Superfund site when it was was added to the National Priorities List for Uncontrolled Hazardous Waste Sites.</p>
<p>The Energy Department shipped nuclear waste to Idaho until a series of lawsuits between the state and the federal government in the 1990s led to a 1995 settlement agreement. </p>
<p>The agreement was seen as a way to prevent the state from becoming a high-level nuclear waste repository. It also required cleanup and removal of existing nuclear waste, which continues.</p>

<p>New York City, home of the nation’s largest school system, reopened classrooms to roughly 1 million students with a stockpile of take-home COVID-19 test kits and plans to double the number of random tests done in schools.</p>
<p>“We are going to keep our schools open and ensure that our children are in a safe environment,” newly sworn-in Mayor Eric Adams said.</p>
<p>New Yorker Trisha White said that she feels the risk is the same for her 9-year-old son in or out of school and that being with classmates is far better for him than remote learning.</p>

<p>New cases of COVID-19 in the city shot up from a daily average of about 17,000 in the week before the holidays to nearly 37,000 last week.</p>
<p>Across the U.S., new COVID-19 cases have tripled in the past two weeks to over 400,000 a day, the highest level on record, amid a rush by many Americans to get tested.</p>
<p>The high infection rates and resulting worker shortages are putting a heavy burden on employers large and small. Thousands of airline flights have been canceled in recent days, and many businesses have shelved return-to-work plans.</p>
<p>Dawn Crawley, CEO of House Cleaning Heroes, a cleaning service based in Herndon, Virginia, said she had to cancel four of 20 cleaning jobs for Tuesday because four employees were sick — three with COVID-19.</p>
<p>“The fear is it will run through the team” as well as customers, she said.</p>
<p>Policymakers and health authorities have been mindful of the toll on the economy and the education system. </p>
<p>Public heath experts have said that eradicating the virus is unlikely and that the world will instead have to find a way to keep COVID-19 down to an acceptable level, the way it does with the flu.</p>
<p>Syracuse, New York, canceled school Monday because of the increasing number of infections and a lack of substitute teachers.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, the 75,000-student Milwaukee school system is going back to virtual instruction Tuesday because of rising cases among staff members. The district said it is aiming to return to in-person classes Jan. 10.</p>

<p>The Peoria, Illinois, district extended winter break by a week.</p>

<p>The 49-year-old city councilor in Lowell, Massachusetts, was unanimously picked by his colleagues to assume the body’s top post Monday, in the process also becoming the city’s first Asian American mayor.</p>
<p>Today, the city of more than 115,000 residents is nearly 25% Asian and home to the nation’s second-largest Cambodian community.</p>
<p>“As a proud Cambodian American, I am standing on the shoulders of many immigrants who came before me to build this city,” Chau said Monday before a crowd that included his wife and two teenage sons. </p>

<p>In an interview later, Chau said he was around 9 years old when his family arrived in Pittsburgh with the help of the Catholic Church. They lived for a time in a convent and embraced Christianity.</p>
<p>They made their way to Lowell’s growing Cambodian community in the mid-1980s, where some of his older siblings immediately set to work in local manufacturing operations. </p>
<p>Before running for office, Chau said, he worked mostly in financial services, including running a mortgage lending company in Lowell with his wife. He now works for the Social Security Administration.</p>
<p>Chau’s election follows the ascendance of new Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan. She was sworn in last November as Boston’s first woman and first person of color elected to the post. </p>
<p>In fact, Long Beach, California, home to the nation’s largest Cambodian community, elected its first Cambodian American city councilor only in 2020, the organization noted. </p>
<p>Chau’s election also comes on the heels of a federal lawsuit that argued Lowell’s election process violated the voting rights of minority residents, who comprise nearly 50% of its population.</p>
<p>“Just four years ago, the city’s elected officials were all white and largely unresponsive to the needs of the city’s communities of color,” he said. </p>
<p>But he believes he can make a difference by ensuring the city workforce, including its police department and school system, better represents its diverse populace.</p>
<p>He also acknowledges his election is significant to the Cambodian diaspora. The community’s political dynamics <a>played a role</a> during the lead-up to Monday’s vote — his primary rival was a fellow Cambodian American councilor.</p>
<p>Chau says he tries to stay out of “old world politics” and intends to focus on the nuts and bolts of governance. But hopes he can inspire the next generation of Cambodian Americans to step up.</p>
<p>“We can no longer be just victims,” Chau said as he closed his inaugural remarks. “It is our time now to be leaders and to succeed.”</p>
<div><div><h1>Marine officer faces discharge over deadly training mishap</h1></div><div>January 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. (AP) — A Marine Corps panel convenes Tuesday to decide if an officer should be discharged over the sinking of an amphibious assault vehicle in the ocean off Southern California that killed nine service members.</p>
<p>If the Board of Inquiry, composed of three officers, determines Regner should be discharged, he could potentially lose retirement benefits and privileges. The hearing is expected to run up to four days.</p>
<p>A Marine Corps investigation found that inadequate training, shabby maintenance and poor judgment by leaders led to the sinking of a seafaring tank in one of the deadliest Marine training accidents in decades.</p>
<p>The amphibious assault vehicle had 16 people aboard when it sank rapidly in 385 feet (117 meters) of water. Seven Marines were rescued as the vessel was returning to a Navy ship on a training exercise.</p>
<p>Col. Christopher J. Bronzi, who supervised Regner, was relieved of command of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit last year.</p>
<p>It took 45 minutes for the tank to sink and if the distress signal had been seen sooner, it’s likely rescuers could have saved the troops, the report stated. But there were no safety boats nearby. </p>
<p>As the water levels continued rising, the troops who had only trained on land remained inside the broken-down tank in seas that were rougher than expected, according to the findings.</p>
<p>At least two of the troops had not completed their swimming certifications. </p>
<p>The emergency lights did not function and no markings were put on a side hatch, leaving troops scrambling in the dark, using their cell phone lights to find it, according to the findings. </p>
<p>Once they did, they struggled to open it, losing time. As they finally pried open the hatch, another assault vehicle came to rescue the crew and ended up colliding with the distressed vessel, which turned broadside into a wave that swept over it. </p>
<p>The troops were knocked off their feet and water flooded through the hatch and into the compartment, causing the vehicle to rapidly sink.</p>
<div><div><h1>Prince Andrew effort to toss sex assault suit hits roadblock</h1></div><div>By LARRY NEUMEISTERJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>Kaplan repeatedly shot down Brettler’s arguments or disputed them with other reasoning.</p>
<p>“So what?” Kaplan responded to one argument.</p>
<p>To another, he said: “I understand you are asserting that, but it doesn’t mean it’s correct.”</p>
<p>And to another: “Mr. Brettler, I understand your point. It just isn’t the law.”</p>
<p>When the hearing concluded, Kaplan promised a ruling soon and said he appreciated the “arguments and the passion.” The judge directed that the exchange of potential evidence in the case was to proceed as scheduled.</p>
<p>Virginia Giuffre sued the prince in August, saying she was coerced into sexual encounters with the prince in 2001 by Epstein and his longtime companion, Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
<p>Attorney David Boies, representing Giuffre, argued against dismissal of the lawsuit.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>'Substitute camera' sketches Ghislaine Maxwell trial beats</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Prince Andrew effort to toss sex assault suit hits roadblock</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Document Prince Andrew claims prevents lawsuit is released</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Judge orders charges dropped against Epstein jail guards</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The prince <a> has strenuously denied</a> Giuffre’s allegations.</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s arguments, Kaplan rejected Brettler’s assertion that Giuffre’s claims were too vague and that she failed to “articulate what happened to her at the hands of Prince Andrew.”</p>
<p>In the lawsuit and in interviews, Giuffre has said she was sexually abused by Andrew at Maxwell’s London home, at Epstein’s New York mansion and his estate in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The judge read aloud a portion of the lawsuit in which Giuffre alleged “involuntary sexual intercourse.”</p>
<p>“There isn’t any doubt what that means,” Kaplan said.</p>
<p>When Brettler continued his claim that the lawsuit lacked sufficient facts to be allowed to proceed toward trial, Kaplan reminded him that a judge is required to accept the assertions in a lawsuit as true at this stage of the case.</p>
<p>Under that deal, Giuffre agreed to release her claims against “potential defendants,” but the judge repeatedly disagreed with Brettler’s argument that wording prevented her from suing the prince.</p>
<p>Kaplan noted that there could be many interpretations of what constituted a potential defendant, and that the only parties who would know exactly what was intended were Giuffre and Epstein.</p>
<p>“This is an example where the word ‘potential’ is the use of a word to which you or I cannot find any meaning at all,” the judge said.</p>
<p>He also noted that the sealing of the terms of the settlement deal for a dozen years meant that anyone the parties might have intended to be protected against future lawsuits by Giuffre would never have known, since they couldn’t see it.</p>
<p>And Kaplan said that if Epstein’s lawyers wanted to prevent Giuffre from suing any person or entity involved in any way in sexual activity with Epstein or others, “it would have been easy to say it.”</p>

<p>Word on the fire’s cause could take weeks, Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle has warned. </p>
<p>Federal and state investigators have interviewed dozens of people, and their efforts are focused on an area near Boulder where a passer-by captured video of a burning shed on the day the fire began. </p>

<p>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — Officials in Alaska said Tuesday they are still attempting to identify a newborn that was found abandoned in a cardboard box on street corner in Fairbanks in frigid conditions on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>The child, known as Teshawn, continues to be in good health and in the care of the Office of Children’s Services, Alaska State Troopers said in a statement.</p>
<p>Troopers have taken a DNA sample and will submit it to a database as part of the ongoing effort to determine immediate family, the statement said.</p>
<p>Troopers have said they were notified about the abandoned baby Friday afternoon, when the wind chill factor was reported at minus 12.</p>
<p>A woman posted on social media that she found the baby. The post included included a video that showed a baby swaddled in a box and a note. </p>
<p>The note, written from the child’s perspective, said, “Please help me!!!”</p>
<p>The note indicated the child was born at 6 a.m. Friday, but added that the baby’s mother and grandparents didn’t have food or money to provide care.</p>
<p>The post was taken down or made private, and the person who posted it hasn’t responded to messages from The Associated Press.</p>
<p>The note found with the infant also said the child’s parents lived on a certain street in Fairbanks, but troopers on Tuesday said it’s entirely possible that the baby came “from a different location in the Fairbanks area.”</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO (AP) — The USS Abraham Lincoln deployed this week from San Diego under the command of Capt. Amy Bauernschmidt, the first woman to lead a nuclear carrier in U.S. Navy history. </p>
<p>Bauernschmidt, who previously served as the Abraham Lincoln’s executive officer from 2016 to 2019, took over command from Capt. Walt Slaughter during a ceremony last August, CBS 8 in San Diego reported. </p>

<p>Bauernschmidt previously served as the commanding officer of Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron 70 and the amphibious transport dock San Diego.</p>

<p>More than 20 other states allow concealed weapons in public without a permit — or what supporters call “constitutional carry,” according to Stateline, an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trusts. </p>
<a>In one ad</a>, he sat in a room full of guns and brandished a shotgun at an actor playing a suitor of one of his daughters.

<p>Perdue and another Republican challenging Kemp, Vernon Jones, criticized the governor ahead of Wednesday’s announcement.</p>
<p>Kemp’s draft remarks appear to clap back, saying the view that people have the right to carry a firearm without state approval “has recently become popular for others as we enter campaign season.” </p>
<p>Georgia currently requires people to obtain a license to carry a loaded handgun outside their own home, business, or car, although people can carry rifles and shotguns in many places without a permit and carry unloaded guns in cases. </p>

<p>Republican state Sen. Jason Anavitarte of Dallas, co-sponsor of one of the “constitutional carry” bills, said people want the policy passed.</p>
<p>“It’s our inherent Second Amendment right to carry without having a license,” he said.</p>
<p>One key question, if licenses are abolished, is what the state would do, if anything, to try to prevent convicted felons and people with mental illness from carrying handguns outside.</p>
<p>“This is incredibly dangerous to law enforcement to not know if the person carrying a weapon has been vetted at all,” she said. “It’s incredibly scary and frankly anti law enforcement.”</p>

<p>Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said the fire that destroyed almost 1,000 homes and damaged hundreds more stands as a warning: “When you get a pre-evac or evacuation notice, hop to it.”</p>
<p>“I’ve talked to dozens of people, even those whose houses burned down, and nobody seems to have received any kind of notification,” he said.</p>
<p>According to Everbridge, the company that created the notification system, more than half of households in the country rely entirely on cellphones and don’t have landlines. </p>

<p>Boulder County Commissioner Matt Jones, who was forced from his Louisville home, credited all of the law enforcement agencies and fire departments that converged on the area from across the state to help with the evacuation. </p>

<div><div><h1>Images of chaos: AP photographers capture US Capitol riot</h1></div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — When supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, The Associated Press had nine photographers inside and outside the building.</p>
<p>As the chaotic day unfolded, they shot hundreds of photos that were transmitted live within minutes, giving the world a front-row seat to the shocking events.</p>
<p>Julio Cortez, an AP photographer based in Baltimore, was in Washington, D.C., at the Trump outdoor rally in the morning and then headed to the Capitol ahead of the march, arriving just after 1 p.m. Here’s his account: </p>
<p>I did not wait for the end of the rally and decided to go with my teammate John Minchillo to the Capitol to get ahead of the crowd.</p>
<div>Full Coverage: Photography</div>
<p>The sights and sounds really struck me, and at the moment I thought, “This is it! The civil war is starting now.”</p>
<p>We tried really hard to get into the building, but I kept reminding myself that we had a very good team of photographers covering this event and had several photographers inside the building to provide images of what was going on there.</p>
<p>Eventually, the National Guard arrived and took control of the situation, which gave me some peace because I wasn’t sure what would happen once it got dark. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, AP photographer Andrew Harnik was inside the Capitol, covering Congress as he has for 18 years:</p>
<p>At about 2 p.m., I got a call from one of my editors. He said they were hearing things were intense on the east side of the Capitol and asked me to check it out but stay inside the building.</p>
<p>We have state-of-the-art digital cameras that can connect directly to wireless internet. I turned this feature on and began sending digital photos in real time back to our editors in Washington who would receive them and publish them.</p>
<p>As the room emptied out, Scotty didn’t budge, sitting all alone with his camera pointed at the standoff at the center door, shooting photos of the people trying to break in. </p>
<p>Hours later, I was able to get back into my office and found my laptop and bags just as I had left them. Congress still had hours of work ahead to finish the certification of the presidential election.</p>
<p>One of the most common questions I get about my experience is how I was feeling through all of this. Was I scared? Am I mad? Who do I blame for what happened?</p>
<p>When I think about the experience now, almost a year later, I think the thing that stays with me is the “what if” questions. Things could have easily gone a different way and more people could have been hurt. </p>
<p>For those of us who were there that day, and many watching across the country and the world, we have all been changed forever by the experience.</p>

<p>MOSCOW (AP) — Russian authorities on Thursday designated a member of the Pussy Riot punk group, a satirist and an art collector as “foreign agents,” part of efforts to stifle dissent.</p>
<p>The Justice Ministry applied the label to Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a Pussy Riot member who became widely known for taking part in a 2012 protest inside Moscow’s Christ the Savior Cathedral after which she spent nearly two years in prison.</p>
<p>Journalist and satirist Viktor Shenderovich and art collector Marat Gelman were also handed the label along with several other people. </p>
<p>Those designated as “foreign agents” are required to add a lengthy statement to news reports, social media posts and other materials specifying that the content was created by a “foreign agent.”</p>

<p>The sex-trafficking trial of Jeffrey Epstein’s former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, ended with a guilty verdict, but that hasn’t stopped the flow of false news that has swirled around the case.</p>
<p>Maxwell was found guilty on five of six counts at the conclusion of the monthlong trial where she was accused of helping Epstein sexually exploit teenage girls.</p>
<p>Here are some of the claims that spread online, and the facts you need to know about them:</p>

<p>CLAIM: The judge in the Ghislaine Maxwell case issued a media-wide gag order over the trial with no livestream to keep scandalous details from leaking out to the public.</p>
<p>THE FACTS: Members of the media were allowed to watch Maxwell’s trial. But federal courts do not allow cameras like some state courts do, and the discrepancy fueled confusion and conspiracy theories on social media.</p>
<p>CLAIM: Documents unsealed before the trial began showed a list of defendants, including some celebrities, who were named as “co-conspirators” in the case.</p>

<p>CLAIM: The CEOs of Twitter, Walmart and CNBC all resigned on the first day of the Ghislaine Maxwell trial.</p>
<p>THE FACTS: Twitter’s CEO did step down on that Monday, but in his Nov. 29 announcement, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said he would remain on the board until his term expires in 2022.</p>
<p>CNBC does not have a CEO and its chair did not resign. Nor did the CEO of Walmart, although the company said its chief financial officer would be stepping down — but not leaving the company until 2023.</p>

<p>Moncus Park currently includes a dog park, a fully stocked catch-and-release fishing pond and 2 miles of walking trails. Future plans include an inclusive playground, splash pad, amphitheater, veterans memorial and treehouse.</p>
<p>As those are finished, they’ll get their own ribbon cuttings. </p>

<p>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) — Atlantic City’s casinos are forging ahead with ambitious new projects in 2022, even as the coronavirus pandemic continues to make it harder to do business.</p>
<p>And non-casino projects involving family entertainment, education and the offshore wind industry will take flight in the new year.</p>
<p>But challenges lurk, as well.</p>
<p>A law passed signed by Gov. Phil Murphy in December gives the casinos some relief from big increases in payments they were due to pay to Atlantic City, Atlantic County and the schools system in lieu of property taxes.</p>
<p>A big unknown is how long and how seriously the COVID19 pandemic, and particularly the fast-spreading omicron variant, will affect customers’ willingness to come out and gamble in person in 2022.</p>
<p>And a big challenge is right around the corner when New York begins allowing people to bet on phones or other mobile devices anywhere in the state, as soon as January but almost certainly in time for the Super Bowl in February. </p>
<p>Gambling industry executives and analysts expect New Jersey to lose at least 20% of its sports betting volume as New York residents who formerly had to cross over into New Jersey to bet will be able to do it at or close to home.</p>
<p>Mark Giannantonio, president of Resorts casino, said he is “tremendously optimistic for a great year” in 2022.</p>
<p>The Ocean Casino Resort plans to begin a $75 million project in spring or summer to finish 12 floors of hotel rooms that were never completed when the casino first opened as Revel in 2012.</p>
<p>Bally’s will unveil 750 renovated hotel rooms, a redone hotel lobby and bar, and an indoor-outdoor entertainment venue in 2022.</p>
<p>A $100 million indoor water park to be built next to the former Showboat casino, which now operates as a nongambling hotel, plans a ground breaking for early 2022.</p>
<p>Atlantic City will host a three-day country music concert on the beach in August headlined by Luke Bryan and Morgan Wallen.</p>
<p>Construction is to begin in 2022 on a new ShopRite supermarket in Atlantic City, designed to end the city’s status as a “food desert” without a major supermarket. The project should open in 2023.</p>
<p>Stockton University hopes to complete a new student residence hall in the city in 2022.</p>
<p>And a plan that has gotten little attention outside of Atlantic City but which will affect most visitors to the city is due to begin in 2022.</p>
<p>The city plans to reduce Atlantic Avenue, one of its two main north-south thoroughfares, from two lanes in each direction to one lane in each direction, in the name of pedestrian safety.</p>
<p>But many residents and businesses oppose the plan, predicting that traffic that is already difficult to navigate under current conditions will become even worse with only one lane in each direction.</p>
