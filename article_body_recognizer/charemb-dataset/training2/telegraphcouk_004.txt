<h1> Nearly half of new ‘Covid’ patients were admitted to hospital for other reasons </h1>
<p> Figures show NHS being 'crippled' by outdated infection protocols and surge in people who incidentally test positive for virus on wards </p>
<div> <div> By Laura Donnelly, Health Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 10:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Almost half the surge in Covid hospital patients before the new year involves those admitted for other reasons, analysis has suggested.</p>
<p>It comes as more than 20 NHS trusts declared critical incidents, with warnings that hospitals are becoming “crippled” by outdated infection protocols.</p>
<p>Latest weekly data shows that 45 per cent of the increase in coronavirus numbers in hospital can be attributed to “incidental” cases, where Covid-19 was not the primary reason for admission. </p>
<p>The data for the week ending December 28 shows that, in some regions, as much as 66 per cent of the rise was driven by cases who ended up in hospital for other reasons but happened to test positive. </p>
<p>They include those who caught Covid on the wards while receiving their treatment.</p>
<h2>What do the statistics show?</h2>
<p>The weekly figures, due to be updated Friday, <a>track the total number of Covid patients</a> in hospitals in England and those who are classed as “primarily” being treated because of the virus. </p>
<p>Between December 21 and 28, the total number rose from 6,245 to 8,321 in England. Since then it has continued rising, with latest daily figures showing 15,569 cases in hospital beds.</p>
<p>However in the South East, 66 per cent of the rise stems from cases which were primarily non-Covid. The figure was 51 per cent in East of England and 48 per cent in London.</p>
<p>In the Midlands, 44 per cent of the rise comes from incidental cases, while in the North West it is 40 per cent, in the North East and Yorkshire it is 33 per cent and Yorkshire and in the South West it is just two per cent.</p>
<p>It means thousands of patients who are being counted as coronavirus admissions are not actually suffering seriously with the virus.</p>
<p>Because the figures track total Covid numbers in hospital - which means admissions are offset by discharges - they do not directly track the number of admissions which are assessed as “primary” cases of covid.</p>
<p>But they give an insight into a sharpening trend.</p>
<p>The latest published figures already show that on December 28, one-third of patients in hospital were “primarily” there for other reasons - up from a quarter just weeks earlier. </p>
<p>New statistics published on Friday are likely to show thousands more “incidental” cases in hospitals.</p>
<p>Experts say the trends are another sign that the <a>omicron wave is milder than previous surges</a>. </p>
<p>Downing Street said on Wednesday that more than 20 trusts have now declared a critical incident, the alert level where priority services may be under threat.</p>
<p>The figure represents about one in seven NHS acute trusts, while others have taken steps to postpone non-urgent surgery.</p>
<p>Hospitals in Plymouth, Bristol, Norfolk, Suffolk, Dorset and Bath are among those declaring critical incidents, amid widespread shortages of staff.</p>
<p>Trusts in Lancashire, Lincoln and Blackpool have already declared alerts in recent days.</p>
<p>It comes after non-urgent care and operations were halted at 17 hospitals across Greater Manchester on Tuesday, amid rising cases and staff off sick.</p>
<h2>'Outdated' infection rules criticised</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, infection experts said hospitals were still forced to adhere to “outdated” infection rules which they said were “crippling” hospitals.</p>
<p>Under current protocols, NHS patients deemed to have been in “close contact” with a confirmed Covid case have to be treated in isolation for 14 days, or for the length of their hospital stay.</p>
<p>The rule applies if the patient is discharged to a care home - they must be isolated for the remainder of the 14-day period.</p>
<p>Pat Cattini, an infection control nurse and former president of the Infection Prevention Society, called on health officials to make urgent changes to the rules, which medics said were having a “devastating” impact on bed capacity.</p>
<p>"This guidance has never changed despite vaccination and changing epidemiology and is crippling healthcare," she said.</p>
<p>"This is a huge driver of bed pressure."</p>
<p>The UK Health Security Agency said the rules are now under review.</p>
<p>He said the situation was still more difficult, because care homes are not allowed to take patients back until they are out of the 14-day window - further delaying discharge.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the UK Health Security Agency said: “The current guidance is in place to help limit the spread of Covid-19 to vulnerable people and NHS staff. </p>
<p>"We continue to work in partnership with NHS England and Improvement to review the guidance and will make changes where appropriate.”</p>

<header> <h1> Three times as many migrants crossed Channel in 2021 than previous year </h1> <p> Record-breaking 28,381 people made perilous journey across the world’s busiest shipping lane this year </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 31 December 2021 • 7:59pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Three times as many migrants crossed the channel in 2021 compared to the previous year with the equivalent of 78 people making the journey each day.</p>
<p>A record-breaking 28,381 migrants made the perilous journey across the world’s busiest shipping lane last year - dwarfing the 8,410 who made the same treacherous trip in 2020.</p>
<p>They came in at least 1,020 boats which were intercepted by UK authorities in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>It means the equivalent of around 78 migrants arrived across three boats every day.</p>
<p>By far the busiest month came in November when 6,869 people arrived on British shores in 201 boats.</p>
<p>That is more than any previous months since the small boat crisis in the Channel began.</p>
<p>It also saw a daily record for crossings on November 11 when 1,185 migrants arrived in 33 boats.</p>
<p>November 24 also brought the gravest tragedy in the Channel for migrant crossing deaths.</p>
<p>At least 27 <a>men, women and children all died</a> after their rapidly deflating dinghy with a broken motor sank in the freezing cold waters.</p>
<p>Only two people are known to have survived the largest loss of life since the current crisis began.</p>
<p>Despite the tragedy highlighting the dangers of crossing the 21-mile Dover Strait in unsuitable craft, migrants continued to arrive in <a>high numbers throughout December</a>.</p>
<p>Some 1,770 people made the trip in 57 boats in the last month of the year- compared to 211 in the year previously.</p>
<p>Double that figure arrived on December 16 alone - when 559 made the journey in 19 boats.</p>
<p>Despite the year starting off relatively quietly for Channel crossings, figures topped 1,000 for the first time in May when 1,619 arrived in 80 boats.</p>
<p>Warm weather in the summer saw more record-breaking months.</p>
<p>A total of 2,179 arrived in 92 boats in June, 3,509 came in 117 boats in July, 3,012 made the treacherous trip on 110 boats in August and a whopping 4,646 made the same journey in 159 boats in September.</p>
<p>October also saw 2,669 migrants arrive in 92 boats as calm conditions at sea continued.</p>
<p>Dover and Deal MP Natalie Elphicke said taxpayers’ money spent on strengthening UK borders instead of footing the bill for the increasing number of Channel migrant arrivals.</p>
<h2>'Massive increase is unacceptable'</h2>
<p>She said: "Over 28,000 migrants arrived across the English Channel in 2021. This is a simply shocking situation.</p>
<p>"It is a massive increase from previous years. This is not only unacceptable, it is incredibly expensive.</p>
<p>"It's not right that taxpayers will be footing the bill this year, and for years to come in assessing claims, emergency housing and more besides.</p>
<p>"Hardworking taxpayers deserve a better deal. Money would be better spent strengthening our borders.</p>
<p>"It's high time to stop the small boat crossings - by stopping the boats leaving in the first place, turning boats back to France and making swift returns.</p>
<p>"People are already safe in France, there is no reason to be making this dangerous journey in the hands of people smugglers."</p>

<h1> Only ‘small proportion’ of Channel migrant boats will be turned back </h1>
<p> Priti Patel’s ‘pushback’ tactics will only be used ‘if it can be done in a safe and legal way’, says Home Office permanent secretary </p>
<div> <div> By Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor <time> 22 September 2021 • 6:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Priti Patel's top civil servant has admitted that only a "small proportion" of migrant boats will be turned back in the Channel as he downplayed the potential impact of the new tactics.</p>
<p>Matthew Rycroft, the Home Office permanent secretary, refused to say what proportion would be <a>turned back by Border Force officers on jet skis</a>, but said it was closer to one per cent than 49 per cent.</p>
<p>Asked in what circumstances the "pushback" tactics would be deployed, Mr Rycroft told MPs on the home affairs committee that they would only be used "if it can be done in a safe and legal way".</p>
<p>He said: "In addition to that, it also requires decision-makers to decide that it is available to be deployed if circumstances are met.</p>
<p>Ms Patel, the Home Secretary, has secured legal advice for Border Force vessels to start <a>redirecting migrant boats away from UK waters</a> and back towards France, where the French will have to return them to shore.</p>
<p>France, however, has claimed the change in tactic – where Border Force officers on jet skis swarm a boat – is a breach of trust, illegal under maritime laws and a threat to life.</p>
<p>The Border Force union and former chiefs of the service have warned that it could lead to loss of life, as smugglers might use counter-tactics such as sinking their boats, and claimed it is unlikely to be deployed.</p>
<p>Border Force has told ministers it will be able to deploy "turnarounds" only when it deems them safe and that use is likely to be restricted to sturdier, bigger migrant boats and only in "very limited circumstances".</p>
<p>Because of the concerns, Ms Patel will speak to Border Force vessel commanders to confirm that she will fully support them in their decision to deploy the tactics whenever they assess that they can.</p>
<p>Mr Rycroft told MPs it would be "perverse" for him to reveal precisely when the tactics might be used as "that would shape the behaviour of people crossing the Channel, and that's the last thing we want to do".</p>
<header> <h1> Priti Patel plans Greek-style clampdown on migrants </h1> <p> Asylum seekers will have to obey strict rules at new holding centres or face their claims to stay in UK being rejected </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor ; James Crisp, Europe Editor and Mike Wright <time> 19 November 2021 • 10:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Priti Patel is planning a Greek-style crackdown on migrants, with new restrictions on asylum seekers amid <a>an escalating European crisis</a>.</p>
<p><a>Channel migrants</a> held in new purpose-built reception centres will have to obey strict rules or risk losing their right to claim asylum. </p>
<p>The Home Secretary plans to model <a>the centres</a> on the camps for asylum seekers being built by Greece, where migrants face routine checks on their movements along with curfews to prevent absconding.</p>
<p>Migrants could also be issued with "asylum apps" to track the progress of their applications on smartphones or computers in the centres. </p>
<p>Ms Patel has been impressed by the way in which Greece has digitised its <a>asylum application</a> process from start to finish to track cases, speed up decisions and save millions on unnecessary paperwork.</p>
<a>attempted bombing in Liverpool</a> by a failed asylum seeker who was still in the UK seven years after his application was first rejected. Emad al-Swealmeen is understood to have had mental health problems that were exacerbated by the drawn-out process.
<p>Speaking on a trip to the US, Ms Patel hailed Greece for taking a "very different" approach to that of the EU, including the controversial "pushback" tactics of <a>turning boats back</a> at sea.</p>
<a>a record surge in illegal Channel crossings</a>.
<a>in November</a>, the highest monthly total ever, despite colder weather and riskier sea conditions.
<p>"We will not just throw open the doors and let the migrants in," he said. "EU leaders know that if that happens then Schengen is finished. Freedom of movement is finished. </p>
<p>"Countries such as Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and others will simply throw up the borders. We need strong external borders."</p>
<a>to the borders with EU members Poland, Latvia and Lithuania</a>. The situation on the border with Poland has reached crisis point in the last fortnight.
<p>It came as Emmanuel Macron, the French president, on Friday accused Britain of swinging "between partnership and provocation" over the flow of Channel migrants.</p>
<p>Speaking in northern France, Mr Macron said he would seek closer co-operation with the EU to stem the flow towards the coast but that there was a problem between London and Paris.</p>
<a> "We need to further strengthen collaboration.</a> If those who want to join Britain have family there, it must be part of a family reunification. If they are smuggled, we have to break this system.
<p>"We must take several actions – prevent the establishment of lasting camps, act to dismantle the smuggling networks and strengthen work with the countries of origin to prevent these flows."</p>
<p>British officials are concerned, however, at the failure of France to deploy specialist forces to the northern coast as they did in 2015, when 3,500 elite Compagnie Republicaine de Securite with mobile hit squads were on the ground.</p>
<p>Only 200 extra reserve gendarme officers have been deployed so far under <a>the £54 million deal between the UK and France</a> to boost patrols and surveillance on northern French beaches.</p>
<h1> Priti Patel sanctions ‘pushback’ tactics to turn away migrant boats at sea </h1>
<p> Home Secretary on collision course with France after securing legal advice to redirect vessels stopped in English Channel back to continent </p>
<div> <div> By Charles Hymas, Home Affairs Editor <time> 9 September 2021 • 6:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Priti Patel has sanctioned the use of controversial “pushback” tactics to intercept and turn round migrants’ small boats mid-Channel to prevent them reaching the UK.</p>
<p>The Home Secretary has secured legal advice for Border Force vessels to start redirecting migrant boats away from UK waters and back towards France, where the French will have to return them to shore.</p>
<p>Sea training by Border Force, and overseen by the Royal Marines, is due to conclude this month, weather permitting. Sources said that the tactics were ready to deploy as soon as practical and safe.</p>
<p>Because of the concerns, Ms Patel will speak to the Border Force vessel commanders to confirm she will fully support them in their decision to deploy the tactics whenever they assess they can.</p>
<p>They are similar to “turnarounds” or “pushbacks” deployed by Australia and Greece which Ms Patel visited this summer on a fact-finding mission and which have sparked lawsuits over alleged breaches of human rights.</p>
<p>She is threatening to pull the plug on the <a>UK’s £54 million payment to France</a> to combat the migrants, unless the French increase the proportion of migrants they stop from one in two to three in four by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The French are thought to be maintaining their opposition to the new approach and are still refusing to take back or intercept migrants at sea unless they ask to be rescued. The French interior ministry declined to comment on Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Migrant figures set to surpass 14,000</h3>
<a>785 migrants on Monday</a>, the second highest daily total this year after 828.
<p>Natalie Elphicke, the MP for Dover, welcomed the new tactics: “Turning back boats sends the clearest message that enough is enough. Illegal migration that puts lives at risk will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>“I have been calling for this fresh approach which, along with stopping the boats leaving and effective returns, could finally bring an end to the small boats crisis.”</p>
<p>However, Tim Loughton, the MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, and a member of the Commons home affairs committee, said he was “highly sceptical” and warned it could lead to casualties for which the UK would be blamed.</p>
<p>“These are the flimsiest of boats at the best of times. If you have Border Force vessels coming alongside, they could be overwhelmed,” he said.</p>
