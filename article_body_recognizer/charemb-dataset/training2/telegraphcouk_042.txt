<p>Before her death Mrs Lockley revealed to her daughter, Jenny, how she had been trained to “kill and maim and cause as much damage to the enemy as possible”.</p>
<p>Another female recruit was 18-year-old Pricilla Ross from Hornchurch, east London, who signed up to the resistance in 1940.</p>
<p>Her daughter, Susan, described how she was highly skilled in archery and fencing and was also a very accomplished horsewoman.</p>
<p>Like Mrs Lockley, she was taught unarmed combat and how to make Molotov cocktails as well as being trained in communication techniques.</p>
<p>Her cell operated out of a base under a local church with the entrance hidden under a sliding tombstone in the graveyard.</p>
<p>Teenage boys were also recruited and, in one case, four youngsters who were the best shots in their school cadet corps were selected as snipers.</p>
<p>They were given cover stories that they were training as Home Guard messengers but instead received sophisticated training in the art of marksmanship, disguise and deception.</p>
<p>As well as arousing less suspicion than older recruits, teenagers were selected because the “naivety of youth” meant they needed little motivation to want to take on the invader.</p>
<p>Researchers have been unable to ascertain just how many teenagers were selected to join the resistance because the secretive nature of the plans meant there were no official records kept.</p>
<p>But piecing together anecdotal evidence from the families of those involved it is clear Britain was well prepared to put up a fight from within should the country ever be invaded.</p>
<p>Andrew Chatterton, the author of Britain's Secret Defences: Civilian Saboteurs, Spies and Assassins, which is due to be published this year, said details of the UK’s wartime resistance movement had long been shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>But he said it was clear the civilian population was well prepared to repel any foreign invader should the need arise.</p>
<p>He said: "In the Summer of 1940 SIS (AKA MI6) was beginning to recruit 'cells' of civilians, who would lay low during any German invasion </p>
<p>of Britain and only come out to 'act' after an occupation of this country had started.</p>
<p>"Those recruited tended to be those in reserved occupation or too young or too old to be called up to the regular forces and - unlike other civilian groups being brought together to actively take on a German force - included women and girls.</p>
<p>“Teenagers tended to make good recruits as they were naive enough to carry out actions without thinking too much about the consequences as well as being fit and active.</p>
<p>“However, as we saw in mainland Europe any acts of sabotage or information gathering against the German occupying force was extraordinarily dangerous, both for those carrying out these tasks and the local population.</p>
<p>"All of these civilians signed the Official Secrets Act or were sworn to secrecy and almost all of their secrets went to the grave.</p>
<p>“Make no bones about it, these brave British civilians were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the country during what undoubtedly would have been its darkest hours.”</p>
<p>Britain's Secret Defences: Civilian Saboteurs, Spies and Assassins will be published this year </p>

<header> <h1> Geoff Hoon: I was told to burn memo that said Iraq invasion could be illegal </h1> <p> Tony Blair’s defence chief points to cover-up after he claims he was instructed to destroy secret note on war </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 5 January 2022 • 12:39am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Geoff Hoon claims he was ordered by Downing Street to burn a secret memo that said the 2003 invasion of Iraq could be illegal.</p>
<p>The instruction came from Jonathan Powell, Sir Tony Blair's chief of staff, Mr Hoon claims. </p>
<p>Mr Powell denies the allegation.</p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith is said to have written the memo in 2003 and said the conflict could be challenged under international law.</p>
<p>When the burn allegation first emerged in 2015, Sir Tony's office described it as "nonsense".</p>
<p>But Mr Hoon's recollections, which appear in his recently published memoir, See How They Run, could bolster the campaign to strip Sir Tony of his knighthood. </p>
<p>He was made a Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter in the New Year's Honours, some 14 years after he left Downing Street.</p>
<p>An online petition for him to have the honour rescinded - which criticises his constitutional changes and <a>his foreign policy decisions over the Iraq and Afghanistan wars</a> - has been signed more than 540,000 times.</p>
<p>Speaking on Tuesday morning ahead of a key speech outlining Labour's vision for the coming year, Sir Keir <a>was asked whether Mr Blair's knighthood was a "thorny" issue</a>.</p>
<p>"But the one I would pick out in particular is the work he did in Northern Ireland, and the peace process, and the huge change that has made.</p>
<p>"I worked myself in Northern Ireland for six years with the police service over there and I saw for myself the profound impact on peace, on both communities in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>"So I don't think it's thorny at all, I think he deserves the honour. Obviously I respect the fact that people have different views."</p>
<a>a "kick in the teeth" for the people of Iraq and Afghanistan</a>. Lindsey German, convenor of the Stop the War Coalition, said she was "amazed" to hear the former prime minister had been rewarded.
<header> <h1> Milestone for Royal Navy as HMS Montrose spends 1,000 days at sea </h1> <p> Warship has been on operations continuously since April 2019, as tensions in the Gulf require ‘persistent presence’ </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Dominic Nicholls, Defence and Security Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:07pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A Royal Navy warship has reached a record 1,000 days at sea as tensions in the Gulf require a “persistent” presence.</p>
<p>HMS Montrose, a Type 23 frigate, has been on operations in the Gulf region continuously since April 11 2019.</p>
<p>The ship, with 200 sailors and Royal Marines on board, has worked with other British and allied vessels to counter what the Ministry of Defence (MoD) says are “regional challenges” from Iran.</p>
<p>The frigate has safeguarded shipping, kept sea lanes open and stopped drug trafficking in waters stretching to the Horn of Africa.</p>
<p>Commodore Ed Ahlgren, the senior Royal Navy officer in the region said: “I am delighted to mark 1,000 days of HMS Montrose in theatre.</p>
<p>“She has had many successes whilst in the region, including narcotics seizures and maintaining free and safe passage for shipping around three of the busiest trade chokepoints in the world.”</p>
<p>HMS Montrose is part of a Royal Navy trial to deploy <a>major warships</a> around the world for several years at a time, with crews being flown to and from the UK.</p>
<p>Patrol ships have since been committed to the Caribbean, Mediterranean and, most recently, Asia-Pacific region on extended missions.</p>
<h2>‘Immensely proud’</h2>
<p>Commander Claire Thompson, Commanding Officer of Montrose’s Starboard Crew, who are in charge of the ship until spring, said: “I am immensely proud of what both crews have achieved during the past three years.</p>
<p>“Our enduring presence in this region has shown the commitment the UK has to ensure the stability and security of the Gulf region along with our allies.</p>
<p>“This couldn’t be achieved without the commitment of our personnel and their support from their families back home.”</p>
<p>The Royal Navy’s support facility at the Bahraini port of Mina Salman, opened in 2018, has enabled warships to operate for longer in the region without having to return to Britain every six months for routine maintenance.</p>
<p>The Royal Navy said the new crewing model has been designed to “spare warships the lengthy passage to and from Britain, time which could be spent on patrol in the Middle East”.</p>
<p>HMS Montrose is the first major warship to adopt the dual-crew rotational manning model.</p>
<p>Retired Royal Navy Commander Tom Sharpe said the new system was cheaper and allowed the crews to work harder when deployed for “short bursts”.</p>
<p>“Tasking has not got narrower just because they’re there for longer,” he told the Telegraph.</p>
<p>“The fuel that would be used to and from the UK is wasted fuel; there's a lot of fuel going into just getting the ship home.</p>
<p>“We must get away from the old model of thinking only a permanent ship’s company provides cohesion.</p>
<p>“This is not lessening the value of the cap badge.”</p>
<p>Last year’s Defence Command Paper, the most recent MoD strategy, said: “to pursue our foreign policy objectives…we will rebalance our force to provide a more proactive, forward deployed, persistent presence”.</p>
<a>Sir Tony Radakin</a> was made Chief of the Defence Staff last year - are reviewing the manning model to see if the experience from HMS Montrose represented “best practice”.
<p>“The new First Sea Lord (Admiral Sir Ben Key) must make a decision soon on how much further this model is deployed,” he said.</p>

<header> <h1> One-hour operation could cure prostate cancer by destroying tumours with electric currents </h1> <p> Pioneering treatment has been used to treat the disease for the first time on the NHS, and may offer hope to thousands of men </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Laura Donnelly, Health Editor <time> 2 January 2022 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Prostate cancer could be cured with a "game-changing" one-hour operation that uses electric currents to destroy the most difficult to reach tumours.</p>
<p>The pioneering treatment has been used to treat the disease for the first time on the NHS, with surgeons saying the breakthrough could offer hope to thousands of men.</p>
<p>One in six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime, with more than 50,000 cases detected a year. </p>
<p>Treatments offered normally involve surgery to remove the prostate or radiotherapy, both of which can cause <a>distressing side-effects</a>.</p>
<p>Surgeons said the new therapy, called Nanoknife – which has now been used to treat prostate cancer patients by University College London Hospital (UCLH) – was "amazingly simple and quick", reducing the chance of a host of side effects.</p>
<p>Charities said up to 20,000 men a year diagnosed with localised disease could be helped by more targeted treatments, calling for more research so that the use of such methods can be expanded. </p>
<a>backlogs of patients needing treatment</a>. Diagnoses of prostate cancer fell by almost a quarter during the pandemic, with research suggesting around 15,000 "missing" cases and widespread delays in starting treatment. 
<a>loss of sexual function</a>.
<p>Prof Emberton, one of the country's leading prostate surgeons, said that gave it the potential to become a standard treatment for the disease. </p>
<h2>Treatments could help tackle cancer backlog</h2>
<p>Targeted treatments, also known as "focal" therapies, which also include the freezing technique cryotherapy and focused ultrasound, are currently only available in major specialist centres.</p>
<a>a huge cancer backlog</a>, adding: "It's an amazing treatment, so quick, and it means we can reach tumours that are beyond where the knife can reach."
<p>Because the treatment can be done as a day case and in less than an hour, surgeons can carry out at least twice as many procedures in the time it would normally take to do one traditional operation, and without a hospital stay. </p>
<p>"At times like this, when the NHS is under great pressure, day surgery avoids the need for overnight stays in hospital and means that we can use our operating theatres more efficiently," Prof Emberton said. </p>
<h2>Surrounding healthy cells ‘left untouched and preserved’ </h2>
<p>Nanoknife, manufactured by AngioDynamics, works by administering quick electrical pulses, using electrodes, around the tumour to kill the cancerous cells. </p>
<p>Guided by MRI scanning, the short ulses can be targeted to the right area, and surrounding healthy cells are left untouched and preserved, experts said. </p>
<p>"This could make a big difference to the quality of life of men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer, and it now needs to be tested in much larger trials to see whether it is as effective as traditional treatments."</p>
<p>The UCLH team has now carried out six procedures, with 70-year-old Neil Gershon among those receiving the treatment on the first day.</p>
<p>Surgeons said the effectiveness appeared similar to other targeted treatments, while side-effects compared favourably. </p>
<h1> ‘Super stranded’ patients take up 3,000 more NHS hospital beds in a year </h1>
<p> Drive to free up spaces for urgent care in peril as number of patients stuck on wards for at least three weeks exceeds Christmas 2020 figure </p>
<div> <div> By Laura Donnelly, Health Editor <time> 3 January 2022 • 9:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>At least 3,000 more NHS beds are being taken up by “super stranded” patients compared with last year, official figures show, despite pledges to free up hospital space to cope with a surge in Covid cases.</p>
<p>Hospitals were told to ensure as many patients as possible could be safely discharged before Christmas, in order to help the health service prepare for the threat from omicron.</p>
<p>However, the latest data show that on December 24, there were 14,338 patients in England who <a>had been stuck on wards</a> for at least three weeks.</p>
<p>The figure is more than 3,000 higher than the 11,245 recorded in Christmas 2020, when hospitals were treating more than twice as many patients with coronavirus.</p>
<p>Charities said that elderly people were being left on hospital wards for weeks and even months, <a>for want of social care</a>, in a situation that had become an “emergency” in many parts of the country.</p>
<p>The news came as NHS chiefs are scrambling to open up to 4,000 extra beds, assembling “Nightingale hubs” to cope with rising hospitalisations from Covid.</p>
<p>Charities said that far too many frail and elderly people were being left <a>stuck on hospital wards</a> because of a <a>growing social care crisis</a>, now being exacerbated by Covid-related staff absences.</p>
<p>The latest data also show that on Christmas Eve, a total of 8,983 patients were stuck in hospital despite having been assessed and <a>found to be fit for discharge</a>. Those included 3,827 patients who had been there for at least three weeks.</p>
<p>Health officials have repeatedly promised action to free up more beds, to prepare for a potentially significant increase in Covid-19 hospitalisations.</p>
<p>In Christmas 2020, the NHS was dealing with more than twice as many Covid patients as 2021, with more than 18,000 in total in hospital, compared with about 7,000 last month.</p>
<p>Over the past week, the total number of Covid cases in hospital has risen further, to 14,210.</p>
<p>However, the numbers requiring ventilation has remained stable, with 769 such cases in England, compared with more than 2,000 in 2020.</p>
<p>She said omicron had proved “the straw that has broken the camel’s back”, causing many staff to go off sick.</p>
<p>NHS figures show that on the week ending December 26 2021, there were 9,288 patients in hospital despite being medically fit for discharge – an improvement on the previous week, when it was 10,576.</p>
<p>Separate statistics showed that the number of days lost to Covid staff absence rose by 42 per cent in the week ending December 26 compared with the week before.</p>
<h1> Number of children admitted to hospital for eating disorders surges 70 per cent since pandemic </h1>
<p> Psychiatrists warn they are unable to keep up with numbers needing help, as repeated lockdowns fuel ‘hidden epidemic’ </p>
<div> <div> By Laura Donnelly, Health Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The number of children being admitted to hospital with eating disorders has risen almost 70 per cent since the pandemic, official figures show, with psychiatrists warning they are unable to keep up with the numbers needing help.</p>
<p>Charities warned that those admitted to hospital were only the “tip of the iceberg” as the vast majority of those suffering eating disorders do not receive care as an inpatient.</p>
<p>The NHS provisional data show 4,238 hospital admissions for children aged 17 and under between April and October last year. The figure is a 69 per cent rise compared with the same months before the pandemic, when there were just 2,508 admissions.</p>
<p>Overall, the data show there were 23,302 admissions for eating disorders among all age groups in the financial year 2020/21, up 21 per cent on the 19,244 admissions among all age groups recorded in 2018/19.</p>
<p>Provisional data for April to October 2021 show there were 15,941 admissions so far among all age groups, suggesting 2021/22 will be the highest year yet for those of all ages.</p>
<h2>Many services ‘over-stretched’</h2>
<a>many community services now over-stretched</a> and unable to treat the sheer number of people needing help.
<p>“We are at the point where we cannot afford to let this go on any longer.</p>
<p>“Early intervention is key to recovery and to preventing serious illness, which is why it’s crucial that the money announced by Government urgently reaches the frontline.</p>
<p>“The Government must also deliver a workforce plan to tackle the shortages in eating disorder services so that they have enough staff to treat everyone who needs help.</p>
<p>“All healthcare professionals must be trained in recognising early signs of eating disorders to ensure both children and adults can access specialist support as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>Eating disorders are characterised by eating too much or too little, being obsessed with weight or body shape, excessive exercise, having strict food routines and/or deliberate vomiting after eating.</p>
<p>The most common types of eating disorders are <a>anorexia</a>, bulimia and binge-eating disorder.</p>
<p>The new NHS data show that 5,941 admissions (among all ages) from April to October 2021 were for anorexia. The next biggest set of admissions, at 3,263, were for bulimia.</p>
<p>The latest figures also show that hospital admissions are most common in adults aged 18 to 39, with 8,298 in this age group from April to October 2021.</p>
<p>There are also regional differences, with the South East and South West seeing a higher number of hospital admissions than many other regions.</p>
<h2>Pandemic ‘deepening’ existing crisis</h2>
<p>Tom Madders, the director of campaigns at YoungMinds, described the new figures as “worrying”.</p>
<p>He added: “The factors behind eating disorders are often complex but the impact of the last two years has left many young people isolated, uncertain about the future and with less control over their lives.</p>
<p>“The earlier someone is able to access help for an eating disorder, the more likely they are to recover.</p>
<p>“Yet even before the pandemic many young people struggled to get timely support for their mental health and the pandemic is only deepening this crisis.</p>
<p>Tom Quinn, the director of external affairs at the eating disorders charity Beat, said: “It is concerning that the number of hospital admissions for people with eating disorders is continuing to increase.</p>
<p>“We know that accessing quality community treatment reduces the chances of somebody needing hospital care, and so the rise in admissions suggests that people are not getting the support that they need quickly enough.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has had a devastating impact on people with eating disorders, with many experiencing increased anxiety and isolation during the ongoing uncertainty and disruption since March 2020.”</p>
<p>He added: “The number of hospital admissions is only the tip of the iceberg, and there are many other people needing support for an eating disorder.”</p>
<header> <h1> London is not safe for children, says mother of stabbed teenager as she vows to return to Romania </h1> <p> Ionut Elvis Tacu was the 30th teenager to be stabbed to death in the capital in 2021, the highest figure on record </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Izzy Lyons, Crime Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 2:20pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The mother of a teenager who was stabbed to death in London has vowed to return to Romania because London is “not a place to bring up children”.</p>
<p>Ionut Elvis Tacu, 16, was stabbed on December 30 in a park in Yiewsley, near Uxbridge, west London. A 16-year-old boy has appeared in court charged with his murder.</p>
<p>Known as Elvis to friends, he was the 30th teenager to be knifed to death in the capital in 2021, the highest figure on record for teenage homicides.</p>
<p>The record-breaking figures prompted further criticism of <a>Sadiq Khan</a>, the Mayor of London, for his failure to tackle the growing problem of teenage violence and homicides.</p>
<p>“I brought him here when he was seven years old to give him a better future, now he will go back to Romania in a coffin,” his devastated mother, Mihaela, a 38-year-old hairdresser, said.</p>
<p>Elvis lived in his family home in West Drayton, west London, with his parents and younger brother.</p>
<p>Mihaela says she is now planning on taking her remaining son, aged three, back to Romania because the British capital is too dangerous.</p>
<h2>‘I want to run away from this country’</h2>
<p>“I feel like I want to run away from this country and go back to Romania with my child I still have left,” she said. “We wanted to move out of London before he died because it is not safe. It is not a place to bring up children.</p>
<p>“I will not come back here and will encourage people with children to have second thoughts about moving here.”</p>
<p>Describing her son as a “lovely boy” who “was not aggressive at all”, Mihaela said Elvis loved music, watching movies and playing with his brother.</p>
<p>“He had never come home beaten up and nothing like this had ever happened to him, then suddenly he got killed,” she said.</p>
<p>“If he had been an aggressive child, or in a gang or something, maybe we would not be so devastated.”</p>
<p>She continued: “Of course, his brother doesn’t understand why he is not with us, which is heartbreaking. He has kept on asking us when Elvis is going to be back home.</p>
<p>“I never thought anything like this would ever happen to us. We have jobs and our own house. We are not from a rough family at all. It is very hard to understand why this happened.</p>
<p>“He struggled to make friends at school and has struggled to make friends since he was a baby. He needed help and no one helped him.’’</p>
<h2>Elvis ‘never looked for trouble’</h2>
<p>A school friend at Park Academy West London said: “Elvis wouldn’t hurt a fly. He was so lovely. He wasn’t the sort of boy who ever looked for trouble, he was always laughing or trying to make other people laugh.”</p>
<p>A GoFundMe page, set up by a family friend, has raised nearly £10,000 to take Elvis’s body back to Romania.</p>
<p>Claudia Martonfi, who set up the fundraising page, wrote: “The family are devastated and no words are enough to comfort them, when most of us were getting ready to celebrate a new year their world came apart with the death of their son.</p>
<p>“The family wishes for Elvis’ body to be repatriated and buried in his home country of Romania.</p>
<p>“The little one is missing Elvis a lot and always asking about him. How on Earth can you explain to a toddler that his big brother was killed and that he will never see him again?’’</p>

<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:29pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Skiers and snowboarders have taken to the slopes in Northumberland, after snow fell in England. </p>
<p>The volunteer-run tows of Allenheads in the Pennines to the north of Weardale rejoiced in the fresh powder after missing 28 of 32 days of snow in 2019/20 due to Covid restrictions. </p>
<p>Yellow weather warnings for snow and ice have been issued for parts of northern England and Scotland on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Met Office forecasts snowfall in Greater Manchester, Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Yorkshire and Scotland between 10am and 4pm, followed by freezing conditions in the evening and wintry showers into Friday.</p>
<p>Forecasters say the snow may cause some travel disruption over higher routes during the day with two to five centimetres likely above heights of 200 to 300 metres, and 10 to 15cm above 400 metres.</p>
<p>Strong winds are expected to lead to drifting and blizzard conditions in the Hebrides and coastal areas of Scotland.</p>
<p>Frequent wintry showers during Thursday evening and overnight are likely to lead to a fresh covering of snow for areas above 200 metres, with freezing conditions returning and more possible travel disruption.</p>
<p>The Met Office forecasts milder conditions going into the weekend.</p>
<p>Mr Madge said: "Friday into Saturday we have got another frontal system moving across the UK. That's more likely to deliver rain more widely.</p>
<p>"By Saturday and into the weekend any wintry showers are likely to be just over the higher tops and fells."</p>
<header> <h1> Italian handover of Elgin Marbles fragment puts pressure on UK to follow suit </h1> <p> Athens museum chief hopes arrival of stone foot from Sicily will help to compel British Museum to give back large friezes </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Nick Squires In Rome <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:22pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Italy is to return a fragment of the Elgin Marbles to Greece, placing renewed pressure on the British Museum to do the same with the large collection of friezes from the ancient Greek monument that it owns.</p>
<p>The stone fragment is to be loaned for at least four years to the Acropolis Museum in Athens by a museum in Sicily.</p>
<p>It depicts the foot of a female figure, either Artemis, Greek goddess of the hunt, or Peitho, the goddess of seduction, emerging from the folds of a gown.</p>
<p>It is known as the Fagan fragment after Robert Fagan, a British consul to Sicily and Malta, who acquired it in the early 19th century. His widow sold it to Palermo University in 1820.</p>
<p>The director-general of the <a>Acropolis Museum</a> said that the agreement reached with the Antonio Salinas Regional Archaeological Museum in Palermo was hugely significant.</p>
<p>It was testimony to the <a>“common cultural roots”</a> between Greece and Italy and should put pressure on the British Museum to follow suit, said Nikolaos Stampolidis.</p>
<h2>Other European cities on high alert</h2>
<p>The decision by Sicily “could open the way for the return to Greece of other fragments of the Elgin Marbles which are held in other European cities, above all by the British Museum in London”, he told The Telegraph.</p>
<p>“The fact that 60 per cent of the British people wish for the return and reunification of the Parthenon sculptures is something that cannot be ignored.”</p>
<p>The Italian decision to return the fragment bolstered an appeal made by Unesco last September for the British Museum to <a>“reconsider” returning the fifth century BC Elgin Marbles</a> to Athens, he added.</p>
<p>“Good for Sicily,” said Janet Suzman, the chairman of the British Committee for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles.</p>
<p>“We expect the British Museum to make a more magnanimous gesture. I cannot think of a single argument in favour of keeping the legacy of Greece locked in Bloomsbury.</p>
<p>“Certain things must be returned and the Parthenon Marbles deserve to be reunited in the Acropolis Museum.”</p>
<p>In return for receiving the fragment on long-term loan, Greece will lend the Sicilian museum two artefacts: a marble statue of Athena from the fifth century BC and an amphora from the eighth century BC.</p>
<p>The museum in Sicily wants to return the fragment to the Acropolis Museum permanently, but needs the permission of the Italian culture ministry to do so.</p>
<p>Dario Franceschini, Italy’s culture minister, expressed his “great appreciation” on Wednesday for the decision made by the Sicilian regional government to return the fragment to Athens.</p>
<p>The Fagan fragment was “the only part of the Parthenon Marbles held by Italy,” he said.</p>
<p>Lina Mendoni, Greece’s culture minister, expressed her “deepest gratitude” for Sicily’s initiative, saying that the fragment would be returned to its “natural context”.</p>
<p>“With this gesture, the regional government of Sicily is showing the way for the definitive return of the Parthenon Marbles to Athens, the city that created them,” she said.</p>
<p>The debate over the ownership of the marbles has dogged Anglo-Greek relations for decades.</p>
<p>Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the Greek prime minister, has reiterated the arguments of his predecessors and says the friezes held by the British Museum should be returned to Athens.</p>
<p><a>He told The Telegraph last November</a>: “Our position is very clear: the marbles were stolen in the 19th century, they belong in the Acropolis Museum and we need to discuss this issue in earnest.”</p>
<p><a>Boris Johnson told Mr Mitsotakis</a> that he understood the “strength of feeling” of the Greek people, but insisted that he would have to take up his cause with the trustees of the British Museum.</p>
<p>The sculpted friezes were taken from the Parthenon, the ancient Greek temple on top of the Acropolis in Athens, by the Seventh Earl of Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the time, between 1801 and 1812.</p>
<p>The British Museum insists they were obtained legally and successive British prime ministers have maintained that their plight is a matter for the museum, not the government.</p>
<p>Mr Mitsotakis says that if the marbles were returned, then Greece would be prepared to make generous loans of its cultural treasures.</p>
<p>Last month, a Greek newspaper uncovered an article written by Mr Johnson when he was a student at Oxford in which he called for the antiquities to be sent back.</p>
<p><a>In the 1986 article Mr Johnson</a>, then president of the Oxford Union, accused Lord Elgin of “wholesale pillage”.</p>
<a>The Elgin Marbles</a> should leave this northern whisky-drinking guilt-culture and be displayed where they belong: in a country of bright sunlight and the landscape of Achilles, ‘the shadowy mountains and the echoing sea’.
<p>“The reasons for taking the marbles were good. The reasons for returning them are better still.”</p>

<h1> Christian nurse forced out of job for ‘infection risk’ crucifix was unfairly dismissed, tribunal rules </h1>
<p> Hospital trust created 'humiliating, hostile and threatening environment' in which theatre practitioner was ‘persecuted’ for her religion </p>
<div> <div> By Gabriella Swerling, Social and Religious Affairs Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A Christian NHS nurse who was “forced out” of her job for wearing a “bacteria-harbouring” crucifix was unfairly dismissed, a tribunal has ruled.</p>
<p>She brought a legal case against her former employer of 18 years, Croydon Health Services NHS Trust, in October on the grounds of harassment, victimisation, direct and indirect discrimination, and constructive and unfair dismissal. </p>
<p>It was claimed that other clinical staff were allowed to wear jewellery, turbans, hijabs and saris - yet only she was subject to sanction.</p>
<p>In a judgment released on Wednesday, Employment Judge Daniel Dyal found that Mrs Onuoha had her human rights breached and that the trust had created a “humiliating, hostile and threatening environment”. </p>
<p>Responding to the outcome, Mrs Onuoha said she was “delighted and relieved” that she had received justice. The tribunal is expected to discuss her compensation claim for £80,000 at a later date.</p>
<p>She also claimed she was forced off work with stress in June 2020 and believed she faced no alternative but to resign later that year.</p>
<h2>Complexity of issues 'ignored'</h2>
<p>In his ruling, Judge Dyal said the infection risk of the necklace, when worn by a responsible clinician such as Mrs Onuoha, was "very low".</p>
<p>The tribunal also said the rejection of Mrs Onuoha’s grievance was “offensive and intimidating”.</p>
<p>It failed to properly grapple with the complexity of the issues, Judge Dyal said. </p>
<p>“Equally, no real thought was given to the claimant’s point that others were wearing religious apparel in clinical areas and that she should be treated equally to them.”</p>
<p>The tribunal also found that the trust constructively dismissed Mrs Onuoha “without reasonable and proper cause” and that the dismissal was unfair and discriminatory.</p>
<p>Mrs Onuoha was supported in her case by the Christian Legal Centre. Andrea Williams, chief executive of the organisation, said that the nurse has now been “vindicated”. </p>
<p>“Any employer will now have to think very carefully before restricting the wearing of crosses in the workplace,” she added. </p>
<p>“You can only do that on specific and cogent health and safety grounds. It is not enough to apply general labels such as ‘infection risk’ or ‘health and safety’”.</p>
<p>During the tribunal hearings, it was heard that Mrs Onuoha had reported being harassed for wearing the cross necklace by a senior manager, while caring for a patient under general anaesthetic in the operating theatre.</p>
<h2>Dress code and uniform policy 'updated'</h2>
<p>A spokesman for the trust said: “We would like to apologise to Mrs Onuoha and thank the employment tribunal panel for their careful consideration of this matter.</p>
<p>“It is important that NHS staff feel able to express their beliefs, and that our policies are applied in a consistent, compassionate and inclusive way.</p>
<p>"However, we will carry out a further review of our policy and practices in light of this judgement.”</p>
<header> <h1> Writing is on the wall for handwriting as schools trial digital exams </h1> <p> Novelist Colm Toibin warns of a generation losing out on the magic of putting pen to paper as exam board trials electronic tests </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Daniel Capurro, Senior Reporter <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:49pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Handwriting could “go the way of Latin and Greek” and be “lost within a generation”, a leading author has warned after news that a major exams board was set to trial digital exams at dozens of schools.</p>
<p>Colm Toibin, famous for penning novels such as Brooklyn and The Testament of Mary, said that “it would be a huge loss if [handwriting] were to go”, and called learning to write an “an identity-forming business”.</p>
<p>AQA, Britain’s largest exams board and the provider of three-fifths of all GCSE and A-levels in England, announced on Monday that it was trialling online exams for GCSE maths and English at 60 to 100 schools this summer.</p>
<p>If successful, the programme would be rolled out across most subjects, although Colin Hughes, the chief executive of AQA, told The Times that the board would keep some written exams to <a>protect handwriting from dying out</a>.</p>
<p>“I would be very reluctant to move to a situation where students could get through the whole system without ever actually having to show that they can <a>write something down using a pen and paper</a>,” he said.</p>
<p>He also claimed that online exams would be much greener than shipping millions of exam papers around the country before collecting them all again in Milton Keynes to digitise them.</p>
<p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Tobin suggested that opting for convenience could kill off handwriting and its esoteric charms.</p>
<p>“If you began to say everything would be much more efficient on a laptop, [handwriting] would go eventually, it would within a generation, almost disappear,” he said, adding: “It goes the way of Latin and Greek.”</p>
<p>He also lamented the loss of handwriting as a marker of identity, adding: “You would know when a letter came from someone, oh that’s from Auntie so-and-so, that’s her handwriting.”</p>
<p>Asked about his own writing habits, Tobin said he wrote all his own novels in longhand form.</p>
<p>“It sort of matters to me that I’m actually making the letters, that I can touch the paper, that I’m somehow more deeply involved,” he said.</p>
<p>In contrast, recent research has found that much of the general public has almost <a>no need for the scratch of pen against notepa</a>d, let alone extended longhand writing.</p>
<p>A survey of 2,000 people last September found that one in 10 people had not put <a>pen to paper in over a year</a>, while a quarter of 18- to 24-year-olds had never written a letter or kept a diary.</p>
<p>The ability to write clearly is not directly linked to literacy, despite popular perceptions, although a 2014 study found improved recall from people who handwrote notes during lectures.</p>
<p>The study’s author’s hypothesised that the slower nature of handwriting forces individuals to paraphrase and therefore mentally process spoken</p>
<p>The top answer: a handwritten card.</p>
<h1> Hundreds of care homes not accepting new residents amid omicron variant fears </h1>
<p> Pressure grows on hospitals as care homes that have two or more Covid cases refuse new arrivals – in accordance with government guidelines </p>
<div> <div> By Gabriella Swerling, Social and Religious Affairs Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 7:14pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Hundreds of care homes are not allowing new residents because of the spread of the Covid omicron variant and rising staff shortages.</p>
<p>Of the homes operated by MHA, one of the largest not-for-profit care providers in the UK, 70 per cent have now closed their doors to new residents.</p>
<a>government guidelines</a> - they should not accept new arrivals.
<p>Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, described the trend as “very concerning” and said hospital bosses were reporting that delayed discharges were significantly adding to pressure.</p>
<p>“This isn’t good for patients as we know patient outcomes deteriorate if patients are medically fit to discharge but can’t leave hospital,” he told The Guardian.</p>
<p>Mr Hopson also said that this was leading to <a>mounting pressure on hospitals</a> who are unable to discharge patients into the community - including serious cases coming via AE departments.</p>
<p>HC-One, the largest private care home provider, said 869 staff – about four per cent of the workforce – were absent with either a positive test or awaiting results, while about 500 residents, or three per cent, had tested positive.</p>
<p>This comes as new figures revealed that around half of care homes in Greater Manchester are unable to accept new residents due to Covid-19 staffing absences.</p>
<h2>Care homes ‘knocking back’ onto the NHS</h2>
<p>He said there are about 650 people in hospital beds who are medically fit to be discharged but there is a shortage of care homes to take them.</p>

<p>Given that Saddam had actually used chemical weapons to murder thousands, it was hardly credible for opponents to claim they didn’t exist, so they settled for dubious claims of moral relativism instead.</p>
<p>Hoon, it should be pointed out, has never claimed that Britain’s involvement in the Iraq invasion was illegal; how could he, given his support at the time and his awareness of all the legal advice given to the cabinet? </p>

<p>Past Covid outbreaks may have dimmed the panto lights across Britain over Christmas, but PMQs provided some consolation for those of us who were still feeling the loss of our annual brush with Widow Twankey, Baron Hardup and Fleshcreep. </p>
<p>The rowdy, rough-and-tumble atmosphere was unmistakable. As the SNP’s Ian Blackford rose to his feet for the first time, it attracted not just the usual grumble, but a deafening collective groan. </p>
<p>Even Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the House Speaker, managed a delightfully out-of-character balls-up, misidentifying the Liberal Democrat leader as Ed Miliband’s ballroom-dancing former deputy. </p>
<p>“Ed Ball – Ed Davey!” he snapped, as the Commons dissolved into knee-slapping hysterics, worthy of a matinee in the Blackpool Grand with Paul O’Grady in attendance. </p>
<h2>Little Red Hiding Hood</h2>
<p>After testing positive for Covid for the second time, Sir Keir Starmer faced his sixth self-isolation from PMQs – an unrivalled record that could only be the result of tremendous bad luck, if not outright sorcery.</p>
<a>corniest of lines with gusto</a>. 
<p>“It’s not about brushing his hair – it’s about brushing up his act!” she grinned, gesturing at the Prime Minister, as the Labour members jeered and hooted obediently.</p>
<p>“It’s great to be here with the Shadow Secretary of State for the future of work… I think we all know the future job that she has in mind,” retorted Johnson in kind. </p>
<p>At one point, Rishi Sunak and Priti Patel launched into a perfectly synchronised nodding routine worthy of Tweedle-Dum and Tweedle-Dee.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Rayner put aside her Widow Twankey’s weeds and assumed an even unlikelier garb. This self-described socialist began ripping into rising inflation and <a>Tory tax increases</a> like a female Milton Friedman reincarnate. </p>
<p>Why, exactly, had the Prime Minister said that <a>“fears about inflation were unfounded”</a>, tried Angela von Hayek again?</p>
<p>“Of course, I said no such thing!” insisted Boris. (Oh no, I didn’t!)</p>
<p>For a split second, the Prime Minister looked lost – a piteous Red Riding Hood or Hansel and Gretel, but with no sign of an obliging huntsman or trail of breadcrumbs to save him. </p>
<p>Waving away Rayner’s intervention, he made to bolt off; anything to escape the cul-de-sac of awkwardness he’d blundered into. “He’s running away!” shouted the Labour benches. </p>
<p>But oh no, he wasn’t. The Speaker reminded Boris that he faced an encore – an official Commons Covid update beginning immediately after PMQs.</p>
