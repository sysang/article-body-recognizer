<p>The Workforce Solutions Department on Monday issued a reminder to employers and workers of the increase. </p>
<p>Reforms signed by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and adopted in 2019 gradually raise the statewide minimum wage to $12 by 2023. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden has proposed to raise the federal minimum wage requirement for most workers to $15 an hour from $7.25.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law, authorizing $768.2 billion in military spending, including a 2.7% pay raise for service members, for 2022.</p>
<p>The NDAA authorizes a 5% increase in military spending, and is the product of intense negotiations between Democrats and Republicans over issues ranging from reforms of the military justice system to COVID-19 vaccine requirements for soldiers.</p>
<p>“The Act provides vital benefits and enhances access to justice for military personnel and their families, and includes critical authorities to support our country’s national defense,” Biden said Monday in a statement.</p>
<p>The new bill passed earlier this month with bipartisan support, with Democrats and Republicans touting wins in the final package.</p>
<p>Democrats applauded provisions in the bill overhauling how the military justice system handles sexual assault and other related crimes, effectively taking prosecutorial jurisdiction over such crimes out of the hands of military commanders.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Republicans, meanwhile, touted success in blocking an effort to add women to the draft, as well as the inclusion of a provision that bars dishonorable discharges for service members who refuse the COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>The bill includes $7.1 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and a statement of congressional support for the defense of Taiwan, measures intended to counteract China’s influence in the region.</p>
<p>It also includes $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, a show of support in the face of Russian aggression, as well as $4 billion for the European Defense Initiative.</p>
<p>In his statement, the president also outlined a number of provisions his administration opposes over what he characterized as “constitutional concerns or questions of construction.”</p>
<p>The law also has provisions barring goods produced by forced Uyghur labor in China from entering the U.S., and it begins to lay out plans for the new Global War on Terror Memorial, which would be the latest addition to the National Mall. </p>

<p>REHOBOTH BEACH, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden’s new puppy, Commander, got his moment under the flashing lights of the Washington press corps — and some time frolicking on the beach — on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Biden and first lady Jill Biden took the German shepherd on a walk near their second home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.</p>
<p>Commander was born Sept. 1 and arrived at the White House last week, a birthday gift from the president’s brother, James Biden, and sister-in-law Sara Biden. Biden introduced Commander in a tweet. He turned 79 in November.</p>
<p>Commander is the third German shepherd Biden has welcomed to the White House. Champ died in June at age 13. The other dog, Major, 3, now lives with family friends in Delaware after <a>behaving aggressively</a> while living at the White House. </p>

<p>A federal judge refused to dismiss an indictment charging four alleged leaders of the far-right Proud Boys with conspiring to attack the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden’s electoral victory.</p>
<p>Kelly said the defendants had many nonviolent ways to express their opinions about the 2020 presidential election. </p>
<p>Nordean, Biggs, Rehl and Donohoe were indicted in March on charges including conspiracy and obstructing an official proceeding. All four of them remain jailed while they await a trial scheduled for May.</p>

<p>Defense lawyers also argued that the obstruction charge doesn’t apply to their clients’ cases because Congress’ certification of the Electoral College vote was not an “official proceeding.” Kelly disagreed. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, another judge in the District of Columbia’s federal court upheld prosecutors’ use of the same obstruction charge in a separate case against two riot defendants.</p>
<a>first Proud Boys member to publicly plead guilty</a> to conspiring with other members to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote. He agreed to cooperate with authorities.
<p>Other extremist group members have been charged with conspiring to carry out coordinated attacks on the Capitol, including more than 20 people linked to the antigovernment Oath Keepers.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the four men declined to comment on Tuesday’s ruling.</p>
<p>On the morning of Jan. 6, Proud Boys members met at the Washington Monument and marched to the Capitol before President Donald Trump finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House.</p>
<p>More than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. At least 165 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanor offenses punishable by a maximum of six months’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>The two leaders will discuss “a range of topics, including upcoming diplomatic engagements,” National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne said in a statement announcing the call.</p>
<p>The talks come as the U.S. and Western allies have watched the massing of Russian forces along the border, growing to an estimated 100,000 and fueling fears that Moscow is preparing to further invade Ukraine.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. </p>
<p>Price said the two discussed efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine and upcoming diplomatic engagements with Russia.</p>
<p>Putin said earlier this week he would ponder a slew of options if the West fails to meet his push for security guarantees precluding NATO’s expansion to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Moscow submitted draft security documents demanding that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back its military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Russia are to hold high-level talks on Jan. 10. Moscow and NATO representatives are expected to meet that same week as well as Russia and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which includes the United States.</p>
<p>The official added that the White House sees the leader- to-leader engagement as important as the administration looks to find a way beyond this “moment of crisis” over growing worries of a further Russian invasion of Ukraine. </p>
<p>The two leaders are also expected during Thursday’s call to discuss efforts to persuade Iran to return to the 2015 nuclear accord, which was effectively scrapped by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>Despite differences on Ukraine and other issues, White House officials have said the Iran nuclear issue is one where they believe the U.S. and Russia can work cooperatively.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov confirmed that Putin would speak with Biden on Thursday but provided no details. </p>

<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal health officials on Thursday pressed nursing home workers to get their booster shots amid a spike in COVID-19 cases among staffers and a concerning lag in booster vaccination for residents and staff.</p>
<a>a tiny proportion of the population</a>, they represent a disproportionate share of Americans who have died in
<a>the coronavirus pandemic</a>. Earlier this year
<a>the advent of vaccines</a> brought the virus under control in nursing homes and allowed them to reopen to visitors. But that
<a>return to normalcy</a> could be in jeopardy as
<a>omicron</a> pushes COVID-19 cases to new highs for the nation.

<p>“We’ve got to change that,” Becerra said. </p>
<p>The administration is urging some 1,400 federally funded community health centers across the land to partner with local nursing homes in a renewed vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>But some states are already seeing trouble.</p>
<p>COVID-19 outbreaks in Mississippi nursing homes have almost doubled in the past week, and officials say that indicates the state is probably heading into another major surge of virus cases and hospitalizations.</p>
<p>There were 63 outbreaks in Mississippi nursing homes Monday, about twice the number reported last week, state epidemiologist Dr. Paul Byers wrote in a midweek memo to Mississippi hospitals and health care providers.</p>
<p>Along with other data, that points to “very rapid growth of COVID-19 infection and transmission...we have now entered our 5th wave of COVID-19 in the state,” Byers wrote. </p>
<p>One of the major nursing home industry groups is backing the administration’s push on boosters.</p>
<p>The American Health Care Association said in a statement it’s asking members to “double down on their efforts to get as many residents and staff fully vaccinated and boosted as soon as possible.” </p>

<p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — A memorial service honoring former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been scheduled for Jan. 8 at a performing arts center in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Reid, 82, died Tuesday at home in Henderson, Nevada, of complications from pancreatic cancer, according to Landra Reid, his wife of 62 years.</p>
<p>His office in Las Vegas announced Thursday that the 11 a.m. service at the Smith Center will be open to family, colleagues and invited guests, and will be livestreamed.</p>
<p>Tickets will be distributed through his office, former aides said in a statement. Additional details will be released at a later time. Arrangements for a memorial service in Washington, D.C., have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>Reid, a Democrat elected to the U.S. House in 1982, served in Congress longer than anyone in Nevada history. </p>
<p>President Joe Biden, who served with him in the Senate, called him one of the great Senate majority leaders in the country’s history.</p>

<p>White House officials offered a far more muted post-call readout, suggesting the leaders agreed there are areas where the two sides can make meaningful progress but also differences that might be impossible to resolve. </p>
<p>White House officials said Thursday’s call lasted 50 minutes, ending after midnight in Moscow. </p>
<p>Russia has made clear it wants a written commitment that Ukraine will never be allowed to join NATO and that the alliance’s military equipment will not be positioned in former Soviet states, demands that the Biden administration has rejected.</p>
<p>Biden told Putin a diplomatic path remains open even as the Russians have moved an estimated 100,000 troops toward Ukraine and Kremlin officials have turned up the volume on their demands for new guarantees from the U.S. and NATO.</p>
<p>White House officials said Biden made clear that the U.S. stands ready to exact substantial economic pain through sanctions should Putin decide to take military action in Ukraine.</p>
<p>He “noted that it would be a mistake that our ancestors would see as a grave error. A lot of mistakes have been made over the past 30 years, and we would better avoid more such mistakes in this situation,” Ushakov said. </p>
<p>Russia’s demands are to be discussed during the talks in Geneva, but it remains unclear what, if anything, Biden would be willing to offer Putin in exchange for defusing the crisis.</p>

<li><div><a><h4>A televised insurrection: AP video documents Jan. 6 riot</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Draft security documents Moscow submitted demand that NATO deny membership to Ukraine and other former Soviet countries and roll back military deployments in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The security proposal by Moscow has raised the question of whether Putin is making unrealistic demands in the expectation of a Western rejection that would give him a pretext to invade. </p>
<p>Steven Pifer, who served as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in the Clinton administration, said the Biden administration could engage on some elements of Russia’s draft document if Moscow is serious about talks. </p>
<p>Biden and Putin, who <a>met in Geneva in June</a> to discuss an array of tensions in the U.S.-Russia relationship, are not expected to take part in the January talks.</p>
<p>U.S. intelligence earlier this month determined that Russian planning was underway for a possible military offensive that could begin as soon as early 2022, but that Putin had yet to determine whether to move forward with it.</p>
<p>Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of Ukraine’s Security and Defense Council, said Thursday his country believes there is no immediate threat of a major Russian invasion.</p>
<p>“Our experts say that the Russian Federation just physically can’t mount a big invasion of our territory,” Danilov said. “There is a time period needed for preparations.”</p>
<p>Russia has denied any intention of launching an invasion and, in turn, has accused Ukraine of hatching plans to try to reclaim control of territories held by Moscow-backed rebels by force. Ukraine has rejected the claim.</p>
<p>At the same time, Putin has warned that Moscow will have to take “adequate military-technical measures” if the West continues its “aggressive” course “on the threshold of our home.”</p>
<p>Last month, Putin voiced concern that NATO could potentially use the Ukrainian territory for the deployment of missiles that would be capable of reaching Moscow in just five minutes and said that Zircon would give Russia a comparable capability.</p>
<p>Past military incursions by Putin loom large.</p>
<p>In 2014, Russian troops marched into the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and seized the territory from Ukraine. Russia’s annexation of Crimea was one of the darker moments for President Barack Obama on the international stage.</p>
<p>Biden, who is spending the week in his home state of Delaware, spoke to Putin from his home near Wilmington. The White House distributed a photo of the president speaking to the Russian leader from a desk lined with family photos.</p>

<div><div><h1>Lawsuit seeks to block 2 geothermal power plants in Nevada</h1></div><div>By SCOTT SONNERDecember 31, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The lawsuit filed by the Center for Biological Diversity and Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe says the project would turn a “pristine and unique location of ecological value and spiritual significance” into an industrial site.</p>
<p>Environmentalists nationally have rallied around President Joe Biden’s ambitious renewable energy agenda, which embraces solar, wind and geothermal production.</p>
<p>Geothermal plants pump water from beneath the earth to generate steam to make electricity. The deeper they drill, the warmer the water is. The power plants produce significantly fewer greenhouse emissions than plants that burn natural gas or coal.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed Dec. 15 accuses the Bureau of Land Management of illegally approving Ormat Technologies Inc.’s project in the Dixie Meadows about 100 miles (160 kilometers) east of Reno without the necessary environmental analysis.</p>
<p>It also says the agency is violating the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.</p>
<p>Bureau spokesman Chris Rose said the agency had no comment on the litigation.</p>
<p>A judge has scheduled a Jan. 4 hearing in U.S. District Court in Reno to consider the groups’ subsequent request for a restraining order to temporarily block initial construction work Ormat planned to begin as early as Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Formed by natural springs, Dixie Meadows is a critical wetland ecosystem in a desert oasis that is home to the Dixie Valley toad found nowhere else in the world, the lawsuit says.</p>
<p>The Biden administration approved the project last month even though the center’s petition to list the toad as a U.S. endangered species is still pending before the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>
<p>Tribal Chairperson Cathi Tuni said the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone’s ancestors have lived in the Dixie Valley region for thousands of years and long recognized the hot springs as “a sacred place of healing and reflection.”</p>
<p>“The United States has repeatedly promised to honor and protect Indigenous sacred sites, but then the BLM approved a major construction project nearly on top of our most sacred hot springs. It just feels like more empty words,” she said.</p>
<p>Reno-based Ormat filed a motion Dec. 20 seeking intervenor status in the case, citing its $68 million investment over 10 years in the project, which it said could be jeopardized by any delays.</p>
<p>“Even a few weeks of delay in construction of this project ... may spell disaster for the financial viability of the project,” the company said, pointing to a December 2021 deadline in its private power production agreements.</p>

<p>KINGS MOUNTAIN, N.C. (AP) — A new federal law affirms the operation of a casino in North Carolina by the South Carolina-based Catawba Indian Nation, ending a yearslong dispute between the tribes.</p>

<p>BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — Oil and gas leasing on federal land is expected to resume early this year in North Dakota and Montana after the Biden administration halted the process nationwide last year.</p>
<p>Oil and gas companies will bid to secure the leases and those that are successful will have a 10-year window to get a federal permit to drill.</p>
<p>Oil- and gas-producing states, including North Dakota and Montana, sued to try to force leasing to continue and were successful last June when a court order required the federal government to resume the sales.</p>

<div><div><h1>Biden to travel to Las Vegas for Harry Reid memorial service</h1></div><div>January 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — President Joe Biden is scheduled to travel to Las Vegas on Saturday to attend a memorial service for the late Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, the White House said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Reid died last week after a years-long battle with pancreatic cancer. He retired from the U.S. Senate in 2016 after representing Nevada for five terms, including 12 years as the chamber’s top Democrat.</p>
<p>“If Harry said he would do something, he did it. If he gave you his word, you could bank on it. That’s how he got things done for the good of the country for decades,” the president said in a statement after Reid’s passing.</p>
<p>First Lady Jill Biden and former President Barack Obama are also expected to attend memorial services at the Smith Center for Performing Arts in downtown Las Vegas.</p>
<p>After the services, Reid’s remains will be transported to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda, where he is scheduled to be honored in a ceremony on Jan. 12.</p>

<p>It’s not yet clear whether arts donations stabilized in 2021, but different initiatives have been launched to help both artists and arts institutions.</p>
<p>Harlem’s famed Apollo Theater reopened in August for its first public event since the pandemic shut it down last year, forcing it to furlough 44 of its 61 full-time staff. </p>
<p>“To be closed, and unable to do what we really do for that length of time, was very, very difficult,” Lieberman said. “I was standing at the back at one of our earliest performances practically crying from happiness.”</p>
<p>“These are people who never would have encountered us,” Morris said. The nonprofit plans to return to in-person events at the pub next month, but has also secured funding to allow it to record and post the shows. </p>
<p>“Those people don’t just go away,” Morris said. “We obviously care about them, we’re connected to them and we want to provide something of value to them as well.”</p>
<p>In a story published December 30, 2021, about new nonprofit initiatives to help artists, The Associated Press erroneously reported the name of the Apollo Theater’s chief development officer. She is Donna Lieberman, not Donna Leiberman.</p>

<div><div><h1>Cavaliers land Rondo from Lakers to offset loss of Rubio</h1></div><div>By TOM WITHERSJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>CLEVELAND (AP) — Once Ricky Rubio was lost for the season, the Cleveland Cavaliers knew it would take someone special to take his spot.</p>
<p>They needed a playmaking guard with experience, intelligence and competitive toughness.</p>
<p>Rajon Rondo checked every box.</p>
<p>Cleveland completed its acquisition of the 35-year-old Rondo on Monday, finalizing its trade with the Los Angeles Lakers in what eventually became a three-team deal involving the New York Knicks.</p>
<p>A four-time All-Star and twice an NBA champion, Rondo, who was barely playing with the Lakers, is joining an improved Cleveland team that has risen from doormat to playoff contender.</p>
<p>The Cavs are 21-15 and fifth in the Eastern Conference after going 22-50 last season.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Atlanta visits Sacramento after Young's 56-point game</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Pacers face the Nets on 5-game slide</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Phoenix hosts conference foe Los Angeles</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Antetokounmpo leads Milwaukee into matchup with Toronto</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Rondo was recently sidelined after a positive COVID-19 test but has cleared NBA health and safety protocols. It’s not yet known when he’ll join the Cavaliers, who are still working through some logistics with him.</p>
<p>Cleveland hosts Memphis on Tuesday before beginning a six-game, nine-day trip in Portland on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rondo has many of those same attributes — and a similar game — to Rubio’s, and Bickerstaff believes his addition will offset the loss from becoming overwhelming.</p>
<p>Rondo, who won titles with the Celtics in 2008 and Lakers in 2020, also has a fierce attitude that fits in nicely.</p>
<p>A major part of the Cavaliers’ success this season has been their intensity. They’ve simply played harder, outworking teams to get an edge.</p>
<p>Rondo has averaged 9.8 points, 8.0 assists and 4.6 rebounds in 16-plus seasons with eight teams. He has led the league in assists three times, been an All-Defensive Team selection four times and started 105 playoff games.</p>
<div><div><h1>Raiders dealing with off-field issue heading into showdown</h1></div><div>By JOSH DUBOWJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The Las Vegas Raiders have dealt with an email scandal that forced coach Jon Gruden out after five games, and a fatal drunken driving crash that led to the release of star receiver Henry Ruggs III. </p>
<p>Yet they still find themselves in position to make the playoffs for the second time in 19 seasons.</p>
<p>Now as they prepare for a season-ending showdown against the Los Angeles Chargers they learned that rookie cornerback Nate Hobbs has been arrested on a misdemeanor DUI charge. </p>
<p>“As distractions go away, we’ve kind of learned to deal with distractions around here,” interim coach Rich Bisaccia said Monday after news of Hobbs’ arrest became public.</p>
<p>Bisaccia had no more details on Hobbs’ status as the Raiders main focus is on the Chargers following Sunday’s come-from-behind 23-20 win at Indianapolis that set the stage for the big finale. </p>
<p>With a win at home Sunday night against the Chargers, the Raiders (9-7) will make the playoffs for just the second time in the past 19 seasons. Las Vegas also can get in with one loss by Pittsburgh and a Colts loss to the Jaguars on Sunday.</p>

<p>Alex Leatherwood. The rookie guard committed a key false start that thwarted a red-zone drive. Leatherwood has been called for 14 penalties this season, tied for the second most in the NFL, including a league-worst seven false starts.</p>
<p>The Raiders hope to get back TE Darren Waller this week after his return from a knee injury was delayed last week when he went on the COVID-19 list. Waller hasn’t played since Thanksgiving. </p>
<p>Minus-2 — The Raiders have had a turnover margin of minus-2 or worse in all three games during this winning streak, becoming the first team since the 1964 Bills to win three games in a row despite a turnover margin that poor. </p>

<div><div><h1>Bob Halloran, former Las Vegas sports executive, dies at 87</h1></div><div>January 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) — Bob Halloran, a former sportscaster for CBS Sports who later organized major boxing events as an executive in Las Vegas, has died. He was 87.</p>
<p>Halloran died of natural causes Sunday at his home in the desert city of Rancho Mirage located 120 miles east of Los Angeles, according to his nephew Michael Halloran.</p>
<p>Born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Halloran began his sportscasting career after graduating in 1962 from the University of Miami, where he played on the golf team. He joined the CBS affiliate in Miami after interning there during college.</p>
<p>In 1970, CBS Sports in New York hired Halloran as a national sportscaster. He covered a variety of events, including golf and boxing. He frequently interviewed Muhammad Ali, whom he had met in Miami when the boxer was known as Cassius Clay.</p>
<p>Halloran left television in 1978 and moved to Las Vegas to join Caesar’s World as vice president of sports. He staged major bouts featuring Ali, Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Duran and Thomas Hearns.</p>

<p>Halloran left MGM Mirage in 2012 and continued to work as a sports consultant. He was inducted into the Florida Boxing Hall of Fame that same year.</p>
<p>“It was a pretty good settlement — that’s all I can tell you — but needless to say I would have rather owned a piece of the Skins Game,” Halloran told the Los Angeles Times in 1996.</p>
<p>He was preceded in death by his wife Sandra in 2020. The couple had no children.</p>
<p>Halloran is no relation to the sportscaster by the same name who works for WCVB-TV in Boston.</p>

<p>KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) — Kapalua is busier than ever to start the new year, a development that goes beyond the largest winners-only field in Hawaii or even fans returning to the Plantation Course.</p>
<p>ESPN+ starts its nine-year digital rights deal with the PGA Tour at the Sentry Tournament of Champions.</p>
<p>“PGA Tour Live on ESPN+” features live coverage on four simultaneous feeds from all four rounds, which adds more than 3,200 new hours of live streaming and a total of more than 4,300 exclusive hours over 35 tournaments.</p>
<p>“What fans are going to see is more than triple, almost quadruple the hours of coverage to choose from based on four new feeds,” said Chris Wandell, vice president of media business development at the PGA Tour.</p>
<p>ESPN+ was launched in April 2018 — the first round of the RBC Heritage was the first event streamed on the service — and now has upward of 17 million subscribers.</p>
<p>Viewers will be getting a better deal at $6.99 a month, down from $9.99 a month on NBC Sports Gold and Amazon Prime, and a lot more options.</p>
<p>The biggest change is the menu.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Washington to reveal new name on Feb. 2; won't be RedWolves</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Big Ben leaving Steelers in good hands with Watt, Harris</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Bucs coach: Antonio Brown didn't claim injury before walkoff</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Browns' Mayfield done for season, will have shoulder surgery</h4></a></div></li>
<p>A third channel will be devoted to featured holes, primarily the par 3s or other pivotal holes, such as the 10th at Riviera, the 17th at the TPC Scottsdale or perhaps the reachable par-4 12th hole at the TPC Sawgrass.</p>
<p>“Every player that comes through ... you’ll see him play at least four holes,” Wandell said.</p>
<p>The other channel will be considered the main feed, a collection of video pulled together from all the other channels. That essentially would be a traditional presentation.</p>
<p>“It feels more traditional to the fan,” Lasker said. “It has a more broader scope, gets you more golf shots, telling the story of the entire tournament.”</p>
<p>More content will require 16 cameras across the course and a 15-person talent crew calling the shots on four separate channels. The weekly production crew, on site and from afar, is increasing from about 85 people to more than 210.</p>
<p>Phil Mickelson didn’t waste any time sharing the good news when he tweeted last week that he was the winner of the Player Impact Program and its $8 million prize.</p>
<p>The tour has said the award is not official yet because it has to confirmed, though one tour official said early projections had shown Tiger Woods too far behind going into the PNC Championship to catch Mickelson.</p>
<p>Given the metrics — internet searches, media mentions, social media reach, television ratings and Q-score — the outcome shouldn’t have been surprising.</p>
<p>Perhaps the power of Woods’ appeal is that with so little time in the news, he still finished second.</p>
<p>Kapalua is hosting more than just PGA Tour winners this week.</p>
<p>The Sentry Tournament of Champions says the top all-abilities golfers from four countries have been invited to play in the inaugural ISPS Handa All Abilities Champions Playoff, which will take place during the opening two rounds.</p>
<p>The trophy presentation will take place on the ninth green.</p>
<p>Lawlor called it an “unbelievable opportunity for us to put disability golf on the world stage.”</p>
<p>Stewart Cink is back at Kapalua with the rest of last year’s winners, and son Reagan returns as his caddie.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the plan when it started.</p>
<p>“Originally it was to do one tournament, but it was the Safeway Open, and that plan was quickly expanded into further into the year,” Cink said.</p>
<p>He won that Safeway Open in September 2020, and they were having so much fun together, they kept going. With Reagan getting married in July, they figured it was best for the son to stop caddying after the Tour Championship.</p>
<a>releases from the PGA Tour</a>, they must agree to play the ATT Pebble Beach Pro-Am at least once over the next three years. The tournament also says the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia will be the event’s new title sponsor.
<p>The total purse of the Tournament of Champions in 1997 when Tiger Woods won it for the first time was $1.2 million. The winner of this week’s Tournament of Champions gets $1.476 million.</p>

<p>Police have said the two men are also believed to be responsible for at least one other shooting during an attempted robbery of a casino employee in the Sahara Las Vegas parking garage. That man was not hit by gunfire.</p>
<p>Carter, in a jail interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, said he was wrongly arrested. He said he was from California, but his hometown was not specified. Ruby declined an interview request, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Carter noted that he was arrested without incident after he parked a vehicle and went into Bally’s Las Vegas Hotel Casino.</p>
<p>“How stupid do you think anyone would be — me — to rob someone, three people robbed, killed, then walk the casino like a regular person?” he told the Review-Journal.</p>

<p>Tuchel reacted by leaving Lukaku, Chelsea’s record signing, out of the 2-2 draw with Liverpool in the English Premier League on Sunday.</p>
<p>The player held talks with Tuchel on Monday and will return to training, putting him in contention to play in Wednesday’s first-leg game against Tottenham in the English League Cup semifinals.</p>
<p>“We have had enough time to clear the air and move on,” Tuchel said.</p>
<p>Tuchel said he believes Lukaku can regain the trust of the club, his teammates and the fans, and have a long-term future at a club where he arrived in the offseason from Inter Milan for $135 million on a five-year deal for a second spell.</p>
<p>If Lukaku does return to the team against Tottenham, he will take on an opponent managed by Antonio Conte, who got the best out of the striker during their time together at Inter.</p>
<p>After opening his second stint with Chelsea with four goals in his first four games, Lukaku had to wait nearly three months for his next goal, in which period he had six weeks out injured and also contracted the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Lukaku had, though, scored in three of his last four games before getting dropped against Liverpool.</p>
<p>“It’s about adaption — adaption to the league, adaption to a different team, to different teammates, and then comes injury and COVID,” Tuchel said.</p>
