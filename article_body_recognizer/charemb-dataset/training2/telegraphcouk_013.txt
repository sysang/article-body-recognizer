<h1> Ford Puma ST review: this rapid mini-SUV is the answer to a question no one asked </h1>
<p> A combination of a high-performance drivetrain and a modish supermini SUV looks a winner on paper, but in practice it's pricey and too harsh </p>
<div> <div> By Andrew English, Motoring Correspondent <time> 18 February 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Puma? ST? You are in the presence of an automotive Pushmi-Pullyu, a Doctor Dolittle-like confection of on-trend supermini-based SUV/crossover and the great performance hatchback of our times, <a>the Fiesta ST</a>.</p>
<p>But before you get too aerated about the thing, Münzinger wrongfoots you by admitting that he could go even further. What about an ST performance version of the larger Kuga SUV?</p>
<p>“Why not?” he says.</p>
<p>“Why?” we reply.</p>
<h3>Sporting ambience and hardware</h3>
<p>Unlike the regular Puma there’s no mild hybrid system to lend an electric shove to the petrol engine, though there is cylinder deactivation to lighten the fuel bills on part-throttle applications.</p>
<p>The top speed is 137mph with 0-62mph in 6.7sec, a WLTP fuel consumption of 41.5mph (I achieved an overall 37mpg although on occasion the total dropped well below 30mpg) and CO2 emissions of 155g/km.</p>
<p>Ease or lift off in a corner and the line will tighten before eventually, after telegraphing its intentions, the back will slide out. Yes, you can have some fun in this car but it’s essentially safe and predictable. </p>
<a>the able Focus ST</a> and even
<a>Toyota’s sensational, rally-bred GR Yaris</a>.
<p>I’m kind of glad Ford went to the bother of making it, but even though it sounds good from outside and provides plenty of amusement, I’m not sure that this rapid B-segment crossover answers any questions the buying public were asking.</p>
<p>Ford Puma ST Performance Pack</p>
<p>TESTED 1,497cc, three-cylinder turbocharged petrol, six-speed manual gearbox, front-wheel drive</p>
<p>PRICE/ON SALE from £28,495 (inc £950 Performance Pack as tested)/now</p>
<p>POWER/TORQUE 197bhp @ 6,000rpm/236 lb ft @ 2,500rpm</p>

<h1> Vauxhall Mokka review: a winning style that's backed up by substance </h1>
<p> An electric-only model as well as petrol power ensures that there's something for everyone in this stylish newcomer. We assess both versions </p>
<div> <div> By Andrew English, Motoring Correspondent <time> 10 February 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<a>GT X Experimental SUV concept</a> of 2018; the design team under Mark Adams, Vauxhall’s British design boss, dialled it back a bit for production yet still created a highly memorable machine.
<p>The Mokka has sold decently in the UK; more than 200,000 since the original version was launched in 2012, albeit with an underwhelming interior and dynamics. </p>
<p>Even so, Vauxhall isn’t taking chances and has revamped its less wildly styled, more spacious and practical (and cheaper) <a>Crossland</a> B-segment crossover to sell alongside the Mokka.</p>
<h3>Underneath the sleek skin</h3>
<p>Safety equipment also includes forward-collision alert and speed-sign recognition, but you have to go up the range to get adaptive cruise control, blind-spot alert and a rear parking assistance and a rear camera.</p>
<p>We drove two versions, the £28,620 (with extras) SRi NAV trim 128bhp/170lb ft 1.2-litre with an eight-speed automatic gearbox, which has a top speed of 124mph, 0-60mph in 9.2sec, a WLTP fuel consumption of 47.9mph and CO2 emissions of 133g/km.</p>
<a>£3,000 plug-in car grant</a>) electric version, which has the same 50kWh lithium-ion battery 134bhp/221lb ft electric motor drivetrain as is fitted to the
<a>Citroën e-C4</a>. The top speed is 93mph, 0-60mph in 8.7sec and zero emissions at the tailpipe, though on the quoted gross 50kWh battery and UK generation greenhouse contribution it will be producing CO2 at a rate of about 36g/km. 
<p>The range is quoted at 201 miles, with recharging through a domestic 7.4kW household wallbox taking 7.5 hours, a 22kW public charger takes just over five hours and with a 50kW rapid charger a 0-80 per cent charge will take 45 minutes.</p>
<p>One bugbear is the release for the tailgate on the outside, which is located lower than you might expect so it’s permanently splattered in road grime.</p>
<h3>On the road – the electric version </h3>
<p>The regenerative braking function is reasonably progressive, except the pedal could do with more grab at the top of its travel, while at very low speeds the friction brakes come in with a bit of a bump.</p>
<h3>How does the petrol version compare? </h3>
<p>There was also noticeably more wind noise from this petrol Mokka than there had been in the battery version, with the racket at motorway speeds sounding like a salon’s worth of hairdryers.</p>
<p>On similarly-sized 18in wheels, the petrol car feels a bit top heavy at first with a strange wobbling smooth-road ride. Once turned off on a bumpy country road, however, the ride is crashy, especially from the rear suspension. </p>
<p>I’ve got a feeling that the Mokka’s looks are going to win a few hearts on their first date and owners will be picking out curtains with this car without much further thought; Vauxhall has got a hit on its hands.</p>
<p>Vauxhall Mokka 1.2 Turbo SRi NAV 130PS auto</p>
<p>TESTED 1,199cc, three-cylinder turbo petrol, eight-speed automatic gearbox, front-wheel drive</p>
<p>PRICE/ON SALE range from £20,735 (£28,620 as tested)/now, with first deliveries in spring</p>
<p>POWER/TORQUE 128bhp @ 5,500rpm/169 lb ft @ 1,750rpm</p>
<p>ACCELERATION 0-62mph in 9.5sec</p>
<p>FUEL ECONOMY 47.9mpg (WLTP)</p>
<p>VED £215 first year, then £150</p>
<p>Ford Puma ST-Line X, from £23,645</p>
<p>Nissan Juke, from £23,695</p>
<p>Mazda CX-30, from £22,670</p>
