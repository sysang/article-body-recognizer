<p>LAS VEGAS (AP) — Pop and RB entertainer Jason Derulo was involved in a scuffle with two people early Tuesday at a Las Vegas Strip resort, but the singer, dancer and TikTok star was not arrested or given a summons, police said.</p>
<p>Las Vegas police said in a statement that an altercation was reported after 2 a.m. at a night club at the Aria resort and that Derulo “committed a battery against two individuals.” No injuries were reported by police.</p>
<p>Emails to Derulo’s agent and manager seeking comment were not immediately returned Tuesday.</p>
<p>Media reports including video posted on celebrity website TMZ said Derulo, 32, struck at least one person near an escalator after someone cursed him and called him by the name of another musician, Usher.</p>
<p>“The victims did not want to press charges against Derulo,” police said, and Derulo was told by hotel security to leave the property under a trespass order.</p>
<p>Police said no police report was taken because the people involved did not want to prosecute.</p>
<p>Derulo has sold millions of songs since 2009 and has 11 Platinum singles including “Wiggle,” “Talk Dirty,” “Want to Want Me,” and “Whatcha Say.”</p>

<div><div><h1>In Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots </h1></div><div>By LAURIE KELLMANJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>In Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>On Wednesday, the government reported a record for the pandemic in Israel, with 11,978 new infections a day earlier. That beats the previous high of 11,345 infections in a single day set on Sept. 2 during the delta variant wave. </p>
<p>“There is no control of the omicron wave,” said Sharon Alroy-Preis, the Health Ministry’s top public health official on Israel’s Channel 13 this week.</p>
<p>“Probably no one is protected from infection,” said Jonathan Halevy, president of Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The new goal is to protect society’s most vulnerable people without another national lockdown — the red line Prime Minister Naftali Bennett and the country’s 7-month-old government are laboring to avoid. </p>
<p>“It’s a different ballgame altogether,” Bennett said during a press conference Sunday as he warned that the number of daily infections is expected to soar to new records in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“We must keep our eye on the ball if we want to continue engaging and working with an open country as much as possible,” he added.</p>
<p>In everyday life, that’s meant a morass of confusion as Bennett and the coalition government he leads struggle to agree on rules and communicate their decisions to the public.</p>
<a>is limited in part by ultra-Orthodox Jews and some Arabs who have been slow to roll up their sleeves</a>. About 63% of people in Israel have been vaccinated twice, while around 46% have received three jabs.
<p>Our World in Data ranks Israel 17th in the world for vaccination rates, behind other wealthy nations like the United Arab Emirates and the United States — and just ahead of archrival Iran. Back in June, Israel was No. 1 on the list.</p>
<p>Still, the process remains messy and confusing given the variant’s fast-moving spread. </p>
<p>On Wednesday in the shadow of the record-setting spike of infections, there was more change. Israel’s health minister announced that the demand for testing was slowing the results and recommended more at-home rapid testing to ease the burden. </p>
<p>Quarantines that two weeks ago were required of anyone who might have been exposed to the virus are being scaled back in order to prevent the economy from grinding to a halt. </p>
<p>Contact tracing has become more complicated given the shortage of tests. </p>
<p>Israel’s list of countries whose tourists are banned has been scaled back, with the Health Ministry on Monday recommending that Canada, France, South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain and Portugal be removed.</p>
<p>Travel to and from the United States and United Kingdom remains forbidden.</p>
<p>There’s been considerable hand-wringing over any suggestion of “herd immunity” — when enough people have either been vaccinated or recovered from a past infection to stop the virus’ uncontrolled spread.</p>
<p>Israel’s health chief, Nachman Ash, said the fourth shot could be offered to more Israelis, but it’s not certain whether it could be rolled out quickly enough. </p>
<p>“The price of herd immunity is very many infections, and that may end up happening,” Ash told Radio 103FM on Sunday. “But we don’t want to reach it by means of infections.”</p>
