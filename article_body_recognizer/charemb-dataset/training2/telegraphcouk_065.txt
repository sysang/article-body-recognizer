<p>SIR – On Boxing Day my wife and I returned from the United States – where our pre-departure Covid test was free and negative – to Britain, where we had to purchase day-two tests and waited six days for negative results.</p>
<p>The omicron virus was already rife in Britain, so I cannot see any point in our spending £120 to get a result that no one is interested in. The whole system is ridiculous and only serves to boost testing companies’ profits.</p>

<p>SIR – Like Graham Lang (Letters, December 30) we also find supplies of tomato juice in Scotland to be erratic and at times virtually non-existent.</p>
<p>We’ve overcome the problem by using supermarket own-brand passata instead. It produces an excellent Bloody Mary, particularly when a good half inch of Tio Pepe is floated over the top of it.</p>

<p>SIR – For the recipe of Jeeves’s hangover cure, Tony Manning (<a>Letters, January 3</a>) must have overlooked the Master’s omnibus Jeeves Takes Charge. “Worcester sauce – raw egg – and red pepper.” Try it.</p>
<p>Anthony GornallSunningdale, Berkshire</p>
<p>SIR – I do wish I had read that ridiculously patronising instruction, “This gets hot”, on the top of my new toaster (<a>Letters, January 1</a>). Next morning I promptly burnt my hand.</p>
<p>Janet HowellWinchester, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – I live in France and have just received a gift from my daughter in Wiltshire of a calendar for this year. The value on the customs declaration is £20. I was charged €13 import duty.</p>
<p>Last week, I received a diary declared at a value of £11. I was charged €23 import duty.</p>
<p>The French government customs website states that parcels between individuals sent from Britain to France that have a value of less than €45 should be duty-free.</p>
<p>Illegal customs duty is imposed every time, and the sums demanded seem random and illogical: €9 on my husband’s jacket that he’d left behind on a visit to Britain; €10 to receive a box of chocolates sent by my daughter.</p>

<p>SIR – Declining church attendance is not new. In 2010, of the 16,000 parish churches in England, some 4,000 had regular congregations of under 20, and 800 had regular congregations of fewer than 10.</p>
<p>As older churchgoers die and are not replaced by younger worshippers, the surprise is not that so many church buildings have closed, but that it is so few. (“Shocking threat to parishes as churches close”, report, January 4).</p>
<p>Church buildings are an important part of the nation’s built heritage, sacred places, and many have potential for wider community use.</p>

<p>SIR – Alexa, a recent gift, unexpectedly performed a tricky Chopin mazurka. This, it happened, was part of my Grade 8 examination at Blackheath Conservatoire of Music 60 years ago.</p>
<p>I dusted off the music manuscript and found that my fingers recalled quite a lot of the work.</p>
<p>But how was this possible when brain cells would have changed many times over such a long spell? I conclude there must be a brain iCloud at work, but how does it function?</p>

<h2>Memorable travails of a Triumph Herald owner</h2>
<p>SIR – I had one of the early Triumph Herald Coupes (<a>Letters, January 4</a>).</p>
<p>It made me late for work because, having parked, I would be beset by pedestrians asking me to open the bonnet.</p>
<p>I often attended meetings at the Triumph works, and once saw the apprentices assemble a vehicle, which inspired me to remove the roof. However, this version of the car proved short-lived, as it behaved like a jelly on the road.</p>
<p>One journey through France was a nightmare after the foot-brake travel became alarmingly long. I found a Triumph dealer but, following inspection by the whole team, a ratchet on the brake mechanism was diagnosed as irreparable.</p>
<p>I subsequently bought the saloon version. The windows dropped into the doors and, on a very cold day, couldn’t be wound up. Such failures probably spelt the beginning of the end for the British motor industry.</p>
<p>R Darell SealPetworth, West Sussex</p>
<p>It had a factory hard top, but the optional folding soft top that I used in the summer leaked, resulting in a pond in the footwell. I resolved this by drilling two holes in the floor, fitted with non-return grommets.</p>
<p>It was a superb machine, which never let me down over 30,000 miles of happy motoring.</p>
<p>Patrick TraceyCarlisle, Cumbria</p>
<p>During our four years there, it never broke down even though, when we arrived, other residents asked me whether I had brought a net to catch all the pieces as they fell off. I hope it is still being driven there.</p>
<p>Ian HalfordPerranwell, Cornwall</p>
<p>SIR – When my wife and I married, she owned a cherry-red Herald convertible. Its only fault was an occasional failure to start, which was tracked down to a sticking float in the carburettor.</p>
<p>My wife used to carry a silver-plated tablespoon, with which she would give the float chamber a mighty blow. The car would then start.</p>
<p>Tim LodgeBray, Berkshire</p>
<p>SIR – While I was driving my Herald in the 1970s, the passenger door flew open on a bend, and my handbag and dog fell out. Happily both were retrieved without injury.</p>

<h1> Exclusive: More than 400 churches close in a decade amid ‘shocking’ threat to parishes </h1>
<p> 'Bedrock' of Church of England shows signs of crumbling, as analysis by The Telegraph shows nearly 1,000 have closed in just over 30 years </p>
<div> <div> By Gabriella Swerling, Social and Religious Affairs Editor and Ben Butcher, Data Journalist <time> 3 January 2022 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>More than 400 churches have been shut down in less than a decade, The Telegraph can reveal, as senior clergy warn of the “shocking” threat to parishes as “the bedrock of the Church of England”.</p>
<p>Analysis of Church of England data by this newspaper found that 423 churches were closed between 2010 and 2019.</p>
<a>the impact of the pandemic</a>, and as a result, clergy and lay people fear the total figure could be much higher.
<p>The Very Revd Andrew Nunn, Dean of Southwark Cathedral, who is one of the most senior Anglican priests, called the rate of increase in the number of church closures “shocking”. </p>
<p>Across the Church’s 42 dioceses, <a>there are on average almost six per cent fewer churches</a>, with the total falling from 16,436 in 1987 to 15,496 in 2019.</p>
<p>The Church of England defines a ‘church’ as “a building which is licensed as a place of worship within the parish system”. This can include former mission halls and less permanent buildings.</p>
<p>Officials said that of the 423 church closures between 2010 and 2019, 209 <a>were traditional church buildings</a>.</p>
<p>Durham and Manchester saw the greatest number of church closures over the period, meaning they now have almost 15 per cent fewer churches than they did 34 years ago.</p>
<p>The Diocese of Durham had 310 churches in 1987, but by 2019, that figure dropped to 264. Meanwhile, the Diocese of Manchester saw its total number of churches fall from 371 to 316 for the same period.</p>
<p>Coventry saw its number of churches rise from 240 to 242, an increase of 0.8 per cent, and the number of churches in the diocese of Worcester rose from 271 to 274, up 1.1 per cent.</p>
<p>The figures come as religious leaders claim that many church buildings are “in the wrong locations” as “communities have moved away and left the old infrastructure of society stranded”.</p>
<a>falling below 50 per cent for the first time</a>, as atheists now account for more than a third of “faith” groups in an increasingly secular society.
<p>The Dean of Southwark Cathedral said that this issue is “not as simple as saying churches have closed so the church is dying”.</p>
<p>“In places the church is growing but in different ways. The truth has also to be faced that many of our buildings are now in the wrong locations,” he added.</p>
<p>Last year, The Telegraph revealed that <a>multiple clergy and laypeople had voiced fears over the “collapse” of the Church of England</a> in rural communities.</p>
<a> provided an opportunity for “radical change” within the Church</a> which could result in the loss of the parish church model in a bid to remain “financially sustainable”.
<p>The report, sent to the 42 diocesan secretaries, warned clergy to prepare for changes and cuts as officials prepare to overhaul the system, sparking fears that churches in rural towns and parishes will not survive.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Church of England said: “While there is always sadness when a church closes, the number of churches closing has fallen steadily.</p>
<p>“Between 2010 and 2019 there were 209 church closures across the Church of England’s 12,300 parishes - the lowest number for any decade in the last half century.</p>
<p>“It is a real tribute to the dedication of parish clergy and volunteers that we are able to maintain our commitment to being a Christian presence in every community.</p>

<p>The Government must commit to keep schools open, whatever happens with the new variant. But to meet this commitment, ministers need a proper strategy to ensure that the young never have to make such sacrifices again.</p>
<p>The point is that we need positive action from politicians on this issue and not just platitudes. Too little attention has been paid to the costs of Covid restrictions on the young. They must not be failed again.</p>

<p>Those of a more cynical frame of mind might conclude that Mr Johnson was keen to turn the rapid spread of the omicron variant into an emergency ahead of the by-election in North Shropshire on Thursday and key votes in the Commons tonight.</p>
<p>The Commons will have a number of votes – one on the reimposition of mandated face-coverings and another on allowing a daily negative test result to release those exposed to a positive case from the obligation to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Even though the great majority of the population has been vaccinated, therefore, we approach another Christmas with just as much trepidation as last year. It is a deeply depressing prospect.</p>

<p>Moreover, even without a formal lockdown, the Chancellor has <a>felt the need to dip into his depleted coffers to find more</a> money to help companies impacted by the latest Covid surge.</p>
<p>One reason the Government is rightly reluctant to order a full lockdown is that it would then be bound to pay full compensation to affected businesses and possibly reopen the furlough scheme for employees.</p>
<p>Too often during this pandemic, ministers have been spooked by alarmist modelling and have rushed into restrictions without giving due regard to whether they are proportionate or even affordable. That cannot go on.</p>
<p>This year, Christmas may have been saved and other welcome changes are being made, such as a reduction in the self-isolation period from 10 to seven days. But before any further measures are imposed, their costs should be confronted beforehand.</p>

<p>The bad news is that because omicron spreads more rapidly it is infecting more people, some of whom will fall seriously ill and end up in hospital. The latest figures show <a>positive daily cases over 100,000 for the first time</a>.</p>
<p>It is the concern that rising numbers will overwhelm hospital intensive care units that is driving the latest set of controls and risking a further lockdown in the New Year.</p>
<p>A study of data from Scotland reinforces what has already been seen in South Africa, that even though omicron is becoming the dominant strain, more people are likely to have a mild illness with less serious symptoms. </p>

<a>as in America</a> if we are to avert a crisis in the NHS and in supply chains as people struggle to return to work, not because they are ill but because the rules won’t let them.
<p>Ministers and their scientific advisers will doubtless say it is too early to remove testing requirements while omicron continues to spread. But there must come a time soon when this approach is abandoned.</p>

<p>To some extent, the causes of this crisis are beyond ministers’ control. All of Europe has suffered from big swings in energy prices, for example, thanks in part to Vladimir Putin’s brinkmanship over oil and gas supplies.</p>

<p>Swollen by regulations and spending, the British state now imposes the highest tax burden in 70 years, and many decisions, unless reversed, will severely restrict our freedoms in the future – and thus recovery.</p>
<p>Then there is the cost of living crisis, which a group of backbenchers sensibly suggests should be alleviated with tax relief. Indeed, it’s a chance, finally, to cash in on Brexit by scrapping VAT on heating bills.</p>

<p>With Christmas and New Year falling at a weekend, the festive break has been extended a few days into January but today should see a mass return to the office.</p>
<p>However, because of the rapid spread of the omicron variant, those who can work from home have been encouraged, if not instructed, to do so. This in itself is likely to mean the post-Yuletide commute is significantly reduced.</p>
<p>But even those who need, or want, to go into the office will find it harder to do so because of the impact of absenteeism on transport. Across the country, trains are being cancelled because there are not enough staff to run them or the stations.</p>
<p>Nor is it just transport that is struggling. Councils up and down the country are also cutting services, including the complete suspension of waste collections in some parts.</p>
<p>While people are being forced to isolate for what in most cases turns out to be a mild cold someone is dying from a heart attack or a stroke because help is coming too late. How is this approach sensible or sustainable?</p>

<h1> London’s Covid cases and admissions peak without overwhelming NHS, figures suggest </h1>
<p> Boris Johnson may have been right to avoid further curbs, with seven-day case rates having been falling in the capital since Dec 26 </p>
<div> <div> By Sarah Knapton, Science Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 1:47pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Covid cases and admissions in London appear to have peaked without overwhelming the NHS, suggesting that Boris Johnson was right to hold his nerve and avoid further restrictions.</p>
<p>Although Christmas and New Year reporting of the data has made the figures trickier to interpret, seven-day case rates in the capital have been falling since Dec 26.</p>
<p>There were significant declines in case numbers after Dec 21, before an anomalous high of 32,316 based on cases by specimen date on Dec 29.</p>
<p>The latest hospital data also show significant falls, with 314 patients admitted to hospital on Jan 1 compared to a peak of 511 on Dec 29.</p>
<p>Similarly, the growth rate of overall Covid patients in hospital has dropped considerably since the end of December and appears to be reaching a plateau.</p>
<h2>‘Glimmers of hope’ that there will not be a major surge </h2>
<p>Mr Hopson said there was evidence that London infections <a>peaked before Christmas</a> and have plateaued since, adding that there were "glimmers of hope" among NHS bosses that there would not now be a major surge.</p>
<a>translating into hospital admissions</a>.
<p>"If – a very big if – this much lower growth rate continues over next few days, [there is] growing optimism that London should be able to cope this week," he said in a thread outlining the current situation.</p>
<p>"Recent London data and the fact that London/NHS are currently coping and absence of large numbers of seriously ill offer grounds for optimism. But the future is still uncertain."</p>
<p>At least six NHS hospitals have <a>declared a critical incident</a>, but Mr Hopson said that was a sensible decision because it helped them allocate resources more effectively across the capital.</p>
<h2>Numbers skewed by ‘incidental Covid’ cases</h2>
<p>The hospital figures are also being skewed by a large number of "incidental Covid" cases – people who have been <a>admitted to hospital for other conditions</a> but have also tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>The most recent NHS data, which runs up to Dec 28, show that one third of reported "Covid" cases in London hospitals are people who were admitted "with" the disease but not "because" of it.</p>
<p>In the week from Dec 21 to Dec 28, there were 829 patients added to the London in-hospital Covid figures, of which 52 per cent (433) were "for" Covid and 48 per cent (396) were incidental cases.</p>
<p>Crucially, despite the rise in hospitalisation there has been almost no change in the number of people requiring mechanical ventilation in London and daily deaths have not risen higher than the 24 recorded on Dec 22.</p>
<p>The number of people in intensive care in the capital has been falling since the start of December, although case rates have begun rising in the over-60s, which may bring an increase in deaths.</p>
<p>Nationally, the number of cases has risen by 75 per cent in the past week, but experts said they would expect the rest of the country to follow the more positive London trajectory in the next two to three weeks.</p>
<p>"So we would expect to see case numbers start to come down between a week – maybe already coming down in London, but in other regions a week to three weeks."</p>
<p>London's hotspots, which saw large growth <a>before Christmas</a>, are now falling considerably. Lambeth, which saw steep early growth, peaked on Dec 15.</p>
<p>Prof Tim Spector, who leads the ZOE symptom tracker app, also said he believed cases were decreasing in London and slowing in the rest of Britain, adding: "It's great to see no real change in Covid deaths over the last month."</p>
<a>vaccination levels</a> are higher than in the capital, where only 68 per cent have had a first dose and fewer than 40 per cent
<p>In contrast, 83 per cent of people in the North East have had a first dose, and 57 per cent have been boosted.</p>
<h2>Main NHS pressure ‘coming from lack of staff’</h2>
<p>Many experts now believe that the main pressure on the NHS is being driven by <a>a lack of staff</a>, coupled with the treatment backlog caused by the pandemic response, rather than Covid cases.</p>
<p>Prof Spector called for the isolation rules to be <a>cut to five days</a> from seven, as has happened in the US.</p>
<p>Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told Times Radio that, for many, "the most pressing element of all" is the number of staff absent due to Covid and said hospital admissions seem to have "perhaps plateaued in London".</p>
<p>Mr Hopson said many NHS trusts were already facing historic staff shortages and recruitment problems caused by a "broken workforce model" which required greater investment and long-term planning.</p>

<h1> Sir Keir Starmer: The self-styled bastion of democracy who made no fewer than 48 attempts to block Brexit </h1>
<p> As he accuses Boris Johnson of corruption, Labour leader’s own history when it comes to respecting democratic process should be remembered </p>
<div> <div> By Camilla Tominey, Associate Editor <time> 8 November 2021 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>It was the self-righteous rhetoric of a man keen to capitalise on the political fallout from an abominable week for the Tories.</p>
<a> the Owen Paterson row</a>, Sir Keir Starmer claimed the Prime Minister “had damaged himself, damaged his party and damaged his democracy” by trying to overturn the standards system last week.
<p>Yet amid all the pious hyperbole expressed in the House of Commons on Monday, Sir Keir’s own chequered history when it comes to respecting the democratic process appeared conspicuous by its absence.</p>
<p>As the shadow cabinet’s resident arch remainer<a>, Sir Keir </a>was at the forefront of attempts to overturn the mandate that 52 per cent of the British public voted for in 2016.</p>
<p>Research suggests that the Labour leader and self-styled bastion of democracy made no fewer than 48 attempts to undo the will of more than 17 million people by using every trick in the parliamentary book to block Brexit.</p>
<p>After repeatedly voting against the EU Withdrawal Act, which would ensure a smooth exit from the bloc in 2017, Sir Keir spent 2018 and 2019 rebelling against every piece of leave legislation that came through the House of Commons.</p>
<h2>Sir Keir’s voting record on Brexit</h2>
<a>Immigration Bill </a>to end free movement as well as twice voting against the Customs Bill that gave the UK the power to make its own trade deals. He also twice voted against the Trade Bill, which set out the framework to make new trade deals.
<p>As well as voting against the first, second and third Meaningful Votes in 2019, that year Sir Keir also voted in favour of a second referendum with the aim of blocking Brexit on three separate occasions.</p>
<p>Seemingly desperate to keep up ties with Brussels, that month he voted for the UK seeking full membership of the Erasmus programme and anchoring UK workers’ rights to those set by the EU.</p>
<a>Northern Ireland Protocol </a>as well as voting for the Government to have to seek approval for the objectives of negotiations with the EU. He also voted to limit Britain’s power to create laws on the Protocol. 
<h2>Further attempts to keep British courts bound by EU case law</h2>
<a>(EU Withdrawal) Bill </a>was put before the Commons to take back control of our borders by ending free movement and bringing overall immigration numbers down, Sir Keir voted against it not once, but twice.
<p>The former Director of Public Prosecutions made further attempts to keep British courts bound by EU case law.</p>
<p>He also twice rebelled against the Agriculture Bill, which ensured we have a post-Brexit framework for our farming subsidy regime. Furthermore, he voted against no less than 11 Statutory Instruments required for delivering Brexit. </p>
<p>All of which may go some way to explaining why the latest polling suggests 41 per cent of people do not believe Sir Keir would make a good replacement Prime Minister. </p>
<header> <h1>Jeremy Corbyn repeatedly refuses to confirm he will kneel before the Queen</h1> <p>The Labour leader refused to answer the question three times and instead claimed he does not know 'what the ceremony involves'</p> </header>
<div> <div> By Kate Mccann <time> 09 October 2015 • 6:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Jeremy Corbyn has refused to confirm whether he will kneel before the Queen three times as he failed to explain why he did not turn up to a meeting of the privy council with the monarch. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>On Thursday the Labour leader was accused of snubbing the Queen after it emerged he was <a>taking a short break</a> rather than attending the meeting in London. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Mr Corbyn, a republican, confirmed he will attend the council in future but repeatedly refused to answer when asked if he will observe tradition and kneel before the monarch. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Instead he claimed he does not know "what the ceremony involves" during an interview with the BBC. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>It came as the Labour leader accused the Prime Minister and his senior cabinet colleagues of lying during a speech in Glasgow. </p> </div> </div>
<p>Despite claiming he would <a>not resort to personal attacks</a> or respond to any made against him the Labour leader said the Conservative party conference was "a feast of spin and deception" and accused David Cameron of making "fake claims". </p>
<div> <div> <p>It follows <a>Mr Cameron's conference speech</a> in which he claimed Mr Corbyn has a "security-threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating ideology". </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In an apparent rebuttal of the Prime Minister's own Manchester speech the Labour leader accused senior ministers of "letting the mask slip" - despite his vow to usher in a kinder era of politics. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>In a speech in Scotland he said: "The Tory conference was a feast of spin and deception."</p> </div> </div>
<p>He added that ministers made "fake claims" about helping low-paid families, fighting poverty and supporting equality, adding: “And it wasn't just Theresa May who let the mask slip to reveal how far the Tories are from the common ground. </p>
<div> <div> <p>"Jeremy Hunt showed low paid workers just what the Tories really think of them when he said their Tax Credits had to be cut to make them graft. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"So behind the spin and the rhetoric we could all see out of their own mouths it was the same old Tories."</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Just days before his strongly worded address in Glasgow Mr Corbyn spoke of the need to tackle ideas, not personalities and bemoaned the media for ignoring his policies. </p> </div> </div>
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Starmer's speech proves Labour is still navel gazing </h1> <p> The Labour leader must stop pandering to his party and start working out what ordinary voters want </p> </div> </div> </header>

<p>The thing about contracts is that they can only be entered into willingly by each party. Announcing a new contract between yourself and X, without reference to X or to what X actually wants, seems a touch arrogant.</p>
<p>Moreover, to announce a new contract two years after the last contract negotiations, when X rejected any notion that it even wanted to do business with your firm, reeks of unjustified optimism. </p>
<p>If he doesn’t, then 2022 is going to be a very long year for him and his party.</p>
