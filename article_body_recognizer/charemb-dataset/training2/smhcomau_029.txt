<p>“I was pretty surprised at it, to be honest, but at the end of the day as tennis players we’re entertainers and as long as the crowd are enjoying it I think we’re doing our job,” he said.</p>
<p>“Obviously it’s got to be water off a duck’s back. You’re focused on trying to win the match, but it was definitely a different experience.”</p>
<p>Kyrgios’ game is unsettling enough, with his underarm between the legs serve and “tweener” lobs that are so disarming that other players had warned Broady to be ready to be made to look silly.</p>

<div>‘Time for bed’: Police called to move on partying Australian and England cricketers</div>
<div><div><h5>By Tom Decent</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 18, 2022 — 2.08pm</time></span><span>first published at <time>12.28pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>English media are reporting the voice behind the camera is 52-year-old England batting coach Graham Thorpe, the former Test batter.</p>
<p>Multiple news outlets are reporting that Thorpe could also face the sack after he was found responsible for the footage, which ended up being shared widely.</p>
<p>Cricket Australia declined to comment.</p>
<p>“Too loud,” a female officer is heard saying to the group. “You have obviously been asked to pack up, so we’ve been asked to come. Time for bed. Thank you. They just want to pack up.”</p>
<p>Australia and England both stayed at the Crowne Plaza Hobart, and a number of hotel staff are also seen in the video. Beer bottles and a Red Bull can are on the table.</p>
<p>The Australian and England players, unwinding after a long series, left the outdoor area straight away when asked by police.</p>
<p>“No worries,” says Lyon in the video.</p>
<p>In a statement received by the Herald and The Age, Tasmania Police said officers were called after a complaint regarding “intoxicated” individuals.</p>
<p>“No further action will be taken by police.”</p>
<p>“To the best of my knowledge there was some noise complaints from outside,” Ms Collins told the Herald and The Age. </p>
<p>Playersclearly had hoped to stick around for a few more drinks after a Test in which Australia defeated England by 146 runs to wrap up a 4-0 series win.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the ECB said it was investigating and sources familiar with the situation said the focus will be on how the footage came to be in the public domain.</p>
<p>“During the early hours of Monday morning, members of the England and Australia men’s teams shared a drink in the team areas of the hotel in Hobart,” read the statement.</p>
<p>“The ECB will investigate further. Until such times, we will make no further comment.”</p>
<p>The teams had finished playing in the fifth Ashes Test at Blundstone Arena late on Sunday evening, given it was a day-night Test match. Both teams were still tied up with formalities until close to midnight at the ground.</p>
<p>The Australian team continued celebrations on Monday by drinking at a Hobart pub and singing songs with the Barmy Army, according to social media posts.</p>
<p>Players will break off on Tuesday and head back to their respective states.</p>
<div>Commitment pays off as Inglis scores huge upset</div>
<p>Maddison Inglis’ heart was singing after she broke her grand slam drought with a stunning upset of US Open finalist Leylah Fernandez on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A day before her 6-4, 6-2 defeat of the Canadian, Inglis’ mother Linda had told the 24-year-old she should be very proud to be competing in an Australian Open.</p>
<p>It is a long way from Geraldton, Western Australia, where Inglis can remember travelling as a teenager for tournaments, and other far-flung places visited when making her way through the ranks.</p>
<p>“We started tennis just as a bonding thing with my mum and I,” Inglis said.</p>
<p>“She said the other day: ‘I’m so proud of you that you’re playing in the Australian Open. It’s amazing.’</p>
<p>“I think sometimes you just have to look back and think of the journey and that you are at one of the biggest tournaments in the world. It’s pretty special.”</p>
<p>Fellow Western Australian Storm Sanders on Tuesday night threatened to produce an even bigger upset when leading Aryna Sabalenka by a set and a service break but could not finish off the world No. 2.</p>
<p>Inglis, after receiving an Australian Open wildcard as a teenager in 2016, found the transition to senior ranks difficult but decided to truly test herself a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>She based herself in Brisbane, decided to travel abroad amid the uncertainty of COVID-19 and vowed to push herself out of her comfort zone in as many events as possible.</p>
<p>“I thought to get to the next stage, I’m going to have to play these bigger tournaments and the better players. I think that definitely helped me going into today,” she said.</p>
<p>As a result of that commitment at a time when the borders to her native WA have been closed, she has been unable to return home to Perth since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>The circumstances made Tuesday’s maiden win at her fifth attempt in a major all the more special. She next plays American Hailey Baptiste on Thursday.</p>
<p>“I had thought of that moment for a long time. It was just pure happiness. I was so happy,” Inglis said.</p>
<p>“I’m really so happy I could have it here in Melbourne with all my friends and family there. It was incredible.”</p>
<p>Their career circumstances are very different, but the excitement felt by Inglis mirrored that of veteran Sam Stosur about an hour earlier in what is her 20th and final Australian Open.</p>
<p>Shortly after extending her farewell lap another round, the former US Open champion sat relieved in her courtside chair, taking in the celebrations.</p>
<p>“Man, that was incredible. That’s a match I’m going to remember forever,” Stosur said.</p>
<p>“It is one of the best singles matches I have played in a very long time. And to do it at home today, I guess it wasn’t to be the last one, so [I’m] happy to have another one.”</p>
<p>Stosur’s family and friends were also in attendance, just in case it was her final singles match.</p>
<p>In the stands, coach Rennae Stubbs shed a tear as the former world No.4 rallied from a set deficit to set up an encounter against 10th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.</p>
<p>After defeating Serena Williams to claim the 2011 US Open, Stosur for years carried the burden of local hopes at her home slam and found it overwhelming.</p>
<p>On her final trip to Melbourne Park, the tension related more to whether Stosur would produce a performance befitting what has proven an incredible career in all bar the city she resides, the doubles and mixed titles she has won at home aside.</p>
<p>The longer the match went, the more Stosur found her rhythm and displayed the variety that made her an outstanding singles player at her best.</p>
<p>Stosur will be back again on Thursday, where she will bid to reach the third round here for the first time in her thirties. Her approach will be the same again.</p>
<p>“It has been the goal coming into the last couple of months playing singles, to enjoy myself, try and play as best as I can,” she said.</p>
<p>“Every time I have been able to do that in my career, I enjoyed it. Win or lose, that is all you can ask for.”</p>
<p>Sanders led Sabalenka 7-5, 3-1. Sabalenka’s frustration was evident as she struggled for her best, but she went for the kill shot against Sanders by drilling a ball straight at her from close range.</p>
<p>The surge of adrenalin clearly worked as the Belarusian, a semi-finalist at Wimbledon and the US Open last year, reeled off nine games in succession.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old ultimately progressed 5-7, 6-3, 6-2 and will play Wang Xinyu next.</p>
<p>Daria Saville struggled in her return to grand slam tennis after a serious lower leg injury, beaten 6-2, 6-3 by Swede Rebecca Peterson.</p>
<p>Marketa Vondrousova was a 6-2, 6-3 victor over Priscilla Hon, another Australian returning to major level after injury.</p>

<div>‘We won’t mistreat them’: Serbian President allays fears of visiting Aussie athletes</div>
<p>Members of the Australian Opals basketball team are bracing for a hostile reaction from Serbian fans when they play in a World Cup qualifying tournament in Belgrade next month, after Novak Djokovic’s humiliating deportation.</p>
<p>But Serbia’s President says his country will not take out its anger with the Australian government on the nation’s sports stars visiting the country to compete in the next two months.</p>
<p>The Opals play a tournament in the Serbian capital in February, and Australia’s track and field elite are due to attend the World Athletics Indoor Championships there in March.</p>
<p>“We will not mistreat them due to elections,” President Aleksandar Vucic said of the Australian athletes, who have nervously worried about what the Djokovic imbroglio will mean for them flying into the country.</p>
<p>Having previously described Djokovic as a scapegoat for the Australian government, Vucic claimed the looming federal election drove Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his government’s decision to rescind Djokovic’s visa and deport him.</p>
<p>Vucic said his country would not treat athletes as political pawns.</p>
<p>“We will show that we are better than the Australian government,” Vucic said.</p>
<p>But the reaction of Serbian fans – many of whom regard Djokovic as a national icon – could be another matter.</p>
<p>Rising Australian basketballer Shyla Heal, who was the No.8 pick in the 2021 WNBA draft, will be among the Opals squad playing against Korea, Brazil and Serbia in the World Cup qualifiers from February 10 to 13.</p>
<p>Heal said the Opals are expecting some heat from the home crowds over the Djokovic controversy.</p>
<p>“Look we definitely know the fans are going at us, that’s for sure. But mentally we are prepared,” Heal said.</p>
<p>“But for me, personally, if the crowd is getting into it and yelling out stuff, that motivates me to play better, I fuel off that. So, I will like it if they’re like that.”</p>
<p>Heal joked: “We will need to get our documentation down pat [before landing].”</p>
<p>Twenty Australian athletics competitors will be at the world indoors from March 18 to 20.</p>
<p>World Athletics and Australian Athletics have been concerned the Serbian government would look to avenge their country’s star sportsman in some way.</p>
<p>Australian Athletics’ general manager of high performance Andrew Faichney said the comments of the Serbian president would ease athletes’ worries after the Djokovic issue.</p>
<p>“We are relieved to have the reassurance that our athletes can go and compete. It’s great any question mark has been removed for them,” Faichney said.</p>
<p>“I am sure it would have been on their minds as well, so to have that question mark removed gives them some surety.”</p>
<p>All of Australia’s athletes going to Serbia for the world indoors are double-vaccinated as all of them went to the Tokyo Olympics last year, where vaccination was required.</p>
<p>Hurdler Chris Douglas, who didn’t go to the Olympics but has since qualified for the world indoors, is believed to be fully vaccinated.</p>
<p>The event forms part of a packed athletics year with the outdoor world championships in Eugene, Oregon, in July finishing only a week before the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, England, in August.</p>
<p>High jumper and Olympic silver medallist Nicola McDermott, sprint star Rohan Browning, and middle distance champion Stewart McSweyn will all go to Serbia.</p>
<p>Olympic decathlon bronze medallist Ash Moloney will also go to Belgrade for the world indoors and compete in a heptathlon (seven events, rather than the decathlon’s 10).</p>
<p>Due to the taxing nature of the decathlon, Moloney is highly unlikely to compete at the Commonwealth Games, instead focussing on the world championships, however he is yet to make a final decision.</p>

<h3><a>Use-by date on the Commonwealth looks to be up</a></h3>
<p>Is the Commonwealth still fit for purpose in the 21st century?</p>
<div>Melbourne set to step into breach as 2026 Commonwealth Games host city</div>
<p>A senior Victorian government official revealed that following an approach from the CGF, feasibility studies are under way to determine if the state can justify hosting the event, with a focus on regional centres.</p>
<p>With Melbourne the only city interested and the Games only four years away, the state government can dictate its terms, such as the 5000 competing athletes being housed mainly in existing hotels, rather than having accommodation built.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Games Australia chief executive Craig Phillips – bound by confidentiality provisions – said: “For a number of months now, we have been talking to a number of states about hosting the 2026 Games.”</p>
<p>Phillips, like his colleagues in other Commonwealth countries, has found it difficult asking governments to commit to major events during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Perth recently withdrew from the process as West Australian Premier Mark McGowan insulates his state from the COVID-19 pandemic and the city lacks an established site for a Games Village.</p>
<p>Adelaide publicly announced some time ago it was not proceeding with a bid.</p>
<p>Brisbane has already been chosen as host of the 2032 Summer Olympics, meaning a 2026 Commonwealth Games in Australia would be an ideal lead-in, guaranteeing support from the Australian Olympic Committee.</p>
<p>Melbourne, with its established sporting facilities and its success in hosting the 2006 Games, is a logical choice, particularly given the short four-year timeframe now needed.</p>
<p>Canada has flagged interest in bidding for the 2030 Games, which would be held in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the first Games (then called Empire), which were in Hamilton, Ontario.</p>
<p>This is consistent with an election pledge of the incumbent Labor government that a future Commonwealth Games in the state would embrace regional centres.</p>
<p>It is also consistent with the planning for the 2032 Summer Olympics, which will have a focus on south-east Queensland, not simply Brisbane.</p>
<p>The days of “white elephant” sporting arenas are over, as governments, particularly local councils, invest in multi-use facilities suitable for staging a number of events concurrently.</p>
<p>With Queen Elizabeth now aged 95, a Melbourne Commonwealth Games potentially opened by King Charles would have a degree of poignancy.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at a 2026 Games, but we’ve made no commitment,” the senior government official said.</p>

<div>Bombdiggity primed for success despite weight gain, says Collings</div>
<p>Bombdiggity has never raced better.</p>
<p>That’s the frank assessment of Goulburn-based trainer Scott Collings before his six-year-old sprinter lines up at Cowra on Sunday in the Breakout River Cowra Japan Cup (1200m).</p>
<p>“The last bit of the 1200m with big weights has always been the query, at 900m or 1000m short-course sprinters can cope, but I still think it’s a nice race for him,” Collings told Racing NSW’s Tony Megahey.</p>
<p>“He’s a natural leader, that’s our plan, he relaxes in races and hopefully we might be able to give them the slip with that short run home.”</p>
<p>The tight-turning Cowra track has a straight of just 250m so inside draws are a premium.</p>
<p>“We looked around and this race was the best option at the weights. On form, I don’t think this race is as strong as Moruya or Gilgandra,” said Collings, whose stable has had nine winners from its last 26 runners.</p>
<p>“We’ve kept him fresh, he’s never raced better.”</p>
<p>Bombdiggity has won two of his four starts this campaign but is starting to pay the penalty for his career-best form by going up at the weights.</p>
<p>The son of Zoustar will carry 61kg, even after the 2kg claim of young apprentice jockey Jackson Searle.</p>
<p>First up, Bombdiggity won the Snake Gully Flying Handicap over 1000m before running fifth at Warwick Farm. That was before winning again back to country company in the Narooma Town Plate at Moruya.</p>
<p>Last start, Bombdiggity ran third in the Gilgandra Town Plate but a slow getaway meant he settled further back than he typically does.</p>
<p>Collings has four runners across the meeting and believes his four-year-old mare Tiff’s Finale is ready to crack her maiden in the 950m scamper.</p>
<p>“She’s drawn, race-fit mare in the right race off Canberra and Goulburn placings, and you know you’ll get the right ride with Matty [Cahill],” he said.</p>

<div>McDonald masterpiece gives Coolangatta the Magic Millions Classic</div>
<p>Australia’s premier jockey James McDonald once again proved the difference as Coolangatta stayed unbeaten after taking the Magic Millions Classic at the Gold Coast yesterday.</p>
<p>Trainers Ciaron Maher and David Eustace admitted they were nervous when McDonald made his winning move on the home turn after travelling on the speed, outside the main danger, Russian Conquest.</p>
<p>″⁣She has been at the top of our two-year-olds this season from early on and she just keeps stepping up. That was just a quality win. We will give her a couple of weeks off and get her back to Sydney for the Golden Slipper.″⁣</p>
<p>Coolangatta popped three wide and put a couple of lengths on Russian Conquest, who was left to have the final shot at the favourite.</p>
<p>Kerrin McEvoy on Russian Conquest followed Coolangatta and then launched at 200m but could only get within a long neck with Snitcat left 2 lengths away in third.</p>
<p>″⁣When I got off [Coolangatta’s] back I thought I would get her,″⁣ McEvoy said. ″⁣She is a pretty good filly, but so is mine.″⁣</p>
<p>McDonald was full of praise for Coolangatta, which was one out, one back, before making her winning move and hitting the front on straightening.</p>
