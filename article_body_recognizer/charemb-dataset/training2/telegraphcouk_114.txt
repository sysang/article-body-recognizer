<h1> Star publisher Rosie De Courcy: 'I consoled Nadine Dorries when critics slated her novel' </h1>
<p> She stood up to Robert Maxwell, discovered some of fiction's biggest names and has faith in Dorries's literary skills. Meet Rosie De Courcey </p>
<div> <div> By Anna Tyzack <time> 4 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>“Nadine is one of the most gifted storytellers I’ve ever come across,” De Courcy insists. “There’s such snobbery and sexism out there, both literary and social, but I loved her from the word go.”</p>
<p>“I agreed to an orderly handover and he paid more maternity pay than I was due and allowed me to take Binchy – who he hadn’t heard of – with me. He could be generous, but he was never kind.”</p>
<p>De Courcy’s marriage to Cheetham ended in 1995 but she’s now working with him again, at Head of Zeus, the publishing start-up he founded in 2012 and which is now run by his eldest son, Nicholas, from his second marriage. </p>

<header> <h1> Surge in demand for Robert Maxwell biography after daughter Ghislaine’s trial </h1> <p> Fall, John Preston’s book about the disgraced media mogul, lands Costa award as reader interest piqued by trial of socialite </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Craig Simpson <time> 4 January 2022 • 9:34pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>A Robert Maxwell biography has become Penguin’s most sought-after title after the trial of his daughter Ghislaine captured the imagination of readers.</p>
<a>Fall: The Mystery of Robert Maxwell</a>.
<p>The book, which is published by Viking and is already being adapted into a TV series, has seen a surge in interest following <a>the conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell</a> for child sex trafficking.</p>
<p>Penguin Random House, Viking’s parent company, has said that following the trial, the biography of the former media mogul has now become the most sought-after title among booksellers buying copies from the publisher for future sale.</p>
<a>wider Maxwell family</a>.”
<p>Fall charts the life of <a>Robert Maxwell</a> from his childhood in Czechoslovakia to his much-debated death aboard his yacht the Lady Ghislaine in 1991, a death coroners said was caused by the 22-stone businessman suffering a heart attack.</p>
<p>Preston said his examination of the former Mirror Group newspaper proprietor, who following his death was found to have used company pension funds to prop up his business empire, was an attempt to “humanise” the disgraced media mogul.</p>
<p>The author has previously said that Robert Maxwell had “turned into a pantomime villain, and so much black paint had been poured over his reputation that he’d lost all nuance”.</p>
<p>The book, now being adapted into a series by Working Title Films – the same studios behind Bridget Jones’s Diary and Love Actually – was named the best biography at the Costa Book Awards.</p>
<p>The category win follows Preston’s success with <a>A Very English Scandal</a>, which was adapted into a BBC series featuring <a>Hugh Grant as Jeremy Thorpe</a>, the disgraced Liberal leader.</p>
<p>The former Telegraph journalist has also enjoyed success with <a>The Dig</a>, a historical novel based on the discovery of the Sutton Hoo ship burial, which was turned into a Netflix film starring Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes.</p>
<p>The overall winner will be announced at an awards ceremony on February 1, and will receive a prize of £30,000.</p>

<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Ed Power <time> 4 January 2022 • 6:02pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<a>Aisling Bea</a>. So why has Jodie Whittaker’s tenure as the first female Time Lord, hailed as the start of a brave new era four years ago, received such a lukewarm reception?
<p>But the main obstacle has been the scripts under showrunner Chris Chibnall. They have been simplistic and cliché-ridden – and that’s when they have made any sense.</p>
<p>Whittaker’s legacy is hard to assess because recent plots have been such gibberish. Would any of her predecessors have fared any better wading through the dreadful Flux?</p>
<a> Russell T Davies</a>, responsible for the triumphant 2005 reboot, would be returning to oversee proceedings.
<h1> Toast of Tinseltown, review: a deserved encore for the UK’s most ludicrous thesp </h1>

<p>The show started life on Channel 4 as Toast of London, which ran from 2012-15 and developed a cult following. Now it has been revived on BBC Two, and fans of the original can be reassured that nothing has been lost in the move.</p>
<a>played by Matt Berry</a>, is still a self-important idiot of a man with a booming delivery and a conviction that he is one of Britain’s great thespians. When we meet him again, little has changed: he still lives with retired actor Ed (
<a>Cold Feet’s Robert Bathurst</a>), has Jane Plough (Doon Mackichan) as his agent and Ray Purchase (Harry Peacock) as his nemesis.
