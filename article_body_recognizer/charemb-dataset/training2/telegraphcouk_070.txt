<header> <h1> How to buy the best family car – and grab a bargain </h1> <p> Whether you're choosing an SUV or figuring out where to buy your new car, our expert has the answers in this easy-to-follow guide </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Alex Robbins, Contributing Editor <time> 2 December 2021 • 12:23pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Nowadays, though, it’s not quite that easy. What’s the most financially responsible way of doing it? Can you allow yourself the frisson of excitement a new car brings, or should you be sensible and perhaps buy used?</p>
<h2>What makes a good family car?</h2>
<p>Finally, how many seats do you really need? You might not think you need a seven-seater, but if you are planning lots of days out with kids and grandparents you may find one of these proves more useful than you expect.</p>
<p>Conversely, if you can make do with five seats, you’ll widen the choice of cars available to you.</p>
<p>It’s a contentious question. As the SUV craze sweeps the country, many people are asking: do we really need them?</p>
<p>For families, it’s clear where the advantages lie. The raised seating positions of SUVs make it easier to buckle up child seats and give children a better view, which helps with avoiding car sickness.</p>
<p>Modern SUVs also tend to be replete with clever features such as sliding rear seats that make the space on offer inside more flexible, trading boot space for rear legroom.</p>
<p>An SUV isn’t the answer to everything, however. For one thing, they tend to use a little more fuel than the equivalent family car – especially if they’re equipped with more powerful engines and four-wheel drive, as many are.</p>
<p>The pros and cons of buying new and used aren’t quite the same as they once were. Chiefly, this is because new car production is currently being hit by a shortage of electronic components brought about by the pandemic. </p>
<p>As the first Covid-19 lockdowns kicked in, semiconductor and computer-chip suppliers switched supply away from cars, for which demand had dropped off completely, and over to electronics, for which demand shot up.</p>
<p>As a result, many who are coming to the end of their lease periods or finance terms are facing months without a replacement and are looking to buy used instead. That, in turn, is pushing up the value of used cars.</p>
<h2>Where to buy a family car</h2>
<p>Most people buying a car will head to their local dealer once they’ve decided what they want. But that might not be the way to get the best deal.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re buying new or leasing, you may find there are better deals to be had with brokers or with specialist leasing companies, whose economies of scale might mean they can beat dealers on price.</p>
<h2>Financing vs buying outright</h2>
<p>Chances are you probably don’t plan on buying your family car outright – after all, about nine in 10 British buyers now use some sort of finance to obtain their new car.</p>
<p>The great thing about using a PCP to buy your car is that it makes paying for it much easier, with a downpayment that’s a fraction of the full price of your car, and relatively affordable monthly repayments after that.</p>
<p>Buying outright, on the other hand, gives you greater flexibility – you own the car from the word go, so you can keep it as long as you need and sell it whenever you want to.</p>
<p>That means they’re great if you’re financially secure and want to save yourself some cash compared with financing a car – but might be less than ideal otherwise.</p>
<h2>Petrol versus diesel versus hybrid versus electric</h2>
<p>Fully electric cars can make brilliant family transport these days, too. There are plenty of long-range options that can travel 250-300 miles on a full charge, which is more than enough for a family day out.</p>

<p>Future drivers will learn how to conserve their battery and drive with one pedal. It all sounds about as skilful and thrilling as trundling a golf cart round the greens.</p>
<p>I don’t want a car that does everything for me. Driving should be a skill and a challenge. And in the old days, the first challenge was whether the car would start.</p>
<p>My early one had a starter handle – not because I’m 100 years old but I was a member of the Vintage Sports Car Club and owned an open-top 1932 Riley Gamecock with running boards, which Al Capone would have envied.</p>
<p>Some cars had names. My Triumph Herald Convertible was called, inevitably, The Ark – ‘Ark the ‘Erald - and when my waters broke, I nearly gave birth in Blodwen, my Morris Minor.</p>
<p>The disadvantages? Your car will simply be a characterless way of getting from A to B.</p>

<header> <h1> How to stay safe when driving through flood water in the UK </h1> <p> Hazardous conditions on the roads following torrential rain overnight should give cause for concern. Here's how to stay safe </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Alex Robbins <time> 28 December 2021 • 7:55am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Wet roads mean that stopping distances increase, while deep – even deceptively shallow-looking – water poses a particular threat to road traffic.</p>
<h2>What should I do if I encounter a flood?</h2>
<p>Avoid going too fast into even quite shallow puddles as that can lead to aquaplaning, where the front tyres will no longer steer the car and you lose control. It is also inconsiderate and illegal to soak pedestrians.</p>
<p>When you emerge from the water, dry the brakes by using them gently, and if there were leaves in the water, check the radiator for blockages.</p>
<p>Another thing to watch out for is the lunatics coming the other way. You might be observing all the best advice, but big 4x4s or trucks racing though in the opposite direction can create such bow waves they drown your car.</p>
<p>The Environment Agency and the AA strongly advise against entering flood water that is moving or more than 10cm deep.</p>

<p>You’ll have guessed by now that this is an inexact science, less about numbers and more about gut feeling, driving experience and that wonderful judging aid of hindsight.</p>
<p>In the end it’s my list and these are the cars I think the most important, best looking – and fun. Doubtless you’ll have your own list containing some of these cars and some that aren’t here, so let us know your favourites.</p>
<div>The Double-Six name goes back but among the nicest incarnations were the Jaguar XJ6-based cars which combined elegance, refinement and considerable urge from the Walter Hassan, Harry Mundy and Claude Baily-designed 5.3-litre V12.</div>
<div>Vauxhall got the band back together for this one, the second generation of the Cavalier but the first to drive from the front.</div>
<div>Aviation provided inspiration for Gabriel Voisin’s cars, which featured aluminium monocoque bodies and engines, along with early streamlining techniques including pontoon front wings – Voisins were very advanced and looked amazing.</div>
<div>The first example of the Bristol Aeroplane Company’s plan to move into car-making was based on the drivetrain of the BMW 328 and the body construction of the 326; no one could accuse them of having bad taste.</div>
<div>In 1919 this was the most advanced passenger car you could own. It even had a mechanical brake servo running off the transmission, which Rolls-Royce bought a licence for.</div>
<div>Along with the Riley Imp and Sprite, the MPH was one of the prettiest cars of its era. It was clearly derived from the Zagato-bodied Alfa Romeos but even lovelier, with a gorgeous rounded tail.</div>
<div>The Jazz (aka Fit), was launched in Europe in 2001. Built around the world, it was a genuine phenomenon, a supermini with space for four adults and high levels of safety thanks to clever construction and design.</div>

<div>Mazda traditionally ploughs its own furrow and its long love affair with the Wankel rotary engine is one example. The RX-7 was launched in 1978 and, with a fastback-style body, decent suspension and revvy rotary engine, it sold well.</div>
<div>Designed by Ferdinand Porsche before he moved on, the mighty Super Sport Kurz (Super Sport Short) was one of the most formidable cars of its day.</div>
<div>Based on the chassis structure of 450 SEAC, the Griffith had no peers when it was launched in 1991, though it was more than just a hairy-chested, V8-engined two-seater.</div>
<div>“Grace and space with pace” is how they used to advertise Jags and nowhere was this more true than in the voluptuous Mark 2, particularly in its apotheosis, the 220bhp/240lb ft 3.8-litre with optional overdrive.</div>
<div>From today’s perspective, Paul Bracq’s E21 replacement for the 02 series is just about perfect, so clean and defined, with the resolution of the BMW kidney grille much more assured than today’s outsized monstrosities.</div>
<div>The replacement for the F430 and the last naturally-aspirated V8 mid-engined Ferrari. Its yowling 562bhp/398lb ft V8 is terrific although the only transmission option, a seven-speed dual-clutch Getrag unit, is heavy and occasionally crude.</div>
<div>The TT Replica was based on the cars which raced in the 1931 Tourist Trophy, with the most popular engine being 1.5-litre, four-cylinders from Meadows or Gough.</div>
<div>Envisaged by the renowned Vauxhall engineer Laurence Pomeroy as a replacement for the Prince Henry, the first 30/98 was billed as “the car of grace that sets the pace”.</div>
<div>Britain’s people’s car, championed by Sir Herbert Austin, with design by Stanley Edge. Launched at Claridge’s Hotel on July 21 1921, it eventually outsold all its rivals.</div>
<div>Unveiled in 1993 as a relatively crude concept, a more sophisticated production Prius hit the market in 1997 and trickled to the UK in 2000 - it’s now in its fourth generation.</div>
<div>While the rest of the world went over to front-wheel-drive, Ford stuck resolutely to driving the rear wheels and in the process created one of the world’s greatest rally weapons as well as a range of decent family cars.</div>
<div>Whatever you think of Elon Musk and his vocal band of aficionados, the pure electric Model S was a remarkable achievement even if it isn’t quite the “disruptive technology” that Musk claims.</div>
<div>Through 45 years, eight generations and 35 million sold, the Golf has established squatters’ rights on Europe's best-selling car slot. And it’s also the world’s second best-selling car name after Toyota’s Corolla.</div>
<div>Ransom Olds developed the automotive production line, but Henry Ford took it to new heights. Everything hummed at the River Rouge plant in Detroit; Ford even bought forests to secure his wood supplies and rubber supplies for the tyres.</div>

<h1> UK’s rarest cars: 1978 Chrysler Sunbeam 1.6S Automatic, one of only two left on British roads </h1>
<p> This staggeringly rare hatchback had a troubled gestation but provided agreeable, if unspectacular, family transport for a modest price </p>
<div> <div> By Andrew B Roberts <time> 3 December 2021 • 4:28pm </time> </div> </div>
<a>Thames TV’s Drive In</a> he found it roomy and practical. Autocar similarly remarked: “The Sunbeam may not be the world’s most advanced or imaginative small car, but it has its share of good points.” 
<a> rebadged as a Talbot in August 1979 (as were the Avenger and Alpine</a>).
<a>one of only two 1.6S Automatics still on the road</a>. It is also the sole survivor fitted with a Webasto sunroof, while the transmission is the rarely specified four-speed Borg Warner 45 ’box.
<p>When new, the Sunbeam virtually prided itself on its innocuous appearance, but Hedger finds his example to be “a head-turner. As hardly any remain on the road, everyone comments on how they haven’t seen one in decades”.</p>
<p>And some were instantly reminded of the small Chrysler with the power, according to Petula Clark, to “put a smile on your face”.</p>
<p>Thanks to: Roy Hedger and the <a>Avenger and Sunbeam Owners’ Club</a> </p>
