<h3><a>Voters not sold on Morrison’s management of Omicron crisis</a></h3>
<p>Crises can sometimes help political incumbents if they take command but it is looking increasingly likely the unexpected surge of Omicron is bad news for the Prime Minister.</p>
<h3>Summer of frustration has angered voters</h3>
<p>The latest Resolve Political Monitor shows the nation is gripped by a growing sense of pessimism, a bad sign for an incumbent federal government on the cusp of an election campaign.</p>
<h3>Election year demands vision from major parties</h3>
<p>The “vision thing”, as then US presidential aspirant George Bush snr put it in 1987, has prompted mixed reactions in Australia.</p>
<h3>Politicians must heed their health experts</h3>
<p>They can’t say they weren’t warned. Now hospital systems are being pushed to the limit and ramifications - from health to the economy - are clear.</p>
<h3>The discrete charm of McMansions in a pandemic</h3>
<p>Demand for large houses has grown as a result of lockdowns and working-from-home but it comes at a cost.</p>
<h3>Time needed to assess new model for an Australian republic</h3>
<p>The symbolic connection between Australia and Britain is increasingly irrelevant to Australia’s multicultural society but the details of a plan for a republic will need refining, and it faces significant headwinds.</p>
<h3>Relaxing safety rules to fix staff shortages risks a vicious cycle</h3>
<p>Further relaxation of isolation rules should only be in strategic sectors of the economy and based on the best scientific evidence of infection control.</p>
<h3>By its very nature, Djokovic’s is an exceptional case</h3>
<p>If we are to “ride the wave” of our own Omicron tsunami, it’s difficult to understand the practical utility of deporting one unvaccinated man.</p>
<h3>Vaccine supplies a priority in trying to ‘push through’ the virus</h3>
<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison stresses that on the “best medical advice”, we need to “push through” and open up despite being forced to “ride the wave” of Omicron infections.</p>
<h3>Governments can’t wing return to school plan</h3>
<p>State and federal governments need to outline now what the start of the school year will look like.</p>
<h3>Australia no longer has a credible way of calculating how many people have COVID-19</h3>
<p>The use of rapid antigen tests is now the preferred strategy – a move that takes pressure off the PCR public testing sites – but authorities are only just starting to put in place mandatory reporting systems for positive RAT results.</p>

<p>Crises can sometimes help political incumbents if they take command but it is looking increasingly likely that the unexpected surge of the Omicron COVID-19 variant is bad news for Prime Minister Scott Morrison.</p>
<p>With an election due by May, Mr Morrison has a lot of ground to make up.</p>
<p>Until Omicron hit, Mr Morrison was expecting to run at the election with the pandemic receding into the rear-view mirror.</p>
<p>Yet as the Omicron wave interrupted Christmas gatherings, upended summer holiday plans and caused shortages at supermarkets, people’s moods have darkened.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison will argue that he should not be blamed for the upsurge in Omicron which has affected almost every country in the world.</p>
<p>He can argue that he is being blamed for failures of health policy in areas which are mostly the responsibilities of the states and where he has almost no power.</p>
<p>Yet, he must realise that the buck stops with him and voters have some good reasons to be frustrated with his management of the outbreak.</p>
<p>His government failed to plan adequately for the rise in cases after the end of social distancing restrictions by buying adequate supplies of rapid antigen tests (RATs). It has been slow to roll out booster vaccines.</p>
<p>His initial refusal to provide RATs for free makes it look like he did not understand people’s anxiety about the shortage of test kits.</p>
<p>Mr Morrison famously said during the bushfire emergency that he “didn’t hold the hose”.</p>
<p>Voters, however, expect their leaders to take responsibility during a crisis.</p>
<p>The results of the latest poll suggest that Mr Morrison’s management of the pandemic remains one of the key issues on which he will be judged.</p>

<h3><a>Our leaders are talking small, but they still need to think big</a></h3>
<p>Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese have both outlined small targets in the lead-up to the election, but they will need hefty policy interventions to make them a reality.</p>
<h3>Weddings out, divorces in as COVID wreaks chaos on matrimony</h3>
<p>The Christmas and New Year period is a time of disproportionate marriage breakdown for many, which has only been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<h3>May the only outbreak in 2022 be one of common sense</h3>
<p>Avoiding COVID and surviving lockdowns were only some of the challenges we faced this year.</p>
<h3>New strain, old arguments and a familiar sinking feeling</h3>
<p>At every juncture in the COVID crisis, the changing fortunes of Victoria and NSW have brought a fresh outbreak of theorising about what has happened and why.</p>
<h3>You’re the voice: influx of independents puts Liberals on edge</h3>
<p>Liberal incumbents are trying to defuse what they know is a threat as an assortment of power women have announced their independent candidacies in the next federal election.</p>
<h3>Scott Morrison embraces culture wars with religious bill</h3>
<p>Free speech, identity politics and cancel culture all got an airing when the Prime Minister introduced the proposed religious discrimination bill to Parliament.</p>
<h3>Mourning, celebrating the passage of time, my first born graduates</h3>
<p>I cannot rewind the narrative, going back to the moment the obstetrician gifted a moist bundle into my arms, and instantly made me complete.</p>
<h3>Paul Keating, where is the compassion for a country under siege?</h3>
<p>When Tony Abbott makes a rousing speech about solidarity with Taiwan, while a former true believer serves up a deficit of empathy, I must admit the heart breaks a little.</p>
<h3>The ‘yay Australia!’ brigade turn our messy history into a political football</h3>
<p>I’m worried about research indicating many young people aren’t sold on the relative merits of democracy. What I’m not sold on is Education Minister Alan Tudge’s solution.</p>
<h3>‘I don’t think, I know’: Macron breaks through Morrison’s fog of spin</h3>
<p>The French President’s statement is bracing, like someone dunking your head underwater. It got me thinking about how Morrison-speak makes everything so hazy it’s like living in a Godard flick.</p>
<h3>Dave Chappelle’s comedy controversy is a stoush about power</h3>
<p>As a jihad against cultural elites, Netflix special The Closer starts with low-value targets and works its way up.</p>

<p>The year before – 2020 – is one Scott Morrison would want to forget, coming in the aftermath of the fires and the perception he’d abandoned the country in a time of crisis.</p>
<p>The visceral satisfaction most Australians experienced at Novak Djokovic’s deportation from the country on the grounds his presence could fuel anti-vaccination sentiment could well last the distance.</p>
<p>This exhilarating illusion of agency might indeed sustain us for another week. Except; I’m already sensing deflation. Like when that TV series you’ve been bingeing on ends and reality rushes in.</p>
<p>“Feeling refreshed?” people ask this time of year, as they dribble back to the workplace – which, perhaps for the luckier among us, for those of us not working double shifts, might only exist as a screen in the home computer.</p>
<p>Too many of us have missed out on the beach this summer, and on balance, the Djokovic drama is meagre consolation.</p>

<h3><a>Champagne gesture doesn’t mean Cricket Australia has solved its race problem</a></h3>
<p>It was a positive step, but just the bare minimum that needs to be done to make Australian cricket more inclusive.</p>
<h3>Boycotts are an essential and necessary part of public life</h3>
<p>Calls to financially punish artists or organisations who choose to take action in line with their values smacks of desperation.</p>
<h3>Djokovic denied entry because of politics, not public health</h3>
<p>It’s easy to hate the outspoken tennis champion, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s border rules are more about public approval than protecting the population from COVID-19.</p>
<h3>English cricket is having its reckoning over race. When will Australia?</h3>
<p>Australian cricketers have spoken up about racism in the sport, however, unlike the UK there have been no inquiries, reports or Prime Ministerial statements.</p>
<h3>COVID-19 testing crisis a result of failure to invest in public health</h3>
<p>Throughout the entire pandemic Australian governments have relied on border controls, at an international and domestic level, and continue to rely on them, as an alternative to building up local health infrastructure.</p>

<p>There’s a story Usman Khawaja once told about growing up as a Pakistani Muslim in Australia, trying to fit in to the country’s notoriously white and conservative cricket culture.</p>
<p>After experiencing regular racial abuse and taunts during his school years, Khawaja says he was embarrassed to call himself Pakistani. “I had been moulded to believe being from there was uncool,” he said.</p>
<p>He talked about being called a “curry muncher” and being racially sledged by cricket players from opposing teams, as well as their parents.</p>
<p>“I mean, none of them [Australian sporting teams] looked like us. I was brought up to believe if I didn’t drink alcohol growing up I was un-Australian. So then why should I support a country that doesn’t believe in me?”</p>
<p>It was a sentiment that reverberated for many of us who came from migrant backgrounds, and have been told our entire lives that we don’t belong here.</p>
<p>It was this story I immediately thought of after watching Khawaja quickly scramble out of the way when his teammates began spraying champagne over each other to celebrate their victory in The Ashes series against England in Hobart.</p>
<p>Later, he uploaded the footage to Instagram. In the caption he wrote “If this video doesn’t show you that the boys have my back, I don’t know what will.</p>
<p>“Inclusivity in the game and our values as a sport are so important. I feel like we are trending in the right direction.”</p>
<p>Since Khawaja was selected to play test cricket for Australia a decade ago, no other Muslim player has made the squad, and only one other player with South Asian heritage has. It’s a pretty damning statistic.</p>
<p>But for a few seconds Australian cricket looked a little bit like the rest of Australia. And Khawaja used the moment to push things forward just a little more. And that’s worth celebrating (with, or without, champagne).</p>

<div>Hong Kong to kill 2000 animals after hamsters get COVID-19</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Hong Kong: About 2000 small animals, including hamsters, will be killed after several tested positive for the coronavirus at a Hong Kong pet store where an employee was also infected.</p>
<p>According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, animals do not appear to play a significant role in spreading the coronavirus. But Hong Kong authorities said they were not ruling out transmission between animals and humans.</p>
<p>“We cannot exclude the possibility that the shopkeeper was in fact actually infected from the hamsters,” said Edwin Tsui, a controller at the Centre for Health Protection.</p>
<p>“Do not kiss your pets,” he added.</p>
<p>As a precautionary measure, customers who bought hamsters from the store after January 7 would be traced and be subject to mandatory quarantine and must hand over their hamsters to authorities to be put down, officials said.</p>
<p>They said all pet stores in Hong Kong must stop selling hamsters and that about 2000 small mammals, including hamsters and chinchillas, would be killed in a humane manner.</p>
<p>Customers who bought hamsters in Hong Kong from December 22 would be subject to mandatory testing and were urged not contact others until they recorded negatives tests. If their hamsters test positive, they will be subject to quarantine.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has been grappling with a local omicron outbreak traced to several Cathay Pacific crew members who dined at bars and restaurants across the city before testing positive for the Omicron variant.</p>

<p>NSW and Victoria also scrapped the requirement for returning international travellers to spend 14 days in hotel quarantine in November, requiring 72 hours of home quarantine instead, but that isolation rule was lifted in mid-December.</p>
<p>Out of all these short-term visitors, 15,730 went to NSW, followed by 2970 in Victoria, 690 in Western Australia and 650 in Queensland.</p>
<p>ABS director of migration statistics Jenny Dobak said the rules easing to allow fully vaccinated Australian citizens and permanent residents to travel to and from the country without exemptions had a clear impact.</p>
<p>“While the number of border crossings have increased since travel restrictions were eased in November, there are still far fewer crossings than before the COVID-19 pandemic,” Ms Dobak said.</p>
<p>In December 2019, ahead of the pandemic leading to international border closures, there were 1.9 million arrivals and 2.2 million departures.</p>
<p>Just under half of those surveyed who were fully vaccinated wanted to book a flight abroad.</p>
<div>Coastal properties at highest climate risk could fall in value in 18 months</div>
<p>Many city dwellers have made a sea-change during the pandemic, sending property prices in some coastal hotspots soaring.</p>
<p>But coastal properties at the highest risk of climate change impacts could start to fall in value as soon as 18 months from now, an expert has warned.</p>
<p>“At the moment it’s just ‘assess it’, but in the near future they’re going to be asked, ‘What are you doing about this?’” he said.</p>
<p>“And that’s going to make them very hesitant to keep providing mortgages in high-risk areas.</p>
<p>Asked if he thought that could hit property prices, Mallon said, “For sure, absolutely, I think within 18 months.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of people who are still prepared to – they think they’re prepared to put up with these changes in order to get lifestyle, but when these impacts happen they change their mind.”</p>
<p>Although he emphasises that most properties will be fine, specific properties and specific communities will be affected, making now a good time to make long-term plans.</p>
<p>Mallon issues hundreds of reports a week for potential homebuyers who are checking property risk, warning it’s naive for homeowners to think they can sell a property to someone who won’t be doing the same.</p>
<p>A homebuyer will experience 30 years of sea-level rise by the time they pay out their mortgage, and if they sell at any time, the new owner will also be looking 30 years ahead.</p>
<p>“People in coastal areas need to be thinking quite long-term in terms of the future value of their property,” he said.</p>
<p>It’s no hypothetical in Collaroy on Sydney’s northern beaches, where last week large swells washed away sand in front of a sea wall that was designed to protect properties and the beach from storm surges.</p>
<p>Laing + Simmons Narrabeen’s Chris Gamarra has been fielding enquiries from potential buyers about coastal erosion and flood.</p>
<p>“Erosion and flood are hot on buyers’ minds at the moment, understandably,” he said.</p>
<p>“I have just sold a lakefront [home] in Narrabeen – the concerns there for flooding and flood risk was very significant.”</p>
<p>He noted concerns held by some in the community about the sea wall management and predicted an increase in values for properties away from the affected area that are seen to be on a safer part of the beach.</p>
<p>“I think you will see properties change in their price depending on their risk level, which is not something we have had in the past.”</p>
<p>But LJ Hooker Mona Vale’s Kylie Segedin said others in the community expected the sea wall would give them more protection in time, which made them feel safer.</p>
<p>“Last week just after that storm, we had enquiries on that [property] we’ve got for sale on Collaroy Beach. It’s not a concern,” she said.</p>
<p>“There will be people that are concerned about erosion, but they are not the buyers for those properties.”</p>
<p>A recent report estimates a $30 billion investment is needed in coastal protection and adaptation projects over the next 50 years.</p>
<p>A survey of 94 coastal councils in 2020 found 90 per cent rated coastal hazards a priority issue, but identified funding issues as critical to deal with the challenge, the Australian Coastal Councils Association said.</p>
<p>Some coastal areas are already experiencing climate change impacts, especially during storms, said Sarah Boulter, senior research fellow at the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility at Griffith University.</p>
<p>“In some parts of the country, councils are very aware of some of those risks,” she said.</p>
<p>“A diligent owner should be looking and thinking, ‘is there a risk here and how soon will I experience that risk?’”</p>
<p>Although living by the coastline defines the Australian lifestyle, it is going to become more challenging, she said.</p>
<p>This could mean hard engineering solutions such as sea walls in some areas, or sand-dune nourishment and revegetation, or changes in planning rules to avoid developing at-risk areas.</p>
<p>Australia is a wealthy country with very good engineers who will be able to protect important parts of the coast over time, University of Sydney Associate Professor in the School of Geosciences Ana Vila Concejo said.</p>
<p>And in some areas, the houses are not so close to the coastline as to be in immediate danger, although others are at risk and may be best managed through moving the residents into less dangerous areas, she said.</p>
<p>“That will be the only solution in some areas. In other cases, if the Australian government and Australian public think this is worth saving, there can be engineering interventions.”</p>
<p>She warned potential homebuyers to look at the surrounding environment – are there stable cliffs in front of their beach house, or is it near an estuary that could flood?</p>
<p>“If your dream property is just behind the dunes and the elevation is not very much above the high water mark … I would not buy there either.”</p>
<p>Major banks are preparing their home loan books for climate change, and working with their regulator.</p>
<p>A Commonwealth Bank spokesperson said lending assessments include a “range of factors”, adding customers need to understand how their building insurance premiums may change over time.</p>
<p>“We are also enhancing our data and analytics capabilities to better understand the current and future impacts of climate change to our customers and mortgage book,” the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>NAB head of ESG risk management Rosemary Bissett said climate change was a source of significant risk and opportunity.</p>

<div>Dave Chappelle’s comedy controversy is a stoush about power</div>

<div><div><div><h5>Julie Szego</h5>Author and freelance journalist</div><div> <span><time>October 20, 2021 — 5.30am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Not five minutes into Dave Chappelle’s Netflix special, The Closer, he’s insulted child sex abuse survivors and starting on everyone else.</p>
<p>Chappelle, who is black, talks about watching videos of blacks beating up Asian people during the pandemic, while he was quarantining. He likens the beatings to his body’s efforts to beat the virus, implying the coronavirus is Asian.</p>
<p>Is this joke an allegory about Israel’s establishment? About world Jewish domination? Or “anti-Semitic Holocaust inversion”, as one critic claims?</p>
<p>“All right,” he says, after the (anti) Jewish joke, “it’s gonna get worse than that...”</p>
<p>Interestingly, the company’s playing hardball; arguing the substance (albeit not very well), sacking a leaker and suspending, then reinstating, an agitator.</p>
<p>The streaming service has reportedly paid $24.1 million to produce The Closer. But this post-materialist stoush is about power – and who can rightly claim to have less of it. It’s certainly not about whether the guy’s funny.</p>
<p>So, as a jihad against cultural elites, The Closer starts with low-value targets and works its way up.</p>
<p>The Closer is relevant beyond the US for what a commendably dissenting Helen Lewis in The Atlantic describes as Chappelle’s “dare” for people to take unequal offence and “prove his point about a hierarchy of suffering”.</p>
<p>While the debate provokes understandable pain and fear for some trans people, this alone can’t render it illegitimate; women bear their own scars from patriarchal violence.</p>

<p>DHHS announced that a public servant had been referred to the police for leaking a draft of a government document detailing the road map out of restrictions.</p>
<p>In September, the Herald Sun reported the draft, dismissed by premier Daniel Andrews at the time as having “no status”, even though it proved to be remarkably accurate.</p>
<p>The conversation has come at a time when journalists and their audiences are already locked in a tense and at times quite aggressive debate about how the media is covering the most important story in recent history.</p>
<p>But this issue is bigger than one story in the Herald Sun.</p>
<p>Much of our understanding of what went wrong in Victoria’s second wave has come about through the release of information the government wanted to keep secret.</p>
<p>Governments of all stripes, at all levels, are intensely secretive and hostile to the media. What is different this time is that a significant section of the public normally supportive of press freedom has also bought into this approach.</p>
<p>It’s the result of reporting in direct opposition to what the government wants, and it’s only possible through the combination of those inside willing to speak up, and the journalists who work to get the story across the line.</p>
<p>A few days on and the outbreak at the school has grown significantly and is now one the most closely watched stories in the state.</p>
<p>Journalism is one of the least trusted professions in the country. And most of that rests on mistakes made by those of us who practise it.</p>
