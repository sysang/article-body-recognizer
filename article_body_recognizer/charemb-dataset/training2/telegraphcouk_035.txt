<p>Shares in Beyond Meat gained 4pc this afternoon after KFC confirmed it will start selling plant-based chicken.</p>
<p>Yum! Brands, which operates the KFC brand, said Beyond Fried Chicken will be offered for a limited time at restaurants across the US. It will be available as a combo meal or a la carte in six- or 12-piece orders.</p>
<p>The launch marks a new step in the partnership between the two brands. KFC in 2020 tested faux-chicken nuggets from Beyond Meat in about 70 locations in two states after the success of an initial trial. </p>
<p>Beyond Meat and KFC said the plant-based chicken isn’t prepared in a vegan or vegetarian manner. </p>
<h3>Hedge fund king Ken Griffin loses millions on British Airways bet</h3>
<p>One of the world’s wealthiest hedge fund managers has lost millions of pounds after shares in the owner of British Airways took off, writes Oliver Gill.</p>
<p>Ken Griffin, a Chicago-based financier worth more than $21bn (£15.6bn), placed a multimillion-pound bet against IAG just hours before new data revealed the omicron variant had not dented airline bookings.</p>
<p>His firm, Citadel Advisors Europe, opened a 0.93pc short position - a bet of about £70m - against the BA owner on January 3. Another of his funds had already placed a 0.73pc bet against the FTSE 100 group that also owns Iberia and Aer Lingus.</p>
<p>A day later IAG shares jumped more than 11pc. The stock is trading at 160p, valuing the company at almost £8bn.</p>

<h3>US payrolls surge in December</h3>
<p>Sticking with the US, there's new data just out showing private payrolls surged by more than expected in December, suggesting underlying strength in the labour market.</p>
<p>Private payrolls jumped by 807,000 jobs last month, the ADP report showed. Data for November was revised lower to show 505,000 jobs added instead of the initially reported 534,000.</p>
<p>However, economists warned the recent surge in Covid cases could slow momentum in the coming months.</p>
<h3>Wall Street dragged down by tech stocks</h3>
<div> <p>US stocks have had a sluggish open this afternoon, with a further sell-off of tech stocks proving the biggest drag.</p> <p>The Nasdaq shed 0.5pc at the opening bell, while the Dow Jones rose 0.1pc. The benchmark SP500 was flat.</p> </div>
<h3>1 in 15 people in England had Covid before New Year</h3>
<p>New figures from the ONS have revealed a record 3.27m people in England – or one in 15 – had Covid in the week to 31 December.</p>
<p>Infection rates were highest in London, where one in 10 people are estimated to have had the virus.</p>
<p>The ONS said: "There were some early signs in the last few days of 2021 that infections may no longer be increasing in London, but it is currently too early to suggest if this is a continuing change in trend."</p>
<p>Across the UK as a whole, the number of people testing positive totalled 3.74m.</p>
<p>It comes amid warnings from businesses about acute staff shortages as millions of Brits are forced to self-isolate. The Government today scrapped the requirement for asymptomatic people to take a PCR test after testing positive on a lateral flow.</p>
<h3>Oil tops $81 as US stockpiles fall</h3>
<p>Oil prices have climbed after a report pointed to another fall in US stockpiles, even after Opec said it will press ahead with its plans for increasing production.</p>
<p>Brent crude rose 1.4pc to over $81 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate gained a similar amount.</p>
<p>Bloomberg reports that the American Petroleum Institute reported US stockpiles fell by 6.4m barrels last week. It would be a sixth week of declines if confirmed by official government figures due today.</p>
<p>Opec+ on Tuesday stuck to its plan to add 400,000 barrels a day next month after it cut estimates for a surplus in the first quarter. </p>
<h3>Food prices rise at fastest pace since pandemic began</h3>
<p>Supermarket prices are rising at their fastest rate since the pandemic struck in a further blow for cash-strapped shoppers, writes Laura Onita.</p>
<p>Food prices jumped by 3.5pc last month compared with a year earlier, adding £15 onto the bill of the average shopper, according to data experts Kantar. </p>
<p>It is the highest rate recorded by Kantar since the onset of the pandemic when householders were panic-buying essentials, forcing supermarkets to impose limits on certain items.</p>
<p>Prices climbed the fastest in categories such as fresh beef, savoury snacks and skincare, but fell in fresh bacon, bath and shower products and spirits. </p>
<h3>PCR test requirement dropped after positive lateral flow</h3>
<p>The Government has confirmed that the requirement to get a PCR test after testing positive on a lateral flow will be dropped.</p>
<p>The UK Health Security Agency said it changes will come into effect for asymptomatic people from 11 January in England.</p>
<p>However, people with Covid symptoms should still get PCR tests.</p>
<p>The Government is also expected to drop the requirement for pre-departure tests for passengers arriving in the UK following calls from industry groups.</p>
<h3>Facebook launches bid to appeal Giphy ruling</h3>
<p>Facebook owner Meta has applied to appeal a competition watchdog ruling that it must unwind its $400m (£295m) takeover of Giphy.</p>
<p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in November it had found that the deal would reduce competition between social media platforms and in digital advertising.</p>
<p>The regulator ordered Facebook to sell Giphy – marking the first time it's blocked a major tech deal.</p>
<p>The Competition Appeal Tribunal said Meta had lodged an application for review on December 23, challenging the ruling on six grounds.</p>
<h3>Sony to develop electric cars and unveils Vision-S 02 01 CES</h3>
<p>Sony is gearing up to join the electric car race, with the Japanese electronics giant setting up a dedicated division despite never making a vehicle, writes James Titcomb.</p>
<p>Kenichiro Yoshida, chief executive, said the company would launch Sony Mobility in the spring and “explore entry” into the industry.</p>
<p>Speaking at the CES technology show in Las Vegas, he also showed off a new prototype SUV in addition to an existing model it has been testing for just over a year.</p>
<p>Sony, best known for its PlayStation games consoles, cameras, movie studio and record label, has little heritage in making cars.</p>
<p>However, it has a lucrative business in image sensors that are likely to become increasingly important for safety features and ultimately self-driving technology, as well as making autonomous robots and drones.</p>

<h3>Tankers turn around as more gas heads to Europe</h3>
<p>Gas traders are diverting their ships towards Europe as they look to capitalise on soaring prices across the continent before the crisis subsides.</p>
<p>Many sellers are paying for expensive detours – including one ship that was sent back through the Panama Canal, doubling its charges. But the huge spike in European prices means they can still earn more than in Asia.</p>
<p>In just one example of this trend, West African cargo onboard Maran Gas Sparta, a vessel chartered by Shell, has been called back to Europe after it was on the cusp of passing the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<h3>US futures dragged down by tech stocks</h3>
<p>US futures are trading marginally lower, with a sell-off in tech stocks suggesting there may be more pain for Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Futures tracking the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 0.4pc, while the SP 500 and Dow Jones were little changed.</p>
<p>Markets got another reminder of the continuing threat to global growth from the pandemic as Hong Kong reimposed social curbs and halted flights from eight countries.</p>
<h3>Ministers set April deadline to solve energy crisis</h3>
<p>The Government is giving itself until April to find a solution to soaring gas prices as consumers brace for a new price cap on utility bills.</p>
<p>Regulator Ofgem is set to announce a new price cap on 7 February, but ministers believe they have a couple more months to gauge whether assistance is needed to help mitigate the impact, Bloomberg reports.</p>
<p>Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng will meet with energy bosses today. Measures under discussion include an industry proposal for loans to help suppliers delay some of the April increases, as well as cuts to VAT charged on utility bills.</p>
<h3>PCR test delays force pub and restaurant workers to isolate for almost two weeks</h3>
<p>Pub and restaurant staff are being forced to isolate for almost two weeks because of delays in Covid PCR tests, industry leaders have warned ahead of an expected relaxation of the rules.</p>
<p>Hannah Boland has more:</p>
<p>Anyone who does not have Covid symptoms but gets a positive lateral flow result, accounting for about 40pc of cases, must then get a confirmatory PCR test.</p>
<p>They must isolate for 10 days after the PCR, but delays in the testing system means that it can take as many as four days to get a slot - effectively condemning people to as many as 14 days indoors.</p>
<p>Hospitality companies have reported coming under huge strain, battling worker absences over the festive period amid confusion among the public over when they need to start their isolation periods and lengthy delays to results.</p>
<p>Mr Watson said the current rules meant staff "can be off on average 12 to 13 days".</p>

<h3>Piracy streaming app Popcorn Time shuts down</h3>
<p>It was once the bane of Netflix's existence, but for Popcorn Time the credits have finally rolled.</p>
<p>Founded in 2014, the app made watching pirated films and TV shows almost as easy as using a legitimate streaming service and quickly became a hit.</p>
<p>The following year Netflix warned investors about the rise of the platform, with boss Reed Hastings stating that “piracy continues to be one of our biggest competitors”.</p>
<p>While Popcorn Time's creators deserted the service shortly after its launch, the app's code was open-source, meaning others could pick up the mantle.</p>
<h3>InterContinental rises after UBS upgrade</h3>
<p>InterContinental Hotels is one of the biggest risers this morning, gaining 3pc to push towards the top of the FTSE 100.</p>
<p>It comes after UBS raised its recommendation from neutral to buy, with analysts Bilal Aziz saying the stock was seen as the strongest industry play in an inflationary environment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Redburn raised its recommendation to neutral from sell.</p>
<h3>Boeing wins £460m UK army contract</h3>
<p>Boeing Defence has secured a £460m contract to provide logistics services to the UK armed forces worldwide.</p>
<p>The five-year contract covers services including inventory, transport, engineering and general ledger management, ensuring the UK can successfully deploy military personnel and equipment globally.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defence said the deal will support 675 jobs across the UK supply chain, including 300 at Boeing's sites in Milton Keynes and Bristol.</p>
<p>It added that the contract was expected to deliver £54m in efficiency savings.</p>
<h3>Stanlow refinery records best fuel sales in 18 months</h3>
<p>The company behind the Stanlow oil refinery has posted its strongest fuel sales in 18 months as it emerges from a pandemic crisis that left it on the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>Essar Oil said its December sales were the strongest in a year and a half across both fuels and petrochemicals, with demand now back to 95pc of pre-Covid levels.</p>
<p>Stanlow, which supplies around one sixth of the UK's road transport fuels, was plunged into crisis during the pandemic as fuel demand slumped and a funding shortfall left it struggling to repay deferred taxes.</p>
<p>Essar said it had secured new funding arrangements worth $1.1bn (£800m) last year and said around 80pc of VAT deferred payments have now been made in line with a schedule agreed with HMRC.</p>
<p>Deepak Maheshwari, chief executive of Essar, said:</p>
<p>Over the last quarter, the company has been able to strengthen its financial performance due to improvements in the product market and delivery of reliable and stable operations at Stanlow.</p>
<h3>Together Energy latest supplier to face collapse</h3>
<p>A local authority-backed energy supplier with 170,000 customers is reportedly facing collapse within weeks after failing to secure new funding.</p>
<p>Together Energy, which is 50pc owned by Warrington Borough Council, is likely to run out of money this month without an emergency cash injection, Sky News reports.</p>
<p>Professional services firm Alvarez Marsal has carried out a hunt for new funding, but the prospect of a deal is now said to be remote.</p>
<p>Together Energy could be the latest victim of a protracted energy crisis that has claimed more than two dozen victims in recent months. If it does go bust, it will be the 26th firm to cease trading since August.</p>
<h3>FTSE 100 turns positive as oil stocks gain</h3>
<p>The FTSE 100 has reversed its early losses to push up 0.3pc, driven largely by gains for oil majors.</p>
<p>BP and Shell pushed 1.4pc and 1pc higher respectively, extending gains from yesterday after production cartel Opec said it would maintain its output increases.</p>
<p>The blue-chip index had started the day on the back foot as a new year rally driven by travel stocks ran out of steam.</p>
<p>But focus will be back on the airlines and hotel groups today amid reports the Government will scrap the pre-departure test requirement for vaccinated travellers entering the UK.</p>
<p>Following a sluggish start, the mid-cap FTSE 250 is now up 0.1pc, with Cineworld leading the risers.</p>
<h3>Pre-departure tests 'to be scrapped' for UK return</h3>
<p>Pre-departure testing will no longer be required for passengers returning to the UK, the Government is expected to announce later today.</p>
<p>Sky News reports that the review of travel restrictions will scrap the restrictions put in place a month ago to tackle the spread of the omicron variant.</p>
<p>It comes after trade body Airlines UK and Manchester Airlines Group called for the removal of all testing rules, saying they had little impact on the spread of omicron and were wreaking financial havoc across the industry.</p>
<p>Under current rules, fully vaccinated travellers must take a pre-departure test before heading to the UK and self-isolate until they receive a negative result from a post-arrival test.</p>
<p>People who are not fully vaccinated must self-isolate for 10 days after they arrive.</p>
<h3>Watchdog swoops on Capita's £62m software deal</h3>
<p>The competition watchdog has served an initial enforcement order over Capita's planned £62m sale of its emergence services business to NEC Software Solutions.</p>
<p>The order prevents NEC from fully combining the business while the regulator considers the deal.</p>
<p>Capita inked the deal to offload its Secure Solutions and Services division, which provides managed services to the emergency services and justice sectors, in October in an effort to bolster its balance sheet.</p>
<p>Shares in Capita fell 2pc.</p>
<h3>Gas prices keep climbing as Russia cuts supplies</h3>
<p>Gas prices are on the rise once again, extending gains for a third consecutive day as shipments from Russia remain limited.</p>
<p>Benchmark European prices rose as much as 9.1pc after rallying more than 10pc on both Monday and Tuesday. The UK equivalent gained as much as 9.8pc.</p>
<p>Prices are bouncing back after a sharp drop at the end of the year as pipeline volumes of Russian gas to Europe languish at their lowest level in at least seven years.</p>
<p>Russian supplies via Ukraine remain subdued, while the Yamal-Europe pipeline is still flowing in reverse from Germany to Poland.</p>
<p>The squeeze on supplies comes just as temperatures start to fall again across Europe, while tensions on the Russia-Ukraine border remain high.</p>
<h3>Playtech delays vote on £2.1bn Aristocrat offer</h3>
<p>Playtech has said it's delaying a shareholder vote on a £2.1bn takeover offer from Australian gambling giant Aristocrat as talks progress over a rival bid from JKO Play.</p>
<p>The London-listed software company, which was founded by billionaire Teddy Sagi, said the meeting previously scheduled for 12 January will be pushed back to 2 February.</p>
<p>Meanwhile JKO, which is led by former Formula 1 owner Eddie Jordan and former Ladbrokes executive Keith O’Loughlin, has asked for more time to develop the terms of its potential offer.</p>
<p>Playtech's directors continue to recommend unanimously that shareholders vote in favour of the Aristocrat offer, but a rival approach from JKO could derail this bid.</p>
<p>In a separate statement Aristocrat said the regulatory approval process for its offer remained on track, adding it was committed to competing the acquisition "as quickly as possible".</p>
<h3>Eurozone growth slows to nine-month low</h3>
<p>Economic growth in the eurozone slowed to a nine-month low in December amid a resurgence in Covid cases.</p>
<p>The IHS Markit PMI index for the region fell to 53.3m last month, down from 55.4m in November, representing the slowest expansion since March.</p>
<p>The rapid spread of the omicron variant took a particular toll on the service sector, restricting increases in both activity and new business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, manufacturing output growth remained subdued as supply-related disruptions continued to impede production schedules.</p>
<p>Joe Hayes, senior economist at IHS Markit said:</p>
<p>The accelerated expansion in output we saw in November unfortunately turned out to be brief. Amid a resurgence of Covid-19 infections across the euro area, growth slowed to the weakest since March in December.</p>
<p>In Germany, where measures to combat Covid-19 have been more stringent than other monitored euro area countries, levels of economic activity broadly stagnated in December. Nonetheless, slower growth was seen across the board.</p>
<h3>Ryanair passenger numbers drop amid omicron travel curbs</h3>
<p>Ryanair has reported a fall in passenger numbers between November and December as fresh restrictions prompted by the omicron variant dented travel.</p>
<p>The budget airline said numbers fell 7pc to 9.5m last month – the lowest level since July. It ran 62,200 flights in December, with load factor slipping to 81pc from 86pc the previous month.</p>
<p>The airline now expects a full-year net loss of between €250m (£209m) and €450m, compared to a previous range of between €100m to €200m.</p>
<h3>Tesco wins supermarket battle in key Christmas trading period</h3>
<p>Tesco has grown its market share to the highest level since January 2018 as it outperformed rivals in the key Christmas trading period.</p>
<p>Tesco's grocery sales slipped 0.9pc over the 12 weeks to December 26 compared to last year's lockdown boom, according to the latest data from Kantar. However, they're up 10.1pc on a two-year basis.</p>
<p>Its grocery market share rose 0.6pc to 27.9pc – its highest level in four years.</p>
<p>Rivals Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons saw their sales fall by 4.4pc, 3.9pc and 6.5pc respectively compared to last year.</p>
<p>Total UK grocery sales stood at £31.7bn over the 12 week period, down 3pc on last year but up 8pc versus 2019.</p>
<p>Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar, said: "The data suggests that while there weren’t formal rules in place across the UK this year, many people celebrated at home again due to omicron."</p>
<h3>FTSE risers and fallers</h3>
<p>The FTSE has slipped this morning after hitting 22-month highs on Tuesday as the new year rally runs out of steam.</p>
<p>Life insurance and banking stocks are the biggest drag on the index, with HSBC and Prudential down 0.6pc and 0.8pc respectively. National Grid is leading the laggards with a fall of 1.1pc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ocado is the biggest riser, gaining 3.8pc following an upgrade by analysts at Berenberg. London Stock Exchange Group has also added 2.5pc after an upgrade from Citigroup.</p>
<p>The domestically-focused FTSE 250 is trading flat.</p>
<h3>Mazars fined £250,000 over audit failures</h3>
<p>Mazars has been slapped with a £250,000 fine over failures in its audit of a local government authority's 2019 accounts.</p>
<p>The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) said Mazars' work "fell far short of the applicable standards and regulations and had the potential to undermine confidence in the standards in general of registered auditors".</p>
<p>The accounting watchdog proposed a penalty of £314,000, but this was reduced by 20pc after Mazars co-operated with the investigation and made certain admissions in the case.</p>
<p>The FRC said the auditor has also made written undertakings to improve the quality of its work.</p>
<h3>China's Huarong slumps after $6.6bn bailout</h3>
<p>Shares in troubled Chinese asset manager Huarong plummeted as trading resumed following a state-backed bailout of almost $6.6bn (£4.9bn).</p>
<p>The company's Hong Kong listed shares had been suspended for nine months after it delayed its 2020 annual results, spooking markets.</p>
<p>When Huarong eventually published its figures in August, it revealed a record $16bn loss. Former chairman Lai Xiaomin was executed last year after being found guilty of corruption.</p>
<p>Shares slumped more than 50pc after they resumed trading today.</p>
<h3>Poundland chief Andy Bond steps down</h3>
<p>The chief executive of Poundland’s parent company has said he’s stepping down later this year due to health issues.</p>
<p>Andy Bond, the former boss of Asda, said he will leave Pepco at the end of March and remain an adviser to the board until the end of the year.</p>
<p>Mr Bond will be replaced by chief operating officer Trevor Masters, a former executive at Tesco.</p>
<h3>FTSE 100 slips at the open</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Following Tuesday's new year rally, the FTSE 100 has started the day marginally on the back foot.</p> <p>The blue-chip index has edged a fraction into the red at 7,503 points.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Hong Kong bans indoor dining after 6pm</h3>
<p>Hong Kong is rolling out fresh restrictions for the first time in almost a year amid fears the city is on the brink of a major winter Covid outbreak.</p>
<p>Indoor dining will be banned after 6pm while some venues will be closed completely, according to local media reports.</p>
<p>There will also be a return to social distancing rules that were in place a year ago and eased after Chinese New Year 2021, while flights from eight countries – including the UK and US – will be banned from 8 January.</p>
<p>It comes after the financial hub this week reported the first local Covid case that officials were unable to trace to its source.</p>
<p>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the increase in cases in the city was drastic and was putting a strain on public hospitals.</p>
<h3>Travel firms call for Covid testing to be scrapped</h3>
<p>Travel groups have called for all remaining Covid testing for passengers to be scrapped to help ease the financial pressure on the industry.</p>
<p>Trade body Airlines UK said current measures had dented demand and hurt consumer confidence, warning that extending the rules any longer would be financially disastrous.</p>
<p>Manchester Airport Group added that its research had showed pre-departure testing had little or no impact on the spread of the omicron variant.</p>
<p>Boss Tim Hawkins told BBC Radio 4: "We are beyond the point where international travel restrictions can play a role in managing that peak and if there is no benefit to it then we shouldn't be doing it and we should take those measures out."</p>
<p>Ministers are thought to be discussing changes to Covid testing rules for both travel and domestic use as the country battles widespread staff and test shortages.</p>
<p>The Telegraph revealed the requirement for follow-up PCR tests will be removed in an effort to shorten isolation periods.</p>
<h3>Goldman says Bitcoin $100,000 a 'possibility'</h3>
<p>Wall Street has been notoriously sceptical of cryptocurrencies, but there's some bullish forecasting from Goldman Sachs on the prospects for Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The bank said the $100,000 price milestone often touted by advocates of the digital coin is very much a possibility as it continues to win market share from gold.</p>
<p>Goldman said that while Bitcoin's consumption of natural resources may be a barrier to institutional adoption, this wouldn't hurt demand for the asset.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is currently trading at around $46,000, having hit a new high of $69,000 last year.</p>

<header> <h1> Amazon is no grocery threat, says Ocado boss </h1> <p> Ocado's average order size was £147 and Marks Spencer food accounts for a quarter of all orders after it replaced Waitrose </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Laura Onita <time> 18 March 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The boss of Ocado has dismissed the threat of losing ground to Amazon, calling it a “very small competitor”. </p>
<p>The remarks came after <a>Amazon opened its second till-free supermarket in London this week</a> and launched its own-label range of hundreds of products.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t mean it’s not clever tech, but it won’t have a big impact on the [grocery] market,” said Mr Steiner, adding that the home delivery offering was almost at an “unnoticeable level” online. </p>
<p><a>Ocado sales</a> jumped almost 40pc to £599m in the 13 weeks to February 28 following strong demand over Christmas and the third national lockdown. Weekly orders rose by 2.5pc to 329,000 during the quarter. </p>
<p>The company is seeking to open at least 12 new micro sites, mostly in London, for its one-hour Ocado Zoom delivery service. </p>
<p>Finance chief Niall McBride said the company wanted to take the model to other cities. The first Ocado Zoom opened in Acton in 2019.</p>
<p>Locations could be hard to find in the capital for smaller warehouses, but he hoped to have about six new sites opened within two years.</p>
<p>Ocado expected sales growth to slow down during the coming months compared with last March, when Britons stockpiled cupboard essentials, as lockdown restrictions ease. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr Steiner again said that the permanent shift to online grocery shopping was here to stay and Ocado is well-placed to benefit from it. </p>
<p>Figures from Nielsen showed that buying groceries online accounted for 16pc of the total market in January, up from 8pc year-on-year. </p>
<p>Ocado Retail, which is half-owned by Marks Spencer, has been growing faster than mainstream rivals during the pandemic, but it still only has a 1.7pc market share, according to Kantar. </p>
<p>It has struggled to cope with the boom in internet orders during the pandemic as its robotic warehouses, where groceries are picked and packed, cannot be built overnight, leaving it relatively inflexible. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, traditional rivals such as Tesco and Sainsbury’s managed to double their capacity by hiring more workers.</p>
<p>Weekly orders increased by 2.5pc to 329,000 at Ocado during the quarter. Tesco has reached 1.5m per week. </p>
<p>Ocado plans to open two more robotic warehouses this year as it tries to ship orders to a growing customer list. </p>
<header> <h1> Just Eat joins fast grocery race with Asda deal </h1> <p> Just Eat Takeaway plays catch-up with rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats in deal with fourth-largest supermarket </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matthew Field <time> 17 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Just Eat Takeaway has unveiled a tie-up with Asda to launch grocery deliveries across the UK as it plays catch up to rivals Deliveroo and Uber Eats.</p>
<p>In a u-turn for chief executive Jitse Groen, the Anglo-Dutch takeaway delivery company has plunged into the war for rapid grocery delivery, having previously sat out as rivals sought deals with Britain’s biggest supermarkets.</p>
<p>Its initial launch will include deliveries couriered by electric bikes from five Asda stores featuring 1,000 items starting in January, with plans to expand throughout the year.</p>
<p>Andrew Kenny, managing director of Just Eat UK, said: “Our tie up with Asda means we can help people access everything from store cupboard essentials to fresh groceries in a matter of minutes.”</p>
<p>Asda, which was acquired by the billionaire Issa brothers in a debt-fuelled £6.8bn deal in February this year, has been exploring its own fast delivery options. </p>
<p>It signed a deal with Uber Eats for 30-minute deliveries last year, which has expanded to 300 stores. It also offers bigger basket deliveries in one hour from 96 stores. </p>
<p>The Issa brothers chose to cash in on Asda’s own home delivery network, which includes 2,000 delivery vans, selling its logistics business and warehouses in a £1.7bn sale and lease-back deal.</p>
<p>Just Eat’s decision to expand into grocery logistics comes despite repeated doubts from chief executive Mr Groen over the viability of rival services.</p>
<p>The company launched grocery delivery in Germany in May, but Mr Groen has questioned whether food delivery logistics can make money. Its Germany business said its operation would be “profit neutral”.</p>
<p>The company was previously a constituent of the FTSE 100 but dropped off the register due to its dual listing in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>In the UK, Deliveroo has said grocery makes up around 10pc of its total sales. It has delivery deals with Co-op, Aldi, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Waitrose.</p>
<p>The London market has also been swamped by ultra-fast grocery delivery companies promising steep discounts for new customers. These start-ups, such as Gorillas and Zapp, promise food to customers’ doors in as little as ten minutes. </p>
<p>They cut largely out supermarket partners, instead utilising “dark stores”, delivery only shops that are not open to the public.</p>
<h1> Aldi and Lidl in pole position after Tesco's growth grinds to a halt </h1>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Ben Marlow <div>Chief City Commentator</div> <time> 18 June 2021 • 7:23pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Tesco boss Ken Murphy is putting on a brave face but the supermarket pandemic boom is clearly over, paving the way for Aldi and Lidl to seize the advantage once again.</p>
<a>online orders rocketed</a> after years of struggling to make the economics stack up.
<p>But stockpiling is now a distant memory and growth at Tesco has practically ground to a halt as the high street reopened and pubs and restaurants flung open their doors again.</p>
<p>That mirrors a slowdown across the retail industry more broadly, with retail sales down 1.4pc from April to May as restrictions eased and people flocked back to restaurants and bars.</p>
<p>The reopening of hospitality was felt most keenly among the grocers, with the largest decline coming from food stores where sales volumes fell by 5.7pc, according to the Office for National Statistics.</p>
<p>Most worryingly for Murphy and his counterparts at the other major chains, online sales dropped 4pc as the general public returned to old-fashioned bricks and mortar shops.</p>
<p>A shortage of delivery drivers certainly won’t help. Murphy says Tesco can’t even get the staff required to fulfil current demand, leading to vast quantities of food being wasted.</p>
<p>The stage is set for Aldi and Lidl to <a>pick up where they left off</a>, regaining the upper hand and forcing the established order onto the back foot again. The backdrop is almost perfect for the German discounters.</p>
<p>The lifting of lockdown restrictions are a serious headache for Tesco and rivals, while the end of furlough and a corresponding rise in unemployment, together with rising prices, is a gift to those at the bottom end.</p>
<p>Tesco, like others, will dabble with new ventures in a bid to uncover fresh growth. It is trialling cashierless stores and a one-hour delivery service called Whoosh, but it’s hard to see either really taking off.</p>
<p>Indeed, senior retail figures quietly concede that the pair could feasibly double their slice again over the next decade. The lockdown gravy train will soon seem like a distant memory.</p>
<h4>Deloitte waves the white flag on working from home </h4>
<p>Employers are losing their bottle - and possibly their minds too when it comes to working from home.</p>
<a>when a white-collar giant like Deloitte performs a total climbdown on working from home</a>, it's a different kettle of fish altogether.
<p>The accountancy giant has told its 20,000 UK staff they can work wherever they want when Covid restrictions are lifted. </p>
<p>Boss Richard Houston says the firm want to “keep the flexibility of remote working, without losing the connections and opportunities for collaboration that we need to make a difference for our clients, our people and for society”.</p>
<p>What twaddle. How can any organisation possibly expect to foster a culture of collaboration or “connect” with clients if its entire workforce is communicating from behind a screen? </p>
<p>As for making a difference to society, if Deloitte really wanted to do that, it would ensure that staff continue to come into the office and support the hundreds of businesses nearby that rely on City workers for the bulk of their trade. </p>
<p>And what’s to stop them spending the rest of their careers on the beach? Still, there’s one obvious upside: all those grey-faced consultants with a tan.</p>
<header> <h1> Marks Spencer battles to prove it’s still a great British institution </h1> <p> For the first time in many moons, the high street stalwart is arguably on the right track to get its spark back </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Laura Onita and Matt Oliver <time> 11 November 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Norman replied: “Our project is about turning a great institution into a great business.” </p>
<p>The former ITV chairman was aware, he said, of “doubters and cynics along the way” who have questioned MS’s most recent <a>reinvention plans</a>, following several failed attempts over the years. </p>
<p>“Probably I would have been one [doubter] too,” admitted Norman. “I hope you will see from these results that we are very serious about the reshaping of the business.” </p>
<p>The 137-year-old British retailer expects to make profits of £500m this year after <a>sinking to its first annual loss in 94 years in 2020</a>. </p>
<p>Behind it all is chief executive Steve Rowe, appointed in April 2016, who has been spearheading a turnaround since 2017. </p>
<p>“Those that have observed MS for a while may ask straightaway if this is another false dawn,” says Jonathan Pritchard, a retail analyst at Peel Hunt. </p>
<p>“We do not think so. The strategic progress is noteworthy, with fewer lines and greater depth in clothing, and much-improved value for money offer in food, and more customers via Ocado.” </p>
<p>MS’ latest resurrection of its clothing and home business - historically a drag on the better-performing food arm, as with John Lewis and Waitrose - appears to have actually worked. </p>
<p>So what has changed? Nailing the basics, selling more third party brands online and in-stores, and focusing on key areas such as activewear and kids clothing.</p>
<a>revive its womenswear department</a>. These products would always be affordable, and always in stock, a strategy known in the industry as “NOOS”: never out of stock/never on sale.
<p>Shoppers can expect at least 30pc of these products to be in stock, which includes skinny jeans and cashmere-like Cashmilon jumpers - 1.5m of which are sold each year. </p>
<p>A shrunken inventory due to <a>supply chain woes</a>, especially in womenswear, has resulted in orders being placed closer to the date of sales and speeding up the supply chain.</p>
<p>Next has implemented a similar strategy, now selling hundreds of third-party brands online which account for a chunky slice of sales. The chain is the only British brand that sells more clothes online than MS. </p>
<p>Customers also bought more of their clothing staples online, with sales of lingerie and essentials up 97pc compared to two years ago.</p>
<p>Now, the retailer plans to open 20 new stores in the next three financial years, including six former Debenhams sites. </p>
<p>Just as its clothing sector comes into its own, so has its food division.</p>
<p>While the residual effects of the pandemic still cloud the extent of improvements, having inflated grocery sales, MS noted a string of long-term measures that have boosted its food arm.</p>
<p>The average basket size on everyday shopping trips remains almost a third higher than before the pre-pandemic levels, even as restrictions eased and Britons returned to restaurants. </p>
<p>It has reduced choice in core product categories including pasta, ready meals, bakery and wine, and started selling more frozen food. </p>
<p>It has also ditched promotions on food and started offering cheaper everyday items via its "Remarksable" range, mirroring similar behaviour at larger rivals Sainsbury’s and Tesco as cost-conscious shoppers increasingly hunt for bargains. </p>
<p>A 500g pack of 12pc fat British beef mince costs £2.60, while its Select Farm equivalent is £4.50; its 800g soft white farmhouse bread loaf is £1.25, compared with its super-soft bread loaf at 65p.</p>
<p>Going forward, the company plans to favour neighbourhood sites and retail parks, with good access and parking.</p>
<p>“We’re moving out of town centres into brand new premises that are the right size in a modern environment,” Rowe said. “The future of our estate is omni-channel.” </p>
<p>MS has argued that “on-the-move” food sales had improved since the return of schools and office workers this autumn, with sales in city centres and travel stores rising as a result.</p>
<p>Rowe says online orders are profitable and he is “very pleased with the growth opportunities Ocado has presented”.</p>
<p>Concerns in the City that MS had overpaid for its 50pc stake in Ocado Retail in 2019, at £750m, have been proved wrong by early results.</p>
<p>Mr Rowe added that the revamp of its food halls, simplifying the way shops are stocked, means more money is made and there is less waste per site. </p>
<p>“The food business remains the standout performer,” says Steve Dresser, director at Grocery Insight. </p>
<p>It seems Rowe’s patience has succeeded in pulling off not just a transformation, but an MS transformation.</p>
<p>As the 54-year-old put it: “We feel we’re past an inflection point, we’ve moved into the next phase of the transformation, shaping the MS of the future.” </p>

<p>That’s what tends to happen when takeover battles are decided in this manner.</p>
<p>Woe betide those who deprive a weary nation of their festive turkeys, crackers and trees after last year’s celebrations were cancelled by an indecisive Prime Minister flapping in the wind.</p>
<a>energy costs spiral</a>, benefits are cut, and tax rises bite.
<p>With supermarkets facing their own spiralling costs, food prices are likely to go up too – by as much as 5pc Tesco chairman John Allan has warned – piling further pressure on household incomes. </p>
<p>In the face of such massive uncertainty, the sensible decision would be for the bidders to walk away but having come this far there seems little chance of that now.</p>
<p>That leaves matters in the hands of the Morrisons board. If those at the top weren’t already having second thoughts about abandoning the chain to a future of heavy debt repayments, cost cuts and asset-stripping, they should be now.</p>

<p>Households would be forced to spend almost £700 a year more on their food bills if supermarket supply chains were broken up, new figures suggest, after a Tory MP declared war on the grocers. </p>
<p>Analysis of Kantar figures by The Telegraph suggests a shift away from supermarkets would have drastic consequences for consumers, who typically pay a premium for staple products when they shop at smaller stores. </p>
<p>It comes after Chris Loder, MP for West Dorset, told a Tory conference fringe event that it was in the “mid and long-term interest” of the country to “break” the strained networks through which supermarkets get food. </p>
<p>He argued this would lead to a return to farmers selling their products at local shops. But analysis shows that small shops charge much more for staples than big chains. </p>
<p>The premium is especially wide on products such as flour, which costs nearly twice as much on average at independent shops. </p>
<p>A typical British household would pay about £40 a year more for eggs, butter and milk by not shopping at supermarkets at all.</p>
<p>If the same average increase is applied across all product categories, the annual cost would be £688, equivalent to nearly 11 extra weekly grocery shops per household. </p>
<p>The comments from Mr Loder, who is from a farming family, come amid a supply chain crisis created by lorry driver shortages that has left empty shelves in some shops. </p>
<p>Peter Levell, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said a collapse of supply chains risked creating a worse outcome for consumers: “Supermarkets have outcompeted smaller stores as their scale allows them to offer lower prices.”</p>
<header> <h1> Inflation surge pushes cost of Christmas dinner up to £27.48 </h1> <p> Kantar finds a festive meal for four including turkey, sparkling wine and Christmas pudding costs 3.4pc more than it did last year </p> </header>

<p>The price of a Christmas dinner has risen by more than 3pc as food inflation hits its highest level this year, pushing up the cost of turkey and brussels sprouts.</p>
<p>A festive meal for four now costs an average of £27.48, up 3.4pc on last year or about £1, according to data experts Kantar.</p>
<p>The biggest price rise was for a small frozen turkey, which now costs £12.46, 7pc higher than a year ago. The prices of Christmas pudding, cauliflower and sprouts have increased 5pc each, while gravy granules are 3pc more expensive. </p>
<p>However, the price of a bottle of sparkling wine has stayed flat at £6.47, while cranberry sauce, parsnips, carrots and potatoes have gotten cheaper.</p>
<p>The rise comes amid wider grocery inflation of 3.2pc in November compared with the same month last year when it was 1.3pc - the sharpest rise since June 2020 and the biggest increase this year.</p>
<p>For a premium Christmas dinner for four, households can expect to fork out £33.05 this year, compared with £31.45 in 2020. </p>
<p>This is made up of the original items, but also includes pigs in blankets, which cost £4.83, up 12pc year-on-year, and chilled gravy rather than granules, which is 13pc more expensive at £2.10. </p>
<p>Kantar said that inflated prices are yet to have an impact on the way households shop, with Britons continuing to splash out on supermarkets’ premium own-label ranges.</p>
<p>Ranges such as Tesco Finest and Asda Extra Special are currently the fastest growing in stores, Kantar said, with sales of premium own-labels expected to outstrip December 2020’s total of £587m. </p>
<p>Fraser McKevitt, head of retail at Kantar, said: “It’s clear that shoppers want to have some fun and make this Christmas extra special. Price inflation doesn’t seem to be denting their desire to treat themselves and loved ones.</p>
<p>“Habits we’d expect to see shift, like swapping<a> branded products for own-label or seeking out promotions, haven’t altered just yet</a>.” </p>
<p><a>Recent concerns over the omicron variant of coronavirus may also affect the way consumers shop</a> in the next few weeks, including a marked return to online shopping. </p>
<p>Overall, grocery sales fell by 3.8pc in the 12 weeks to Nov 28 compared with the same period last year when they were boosted by England’s second lockdown, forcing people to cook at home more. Online grocery sales slumped 12.5pc.</p>
<p>Tesco’s sales fell by 1.4pc during the period, but posted its biggest increase in market share since 2007 to hit 27.7pc in its best performance since February 2019.</p>
<p>Lidl and Aldi also increased their market share, but sales fell by 1.1pc. </p>
<p>Lidl now has a record market share of 6.4pc, while Aldi added 0.2 percentage points to move to 7.9pc.</p>
<p>Sainsbury's slice of the grocery pie dipped from 15.7pc to 15.4pc following a 5.3pc decline in sales, while Asda fell 0.1 percentage points to 14pc after a 5pc slide in sales.</p>
<p>Morrisons was the worst performer among the four biggest supermarkets, down 7.1pc, with a drop in market share to 10pc from 10.3pc.</p>
