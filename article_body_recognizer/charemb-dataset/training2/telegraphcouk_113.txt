<h1> The Ipcress File: how a bespectacled ‘anti-Bond’ changed Michael Caine’s life </h1>

<a> Zulu</a> (1964), the £4,000 salary wasn’t likely to keep him in filet mignon for long – certainly not compared with his friend
<a>Sean Connery</a>, who’d just earned an enviable £500,000 for the third James Bond film, Goldfinger.
<p>The Ipcress File (1965) airs on BBC Two on Sunday at 2.05pm. The new mini-series begins on ITV in the New Year </p>
<header> <h1> Black Hawk Down under fire: how Ridley Scott won the Battle of Mogadishu </h1> <p> To critics, it was a Zulu-like whitewashing of history. But for many US servicemen, it remains a painfully true depiction of modern warfare </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tom Fordy <time> 30 December 2021 • 2:41pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>In the film, Atto travels in a three-car convoy, which is swiftly surrounded by US helicopters and duly halted with a single warning shot. According to Atto, he travelled with just one vehicle, which was fired upon heavily. </p>
<p>Atto seemed especially upset at the depiction of Somali warlords as cigar-chomping, earring-wearing gangster-types. “I am not smoking cigars, I have no earring on my ears,” he protested. </p>
<p>In the fallout of the debacle, images were broadcast on US television of a dead American soldier being dragged through the streets of Mogadishu. Just months later, President Bill Clinton withdrew US forces from Somalia.</p>
<p>The film’s technical advisers included Colonel Tom Mathews, who had led a unit of the 160<sup>th</sup> SOAR into Mogadishu. Matthews declined to be involved in the film at first but his wife talked him into it.</p>
<p>Star Jason Isaacs posed the question to Ridley Scott at the time: “How do you stop this film from becoming Zulu, about a bunch of white people fighting off hordes of black people?”</p>
<a>Gladiator</a>), the King of Morocco offered to supply tanks, Humvees, and helicopters. But the filmmakers wanted authentic US hardware and personnel too, so requested to use Black Hawks, Little Birds, and Army Rangers for the production.
<p>Once Matthews agreed to enlist as an advisor, almost all of the Pentagon’s top brass had to sign off on the film’s use of Black Hawk helicopters, equipment, pilots and other personnel.</p>
<p>Filmed between March and June 2001, Black Hawk Down looks – and feels – stunning: a searing assault of the nerves and senses, put through the Hollywood filter. Gruesome, gritty war has rarely looked so good.</p>
<sup>th</sup> SOAR – including Mogadishu veterans – though the film had multiple real-life soldiers “rolled up into one”. In reality, around 160 men went into the mission – the film whittles them down to around 40 characters.
<p>The death of one soldier – blown in half while Tom Sizemore’s Danny McKnight watches on – was exaggerated, while another grisly scene, showing a soldier finding and pocketing his pal’s severed hand, really did happen.</p>
<p>A pirated version of the film premiered in Mogadishu in early 2002. A New York Times journalist reported on the event: “The Somalis were cheering when the American soldiers were shot and cheering when the helicopters went down.”</p>
<h1> JK Rowling’s battle to make the Harry Potter films ‘100 per cent British’ </h1>
<p> How the the boy wizard defeated all attempts at 'Hollywoodisation' – thanks to his creator's strict 'no Americans allowed' casting rule </p>
<div> <div> By Tom Fordy <time> 3 January 2022 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<a>a reunion special</a> – Britishness feels absolutely essential to the series’ $7.7 billion success.
<p><a>JK Rowling</a> may have been largely absent from the reunion, but fans can thank her for maintaining the books’ integrity on the big screen.</p>
<p>Warner Bros – believing it to be a money issue – upped its offer to Rowling. But she wanted assurances that any sequels would follow her own books – she feared a “Harry Does Las Vegas” style spin-off.</p>
<p>Rowling sold the film rights for a reported £1 million. She was protective from the outset, admitting that she was “ready to hate” screenwriter Steve Kloves: “This was the man who was gonna butcher my baby.”</p>
<p>Kloves, however, thought Rowling was “the greatest asset”. She sat in on pre-production meetings and read every draft of the script.</p>
<p>Others, however, insisted that Rowling wielded an impressive amount of influence over the film. “[Rowling] has more control than I think possibly most other people have ever had,” said her agent, Christopher Little, in a 2000 interview.</p>
<p>Rowling insisted that the cast was British or Irish and that the film was made in Britain. British film industry representatives flew out to the US for talks – to negotiate and ensure the film’s production here. </p>
<a>Chris Columbus</a> ultimately signed up (he also directed the first sequel, The Chamber of Secrets). Columbus had a sort-of trial run: he had written the Spielberg-produced
<a>Young Sherlock Holmes</a>, a boarding school-set adventure that now seems extremely Potter-esque.
<p>Columbus wanted Daniel Radcliffe for the role from the start, after seeing him in the BBC’s 1999 adaptation of David Copperfield. But Radcliffe’s parents were unsure at first. </p>
<p>After an appeal on BBC's Newsround, they saw a whopping 40,000 kids. Casting director Susie Figgis reportedly quit over frustrations with Columbus and an American casting director coming onboard to extend the search stateside.</p>
<p>“I feel I have done my absolute best to find a child and during our search we've met some great kids,” Figgis told the Daily Mail. “Ultimately, it's the director's point of view and vision.”</p>
<p>A source from the production wrote the story off as tabloid hysteria. “This will be a British Harry,” they told ABC News. “Not a single person in this film will be anything other than British.”</p>
<p>Williams later made a play for Professor Lupin in the third film, The Prisoner of Azkaban, but was once again denied. David Thewlis got the role instead.</p>
<p>Deals were struck with Hasbro, Mattel, Electronic Arts, and Lego, but Rowling rejected a deal with McDonalds – she didn’t want to see Harry Potter put into a Happy Meal.</p>
<header> <h1> Beatles, ghosts and murdered aristocrats: the dark history of Abbey Road </h1> <p> Before becoming the most famous music studio in the world, the house in north London was the scene of scandal, criminality and hauntings </p> </header>

<a>George Bernard Shaw</a>, the orchestra played Land of Hope and Glory. It was recorded, and the session was filmed by Pathé (in what now is a rare surviving audio film of Elgar). The studio was
<a>Abbey Road</a>. And Elgar, who died a little over two years later, was a fitting choice for its debut recording: he had been an advocate of gramophone records for many years.
<a>Beatles </a>would cement its legendary status by recording classic songs from Help! and Lady Madonna to Paperback Writer and The Fool on the Hill. 
<h1> Drugs, diets and coercive control: the sad story of Brian Wilson’s conservatorship </h1>
<p> Britney Spears recently celebrated her escape from a conservatorship. But in 1992, one saved the Beach Boy's singer's career – and his life </p>
<div> <div> By Tom Fordy <time> 21 November 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<a>videotapes of Wilson’s poor physical state</a>. In the flesh, Reum’s fears about Wilson were confirmed. 
<p>The doctor-patient relationship went back to 1976, when Landy first put Wilson under his aggressive treatment program – 24/7 supervision and total surrender to Landy’s methods.</p>
<p>While pop fans this week are celebrating Britney Spears’ escape from a conservatorship, back in 1992 Wilson escaped into a conservatorship – a legal ruling that helped prise him from the grip of Eugene Landy.</p>
<p>It was Wilson’s first wife, Marilyn, who contacted Dr Eugene Landy, described by Brian Wilson biographer Peter Ames Carlin as a “hustler-turned-psychologist”. </p>
<p>With his perfectly white teeth and immaculately coiffed hair, Landy specialised in treating dysfunctional Tinseltown types. Landy also did a strong line in self-promotion; clearly, he had designs on the spotlight himself.</p>
<p>Landy declared that Wilson needed 24/7 therapy for at least two years and put together a team, which included himself, a physician, a nutritionist, and handlers to monitor Wilson’s every move.</p>
<p>Landy had success. He put Wilson on a diet – even padlocking the fridge. He shooed away Wilson’s druggy pals, though Wilson was sometimes permitted a joint as a reward for good work.</p>
<p>Brian Wilson was back in shape and recording and playing live with the Beach Boys again. They even had a snappy PR slogan: “Brian is back”. Landy shared column inches with Brian in Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>But there were sinister behind-the-scenes stories: that Wilson was only allowed his dinner if he did as he was told; or worse – that one of Landy’s entourage stood over him at the piano with a baseball bat.</p>
<p>“I feel like a prisoner, and I don’t know when it’s going to end,” Wilson said in a 1976 interview. If he tried to escape, Wilson claimed, Landy might put him “on the funny farm”.</p>
<p>Not satisfied with being a self-appointed Beach Boy, the not-so-good doctor steered Wilson into a solo career. Landy naturally took an executive producer credit on Brian's first solo album.</p>
<p>Landy certainly believed in his own hype. As he said in a 1988 interview: “Brian Wilson is a perfect example of the fact that in my field, I’m an artist.”</p>
<p>Mike Love – who feuded with Wilson himself over credits and royalties – spoke out: “Landy thinks that Brian is the goose that laid the golden egg.”</p>
<p>In February 1988, the California Board of Medical Quality Assurance brought charges against Landy – for sexual misconduct with a female patient and misconduct and gross negligence with Wilson. </p>

<sup> </sup>1962 was a dream made real. Six years earlier, in a transformative moment at a cinema in Liverpool, the 14-year old
<a>Paul McCartney</a> had watched transfixed as Richard sang the song Ready Teddy in The Girl Can’t Help It. When McCartney met John Lennon for the first time the following year, the two boys bonded over a love of the film.

<a>Sly The Family Stone</a>, Luther Vandross, and many more. He co-wrote the Joe Cocker classic You Are So Beautiful and appeared on Exile On Main Street,
<a>the Rolling Stones’</a> one true masterpiece. As a member of the Stones’ touring party for much of the seventies, he was so well liked that Keith Richards threatened to put him in hospital only once.

<a>Team Lennon or Team McCartney</a>. 
<h2>Lennon’s numerology</h2>
<a>Warhol-esque</a> approach to their fame. While McCartney chucked buckets of water over the press, Lennon preferred to tease them with cryptic pronouncements. 
<h2>When John met ET (and Uri Geller)</h2>
<p>ET’s next appearance was more eerie and intimate. Uri Geller, the Israeli mentalist, told the Telegraph in 2004 that he and Lennon had been having dinner when the talk turned to UFOs. </p>
<p>“You believe in this stuff, right?” Lennon asked Geller. “Well, you ain’t f---in’ gonna believe this.” </p>
<p>Lennon tried to throw them off – but the aliens pushed him back. “They didn’t touch me. It was like they just willed me. Pushed me with willpower and telepathy.”</p>
<h2>The Charles Manson connection </h2>
<h2>‘Turn me on, dead man’ </h2>
<p>“It was a bit weird meeting people shortly after that, because they'd be looking at the back of my ears, looking a bit through me,” said McCartney. “And it was weird doing the ‘I really am him’ stuff.” </p>
<h2>‘Oswald couldn’t have done it’ </h2>
<p>“Well he couldn’t have done it, could he?” a voice said. Annoyed at the interruption and not recognising the voice, Lane replied: “Who is this? And who couldn’t have done what?”</p>
<p>“Sorry. Paul, Paul McCartney,” said the voice. “We met the other night. And I meant that Oswald could not have killed President Kennedy.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t the end of McCartney and Lane’s involvement, though. The next year, as Lane was editing the documentary based on his book, Macca swung back into his life. Lane picked up the story in his autobiography: </p>
<p>Alas, McCartney’s involvement wasn’t to be. The documentary’s director, Emile de Antonio, thought a McCartney score would distract from its sober approach and interfere with its “stark and didactic” style. </p>
