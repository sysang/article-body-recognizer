<p>“Cristiano and Edi did a lot for the team,” said Rangnick. “It is important to have them on board, the work-ethic they showed was important.” </p>
<p>“We only decided this afternoon at two o'clock that he would play as he had some problems with the ankle contusion he suffered at Newcastle, so it was good to have him available and in the team,” Rangnick said. </p>
<h1> 'I didn't think we were all together': Luke Shaw launches scathing attack on Man Utd team-mates </h1>
<p> Shaw questioned United’s togetherness while Ralf Rangnick refused to offer any guarantees of a top-four finish after Wolves' 1-0 victory </p>
<div> <div> By James Ducker, Northern Football Correspondent, at Old Trafford <time> 3 January 2022 • 10:01pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Luke Shaw questioned Manchester United’s togetherness and Ralf Rangnick refused to offer any guarantees of a top-four finish after the club crashed to a sixth defeat in their past 14 Premier League matches at Old Trafford on Monday night.</p>
<p>Joao Moutinho’s 82nd-minute volley earned Wolverhampton Wanderers a deserved 1-0 victory - their first win at Old Trafford for 42 years - and ended Rangnick’s unbeaten start as interim manager.</p>
<p>Defeat leaves United four points adrift of Arsenal, in fourth, with a game in hand, with Shaw hinting at a lack of unity and motivation in the camp. </p>
<p>Shaw’s remarks come less than a week after Gary Neville branded United’s players a “bunch of whinge-bags” during a 1-1 draw at Newcastle and Rangnick called on the team to stop moaning at each other on the pitch. </p>
<p>“They were miles better in the first half. We let them take control of the game. Maybe rhythm, intensity, aggression are lacking.”</p>
<p>Rangnick admitted United “still have a long way to go” to improve and would offer no promises that the club would finish the season in the top four. </p>
<p>“I knew this could and would be hard but today's game showed we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p>“Today we showed similar problems the team had three or four weeks ago before I arrived. It is not an easy job to develop a DNA with and without the ball. The game today showed there are still quite a few steps to [make].”</p>
<p>Rangnick’s decision to substitute Mason Greenwood - United’s best attacking player on the night - after an hour was met with a chorus of boos by the Old Trafford crowd but the German defended the decision. </p>
<h2>'We gave away a goal that was far too easy - Moutinho could shoot unmarked with no pressure'</h2>
<a>after Phil Jones had cleared a cross as far as the Wolves midfielder.</a>
<p>“The goal we conceded showed our problems defensively. We defended the cross but nobody was there to block the shot, we gave away a goal that was far too easy. Moutinho could shoot unmarked with no problems, no pressure.</p>
<p>“We didn’t press at all. We tried but we were not able to get into those pressing situations. We’re very disappointed about the result and parts of our performance. The game showed we still have a lot of work to do.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Paul Ince, the former United midfielder, queried performances from the team under Rangnick and questioned whether the interim manager would be in charge any longer than the end of the season.</p>
<p>Asked if there had been progress, Ince told Sky Sports: "If I'm being totally honest, then no.</p>
<p>He added: "Do you see Ralf being the manager come the end of the season? The answer on the basis at this moment - and it is early doors - you've got to say no.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure if this job is a poisoned chalice. It's the biggest job in the world, the biggest club in the world, but it's like a poisoned chalice."</p>
<h1> 'They're a bunch of whinge-bags': Gary Neville tears into Man Utd players after Newcastle draw </h1>
<p> Neville was unimpressed with the body language on show during the draw at Newcastle, while Ralf Rangnick says he 'didn't like' the display </p>
<div> <div> By Mike McGrath <time> 28 December 2021 • 9:39am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Allan Saint-Maximin looked to have put the relegation candidates on course for what would have been a desperately needed victory for Eddie Howe’s side, before Edinson Cavani snatched a draw with 20 minutes remaining.</p>
<p>“They are a bunch of whinge-bags, their arms were in the air. They were shocking in the first half. They got the last manager the sack and they will get a lot of managers the sack like that,” said Sky Sports pundit Neville.</p>
<p>Rangnick could not understand why his players were not intense or physical in a match they had 16 days to prepare for due to postponements during the spread of Covid-19 omicron variant. </p>
<p>“Maybe there might still be some side effects of Covid but I don’t think we should look for excuses,” said Rangnick.</p>
<p>“I didn’t like it at all. We were trying to get better in controlling games but we did not control this game apart from very few moments.</p>
<p>Howe’s survival hopes were dealt a blow after injuries to Saint-Maximin and Callum Wilson, with Wednesday’s fixture against Everton now under threat over the number of available Newcastle players. </p>
<p>Wilson fell to the floor just before the interval with no opponent near him, before clutching his calf. Saint-Maximin appeared to injure his knee in the second half and Fabian Schär was holding his hamstring at the end of the match.</p>
<p>“With Saint-Maximin there is certainly an injury there. I tried to talk to him when he came off but I couldn’t understand him with the noise. </p>
<p>“I believe it is 13 plus a goalkeeper that you need to play a game and we are going to be very dangerously close to that number.”</p>
<p>It was also revealed that Howe told his players in the dressing room after the match that they will climb out of the relegation zone with similar performances to the one they produced against United. </p>

<li>Wolves pick up first away league win against Manchester United since February 1980</li>
<li>Ragged and rudderless United outplayed by Bruno Lage's team</li>
<li>Phil Jones one of hosts' better performers in first appearance for almost two years</li>
<p>And so when Moutinho collected the clearance he had time and space - and although he did not strike it cleanly - he found the corner of the net. By then Fernandes had made a token effort to run but it was too late. He was five yards away, watching.</p>
<p>It did not last. Wolves regained control and also struck the bar with Romain Saiss’s curling free-kick clipping the top of the goal-frame. Then Jimenez volleyed narrowly wide, from close-range, as he met a cross ahead of Shaw.</p>
<h3>Full time: Manchester United 0 Wolverhampton Wanderers 1</h3>
<p>That is a fantastic result for Wolves. Well done to Bruno Lage and his boys for a deserved win. 19 attempts they had for their one goal, but that was all it took.</p>
<p>Wolves go into 8th on 28 points. United three points ahead of them in 7th.</p>

<div> <div> <div> <p>Let's get to the match report without further ado.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>90+5 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 1 </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Bruno and Ronaldo stand over it.... Bruno Fernandes lashes the ball and Jose Sa produces a superb save. Oh that's fantastic. And that's the last action of the game. Magnificent.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>90+4 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 1 </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Rashford has won United a late corner. De Gea? No. Not cleared. Fabio Silva tries to poke it clear and has kicked PHIL JONES in the face on the edge of the area. Freekick.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>90+3 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 1 </h3>
<div> <div> <p>Aimless cross into the Wolves box. Marcal, maybe a bit overcautious, heads behind. </p> <p>Confusion in the Wolves box, but the keeper Jose Sa gathers in the end. Oop, he's been booked for timewasting now.</p> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <a><time>7:21PM</time></a> <div> <h3>90+1 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 1 </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Wolves eat up maybe a minute of the five added minutes thus.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>89 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 1 </h3>
<div> <p>Haven't seen Ronaldo do much in terms of inspiring/captaining. But here he is giving the linesman and the ref a serve.</p> <p>United give away a freekick down in that corner. Wolves just keeping the ball, keeping it safe down there.</p> </div>
<div> <h3>88 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 1 </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Wolves fans having a lovely time. And their players having plenty of the ball down by one of the United corner flags.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <a><time>7:15PM</time></a> <div> <h3>84 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 1 </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>What have United got? Well, the first thing, is a freekick because Matic has been fouled.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>GOAL! Man United 0 Wolves 1 (Joao Moutinho 83)</h3>
<div> <div> <p>Traore does well down the right, beats Shaw. Crosses. Sadly, but also fittingly lets face it, Phil Jones's clearing header drops to Joao Moutinho, who takes one touch, and hits a low strike into the corner. Get in there!</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>81 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Raul Jimenez coming off. Decent run out for him. A bit short of his best, fair enough, but good to see him back after that nasty head injury.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>80 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3>
<p>Rashford, on as a sub, tries to dance through but gives it away cheaply. Wolves can break via Moutinho. Podence has it, teasing Varane into diving in. The veteran has seen that movie though, and he stays on his feet. Podence ties himself in knots.</p>
<div> <a><time>7:08PM</time></a> <div> <h3>77 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Raul looking dangerous, lurking and only a few inches from heading a cross in there. Shaw defending stoutly.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>74 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Sais flips the freekick - and hits the bar! De Gea seemed to have it covered, and watched the ball onto the bar. Smart.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>7:04PM</time></a> <div> <h3>73 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Break from Wolves, in the mighty form of Traore. Matic fouls him on the edge of the box.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>69 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Ronaldo sends McTominay through, but Wolves scramble all jets and three men at least throw themselves in the way.</p> <p>Traore, who seems to have covered himself in baby oil, has come on.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>68 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>The preposterous Portuguese goes close again when he breaks, and drags his low shot, hit on the run, wide. Coady did well to show him out wide.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>68 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Wolves cannot clear, and there is a foul. Freekick delivered in, and Ronaldo heads it home! Goa-- no, offside. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>67 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Out of the blue, United have hit the bar. Matic cuts it back from the byline. Bruno Fernandes arrives and strikes it, and it hits the bar! He should have hit the net.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>63 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Podence whips a useful ball in. Raul J arrives hot and heavy, but that is an excellent saving header from Shaw, L. </p> <p>Wolves have their 8th corner. United yet to have one.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Cleared.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>59 mins: Man United 0 Wolves 0 </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Greenwood taken off, the crowd boo. Bruno Fernandes replaces him.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <div> <p>Things pick up for United when they legend Phil Jones joins the attack, this is more like it. Before you know it, the ball has somehow found its way through to M Greenwood, who very nearly bundles through,</p> </div> </div> </div>

<div> <div> <p>"We have some cases. Some players have just trained one or two times. This is life. We are ready and the players will do their best. We have prepared well.</p> <p>"We have been creating chances. The goals will come."</p> </div> </div>

<p>Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral)</p>
<p>Bruno Lage believes Raul Jimenez can provide Wolves with some new-year inspiration.</p>
<p>The striker spent the most of 2021 recovering and finding a way back to fitness after horrifically fracturing his skull in November 2020.</p>
<p>Jimenez has started all but two of Wolves' Premier League games this season, scoring three goals, ahead of Monday's trip to Manchester United and Lage knows his influence is key.</p>
<p>"It is inspiration for them, life is like that. It will put you down and then it's about you to get up and have the power and strength," said the Wolves boss.</p>
<p>"Every time he is like that, that is why he is an inspiration for them. Raul is a good example especially for kids who want to be professionals, the way he works every day is a good example.</p>
<p>"I have just good things to say about him. Raul is defending like a big striker and this is the most important thing. When you look, especially in the modern day, everyone is talking about the meaning of the team and Raul has that.</p>
<p>"He can play both sides of the game. When you are defending you can see Raul and when you are attacking you can see Raul is there to attack.</p>
<p>"After that he is also a top man, I want the best, not just for him but our players. To continue to come with the big ambitions, with happiness to work every day and work to improve the club."</p>
<p>Wolves have scored just 13 times in the league this season as Jimenez and his team-mates struggle for goals, yet they still sit ninth.</p>
<p>The Mexico international has shown glimpses of his best form this term but Lage conceded, having not seen his recovery first-hand, he did not know how much it took Jimenez to return.</p>
<p>"Nuno (Espirito Santo) saw everything, when I started working with Raul he started training with me. I didn't realise or understand what path he needed to do after the injury, to recover," he said.</p>
<p>"When you look for that image with Nuno crying (in the documentary 'Code Red') you can understand what a manager can see when the player is there, injured. It was a long journey for Raul.</p>

<div> <div> By Matt Law, Football News Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 9:57pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>This was not the dream comeback, but it was a step in the right direction on Romelu Lukaku’s road to Chelsea redemption.</p>
<p>Lukaku’s commitment, which he himself had put a question mark over, was evident in a performance full of endeavour, even if it was short on top quality when his two big chances arrived.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, Antonio Conte, back at Chelsea for the first time as head coach of Tottenham, will always love Lukaku following their successful time together at Inter Milan.</p>
<p>Thomas Tuchel had been keen to shut down the noise around Lukaku, following the saga that saw him dropped for the Liverpool game, and the 28-year-old arrived at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night with big headphones over his blue beanie hat.</p>
<p>After 30 minutes, Lukaku had only touched the ball four times and the most interesting thing about his evening had been the Tottenham supporters singing “Romelu Lukaku, he’s Inter Milan”.</p>
<p>Ahead of the match, Chelsea fans had neither cheered nor booed Lukaku’s name when it was read out and he embraced each of his team-mates before kick-off.</p>
<p>A couple of minutes after being serenaded by the visiting Spurs fans, Lukaku won the free-kick from which Ben Davies scored an own goal almost as bewildering as the striker’s public relations own goal in front of the Sky Italia cameras.</p>
<p>There had been an encouraging link-up with Havertz in the opening 20 seconds, although Lukaku failed to find his team-mate inside the box after being set free by his header.</p>
<p>Lukaku got his foot to a low cross from Marcos Alonso, but his hooked effort just after the restart was easy for Hugo Lloris to catch.</p>
<p>Timo Werner replaced Havertz for the second half and he linked well with Lukaku to create a good chance for Ziyech, who made it far too easy for Lloris with a poor shot. The fact Lukaku had received the ball on the ground was far more encouraging.</p>
<p>Lukaku was keen to run the channels, track back to tackle where he could and his hold-up play was good. There is still work to be done, but the healing process has begun.</p>

<p>Chelsea took advantage of Tottenham's mistakes to take a two-goal lead into the second leg of the League Cup semi-final.</p>
<p>Telegraph Sport assesses how impressed and how faltered in Antonio Conte's return to Stamford Bridge.</p>
<p>Rare start, with Edouard Mendy on international duty, but had little to do until required to save well from a Kane free-kick early in the second half. 6</p>
<p>Veteran continues to do well, covering acres of space and often drove upfield. Showed his experience and nous, especially as Spurs enjoyed a better second half showing. 7</p>
<p>Had a good chance from a first half set-piece and proved a commanding presence at the back in dealing with Kane. 7</p>
<p>Young French defender looked composed and comfortable in the first half but more flustered as Spurs improved, picking up a booking for a foul on Kane. 6</p>
<p>Unfamiliar right wing-back role but filled it well and cut inside on a number of occasions to threaten with his shooting prowess. His free-kick led to the second. 9</p>
<p>Along with Saul, stamped his mark on midfield, his defensive work and pressing tiger up the field never allowed Spurs to settle. 7</p>
<p>Couple of crunching midfield tackles - one on Son, in particular - set the tone for a performance full of industry and effort. Stopped Spurs’ midfield from settling. 8</p>
<p>Pressed brilliantly from the left wing-back position, producing the interception that led to the opening goal. 7</p>
<p>Busy night, especially early when Chelsea were so in control. His eye for the pass and good decision making were key to his side’s dominant first half showing. 7</p>
<p>Man of the moment - <a>not for all the right reasons</a> - passed up an early chance for a shot and missed a decent opening with a header. Still worked hard and was a physical handful. 6</p>
<p>Alert to the chance for the opening goal but missed an even better chance soon after. Injured in scoring and replaced at the interval. 7</p>
<p>Timo Werner for Havertz (45 mins) - 7</p>
<p>Mateo Kovacic for Mount (72 mins) - 6</p>
<p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek for Saul (72 mins) - 6</p>
<p>Christian Pulisic for Ziyech (79 mins) - 5</p>
<p>Harvey Vale for Azpilicueta (89 mins) - N/A</p>
<p>Werner had plenty of the ball after coming on at the interval while Mount and Saul had put in major shifts by the time they were given a rest. Loftus-Cheek, in particular, looked lively.</p>
<p>No chance with the first half goals and dealt well enough with the numerous other threats and chances Chelsea created. 6</p>
<p>Looked shaky with his poor pass to Emerson leading to the opener before his disastrous header gifted Chelsea a second off Davies. 4</p>
<p>Could do nothing about the deflection for the opening goal but his foul on Lukaku led to the free-kick that brought about the second. 5</p>
<p>Could not be blamed for the disaster that was his own goal but Ziyech caused plenty of problems down his flank and he often looked out-manned. 5</p>
<p>Wing-back did not help his defenders break the press well enough by making the passing angles. Struggled to deal with Havertz and Alonso on his flank. 5</p>
<p>Looked better after the break but Chelsea’s pressing and swarming midfield gave him no time on the ball. Struggled to pick up Chelsea’s runners at times. 5</p>
<p>Lazy clearance hit Skipp and set up a great chance for Havertz but, like most of his team-mates, put in a better second half shift. 6</p>
<p>Had a couple of promising forays into Chelsea territory but an obvious man to be sacrificed at the interval when Conte tried to rescue the tie. 5</p>
<p>Half chance midway through the second half was as close as he could come to a goal. Kept working but had little service to work with. 5</p>
<p>Had hardly had a touch until the 49th minute when his free-kick beat the Chelsea wall but not Kepa. Took a painful blow to the face from Sarr. 6</p>
<p>Like all his forward line, worked hard enough but had seen nothing resembling a chance by the time he was replaced with 11 minutes left. 5</p>
<p>Tanguy Ndombele for Doherty (45 mins) - 7</p>
<p>Harry Winks for Skipp (73 mins) - 5</p>
<p>Giovani Lo Celso for Son (79 mins) - 6</p>
<p>Bryan Gil for Moura (79 mins) - 6</p>
<p>Ndombele added bite in midfield and his introduction allowed Conte to go to four at the back. Lo Celso and Gil almost combined for a goal.</p>

<p>Newcastle United have made a £22.5 million bid for Everton defender Lucas Digne with midfielder Sean Longstaff offered as part of the deal.</p>
<p>Telegraph Sport revealed on Tuesday that Newcastle would turn their attention to Digne after signing Kieran Trippier from Atlético Madrid for £12m and a bid was made on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Everton are keen on Longstaff, who only has six months left on his contract and made his first team debut under Rafael Benítez in 2019, and that has given Newcastle the framework of a deal that is acceptable to the Merseyside club.</p>
<p>Newcastle are the first club to make an approach and are willing to give the former Paris St-Germain star some time to consider their offer, but they will not hang around if he is genuinely reluctant to join them.</p>
<p>Newcastle will turn their attention to the signing of a centre-back and a striker before they focus on the loan market once the Digne situation has been clarified.</p>
<p>That is likely to mean Newcastle make a second bid for Lille’s Holland Under-21 international Sven Botman with Sevilla's Diego Carlos also of strong interest if the French club do not budge in their insistence he is not for sale this month.</p>
<p>Howe had made the signing of defenders the most pressing focus of recruitment and having landed Trippier the club sensibly wish to focus on specific targets for the rest of the week in the hope they can make a second breakthrough.</p>
