<div><div><h1>Up, up and they pay: $2.6M winning bid for Superman #1 comic</h1></div><div>December 17, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>NEW YORK (AP) — A rare copy of a Superman #1 comic book that sold on newsstands for a dime in 1939 was purchased for $2.6 million in an auction. </p>
<p>The comic showing Superman leaping over tall buildings on the cover was sold Thursday night to a buyer who wishes to maintain a secret identity, according to ComicConnect.com, an online auction and consignment company. </p>
<p>The seller, Mark Michaelson, bought the comic in 1979 from its original owner and kept it in a temperature-controlled safe. Michaelson, now semi-retired and living in Houston, paid his way through college by buying and selling comics. </p>
<p>“Now you look at the comic books and you go ‘superheroes everywhere.’ You look back in the ’30s, there was no such thing. So this was literally the first superhero,” said ComicConnect CEO Stephen Fishler.</p>
<p>Fishler said what really makes the copy sold this week notable is that it is very difficult to find high-quality copies of Superman #1.</p>
<div><div><h1>Police: Van full of Christmas toys stolen in New Mexico</h1></div><div>December 17, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>FARMINGTON, N.M. (AP) — Time is of the essence for the Salvation Army in New Mexico now that the Grinch has thrown a wrench into the group’s holiday toy program.</p>
<p>A van loaded with $6,000 worth of toys set to be passed out to hundreds of children was stolen this week from a store parking lot in Farmington.</p>
<p>“It is a pretty Grinch-like thing to do,” Farmington police spokesperson Nicole Brown told the Farmington Daily Times.</p>
<p>Brown said a detective conducted interviews following Tuesday’s theft and the investigation is ongoing.</p>
<p>Farmington police reached out via Facebook for the public’s help in finding the white minivan.</p>
<p>“Shock, disbelief, just how somebody could do that — especially in a marked vehicle, taking gifts for children,” Lt. Christopher Rockwell with the Salvation Army Farmington Corps <a>told KOB-TV.</a></p>
<p>Meant for more than 350 kids, the toys were set to be distributed on Dec. 20. Now, the hope is to replace the stolen toys before Monday. Rockwell said the community has already responded in a big way by donating more toys and money.</p>

<p>Bishop Sycamore’s report filed with the department for this school year listed only one enrolled student and stated its physical address as a home in a residential neighborhood.</p>
<p>In a call with a department official last month, Bishop Sycamore administrator Andre Peterson characterized his program as a way to get more exposure for football players who were having trouble getting into colleges, according to the ODE report. </p>
<p>ODE <a>concluded Bishop Sycamore wasn’t a school</a> but “a way for students to play football against high school teams and potentially increase students’ prospects of playing football at the collegiate level.” </p>
<p>“The cost of this dream for those students wasn’t just the tuition charged to attend the school,” the department said in its report Friday. “The price was the education the students were entitled to receive.” </p>
<p>The department also noted that such schools aren’t under its oversight and don’t require its approval, and that it doesn’t have power under state law to sanction Bishop Sycamore.</p>

<p>AKRON, Ohio (AP) — A 58-foot-long (18-meter) pedestrian bridge stolen from an Ohio city last month has been found and a man is facing charges, police said.</p>
<p>Police discovered on Nov. 3 that someone had removed the treated deck boards of the 10-foot-wide (3-meter-wide), 6-foot-tall (2-meter-tall) structure. On Nov. 11, they found that the metal frame had been taken.</p>
<p>A 63-year-old man was charged with felony theft, according to Akron police and court records. Authorities allege that he paid a trucking company for crane service and the firm picked up the bridge and took it to Medina County.</p>
<p>The suspect was scheduled for arraignment later this week in Akron Municipal Court. An official said Monday he has no attorney yet; listed phone numbers for him were not in service.</p>
<p>The bridge is expected to be shipped back to Akron in coming days, police said.</p>

<p>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — A troop of fat, hungry squirrels has put the kibosh on a downtown St. Paul park’s holiday lights display.</p>
<p>The wires, it turns out, were coated with polylactic acid, a derivative of corn sugar, an appealing appetizer for squirrels spoiled by park visitors who won’t stop feeding them, said Ann LaBore, co-chair of the friends group.</p>
<p>“They try and lead them around the park,” she said. “One guy was trying to get one to jump on him. It’s a little disturbing.”</p>
<p>Blame the “tree rats,” La Bore said.</p>
<p>“People look down from their condos or apartments and they want to see the twinkly lights,” she said. “Well, we can’t have twinkly lights. It was probably this or nothing.”</p>
<p>The story has been updated to correct the name of the wire coating to polylactic acid and to correct the day of the newspaper’s report to Tuesday.</p>

<p>Portage officials said they can’t cover payroll on Dec. 31. The money won’t be available until Jan. 3, the (Northwest Indiana) Times reported.</p>
<p>Portage typically has 26 paydays a year but has 27 in 2021.</p>

<p>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — A crew cutting down a dying oak at the University of Nebraska made a surprising find — flying squirrels.</p>
<p>Powell was surprised by their presence, if not by their elusiveness.</p>
<p>“It’s among the species that’s harder to document because they’re not out when people are around,” he said. “And they’re little dudes.”</p>
<p>Still, Shaun Dunn, a natural heritage zoologist for the state of Nebraska, was not surprised by the Lincoln flying squirrels. He has documented 15 confirmed sightings since 2018.</p>
<p>Dunn isn’t sure how the flying squirrels got to Lincoln but said it’s “very unlikely they made it here on their own.”</p>
<p>Though graceful in the air, the animals are awkward on the ground. Because their sail-like flaps run from wrist to ankle he said they move more like a hobbled horse.</p>
<div><div><h1>Extinct shark named after LSU museum official as she retires</h1></div><div>December 24, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — A Louisiana State University museum official has received a unique retirement gift -- researchers in Alabama and South Carolina named a prehistoric shark species after her. </p>
<p>“I am very honored to be recognized by my peers for my work,” Ting, who studied mammal paleontology, said in a news release Thursday, the day she retired.</p>
<p>Because shark skeletons are made of cartilage rather than bone, their teeth are often the only fossils available.</p>
<p>The two scientists realized that some hand-sized teeth were from a previously unrecognized species. Their paper identifying and describing it was published this week in the journal Cainozoic Research.</p>
<p>The researchers spent months studying the teeth, comparing them to those of other fossil and modern-day sharks. </p>
<p>“We were able to determine that the fossil species was closely related to modern requiem sharks, so we used jaws of modern species to reconstruct how the teeth were arranged in the mouth of the extinct species,” Cicimurri said.</p>
<p>According to the researchers, Carcharhinus tingae teeth have not yet been found anywhere but Louisiana, where they are relatively common — evidence that these sharks lived in an ancient ocean that covered what is now Louisiana.</p>
<p>The scientists came to LSU to work on a chapter for a book that is not yet published, to be titled “Vertebrate Fossils of Louisiana.”</p>
<div><div><h1>Hundreds of parakeets dropped off at Michigan animal shelter</h1></div><div>December 26, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>ROMEO, Mich. (AP) — An animal shelter in Michigan has been inundated with hundreds of parakeets.</p>
<p>The Detroit Animal Welfare Group in Romeo said in a Facebook post that the small, colorful birds were dropped off Thursday night, The Detroit News reported.</p>
<p>“We were in shock also but could not turn them away as they were all crammed in seven cages and smothering each other and needed immediate help,” the shelter said in the post.</p>
<a>the Detroit Free Press</a> that the son of an animal hoarder had called to say he was coming to surrender 60 to 80 parakeets from his father’s house. But he showed up Thursday with 497 parakeets in his truck.
<p>Shelter officials said they reached out to bird rescue organizations for help. Temporary housing for the parakeets was found and food was donated for the birds.</p>
<p>The birds have to quarantine for 30 days. Adoptions were expected to begin Jan. 23, the Detroit News reported.</p>

<div><div><h1>Sweet repeat: Brothers regift same hard candy for decades</h1></div><div>December 24, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Two New Hampshire brothers have gotten their holiday regifting skills down to an art — they’ve been passing the same hard candy back and forth for over 30 years. </p>
<p>It started in 1987, when Ryan Wasson gave a 10-roll Frankford “Santa’s Candy Book” with assorted fruit flavors to his brother, Eric Wasson, as a joke for Christmas, knowing that Eric wouldn’t like it. </p>
<p>“I didn’t eat them,” Eric Wasson told WMUR-TV. “And so the next year I thought, ‘Hey, I think I’m going to give it back to him. He’ll never remember.’”</p>
<p>But Ryan immediately recognized it. They’ve been taking turns ever since, keeping a log of their exchanges. They’ve gotten creative about it. </p>
<p>Ryan Wasson told the station the candy has been frozen in a block of ice and put in Jell-O, adding, “He one time sewed it into a teddy bear.”</p>
<p>The tradition has also involved family members, co-workers and even a sheriff’s department. Last year, it was presented to Ryan Wasson on a silver platter at a restaurant. </p>
<p>This year, Ryan Wasson turned to a group on social media for ideas. Suggestions included having it arrive via a pizza delivery or Christmas carolers, hiding it in a book or cake, or holding a scavenger hunt with clues.</p>
<p>“If you ask which one has ever done the best as far as giving these, we’re both going to say it’s ourself, right?” Ryan Wasson said. “We’re never going to give in.”</p>

<div><div><h1>A full deck of cards: Ohio House signs on to aide’s ambition</h1></div><div>By JULIE CARR SMYTHDecember 27, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>So when Headlee learned that the state Chamber of Commerce had produced a deck of trading cards featuring the names and faces of every sitting state lawmaker, his collector’s instincts kicked in.</p>
<p>“After I got a couple of members who I knew well to sign their cards, I thought, I wonder how many could I get?” he said. “Could I get 10? Could I get 20? Could I get 30?”</p>
<p>Ultimately, Headlee landed the John Hancocks of all 99 members of the Ohio House. He was pleasantly surprised that lawmakers of both parties played along and seemed to enjoy it. </p>
<li><div><a><h4>Governor gives 'Jeopardy' contestant a 2nd chance at clue</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Headlee made certain rules for himself as he pursued the signatures. Notably, he wouldn’t interrupt legislators as they conducted official business in committee or on the House floor. </p>
<p>He noticed that he ran into many of the same lawmakers repeatedly at first, because they shared something — party, geography, a policy interest — with his boss, state Rep. Adam Bird, a Republican from the village of New Richmond.</p>
<p>Headlee fairly easily collected his first 60 signatures. He’d catch people in the halls or on the streets around Columbus’ Capitol Square. Many representatives didn’t even know the cards existed.</p>
<p>“There were several members who I don’t think realized they’d had a baseball card made of them,” he said. “I always liked to see the smile on a member’s face when I got to explain where these came from.”</p>
<p>The Ohio Chamber produces the cards once per decade and distributes them at its annual policy conference, spokesperson Courtney Whetstone said.</p>
<p>Attendees this September received a rubber-banded packet of about 20 cards when they arrived, then more cards when they attended additional events, she said. </p>
<p>“They were randomized, and certain packs were held back for the second day, so you had to be there both days to get them all,” she said. “They were really aggressively being traded.”</p>
<p>Headlee pulled a string with a friend to get a complete deck, he said, which also includes cards for Ohio’s 33 state senators, one for Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, and a group of cards showing current members as they looked in 2001. </p>
<p>He took to carrying his cards everywhere, tucked into his jacket pocket along with an official House signing pen. He thought it a nice touch, but the pens sometimes smudged on the shiny cardstock. </p>
<p>As Headlee’s stack of unsigned cards dwindled, the aide had to be more deliberate. He asked mutual acquaintances for key introductions, pigeonholed members after committee hearings or called their offices for appointments. </p>
<p>“She’s obviously very busy,” he said. “I was thinking maybe that’s a bridge too far, I might not get the chance.”</p>
<p>But a member who had already signed their own card briefed Sykes on Headlee’s project and arranged for them to meet.</p>
<p>As she signed with a gracious smile, Headlee said it bolstered his hopes for the future of politics in these fractious days. “That somebody cared enough about my little project to do that, I was very grateful.” </p>

<p>A New York resident who was stumped by a “Jeopardy” question about his state’s governor got a do-over Friday, joining Gov. Kathy Hochul’s virtual COVID-19 briefing to tell her he knows who she is now.</p>
<p>The clue was read again Friday by a Hochul staff member who at first said “first female president” and then corrected himself to “governor of New York state.” Walthall correctly responded, “Who is Kathy Hochul?”</p>
<p>None of the contestants in the episode that aired Wednesday answered the question about Hochul, even Amy Schneider, the “Jeopardy” juggernaut who had won 22 consecutive games as of Thursday’s broadcast.</p>
<p>Walthall told Hochul that his episode was filmed “a couple months ago, right when you took office, so that’s part of the reason why I may have sat out on that question.”</p>
<p>Hochul, the former lieutenant governor, took over as governor in August when fellow Democrat Andrew Cuomo resigned amid sexual misconduct allegations. A “Jeopardy” spokesperson said Wednesday’s episode was filmed Oct. 12.</p>

<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Ohio’s debut of its new license plate failed to take off — because a banner depicted on the plate was attached to the wrong end of the Wright Brothers’ historic first plane, the Wright Flyer.</p>
<p>After the unveiling, Ohio officials said in a statement that they were aware of the mishap and it would be corrected to show the banner trailing the plane before Ohioans upgrade their plates.</p>

<p>Ohio isn’t the only one who has made this flighty error. The front of the Wright Flyer can easily be mistaken for its back because the plane’s propellers were located at the back, instead of the front. </p>
