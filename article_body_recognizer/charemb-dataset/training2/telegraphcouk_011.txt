<p>Whatever kind you have, it will brighten January dishes with a perky heat and beguiling flavour, as well as being good for you – probably.</p>
<h2>Different ways of cutting fresh ginger</h2>
<p>The woody fibres in ginger get more pronounced the older the ginger is, and run along the length. Slice the ginger crossways, through the fibres, into coins or “planks” which are good for adding to broths for flavour.</p>
<p>To make matchsticks for stir fries, which will add a texture as well as bursts of flavour, stack up the slices and cut them across into elegant strips.</p>
<p>Cut across again to make tiny dice, a more discreet way of adding ginger flavour, good for ginger cakes.</p>
<p>Grate ginger for fast flavour – stand the grater on a plate so that the juice isn’t lost.</p>
<p>For pure flavour, squeeze cubes of fresh ginger in a garlic press to extract the juice.</p>

<p>She wrote the book during the first year of the pandemic and in it reflects often on how lucky she is to have access to healthy food, as well as praising those who have fed and nurtured others during the Covid crisis.</p>
<p>Barrymore, who likes getting her hands dirty and loves carbs (a bowl of pasta in particular), says her favourite meal is “any breakfast my daughters make me. With varying degrees of edibility.”</p>

<header> <h1> The best places to eat, drink and shop in Bermondsey </h1> <p> Chef José Pizarro reveals his favourite spots, from the go-to restaurants for small plates to small cafés </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 4 January 2022 • 9:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Pizarro’s spiritual home is Bermondsey, where he first opened a restaurant in 2010 and where he now has two sites. “It was completely different then than now, people thought we were crazy opening there,” he says. </p>
<p>“But I loved the area and saw the potential. Although it’s completely changed, it still has a neighbourhood, community feel to it.”</p>
<p>Today it’s a food-lovers’ paradise, and here are Pizarro’s favourite spots.</p>
<p>This is an absolutely lovely Thai restaurant where I always feel welcome. It’s somewhere I go to unwind, to have a simple meal packed with lots of flavour. The food is great and they know how to make you happy.</p>
<p>Murano is a very important restaurant for me. Angela Hartnett is a master with pasta, so I’ll get whatever’s on the menu. I love the ragu there. I go a minimum once a month, it’s somewhere I go to escape.</p>
<p>It’s a proper independent locals’ pub with a gorgeous landlady who’s very welcoming. You can get a lovely burger and nice local beers. It’s full of cool people and I’ve been going for 15 years.</p>
<p>Another place I love is Bermondsey Corner, a classic little French deli. They sell really good breads, particularly their French baguettes, and amazing pates, honeys, tinned food and cheese.</p>
<p>142 Bermondsey St, London SE1 3TX</p>
<p>Though it’s smaller than the more famous Borough Market nearby, I love to go to Maltby Street Market. I go there for smoked salmon, bread, and all sorts that you don’t really need, but everything looks so amazing you end up buying it.</p>
<p>They make one of the best coffees around, and really nice sandwiches too. I’ll usually have a quick espresso.</p>

<header> <h1> The best frying pans you can buy, from cast iron to non-stick and stainless steel </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 12 February 2021 • 3:48pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>To find the best frying pans on the market, we asked chefs, food writers, and cookware professionals for their thoughts, and then put the standout items to the test in The Telegraph kitchen.</p>
<p>Each frying pan was tested for a variety of regular functions: frying or scrambling eggs, searing steaks, sautéing vegetables. We also considered: weight, ease of use, amount of oil required, washing, and more.</p>
<ul> <li>See also: Telegraph Recommended's review of the best rice cookers, <a>best air fryers</a>, <a>best induction hobs</a>, <a>best saucepan sets</a> and the <a>best woks </a>that money can buy</li> </ul>
<p>Below is our pick of the best frying pans on the market, across the range of styles, followed by an expert-led explanation of the pros and cons of each type of frying pan.</p>
<div> <h3>1. Solidteknics 26cm Aus-Ion seamless iron skillet </h3> <p>Why we like it: the heat retention is superb and the single-sheet design means it will last longer than a lifetime</p> <p><a>£139.90, Buy Me Once</a> </p> </div>
<p>To hold, the pan feels immediately heavy. At 2kg, I didn't find it too cumbersome to lift, but neither is it one for casually tossing pancakes; stirring onions was a lot easier than tossing them, for example.</p>
<h3>2. Scanpan CTX 26cm non-stick frying pan</h3>
<p>Why we like it: all the benefits of non-stick, with added durability</p>
<p><a>£104.25, Amazon</a></p>
<a>Mohs </a>scale score of 9.5 – which, to you and me, means it's almost as strong as diamond.
<p>Overall, a strong piece of kit for a strong price.</p>
<h3>3. ProCook Elite Tri-Ply 26cm stainless steel frying pan</h3>
<p>Why we like it: a simple steel number that can be used and abused</p>
<p>This solid, sturdy stainless steel pan with an aluminium core offers even heat distribution at a very reasonable price point.</p>
<div> <div> <p>When food does stick, a little water helps loosen it up again. </p> </div> </div>
<p>Because it's made of steel, the pan is impervious to the threat of warping when exposed to high heats (the same cannot be said of of most non-stick products). That in part explains why many chefs choose steel pans. </p>
<h5>Other frying pans tested</h5>
<p>While we picked a winner in the non-stick, stainless steel and cast iron categories, several other pans tested also impressed. They were...</p>
<div> <div> <h3>4. Le Creuset 26cm cast iron frying pan with wood handle </h3> <p><a>£170, Amazon</a> </p> </div> </div>
<h3>5. Netherton Foundry 20cm spun iron frying pan</h3>
<p><a>£55.20, Netherton Foundry</a> </p>
<a>larger versions of the pan</a>, which, of course, are heavier, yet still lighter than the Solidteknics. 
<p>Like other iron pans, Netherton Foundry's spun iron pans should last a lifetime, and are induction- and oven-friendly. </p>
<div> <div> <p><a>Buy now </a></p> <h3>6. Circulon Ultimum 20cm frying pan</h3> <p><a>£38, John Lewis</a></p> </div> </div>
<p>In fact, the non-stick is so effective (at least on first use) you barely need to use oil or butter, even when frying bacon or sausages, making your breakfast a little healthier. </p>
<p>The specs say it's dishwasher-safe and you can use metal utensils, which would set it apart from other non-stick pans – though we're not sure we'd risk it. </p>
<p>A great value-for-money option. </p>
<h3>7. Tefal Expertise 24cm frying pan</h3>
<p><a>£42.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>But it's easy to use, and requires almost no oil for cooking veg or eggs. The non-stick is PFOA-free. Cleaning is simple, too, and you can use washing-up liquid.</p>
<p>As for downsides, the pan is oven-friendly but only to 175C, and only for an hour. I'm not sure I'd trust myself to keep within those guidelines. At 1.2kg, it's neither noticeably light nor heavy, but tossing isn't a problem. </p>
<h3>8. GreenPan Venice Pro 24cm ceramic non-stick frying pan</h3>
<p><a>£51.99, Amazon</a></p>
<a>even though we probably shouldn't</a>. 
<h3>Which type of frying pan is the best for me?</h3>
<p>Do you go iron, steel, or non-stick? We asked the experts for the virtues and vices of each...</p>
<h4>Iron frying pans </h4>
<a> cast iron griddle pan </a>for grilling meat and veggies," says Alexandra Dudley, author of sustainable eating cookbook 
<a>Le Creuset</a> one and was my grandmother's. It has never been washed with soap, only washed and oiled. I think this is the magic to good griddle flavour." 
<p>So, aside from durability (many come with lifetime warranties; our favourite, the Solidteknics, is covered for a "multi-century" life), and a special flavour developed from years of use, why go for iron?</p>
<p>Cast iron pans are great for gas hobs as they can withstand the high temperatures. They can also be bunged in the oven at full whack or used on barbecues. They are usually compatible with<a> induction hobs</a>, too.</p>
<h4>Non-stick frying pans </h4>
<a>has been linked to cancer</a>, which puts some people off, although it should be noted that the level of exposure is small. Tefal pans, one of the most recognisable on the high street, are PFOA-free, as are most of the better non-stick pans now.
<p>"Around 95pc of people want non-stick even cooking," Moran explains. "They're a staple pan." You can quickly and easily make your scrambled or fried eggs in the morning, sauté vegetables, or cook your whole fry up.</p>
<p>Additionally, you should never use a metal utensil, as this scratches the surface, ruining the non-stick and probably sending you back to the shop to buy another pan (as your warranty is unlikely to cover scratches).</p>
<h4>Stainless steel frying pans</h4>
<p>Why choose stainless steel? They're sturdy, durable, and cheaper than iron, for starters.. Stainless steel pans maintain their heat well, which results in even cooking. The iron in the steel makes them induction-compatible, too. </p>
<a>Leidenfrost effect</a> (cooking at an extremely precise temperature), "us mere mortals will find this very difficult, and will be faced with a pan of egg glue," Moran explains. 
<a>ProCook Elite Tri-Ply</a>, has an aluminium core.
<a>Le Creuset's range of steel pans</a>, which have an aluminium layer as well, are a little pricier but also designed to last.

<p>Life without the occasional steaming bowl of fresh pasta may not be worth living, and bragging rights are never more deserved than when you’ve rolled out the dough yourself. Plus, it tastes better than the dried stuff.</p>

<p>Electric pasta makers can make it easier to form more complex pasta shapes such as macaroni, and can be easier to disassemble and clean - but they're slightly more expensive, and can break more easily than a simple manual contraption. </p>

<header> <h1> The best knife sharpeners – and how to use them </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 16 February 2021 • 7:57pm </time> </div> </div>
<a>we're looking at you, Gordon</a>). Conversely, you might have seen cooks meticulously and methodically stroking their blade up and down a Japanese waterstone with more intricate attention to detail than a Flemish landscape painting. 
<p>Fear not, however, because it's not as complicated as it looks. In this review, we'll break down the most common techniques and advise on the best knife sharpeners to give your blade a shiny edge.</p>
<h5>Sharpening with a Japanese waterstone </h5>
<h3>King Kds 1000/6000 grit combination waterstone </h3>
<p><a>£46.50, Amazon</a></p>
<a>Blenheim Forge </a>in southeast London, recommended to me the very affordable
<a> King Kds 1000/6000</a> block, a combination waterstone that should sate your knife sharpening needs for under £40. And it'll take years before the block wears out. 
<div> <div> <p>STEP 1: Preparing your stone</p> </div> </div>
<p>STEP 2: Sharpening the blade</p>
<p>I found it tough to maintain the angle throughout the movement, often tilting upwards towards the end. This is a common error, according to Warner, and one that's fixed by just concentrating as hard as you can on maintaining that angle.</p>
<p>Step 3: Removing the burr</p>
<p>Step 4: Polishing the blade </p>
<p>Give your blade one more swipe on the leather, and you should have a perfectly sharp and polished knife that'll cut onions, tomatoes and all manner of squishy veg with no trouble at all. </p>
<h5>Pull-through sharpeners</h5>
<p>"For more sturdy, German- or French-style knives, you're not going to damage them that much," says Warner. </p>
<h3>Chantry knife sharpener </h3>
<p><a>£30, John Lewis </a></p>
<p>The concept is fairly simple. There are two V-shaped rotating steels, which you pull the knife through towards yourself, from the heel to the tip. I find that maybe 10 swipes is enough to leave my blades as sharp as when they arrived. </p>
<p>There's no denying the pull through isn't as romantic, meditative and precise as a waterstone. But for quickly sharpening (some kinds of) blades, you can't go too far wrong. </p>
<h3>AnySharp Knife Sharpener Pro</h3>
<p><a>£16.59, Amazon</a></p>
<p>It works swiftly, just three or four pull-throughs I found sufficient to resharpen knifes (it even works with serrated bread knives). However, it does create serrations on the blade, which isn't such a smooth sharpness as provided by a waterstone.</p>
<p>As it's so small, it's easy to store; it's incredibly light; and it comes with a 10-year warranty. Overall, not a bad piece of kit, and at a good price, too. </p>
<h3>MinoSharp Plus Shinkansen sharpener </h3>
<p><a>£35.49, Amazon </a></p>
<h3>ProCook Professional X50 sharpening steel</h3>
<p>Honing a blade is considerably different from sharpening one, though many of our drawers contain just a honing steel – often unhelpfully called a sharpening steel. </p>
<p>I found this model by <a>ProCook</a> to be sturdy thanks to its considerable weight (but don't worry, once you rest it on the table, it won't feel heavy). It also had a comfortable handle and, most importantly, it's not too expensive. </p>
<a>According to Tim Hayward</a>, author of
<a>Knife: The Cult, Craft and Culture of the Cook's Knife</a>, you should steer away from something called a diamond hone, which is the "death of good knives. It chews away the knife. To be avoided at all costs," Hayward warns.

<header> <h1> Meet Lewis A Kaplan: The judge overseeing the Prince Andrew case who has sent down mobsters and terrorists </h1> <p> The US judge’s punchy courtroom comments in the pre-trial hearings demonstrate his no-nonsense attitude </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Marcus Parekh <time> 5 January 2022 • 1:38pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>He is the man presiding over the civil case brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre against the Duke of York, one of the gravest threats the monarchy has faced in modern times. But who is US District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan?</p>
<p>The 77-year-old has a long and decorated career, taking charge of some of the US’s most famous cases involving New York mobsters and those held in Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p>He has overseen the civil case against the Duke since 2021, including ruling on his motion to dismiss the case.</p>
<p>Judge Kaplan appeared to deal the Duke of severe blow on Tuesday, saying that he is “not entitled” to bring up a settlement Ms Giuffre had with Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender.</p>
<p>That $500,000 (£370,000) deal was at the heart of the Duke’s bid to have the sexual abuse lawsuit against him thrown out.</p>
<p><a>In the lawsuit</a>, Ms Giuffre is suing the Duke for unspecified damages, alleging that he sexually assalted her on three separate occasions 21 years ago, when she was 17. The Duke denies all the allegations.</p>
<h2>The rise of the hometown boy</h2>
<p>Judge Kaplan is New York born and bred, raised in the borough of Staten Island.</p>
<p>In his 27 years on the court, he has overseen a litany of high-profile cases, including the trial of Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian-born member of Al-Qaeda who was <a>the first person from Guantanamo Bay</a> to receive a civilian trial.</p>
<p>Judge Kaplan sentenced Ghailani to life in prison for his role on the 1998 US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed more than 200 people.</p>
<a>his arrest in 2004</a>, paled in comparison to the suffering of those killed and injured in the dual bombings.
<p>The “horrific” nature of the attacks far outweighed “any and all considerations that have been advanced on behalf of the defendant” he said at the time.</p>
<h2>Mobsters in his sights</h2>
<p>Judge Kaplan has also overseen several notable trials involving members of New York’s organised crime rings.</p>
<p>In 2010, he presided over the case of 14 Gambino crime family members. The Gambino family are one of the Five Families that dominated organised crime in the city for much of the 20th and 21st centuries.</p>
<a>Ecuador win an historic judgment against Chevron</a>, the oil giant.
<p>Judge Kaplan repeatedly ruled in favour of <a>Chevron after an Ecuadorian court</a> ordered the company to pay nearly $10 billion in damages after a significant oil spill.</p>
<p>The 200 lawyers said that: “Judge Kaplan has been acting as a de facto lawyer for Chevron in this litigation.”</p>

<p>The move to scrap confirmatory PCR checks for people who test positive for Covid with a lateral flow has reignited the debate about which test is best.</p>
<p>Latest NHS Test and Trace figures from mid-December show that one in 10 lateral flow tests came back negative once checked by <a>PCR</a>. Under the new guidance, all those people would still be forced to self-isolate.</p>
<p>Experts argue that higher prevalence with omicron will mean fewer lateral flow positive tests are wrong.</p>
<a>lateral flow positives to be false</a>.
<p>However, statistician Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter estimates that fewer than two per cent of LFTs will be false positives based on the current prevalence of five per cent.</p>
<p>"The proposed changes seem very sensible," he added.</p>
<p>So what is the difference between lateral flow and PCR, and which should we trust? Here are the pros and cons of each.</p>
<p>The benefit lies in the speed, giving a result in under 30 minutes, rather than waiting up to 72 hours for the results of a PCR.</p>
<p>They are also useful at a population level for finding “hidden” carriers who may be transmitting the virus without knowing because they show no symptoms - an estimated one in three cases.</p>
<p>They also tend to throw up substantial numbers of false negatives, with around 28 per cent of symptomatic people wrongly told they do not have the virus and 42 per cent of asymptomatic carriers.</p>
<p>False positives are less likely, but currently in England the real-world false positive rate for LFTs is around 10 per cent when checked against PCR.</p>
<p>Although a small proportion of those confirmatory PCRs will be wrong - probably less than one per cent - scrapping the check will inevitably mean that some people will end up needlessly isolating.</p>
<p>Experts think the problem may grow less important as prevalence increases.</p>
<p>“There is really no need to confirm this with a PCR, a step that not only wastes time but costs a lot of money and uses up laboratory resources that could be better used elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Sometimes called “molecular photocopying”, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing works by looking for a small genetic fragment of a virus and then creating multiple copies.</p>
<p>A swab sample of blood, mucus or saliva is put into a machine with an enzyme called polymerase and dozens of cycles are run until about a billion copies of the genetic material are created.</p>
<p>The lower the number of cycles it takes to find the virus, the stronger the infection, and there is a cut-off threshold where the signal is considered too weak to be an active virus.</p>
<p>But the ability of PCR tests to pick up tiny amounts of virus – even from inactivated or “dead” samples – means a person can test positive long after infectiousness has ended.</p>
<p>Most people infected with coronavirus are contagious for four to eight days, with most transmission occurring two days before symptoms emerge and in the five days afterwards.</p>
<p>But a recent study in The Lancet Microbe found that people shed viral RNA (Ribonucleic acid) for around 17 days even without live virus in the body.</p>
<p>In one case, virus was still being shed 83 days after testing positive - a phenomenon dubbed the “long-tail” of RNA positivity by the testing community.</p>
<p>Recently, many people anecdotally have reported repeatedly testing negative by lateral flow only to test positive on a PCR, which may indicate that their infection, if it exists at all, is extremely low.</p>
<p>The Government has also recently changed swabbing guidance so that people no longer need to take a throat sample, which has lowered the detection rate of lateral flows compared to PCRs.</p>
<p>Getting rid of the confirmatory PCR test may also have other unintended consequences, such as making new variants more difficult to pick up and monitor, as lateral flows do not undergo genotyping and sequencing.</p>
<p>Prof Sheila Bird, former programme leader at the MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge, said: “There are two important down-sides if PCR-confirmation is not required.</p>
<p>“Firstly, there is a loss of information on both cycle-threshold value - which acts as proxy for viral load - and genomic variation - which tells us about new variants - as the PCR tests can analyse these whereas lateral flows do not.</p>
<p>So scrapping PCR checks will have benefits, but also consequences. Only time will tell if it will help or hinder the current staffing crisis.</p>

<h1> Folk, review: 'this wonderful play deserves to endure' </h1>
<p> This Hampstead production about folk song pioneer Cecil Sharp and the women who inspired him is a gripping tussle over England's soul </p>

<p>Nell Leyshon, a novelist as well as a playwright, hails from Somerset. And it’s to the Somerset village of Hambridge, circa 1903, that she wings us in a piece originally aired on Radio 3.</p>
<p>In Leyshon’s fictional spin on researched events, Lucy is the more suspicious of the two, while Louie initially shifts from shy taciturnity to trust, as she finds an enthusiast for the songs she imbibed from her newly deceased mother.</p>
<p>When the relative feebleness of Sharp’s own music and rapacity of his approach – publishing songs without consent, finessing and bowdlerising them too – becomes clearer, she withdraws into resentful recrimination. </p>
<p>Leyshon pulls off the considerable feat of showing us how indebted we are to Sharp, while suggesting that his under-sung helpers in the field had a more sophisticated sense of why the songs mattered. </p>
<p>Leyshon’s poetic way with words, the subtle modulations of Roxana Silbert’s scenically humble production and the superb, lived-in detail of the four actors hold us in thrall.</p>
