<h1> What’s really going on inside the Yorkshire Farm marriage? </h1>
<div> <div> By Katie Glass <time> 28 October 2021 • 8:05pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>So, what is really going on, on the farm?</p>
<p>When I asked Amanda what she wanted people to take from the show she said it was “not be scared of taking a bit of a leap of faith into the dark, challenging yourself”.</p>
<a>which Amanda claims mollycoddles children</a>. On Our Yorkshire Farm we watch her brood get stuck into the dangerous and cruel reality of farming: fixing tractors, rounding up herds in blizzards, skinning lambs and pulling dead ewes from rivers.
<p>He was immediately attracted to her: “This six-foot something woman knocked at the door – I was very taken with her. You couldn’t not be.” Four years later they married.</p>
<p>Yet, when I met them together, it was impossible not to notice how different they are. Clive is a camera-shy, monosyllabic Northerner; Amanda, a glamorous, outgoing, chatterbox, her bubbly exuberance matched only by his reticence.</p>
<p>While Amanda regularly travels for work – currently, a three-month nationwide theatre tour – Clive is such a home-body that when I met them he’d still never been to London.</p>
<p>Whatever happens next for the couple, no doubt we will all be watching.</p>

<p>The pandemic has taken a toll on many couples, but not all have been equally affected. </p>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, it doesn’t have to mean your relationship is doomed. Far from it. Here are some easy ways to reset it for the new year and get things back on track.</p>
<h2>Your partner isn’t a mind–reader</h2>
<p>We mustn’t expect our partners to be mind-readers. We need to be better at expressing what we feel and, if possible, why.</p>
<h2>Don’t turn to drink</h2>
<p>Try breathing in tandem or simply acknowledging that things are difficult and we’re all going to experience tough moments. If we create a strong enough bond, we can get through stormy times.</p>
<p>Don’t be tempted to distract yourself from your relationship problems, by drinking, for instance. This means you’re not addressing them and they will have no way of resolving.</p>
<h2>Give your partner a reason to want to sleep with you</h2>
<a>men are less willing to sacrifice sex</a> for intimacy.
<p>See yourself through your partner’s eyes: are you giving them a reason to want to sleep with you? Have you started neglecting yourself at home and assuming they’ll want you anyway, just because you’re there?</p>
<p>It’s worth both partners making the effort and seeing if anything changes. Often if you rekindle your sex life, other improvements follow. </p>

<p>In my first term as a trainee teacher, I was standing at the front of the classroom trying to prove to a year 7 class that 0.1 is bigger than 0.0999. Unannounced, in walked a deputy principal who stood at the back, glowering.</p>
<p>This took place at one of the most famously strict schools in the country. The rules at this school are innumerable and mostly about very small things, including the stipulation that no child can have a sip of water in a lesson without permission.</p>
<p>As a strip was torn off the boy, he looked as if he was going to cry. Had I been a younger trainee, rather than a 58-year-old, I might have cried, too, but as it was I felt furious.</p>
<p>What a stupid rule, I fumed. All that matters is that this boy understands decimals. If he wants some water, where’s the harm?</p>
<p>This is the latest in many such stories that pop up each time another school goes super-strict – and the outrage is always the same. We are teaching children to be robots! We don’t treat our pets like this!</p>
<p>When I had my first brush with strictness, I saw it like that, too. But having spent the past four years teaching under this unforgiving regime, I have largely changed my mind.</p>

<h3>The essential back to school checklist</h3>
<a>John Lewis</a> offer quality school uniform at competitive prices, and the latter have recently introduced more sustainable school wear made from materials such as Birla viscose, a soft biodegradable fibre. 
<p>Don’t forget to make a checklist of what your child might need for sports: again, it varies by school, but if your child has gone up a year or is starting secondary school they may need a different sports kit than before. </p>
<a>Decathlon</a> can’t be beaten – their own brand sportswear starts from £1.99, but they also stock well-known brands including adidas and ASICS (the
<a>Gel Excite trainers</a> above are £39.99) and gear for every sport from ballet to field hockey. 
<a>Sports Direct</a> for kids' trainers. At the moment, for instance, you can get a pair of Nike Revolution 5 running shoes for £30 (
<p>Traditional favourites <a>Startrite</a> and <a>Clarks</a> offer excellent quality and in-store fitting services. Again, for variety and value look to the high street: <a>Marks Spencer</a> stocks a wide selection. </p>
<a>£31.99, Amazon</a>), which comes in at least fifteen colourways every season and is roomy with padded straps.
<p>For younger children, Cath Kidston’s beautifully illustrated backpacks (<a>from £20</a>) will go down a treat, and you can currently get a free water bottle with each bag purchased. </p>
<h4>5. Lunch box and water bottle</h4>
<a>£7, Amazon</a>). The bento box style has moveable compartments for the different elements of your child’s lunch and a sealed pot for yoghurt or fruit. It’s also dishwasher safe. 
<a>£18 for a lunch bag</a>). Tinc – a brand that specialises in colourful, characterful accessories for children – offers larger-than-life lunch bags that will doubtless cheer up kids reluctant to go back to school (
<p>If your child is prone to losing things, perhaps an expensive water bottle isn’t the way to go, but if they’re a little older then an insulted Chillys bottle is the best of the best (<a>£20, Amazon</a>). </p>
<h3>The best back-to-school stationery</h3>
<a>£12.23, Amazon</a>). But if you are looking for a treat or some trendy extras, read on… 
<a>£9, Smiggle</a>) comes with letters your child can use to spell out their name on the front of the case. 
<a>£6</a>) and the Tinc scented sweetie highlighters (
<a>£2.80, John Lewis</a>) for the novelty factor. See also: metallic markers (
<a>£3, The Works</a>) and colourful gel pens (
<a>£14.99 for a pack of 14, Argos</a>). 
<h4>Pens and pencils </h4>
<a>the Works</a> is a great place to buy pens and pencils for the new term as they offer a huge (and inexpensive) range of stationery.
<a>A pack of 12 HB pencils</a> is just £1 and an
<a>8 pack of Zebra ballpoint pens</a> is just £2.
<a>WHSmith</a> stocks a good range of fountain pens for school, including an
<a>entry-level £3.99 model</a> and a range of LAMY fountain pens (
<a>£19.99, WHSmith</a>). 
<a>£13.99, John Lewis</a>), which includes the full spectrum of 24 rainbow shades. For budding artists, pick up a set of Derwent colouring pencils (
<h3>The best back-to-school books</h3>
<a>£6.99, Waterstones</a>). Collins’ ‘Easy Learning’ series is a fun, interactive way to help your child with the basics they’ll learn at primary school – there are books on numbers, times tables, handwriting and more
<a>(£1.20, Amazon</a>). 
<a>£59.99, Not On the High Street</a>). 
<h3>The best gadgets for kids</h3>
<a>tablet is damaging for children’s health</a>, there’s no doubt that they provide plenty of entertainment and can be useful for educational apps and games. The
<a>best tablet for kids</a> may well be the Fire HD 8 Kids tablet (
<a>£139.99, Amazon</a>). Designed especially with children in mind, it comes with a kid-proof case, parental controls and a year of AmazonKids+, which includes apps, games and videos.
<a>£699, Currys</a>) as the
<a>best laptop for students</a>. It has an impressive 10 hour battery life and offers the sleek look of an Apple Macbook for less.

<h5>Tips to refresh your school gate skill set</h5>
<li>Smile and say hello to people. It’s a simple but effective icebreaker and will help to prevent any shyness being read as stand-offishness.</li>
<li>Be the person who compliments another parent. Boosting someone else almost always has the effect of boosting you, too (plus, they are likely to love you for it)</li>
<li>Try to remember that many people are feeling just as self-conscious and awkward as you are.</li>
<li>Avoid the temptation to get drawn into gossip, even if it momentarily makes you feel like part of the gang.</li>
<li>Help out at the occasional event or fundraiser: it will help you to feel part of it, and it’s much easier and less threatening to get to know people when you’re actively working on something together.</li>
<li>Think about where others are in their school gate ‘journey’: they may have older children and established friendships from those year groups. Don’t take it personally.</li>
