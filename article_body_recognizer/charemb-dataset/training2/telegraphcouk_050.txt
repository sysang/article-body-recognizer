<p>Sir Kenneth Baker and Sir John Hayes, former education ministers, also called for schools to remain open and said the Government must make a "strong stand".</p>
<p>Robert Halfon, the chairman of the education select committee and a former education minister, said he would raise the issue of schools in the Commons on Tuesday when <a>MPs debate the new "Plan B" Covid regulations</a>.</p>
<p>Sir John agreed that Tuesday's Covid regulations should include an extra obligation <a>on schools</a> to remain open.</p>
<p>Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England, said: "Schools should always be the last to close and the first to open. I support any measures that help the school gates stay open to all pupils."</p>
<p>He added: "The vision has been there for the NHS with volunteer-run vaccine centres, so why can't it be done for education?"</p>
<p>He argued that, to ensure A-levels and GCSEs could go ahead next summer, officials at the Department for Education should hirie external venues such as town halls and stadiums.</p>
<p>The Government is also being urged to consider cutting the self-isolation period for children and teachers who test positive. </p>
<a>a "large surge" in omicron cases</a>. This could include shorter isolation periods for both children and teachers.
<p>On Friday night, Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, insisted the Government had no plans to close schools.</p>
<p>In Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister, said on Friday that further restrictions could not be ruled out but insisted she would "bust a gut" to keep schools open.</p>
<h2>Schools continue ‘unjustifiable’ closures</h2>
<p>Nine schools in Oxfordshire were partially closed this week, with entire year groups told to remain at home. Many cited "exceptional levels of staff sickness" and absence.</p>
<p>In Buckinghamshire, six schools were partially closed, with whole year groups forced to learn remotely. Among them was Dr Challoner's High School for Girls, in Amersham, which said Year 13 lessons had "regretfully been switched to remote learning".</p>
<p>Four schools in Norfolk closed their doors to pupils on Friday, with Watton Junior School saying teachers were "giving Zoom sessions where possible".</p>
<p>Molly Kingsley, a co-founder of parent campaign group UsForThem, said many schools were going above and beyond the Government's guidelines and asking close contacts to isolate as well as those who test positive for Covid.</p>
<p>"We have heard of lots of schools asking teachers to isolate because they are close contacts," she said, adding that this may be partly to blame for the number of staff shortages.</p>
<a>nativity plays should go ahead</a>. But Christmas parties and nativity plays have been cancelled by some schools, with some local authorities saying they should not go ahead.
<p>“We promise to explore all options to restage the show later in the school year when Covid transmission rates have again, hopefully, fallen."</p>

<p>The former head of Ofsted will return to teaching next month to help a school with high staff absences.</p>
<p>Sir Michael Wilshaw, the former chief inspector of schools in England, will teach history to pupils in a south London school in January to help a headteacher who is expecting more absences in the new year.</p>
<p>But school leaders have warned that the initiative is unlikely to happen quickly enough to help schools when they return in January – especially as retired teachers could be put off by rising <a>Covid-19</a> cases.</p>
<a>the first Covid-19 wave</a>, told Sky News that members of his family had previously advised him not to go back into the classroom, but he was glad that he had and felt it is “a moral imperative”.
<p>The Government is pleading with recently retired teachers, or those who trained as teachers and changed career, to “find even a day a week for the spring term to help protect face-to-face education”.</p>
<p>Mr Zahawi has said former teachers who are available to return should apply on the Get Into Teaching website and ideally start the process before Christmas Eve so they can join the workforce from January.</p>
<h2>Doubts over recruiting recently retired teachers</h2>
<p>“We also question whether ex-teachers will have much appetite for returning to classrooms given the high number of students who have tested positive in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“They may have been more encouraged had the Government's responses to providing schools with high-quality ventilation equipment and to urging students to test at home not been so lacklustre.”</p>
<h1> Bin collections cancelled across the UK as Government plans for Covid absences in public sector to rise by a quarter </h1>
<p> Shortage of lateral flow devices contributing to widespread disruption as hospital trust declares 'extreme and unprecedented' staff absences </p>
<div> <div> By Lizzie Roberts, Health Reporter and Lucy Fisher, Deputy Political Editor <time> 2 January 2022 • 7:37pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Bin collections have been cancelled across the country amid <a>staff shortages</a>, as the Government prepares for up to a quarter of public sector workers to be absent due to Covid.</p>
<p>Councils in Manchester, Essex, Somerset and Buckinghamshire have scaled back or suspended waste collections due to staff being off sick with Covid-19 or in isolation.</p>
<p>Chelmsford City Council said 23 members of staff are currently absent and have cancelled three days’ worth of food waste collections, while 1,000 recycling bins were not collected in North Somerset.</p>
<p>It comes after the Government asked public sector leaders to plan for a worst-case scenario of up to <a>a quarter of staff being absent</a> as coronavirus continues <a>to sweep across the country</a>.</p>
<p>Ed Argar, Minister for Health, said asking leaders to make contingency plans was “the responsible and sensible thing”.</p>
<p>However, he argued that clinical and scientific advice had urged against slashing self-isolation from seven days to five days to combat absences, as critics have demanded.</p>
<h2>Key workers front of queue</h2>
<a>gain preferential access to the tests</a>.
<p>It remains to be seen whether individuals will be required to provide proof of their profession, or whether access will be based on an honesty system.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Office said on Saturday that, so far, disruption caused by omicron had been controlled in “most parts of the public sector”.</p>
<p>But it said leaders had been asked to test plans against 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 25 per cent workforce absence rates.</p>
<p>It comes as the public continue to struggle to access rapid tests, exacerbating staff absences as they are unable to end isolation early without two negative tests.</p>
<p>New data revealed almost one in 10 NHS staff were absent on New Year's Eve, according to figures seen by The Sunday Times.</p>
<p>Jon Richards, UNISON assistant general secretary, said the Government must deliver more rapid tests and prioritise them for essential workers or risk a return of the “pingdemic” seen earlier this year.</p>
<p>A proportion of tests are already set aside for NHS staff and distributed through regional NHS teams. </p>
<p>More than a million rapid tests had been set aside since mid-December and further contingency plans have been put in place to allocate millions more, it is understood.</p>
<p>But public sector groups warned that, without making contingency plans for other key workers, “services may struggle to cope”.</p>
<p>“The Government must deliver kits in the large numbers needed and make sure key workers are at the front of the queue,” Mr Richards said.</p>
<p>In Tameside, Greater Manchester, green and black bin collections were delayed “due to increased numbers of staff being off sick with Covid”.</p>
<p>In Cheshire East, Covid staff sickness rates and HGV driver shortages had “heavily affected” crews and local contractor Ansa were forced to rearrange Christmas collection schedules.</p>
<p>While in Buckinghamshire, garden waste collections were suspended in Chiltern and Wycombe “due to a high level of sickness”, with rubbish, food and recycling prioritised.</p>
<p>An LGA spokesman said a recent survey of members found around half of councils had seen services disrupted due to staff absences.</p>
<h2>‘Extreme and unprecedented’</h2>
<p>On Sunday night, Lincolnshire United Hospitals declared a critical incident due to “extreme and unprecedented” staff shortages.</p>
<p>An internal memo said the shortages were resulting in “compromised care across our hospitals, and an inability to maintain a number of key pathways, including those around stroke and cardiac care”.</p>
<p>“The rapid increase in staff absence because of sickness is the largest factor in this deterioration in staffing levels, although reduced bank and agency fill is also a factor,” the memo, first reported by The Sunday Times, said.</p>
<p>The Trust confirmed to The Telegraph it was calling on staff to volunteer for extra hours to improve the situation over the next 72 hours.</p>
<p>A decision will now be made whether to stand down other services to allow staff to be deployed to urgent and emergency care over the next week, the memo said.</p>
<header> <h1> Rail chaos as staff absence forces wave of cancellations </h1> <p> Reduced Christmas and New Year timetables extended until at least January 10 for Southern, Great Northern and Thameslink trains </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matt Oliver ; Hannah Boland and Tom Rees <time> 30 December 2021 • 6:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Trains across Britain are being cancelled and timetables slimmed down as the omicron coronavirus variant sparks a surge in staff absences, wreaking havoc for millions of commuters.</p>
<p>Southern, Great Northern and Thameslink are to extend slimmed-down festive timetables until January 10 because of a shortage of workers.</p>
<p>There will be no direct Southern services to and from London Victoria, while the Gatwick Express train to the airport will also be out of action.</p>
<p>Instead, trains bound for the station - including those from Horsham, Hastings, Eastbourne, Littlehampton, Portsmouth and Southampton - will be sent to London Bridge.</p>
<p>It came as business groups warned that a million workers could soon be absent in a new "pingdemic", while pub companies and restaurants said they were already being forced to shut sites because of isolating employees.</p>
<p>In the rail industry, nearly one in ten workers are absent, according to a trade body. Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), the parent company of Southern, Great Northern and Thameslink, said the lack of manpower had left it with no choice but to act.</p>
<p>GTR said: “The changes are being made in response to the ongoing impact of Covid-19, which has led to significantly increased staff sickness in recent weeks, as seen right across the rail industry. </p>
<p>Angie Doll, the firm’s interim boss, added: “We’re really sorry if this does affect your journey.”</p>
<p>GTR is just the latest travel firm to warn of disruption due to coronavirus over the festive period.</p>
<p>British Airways was among the airlines hit by staff shortages before Christmas, while rail companies TransPennine Express, Avanti West Coast, LNER, Northern Rail, Greater Anglia and Scotrail have also scaled back their timetables.</p>
<p>The latest changes announced by GTR are likely to wreak further havoc on the travel plans of people travelling for New Year celebrations, as well as people returning home after extended Christmas breaks. </p>
<p>A full list of rail disruptions is available here for Southern and <a>Great Northern</a>, and by checking <a>National Rail Enquiries</a>.</p>
<p>As the disruption continued, there were growing fears for hospitality and retail firms, which business groups warned would be hit the hardest by the wave of absences. </p>
<p>Clive Watson, the chairman of City Pub Group, said he had already been forced to close almost a fifth of his company’s 46 pubs due to staff isolating. “It's a war zone out there.” </p>
<p>Patrick Dardis, the chief executive of Young's, said his firm was also finding it a struggle to keep pubs staffed.</p>
<p>It has prompted calls for the Government to cut the minimum period of isolation people who test positive for Covid from seven to five days, providing they produce two negative lateral flow tests. This has already been done in the US.</p>
<p>The Federation of Small Businesses said the change was needed to “avert another ‘pingdemic’”.</p>
<p>Craig Beaumont of the FSB added: “We are now well on our way to 1m people sick with Covid or self-isolating. This will worsen in the new year as people return from Christmas.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ikea became the latest to raise prices because of Covid disruption, which it said was "impacting industries all over the world" and adding to costs. </p>
<header> <div> <div> <h1> All adults told to get booster jab by New Year to protect 'our freedoms', announces Boris Johnson </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<li>Omicron cases now found in hospital, reveals minister</li>
<li>All Covid contacts to take daily lateral flow tests</li>
<li>Covid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you</li>
<p>Boris Johnson has launched an "emergency" Covid booster campaign to try to head off a "tidal wave" of cases of the omicron variant and avoid the risk of a New Year lockdown.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister unveiled a plan called "Get Boosted Now" to offer a <a>Covid booster jab </a>to every eligible adult by the end of the month - four weeks earlier than planned.</p>
<p>To hit this target No 10 said the National Health Service would have to offer jabs to 18 million people at a rate of around one million a day.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said that the huge effort - which will see the Army divide the country into regions - was necessary to preserve the country's hard-won freedoms from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>In what Mr Johnson described as the "omicron emergency boost" programme, the Prime Minister said: "No one should be in any doubt: there is a tidal wave of omicron coming. </p>
<p>"And I’m afraid it is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need."</p>
<p>The new national emergency effort was required to protect Britons from the new omicron Covid-19 variant and stop the need for more lockdown-type restrictions next month, he said.</p>
<p>Doctors and nurses will be transferred from non-urgent work in hospitals to assist with the booster programme.</p>
<p>The Army was assisting with 42 military planning teams across every region in England to help with "standing up additional vaccine sites and mobile units".</p>
<p>He said that clinics would be "extending opening hours so clinics are open seven days a week, with more appointments early in the morning, in the evening, and at weekends".</p>
<p>Mr Johnson ended his televised address from 10 Downing Street explicitly linking future freedoms with receiving a Covid-19 booster.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said: "Get boosted now for yourself, for your friends and your family; get boosted now to protect jobs and livelihoods across this country; get boosted now to protect our NHS, our freedoms and our way of life."</p>
<p> A booster for every British adult by the end of 2021: That is the ambitious target set out by Boris Johnson on Sunday night in the wake of the omicron variant.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister warned of a "tidal wave" of infections in the coming weeks as he confirmed boosters will be open to all over-18s from Wednesday, at the expense of some non-urgent hospital work.</p>
<p>"Don't make the mistake of thinking omicron can't hurt you," Mr Johnson said, as he referred to data showing that two doses of a vaccine are significantly less effective against preventing infection than a course of three doses.</p>
<p>"Get boosted now for yourself, for your friends and your family; get boosted now to protect jobs and livelihoods across this country; get boosted now to protect our NHS, our freedoms and our way of life."</p>
<h3>South African president tests positive for Covid</h3>
<p>South African president Cyril Ramaphosa has tested positive for Covid, writes Peta Thornycroft.</p>
<p>According to the presidency, Mr Ramaphosa started feeling unwell after today’s memorial service in Cape Town for South Africa’s last white president, FW de Klerk, who died last month.</p>
<h3>NHS website hit by technical difficulties amid rush to book boosters</h3>
<p>The NHS website which allows Britons to book their booster jabs experienced technical difficulties as soon as the Prime Minister gave his address this evening.</p>
<p>Boris Johnson urged people to book their third vaccine as soon as they were eligible to do so. Those eligibility criteria will widen to include all over-18s from Wednesday onward.</p>
<p>A statement on the website said: "The NHS website is currently experiencing technical difficulties. We are working to resolve these issues. Thank you for your patience."</p>
<h3>Vulnerable children risk falling into crime ‘if schools do not reopen in January’ </h3>
<p>Further school closures will result in thousands of vulnerable children slipping through the net and being drawn into violent crime, drug dealing and sex abuse, campaigners have warned.</p>
<p>There is growing concern that the anticipated spike in Covid-19 numbers will result in schools being closed once again and children being home schooled.</p>
<p>However, child welfare campaigners and the police have warned that doing so will once again expose children to a whole range of hidden dangers such as crime, domestic abuse and sexual exploitation.</p>

<h3>Unvaccinated workers must come clean to employers under new Covid rules </h3>
<p>Unvaccinated workers will have to declare their vaccination status to their bosses for the first time, as new rules mean they cannot test themselves daily to avoid self-isolation.</p>
<p>All close contacts of Covid cases must take lateral flow tests for seven days to avoid quarantine under measures that come into place on Tuesday in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>However, adults who have not been vaccinated with two doses must still self-isolate for 10 days if they are identified as a close contact of someone who has the virus.</p>
<p>This could lead to employees in offices and factories being “shamed” when they have to disclose that they have chosen not to have a vaccine.</p>
<p>The testing and isolation rules will apply regardless of whether the case is the omicron variant or the delta variant.</p>
<h3>'Two doses is not enough'</h3>
<p>There are new advertisement posters to accompany the NHS and Government's joint Get Boosted Now campaign.</p>
<p>"Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid-19 booster vaccine, because two doses of the vaccine is not enough to give the level of protection against infection we all need."</p>
<p>Here's Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, doing his bit to spread the word after the Prime Minister's speech tonight.</p>
<h3>More from Sir Keir Starmer</h3>
<p>"I urge everyone to get boosted as soon as you can," the Labour leader has said.</p>
<p>"So much has been asked of the British people time and again you have risen to the challenge. So let's keep our foot on the pedal- get Britain boosted to protect our families, friends and NHS."</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>8:21PM</time></a> <div> <h3>Get Boosted Now: How the new drive will raise the vaccine bar</h3> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>'More important than ever to get Britain boosted'</h3>
<p>Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the Labour, has said it is "more important than ever to get Britain boosted" to protect the NHS and save lives.</p>
<p>"The arrival of the new worrying variant is a reminder that the pandemic is not over and vaccines are the best weapon in our fight," Sir Keir said.</p>
<p>"The vaccine is safe and effective, it protects us and those around us. We will always support the NHS and act in the public interest.</p>
<p>"We've come so far since those darkest of days at the start of the pandemic."</p>
<h3>'Get boosted now': Boris Johnson's plea to the nation</h3>
<h3>'Do not make the mistake of thinking omicron can't hurt you'</h3>
<p>"Do not make the mistake of thinking omicron can't hurt you, can't make you and your loved ones seriously ill," Boris Johnson says, highlighting that hospital admissions in South Africa have doubled within a week.</p>
<p>"The NHS Booking System will be open for these younger age groups from Wednesday, and that’s the best way to guarantee your slot, but in some places you can walk in from tomorrow," he adds.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also confirms that there will be 42 military planning teams deployed across every region, additional opening hours so clinics are open second days a week, and additional vaccine sites and mobile units</p>
<p>He says it is because of the omicron variant that the Government pivoted to its Plan B measures earlier in the week, including Covid certification for large events and mask mandates plus a return to working from home.</p>
<h3>Boosters for all adults by New Year confirmed by Boris Johnson</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson confirms the launch of the Omicron Emergency Boost, "a national mission unlike anything we have done before in the vaccination programme".</p>
<p>He confirms that everybody aged 18 and over will have the chance to get their booster before the New Year, bringing the previous target of boosting all adults by the end of January forward by an entire month.</p>
<p>Bookings for those groups will open on Wednesday, he confirms.</p>
<p>"This will require an extraordinary effort. And as we focus on boosters and make this new target achievable, it will mean some other appointments will need to be postponed until the New Year," he says.</p>
<p>"But if we don’t do this now, the wave of Omicron could be so big that cancellations and disruptions, like the loss of cancer appointments, would be even greater next year."</p>
<h3>'Tidal wave' of omicron on its way, warns Boris Johnson</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson says that over the past year vaccination has proven "the key to beating Covid".</p>
<p>But he warns of a "tidal wave" of omicron, which is more resistant to vaccines and says from "bitter experience" the situation could deteriorate rapidly.</p>
<p>"No-one should be in any doubt: there is a tidal wave of Omicron coming, and I’m afraid it is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need," he says.</p>
<p>"But the good news is that our scientists are confident that with a third dose – a booster dose - we can all bring our level of protection back up."</p>

<h3>Covid alert levels explained: What Level 4 means for you </h3>
<p>The UK Covid alert level has been raised following a rapid increase in omicron cases being recorded.</p>
<p>The country's four chief medical officers and NHS England's national medical director have recommended to ministers that the UK go up to Level 4 from Level 3.</p>
<p>It comes as Boris Johnson prepares to address the nation at 8pm about the booster vaccine programme.</p>
<p>The message - that will not see new restrictions announced - will be pre-recorded.</p>
<p>Jessica Carpani has more here</p>
<h3>Alert Level 4: The full joint statement</h3>
<p>Here is what the UK's four chief medical officers and Stephen Powis, the NHS England national medical director, have said about this evening's move to Alert Level 4:</p>
<p>Transmission of Covid-19 is already high in the community, mainly still driven by delta, but the emergence of omicron adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services.</p>
<p>The NHS is currently under pressure mainly driven by non-Covid pressures. With a variant spreading with increased transmissibility and reduced vaccine effectiveness, we are likely to see this pressure rise soon.</p>
<p>It is extremely important that if you are eligible, you get your Covid vaccination now – whether this be your first, second or booster dose.</p>
<p>People should continue take sensible precautions including ventilating rooms, using face coverings, testing regularly and isolating when symptomatic. </p>
<h3>Covid boosters for over-30s as 'race' to limit omicron stepped up before Christmas </h3>
<p>Covid booster jabs will be offered to 30-year-olds from Monday as the Government launches a desperate dash to jab “as many people as possible” before Christmas.</p>
<p>In a massive push to protect millions more people in the face of the new omicron variant the NHS has announced the booster will be available to everyone aged 30 to 39 three months after their second dose.</p>
<p>More age groups are expected to be included in the coming weeks, with ministers determined to “massively expedite” the booster roll out.</p>
<p>The Telegraph understands that several billion more pounds is to be poured into expanding the roll-out.</p>

<h3>Tenfold increase in patients waiting over eight hours to be transferred from ambulance to AE </h3>
<p>The number of patients waiting more than eight hours to be handed over from an ambulance to AE has increased almost tenfold this year compared to pre-pandemic.</p>
<p>Some 218 patients waited eight hours or more outside English hospitals in 2021, compared to just 23 patients in 2019, information obtained by The Telegraph, through Freedom of Information requests, reveals.</p>

<h3>'British politics has turned into a toxic spectator sport with no winners'</h3>
<p>Earlier this week the front pages blazed out images of the weeping Allegra Stratton, made to carry the can for Number 10.</p>
<p>When the footage was leaked showing her laughing with others at Number 10 over how to answer certain questions it was especially ugly because so many people in the media and politics had worked with Stratton, yet helped speed this cycle along.</p>
<h3>Christmas survival guide: What the new Covid data means for your holiday plans </h3>
<p>A paper published by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in August warned there was a “realistic possibility” of a nasty new variant coming along and so it has unfortunately proved.</p>
<p>If you are suffering a feeling of Déjà vu, take heart from the fact you are not alone. This very much feels like December 2020 and the rise of the “Kent” or alpha variant all over again.</p>
<p>Of course, the big difference this time around is that this time most of us are vaccinated - and that creates some cause for optimism.</p>

<h3>What is the UK Covid Alert Level system?</h3>
<p>The UK Covid Alert Level system was introduced by ministers in May 2020 as the nation took its first tentative steps out of lockdown. The levels are as follows:</p>
<li>Level 5: As Level 4, and there is a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed</li>
<li>Level 4: A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation; transmission is high or rising exponentially</li>
<li>Level 3: A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation</li>
<li>Level 2: Covid-19 is present in the UK, but the number of cases and transmission is low</li>
<li>Level 1: Covid-19 is not known to be present in the UK</li>
<div> <a><time>5:13PM</time></a> <div> <h3>PM to address Britons at 8pm</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Boris Johnson is to address the nation at 8pm in a pre-recorded message, providing an update on the booster campaign.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Israel imposing Britain travel ban over spread of omicron</h3>
<p>Israel has announced that it is adding the UK to its "red list" of countries that residents are banned from visiting amid its concern over the spread of omicron.</p>
<p>The measures will be in place from Wednesday, and a senior Israeli health official confirmed the ban would also apply to Denmark and Belgium.</p>
<h3>UK Covid Alert Level increases</h3>
<p>The UK's Covid Alert Level has been increased from Level 3 to Level 4 after the emergence of the omicron variant.</p>
<p>Level 4 means that the epidemic "is in general circulation; transmission is high and direct COVID-19 pressure on healthcare services is widespread and substantial or rising".</p>
<p>Level 3 had meant the epidemic was in general circulation, but with no mention of pressure on health services.</p>
<h3>Scottish Tory leader struggles to defend Boris Johnson over Covid lockdown quiz </h3>
<p>Speaking on BBC Scotland’s The Sunday Show, he was asked four times to list one of the Prime Minister’s attributes, but failed to do so.</p>
<p>After being asked for a fourth time, Mr Ross replied: “Obviously, good enough qualities to have an 80-seat majority, but that 80-seat majority does not allow you to do whatever you want with your officials in Number 10.”</p>
<h3>48,854 new Covid cases and 52 deaths confirmed</h3>
<div> <p>A total of 48,854 new cases of coronavirus have been confirmed by the Department for Health.</p> <p>Infections have risen by 11.9 per cent week-on-week. A further 52 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also confirmed.</p> </div>
<h3>Covid cases alone are not an accurate measure of NHS pressure, says health chief</h3>
<p>Coronavirus cases alone are not representative of the overall pressures on the health service at a time when it is "busier than ever", the executive of NHS Providers has said.</p>
<p>Chris Hopson observed a "universal" pattern of pressure across the entire health and social care system, adding that while the NHS currently has a lower Covid caseload it is experiencing "more extended and universal pressure".</p>
<p>"The January 2021 Covid peak was significantly dealt with by delaying elective activity we can no longer afford to delay. The January peak was really tough but came and went relatively quickly. This is pressure for months on end."</p>
<h3>1,239 further omicron cases confirmed</h3>
<p>A further 1,239 sequenced cases of the omicron variant have been confirmed by the UK Health Security Agency.</p>
<p>This represents a day-on-day increase of 65 per cent. There are now 3,137 confirmed cases of omicron. </p>
<p>The Department for Health today predicted that omicron will become dominant by the middle of this month. Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, had previously said it would become dominant by the end of December.</p>
<h3>Under 'Plan B' omicron could lead to 75,000 Covid deaths in five months </h3>
<p>The omicron variant could cause more hospitalisations and deaths than were recorded at the peak of last winter’s Covid second wave unless restrictions are tightened further, new modelling suggests.</p>
<p>However, the most pessimistic scenario projects peak admissions of twice as high as last January, when hospitalisations were just over 3,000.</p>
<p>The projections also suggested there could be anywhere between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths over the next five months.</p>

<h3>Boris Johnson broke no lockdown rules with Zoom quiz, insists minister </h3>
<p>Boris Johnson broke no rules after a picture emerged of him taking part in an online Downing Street quiz flanked by colleagues, a minister has insisted.</p>
<p>The image, reported by the Sunday Mirror, showed a screen with the Prime Minister sitting in front of a laptop in the No 10 library, while one of his colleagues is draped in tinsel.</p>
<p>The event happened on December 15, the Sunday Mirror reported. Downing Street said the Conservative Party leader had "briefly" taken part "virtually" in the quiz.</p>
<p>The festive event is said to have taken place only three days before an alleged Christmas party in No 10, which is currently being investigated by Cabinet Secretary Simon Case.</p>

<h3>Breaking: New record set for booster vaccines</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>A new daily record has been set for booster vaccines, with 530,086 jabs administered across the UK yesterday.</p> <p>It puts the daily average for booster vaccinations above 400,000 for the first time.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Some 483,361 of these were in England, while 40,144 doses were given in Scotland and 6,581 in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>The previous record was set on Friday, December 3 when 448,975 vaccines were given out.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>All Covid contacts told to test daily from Tuesday</h3>
<p>All coronavirus contacts will be told to take new daily lateral flow tests from Tuesday in new measures to try and curb the UK's rising caseload.</p>
<p>Anyone who is identified as a contact of someone with coronavirus must test themselves for the next seven days, regardless of whether it is the omicron or delta variant.</p>
<p>Unvaccinated adults must still self-isolate for 10 days if they come into contact with someone who has the virus.</p>
<p>Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, said: “We are taking this proportionate and more practical measure to limit the impact on people’s day to day lives while helping to reduce the spread of Omicron.</p>
<p>“Vaccines remain our best defence and I urge anyone yet to get a first and second jab to come forward and those eligible for a booster to get boosted as soon as possible.”</p>
<h3>French fishermen plan to ruin Christmas for millions of Britons with blockade </h3>
<p>French trawlermen are drawing up plans to ruin Christmas for millions of Britons by blockading Calais and other key ports in response to the resolution of the post-Brexit dispute over fishing licences.</p>
<p>Industry sources told the Telegraph on Sunday that they will attempt to snare up cross-Channel trade over the festival period because many of their colleagues were refused permits to operate in Britain’s waters.</p>
<p>“We have made it clear: protests are planned, following on from the blockade of Breton and Norman ports that took place on November 26,” said Oliver Lepretre, head of the Hauts-de-France regional fisheries committee.</p>
<p>“Actions will target the import of British products. French fishermen are more than ever united against adversity and don’t intend to take it lying down faced with so much bad faith.”</p>

<h3>Johnson's authority on vaccine passports 'really eroded' among backbenchers</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson's former director of legislative affairs has said his political capital on the issue of vaccine passports has been "really eroded".</p>
<p>Nikki da Costa, who worked at Number 10 until a couple of months ago, told Times Radio: “In addition to what we’ve talked before about rebelliousness in general, on this particular policy, capital has really been eroded.</p>
<p>Ms da Costa suggested the Government had been "prudent" in not pursuing a mandatory vaccination policy.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson has been accused of presiding over a "culture of disregard for the rules" after a picture emerged of him taking part in an online Downing Street quiz flanked by colleagues.</p>
<p>The image, reported by the Sunday Mirror, shows a screen with the Prime Minister sitting in front of a laptop in the No 10 library.</p>
<p>One of his colleagues is draped in tinsel. Downing Street said the Conservative Party leader had "briefly" taken part "virtually" in the quiz.</p>

<p>The leader of the Scottish Tories has refused four times to name a single one of Boris Johnson's attributes, as he told of his "anger" at Number 10 over Downing Street parties, writes Daniel Sanderson.</p>
<p>Douglas Ross was pressed repeatedly to name one of his party leader's "qualities", but the senior Conservative failed to do so, instead answering by describing him as the "Prime Minister" and the "leader of the main party in the United Kingdom".</p>
<h3>I'm immensely frustrated by vaccine passports, says MP who shouted 'resign' at Javid</h3>
<p>Will Wragg, the Conservative MP for Hazel Grove who shouted "resign" at Sajid Javid in the Commons this week over vaccine passports, has expressed his "immense frustration" at the policy.</p>
<p>"What I think is the wrong route for us to take is this coercive work which will not yield the results the Government hopes for," he said on Times Radio this morning.</p>
<p>He added that his demand for Mr Javid's resignation was shouted "in the heat of the moment".</p>
<p>He went on to accuse Nadine Dorries, the Culture Secretary, of pursuing an "unwanted conversation" with him in the Commons tearoom about unvaccinated hospital patients after sending a late-night tweet about a "haranguing" earlier in the week.</p>

<h3>Boris Johnson faces Cabinet revolt over Covid rules </h3>
<p>Boris Johnson is facing his first major cabinet revolt, with senior ministers pledging to “resist” a “Plan C” of further Covid-19 restrictions, the Telegraph can disclose.</p>
<p>A Cabinet source warned that, in the absence of data showing the impact of omicron on hospitalisation and death rates, a series of concerned members of Boris Johnson’s top team will block the “slippery slope” of further curbs.</p>
<p>At least six cabinet members are understood to have concerns about the Government’s movement towards more draconian measures.</p>
<p>Edward Malnick has the full story here</p>
<h3>'Everything under review' including Plan C - but protect the economy too, says Zahawi</h3>
<p>Asked about speculative raft of tougher 'Plan C' measures, Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary and former vaccines minister, said: "We have to keep everything under review."</p>
<p>He told Times Radio that the priority should be the booster campaign as part of a "national endeavour, especially the most vulnerable but all adults who are eligible".</p>
<p>On large gatherings, which the Scottish Government and World Health Organisation are advising people to stay away from, Mr Zahawi called for a "proportionate approach".</p>
<p>"If you’re double vaccinated it does protect you against severe infection," he said. If you have had a lateral flow test and you’re negative, that is also a great protection against the spread of omicron in that particular gathering.</p>
<p>"Let’s be proportionate about this, let’s protect people, deal with omicron but let’s protect the economy as well.”</p>
<h3>Boris Johnson has lost his authority, says Sir Keir Starmer</h3>
<p>Boris Johnson has lost his authority in the wake of recent reports around Christmas parties and social occasions in Downing Street, Sir Keir Starmer has said.</p>
<p>Sir Keir insisted in an interview with the Andrew Marr Show that Labour will support the Government's Plan B measures in the Commons on Tuesday to "provide the leadership that the Prime Minister can't".</p>
<p>The Labour leader said: "This is very important because he’s damaged his authority, he’s now so weak his party is so divided. He’s the worst possible leader at the worst possible time.</p>
<p>"He has so damaged his authority that without Labour votes on Tuesday he is unable to discharge the basic function of Government, keeping the public safe.”</p>
<p>Sir Keir said Labour was against mandatory vaccination measures, although there "may be a case in the NHS", while he said negative tests were "important, if not more important" than vaccination status with regards to attending mass events.</p>
<h3>No guarantee all schools will be open in January</h3>
<p>The Education Secretary could not confirm this morning that all schools would be open everywhere in January.</p>
<p>Nadhim Zahawi told the Andrew Marr Show: "We are absolutely working to make sure that all schools are open, that they're protected.</p>
<p>"I will do everything in my power. We are still learning about this variant. We know that a booster works. Get boosted, protect yourself, protect your community and let's get through this and transition this from pandemic to endemic."</p>
<p>Asked about whether masks would be introduced in classrooms, Mr Zahawi pledged to keep the measure "under review" but said he had correspondence from MPs and the National Deaf Society "that it does impede learning in the classroom".</p>
<h3>'Save the soul' of the Conservative Party</h3>
<p>Steve Baker has called on Boris Johnson to "save the soul of the Conservative Party" as he plans to relaunch his Conservative Way Forward group in the New Year.</p>
<p>Mr Baker said ministers must pivot to dealing with the pandemic by "counting the cost of remote bans and restrictions... rather than having this endless tunnel vision just on the disease. We actually can't go on like this."</p>
<p>In an interview with Sky News, Mr Baker predicted at least 60 Tory MPs would actively vote against the Government's vaccine certification measures in the Commons on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Now that we're vaccinated, what kind of society we want to live in? In the future I want one which is free, which is prosperous, which is joyful in which young people can have a hope of a better future."</p>
<h3>Partygate: 'I think people can make their own minds up'</h3>
<p>Nadhim Zahawi used his broadcast round this morning to defend Boris Johnson after a picture emerged of him taking part in an online Downing Street quiz surrounded by colleagues.</p>
<p>Labour criticised the Prime Minister over the reported event, which the Sunday Mirror claims happened on December 15. Downing Street said the Conservative Party leader had "briefly" taken part "virtually" in the quiz.</p>
<p>"Ten or 15 minutes to thank his team, who were working all hours, on a screen in a virtual pub quiz. I think people can make their own minds up.”</p>
<h3>Omicron cases now found in hospital, reveals Education Secretary</h3>
<p>Omicron cases have now been found in hospital, a minister has revealed, as he said the UK is in a "race" against the variant to give out as many booster jabs as possible.</p>
<p>Nadhim Zahawi, the Education Secretary, warned of the danger of tens of thousands of hospitalisations with omicron even if it were to prove "half as severe" as delta because it is so infectious.</p>
<p>"I can confirm to you this morning [there are] cases in hospital with omicron," Mr Zahawi told Sky News. "We've been able to test people who are in hospital over the past two weeks, and there is a lag to hospitalisation.</p>

<h1> We’ll pop any Covid bubbles that schools impose unnecessarily, vows minister </h1>
<p> Regional commissioners will be monitoring any curbs placed on children’s learning and ‘phoning up’ to ask why, says Nick Gibb </p>
<div> <div> By Ewan Somerville <time> 8 September 2021 • 10:03am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Head teachers who try to reintroduce bubbles for pupils will face intervention from commissioners, the schools minister has warned.</p>
<p>Nick Gibb said England’s eight regional school commissioners would be monitoring any cases of children being placed back into bubble systems and <a>“phoning up” to ask why</a>.</p>
<p>Pressed on schools defying government guidance on Covid-19 measures as millions of pupils return to class in England this week, he said there was “no real reason for schools to maintain the bubble arrangements”.</p>
<p>“Our <a>recommendations are very clear</a> that bubbles are not required in schools,” he told MPs. </p>
<p>“The regional school commissioners will be phoning up to make sure the schools are not, for example, closing unnecessarily or sending too many children home.”</p>
<p>The Telegraph reported on Tuesday how parents have accused schools of imposing “nonsensical” curbs at the start of term, including face masks, bubbles and self-isolation of healthy children. </p>
<p>This is despite government guidance saying pupils should be off school only if they test positive for Covid or are showing symptoms. Whole year groups were sent home last term if only one child in their “bubble” tested positive. </p>
<p>It comes as Ofqual confirmed that work was “quite advanced” on contingency plans, to be set out this autumn, should the “unthinkable” happen where <a>GCSE and A-level exams are cancelled</a> for a third year in a row. </p>
<p>Ian Bauckham, the interim chairman of England’s exam regulator, said final plans for 2022 assessments would be released next month, adding there was a risk of “baking in the significant rise in high grades”.</p>
<p>Mr Gibb said he “hoped” exams would not be cancelled again and defended record levels of grade inflation. </p>
<p>“We want the 2022 cohort to be treated as fairly compared with subsequent cohorts and past cohorts in 2020 and 2021,” he added. </p>
<p>The DfE and Ofqual unveiled proposals in July for exams next summer, which includes giving pupils in England advance notice on the focus of exam papers.</p>
<header> <h1> Rise in workers requesting sick notes ahead of return to offices </h1> <p> Stress, anxiety and depression among main illnesses cited as employees face prospect of an end to remote working from July 19 </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 9 July 2021 • 6:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Workers are increasingly requesting sick notes as the return to offices looms, figures from a private doctor service have suggested.</p>
<p>Gogodoc, an on-demand GP service, saw requests for absence notes rise by 78 per cent from 83 to 148 between April and May. This compares with up to 25 requests per month before 2021, when the prospect of returning to work was far more remote.</p>
<p>Stress, anxiety and depression were among the main illnesses cited.</p>
<p>The findings come as many employees prepare to abandon remote working and <a>return to offices</a> when Covid restrictions <a>lift on July 19</a>.</p>
<p>Mental health experts have said stress-related disorders related to the workplace were surging in what they described as a "MeToo moment".</p>
<p>The mental health charity Mind said remote working, combined with nerves over restrictions easing, could be contributing to the rise in sick notes.</p>
<p>"Many people with pre-existing mental health problems are reporting a worsening in the severity of their symptoms, with some feeling anxious about the prospect of restrictions easing," said Emma Mamo, a Mind representative.</p>
<p>"Therefore it's not surprising that there has been an increase in demand for GP sick notes from employees experiencing issues like stress, anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>"It is likely that factors like longer working hours, a lack of work/life balance and managers being less able to identify and support staff experiencing mental health issues due to remote working could also be playing a role."</p>
<p>Although anxiety appears to be peaking ahead of employees' return to workplaces, it has been higher in general since the pandemic struck, figures suggest.</p>
<p>The number of sick notes issued by doctors for mental health reasons rose from 36 per cent to 42 per cent in the year to May 2020, according to an analysis by NTT Data UK.</p>
<p>Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC union, added: "Stress is preventable if staff have reasonable workloads, supportive managers and a workplace free from safety concerns, violence, bullying and harassment."</p>

<header> <h1> Novak Djokovic refused entry to Australia as visa cancelled amid Covid vaccine row </h1> <p> World No 1 forced to fly home and could miss Australian Open following outcry over his 'medical exemption' </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Ben Rumsby <time> 6 January 2022 • 4:29am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Novak Djokovic has been dramatically refused entry to Australia, potentially wrecking his defence of his Australian Open crown <a>barely 24 hours after it looked to have been rescued.</a></p>
<a> major diplomatic incident,</a> Djokovic was told he was being deported after he was detained at Melbourne Airport amid claims he had attempted to enter the country using invalid documents following a mix-up with his visa.
<a>has said he is "opposed" to vaccines</a>. 
<p>Australian court documents show Djokovic's injunction request against his visa cancellation has been listed for a hearing at 4pm local time (5am GMT) in the Federal Circuit and Family Court.</p>
<p>In a statement, Australian Border Force said: "Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently cancelled.</p>
<p>"Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry or who have had their visa cancelled will be detained and removed from Australia."</p>
<p>Djokovic was taken to a government detention hotel on Thursday but while his lawyers appeal the visa decision the next movements of the world's best male tennis player remains unclear. The Australian Open begins on January 17.</p>
<p>He is staying at the Park Hotel in Melbourne, which is also used by the Australian Government to detain refugees.</p>
<p>Australian prime minister Scott Morrison said that Djokovic had failed to provide sufficient proof to receive a medical exemption to enter the country and insisted that the Serb was not "singled out" for scrutiny over his visa cancellation.</p>
<p>He said: "Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders". </p>
<p>"In line with all standards of international public law, Serbia will fight for Novak Djokovic, justice and truth."</p>
<h2>Tennis star detained for hours</h2>
<p>Srdjan also told Australian breakfast show Sunrise: “They are holding my son captive. If they don’t release him in the next half an hour, we will fight them on the street.”</p>
<p>The Serbian was detained for hours upon arrival, with each passing minute appearing to increase the likelihood he would be thrown out of the country and denied the chance to go for a record 21st Grand Slam. </p>
<p>There was mounting speculation that the basis for Djokovic’s exemption was a rule designed to apply to those to have recovered from Covid-19 in the previous six months rather than one covering those with underlying health issues.</p>
<p>Tennis legend Rod Laver told the Herald Sun it would be in Djokovic’s “best interests to own up” about the criteria used in his case, adding: “If he’s got a reason for [the exemption] then ... we should know it.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Australian papers reacted with fury:</p>
<p>“We’ve always been clear on two points: visa approvals are a matter for the Federal Government, and medical exemptions are a matter for doctors.”</p>
<p>The Association of Tennis Professionals said last week that 95 of the world’s top 100 had been vaccinated against Covid. But Djokovic appears to be an exception. </p>
<h2>Anger at Djokovic's exemption</h2>
<p>In a statement titled “Australia’s border rules apply to everyone”, Andrews said: “Any individual seeking to enter Australia must comply with our strict border requirements.</p>
<p>“While the Victorian Government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth Government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border.</p>
<p>“Since Dec 15 2021 fully vaccinated eligible visa holders can travel to Australia without needing to apply for a travel exemption, and enter eligible states and territories quarantine free.</p>
<p>“If an arriving individual is not vaccinated, they must provide acceptable proof that they cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons to be able to access the same travel arrangement as fully vaccinated travellers.</p>
<p>“Australian Border Force will continue to ensure that those who arrive at our border comply with our strict border requirements.”</p>
<p>After weeks of debate over Djokovic’s presence – or otherwise – at the Australian Open, the news had finally emerged via his own social media channels on Tuesday morning. </p>
