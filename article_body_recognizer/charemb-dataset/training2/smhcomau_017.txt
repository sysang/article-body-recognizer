<p>It’s unclear where Djokovic will head after that, but with residences scattered across Monaco, Spain and his native Serbia, he will have his pick of homes to choose from – all offering plenty of space in which to rest and recuperate.</p>
<p>The world number one has amassed quite the property portfolio over the years, from penthouses in New York’s Soho and the Serbian capital of Belgrade, to a hillside mansion in Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>The three-bedroom apartment – with wrap-around terrace with ocean views – eventually sold for $6 million in mid-2020, with the agent reporting at the time that Djokovic never even lived in it.</p>
<p>The 18-story-luxury tower was designed by Renzo Piano, as were two separate two-bedroom apartments in New York, each spanning more than 185 square metres, that the Journal reported Djokovic also bought in 2017.</p>
<p>The apartments at 565 Broome Soho reportedly cost Djokovic more than $10 million and were situated on the upper floors of the 30-storey development. They were not adjacent to each other, and as such could not be combined.</p>
<p>The development does not feature a tennis court but has a fitness centre with a yoga studio, an indoor heated lap pool with a steam room and sauna and other amenities like a 24-hour concierge service, automated parking and a library.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Spanish media reported in 2020 that Djokovic was set to make Marbella in southern Spain’s Costa del Sol his home base after spending more than €10 million on a nine-bedroom villa he rented during lockdown.</p>
<p>Djokovic and his wife Jelena shared glimpses of the home on social media during the early stages of the pandemic, sharing videos of themselves playing tennis, dancing and doing a spot of acro yoga on the living room floor.</p>
<p>Djokovic was also spotted training in Marbella over the holidays before departing for Melbourne.</p>
<p>The property offers mountain and sea views and features a tennis court as well as a swimming pool, cinema room, guest house, gym and sauna.</p>
<p>Less is known about his residence in Monte Carlo, his base for some 15 years. Djokovic owns a hillside home in the well-known tax haven, which offers views of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

<p>Australia’s booming property market is set to change gears this year, as affordability limitations, tighter lending and rising mortgage rates weigh on buyer demand.</p>
<div>How do you make a $270,000 profit? Sell your property in a pandemic</div>
<p>Property sellers who sold at a profit made paper gains of $270,000 on average last winter, as housing prices soared in spite of lockdown, new figures show.</p>
<p>Of the homes that sold during the September quarter last year, 92.4 per cent changed hands for a paper gain, up from 91.9 per cent in the June quarter, CoreLogic’s latest Pain and Gain Report found.</p>
<p>“The increase in the rate of profit-making sales is a reflection of strong capital growth across Australian dwelling markets despite COVID-induced disruptions to transaction activity,” CoreLogic head of research Eliza Owen said.</p>
<p>“The three months to September was the fifth consecutive quarter in which the rate of profit-making sales across Australia increased.”</p>
<p>The Pain and Gain Report covered about 99,000 sales in the quarter, 7000 fewer than in the June quarter due to social distancing restrictions.</p>
<p>Homeowners were more likely to sell at a profit than at any other time in the past decade, the report found, although their result depended on location and type of property.</p>
<p>In the Melbourne CBD, 34 per cent of all sales made a loss, reflecting an oversupplied unit market that has persisted since before the pandemic. In Sydney, the Strathfield area recorded 22.3 per cent of all sales at a loss.</p>
<p>Sellers were most likely to make a profit in Bendigo, where 99.8 per cent of sales changed hands for a gain as city dwellers made a tree-change or a sea-change in droves.</p>
<p>Houses were more likely to make a profit than units, at 95 per cent and 86.5 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>Among these, house sellers also made a larger average gain, of $315,000, almost double the return on profitable unit sales of $159,300.</p>
<p>Of the sales that made a loss, the average amount was $37,000 overall, or $40,000 for units compared to $32,000 for houses.</p>
<p>Owner-occupiers had a better chance of making a profit than investors, at 95.5 per cent compared to 89.7 per cent respectively.</p>
<p>Sellers who had been able to hold onto their properties for a longer period of time were more likely to maximise their gains.</p>
<p>For profit-making house sales, the sellers owned them for a median 9.2 years, and 8.1 years for units sold at a profit.</p>
<p>This year the share of profit-making resales is likely to rise after home values lifted late in 2021, CoreLogic said.</p>
<div><p>But the research house warned of looming headwinds for the property market, such as rising interest rates, an increase in supply of homes for sale, affordability constraints and a possible regulatory clampdown on home lending.</p></div>

<div>‘Extremely disappointed’ Novak Djokovic deported after losing visa battle</div>
<div><div><h5>By Paul Sakkal and Simone Fox Koob</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 16, 2022 — 11.33pm</time></span><span>first published at <time>1.58pm</time></span></div></div></div>

<p>Novak Djokovic will be denied the chance to defend his Australian Open title after the Federal Court validated a federal government decision to deport him because of his stance on vaccination.</p>
<p>He boarded an Emirates flight to Dubai on Sunday night, a journey expected to take 14 hours.</p>
<p>Djokovic thanked his family, friends, team, supporters, fans and “my fellow Serbians” for the support he said had been “a great source of strength to me”.</p>
<p>“I am extremely disappointed with the court ruling to dismiss my application for judicial review of the Minister’s decision to cancel my visa, which means I cannot stay in Australia and participate in the Australian Open.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said in a statement that he “welcome[d] the decision to keep our borders strong and keep Australians safe”.</p>
<p>The Australian government initially cancelled the player’s visa on the basis that his medical exemption – a prior COVID-19 infection – was not a valid exemption.</p>
<p>Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia, James Allsop, announced the unanimous decision of a full bench of the court just before 6pm and ordered Djokovic to pay the government’s costs.</p>
<p>“These grounds focus on whether [the] decision was ... irrational or legally unreasonable,” the judge said. “It is not part of the function of the court to decide upon the merits or the wisdom of the decision [by Mr Hawke].”</p>
<p>Delivering the verdict, he said: “The orders of the court are … the amended application be dismissed with costs.”</p>
<p>The debate over whether Djokovic could stay in Australia earlier focused heavily on one quote from April 2020, in which the tennis champion expressed scepticism about vaccination at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, Djokovic’s counsel Nick Wood, SC, referred to an online article from the BBC titled “What has Novak Djokovic actually said about vaccines?” contained in an affidavit filed by the Immigration Minister.</p>
<p>Mr Wood said that, over the past few days, the minister had not sought Djokovic’s current view about vaccination.</p>
<p>Mr Wood said that the minister referred in his submissions to Djokovic’s “well-known stance” on vaccination.</p>
<p>“What is that well-known stance?” asked Mr Wood. “The minister doesn’t identify, couldn’t possibly identify it because, as the minister says, he didn’t know what it was and decided not to ask.</p>
<p>Djokovic’s legal team also argued that Mr Hawke did not properly consider that anti-vax sentiment would be stoked if the tennis star’s visa was cancelled and he was expelled from the country.</p>
<p>“There was no evidence at all about anti-vax sentiment being fostered by the option the minister did not pursue, which is simply letting my client play tennis for two weeks.”</p>
<p>Stephen Lloyd, SC, acting for the Immigration Minister, said it was wrong to claim that Mr Hawke had not properly assessed the reaction to the cancellation of the visa.</p>
<p>“A large part of the issue is not just what his views are but how his views are perceived … to that extent there is no reason to think there was any duty to inquire,” he told the court.</p>
<p>Djokovic chose not to give evidence during the proceedings, he said. He stressed that the government did not have to prove that Djokovic would definitely foster anti-vaccination sentiment, but that he may foster it.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Association of Tennis Professionals said Djokovic’s visa cancellation marked the end of a “deeply regrettable series of events”.</p>
<p>“Irrespective of how this point has been reached, Novak is one of our sport’s greatest champions and his absence from the Australian Open is a loss for the game.”</p>

<div>‘Inevitable’: Where house prices are heading in 2022</div>
<p>Australia’s booming housing market is set for an “inevitable” slowdown this year, with easing buyer demand and an increase in homes for sale expected to bring an end to rapidly rising prices.</p>
<p>After soaring to new heights in 2021, property values are tipped to keep climbing this year, but at a much slower rate as affordability constraints, rising mortgage rates and tighter lending standards ease buyer demand and price growth, experts say.</p>
<p>Prices are expected to flatline by the second half of the year, with price falls on the horizon for 2023 – when experts believe interest rates are likely to rise.</p>
<p>The exceptional price hikes seen across the country last year would not be repeated, with prices likely to peak in the second half of this year, said Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at Commonwealth Bank.</p>
<p>“It can’t keep growing at this sort of rate. It was inevitable that we were going to see a moderation in price growth and that’s what is happening right now,” he said.</p>
<p>However, the impact of rising fixed mortgage rates and tighter lending standards would be seen throughout the year as house hunters faced reduced borrowing power.</p>
<p>“The forecast we have is a very modest decline in the context of the gains that we’ve seen in the past year,” Ms Emmet said.</p>
<p>However, there was a risk the market would slow and fall faster than expected, she added, with the drop in auction clearance rates and daily price data suggesting a “fairly material” slow down in house prices by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Though the reopening of borders, and return of expats and new arrivals, would add to housing demand, it would not be enough to change the slowing housing picture, she said, noting interest rates would again be a larger driving force for prices.</p>
<p>Westpac senior economist Matthew Hassan said house prices would be sensitive to lending limits and interest rate changes, which he expected to see as early as February 2023.</p>
<p>“[Lending limits] in combination with this growing expectation of a rate hike – and not just one but a cycle of rate hikes in coming years – will flatten the market out in the second half of [this] year,” he said.</p>
<p>“[It] comes back to a difference in supply dynamics, and it comes back to the affordability story,” she said.</p>
<p>However, Ms Owen noted there could be a more broad-based downturn as mortgage rates rise, stock levels normalise and affordability issues ripple into lower-priced markets.</p>
<p>She did not make a prediction for property prices this year but noted the consensus was that growth would be a lot softer than the 22 per cent observed in 2021 – with bank economists expecting single-digit growth.</p>

<p>An expected slowdown in property price rises this year may bring some relief to frustrated first home buyers who have been shut out of Australia’s booming housing market, or those who need a larger dwelling to house their growing families.</p>
<p>The median house price in Sydney was $1,360,543 in November last year up from $1,000,170 in November 2020. In Melbourne, the median house price increased from $790,543 in November 2020 to $986,992 in November last year, according to CoreLogic.</p>
<p>While the December holiday period is ordinarily a quieter month in the housing market, the preliminary results are a promising sign that the pandemic property boom is starting to slow.</p>
<p>Gareth Aird, head of Australian economics at Commonwealth Bank, has forecast prices to rise by 7 per cent this year, before a rising cash rate puts downward pressure on prices, which are expected to fall by up to 10 per cent in 2023. </p>
<p>Longer-term stability in property values is needed to keep homeownership within the reach of all Australians. It is incumbent on all major parties to produce more effective policies to achieve this end.</p>
<p>First homeowner grants have simply helped fuel higher prices and policies to simply increase housing supply in outer suburbs, where there are fewer services, are not the answer.</p>
<p>Tighter borrowing regulations such as the increase to the interest rate serviceability buffer and the increase in fixed home loan rates have helped to take some heat out of the market. But more needs to be done.</p>
<p>In a federal election year, the Herald urges the major parties to develop some bold policies to improve housing affordability. But we are not hopeful.</p>
<p>Housing affordability is a key political issue that many Australians – or their children – now face. If major parties continue to avoid seriously tackling this issue, it will be the nation’s loss.</p>
