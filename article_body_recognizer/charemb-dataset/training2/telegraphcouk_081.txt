<h2> We're spending millions on Covid antivirals, but do they work? </h2>
<p> The government failed to exploit the opportunity of a much cheaper treatment - vitamin D </p>
<h2> <a> What a crying baby wants you to know </a> </h2>
<p> The most common source of distress for babies is bowel-related with over half troubled by reflux, colic, constipation, diarrhoea or vomiting </p>
<h2> <a> Remarks on race don’t help our health service </a> </h2>
<p> I believe Sajid Javid’s claim that ‘systemic racism’ is responsible for worse health outcomes only causes distrust among minority groups </p>
<h2> The hidden side to wonder drugs </h2>
<p> Omeprazole removes the need for surgery on stomach ulcers, but new research suggests it can have troublesome side effects </p>
<h2> <a> Antibiotics changed the world, but we still don’t know how they work </a> </h2>
<p> One of the greatest scientific achievements of the 20th century, their role and purpose remains profoundly mysterious </p>
<h2> <a> What you should know before starting antidepressants </a> </h2>
<p> The drugs can be effective, but if patients withdraw too quickly, it can mimic symptoms of depression </p>
<h2> <a> ‘Burnt-out’ GPs need a dose of reality </a> </h2>
<p> The average GP is working a shorter week and just over half of that is spent with patients – overworking is not the problem </p>
<h2> Don’t be fooled by the scaremongering around paracetamol and pregnancy </h2>
<p> A recent review, published in a reputable journal, appears authoritative but on close reading proves underwhelming </p>
<h2> <a> Doctors' ‘neutral stance’ on assisted dying is anything but </a> </h2>
<p> A recent British Medical Association vote reflects conflicting views among medical practitioners on how best to help the terminally ill </p>

<p> Not only are they letting people down when they need them most but, strictly speaking, they are breaking the law as well </p>
<h2> <a> Are GPs who refuse face-to-face appointments breaking the law? </a> </h2>
<p> Not only are they letting people down when they need them most but, strictly speaking, they aren't fulfilling their duty </p>

<h2> <a> The less common type of backache – and what can be done to fix it </a> </h2>

<h2> <a> Doctor's diary: Face masks are disastrous for our skin </a> </h2>
<p> They’re still compulsory in many places and can cause a whole range of skin conditions, which are only now coming to light </p>
<h2> How your age can lead to GPs muddling your diagnosis </h2>
<p> Every now and then a patient will have symptoms that are inappropriate for their age group, which can make diagnosis tricky </p>
<h2> <a> It's time to end the shocking variation in how our GP surgeries work </a> </h2>
<p> While some find it almost impossible to get an appointment at their local surgery, others are able to walk straight in </p>
<h2> <a> Weight loss surgery isn’t just aesthetic – it should be an NHS priority </a> </h2>
<p> Some people might scoff at such procedures, particularly in adolescents, but they can cure type 2 diabetes and improve mental health </p>
<h2> <a> Yes, GP surgeries are open... but not for business as usual </a> </h2>
<p> ‘Covid-compliant’ opening hours for surgeries can seem excessively restrictive, but GPs are just as frustrated as patients </p>

<p>In other words, a 35-year-old can have the immune system of a 50-year-old, or a healthy 60-year-old could have that of a much younger adult.</p>
<p>“Our immune systems age just like the rest of us,” says Dr Jenna Macciochi, a leading expert in immunology at the University of Sussex and author of Immunity: The Science of Staying Well.</p>
<p>“However, recent studies have found that our ‘immune age’ isn’t necessarily the same as our chronological age.”</p>
<h3>Regular exercise can give you the immunity of a 25-year-old</h3>
<p>Professor Janet Lord, another co-author, said while our immune system declines by 2-3 per cent a year from our 20s, older exercisers have extra protection from this decline, are protected more from viruses and will respond better to vaccines.</p>
<p>“Even a daily lunchtime walk will help,” says Dr Macciochi. “Moving every day is essential for your lymphatic system, which helps your immune cells perform more efficiently.”</p>
<p>Research in the British Medical Journal found those who walked for at least 20 minutes a day had 43 per cent fewer sick days due to the common cold.</p>
<p>Look after your muscles, too – strength training has been shown to have the effect of sheltering certain types of T-cells, important in our immune response.</p>
<p>Evidence shows that poor gut health can increase immune age, says Dr Macciochi, while a healthy microbiome can slow down the ageing process.</p>
<a>It can also include pulses, nuts, seeds, tofu, dairy and eggs</a>.”
<h3>A cold shower may stop you getting sick</h3>
<p>Exposure to cold temperatures stresses the immune system in a beneficial way, creating an anti-ageing effect.</p>
<h3>Get outside – and take vitamin D</h3>
<p>Vitamin D’s role in immunity is now well established. Experts agree that we should spend plenty of time outside and <a>take supplements between October and March</a>.</p>
<h3>Sleep, let go of resentment and see your friends</h3>
<a>If you don’t sleep properly</a>, other immune-protecting behaviours during the day like eating well and exercise won’t really count.”
<p>Avoiding, or managing, stress and letting go of resentment is important too, she adds.</p>
<p>Turning to hobbies to relax – such as sport, music, art or cooking – is a better idea, and maintaining friendships too.</p>

<p>“That’s why quickfire 10 and 20-minute workouts have surged in popularity. People are shortening their workouts – it’s all about efficiency and getting the job done.” </p>
<p>Most popular trainers on YouTube and Instagram produce short, snappy sessions of around 10 minutes. Here are the best ones to try. </p>
<p>Wyndham-Read served in the British Army before becoming a personal trainer. She has now been crowned the UK’s most popular fitness trainer on YouTube (even ahead of Joe Wicks by some counts). </p>
<p>You can expect recognisable moves such as high knees, side kicks and squats, with an emphasis on sculpting the waist and lower body. The workouts are easy to follow and the exercises varied enough to keep things interesting. </p>
<h3>2. Joe Wicks (aka the Body Coach) </h3>
<a>PE with Joe</a>, but Wicks’ 10-minute YouTube workouts are also well worth considering to get you moving if you’re short on time. 
<p>Following a similar format to his longer HIIT sessions, Wicks’ 10-minute full body workout comprises sets of 45 seconds of work with 15 seconds of rest, with moves including squats, jogging on the spot, mountain climbers and crunches. </p>
<p>Wicks has also filmed 10-minute workouts for seniors, with gentle, low-impact exercises such as marching on the spot, lateral shoulder raises and shallow squats. </p>
<p>Yoga teacher Adriene Mishler was a lockdown saviour for many who turned to her videos to find some much-needed calm amid the chaos. </p>
<h3>5. Kayla Itsines </h3>
<p>Full disclosure: German fitness influencer Pamela Reif is not a qualified personal trainer. However, she is a phenomenally successful ‘online training buddy’ to the millions of people who watch her workouts on YouTube. </p>
