<div><div><h1>Year since Washington change, Native sports imagery evolving</h1></div><div>By STEPHEN WHYNOJuly 13, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Washington will not have any kind of Native American imagery as part of its next name, and the subject is still evolving across sports in the year since the storied NFL franchise dropped arguably the most polarizing moniker left in the pros.</p>
<a>lengthy post</a> on the team’s website Monday, saying feedback from Native American communities showed “deep-seated discomfort” about that name.
<p>That would distance Washington from the old name more than changes at the college level in the 1990s: St. John’s going from Redmen to Red Storm and Miami of Ohio dropping Redskins to become the RedHawks.</p>
<p>Wright said team officials are “confident that our new brand identity will honor our legacy and lead us into our future as a franchise.”</p>
<p>As the latest reckoning over racial injustice, iconography and racism continues in the U.S., Washington is far from the only franchise considering a change, while others defend the status quo.</p>
<a>facing calls to abandon</a> a tradition of fans breaking into a “war chant” while making a chopping hand motion designed to mimic the Native American tomahawk — which is not unique to Kansas City.
<p>A coalition of Native American groups put up billboards in the Kansas City area to protest the tomahawk chop and Chiefs’ name.</p>
<a>Elks was announced as Edmonton’s new name</a>.
<p>Cleveland and Atlanta appear to be at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p>
<a>a final list of possibilities</a>. While Cleveland has not given a firm timetable on a new name, owner Paul Dolan told The Associated Press in December it will not have any association with anything Native American.
<p> <a>The Braves have resisted</a> calls for a name change. The team has not waivered from a firm statement in a letter to season-ticket holders in 2020 that said: “We will always be the Atlanta Braves.”</p>
<p>Like the Chiefs, the Blackhawks banned headdresses at home games as part of their pledge to honor the Native American community, with which the team has tried to strengthen ties over the past year.</p>
<p>Illinois retired the Chief Illiniwek mascot in 2007 but has kept the Fighting Illini name.</p>

<div><div><h1>Aaron’s death prompts call to change name: Braves to Hammers</h1></div><div>By PAUL NEWBERRYJanuary 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<div><div>1 of 8</div><div><div>Hank Aaron of the Atlanta Braves reacts Saturday, July 21, 1973, in Atlanta after hitting 700th career home run against the Philadelphia Phillies. (AP Photo)</div></div></div>
<p>ATLANTA (AP) — As his adopted hometown mourned Hank Aaron’s death, some fans called on the Atlanta Braves to change their name to the Hammers in his honor.</p>
<p>The governors of both Georgia and Alabama ordered flags to be flown at half-staff in honor of Aaron — the Hammer was born in the port city of Mobile and called Atlanta home for much of his life.</p>
<a>Georgia Tech’s football team</a> all announced they would retire Aaron’s trademark No. 44 for their 2021 seasons. The number was long ago retired by the Braves.
<p>“May generations of Georgians continue to be inspired by his groundbreaking career and tremendous impact on our state and nation,” Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said.</p>
<p>Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey added, “He inspired many young boys and girls to pursue their dreams and pursue excellence in whatever they do.”</p>
<p>The Braves <a>opened up Truist Park to fans</a> for the first time since the 2019 season, allowing them to pay socially distanced tribute to Aaron on Friday and Saturday at his statue located in a monument garden on the main stadium concourse.</p>
<p>The Hammer spent nearly all of his 23-year career with the Braves, whose nickname has drawn some criticism as being offensive to Native Americans.</p>
<p>Social media buzzed with calls to change the moniker to match Aaron’s nickname. There was even a fledgling <a>online petition</a> backing the idea.</p>
<p>The Braves have steadfastly resisted calls to change their name, saying they view it as a tribute to Native Americans rather than a slur. </p>
<p>The team <a>did not distribute red foam tomahawks</a> before the decisive Game 5 of the series, won by the Cardinals, and also halted the playing of rhythmic music that prompts fans to break into the arm-swinging chop. </p>
<p>Braves officials have not said whether those moves will be permanent when fans are allowed to return to games, but it has <a>removed a “Chop On” sign</a> that was near the entrance to Truist Park. </p>
<p>In recent months, some fans began coming up with <a>a possible new logo</a> that replaced the team’s trademark tomahawk with a similar-looking hammer. </p>
<p>There has been no indication that Aaron’s death would change the team’s stance on its Braves nickname. The NL’s oldest franchise began using Braves more than 100 years ago while its played in its original home in Boston.</p>
<p>The team changed its name to the Bees in 1936, a move that lasted until it reverted back to the Braves in 1941.</p>
<a>Meriam-Webster</a> defined as “insulting and contemptuous.” Baseball’s Cleveland Indians have announced they will change their nickname as well, though not until after the 2021 season.
<div>Full Coverage: <a>MLB</a></div>
<p>The Braves are among several big league teams that still use Native American-inspired monikers, including the NFL’s Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, the NBA’s Golden State Warriors and the NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks.</p>
<p>The Brewers plan to wear a “44” patch on their jersey sleeves throughout the 2021 season.</p>
<p>“His contributions to the game of baseball and the community of Milwaukee created a legacy that is cherished and will never be forgotten,” Brewers owner Mark Attanasio said. </p>
<p>Bob Uecker, who was Aaron’s teammate in Milwaukee during the 1960s and went on to greater fame as a Hall of Fame broadcaster, remembered his longtime friend.</p>
<p>“I will always cherish my time with Hank, and with (his wife) Billye — all the laughs we shared, and all the unforgettable stories,” Uecker said. ”Hank loved Wisconsin, and we loved him back.”</p>
<div><div><h1>Guardians MLB team settles lawsuit with roller derby club</h1></div><div>By TOM WITHERSNovember 16, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>CLEVELAND (AP) — Cleveland will have two teams called the Guardians.</p>
<p>The Major League Baseball franchise and a local roller derby club have reached a resolution in a lawsuit filed over the use of the name Guardians, allowing both to continue using it.</p>
<p>No other terms of the agreement were disclosed.</p>
<p>The legal scuffle was another hurdle in a long route to the official name change for the Indians, whose decision to drop Indians angered some fans and alienated others. The American League team has been known as the Indians since 1915.</p>
<p>Next season, they’ll be the Guardians, a name chosen following a yearlong process that sprang from a national reckoning over racist names and symbols.</p>
<p>Now that the legal entanglement has been resolved, the Guardians baseball team can begin selling merchandise. The team had been hoping to have new jerseys and caps on store shelves in time for holiday shopping.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the team began removing Indians signs in and around Progressive Field.</p>
<div><div><h1>Guardians chosen as new name for Cleveland’s baseball team</h1></div><div>By TOM WITHERSJuly 23, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>CLEVELAND (AP) — While riding his bike over a bridge across the Cuyahoga River near Progressive Field, Indians owner Paul Dolan rarely paid much attention to the eight giant stone figures that seem to guard the city.</p>
<p>After more than 100 years, Cleveland’s Major League Baseball team is getting a new name — Guardians.</p>
<p>The Indians are going, going, soon to be gone.</p>
<p>The ballclub announced Friday that at the end of the 2021 season, the Indians will transition from the name they’ve been known as since 1915 and replace it with Guardians, one they hope inspires a new generation of fans.</p>
<p>The name change, which has its supporters and critics among Cleveland’s fan base, ends months of internal discussions triggered by a national reckoning for institutions and teams to drop logos and names considered racist.</p>
<p>“And actually, the selection of the name solidifies that feeling because of the values that the name represents.”</p>
<p>Cleveland’s new name was inspired by the large landmark stone edifices — referred to as traffic guardians — that flank both ends of the Hope Memorial Bridge, which connects downtown to Ohio City. </p>
<p>As the team moved closer to making a final decision on the name, Dolan said he found himself looking closely at the huge art deco sculptures.</p>
<p>The team did not reveal the names of any of the other finalists, but Brian Barren, Cleveland’s president of business operations, said trademarking issues eliminated several potential candidates.</p>
<p>In the end, the team felt Guardians was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>“They’re protective of our city, they’re protective of the land and everything about it. That’s one key component, the resiliency of people here in Cleveland and Northeast Ohio and the loyalty.”</p>
<p>Cleveland’s name change comes as the Washington Football Team continues to work toward a similar makeover. The franchise dropped its contentious Redskins name before the 2020 season and recently said it will reveal a new name and logo in 2022.</p>
<p>While dropping Indians, Cleveland will keep its red, white and navy team colors and the Guardians’ logos will incorporate some of the team’s lettering style on past uniforms as well as architectural features found on the bridge.</p>
<p>Numerous Native American groups have protested Cleveland’s use of the Wahoo logo and Indians name for years, so the latest development brought some comfort.</p>
<p>The name change has sparked lively debate among the city’s passionate sports fans. Other names, including the Spiders, which is what the team was called before 1900, were pushed by supporters on social media platforms.</p>
<p>Dolan knows there’s a portion of Cleveland’s fan base that may never accept the change.</p>
<p>Manager Terry Francona’s ties to the ballclub run deep. His father, Tito, played for the Indians in the 1960s.</p>
<p>As a stirring video narrated by Oscar-winning actor — and die-hard Indians fan — Tom Hanks was shown to kick off the news conference, Francona moved his seat closer to get a better view.</p>
<p>Guardians is the fifth name in franchise history joining the Blues (1901), Bronchos (1902), Naps (1903-1914) and Indians (1915-2021).</p>
<div><div><h1>NFL teams providing female fans with clubs of their own</h1></div><div>By LARRY LAGEJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>DETROIT (AP) — Verdell Blackmon showed up for a recent NFL game and left no doubt who she was cheering for that afternoon.</p>
<p>Blackmon’s hair, makeup, nails and dress were bright hues of blue, and Detroit Lions Women of the Pride was printed on her black shirt.</p>
<p>The Lions season ticket holder was one of about 50 women in the team’s Women of the Pride group who attended a pregame party at Ford Field and witnessed Detroit’s first win of the season against Minnesota last month.</p>
<p>“Female fans are not recognized like they should be in the NFL, and it’s about time that’s starting to happen,” Blackmon said. “We love our teams just as much as the guys do.”</p>
<p><a>The NFL</a> is starting to recognize that.</p>

<p>The defending Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers started <a>the Women of Red </a> six years ago and more than 1,000 women have attended a day at training camp dedicated to them.</p>
<p>In Detroit, female fans paid $129 for Women of the Pride membership and received a ticket for the game against the Vikings, along with a pregame gathering, other events and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>“It’s important to us to reach our fans in all the ways we can and there was an opportunity to tap into what is oftentimes an underserved and powerful subset of our base,” said Emily Griffin, Lions vice president of marketing.</p>
<p>Jacki Jameson was all-in when she received an email from the Lions, even though she lives nowhere near the Motor City.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty wonderful that they give people this opportunity to go behind the scenes because there’s a lot of female fans out there that honestly deserve some extra perks after being overlooked for so long.”</p>

<div><div><h1>Raiders set NFL record with 5 last-second victories</h1></div><div>By JOSH DUBOWJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>In a record-setting season for last-play wins, no team has sweated it out more than the Las Vegas Raiders.</p>
<p>After game-winning field goals on the final play this week by Cincinnati’s Evan McPherson and Las Vegas’ Daniel Carlson, there have been 32 games decided by a winning score on the final play, the most in NFL history.</p>
<p>Carlson has provided four of those wins himself, making overtime field goals to beat Miami in Week 3 and Dallas on Thanksgiving, along with kicks at the end of regulation against Cleveland in Week 15 and Indianapolis last week.</p>
<p>The Raiders also won on a walk-off overtime TD pass from Derek Carr to Zay Jones in the opener against Baltimore, becoming the first team in NFL history to win five games in a season with a score on the final play, according to Sportradar.</p>
<p>There have been 46 games this season with the game-winning score coming in the final minute of regulation or in overtime, the fifth-most in NFL history. Only 2013 (49), 2015 (49), 2003 (48) and 2002 (47) had more.</p>
<p>Aaron Rodgers is on the verge of another near-perfect passing season against the NFC North.</p>
<p>Rodgers has thrown 16 TD passes without an interception this season for the Green Bay Packers against their division foes. This comes after Rodgers had 20 TD passes and no interceptions against Detroit, Chicago and Minnesota in 2020.</p>
<p>There have been only four seasons since the merger when a quarterback threw at least 15 touchdown passes without an interception. Rodgers has three of them, having also thrown 18 TD passes and no interceptions in the NFC North in 2014.</p>
<p>The only other quarterback to do it was Rodgers’ former teammate Brett Favre, who had 15 TD passes and no interceptions for Minnesota against the NFC North in 2009.</p>
<p>Rodgers’ play has helped the Packers win at least 13 games for the third time under third-year coach Matt LaFleur.</p>
<p>LaFleur is already tied for the fourth-most 13-win seasons for a coach in NFL history, trailing only Bill Belichick (seven), Sean Payton (four) and George Seifert (four). </p>
<p>The Cincinnati Bengals completed a worst-to-first turnaround.</p>
<p>The Bengals clinched the AFC North for the first since 2015 a year after finishing last in the division, marking the 17th time in the past 19 seasons that a team won the division a year after finishing last or tied for last. </p>
<p>Dallas also has won the division after the playoffs last season, marking the 18th time in the past 19 seasons that at least two teams won the division a year after missing the playoffs.</p>
<p>This is the 32nd straight season that at least four teams made the playoffs after missing out the previous season. San Francisco, Las Vegas and the Los Angeles Chargers can join them with wins this week. </p>
<p>The NFL set a record this season for fourth-down aggressiveness.</p>
<p>Teams have gone for it on 734 fourth downs this season, 76 more than the previous high set just last season. Teams converted on 386 of those attempts, breaking the record of 362 set in 2020.</p>
<p>There have already been more than twice as many successful fourth-down tries in the NFL as there were a decade ago, when teams had 186 in 2011.</p>
<p>The success rate of 52.6% will fall a bit shy of the previous high from the last 30 years of 55.7% in 2018 and the 55% last season. But this marks the third time in four seasons that teams converted on more than half of fourth-down tries.</p>
<p>The NFC got the edge from the extra 17th game added to the schedule this season, winning 10 of the 16 matchups despite all of them coming in AFC stadiums.</p>
<p>The league added the extra game for 2021, matching up teams that finished in the same place in their respective divisions. </p>

<p>It seemed like the end of the regular season, too, but that’s another story. There’s another week to go for the NFL and the reality of an extra game is sinking in for players who never wanted it in the first place.</p>
<p>Minnesota fans would have been happy just to get in. They also would have been happy to see their starting quarterback in Green Bay, but Kirk Cousins couldn’t find enough plexiglass in Minnesota to avoid getting COVID-19.</p>

<p>None of that mattered Monday night in an emotional farewell win for a quarterback who has meant so much to Steelers fans. If indeed this is the end for Roethlisberger, he leaves with two Super Bowl rings and one incredible stat.</p>
<p>In the 18 years since Roethlisberger was taken with the 11th choice in the 2004 NFL draft, the Steelers never had a losing season.</p>
<p>That proved true even in a season that was one game too long.</p>

<div><div><h1>Tuesday Sports in Brief</h1></div><div>By The Associated PressJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Washington’s NFL team announced Tuesday it will unveil its new name on Feb. 2 and that it will not be the Wolves or RedWolves.</p>
<p>Commanders, Admirals, Armada, Brigade, Sentinels, Defenders, Red Hogs, Presidents and the status quo “Washington Football Team” were among the other finalists.</p>
<p>A decision was made not to go with Wolves or RedWolves because of trademarks held by other organizations. Those possibilities were popular among Washington fans.</p>
<p>The new helmets and uniforms will feature the franchise’s signature burgundy-and-gold colors, with three stars on the collar and stripes on the shoulders of otherwise plain jerseys.</p>
<p>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Novak Djokovic will get a chance to defend his Australian Open title after receiving a medical exemption to travel to Melbourne.</p>
<p>Djokovic has continually refused to reveal if he is vaccinated against the coronavirus.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Israel sets COVID-19 record amid zigzag policy and 4th jab</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The Victoria state government has mandated that all players, staff and fans attending the Australian Open must be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 unless there’s a genuine reason why an exemption should be granted.</p>
<p>Djokovic is seeking a record-breaking 21st Grand Slam singles title. </p>
<p>CLINTON, S.C. (AP) — Presbyterian hired Steve Englehart as football coach on Tuesday as the program moves on from Kevin Kelley, who made waves by almost never punting but didn’t win much in his only season with the Blue Hose.</p>
<p>The Blue Hose won their first two games but then lost nine straight as opposing coaches adapted to Kelley’s tactics. </p>
<p>BROOKVILLE, N.Y. (AP) — Long Island University has hired veteran coach Ron Cooper, who spent this season working for Alabama, to lead its football program.</p>
<p>Cooper, a former head coach at Louisville and defensive coach at multiple SEC schools, spent this season as an analyst for Nick Saban’s program that plays Georgia on Monday in the national championship game. He was hired Tuesday.</p>
<p>LIVERPOOL, England (AP) — Liverpool has requested the postponement of Thursday’s match against Arsenal in the English League Cup semifinals because of more suspected COVID-19 cases at the club.</p>
<p>First-team training was canceled at Liverpool on Tuesday after more positive tests among players and staff.</p>
<p>Liverpool said other factors impacting selection, such as injuries and players like Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah having left for the African Cup of Nations, are affecting player availability for the first-leg match at Emirates Stadium.</p>
<p>SOUTHAMPTON, England (AP) — Southampton has been bought by a company fronted by the founder of eastern European telecommunications giant United Group, the English Premier League club said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dragan Solak’s Sport Republic purchased the 80% stake held by Chinese businessman Gao Jisheng, who has been majority shareholder at the south-coast club since 2017.</p>
<p>No financial details were disclosed by Southampton, which is 14th in the 20-team league and has been in England’s top division since 2012.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old Propper left Brighton in the offseason after four years at the south-coast club and hoped returning for a second spell at PSV Eindhoven might see him regain his motivation.</p>
<p>Propper last played for the Netherlands in 2019, having made his debut four years earlier.</p>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Kevin Kalkhoven, the team co-owner of Tony Kanaan’s Indianapolis 500-winning entry in 2013, died Tuesday. He was 77.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis Motor Speedway announced Kalkhoven’s death and did not detail a cause.</p>
<p>Kalkhoven was co-owner with Jimmy Vasser of the KV Racing Technology-SH Racing Chevrolet that Kanaan drove to an emotional victory.</p>
<p>Kalkhoven also played a major role in the reunification of North American open-wheel racing.</p>

<p>The NFL team formerly known as the Redskins will go by the Washington Football Team for at least the 2020 season, giving the organization time to choose a new, full-time name.</p>
<p>Gone is the Indian head logo and the name Native American advocates have called a dictionary-defined racial slur. Here to stay are the burgundy and gold colors that are synonymous with the franchise’s storied history.</p>
<p>Executive vice president and chief marketing officer Terry Bateman, hired Monday to oversee the name change and rebranding process, called the temporary design “a nice link between the history and the future.”</p>
<p>That’s when the real work begins to select a new name. More than 1,000 names have been submitted, and Red Wolves and Red Tails are among the betting favorites on online sportsbooks.</p>
<p>“I’ve gotten long letters from people explaining their idea,” Bateman said. “What I tell everybody is everything that comes in will be put in the hopper.”</p>
<p>Owner Dan Snyder recently dropped the Redskins name amid pressure from sponsors and after decades of criticism from Native American advocacy groups. The franchise that began in Boston in 1932 had the name Redskins since 1933.</p>
<p>“We’re not going to put an artificial time frame on it,” Bateman said.</p>
<p>Marketing experts hope Snyder, coach Ron Rivera and Washington’s creative department consult with the community before determining a new name. Bateman expects fans, sponsors and others to have input before a final decision is made.</p>
<div><div><h1>Washington’s NFL team drops ‘Redskins’ name after 87 years</h1></div><div>By STEPHEN WHYNOJuly 13, 2020 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The Washington NFL franchise announced Monday it is dropping the “Redskins” name and Indian head logo, bowing to recent pressure from sponsors and decades of criticism that they are offensive to Native Americans.</p>
<p>“As a kid who grew up in the (D.C. area), it’ll always be #HTTR (fight song ‘Hail to the Redskins’) but looking forward to the future,” starting quarterback Dwayne Haskins <a>tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>This will be the NFL’s first name change since the late 1990s when the Tennessee Oilers became the Titans two seasons after moving from Houston.</p>
<a>“thorough review”</a> amid pressure from sponsors. FedEx, Nike, Pepsi and Bank of America all
<a>lined up against the name</a>, which was given to the franchise in 1933 when the team was still based in Boston.
<a>wrote to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell</a> last week demanding an immediate end to Washington’s use of the name. Goodell, who has fielded questions on the topic for years, said he supported the review.
<div>Full Coverage: <a>NFL</a></div>
<p>Bowser said she welcomed the name change but there were still obstacles to overcome before the team’s return from suburban Maryland became a serious possibility.</p>
<p>“Yes, we want to change the name and change the location,” she said. “The Washington football team should be playing in Washington.”</p>
<p>MLB’s Atlanta Braves and the NHL’s Chicago Blackhawks have said they have no inclination to make a change. Some advocates would like to see all Native American names, mascots and imagery out of sports.</p>
