<header> <h1> Cheugy, brain ticklers, quaranteen: how many of this year’s new words can you decipher? </h1> <p> Every year new words get added to the Oxford English Dictionary </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Boudicca Fox-Leonard <time> 30 December 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>You’re at a Christmas party where the conversation is about buying NFTs; a quaranteen mutters ‘so cheugy’ at her aunt’s skinny jeans (and her criticism of the Metaverse). Any idea what’s going on? </p>
<p>Last year was unprecedented. 2021 has hardly been any less baffling, but we’ve endeavoured to find the right new words to describe them.</p>
<p>The pandemic this year has also given us; anti-vaxxer, strollout, missed-bump and brain-tickler.</p>
<p>Whether we’ll still be referring to swabs as brain-ticklers in years to come is why the OED usually takes its time before committing itself to a word (‘Bants’ was only added last year despite its having irritated us since 2008).</p>
<p>McPherson and her team upload new words to the online dictionary four times a year. They added Covid-19 within three months of it becoming a thing last year, but generally they are the giant tortoise of lexicography.</p>
<p>Language expert, Chris West, the author of Strong Language and CEO of Verbal Identity, is more of the hare. He is as likely to be consulting Urban Dictionary as the OED, if only to understand what his 16-year-old daughter is talking about.</p>
<p>“There’s the ‘official way’ or monitoring words of the year, which is quite scientific, and then there’s the more fun way of keeping your ear to the ground.</p>
<p>“When you hear a word you don’t quite understand, it means there’s something happening in society that’s worth looking at a bit more.”</p>
<p>Fashions in language are shorthands for understanding the zeitgeist. West says that whatever age you are, there are usually new words being used by someone younger than you.</p>
<p>Right now, social justice is a rich source of lexical inspiration: dictionary.com chose allyship as its word of the year. As an American dictionary, West says they tend to pick up on movements in social inclusion sooner than we do over here.</p>
<p>In doing so they highlight the changing role of dictionaries; being part of a movement looking forward, “Rather than a backward-looking record of what has been,” says.</p>
<p>Personally he’s excited by allyship. “It represents what I think more of us need to be conscious of.” Its usage, he thinks, is “more in hope than in reality.”</p>
<p>Woke was used in the 2010s within the African-American community to encompass a broader awareness of social inequalities such as sexism. It can be traced as far back as the 1938 song “Scottsboro Boys”.</p>
<p>Today it is often used pejoratively to signal over-zealous application of ideologies. It has become an insult.</p>
<p>“It’s taken on much more shape and character,” says West.</p>
<p>Language might reflect and shape our beliefs, but it’s not immune to fashion.</p>
<p>So what new words can we expect to hear next year?</p>
<p>McPherson speaks for all of us when she says “it would be nice if the language landscape wasn’t quite so dominated with words to do with Covid.”</p>
<p>West meanwhile has his eyes on the world of politics</p>
<p>“Autocrat is going to be a word of 2022. What we’re seeing is greater division in people’s belief in political leaders. We’re seeing the emergence of non-democratic leaders just outside the edge of Europe.”</p>
<h2>Chris West’s words of 2021</h2>
<p>Strollout = an australianism that was MacQuarie Dictionary’s word of the year. There, the vaccine rollout was so slow it was described as more of a strollout</p>
<p>Antivaxxer = someone opposed to vaccination; shows what’s happening in society.</p>
<p>Missed bump = instead of fist bump, because when we all came back into the office, what did we do? A handshake? A fist bump? It often ended up as a missed bump.</p>
<p>Meta = if you want to talk about business this is a key word. There was a metaverse before Mark Zuckerbeg changed the name of his business, but this signals a big change.</p>
<p>The Great Resignation = making a late run. You might already be fed up reading about it, but maybe it’s just started.</p>
<p>Girl boss = now being used ironically, as a pusback against millenial white feminism</p>
<p>So, “if it’s not going well for me, I guess I’ll have to gaslight gatekeep girl boss my way to the top”</p>
<p>Quaranteen = a teenager who lived through Covid-19 or a child who became a teenager in this decade.</p>
<p>Cheugy = commonly claimed to have been popularized by Gen Z to mock lifestyle trends associated with the early 2010s</p>

<header> <h1> Death of the swimming pool – is it the end of another great British institution? </h1> <p> Almost 2,000 public pools could be lost within a decade. Meet the locals trying to save them </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Joe Shute, Senior Feature Writer <time> 1 January 2022 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Today the pool, which was designed in 1935 in honour of King George V’s Silver Jubilee and opened two years later, remains as much a part of his life. </p>
<p>When he was diagnosed with prostate cancer eight years ago, he swam here throughout his recovery. ‘I thought I was dead when I got the diagnosis,’ he admits. ‘For me, the pool was somewhere to come and forget.’</p>
<p>Hatcher, 65, a retired motorcycle salesman, now comes here on weekends with his 11-year-old grandson – it is where he taught him to swim. ‘We come every Saturday and he can now swim 25 to 30 lengths,’ Hatcher beams.</p>
<p>The decline of our municipal swimming pools is a story being replicated across the country. Almost 2,000 could be lost within a decade without urgent action, according to national governing body <a>Swim England</a>. </p>
<p>At the current rate of closures, the number of indoor public pools in England will fall by 40 per cent from 4,336 to around 2,468. </p>
<p>Last year, <a>Swindon’s Oasis Leisure Centre</a>, which has recently been Grade-II listed for its unique ’70s domed roof, was closed and threatened with demolition as part of a redevelopment of the site. </p>
<p>In Cornwall, campaigners are currently calling on the council to save three at-risk leisure centres and a hydrotherapy pool in St Austell. The costs associated with historic pools make them especially vulnerable.</p>
<p>Indeed, saving them comes at a price. Swim England’s report, published in September, found that Government and local authorities need to invest £1 billion to refurbish these ageing facilities – and fast.</p>
<p>The impact of successive lockdowns has played a part – with revenues drying up and some swimmers remaining reluctant to return – but there are wider issues at play. </p>
<p>Many of Britain’s pools were built more than half a century ago and cash-strapped local authorities are increasingly unwilling to invest in the ageing buildings. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, gleaming private gyms and newly built swimming pools with ultra-modern facilities are luring customers away. The recent trend for wild swimming also means local pools have fallen further out of fashion.</p>
<a>Tokyo Olympic Games</a>, Team GB won eight medals in swimming (including four golds), the largest haul from any Olympics. The proposed closure of so many pools is feared to be putting that sporting legacy at risk. 
<p>In 2014, Brownlee and his brother Jonny, a fellow Olympian, started the <a>Brownlee Foundation</a>, which has encouraged tens of thousands of children from all backgrounds into exercise, including swimming. </p>
<p>The ability to swim and access to a pool should, Brownlee argues, be a basic right afforded to every young person in the country, but already many aren’t being given that chance.</p>
<p>‘The wooden-clad ceiling, the smell, the vending machines for after-swimming snacks… I loved all that because it is such a part of our memories and culture.’</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, it was decided that every home in the city of Bristol should be within one mile of a swimming facility. And so between 1922 and 1937, six pools, including Jubilee Pool, were built by the <a>Bristol City Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>Jules Laming, chair of <a>Friends of Jubilee Pool</a>, explains they are now launching another rather more audacious bid: to take control of the pool from the council and run it as a not-for-profit community enterprise. </p>
<p>‘A combination of Covid and not being able to exercise or socialise for two years, plus the injustice of closing the pool, has galvanised the community to come together and try to save it,’ Laming says. </p>
<p>Since the campaign launched, membership has nearly doubled, from 320 to 620 people (each pays a monthly subscription of around £20). At present, she says, around 2,400 people are using the pool every month.</p>
<p>Staff at Hengrove Pool say there are some separate changing facilities alongside the mixed ones, but according to the Friends of Jubilee Pool, some of their swimmers feel far more comfortable and safe in changing rooms they are familiar with. </p>
<p>One swimmer says that she has been sexually assaulted in the past; going swimming helps her deal with her trauma. Closing a pool with only single-sex changing rooms would, she admits, have a significant impact on her. </p>
<a>Clevedon Marine Lake</a>, a tidal pool fed by the Bristol Channel. Jerry Hatcher took his grandson there in lockdown, and Noah visited a few times with his carer, but the cold salt water and distances involved proved too much for both of them. 
<p>‘If the pool shuts it will probably be the end of my swimming career,’ says Hatcher. ‘As a regular form of exercise it won’t happen for me, and it probably won’t happen for my grandson either.’</p>
<p>A looming closure can stir a community into action. Around the country there are several at-risk pools that have been saved at the 11th hour by swimmers and residents coming together.</p>
<a>Bramley Baths</a> in Leeds shortly after dawn and slipped into the water for her first swim after a long winter. That morning marked the reopening of the pool after being closed for four months during the third national lockdown. 
<p>Under new social-distancing rules, Gilligan had to forgo a shower and was instructed not to stop at the end of any lanes, but still, she swam for 45 minutes. ‘It was heaven,’ she recalls.</p>
<p>David, 57, a retail manager who had retired due to numerous health problems, was severely affected by Covid. On the day he was admitted to hospital, a doctor telephoned Gilligan, who was seriously ill herself, with bad news. </p>
<p>He pulled through and three weeks later returned home: he’d lost over a stone in weight, had a two-week memory blank and was left bedridden for weeks. </p>
<p>Quin’s mother learnt to swim here and his grandmother, too. She also visited the pool during the Second World War when its glass ceiling was blacked out and the water covered over to host Saturday-night dances. </p>
<p>She is regularly approached when out and about by people she taught as babies and teenagers, whose faces she has long forgotten. But they never forget her and always make a point of coming over and saying hello. </p>

<header> <h1> Couple hires private jet to bring dog stranded by Covid home for Christmas </h1> <p> Coronavirus-related travel disruptions meant 'Million Dollar Munchkin' was unable to fly home to Australia from New Zealand </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Agence France-Presse <time> 9 December 2021 • 3:29pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>An Australian couple plans to shell out tens of thousands of dollars hiring a private jet to fly their stranded dog home from New Zealand in time for Christmas.</p>
<p>Munchkin, a former Bali street dog, is stuck in New Zealand unable to travel to her owners' home on Australia's Sunshine Coast due to Covid border rules and flight disruptions.</p>
<p>Owner Tash Corbin said after a five-month separation from Munchkin and her fiance, David Daynes, she had decided to hire a private jet costing Aus$45,000 (£24,200) for her pooch and partner's trip to Australia.</p>
<p>"The money part is not the number one driver, it's about who can most certainly get them home before Christmas," she told AFP.</p>
<p>"Christmas is a really big deal for us... I just want us all to be together."</p>
<p>Pandemic-related disruptions mean there are few flights operating between New Zealand's South Island and airports near the Sunshine Coast.</p>
<p>And travelling via New Zealand's North Island, where there is currently a virus outbreak, would put Daynes in a two-week quarantine lasting through much of the festive season.</p>
<p>The couple is hoping to split the costs by recruiting passengers, offering to foot half of the jet bill while selling four remaining seats to other travellers, or perhaps hitching a ride on another private charter.</p>
<p>If their scheme is successful, it would be the final stage in a five-year journey to bring Munchkin from the Indonesian island of Bali, where she was adopted as a puppy.</p>
<p>Corbin said the canine spent three years in Singapore with various foster families after failing medical tests to enter Australia, which has strict rules around importing pets.</p>
<p>She and Daynes eventually packed up and moved to New Zealand when the country accepted Munchkin in 2019, hoping to stay there temporarily until Australia approved the dog's entry.</p>
<p>Corbin eventually returned home alone for medical reasons while Daynes waited for the green light from Australia.</p>
<p>The entire process has cost so much money that Corbin has christened the dog "Million Dollar Munchkin" on social media.</p>
<p>"We stopped counting about three years ago when it got to Aus$40,000," she said.</p>
<p>"We didn't ever at the start of this process expect that it would cost this much or take this long. We expected it to be Aus$10,000 and six weeks."</p>
<p>Corbin said she realised the couple was "in such a privileged position" to have the funds and there was "no way" she could ever leave Munchkin behind.</p>
<p>"She's our family now and so I wouldn't change it for the world. I love her so much and she's such an amazing little creature."</p>

<p> At one point I didn’t even like pups, but chance brought me face to face with animals in desperate need of kindness – and a new home </p>

<p>The lady’s parents arrived and emptied a bag of rotten tomatoes in front of the dog, who desperately ate her food for the day.</p>
<p>‘Oh, a dog!’ I said. ‘I’ve been looking for a dog like this for years. Could I… have her?’</p>
<p>‘Sure,’ said the dad, shoving her into my car. I drove off at 70mph. By chance, that same day, a friend who knew I rescued dogs called and told me he wanted to adopt a medium-sized dog, should I encounter one. </p>
<p>Before them all came my cantankerous Jack Russell Omar, and Linda the Anatolian Shepherd, who was found starving by a dogwalker. She now weighs seven stone and is given to nudging my hands off the keyboard when breakfast is late.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I didn’t even like dogs: my flatmate went to adopt a puppy from the neighbour and I went along to dissuade her. She chose a girl. The rejected Omar looked lost under the sofa. We left with two puppies.</p>
<p>Then in 2014, my mum had a minor stroke. The ICU explained all that family members had to do was be supportive. ‘I know,’ I thought. ‘I’ll buy her a dog instead.’</p>
<a>Preloved</a> had every breed to order. All the ads said they were the puppies of much-loved family pets and it broke their hearts to let them go, at £500 to £3,000.
<p>Finally I found a charity selling £200 Maltese terriers. The internet said this breed was docile. Perfect. They had one, she was six, she came with TCs that I definitely planned to read, thinking, ‘Six, great, no housetraining.’</p>
<p>There was a video of her house. It was like The Silence of the Lambs. Her garden had a furnace with bits of dog in it. The woman was a monster, yet the council had inspected this house and reported her fit to breed puppies.</p>
<p>It transpired that Thistle wouldn’t eat because her teeth had black rot and she was in agony. For the first weeks, she screamed in her sleep, kicking her little legs.</p>
<p>In 2019, I rented a holiday cottage in Spain. I hadn’t got out of the car before next door’s sheepdog ran up with half her fur missing. ‘There goes the holiday,’ I thought.</p>
<a>Finding Furever Homes</a> and contacted
<a>Staffie Stray Rescue in Bournemouth</a>, who have an army of kind fosterers with sofa space. Arundawn in Horsham offered expert care for two, and venerable Pine Ridge in Ascot saved three more.

<p>You are not so much being a grandparent as <a>“doing grandparenting”</a>, and that’s a big difference. It’s become more of a job, with defined responsibilities, rather than simply turning up as a loving, extra pair of hands.</p>
<h4>‘They hurl themselves at me and it’s just wonderful’</h4>
<p>Deni Evans, 67, from south London, is grandmother to 14 biological and ‘acquired’ grandchildren</p>
<p>I was an accidental mother to my eldest son, so at first I was quite a resistant grandmother. I remember telling him that he was not to make me a grandmother and I didn’t want to be one until I was at least 60.</p>
<p>When she got a job as a gardener for the local council, she told the interviewers about <a>my little garden</a> to explain where her passion came from. That blew me away.</p>
<h4>‘Fearing that I will never be a grandparent has hit me hard’</h4>
<p>Jayne Rear, 58, from Lancashire, has two sons including Jack, 27, who lives in London, neither of whom is likely to become a father in the traditional sense</p>
<p>At 28, we started planning for a family and almost straight away I became pregnant. I had a great job that I loved and thought that having a baby would be a minor inconvenience and had planned nurseries and when I would go back to work.</p>
<a>I will never be a grandparent</a> in the traditional sense. This has hit me hard. I think I assumed that I just would.
<a>that whole new wave of unconditional love</a> that comes with having grandchildren.
<p>Still, hope springs eternal, and life has thrown me enough curveballs to make me feel foolish for trying to predict the future. Maybe I will hang on to the stuff in the loft for a little longer. Who knows…</p>
<h4>‘You get all the pleasures, not the everyday drudges’</h4>
<p>Susan and David Graff, 72 and 75, from West Hampstead, London, have four grandchildren through their three children</p>
<p>Frankly, it’s wonderful to give them back. You get all the pleasures and you don’t have the everyday drudges. Nothing could be nicer.</p>
<h3>Get with it granny: which modern grandma are you?</h3>
<p>Does exactly the same thing as Doormat Granny while constantly grouching about it</p>
<h4>ROCK ’N’ ROLL GRANNY</h4>
<p>She’s just a gran who can’t say no. She’ll drive 150 miles each way twice a week to babysit while her daughter works. She is basically the same as Martyr Granny (see right), except that she never complains</p>

<p>A few years back, I drank too much sauvignon blanc at a PTA meeting and volunteered to help. I have been chairman ever since.</p>
<p>One morning before the summer school fair I was flying around having been up all night hand-painting a nine-foot piece of plywood for the fundraising steeplechase I had dreamt up.</p>
<p>One of my jobs was to collect the generator hired from Jewson for the bouncy castle. As the shop manager handed it over he said: “The petrol needs a top up.” Petrol? It runs on petrol?</p>
<p>The country was in the throes of the fuel crisis so I spent the rest of the morning at different petrol stations trying to persuade forecourt attendants and angry, queuing drivers that I was not a panic buyer.</p>
<p>This would have been the ideal time to call in the calvary – my mum – to chase around the county with me, giggling as we go, juggling the three kids and jerry cans.</p>
<p>She died eight years ago and it was in that moment of ridiculousness and relief that I missed her more than ever, as both my mum and their grandma.</p>
<p>In my PTA role maybe I can propose that all school-run grannies pass a Crufts-style agility test in order to fetch the kids?</p>
<p>I casually sidled up to her at the school gate to assess whether we are compatible in the parent-grandparent dynamic. Somewhat shoehorned into the niceties – I run the petrol story by her, laughing at my own tale.</p>
<p>She doesn’t get it, looks at me like I’m a moron and says: “What did you think generators ran on? Fresh air?”</p>
<p>It’s not going to work and super-granny fails the test she doesn’t realise she’s taking. Rather than finding a new grandma, I’ll just have to work harder to train up our existing grandpas.</p>

<h1> Is graternity leave a silver bullet or poisoned chalice for our army of grandparent carers? </h1>
<div> <div> By Rosa Silverman <time> 9 December 2021 • 5:40pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Indeed, Age UK estimates more than a third (about 40 per cent) of grandparents aged 50-plus care for their grandchildren regularly. Almost three-quarters (71 per cent) of those grandparents under 65 are in work. </p>
<p>But the plan to introduce grandparental leave at a national level was ultimately shelved, leaving it up to employers to offer such perks on a unilateral basis. Saga isn’t the first to decide to do so.</p>
<p>“While it’s great to see more employers recognise the role of grandparents and kinship carers, we won’t get a long-term solution until we tackle the cost and availability of childcare across the UK.”</p>
<p>If catering to older workers might take various forms in the years to come, it seems one thing is certain: Saga won’t be the last to bring in an eye-catching and progressive perk like grandparental leave. </p>
