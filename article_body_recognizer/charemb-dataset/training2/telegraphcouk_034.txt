<header> <h1> Greece demands relaxation of EU debt rules </h1> <p> Bloc braces for battle over borrowing limits likely to spark further divisions between north and south </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tom Rees <time> 3 January 2022 • 4:33pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Greece is demanding a relaxation of European debt rules to allow a wave of green investment as Brussels braces for an explosive battle over spending limits.</p>
<p>Christos Staikouras, the Greek finance minister, said the new EU debt rulebook must encourage borrowing to fund important infrastructure projects and warned that a failure to make changes may put economic growth at risk.</p>
<p>In an interview with The Telegraph, he said the debt rules must ensure fiscal prudence but also allow for “realistic” debt reduction targets along with exemptions for specific investments such as green spending.</p>
<p>The intervention <a>is likely to raise hackles in the European north</a>, where voters and politicians have long feared they will be forced to bankroll risky spending by southern nations.</p>
<p>Mr Staikouras, a former analyst at the Bank of England, said: "We expect that there will be changes and amendments, taking the lessons from the pandemic and the eurozone debt crisis.</p>
<p>“They have to ensure fiscal sustainability and credibility but on a realistic basis without jeopardising economic growth. Debt reduction should be gradual, sustained and realistic, with a greater sense of national ownership.”</p>
<p>Many countries in southern Europe have complained that the current rules - which limit public debt to 60pc of GDP and prevent deficits higher than 3pc - do not allow them to invest to spur growth and cut emissions.</p>
<p>The debt rules under the Stability and Growth Pact have been suspended until 2023 because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Many southern countries, including France and Italy, believe that bringing them back is unfeasible after the surge in government debt and need for public investment in the climate transition.</p>
<p>Mr Staikouras has been encouraged by initial signs from Olaf Scholz’s new German government, which will be a key power broker in talks.</p>
<p>He said: “According to the coalition statement released recently in Germany, it seems there is room for manoeuvre regarding the European fiscal rules."</p>
<p>The pandemic set back the Greek economy’s recovery, with output still well below levels from before the debt crisis, although GDP bounced back strongly from the pandemic in 2021.</p>
<p>Mr Staikouras expects “high and sustainable growth” from 2022 as his pro-business reforms begin to bear fruit and attract foreign investment.</p>
<p>European Commission forecasts suggest investment will rise by up to 16pc in coming years compared to an average of only 5pc for member countries.</p>
<p>He said: “In the following couple of years, it seems that we will manage to significantly close the investment gap that was created the previous decade.</p>
<p>“We have already attracted significant global names like Microsoft, Pfizer, Cisco, Deloitte and Volkswagen.”</p>
<header> <h1> Emmanuel Macron and Mario Draghi tell Brussels to turn on spending taps </h1> <p> French and Italian leaders hit out at EU’s 'obscure and excessively complex' fiscal rules in thinly veiled attack on conservative Germany </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Louis Ashworth <time> 23 December 2021 • 1:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Emmanuel Macron and Mario Draghi have thrown down the gauntlet to Brussels, demanding the European Union loosens its spending rules in the wake of the pandemic.</p>
<p>In an intervention that will be viewed as a challenge to Europe’s fiscal conservatives, the Italian prime minister and French president say they “need to have more room for manoeuvre”.</p>
<p>Writing in the Financial Times, the leaders lambasted the EU’s “obscure and excessively complex” fiscal rules.</p>
<p>The comments will be aimed particularly at Germany, where the new Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is expected to press ahead with more ambitious spending efforts after ousting the long-ruling conservative CDU in recent elections. </p>
<p>“We will need a framework that is credible, transparent and capable of contributing to our collective ambition for a stronger, more sustainable and fairer Europe,” they added.</p>
<a>we must bring down our levels of indebtedness</a>. But we cannot expect to do this through higher taxes or unsustainable cuts in social spending, nor can we choke off growth through unviable fiscal adjustment.”
<p>The article is likely to re-ignite a debate over government spending that has divided the EU in recent years.</p>
<p>Mr Draghi, the former European Central Bank president, has long called for increased state spending to address economic challenges. The EU is undertaking a review of its rules.</p>
<p>But his demands, and those of many other European leaders, particularly in the poorer south, have met fierce resistance from northern hawks including its biggest economy Germany.</p>
<p>Mr Scholz’s victory may have shifted momentum back towards Europe’s doves, but influential conservative governments, particularly the Dutch, are likely to warn that looser rules could lead to profligate spending in parts of the bloc.</p>
<header> <h1> Watch: Why 2022 could see the end of Macron’s European dream </h1> <p> Video analysis from James Crisp on the French president’s make-or-break year </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Crisp, Europe Editor and Jack Leather, Senior Video Producer <time> 21 December 2021 • 1:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Emmanuel Macron faces an “all or nothing” year in 2022, with his big plans for the European Union dependent on whether he can get re-elected as France’s president.</p>
<p>“I believe Mr Macron will get re-elected and probably quite easily,"says James Crisp, The Telegraph’s Europe Editor.</p>
<p>"But if he loses the elections in April, it is the end of his French presidency, it is the end of his dreams for Europe, and it would be the last we hear of the mercurial Mr Macron.”</p>
<p>He is now the EU’s “most influential leader” after Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, stepped down after 16 years as “Europe's biggest beast”.</p>
<p>The timing is good for him, with France taking up a rotating presidency of the EU, and an opportunity to push “his vision of a Europe that protects”.</p>

<header> <h1> China cuts interest rates to fight economic impact of zero-Covid policy </h1> <p> The Chinese central bank reduces rates for the first time since April 2020 to fight the slowdown caused by its draconian zero-Covid policy </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Louis Ashworth <time> 20 December 2021 • 4:21pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>China’s central bank has cut interest rates in a bid to fight the economic impact of its "zero-Covid" policy. </p>
<p>The People’s Bank of China cut the benchmark one-year loan prime rate to 3.8pc from 3.85pc, the first time it has reduced rates since April 2020 when the pandemic peaked in the country.</p>
<p>The benchmark rate influences corporate and household loans, with the cut aimed at lowering the cost of borrowing to stimulate China’s economy.</p>
<p>Despite rapidly recovering from the initial hit from Covid-19, the Chinese economy has shown signs of a slowdown since the summer amid indications consumer demand is waning.</p>
<p><a>A zero-tolerance lockdown policy</a>, which has resulted in numerous small-scale shutdowns, has weighed on activity, as has a continued crackdown in sectors such as real estate.</p>
<p>Reducing interest rates may have the effect of driving up inflation in the country, but the central bank has sought to avoid this by withdrawing liquidity in other parts of China’s financial system.</p>
<p>Writing ahead of the decision to cut, ING China economist Iris Pang said the injection “is not a lot, but enough to push down interest rates for the whole curve, which supports economic growth”.</p>
<p>It has also raised the amount of foreign reserves financial bodies must hold, a move that is likely to weaken the renminbi and support Chinese exporters.</p>
<p>Chinese officials have focused on stability as an economic goal in recent months as questions swirl around the health of the world’s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>Beijing’s target for growth in 2022 is lower than this year’s, offering the ruling Communist Party more room to press ahead with an economic reform agenda.</p>
<p>The decision by the central bank to cut came as a surprise to many China-watchers, with about a quarter of analysts polled by Reuters anticipating rates would be unchanged.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Haley, from broker Oanda, said the move showed China is “blinking” in the face of waning growth.</p>
<p>“Far more loans are based on the one-year LPR than the five-year, so the move is a concrete signal that China is moving into supportive monetary policy,” he said.</p>
<header> <h1> Evergrande trading suspended as fears mount over indebted Chinese developer </h1> <p> Trading paused in Hong Kong pending release of 'inside information' </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Titcomb <time> 3 January 2022 • 3:56pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Shares in Evergrande were suspended on Monday amid increasing uncertainty about the stability of the debt-ridden Chinese property behemoth.</p>
<p>Evergrande said that trading in Hong Kong had been halted ahead of the release of “inside information”, but declined to give further details.</p>
<p>The company has also walked back plans to repay investors who bought into a wealth management product.</p>
<p>Evergrande became China’s second-biggest developer, with hundreds of property projects across dozens of cities, following a huge binge on debt.</p>
<p>However, it has been hit by Beijing-imposed limits on borrowing that have left it teetering on the brink of collapse and sparked fears of a sudden crash in Chinese real estate.</p>
<p><a>Shares fell by 90pc last year</a>, and last month the ratings agency Fitch declared that Evergrande had officially defaulted on its debts after missing a 30-day grace period to repay more than $1bn.</p>
<p>Last Tuesday it missed a deadline for another $255m of payments, although the grace period for this debt has not yet expired.</p>
<p>Evergrande had been expected to restructure its debt under the eye of Communist Party authorities, which are hoping to prevent the company’s troubles from spilling over into the wider property market.</p>
<p>It has been selling assets and shares in an effort to raise cash. Hui Ka Yan, Evergrande's founder and chairman, is said to have already put about $1.1bn of his own money into propping up the business.</p>

<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Omicron is a horrible dilemma for zero-Covid China </h1> <p> Stubborn superpower is now flirting with recession </p> </div> </div> </header>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Ambrose Evans-Pritchard <time> 7 December 2021 • 11:20am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Omicron is the end of the road for China’s zero-Covid policy. The Communist Party cannot plausibly suppress a variant that spreads with lightning speed through asymptomatic cases that escape surveillance.</p>
<p>Any such attempt would probably fail. Even if total suppression could be achieved, the social, economic, and strategic costs of trying to do the near impossible would become prohibitive over time. It would no longer be rational.</p>
<p>China has had to deal with scattered cases of the delta variant for months, usually brought in by flight crews, or leaking across the border from Myanmar, Russia, or Korea. </p>
<p>“They still have a good story to tell. They can say that the rest of the world failed and because of that China will have to live with the virus,” said Mr Williams.</p>
<a>a near-deranged policy of whack-a-mole</a>.
<p>The Communist Party has proclaimed <a>zero-Covid status</a> to be a dazzling vindication of Xi Jinping’s rule, presenting the shambolic response of the West as the defining institutional and civilizational failure of our age. </p>
<p>“Zero-Covid has been their claim to superiority, and to give that up would be a very bitter pill to swallow, so they’ll double down,” said George Magnus from Oxford University’s China Centre.</p>
<p>“There is next to no chance that they will lift the travel ban and open up before the Winter Olympics (in February), and I doubt they’ll do it before the 20th Party Congress late next year,” he said.</p>
<p>The Party actively highlighted this study to stamp out subversive utterances by a handful of Chinese scientists starting to question <a>the rationality of zero-Covid</a>.</p>
<p>But the work was based on epidemiology from the delta variant. Omicron is another story. </p>
<p>The cost-benefit calculus changes radically if the new variant proves to be as mild as suggested by the early South African hospital data, but at the same time unstoppable with a spread-rate three times higher.</p>
<p>The Tshwane study of omicron cases <a>released over the weekend</a> by the South African Medical Research Council is almost miraculously hopeful.</p>
<p>Most of the patients were admitted for other complaints and did not even know they had Covid. Few required oxygen, and only one needed intensive care. The average hospital stay was cut to 2.8 days from 8.5 in earlier waves.</p>
<p>But even the best omicron outcome entails far more deaths than China has been willing to tolerate so far.</p>
<p>The infections would rip through a population with almost no natural immunity from past exposure, reliant on home-grown vaccines that the Chinese authorities would rather not put to the test. This is the horrible dilemma that China now faces.</p>
<p>Roger Garside, a former British diplomat in Beijing and author of books on Deng Xiaoping and Xi Jinping, said last year’s narrative of China as the runaway winner of the pandemic <a>has been inverted</a>.</p>
<p>“The picture has turned radically against them. They’re in self-imposed isolation, with no route for the exit,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Garfield said it epitomises the pitfalls of a totalitarian system. Such regimes look strong but the very tools of power at their disposal end up trapping them in a dysfunctional cul-de-sac. </p>
<p>Australia’s Lowy Institute said this week in its <a>annual report on Asia’s balance of power</a> that China has lost rank over the last year.</p>
<p>This is partly because wolf warrior policies have provoked a harder containment alliance led by the US; it is also because the pandemic has tarnished China’s image and <a>inflicted further structural damage to the Chinese economy</a>.</p>
<p>The US economy has roared back and – amazingly – is now on a higher growth trajectory through the mid-2020s than it was before the pandemic, thanks to a leap forward in digital productivity as much as New Deal spending. </p>
<p>China’s recovery has sputtered out. The service sector has not regained its pre-Covid levels, and (true) GDP growth has been hovering near zero for the last two quarters.</p>
<p>It is made worse by <a>a deflating property bubble</a> and by Xi Jinping’s political purge of unruly tech companies, or the broader purge of what he calls “disorderly capital” (i.e. capital that threatens Party hegemony).</p>
<p>This assault on economic pluralism is to drain the lifeblood that has sustained China’s growth miracle since the Deng era. </p>
<p>China is on a flatter economic trajectory than pre-Covid forecasts. Productivity growth has largely converged with US levels but at a lower level of development, a textbook case of the middle income trap.</p>
<p>The last window for China’s great strategic sorpasso may be closing before its demographic crisis arrives in earnest.</p>
<p>This is a startling conclusion. Almost nobody would have predicted the superpower relegation of Xi Jinping’s China 18 months ago. The pandemic keeps deceiving.</p>
<header> <h1> China locks down city of 1.2m people after just three Covid cases detected </h1> <p> Beijing has imposed a strict lockdown on Yuzhou as it aggressively pursues a 'zero-Covid' policy ahead of the upcoming Winter Olympics </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Simina Mistreanu <time> 4 January 2022 • 11:35am </time> </div> </div>
<p>China put a city of 1.2 million people under lockdown after detecting only three asymptomatic Covid-19 cases, as the country doubles down on<a> its “zero-Covid strategy” ahead of the Winter Olympics</a>.</p>
<p>Authorities in Yuzhou, in the central Henan province, announced that starting from Monday evening, all residents had to stay home to control the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Communities were required to set up “sentinels and gates to strictly implement epidemic prevention and control measures.”</p>
<p>The city has halted all bus and taxi services and shuttered schools, shopping malls and tourist attractions. Only businesses providing daily necessities are allowed to continue to operate.</p>
<p>One person visiting Yuzhou from out of town wrote on Weibo, China’s version of Twitter, that they were woken up at 4am at the hotel where they were staying and asked to move to a different hotel to undergo quarantine.</p>
<p>“I’m disappointed with the measures,” the user wrote, adding that they hoped their Weibo account would not be suspended after commenting.</p>
<p>Beijing has been censoring criticism of its Covid-19-related policies and has punished whistleblowers and citizen journalists who reported on the initial outbreak in Wuhan.</p>
<a>Beijing Olympics next month.</a>
<p>The city has reported more than 1,600 infections since the first case – linked to a flight from Pakistan – was found last month.</p>
<p>As the lockdown continues, residents have been complaining of food shortages. Many are forced to rely on deliveries but authorities said last week they didn’t have enough delivery workers.</p>
<p>Reports have emerged on social media of people bartering cigarettes, dishwashing liquid and even sanitary pads for fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>One video even showed a resident appearing to trade his Nintendo Switch console for a packet of instant noodles and two steamed buns.</p>
<p>Authorities in Xi'an have been providing free food to households, but some residents said their supplies were running low or that they had yet to receive aid.</p>
<p>Overall across China, authorities reported 106 new locally transmitted infections on Monday, including 95 in Shaanxi province, where Xi’an is located. Officials did not say what variants were involved in the outbreaks.</p>

<header> <h1> New products put Apple on track for $4 trillion valuation </h1> <p> Virtual reality products and carmaking could send Apple's value soaring well above its record $3 trillion </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Titcomb <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>New products could push Apple towards a $4 trillion valuation, analysts and investors have predicted, after it became the first company to hit the $3 trillion mark this week.</p>
<p>Gene Munster, an investor at venture capital firm Loup Funds, said Apple could be worth $3.8 trillion next year as sales continue to soar past the records achieved in the pandemic.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts have also set targets well above the $182.87 share price that left Apple worth $3 trillion.</p>
<p>Apple briefly traversed the threshold on Monday before falling below the mark. Shares dipped on Tuesday by more than 1pc to $179.64.</p>
<p>However, forecasters have said that <a>entries into virtual reality and carmaking</a> could send its value soaring well above $3 trillion. </p>
<p>Mr Munster said the company would show early signs of entries into transport and the “metaverse”. “They're just so big that Apple's current $375bn business could be twice as big, based on these two markets.” </p>
<p>Apple, whose value sits well above its Silicon Valley rivals, hit the $3 trillion mark less than four years after becoming the first to crack $1 trillion, and 16 months after reaching $2 trillion. </p>
<p>It is expected to report record sales and profits for the final months of the year when it reports quarterly results in the coming weeks, due to stronger iPhone sales.</p>

<p>Thirteen liquefied natural gas carriers shipping supply mainly from the US and West Africa are re-routing to Europe instead of Asia, according to data from Kpler and Bloomberg. That’s up from about eight ships spotted a week earlier.</p>

<h3>Passenger groups warn train cuts are putting public health at risk through crowded carriages </h3>
<p>Cuts to rail services in response to the surge in omicron cases could put public health at risk because of overcrowding on trains, passenger groups have warned. My colleague Oliver Gill reports:</p>
<p>Operators said they are being forced to introduce emergency timetables in an effort to combat cancellations at short notice as companies deal with a wave of Covid-related staff shortages.</p>
<p>The Rail Delivery Group, the trade body for operators, said the temporary timetables would help ensure “more reliable services with fewer short notice cancellations”.</p>
<p>But passenger groups warned against significant cuts and urged operators to maintain first and last train services to maintain safety standards and ensure the needs of key sector workers are met. </p>
<h3>FTSE 100 claws back losses to close higher</h3>
<p>The FTSE 100 extended gains for the second straight session today, as a rally in oil and mining stocks helped counter early gloom amid concerns about tighter US monetary policy.</p>
<p>After falling as much as 0.2pc, the index reversed course to gain 0.2pc, closing at its highest since February 2020.</p>
<p>Oil majors BP and Royal Dutch Shell gained about 1.5pc, extending gains from yesterday's session, after OPEC+ producers stuck to an agreed output target rise for February.</p>
<h3>Round Hill buys catalogue of Heart guitarist Nancy Wilson </h3>
<p>Round Hill Music Royalty Fund said it has bought a "significant share" of master artist royalties from Nancy Wilson, the guitarist and singer from rock band Heart, though financial details were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The catalogue includes the number one hit These Dreams, as well as other big songs including Barracuda, Magic Man, Alone and Crazy On You.</p>
<h3>Stationery retailer Ryman swings to loss</h3>
<p>Theo Paphitis's high street stationery chain Ryman tumbled to an earnings loss for the first time in 25 years over the past year as the Dragon's Den star hailed wider progress across his retail operation.</p>
<p>Theo Paphitis Retail Group, which also includes the Robert Dyas and Boux Avenue brands, grew its online presence but was heavily impacted by lockdown restrictions throughout the year to March.</p>
<p>The Ryman chain tumbled to losses of £8.5m for the year, compared with a £7.8m profit in the previous year, as it was impacted by weaker student, business and city centre trade.</p>
<p>But the stationery brand said it pushed forward on the path to profitability in 2022 following the easing of restrictions last year.</p>
<h3>Shell moves exploration vessel from South African waters after court order </h3>
<p>The vessel hired by Royal Dutch Shell to look for potential oil and gas fields is on course to leave South African waters after community groups won a court case to temporarily halt the activity.</p>
<p>Seismic surveys have been paused until authorities assess whether the energy giant needs to apply for more environmental permits. </p>
<p>“Shell has decided to terminate the current contract for the survey vessel early,” a company spokesperson said. The FTSE 100 group said it is considering how it will proceed in the longer term. </p>
<p>Protests against the activity started in South Africa in November with the arrival of the Amazon Warrior. It was set to explore an area known as the Wild Coast, a relatively untouched coastline where whales are frequently spotted. </p>
<h3>French grocer Auchan mulls takeover of rival Carrefour </h3>
<p>French grocer Auchain is exploring a new attempt at a takeover of domestic rival Carrefour, Bloomberg reported.</p>
<p>The supermarket chain revived work on a potential deal after earlier negotiations collapsed in the autumn. It has held talks with private equity firms about teaming up on a bid. </p>
<p>Shares of Carrefour rose for the eighth straight day on Wednesday, the longest streak in four years. They rose as much as 6.6pc in Paris, giving the company a market value of about €13.5bn (£11.3bn). </p>
<p>A combination with Carrefour would help Auchan's founding Mulliez family create the biggest grocer in France and strengthen its position amid challenges from low-priced German rivals.</p>
<p>Any deal would need the backing of Carrefour’s anchor shareholders, the Moulin family and Brazilian retail tycoon Abilio Diniz. </p>

<h3>Electric car demand drives up Volvo sales</h3>
<p>Volvo has shrugged off supply chain disruption and semiconductor shortages to post a 5.6pc rise in global sales in 2021.</p>
<p>The Swedish group said trading was boosted by demand for electric vehicles, with sales of its recharge range of models soaring by 64pc last year and making up more than a quarter of all sales by volume worldwide.</p>
<p>This increased to nearly 40pc of all sales in December, with demand leading the way in Europe, making up almost 60pc of sales. Total sales rose by 1.8pc across the UK and Europe in the year-to-date, it added.</p>
<p>The figures come after Volvo this week named former Dyson boss Jim Rowan as its next chief executive, replacing Hakan Samuelsson, who ran the company for nearly 10 years.</p>
<h3>Debt row risks wrecking Emmanuel Macron’s bid to transform the EU</h3>
<p>The French president faces a major row with Germany as he tries to reform the eurozone, writes Tim Wallace:</p>
<p>Emmanuel Macron is fighting for his political life - and France’s presidency of the Council of the European Union could prove the ultimate weapon to cement a lead in the polls.</p>
<p>His turn to transform the EU’s agenda for six months offers Macron the chance to fill Angela Merkel’s void and lead Europe, ahead of facing the polls in April.</p>
<p>At the top of his wish list, however, is reform of the eurozone’s fiscal rules.</p>
<p>It sets the scene for a major row with Germany, the traditional guardian of financial stability, which has always insisted that the single currency had to be built on moderate debts and fiscal prudence.</p>
<h3>Bank of England dabbles in pop economics with new book</h3>
<p>The Bank of England may have come under fire for its communication in recent months, but that won't stop it having a go at some writing.</p>
<p>The Old Lady of Threadneedle street is turning its hand to mainstream book writing with a new "pop economics" titled aimed at demystifying its work.</p>
<p>The economy – and economics – is all around us, in the decisions we all make every day at home, at work, or in the shops. Despite this, economics is generally not well understood, and nor are economists.</p>
<h3>Covid day two PCR tests scrapped for travellers arriving in UK</h3>
<p>PCR tests are set to be ditched for travellers arriving in the UK, saving a family of four returning from holiday up to £200.</p>
<p>My colleague Charles Hymas has the story:</p>
<p>Ministers are understood to have agreed on Wednesday that travellers will instead only have to take a lateral flow test, which cost on average around £20 to £30 rather than the £80 for PCR swabs, as their day two tests.</p>
<p>The Cabinet’s Covid Operations committee also backed plans, first revealed in the Telegraph, to scrap pre-departure tests currently required for travellers within 48 hours of their return to Britain.</p>
<p>The moves will be a major boost for holidaymakers planning winter sun breaks and the beleaguered travel and tourism industry.</p>
<p>They mark a return to the testing regime in place in November before the omicron variant emerged in South Africa, forcing ministers to slam on restrictions in an attempt to prevent the import of the new version of the Covid virus.</p>
