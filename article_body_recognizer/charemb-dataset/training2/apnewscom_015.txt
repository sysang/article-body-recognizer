<div><div><h1>Chicago schools reopen doors after tough union fight</h1></div><div>By SOPHIA TAREEN and DON BABWINFebruary 11, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago parents Willie and Brittany Preston have spent almost a year wrestling with online school schedules for their six children, often with everyone hovering over devices around the dining room table.</p>
<p>Willie Preston, who runs a construction firm with his wife, said nowhere can guarantee a coronavirus-free environment but he feels safe with the district’s steps: cleaned buildings, daily health screenings and new air filters. </p>
<p>“We just are not trained educators and we recognize our limitations,” he said. “For me as a parent, it makes me feel like we’re beating COVID and we’re going to get our lives back. And that’s good.”</p>
<a>defying district orders, </a> city threats to lock them out of teaching systems, and talk of a potential strike.
<p>Preston’s two high school children will keep learning online at their South Side home. The district hasn’t rolled out a plan for high school students’ return.</p>
<p>Even after agreeing to the district’s safety plan, the union still argued that the district hasn’t done enough to protect teachers and that too few students want to return. </p>
<p>“We want to make sure we break through the noise and speak directly to parents,” she said. “I want to encourage our parents to continue to engage directly with the schools.”</p>
<p>Many parents remained skeptical.</p>
<p>Rosa Esquivel said she won’t send her 10- and 12-year-old back because she doesn’t believe the schools will be safe from the virus that infected her mother and sister and killed an aunt and uncle in her native Guatemala. </p>
<p>She worries her diabetes and her husband’s high blood pressure could put their own lives at risk if their kids brought the virus home from school. And they don’t know when they’ll get vaccines.</p>
<p>“We just thought it was best for us to have the kids stay remote,” said Esquivel, 40, who lives in the predominantly Hispanic Pilsen neighborhood. </p>
<p>Single mother Natassia Ballard, who lives on Chicago’s South Side, said she’s holding off for now, but may change her mind when the weather improves and flu season ends. </p>
<p>She wants to know the teachers her two elementary-age children interact with are vaccinated. But it’s been hard. One son has autism and is missing hands-on learning. </p>
<p>“He really wonders how he will fit in when the world opens up again,” she said. </p>
<p>Preston said his youngest child was excited to see friends, running to the school doors at Thursday’s drop off. </p>
<p>“These kids are exhausted from being essentially locked in for a year, and that’s hard,” he said. </p>
<div><div><h1>France sees record 271,000 coronavirus cases in single day</h1></div><div>January 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>PARIS (AP) — France reported a record-smashing 271,686 daily virus cases on Tuesday as omicron infections race across the country, burdening hospital staff and threatening to disrupt transport, schools and other services.</p>
<p>The French government is straining to avoid a new economically damaging lockdown, and is instead trying to rush a vaccine pass bill through parliament in hopes that it is enough to protect hospitals.</p>
<p>Britain, which is also seeing a big surge, reported a record 218,274 daily cases Tuesday. Germany reported 30,561 cases Tuesday.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people are hospitalized with the virus in France, a number that has been rising steadily for weeks but not as sharply as the infection rates.</p>
<p>COVID-19 patients fill more than 72% of France’s ICU beds, and a once-renowned health care system is again showing signs of strain. Most virus patients in ICUs are not vaccinated, though 77% of the population has had at least two doses.</p>

<div><div><h1>Teachers at culture war front lines with Jan. 6 education </h1></div><div>By HEATHER HOLLINGSWORTHJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>MISSION, Kan. (AP) — What students are learning about the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 may depend on where they live.</p>
<p>In a Boston suburb in heavily Democratic Massachusetts, history teacher Justin Voldman said his students will spend the day journaling about what happened and talking about the fragility of democracy.</p>
<p>Voldman said he feels fortunate: “There are other parts of the country where ... I would be scared to be a teacher.”</p>
<p>Liz Wagner, an eighth and ninth grade social studies teacher in a Des Moines suburb of increasingly Republican Iowa, got an email from an administrator last year, warning teachers to be careful in how they framed the discussion. </p>
<p>“I guess I was so, I don’t know if naïve is the appropriate word, perhaps exhausted from the pandemic teaching year last year, to understand how controversial this was going to be,” she said. </p>
<a>political action committees investing millions of dollars in races</a> to elect conservative candidates across the country, talking to students about what happened on Jan. 6 is increasingly fraught.
<p>Facing History and Ourselves, a nonprofit that helps teachers with difficult lessons on subjects like the Holocaust, offered <a>tips on how to broach the topic</a> with students in the hours after the riot.</p>
<p>Within 18 hours of publication, it had 100,000 page views — a level of interest that Abby Weiss, who oversees the development of the nonprofit’s teaching tools, said was unlike anything the group has seen before. </p>
<p>In the year that has followed, Weiss said, Republican lawmakers and governors in many states have championed legislation to limit the teaching of material that explores how race and racism influence American politics, culture and law. </p>
<p>“Teachers are anxious,” she said. “On the face of it, if you read the laws, they’re quite vague and, you know, hard to know actually what’s permissible and what isn’t.”</p>
<a>a newly released guide</a> to help teachers and parents combat those radicalization efforts.
<p>“To talk about white supremacy, to talk about white supremacist extremists, to talk about their racist Confederate flag, it’s fraught for so many reasons,” Spiegler said. </p>
<p>Concerned teachers have been reaching out to the American Federation of Teachers, which last month <a>sued over New Hampshire’s new limits</a> on the discussion of systemic racism and other topics. </p>
<p>“Not addressing the attack,” Huisken said, “is to suggest that the civic ideals we teach exist in a vacuum and don’t have any real-world application, that civic knowledge is mere trivia.”</p>

<p>“What I saw in front of me,” he said, “was basically home-grown fascism, out of control.”</p>
<p>The mob got explicit marching orders from Trump and still more encouragement from the president’s men. </p>
<p>The crowd was pumped. Until a little after 2 p.m., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was at the helm for the final minutes of decorum in partnership with Pence, who was serving his ceremonial role presiding over the process.</p>
<p>In the melee outside, near the structure built for Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20, a man threw a red fire extinguisher at the helmeted head of a police officer. Then he picked up a bullhorn and threw it at officers, too. </p>
<p>The identity of the officer could not immediately be confirmed. But Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was wounded in the chaos, died the next night; officials say he had been hit in the head with a fire extinguisher. </p>
<p>Even before the mob reached sealed doors of the House chamber, Capitol Police pulled Pelosi away from the podium, she told “60 Minutes.” </p>
<p>“I said, ‘No, I want to be here,’”she said. “And they said, ‘Well, no, you have to leave.’ I said, ‘No, I’m not leaving.’ They said, ‘No, you must leave.’” So she did.</p>
<p>The Air Force veteran from California had climbed through a broken window into the Speaker’s Lobby before a police officer’s gunshot felled her.</p>
<p>Back in the House chamber, a woman in the balcony was seen and heard screaming. Why she was doing that only became clear later when video circulated. She was screaming a prayer.</p>
<p>“The staff went under the table barricaded the door, turned out the lights, and were silent in the dark,” she said. “Under the table for two and a half hours.”</p>
<p>Authorities then ordered an evacuation and rushed everyone inside to a secure location, the Senate parliamentary staff scooping up the boxes holding the Electoral Collage certificates. </p>
<p>Although the Capitol’s attackers had been sent with Trump’s exhortation to fight, they appeared in some cases to be surprised that they had actually made it in.</p>
<p>But outside the chamber, the mob’s hunt was still on for lawmakers. “Where are they?” people could be heard yelling.</p>
<p>That question could have also applied to reinforcements — where were they?</p>
<p>At about 5:30 p.m., once the National Guard had arrived to supplement the overwhelmed Capitol Police force, a full-on effort began to get the attackers out.</p>
<p>At 7:23 p.m., officials announced that people hunkered down in two nearby congressional office buildings could leave “if anyone must.”</p>
<p>Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Ca., told AP on Sunday it was as if Capitol Police “were naked” against the attackers. “It turns out it was the worst kind of non-security anybody could ever imagine.”</p>
<p>Said McGovern: “I was in such disbelief this could possibly happen. These domestic terrorists were in the People’s House, desecrating the People’s House, destroying the People’s House.”</p>

<p>In a statement, Perry called the committee “illegitimate.”</p>
<p>The committee has also asked for any documents and correspondence between Perry and Trump, his legal team or anyone involved in the planning of Jan. 6 events.</p>
<p>The Justice Department found <a>no evidence of widespread fraud</a> in Pennsylvania or any other state, and senior Justice officials dismissed Perry’s claims.</p>
<p>Perry has said his “official communications” with Justice Department officials were consistent with the law.</p>

<p>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) — C.J. Stroud and Jaxon Smith-Njigba put on a passing performance that obliterated a multitude of records during one of the biggest offensive days in Ohio State’s storied history.</p>
<p>The Buckeyes still barely did enough to hold off resilient Utah and its backup quarterback in one spectacular Rose Bowl.</p>
<p>Ohio State created a few more legends on this trip.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Monday Sports in Brief</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Oklahoma QB Williams enters portal, says Sooners an option</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Wisconsin LB Leo Chenal announces he's entering NFL draft</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>FCS issues COVID-19 contingency plan for upcoming title game</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Yet the Buckeyes were the ones playing from behind for nearly all of the first three-plus quarters in Arroyo Seco until they summoned the will for three fourth-quarter scoring drives.</p>
<p>“Our team is built on fighting,” Smith-Njigba said. “It doesn’t matter if we’re up, down. We were down the first half, but we just had to stay level headed and keep fighting.”</p>
<p>The Utes had to turn to backup Bryson Barnes, who grew up on a pig farm in central Utah and had never thrown a collegiate pass. He he led them on a tying drive, capped by a 15-yard TD pass to Dalton Kincaid with 1:54 left.</p>
<p>“At some point, we have to play defense,” Utah coach Kyle Whittingham said. “We didn’t play very well all night long on defense. It wasn’t our usual. Not sure we’d be able to get a stop.”</p>
<p>With two top Buckeyes receivers opting out, Smith-Njigba had a landmark day that included TD receptions of 50 and 52 yards made 30 seconds apart — albeit with Covey’s TD return in between.</p>
<p>Ohio State: A win in Pasadena is always never taken for granted by a Big Ten power. The Buckeyes overcame the instinct to relax after their national title dreams died, and they put on a performance that showed Day’s program has tenacity.</p>
<div><div><h1>Fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks contained</h1></div><div>December 18, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) — A huge forest fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks has been fully contained more than three months after it broke out, officials said.</p>
<p>Fire managers declared the KNP Complex 100% contained on Dec. 16 after significant precipitation in the Sierra Nevada, the National Park Service said Friday.</p>
<p>The fire has not grown in recent weeks but there has been continued activity in remote areas, the service said.</p>
<p>The KNP Complex was ignited by a lightning storm on Sept. 9. Two fires that were spotted the next day eventually merged and scorched 138 square miles (357 square kilometers). </p>
<p>The National Park Service said total containment means that the fire’s perimeter is considered secure and no further growth is expected, which is different than a fire being declared out. </p>
<p>”Fire can become established in heavy fuels, such as large, downed trees, and may smolder there through multiple heavy snow and rain events, or even all winter, and become active again after the area dries out,” the service said.</p>
<p>The KNP Complex and another fire in the surrounding Sequoia National Forest tore through more than a third of the groves of giant sequoias in California and torched an estimated 2,261 to 3,637 sequoias, according to park officials. </p>

<p>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) — There’s an old weather adage that’s been passed over cups of coffee and glasses of beer for nearly a century: “It’s not a drought ’til it breaks your heart.”</p>

<li><div><a><h4>Climate change, new construction mean more ruinous fires</h4></a></div></li>
<p>A DROUGHT LIKE FEW OTHERS</p>
<p>2021 has been different, and has the potential to be more damaging.</p>
<p>“That didn’t really pan out as far as precipitation sometimes does with La Niña,” Peters said.</p>
<p>Thus far, the La Niña pattern of 2021 has returned the same disappointing outcomes. According to NOAA, snowpack depths across much of Montana are currently less than 60% of their normal values for this time of year.</p>
<p>As of Dec. 15, 2021 the snowpack across most of Montana was either non-existent or near historically low levels.</p>
<p>While 2021 may end up being one of the driest years on record, it didn’t start out that way.</p>
<p>Brusda pointed to a 10-week period between the end of May and mid-August when most of Montana received almost no precipitation whatsoever.</p>
<p>Abnormally high winds have also contributed to the current severe drought conditions.</p>
<p>Recent devastating wildfires across Montana this winter provide additional evidence that drought and warmer temperatures are on the verge of creating a year-round wildfire season in the state.</p>
<p>All this may seem overwhelmingly pessimistic, but there are things that can and are being done to better prepare Montana for a warmer if not drier future.</p>
<p>Montana’s cities and towns also have a role to play.</p>
<p>“There once again, we tend not to think about these things until we’re in the middle of a drought, and then it’s too late,” Downey added.</p>

<p>LINVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Firefighters are monitoring a wildfire in the vicinity of Grandfather Mountain which has burned 35 acres, officials said.</p>
<p>The department said the fire was on the Blue Ridge Parkway side of Grandfather Mountain. In a subsequent post, the department said early Sunday that the wildfire continued to advance and shift with the winds. </p>
<p>Grandfather Mountain features a nature park and a wildlife habitat as well as hiking trails and a Mile-High Swinging Bridge. It is located 75 miles (120 km) north of Asheville. </p>

<p>LINVILLE, N.C. (AP) — A fire on the slopes of Grandfather Mountain has grown, officials said Sunday.</p>
<p>The fire is estimated to be 350 acres and 10% contained, the U.S. Forest Service said. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, but U.S. Forest Service officials believe it to be caused by someone, WCNC-TV reported. </p>
<p>While a statewide burn ban has since been lifted since a large fire burned earlier this month on Pilot Mountain, brush conditions remain dry across the region.</p>
<div><div><h1>Long road to recovery for Kansas ranchers after wildfires</h1></div><div>December 27, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>PARADISE, Kan. (AP) — Ranchers in western Kansas have begun to recover from the deadly wildfires that torched their land earlier this month, but they acknowledge it will be a long process.</p>
<p>Two men died and the Kansas Forest Service estimates that around 163,000 acres of land were burned on Dec. 15 in fast-spreading fires driven by wind gusts of up to 100 mph.</p>
<p>Rich Koester, whose ranch ear the Russell County town of Paradise was among the many that were damaged, is typically busy caring for newborn calves or preparing his herd for winter this time of year. Instead, he’s been busy burying livestock.</p>
<a>KCUR-FM</a> while fighting back tears. “I don’t know how any of mine survived.”
<p>The fire killed more than one-third of his 200-head herd and engulfed every bit of his roughly 800-acre pasture.</p>

<p>“As far as you can see around here, it’s burnt,” he said. “It took all of it.”</p>
<p>Near Koester’s ranch, other fields and rolling grassland hills are charred black. Ash gray tree stumps and scorched yucca stems poke out from mounds of dust. Half-burned wooden fence posts hang from barbed wire.</p>
<p>“It was definitely a perfect storm,” she said. “These fires ran for 20-plus miles in an afternoon. … It’s very, very reminiscent of what you would see in California.”</p>
<p>Koester said his biggest immediate concern is deciding which of his remaining cattle need medicine for their burns and which should be put down.</p>
<p>But first, he stopped to check in on a neighbor who also lost his pasture to the fire.</p>
<p>“You help them, they’ll help you, and you just pass it on,” Koester said. “That’s the way it is out here.”</p>
<div><div><h1>California gets more snow, rain before New Year’s break</h1></div><div>By JOHN ANTCZAKDecember 30, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) — More snow and rain fell on California on Wednesday, causing travel disruptions on mountain routes and raising the risk of debris flows from wildfire burn scars.</p>
<p>Major highways through the snow-blanketed Sierra Nevada remained open, but chain requirements were in effect in many areas. </p>
<p>Caltrans said snowplows were working around the clock and urged people to avoid all but essential travel in the Sierra. </p>
<p>Among staggering snowfall totals in the Sierra, the Northstar resort at Lake Tahoe reported 135 inches (3.43 meters) since Dec. 21.</p>
<p>Gov. Gavin Newsom activated the State Operations Center to monitor storm conditions. </p>
<p>“I strongly encourage all Californians to avoid making the situation worse and refrain from traveling on mountain roads until conditions improve,” he said.</p>
<p>Some people who visited Lake Tahoe for the Christmas holiday found the drive back slow and frightening because of the winter storms.</p>
<p>“It was probably the most terrifying experience that I’ve ever dealt with,” said Emily Kelbatyrov of Sacramento, who spent 18 hours in the car.</p>
<p>“A lot of cars were slipping into snowbanks, she told KGO-TV. “We ended up losing control of our car and almost crashed into two other people coming the opposite way.”</p>
<p>On the scenic central coast, a 10-mile (16-kilometer) stretch of often-troubled Highway 1 remained closed by a weekend slide in San Luis Obispo County.</p>
<p>People living in other Southern California burn areas were urged to leave voluntarily.</p>
<p>A flood watch was posted for much of the region from just south of Los Angeles County to San Diego and inland. Winter storm warnings were issued for many Southern California mountain ranges.</p>
<p>The Six Flags Magic Mountain theme park closed Wednesday due to the weather.</p>
<p>Forecasts called for California weather to generally dry out for the New Year’s weekend before more storminess next week. </p>
<div><div><h1>Colorado wildfires burn hundreds of homes, force evacuations</h1></div><div>By PATTY NIEBERGDecember 31, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>DENVER (AP) — An estimated 580 homes, a hotel and a shopping center have burned and tens of thousands of people were evacuated in wind-fueled wildfires outside Denver, officials said Thursday evening.</p>
<p>The first fire erupted just before 10:30 a.m. and was “attacked pretty quickly and laid down later in the day and is currently being monitored” with no structures lost, Pelle said. </p>
<p>The activity of the fires, which are burning unusually late into the winter season, will depend on how the winds behave overnight and could determine when crews are able to go in and begin assessing the damage and searching for any victims. </p>
<p>“This is the kind of fire we can’t fight head on,” Pelle said. “We actually had deputy sheriffs and firefighters in areas that had to pull out because they just got overrun,” he added.</p>
<p>Evacuations have been ordered for the city of Louisville, home to about 21,000 people, and Superior, which has another 13,000 residents. </p>
<p>Residents evacuated fairly calmly and orderly, but the winding streets in the suburban subdivisions quickly became clogged as people tried to get out. It sometimes took cars as long as 45 minutes to advance about a half mile (less than a kilometer).</p>
