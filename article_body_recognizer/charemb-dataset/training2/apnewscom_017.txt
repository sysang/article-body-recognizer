<p>Ohio and other states were required to redraw their congressional maps to reflect results of the 2020 census, under which Ohio lost one of its current 16 districts due to lagging population.</p>
<p>“The 2011 plan was struck down by a federal district court as a partisan gerrymander,” he said. “The efficiency gap of that plan was 11%. The efficiency gap of this plan is about 23%. It’s worse.” </p>
<p>Stafford said Republicans who drew the new map “cherry-picked” which statewide elections’ results they used to determine “competitiveness,” and that that line of argument was flawed.</p>
<p>The plan in dispute <a>sprinted through the Ohio Statehouse </a> last month and passed without Democratic support. It was signed days later by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, who son, Pat, is one of four GOP justices on the seven-member court. </p>
<p>Because the map got no backing from Democrats, it will hold for just four years, rather than the typical 10. </p>
<p>Both lawsuits target DeWine and the other members of the powerful Ohio Redistricting Commission, rather than the Legislature.</p>

<p>The landmark votes capped months of work by the 13-member panel, which voters created to stop partisan gerrymandering.</p>
<p>In the U.S. House delegation, there could be 7-6 splits in favor of either party if it is close statewide, with three highly competitive seats in the Grand Rapids, Lansing and Flint/Saginaw areas.</p>
<p>The battle for the majority in the state Senate, where the GOP has a 22-16 edge due to gerrymandering despite Democrat Gretchen Whitmer winning the governorship by nearly 10 points in 2018, will become much tighter. </p>
<a>new plan</a> based on an analysis of 2016, 2018 and 2020 election data, according to PlanScore, a project of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. The GOP has controlled the chamber for nearly 40 years.
<p>The <a>map</a> for the state House, where Republicans have a 58-52 advantage, also will be fairer to Democrats. PlanScore projects a potential 56-54 GOP edge if Republicans get 49% of the vote.</p>
<p>Michigan Republican Party spokesperson Gustavo Portela said it was “evaluating all options to take steps necessary to defend the voices silenced by this commission.”</p>
<p>The congressional map, which draws together several incumbents, led many to announce their plans.</p>
<p>Second-term Democratic Andy Levin of Bloomfield Township and Haley Stevens of Waterford Township will face off for the new, more Democratic 11th District in Oakland County — leaving open the Republican-leaning 10th in nearby Macomb County.</p>
<p>Fifth-term Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee of Flint will run in the competitive 8th District, while fourth-term Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Midland will seek election in the Republican-heavy 2nd District to the west.</p>
<p>Second-term Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin of Holly will run for the competitive 7th District in the Lansing area. Republican state Sen. Tom Barrett is running, too.</p>
<p>Fourth-term Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell will run in the Democratic-heavy 6th District in the Ann Arbor area, saying it includes 60% of her constituents but not her hometown of Dearborn.</p>
<p>“Are they perfect? No. But we did the best job we could with the time and everything else we were given. We compromised,” said Cynthia Orton, a Republican member.</p>
<p>Eight of 13 commissioners backed the congressional map, nine supported the state Senate map and 11 endorsed the state House map.</p>

<p>Democrats say the new lines, especially for Congress and the state Senate, grab too much power for Republicans, considering President Joe Biden carried Georgia with a narrow majority last year and two Democratic senators won seats in January. </p>
<p>Critics also allege that the maps violate the federal Voting Rights Act by unnecessarily dividing minority populations, especially because nonwhite people make up most of the new Georgians added in the past decade.</p>
<p>The <a>American Civil Liberties Union sued in federal court</a> on behalf of the historically Black Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, the Sixth District of the African Methodist Episcopal Church covering Georgia, and several individual voters.</p>
<p>Republicans say they were careful to follow the dictates of the Voting Rights Act. They also note that their maps split fewer counties.</p>
<p>Fair Districts Georgia, a group that analyzed the maps with an eye toward preventing gerrymandering, said all three maps would have fewer districts where each party would have a competitive shot at winning than under current lines.</p>
<p>The General Assembly must redraw electoral districts at least once every decade to equalize populations after the U.S. census.</p>
<div><div><h1>Georgia county looks to close polling sites, have 1 location</h1></div><div>January 1, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>LINCOLNTON, Ga. (AP) — A rural Georgia county north of Augusta is moving ahead with plans to shut down all seven of its voting sites and have residents vote in person at one location, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.</p>
<p>“We really don’t have room in some of our facilities to do social distancing and to do the things that we need to do to keep my poll workers safe,” Bolton said. </p>
<p>Voting rights advocates are crying foul.</p>
<p>The closures would require rural voters in the county to drive 15 miles (24 km) or more to cast a ballot. The county has no public transportation options and no taxis, Uber or Lyft, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>Bolton told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution most voters usually cast their ballots during three weeks of early voting at a Lincolnton polling site.</p>
<p>Former President Donald Trump handily won the mostly Republican county during the 2020 election. About 28 percent of the county’s roughly 8,000 residents are Black.</p>

<a>drawn criticism</a> from Black legislators and the state’s civil rights department because they slash the number of seats where African Americans account for a majority of the voting-age population.
<p>The old maps had 15 such seats by the end of the decade: two in the U.S. House, two in the state Senate and 11 in the state House. Now there are seven, all in the state House.</p>
<p>Commissioners have said Black voters can still elect their candidates of choice without comprising at least half of a district’s electorate.</p>
<p>The suit, though, will allege violations of the U.S. Voting Rights Act and the Michigan Constitution. The No. 1 map-drawing criteria for the panel was to comply with the 1965 law, which bans discriminatory voting practices and procedures.</p>
<p>“As shared previously, we believe in the advice of our Voting Rights Act legal counsel that we comply with the Voting Rights Act,” commission spokesperson Edwards Woods III said.</p>
<p>The city had five state Senate districts. It will have eight under the new map, for instance, after new seats were combined with suburban areas in Oakland and Macomb counties.</p>
<p>She urged the Michigan Democratic Party “to stand with us” even if the maps are fairer to the party as a whole.</p>
<p>“This is unacceptable. We can do better than this,” Gay-Dagnogo said.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, if successful, would force the commission to revise the maps.</p>
<p>Lavora Barnes, chair of the Democratic Party, said she does not want to see the diversity of lawmakers diminished.</p>

<div><div><h1>Sports returned in 2021, but not the way we remembered them</h1></div><div>By EDDIE PELLSDecember 18, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<div><div>1 of 11</div><div><div>FILE - Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson signs autographs for fans before an NFL football game against the Los Angeles Chargers in Seattle on Aug. 28, 2021. (AP Photo/Stephen Brashear, File)</div></div></div>
<p>The fans came back, and even if their money was no good at arenas and stadiums, their credit cards and payment apps certainly were.</p>
<p>Nobody can take any of this for granted anymore.</p>
<p>That’s one of the many ways the COVID-19 pandemic carved away at the “old normal” in 2021, a year in which sports came back from the total shutdown the coronavirus triggered in 2020 — but not quite in the way we remembered.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>In Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>That led to a gender-equity study that called for a number of changes — in how the NCAA budgets for the tournaments and, yes, in what it calls them. The “March Madness” brand now belongs to the women, too.</p>
<p>In another change with roots in the pandemic, the days of elite athletes being judged solely on the titles they win, the points they score or the medals they bring home appear numbered — if not gone for good.</p>
<p>The face of that movement was gymnast Simone Biles, who, like so many other Olympians, extended her training an additional 12 months, while also enduring a year more of scrutiny and pressure in the leadup to the delayed Tokyo Games.</p>
<p>Overwhelmed by it all, Biles <a>stepped away in the middle of the gold-medal team competition</a>, and in doing so, changed the conversation for the rest of the Olympics, and the rest of sports.</p>
<p>“We also have to focus on ourselves, because at the end of the day we’re human, too,” Biles said shortly after her withdrawal.</p>
<p>The words shouldn’t have needed saying, but they did. Combined with <a>similar expressions from tennis champion Naomi Osaka</a>, they slapped an exclamation point on a long-under-the-radar discussion about athletes and mental health.</p>
<p>Not every change or gain or loss in the 2021 return to sports had to do with COVID-19.</p>
<a>tainted by a drug scandal</a>, then in December,
<a>the horse died during a training run</a> — a tragic series of events that underscored the drug (and other) problems long embedded in that sport.
<p>Elsewhere in the world of legalized sports gambling, the big-time American leagues all completely did away with the long-held charade that their games were being consumed simply for the fun of it.</p>
<a> it mushroomed into a $150 billion business, by conservative estimates.</a> Leagues such as the NFL, which for decades pretended gambling had no place in its game, went all-in and actively embraced some of the biggest sportsbooks as big-money sponsors.
<p>And while legalized wagering is changing the experience of watching a game, COVID-19 is changing the experience of going to one.</p>
<p>Practices were canceled. Games were called off. <a> Teams and leagues tried clamping down </a> with <a>more stringent vaccine and testing rules</a>.</p>
<div><div><h1>Supply shortages and emboldened workers: A changed economy </h1></div><div>By PAUL WISEMAN and DEE-ANN DURBINDecember 20, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>Employees at a fast-food restaurant in Sacramento, California, exasperated over working in stifling heat for low wages, demanded more pay and a new air conditioner — and got both.</p>
<p>Customer orders poured in to an Italian auto supplier, which struggled to get hold of enough supplies of everything from plastic to microchips to meet the demand. </p>
<p>A drought in Taiwan magnified a worldwide shortage of computer chips, so vital to auto and electronics production.</p>
<p>U.S. workers, having struggled for years to achieve economic gains, secured better wages, benefits and working conditions — and the confidence to quit their jobs if they didn’t get them.</p>
<p>Global supply chains that ran efficiently for years broke down as factories, ports and freight yards buckled under the weight of surging orders.</p>
<p>They had never, after all, had to manage the unpredictable fallout, economic and otherwise, from a global pandemic.</p>
<p>In June that year, the International Monetary Fund predicted that the global economy would shrink 4.9% for the year, the first drop in worldwide economic output since the 2008-2009 financial crisis. </p>
<p>“The U.S. has been a total outlier globally,” said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a global trade group for financial companies.</p>
<p>So despite immense federal spending and surging inflation, the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note — below 1.4%, as of early Friday — remains lower than it was before the pandemic. </p>
<p>Beginning earlier this year, vaccines accelerated the return to something much closer to ordinary pre-pandemic life.</p>
<p>Flush with government payments and, in many cases, savings accrued from working at home and from stock-market gains, people in rich countries were sitting on larger piles of cash and spending a lot of it.</p>
<p>In some ways, it’s been too much of a good thing.</p>
<p>The restaurant was also hampered by shortages of basic supplies like ceramic plates and glassware. Food costs fluctuated wildly. Halibut, which cost $14 a pound one day, was $24.99 a week and a half later.</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic, MTA, an auto components manufacturer that endured Italy’s first lockdown in February 2020, reopened within a week and ended 2020 with unexpectedly healthy business. But the recovery bred new troubles. </p>
<p>“Everything is lacking,” said Maria Vittoria Falchetti, the company’s marketing chief.</p>
<p>“Plastic is lacking. Metals are lacking. Paper is lacking. Microchips — don’t even mention. Also, we are struggling with a big increase in prices in these materials, and also energy,” </p>
<p>In Asia, manufacturers of everything from toys to cellphones suffered from a global shortage of computer chips and surging costs for components, raw materials and shipping.</p>
<p>Kaixiang Electric Appliance Co., which makes LED lamps and flashlights in Ningbo, south of Shanghai, paid 20% more in 2021 for labor, materials and complications resulting from shipping bottlenecks.</p>
<p>“The current delay in delivery is about one or two months,” said Susan Yang, CEO of the 80-employee company. </p>
<p>The supply chain problems have been compounded by what Kirkegaard of the German Marshall Fund calls “idiosyncratic things.”</p>
<p>At a Mobil station in Yonkers, New York, a gallon of regular gas was selling for $3.89. Mario Bodden, a project manager at a nearby mall, said it cost $50 to fill up, instead of the $35 he was used to.</p>
<p>“You start thinking: Do I go shopping? Do I fill it up today?” Bodden said. “Every trip is planned and targeted. So there’s a lifestyle change.”</p>
<p>A MADE-IN-AMERICA LABOR SHORTAGE</p>
<p>In Europe, by contrast, governments essentially paid companies to keep workers on their payrolls.</p>
<p>“In Europe, you didn’t have this fire-and-rehire response,” Kirkegaard said.</p>
<p>Keeping European workers on company payrolls, he noted, made it “much more seamless to reopen the economies in Europe because basically people just went back to their old job.” </p>
<p>American companies, by contrast, had to call back employees they had laid off or find new ones.</p>
<p>Workers in some cases gained a rare upper hand in negotiations over wages and working conditions. </p>
<p>Reyes said the store’s regional manager installed a new air conditioner and raised workers’ wages by $1.25 an hour.</p>
<p>“The increase was small, but every little bit helps,” she said.</p>
<p>American workers, as a whole, were hardly afraid to change jobs: 4.2 million of them quit in October, just off the all-time record of 4.4 million, set one month earlier.</p>
<p>She has endured ups and downs with periodic shutdowns during the pandemic. But she says she doesn’t regret anything. She earns “significantly more” than she did before, with work she enjoys far more.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a desire to return to corporate America,” she said. “I love doing what I’m doing.”</p>

<div><div><h1>Pro-Trump mob storms US Capitol in bid to overturn election</h1></div><div>By LISA MASCARO, ERIC TUCKER, MARY CLARE JALONICK and ANDREW TAYLORJanuary 6, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<a><div><div>1 of 15</div></div><div><div>1 of 15</div></div></a>
<p>Congress reconvened in the evening, lawmakers decrying the protests that defaced the Capitol and vowing to finish confirming the Electoral College vote for Biden’s election, even if it took all night. </p>
<p>Before dawn Thursday, lawmakers completed their work, confirming Biden won the presidential election.</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence, presiding over the joint session, announced the tally, 306-232.</p>
<p>Trump, who had steadfastly refused to concede the election, said in a statement immediately after the vote there “will be an orderly transition” of power on inauguration day.</p>
<p>“Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th,” Trump said in a statement posted to twitter by an aide.</p>
<p>Pence had reopened the Senate after the harrowing day and directly addressed the demonstrators: “You did not win.”</p>
<p>Hours later, Twitter for the first time time locked Trump’s account, demanded that he remove tweets excusing violence and threatened “permanent suspension.”</p>
<p>Trump spent the lead-up to the proceedings publicly hectoring Pence, who had a largely ceremonial role, to aid the effort to throw out the results. He tweeted: “Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!”</p>
<p>But Pence, in a statement shortly before presiding, defied Trump, saying he could not claim “unilateral authority” to reject the electoral votes that make Biden president.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, several Republicans announced they would drop their objections to the election, including <a>Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., who lost her bid for reelection Tuesday</a>.</p>
<p>Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., told reporters he was in the House chamber when rioters began storming it. Security officers “made us all get down, you could see that they were fending off some sort of assault.”</p>
<p>He said they had a piece of furniture up against the door. “And they had guns pulled,” Peters said. Glass panes to a House door were shattered.</p>
<p>Staff members grabbed boxes of Electoral College votes as the evacuation took place. Otherwise, said Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., the ballots likely would have been destroyed by the protesters.</p>
<p>The mob’s storming of Congress prompted outrage, mostly from Democrats but from Republicans as well, as lawmakers accused Trump of fomenting the violence with his relentless falsehoods about election fraud. </p>
<p>“Count me out,” said Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. “Enough is enough.”</p>
<p>Several suggested that Trump be prosecuted for a crime or even removed under the Constitution’s 25th Amendment, which seemed unlikely two weeks from when his term expires.</p>
<p>“I think Donald Trump probably should be brought up on treason for something like this,” Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., told reporters. “This is how a coup is started. And this is how democracy dies.”</p>
<p>Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., who’s at times clashed with Trump, issued a statement saying, “Lies have consequences. This violence was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the President’s addiction to constantly stoking division.”</p>
<p>The Pentagon said about 1,100 District of Columbia National Guard members were being mobilized to help support law enforcement at the Capitol. More than a dozen people were arrested.</p>

<div><div><h1>Biden urges concern but not alarm in US as omicron rises</h1></div><div>By ZEKE MILLERJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>“You can still get COVID, but it’s highly unlikely, very unlikely, that you’ll become seriously ill,” Biden said of vaccinated people.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Israel sets COVID-19 record amid zigzag policy and 4th jab</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Compared with last year, more Americans are employed, most kids are in classrooms, and instances of death and serious illness are down — precipitously so among the vaccinated.</p>
<p>“We’re in a very different place than we were a year ago,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki when asked if the country had lost control of the virus.</p>
<a>have seen dire warnings</a> about hospitals reaching capacity amid staffing shortages, thousands of holiday flight cancellations in part because crews were ill or in quarantine, and intermittent
<a>reports of school closures</a> because of the more-transmissible variant.
<p>While most schools across the country remain open, Biden took aim at those that have closed, saying he believes they have the money for testing and other safety measures. “I believe schools should remain open,” he said.</p>
<p>A senior administration official said that combined with other therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies and convalescent plasma, 4 million treatments that are effective against the omicron variant would be available by the end of January. </p>
<p>The pills are “a game changer and have the potential to dramatically alter the impact of COVID-19, the impact it’s had on this country and our people,” Biden said.</p>
<p>“On testing, I know this remains frustrating. Believe me it’s frustrating to me, but we’re making improvements,” Biden said.</p>

<p>Yet a year later, when it comes to a where-were-you moment in U.S. history, there is far from national consensus.</p>
<a>a recent CBS-YouGov poll</a>, 85% of Democrats called the riot an “insurrection” while only 21% of GOP voters did. Republicans (56%) were more likely to explain the rioters as “defending freedom.”
<a>A poll by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research</a> found that about 4 in 10 Republicans recall the attack — in which five people died — as violent, while 9 in 10 Democrats do.

<div><div><h1>‘We were trapped’: Trauma of Jan. 6 lingers for lawmakers</h1></div><div>By MARY CLARE JALONICKJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Long after most other lawmakers had been rushed to safety, they were on the hard marble floor, ducking for cover.</p>
<p>As danger neared, and as the rioters were trying to break down the doors, they called their families. They scrambled for makeshift weapons and mentally prepared themselves to fight. Many thought they might die.</p>
<a>an unprecedented assault on American democracy</a>. Along with a small number of staffers and members of the media, they remained in the chamber as
<a>Capitol Police</a> strained to hold back the surging, shouting mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump.
<li><div><a><h4>Recalling Jan. 6: A national day of infamy, half remembered</h4></a></div></li>
<p>The lawmakers were finally taken to safety roughly an hour after the siege began. </p>
<a>talked of being deeply shaken by their experience</a>, recalling viscerally the sights and sounds amid the chaos.
<p>And most indelibly, the loud clap of a gunshot, reverberating across the cavernous chamber. </p>
<p>“I’ve heard a lot of gunshots in my time, and it was very clear what that was,” Crow said. “I knew that things had severely escalated.”</p>
<a>Ashli Babbitt</a>, a Trump supporter from California who was trying to crawl through the broken window of a door that leads to the House chamber. Both the Justice Department and Capitol Police investigated the shooting and
<a>declined to file charges</a>.
<p>While the gunshot dispersed some of the violent mob, the lawmakers ducking in the gallery believed the worst was just beginning.</p>
<a>lies about election fraud</a> that were
<a>“fight like hell.”</a>
<a>“Hang Mike Pence”</a> as they forced their way into the Capitol, brutally overpowering police who stood in their way. Dozens were injured, some seriously, and four officers who were there that day later took their own lives.
<p>She shuddered when police said there had been a “breach” of the building. </p>
<p>She says she told a colleague sheltering with her in the gallery: “Just remember, we’re on the right side of history. If we all die today, another group will come in and certify those ballots.”</p>
<p>Congress reconvened that night, certifying Biden’s election victory before sunrise. </p>
<p>In the days after the attack, many of the lawmakers who were in the gallery started connecting on a text message chain. It quickly evolved into therapeutic group sessions and even potluck gatherings where they tried to make sense of it all. </p>
<p>They dubbed themselves “the gallery group,” and the name stuck. </p>
<p>“We were the last people in the chamber,” said Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, a former Navy helicopter pilot. “I think we saw the whole thing play out in a way that is very different from anybody else on the Hill.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers said the gallery group has been a refuge through it all.</p>
<p>The rioters were just inches from the doors of the gallery. </p>
<p>As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, Himes says he spends a lot of time in high-security spaces — and before Jan. 6, he had assumed the Capitol was one of them. </p>
<p>“It was as though you were watching water flow uphill,” Himes said. “Something that you imagined was impossible is happening right in front of your eyes.” </p>
<p>Kuster says that one of the most traumatic things for her was not being able to see what was happening outside the chamber. They could only hear “the noises of the threat — the pounding on the door, the shouting in the hallways.”</p>
<p>When she made it home two days later, she watched hours of video from the insurrection, including harrowing footage from the police battles outside the building. It only compounded the trauma. </p>
<p>“I remember my husband coming in, and I was just sobbing,” Kuster said. “And he was holding me, saying, ‘I don’t know if this is the best thing for you to see.’”</p>
<p>“But we have to — we have to acknowledge the reality of what happened that day. And what’s challenging for us is that we are both victims and witnesses to the crime on our country.”</p>
