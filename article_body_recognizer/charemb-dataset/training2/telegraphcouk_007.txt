<header> <h1> Gieves Hawkes in jeopardy as owner goes into liquidation </h1> <p> The Savile Row tailor, which dates back to 1771, is at risk of permanent closure </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Hannah Boland <time> 4 January 2022 • 1:26pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The future of Savile Row tailor Gieves Hawkes has been thrown into doubt after its Chinese owner was put into liquidation.</p>
<p>Trinity, which also owns the Kent Curwen brand, said this week that FTI Consulting and RH Services had been appointed as joint liquidators.</p>
<p>It said the liquidators were "considering the opportunity of a possible restructuring". </p>
<p>The business was placed into liquidation at the request of Standard Chartered following a failed attempt to find a buyer for the brands, the Times reported. </p>
<p>It means Gieves Hawkes, which has been trading for about 250 years, is at risk of permanent closure. </p>
<p>The brand has dressed royalty and high profile figures such as Sir Winston Churchill. Its history can be traced back to 1771 when Thomas Hawkes opened a store on Brewer Street selling military outfits to the Royal Navy and army. </p>
<p>Its best known <a>store is located at 1 Savile Row</a>, although the brand also has 60 other stores across the UK. </p>
<p><a>Gieves Hawkes has been owned by Trinity</a>, itself controlled by Chinese textile giant Shandong Ruyi Technology Group, since 2012. Its takeover was part of a major push by Shandong Ruyi into Europe, also snapping up brands such as Sandro. </p>
<p>In recent years, however, Trinity has struggled with debt levels and suffered a wave of staff departures. </p>
<p>The creative director of Kent Curwen, Daniel Kearns, left last year, while brand partner David Beckham stepped back in 2020 after it emerged that Kent Curwen had amassed £18m in losses. </p>
<p>According to the Times, Trinity still owes Mr Beckham millions over a licensing deal with that brand. </p>
<p>The business has also reportedly defaulted on bond payments. It was dealt a winding-up order last year, which it had launched an appeal against.</p>
<p>Despite the appointment of joint liquidators, a rescue deal could still materialise to save Gieves Hawkes. According to the Times, Marks Spencer remains interested in a potential deal for the tailor. </p>
<p>Trinity did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<header> <h1> Chinos replace suits in the City’s fight for top talent </h1> <p> The Square Mile is quietly reinventing itself – but will it revert to old habits after the pandemic finally ends? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Simon Foy and Lucy Burton, Banking Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 11:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>A quiet revolution has been taking place in the City of London - a place not historically accustomed to change. </p>
<p>Brown shoes, once deemed a social and professional faux pas with its own maxim “no brown in town”, are striking pavements from Southwark Bridge to Liverpool Street. </p>
<p>“It’s much more casual,” says Anna, who works at Steliana Tailoring near Bank tube station. “It’s nothing like it was before the pandemic.” </p>
<p>She says she has had the most orders to alter chinos in the past few months than in her entire 15 years as a tailor in the City. Some customers are even bringing in jeans.</p>
<p>The smart-casual insurgence points to a once-inflexible ecosystem adopting new ideas that were unthinkable before Covid struck and intensified the focus on mental health and work-life balance. </p>
<p>Staff are demanding a shake-up of the status quo, but will the Square Mile simply revert back to old habits once the pandemic recedes?</p>
<p>Of any Covid-induced policy, the shift to home and flexible working has caused the most disruption to the City norm. </p>
<p>Four-in-five City workers were back at their desks in the first week of December, according to Google data, though many only returned to the office midweek and stayed at home on Mondays and Fridays. </p>
<p>KPMG recently told its auditors they will be back in the office four days a week in the future, while PwC boss Kevin Ellis <a>kept its UK offices open over Christmas</a>. </p>
<p>But executives would be wrong to dismiss the shift in culture, with the pandemic having triggered a conversation about how to ensure a career in the City remains desirable for top graduates. </p>
<p>Many are increasingly looking for roles in the technology industry, where the pay is comparable and the work-life balance often better. </p>
<p>In a bid to find a solution, firms have started to introduce new policies to improve employees’ wellbeing. </p>
<p>Atom Bank has moved all 430 workers to a four-day week without cutting wages - in an industry first - while investment firm Hambro Perks has given staff almost four weeks of extra holiday to tackle pandemic burnout. </p>
<a>FinnCap is handing out as much holiday as desired</a>. Unlimited holiday policies have also faced criticism, however, for resulting in workers taking fewer days off.
<p>Octavius Black, chief executive of consultancy MindGym, is not convinced such benefits really do the trick. </p>
<p>“It's well-working. How do you set up the flow of work and the way people are led and managed that doesn't feel stressful and exhausting, but feels fun and exciting? So much of this is not the activity itself but the way we see it." </p>
<p>Not everyone agrees. The male-dominated banking sector has long been known for brutal working hours with a group of Goldman Sachs analysts earlier this year begging the investment bank to cap working weeks at 80 hours. </p>
<p>Some believe that allowing chunks of staff to work from home or take more time off will boost the sector by attracting a more diverse workforce. </p>
<p>City headhunter and former banker Kate Grussing argues some of these perks can be a "<a>real game changer for women</a>, especially working mothers". </p>
<p>"The ability to work from where and when it suits the employee has been proven to engender staff loyalty and productivity," she says. </p>
<p>"Flexible working in pre-pandemic days may have been thought of as a perk but now it is thought of as a sign of an enlightened company. </p>
<p>“Some people thrive in these environments, but firms need to provide a safe space for employees to raise concerns about excessive long hours,” she says. </p>
<p>Coronavirus has upended life in the Square Mile, as it has done in many other communities. But for those who have been around a long time, professional and social connections will in time drive workers back to the financial centre. </p>
<p>Hendrik du Toit, boss of FTSE 250 money manager Ninety One, says: “What I know is that people appreciate and yearn for the personal contact that was so radically reduced. </p>
<p>“It will be a less formal, more efficient version of the City that re-establishes itself after the pandemic. But it will not lose its heartbeat which is built around personal relationships and trust.”</p>
<header> <h1> Best-paid Clifford Chance partner takes home record £3.2m </h1> <p> Profit share for the magic circle firm's highest-earning lawyer jumped by a fifth last year amid a deals boom </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Simon Foy <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:18pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The top-earning partner at magic circle law firm Clifford Chance took home £3.2m last year amid a boom in City dealmaking.</p>
<p>According to accounts filed on Companies House, the profit share of the firm’s highest-earning lawyer jumped by a fifth compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Clifford Chance refused to confirm who netted the highest sum. In July, it announced that average pay for full equity partners rose 9pc to £1.85m each over the past year.</p>
<p>It came as demand for professional advisers reached unprecedented levels last year amid <a>a record 12 months for mergers and acquisitions</a>.</p>
<p>Clifford Chance's revenues from corporate clients jumped by a tenth to £603m during the year to April, up from £544m in 2020.</p>
<p>The London-based firm netted £2m from advising the European Super League last year, before the plan to drastically shake-up top flight football collapsed under a cloud of controversy.</p>
<p>It also advised financial heavyweights such as JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank during the period, as well as private equity giants including CVC Capital Partners.</p>
<p>The significant increase in demand for corporate lawyers has put a strain on staff working at firms across the City, with reports of junior staff in particular <a>experiencing burnout</a>. </p>
<p>A survey by Legal Cheek last October found that City lawyers were working increasingly longer hours, with associates at Kirkland Ellis working until 11.30pm on average.</p>
<p>Kirkland Ellis said it had brought in a psychologist and an addiction expert to help its staff.</p>
<p>Last month, Clifford Chance announced that Matthew Layton, the firm’s global managing partner for the past eight years, will be replaced by Milan-based Charles Adams in May.</p>
<p>It is the first time the magic circle firm will be led by a partner based outside the UK.</p>
<p>Clifford Chance declined to comment. </p>

<header> <h1> Six reasons not to buy a heat pump </h1> <p> Their costs are prohibitive, and much of Britain’s housing stock is not insulated enough </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Will Kirkman <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:22pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Heat pumps are currently the frontrunner to replace gas boilers over the coming decades as the country moves towards net zero.</p>
<p>The Government wants 600,000 of the devices installed each year by 2028, while gas boilers will be phased out. </p>
<p>But the decision has proved controversial: around four in 10 households do not support the boiler ban, according to research by Boiler Guide, a network of both gas and heat pump engineers.</p>
<p>Some 80pc of homes think the Government needs to offer more financial help to ease the transition. As things stand, households must pay much higher upfront costs to install the devices.</p>
<p>And although the technology is evolving, and is likely to improve significantly and fall in cost over the coming years, heat pumps are currently slower at heating cold homes than traditional boilers. </p>
<p>Here are six reasons why a heat pump might not be the best option for your home.</p>
<h2>1. The cost is prohibitive </h2>
<p>The main barrier to installing these devices for most homes is the disproportionately large upfront cost when compared to traditional heating systems.</p>
<p>A survey for the RSK Group, the services provider, found that on average the public believe heat pumps to cost around £3,290 to purchase and install.</p>
<p>The Government plans to offer households grants of £5,000 to help them switch to heat pumps. The grants, part of the "Boiler Upgrade Scheme", will begin in England and Wales next April and will initially run for three years.</p>
<p>However, just £450m in funding has been earmarked for the scheme, meaning only 90,000 homes will benefit.</p>
<h2>2. They are slower at heating homes</h2>
<p>Heat pumps only heat water to a maximum of around 65C, meaning houses that use them take longer to warm up.</p>
<h2>3. Better models will be available in the near future</h2>
<p>According to Boiler Guide, around 32,000 heat pumps were sold in Britain last year, far short of the Government's 600,000 target, and a tiny amount in comparison to the 1.6 million gas boilers installed over the same period. </p>
<p>In an interview with The Telegraph, <a>Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng conceded</a> that, while gas boilers had been "refined over many years … heat pumps are still in their infancy".</p>
<p>As the number of heat pumps installed every year will accelerate in the coming years, it is likely that the price of the devices will come down significantly.</p>
<p>As new models are developed, more efficient devices are also likely to become commercially available.</p>
<p>This means that households committing to a heat pump now may be at risk of jumping the gun, and may miss out on a cheaper and more efficient and effective device in several years' time.</p>
<h2>4. They might not work in your home</h2>
<p>Almost all houses can accommodate an air source heat pump, but a ground source device requires more land.</p>
<p>Not all flats will be compatible with air source heat pumps however, as the devices usually need to sit on the ground outside to work. This can be an issue for those living in terraced houses, where outside space may be limited.</p>
<p>Small flats may also lack the indoor space required <a>for the devices</a>, as large hot water cylinders are required. </p>
<p>In some cases, they can be mounted on a wall, but need to be somewhere accessible so that settings can be adjusted.</p>
<p>Air source heat pumps also generate some noise when working, especially in cold weather. </p>
<p>David Holmes of Boiler Guide said: “The important point to take away is that for the right property, an air source heat pump can be an effective low-carbon heating system. </p>
<p>"However, with so many ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ around the technology, there is no blanket solution to how we will heat homes in the future."</p>
<h2>5. They don't cut bills by very much</h2>
<p>The potential savings gained by installing a heat pump depends on what type of system it is replacing. </p>
<p>This is likely to change over the next decade. The Government plans to move green energy surcharges, which are currently applied to household electricity bills, on to gas bills. </p>
<p>Ministers are expected to phase in the changes over a period of up to 10 years, however, so for the foreseeable future gas will remain cheaper. </p>
<p>This means the heat pump generates one unit of heat for every one unit of electricity required to power the device.</p>
<p>Gas boilers have a lower coefficient of performance than this, at 0.85, but as gas is far cheaper than electricity, costs are roughly similar. </p>
<h2>6. They don't work well in poorly insulated homes</h2>
<p>When considering heat pumps, many households will have to also factor in the cost of properly insulating their home. </p>
<a>the devices work at lower temperatures</a> and so will struggle to get the house warm and keep it to temperature. They work better with lower temperature heating systems, such as underfloor heating.
<p>Around 25 million homes in Britain do not have adequate insulation. Bringing a poorly-insulated home up to scratch can cost thousands of pounds, but does eventually pay for itself in reduced energy bills.</p>
<p>To insulate a loft in a three-bedroom semi-detached home it can cost around £300 to £350. To add cavity wall insulation, the same home could expect to pay between £450 and £500.</p>
<p>External insulation and render can cost between £8,500 to £15,000 for a three-bedroom semi, and for internal insulation and plaster a home can typically pay between £5,000 and £7,000.</p>

<header> <h1> How to avoid inheritance tax: 7 legal loopholes to cut the cost </h1> <p> The top strategies used by the rich and famous </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Harry Brennan <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:22pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Inheritance tax is arguably Britain's most hated duty. But there are numerous ways around the divisive 40pc levy. </p>
<p>We list some of the ways you can cut your tax bill below, looking to the rich and famous for inspiration. </p>
<p>Some of the reliefs and exemptions used are common-sense strategies. Others are more elaborate. Crucially, all are entirely legal.</p>
<h2>1. Give away gifts of up to £3,000 tax-free</h2>
<p>Everyone in Britain can give away small gifts, such as Christmas or birthday presents, worth up to £3,000 tax-free.</p>
<p>This price cap is known as an annual exemption and can be carried forward to the following tax year, but only for one year.</p>
<h2>2. Downsize and give your children the cash </h2>
<p>Following Ronnie Corbett's death at the end of March 2016, it emerged that he had sold his family home in 2003 for £1.27m, reportedly to raise cash that could be given to his children without paying <a>inheritance tax.</a></p>
<p>He and his wife downsized into a local property worth around a fifth as much as their former home.</p>
<p>The buyer of the previous property, in which they had lived for more than 30 years, was reported saying the couple made the move in order to give money to their two grown-up children.</p>
<h2>Where it might not work</h2>
<p>You cannot give away an asset such as property and then continue to live in it without potentially running into "gift with reservation" rules.</p>
<p>You would need either to pay market rent to the new owners (probably your children) or find somewhere else to live.</p>
<p>Selling property and downsizing is, as well as a tax decision, also an investment decision: property might continue to grow in value more than cash.</p>
<p>In Ronnie Corbett's case, it might have been better to continue owning the bigger property and pay inheritance tax than to cash in and move to a smaller property.</p>
<h2>3. Use a deed of variation to pass inheritances on to your children</h2>
<p>This is a useful trick that's little understood and relatively little used. It involves the recipient of money or other assets in a will passing these assets straight on to another beneficiary.</p>
<p>This usually works where the first recipient already owns assets worth more than the £325,000 (£650,000 for a married couple) tax-free threshold.</p>
<p>When former MP Tony Benn died in 2014 it emerged that the ownership of his valuable home in west London had been split on the death of his wife in 2000, with the couple's children taking part-ownership.</p>
<p>Why? One possible answer is that the aim was to <a>reduce inheritance tax</a>.</p>
<h2>How it would have worked</h2>
<p>In 2000, the tax-free allowance was £234,000 per person (rather than £325,000 as today) but crucially in 2000 you could not add a married couple's individual allowances together, applying both to the death of the second spouse.</p>
<p>That generous extension was introduced only in 2007.</p>
<p>The Benns may have planned ahead carefully and constructed a will in which her share went to the heirs on her death.</p>
<p>This would mean her share of the home never entered his estate and her allowance was fully used, as if she had given the property directly to her heirs in her will.</p>
<p>A deed of variation along these lines requires the consent of every beneficiary mentioned in the first will, and needs to be completed within two years of the person's death.</p>
<h2>Where it might and might not work</h2>
<p>As with the first, this strategy runs into potential difficulty where – as with the Benns – it is used to pass on property wealth.</p>
<p>Mr Benn would have had to pay a market rent to the owners of his late wife's portion of the property, because he continued to live on in the house until his own death. </p>
<p>The grandparents' will can be changed via a variation to pass the assets straight on to other heirs (the grandchildren). That way the money skips the parents' estate altogether.</p>
<h2>4. Invest in 'Aim' shares and other IHT-proof assets</h2>
<p>To encourage long-term investment in certain assets, the Government grants them exemption from inheritance tax, as long as certain criteria are met. This has given rise to portfolios of IHT-proof assets being built.</p>
<p>Notable among these was the "<a>Aim share Isa portfolio</a>" created by the late Jim Slater, a celebrated investor and author, who wrote about the portfolio in his regular columns for Telegraph Money.</p>
<p>"Aim" shares are those listed on the junior Alternative Investment Market in London.</p>
<p>Some of these firms are very small. While they may grow into fantastically valuable businesses, they could also fail, losing shareholders everything.</p>
<p>Not all Aim shares escape IHT. They have to be held for two years and held directly by the individual – they cannot be held in a fund such as a unit trust.</p>
<p>This is because the relief – known as "business property relief" – was originally intended to prevent those inheriting a business from having to sell assets to pay the tax. It requires a direct stake in a business.</p>
<p>Companies qualify only if they meet certain criteria. But there’s no definitive list to check and the taxman makes a judgement on whether a company is exempt only when the tax is due.</p>
<h2>5. Write a will – failure to do so could leave you with an avoidable IHT bill</h2>
<p>Where there is no will, assets are handed out according to a set of rules laid down in legislation. This could land you with a tax bill.</p>
<p>This may have happened when Rik Mayall, the comedian and actor behind nasty MP Alan B'Stard, failed to have a valid will in place when he died unexpectedly in June 2014.</p>
<p>The probate records revealed the lack of a will relating to his £1.2m estate.</p>
<p>Where – as possibly the case with Rik Mayall – a married parent dies without a will, a portion of their assets go straight to their children, triggering a potential tax liability when the assets exceed the threshold.</p>
<p>Had a will been written, more or all of the assets could have been given to the surviving spouse, leaving time in which to give them away or make other arrangements to reduce the eventual bill at the death of the second partner.</p>
<h2>6. Capital gains tax: hang on to your assets and die owning them</h2>
<p>If people sell valuable assets or investments other than their family home or Isas, capital gains tax is often due on the profits they've made.</p>
<p>In the past, families have decided it is better to pay this and <a>give the money to their heirs</a> ahead of their death in order to avoid inheritance tax.</p>
<p>But the "family home allowance", which extends the overall inheritance tax allowance for couples up to £1m from 2020, has given a bit of scope to avoid both IHT and CGT.</p>
<p>Capital gains tax liabilities die with you. This means the new higher £1m inheritance tax threshold has opened up new opportunities for cutting not just death duties but CGT bills too.</p>
<p>Not everyone will qualify for the additional allowance. It will not be available to those without children, or to many business owners. Estates worth more than £2m will also have their allowance tapered away.</p>
<h2>7. Stuff your pension full of cash – but don't spend it</h2>
<p>This is easier said than done, but it's worth knowing about. Money inside a pension can be bequeathed IHT-free.</p>
<p>So for those with different sources of wealth, it could pay to spend non-pension income in retirement while leaving your pension pot intact.</p>
<p>Where there are other major assets that would attract IHT, such as second homes or shares or business assets, it might also make sense to sell these and live off the proceeds while the pension is untouched.</p>

<div> <div> By Louis Ashworth <time> 3 January 2022 • 6:25pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The omicron variant of Covid has triggered a wave of bets against the pound amid fears that the Bank of England will move slowly to tackle soaring inflation fuelled by the energy crisis.</p>
<a>the highest level since October 2019</a> when Parliament was wracked by a series of crunch votes on Brexit and £4.5bn was positioned against the currency.
<p>It suggests that international markets became increasingly gloomy about Britain's prospects as fears grew over <a>a massive wave of staff absences</a> following the rise of omicron.</p>
<p>The Cabinet Office has warned public sector bodies to prepare for up to 25pc of employees to be off work in the worst case, and economists are predicting that <a>GDP will suffer a hit of up to £1bn</a> from self-isolation rules this month.</p>
<a>a surprise increase to 0.25pc</a> in December.
<p>Threadneedle Street has signalled its determination to tackle a surge in inflation after the consumer prices index climbed by 5.1pc in November, its biggest jump for a decade.</p>
<p>However, markets are less convinced than they were that policymakers will hold their nerve and go ahead with another rate rise at their next meeting in February.</p>
<p>Investors were pricing in a 91pc chance of a hike on Christmas Eve, but this has since fallen to 76pc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, inflation is expected to get even worse this year as energy costs start to increase following a surge in the wholesale price of gas.</p>
<p>Analysts have warned the pound is particularly vulnerable to the power crisis, as well as the potential for the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates faster than Threadneedle Street, which would encourage investors to buy dollars.</p>
<p>Sterling hit its weakest level for more than a year in December, touching $1.317 after Boris Johnson's plans to implement “Plan B” Covid curbs came to light.</p>
<p>It has since recovered to a little under $1.35, but is still below the level of more than $1.38 hit in October when it seemed as if Britain was decisively moving on from Covid.</p>
<p>Derek Halpenny, head of research at MUFG, said speculators were more likely to be concerned about the potential for further disruption, damaged confidence and new restrictions than the spread of the virus itself.</p>
<p>He said: “It's the economic implications that would be foremost in the minds of traders."</p>
<p>Josh Mahoney, of trading platform IG, said markets have been looking beyond the case figures and this helped fuel the recovery in the pound from last month's lows.</p>
<p>Mr Halpenny emphasised that moves this close to the end of December could reflect thin levels of market activity, which can increase volatility, as well as investors adjusting ahead of 2022.</p>
<p>He said: “I'm always very, very wary of putting too much of a fundamental link to price action in the last couple of weeks of the year.”</p>
<header> <h1> Firms 'hang on by their fingernails' as Covid loans fall due </h1> <p> Battered by omicron and Plan B restrictions, companies now face the challenge of paying back what they borrowed to get through the crisis </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tim Wallace <time> 4 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Before Covid, Alexandra Slaney’s family business was “ticking over very nicely”.</p>
<p>Her four staff were busy caring for customers’ cars - high-end detailing and paint correction services were particularly popular among drivers who wanted their motors looking their best.</p>
<p>But when the pandemic first hit, vehicles were parked up in garages for months on end and face to face services stopped altogether.</p>
<p>“When lockdown came in we had to close down one half of our business - online selling continued. But overheads don’t halve when your revenue does,” she says.</p>
<p>“So we started to eat into our savings.”</p>
<p>Even after lockdown, drivers were more cautious and sales did not fully rebound.</p>
<p>“By the time we got to the end of the year we needed to borrow money in order to be able to continue functioning,” Slaney says.</p>
<p>Her business, Elite Car Care in Buckinghamshire, borrowed £150,000 through the Government’s Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme as a result - an unprecedented amount for a company that had previously taken on little debt.</p>
<p>“We weren’t very comfortable with the idea of getting into debt, but it seemed like the only option,” she says.</p>
<p>The problem is that the scheme was designed to get businesses through Covid - supposedly a short interruption before normal service resumed. But as 2022 dawns, the economy is still a long way from normal.</p>
<p><a>Inflation is now at a decade high of 5.1pc</a>, with a further increase likely. And at the same time, offices are once again all but empty and footfall has dropped sharply as cautious consumers stay at home to avoid the omicron variant of Covid.</p>
<p>It is now a year since Elite Car Care took out its loan and repayments are due. Slaney has negotiated with the bank to pay interest only for a time, but that is still £1,100 per month out of her reduced revenues.</p>
<p>She is not the only one.</p>
<p>Government-backed loans amount to almost £80bn, mostly in the form of bounceback loans.</p>
<p>By and large, big companies borrowed heavily then rapidly repaid the funds when it turned out they could withstand the hit.</p>
<p>By contrast, SMEs took on more than £46bn of extra debt, boosting their burden by more than one-quarter between March 2020 and March 2021.</p>
<p>That debt mountain has declined by only around £5bn since then.</p>
<h2>Firms cling on as support ends</h2>
<p>Retailers, pubs and restaurants in particular hoped a fully fledged spending boom at Christmas - spurred on by families and friends desperate to make up for last year’s lost time - would restore their fortunes and eat into the debt mountain.</p>
<p>But the economy is not yet fully recovered, omicron trashed Christmas party plans and support is being withdrawn already, meaning companies risk having to bear this burden with little extra help.</p>
<p>Furlough is over. Companies like Slaney’s are already making loan repayments, and more will start soon as their year’s grace comes to an end.</p>
<p>The VAT break for hospitality is being withdrawn.</p>
<p>A moratorium on winding up orders ended in September, but there are still restrictions on filing.</p>
<p>Business rates ramp up further from the end of March. At the same time the moratorium on the eviction of commercial tenants ends, to be replaced with a new arbitration system. </p>
<p>Even before omicron spoiled the festive season, the Bank of England warned these extra costs could threaten businesses.</p>
<p>“If that shoe is to drop at some point over the next few months, we might see unemployment rise as a consequence of microbusinesses going through that process.”</p>
<p>Julie Palmer, at insolvency group Begbies Traynor, says she is starting to notice a pickup in terms of signs of distress among businesses, particularly since the courts reopened, enabling creditors to take action on debts.</p>
<h2>Companies face wave of collapses</h2>
<p>Insolvency numbers are still below their pre-Covid levels, but she has identified 800,000 companies which are feeling the strain.</p>
<p>Normally 20,000 a year fail, she says - so if only 10pc of those apparently at risk go under, that is still four-times the normal run rate.</p>
<p>Palmer sees inflation as one key threat, driving up businesses’ costs. Rent arrears are another, with a moratorium on evictions due to end in March.</p>
<p>Data from consultancy Remit indicates unpaid commercial rents totalled £7.4bn between the start of the pandemic and the end of 2021.</p>
<p>Not all of those have to be repaid. Landlords know forcing tenants into bankruptcy is bad for long-term business, particularly when they might struggle to find new occupiers for city centre properties in a pandemic.</p>
<p>Dominic Curran at the British Retail Consortium says that the overwhelming majority of retailers and landlords have sought to reach a deal on arrears.</p>
<p>He expects that in the region of 85pc to 90pc of arrears will have been reduced through negotiations, with reductions of anything up to 50pc of bills racked up during the period of closures, often in exchange for a longer lease.</p>
<p>Bounceback loans have also had their terms extended by the Chancellor.</p>
<p>But not all debts can be negotiated down and the risk is that a fresh Covid slump combined with the withdrawal of help tips more companies over the edge.</p>
<p>City centre businesses and the hospitality industry are particularly vulnerable, says Martin McTague at the Federation of Small Businesses.</p>
<p>Many companies have been “hanging on by their fingernails”, he says, and hoping for a strong end to the year as Christmas can account for 50pc of their annual profits.</p>
<p>Although the results have yet to come in, most companies' chance of a solid festive performance is likely to have been wrecked by omicron and government warnings that the public should be cautious.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mr McTague, says, there are also “businesses that have bizarrely done well out of Covid, beneficiaries of changes in behaviour”.</p>
<p>That points to a fundamental shift in the economy. If the business environment has permanently changed to be more digital and less focused on city centres, companies will have to adjust and that will mean some closures.</p>
<p>Back in Bourne End, Slaney is already adapting.</p>
<p>But that can only get the company so far if Covid is still rampant.</p>
<p>“All we can hope for is that as the economy gets back on its feet, people will get more confident in spending again.”</p>
<header> <h1> Ballooning £40bn trade deficit with China raises fears of British dependency </h1> <p> Lockdown surge in demand for electronics helps drive imbalance higher </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Helen Cahill <time> 4 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Britain's trade deficit with China has more than tripled during the pandemic after successive lockdowns sparked a wave of spending on electronic goods.</p>
<p>The UK imported £40.5bn more from China than it exported to the country in the year to June 2021, according to data from the Department for International Trade, a huge increase from the £11.8bn deficit in the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>The imbalance was driven by a 38pc surge in goods imports from China, while UK exports also declined by 34pc.</p>
<p>The figures will raise concerns about China's growing influence in Britain amid fears over national security.</p>
<p>The British population has also been spending less in restaurants and shops on local high streets.</p>
<p>"And that has been a phenomenon seen across a number of advanced economies, and it has really helped Chinese exports.</p>
<p>"UK exports to China have also fallen sharply. I suspect this is related to <a>weakness in the Chinese economy</a>, but also the spending of domestic Chinese consumers might be weighed towards the electronics and goods required to work from home."</p>
<p>He warned the Chinese economy would take a knock when the pandemic recedes.</p>
<p>Mr Ashworth said: "In general, there's no doubt China has had difficulties with supply chain issues and the difficulties sourcing materials."</p>
<p>Lord Purvis of Tweed, a Liberal Democrat spokesperson for international trade, said the surge in the trade deficit had weakened Britain's influence on human rights issues in China.</p>
<p>He said: "It's become apparent that the Government is taking us on a very worrying journey of becoming heavily dependent on China for trade in goods, and moving away from our nearest market in Europe.</p>
<p>"We are now very dependent on <a>imports of goods from China</a> over which we have no leverage whatsoever. In fact, quite the reverse.</p>
<p>"And therefore when it comes to debating issues such as human rights, our opportunity as the UK is considerably weaker. I think from the UK's point of view this is now a geopolitical issue that we need to be airing a lot more."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson raised concerns about alleged human rights abuses in the country's Xinjiang province in an October call with the Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>It is thought that more than a million Uyghur Muslims have been interned in forced labour camps in the region. China has denied the claims. </p>
<p>"We support the right kind of globalisation - one that generates economic value for all and is based on free enterprise, human rights and rule of law."</p>
