<h3>Does it need to be forged?</h3>
<h3>What's better: a Japanese or Western knife? </h3>
<p>The advantage of a softer steel is that it's easier to hone and keep in top condition. A good Western knife will range from about 56 to 58 on the Rockwell scale, while a Japanese might go up to 64 (hard and brittle, so they can chip easily). </p>
<p>Harris, though a big fan of Japanese knives, agrees they're more high maintenance: "the blades are thinner, they require more care, and you can't sharpen them on a steel, unless you want to mess them up." </p>

<header> <h1> The best places to start a family with good primary schools and green space </h1> <p> Our four-part series finds the best places to buy a home in England at every stage of life, from first-time buyers to downsizers </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:24pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>When house hunting for a young family, the "must have" list gets much longer than first-time buyers' needs.</p>
<p>Parents planning moves with small children need <a>good local schools,</a> low crime rates, good healthcare, and access to green space and fresh air. Combine these together and it's likely you'll have to pay a premium. </p>
<p>But there are areas across England which tick all these boxes and offer value for money. </p>
<p>Savills estate agents has devised a metric for <a>househunters with small children</a>. It analysed English local authorities in the top half of the deprivation index, which ranks areas by factors such as life expectancy.</p>
<p>These are the best places to buy in every region in England.</p>
<p>Craven, which sits on the south-west side of the Yorkshire Dales National Park and the eastern edge of the Forest of Bowland AONB, was top in the country for home buyers with small children. The average house price was £280,166.</p>
<p>Mark Kane, of Dacre, Son Hartley estate agents in Skipton, said half of buyers have children. </p>
<p>Three quarters of buyers are already local to Yorkshire, but 25pc are relocating, primarily from the South East, said Mr Kane.</p>
<p>North of Craven is Eden in Cumbria, which was the top hotspot in the North West for buyers with young children (and was also the top-performer in the country for first-time buyers, <a>which we covered last week</a>).</p>
<p>Northumberland came up top in the North East. The average price here was £233,201.</p>
<p>Shropshire, which sits on the border with Wales and encompasses the Shropshire Hills AONB, was top in the West Midlands. Homes were cheaper here, at £285,193.</p>
<p>Emma Romaine-Jones, of Fine Country estate agents in Shrewsbury, said: “The market has been insane. If I put a property on, I will have 15 or 20 viewings booked within hours.”</p>
<p>Above the £1m mark, buyers in their 30s and 40s with young children are flocking from Kent, Essex and Chelsea and Wimbledon in London, said Ms Romaine-Jones. Prices of these high value homes have climbed by 15pc.</p>
<p>The supply of available properties has been depleted. “I have one property I am about to put on the market, and everything else has sold or is going through exchange. Normally we would have five to 10 available,” she added.</p>
<p>Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire ranks top nationally for those families looking exclusively in urban locations. Homes cost £664,981, and trains run direct from Maidenhead to London Paddington in 24 minutes.</p>
<p>Nicholas Canham, of Hamptons estate agents in Windsor, said 40pc of buyers were moving out from west London areas such as Chiswick, Ealing, Richmond and Twickenham.</p>
<p>St Leonard’s Hill, south-east of Windsor, is particularly popular with relocators as the detached houses have gardens and off-street parking. Prices of this type of property have jumped 20pc since the pandemic started, said Mr Canham. </p>
<p>“The market for apartments is a bit more challenging,” he added. Owner occupiers are avoiding properties with no outside space, while landlords are selling up in the wake of the Government’s tax crackdown.</p>
<p>Local state schools include The Queen Anne, Trinity St Stephen’s Church of England First School and Oakfield First School.</p>
<p>The rural local authority of South Hams on the Devon coast was top in the South West and ranked third in England. Homes cost £445,078. </p>
<p>Dacorum, which encompasses Hemel Hempstead, was the East of England hotspot, with average prices at £508,506.</p>
<p>London boroughs had fewer well-rated schools compared to other regions, but better healthcare. There were 5.3 hospitals, dentists and GPs for every 10,000 residents in Merton, one of the highest ratios in the country.</p>

<header> <h1> Buy-to-let property vs stocks and shares: where is best to invest £50k? </h1> <p> Would your cash fare better invested in the property or stock market? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Rachel Mortimer <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:25pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>In the not-too-distant past, regulatory red tape and punishing tax changes sounded the death knell for the buy-to-let market as landlords sold up and left. </p>
<p>But the sector has enjoyed an unexpected recent revival, however, thanks to savings made under the stamp duty holiday and rising rents bolstering investor returns. </p>
<p>But buying and renting a property can be a complicated process that involves a lot of management and high costs such as stamp duty and legal fees. Would it be easier and more lucrative to invest in the stock market?</p>
<p>Telegraph Money has crunched the numbers to see whether £50,000 would perform better invested in properties or companies over a typical 10-year period.</p>
<p>Soaring house prices mean landlords with a £50,000 budget would need to be savvy when choosing where to buy. Investors will be priced out of the likes of London and the South East, for example. </p>
<p>Using their £50,000, a landlord would need to set aside £2,500 for fees and would then need to borrow £147,500 in order to purchase a four-bedroom property worth £190,000.</p>
<p>In this example first-year profit would be £4,638, rising to £6,225 in the final year. The overall profit would be £54,106.</p>
<p>However, <a>renting a property is rarely that easy.</a> Most landlords have void periods – the time between one tenant leaving and the next arriving – when they do not have rental income.</p>
<p>If the property in our example was left empty for two months each year, the returns would be more than a third lower. Profits would be £2,938 in the first year, reaching a total of £35,406 at the end of the decade.</p>
<p>However, these profits could be enhanced by underlying growth in the value of the property. The house price boom of the past year has resulted in exceptional growth, but even in more normal times property values tend to increase over the long term.</p>
<p>In our less successful scenario, the landlord would have made £74,485.</p>
<p>Would landlords be better served by investing in the stock market instead? Here you eliminate the risk of void periods of problem tenants, but returns depend on how much risk you are willing to take. </p>
<p>AJ Bell, a fund shop, analysed two potential outcomes. In the first scenario, our investor <a>placed their cash in company stocks</a>, which have historically returned 5.3pc per year, based on data from the past six decades.</p>
<p>A £50,000 sum invested in this way would return £2,525 in the first year. By the end of the decade, thanks to compounded growth, our investor would have a pot worth £81,833.</p>
<p>Both scenarios assume stockbroker charges of 0.25pc are applied. In this example the case study had invested directly in companies; if they were to invest in funds then management charges would also have to be deducted.</p>
<p>Those looking to avoid risk altogether can keep their money in cash, but even the best savings accounts struggle to beat inflation. An account paying 0.6pc interest would grow £50,000 into just £53,082 over the 10 years, AJ Bell said.</p>
<p>By contrast, the best stock market scenario would return a profit of just £31,833.</p>
<p>The stock market investor could protect themselves from the taxman by using an Isa, but the investment would have to be spread over a number of years given the annual allowance is currently £20,000.</p>
<p>Investing in the stock market is a much more hands-off affair, but average returns are subsequently lower.</p>

<header> <h1> What’s behind the record-breaking rise in global art market sales? </h1> <p> It remains to be seen whether demand continues to grow this year – and if traditional masterworks can survive the assault of new sectors </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Colin Gleadell <time> 4 January 2022 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The question now is whether these elements can continue to grow through the omicron crisis or whether last year’s trends were founded only on short-term speculation. Will the whole market run out of steam, or just sectors of it? </p>
<p>In more general terms, Asian demand will be a key factor. Last year, Christie’s made $1.68 billion of sales to Asian collectors, up </p>
<p>32 per cent on 2019. Sotheby’s hit a record $1.3 billion of sales in Asia saying that, on average, Asian collectors are ready to bid double than buyers from elsewhere.</p>
<a>Rothko</a>, Pollock and Giacometti from the divorce settlement between Harry and Linda Macklowe realised an above estimate $676 million, making it the biggest ever single-owner sale Sotheby’s has ever conducted. 
<p>The continuing debate as to the value of NFTs compared to these masterworks is probably one of the few things we can rely on to happen this year.</p>

<header> <h1> Elizabeth Holmes, the female Steve Jobs whose 'medical miracle' fooled America </h1> <p> College drop-out turned self-made billionaire invented a revolutionary blood test that never worked. Now she's facing decades in prison </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Mick Brown <time> 4 January 2022 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>This piece was first published on August 21 but has been revised to take account of the trial verdict.</p>
<p>The trial was scheduled to start in August 2020, but was delayed by Covid and then by Holmes’s pregnancy – she gave birth to a son, William, in July.</p>
<h4>A compelling idea which could 'save US healthcare'</h4>
<p>Holmes was born in Washington, DC. Her father Christian was a vice-president at the scandal-hit energy company Enron and later worked for a variety of government agencies. Her mother Noel had also worked in government.</p>
<p>In 2004 she dropped out of college, and set up Theranos (combining the words ‘therapy’ and ‘diagnosis’). Within six months she had raised $6 million to finance the company.</p>
<p>The patch idea was quickly abandoned as unfeasible. Instead, Holmes switched her attention to developing a device that would revolutionise blood testing.</p>
<p>The problem, it would become apparent over time, was that they didn’t. Despite more than 10 years of research, the Edison machine would never end up working.</p>
<h4>‘She wanted fame and money and she would stop at nothing to get it’</h4>
<p>Her other-worldly appearance created a mystique around her. She had piercing, saucer-shaped, doll-like blue eyes and never seemed to blink. She lowered her voice by an octave to lend gravitas.</p>
<h4>Smoke and mirrors, and staff sworn to secrecy </h4>
<p>This was ostensibly to protect trade secrets. But it also concealed the fact that the technology was defying any attempts to work as advertised, and that Holmes’s claims for its efficacy were becoming increasingly fanciful.</p>
<p>Yet despite the setbacks and the dysfunctional culture in Theranos, Holmes seemed bulletproof.</p>
<h4>The one percenters in her thrall</h4>
<p>But the claim was untrue. The Edison was able to provide only a small fraction of the tests that Theranos claimed it could.</p>
<p>Holmes assured Walgreens that the technology was ‘viable and consumer-ready’. But that claim was false. Only a single Theranos test, for herpes, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
<h4>'A big unauthorised research experiment'</h4>
<p>One Theranos employee, appalled at the deception, described going live in Walgreens as being tantamount to ‘exposing the general population to what was essentially a big unauthorised research experiment’.</p>
<h4>‘The story was great, and still would be great if it were possible'</h4>
<p>Clapper’s blog led <a>Carreyrou </a>to investigate Theranos, setting him on the trail of employees who had left, or been fired from, the company, and who provided damning allegations against Theranos.</p>
<p>Kathrein was reminded of someone.</p>
<p>He had litigated on behalf of investors in the legal actions against the late Bernie Madoff, the American financier who in 2009 was found guilty of defrauding his clients of almost $65 billion in the largest Ponzi scheme in history.</p>
<p>Three months later, the US Attorney for the Northern District of California announced the indictment of both Holmes and Balwani on wire fraud and conspiracy charges.</p>
<h4>An accomplished fraudster - or an idealist?</h4>
<a>expectations meant investors knew what they were getting into</a>, and that Holmes was acting in good faith, believing the Theranos technology would work.
<p>So was Holmes really an accomplished fraudster, or simply an idealist who truly wanted to save the world, but who fell into a hole – and just kept digging?</p>

<h1> JK Rowling should be a national treasure - so why have so many spent a year destroying her? </h1>
<p> Twenty years after the first Harry Potter film, the most successful author of her generation has been 'cancelled' – how did it come to this </p>
<div> <div> By Mick Brown <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:12am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The tribunal judge ruled that the belief, expressed by Forstater, that biological sex is immutable, and that it is impossible to change one’s sex, was “incompatible with human dignity and fundamental rights of others.”</p>
<p><a>The sluice gates opened</a> – and it’s fair to say that since then they’ve never closed.</p>
<p>Last month, three trans activists posted photographs of themselves on social media staging a protest outside what could clearly be identified as Rowling’s Edinburgh home.</p>
<p>Social media groups set up to target Rowling lit up with abuse: “JK Rowling is a liar”, “JK Rowling is trash”, and “jk Rowling I am about to dress like myself to K!ll you” and “Rot in Hell”.</p>
<p>The three activists, meanwhile, posted a message saying that while “we stand by” the photo they were removing it because of the “overwhelming amount of serious and transphobic messages” they had received.</p>
<p>How has it come to this?</p>
<p>She married for the second time in 2001 to a Scottish doctor, Neil Murray, and she has two more children with him.</p>
<p>How then could a woman whose contribution to the sum of human happiness, and in particular to the welfare of women and children, have found herself the victim of a virulent hate campaign?</p>
<p>Look no further than social media.</p>
<p>Trans activists leapt on Rowling’s ‘like’, but the vitriol was nothing compared with the deluge that followed her tweet in support of Forstater.</p>
<p>The tweet, she says, escalated her own case to a matter of international attention, bringing a huge social media backlash.</p>
<p>In America, Variety reported it as an “anti-trans tweet”. The social media sluice gates collapsed.</p>
<p>“However, the scars left by violence and sexual assault don’t disappear, no matter how loved you are, and no matter how much money you’ve made.</p>
<p>Even those who owed Rowling the most – the young actors whose careers had been made by Harry Potter – turned on her.</p>
<p>Watson followed suit, tweeting: “Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are.”</p>
<p>Grint tweeted: “I firmly stand with the trans community. Trans women are women. Trans men are men. We should all be entitled to live with love and without judgement.”</p>
<p>Roger Sutton is editor-in-chief of The Horn Book, America’s leading journal on the subject of children’s fiction.</p>
<p>It makes you wonder, if JK Rowling was submitting the manuscript for the Harry Potter books today, would they be published?</p>

<header> <h1> How households can help protect the environment in 2022 </h1> <p> If your New Year's resolution is to be more eco-friendly, this is how you can reduce your carbon footprint at home </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Jess Salter and Raven Saunt, Evergreen Content Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 2:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Many of us have decided that in 2022, we will make more of an effort to do our bit and help protect the environment, but it's not always easy knowing where to start.</p>
<p>But these grand gestures aren't all that can be done to help the environment. Here, we have compiled a list of easy steps you can take from the comfort of your own home to reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
<h2>How to help protect the environment </h2>
<a>Energy Saving Trust</a>, if we all only boiled as much water as we needed (rather than boiling and reboiling) we could save enough energy to power all the UK’s streetlights for seven months. 
<h2>Find alternative sources of electricity</h2>
<p>Along with solving the problem of the dog poo and reducing the need for plastic bags (there are free paper bags available on the site), Harper says it has reduced the need for waste collection “in a diesel-powered lorry”.</p>
<h2>Use refillable containers</h2>
<p>Single-use plastic is an ever-growing problem – 700,000 plastic bottles are littered every day in the UK. One commercial response is to sell water in cans and cartons. But these aren’t actually any better for the environment. </p>
<p>“All materials have environmental impacts which could result in different environmental burdens of some kind,” Libby Peake, head of resource policy at independent think tank Green Alliance, which focuses on green policies, says.</p>
<h2>Invest in renewable energy</h2>
<p>Perhaps it is time to consider utilising renewable energy resources such as solar, wind or hydro energy. </p>
<p>In the wake of Cop26, Harry Roberts, managing director of <a>My Favourite Cottages</a>, issued guidance on how to make homes more sustainable.</p>
<p>It is also important to check all your appliances have an A++ energy rating, as these are more eco-friendly and cost efficient in the long run.</p>
<p>We often get told to turn off the taps when we are brushing our teeth so we don't waste water. But how seriously should we actually take the advice? </p>
<p>Well, on average, each person uses about 142 litres of water each day, which combined with the increasing pressure on natural resources, means the UK could face water shortages by 2050.</p>
<p>To prevent wastage, households can install water-efficient shower heads, low-flow taps and even dual flush toilets (which use four-six litres compared to standard 13 litres). </p>
<p>Plus, it is possible to opt for modern energy and water-efficient appliances to help control the use of water and reduce your water bills. </p>
<p>Generating a big impact always starts with implementing the smallest changes.</p>
<p>Families can start by switching to eco-friendly soaps, washing up liquids and detergents that are free from any harmful chemicals or pollutants. </p>
<p>This article is kept updated with the latest advice.</p>
