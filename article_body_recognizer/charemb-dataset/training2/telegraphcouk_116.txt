<header> <h1> Insomnia rises during lockdown as people over-think sleeping habits </h1> <p> Doctors report spike in sleep disturbance among adults during Britain's coronavirus restrictions </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lizzie Roberts <time> 31 March 2021 • 6:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Insomnia has risen due to lockdown because people have had too much time to think about their sleeping habits, experts have suggested.</p>
<p>In the first lockdown, half of UK adults said their sleep was disturbed more than usual, a study by King's College London found. A year on, doctors, sleep experts and specialist sleep disorder clinics say the <a>problem still persists</a>.</p>
<p>"I have seen a massive increase in sleep-related problems, both directly and indirectly related to Covid," he told The Telegraph.</p>
<p>At the London Sleep Centre, patients presenting with insomnia have also increased significantly in the last six months, according to Heather Darwall-Smith, a psychotherapist at the Harley Street clinic.</p>
<p>But Joseph Gannon, the chief sleep physiologist at the Sleep Disorders Clinic, also on Harley Street, said people have become "more aware" of their sleeping habits during lockdown, which is causing them to seek help.</p>
<p>"People sort of become quite hyper-aware of their own habits", he said, adding that people who often work away from home are now also noticing the sleeping habits of their partner more.</p>
<p>Colin Espie, a professor of sleep medicine in the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Oxford, is undertaking research to assess the UK's sleep during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Staycationers have camped out overnight in the cold and rain in a rush to book a beach hut for the summer. </p>
<p>With just 12 cabins available at Avon Beach in Christchurch, Dorset, people went to extreme lengths to make sure they got a booking for either the summer holidays or all-year rental.</p>
<p>Staff arrived at the beach shop at 7.30am on Sunday to find people already braving the elements, though they were not available to book until 8am on Monday, more than 24 hours later.</p>
<p>The queue grew through the day, with dozens camping out overnight and about 50 people waiting by the time the administration office opened on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The huts, which mostly measure 6ft by 4ft, cost £3,570 to rent for the year and are typically booked up within minutes of opening.</p>
<p>Avon Beach has 130 huts lining the quiet sandy beach, which is popular with dog walkers, tourists and watersport enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Some of the huts change hands privately for as much as £80,000 and have gas-powered fridges and gas hobs inside.</p>
<p>This year, there were 40 huts available for different periods of the year and just 12 for the full summer holidays or whole year.</p>
<p>One of the first in the queue was Ken Ryder, 72, and his partner Jan Manton, 70, who arrived at 4am on Sunday and waited 28 hours, the sixth year they queued for a hut.</p>
<p>Mr Ryder said: “You read books and chat – that’s all you can do to pass the time. My wife came down from 8am until 10 yesterday morning so I could go and get breakfast, then she came back from 12 until 2pm and I stayed overnight.</p>
<p>“The reason we retired here was to be close to the beach and having a hut is just the icing on the cake.”</p>
<p>Nicola Davies arrived at 4am on Monday morning to secure a hut after promising her grandfather that she would get one for the whole family before his death in November.</p>
<p>Laura Huxtable-White, a beach hut manager, said: “They are very sought after, which is why people are willing to queue up for so long. We have tried to be careful and asked people queuing to be mindful of social distancing.</p>
<p>“With the pandemic and staycations, I think people are even more keen to get one this year. In lockdown last year, the phones were extremely busy and yesterday we had a lot of calls from people checking they have the right date.”</p>

<header> <h1> Where the ‘staycation’ boom has destroyed Britain’s rental markets </h1> <p> The supply of rental properties in many popular locations has collapsed </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 11 September 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Investors rushing to profit from the British staycation boom have helped to destroy <a>rental markets</a> in holiday home hotspots, leaving tenants with <a>nowhere to live</a>.</p>
<p>The supply of rental properties in many <a>popular locations</a> has collapsed because buy-to-let investors have moved long-term lets on to the <a>short-term market en masse</a>.</p>
<p>Exclusive data from property website Rightmove showed that the supply of long-term rental properties on the Isle of Wight in June and July had plunged by 82pc compared with the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>This means that less than a fifth of the properties that were available to rent before the pandemic are now on the market.</p>
<p>“Now we leave a rental property online for an hour, and that will generate 30 inquiries.”</p>
<p>Renters are also asking to sign longer-term tenancy agreements, which in turn has put further pressure on supply, added Lawrence Williams, of agent Webbers Property Services in Devon and Cornwall.</p>
<p>Sarah Coles, of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “You need to be armed with the best possible references and have a spotless payment record, or you will lose out.</p>
<p>“It means that anyone who had to ask for help from their landlord during the crisis could find themselves struggling to find a new place to live.”</p>
<p>Data from property management site Guesty showed prices of September short-term let bookings were up by 54pc on the same period in 2019. Those booking Christmas stays were already spending 44pc more.</p>

<h1> Why you should put football rivalries aside and visit the Czech Republic when travel resumes </h1>
<div> <div> By Kirsten Powley <time> 22 June 2021 • 3:34pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>In 'normal' times Prague is heaving. Long popular within Europe, in 2018, it saw 7.9 million visitors, including 6.7 million from overseas – a year-on-year increase of 26 per cent. </p>
<p>First up, go outside of peak season. That means avoiding Christmas and summer in favour of spring and autumn. The city will be just as beautiful, and the residents considerably less stressed. </p>
<h5>Five options in the Czech Republic</h5>
<h3>1. Český Krumlov</h3>
<p>This South Bohemian city can get a bit crowded too, but its 800,000 visitors a year is a mere pinprick compared to Prague’s annual intake. </p>
<h3>3. Mariánské Lázně </h3>
<p>Naturally there are the hot springs to visit for some pampering, but the town throws up a series of other treats, the highlight of which is the Colonnade, an architectural delight, along with pristine parks. </p>
<p>East Bohemia is the only region of the Czech Republic not to have increased visitor numbers in recent years, and Pardubice, known for its gingerbread and the second longest steeplechase in Europe, is the biggest city in these parts. </p>
<h3>5. Děčín</h3>
<p>Most enchanting is a ride down the Kamenice River (in a kayak or boat), where you’ll pass moss covered cliffs and waterfalls. </p>
<h5>And two beyond its borders</h5>
<p>The Czech Republic shares much of its border with Germany, so it’s only natural to turn here when looking for further travel inspiration. Leipzig is an up-and-coming city break option and a perfect alternative to both Prague and Berlin. </p>
<p><a>Tina Walsh explains the new found appeal of Leipzig</a>: “Old factories and warehouses are being repurposed as art galleries and exhibition spaces and a young, dynamic workforce throngs its stylish cocktail bars at night.”</p>
<h3>7. Košice, Slovakia</h3>
<p>What’s more, Košice works as a good base to see some of Slovakia’s more natural attractions, such as the High Tatras, Slovak Karst National Park and Tokaj wine country. </p>
