<p>Ben Allen completes the acting quartet as John England, nicely tilting between dependability and disreputability. Like the folk songs it so delights in, the play deserves to endure. Still, you never know, best catch it while you can.</p>

<h1> I learned you can’t be fit and fat – when I finally lost weight by eating less </h1>
<p> I’m living proof that eating less is the only way out of obesity. Despite exercising regularly, I remained fat until I had a freak mishap... </p>

<p>A woman who was forced to flee her home when a volcanic chimney formed in her back yard, has revisited her property a month later using footage from a drone. </p>
<p>The Cumbre Vieja volcano, which started spewing lava on September 19th 2021 on La Palma in the Canary Islands, lasted for 85 days and came to an end on 13th December.</p>
<p>A month after evacuating her home, Amanda Melian wanted to check on the site, so she contacted a local audiovisual company, which had been flying drones to record images of the apocalyptic scene.</p>
<p>“I would never have imagined that the volcano I was fleeing from was just under my house!” Ms Melian told El Diario.</p>

<header> <h1> 'Healthy' mushroom beer – a craft beer too far? </h1> <p> A strange new fungi-fuelled brew is coming soon to a bar near you. But does it taste as strange as it sounds? </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Pete Brown <time> 5 January 2022 • 11:59am </time> </div> </div>
<p>What does beer taste like?</p>
<p>It’s a simple enough question. But most people who drink it would struggle to expand on “Well... like beer.”</p>
<p>How do you follow that? Well, how about a mushroom beer?</p>
<p>Not for the first time, I repurposed the classic line from Jurassic Park: “Your brewers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.”</p>
<p>And then I thought about the flavours you get in mushrooms: nutty, earthy, sometimes bitter, sometimes gently sweet. And I thought, these are some of my favourite flavours in a well-made beer. So I did some digging (not literally). </p>
<p>Zoey Henderson was a consultant to the hospitality industry when the Covid pandemic hit. Suddenly there was no hospitality industry, so no consultancy, and she needed to find something else to do. </p>
<p>The health benefits of functional mushrooms – different from both ‘magic mushrooms’ and edible mushrooms – have been familiar to people in the Far East for centuries. </p>
<p>Well, not mushrooms. These are beers, brewed with barley and hops, with about half an ounce of mushroom in each 330ml bottle.</p>
<header> <div> Review </div> <h1> Volkswagen Taigo review: the small SUV with big ambition </h1> <div> <div> 4/5 </div> </div> <p> This is a fine-driving small crossover although VW’s exploration of sub-niches seems to know no bounds </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Andrew English, Motoring Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 12:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Does the world need another supermini SUV? Probably not, although they are the fastest growing segment in the UK, where SUVs of all sizes are a third of the cars on our roads. For Volkswagen, all SUVs occupy 36 per cent of its UK sales.</p>
<a>Vauxhall Mokka</a>, which are all style leaders shifting huge numbers and VW wants a slice of it. In fact, this car has been built and sold in Brazil as the Nivus since May 2020, although we will get our Taigos from VW’s Pamplona plant in Spain.
<p>The Taigo went on sale in November and first deliveries are scheduled for the first quarter of 2022.</p>
<p>At a distance, the Taigo looks long and stylish, with a pleasingly angular mien and a sloping roofline. Get closer, however, and it looks bitty, with rather too many seams.</p>
<p>Safety kit includes adaptive cruise control with VW’s new travel assist tech with automatic stop and go, AEB, lane-change assist, front and rear parking sensors, dual-zone climate control and LED headlights. </p>
<p>The ride is typical of the MQB chassis; refined and precise, as if the car was riding on oiled bearings. </p>
<p>The steering moves with a flawless accuracy, which would give an enormous confidence were it not for the winter tyres, which set up a gentle roar on every road surface and softened the front-end grip. </p>
<p>Telegraph rating: Four stars out of five</p>
<p>On test: Volkswagen Taigo R-Line 1.5-litre TSI 150 PS DSG. </p>
<p>Body style: five-door crossover coupé</p>
<p>On sale: now (first deliveries in spring)</p>
<p>How much? £29,725 (range from £22,450)</p>
<p>How fast? 132mph, 0-62mph in 8.3sec</p>
<p>How economical?46.4mpg (WLTP Combined), 35mpg on test</p>
<p>Engine gearbox: 1,498cc, four-cylinder turbo petrol with seven-speed twin-clutch DSG gearbox, front-wheel drive</p>
<p>Maximum power/torque: 148bhp @ 5,000rpm/184lb ft @ 1,500rpm</p>
<p>VED: £220 first year, then £155</p>
<p>Warranty: 3 years / 60,000 miles</p>
<p>Spare wheel as standard: yes (spacesaver)</p>

<header> <h1> The best slow cookers for warming autumnal recipes </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Madeleine Howell <time> 11 November 2020 • 2:02pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>They're all perfectly safe to leave on overnight or while you're out, so you can have beef bourguignon, creamy porridge or even mulled wine ready and waiting.</p>
<a> Nadiya Hussain's slow-cooker mushroom lasagne</a>, 
<a>Xanthe Clay’s slow cooker duck confit with garlic</a> and Amelia Freer’s 'Bottom of the fridge' slow cooker
<p>Scroll down for everything else you need to know about the nutrient-retaining, energy efficient wonders of slow cooking.</p>
<ul> <li>See also: Telegraph Recommended's review of the <a>best air fryer</a></li> </ul>
<p><b>Why we like it: </b>A slow cooker suitable for all hob types with a chemical-free ceramic coating and a classic look</p>
<p><a>£99, Lakeland</a></p>
<p>The pot is oven safe, so it doubles up as a faster-cook casserole dish.</p>
<a>best frying pan</a> on the market). However, it’s not recommended for the dishwasher, lest you damage the coating - instead, wash the bowl and lid by hand with warm, soapy water, and it cleans like a dream.
<h3><b>2. Lakeland 6 litre family slow cooker</b></h3>
<p><a>£39.99, Lakeland</a></p>
<p><b>Why we like it: </b>The best things in life are simple, and this large slow cooker is just that</p>
<p>A simple dial on this plus-sized slow cooker allows you toggle between three settings: low, high and auto heat. Since it’s a particularly straightforward gadget to navigate, it’s less likely to be left to gather dust in my household.</p>
<p>Auto is the standard setting, with an average cooking time of 6-8 hours: it cooks the food on high until the correct temperature is reached, then keeps it warm until ready to serve (use low to extend the cooking time, or high to shorten it). </p>
<p>See also: Telegraph Recommended's review of the <a>best rice cookers</a></p>
<h3>3. Morphy Richards Accents 3.5l sear and stew slow cooker</h3>
<p>Why we like it: Easy to use and well sized for cooking for two (with leftovers)</p>
<p><a>£32.99, Argos</a></p>
<p>With the usual three standard settings – high, low and medium – and a capacity which produces around three or four surprisingly generous portions, this slow cooker does what it says on the proverbial tin.</p>
<p>I used it to make a chilli. The sear and stew function meant it was easy to heat some oil and brown my mince first on the hob (the removable cooking pot is compatible with most hobs, with the exception of induction).</p>
<ul> <li><a>Telegraph Recommended's best pressure cookers</a></li> </ul>
<a>£14 from Robert Dyas</a> (ceramic bowl, three heat settings, dishwasher safe). The autocook function is brilliant: it does the work of judging the progress of your food for you.
<p>It’s not suitable to use on the hob, and the ceramic cooking pot shouldn’t be placed on any surface affected by heat. A trivet or an insulated pad is recommended.</p>

<h3>What is the benefit of slow cooking?</h3>
<h3>What can be cooked in a slow cooker?</h3>
<p>In short... everything. Slow cooking food is healthy and tasty and it's not dangerous to leave your favourite foods simmering away. </p>
<p>That being said, we did learn some valuable tips and tricks while reviewing the products in our test kitchen. In no particular order... </p>
<li>Insert a meat thermometer into joints of roasts, hams or whole chickens to ensure they are cooked to the desired temperature</li>
<li>When selecting meat, look for the leanest cuts. Trim any visible fat from the meat because the slow cooking process will result in too much liquid in the form of fat.</li>
<li>Pre-browning meat and poultry prior to cooking seals in the moisture, intensifies the flavour, and provides more tender results.</li>
<li>Root vegetables and potatoes take longer to cook than meat and should be thinly sliced or placed near the sides or bottom of the cooking bowl, because of their starchy cellular structure.</li>
<li>Not everything benefits from the slow cooker: while slow cooking turns tough joints tender, it can render lean cuts leathery, and more delicate vegetables like courgettes and peas can end up mushy.</li>
<li>Use whole leaf herbs for a fuller, stronger flavour</li>
<li>There’s no direct heat at the bottom, so generally it’s best to fill your slow cooker at least half full for even cooking</li>
<li>Use canned or fully pre-cooked kidney beans; dried beans should always be fully cooked before added to a recipe</li>
<li>Thaw frozen food completely before adding it to the cooking pot</li>
<li>To cook fish in a slow cooker, grease the base with butter, clean and trim the fish, season and sprinkle with lemon juice, add stock, water or wine and cook on a low heat.</li>
<li>Always make sure an appliance is unplugged and has cooled down before attempting to clean it.</li>
<header> <h1> The best juicers for fresh fruits and vegetables </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Madeleine Howell <time> 5 August 2020 • 3:25pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Juicing can be a convenient, delicious way to increase your intake of fruit and vegetables, and squeeze more goodness out of the contents of your fridge.</p>
<p>But what's the best juicer for you? And is juicing really worth all the extra washing up?</p>
<p>You may already know the difference between juices and smoothies (if not, FYI, juicing is the process of extracting the liquid content from fruit and vegetables, while a smoothie is made by blending whole fruits and vegetables together)</p>
<p>But do you know the difference between centrifugal juicers and cold-press masticating juicers? No? Well, these things matter in the world of juicing.</p>
<p>A masticating juicer methodically squashes and pounds the liquid out of foods. It tends to be more expensive and produce cleaner, calmer juice.</p>
<p>A centrifugal juicer uses a fast revolving, spinning blade (much like a home blender) and a mesh to separate the juice from the pulp. It's s fast, noisy, and its juice can be quite frothy.</p>
<p>I'd note at this point that starchy fruits such as mangoes, papayas and bananas are unsuitable for juicing; think oranges, apples and grapes instead.</p>
<blockquote><p>Due to problems arising from the Covid-19 lockdown, some of the products tested in this article may temporarily be unavailable for online order. </p></blockquote>
<h3>1. Smeg retro-style masticating slow juicer</h3>
<p>Why we like it: Efficiently produces a high yield of great tasting juice</p>
<p><a>£499, Curry's</a></p>
<p>I started with four apples (500g) and found they produced 300ml of juice – 75ml per apple; a decent quantity compared to other juicers in this list. </p>
<p>My only quibble? The mouth of the main tube isn't very wide, so you have to chop the produce a bit before pushing it in. Still, that's hardly disastrous; and the clean, clear, crisp juice you get at the end is well worth the elbow grease.</p>
<h3>2. Sage by Heston Blumenthal NutriJuicer</h3>
<p>Why we like it: It's fast, fast, fast</p>
<p><a>£179, Amazon</a></p>
<ul><li><a>Telegraph Recommended's best Nutribullets</a></li></ul>
<p>The jug provided is large; useful if you're juicing enough for a large family.</p>
<p>My favourite centrifugal option, overall.</p>
<h3>3. electriQ HSL600 slow masticating cold-press juicer</h3>
<p><a>£79.97, Appliances Direct</a></p>
<p>Slightly annoyingly, the feeding tube is very small, so you have to do a lot of chopping (unless you're juicing small fruits like grapes). Still, not bad for under £60.</p>
<h5>Frequently asked questions about juicers</h5>
<h3>How healthy is juicing?</h3>
<p>Meanwhile, claims that juicing will 'detox' the body are, by nature, ridiculous: the body 'detoxes' itself naturally with the liver, kidneys and colon.</p>
<p>So has juicing had its day? Is there any science to back up the benefits of juicing? What about those of us who simply adore the taste of a glass of OJ in the morning? We asked<a> Harley Street nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert</a> for the facts.</p>
<p>Wherever you stand on the juicing debate, there's no denying that there's a host of delicious beverages to be served with the help of a juicer - so I won't be letting mine gather dust just yet.</p>
<header> <h1> The best toasters, tried and tested </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 1 March 2019 • 4:52pm </time> </div> </div>
<ul><li>See Telegraph Recommended's look at the best bread makers and <a>toasted sandwich makers</a> on the market</li></ul>
<p>All the toasters we tried have wide slots, so if you are looking for a bagel toaster or simply like thickly sliced bread, they should work fine.</p>
<p>Here's our pick of the best toasters on the market, starting with our favourite. </p>
<h3>1. Dualit Classic 2-slice toaster </h3>
<p>Why we like it: A classic design, ultimate control, and as durable as a tank.</p>
<p><a>£122.99, Amazon</a></p>
<a> toasters</a>. From his home in south London, he sets about inventing what will eventually become one of the trendiest pieces of kitchen equipment around. And one of the very best, too.
<p>(Incidentally, Gort-Barten was German – as were many of the best engineers of the time – though he fought for the British army and, evidently, made a massive contribution to our post-war effort.) </p>
<p>You can choose to only switch on one slot, to save energy, which is handy – or to get a bagel that's well toasted on the outside, but squidgy inside.</p>
<p>(A colleague of mine says he replaced the timer and a worn-out filament in his in-law's ancient Dualit, and it now works just fine. He also says he did this despite being "completely useless at DIY".)</p>
<p>Aside from all the techy stuff, it's worth noting that with the Dualit you'll get a very even, consistent toast across all types of breads, partly because its filaments heat at a slightly lower, more controlled heat than other toasters.</p>
<p>There are also <a>four-slice</a> and<a> six-slice</a> options available. </p>
<h3>2. Sage the Smart Toast 2-slice toaster </h3>
<p>Why we like it: Useful functions set it apart </p>
<a>Heston Blumenthal</a>, so you wouldn't expect anything less. Apparently, you should toast from frozen (while it doesn't necessarily taste better in my opinion, it does help reduce food waste). 
<p>While the device heats up quickly, the bottom remains touchable. The only downside was the crumb tray, which is placed on the side – a little less convenient than the front-placed Dualit crumb tray. </p>
<div> <amp-ad> </amp-ad> </div>
<div> <div> <h3>3. Russell Hobbs Retro red 4-slice toaster </h3> <p>Why we like it: Retro design and affordable </p> <p>£49.99, Currys PC World </p> </div> </div>
<p>Overall, I found this Russell Hobbs toaster to be very good value, but not as impressive or sturdy (it was a tad rickety) as the Dualit and Sage. </p>
<h3>4. Magimix 2-slot Vision toaster </h3>
<p><a>£160, Amazon</a></p>
<p>The glass door can be opened by pressing a button, for cleaning, which helps on hygiene. The machine heats up pretty quickly, so be careful. </p>
<h3>5. Morphy Richards Evoke 4-slice toaster</h3>
<p><a>£39.99, Amazon</a></p>
<h3>6. Smeg TSF0I 2-slice retro style toaster</h3>
<p>I'm a big fan of the retro, '50s design of this Smeg toaster. Reheat and defrosting settings work fine, and there's a bagel function too, but the crumb tray on the side is a little inconvenient. There are six heat settings.</p>
<p>It does emit a lot of heat, so after a few toastings the machine was roasting. There are a few reports online of it malfunctioning after a few months.</p>
<h3>7. Tefal Toast N Egg toaster</h3>
<p><a>£34.99, Argos</a></p>
<p>It evidently looks gimicky, but if a device is promising toast and egg in one, you've got to try it, haven't you?</p>
<p>My first impression was that this is a mammoth-sized toaster, but that's largely due to the boiler attached, where you cook the eggs, or even beans if you wish. </p>
<p>Back to the drawing board on this one.</p>
<div> <blockquote><div> <p> <a>Will toast for money</a></p> <p>A post shared by <a> Tomé Morrissy-Swan</a> (@tmorrissyswan) on <time>Aug 7, 2018 at 3:00am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> </div>
<h3>What to look for in a toaster? </h3>
<p>Tempting as it may be to opt for the cheapest toaster on the market, remember that it's likely to be one of your most-used kitchen appliances, so it's worth investing a little more on a durable model that will last. </p>
<a>toastie pockets.</a> Another key feature to look out for is a crumb tray, which helps to keep your kitchen clean.

<header> <h1> Novak Djokovic visa: 'Australia doesn't deserve a grand slam' – how the world reacted </h1> <p> Scott Morrison insisted that 'rules are rules' but the decision to cancel the Serb's visa has provoked fury and ridicule </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Sport <time> 6 January 2022 • 3:51am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Novak Djokovic is set to leave Australia on Thursday after he was dramatically denied entry to the country, a move which has dashed his hopes of defending the Australian Open title this month.</p>
<a>granted a controversial “medical exemption”</a> by the Australian Open organisers, and the announcement on Thursday that the world No 1 is set to be deported has provoked fury and ridicule.
<p>Australia's prime minister, Scott Morrison, <a>insisted on Thursday mornin</a>g that Djokovic had not been "singled out" for scrutiny but had merely failed to provide sufficient proof to receive a medical exemption to enter the country. </p>
<p>Mr Morrison said: "Rules are rules, especially when it comes to our borders."</p>
<p>Djokovic, who has <a>said he is “opposed to vaccination”</a>, has never declared whether he has been vaccinated against Covid, a requirement to enter Australia.</p>
<p>In a statement, Australia's Border Force said: "Djokovic failed to provide appropriate evidence to meet the entry requirements to Australia, and his visa has been subsequently cancelled.</p>
<p>"Non-citizens who do not hold a valid visa on entry, or who have had their visa cancelled, will be detained and removed from Australia."</p>
<h2>'Australia doesn't deserve to host a grand slam'</h2>
<p>In the tennis world, Djokovic's exemption had provoked a backlash and the cancelling of his visa only caused more confusion ahead of the start of the Australian Open on Jan 17.</p>
<p>Some were angry that tennis is being used as a political tool.</p>
<p>US player Tennys Sandgren said: "Just to be crystal clear here, two separate medical boards approved his exemption. And politicians are stopping it. Australia doesn't deserve to host a grand slam."</p>
<p>Djokovic also found support from the US, where popular Fox News host Laura Ingraham accused Australia of becoming a "police state", while Nigel Farage accused Australia of being a "banana republic".</p>
<div> <blockquote><p>Australia is a COVID police state. It doesn’t deserve Djokovic.</p>— Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) January 6, 2022</blockquote> </div>
<h2>'The whole of Serbia is with him'</h2>
<p>The world No 1's treatment has provoked anger in his native Serbia as the incident now threatens to become <a>a diplomatic crisis</a>.</p>
<p>Serbia's president, Aleksander Vucic, said "our Novak" was a victim of "harassment" and said "the whole of Serbia" supported him.</p>
<p>He said: "I told our Novak that the whole of Serbia is with him and that our bodies are doing everything to see that the harassment of the world's best tennis player is brought to an end immediately.</p>
<p>"In line with all norms of international law, Serbia will fight for Novak, truth and justice. Novak is strong, as we all know."</p>
<p>Djokovic's father, Srdjan, said his son had been detained in a room at the airport and guarded by police.</p>
<p>"This is not just a fight for Novak, but a fight for the whole world," he said in a statement released to the media.</p>
<h2>'Above all, it is incredibly funny'</h2>
<p>Aside from the anger at the farcical situation created by Australian officials, many people took the opportunity to laugh at a very public comeuppance for an anti-vaxxer.</p>
<p>Ryanair tweeted a mock-up review of Djokovic's visa as if by a tennis line judge – and then pitched to fly him home:</p>
<div> <div> <p>Djokovic is <a>not the world's most popular sport star</a> at the best of times and many revelled in the schadenfreude:</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Sebastián Torok, an Argentina-based sports writer, suggested Djokovic's rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal might have had something to do with the decision:</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Some people found joy in Djokovic's special exemption being taken away:</p> </div> </div>
<p>The important thing to remember about Novak Djokovic being denied entry to Australia after spending a day in the airport thinking he was more important than everyone else is that it is incredibly funny.</p>— TechnicallyRon (@TechnicallyRon)
<div> <div> <p>Emma Kennedy, the English actress and Celebrity MasterChef champion, said she hoped there was proof of Djokovic's exit:</p> </div> </div>

<div> <div> By Joe Pinkstone, Science Correspondent <time> 12 October 2021 • 12:47am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The amount of false positive coronavirus lateral flow tests has increased in secondary school children, official data show.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence of children receiving a positive lateral flow and then a negative follow-up PCR have circulated on social media and numbers from the UK Health Security Agency indicates the phenomenon is indeed on the rise.</p>
<p>Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at the newly-minted UKHSA, has said the body is aware of the trend and is “looking into the cause”.</p>
<p>However, 1,112 (8 per cent) of these pupils returned a negative or void follow-up PCR, indicating the lateral test result was a false positive.</p>
<p>One week later around 580,000 secondary school students took a lateral flow test and almost 16,000 were found to be positive.</p>
<p>Of these tests, 87 per cent (13,863) were later confirmed via PCR, with 13 per cent — or around one in eight — coming back as negative or void.</p>

<p>“The UK Health Security Agency’s (UKHSA) chief medical adviser, Susan Hopkins, has noted that the organisation is looking into the issue.</p>

<header> <h1> No rehearsal, no warning: the West End stand-ins saving our Christmas theatre </h1> <p> As stars and their understudies fall ill with omicron, meet the veterans and alumnae who are keeping the show on the road </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Susannah Goldsbrough <time> 28 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The life of a jobbing actor is infamously precarious. But even the hardiest thespian might expect to be given more than three hours’ notice – and perhaps a rehearsal or two – before going on stage.</p>
<p>But this Christmas, as Omicron skittled through the casts of West End shows, taking out not just the leads but in some cases multiple understudies, notice periods and rehearsal time became more luxuries than essentials.</p>
<p>“It was a really, really quick turnaround. I had a costume fitting, they decided what to do with my hair [there was no time for a wig fitting] and then I was just going over my lyrics, hoping they would stick.”</p>
<p>“It was like living through an anxiety dream – the one you have as an actor where you don’t know the lines, you don’t know what’s going on,” he says.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘I’ll put it to the director and see what he says’. And Doug [director Douglas Rintoul] said, ‘Let’s get her in tonight.’”</p>
<p>“It’s a big role. I mean, it’s Jasmine in Aladdin. There are a lot of lines, a couple of big duets with Aladdin, and a lot to navigate – trying not to knock anyone or get in anyone’s way,” she says.</p>
<p>Even with a script in-hand, how on earth did she manage it? “Luckily I’d seen the show twice and I’ve got a very good sponge memory, so I know a lot of the tunes.”</p>
<p>Even so, at one point she almost walked off-stage at the crucial moment where Jasmine notices the magic lamp. “That would have entirely ruined the plot.”</p>
<p>“It humbles me,” he said. “The courage, the brilliance, the dedication, the talent. The swings, the understudies, they are the bedrock of Broadway.”</p>
<p>But, as bizarre as the experience of filling in at very short notice is, Sillett points out it isn’t entirely out of keeping with an actor’s typically hectic lifestyle.</p>
<p>“We epitomise crazy, crazy schedules, living out of suitcases and not knowing if we’re here or there. This is the ultimate version of it.”</p>
<p>For Kennedy, it was an emotional evening. “You can see just how delicate and precarious the situation is for theatre and the arts at the moment. It was surreal. I feel like I could sleep for weeks.”</p>

<h1> Janice Long was a human dynamo but had to put up with incredible sexism at Radio 1 </h1>
<p> The first female DJ on Radio 1 pays tribute to the second, who blazed a trail through a stuffy broadcaster - from Liverpool to TOTP </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Annie Nightingale <time> 27 December 2021 • 6:30pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Rarely in my life have I been so happy to welcome a new member of the team to Radio 1 as I was to welcome Janice Long when she joined the station at the end of 1982. Finally, after 12 years, I was no longer the only female DJ. </p>
<p>But what the listeners didn’t know at the time was that Janice and I were working in a culture that was still incredibly sexist – a culture whose origins could be traced all the way back to the founding of Radio 1 in 1967.</p>
