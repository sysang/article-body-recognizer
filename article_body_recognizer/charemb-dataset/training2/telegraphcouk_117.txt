<p>These are indeed worrisome times – and so, by way of reassurance, I’d like to tell you about my granny. She was, you see, quite wonderful. And in that regard, she was perhaps rather like you. Let me explain…</p>
<p>Granny was made of the same stuff as her husband and believed in doing the Right Thing. She christened her Morris Minor “Nelson” – for it too must do its duty.</p>
<p>My first expedition was not to Central Africa but Dorset – I was only aged 10. Off I went with my mum and dad in the family camper van and along the cliffs sought fossils – chiefly ammonites and belemnites.</p>
<p>“What you need is a proper hammer,” announced my granny, as I spilt the fruits of my first adventure on her rug.</p>
<p>“Disgraceful!” my granny said, when I reported back. “And I see that it’s made in Germany. Typical of their workmanship.”</p>
<p>I was marched back through Chalfont St Peter. “This hammer…” Granny said to the man in the brown overalls.</p>
<p>“What about it?”</p>
<p>“Evidently, it’s not up to the job.” She proffered the two pieces.</p>
<p>He looked at them. “So?”</p>
<p>“So, we’ll want a replacement.”</p>
<p>I hid as best I could. I knew what was coming.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry,” Granny began. “Should I fetch a doctor?”</p>
<p>“Fetch a doctor. Because you’re obviously under the weather. Otherwise you wouldn’t be behaving in THIS FRANKLY APPALLING MANNER.”</p>
<p>The gentleman brought out a replacement. I still have it.</p>

<p>There's nothing quite like the great outdoors, is there? Those soaring eagles, that molten sunset spilling over the boundless horizon. Personally, I can’t wait to head off into the blue.</p>
<p>Not long afterwards, I was out there among the sands and all was not going well. “Only a month to go,” I muttered to myself reassuringly as I trudged along, alone but for my three camels.</p>
<p>That realisation grew, as we plodded on: at night, hamsters were to be found scurrying about. The rodents had a fondness for my muesli, as it turned out. Soon I was staying awake just to watch them lug away choice nuts.</p>
<p>And that, to me, is the value of the great outdoors: being able to view the horizon and being placed in a position to value what is important around me as I stride towards it.</p>

<p>For it emerged that going through the ceremony brought about certain privileges – not enough, some would say – and one such privilege was ­female companionship. </p>
<p>She dropped out of the darkness like a bat. And, actually, the girl was quite a catch – much admired on account of her generous dimensions and puce nail varnish. She was known as the Typist.</p>
<p>“Oh Wumbunavan,” she began cooing, using my honorary name. “Wumbunavan, I think we will evermore be together” – or romantic words to that effect. She began undressing.</p>
<p>“Evermore?” I thought.</p>
<p>And now here was the Typist ­already down to her underwear, and I could virtually hear her delighted relatives assembling with their brushwood.</p>
<p>Until two nights later, when the next girl turned up.</p>

<p>I too might have been put off, if it wasn’t for the forlorn bloke I saw proffering brochures fronted by Machu Picchu in all its Andean magnificence. The temptation was just too great. </p>
<p>Such marvels, if they are to resonate through the ages, should ideally radiate their pre-eminence by standing aloof from the everyday – and it’s hard for them to do this when trampled by the seething hordes. </p>
<p>Again I was able to believe that I had a private audience; an intense, uninterrupted conversation with an object of near perfection. Nothing could have been more wonderful.</p>

<p>We need to talk about Greta. I refer, of course, to young Greta Thunberg, she of the Swedish persuasion and protracted Climate Change strike. </p>
<p>But not yet. Let’s begin instead with a cheery story of someone else with brown hair and short stature who drives people to action or distraction. </p>
<p>So, off I headed into the hinterlands of the island, wondering all the way about the needs of humanity. What was it about us that we conjured up these elves, leprechauns and other manifestations of a magical, half wild state?</p>
<p>Too near, as it turned out. Suddenly, among the mists and swaying tree limbs, the men froze. They had heard the gibbering of the ape-man and didn’t like it. They fled. </p>
<p>I fled with them – because only they knew the way back and I didn’t fancy being lost for weeks on a thickly vegetated volcano, with or without a gibberer for company. </p>
<p>So it turns out that all along the fantasy was ours, not hers. If Greta didn’t exist, we’d have to invent her. </p>

<p>But so be it: I shall now attempt to clarify any misunderstandings. And should I offend once more, I thank you in advance for your discretion. No need this time to copy in my wife. </p>
<p>But let me be serious a moment. Stuff the expats, to be honest. And stuff the revellers who come over for stag or hen dos, dressed as gorillas or bunny rabbits. Why should the natives adjust to these, our own strange ways? </p>
<p>Has the nation enthusiastically embraced multiculturalism? Not really – just as “customer service” is not the default philosophy of the communist-era ladies in many a village shop. </p>
<p>But this is a country with good reason to be suspicious of foreigners: the Austro-Hungarian Empire swallowed the place up for four centuries. Not so long after, the Nazis walked in and next the Soviets; they, too, overstayed. </p>
<p>The trick, I’m told, is this: just keep your head down.</p>

<p>Yes, somehow it was always raining (we were within spitting distance of Manchester). But somehow we didn’t care. For a start, there was even more rain to be had in North Wales, where we went for more exotic ventures. </p>
<p>We stacked it high with our wellies, fishing rods and beach clobber, wrapping everything up in a weighty tarpaulin before fixing the lot with innumerable bungees. </p>
<p>There’s much more I remember – stranded jellyfish the size of plates, sandwiches caked in sand, and, over in the Western Isles, basking seals, long straps of seaweed and whole worlds discovered in clear rock pools. </p>
<p>Close at hand, there’s plenty for our own children and grandchildren – and we in turn must ensure these vivid early moments count. Just remember to pack your Thermos flask and their waterproofs. </p>

<p>The kite, though, expressed something of Charles’s nature – always tugging, always bidding to know the skies of elsewhere.</p>
<p>Much later, Charles laughed that he’d had the better part of the deal – and, as someone who’d put up with repeated bouts of malaria, perpetually communicate in sign language and eat insects, I tended to agree.</p>

<p>“Too good to be true,” his aide, an astute man called de Orellana, probably muttered under his breath as he dutifully gathered horses and troops for the ill-fated venture, but off they went looking for it anyway. </p>
<p>Through the Andes and down into the steamy lowlands their horses, 220 soldiers and 4,000 benighted porters plodded. Months went by, and still no sign of the “País de la Canela”. </p>

<blockquote> <b><i>The summer holiday season is nearly upon us, hip hip hooray. To celebrate, our writers reflect on their fond memories of bygone summer adventures, in all their sepia-toned glory.</i></b> </blockquote>
<p>My grandparents lived in Carbis Bay, near St Ives, in Cornwall. My mother was staying with them when, unexpectedly, she went into labour. She was rushed to Penzance General Hospital which is where, on 18 August 1940, I emerged on the scene. </p>
<p>So, yes, I am a Cornishman by birth and proud of it. But it is not just the accident of birth that makes Cornwall such a special place for me.</p>
<p>One evening we watched a performance of Cyrano de Bergerac in the famous open-air Minack theatre which was built there sixty years ago. A storm broke at the end of the second act and the spume from the waves literally engulfed over the stage!</p>
<a>Salzburg</a>, the city where my mother was born, where I spent wild, carefree summers running around barefoot, my two sisters trailing behind, at my grandparents’ house, returning speaking better German than I did English.
<p>This trip, however, was to be a reclamation of our old, spontaneous ways. In the weeks leading up, we pictured our little family winding up empty mountain roads, with flowers in our hair and Joan Baez on the radio.</p>
<p>There was something rather splendid about our little sortie to the <a>Mediterranean</a>. Of course, in those days, the late Sixties, the Med was such a long way off; the people out there really did seem very foreign. </p>
<a>The Camargue</a> – famed for its magnificent white horses – we were blocked by a plague of frogs. 
<p>Such happy days. I’d love to go back, only the campsite is now a piece of prime real estate re-marketed as ‘Cap d’Agde,’ with a plush marina for your yacht. Brian Epstein would have loved it.</p>

<p>But is all this running around in a baggy tracksuit entirely seemly for someone of my advanced years, I hear you ask. It’s a question asked with increasing frequency by my children. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Freddie rallies to my defence on such occasions. “I bet Dr Livingstone ran around a track, waiting for his moment, just like Dad. Scott of the Antarctic, too.” </p>
<p>“Hmm. Bet they didn’t look quite so dreadful by the end of it.” </p>
<p>And thus another day passes, and I comfort myself, as I do my warm-up stretches, that this time, weeds notwithstanding, I’ll deliver if not exactly an Olympic record then a completion of my task. </p>
<p>“Another thing, Dad. Don’t you find it a bit embarrassing that every other runner overtakes you?”</p>
<p>“Still in my prime!” I retort – once I have caught my breath.</p>
<p>And Natalya sighs, despairingly. “Dad, you’re almost a pensioner.”</p>
<p>Ever patient, I remind my dear eldest child that the end of Covid is within sight. We must all crank up our efforts. </p>
<p>And off I go to fight my demons around the track – and not with headphones blaring the latest motivational Jay-Z rapper hit, thank you very much. </p>
<p>Except, “Er, Dad, are you having a heart attack?” Freddie then inquires as I stagger home, weakly reaching for my bottle of water.</p>
<p>“So much easier out there in the ‘wilds’,” I reassure him, and go for a little lie-down.</p>

<h1> Lady Grade, teenage star who gave up a promising career to become the busy and steady presence behind her tycoon husband Lew – obituary </h1>
<p> She was known as ‘the Singing Starlet’ before marrying Grade, who was grateful to her for introducing him to his trademark outsize cigars </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:02am </time> </div> </div>
<p>She always saw him off at the airport on business trips, and would pick him up on his return, no matter how late the hour. “It’s just one of the little things I’ve always done. To me, it’s the ideal marriage.”</p>
<p>Turning professional when she was 12, she joined a touring variety act called Beams Breazy Babes. At 15 she was principal boy in pantomime at Birkenhead, and a year later went to London to join a variety bill topped by the comedian Ted Ray.</p>
<p>“I had no fears about the money,” Kathy Grade recalled. “I had worked out which bits of furniture and objects I would sell next, if we had to, but Lew always had great confidence that it would all work out.”</p>
<p>After her mother’s death at the age of 95, her husband bought the Ivy restaurant, where the couple had their first date, as a gift for his wife.</p>
<p>He was created a life peer in 1976, and predeceased her in 1998. Their adopted son died in 2012.</p>
<p>Lady Grade, born June 23 1921, died January 1 2022</p>
<h1> Barney Wan, art director who helped to make Vogue the house magazine of swinging London – obituary </h1>
<p> He built close relationships with star photographers and encouraged the up-and-coming with his sense of style and gregarious charm </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 5 January 2022 • 1:34pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>In a spirit of adventure he moved to Paris, where the work was equally rewarding and the social life better. His shared apartment on Quai des Celestins overlooking the Seine, was a meeting place for a rakish set of transient friends.</p>
<p>London came next – first, work in the J Walter Thomson advertising agency, and then a move to the art department of Queen magazine owned by the publisher <a>Jocelyn Stevens</a> and edited by Beatrix Miller.</p>
<a>Marit Allen</a>, who was a star ascendant alerted to the rapidly changing look of fashion and the talent of new young designers like Foale and Tuffin, Gerald McCann, Ossie Clark, Bill Gibb and Mary Quant.
<p>When Grace Coddington joined the team, they brought a revitalised look to Vogue. Barney Wan was offered the position of art director of Conde Nast’s new magazine, Men In Vogue. The role of art director of Vogue itself followed.</p>
<a>John Schlesinger</a> and Tony Richardson featured prominently in his diary. Decades ago a newspaper interview referred to him as “a rare redeeming personality in London’s fashionable, fashion world”.
<p>Barney Wan was godfather to many children.</p>
<p>Barney Wan, recorded date of birth December 4 1931, died October 18 2021</p>

<a>the damage wrought by Jeremy Corbyn</a> and his merry band of north London Lefties on the perception of Labour that Sir Keir felt it necessary to reassert what should be taken for granted.

<header> <h1> Letters: Parishes have borne the brunt of the Church’s unchecked bureaucracy </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 6 January 2022 • 12:02am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – Your report (January 4) that more than 400 English churches have shut in less than a decade is shocking.</p>
<p>This saves the cost of employing the people who do the real work. But it forgets those who make up the living, spiritual Church: the congregations.</p>
<p>Professor R G FaulknerLoughborough, Leicestershire</p>
<p>SIR – Too many clergy treat their job as if it were any other. During lockdown they had a golden opportunity to support believers and non-believers alike. Instead they shut themselves away, ignoring even the old and infirm.</p>
<p>Michael KnightTaunton, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – The closure of parish churches is in line with wider trends.</p>
<p>In 1990, 34 per cent of regular churchgoers were evangelicals; by 2020 that had risen to 45.9 per cent. The growth is primarily among those who still believe the Bible and the decline among those who do not.</p>
<p>The emergence in British cities of large, new evangelical churches with young congregations, as well as the many congregations of predominantly African heritage, reflect this shift.</p>
<p>Dr Martin ParsonsDevizes, Wiltshire</p>
<p>Today it is still a thriving church and community centre; indeed, this organist has great difficulty finding a quiet time in which to practise.</p>
<p>Andrea GrayMilton Keynes, Buckinghamshire</p>
<p>SIR – At the Eucharist, communicants are still offered only the bread, not the wine, “because of Covid”.</p>
<p>Cynthia Harrod-EaglesNorthwood, Middlesex</p>
<p>SIR – While I am aware that to criticise the NHS is almost a form of blasphemy, I would like to inform your readers of a chronic management failure that happened to my wife on Monday.</p>
<p>She travelled up from Canterbury – somewhat nervously in view of the London Covid risk – only to arrive at the hospital to find the relevant scan area closed. No one was aware of her appointment.</p>
<p>James OsborneSturry, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – Recent letters (<a>January 5</a>) reminded me of when my friend owned a very old Triumph Herald.</p>
<p>One day, as she drove round a roundabout, the passenger door flew open. This was in the days before seat belts were required – and so, as I fell, she pulled me back by my collar while continuing to steer.</p>
<p>Muriel AllenCoventry, Warwickshire</p>
<p>SIR – My first car was a Morris Minor convertible.</p>
<p>My lady friend at the time was impressed by what she took to be my old-world courtesy: when parking I would dash round to open the passenger door for her.</p>
<p>What she did not know was that the car was so rusty that opening both doors caused a sag in the bodywork, and the middle of the car would have to be jacked up in order to shut either door.</p>
<p>Bruce ClarkPinner, Middlesex</p>
<p>SIR – My first car, back in the 1950s, was a bright red Heinkel bubble car.</p>
<p>When I got married I brought it with me, but we had to sell it shortly afterwards as I became pregnant and could no longer fit behind the steering wheel.</p>
<p>Judy Boys-StonesBrampton, Cumbria</p>
<h2>Russia’s resurgence</h2>
<p>We must not misread Putin; he, like Xi Jingping, is not in the game for himself, and so appeals to the man are always likely to fail. He believes in a greater, world-dominant Russia, just as Xi believes in a greater China. </p>
<p>Victor LaunertMatlock Bath, Derbyshire</p>
<a>Letters, January 3</a>). The PM vowed to sweep away superfluous regulations, so I urge him to bring back mothballs.
<p>Jan AlcockWhalley, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – I studied The Frogs by Aristophanes for Greek A-level in 1978, with the help of a bowdlerised leather-bound Victorian translation that cut out the “offensive” bits.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, having missed key parts, I achieved an E grade. Students at Reading, take note (“<a>Ancient poem’s ‘misogyny’ cut by university</a>”, report, January 3).</p>
<p>Mark RobertsKineton, Warwickshire</p>
<h2>Secession not slavery spurred America’s Civil War</h2>
<p>SIR – David Millward (<a>report, December 31</a>) writes that “the Southern states are home to about 700 memorials to Confederates who fought in the American Civil War to preserve the institution of slavery”.</p>
<p>Therefore it cannot be a surprise that his Emancipation Declaration applied only to the Southern states and not the slave-owning border states. Perhaps this is another example of war history being written by the winners.</p>
<p>Ken MottramEpping, Essex</p>
<h2>The Government has failed on energy security</h2>
<p>SIR – There is an old saying that the first duty of government is defence. Today, one might say that the first duty of government is security: territorial, economic, domestic, of person and property, food and energy.</p>
<p>Dr Richard Austen-BakerAbbeystead, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – I am puzzled by Boris Johnson’s rejection of the abolition of VAT on energy bills (report, January 5) on the grounds that it would be a blunt instrument, helping those who do not need to be helped.</p>
<p>The only conclusion is that the Prime Minister is in favour of blunt tax instruments provided that they help older voters, who are more likely to vote Conservative.</p>
