<p>SIR – It is fanciful to think that decriminalising drugs (<a>Letters, December 8</a>) will somehow resolve the problem.</p>
<p>Dr Nigel LeggBracon Ash, Norfolk</p>
<p>Professor Brian NewbouldHessle, East Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – As the Government prepares to announce its plans for post-18 education funding, it is crucial that ministers do not limit access to skills that are essential to the United Kingdom’s economic success.</p>
<p>The Government has an opportunity to locate a bigger creative economy at the heart of efforts to build back better and to realise the vision for Global Britain. We look forward to working in partnership to achieve these goals.</p>
<p>SIR – Like Susan Gregan (<a>Letters, December 10</a>), I struggled with maths at school and wasn’t allowed to take the 0-level exam.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I married a statistician, who handled all our financial affairs. Even more fortunately, our children and grandchildren take after him, so now that I am a widow I still I don’t need to worry about numbers.</p>
<p>Carol ChamberlainSouthport, Lancashire</p>
<p>SIR – Now in my 80th year, I love playing Scrabble. Words and spelling come easily to me but, without using my fingers, I cannot add up my score up at the end of the game. I always say that I was away from school the day they taught maths.</p>

<h2>Ovid’s ‘indelicacies’ trigger great beauty and joy</h2>
<p>SIR – I am currently studying Ovid’s Metamorphoses and must admit that it is not “triggering” with me (“<a>William Shakespeare can never be cancelled</a>”, Comment, December 6).</p>
<p>This may be because I am 96 years old and in a care home. However, with the aid of my wonderful computer, I am able to cross-reference Ovid’s stories to relevant paintings and pieces of poetry.</p>

<h2>HMRC’s silence is depriving charities of funds</h2>
<a>Letters, December 9</a>). I received a tax refund cheque made out incorrectly, which I returned in June requesting that it be reissued in the correct name. Since then, despite several written reminders, I have heard nothing.
<p>This simple error and consequent delay is preventing the distribution of the residual sum to several charities, which are in desperate need of funds. It seems that some departments within HMRC are more efficient than others.</p>
<p>Joe HiramRoss-on-Wye, Herefordshire</p>
<p>SIR – I understand David Samuel-Camps’s frustration with the lack of response to his inquiries to HM Revenue and Customs.</p>
<p>I wrote a second letter in April 2020, then, when no reply came, a third in May this year, yet again explaining that the amount had been paid. I have yet to receive any reply.</p>
<p>Having got nowhere I gave up, but I fully expect in 2022 to receive a new tax notification telling me that I still owe this amount.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 14 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – The Government warns that the NHS could become overwhelmed in the wake of the omicron variant, and says we should book our Covid boosters as soon as possible (report, December 13).</p>
<p>However, it appears no official had the brainpower to foresee that such demand would overwhelm the NHS website, following the Prime Minister’s announcement on Sunday.</p>
<p>If the NHS cannot even provide this service, what hope is there for the rest of the rollout?</p>
<p>Hannah HuntWoodhall Spa, Lincolnshire</p>
<p>SIR – “There are no more home tests available.”</p>
<p>That is the message I got on the government website when I attempted to order a lateral flow test kit yesterday.</p>
<p>Stephen WallisBillericay, Essex</p>
<p>SIR – Today I will be playing golf.</p>
<p>I would have preferred to spend the day administering booster vaccines, but it appears the Government would rather pay GPs £15 per jab than utilise former nurses such as me.</p>
<p>Clare Byam-CookLondon SW15</p>
<p>SIR – My wife and I received our booster vaccines more than a month ago.</p>
<p>This surely throws doubt on the rollout figures, and the number of people who have received their boosters.</p>
<p>Gavin ScottSleaford, Lincolnshire</p>
<p>SIR – Julian Jessop (<a>Business, December 12</a>) says Plan B could knock 2 per cent off GDP, costing the economy at least £4 billion a month.</p>
<p>This is money that could otherwise fund healthcare, policing, defence or welfare – or go towards our children, who will be left to pick up the tab.</p>
<p>For the sake of our children, this madness must stop. We can no longer seek to protect ourselves at the expense of the young.</p>
<h2>Starmer’s sniping</h2>
<p>SIR – If the only line of attack that Sir Keir Starmer can come up with is a complaint about a Zoom quiz which happened a year ago (<a>report, December 13</a>), his judgment is severely flawed.</p>
<p>What the country wants to hear from him are viable alternative policies to address the many problems we face. So far in his tenure I cannot think of a single instance when he has done that.</p>

<p>Philip DulyHaslemere, Surrey</p>
<h2>In search of a dentist</h2>
<p>SIR – Concerns over the availability of NHS dentistry (<a>Letters, December 8</a>) are not confined to Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>When my regular dentist retired and the practice was taken over by a dentist who no longer provided NHS treatment, I proceeded to phone no fewer than four dentists in the local area, only to be advised that they were not accepting NHS patients.</p>
<p>Graham ChamberlainMaidenhead, Berkshire</p>
<p>SIR – The elderly and cash-dependent are being cut off by banks after branch closures accelerated to a record rate this year (<a>report, December 10</a>).</p>
<p>Credit card companies have the legal right to refuse anyone a card or revoke an existing card – without giving reasons. Such power needs curtailing. E-payment is data-rich and hence ripe for data-mining; again, the public needs protection.</p>
<p>E-payment systems have become indispensable to everyday life; but what happens when some innocent person becomes cut off from these systems? Effectively, they become divorced from society. Legislation is required urgently.</p>

<p>Ann HallidayKing’s Lynn, Norfolk</p>
<p>SIR – I write as an alumnus of Durham University. I commend the university’s rigour, superb post-graduate courses and tradition of freedom of opinion and speech.</p>
<p>It is with absolute horror, then, that I and other alumni note the moves of the hierarchy there to suspend or discipline Professor Tim Luckhurst, a renowned, respected and decent man (<a>report, December 9</a>).</p>
<p>His offence? Inviting Rod Liddle, a journalist, to speak at a function, then criticising those students who walked out.</p>
<p>David RatliffNewcastle upon Tyne</p>
<p>SIR – If the Government and police are so keen on cutting the use of cannabis and other social drugs (<a>report, December 11</a>), perhaps they should institute a drug offenders register.</p>
<p>Even if users are not prosecuted, the shame of being placed on the register, and increasing penalties for further mentions, could eventually make the crime turn the user into a social pariah.</p>
<p>David WolstenholmeLittle Chalfont, Buckinghamshire</p>
<p>SIR – David Boult (<a>Letters, December 9</a>) suggests that planting trees in towns does little to benefit society.</p>
<p>Frances M BerrillHassocks, West Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – These are the opening lines of a song written to celebrate the 800th anniversary of Helston’s charter:</p>
<p>In 1201 Good King John granted Helston town its charter.</p>
<p>In 1215 at Runnymede he signed the Magna Carta.</p>
<p>I’m afraid Phoebe Southworth’s claim (<a>report, December 9</a>) that Marazion holds the oldest charter in Britain – granted in 1257 – must be disputed.</p>

<p>SIR – On Monday evening the Prime Minister announced the first death of a person in Britain with the omicron Covid variant.</p>
<p>There was no mention of whether this person had been vaccinated or had any underlying health problems, or of how old they were. This is scaremongering at its worst.</p>

<p>Steve CrockfordEast Grinstead, West Sussex</p>
<p>SIR – Strategically, Brexit, the pandemic and an 80-seat majority for the Conservatives came together to provide a unique political opportunity to implement truly revolutionary reform across all departments and institutions.</p>
<p>Instead, the parliamentary Conservative Party is now doing what it does best: staring at its navel, undermining the leader and chasing irrelevant personal hobby horses based on idealistic twaddle.</p>
<p>The public hates political hubris. Unless Conservative MPs wake up, raise their eyes and concentrate on delivering the revolution in governance that the Red Wall is seeking, then there will likely be an electoral reckoning.</p>

<p>SIR – As a retired dental surgeon, I am only too aware of the problems that will arise from the unavailability of dental treatment on the NHS<a> (Letters, December 14)</a>.</p>
<p>Dentists had a hard time during lockdowns, when they were not allowed to work, and it is appreciated that their expenses continued without income to compensate, but it must be time to start opening their surgeries to NHS patients again.</p>

<h2>Keep universities open</h2>
<p>SIR – We urge the Government to commit to keeping universities open in the event of any further restrictions arising as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic, academic research had already shown that these harms particularly affect struggling students and those from deprived socio-economic backgrounds.</p>
<p>Young people have repeatedly borne the heaviest brunt of Covid-19 restrictions, despite being least at risk from the virus. We cannot fail them again.</p>

<p>SIR – The Russian threat to Ukraine signals a very real risk of military conflict in the Baltic states.</p>

<p>This has meant that HMRC now has a larger proportion of young, inexperienced staff members, who are often promoted quickly to fill the gaps. This may explain its poor service.</p>

<p>Miranda GudenianHoniton, Devon</p>
<p>SIR – To use an old football analogy, it looks like Boris Johnson has lost the dressing room.</p>
<p>Nick BrighamHarrogate, North Yorkshire</p>
<p>SIR – I can understand why a large number of Conservative MPs have lost confidence in Boris Johnson and want to punish him.</p>
<p>However, they should not use this as a reason to put the nation’s health at risk. They voted against proposals that involve minimal inconvenience compared with the dangers we may now face from the omicron variant.</p>
<p>I hate to admit it, but we are fortunate to have an Opposition that is prepared to put people’s safety above party politics.</p>
<p>Michael HatchReading, Berkshire</p>
<p>SIR – Thankfully, a comfortable majority voted for vaccine passports.</p>
<p>However, those Tory MPs with nothing more on their minds than unseating the Prime Minister put their personal grievances before everything else. I wonder if their actions reflect the will of the constituents who put them in Parliament.</p>

<p>SIR – Why couldn’t those who opposed the Prime Minister’s plan for vaccine passports understand that these will encourage people to get jabbed?</p>
<p>SIR – There is no point in vaccination passports. Does the Government seriously expect all pubs to check?</p>
<p>It would be better to charge an additional tax if proof of inoculation cannot be provided. At least it would help towards the cost of treatment for those not vaccinated.</p>

<p>SIR – I applied for a paper Covid passport, as I often have problems with my mobile phone and technology.</p>
<p>I had my booster several weeks ago, but when the pass arrived it only showed my first two jabs. Presumably this piece of paper is as good as useless.</p>
<p>Patricia EssexHedge End, Hampshire</p>
<p>SIR – There are prophecies from public health physicians and politicians that we are facing a tsunami of omicron cases, and that the health service may be overwhelmed if there is a spillover into the vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>The answer to all these questions is no. All it will do is cause widespread panic with no discernible benefit.</p>

<p>SIR – I too have had problems with my NHS dentist (<a>Letters, December 14</a>).</p>
<p>John A TallisHusbands Bosworth, Leicestershire</p>
<p>SIR – My grandson, who was forecast to gain three A* grades at A-level and is desperate to become a dentist, was rejected from the universities to which he applied. The reason given was that the number of places had been cut.</p>
<p>He got his three A*s and now has to wait a year in the hope he gains a place. If unsuccessful, he will go to Valencia, at a cost of £200,000 to his parents.</p>

<p>HMRC (<a>Letters, December 15</a>) says it has the papers but they are in a locked office which, at present, has no staff in it. No one has been to work there for nearly two years. How long will it be before my husband can fully retire?</p>
<p>Valerie ThompsonWest Horsley, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – Home-working is clearly harming HMRC. I recently discovered that my tax code had erroneously changed due to my salary being processed twice.</p>
<p>Who is going to address this huge problem?</p>
<p>SIR – In September, amid pressure to find more HGV drivers, the Department of Transport suspended the requirement for people towing trailers behind cars and light vans to take a test.</p>
<p>Those I had booked for employees were cancelled and we were assured that clarification would be issued granting blanket approval for the right to tow. Various pronouncement dates have since been and gone.</p>
<p>As a result of this indecision, I am unable to get my employees a licence to tow, and businesses and individuals that rely on being allowed to tow things such as caravans, boats and horse boxes are considerably worse off than we were before.</p>
<p>This is yet another government own goal.</p>
<p>Edward BarhamRolvenden, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – I note that Avon and Somerset Police has adopted a technique called “non-visible policing” (report, December 15). I assume officers were trained in rural Suffolk, as the police have been invisible here for years.</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 17 December 2021 • 12:01am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – Yet again, British people are being asked to “do the right thing” and “follow the rules” – and the majority will do as they are asked.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister announced that there had been a single death from omicron, the new variant. That was it. No context, simply that there had been a death. Did that person die of omicron, or with omicron?</p>
<p>The Government is desperate to avoid making the vaccine mandatory. Cold, hard facts that actually tell people something might encourage some of the “undecided” to rethink their stance and help Britain to avoid such extreme measures.</p>
<p>Geoff HansonLeighterton, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>SIR – It was reported on Wednesday evening that there had been 78,610 new Covid-19 cases that day – the highest figure since January 8 (when there were 68,053 cases) and a 32 per cent increase over the previous 24 hours.</p>
<p>When will the Prime Minister and our national medical advisers start giving us all the facts, instead of sensationalising and destroying the livelihoods of many over Christmas?</p>
<p>James WyburdNutley, East Sussex</p>
<p>Sorry, Boris, but I’ve had enough.</p>
<p>Joanna LastBucklesham, Suffolk</p>
<p>SIR – The underlying reason for the politicians’ panic whenever there is an upturn in Covid cases is the lack of capacity within the NHS.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, when the NHS had 180,000 acute beds and operated at about 75 per cent capacity, it could comfortably cope with most increases.</p>
<p>Now, with 100,000 beds, it runs at 90 to 95 per cent capacity and faces serious problems whenever patient numbers rise. Is it any wonder we have such a poor healthcare system?</p>
<p>Norman JonesColwyn Bay, Denbighshire</p>
<p>SIR – Coronavirus is tearing our democracy apart, our society apart and individual families apart, as well as bankrupting the country and having a terrible effect on our mental and physical health.</p>
<p>Many believe that China has questions to answer about the provenance of the virus, but the international community seems powerless, or unwilling, to ask. Why?</p>
<p>Chris NancollasYorkley, Gloucestershire</p>
<h2>NHS dentists’ despair</h2>
<p>The fault lies fairly and squarely in the hands of successive governments, which have shown little interest in NHS dentistry and rub their hands in glee each time a dental practice transfers, in despair, from NHS to private.</p>
<p>The dental profession has been waiting for many years for a new NHS contract to be introduced, as there is a huge amount of dissatisfaction with the present one.</p>
<p>NHS dental practitioners should not be blamed for the difficulties patients are having in obtaining treatment, nor be compared to GP surgeries, which have managed to negotiate a far better financial deal with governments.</p>
<p>James HardyFarnham, Surrey</p>
<h2>Orbán’s asylum policy</h2>
<a>reports</a> that Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, “supports the construction of barbed-wire fences on the EU’s external frontiers and draconian laws that curb the rights of would-be asylum seekers”.
<p>The irony of this will not be lost on the United Nations Association volunteer workforce, which provided housing for refugees in the 1960s.</p>
<p>I worked on a project in Kärnten in southern Austria in the summer of 1964. The majority of the refugees for whom we built houses were Hungarian nationals who had fled their country following the Russian invasion of 1956.</p>

<h2>Classical cancellation</h2>
<p>SIR – <a>Jordan Peterson</a>’s cancellation by the University of Cambridge reminded me of Plato’s Apology of Socrates.</p>
<p>In Athens in 399 BC, Socrates was tried, found guilty and condemned to death for corrupting his pupils by encouraging them to think. Plato made a record of the speeches Socrates made in his own defence. Have times changed over two millennia?</p>
<p>Graham FranklinBromley, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – Since many university students seem unwilling to listen to any views other than those they have already formed <a>(Letters, December 15)</a>, they must believe they know everything.</p>
<p>If they consider that they are in no need of further education they should leave at once and make way for those who are truly prepared to learn.</p>
<p>Carmichael A ThomasWellingborough, Northamptonshire</p>
<p>SIR – Sir Anthony Seldon <a>(Letters, December 8)</a> suggests making it clear to young people that taking drugs is unwise, unhealthy and unnecessary to happiness, in the hope that the message will stick as they get older.</p>
<p>It made the desired impression on me and I am very grateful I was never tempted to smoke because of it.</p>

<h2>The art of the pithy school report put-down</h2>
<p>SIR – I can relate to Catherine Kidson’s <a>letter (December 15) </a>on 1960s school reports.</p>
<p>At the end of my first year at grammar school, my art master told me: “Fletcher, the only thing you will ever paint is a door.”</p>
<p>He was absolutely correct. Now in my 71st year, I am an expert with a two-inch brush and a can of Dulux.</p>
<p>Robert FletcherTaunton, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – My art report was succinct and entirely accurate: “Started abysmally and rose to a very low standard.”</p>
<p>Michael CowardClifton, Bedfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – My geography report in the 1960s said: “Does well to find her way home.”</p>
<p>Sue DavisBlackwater, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – When I began teaching in Warwickshire in the 1970s, a colleague wrote on one girl’s report: “During the last year, Susan has grown older.”</p>
<p>Finding that too harsh as she surveyed the reports before they were sent out, the headmistress returned it for reconsideration. The teacher added: “And has learnt nothing.”</p>
<p>Dr Rosalind MilesBroxbourne, Hertfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – When I left primary school in 1964, the head teacher wrote: “Wendy is a nice girl who means well.”</p>
<p>Wendy WhitelamDursley, Gloucestershire</p>
<p>SIR – On the subject of spelling, my 1964 school report simply said: “Original.”</p>

<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 18 December 2021 • 12:02am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Conservatives polled about 23,000 fewer votes than in 2019, and this is certainly significant.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone is listening. A change in leadership, direction and a move to serious actions, not words, is urgently needed.</p>
<p>Robert BarlowLittle Bookham, Surrey</p>
<p>SIR – Tory backbenchers have indicated their lack of faith in Boris Johnson as leader. Conservative voters in North Shropshire have registered their disdain for him as Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The incompetent handling of the economy, insane green policies, and the haphazard management of the pandemic – combined with allegations of sleaze – mean that this is not a government recognised by true Conservatives.</p>
<p>A two-year rebuilding programme must commence, with Boris Johnson and most of his Cabinet being replaced now.</p>
<p>Clifford BaxterWareham, Dorset</p>
<p>The only snag in going for change now is that we cannot rely on the Civil Service to keep the ship steady in the interim.</p>
<p>Peter MunroWincanton, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – The most significant thing about this by-election result is that the voters did not turn to Labour.</p>
<p>Brian FosterShrivenham, Oxfordshire</p>
<p>SIR – I note with interest the assumption that North Shropshire has a strong farming sector, so is surely Tory. Why so?</p>
<p>A Lib Dem win was a certainty. We must regain access to the single market if UK plc is to survive.</p>
<p>Dr Eric GoodyerBirsay, Orkney</p>
<p>SIR – The Prime Minister probably thinks he got Brexit done. He didn’t.</p>
<p>He has failed to protect our borders against illegal migrants, to the extent that countries such as Russia are now using the mass movement of people in demographic warfare, destabilising our economy and security.</p>
<p>He has betrayed this country and those loyal to the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>Philip IncledonMark, Somerset</p>
<p>SIR – Why can’t the Government be as decisive as the Queen? We will never forget her decision to sit socially distanced at her husband’s funeral. What a heartbreaking sight.</p>
<p>Her Majesty was surely looking forward to sharing this Christmas with her closest family, but again she has been decisive and cancelled the pre-Christmas lunch with them (report, December 16).</p>
<p>As always, she is leading by example – a policy the Government needs to adopt, and quickly.</p>

<a>December 16</a>) on the Scrooge-like Christmas lunch at Steyning Grammar School in West Sussex reminded me of happy times in Grand Cayman, when we would luxuriate over a Christmas Day brunch at a hotel known for its sumptuous food.
<p>On one occasion I asked a waiter whether the staff had been treated to something special. His face fell. Their Christmas lunch had been liver curry.</p>
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Ellesmere, and was often told how fit I looked.</p>
<p>John CoxDevizes, Wiltshire</p>
<p>SIR – For more than 30 years there has been a programme of closing local tax offices in towns and relocating staff to larger inner-city premises <a>(Letters, December 17</a>).</p>

<header> <h1> Letters: The Tories’ North Shropshire trouncing was a repudiation of the PM </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Letters to the Editor <time> 19 December 2021 • 12:25am </time> </div> </div>
<p>SIR – The North Shropshire by-election result was no ordinary defeat – the consequence of mid-term blues, say, or voter apathy. It was a catastrophe.</p>
<p>Many factors have been in play – incompetence, sleaze, arrogance and green-liberal rather than Conservative policies – but all can be traced back to 10 Downing Street.</p>
<p>Conservative MPs have a stark choice. They can either eject Boris Johnson and his gang of fools, or they can face another 1997, with all this will entail for themselves, the party, Brexit and the country.</p>
<p>SIR – Although a lifelong Conservative voter who grew up in a Tory household, and now in my 80s, I feel conscience-bound to say “thank you” to the voters of North Shropshire.</p>
<p>Gerald FisherMilborne Port, Somerset</p>
<p>The Tories need to reverse this – the sooner the better. If that means getting rid of Mr Johnson, they must do it now.</p>
<p>SIR – Would I like to have a pint with Boris Johnson? Definitely. Would I want him on my board of directors? Definitely not.</p>
<p>SIR – Once again we saw the smug face of Sir Ed Davey announcing the new dawn of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p>The only person he is kidding is himself. This was a protest vote, announcing that decisive action has to be taken. Whether the Tories have the wit to do that is another matter.</p>
<p>Charles PenfoldUlverston, Cumbria</p>
<p>SIR – Has there ever been a more unpleasant victory speech in a by-election? Helen Morgan’s was mean-spirited, petty, aggressive and unnecessarily personal in its criticism of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>There was no trace of the graciousness towards the other candidates that is customary. Many people disapprove of what the Prime Minister is doing, but there’s no need to be so hateful towards him.</p>
<p>SIR – The trouble with this result is that everyone thinks they have been vindicated.</p>
<p>Remainers think it was a vote against Brexit; Brexiteers think it was a protest against the failure to get Brexit done. Lockdown sceptics attribute it to the latest measures; lockdown fanatics believe people want tougher rules.</p>
<p>A return to decent, Right-of-centre Conservative values is long overdue.</p>
<p>Simon HubbardBrownhills, Staffordshire</p>
<p>SIR – It’s not coronavirus that is tearing apart everything we know and love<a> (Letters, December 17) </a>but the response to it from our leaders, which has been almost unanimous.</p>

<p>SIR – I am a member of the Conservative Party and work in the health service.</p>
<p>However, I will now consider not renewing my membership due to MPs <a>criticising</a> the excellent advice given by Professor Chris Whitty.</p>
<p>I wonder how some of these people ever made their way into Parliament. Standards on all sides have sadly gone down and down over the years.</p>

<h2>A simple way to bring your garden to life</h2>
<p>SIR – We have a small garden, totally surrounded by hedges<a> (Letters, December 12)</a>, but the magnet for birds is my little pond.</p>
<p>I keep it accessible for them to bathe in and drink from, and they are a joy to watch. It also attracts dragonflies and other insects in the summer, and newts live at the bottom. I suggest a pond should be included in every new garden.</p>
<p>Jacqueline DaviesFaversham, Kent</p>
<p>SIR – Derek Coggrave<a> (Letters, December 12) </a>draws attention to the concreting over of urban gardens, usually to provide off-road parking.</p>

<p>SIR – It has been reported that Lord Frost resigned because “he is exasperated with the high-spending regime, the obsession with hitting ‘net zero’ environmental targets and Covid vaccine passports”.</p>
<p>I would suggest that his opinions represent most Tory voters better than those of the regime in Number 10.</p>

<p>SIR – Lord Frost said he wanted “a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change”. This is exactly what the majority of Conservatives want.</p>

<h2>EU travel restrictions</h2>
