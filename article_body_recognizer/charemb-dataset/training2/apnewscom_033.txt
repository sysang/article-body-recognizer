<a>to hear her speak French to her siblings.</a>
<a>which ended with last week’s conviction, </a> Williams says she produced around 100 sketches of witness testimony, attorney arguments, jurors, the judge, spectators and, above all, the defendant herself.
<p>Jeffrey Epstein, by contrast, was “incredibly fidgety.” Williams drew Epstein, <a>the ex-boyfriend-turned-employer of Maxwell,</a> at his unsuccessful bail hearings before his 2019 jailhouse suicide.</p>
<p>Here, Williams takes the AP through her sketchpad, coloring in the key moments of Maxwell’s trial with her behind-the-scenes observations:</p>
<p>Williams prefers a wall between herself and subjects: “I don’t like to become friendly with anybody I’m drawing. I’m looking at them as they’re a news story to me and I want them to stay that way.”</p>
<p>Maxwell breached that divide, attracting some attention for drawing the courtroom artists themselves. A meta sketch by Reuters artist Jane Rosenberg of Maxwell drawing her even went viral.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘OK, that’s fine. Do what you want to. But it’s not going to affect anything I do,’” Williams said.</p>
<p>Williams said Maxwell would occasionally purposefully pose, something that actually served the artist’s purposes.</p>
<p>“It’s much more captivating to have somebody, they’re looking right at the camera, or they’re looking right at the artist, and so people looking at the drawing are seeing somebody looking right at them,” Williams said.</p>
<p>The dynamic continued through the last day of the trial, when Maxwell seemed buoyed by a jury note hours before the verdict.</p>
<a> case revolved around four accusers,</a> three who testified under pseudonyms or using just first names — Jane, Kate and Carolyn. The courtroom artists were instructed not to draw likenesses, which, for Williams, meant avoiding facial features.
<p>The hands are another key, she said.</p>
<p>Jane wasn’t that animated while testifying about how Epstein grabbed her, Williams said. </p>
<p>Carolyn’s hands were particularly eye-catching.</p>
<p>A courtroom artist has to stay alert for big moments, even when a witness might not seem like a headliner.</p>
<p>An FBI analyst’s testimony yielded one of the more bizarre images from the trial, as prosecutors displayed a photograph the analyst had found that appeared to show Maxwell massaging Epstein’s foot with her breasts.</p>
<p>Williams knew that was her shot, so much so that she had no time to gauge Maxwell’s reaction.</p>
<p>“I have to tell you the truth. When I saw that, I was so focused on getting it down, I thought, I can’t, I couldn’t focus on her. I had to focus on drawing this thing,” she said. </p>
<p>The photographs were shown for what seemed like a maximum of seven seconds, “meaning I’m drawing like the wind.”</p>
<p>A government official sitting in front of Williams even turned around at one point, she said, to commend the way she captured that scene.</p>
<p>Maxwell constantly communicated with her lawyers and engaged in daily displays of physical affection with them.</p>
<p>“Oh my God. Hug fest. All those attorneys got hugs,” Williams said. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”</p>
<p>Williams said she did notice Maxwell start to get slightly more agitated as the trial wore on, but her stoicism returned when the verdict was read.</p>
<p>“She put her hand up to kind of her head and her lawyer put his hand on her back,” Williams said. “And that was it. That was it. There was no other reaction.”</p>
<p>That day, there were no hugs for the attorneys as she was ushered out.</p>
<p>Williams began her career as a trained fashion illustrator.</p>
<p>“So Maxwell is right up my alley,” she said. “Whenever she walked into court, with the two U.S. marshals, she always made an entrance like she was walking down a runway, I swear to God.” </p>
<p>Williams said the British socialite made her presence apparent in the way she held herself, arms back, “her swagger, swaying a little bit.”</p>
<p>Her exits could also leave an impression, including her final one as she <a>strode out of the courtroom after the verdict.</a></p>
<div><div><h1>In their own words: House lawmakers remember Jan. 6</h1></div><div>By MARY CLARE JALONICKJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — Around three dozen Democrats were trapped in the House gallery on Jan. 6 after the rest of their colleagues had been evacuated, ducking beneath their seats as supporters of then-President Donald Trump laid siege. </p>
<p>The insurrection interrupted the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. The Democrats were unable to leave as rioters surrounded the chamber and tried to beat down the doors.</p>
<p>Capitol Police eventually evacuated the group unharmed, and Congress resumed the electoral count that evening. But many say the trauma of the experience lingers.</p>
<p>In interviews with The Associated Press, 10 of the lawmakers who were there described their experiences in the House gallery and the aftermath: </p>
<p>Vermont Rep. Peter Welch, who was posting video updates to Twitter: </p>

<div><div><h1>Capitol riot suspects still sought by the FBI a year later</h1></div><div>By MICHAEL BALSAMOJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The suspect was covered from head to toe, skulking through the dark streets of the nation’s capital before methodically placing two explosives outside the offices of the Republican and Democratic national committees.</p>
<p>Only 17 hours later — and just before the U.S. Capitol was stormed by a sea of pro-Trump rioters — were the pipe bombs discovered. It quickly became one of the highest-priority investigations for the FBI and the Justice Department.</p>
<p>But the trail grew cold almost immediately. A year later, federal investigators are no closer to learning the person’s identity. And a key question remains: Was there a connection between the pipe bombs and <a>the riot at the Capitol</a>?</p>
<a>last January’s deadly insurrection</a>. So far, 250 people
<a>seen on video assaulting police</a> at the Capitol still haven’t been fully identified and apprehended by the FBI, and another 100 are being sought for other crimes tied to the riot.
<p>The investigation has been a massive undertaking for federal law enforcement officials. More than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the Jan. 6 attack, and arrests are still being made regularly.</p>
<p>“The assaults against the police officers are extremely serious,” D’Antuono said. More than 100 police officers were attacked by rioters on Jan. 6, some attacked by multiple people and some attacked multiple times, he said. </p>
<a>a man is seen</a> repeatedly bashing a police officer over the head with a 6-foot (1.8-meter) metal pole as he tries to push his way into the Capitol. And a third
<a>shows a man spraying</a> some kind of chemical from a can into the faces of other officers.
<p>“There is still a lot of work to be done on this,” D’Antuono said. “There were a lot of people up there at the Capitol, a lot of people that either committed violence up there did other unlawful actions up there.”</p>
<p>But they are still no closer to finding the suspect’s identity and are hoping renewed attention on the video of the person may spark a tip to crack the case.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether the bombs were related to planning for the insurrection or whether they were unrelated to the deadly riot. Both buildings are within a few blocks of the Capitol.</p>
<p>And the fact the suspect was covered from head to toe has made identifying the person extremely difficult for the FBI.</p>
<p>“In normal times, like if this wasn’t COVID,” D’Antuono said, “a person walking down the street in D.C. covered from head to toe with a mask on, glasses and gloves would have been a red flag.”</p>
<div><div><h1>Hong Kong bans flights, imposes other COVID-19 restrictions</h1></div><div>By ZEN SOOJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The two-week ban on passenger flights from Australia, Canada, France, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Britain and the United States will take effect Sunday and continue until Jan. 21.</p>
<p>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam also announced that restaurant dining will be forbidden after 6 p.m. for two weeks starting Friday. Game arcades, bars and beauty salons must also close during that period.</p>
<p>“We have to contain the pandemic to ensure that there will not be a major outbreak in the community again,” Lam said at a news conference, adding that the city is “on the verge” of another surge.</p>
<p>The measures came as new omicron clusters have emerged over the past week, many linked to several Cathay Pacific crew members who broke isolation rules and dined at restaurants and bars in the city before testing positive.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has reported 114 omicron variant cases as of Tuesday, with most being imported. On Tuesday, it reported its first untraceable case in nearly three months, which authorities said was likely caused by the omicron variant.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>COVID case counts may be losing importance amid omicron</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>In Israel, omicron drives records, zigzag policy, 4th shots </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chicago cancels classes after union backs remote learning</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>China reports major drop in virus cases in locked-down Xi'an</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Hong Kong officials have moved swiftly to block the spread of the variant, locking down residential buildings where people have tested positive and mass-testing thousands of people.</p>
<p>That includes about 2,500 passengers who were being held Wednesday on a cruise ship in Hong Kong for coronavirus tests, after health authorities said nine passengers were linked to an omicron cluster and ordered the ship to turn back.</p>
<p>Authorities forced the Royal Caribbean’s Spectrum of the Seas ship, which departed Sunday on a “cruise to nowhere,” to return a day early on Wednesday, according to a government statement.</p>
<p>The ship returned to Hong Kong on Wednesday morning and passengers were held onboard for most of the day while they awaited testing.</p>
<p>One passenger, Claudy Wong, said Royal Caribbean had tried its best to follow pandemic regulations.</p>
<p>“The pandemic has gone on for so long, actually passengers like us who board the cruise are already prepared for such situations to happen,” Wong said.</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean said in a statement that the nine guests were immediately isolated and all tested negative, and that the company was working closely with authorities to comply with epidemic prevention policies and regulations.</p>
<p>It said guests who were on the affected ship would receive a 25% refund on their cruise fare. The ship’s next sailing on Thursday was also canceled because the crew must undergo testing, and those guests will receive a full refund.</p>
<p>The city has reported a total of 12,690 confirmed coronavirus infections as of Tuesday, including 213 deaths.</p>
<div><div><h1>US pushes unity on Ukraine ahead of key Russia meetings</h1></div><div>By MATTHEW LEE and FRANK JORDANSJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>WASHINGTON (AP) — In a display of unity, the Biden administration and its European allies are beginning a series of meetings aimed at showing Russia that an invasion of Ukraine would be met with a forceful response.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Biden says deal with telecoms avoids flight disruptions </h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Elizabeth Holmes saga still has some loose ends to resolve</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Manchin still a no, Biden's $2T bill on Dems' back burner</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Chinese developer asking bondholders to postpone repayment</h4></a></div></li>
<p>It will precede a flurry of meetings involving NATO foreign ministers, senior U.S. and Russian officials, the NATO-Russia Council and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe set for next week.</p>
<p>“With regard to Russia, the common message of the European and American governments is clear. Russian actions come with a clear price tag (and) the only way out of the crisis is through dialogue,” she said.</p>
<p>As the Biden administration moves to build international consensus around a set of possible punitive measures, Germany is clearly the linchpin. Securing its support will be key to both messaging and implementation of whatever is decided.</p>
<p>“In order for sanctions to be effective, they have to be effective in the dollar and the euro,” said Rep. Mike Waltz, a Republican from Florida who visited Ukraine in December along with other U.S. lawmakers. </p>
<p>The new pipeline is “giving Putin a checkmate over Western Europe” and limiting Germany’s engagement on sanctions and other preemptive measures that lawmakers from both parties want, Waltz said. </p>
<p>“I don’t see how they trade their energy security for taking a strong stand for Ukraine, and it puts Ukrainians and it puts Eastern Europeans, our allies, and NATO for that matter in a very precarious position,” he said.</p>
<p>Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat who also joined the lawmakers’ trip to Ukraine, said he believed the U.S. might be able to supply energy to Germany if it is cut off from importing Russian gas. </p>
<p>“My sense is Germany is waking up to this,” Moulton said. “They are starting to realize how serious this threat is and the leverage that Putin has potentially over them and other countries in Western Europe.”</p>

<div><div><h1>NFL fines Washington $10M after misconduct investigation</h1></div><div>By STEPHEN WHYNOJuly 1, 2021 GMT</div></div>
<p>The team was not stripped of any draft picks and no formal suspensions were handed out as part of the league’s discipline that was announced Thursday stemming from lawyer Beth Wilkinson’s investigation that began last summer.</p>
<p>“The culture at the club was very toxic, and it fell far short of the NFL’s values and we hold ownership to a higher standard,” Friel said.</p>
<p>Lawyers representing 40 former Washington employees slammed the NFL for choosing to protect Snyder and ignoring requests to make the report public, calling the fine “pocket change.”</p>
<p>“The NFL has effectively told survivors in this country and around the world that it does not care about them or credit their experiences.”</p>
<p>Banks and Katz called Tanya Snyder’s promotion a “shallow attempt to show progress without making any meaningful changes to the organization.” </p>
<p>The league praised Snyder for hiring Ron Rivera as coach in early 2020 and Jason Wright as team president last summer among those changes to improve the organization’s culture.</p>
<p>Friel said Wilkinson was not tasked with making any recommendations about Dan Snyder selling the team or being suspended.</p>
<p>Snyder said in a statement he agrees with the commissioner’s decisions and is “committed to implementing his investigation’s important recommendations.”</p>

<p>The NFL is reducing isolation time for players who test positive for COVID-19 and are asymptomatic, including unvaccinated players, to five days from 10.</p>
<p>The league and the NFL Players Association revised the protocols on Tuesday after the CDC changed its guidelines for those who are asymptomatic, recommending a five-day isolation period and masking over the second five days.</p>
<p>The changes could allow Colts quarterback Carson Wentz to return for Sunday’s key game against Las Vegas after Indianapolis placed him on the reserve/COVID-19 list.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether Wentz, who is unvaccinated, tested positive for the virus or was deemed a close contact to someone else who had tested positive. However, if Wentz has no symptoms, he could be cleared to play.</p>
<p>In a memo sent to teams and obtained by The Associated Press, players and essential football personnel can return under the following conditions:</p>
<p>— Five days have passed since a positive COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>— At least 24 hours have passed since the individual last had a fever without the use of fever-reducing medications.</p>
<p>— Other symptoms, including a cough, have resolved or improved.</p>

<p>— Any local regulations or requirements are satisfied.</p>
<p>Masks must be worn on the sideline and at all times except when playing and practicing for five days after return.</p>
<p>The timing couldn’t be worse for the Colts, who have rebounded from a 1-4 start to win eight of their past 10. They can clinch one of the seven AFC playoff spots with a win over the Raiders.</p>
<p>Indy’s move comes one day after five players, including right tackle Braden Smith, were added to a rapidly expanding COVID-19 list.</p>
<p>Indy won Saturday at Arizona despite missing six starters because of COVID-19 and losing two more in the first half. The absences forced the Colts to play with only one of their five regular offensive line starters, Smith.</p>
<p>It’s unclear how many, if any, of those players may return Sunday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians has tested positive for COVID-19 and is currently isolating at home.</p>
<p>The team said Tuesday that assistant head coach/run game coordinator Harold Goodwin will serve as interim head coach in Arians’ absence. The reigning Super Bowl champions visit the New York Jets on Sunday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bucs also placed cornerbacks Jamel Dean and Sean Murphy-Bunting on the reserve/COVID-19 list. That increases the number of Tampa Bay players on the list to five.</p>
<p>— Patriots rookie quarterback Mac Jones could be without his top backup against the Jaguars after veteran Brian Hoyer was added to the reserve/COVID-19 list, along with linebackers Josh Uche and Brandon King.</p>
<p>Hoyer, who is on his fourth stint in New England, has previously served in backup roles to Tom Brady and Cam Newton. He has been Jones’ backup for each of the first 15 games this season. </p>
<p>Linebackers coach Jerod Mayo said Tuesday that the team is prepared to adjust as necessary on defense.</p>
<p>— The Cincinnati Bengals placed wide receiver Auden Tate on the reserve/COVID-19 list. Tate hasn’t played since Week 7 and is on injured reserve because of a calf injury.</p>
<p>— The Philadelphia Eagles placed wide receiver John Hightower on the practice squad reserve/COVID-19 list.</p>

<p>SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) — A brutal winter storm smacked the coastal Southeast with a rare blast of snow and ice Wednesday, hitting parts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina with their heaviest snowfall in nearly three decades.</p>
<p>Forecasters warned that the same system could soon strengthen into a “bomb cyclone” as it rolls up the East Coast, bringing hurricane-force winds, coastal flooding and up to a foot of snow.</p>
<p>At least 17 deaths were blamed on dangerously cold temperatures that for days have gripped wide swaths of the U.S. from Texas to New England.</p>
<p>A winter storm warning extended from the Gulf Coast of Florida’s “Big Bend” region all the way up the Atlantic coast. Forecasters said hurricane-force winds blowing offshore on Thursday could generate 24-foot (7-meter) seas.</p>
<p>Schools in the Southeast called off classes just months after being shut down because of hurricane threats, and police urged drivers to stay off the roads in a region little accustomed to the kind of winter woes common to the Northeast.</p>
<p>“It almost seems the town is deserted just like in the last hurricane,” said Shaw, 65. “There’s no one on the street. It’s got a little eerie feeling.”</p>
<p>Dump trucks spread sand on major streets in Savannah ahead of the storm and police closed several bridges, overpasses and a major causeway because of ice.</p>
<p>“They probably will be teenagers the next time something like this happens, and that’s kind of sad,” Monoc said. “But we’ll enjoy it while it is here.”</p>
<p>In Tallahassee, Florida, Michigan transplant Laura Donaven built a snowman 6 inches (15 centimeters) tall. The city tweeted that snow fell there for the first time in 28 years.</p>
<p>“I made a snowball and threw it at my dad,” said Donaven, a 41-year-old hair salon owner.</p>
<p>Mississippi’s largest city said record cold is breaking water mains, leaving some customers with little or no water flow.</p>
<p>Jackson city spokeswoman Kai Williams said Wednesday evening that the city knew of 37 separate water main breaks that it attributed to cold. The city has declared an emergency and is hiring outside contractors to help repair water main breaks.</p>
<p>Blizzard warnings were issued from Rhode Island to Maine. Oravec said he expects they could be extended as far south as parts of New York.</p>
<p>“It’s sort of akin to a hurricane traveling up the coast,” says Ryan Maue, a meteorologist at the private firm Weather.US.</p>
<p>Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal declared a state of emergency through Friday for 28 counties. School systems on the Alabama coast waived uniform requirements so students could bundle up.</p>
<p>As the cold pushed farther northward, Jerry Gorans found himself stunned by the frigid temperatures as he walked along the waterfront City Dock of Annapolis, Maryland, where birds stood still on icy water.</p>
<p>“This is the coldest I’ve been in probably 50 years,” said Gorans, who lives in Fresno, California, and was visiting his wife’s family in Maryland. “I mean, this is freezing cold. My feet hurt, my ears hurt.”</p>

<p>COLUMBUS, OHIO (AP) — Ohio printed out 35,000 new license plates before realizing a banner depicted on the plate was attached to the wrong end of the Wright Brothers’ historic first plane, the Wright Flyer.</p>

<p>“We will recycle the 35,000 plates that had been printed. It is too early to know about if there will be any additional cost,” said Lindsey Bohrer, assistant director of communications with the Ohio Department of Public Safety. </p>

<p>POOLESVILLE, Md. (AP) — A Maryland home was accidentally burned to the ground by an owner trying to get rid of a snake infestation, officials said. </p>

<p>NEW YORK (AP) — With Wednesday’s guilty verdict in the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, here’s a look at what the once high-flying Jeffrey Epstein confidante was accused of and what’s next for her:</p>
<p>WHO WERE GHISLAINE MAXWELL’S ACCUSERS?</p>
<p>The prosecution hinged on the accusations of four women — Annie Farmer and the pseudonymous Jane, Kate and Carolyn — who say they were teenagers when Maxwell and Epstein sexually exploited them in the 1990s and early 2000s. </p>
<p>ON WHAT CHARGES WAS GHISLAINE MAXWELL CONVICTED?</p>
<p>The trial focused on six counts:</p>
<p>1. conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts</p>
<p>2. enticement of a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts</p>
<p>3. conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity</p>
<p>4. transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity</p>
