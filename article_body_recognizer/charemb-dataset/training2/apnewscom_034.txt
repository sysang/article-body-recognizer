<div><div><h1>Chinese developer asking bondholders to postpone repayment</h1></div><div>January 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>BEIJING (AP) — A troubled Chinese real estate developer with $310 billion of debt is asking investors in one of its bonds to postpone when they will be repaid.</p>
<p>Evergrande Group will conduct a three-day online vote starting Friday for holders of the 4.5 billion yuan ($700 million) bond, according to an announcement made through the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in southern China.</p>
<p>Evergrande, the global real estate industry’s most indebted competitor, said the bond is due to mature in January 2023. It gave no indication how long investors would be asked to postpone repayment.</p>
<p>Evergrande says it has 2.3 trillion yuan ($350 billion) in assets and 2 trillion yuan ($310 billion in debt), but it is struggling to sell real estate and other assets fast enough to keep up payments to bondholders and other creditors.</p>
<p>Beijing appears to be trying to avoid bailing out Evergrande to avoid sending the companies as the ruling Communist Party tries to force them to reduce their debt loads.</p>

<div><div><h1>Fire reignites at South Africa’s Parliament in Cape Town</h1></div><div>By GERALD IMRAYJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — The fire that has already destroyed South Africa’s main Parliament chamber flared up again Monday about 36 hours after it started in the 130-year-old complex of historic buildings, authorities said. </p>
<p>Before the blaze reignited, authorities had said it had been contained and had begun to assess the damage. The fire had started around 6 a.m. on Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The man is also facing charges under South Africa’s National Key Points Act, a security law that restricts access to government buildings and other places of national importance.</p>
<p>Parliament was closed for the holidays and no injuries have been reported in the fire.</p>
<p>“We are indeed devastated,” Parliament said.</p>
<p>“We stand in front of a broken Parliament, a burnt down Parliament,” lawmaker Natasha Mazzone said at the gates of the complex before the fire reignited. “Look at our roof, our beautiful roof, burnt, collapsed.”</p>
<p>“The National Assembly chamber is completely destroyed. I’ve seen it for myself. Everything is destroyed. This will take an operation second to none to rebuild,” she said.</p>
<p>Firefighters had been working on “hotspots” in the National Assembly building on Monday morning, Carelse said, but it was largely contained at that stage and the fire crews had been scaled back.</p>
<p>As the fire was originally brought under control, what was left was blackened, unrecognizable ruins inside some of the rooms.</p>
<p>“This is an incredibly sad day if you are a normal human being, to stand in front of this building and realize what we’ve lost,” lawmaker Mazzone said. </p>
<p>Patricia de Lille, the Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, said that someone had turned off a valve which prevented a fire sprinkler system from functioning. </p>

<p>Johnson was speaking after The Sunday Times newspaper reported that a group of hospitals in the eastern county of Lincolnshire had declared a “critical incident” due to “extreme and unprecedented” staff shortages.</p>

<p>And Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation that represents 1.5 million health workers, said much of the health service is in “a state of crisis” that’s exacerbated by a high demand for services and staff absences.</p>
<p>“Some hospitals are making urgent calls to exhausted staff to give up rest days and leave to enable them to sustain core services. Many more hospitals are having to ban visitors to try to reduce the spread of infection,” he said.</p>
<p>Johnson on Monday urged people to adhere to those rules and get a booster vaccination shot, as the government seeks to shore up staffing shortages.</p>
<p>But Johnson appeared to rule out any tightening of measures in coming days.</p>
<p>“I think the way forward for the country as a whole is to continue with the path that we’re on. We’ll will keep everything under review,” he said.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the mask guidance is intended to rein in transmission of the virus.</p>

<p>Across Europe, schools were reopening or preparing for another new term overshadowed by the global pandemic.</p>
<p>Children returned to class on Monday in several parts of Germany, where patchy testing and reporting over the holiday period means that the level of infections was somewhat uncertain.</p>
<p>Testing “is already an absolute routine at school, before classes, and we want to keep it,” she said.</p>
<p>Over 12 million French children returned to school Monday, with new rules aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. French children from the age of 6 have been required to wear a face mask in classrooms since November.</p>

<div><div><h1>EXPLAINER: What’s next after resignation of Sudan’s PM?</h1></div><div>By SAMY MAGDYJanuary 3, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>CAIRO (AP) — Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok’s resignation has plunged the country’s already fragile democratic transition into further turmoil.</p>
<p>The Oct. 25 takeover came more than two years after a popular uprising forced the removal of longtime autocrat Omar al-Bashir and his Islamist government after nearly three decades in power.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at what happened and what comes next:</p>
<p>On Oct. 25, the military dissolved Hamdok’s transitional government and the Sovereign Council, a power-sharing body of military officers and civilians that had been ruling Sudan since late 2019.</p>
<p>The military arrested Hamdok and several other senior officials and political leaders.</p>
<p>Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, the coup’s architect and head of the Sovereign Council, announced that the military would hold power until elections can be held in July 2023.</p>
<p>He said a government of technocrats would be formed to administer the country until elections are held.</p>
<p>Burhan came under mounting international pressure, with Western, Arab and African nations calling for a return to civilian rule. The U.S. suspended $700 million in aid as it strongly condemned the coup.</p>
<p><a>The military allowed Hamdok to return to his residence the following day,</a> and and the two sides eventually reached <a>an agreement </a> in November that reinstated the prime minister but sidelined the pro-democracy movement.</p>
<p><a>Government officials and political leaders detained in the coup </a> were also released as part of the November deal.</p>
<p>The generals have portrayed the reinstatement of Hamdok as a step toward stabilizing the country ahead of elections and the international community has cautiously welcomed the agreement and called for pre-coup arrangements.</p>
<p>Hamdok has defended his deal with the military, saying that he stuck it mainly to prevent bloodshed and help return to a path of democratic transition.</p>
<p>WHERE DOES THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT STAND?</p>
<a>reports that at least 13 women and girls suffered sexual violence, including rape or gang rape by security forces.</a>
<p>While groups leading the street protests insist that power be handed to a fully civilian government to lead the transition, the generals are not willing to step aside.</p>
<p>Burhan has repeatedly said the military would hand over power only to an elected government. That position is likely to prolong the stalemate as the country faces uphill security and economic challenges.</p>
<p>Volker Perthes, the U.N. envoy for Sudan, has urged citizens to engage in talks to find a way out of the crisis, saying the U.N. mission is ready to facilitate.</p>
<p>Cameron Hudson, a former U.S. State Department official and Sudan expert at the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center, called for the international community to help shape what comes next in Sudan.</p>
<p>“Now, our nation is going through a dangerous turning point that could threaten its entire survival unless it is urgently rectified,” Hamdok said.</p>

<p>JERUSALEM (AP) — Two Israeli pilots were killed when a navy helicopter crashed off Israel’s Mediterranean coast late Monday near the northern city of Haifa, the Israeli military announced.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash was under investigation.</p>
<p>The chief of the Israeli Air Force has ordered immediate suspension of all training flights and the use of helicopters from the same array of the doomed aircraft.</p>
<p>The families of the pilots have been notified. “The IDF expresses its heartfelt condolences to the families and will continue to support them,” the statement said.</p>
<div><div><h1>Fighting intensifies in eastern Colombia; at least 23 killed</h1></div><div>By MANUEL RUEDA and ASTRID SUAREZJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — At least 23 people were killed in Colombia this weekend and 20 had to flee their homes as fighting between rebel groups intensified in the eastern state of Arauca, Colombia’s Defense Minister said Monday.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch said it has received reports of 24 deaths, as well as forced displacements and abductions. </p>
<p>“It appears that the alliance between the ELN and dissidents with the 10th Front of the FARC in the zone has broken,” said the group’s Colombia expert, Juan Pappier.</p>
<p>Arauca last year received hundreds of refugees who fled from neighboring Venezuela following fighting between the Venezuelan army and FARC splinter groups that also operate on the Venezuelan side of the border.</p>
<p>The ELN guerrillas initiated peace talks with the Colombian government in 2017, but those broke down following an attack on a police academy that killed 23 people.</p>

<p>JACKSON, Miss. — Hospitalizations for COVID-19 continue rising rapidly in Mississippi as new cases proliferate.</p>
<p>The state Health Department reported that 695 people with confirmed cases of COVID-19 were hospitalized Sunday. That is up from 265 hospitalized two weeks earlier, on Dec. 19.</p>
<p>The department also reported Monday that 17,525 new cases of the virus were confirmed in the state from Thursday through Sunday.</p>
<p>These are some of the highest numbers in months.</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — Costumed revelers will mark the beginning of New Orleans’ annual Carnival season this week with a ride on a historic streetcar — carrying out a cherished tradition despite recent surges in COVID-19 infections.</p>
<p>A Monday announcement from the Phunny Phorty Phellows organization says participants “will be wearing masks covering their mouths as well as their eyes” when their streetcar rumbles down the tracks on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Carnival season begins each year on Jan. 6, the 12th night after Christmas. It ends with nearly two weeks of opulent parades that culminate on Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, which falls on March 1 this year.</p>
<p>Festivities, including major parades that bring thousands to the streets, were largely canceled in 2021.</p>
<p>There had been concerns that the 2020 Mardi Gras celebration had been an unintended “super spreader” of coronavirus in the early days of the pandemic.</p>
<p>This year, city officials are moving ahead with plans for major parades in February, with precautions including vaccine or testing requirements for float riders and customers of bars, restaurants and other public places.</p>
<p>Louisiana’s governor said last week that the state is setting records for new COVID-19 diagnoses, and the omicron variant surge is just beginning. </p>
<p>TOPEKA, Kan. — Kansas has reported a record seven-day average for new confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Kansas has now reported more than 534,000 cases for the pandemic or more than one for every six of its 2.9 million residents.</p>
<p>The state also averaged 38 new COVID-19 hospitalizations and 11 new reported deaths a day for the seven days ending Monday. The new numbers came as the state starts to see reports of the omicron variant spreading.</p>
<p>While the average for new hospitalizations isn’t a record, hospitals are still under stress, both because of new patients and infections among employees.</p>
<p>PHOENIX — Arizona health officials on Monday reported the highest number of new COVID-19 cases in a year.</p>
<p>The 14,192 new cases were the most ever tallied in a day except for Jan. 3, 2020, when more than 17,000 cases were counted.</p>
<p>The state Health Services Department said the new case count was boosted by lower than normal reporting on Sunday, when just 701 new cases were reported. However, the state said there has been a steep upward trend of cases in recent days.</p>
<p>According to Johns Hopkins University data, the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Arizona has risen sharply over the past two weeks from 2,945 new cases per day on Dec. 18 to 5,051 new cases per day on Jan. 1.</p>
<p>The state reported no new deaths on Monday and just one on Sunday, bringing the total number of people who died from the virus in Arizona since the pandemic began in early 2020 to 24,355.</p>
<p>The seven-day average rate of infection at the Capitol’s testing center has risen from less than 1% to more than 13%, Brian P. Monahan, the attending physician, wrote in a letter to congressional leaders obtained by The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Providing no figure, he said “most” of the cases are breakthroughs.</p>
<p>Monahan urged congressional offices to “reduce in-person meetings and in-office activities to the maximum extent possible.”</p>
<p>MISSION, Kan. — One of Kansas’ largest hospitals is straining to treat an influx of COVID-19 patients even as the surging virus sidelines hundreds of doctors and nurses.</p>
<p>The illnesses come as the hospital is treating 108 COVID-19 patients, up from 40 on Dec. 1.</p>
<p>He said vaccination would have prevented all but a handful of the COVID-19 patients from being hospitalized, freeing up beds for other patients.</p>
<p>NEW ORLEANS — A new vaccine and testing requirement is kicking in for children from the ages of 5 to 11 in New Orleans to battle the coronavirus. </p>
<p>Local media report that children in those age groups must now be vaccinated or show proof of a recent negative coronavirus test to visit certain locations in the city such as restaurants. </p>
<p>The new mandate comes as coronavirus cases have skyrocketed across the country, driven by the highly contagious omicron variant. </p>
<p>The mandate was announced in December by Mayor LaToya Cantrell. It already applies to adults and children 12 and up. </p>
<p>Starting on Feb. 1 the coronavirus vaccine will also be included in the list of required vaccines for children to attend school, although there is an option for families to opt out of the requirement.</p>
<p>PARIS — France’s lower house of parliament is voting Monday on a government plan to require full vaccination to enter restaurants, tourist sites, sports facilities and other venues.</p>
<p>Under the government’s draft, the vaccine pass would also be required on domestic flights and inter-regional trains and buses, cinemas and theaters.</p>
<p>Currently unvaccinated people can get the “health pass” required to enter such sites if they test negative for the virus or recently recovered. More than 90% of French adults are vaccinated, but several million have not been inoculated.</p>
<p>Premier Doug Ford also announced the closure of indoor dining. Gyms and cinemas will also close. Ontario is seeing record new infections and there are concerns about hospital capacity.</p>
<p>“I know online learning is not ideal,” Ford said. “The fact is omicron spreads like wildfire.”</p>
<p>The reopening of schools has been delayed until at least Jan. 17. Just last week, the government announced schools would open on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Schools shut down for in-person learning last April because of record cases driven by the delta variant but had since resumed. Hospitals have also been told to pause all non-urgent surgeries and procedures in order to preserve critical care.</p>
<p>LISBON, Portugal — A senior Portuguese health official says almost 90% of COVID-19 patients in intensive care have not been vaccinated against the coronavirus.</p>
<p>He said that compared with a year ago, Portugal is recording fewer than a third of the patients in hospital, fewer than a quarter in ICUs and fewer than one-fifth of deaths.</p>
<p>He said Monday the government is not planning to postpone the scheduled return of schoolchildren to classes next Monday.</p>
<p>ROME — At least 100 passengers aboard a cruise ship in the Mediterranean have tested positive for COVID-19, according to Italian news reports.</p>
<p>Italian state TV’s RaiNews24 said that the passengers testing positive numbered 150 aboard the MSC Grandiosa, which docked on Monday in Genoa, and that most of them of were Italian.</p>
<p>Genoa daily Il Secolo XIX reported that about 40 of those who tested positive got off the cruise liner in Genoa, while others would be disembarked in Civitavecchia, a port that serves Rome, or in Palermo, Sicily.</p>
<p>The cruise company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The newspaper said there were nearly some 4,000 passengers in all aboard the ship, which reached Genoa after sailing from Marseille, France.</p>
<p>SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea says it has confirmed its first death related to the new omicron variant.</p>
<p>The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said on Monday that the deceased was in their 90s and living at a nursing home in the southern city of Gwangju. It says the person received a second dose of COVID-19 vaccine in October.</p>
<p>A total of 21 people in the facility have tested positive for COVID-19 — three of them with the omicron variant — since the first case was reported there on Dec. 24.</p>
<p>The agency says the patient was posthumously found to have contracted the omicron variant. Health authorities were examining whether another person who died at the Gwangju facility had also been infected with the variant.</p>
<p>South Korea has so far confirmed 1,318 cases of the omicron variant. Experts say it will likely soon replace the delta variant to become dominant in South Korea.</p>

<p>Theary Seng was on her way to a court hearing and was livestreaming her progress via social media when a number of uniformed men surrounded her and blocked her way.</p>
<p>Journalists at the scene say security forces then put her into a car and took her away.</p>
<p>She was released, shortly afterwards, and arrived at Phnom Penh Municipal Court for the resumption of her trial on treason charges. She was still wearing the orange outfit, but court officials asked her to remove the ankle shackles. </p>
<p>Theary Seng is an outspoken critic of Prime Minister Hun Sen who has been in power for 36 years and has kept a tight leash on all political activity in the country.</p>
<p>Theary Seng lived through the brutal Khmer Rouge era as a child, during which she lost both her parents. She left for America where she qualified as a lawyer, then returned to Cambodia in 1995.</p>
<p>At least 1.7 million Cambodians are estimated to have died under the brutal rule of the ultra-Maoist movement during its almost four-year rule, from April 1975 to January 1979.</p>
<p>44 other people are being tried on the same charges, but last month a judge ordered Theary Seng’s trial split off from the others.</p>
<p>Hun Sen says he intends to stay in office until 2028. Last December, he endorsed one of his sons to be his successor.</p>

<div><div><h1>Future of prayer site in doubt under Israel’s fragile govt</h1></div><div>By TIA GOLDENBERGJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The Western Wall is considered the holiest site where Jews can pray. Under ultra-Orthodox management, the wall is currently separated between men’s and women’s prayer sections. </p>
<p>American Jews have long lamented that Israel should be as accepting of their religious practices as they are of their financial and political support.</p>
<p>The new government, led by Prime Minister Naftali Bennett — the child of American immigrants — brought hope that the plan may be revived.</p>
<p>Under Bennett’s leadership, contacts between U.S. liberal Jewish leaders and Israeli government officials have surged. Bennett himself met with the leaders in what was perceived as a major step in repairing ties.</p>
<p>“We need to be careful. The make-up of this government is complex,” Diaspora Affairs Minister Nachman Shai told The Associated Press. </p>
<p>He said that Bennett had decided to hold off on the plan for now. “My bet is that it will happen in the end but it won’t happen tomorrow or the next day.” </p>
<p>Bennett’s government is taking steps to loosen the ultra-Orthodox hold. It has passed a reform in kosher certifications for restaurants and is attempting to allow conversions to Judaism outside of the ultra-Orthodox rabbinate.</p>
<p>Rick Jacobs, president of the Union for Reform Judaism, said that if implemented, the agreement would open the door to other steps toward religious pluralism in Israel.</p>
<p>“This is an issue that won’t change everything, but it will change and symbolically shifts things towards more respect or legitimacy,” he said. “I hope this government will find the political will to do it.”</p>

<p>One of the newest members of his congregation is Luis Perozo, 31, a former police officer from Maracaibo, Venezuela who arrived in Spain in February 2020 and applied for asylum with his wife, Narbic Escalante, 35.</p>
<p>While the couple wait for their status to be resolved, Perozo works in the laundry of a hotel. His wife does nursing in a retirement home. </p>

<p>“I was a lifelong Catholic,” says Escalante. “When I arrived in Salamanca, I entered the church, looked everywhere, said hello, and they ignored me. I went to several churches — I felt absolutely nothing.”</p>
<p>Perozo and Escalante soon visited Albright´s church — one of Perozo´s uncles had emigrated earlier and was already a member. </p>
<p>“The next day, Pastor Albright was helping us find a house, appliances and kitchenware. He moved us with his van,” Escalante said. </p>
<p>She commended Albright’s approach to pastoring, including services with lively music and less emphasis on repetitive prayer.</p>
<p>“I definitely feel better here than in the Catholic Church,” she says. “It allows me to live more freely, with less inhibitions.”</p>
<p>Before she and her husband were baptized at Albright’s church, she visited a Catholic priest. She recalls him responding, “If it makes you feel at peace with yourself, go. You’re not committing any sin.”</p>
<p>Albright sees similar reactions among other Latin American immigrants.</p>
<p>When they go to a Catholic church, he says, “they don’t feel that their problems are understood.”</p>
<p>“Latinos generally have a desire to participate in worship,” he added. “They need to have an active part in the celebration. The Catholic church feels static to them.”</p>
<p>With the arrival of the euro currency two decades ago, Spain experienced an economic boom that fueled migration. In 2000, there were 471,465 legally registered migrants in Spain; there are now about 7.2 million.</p>
<p>Albright was so intrigued by this phenomenon that he wrote a Ph.D. thesis about it at the University of Salamanca. He estimated that 20% of the migrants are evangelicals.</p>
<p>The last official census conducted by the Justice Ministry’s Observatory of Religious Pluralism found 1.96% of Spain’s population was Protestant in 2018 — more than 900,000 people. That’s up from 96,000 tallied in 1998.</p>
<p>The church’s challenges are evident in the province of Zamora, just north of Salamanca, which has lost 16% of its population since 2000. There are 304 parishes and only about 130 priests serving them. </p>
<p>“Now it is the other way around,” Rivera said. “I saw the need for priests in Spain and I thought of offering myself. I never liked easy things.”</p>
<p>Overall, about 10% of the Catholic priests now serving in Spain were born elsewhere. The influx is welcome, given that the average age for a priest in Spain today is about 65.</p>
<p>How is it difficult for Rivera? “I am a missionary priest announcing the Gospel in a place that is not my culture,” he said. “I have to learn.”</p>
<p>He and Ortega strive to be good teammates. While Ortega blessed parishioners during one recent celebration, Rivera managed the church’s sound system via Bluetooth and changed the music tracks and volume from his phone.</p>
<p>They’ve both gone dancing with some residents of Morales del Vino, a small town where Ortega is the parish priest, winning praise from one of the revelers, 23-year-old lawyer Juan Manuel Pedrón.</p>
<p>“If the church wants to support us it has to be normal, it has to be with us, with the young people and do what we do,” Pedrón says. </p>
<p>His girlfriend, Tania Rey, 27, was on her first visit to Morales del Vino. </p>
<p>“In my town, the priest circulates with old ladies,” she said. “I am very shocked to see these two priests like this.”</p>
<p>She and Pedrón teased Rivera, saying he dances better than they do. </p>
<p>The next day, after Sunday Mass, Rivera organized a gathering at the community center where he officiated. The official church building, 300 years old, is falling down.</p>
<p>“The walls of the church are giving way inward, the roof is in danger. We need to see what the strategy is for repair,” he says, explaining that gifts from parishioners will be needed to supplement the diocese’s repair budget.</p>
<p>The group then heads to the village bar; Rivera orders a glass of chilled white wine and sits with some of the parishioners. </p>
<p>His challenges are varied, he says. “I have to see how to ask for help to repair the church ... and get used to coming to the bar.” </p>
<p>He couldn’t imagine drinking a beer at a bar in his Salvadoran hometown after Mass. “But if this is where people gather and how people socialize here, this is where I have to be too.”</p>
<p>But the momentum — in terms of church attendance and energy — is going in the other direction, toward the burgeoning ranks of Pentecostal and other evangelical congregations.</p>
<p>Many of those congregations rent space in industrial buildings on the outskirts of cities and towns — often filling them with zealous worshippers even as many large, centuries-old Catholic churches empty out.</p>
<p>One such Pentecostal venue in Salamanca has as neighbors a large carpentry shop and another evangelical church. On a recent Friday night, it hosted a rite of passage for Melanie Villalobos to celebrate her turning 13.</p>
<p>Pastor Nedyt Lescano, 62, who came from Argentina in 2000, was mostly silent during the ceremony, but invited everyone to meet again Sunday morning. </p>
<p>“This life is worth very little and the relationship with God is worth everything,” goes one of the lyrics.</p>
<p>It’s a bit like karaoke. The lyrics are projected on the wall, people sing along, gesturing and gyrating to the rhythm. Some seem in a trance, others cry out with emotion.</p>
<p>About 50 people are on hand, trying to comply with coronavirus social-distancing restrictions.</p>
<p>Lescano doesn’t say much during the ceremony, letting the worshippers testify about challenges they faced and prayers that were answered.</p>
<p>In Lescano’s services, there’s a moving moment when she asks for help in paying the rent for the premises, along with other expenses, and the faithful, one by one, put an envelope in a cloth bag. </p>
<p>“Unlike the Catholic church, we don’t receive any subsidies. We do it all by our own efforts here,” Lescano says.</p>
<p>Lescano often feels like a psychologist, as well as a pastor, for those flocking to the makeshift church.</p>
<p>“Immigrants feel lonely and isolated, in a strange country, and here they receive love and hugs,” she said. “Here they come and share, take pounds of weight and anxiety off their bodies and minds.”</p>

<p>BEIJING (AP) — A senior Chinese arms control official denied Tuesday that his government is rapidly expanding its nuclear arsenal, though he said it is taking steps to modernize its nuclear forces.</p>
<p>Fu Cong, director general of the Foreign Ministry’s arms control department, said China is working to ensure its nuclear deterrent meets the minimum level necessary for national defense.</p>
<p>“On the assertions made by U.S. officials that China is expanding dramatically its nuclear capabilities, first, let me say that this is untrue,” he said at a briefing in Beijing. </p>
<p>The U.S. Defense Department said in a report in November that China is expanding its nuclear force faster than previously predicted and could have more than 1,000 warheads by 2030. The U.S. has 3,750 nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The U.S. has also raised concern about analyst reports based on satellite imagery that China is <a>building missile silos</a> in its northwestern desert and its <a>test of a hypersonic missile</a> last summer. </p>
<p>Fu would not confirm the missile silos but said the size of China’s nuclear force should not be estimated based on the satellite photos.</p>
<a>deploying intermediate-range </a> non-nuclear missiles in the region. India also has nuclear weapons, as does its neighbor Pakistan.
<p>Fu stuck by the Chinese position that it would not join nuclear arms reduction talks between the U.S. and Russia, as the American side is pushing for. He called on both to reduce their arsenals, by far the largest in the world. </p>
<a>seems unlikely </a> given the reports of China’s growing nuclear force and tensions with China over Taiwan and with Russia over Ukraine.

<p>BERLIN (AP) — Germany’s environmentalist Greens came out Tuesday in favor of a second term for President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, leaving the head of state well-placed to win another five years in office.</p>
<p>The Greens were the last of the three parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s new government to endorse Steinmeier, who was a longtime member of Scholz’s center-left Social Democrats. </p>
<p>Before becoming president, Steinmeier served two stints as Chancellor Angela Merkel’s foreign minister and previously was chief of staff to Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. </p>
<p>Some figures in Merkel’s center-right Union bloc, which is now in opposition, have called for their party to nominate a woman for the presidency. Germany hasn’t yet had a female head of state.</p>

<p>BERLIN (AP) — An Albanian man who disappeared after serving part of a sentence for his role in the killing of a high-ranking police officer in his homeland two decades ago has been arrested at Frankfurt Airport, German police said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 42-year-old, whose name wasn’t released, was arrested on New Year’s Day as he tried to depart for Istanbul, federal police said in a statement.</p>
<p>They said Albanian authorities were seeking the man on an international arrest warrant and that he and his father killed the police official in 2000. He was released on bail in November 2017 and then disappeared.</p>
<p>The man is in custody awaiting extradition to Albania, German police said.</p>

<p>HELSINKI (AP) — A 49-year-old woman from Sweden has been charged with war crimes and breaching international law for allegedly assisting in getting her son to fight in Syria as a child soldier, Swedish public prosecutors said on Tuesday. </p>
<p>The Swedish Prosecution Authority said in a statement this is the first time that the country has brought war crimes charges against an individual for abetting in recruiting child soldiers. </p>
<p>Prosecutors said there is “an absolute ban” on allowing children under 15 to directly take part in hostilities during an armed conflict.</p>
<p>She said the woman’s actions were considered extreme because the boy “was recruited and used as a child soldier by a terrorist organization in warfare that was extremely ruthless and brutal.”</p>
<p>The woman has denied all charges, prosecutors said.</p>
<div><div><h1>Record number of migrant boats crossed Channel in 2021</h1></div><div>January 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>LONDON (AP) — At least 28,300 people packed into small boats crossed the Channel from France to England’s south coast in 2021, an annual record that was three times the number of crossings a year earlier.</p>
<p>The risks were tragically underscored on Nov. 24, when at least 27 migrants drowned as their boat sank after leaving France. The crossings have become a source of tension between France and Britain.</p>
<p>The figures also show that the boats are getting larger, with an average of 28 people on board each vessel that arrived in the UK, up from just over 13 a year earlier.</p>

<p>Activists are calling for the British government to offer more opportunities to asylum-seekers in a bid to decrease the number of Channel crossings. </p>
<p>Tim Naor Hilton, chief executive at Refugee Action, said that the U.K. government’s policy will lead to more deaths in the Dover Strait.</p>
<p>“People will continue to cross the Channel in flimsy boats, and smugglers will continue to profit, unless ministers open up more routes for refugees to claim asylum here,” Naor Hilton said.</p>
<p>Clare Moseley, founder of charity Care4Calais which supports refugees living in northern France, agreed.</p>
<p>“If the government were serious about stopping people smugglers, it would create a safe way for people to claim asylum and put people smugglers out of business once and for all,” she said.</p>
<p>But Home Office minister Tom Pursglove said that “seeking asylum for protection should not involve people asylum shopping country to country, or risking their lives by lining the pockets of criminal gangs to cross the Channel.”</p>
<p>When the reforms were introduced to Parliament in July, Naor Hilton said they were “built on a deep lack of understanding of the reality of refugee migration.”</p>

<p>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — OPEC and allied oil-producing countries decided Tuesday to pump more oil to the world economy amid hope that travel and demand for fuel will hold up despite the rapid spread of the omicron variant of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The 23-member OPEC+ alliance led by oil cartel member Saudi Arabia and non-member Russia said it would add 400,000 barrels per day in February, sticking with a road map to slowly restore cuts in output made during the depths of the pandemic.</p>

<p>JERUSALEM (AP) — A Palestinian prisoner who has been on hunger strike for over 140 days to protest being imprisoned without charge agreed Tuesday to end his fast after reaching a deal with Israel to be released next month, his lawyer said.</p>
<p>His lawyer, Jawad Boulos, said he agreed to end the hunger strike after Israel pledged to release him on Feb. 26. There was no immediate comment from Israeli officials.</p>
<p>The Prisoners’ Club, which represents former and current Palestinian prisoners, hailed the strike as a victory. It said Abu Hawash had previously spent eight years in Israeli prisons, more than half of it in administrative detention.</p>

<p>Despite soaring infection rates, government policy is being driven by figures showing omicron is causing fewer serious illnesses than previous variants.</p>
<p>While the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 is rising, the number of people requiring mechanical ventilation has remained relatively stable. </p>
<p>There were 14,210 COVID-19 patients in hospitals across England on Jan. 3, the highest number since Feb. 20 of last year. But there were 777 people on ventilators, a figure that has remained steady for the past six weeks.</p>

<p>PARIS (AP) — Three women in France were found dead on New Year’s Day, allegedly killed by their partners, despite efforts by President Emmanuel Macron’s government to rein in deadly domestic violence.</p>
<p>In all three cases, the men told police they themselves were at fault, according to local media reports. </p>
<p>Feminist groups are crying for more action and 1 billion euros in funding to train all French police and ensure better protection for those targeted by abusive partners.</p>
<p>“Three women killed in 24 hours and their only reaction is to organize a little meeting days later?” asked Marylie Breuil of activist group Nous Toutes. “No, their work isn’t done.”</p>
<p>The three deaths were especially shocking after high-profile efforts by the French government to prevent such killings, and by French activists and media to shine a light on them.</p>
<p>The same day in northeast France, a 56-year-old woman was found stabbed to death in the town of Labry, and her partner acknowledged killing her in an argument, local news site Lorrain Actu quoted the regional prosecutor as saying.</p>
<p>Moreno called all three “femicides,” or the killing of a woman or girl because of her gender.</p>
<p>Activists who calculate such killings say 113 women in France lost their lives at the hands of current or former partners last year, compared to 102 in 2020 and 152 in 2019, when Macron launched a nationwide campaign against domestic violence.</p>

<p>Farther south in Los Cabos, hotels were at 75% of their capacity during the week of Christmas, according to the federal Tourism ministry.</p>
<p>“In December, January, tourism took off,” said Isrrael Coto, manager of a hotel-restaurant in La Ventana, about 20 miles south of La Paz. “People are tired of the confinement.”</p>
<p>Infections shot up too. Baja California Sur saw 700 new infections Dec. 29, compared to a previous high in July of fewer than 600. </p>
<p>On the opposite coast, Quintana Roo, went from 27 cases Dec. 20 to 484 eight days later, though that remained below its single-day high of 574 in August.</p>
<p>“This new variant (omicron) is very contagious, but fortunately it is not requiring hospitalization, nor do we have cases of rising deaths,” President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mexico experienced its worst moments of the pandemic a year earlier when hospitals were overwhelmed and test-confirmed COVID-19 deaths were above 1,400 daily. The real numbers were surely even higher because of limited testing.</p>

<p>However, the summer wave that peaked in August with more than 25,000 new infections in a single day was even higher.</p>
<p>Coto considered the return of tourists to the beaches positive, but recognized there was concern over the rise in infections. </p>
<p>“There’s a little nervousness,” he said. “The vaccine helped a little to give some certainty, but even so.”</p>
<p>Daniela Yepiz, a stylist in La Paz, said concern seemed to grow after infections rose in the days after Christmas, citing a lot of cancelations. “The people stopped coming,” she said.</p>
<p>Mexico has vaccinated 88% of adults and has started giving a third dose to the elderly, health workers. Teachers will begin receiving the booster in the coming days.</p>
<p>González encouraged people to remain careful. “We shouldn’t say we’re going to come out of it yet.”</p>

<p>UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The U.N. Security Council got five new members Tuesday, as Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana and the United Arab Emirates formally took up the posts they won in an election in June.</p>
<p>The 15-member council is the U.N.’s most powerful body. China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States are permanent members, with veto power.</p>
<p>Other members are elected by the 193-member General Assembly for staggered, two-year terms that are allocated by global regions. </p>
<p>Estonia, Niger, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia and Vietnam finished their terms Friday. </p>

<p>Countries often campaign for seats for years. Winning gives them a say on peacekeeping missions and the council’s other approaches to conflict hotspots, plus a strong voice on overarching issues of international peace and security. </p>
<p>Council members also can convene meetings on security topics of particular interest to them, and smaller countries get to share a prominent platform with world powers.</p>
<p>Albania is joining for the first time, while Brazil is taking an 11th turn. Gabon and Ghana each have been on the council three times before and the UAE once.</p>
<p>More than 50 of the U.N.’s 193 member countries have never been elected to the council since it formed in 1946. </p>

<p>AUSTIN, Texas — Texas officials indicated Tuesday that thousands of National Guard members are refusing COVID-19 vaccines in the latest challenge against a Biden administration order that requires all members of the military to get one. </p>
<p>A lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton comes a week after a federal judge rejected a similar challenge brought by Oklahoma’s governor, amid growing Republican opposition to the vaccination mandate for Guard members. </p>
<p>It added that more than 200 airmen in the the Texas Guard are also refusing the vaccine.</p>

<p>— Fauci says CDC may add test requirement for infected people ending isolation</p>
<p>— Pentagon chief Austin says he has <a>tested positive </a> for COVID</p>
<p>— British government <a>rushing tests to schools</a></p>
<p>HERE’S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TODAY:</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — Several California school districts praised efforts to test students and staff before the return to classrooms this week, saying it kept numerous positive COVID-19 cases off campuses.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to see this testing regimen work the way we hoped it would, keeping sick people at home,” Oakland’s Superintendent Kyla Johnson-Trammell said in a statement.</p>
<p>Both districts serve about 50,000 students each.</p>
<p>LA PAZ, Mexico — COVID-19 infections are rising across Mexico, especially in two states home to major tourism destinations on the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean that were busy during the holiday season.</p>
<p>President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Tuesday that despite the new variant being very contagious, the country was not seeing rising hospitalizations.</p>
<p>Mexico has vaccinated 88% of adults and has started giving a third shot to the elderly as well as health care workers. Teachers will begin receiving the booster in the coming days.</p>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS — The Indiana Department of Health say it has limited who is eligible for rapid COVID-19 tests at state-run sites due to high demand and a surge of cases amid the spread of the omicron variant. </p>
<p>Under new state guidance, rapid antigen tests at state and local health department testing sites will only available to those 18 or younger, regardless of symptoms, or those who are 50 and older, but symptomatic. </p>
<p>The department said the change is necessary “due to the national shortage of rapid antigen tests.” </p>
<p>Health officials said the new protocols will ensure students can stay in school and so residents who are most likely to need a monoclonal antibody can get it within the prescribed window.</p>
<p>DETROIT — Students in the Detroit school district will resume classes at home with laptops, at least through Jan. 14.</p>
<p>The district said Tuesday that online learning is necessary until the city’s COVID-19 infection rates decrease.</p>
<p>The holiday break for more than 40,000 students in the Detroit district will end Thursday.</p>
<p>Michigan’s case numbers have caused many schools to delay the start of January classes or switch to online learning. About 37% of eligible Detroit residents are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, far below the statewide figure.</p>
<p>Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System is “bracing for one of the bleakest months” of the pandemic, said Dr. Dennis Cunningham, director of infection control, citing the likely spread of COVID-19 during holiday gatherings.</p>
<p>Michigan reported an average of 12,200 new daily cases from last Thursday through Monday. </p>
<p>“This pandemic is not slowing down and we are still surging,” Cunningham told reporters Tuesday.</p>
<p>MISSION, Kan. — Kansas health officials warned of a “dangerous moment” as one school district reimposed masks and another eased up on them during a meeting so contentious that the audience was removed.</p>
<p>Superintendent Michelle Hubbard described the contentiousness of the meeting in a briefing Tuesday as “disappointing, to say the least” and noted that the board has been under tremendous pressure. </p>
<p>Hubbard said the district started the academic year 250 employees short and has struggled to find enough bus drivers, food service workers and substitute teachers. She said the situation is expected to get worse as omicron takes hold.</p>
<p>OMAHA, Neb. — The meat processing industry, which was hit hard by the spread of COVID-19 early in the pandemic, has weathered the recent surge in virus cases across the country without cutting production.</p>
<p>NEW YORK -- The omicron variant accounted for 95% of new coronavirus infections last week, according to U.S. health officials’ latest estimates.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention posted its newest estimates Tuesday. The CDC uses genomic surveillance data to make projections about which versions of the COVID-19 viruses are causing the most new infections.</p>
<p>However, those specimens represent just a small fraction of what’s out there. More than 2.2 million cases were reported in the last week in the U.S. The CDC has been revising estimates for past weeks as it gets more data.</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — In San Francisco, the average seven-day number of new reported infections has climbed steeply to 829, which is more than double that of last winter’s peak of 373 cases a day.</p>
<p>ANKARA, Turkey — The number of confirmed daily COVID-19 cases in Turkey has exceeded 50,000 for the first time since mid-April, according to Health Ministry data.</p>
<p>The ministry reported 54,724 new infections on Tuesday, compared to 44,869 the previous day. It also reported 137 new deaths.</p>
<p>Turkey is urging people to continue to wear masks and to practice social distancing, but is so far not considering introducing restrictions.</p>
<p>Around 83% of the adult population has received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines and 20 million people have received a booster shot. More than 82,000 people have died of the virus.</p>
<p>PARIS — France reported a record-smashing 271,686 daily virus cases Tuesday as omicron infections race across the country, burdening hospital staff and threatening to disrupt transport, schools and other services.</p>
<p>The French government is straining to avoid a new economically damaging lockdown, and is instead trying to rush a vaccine pass bill through parliament in hopes that it is enough to protect hospitals.</p>
<p>Britain reported a record 218,274 daily cases Tuesday; Germany reported 30,561.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people are hospitalized with the virus in France, a number that has been rising steadily for weeks but not as sharply as the infection rates.</p>
<p>COVID-19 patients fill more than 72% of France’s ICU beds, and a once-renowned health care system is again showing signs of strain. Most virus patients in ICUs are not vaccinated, though 77% of the population has had at least two doses.</p>
<p>ATLANTA — U.S. government data published Tuesday says COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy doesn’t increase chances for premature births or small newborns. </p>
<p>The findings echo previous studies and are in a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on 46,000 pregnant women, including 10,000 who received at least one vaccine dose while pregnant. </p>
<p>Premature birth rates — about 7 per 100 births — were comparable in both groups, as were rates for small babies, 8 per 100 births. </p>
<p>The data, from December 2020 through late July, suggest there’s no increased risk for women vaccinated early in pregnancy although the authors note that most women included got shots during the second and third trimesters.</p>
