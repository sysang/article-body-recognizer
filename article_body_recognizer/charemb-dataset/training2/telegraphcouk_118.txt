<h2> Forget 'Jewface', Golda Meir deserves to be portrayed by the best actor available </h2>
<p> Far more important than whether the actor is Jewish or not is whether they are going to respect the memory of the person they are portraying </p>

<p> Benedict Cumberbatch has called on men to "fix their behaviour", but this kind of preaching is just counterproductive </p>

<p> Anti-vaxx passport protestors have been wearing the stars across Europe, but almost no outrage has actually risen above the surface </p>

<p> In his new Radio 4 show, psychologist Steven Pinker argues that we can and should improve our thinking by weaning ourselves off gut feelings </p>
<h2> <a> Inside the ‘university of dangerous ideas’ </a> </h2>
<p> As the world’s first ‘anti-woke’ university in Texas is announced, its founders explain how they hope to defend against campus illiberalism </p>
<h2> Hypocritical eco-zealots should concentrate on solutions, not moral point-scoring </h2>
<p> From the Greta Thunbergs of the world to Extinction Rebellion, all modern ‘activists’ want to do is virtue-signal and berate humanity </p>
<h2> <a> Women getting sterilised to save the planet is an omen of totalitarianism </a> </h2>
<p> As climate anxiety and woke politics take hold, young people are turning against human life altogether </p>

<p> The BBC’s Ridley Road is fascinating but gives the wrong idea – we’ve never been down the dark path taken by some European counterparts </p>
<h2> <a> Ayaan Hirsi Ali: ‘Britain should take the lead of the English-speaking world’ </a> </h2>
<p> The author and activist says that, with America in moral confusion, Boris Johnson can become the new leader of the world order </p>
<h2> <a> Climate change hypocrites should look to their own lives first and ditch the private jets before telling me what to do </a> </h2>
<p> For the preachy celebs in private jets and the protesters blocking our roads, it's much easier telling us what to do than leading by example </p>
<h2> The sacking of white members of the English Touring Opera shows how woke will destroy the arts </h2>
<p> I for one would never go to watch an orchestra just because it had been lauded for diversity </p>
<h2> <a> Immigration needn't be such a mess – Denmark's work-for-benefits model could be win-win for all </a> </h2>
<p> Instead of leaving migrants stranded in useless limbo, the Danish proposals encourage those who have chosen to move there to earn their keep </p>
<h2> <a> From the BBC to corporate Britain, the woke industrial complex has gone too far </a> </h2>
<p> Many are getting rich off the back of the toxic spread of woke ideology throughout our institutions and workplaces </p>

<h1> Elizabeth Selby, co-founder with her husband Frank of the Rex Features photo agency – obituary </h1>
<p> Born in Berlin, she came to England with her family in 1934, survived the Blitz and founded Rex with the help of her father's photo archive </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:15am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Elizabeth Selby, who has died aged 96, was the co-founder, with her husband Frank, of Rex Features, one of Fleet Street’s longest running independent press photo agencies.</p>
<p>She was born Erzsébet “Boezsi” Guttmann in Berlin on April 1 1925 to Heinrich (Henry) and Adele Guttmann, both from Hungarian-Czech families of Jewish ancestry.</p>
<p>It was a hand-to-mouth existence in rented accommodation but they had Henry’s photo archive, by now approaching 250,000 images.</p>
<p>The bedrock of their collection was a new archive which Henry Guttmann had built up, which he generously donated to his daughter and her husband.</p>
<p>The key to Rex Features’s expanding business was its reputation as a company that always kept its word on price and exclusivity both with editors and with photographers looking to promote their wares.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Selby’s husband predeceased her in 2018. She is survived by their two sons and a daughter.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Selby, born April 1 1925, died November 14 2021</p>

<h1> Chris Wilkinson, architect with a passion for technology who created breathtaking buildings that were sensitive to their context – obituary </h1>
<p> Wilkinson Eyre Architects won the Stirling Prize twice, for the Magna Millennium Project, Rotherham, and the Gateshead Millennium Bridge </p>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Obituaries <time> 21 December 2021 • 2:50pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Chris Wilkinson, the architect, who has died aged 76, brought a grace and elegance to Modernism born of a combination of artistic flair and an ability to use the latest technology to stretch the frontiers of innovative design.</p>
<p>He broke the bounds of the modernist box to introduce sinuous curves and breathtaking spans.</p>
<p>Having taken a summer off in Greece to reflect on his future, he returned as heavily bearded as a Greek fisherman, determined to work with Norman Foster and Richard Rogers. </p>
<p>Everywhere, Wilkinson made an impression as a thoughtful young architect, quiet but full of charm and optimism, with the good looks of a Nicolas Cage, a talent for freehand sketching and a burning interest in new technology.</p>
<p>It was evident that he wanted to set up his own practice, which he did as Chris Wilkinson Architects in 1983, taking space in the offices of Troughton McAslan. He was working again for Hopkins when he met Jim Eyre. </p>
<p>They soon formed a practice which as Wilkinson Eyre became one of the great partnerships in modern British architecture, a pairing of equal and complementary talents. </p>
<p>Further designs for Dyson included shops abroad and later work at Hullavington airfield. The introduction to Dyson came via the inventive structural engineer Tony Hunt.</p>
<div> <div> <p>This talent grew with Wilkinson’s interest in steel technology. He had spent time in the US, which excited his interest in long-span structures and resulted in his pioneering book on Supersheds (1991). </p> </div> </div>
<p>Wilkinson’s election to the Royal Academy in 2006 further encouraged him to find inspiration through his painting and drawing – an example was the Maggie’s cancer caring centre in Oxford, a high-tech version of a tree house.</p>
<p>Often he was sketching buildings and places, but he also used drawing as a means of furthering ideas formed in discussions with colleagues in the office.</p>
<p>This creative tact was seen in his design for the museum for housing the miraculously preserved hull of the Mary Rose in Portsmouth Naval Dockyard and the collections rescued with it. </p>
<p>Stalemate had been reached when the trustees sought to move the hull of Henry VIII’s flagship away from HMS Victory to a site nearer the entrance, destroying a Second World War boat house which has subsequently been restored. </p>
<p>Wilkinson’s solution for the Mary Rose Museum was part James Bond space-ship, clad in plain black-stained wood, playing up the playing up the exuberance of the nearby Victory.</p>
<p>Around the base is a beautiful free form, but structurally sophisticated, Carrara marble veil designed by Wilkinson.</p>
<p>His last building will be the art gallery he has designed for James Dyson at his magnificent Georgian house at Dodington Park in Gloucestershire.</p>
<p>Wilkinson was appointed OBE in 2000 and the practice’s many accolades included more than 50 RIBA awards and 10 Structural Steel awards. Wilkinson Eyre Architects now has offices in London, Hong Kong and Sydney.</p>
<p>His ideas are contained in his book Bridging Art and Science (2001), written with Eyre, and over the last year he was writing a new book on architecture and the developments in IT that have transformed ways and speed of working.</p>
<p>He married, in 1976, Diana Edmunds, who survives him with a son and a daughter.</p>
<p>Chris Wilkinson, born July 1 1945, died December 14 2021</p>

<p>The unvaccinated look at those who made the effort, see no new freedoms, and wonder why they should bother. All stick and no carrot never works.</p>
<p>Eric GibbonsDunfermline, Fife</p>
<p>SIR – I have Covid. I got the news at 7am on Sunday after taking a PCR test at a drive-through centre on Saturday. It was my third test last week.</p>
<p>I first PCR tested last Tuesday with my daughter when she felt unwell. She was positive, I was negative. I tested again first thing on Thursday. Again I was negative, as was my elder daughter, but my husband was positive.</p>
<p>So testing for travellers should be on Day 5, with isolation before it.</p>
<p>Ros WalkerDunblane, Perthshire</p>

<p>With no other means of heating, we were cold. How we missed our wood stove, which kept our last house warm, heated our water and boiled our kettle.</p>
<p>We tried to buy a gas heater but were told that they can be dangerous, giving off poisonous carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>In the end we went to bed with our dog and cat to keep warm. This is obviously not the answer.</p>
<p>Diana SharpChirnside, Berwickshire</p>
<p>SIR – The Prime Minister’s Brexit rhetoric about taking back control of our borders has come back to haunt him and the country. He knew that from January 1 2021 the EU’s Dublin Regulation no longer applied.</p>
<p>With no return arrangement with any EU country, it is not surprising that only five migrants have been returned this year.</p>

<p>SIR – Michael Nicholson<a> (Letters, November 25)</a> refers to the AA’s guidance from the 1950s on how to pass a lighted cigarette.</p>
<p>I have a car maintenance manual from the same period advising the do-it-yourself motor mechanic to dispose of used engine oil “in a quiet corner of the garden, about one spit deep”. Times do, occasionally, change for the better.</p>
<h2>A decorative lavatory that made an impression</h2>
<p>SIR – My great-grandmother was the daughter of George Jennings, the engineer who devised and installed the first public lavatories in the 1850s <a>(Letters, November 19)</a>.</p>
<p>I do not know if it was a George Jennings, but it was impressive.</p>
<p>Althea RichardsonGodmanchester, Huntingdonshire</p>
<p>SIR – I was sad to read that the public lavatories on Epsom Downs will be demolished <a>(Letters, November 25)</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe sponsorship is the answer. It seems a poor contribution to local life when a roundabout or similar is sponsored, but a public lavatory, sponsored by a local business or private individual, would provide a valued public service.</p>

<h2>GPs’ receptionists judging medical problems</h2>
<p>SIR – I phoned for a face-to-face GP appointment<a> (Letters, November 29) </a>for a suspected kidney infection.</p>
<p>After an embarrassing conversation, the receptionist said that a “medical professional” would ring me on a date in 23 days’ time. I found a different GP practice that took me on later that day.</p>
<p>Receptionists are not medically trained. How long before one causes a death?</p>
<p>Carol WhiteNorthwold, Norfolk</p>
<p>SIR – My wife is a GP practice manager of over 15 years’ experience and her practice uses the triage system to ask for information about why someone is seeking an appointment.</p>
<p>This isn’t done out of nosiness, but so that the correct clinical resource is given to the call. They use systems which, like calls to 999, ensure that the resource provided matches the patient’s need.</p>

<h1> Immigration needn't be such a mess – Denmark's work-for-benefits model could be win-win for all </h1>
<p> Instead of leaving migrants stranded in useless limbo, the Danish proposals encourage those who have chosen to move there to earn their keep </p>

<p>The policy would abolish benefits for migrants who have been in Denmark for more than three years, cannot prove that they speak basic Danish and don’t have a full-time job, and see money cut for recent unemployed graduates.</p>
