<h3><a>Maxwell made bad joke about having COVID-19 before testing positive as Stars crisis deepens</a></h3>
<p>Twenty20 superstar Glenn Maxwell has become the latest Melbourne Stars player to test positive to COVID-19 just hours after being caught on TV joking about having the virus.</p>
<div>Khawaja and Lyon poised for BBL returns ahead of blockbuster final round</div>
<p>Test stars Usman Khawaja and Nathan Lyon are available to play for the Sydney Thunder and Sydney Sixers on Wednesday in the final round of regular-season BBL matches, along with a handful of other Australian representatives.</p>
<p>Fresh off Ashes glory, Khawaja said he was planning to feature for the Thunder in their last match before finals, against the Melbourne Renegades at the MCG starting at 4.10pm (AEDT).</p>
<p>Khawaja was set to captain the Thunder this season before earning a call-up to the Test side. Chris Green and Jason Sangha have stepped up in his absence but will be thrilled to see the left-hander back in action heading into the finals.</p>
<p>After being overlooked for the first three Tests, Khawaja blasted twin centuries at the SCG, becoming the third player in history to do at the famous ground after Doug Walters and Ricky Ponting.</p>
<p>“I have wanted to play for Australia as much as possible over the last two years,” Khawaja said. “Obviously not playing for Australia didn’t change anything at all. I’m enjoying the cricket.”</p>
<p>Wednesday’s matches are important for the two Sydney franchises ahead of the BBL finals, which begin on Friday, and so too for Sixers skipper Moises Henriques, who brings up 100 BBL games.</p>
<p>The Sixers play the Brisbane Heat on Wednesday at the Gabba at 1.05pm (AEDT). They sit second on the ladder, despite having the same number of competition points as the third-ranked Thunder, due to a superior net run rate.</p>
<p>There is added incentive to finish second overall, given the top two ranked sides will square off in a “qualifier” match on Saturday. The winner will automatically advance to the final.</p>
<p>Lyon, who finished the Ashes series with 16 wickets at 23.56, has been named in the Sixers squad. It has been nearly two years since he last represented the Sixers.</p>
<p>A decision will be made on Wednesday regarding Lyon’s availability.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure if he’s going to make himself available to play straight away or whether he’s going to have a few days off,” Henriques said.</p>
<p>Marnus Labuschagne is likely to play for the Heat against the Sixers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Scott Boland will line up for the Hobart Hurricanes in their match against the Melbourne Stars on Wednesday (7.50pm AEDT).</p>
<p>Returning Test players Alex Carey and Travis Head are also set to play in the Adelaide Strikers’ final on Friday.</p>
<p>Henriques said he was proud to have chalked up 100 BBL games for the same team.</p>

<div>‘Not good enough’: Arsenal knocked out of FA Cup by Nottingham Forest</div>
<p>Third-round exits in the FA Cup don’t come along very often for Arsenal. Unless, that is, Nottingham Forest are their opponents.</p>
<p>It’s only the second time in 26 seasons that Arsenal have fallen at the first hurdle. Forest were responsible for the other occasion, too, in 2018.</p>
<p>“We were not good enough,” Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta said, “and we have to apologise for it.”</p>
<p>Tottenham and Liverpool avoided the same fate as Arsenal, launching comebacks after falling behind at home to third-tier opponents. Tottenham beat Morecambe 3-1 and Liverpool won 4-1 against Shrewsbury.</p>
<p>By conceding an 83rd-minute goal to substitute Lewis Grabban at the City Ground, Arsenal became the highest-ranked casualty of this season’s FA Cup.</p>
<p>So inept was Arsenal’s display that Arteta’s team failed to have a shot on target against Forest, the former European champions who have fallen on hard times since the turn of the century and are ninth in the Championship.</p>
<p>Arsenal wore an all-white strip for the match, instead of the usual red, in a stand against knife crime.</p>
<p>The FA Cup has served up some surprises at the third-round stage, no bigger than Newcastle losing at home to third-tier Cambridge United on Saturday.</p>
<p>A little bit of luck – or maybe it was pinpoint precision – proved crucial in Tottenham’s turnaround against Morecambe.</p>
<p>With his team trailing 1-0 after 73 minutes, Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks sent in a free kick from near the corner flag on the left wing and the ball flew over everyone and into the top corner.</p>
<p>“This one I meant,” Winks said, laughing.</p>
<p>Substitutes Lucas Moura and Harry Kane added further goals in the final five minutes for Spurs, who denied Morecambe a place in the fourth round for the first time in their 101-year history.</p>
<p>Liverpool started their comeback against Shrewsbury much earlier, equalising seven minutes after going behind in the 27th.</p>
<p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was back in the dugout after spending time in isolation following a positive test for the coronavirus, which came amid an outbreak at the club that led to the training ground getting closed for two days.</p>
<p>“This was the team we could line up today and the boys did really well,” Klopp said of his makeshift team.</p>
<p>Bowen added a second in the stoppage time as Leeds made a third-round exit for the ninth time in the last 12 seasons.</p>
<p>Premier League teams Wolverhampton and Norwich also advanced after beating lower-league teams Sheffield United (3-0) and Charlton (1-0), respectively.</p>
<p>Many of the bigger teams have used the third round to give game time to their fringe squad members, but two players in particular didn’t take advantage of their opportunity.</p>
<p>Ndombele, Spurs’ record signing, walked straight down the tunnel instead of watching his team’s fightback.</p>
<div><p>“I was a player and it happened sometimes to me that someone was unhappy with my performance,” said Tottenham manager Antonio Conte in an attempt to play down the incident.</p><p>AP</p></div>
<div>‘Enough’s enough’: Police to investigate Cavallo death threats</div>
<p>Adelaide United have asked South Australia Police to investigate disturbing and specific death threats levelled via social media at Josh Cavallo, who the club says has been the target of global vitriol since his decision to come out as gay.</p>
<p>A club spokesperson confirmed to the Herald and The Age that it had spoken to police about investigating some of the death threats Cavallo had received via social media.</p>
<p>“He got messages on social media saying, ‘Yep, we heard the comments. It was disgusting,’” Kosmina said.</p>
<p>The APL and the operators of AAMI Park are now combing through CCTV footage to identify those responsible.</p>
<p>“There’s more cameras at our games than there ever have been before and the security infrastructure at AAMI Park is probably the best in the country,” Kosmina said.</p>
<p>“It’s something we’ll work with stadiums, both home and away now - we’ll need to address [it] with clubs interstate, to keep an eye out on this and how we monitor it.</p>
<h3>Fringe Socceroo reportedly set to join Postecoglou at Celtic</h3>
<p>Ange Postecoglou is reportedly closing in on his first Australian signing since taking on the job as Celtic manager, with the Scottish Premiership club poised to land fringe Socceroo Riley McGree.</p>
<p>Capped seven times for Australia, McGree also represented his nation at the Tokyo Olympics and was given his first senior call-up by Postecoglou almost five years ago.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old midfielder has been playing for English Championship outfit Birmingham City since October 2020 on loan from Charlotte FC, a new Major League Soccer team which will begin its inaugural season next month.</p>
<p>McGree impressed towards the back end of his loan stint but while Birmingham were unable to sign him on a permanent deal, there are other clubs keen to ensure he stays in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Middlesbrough were said to be one of the main teams in contention, but it now appears that Celtic are the odds-on favourites to land McGree for a transfer fee of around $4 million.</p>
<p>An attack-minded midfielder capable of playing as a No.10, 8 or 6, McGree would join Postecoglou and Tom Rogic as part of a growing Aussie continent at Celtic.</p>
<p>This move would continue McGree’s second foray into European football, following an ill-fated move to Belgian outfit Club Brugge in 2017.</p>

<div>‘Never seen anything like it’: Chaos as referee blows final whistle twice before full-time at Cup of Nations</div>
<p>A referee has sparked controversy at the Africa Cup of Nations after he twice blew the final whistle before the 90 minutes were completed in a match between Tunisia and Mali.</p>
<p>The game descended into chaos when Janny Sikazwe prematurely called time on two occasions before later failing in an attempt to restart play more than 20 minutes after players had left the pitch.</p>
<p>The Zambian official, once suspended as part of a corruption investigation, initially blew for the end of the game with only 85 minutes on the clock, before correcting himself.</p>
<p>He then brought the game to an end in the 90th minute despite a series of stoppages in the second half, including a controversial VAR review and a drinks break.</p>
<p>With Mali leading 1-0, the Tunisia bench reacted furiously when the final whistle sounded. Many of the coaches ran onto the pitch to confront the referee, pointing angrily at their watches and demanding stoppage time be played.</p>
<p>Television footage showed 89 minutes and 45 seconds on the clock when the full-time whistle was definitively blown. Sikazwe, who refereed at the World Cup in Russia in 2018, had to be escorted from the pitch by a team of security guards.</p>
<p>Tournament organisers are reported to have ordered the teams to re-enter the pitch and play the match to a conclusion, more than 20 minutes later, but Mali were declared the winners after Tunisia did not return to the field.</p>
<p>“The players were taking ice baths for 35 minutes before they were called back out again,” Tunisia coach Mondher Kebaier said.</p>
<p>“I’ve been coaching for a long time and have never seen anything like it. Even the fourth official was preparing to lift the board [to show the number of minutes of added time] and then the whistle was blown.”</p>
<p>Mali manager Mohamed Magassouba was in the middle of his post-match press conference when he was told his players needed to return to the pitch to play the remaining three minutes of additional time.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘The players were taking ice baths for 35 minutes before they were called back out again.’</p><cite>Tunisia coach Mondher Kebaier</cite></blockquote>
<p>“Unfortunately the opposition team did not want to come back out and the final whistle was blown,” he said.</p>
<p>Even before the controversy at the end, the match was packed with incident.</p>
<p>Mali took the lead when Ibrahima Kone scored from the penalty spot after Boubacar Kiki Kouyate’s shot had struck the hand of Tunisia midfielder Ellyes Skhiri.</p>
<p>Tunisia’s Wahbi Khazri then missed with a penalty of his own before Mali were reduced to 10 men when Sikazwe showed a harsh red card to El Bilal Toure for a late challenge.</p>
<p>Sikazwe was asked to check the pitchside monitor following a VAR review, but stuck with his decision. Tunisia are understood to have filed a complaint with the Confederation of African Football following the match.</p>
<div>Aubameyang diagnosed with ‘cardiac lesions’ after leaving COVID isolation</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>Gabon and Arsenal forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been diagnosed with heart lesions at the African Cup of Nations in Cameroon after contracting COVID-19, the Gabon Football Federation said on Friday.</p>
<p>It ruled Aubameyang out of Friday’s game against Ghana and put the rest of his African Cup in doubt.</p>
<p>Two other Gabon players were also prevented from playing after similar medical checks following their return from positive tests.</p>
<p>Aubameyang tested positive for the virus at an airport on arrival in Cameroon last week and was put into isolation. He also missed Gabon’s first game, a 1-0 win over Comoros.</p>
<p>The Gabon captain has since tested negative for the virus and was out of isolation for two days before the Ghana game and was expected to return to the team.</p>
<p>The news regarding Aubameyang and his teammates came on the same day it was announced that Bayern Munich defender Alphonso Davies has been sidelined with evidence of heart muscle inflammation after he contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Gabon coach Patrice Neveu also tested positive on Wednesday but returned a negative test later ahead of the Group C game and was allowed to take his place on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Gabon scored an 88th-minute equaliser to draw with Ghana 1-1 and give itself a chance of qualifying for the knockout stages.</p>
<div>FA support for Cavallo after calling out homophobic abuse during game</div>
<p>Football Australia chief James Johnson has applauded Josh Cavallo’s courage and issued Melbourne Victory with a show cause notice after the Adelaide United defender said he was the target of homophobic abuse during an A-League Men game.</p>
<p>FA is working with the Australian Professional Leagues and Victory to identify the fans involved in the incident during last Saturday’s match at AAMI Park, which could lead to bans from games throughout Australia.</p>
<p>Cavallo, 22, became the first active top-flight male professional footballer in the world to come out as gay in October. Victory have until 5pm on Tuesday to respond to the FA notice.</p>
<p>Both clubs condemned the events from Saturday’s match, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Cavallo played 36 minutes as a substitute but came off during injury time due to a suspected concussion.</p>
<p>South Australia Police are also investigating the incident.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to pretend that I didn’t see or hear the homophobic abuse at the game last night. There are no words to tell you how disappointed I was,” Cavallo wrote.</p>
<p>Melbourne Victory said in a statement it strongly condemned the behaviour.</p>
<p>Beau Busch and Kate Gill, the joint chief executives of Professional Footballers Australia, said Cavallo’s abusers had “illustrated their cowardice”.</p>
<p>“There is no place in our game, our society, for those who seek to direct abhorrent abuse at others,” they said in a statement.</p>
<div>Manchester City charge toward successful title defence</div>
<p>Manchester, England: Runaway Premier League leaders Manchester City took a step closer to a fourth title in five seasons with a 1-0 win over second-placed Chelsea on Saturday, opening up a 13-point lead over the London club at the top.</p>
<p>Philippe Coutinho enjoyed a dream debut for Aston Villa as he came off the bench to inspire a 2-2 comeback draw at home to Manchester United, scoring a late equaliser.</p>
<p>Rafa Benitez’s troubles at Everton continued as they suffered a 2-1 loss at Norwich City, who moved off the bottom of the table with their third win of the campaign.</p>
<p>Newcastle United conceded a late equaliser in a 1-1 draw at home to Watford, missing the chance to escape the drop zone.</p>
<p>City’s 12th win in a row, thanks to a 70th minute solo strike from Kevin De Bruyne, continues their charge towards a successful defence of their title but manager Pep Guardiola was quick to dismiss such talk.</p>
<p>Third-placed Liverpool are 14 points behind City but have two games in hand, including Sunday’s visit of Brentford.</p>
<p>“[The players] are going to listen to me that it is not true when people say it is over. In January, it is impossible it is over,” Guardiola said.</p>
<p>“If Liverpool win the games in hand, it’s eight points. Now my job is to put in the brains of my players to not believe what the people say. But 12 wins - 36 points from 36 - hats off to them,” the Spaniard added.</p>
<p>After a first half which saw few clear chances, other than Jack Grealish being foiled by Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, Chelsea had an opportunity to take the lead after the break but Romelu Lukaku’s shot was well saved by Ederson.</p>
<p>City were well in control of the game for large spells and took the points after De Bruyne burst away from N’golo Kante and beat Kepa with a superb shot into the far corner.</p>
<p>Chelsea boss Thomas Tuchel was critical about the performance of his attack, in particular Lukaku, who recently had to apologise for an interview with Italian media in which he said he was unhappy with the German coach’s system.</p>
<p>“He had many ball losses without any pressure, many ball losses in very promising circumstances,” Tuchel told reporters.</p>
<p>“He had a huge chance. We want to serve him, but he is part of the team, and the performance up front, particularly in the first half, we can do much, much better.”</p>
<p>“It feels more like a defeat,” the German said as his side remained in seventh place.</p>
<p>Norwich threw themselves a lifeline in their battle against relegation but sucked Everton into the mire thanks to a victory at Carrow Road that heaped pressure on Benitez.</p>
<p>An own goal by Michael Keane and Adam Idah’s close-range finish in the space of two first half minutes broke Norwich’s goal famine that had spanned six league games.</p>
<p>Richarlison halved the deficit on the hour to set up a tense finale, but Norwich hung on, with Everton’s travelling fans venting their anger at Benitez.</p>
<p>Norwich moved up to 18th place with 13 points, six behind 15th-placed Everton who have lost nine of their last 12 league games but have two matches in hand on the Canaries.</p>
<p>Newcastle United had hoped the addition of 25 million pound ($34.18 million) New Zealand striker Chris Wood, signed from relegation rivals Burnley in midweek, would boost their survival chances, but they had to settle for a point at home to Watford.</p>
<p>Allan Saint-Maximin put the hosts in front four minutes after the break with a brilliant solo effort but Watford’s Joao Pedro popped up to head home brilliantly in the 88th minute.</p>
<p>Newcastle are in 19th on 12 points, one ahead of bottom club Burnley, who have three games in hand of United after their fixture at home to Leicester City was postponed due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We’ve damaged ourselves to a point, but you always have an opportunity to bounce back,” Newcastle boss Eddie Howe said.</p>
<p>Eighth-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers continued their good form with a 3-1 home win over Southampton thanks to goals from Raul Jimenez, Conor Coady and Adama Traore.</p>
<div>Wins for Liverpool and Leeds as Everton fire Benitez after just 200 days in charge</div>
<p>Rafa Benitez was fired by Everton after just 200 days in charge on Sunday with a brutal 40-word statement that offered no thanks to the manager whose appointment was always contentious with fans.</p>
<p>The Spaniard never overcame his successful association with Liverpool, whose stadium is less than two kilometres from Goodison Park, and his position became increasingly untenable as Everton sunk closer to the relegation zone.</p>
<p>A 2-1 loss to Norwich on Saturday left Everton six points above the relegation zone with only one win in the league since September.</p>
<p>The fear has become about the danger of relegation rather than trying to qualify for Europe for the first time since 2017.</p>
<p>While Liverpool has won the Champions League (2019) and Premier League (2020) since then, Everton is without a trophy since the 1995 FA Cup and hasn’t won the English championship since 1987.</p>
<h3>Liverpool rub salt in Everton wound</h3>
<p>Benitez’s name was chanted by Liverpool fans at Anfield within minutes of the announcement during their match against Brentford.</p>
<p>They not only fondly remember his 2004-10 reign, which included the Champions League title in 2005, but also his part in the decline of such a fierce, local rival.</p>
<p>There were also other reasons for Liverpool fans to celebrate on Sunday after their team climbed to second in the Premier League after goals from Fabinho, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Takumi Minamino earned them a 3-0 win over Brentford.</p>
<p>The win moved Juergen Klopp’s side above Chelsea in the table and 11 points behind leaders Manchester City with a game in hand. City beat Chelsea 1-0 on Saturday.</p>
<p>The London side continued to prove resilient opponents, staying in the contest until the 69th minute when Oxlade-Chamberlain stooped at the back post to head in a wonderful cross from Andy Robertson.</p>
<p>Substitute Minamino wrapped up the win, tapping home after Brentford’s attempt to play out from the back was intercepted by Roberto Firmino who set up the Japanese forward for a simple finish.</p>
<h3>Leeds too good for West Ham</h3>
<p>In east London, West Ham United squandered a chance to cement fourth spot on the ladder as they lost 3-2 at home to Leeds, with Jack Harrison scoring a hat-trick for the visitors.</p>
<p>After three successive wins, West Ham had the chance to open up a five-point gap between themselves and fifth-placed Arsenal, whose game at Tottenham Hotspur was postponed.</p>
<p>But Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds, missing seven players through injury or suspension, had other ideas.</p>
<p>Harrison opened the scoring after 10 minutes with a curled finish, but Jarrod Bowen equalised with a header in the 34th minute – his fourth goal in his last three games.</p>
<p>Harrison touched in after good work by Luke Ayling three minutes later to give Leeds the halftime lead.</p>
<p>When Pablo Fornals levelled again with a precise finish seven minutes after the break it seemed West Ham would go and win but Leeds responded in magnificent fashion.</p>
<p>Harrison’s deft finish after dazzling play by Raphinha restored their lead and Raphinha rattled the woodwork with a superb free kick before Leeds had an effort by Mateusz Klich ruled out for a harsh offside.</p>
<p>The win lifted Leeds to 15th, nine points above the relegation zone.</p>
<div>Michael Hurley ‘making inroads’ but won’t be ready for round one</div>
<p>Forgotten Bomber Michael Hurley is progressing in his recovery from a hip infection, but Essendon captain Dyson Heppell says the key defender won’t be ready for his side’s round one meeting with Geelong.</p>
<p>Hurley, 31, missed all of the 2021 season after being struck down with a hip infection last February, which doctors believe originated from a blister in his foot.</p>
<p>But Heppell said he was looking forward to seeing Hurley back on the training track in due course.</p>
<p>“He’s progressing well actually,” Heppell said.</p>
<p>“Particularly over the last six weeks he’s made some great inroads.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure when he’ll be back out on the track, but it’s great to see him knocking about.”</p>
<p>But Heppell said Hurley wouldn’t be ready for his club’s season-opener.</p>
<p>“[That’s] probably a bit too soon in the way he’s progressing,” he said.</p>
<p>“There’s no real time frame on it, honestly. He’s not putting any cap on himself, on when he can return, but it will come in due course.”</p>
<p>The Bombers trained at the NEC Hanger in Tullamarine on Monday but were short on staff and players, with up to 20 in isolation due to COVID-19 protocols.</p>
<p>Heppell said it was something all clubs would have to adapt and get used to as the season goes.</p>
<p>“Yeah we had a few missing today. [It’s] great to be back in action, but we were a bit thin on numbers,” he said. “Hopefully we get all of them back on deck later this week and early next week.</p>
<p>Heppell said he was having his best run at pre-season in a long time, and the disappointment of being knocked out in the opening week of finals would drive his team in 2022.</p>
<p>Asked whether it was the best his body has felt in four or five years, Heppell replied: “No doubt, that’s a fair shout, probably six [years].”</p>
<p>“She’s been a while since I’ve been cracking in pre-Christmas, and I’ve had a nice break and been able to train properly, so it’s nice to be back out there,” he said.</p>
<p>“Barring COVID, we’ve got the majority of the list healthy and training properly, so it’s good.</p>
<p>“I’m feeling good and hopefully it will stay that way.”</p>
<p>Heppell added that Ben Hobbs, Essendon’s first pick in last year’s draft, was announcing himself as a “ready-made” player.</p>
<p>“He lived with me for a couple of weeks - he’s horrible on the dishes and I had to show him where the dishwasher was a couple of times, but he’ll get better at that,” Heppell quipped.</p>
<p>“But I reckon we’ll see plenty of footy from him this year.</p>
<p>“He’ll bring a bit of grunt on the inside, but I think he’s got the footy smarts as well.”</p>

<p>The football world is mourning the death of former Fremantle and Melbourne player Harley Balic.</p>
<p>Balic, who turned 25 last Wednesday, died on the weekend. Victoria Police confirmed in a statement it will prepare a report for the coroner. There were no suspicious circumstances.</p>
<p>He returned to Victoria after being traded to Melbourne at the end of 2017, but he failed to play a senior game before announcing his retirement in August 2018. He played 11 games with the Demons’ VFL affiliate Casey.</p>
<p>Melbourne CEO Gary Pert offered the club’s condolences to Balic’s family and friends.</p>
<p>“On behalf of the Melbourne Football Club, I would like to express my deepest sympathies to Harley’s family at this difficult time,” he said.</p>
<p>“Our thoughts are with those closest to Harley, his teammates, and the extended Melbourne family.”</p>
<p>Balic spoke openly about his battles with mental health and anxiety during his career.</p>

<div>Football giant returns to the AFL: Hird joins GWS in leadership role</div>
<p>James Hird has returned to AFL football, taking up a leadership role at Greater Western Sydney alongside assistant coach and former Essendon teammate Mark McVeigh.</p>
<p>The Giants announced on Tuesday night that the Australian Football Hall of Famer would make his football return “in a new role” with the club.</p>
<p>Hird said he was looking forward to stepping back into the AFL industry as a part-time leadership consultant with the league’s newest club.</p>
<p>“Mark McVeigh then asked if I would come and speak to the group about playing football in Melbourne, my experiences in the AFL, and impart some of my life journey. For younger players it’s good to hear, but also for senior players.</p>
<p>“Getting to know Leon [Giants coach Leon Cameron], I’ve had a huge amount of respect for him over a very long period of time, so getting the chance to work with him was something I was really looking forward to.</p>
<p>“It’s a part-time role, and very much around the leadership group but also around the emerging leaders and sharing my experiences in football and trying to get them to lead and encourage and work hard on that side of things.”</p>
<p>Hird spoke to the GWS playing group during their time in the Melbourne last year after they relocated from NSW due to a COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Hird, a Brownlow medallist, Norm Smith medallist, and five-time All-Australian resigned as Essendon coach in 2015 after his role in the supplements saga and hasn’t held a coaching position with an AFL club since.</p>
<p>He played 253 games with the Bombers, winning two flags – including one as skipper. He was named at No. 3 in the ‘Champions of Essendon’ list behind Dick Reynolds and John Coleman.</p>

<div>Geelong to play Carlton on Saturday night in AFLW fixture switch</div>
<p>The AFL has reshuffled the round-two fixture with the Western Bulldogs and the Brisbane Lions unable to field teams due to the number of players isolating, as they adhered to the league’s COVID-19 health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>Geelong were scheduled to play the Western Bulldogs, while the Blues were meant to play the Lions in Maroochydore in round two, but the league has switched their match-ups.</p>
<p>It means Geelong will play Carlton and the Western Bulldogs will play the Lions on a date yet to be determined, with the league saying the game will be played “as soon as it is safe and practical to do so”.</p>
<p>Geelong’s head of AFLW, Brett Johnson, said the Cats were rapt to be able to host Carlton at GMHBA Stadium on Saturday night.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to hosting Carlton here and it’s a good opportunity for our members to come and support the team,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>“With COVID, it’s obviously living in another COVID-impacted season which is fine and we just have to be agile to adjust.”</p>
<p>Carlton’s head of AFLW, Brett Munro said, the Blues’ preparation would not be significantly impacted as they look to bounce back from a disappointing loss to Collingwood in round one.</p>
<p>The clash will see Carlton’s AFLW star Madison Prespakis play against her sister, Geelong’s Georgie Prespakis, for the first time.</p>
<p>Madison has won the league’s MVP while Georgie earned a rising star nomination in her first match after an impressive performance against North Melbourne in the season opener. Both teams lost in round one.</p>
<p>Head of competition management Laura Kane said players and staff knew they would have to adapt.</p>
<p>“We will continue to monitor the situation and will work closely with both clubs on a revised fixture and, together with the AFLPA, support all players impacted,” Kane said.</p>
<p>“We remain committed to delivering a full season in a safe manner anchored in the advice of respective governments and public health officials.”</p>
<div>Rebuilding Magpies lose homesick Irish defender</div>
<p>Collingwood defender Mark Keane has chosen to remain in Ireland rather than return to play out the final year of his contract, having battled homesickness in recent years.</p>
<p>The players were informed of his decision on Friday morning with Keane telling the club he wanted to be closer to family.</p>
<p>Football manager Graham Wright said it became obvious in the new year Keane and the club needed to decide on his future.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, Mark has suffered from homesickness his entire time at Collingwood. He went home early in August prior to the season finishing and returned after training had started in November,” Wright said.</p>
<p>“Mark didn’t return for training in the new year and we decided, along with Mark, that the rigours of AFL football combined with being away from home are too much for him at this time.”</p>
<p>As a category-B rookie, Collingwood will not be able to replace Keane on the list via the pre-season supplementary selection process.</p>
<p>Keane played in hurling for his local team Ballygiblin on the weekend with Collingwood’s blessing as they advanced to the All-Ireland semi-final against Fullen Gaels.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old indicated after that game he was open to playing in that match in Ireland despite the Magpies still anticipating he would return to training. Keane and the club subsequently arrived at a mutual decision he should remain in Ireland.</p>
<p>Keane played five games with the Magpies as a defender after making his debut against Fremantle in round nine, 2020 but struggled to cement a place in the team as the competition had an interrupted two years due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Reports from Ireland indicate Keane will play with Cork County in hurling in 2022.</p>
<p>Collingwood’s most successful Irish recruit was Marty Clarke who played 73 games in two stints at the Magpies with Kevin Dyas, Caolon Mooney, Paul Cribbin and Anton Tohill also having been on the Magpies’ list before Keane.</p>
<p>The Magpies are embarking on a partial rebuild after finishing 17th in 2021, recruiting a bunch of young players including father-son midfielder Nick Daicos under new coach Craig McRae who replaced Nathan Buckley.</p>

<div>Millimetres from paralysis, an Irish Giant is embracing her second chance</div>
<p>Stack’s debut season with the GWS Giants was over before it began. In a practice match last January against the Adelaide Crows, the 35-year-old collided with Ebony Marinoff and came off second-best.</p>
<p>The game was abandoned. Marinoff was initially found guilty of forceful front-on contact and suspended for three weeks - the longest ban in AFLW history.</p>
<p>In a column for the Irish Examiner at the time, she wrote she was “beside herself with anger” and felt like she had been made a “scapegoat”. It still doesn’t sit well with her.</p>
<p>And then there’s coach Alan McConnell, the heart and soul of the Giants’ AFLW program who had spent years practically begging her to try her hand at footy.</p>
<p>As for the Crows, Stack and the Giants were due to play them - and Marinoff - in pre-season, until COVID intervened. The AFLW draw has the two sides facing off in round seven at Blacktown.</p>

<div><div><h5>By Peter Ryan and Sarah Burt</h5><div>Updated <span><time>January 16, 2022 — 6.28pm</time></span><span>first published <time>January 14, 2022 — 9.29pm</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>A week after kicking four majors in the season-opener, Woodland was again dominant with four more in Adelaide’s 5.7 (37) to 3.6 (24) triumph.</p>
<p>The teams did not play each other last season and North Melbourne had never travelled to South Australia in their four seasons. After strong wins from both sides last week it looked to be anyone’s game.</p>
<p>Adelaide’s side remained unchanged but the Kangaroos had five changes, headlined by skipper Emma Kearney, who missed last week with the AFL’s health and safety protocols.</p>
<p> Woodland started where she left off and slotted an opportunistic first goal of the day. Two-time premiership player Anne Hatchard looked dangerous for the Crows from the start, notching nine disposals in the first term.</p>
<p>North Melbourne dominated uncontested possessions and disposals but couldn’t manage to score.</p>
<p>Woodland remained the star of the show, a set shot giving the Crows their second, Stevie-Lee Thompson following closely behind with a mark in front of goal to put them 17 points ahead while the Roos still sought to get on the board.</p>
<p>Adelaide were 12 points up at the main break, while Ash Riddell held up the midfield for the Kangaroos in the first half with 15 disposals at the main break.</p>
<p> Hatchard dominated for the Crows, with seven disposals in the first six minutes of the third term, while Woodland edged her leading goalkicker tally ahead, slotting her third for the day and seventh in seven quarters.</p>
<p>Ellie Gavalas snapped the Kangaroos’ second from a crowded inside 50 and Kearney hit 20 touches and eight marks but they remained behind by 11 points at the final break.</p>
<p>All-Australian Jasmine Garner was the beneficiary of a smooth passage of play to give the Kangaroos their third but immediately after, Danielle Ponter unselfishly handed Woodland her fourth for the day and sealed the win.</p>
<p> Randall said: “North Melbourne are such an excellent, elite side and to get four points in front of our home crowd in Norwood is amazing. I couldn’t be more proud of our girls.”</p>
<p>ADELAIDE 1.1 3.3 4.4 5.7 (37)NORTH MELBOURNE 0.2 1.3 2.5 3.6 (24)</p>
<h3>Carlton hold sway over Geelong in hard-fought Prespakis Cup</h3>
<p>It was not the game’s only mini-battle, with opposing coaches Carlton’s Daniel Harford and Geelong’s Dan Lowther, long-time friends, having played in a Herald Sun Shield win while schoolmates at Parade College in 1994.</p>
<p>Carlton’s ability to find space opened up an opportunity for Elise O’Dea to kick the Blues’ first goal in their first inside 50 despite Geelong dominating territory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Cats, who were without key player Nina Morrison due to COVID protocols, bombed the ball forward too often rather than holding it so numbers inside 50 could even up.</p>
<p>In the end it was only another piece of ill-discipline from Carlton that gave exciting Irishwoman Rachel Kearns the chance to kick her first goal when she was the beneficiary of a 50-metre penalty.</p>
<p>Kearns attacks the football with ferocity, but she also showed how quickly she was adapting with an accurate set shot.</p>
<p>Her attack on the ball has people watching and this time it was her teammate Georgie Prespakis who copped an injury when her head connected with Kearns’ hip as she tried to tackle her sister.</p>
<p>Despite goals being hard to find Carlton’s ability to move the ball cleanly more often than Geelong, who fought hard and marked well, was the difference with two goals coming directly from tough interceptions from O’Dea.</p>
<p>On the first occasion she scooped the ball into space, with the umpire overlooking the move to get the ball to the classy Nicola Stevens who converted.</p>
<p>Geelong have improved under Lowther’s tutelage, while Carlton did what they needed to do after a disappointing 2021.</p>
<h3>One-sided affair: Collingwood prove too sharp for Saints</h3>
<p>Collingwood’s AFLW premiership credentials were on full display at Victoria Park on Saturday, in a 27-point dismantling of St Kilda to keep their clean record this season intact.</p>
<p>But a suspected concussion to Pies’ tall Erica Fowler and a knock to the ribs to debutant Imogen Barnett in the final quarter put a sour note on a game that had well and truly been sealed by then.</p>
<p>The more experienced Magpies averaged 10 more games per player compared to their counterparts, and that experience was evident in the one-sided affair, particularly across half-back as they repetitively picked off intercept marks.</p>
<p>The Magpies were untouchable in the opening term, preventing the Saints from entering their forward 50 for the entire quarter.</p>
<p>From their nine entries, the Pies slotted 3.3, led by Bonnici and Lambert’s work through the midfield.</p>
<p>But the hard-fought Saints managed to snare the final two goals of the game to end the contest on a positive note.</p>
<p>The Saints, whose coach Nick Dal Santo watched from home in isolation, remain winless through two rounds and face an undefeated Melbourne next weekend.- Damien Ractliffe</p>
<h3>Demons spoil Richmond’s first AFLW outing at Punt Rd</h3>
<p>Melbourne have defeated Richmond by 16 points in a hot contest at the Swinburne Centre under the Friday night lights.</p>
<p>Both teams keen to keep up momentum from round one wins, it was a physical contest seeing neither team leaving with anything left in the tank.</p>
<p>Richmond set the tone early, Olympic basketballer Tessa Lavey booting her first AFLW goal moments after the first bounce, reigning all-Australian centre half forward Katie Brennan following up with a set shot major.</p>
<p>Richmond’s pressure dictated play, 17 tackles to 10 in the first term while star midfielder Monique Conti continued momentum from last week’s clinical performance, with three handballs and seven disposals.</p>
<p>Big name recruit Tayla Harris got the Demons on the board before the siren, cutting the margin to seven points the margin at quarter time.</p>
<p>Melbourne turned the tables after the first break, All-Australian Demon Kate Hore tied the scores, then slotted a second to edge them ahead.</p>
<p>At that stage it was six clearances to one, Melbourne managing to protect the ball in their forward 50, seeing two goals in a row from Alyssa Bannan.</p>
<p>Demons skipper Daisy Pearce earnt a free kick and gave them their sixth major in a row, five time All-Australian Karen Paxman’s had a slower game last week but had notched 16 disposals and eight handballs by halftime.</p>
<p>Then, at the main break, the clearances were nine to three and a similar difference with inside 50’s saw the Demons ahead by 26 point.</p>
<p>The ladies in yellow and black saw Brennan feed Tessa Lavey her second for the night, Sarah Dargan got them back within 16-points but not before experienced Demons Pearce and Karen Paxman bit back.</p>
<p>A spectacular goal soaring off the boot of Mon Conti gave the Tigers a flicker of hope in the final term butDemon Harris wouldn’t have it, soccering one through.</p>
<p>Brennan snapped a goal with four minutes to go but they couldn’t beat the clock, Melbourne showing why they remain the premiership favourites.</p>

<div>A self-proclaimed real-life ‘Hannah Montana’: Inside the double life of a Collingwood AFLW star</div>
<p>Sarah Rowe is a self-proclaimed real-life ‘Hannah Montana.’</p>
<p>The 26-year-old lives six months a year in two worlds so vastly different they barely intersect.</p>
<p>During Ireland’s summer, she’s a star forward for Mayo in the Ladies Gaelic Football Association, driving three hours to training before returning to Dublin three times a week.</p>
<p>In Australia’s summer, she wears No.7 for Collingwood’s AFLW side and is one of the best runners in the competition.</p>
<p>Most years that keeps her busy, but this time she decided to throw in some training for the Irish soccer team between seasons, just for good measure.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to get caught being the jack of all trades but the master of none,” Rowe said.</p>
<p>It would be easy for Rowe to get carried away with her multiple sporting accolades, but she’s as down to earth as they come.</p>
<p>“I need to focus on where I am and what I’m doing at the time, so as soon as I land in Australia it’s like, ‘Right, how can we be better and what do we need to do’,” she said.</p>
<p>Rowe made the move to Melbourne in 2019, making her debut in Round 1 and was awarded the Magpies’ best first-year player.</p>
<p>She’s been splitting her year between hemispheres since, admitting that when first approached to try AFL, she thought the email was spam.</p>
<p>“I’d just played in the all-Ireland finals and got an email from someone over here and he said, ‘I think you’d be really suited to Aussie Rules, would you come to Australia to meet with the teams?’” Rowe said.</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘What is this, fraud or what’.”</p>
<p>Explaining that her philosophy in life is to take a risk and seize opportunities, she agreed to fly to a country she’d never been to, to meet with professional clubs from a sport she’d never played.</p>
<p>“To come in and not be good at a sport was difficult because you’re used to being good at the sport you’ve grown up playing, so that in itself was character-building.”</p>
<blockquote><p>‘To come in and not be good at a sport was difficult because you’re used to being good at the sport you’ve grown up playing, so that in itself was character-building.’</p><cite>Sarah Rowe</cite></blockquote>
<p>Her energy is infectious, and with the quintessential charismatic Irish humour, she admits she’s the joker of the team.</p>
<p>“Unless you have a proper conversation with me, you won’t realise how seriously I take things, how deeply I take things in or how often I reflect on myself. I journal every night, I reflect on myself all the time,” Rowe said.</p>
<p>This is evident as she discusses her avid interest in the human brain and her ensuing studies in neurolinguistics and hypnotherapy.</p>
<p>“For me, psychology has always been a huge part of Sport, it’s all about the subconscious mind and the voices in our head,” she said.</p>
<p>“I’ve always wanted to have a way to rationalise my thoughts and feelings and then deal with them and move past them. There’s so many highs and lows in sport and you need to try and keep yourself as steady as possible.”</p>
<p>Rowe reflected positively on the past two years shrouded by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“COVID has actually been good for some athletes because it’s had to challenge our inflexibility,” she said.</p>
<p>“Ah, god, do you know how much I got teased for that at the club? I thought it’d slip under the radar because it was in Ireland” Rowe said with a laugh.</p>
<p>“It was absolutely hilarious, I talk to my parents like they’re my best friends so they weren’t shocked at anything in the show. We did not take it seriously at all, if anything it made us all want me to find love less.”</p>
<p>Despite her seemingly carefree manner, Rowe admits living between two worlds has its challenges for relationships, both romantic and otherwise.</p>
<p>“I did do a long-distance relationship for two years and it was unfortunately the start of the end, unless someone was going to make a compromise, and you just can’t ask someone to live in two places a year,” she said.</p>
<p>It’s a lot to grapple with and Rowe conceded “the older I get, the less tolerant I am of the lifestyle.”</p>
<p>“I know when I’m older I’ll reflect and know it was the best time of my life. I just appreciate being here so much,” she said.</p>
<p>“So, for now, I think I need to keep going until it doesn’t feel right anymore.”</p>

<div>‘Could surpass 200 players’: COVID surges throughout AFL clubs during summer break</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>While AFL sources acknowledged that the number of men’s players who had the virus in recent weeks exceeded 100, a survey of several clubs indicates that the number is likely far higher and could surpass 200 players.</p>
<p>But the numbers of those isolating at those clubs is reducing quickly, with the Magpies having 12 isolated on Tuesday as players recovered or finished their mandatory seven-day isolation.</p>
<p>Port Adelaide has had about 10 players with the virus, some of whom contracted it while returning home to Victoria. But the Power will have nearly 40 players back at training next week and have not been as hard hit as the Victorian clubs overall.</p>

<div>‘That’s what 2022 is going to be about’: Clubs prepare to dive deep into playing lists</div>
<p>Former league operations boss Steve Hocking has warned AFL clubs will need their entire playing lists to be on standby this season as they plot how best to navigate the Omicron variant. </p>
<p>Hocking, now Geelong’s chief executive, presided over five changes to the Cats’ AFLW side ahead of last Saturday’s rescheduled clash against Carlton because of the league’s health-and-safety protocols.</p>
<p>He said the men’s program, with the league’s official community series beginning on March 3 and the season proper on March 16, could also face losing players to health and safety issues as late as hours before matches.</p>
<p>“I think the reality is that is going to be the case,” Hocking said on Monday.</p>
<p>“Certainly, what we are working through with AFLW, we will have a lot of learnings from that, and I am sure most of the clubs across the comp are following that and trying to understand it as well.”</p>
<p>Superstar Cats forward Tom Hawkins last week said he had been struck down by COVID-19, while skipper Joel Selwood said recruit Jon Ceglar, the former Hawks ruckman, had spent time in health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>While the past two men’s seasons have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, Selwood said his team could learn from how the women’s program had adjusted this summer to the new variant.</p>
<p>“He has been going really well, to be honest. I don’t like to single out at this time of the year, but he hasn’t missed a session,” Selwood said.</p>
<p>Hocking said coach Chris Scott was “very close” to inking a long-awaited two-year contract extension, likely to be announced before the start of the new season.</p>
<p>Hocking said Scott had abolished employing line coaches, with his assistants, including new additions Harry Taylor, James Kelly and Eddie Betts, to work with the overall group.</p>
<p>“It’s something that Chris has been leading on. Harry Taylor started last week, Eddie Betts will start this week. It’s really good to have those different voices around the club,” he said.</p>
<p>The Cats also confirmed Irish recruit Oisin Mullin has opted not to join the club, preferring to remain at home and continue with Gaelic side Mayo. Mullin had been due to join as a category B rookie.</p>
