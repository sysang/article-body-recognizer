<p>No. And I’m glad she didn’t, although she might have raised the comedy game (<a>Samantha’s way with triple entendres</a> and withering one liners is sorely missed).</p>
<p>Instead, they do what women in real life do; they bitch about her. </p>
<p>“You know Samantha: her pride got damaged,” says Miranda philosophically.</p>
<p>“That’s why I kept leaving messages and voicemails asking her to get back in touch so we could fix it …” Carrie trails off. “I always thought the four of us would be friends forever.”</p>
<p>There. Stop right there. Let she who has never endured the utter heartbreak of being dumped by a girlfriend admit that she’s “more of a man’s woman, actually” and leave the pity party.</p>
<p>Forget Carrie’s career woes, Charlotte’s intimations of mortality and single mother Miranda’s gauche attempt at reinvention; in midlife it is female friendships that fascinate.</p>
<p>So of course Carrie and co feel bereaved. A loss is a loss. All the more so after 50, when your social circle is established, you have history together and have endured and enjoyed both the rough and the smooth.</p>
<p>In my 40s I fell out with a friend. It had always been a complicated, slightly competitive relationship, but we shared a sense of humour, a keen sense of the absurd.</p>
<p>But after our children attended different schools, we grew slightly apart. I felt she should have made more effort to stay in touch. I suspect she felt the exact opposite.</p>
<p>Hurt crystalised into self-protection before hardening into something a great deal more unyielding. Neither of us knew how to rescue the situation, the friendship. Pride prevented us from even trying.</p>
<a>When female friendship crumbles there’s no one you can tell about your grief</a>; no woman friend wants to hear you sing the long lost virtues of another woman.
<p>I ended up in therapy. No word of a lie. I thought the therapist would think I was weird and needy. It turns out there’s nothing weird about needing. She understood – it’s an age and stage thing.</p>
<p>So I understand the snarky ambivalence towards Samantha in And Just Like That.</p>
<p>The story is she’s gone off to London, where “sexy sirens in their Sixties are still viable”. Ouch. I’m not sure where art ends and life begins; Cattrall is a decade older than the others.</p>
<p>Either way the bitterness rings true. Margaret Atwood writes sagely of friendship in her 1988 novel Cat’s Eye, the narrator reflecting on her complicated connection to what we would now term a frenemy.</p>
<p>“This is what I miss, Cordelia: not something that’s gone, but something that will never happen. Two old women giggling over their tea.”</p>
<p>Or, in the case of Carrie Bradshaw, cosmopolitans. That’s the thing about enduring female friendship; it may be rooted in the past but it promises a future.</p>

<h1> I’ll sing to anyone who calls me for the Christmas Charity phone-in (you might have to pay me to stop!) </h1>
<p> This Sunday, December 12, myself and other Telegraph journalists will be waiting to take your donations and to wish you a Merry Christmas </p>
<div> <div> By Judith Woods <time> 10 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Ho ho home is where the heart is and where charity starts as well, especially at this time of year. Away from the political fray and new Covid measures, Christmas is coming.</p>
<p>And with it, The Daily Telegraph Charity Appeal phone-in, that day when you, dear readers, unfailingly demonstrate your care for others far less fortunate, and make the midwinter less bleak for those in need.</p>
<p>On Sunday, journalists like me will be manning and indeed womanning the lines to take your generous donations. We will be full of cheer, at least two metres of mini mince pies apart and delighted to pause and chat with every last one of you.</p>
<p>This year’s charities have been chosen not just because they desperately need support, but because we believe they will strike a real chord.</p>
<p>But this has also led to a shocking rise in puppies discarded through no fault of their own, who are looking for forever homes.</p>
<header> <h1> How a December circuit-breaker holiday can help you face the festive frenzy </h1> <p> Take a short step back from the seasonal mayhem to regain your Yuletide mojo – a old-school spa retreat can work wonders </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Judith Woods <time> 11 December 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Frankly we all go a bit crackers. Except this year, I’ve had a revelation. Ladies, we can’t stop the world, but we can get off. I’m doing that now, in fact.</p>
<p>Allow me to introduce the concept of a personal Christmas circuit breaker. You may be wondering: is that “a thing”? It is now.</p>
<p>“I feel like I’ve been hit by a really nice truck,” a fellow guest muses, gloriously spaced out by the clean eating, the fresh air and the early nights. “One carrying fresh figs or posh scented candles, maybe.”</p>
<p>“Remember to make time for you,” says my therapist, Cassie, gravely, as I leave. My jawline is leading-lady taut, my features supporting-actress serene. “You matter as well, you know.”</p>
<p>Well, knock me down with a sprig of mistletoe. This is my It’s a Wonderful Life epiphany. Certainly it reaffirms (see what I mean?) the decision to take a short step back from the seasonal mayhem and regain my Yuletide mojo.</p>
<p>Beautifully presented platescapes of virtuous vegan food eaten at communal tables are a major highlight. Unlike a great many other spas, singletons are more than nominally welcome at the Glass House; they feel genuinely at home. I certainly do.</p>
<p>Then, in the hushed calm of the lounge I find myself engaging with the quieter personalities; the conversations about health matters, family crises and life journeys are both deeply intimate and therapeutic.</p>
<p>On the feedback form, guests are asked to name the favourite aspect of their stay. A high proportion cite “the amazing like-minded people I met”. It’s no exaggeration.</p>
<p>My three new chums are hardcore: up at dawn to watch the sunrise followed by the morning hike, weight training, sports massages, aqua aerobics, boxing and a daily dip in the outside swimming pond, followed by a Finnish sauna.</p>
<p>They thoroughly recommend the cryotherapy, so I decide to give it a go, having only the sketchiest idea of what it involves apart from low temperatures that are supposed to heal muscular injuries, promote weight loss and improve overall wellness.</p>
<p>“You have to choose a song to dance to,” says Hazel, a remorselessly energetic luxury-car saleswoman who could talk Max Verstappen into a Skoda Octavia, “so you don’t die.”</p>
<p>She goes for Katrina and the Waves’ Walking on Sunshine. The standard is Eye of the Tiger. I decide on Let It Go from Frozen because I think it will be funny to sing “the cold never bothered me anyway”. Big mistake. Huge.</p>
<p>As I drive away, Hazel is striding off for her daily cryotherapy session. In a week, she will be invincible. After two days, I feel renewed, refreshed, and my passion for Christmas has been well and truly reignited.</p>
<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Why I refuse to go into pre-Christmas hibernation </h1> <p> Martial law couldn’t be more effective than the fear and loathing stalking the land right now, but I intend to make merry regardless </p> </div> </div>

<p>The voice on the other end of the phone falls silent. Awkward. I check my friend is still on the line. Oh yes she is, bristling with unspoken indignation.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe you asked me that,” she says finally. “I’m really shocked you’re so blasé.”</p>
<p>Shocked? That will teach me to suggest a threesome. No, not in bed. In the pub.</p>
<p>My exact words: “Fancy coming to the pub quiz? I reckon it will be almost empty so we can clean up, even though we know nothing about football.”</p>
<p>Wow. I’m not sure exactly when I became a social pariah but last Tuesday when the introduction of Plan B was announced (remember that?) sounds about right. Thanks, Boris. For this and so much more.</p>
<p>Here we are 11 days before Christmas and Britain is closing itself down. Just in case. To be on the safe side. Discretion is the better part of valour.</p>
<p>Martial law couldn’t be more effective than the fear and loathing stalking the land.</p>
<p><a>Omicron may be the ultimate spectre</a>. I meanwhile have morphed into the ultimate vector. Why? Because I don’t want to stay at home for the next 11 days. I can think of nothing sadder.</p>
<p>For the record; I am by no means blasé. I am double vaccinated. I have had my booster. I wear a mask. I wash my hands – two verses of Let it Snow, Let it Snow sets the mood perfectly.</p>
<p>I am, by a country mile, a model pandemic citizen. But that’s not good enough any more; the letter of the law is just a starting point now among the risk-averse vigilantes policing us. Yes, I do mean you, my darling husband.</p>
<p>A good friend is holding a posh afternoon tea (no crusts, Champagne, viola flowers atop the fancies) at a beautiful boutique hotel next weekend. It’s a milestone birthday; yet one by one her guests are dropping out. Talk about a milestone.</p>
<p>Again, I can hear the reproach echoing in my ears. Again, I would aver that I am punctiliously following every rule and sticking to every guideline. What more should I do? No! Don’t answer that.</p>
<p>Right, I’m off; to see the lights, to visit the shops, to go and watch <a>West Side Story</a> in the cinema and generally feel festive. It’s not a crime. And until it is I won’t be bullied into submission.</p>
<p>So what if that means a table for one, a ticket for one and a party of one? Admittedly I might struggle with a threesome but me, myself and I will be doing our very damndest to make merry this Christmas.</p>
<div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Parents are fighting a losing battle in the war on porn </h1> <p> This is nothing like the dog-eared magazines of yesteryear and if we don’t stem the tide our young people will suffer terrible consequences </p> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Judith Woods <time> 16 December 2021 • 7:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>I’m not sure at what age squeamishness about sex kicks in but I reckon the po-facery starts round about the point you stop laughing uproariously the moment the lights go up on Live at the Apollo.</p>
<p>Instead, you find yourself feeling irritated by stand-ups’ preoccupation – obsession! – with masturbation. Dating stories are always amusing. But must they go on quite so much about (whisper it) vaginas?</p>
<p>It’s not shocking. It’s far worse than that; juvenile and boring. Never before has switching over to Newsnight felt so much like gratefully crossing the Rubicon.</p>
<p>But not every day. Week. Fortnight. (Fill in as applicable). So how in the name of Debbie Does Dallas are we expected to talk to our children about porn before we hand over their first smartphone?</p>
<p>The Children’s Commissioner Rachel de Souza has urged parents to address online porn with their children as early as the age of eight. Eight! I know? You first.</p>
<p>A panel of young people told her that pornography shouldn’t be treated as a “taboo subject”. Instead parents should calmly explain why watching adult content can be harmful.</p>
<a>the Grammy-winning singer Billie Eilish has spoken of the recurring nightmares she suffered after watching abusive porn</a> and how it impacted on issues of consent during her first sexual experiences.
<p>“I think porn is a disgrace. I used to watch a lot of porn, to be honest. I started watching porn when I was, like, 11,” the 19-year-old said, saying it helped her feel as if she were “cool”.</p>
<p>“I think it really destroyed my brain and I feel incredibly devastated that I was exposed to so much,” she added.</p>
<p>“The first few times I had sex, I was not saying ‘no’ to things that were not good. It was because I thought that’s what I was supposed to be attracted to.”</p>
<p>This isn’t porn as my generation knew it, comprising dog-eared magazines passed around behind the bike sheds.</p>
<p>No, this is 2021 online porn. Terrifying. Dominant. Violent. There is choking and spitting and angry misogyny. Women are spatchcocked, degraded, used. And all freely available – and most saliently, free – at a few keystrokes on a phone.</p>
<p>Parents can cluck and fuss but most kids first come across porn by accident. And once those images are seared on their blameless retinas there’s no turning back.</p>
<p>But children don’t believe a word their parents say. What do we know? That was sex in the olden days. Old sex. Ewww!</p>
<a>Online Safety Bill</a> is currently being scrutinised by Parliament.
<p>If we don’t stem the tide of aggression and exploitation our young people will suffer terrible consequences. In the toxic world of extreme online porn there is no happy ending.</p>

<p>In 2005, Archers addicts may remember, the community staged Calendar Girls, in which the lady cast members gamely stripped for a saucy photo shoot in the Radio Times. In other years we’ve had Sleeping Beauty, Aladdin and Blithe Spirit.</p>
<p>Incidentally, after a ropey start of clunky lockdown monologues and awkward socially distanced two-handers, The Archers is now one of the few places on the planet, along with North Korea and Tuvalu, where there is officially no pandemic. </p>
<a>All Creatures Great and Small</a>.
<p>And Ambridge, for all its Sturm und Drang – Tom and his bossy Missus invading Bridge Farm, the poignant death of Bert Fry, the eldritch spectre of Hazel Woolley – offers a vision of our nation as we would wish it to be.</p>
<p>And for all the opening night jitters, fluffed lines and extravagant ad-libbing the Christmas show is always deemed a huge success and receives a glowing review from Tristram Hawkshaw, the Borsetshire Echo’s answer to Pauline Kael.</p>

<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Britain's energy crisis is only going to get worse </h1> <p> Ministers' net zero obsession risks plunging millions into fuel poverty </p> </div> </div> </header>

<p>The correct response would be to take the foot off the pedal as Britain hurtles towards net zero and the decarbonising of the economy, at the same time as finding ways to smooth the transition. But this hapless Government looks set to do neither.</p>
<a>without great costs to consumers</a>. Without other energy sources to count on, accelerating the switch towards renewables will surely only exacerbate the current squeeze.
<a>changes to the energy price cap</a>, customers are facing even steeper jumps when it moves again next April.
<p>Currently around half the UK’s gas is imported but experts warn that unless we improve the energy mix, Britain will be forced to obtain three-quarters of its needs from abroad over the coming years.</p>
<p>Our storage is woefully poor too. Having prematurely allowed the Rough gas storage facility to shut down in 2017, Britain has just seven or eight days worth of supply it can count on compared with 80 to 90 days in the Netherlands and Germany.</p>
<p>But Britain has all-but ended coal production. There is no chance of anyone reviving the Rough site. We’ve failed to develop carbon capture. Nuclear is too expensive, the technology old, and the public doesn’t want it.</p>
<p>Fracking has been banned, and the regulator has just refused permission for Shell to explore the Jackdaw field in the North Sea, which is estimated to hold somewhere gas resources equivalent to between 120m and 250m barrels.</p>
<p>That leaves us desperately exposed to the markets and mainly Russia. Moscow remains the primary supplier of gas to Europe, delivering 43pc of the continent’s supplies.</p>
<a>Vladimir Putin’s vague promise to turn on the taps</a>, it is doubtful that even Russia with all its natural resources can actually live up to it. Production is already at record levels, experts warn.
<p>Far from a passing blip, the current energy crunch is a terrifying glimpse of what life is going to be like for the next 15 years as Britain is left blowing in the wind.</p>
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Time to end the big Black Friday con trick </h1> <p> The retail 'event' born in America is a monster spiraling out of control that is doing more damage the longer it continues </p> </div> </div> </header>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Ben Marlow <div>Chief City Commentator</div> <time> 24 November 2021 • 2:28pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<a>Christmas</a> kicks off in the most Christian of ways: a punch-up with a stranger in Argos, or if you want to really go for it, a full-scale riot in an Asda car park. 
<a> that you didn’t need anyway</a> would almost certainly have cost less at any other point in the year.
<p>Here’s a snapshot. A Zanussi washing machine on sale in <a>John Lewis</a> for £309. Yet, it was cheaper on 136 other days, including £249 five months before Black Friday and £289 less than a month afterwards.</p>
<p>A Yamaha wireless music speaker available in Richer Sounds that was going for £150 but hadn’t been sold at the recommended £199 retail price since 2018. And a smart TV from AO.com that was £200 cheaper less than a month later.</p>
<p>It’s a giant marketing con. Yet that doesn’t stop millions of otherwise perfectly rational people from falling for it. And every year, the extravaganza seems to get bigger and bigger, and last for longer.</p>
<a>Currys</a>, have begun offering deals much earlier in the month, presumably in a bid to beat the opposition to the punch.
<p>What is most tragic of all is that many retailers despise it. The former boss of <a>fashion</a> chain Jigsaw, Peter Ruis, once branded Black Friday as "a complete and utter deception”. </p>
<p>Ex-Fat Face chief Anthony Thompson loathed it too. “<a>Bad for customers, bad for business, and bad for UK retail</a>” was his colourful description, accusing it of ruining the high street and hurting local traders. </p>
<p>For years, giants like Next and Ikea shunned it out of principle and basic commercial logic. The main gripe is usually that genuine deals trash margins. </p>
<p>Marks Spencer boss Steve Rowe complains that it means stores have fewer customers over the Christmas period because many now do their festive shopping during that one hectic window.</p>
<p>Yet many chains feel compelled to join in. Perhaps some will be tempted this time around out of sheer desperation. </p>
<p>But surely that’s precisely the reason to avoid it. The last thing Covid-trashed retailers need is to pile further pressure on strained suppliers for demand to suddenly collapse again days later. </p>
<p>Still, look on the bright side: Morrisons is doing half-price full English breakfasts, because nothing says “Seasons Greetings” like being rushed to AE after a cholesterol-induced heart attack. </p>
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> The energy price cap was a catastrophic Tory error </h1> <p> The price cap has massacred the energy market to such an extent it risks creating an oligopoly if nothing is done </p> </div> </div> </header>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Ben Marlow <div>Chief City Commentator</div> <time> 25 November 2021 • 4:17pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>If you thought the energy price cap was confusing, spare a thought for John Penrose.</p>
<p>Still, in a crowded field, the price cap must rank as one of the worst government policies ever, and it wasn’t even this Cabinet that introduced it. </p>
<p>Its latest fixation is the creation of a new independent football regulator, as if anyone really believes that would save the national game.</p>
<p>Whatever the problem, state interference in markets is rarely the answer as many were quick to warn when the price cap was being debated. But the Government, under the hapless direction of Theresa May, panicked. </p>
<p>Desperate to appeal to working-class voters and see off the perceived threat of a Jeremy Corbyn-led opposition, ministers stole a flagship Labour policy that Boris Johnson himself dismissed as meddling jiggery-pokery and claimed it as their own.</p>
<p>Government and the regulator Ofgem are sticking doggedly to the mantra that the price cap has helped to keep costs down for millions of households, which is true but only up to a point. </p>
<p><a>It has been raised twice in the space of a year anyway</a>, and is set for its sharpest rise yet in April, possibly adding another £500 to bills in one fell swoop. </p>
<p>The bailout bill risks wiping out any savings anyway. In forcing better-capitalised companies to take on the customers of those that have gone bust, bills have to go up eventually, so it’s totally self-defeating. </p>
<p>The industry estimates the total cost so far to be in the region of £4bn to £5bn. In the meantime, the direct cost to the taxpayer of propping up Bulb alone is expected to be a staggering £1.7bn.</p>
<p>Mansfield-based Entice Energy and London supplier Orbit Energy both went under on Thursday, bringing the total number of failures since the summer to almost 30.</p>
<p>It’s clear the status quo cannot be maintained. The ultimate aim in encouraging a slew of start-ups was to dilute the dominance of the Big Six, which had been accused of profiteering. </p>
<p><a>But the price cap risks reducing competition</a> to such an extent that the market goes full circle back to the oligopoly of old. What a spectacular own-goal that would be even by this Government’s risible standards. </p>
<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Super-Covid variant spooks markets – but ministers must hold their nerve </h1> <p> The UK is in a stronger position than Europe, but our recovery will not withstand another lockdown </p> </div> </div>

<p>Welcome to Black Friday, or as traders immediately dubbed it: “Red Friday”. </p>
<a>torn through global markets</a>, painting Bloomberg screens in every investment bank and broking house red as stocks, oil prices, and currencies tumbled amid fears that the fragile recovery could be torpedoed.
<p>The FTSE sank 3pc in early trading, its worst one-day percentage drop since September 2020. Just three blue-chip stocks were in positive territory: Ocado, Reckitt Benckiser and Royal Mail. </p>
<a>whether interest rates would be held next month</a>. The markets are now pricing in a 60pc chance of no rise from the Bank of England.
<a>consumer confidence plunged</a>. 
<p>With restrictions being tightened in the continent’s largest economy, there are fears that growth could stagnate before the end of the year or even contract, in what would be a baptism of fire for Chancellor-elect Olaf Scholz.</p>
<p>Of particular reassurance is how fast the UK and Europe have responded. A travel <a>ban on flights coming from the five countries in southern Africa</a> is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>The mind still boggles at how the Government allowed international travellers and tourists to pour through airports at the height of the pandemic. It buys time and helps to slow the spread while scientists gain a better understanding.</p>
<p>But ministers must resist the urge to go further, locking down the borders and worse, forcing us back into lockdown. That should be avoided at all costs. </p>
<p>We should take great comfort from the experience that has been gained from dealing with the delta variant, the vaccine effort more generally, and the pipeline of new Covid medicines that the world's scientists are working day and night to produce.</p>
<p>The <a>speedy vaccination rollout</a>, which has been mirrored by the rapid delivery of booster jabs for the most vulnerable, has propelled the country to a state of relative normality. </p>
<p>As Professor James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: “It is bad news but not doomsday.” </p>
<p>The time is for cool heads and calm, not knee-jerk panic and a return to the hated draconian measures that crippled the economy once before. </p>

<p>The company squandered an estimated €20bn trying to go toe-to-toe with the powerful industrialist in India, only to warn last year that its India venture was staring bankruptcy in the face.</p>
<p>Though Ambani's Reliance Industries was <a>quick to issue a firm denial of takeover interest in BT</a>, following a report in India’s Economic Times, the shares remained 6pc higher than where they had opened.</p>
<a>to full-fibre broadband by 2026</a>. The bill for the vast building programme is expected to total £15bn.
<p>And if the UK’s army of highly paid fund managers isn’t willing to invest in this country’s future infrastructure then perhaps we can't complain if an overseas buyer steps in.</p>
<a>at a new generation of challenger networks</a> it was believed might break the stranglehold of BT’s infrastructure arm Openreach.
<p>Over the past decade billions of pounds of pension fund, sovereign wealth and private equity money has been poured into a rash of so-called “alt-nets” on crazy valuations.</p>
<p>The contrast between the view of short-term institutional shareholders and the heavyweights of the global telecoms industry is stark.</p>
<a>or that of Drahi’s Altice </a>with a 12.1pc stake – but it is telling that while the City gets cold feet, BT now has two major strategic investors willing to back its ambitious plans.
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Big energy must defeat the eco-warriors </h1> <p> Forcing companies to walk away from fossil fuels in the hopes that will drive the green transition is simplistic in the extreme </p> </div> </div> </header>

<p>It’s not just the firm’s innocuous name that will do little to enhance their latest ambitious campaign: a call for commodities powerhouse Glencore to get out of the coal-mining game.</p>
<p>That has been the unfortunate experience of Anglo American after the miner sought to quickly rid itself of high-polluting thermal coal projects in South Africa.</p>
<a>A plan to spin-off the mine into a new vehicle renamed Thungela Resources</a> soon backfired in embarrassing fashion. Just days after the demerger, the Anglo executive placed in charge announced that he was looking to boost production, not shrink it.
<p>Breaking up the old-fashioned energy giants or forcing them to divest fossil fuels is the activist’s playbook de rigueur. But it is simplistic in the extreme to think it will turbocharge the green transition.</p>
<a>that will power electric car production and renewable energy</a>. 
<p>It is the same argument that Ben van Beurden has given for refusing to bow to demands from Dan Loeb’s Third Point to split Shell’s oil exploration arm from its gas operations and fledgling renewables business.</p>
<p>Besides, it isn’t as clear cut as “a separation between carbonised and decarbonised assets”, as Bluebell puts it. As the World Bank points out, “a green technology future is materially intensive”.</p>
<p>To suddenly remove it from the energy mix would threaten economic growth and well-being.</p>
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> BP needs a big deal to become Britain’s wind power champion </h1> <p> Energy giant is poised to take advantage of activists’ appetite to break up smaller rivals </p> </div> </div> </header>

<p>In these uncertain times, the creation of 850 jobs at a major British company like FTSE 100 energy generator SSE is not to be sniffed at. </p>
<p>This is textbook stuff. <a>Activists are on the prowl</a>, looking for companies ripe for break-up. Old-fashioned energy companies struggling to transform themselves into the renewables powerhouses of tomorrow are big and slow-moving targets.</p>
<p>It’s not without merit. Analysts at Bernstein reckon SSE is worth 50pc more on a sum-of-the-parts valuation, equivalent to roughly £8bn on top of its stock market valuation.</p>
<p>This display of ambition in a sector primed for massive growth over the coming decades, was greeted by a share price fall of 5pc, as investors reacted to plans to rein in dividend payments to fund the step-up in investment.</p>
<p>So with Elliott going nowhere and the stock market giving an emphatic thumbs down to SSE’s proposed shake-up, a break-up is essentially still very much on the table. </p>
<a>walks the same tightrope</a> of trying to build a renewables business of real scale from scratch without starving investors of their cherished dividend payouts.
<p>For BP the attraction of such a deal is obvious. Its chief executive Bernard Looney is committed to building a “world-class wind business” but has so far spun more lines than turbines.</p>
<p>With Shell facing the same challenge of how to make the shift to clean energy without alienating shareholders, perhaps SSE will be able to generate a bidding war between two sides with deep pockets. </p>

<p>The death of retail tycoon W Galen Weston earlier this year at the age of 80 was a seminal moment in retail-land.</p>
<p>Weston’s passing also paved the way for one of the world’s most illustrious shopping destinations - the Selfridges department store on Oxford Street in central London - <a>to change hands for the first time in nearly two decades.</a></p>
<p>The deal is a welcome vote of confidence in old-fashioned physical retail at a time when great uncertainty hangs over the high street like the Grim Reaper’s scythe. </p>
<p>The <a>pandemic has prompted a wave of doomsday predictions</a> about how the boom in online shopping, together with depleted commuter numbers, will accelerate the death of thousands of traditional shops starved of footfall.</p>
<p>The takeover secures the future of an iconic British institution and is proof that there is still some life in bricks and mortar but it shouldn’t be misinterpreted as anything more than that. </p>
<p>It does not signal some dramatic and unexpected shock reversal in the fortunes of the high street, nor does it mean that conventional department stores are on the cusp of a remarkable renaissance.</p>
<p>Central is controlled by Thailand’s billionaire Chirathivat family, and has built up a collection of high-end stores around the world, including Italy’s Rinascente chain and Kaufhaus des Westens in Berlin.</p>
<p>Like its upmarket European equivalents, Selfridges attracts a certain clientele, usually with serious money to spend. Selfridges in London cannot be compared to John Lewis in Basingstoke or House of Fraser in Doncaster. </p>
<p>While Selfridges customers might spend £250 on a pair of jeans, other mere mortals are more likely to trawl through the endless racks in Marks Spencer for a bargain pair of slacks.</p>
<p>And Selfridges is rarely on the market. Even during a global pandemic it is expected to fetch about £4bn, testament also to the careful stewardship of its Canadian proprietors who restored what was a tired set-up to former glories. </p>
<p>Town planners need to wake up and think of creative ways to revitalise the places where so many of us live and stop them turning into permanent wastelands. </p>

<p>The £7.5bn merger of Boots with drug distribution giant Alliance Unichem in 2005 was supposed to herald a bold new chapter in the history of one of Britain’s best known retailers.</p>
<p>As the octogenarian Pessina, prepares to jettison Boots from his global pharmacy empire it is hard to argue that the chain has benefitted from surrendering its independence.</p>
<p>Under more nurturing ownership, the chain should have been able to become the online health, beauty, and logistics goliath that Moulding convinced his cheerleaders he was well on the way to building. </p>
<p>Other buyout firms may come knocking but the government may not look kindly on a provider of crucial pharmacy services ending up back in the hands of profit-driven, short-term investors if the Omicron variant triggers another surge in Covid cases.</p>

<h1> ‘Golden age’ for Wall Street raiders threatens Britain’s national interests </h1>
<p> US hedge funds’ interest in our biggest companies risks making it harder to finance major economic projects </p>

<p>As Britain’s self-professed “clean energy champion” it is reassuring that SSE is generating a lot of wind. If only it was all down to the storms battering Britain.</p>
<p>The Scottish energy supplier is the latest recipient of what amounts to little more than a blast of hot air from feared Wall Street activist investor Elliott Management, as it steps up a campaign to force SSE to break itself up.</p>
<p>The idea that their motives are aligned with the interests of other so-called stakeholders is plainly nonsense.</p>
<a>he successfully saw off activist Ed Bramson</a>, is to be warmly applauded.
<p>Let’s hope there is more resistance. Companies shouldn’t be allowed to rest on their laurels but it is disheartening to see short-term hedge funds driving change rather than institutional shareholders.</p>
<a>his “energy transition” strategy</a> for creating value is different to the quick-fix shake-up that Elliott envisages.
<p>SSE has unveiled a plan to ramp up capital expenditure across both divisions over the next five years, from £7.5bn to £12.5bn, including a 2.5-fold jump in renewables investment from £1.8bn to £5bn from day one.</p>
<p>By the end of the decade, the company expects to be in control of a quarter of the UK’s offshore wind farms, together with electricity grid networks in Scotland and England, and a collection of “low carbon” power plants.</p>
<p>Alvarez and Marsal says British companies are more undervalued compared to European rivals, which makes them more vulnerable. More than third of those they regard as being targets are UK-based.</p>
<p>You can find analysts such as Sanford Bernstein that support Elliott’s case that a listing of the renewables arm would unlock another £5bn of value.</p>
<p>On the other hand there are those such as Jefferies that have concluded there is “no deep valuation discount”.</p>
<p>Accusations of a “history of underperformance” don’t exactly stack up either – SSE’s share price was nearing a decade-high before Elliott’s presence became public knowledge in the summer.</p>
<p>But for now Philips-Davies is concentrating on seeing off Elliott with a comprehensive rebuttal of its demands, claiming that a standalone renewables arm would suffer devastatingly higher borrowing costs.</p>
<p>This would make it harder to finance major projects including Dogger Bank, which will be the biggest wind farm in the world when it is completed, with implications for jobs, skills and ultimately the Government’s net zero objectives, he says.</p>
<h1> Volkswagen veers into the electric revolution as Angela Merkel hits the road </h1>
<p> German giant considers spinning off Porsche to help pay for drive to reinvent itself as a mass manufacturer of battery-powered cars </p>

<p>For VW that has the potential to be a huge problem. By virtue of a dizzying portfolio of brands, VW is China’s most popular car company with nearly a fifth of total sales, and China is its single most profitable market.</p>
<p>According to one study, Ferrari makes as much profit - $94,000 - on one car as Ford generates selling more than 900 cars. For VW the figure is about 56.</p>
<p>Although VW surrendered its crown as the world’s biggest carmaker to Toyota once again last year, it still made more than 9m cars and yet it is worth just $130bn.</p>
<p>A separation of Porsche will be a big moment. The bitter takeover saga that left VW in control has gone down in folklore. VW responded to what amounted to a hostile bid from Porsche by turning the tables and becoming acquirer.</p>
<p>The idea of something rising from the ashes is certainly an evocative one but it may surprise VW workers to learn that management thinks the company is parked on a burning platform.</p>

<p>Our embattled Prime Minister insists Plan B “is not a lockdown”, and indeed it is not. But who would bet against one this winter now, even though the country was promised it was all-but unthinkable?</p>
<p>Will schools close again too? How long before mandatory vaccinations are on the table? Again, nothing would surprise from a shambolic administration that has done more about-turns than a caffeinated drill sergeant.</p>
<a>from an illicit cheese and wine gathering</a> that makes the Barnard Castle affair look like a storm in a teacup.
<a>a return to working from home</a>, although Christmas parties are still on. In short, the usual cocktail of contradictions that sounds like it was brewed together at a lockdown drinking session round at Boris and Carrie’s.
<p>Everyone has had enough of corona restrictions and accompanying mixed messaging but the one that this government may live to regret the most is a knee-jerk working from home edict.</p>
<p>Each time the order is given to stay away from the office, working patterns that were intended to be temporary become even more entrenched with profound implications for the economy and society.</p>
<p>Our leaders are kidding themselves. One only has to look at the response from major employers to quickly understand that working from home is already here to stay. The Government just doesn’t want to admit it.</p>
<p>Such reticence is understandable. A recent study from consulting giant McKinsey concluded that about a fifth of the population could work remotely three days a week, though potentially as many as five.</p>
<p>At that level, there would be three to four times as many people working from home than before the pandemic, which would have a serious impact on city centres, transport, and consumer spending.</p>
<a>Britain’s crisp shortage</a> is over, so there’s hope for the festive season yet.
<p>Yet, McKinsey found that more than half the workforce has little or no opportunity for remote work, with many of these low wage jobs. The risk therefore is the creation of a two-tier society that exacerbates social inequality even further.</p>

<p>Events at Telecom Italia in Rome may be hundreds of miles from BT’s new 18-storey headquarters overlooking the City of London but for the company’s board they will feel uncomfortably close to home.</p>
<p>As French tycoon Patrick Drahi tightens his grip on the former state-backed monopoly there are some timely lessons to be drawn from the humiliating experience of its struggling Italian counterpart.</p>
<p>When it comes to creeping control, Bollore wrote the playbook, amassing a vast global empire through daring share raids on establishment assets such as French media giant Vivendi and publishing house and retail giant Lagadere.</p>
<a>The potential fallout would be massive. </a>
<p>Stung by criticism of its open door policy, ministers have begun to adopt a harder line, launching investigations into takeovers of defence suppliers Ultra Electronics and Meggitt, and micro chip-maker Arm.</p>
<p>A swoop on Britain’s national telecoms champion would be by far <a>the biggest test to date of Westminster’s newfound resolve,</a> and perhaps intervention against creeping control would send an even clearer message.</p>
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> The Bank of England is now fighting for its credibility on inflation </h1> <p> Andrew Bailey’s reluctance to raise rates is getting more incredulous by the day </p> </div> </div> </header>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Ben Marlow <div>Chief City Commentator</div> <time> 15 December 2021 • 4:30pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>If Andrew Bailey was already an “unreliable boyfriend” then the latest inflation figures threaten to propel him into the ranks of the undateables if he continues to stick doggedly to ultra-low rates in the face of spiralling prices.</p>
<p>With every new piece of economic data, the reputation of the Bank of England Governor takes another knock.</p>
<p>The headline rate of inflation is <a>now at its highest for more than a decade</a>, having soared to 5.1pc in November from 4.2pc the previous month.</p>
<p>The Resolution Foundation warned of a “nationwide squeeze” and Pat McFadden MP, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said families face “a cost of living crisis” this Christmas.</p>
<a>the economy</a> has bounced back more strongly than expected. In fact, it’s hard to think of a moment during the post-pandemic recovery when they got it right.
<p>Admittedly, predicting the oscillations of the economy isn’t an easy game, even less so after the worst shock for many generations.</p>
<p>The writing was on the wall as far back as April when inflation more than doubled to 1.5pc, a strong sign that the cost of living was beginning to spiral.</p>
<a>but not until April</a>. Yet, here we are, having exceeded that six months ahead of schedule.
<p>After wrong-footing financial markets last month by holding rates there is even more pressure on the Bank to up them at Thursday’s MPC meeting.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures are now pricing in a more than 70pc chance that the Bank of England will raise rates to 0.25pc, up from less than 50pc previously.</p>
<p>Yet, that looks misplaced. With the effects of omicron still unclear, most economists expect the rate-setters to stand firm once again but that is a high risk approach.</p>
<p>Even the IMF has warned about the perils of inaction bias, whereby the MPC looks for reasons not to tighten policy rather than the opposite. The Old Lady is fighting for its credibility.</p>

<p>Lockdown by stealth? Not at Boohoo, where a parallel universe encourages customers to “get party ready” with such wardrobe delights as a £2 crop top with matching sports gloves, whatever they are.</p>
<p>Cue fresh questions about whether Boohoo is coming apart at the seams as a result of supply chain struggles that have made it harder to live up to the “fast” part of the fast fashion promise.</p>
<p>With <a>omicron sending the world back into a de facto lockdown</a>, that may prove to be wishful thinking - but one thing that definitely isn’t transient is the threat posed from China.</p>
<a>Chinese apparel giant Shein</a> has taken the fashion world by storm.
<p>Despite the company’s spectacular rise, little is known about Shein. Its turnover isn’t disclosed but annual sales are estimated at more than $10bn.</p>
<p>Reports suggest the company’s most recent venture capital funding round valued it at £23bn, compared to £1.5bn for Boohoo, and £2bn for Asos, and that it has already captured a quarter of the American market.</p>
<p>But it has also developed a reputation as a business that exploits tax loopholes, abuses intellectual property rights, and thumbs its nose at the ethical standards that Boohoo and others <a>are under intense pressure to adhere more closely to</a>.</p>
<p>This is what should really be keeping Lyttle awake at night - an uneven playing field. When the supply bottlenecks eventually pass will Boohoo be left behind in the recovery because Shein isn’t operating under the same constraints?</p>
<header> <div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Rishi Sunak must decide whether he is Santa or Scrooge this Christmas </h1> <p> Ministers cannot stand idly by while swathes of the economy are struck down by a stealth lockdown </p> </div> </div> </header>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Ben Marlow <div>Chief City Commentator</div> <time> 17 December 2021 • 2:41pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Still, at least Rishi Sunak has cut short his trip to return home and face the music, an acknowledgement-of-sorts that the Government must provide support of some kind to the businesses most affected by the latest Covid restrictions. </p>
<p>His attempts to strike an upbeat tone have been drowned out by the gloomy rhetoric of Chris Whitty to the understandable frustration of ministers. </p>
<p>Not unfairly, the boss of Young’s pub group, Patrick Dardis, has likened the messaging to an Omicron “fear campaign” that has torpedoed trading for countless businesses that were already clinging on for dear life. </p>
<p>Yet bosses shouldn’t get their hopes up at Sunak’s premature return. The British Chambers of Commerce said businesses have heard “nothing from the Treasury” since the latest round of interventions began last week. </p>
<p>And the Chancellor will have done little to reassure anyone when he finally broke his silence late on Thursday. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sunak’s assertion that the situation this Christmas is different to last year is even more worrying. </p>
<p>Having come this far, the Treasury needs to see the bigger picture. Either it has wasted tens of billions propping up companies already or a few hundred million more won’t matter. Which is it? </p>
<p>It also needs to end the myopic obsession with treating the hospitality industry as a special case. There’s no doubt that pubs and restaurants are in the eye of the storm. </p>
<p>An early damage assessment counted 3m booking cancellations in the last week alone, equivalent to £2bn in lost earnings. But it’s not the only sector affected. </p>
<p>Are theatres, which are braced for a 50pc drop in theatre bookings any less deserving? How about concert venues, which have suffered a “catastrophic” 23pc fall in attendance since plan B was introduced? </p>
<p>Should the transport sector, where rail journeys are down nearly a quarter in just one week, and tube passengers have fallen a third, be left to fend for itself? </p>
<p>The Chancellor won’t be comfortable in either role this Christmas but he will have to choose: will Rishi be Santa or will he be Scrooge?</p>

<a>discourage investment, or worse, simply prevent it</a> because they are impossible to clear.
<p>But the very notion that net-zero-obsessed ministers are about to pave the way for a new era of exploration in the region is in itself laughable. Recent evidence alone would tell you that is emphatically not the case.</p>
<p>First the regulator rejected Shell’s plans to develop the Jackdaw field east of Aberdeen, which is estimated to hold gas resources equivalent to between 120m and 250m barrels, on the basis of environmental grounds yet to be made public.</p>
<p>Shell’s difficulties tell us everything there is to know about the direction of travel and there’s nothing positive about it for the people employed there, for the Scottish economy, or indeed the UK’s energy security.</p>
<p>How that is proof that the government is “supporting the industry in the transition to a lower carbon future, while also working to achieve the UK’s net zero commitment” is anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>In short, yet another spectacular own goal from Westminster as it barrels blindly ahead with a green agenda with scant regard for the economic and social consequences.</p>
<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> The Chancellor has served struggling hospitality bosses a bowl of thin gruel </h1> <p> The Government has already trapped businesses – and Britain – in a nightmare of indecision </p> </div> </div>

<p>Call off the search party. The Chancellor has made it back from California in one piece after all. </p>
<p>Perhaps it was the jet lag that prevented a public appearance until now. Or maybe the cold, hard data simply meant Rishi Sunak could no longer sit on his hands as thousands of businesses stare oblivion in the face.</p>
<p>After a week of dithering and inaction, the Treasury has finally acted to try to cushion the devastating effects of the government’s <a>woefully mismanaged response</a> to the omicron wave.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter that the country isn’t officially in lockdown, <a>people are behaving as if we are</a>, with crushing commercial consequences. </p>
<p>Yet, ministers have refused to act until such measures are formalised, leaving company bosses trapped in a Kafkaesque nightmare of indecision while city centres empty out and custom evaporates.</p>
<p>Chris Whitty’s plea for people to only attend social gatherings that “really matter to them” has hammered trading, forcing big employers to take some drastic decisions.</p>
<p>At Shepherd Neame, operator of 300 pubs mainly in the south-east of England, takings are down as much as 70pc in the capital as people follow the woolly guidance by avoiding social settings and busy, urban areas.</p>
<p>Phil Urban, chief executive of Britain’s largest listed pub company, Mitchells and Butlers, told the Today programme “from the moment Whitty stood up” there was a “sharp drop-off in trade” in city centres.</p>
<a>pledge to monitor the Covid data</a> at hourly intervals.
<a>if the initial reaction was anything to go by</a>. Sunak’s description of the £1bn support package as “generous” certainly isn’t shared by many top industry figures.
<p>Tim Rumney, chief executive of Best Western Hotels likened it to “a dud cracker on Christmas day” - “disappointing and underwhelming”. </p>
<p>Yet the suspicion about this Cabinet is that a poor understanding of businesses has rendered ministers incapable of grasping the precariousness of the situation this time around. </p>
<p>The hope will be that this is just the first slice of a more meaningful package, with the bulk of it still to come as the rules tighten - but bosses shouldn’t hold their breath. </p>
<p>At the crucial hour the Government has gone missing. Ministers and scientists are at loggerheads and there’s a split within the cabinet too, leaving Boris Johnson unable to make his mind up.</p>
<p>Britain is crying out for real leadership, but terrified of the political cost of reimposing lockdown days before Christmas, the Prime Minister is sitting on the fence, exacerbating the sense of uncertainty that is engulfing an entire nation.</p>
<p>He is allowing politics to triumph over simple common sense. Yet, further restrictions may be inevitable anyway, once the festivities are out of the way so he is simply prolonging the pain and ensuring it is even greater when it finally arrives.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s indecision threatens to kill tens of thousands of perfectly viable businesses, many of which the government has spent the last two years propping up. It’s an own goal of unfathomable proportions.</p>
<h1> Housebuilders got billions in taxpayer cash - they must end all their shoddy practices </h1>
<p> Doubling ground rents every decade is a mis-selling scandal that some campaigners compare to the banks' payment protection insurance racket </p>

<p>So how has the FTSE-100 constituent sought to live up to such a lofty assertion? By legging over thousands of homeowners with extortionate ground rents that doubled every 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>Countryside and Aviva have also settled with the watchdog, while an investigation into Barratt Homes is ongoing.</p>
<p>It is a <a>power imbalance that individual homeowners are unable to fight back</a> against without joining forces and forming courageous campaign groups, and even then the road to justice can be long, painful, and expensive. </p>
<p>Yet, fuelled primarily by the Treasury’s Help to Buy scheme, profits and share prices have gone through the roof, taking executive pay packets with it. </p>
<p>Housebuilders then got another unnecessary boost during the pandemic from the Chancellor’s stamp duty holiday and the mortgage guarantee scheme, which put a rocket-booster under the market.</p>
<p>While other major industries such as hospitality, travel, and the arts have struggled to stay afloat thanks to woefully inadequate government aid, the pandemic has been a boon for the housebuilding sector. </p>
<p>House prices are growing at their fastest pace in 15 years with the average cost hitting a record £273,000 at the end of November, an 8.2pc rise in the space of just 12 months. </p>
<p>Customers of new-builds are sadly used to second-rate standards, risible customer service, and in the case of the Grenfell cladding scandal, dangerous workmanship. It is an industry crying out for reform from top to bottom. </p>

<header> <h1> Families face £900 ‘triple whammy’ of tax hikes, inflation and benefit cuts </h1> <p> Inflation is set to surge to 3.5pc at the same time as National Insurance hike comes into force </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Tim Wallace <time> 14 September 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Families face losing £900 a year in 2022 as Boris Johnson’s tax raid combines with rising inflation to put a squeeze on household finances.</p>
<p>Economists fear the public are facing a “triple whammy” of tax increases, benefit cuts and rising prices between now and the spring, with pressure to fall heavily on the poorest workers.</p>
<p>Inflation is forecast to surge to 3.5pc by the early months of 2022, well above the Bank of England’s 2pc target, just as the <a>National Insurance rise</a> come into force.</p>
<p>The typical household spent just over £20,000 in 2019, the last pre-Covid year, according to the Office for National Statistics. Inflation of 3.5pc would push up the cost of buying those same goods and services by around £700.</p>
<p>Those on Universal Credit are set to lose the £20 per week increase – just over £1,000 per year – which was added as a temporary measure when Covid came in, and expires next month.</p>
<p>Martin Beck, chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said that lower income households will feel the pinch the most, cutting their spending which feeds through the wider economy.</p>
<p>He said: “It is going to hit their spending more than the better off who can cover some or all of the cost by saving less or drawing on their savings.</p>
<p>“<a>It is a triple whammy of inflation</a>, tax rises and benefit cuts.”</p>
<p>Most consumers are worried about inflation, according to Retail Economics, with over two-thirds reporting they have noticed a rise in the price of their groceries.</p>
<p>Concerns about prices now stand at a five-year high according to Richard Lim, the consultancy’s chief executive.</p>
<p>He said: “Inflation expectations are going to feed into levels of confidence, all at the same time that the Government is beginning to unwind a lot of its stimulative measures.</p>
<p>“The impact will be felt unevenly across different income groups - the least affluent are likely to be hardest hit.”</p>
<p>Household spending fell by almost a fifth during the pandemic, dropping more than £109 per week according to the ONS.</p>
<p>In some instances this was because previously necessary spending was no longer needed in lockdown, such as money usually budgeted for petrol or train and bus tickets for commuting.</p>
<p>However, the ONS also found that one-third of workers suffered a drop in income as workers lost their jobs or were furloughed.</p>
<p>A third of workers’ incomes fell according to the body, including more than 40pc of the lowest paid.</p>
<p>Mounting pressure in the jobs market is now forcing companies to raise wages, in a boost to workers.</p>
<p>More than half of all companies are planning to take on additional staff, a record high according to a Manpower survey of businesses which has been running since 1992.</p>
<p>Employment intentions are at a record across all sectors, and more than a quarter of companies are hiking starting salaries to attract workers.</p>
<p>A third are offering hybrid working because office staff have become used to working from home and do not want to travel in every day.</p>
<p>Manpower director Chris Gray said workers in high-margin industries such as digital businesses, IT and professional jobs are often being offered 10pc to 15pc more money to move.</p>
<header> <h1> Rishi Sunak refuses to rule out further tax rises </h1> <p> Addressing the Tory conference, the Chancellor does not dismiss the possibility that increases to income tax or council tax may be imposed </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 4 October 2021 • 12:53pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Rishi Sunak has refused to rule out further tax rises as he faces pressure from within the Conservative Party about the historically high tax burden.</p>
<p>In his first in-person speech to the Tory party conference as Chancellor, Mr Sunak did not dismiss the possibility that increases to income tax or council tax may be imposed.</p>
<p>"Yes, I want tax cuts. But in order to do that, our public finances must be put back on a sustainable footing," he said, warning that public debt was now nearly 100 per cent of GDP.</p>
<p>He is set to commit more than £500 million in fresh funding to help people back into work as he seeks to stem the continuing turbulence of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr Sunak is shifting the focus on to getting people into new or better jobs as the Government comes under sustained pressure over a major squeeze on living standards.</p>
<p>But the extra funding comes as Mr Sunak and Boris Johnson are under pressure from within the Tory ranks about the historically high tax burden, after they <a>raised national insurance contributions by 1.25 percentage points.</a></p>
<p>The Chancellor was asked repeatedly on Monday about whether he would approve further tax increases, including a hike to council tax to help fund social care after a warning from local authorities.</p>
<p>Mr Sunak told Sky News he would not "pre-empt" the local government finance settlement later in the year and added to LBC he "never can comment about future tax policy".</p>
<p>"But we took that decision because we wanted to make sure the NHS got the significant funds it requires to help recover strongly from coronavirus."</p>
<p>Funding for the new jobs package in his conference speech will not be set out until the spending review and Budget later this month.</p>
<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Commons Leader, has warned that taxation has hit "the limit".</p>
<p>Mr Sunak suggested it was his duty as Chancellor to tell the Prime Minister not to overspend after joking that he would cut up Mr Johnson's "credit card" to rein back his public spending.</p>
<p>"That was an old thing but I think that's something all chancellors say as part of our job," Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p>
<p>Mr Sunak was also forced to defend the decision to end the <a>£20-a-week uplift to Universal Credit</a> as families and workers face financial hardship, in a move some Tories have campaigned against.</p>
<p>And he conceded it was likely there would be shortages this Christmas, as the strains of coronavirus were compounded by a shortage of workers stemming from Brexit.</p>
<p>"We're seeing supply disruption not just here but in lots of different places and there are things we can try and mitigate and we are," Mr Sunak told Today.</p>
<p>"But we can't wave a magic wand. There's nothing I can do about the decision by a country in Asia to shut down a port because of a coronavirus outbreak."</p>
<p>In his conference speech, Mr Sunak announced the new funding will be used to help workers leaving the furlough scheme and unemployed over-50s back into work.</p>
<p>The "kickstart" scheme helping young people on Universal Credit will be extended to March next year under the measures and the £3,000 incentive for new apprentices will be extended until the end of January.</p>
<p>But the Chancellor's speech comes at a difficult time for the economy, with warnings of a cost-of-living crisis for some households who face rising energy bills, price hikes in shops and a cut to Universal Credit.</p>
<p>Household budgets will sustain a further blow next April when national insurance contributions rise by 1.25 percentage points to help fund the NHS and social care.</p>
<p>Shadow work and pensions secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the package "will do nothing to compensate for the Chancellor's tax rises, cost-of-living crisis and cuts to Universal Credit which are set to hammer millions of working families".</p>

<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Tom Harris <time> 29 October 2021 • 4:53pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Angela Rayner has, rightly, received much praise for her long and seemingly sincere apology for her injudicious remarks in which she described her political opponents as “Tory scum”.</p>
<p>“I will continue to speak my mind, stand up for Labour values and hold the government to account. But in the future I will be more careful about how I do that and in the language I use.”</p>
<p>Or does she merely regret that she spoke her mind? In private does she remain of the view that the government is a “bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile, banana republic, vile, nasty, Etonian piece of scum”?</p>
<p>If it has, then the party’s chances of winning the next general election – or any future general election – have improved.</p>
<p>If, however, Rayner’s change of heart is a mirror image of the wider party, it might hope to start rebuilding its relationship with those who have been tarred with the same class conscious brush that described three hundred odd MPs as scum.</p>
<p>A change of heart, not just vocabulary, is what is required.</p>

<p>“The ball has moved down the pitch, but it is now stuck,” the Prime Minister told the press pack in the dingy surroundings of the Cop26 media room. He was describing the progress of the conference, or lack of it.</p>
<a>bothered trekking to Glasgow in the first place.</a>

<p>In Cabinet, he specialises in damage limitation. When the solids hit the Vent-Axia, you’ll usually find Rishi; shirt starched, floppy quiff brylcreemed into submission, flashing his puppy-dog eyes appealingly on the morning broadcast round.</p>
<p>But on Thursday he faced a two-pronged attack – the double whammy of MPs' expenses and new data showing <a>disappointing GDP growth</a>, figures which TV economics editors pored over mercilessly.</p>
<p>“It’s fair to say we are an international laggard in terms of our recovery”, began Sky News numbers-whizz Ed Conway. “We’re slower than every other G7 nation”.</p>
<p>Conway struggled to contain his irritation behind a rictus grin: “Yeah but we are here to talk about GDP, Chancellor.”</p>
<a>universal credit taper rate reform</a> and the living wage.
<p>Back on Sky News, Conway’s questions were growing ever-more blunt. “Do you think <a>MPs earn enough</a>?”</p>
<p>Rishi looked momentarily uncomfortable, but soon that Head Boy smile was gleaming once again. “MPs’ pay is set by an independent body,” he began.</p>
<p>“Is it enough, though?”, barked Conway implacably, a la Jeremy Paxman.</p>

<h1> Blood-letting at the Westminster jungle as hyenas surround hoarse Boris Johnson </h1>
<p> Wednesday’s PMQs was more feeding frenzy, less human debate, so what better day for the Prime Minister to lose his voice? </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Madeline Grant <div>PARLIAMENTARY SKETCHWRITER</div> <time> 17 November 2021 • 8:07pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>“In addition to my duties in this house, I shall have further such meetings later today,” rasped Boris Johnson as he addressed the Commons on Wednesday. He’d lost his voice – and he could not have picked a worse day for it.</p>
<p>One of the rowdiest Prime Minister’s Questions in recent memory, it was followed by the semi-circular firing squad of the liaison committee and, perhaps most alarming of all, a rendezvous with his own backbenchers at the 1922 committee.</p>
<p>Even the Eeyore-ish Leader of the Opposition appeared animated. Sir Keir Starmer began in a familiar guise; the Witchfinder-General, scouring recent parliamentary controversies to unearth wrongdoing.</p>
<p>“When I was director of public prosecutions,” he whined, placing his hand on his chest, “I prosecuted MPs who broke the rules. He has been investigated by every organisation he’s ever been elected to.” </p>
<h2>Part jungle, part rodeo</h2>
<p>But the Prime Minister had a trump card which he deployed against all questions about standards or sleaze: <a>Sir Keir’s ties to Mishcon de Reya</a>, the law firm which he mentioned repeatedly, to the irritation of the Speaker.</p>
<p>“Prime Minister! Sit down!” he cried, morphing from Mr Chips into Miss Trunchbull. “In this House, I’m in charge!”</p>
<p>Chris Law of the SNP scanned the horizon for the fabled backbenchers.</p>
<p>Swooping on the decision to scale back the <a>Northern Powerhouse rail line</a>, an infuriated-looking Jake Berry demanded to know if “the North can take the PM at his word?”</p>
<p>Alone on the benches, Michael Fabricant sought a retraction: “The Leader of the Opposition <a>called the Prime Minister a coward</a>. Surely that is in breach of Erskine May, and improper, and should be withdrawn?”</p>
<p>“I withdraw it, but he’s no leader,” conceded Sir Keir. </p>
<p>But the Prime Minister was not there to witness this most barbed of disclaimers. He had already cantered away like a panicked wildebeest.</p>

<h1> Grab the best seats in the House ... panto season has officially kicked off in Parliament </h1>

<p>“I see they’ve turned up this week, Prime Minister!” chuckled the Leader of the Opposition, radiating his patented goofy grin at the Tory backbenches.</p>
<p>But there they were there, all right, and cheered and huzzaed in all the right places.</p>
<h2>Oh no, they did not...</h2>
<p>Boris Johnson, despite recent setbacks, had arrived in bouncy form. Hair flapping madly, he bobbed about like a Jack-in-the-box, while the Leader of the Opposition often struggled to pin him down.</p>
<p>Sir Keir Starmer tried posing the same question on social care multiple times, though the Prime Minister’s answer remained unchanged.</p>
<p>“Let’s have another go,” sighed Sir Keir, in the world-weary tones of a driving instructor overseeing yet another aborted three-point turn.</p>
<p>But the Jack-in-the-box bounded out of trouble with red herrings aplenty, and a few complaints about Labour’s own failure to deal with the problem during their time in office.</p>
<p>At other moments, Sir Keir seemed to be doing a convincing impression of… a Telegraph editorial column. “The only thing he’s delivering is high prices, high taxes and low growth!” he cried, gesturing at the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The Leader of the Opposition even likened Mr Johnson and Rishi Sunak to a pair of pickpockets, rinsing the taxpayer with a complex dual-pronged attack.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson retaliated with an insult guaranteed to send Middle England rushing for their red rosettes, accusing the Labour leader of <a>campaigning against HS2</a>.</p>
<h2>Please, sir, can we have some more... leadership?</h2>
<a>“Blue on Blue” briefings</a> and disobliging speculation over
<p>The Prime Minister hit back with a risky gambit: politician-splaining. “What the people of this country want to hear is less talk about politics,” he said.</p>
<p>Presuming to speak for the public is usually a terrible idea, especially when they’ve a fair bit to be angry about. But in this Chamber at least, he managed to raise a few cheers from the Tory faithful.</p>
<p>Faithful – for now. </p>
