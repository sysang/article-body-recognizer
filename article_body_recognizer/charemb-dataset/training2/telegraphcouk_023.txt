<h2>Eight diversity hacks to get more plants into your diet</h2>
<li>Swap crisps for a handful of toasted nuts or seeds, or try saving your potato or butternut squash peelings to roast in the oven for a crispy snack</li>
<li>If you’re making a fruit crumble, substitute a third of the flour with oats and another third with ground almonds</li>
<li>Don’t just add kidney beans to your chilli; replace with mixed beans.</li>
<li>Switch your single piece of fruit for half a cup of mixed berries (fresh or frozen).</li>
<li>Every time you go to serve up a meal at home, stop and think, ‘What could I add?’ Chop a banana over your muesli, add some sprouts to your sandwich, slice a tomato on to your plate – every bit counts.</li>
<li>Stock up on frozen veg and fruit – so when you’ve got nothing fresh left, it doesn’t matter. For extra diversity, buy mixed bags of both.</li>
<li>No casserole, stew, risotto or pie is complete without one more vegetable than the recipe says – it can be as simple as adding a tin of lentils or chickpeas</li>
<li>Make up a seed shaker and add a sprinkle to cereals, yoghurt, smoothies and salads, or eggs, avocado on toast, or soup.</li>
<h1> Stuart Broad claiming his bunny David Warner only highlights England's Ashes selection folly </h1>

<p>In theory, it was a sound philosophy: invest in world-class talent to build the most star-studded squad in the Premiership, on suitably lucrative contracts, and watch the results roll in.</p>
<p>Part of the problem has been absence. Radradra has only played three matches, Steven Luatua has been in and out, and Kyle Sinckler’s game time has been limited by international duty.</p>
<a>Radradra has looked rusty</a> - but that does not excuse losing the ball in contact in every match he has played. Ball security is basic and his inability to maintain possession has undone his initial good work.
<p>A big money recruit from Harlequins, Sinckler has been underwhelming. It is not that the tighthead has played badly, but he has not dominated in the loose or at set-piece in the manner Bristol would have expected from a Lions prop.</p>
<p>An attacking fly-half by nature, Sheedy has faltered without as much front foot ball, creating half as many tries per 80 minutes this season. Bristol have recruited Sale fly-half AJ MacGinty for next campaign to provide an alternative. </p>

<header> <h1> Energy bill discount could be extended to more homes </h1> <p> The Warm House Discount could be increased or rolled out to more households under plans being considered by the Treasury </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Lucy Fisher, Deputy Political Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Millions of low-income households could benefit from an increased discount on their energy bills, under plans being examined by the Government.</p>
<p>Officials are drawing up options that could see the monetary value or eligibility of an existing support scheme extended to help alleviate a looming cost of living crisis, The Telegraph has learned.</p>
<a>the cost of energy bills over the winter period</a> October 2021 to March 2022. It is funded from social levies applied to all families’ energy bills and is paid directly to suppliers.
<p>It is understood that the Warm Home Discount could be made more generous sooner, however, to help low-income, fuel-poor families and pensioners, under proposals currently being examined.</p>
<p>No final decisions have been made, but the mechanism is viewed in Whitehall as neatly encapsulating all the people that Boris Johnson has signalled the Government wants to help with targeted extra support.</p>
<p>A series of senior Tory MPs have voiced concerns about a cost of living squeeze coming in April, when energy bills are set to soar just as a planned National Insurance tax rise is due to come into force.</p>
<p>Meanwhile inflation, which rose last month to 5.1 per cent, is reducing Britons’ spending power, with a particular impact on pensioners.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Mr Johnson dismissed calls, backed by some Conservatives and the Labour Party, <a>to axe VAT on energy bills</a> to help household finances.</p>
<p>It marked a U-turn on his previous vow, made in May 2016, that the tax would be scrapped from energy bills if Britons voted for Brexit. The European Union mandates that member states must levy a minimum rate of five per cent VAT on energy.</p>
<p>Scrapping the tax would save an average household around £60 a year on their energy bills, while costing the Treasury £1.7 billion.</p>
<p>While he appeared to rule out the move, the Prime Minister hinted that the Government is prepared to offer additional support, however. </p>
<p>Another proposal put forward by MPs and industry to ease pressure on domestic consumers is for the Government to scrap or suspend <a>green levies on energy bills</a>, in a move that could save families £200 a year.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, senior Tory MP Robert Halfon warned that the coming increase in energy bills “could cause enormous financial distress” and plunge another two million people into fuel poverty.</p>
<a>met with energy bosses</a> to discuss the future of the retail market and talk through options to mitigate the looming increase in bills. The talks were said to have been “constructive”.
<p>Earlier in the day, the head of the trade body for energy suppliers warned that the rise in energy prices is impacting the entire economy.</p>
<p>Emma Pinchbeck, the chief executive of Energy UK, said the spike in energy prices expected in April could lead to a two per cent rise in the cost of living.</p>
<p>“This is a wholesale price risk, which is a whole-economy risk, it doesn't just apply to the energy retailers or the sector,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.</p>
<header> <h1> Kew Gardens founding father branded ‘enabler of slavery’ in woke row </h1> <p> Critics decry English Heritage move to reappraise legacy of Sir Joseph Banks, 200 years after the death of the visionary botanist </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Craig Simpson <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:35pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Sir Joseph Banks has been credited as a visionary scientist who helped make Kew the leading botanical garden it is today.</p>
<p>But English Heritage has branded him an “enabler of slavery”, claiming his scientific work was pursued with the “ultimate aim” of helping British colonialism.</p>
<a>Black Lives Matter protests</a>. The information adds that he aided British interests by devising schemes for the import of sheep and production of tea.
<p>Employed by George III as an unofficial director at Kew, Sir Joseph helped make it a centre of botanical science. As president of the Royal Society for more than 40 years, Sir Joseph also steered scientific endeavour in Britain.</p>
<p>He has been <a>hailed by Sir David Attenborough</a> as a “very important figure in the history of science” and a “panjandrum” of British science.</p>
<p>Examples cited include Sir Joseph’s suggestion that tea could be grown in part of British India instead of China, and his importing of Merino sheep from Spain, which ultimately “formed the basis of the Australian wool industry”. </p>
<p>English Heritage information drafted in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests has also picked out the racial opinions of Sir Joseph, and states that his “attitude to other races was typical of Europeans of his era”.</p>
<p>A spokesman for English Heritage said: “English Heritage started an ongoing programme of updating the online entry for each blue plaque recipient.</p>
<p>“English Heritage has no plans to remove any of our blue plaques or to add any physical interpretation at the site of a plaque.”</p>
<h2>Kew Gardens' history reassessed</h2>
<p>Kew Gardens itself, first established in 1759, expanded under George III with the help of Sir Joseph, has been <a>recently reassessed for its links to British colonialism</a>.</p>
<p>Following Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, Richard Deverell, its director, wrote that “parts of Kew’s history shamefully draw from a legacy that has deep roots in colonialism and racism”.</p>
<p>While many plants were said to be discovered by Western men of science like Sir Joseph, Kew's director of science said scientists had historically “appropriated indigenous knowledge”.</p>
<p>It was announced in March 2021 that the botanic gardens would replace display boards for specimens like sugar cane, which was historically harvested by slaves, in order to highlight the site’s “imperial legacy”.</p>

<header> <h1> Italy makes Covid jabs compulsory for over-50s to tackle surge of cases </h1> <p> Cabinet adopts strict new rule that follows vaccine passes for public transport and restaurants </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 6 January 2022 • 12:24am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Italy has announced that Covid-19 vaccinations will become compulsory for anyone over the age of 50 from next month in an effort to tackle surging infections.</p>
<p>"We want to slow down the curve of contagion and encourage Italians who have not yet been vaccinated to do so," Prime Minister Mario Draghi said during a cabinet meeting at which the measure was adopted, according to a statement.</p>
<p>"We are working in particular on the age groups that are most at risk of being hospitalised, to reduce pressure on hospitals to save lives," he added.</p>
<p>In another statement, the government said that "the vaccine pass will be necessary for people over 50 in the public and private sectors to access their workplace from February 15."</p>
<p>Out of Italy's 59 million people, 28 million are over the age of 50, according to the Istat national statistics agency.</p>
<p>Late last month the government said that from January 10 a vaccination pass would be required to use public transport and access hotels, restaurant terraces and gyms.</p>
<p>Previously a health pass giving proof of vaccination - or a recent negative test - had been required.</p>
<p>As in much of Western Europe, Italy has seen its Covid cases soar in recent days, recording 189,000 on Wednesday, up from more than 170,000 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A total of 1.4 million people are currently positive in the country.</p>
<p>Italy was the European country first hit by the pandemic in early 2020 and still has one of the highest death tolls, at more than 138,000.</p>
<h1> Duchess of Sussex will receive £1 from Mail on Sunday for breaching her privacy </h1>
<p> But the newspaper will pay £300,000 towards the Duchess's legal costs, as well as an undisclosed sum for copyright infringement </p>
<div> <div> By Hannah Furness, Royal Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 8:18pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Duchess of Sussex will receive £1 from the Mail on Sunday for breaching her privacy, along with a secret lump sum - after a judge agreed she could claim a share of the newspaper's profits from a story which breached her copyright.</p>
<p>The Mail on Sunday will pay an initial instalment of £300,000 towards the Duchess's legal costs this week, as well as an undisclosed sum for copyright infringement.</p>
<p>The two parties have now settled on a "confidential sum".</p>
<p>That was to include evidence of how much the publisher gained financially from its publication of the letter, in relation to the infringement of the Duchess's copyright.</p>
<p>The newspaper has already issued a printed acknowledgement of the legal ruling.</p>
<header> <h1> Lord Ahmed found guilty of trying to rape a young girl </h1> <p> Former Labour peer has also been convicted of a serious sexual assault against a boy in offences dating back almost 50 years </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Martin Evans, Crime Correspondent <time> 5 January 2022 • 3:48pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Nazir Ahmed, the former Labour peer, has been found guilty of child sex offences dating back almost 50 years.</p>
<p>The 64-year-old, who was formerly Lord Ahmed of Rotherham, was convicted of twice attempting to rape a young girl and also a count of buggery against a young boy.</p>
<p>Mohammed Tariq, 65, and Mohammed Faroq, 71 – Ahmed’s two older brothers, who were both found unfit to plead or take part in the trial – were also found to have committed indecent assaults.</p>
<p>Sheffield Crown Court heard how Ahmed’s female victim went to police in 2016 to make allegations dating back to the early Seventies, when he was aged about 16 or 17.</p>
<p>During the trial, the jury was played a recording of a telephone call between her and the male victim when they both discussed the abuse.</p>
<h2>Victim accounts ‘credible and true’</h2>
<p>Tom Little QC, prosecuting, told the jury that the call was prompted by the man contacting the woman by email saying: “I have evidence against that paedophile.”</p>
<p>The judge, Mr Justice Lavender, will determine on Wednesday afternoon when Ahmed will be sentenced.</p>
<p>“By these verdicts, the jury has clearly decided that no matter the delay between the offences and the trial, and the defences raised, they could be sure that the accounts of the victims were credible and true.</p>
<h2>Political career blighted by scandals</h2>
<p>Ahmed’s conviction on charges of historic child sex abuse marks the downfall of a controversial figure who was dogged by scandal throughout his political career and personal life.</p>
<p>Born in Kashmir, the disputed area of Pakistan in 1957, he came to the UK with his parents aged 12, not speaking a word of English, and settled in Rotherham, South Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Politically ambitious, he joined the Labour Party at 18 and studied public administration at Sheffield Polytechnic. He became a Labour councillor in Rotherham in 1990 and was made chairman of the South Yorkshire Labour Party three years later.</p>
<p>A passionate advocate of British Pakistani affairs, he founded the British Muslim Councillor’s Forum and also became a magistrate.</p>
<p>In 1998, he was created a life peer, Baron Ahmed of Rotherham, and often used the platform to defend British Muslims. He campaigned against forced marriage and criticised the wearing of the face veil by some British Muslim women.</p>
<p>However, his outspoken views on sensitive issues and allegations of anti-Semitism often brought him into conflict with his own colleagues and party, and sometimes tainted his reputation in Parliament.</p>
<p>Following the 9/11 attacks, Ahmed claimed his phones had been tapped by the Government because of his opposition to the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Ahmed regularly attacked Labour over its foreign policy and was highly critical when Sir Tony Blair knighted writer Salman Rushdie, the author of The Satanic Verses, which he claimed was deeply offensive to Islam.</p>
<h2>The beginning of the end</h2>
<p>But away from politics, it was his personal life where things dramatically unravelled.</p>
<p><a>On Christmas Day 2007</a>, he was involved in a fatal crash on the M1 in South Yorkshire for which he was eventually jailed for 12 weeks.</p>
<p>He was convicted of dangerous driving after a court heard how he had been using his mobile phone to send text messages just before he hit a 28-year-old man who had got out of his car following a crash.</p>
<p><a>Ahmed was subsequently freed</a> from jail after the Court of Appeal said the original sentence should have been suspended.</p>
<p>However, in 2013 he was suspended from Labour after giving an interview to a Pakistani media outlet in which he blamed his conviction on a <a>“Jewish conspiracy”</a>.</p>
<p>He suggested he had been targeted because he had visited Gaza to lend his support to the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Ed Miliband, the Labour leader at the time, described the comments as “disgraceful” and ordered an investigation.</p>
<p>Ahmed later apologised for the comments and said they were “completely wrong” and “unacceptable” and he subsequently resigned from the Labour Party.</p>
<h2>Sexual impropriety claims</h2>
<p><a>In February 2019</a>, he was accused of sexual impropriety after a woman came forward to allege that he had exploited her vulnerability to pursue a relationship with her.</p>
<p>The woman, who was being treated for anxiety and depression, approached the peer believing he might be able to help her get the Metropolitan Police to investigate a faith healer who she believed was exploiting women.</p>
<p>However, she later claimed the married father-of-three had used his position to pursue a sexual relationship with her before suddenly breaking off all contact.</p>
<h1> Jacob Rees-Mogg tells Rishi Sunak to abandon National Insurance rise amid cost of living crunch </h1>
<p> Pressure within Cabinet reflects unease over household finances, as concerns also remain about impact of omicron on critical industries </p>
<div> <div> By Ben Riley-Smith, Political Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 9:30pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg called for the National Insurance rise to be abandoned at Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting as the UK struggles with a cost of living crisis triggered by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Telegraph understands that <a>Mr Rees-Mogg</a>, the House of Commons Leader, <a>spoke out against the tax rise</a> coming into effect this April, but Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, rejected the call.</p>
<p>Three government sources familiar with the Cabinet discussions, including one in the room, confirmed the exchange. Advisers to Mr Rees-Mogg and Mr Sunak declined to comment.</p>
<p>Calling for a policy that was only announced by the Prime Minister in September to be ditched reflects <a>the scale of concern</a> from some in the Cabinet about the looming cost of living crunch and tax increases.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Boris Johnson faced calls from his backbenchers to produce an exit strategy from current Covid-19 restrictions and show how the UK can “live with this virus” in the long term.</p>
<p>Theresa May, the former Tory prime minister, said it was “not in the national interest to partially or wholly shut down sectors of our economy every time we see a new variant”.</p>
<p>Addressing the House of Commons, the Prime Minister confirmed that the Cabinet had approved plans to continue with “Plan B” restrictions in the face of the omicron surge.</p>
<p>It means that legally binding face mask requirements, work from home guidance and Covid passports in large crowd venues are set to remain until January 26 in England. No tightening of the rules is imminent.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson also announced a significant easing of Covid travel restrictions.</p>
<p>People travelling to the UK will no longer have to take pre-departure Covid tests, self-isolate on arrival or take a PCR test once back, saving holidaying families hundreds of pounds.</p>
<p>Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish First Minister, on Wednesday cut Scottish self-isolation requirements from 10 to seven days, matching a move made by Mr Johnson for England.</p>
<p>Ms Sturgeon, the SNP leader, had adopted a more restrictive approach to Covid rules over the Christmas break. She said on Wednesday she would make “no apology” for the early caution.</p>
<p>Concern remains within the Government about how the surge of omicron cases could impact industries of critical national importance to the UK, with the situation being closely monitored.</p>
<p>Cutting the seven day self-isolation requirement to five days – a move taken by America – was said to be “under review”, though Downing Street sources played down the chance of the change being adopted soon.</p>
<h2>Absenteeism in the public sector</h2>
<p>It also emerged on Wednesday that trade unions are telling members they can stay off work for 28 days without a sick note amid fears new rules to battle Covid-19 are fuelling absenteeism in the public sector.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson also appeared to open the door to approving a fourth round of Covid-19 vaccine doses for frontline healthcare workers and other vulnerable people, saying in the Commons that independent science advisers were considering the idea.</p>
<p>During the first Prime Minister's Questions since the Christmas break, Mr Johnson was peppered with calls to provide extra help for households facing a steep rise in the cost of living this year.</p>
<p>In April, <a>energy bills are set to soar</a> when the price cap is increased amid gas supply problems. Tax rises will also kick in that month – both the increase in National Insurance and the freezing of income tax personal thresholds.</p>
<a>Tory manifesto pledge from the December 2019 election</a> in order to help fund a £36 billion investment in the NHS and social care reform.
<h2>‘Long-term plan for living with Covid’</h2>
<p>Mr Sunak is understood to have rejected the suggestion at the Cabinet meeting, arguing that scrapping the tax rise would mean billions of pounds needed to tackle NHS backlogs would have to be found elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the House of Commons debate about Covid strategy, a number of Tory MPs pushed the Prime Minister to spell out his proposed exit plan from Covid restrictions in the long term.</p>
<p>Mark Harper, chairman of the lockdown-sceptic <a>Covid Recovery Group</a>, said: “We cannot respond to every new variant in the way we have to this one. We have got to have a plan to live with this virus, like normal, forever.”</p>
<p>Steve Brine, a former health minister, pressed Mr Johnson on a “long-term plan for living with Covid in 2022” and suggested the current measures were not “sustainable”.</p>
<p>During his responses Mr Johnson indicated that by the end of January there was a “good chance” of “getting back to something like normality as fast as possible”.</p>
