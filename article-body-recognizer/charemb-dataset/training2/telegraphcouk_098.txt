<p>Priti Patel addressed the Commons in miserable circumstances, following the biggest single loss of life in the Channel since the migrant crisis began. “There are no simple solutions,” she warned.</p>
<p>Lining up on the sympathetic side were the SNP and the independent MP for Islington North, late of the Labour whip, Jeremy Corbyn. “Pushing them back is not a solution,” he proclaimed. “It is brutality.”</p>
<p>Some SNP MPs painted the Government as a heartless landlord, callously turning away the needy and desperate. “Will she commit today to ending all discussion of the dangerous practice of offshoring?” demanded a hand-wringing Martyn Day.</p>
<p>“It’s such a shame that the SNP, a party that has failed to support asylum seekers in their own local authorities…”</p>
<p>An hour later, the Commons seemed no closer to agreeing on the causes of this intractable problem – let alone finding a solution.</p>

<h1> Keir Starmer gives his best rendition of a Commons greatest hit: 'Last Christmas' </h1>
<p> There was a strange sense of déjà vu in the House, as the Labour leader tried to have Boris Johnson cancelled for Christmas 2020 </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Madeline Grant <div>PARLIAMENTARY SKETCHWRITER</div> <time> 1 December 2021 • 7:09pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<a>accusing the PM of hosting a boozy bash in Number 10 last year</a> while the rest of the country was under lockdown. “No Mr Speak-ah!” cried the PM, in Mockney sing-song. “All rules were followed”.
<div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Hang on a minute ... Jacob Rees-Mogg has the blighters on the run </h1> <p> SNP and Labour are no match for the Troll King as he twists and turns his way out of attack with faux-courtesy and a twinkly expression </p> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Madeline Grant <time> 2 December 2021 • 8:00pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Watching Jacob Rees-Mogg in full flow at Business Questions sometimes feels like tuning in for an episode of Just A Minute - but with the rules in reverse. </p>
<p>In this version of the fast-talking panel show, repetition and hesitation are actively encouraged. So too are rambling expeditions off-topic through some wanton misunderstanding of the question.</p>
<a>Online Harms Bill</a> be presented to Parliament, Debonnaire wanted to know. “Could the Leader of the House help us out?”, she grinned across the dispatch box. “Could he tell us what ‘soon’ means?”
<h2>Mr Troll v Mr Droll</h2>
<p>For a moment, I sensed the ghost of Nicholas Parsons entering Parliament to mouth “deviation” and shake his fist at proceedings.</p>
<p>Not for the first time, the SNP’s Pete Wishart seemed unamused by the high kinks in Westminster. </p>
<p>“Hurrah! Raise the flags! Let’s have a party in Downing Street!” sulked Wishart. “He at last had a face mask on his fizzog,” he added, of the Commons Leader’s temporary conversion to mask-wearing.</p>
<p>In a matter of sentences, Wishart’s dirge had broadened from Rees-Mogg to the rest of the Chamber. </p>
<p>He began with the libertarian wing of the Tory Party - mask-less “menaces” - before tearing into both the Government and the official opposition. </p>
<p>“[The Tories] have lost their polling lead to the Labour Party,” he gloated, gesturing unkindly at Debonnaire and her fellow MPs. “The Labour Party, for goodness sake!”</p>
<p>“The Scottish people are looking at this corrupt, sleazy cesspit and they do not like what they see!”</p>
<p>“Wheeeey!” came the cry from his assembled retainers, as if all politics north of the border operated with the purity of a Brownie pack or Quaker Meeting House.</p>
<p>But the master of deviation had one final trick up his sleeve. </p>
<p>The<a> SNP</a> glowered behind their masks. The Just A Minute superstar - the Commons’ answer to Paul Merton - had prevaricated for the full 60 seconds to beat the buzzer.</p>
<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> Bureaucratic Britain has become addicted to permanent failure </h1> <p> Instead of learning from mistakes, we’re trapped in a spiral of incompetence and terrible misjudgments </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Madeline Grant <time> 7 December 2021 • 9:30pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<a>bureaucratic hold-ups</a>. Last weekend, England vaccinated fewer people than it did before ministers vowed to put the campaign “on steroids” to strengthen our resistance to the omicron variant.
<p>In a way, these developments reflect a paradox – that we are doubling down on the worst of our Covid failures, even as the counter-evidence piles up. </p>
<h1> Plan Beached Whale in full swing as Boris attempts the mother of all diversionary tactics </h1>
<p> Could it be that when Downing Street wants to bury bad news of an illicit Christmas bash it removes the freedoms of 60m people? Possibly ... </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Madeline Grant <div>PARLIAMENTARY SKETCHWRITER</div> <time> 8 December 2021 • 8:37pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>“By reducing your contacts in the workplace, you will help slow transmission,” he urged, putting on his best gruff Churchillian voice – advice that, given events of the last 24 hours, seemed almost calculated to enrage. </p>
<p>“How can you stand at that lectern exactly where some of your team laughed and joked about Covid-19 rules … and tell people they must now follow your new instructions?” demanded the <a>BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg</a>. </p>
<h2>Allegra Stratton - valued colleague or departed can-carrier?</h2>
<p>The Prime Minister retaliated in Just A Minute style – filibustering her question with a lengthy paean to his departed can-carrier – sorry, valued colleague – <a>Allegra Stratton</a>. </p>
<p>Were these new proposals merely a ploy to knock unfavourable stories off the front page, asked The Telegraph’s Ben Riley-Smith? The PM rambled and shuffled uneasily, looking wan – a reanimated corpse balancing a straw thatch. </p>
<p>Back in the Commons, Sajid Javid was almost drowned out by calls of “Resign!” from the Tory backbenches as he trudged through his statement.</p>
<a> Philip Davies</a>. Labour, naturally, were very angry, but they’d be supporting the new restrictions, come what may. 
<p>In the end, there was nothing for it but to pour a hefty glass of wine and tuck into a giant platter of cheese.</p>
<h1> The Praetorian guard defended the PM, but there would be no reward </h1>
<p> It’s a dirty job to pick up the pieces of the Conservatives’ bruised reputation following ‘Partygate’, but someone’s got to do it </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Madeline Grant <div>PARLIAMENTARY SKETCHWRITER</div> <time> 9 December 2021 • 7:38pm </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>To say that Michael Ellis had drawn the short straw on Thursday would be an understatement. It had fallen to the Cabinet Office to answer Labour MP Fleur Anderson’s “Urgent Question about Number 10 parties”. </p>
<p>And the role of representing the department in this unenviable gig had evidently trickled down the official rolodex, past such luminaries as Steve Barclay and Oliver Dowden, all the way to the luckless Ellis.</p>
<p>At the height of public indignation over Barnard Castle, the hapless <a>Robert Jenrick</a> was dispatched to go and encourage people to “draw the line” under the incident – and got the sack anyway.</p>
<h2>Fearless in the face of fury</h2>
<a>“party” and a “gathering”</a>, Labour’s Angela Eagle wanted to know – but not before commiserating with Ellis on his unpleasant job. MPs recorded their own lockdown tragedies and
<a>those of their constituents</a>; we heard of fathers kept away from the bedside of wives in labour; a constituent’s elderly mother dying alone on Christmas Day, unable to receive visitors.
<p>The happy news that the Prime Minister and his wife had been <a>safely delivered of a baby girl</a> did little to assuage their fury. Instead, they merely groaned.</p>
<p>Undaunted, the Praetorian Guard prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. “I know the Prime Minister,” he told Alistair Carmichael. “He is a friend of mine. I know him to be a man of honour and integrity.”</p>
<p>Rome may be falling, but the Paymaster General’s heroic last stand will live on in the annals of history.</p>

<p>The brainchild of chef Nobu Matsuhisa in collaboration with actor Robert de Niro and film producer Meir Teper, the first Nobu Hotel opened in 2013, at Caesar’s Palace, Las Vegas.</p>
<p>At the end of 2020, the group opened its 13<sup>th</sup> property, Nobu London Portman Square, with its penthouse suite launching nine months later in the autumn of 2021.</p>
<sup>th</sup> (top) floor. With a terrace that wraps all around it, the suite has spectacular views over London in all directions and a soothing, gentle ambience.
<p>Being able to enjoy the Nobu menu in the gorgeous penthouse setting feels like a wonderful indulgence.</p>
<p>While most of the suite’s seating – from the leather armchairs in the living room to an organically curved corner sofa in the master bedroom – is incredibly comfortable, the main L-Shaped sofa looks good but is inexplicably hard. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, there’s a vast gym and a wellness area with three treatment rooms, a shop selling sportswear and a 'grab and go' café.</p>
<p>On a prominent corner of Marylebone’s Portman Square, moments from Oxford Street. </p>

<a>Coombeshead Farm in Cornwall</a>, where staff refill prosaic glass dispensers in the guest bathrooms with high quality proprietorial body wash and shampoo blends. It has to happen. 
<p>And yes, you might be thrilled to see a row of Malin+Goetz body products by the sink when you get to the room, but doesn’t the idea of slipping into a jacuzzi thrill you more than any amount of fancy grapefruit face cleanser?</p>

<header> <h1> The UK's best hotel openings of the year – and hot tips for 2022 </h1> <p> As 2021 draws to a close, our experts look back on their favourite stays – and trends to look out for next year </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Sherelle Jacobs ; Fiona Duncan ; Mark C. O’Flaherty and Hattie Garlick <time> 27 December 2021 • 8:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>But it’s the high-rise Japanese izakaya restaurant 8, with its rooftop garden, that steals the show. Guests can sip on jasmine margaritas in front of the fire pit before sitting down to the omakase tasting menu. </p>
<p>Soaking in the skyline with my cocktail in hand, I couldn’t help but think that the Londoner perfectly encapsulates the capital’s enduring ability to awe, even through these uncertain times.</p>
<p>The details: Doubles from £400 including breakfast (020 7451 0101; thelondoner.com).</p>
<p>If the hotels I have reviewed this year are anything to go by, British hospitality – buoyed by the rise in staycations – is in fine fettle, despite the rough ride it has experienced at the hands of the pandemic. </p>
<a>Glebe House</a>), the rise of the townhouse hotel (
<a>Mayfair</a> to name but two) and the continued emphasis on natural living and quirky, back-to-nature accommodation (such as at the
<a>Tawny</a> and Callow Hall) in increasingly offbeat locations around the country.
<p>I thoroughly enjoyed almost everywhere I stayed this year. As for my favourite, there are several contenders, but for a fully fledged country house hotel with wow factor, I would urge you to head to a quiet corner of Derbyshire. </p>
<p>While you might kick off your shoes at Callow Hall, you will want to dress up for cocktails and (a very good) dinner in the fabulous Garden Room.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time at hotels in London this year, largely because anywhere with fewer than 50 rooms and less than a six-hour train ride from the capital was booked out until pretty much the end of the century. </p>
<p>The details: Rooms from £400 a night, including dinner at the chef’s table and breakfast. There is one accessible bedroom on the ground floor (01491 529837; crockersuk.com).</p>
<p>Six months later, Ed and Esther have been rushed off their feet but their energy and optimism remain. In fact, the hotel will welcome its first baby in April. It’s little surprise that their formula proved wildly popular.</p>

<p>Locked doors spark imagination and intrigue – none more so than the flight deck door of an airliner. For the best part of 20 years, they have remained firmly closed from gate to gate, with access permitted only to the operating crew. </p>
<p>So what happens behind this impenetrable barrier?</p>
<p>There’s little mystery surrounding the start, but once the plane is airborne, is the hard work over? Do we just sit there with our feet up as the autopilot takes the strain? Not quite.</p>
<p>If there is a discrepancy, we must take action to ascertain why. Typically this will be down to stronger headwinds or an inefficient cruising altitude. However, we must always be alert to the threat of a leak. They are rare, but do occur.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, there is no clear path and we have to take the ‘least bad’ route. If you hear the pilots telling the cabin crew to take their seats, you definitely should not be leaving yours.</p>

<header> <h1> On board the first low-cost flight from Britain to Bangkok </h1> <p> Budget airline Scoot has launched uber-cheap flights to Thailand, starting from £200 one-way </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Emma Featherstone <time> 20 December 2021 • 11:46am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Twelve and a half hours… would you happily spend that long in the air without the usual, generous selection of Hollywood films, and no sign of free meals or snacks, never mind a complimentary GT?</p>
<p>Ahead of my first experience of Scoot, I asked Campbell Wilson, Scoot’s chief executive, what Britons should expect from the company. </p>
<p>“Scoot is not your typical low cost airline,” he said. “We’re absolutely not cheap and nasty. We’re cheap and cheerful and represent great value.” </p>
<p>In other words, Scoot would prefer to swerve comparisons to certain European cut-price carriers.</p>
<p>To begin with, Scoot is offering a short batch of introductory flights, three times a week until December 27. Then, from March 2022, you’ll be able to board one of its canary-yellow planes at Gatwick year-round. Can it prove a success?</p>
<p>The seeming clarity of Scoot's pricing is appealing. Indeed, passengers can log into Scoot’s mobile app to see exactly how the costs break down: £82 for air passenger duty; a £16.81 passenger service charge. </p>
<p>Two stipulations that are now commonplace across the world – proof of full vaccination (for the moment, that means two jabs) and a negative pre-departure test – are top of Thailand’s regulations.</p>
<p>Each caller to the check-in desks was asked to lay out their papers. The thoroughness of this process reminded me of my visa appointment at the American embassy back when it sat near Green Park. </p>
<p>“Excuse me”, called one passenger. “Are we going to get our flight or not?”</p>
<p>“It won’t go until you’ve all checked in,” replied an airport worker. </p>
<p>The average age of my queueing comrades skewed young. Most looked under 40. There were plenty of single travellers, a few couples, the occasional group of lads and a good smattering of families with children.</p>
<p>The latter group would not, I noted smugly, be sitting in my part of the cabin. I’d opted for Scoot-in-Silence, a section of seats from which under-12s are banned.</p>
<p>“We looked at a few places – Costa Rica, Mozambique. The prices for Costa Rica went up a lot, and this one came down a lot – decision made,” said Dominic.</p>
<p>“We’ve travelled a fair bit the last couple of years, we’ve worked the windows of freedom to our advantage,” added Kirsty. </p>
<p>They were happy with the budget offering of Scoot, adding that they were “chomping at the bit” to get out of the UK. The conversations I overheard on board suggested this was a common theme.</p>
<p>Wilson had told me he was proud of his “fun” crew of “wonderful extroverts”, which did briefly pique my concern that there might be school trip-style singalongs, perhaps even some plane bingo. </p>
<p>By 12.25am, two hours and 35 minutes later than scheduled, we were off the ground. </p>
<p>I’d come prepared to miss the little luxuries I savour on long-haul routes: a cellophane-wrapped blanket and fluffy socks, free tea and coffee and my own charging point (you'll only find this in ScootPlus). </p>
<p>The economy seat width (18 inches) and pitch (30-31 inches) is on par with other long-haul carriers; travellers who opt for the “stretch” seats will enjoy a pitch of 34 inches or more. As such, space didn’t feel too stingy. </p>
<p>At the very first opportunity, I requested my own reserved meal. The veggie korma with basmati rice arrived with a three pack of double chocolate lava cookies and a small bottle of water.</p>
<p>While the food left me a little disappointed, an expected upside of the budget model was getting more sleep. The lack of seatback entertainment meant no distractions, from my own screen or those flashing throughout the cabin.</p>
<p>Without the two-hour hold up that kicked off the flight, most of my niggles would’ve been averted. </p>
<header> <h1> New low-cost airline PLAY takes to the sky – with transatlantic fares from £139 </h1> <p> PLAY's first seats have gone on sale, with fares to Boston and Baltimore offered for a steal – but there's a catch </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Emma Featherstone <time> 16 December 2021 • 11:30am </time> </div> </div>
<p>“We are not getting sidetracked by omicron”, insisted Birgir Jónsson, chief executive of Icelandic start-up airline PLAY, on the eve of its big launch. Nevertheless, the timing could have been better.</p>
<p>Just as the British public have been warned to reconsider their Christmas plans, PLAY’s launch offers travellers a sliver of positivity for next spring, when, hopefully, the omicron wave will have retreated.</p>
<p>Securing a US permit is a major milestone for the company that launched in 2019. It marks the comeback of <a>budget transatlantic travel</a>, a market from which airlines such as Norwegian have had to retreat.</p>
<p>Should circumstances disrupt your trip with PLAY, it provides some contingency plans. </p>
<p>Despite being shut to most Britons right up until last month, the States could be one of the better prospects for Britons travelling in 2022. The US “seems to be quite confident,” about international travel, says Jónsson. </p>
<p>On the omicron fallout, he thinks the situation will be under more control come April. </p>
<p>“The interesting thing about these restrictions is that there seems to be some kind of sensibility coming into play,” says Jónsson. Bolting the door to travellers has shown to offer no solution to the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>“The situation in the UK makes it a tougher market, for sure,” says Jónsson. “For passengers coming into the UK, the restrictions are not helpful, but the ever-changing [nature of the] restrictions is worse.</p>
<p>“All the uncertainty creates panic.”</p>
<p>PLAY’s East Coast services are set to expand. Is New York next? </p>
<p>“New York is very likely,” says Jónsson. “We have one or two more [US routes] that we will announce in the New Year.”</p>
<p>Crucially, perhaps, with the short connection time PLAY claims an on-time arrival rate of 96 per cent. </p>
<p>“With our reliable and affordable flights, travellers can enjoy their holiday destination rather than overspending on the flight to get there,” says Jónsson.</p>

<div> <div> By Rob Crossan, Travel writer <time> 22 December 2021 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>There’s a stroppy looking father in the seat in front of me. We’re about to land but his toddler is screaming and he isn’t even attempting to put a seat belt around him.</p>
<p>My instinct, in the spirit of all cowardly British air passengers, is to roll my eyes, tut and wish the truculent man nothing but myriad future misfortunes whilst turning up the volume on my headphones.</p>
<p>But I’m no longer the passenger. I’m the flight attendant. And I have to quell this man’s anger so the pilot can bring us into land at beautiful Luton Airport.</p>
<p>“You’d be amazed at how some people react when there are problems in the air,” I’m told by Krista, an assessor at one of the open auditions for new cabin crew members that Wizz is currently holding around the UK.</p>
<p>“I did role play with one candidate when I pretended to be an irate passenger who needed the toilet while the red cabin light was on. The candidate panicked and offered me an empty bottle to pee in!”</p>
<p>Despite the effects of Covid, budget carrier Wizz is currently in aggressive expansion mode, with plans to increase its fleet of A320s from 140 to 500 by the end of the decade. </p>
<p>Could I do this at 30,000 feet to a drunk member of a stag do party who refuses to sit down as we approach Budapest? </p>
<p>The audition room is a conference suite in the Luton Airport Marriott and my first step is to fill out a simple form where I have to reveal my height, weight, passport number and, surprisingly, any tattoos and where they are on my body. </p>
<p>If you have tattoos that can’t be covered up, such as on your fingers, wrists or face, then you’re immediately sent home.</p>
<p>Asked to choose from a number of pink cards laid face down on the table, each containing a different awkward scenario, Krista’s fellow adjudicator Bartosz plays the angry father with the crying child.</p>
<p>After a nervous wait, Krista summons me and a handful of other candidates back inside to tell us we’ve been successful and we now have to do a teamwork exercise.</p>
<p>It’s hard to imagine how this test could ever be useful in a real life scenario, but Krista and Bartosz praise our efforts and put us all through to the next stage: a 45-minute talk about the realities of being a flight attendant.</p>
<p>Then I must complete a five-week training period which involves spending three days in Budapest (which Wizz does pay for) before taking exams and then, finally, going to work as a junior cabin attendant.</p>
<p>This means that, on average, a Wizz junior attendant working 12 days a month (the average working roster) earns £1,593 a month if based at Luton. Those working at Cardiff or Doncaster airports earn less.</p>
<p>“All of our flights are turnarounds,” Krista explains. “Unless something unexpected happens then you will work a route and come back to Luton that same day.”</p>
<p>I can. But I don’t think I can go any further with the Wizz Air process. The uniform doesn’t look too bad, but I don’t think I have the energy for the 6am flight to Tuzla. </p>
<p>But one thing is for sure. Next time I see an exhausted looking flight attendant yawning or looking slightly less than their beaming best, I’m going to feel deep and lasting sympathy.</p>
<p>No matter how horrible my journey might be. I’m not the one who has to turn around the same day, head back to Luton and strap a seat belt around a screaming child along the way.</p>
<p>Wizz Air is holding more open days in early 2022. Go to wizzair.com/careers for details.</p>
