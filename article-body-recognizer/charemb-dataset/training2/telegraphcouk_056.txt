<header> <h1> London’s hottest restaurants have a table shortage – and here's how to game the system </h1> <p> If you want to get into a ‘booked up’ restaurant this December, take these tips </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Ben McCormack <time> 25 November 2021 • 5:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The run-up to Christmas is never the easiest time of year to secure a table at London’s hottest restaurants but a covid hangover has left reservations even harder to come by this December. </p>
<p>Diners desperate to reignite their restaurant habit have released a pent-up demand for eating out while the shortage of hospitality staff has led to reduced opening hours and fewer tables. </p>
<p>When Langan’s, the Mayfair brasserie formerly co-owned by Sir Michael Caine, re-launched in October, 10,000 bookings were taken for the first fortnight. </p>
<a>Hutong</a>, the Chinese restaurant halfway up The Shard, opens reservations three months ahead, with weekend tables booked up immediately. At
<a>three-Michelin-starred Core by Clare Smyth</a>, bookings become available 91 days in advance and tables sell out 10 minutes after midnight each day.
<a>Three-star Sketch</a>, meanwhile, is fully booked three weeks in advance and has a waiting list of 10 parties for its 18 tables.

<a>American Express’ Platinum Card</a>. Membership costs £575 a year and customers also have access to reservations at the likes of

<a>chef-led experiences</a>. 
<a>Quintessentially</a>, the concierge service where annual membership starts at £5,000. Benefits include being front of the queue for last-minute tables, bespoke experiences such as virtual masterclasses with the likes of two-Michelin-starred chef
<a>Andrew Wong</a> and, most temptingly, pre-access reservations before the general public at high-profile new openings. 
<p>Building up that sort of relationship takes months, if not years, which may be no help this December, but once established will be a gift that keeps giving. Afterall, a good restaurant isn’t just for Christmas, it’s for life. </p>

<a>Robert Mapplethorpe</a>, to name but a few. And the photographs on the wall are not by Leibovitz. ‘I don’t hang my photo- graphs in my house.’ 
<p>Leibovitz shows me her new book, Wonderland, an anthology of her fashion images. ‘So here we are,’ she sighs with mock grumpiness, ‘on the occasion of the book I didn’t want to do.’</p>
<a>Karl Lagerfeld</a> towards the end of his life, at home in his cluttered Parisian apartment, wearing a nightshirt instead of his usual armour of sunglasses, black suit and powdered hair. 
<p>‘It was upsetting, actually,’ says Leibovitz today. ‘He obviously didn’t let anyone up there.’</p>
<p>Although Leibovitz did not photograph Taylor unvarnished, it gave her a new insight into the actress. ‘It was a fascinating session. Although the pictures were not very good.’</p>
<p>Her stories often end like this, criticising her own work. In her book she quotes Cate Blanchett telling her, ‘You are never satisfied, are you?’ ‘That haunted me because she is most likely right,’ says Leibovitz.</p>
<p>‘I’ve always loved intelligence... I have intelligence visually, but I didn’t go to good schools. It’s a self-taught thing’</p>
<p>Wonderland by Annie Leibovitz is out now (Phaidon, £69.95). Order your copy from the <a>Telegraph Bookshop</a>. </p>

<sup>st</sup> birthday and now leads a charmed life in the Cotswolds.
<p>The average wait to buy a similar Audi is around eight months. However, we managed to borrow one in a bid to understand why the RS gets the Royal endorsement.</p>
<p>Audi has unveiled a whole range of e-tron, all-electric SUVs over the last 12 months but the GT RS is the only version fit for a future king. Instead of bulbous, everyday SUV styling, this car is a sleek grand tourer that truly looks the part.</p>
<p>That could have something to do with the platform on which the RS is based. It shares the same underpinnings as the brilliant Porsche Taycan – perhaps the ultimate driving machine over a long distance.</p>
<p>Even Audi’s latest infotainment system is cutting edge stuff, with the addition of a Virtual Cockpit display offering sharp graphics and simple functionality.</p>
<p>Early adopters of battery technology who own a Tesla Model S will find the Audi equally engaging to drive – especially on a winding country road from London to dad’s country estate in Gloucestershire. </p>
<p>Should you buy one? Yes, if the waiting list isn’t a problem. The Taycan and Model S are worthy contenders too – but they don’t come with a royal seal of approval.</p>
