<header> <h1>John Lennon 'suffered bulimia' </h1> <p>John Lennon suffered from bulimia and food fetishes, according to a new book.</p> </header>
<div> <div> <span> By Paul Thompson </span> <time> 06 March 2012 • 3:48pm </time> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The former Beatle showed all the signs of the eating disorder but because he was never diagnosed with the disease went untreated in his years of fame. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>At the height of Beatlemania the singer's weight fluctuated wildly. But when he was shot dead in 1980 outside his New York apartment he had lost a huge amount of weight. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Author Debra Sharon Davis claims in her book "BackStage Pass VIP" that Lennon suffered from food fetishes and loved bowls of Rice Crispies topped with ice cream. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>She said the singer kept bowls of snacks hidden away at his various homes and "fantasised" about foods. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Davis claims Lennon was always hungry, loved to eat but "hated the feeling of being full" so he would often force himself to vomit after eating. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"Lennon was confused about his obsession with food," said Davis. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"Lennon was surrounded by talented musicians, but many had drinking and drug problems – so it was hard for them to see Lennon's purging behaviour as extraordinary. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The book, which looks at the private lives of rocks stars from the 1960s and 1970s, includes an interview with the singer Harry Nilsson who said he noticed Lennon had a problem with food. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>"John and I were having a heart-to-heart," recalled Nilsson prior to his death in 1994. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <p>"Then all of a sudden John went off about how powerful men had ravenous appetites and wanted to swallow the world whole. And he thought that was why he had this horrible problem – being hungry all the time and overeating."</p> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Overeating, or bingeing, is a symptom of bulimia, a disease that affects mostly women. Princess Diana admitted she suffered from bulimia brought on from the stress of her unhappy marriage. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The book also reveals that Mick Jagger was a closet conservative who asked his wife to wear a bra under her see through top to avoid embarrassing his mother. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The book's author spent weeks travelling with the Rolling Stones during the 1980s, interviewing Mick Jagger's friends and fans to get a detailed insight into his life. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>She claims he was a closet conservative who asked his wife to wear a bra under her see through top to avoid embarrassing his mother. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The Rolling Stone also liked to have his eggs served soft boiled in a Wedgwood cup. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Davis said the singer would bring his parents flowers during visits and on one occasion asked his then wife Bianca to wear a bra when his mother made a surprise visit. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>She writes:"Bianca refused, stormed out and Jagger was left to nervously fix a tray of tea and spread a bunch of pastries on a doily to cater to his mum."</p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>The book also contains details of the legendary meanness of Jagger and includes an anecdote of how he once checked on the price of pencil sharpeners used in the Stones’ office. </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <p>Davis, who runs the LA based Davis Communications Group, is a marketing and communications strategist who specialises in advising clients,including Fortune 500 companies, on pop culture. </p> </div> </div>
<header> <h1> Inside Chanel Metiers d'Art show staged in Hamburg's spectacular new concert hall </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Sasha Slater <time> 16 December 2017 • 7:00am </time> </div> </div>
<a>Coco Chanel </a>spent her final years living in the hotel. 
<a>Elbphilharmonie</a> – a brand new Herzog and de Meuron concert hall and apartment block that stands on the water like a cross between a sailing ship and an iceberg.
<p>It is a stunning place with slow, curving escalators that carried a glittering crowd up to the concert hall at the heart of the building where the show took place.</p>
<div> <p>But the clothes themselves – reminiscent of Coco Chanel’s own flirtation with matelot stripes and sailors’ overalls – were classic naval luxe, with thick knitted navy jumpers and officers’ insignia.</p> </div>
<p>Some handbags were shaped like accordions and the male models accessorised with pipes. They harked back to the Hamburg of the past – rich and elegant, but not ostentatious.</p>
<p>‘This isn’t a red-carpet city,’ the designer told me after the show. ‘It’s always kind of discreet… powerful though.’ </p>
<p>Never has the usually matter-of-fact Lagerfeld sounded more elegiac.</p>
<header> <h1> The worst holiday of my life, featuring salmonella and a brush with the law </h1> <p> Continuing our series on awful overseas adventures, here's our latest tale regarding a disastrous cycling trip across Cuba </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Greg Dickinson, Senior Travel Writer <time> 5 January 2022 • 10:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>When my mum waved farewell to her youngest son at Heathrow Airport in 2009, as he set off to Havana for a five-week cycling trip with three friends, I am sure the usual worries went through her mind.</p>
<p>The worries manifested as a hug, and off I went. Neither of us knew that all of these worst case scenarios would come to fruition.</p>
<p>“Do not attempt to cycle across Cuba from the west to the east. The prevailing headwind will make it a misery.” </p>
<p>“I think maybe he’s saying we were supposed to have stopped at the junction?” One of us said. </p>
<p>“No I think he’s saying we should have indicated to turn right?”</p>
<p>“But the road’s empty, for fluff’s sake.” I paraphrase.</p>
<p>“Shall we just…” Our eyes turned to our bikes, and with a “lo siento” we picked up our vehicles and pedalled fast into the distance with the fist-wagging, whistle-blowing officer left in our wake. </p>

<header> <h1> Six New Year's resolutions for the Government to save our holidays </h1> <p> From fixing a passport loophole to ditching draconian Covid rules – these simple promises would save travel in 2022 </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Greg Dickinson, Senior Travel Writer <time> 31 December 2021 • 1:23pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>For the second year in a row, the festive headlines have focused on travel chaos related to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Aside from their clear inefficiency in curbing the spread of Covid-19, and the distress they have caused individuals, the constant reintroduction of travel measures has damaged the travel and tourism sector perhaps more so than any other.</p>
<p>So when our dear leaders emerge from their cheese and wine hangovers tomorrow morning, let us hope that they consider some of the below resolutions to save our holidays in 2022.</p>
<h2>Never resort to ‘travel bans’ again</h2>
<p>While the red list currently contains no countries, it still exists and <a>could feasibly be brought into effect at any moment</a>, as it is – in Grant Shapps’ words – “the UK’s first line of defence”. </p>
<h2>Remove all tests for travel</h2>
<p>Paul Charles, travel expert and CEO of PC Agency, hopes that pre-departure and Day 2 PCR tests could be scrapped in next week’s travel review.</p>
<h2>Reimburse hotel quarantine victims</h2>
<h2>Stop disproportionately punishing unvaccinated people</h2>
<h2>Make rail travel more enticing</h2>
<p>If the Government wants to make domestic travel more appealing, and is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to meet COP26 goals, then a good starting point would be to make UK rail travel more affordable. </p>
<p>The Government might also, rather than raise the already high tax burden placed upon air travellers, incentivise Britons to visit Europe by train rather than plane. </p>
<h2>Fix passport expiry grey areas</h2>
<p>Since Brexit, many Telegraph readers have been in touch to let us know they have been denied entry into the EU <a>due to a passport grey area</a>.</p>

<header> <h1> Why masks could be on planes forever </h1> <p> Just like the 100ml liquids rule and other security rituals, the mask directive feels more like theatre than a proven safety measure </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Oliver Smith, Digital Travel Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 2:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>It’s that time of year when overconfident journalists make predictions. So here’s mine. Masks will remain a requirement for flying, not just for the rest of 2022, but for many years to come – and maybe even forever. </p>
<p>Nevertheless – and <a>despite the arrival of new 3D scanners in 2019</a> that were tipped to make the rule redundant – the 100ml limit remains in place. </p>
<p>US pilot and author Patrick Smith has previously suggested trimming the safety briefings to no more than 90 seconds of the most important information. “Hit the bullet points and be done with it,” he said. </p>
<a>The brace position is another head-scratcher</a>. Not only does its usefulness appear debatable when a plane is heading towards the ground at 600 miles per hour, but have you ever actually tried to adopt the position in a modern economy class seat?
<p>“Aircraft electronics are designed and shielded with interference in mind. This should mitigate any ill effects, and to date there are no proven cases of a phone adversely affecting the outcome of a flight. But you never know.”</p>

<div> <div> <div> Comment </div> <h1> The unfair demonisation of cruises flies in the face of reason </h1> <p> Americans have been warned not to sail as the cruise industry is cast as the evil villain of the Covid pandemic once again </p> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Sara Macefield <time> 4 January 2022 • 11:41am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Cruise case rates are significantly lower than those reported on land and the stringent raft of tests and protocols that cruise companies employ have made their ships some of the safest places to be since cruising resumed.</p>
<p>The CDC ruling – and its decision to place cruises on the highest Level 4 alert footing – was prompted by a spate of Covid outbreaks on cruise ships in the run-up to Christmas that saw some vessels turned away from Caribbean ports.</p>
<p>Yes, case numbers had jumped significantly as the omicron variant rampaged across the world, with the CDC reporting that between December 15-29, Covid cases submitted by cruise ships in US waters reached 5,013.</p>
<p>The authority currently lists 110 ships sailing in US waters, with nearly all of them under investigation. </p>
<p>In the face of such totals, America’s health officials are clearly running scared, but this latest salvo against cruising seems as disproportionate as it is unfair and has a depressing ring of déjà vu. </p>
<p>Even with New York’s record-breaking infection levels, thousands of revellers were still allowed to pack into Times Square for the annual Ball Drop celebrations on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>Talk about one rule for cruise companies and a different rule for everyone else.</p>
<p>Clearly, no one wants to return to those dark early days of the pandemic when Covid-19 swept through some cruise ships in highly publicised outbreaks, but that was nearly two years ago and much has changed in the interim.</p>
<p>Since then the industry has worked with the CDC and health bodies across the world to draw up a rigorous programme of testing and preventative measures that has gone above and beyond what is required.</p>
<p>In nearly all cases, you can’t even step aboard a cruise ship without having been double-vaccinated, showing proof of a negative Covid test and being tested again on the dockside.</p>
<p>Once aboard, further tests and temperature checks regularly follow and passengers are required to social distance and wear masks in public areas. Anyone testing positive is swiftly quarantined in designated areas.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that many of those who have cruised – myself included – feel safer on ships than in their own communities and their enthusiasm to get back on board has fuelled a wave of demand with strong forward bookings. </p>
<p>Do all these rigorous safeguards count for nothing? Apparently so, as cruising still appears to be seen as an easy target and at the first hint of Covid outbreaks, it didn’t take long for predictable “petri dish” barbs to surface.</p>
<p>This time they were fired by US senator Richard Blumenthal who took to Twitter to call on the CDC and cruise companies to pause sailings, adding: “Cruises are repeating recent history as petri dishes of Covid infection.”</p>
<p>His comments sparked a mixed reaction, with some respondents backing his viewpoint, though the majority accused him of targeting cruising, pointing to its low case rate when compared to other market sectors.</p>
<p>In response to the CDC’s latest shot across the bows, Cruise Lines International Association (Clia), which represents the major cruise companies, did not attempt to hide its frustration, admitting it was perplexed.</p>
<p>While pointing out that shipboard cases consistently made up a “very slim minority” of passengers and crew, Clia stressed that numbers accounted for up to a third fewer than on land.</p>
<p>“The majority of those cases are asymptomatic or mild in nature, posing little or no burden on medical resources on board or on shore,” a statement from the association said. </p>
<p>The CDC and Clia accept that cruise ships cannot escape Covid, particularly the omicron variant. Nothing can. Yet it seems this industry has, once more, become the convenient fall guy, while others charge ahead unchecked, untested and unabated.</p>
<p>Do you think the cruise sector is being unfairly demonised or is the CDC right to warn against cruise holidays? Let us know in the comments section below.</p>

<header> <h1> The last places on Earth still closed to tourists (even the vaccinated) </h1> <p> Last week India and Cambodia reopened to vaccinated travellers while others tightened restrictions. Some, though, remain entirely off-limits </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Oliver Smith, Digital Travel Editor <time> 26 November 2021 • 12:49pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Last week, for example, Qatar added the UK to its red list, meaning you’ll now need to take two PCR tests and spend two days in hotel quarantine if you wish to visit.</p>
<p>The UK is at it, too. On November 26, the UK placed six countries including South Africa on its red list amid concerns of the 'Nu' variant in South Africa. </p>
<p>Here is a look at the countries that remain closed to all of us (or have restrictions that make holidays prohibitive). They include the following:</p>
<p>More freedom has been granted for (vaccinated) Australian residents to come and go, but the country’s borders remain closed to foreign travellers. </p>
<p>The Australian government has said it is “working towards welcoming tourists back to our shores”, but no timetable has been issued.</p>
<p>New Zealand has been closed off to the world since March 2020,<a> although this is about to change</a>.</p>
<p>Arrivals will still have to endure a week-long self isolation, but they will no longer need to enter a managed isolation facility.</p>
<a>shut down after a woman who had visited tested positive.</a> All 34,000 people inside the park at the time were prevented from leaving until they had tested negative – a process that took two days. 
<p>Domestic and foreign business groups in Japan <a>have lobbied</a> the country’s government to ease border restrictions in line with other countries, so far to no avail.</p>
<p>Vietnam’s tight restrictions have dealt a blow to its burgeoning tourism sector, which accounts for about 10 per cent of GDP.</p>
<p>It is possible, however, to transit at Hong Kong International Airport.</p>
<p>Like Bhutan, Laos is an already isolated and little-visited Asian country that chose yet more isolation. It has been closed for 20 months, and is still to set a firm date for the resumption of travel. However, early 2022 looks possible. </p>
<p>Non-essential travellers and non-residents have been barred from entering Malaysia throughout the pandemic, but the country’s strict rules are being slowly eased. </p>
<p>By January 1 authorities hope to reopen the rest of the country to international visitors. </p>
<p>The vast steppes of Mongolia remain out of the reach of ordinary travellers, and there is still no word on when that situation might change. </p>
<p>Like China, Taiwan continues to show very little tolerance of Covid. It shut its borders early, they remain closed to ordinary tourists, and those that are permitted to visit must complete a long quarantine. </p>
<p>There is one exception, however. Taiwan has a curious travel bubble with the tiny Pacific island of Palau. Needless to say this hasn’t been enough to make up for the shortfall from international tourism. </p>
<p>Taiwan’s vaccine roll-out has been slower than other countries in the region. As of early November, 74 per cent of Taiwanese had received at least one shot of Covid-19 vaccine, and 30 per cent had received two. </p>
<p>Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said: “We will be discussing opening borders only when over 70 per cent of the population have received (at least) one dose and 60 per cent have had both shots.”</p>

<h2>What is ‘Proof of Recovery’ certification?</h2>
<h2>Where can I get a ‘Proof of Recovery’ document?</h2>
<h2>How do I show my proof of recovery for travel?</h2>
<p>As with proving your vaccination status, it is wise to carry both a digital and print copy of your proof of recovery when you travel. </p>
<h2>Which countries accept proof of recovery instead of a negative test?</h2>
<h2>How to get proof of recovery via the NHS app?</h2>
<p>In the same way that you access your NHS Covid Pass (ie proof of vaccination) via the NHS app, you can access proof of your recovery from Covid. </p>
<h2>Why is proof of recovery so useful for travel?</h2>
<a>affects up to a third of people</a>, and can cause real issues in destinations that require a PCR test to enter – so a Proof of Recovery document will help to lessen this risk. In Barbados, for example, arrivals are advised to
<a>carry proof of their diagnosis and recovery</a>, in case of a false-positive test result. 
<h1> You’ll need a Covid booster vaccine to travel abroad, warns Boris Johnson </h1>
<p> Prime Minister says travel requirement likely to become ‘the norm’ very soon and urges millions who are eligible to get their jabs </p>
<div> <div> By Laura Donnelly, Health Editor <time> 4 January 2022 • 9:05pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Booster vaccines are likely to be needed for travel to many countries within weeks, Boris Johnson warned as he urged people to come forward for a third jab.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said the travel requirement was likely to become "the norm" very soon, adding that it would be "very much to people's advantage" to take up the jabs.</p>
<a>set to be needed for vaccine passports in England</a> after everyone has been offered a third vaccine. That milestone
<a>has now been reached</a> – but more than nine million eligible people have yet to take up the offer.
<p>On Tuesday night, Mr Johnson said the Government would "give people plenty of time" before requiring a third jab for vaccine passports and urged millions to come forward.</p>
<p>Ministers are concerned about <a>poor take-up of boosters</a>, with uptake peaking in mid-December. The latest figures show that only one in three available slots for the next week have been booked.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said it was "heartbreaking" that people were dying from Covid because <a>they had not been vaccinated</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who has had Covid must wait 28 days before being able to have a booster.</p>
<p>Mr Johnson said people were dying "needlessly" because they have not been properly vaccinated against Covid, <a>telling a Downing Street news conference</a>: "There are still almost nine million people eligible who haven't had their booster.</p>
<p>"It's absolutely heartbreaking that as many as 90 per cent of those in intensive care with Covid have not had their booster, and over 60 per cent <a>of those in intensive care</a>, who have Covid, have not had any vaccination at all.</p>
<a>Prof Sir Chris Whitty</a> urged anyone who had not yet received a booster to come forward.
<h1> U-turns, bridges and corridors: a two-year timeline of Britain’s chaotic travel rules </h1>
<p> Spare a thought for both travellers and holiday companies who have had to navigate this two-year labyrinth of ever-changing rules </p>
<div> <div> By Emma Beaumont, Assistant Content Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 5:16pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>We have adapted to many things during the pandemic, but 2022 presents an opportunity to take a different approach to travel. One that doesn’t dampen demand or add hundreds of pounds to the cost of a holiday. </p>
<p>Here we look at the various hoops travellers have had to jump through, from traffic lights to testing rules and desperate dashes home. Buckle up, it’s going to be a bumpy ride. </p>
<h2>The age of air bridges </h2>
<p>The initial list, released on July 3, contained a decent 73 countries and territories, including holiday favourites such as France, Italy, Spain and Greece. The US and Portugal however, were notably absent. </p>
<p>The criteria for making the list was said to be a tiny seven-day rate of 20 Covid cases per 100,000 residents. Creep above this figure you could well be struck off. For a little context, the UK’s current Covid rate is 1,893 per 100,000. </p>
<p>So summer holidays abroad in 2020 came with a significant degree of risk, but with the UK yet to introduce tests for travel (and no vaccination rules), it’s worth noting they were relatively hassle-free. </p>
<p>Still, by the end of the summer, the list had been decimated. Greece was divided with certain islands having their corridor revoked while others remained in place and the overall outlook seemed uncertain.</p>
<h2>Lockdown Two, and a loophole of sorts </h2>
<p>And those who took the plunge may have been thankful they exploited the loophole of sorts. By January, and Lockdown Three, foreign travel was once again banned.</p>
<h2>Hello hotel quarantine</h2>
<p>The first few months of 2021 saw no holidays but the introduction of hotel quarantine, the most controversial travel policy of the pandemic. </p>
<a>food, which has been uniformly blasted by guests and general shabby conditions</a>.
<p>Britain remains one of the few countries in the world to introduce the draconian policy – Transport Secretary Grant Shapps previously described the scheme as "as the UK’s first line of defence".</p>
<a>one-day honeymoons in Mexico</a> and
<a>pilots flying planes from Montenegro at top speeds to beat the quarantine cut-off</a>, as destinations were dumped on the red list. 
<p>Later on, amber list travellers were allowed to be released from quarantine after a more manageable five days under the Test to Release initiative, pending a negative test result. </p>
<h2>Vaccination vacation </h2>
<p>As summer went on and with much of the UK population double-jabbed, it was announced that the fully vaccinated would no longer have to quarantine when returning from amber list countries from July 19, which meaningfully opened up overseas travel.</p>
<p>While the policy only lasted for two weeks (until August 8), it was a tense chapter in the fraught Anglo-Franco Covid relations, which frankly deserves its own timeline. The latest saga continues as British tourists remain banned from France. </p>
<h2>Simplifying the system</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this relative sanity was not to last. With the emergence of the omicron variant, the red list was revived at the end of November with South Africa and 10 other African countries subject to hotel quarantine restrictions. </p>
<p>Travel tests were also amped up with the pre-departure tests required once again. Day 2 PCR tests were brought back with the unwelcome addition of having to self-isolate until you received a negative result. </p>
<p>However, with omicron spreading at phenomenal rates, the red list was declared redundant and emptied once again on December 14. Still, travel remains on shaky footing with other countries persisting with tighter border rules.</p>
<h2>What’s next? </h2>
<a>Day 2 PCR tests</a> set to be scrapped (in favour of lateral flow tests). We’re back to the pre-omicron state of affairs.

<header> <h1> The latest travel announcement is the best news we could have hoped for </h1> <p> If you've been waiting to book your 2022 holiday, news that both the pre-departure test and Day 2 PCR are being dropped are a huge relief </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Nick Trend, Chief Consumer and Culture Editor <time> 5 January 2022 • 4:01pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Today’s decision to end the need for fully-vaccinated travellers to show evidence of a negative lateral flow pre-departure test taken within 48 hours of returning to England is a vital boost to holidaymakers and the travel industry. </p>
<header> <h1> The best fans, tried and tested </h1> <p> A good fan will keep you cool all summer long. Here are our favourite models based on efficiency, design and value for money </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Abigail Buchanan <time> 25 August 2021 • 6:01pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>It may not be the most exciting of purchases, but a good fan will make soaring summer temperatures much more bearable. </p>
<p>The main types of fans are: </p>
<li>Tower fans are tall and slim (as the name suggests), which makes them a good choice for slotting in narrow spaces.</li>
<li>Floor fans are similar to pedestal fans, but instead of sitting on top of a stand, they consist of a bladed unit that sits on the floor. They usually cover larger rooms, as most are between 16 and 24 inches.</li>
<a>Aircon Centre</a>, a specialist retailer for fans, air conditioning units and dehumidifiers. 
<p>You should also consider who is living in your home. Tower fans or bladeless designs are safer in a home with young children or pets as they don’t pose a risk to small hands (or paws).</p>
<p>Finally, many fans aren’t exactly stylish – so the way your chosen fan looks is a consideration if it will be on show in your living room.</p>
<p><a>£499.99, Argos</a></p>
<p>It will probably come as no surprise to see Dyson’s purifying fan at the top of this list. Its elegant design and powerful (but whisper quiet) fan mean it’s truly a cut above the rest and has won a permanent place in my flat. </p>
<p>If you want a smaller fan, the Dyson PureCool Me desk fan (<a>£299.99, Dyson</a>) is also worth considering.</p>
<h3>2. MeacoFan 1056P Air Circulator Pedestal Fan</h3>
<p><a>£139.99, Amazon</a> </p>
<a>£57.95, Aircon Centre</a>). Its compact design suits a smaller desk or bedside table, but it still feels powerful enough to cool you down efficiently. 
<p>The MeacoFan 1056P narrowly misses out on the top spot on this list because the Dyson offers a wider range of features (including air purification) – but, on the other hand, this model is significantly more affordable. </p>
<h3>3. Devola 12" DC Pedestal Air Circulator Fan</h3>
<p><a>£98.95, Aircon Centre</a></p>
<h3>4. Duux Whisper Flex Smart Wireless Fan</h3>
<p><a>£143.85, Amazon</a></p>
<p>This stylish pedestal fan has a lot going for it, and is the ‘smartest’ on this list. I love the matte black finish, although it also comes in a traditional glossy white (<a>£148.99, Ebay</a>). </p>
<h3>5. electriQ eiQ-AM07 24 inch Bladeless Quiet Tower Fan</h3>
<p><a>£89.97, Appliances Direct</a></p>
<header> <h1> The best portable air conditioners to keep you cool this summer </h1> <p> While this season hasn't exactly been a scorcher, more hot weather is on its way – it may be worth investing in a portable air conditioner </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 25 August 2021 • 6:16pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>For this reason, they have a more powerful cooling effect and are a worthy investment for those who dread a heatwave year after year. Most models also dehumidify the air as they cool it. </p>
<h3>1. De'Longhi Pinguino PAC EL98 ECO Silent Portable Air Conditioner</h3>
<p><a>£699.99, Aircon Centre</a></p>
<h3>2. De'Longhi PAC AN112 Silent Air Conditioner</h3>
<p><a>£749.99, Aircon Centre</a></p>
<h3>3. Midea 7000 BTU Portable Air Conditioning Unit</h3>
<p><a>£348.95, Aircon Centre</a></p>
<p>At 63db, it is louder than the De’Longhi model above, but it’s significantly cheaper. Plus, as it’s rated A for energy efficiency, it still won’t add unduly to your electricity bill.</p>
<h3>4. De'Longhi Pinguino PAC N82 ECO Portable Air Conditioner</h3>
<p><a>£507.99, Amazon</a></p>
<h3>5. electriQ EcoSilent Portable Air Conditioner</h3>
<p><a>£374.97, eBay</a></p>
<h3>6. Amcor SF8000E Portable Air Conditioner</h3>
<p><a>£249.97, Appliances Direct</a></p>
<h3>7. AirFlex 14000 BTU 4kW Portable Air Conditioner </h3>
<p><a>£549.98, Appliances Direct</a></p>
<h3>8. AEG ChillFlex Pro AXP34U338CW Portable Air Conditioner</h3>
<p><a>£299.99 refurbished, Ebay</a></p>
<p>This particular model is ideal for anyone who struggles to get a good night's sleep. It automatically adjusts to your set temperature while removing moisture.</p>
<p>There is a remote control, programmable timer and sleep mode, where the machine gradually powers down throughout the night to save energy. </p>
<h3>How long should a portable air conditioner last?</h3>
<p>The durability of the machine depends on the model and how well you look after it. However, according to Kandola, they can last a long time. “If you buy a good quality unit and you look after it, it should last you up to five years.”</p>
<h3>How much does a portable air conditioner cost?</h3>
<p>Portable air conditioners can cost anything from £300 to over £700. Despite such varying prices, some experts say that most portable models are quite similar, but branded differently.</p>
<h3>What type of air conditioner should I buy?</h3>
<p>Once you start to browse online for a portable air conditioner, you notice there are three main types: exhaust pipe (or “ducted”) conditioners, split air conditioners and evaporative coolers. </p>
<h3>How to look after your portable air conditioner</h3>
<p>When air conditioners cool down a room, they typically produce water, which is collected inside the machine in a bucket. To ensure the longevity of the product, you need to empty this bucket every few weeks.</p>

<header> <h1> The best double prams and buggies, according to parents </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Madeleine Howell <time> 4 July 2019 • 1:18pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Much depends on whether you want to go for a twin (side by side) or a tandem buggy (one on top of the other).</p>
<p>Some double buggies are also all-in-one travel systems, which means the carrycot can be inserted into the ISOFIX fittings in your car or fitted with a seatbelt to be converted into a car seat.</p>
<ul> <li>See also: Telegraph Recommended's reviews of the best high chairs and <a>best prams</a> on the market</li> </ul>

<p>The Bugaboo Donkey Classic+ complete Duo is suitable for use from birth. It takes a maximum weight of 15kg, and with the duo extension it is 74cm wide.</p>
<a>Eimear Varian Barry</a>. "There is lots of space underneath. It's easy to fold up and down, and very easy to push as it's super light. You also can easily make it into a single pushchair."
<a>£59.95, Mothercare</a>).
<a> Bugaboo Donkey2 pram and pushchair</a> is even pricier, at
<a>£1,430 from Mothercare</a>). Luckily, there are cheaper options (see below). 
<p>Weight: 17.4kg compared to 14.2kg as a single, </p>
<p>Dimensions: L55 x W52 x H99</p>
<p>Facing position: Forward</p>
<p>Collapsible: One-hand folding system</p>
<a>sold separately, £30</a>) and upright buggy seats for when they get older.
<p>The seats can face the parent or face out, and the Peach is compatible with a number of car seats including the excellent Maxi-Cosi Pebble (<a>£129.95, John Lewis</a>).</p>
<h3>Phil Teds Sport double pushchair</h3>
<p><b>Weight: </b> 12.5kg</p>
<p><b>Dimensions:</b> H101 x W59 x L101cm</p>

<div> <div> <p>The Phil + Teds Sport tandem pushchair is just 59cm wide. It weighs 12.5kg, and is suitable from birth up to age five.</p> </div> </div>
<a>The London Dad</a>. "We took this buggy to South East Asia and it took everything we threw at it, including beaches, potholes, and 13 plane rides in the hold. We always managed to get our two children asleep inside 30 minutes of walking."
<p>With an auto stop braking system, the Phil + Ted sport is both safe and convenient. It offers 26 riding configurations and the option to accommodate one or two newborn babies. </p>
<div> <blockquote><div> <p>A post shared by philteds (@philandteds) on <time>Jul 20, 2016 at 2:49pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> </div>
<p>"It has an all round adaptable system to grow with your family, wheels that work on all terrains and also a useful one-handed fold feature that makes juggling two little ones when out and about that little bit easier.</p>
<p>"The downside is that you need to buy the various accessories separately and that’s when it starts to get more costly, especially if you have already shelled out on a single pram already."</p>
<p>Dimensions: H107 x L102 x W63</p>
<p><a>£599, John Lewis</a></p>
<p>"This buggy has a good amount of storage beneath the two seats," says father-of-two and A Place in the Sun presenter Ben Hillman. "When your children are just a little older, it's lovely for them to be able to sit side by side."</p>
<p>It's suitable from birth up to four years; it would work for either newborn twins, a baby and a toddler or two toddlers from up to four years old. </p>

<p>Then, of course, there's the multimedia gadget pocket: "Cosatto say you can put things like flash cards or photos in the pocket but we all know it’s an iPad pocket." A lifesaver in airports and long queues. </p>
<h3>What else do you need to know about buying a double pram or pushchair?</h3>
<p>The NHS advises that before buying a pram or buggy you check the brakes are working, ensure the frame is sturdy and that the handles are at the right height for pushing. </p>

<header> <h1> The best kids smart watch for parents to buy </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Jack Rear <time> 1 May 2020 • 1:01pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Here's what I found while testing and reviewing a range of the best kids smart watches for parents to buy, starting with my favourites...</p>
<p>Why we like it: It's basically a phone on your kid's wrist – in a good way</p>
<p><a>£99.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>This pleasant-looking, waterproof watch includes a camera, a pedometer, an alarm clock and a stopwatch. But what really elevates it among the crowd is the fact that it can send and make calls directly. </p>
<p>The call quality is actually really good; the watch has a crystal clear microphone and speaker. There's no headphone jack, so conversations can't really be conducted privately – which may be for the best, depending on your point of view.</p>
<p>Thanks to a collaboration with Sony, kids can even link the XPLORA GO up with their PlayStation and win in-game rewards for achieving fitness goals, which is a cute and interesting way to encourage them to get active. </p>
<p>Still, for the child who isn't old enough for a smartphone but is old enough to want one, this is the perfect mid-point which should help settle those arguments (for a little while, at least.)</p>
<p>You can also get the <a>XPLORA 3S</a> which is slightly more expensive but does come with better waterproofing, but is otherwise the same in all ways. Go with the GO!</p>
<p>Why we like it: A solid kid-tracker</p>
<p>Less of a smartwatch and more of a tracker, Gator Watch might not be the ‘smartest’ of smartwatches in the modern sense, but that’s not to say that it isn’t a really solid bit of tech. </p>
<p>The device itself looks fairly spartan, there’s no touch screen or in-built games or any distractions. This is a watch, first and foremost, with a nice soft rubbery strap which reminded me of the old Casio watches I wore as a kid. </p>
<p>None of this is especially convoluted or difficult, it just involves some fiddling around sorting through your emails, waiting for confirmation codes, etc.</p>
<p>Overall, while there are a few edges that could be improved upon in a future update, the Gator Watch is a really solid piece of gadgetry for parents who want to keep an eye on their little ones.</p>
<h3>3. Garmin Vívofit Jr 2</h3>
<p>Why we like it: Makes exercise fun for kids and offers a cute way for parents to incentivise chores</p>
<p><a>£79.99, Currys</a></p>
<a>debate around the idea of fitness tracking for children</a>. Worrying about hitting exercise goals and calorie counting are adult concerns, loaded with implicit connotations about body image. Not something we should be subjecting kids to.
<p>It’s fun way to introduce your children to the concept of capitalism while encouraging them to help out around the home. And since you set the rewards and their prices, so families of all different means will be able to enjoy the feature.</p>
<p>Overall, I found the Garmin Vívofit Jr. 2 a very charming product that knows exactly where the line is between incentivising the kids and keeping it fun.</p>
<p>Why we like it: An unashamed fun-machine</p>
<p><a>£34.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Kidizoom DX2 is probably the most toy-like of all the kiddie gadgets I tested out – which is to say that it's good for games, selfies, a few other tricks, and not practical stuff like making calls or tracking whereabouts. </p>
<p>Still, at such a bargain price, this one gives a lot of bang for your buck. Even if your little one grows out of it eventually, it’s not like you paid a fortune for it in the first place.</p>
<h3>5. Vodafone V-Kids watch</h3>
<p>Why we like it: It’s a nice watch that’s got the right amount of functionality for a little one</p>
<p><a>£124.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>Helicopter parenting alert! That’s what this device should scream whenever you strap it to your kid’s wrist, because it's main focus seems to be keeping tabs on your child at all times.</p>
<p>You’ve also got to pay £4 per month for the tracking service which seems steep to me.</p>
<p><a>£46.99, Argos</a></p>
<p>The first thing you’ll encounter with the Fitbit Ace is the amazingly convoluted set up process. You need to set up an adult account, then add a child’s account, then sync the band to the app – it’s an ordeal.</p>

<header> <h1> The best tablets for kids </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Matthew Field ; Jack Rear and Tomé Morrissy-Swan <time> 14 May 2020 • 11:33am </time> </div> </div>
<p>That said, it's worth considering something age specific, which can come pre-loaded with appropriate games and educational tools.</p>
<p>Below, we take a look at the best tablets for kids currently on the market. </p>
<h3>1. Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids edition 8 inch display </h3>
<p><a>£99.99, Amazon</a></p>
<p>The device arrives loaded with child-friendly apps and books, like Paw Patrol and Harry Potter, while you can give your child access to a library linked to your own Netflix account. </p>
<p>One downside is that the tablet doesn't give you access to App Store or Google Play, so you have to make do with Amazon's version – there are, however, plenty of options. </p>
<ul><li>Also available is the <a>Fire 7 Kids Edition with a 7-inch display (£79.99).</a></li></ul>
<h3>2. Apple iPad 2019 9.7 inch</h3>
<p><a>£399, John Lewis</a></p>
<p>Parents can also limit access to Safari, music, apps, videos, games, the camera and, thankfully, the in-app purchases. </p>
<a>Swift Playgrounds</a>, for instance, is a programme that teaches children how to code.
<a> films and cartoons.</a> Also available in silver or gold. Unlike most specialist children's tablets, the iPad doesn't come with a case, so it's worth picking up a sturdy one.
<a>See John Lewis' options here</a>; or you can get a
<a>shock-proof kids' case</a> in a variety of colours. 
<h3>3. Pebble Gear Kids Tablet</h3>
<p><a>£99.99, Pebble Gear</a></p>
<p>For parents, there's a dashboard where you can set limits on the times of day the tablet can be used, and time limits so they don't go on playing forever, as well as seeing exactly which apps they're using and for how long. </p>
<h3>4. LeapFrog LeapPad Ultimate </h3>
<p><a>£83.99, Amazon</a></p>
<a>LeapFrog</a> provides games and videos while keeping things simple by limiting the tablet's access to the internet; your son or daughter won't be able to purchase apps, for example. 
<h3>Should I get a tablet for my children? </h3>
<p>With a <a>quarter of under twos and over a third of three- to five-year olds</a> owning a tablet, there's no denying they're a huge part of modern life. </p>
<a> recent study at UCL</a> found that toddlers and babies as young as six months are losing sleep due to tablet use. According to the research, every hour spent in front of a screen led to a loss of 16 to 17 minutes of sleep. Similarly, an
<a> investigation last year</a> suggested tablets could impair a child's speech development. 
<a>limit their own children's tech use</a>. While there is no official guidance at the moment, earlier this year the government's
<a>Commons Science Technology Committee announced an inquiry</a> into screen use and social media among youngsters.
