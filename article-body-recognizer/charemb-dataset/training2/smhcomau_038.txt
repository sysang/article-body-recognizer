<p>He and his housemate eventually found a three-bedroom house in Newport, in Melbourne’s west, for slightly above their initial budget, but it had more space and a spare room.</p>
<p>“Compared to some of the other houses we were looking at, it’s really good value. When we moved it was just before the long lockdown, so we’re glad we had a bigger house.”</p>
<p>Mr Mannix was lucky to find a property. Many others, particularly those looking on the Mornington Peninsula, struggled to find a new rental, with some forced to move out of the area which has seen a major influx of sea changers.</p>
<p>House rents along the sought-after stretch of coast soared by 10.3 per cent during the year to a median $480 per week, while unit rents jumped 6.5 per cent to $370, Domain data showed.</p>
<p>OBrien Real Estate operations manager Michelle Winch said there was a shortage of rental stock, as tenants continued to move into the area and former investors moved into the homes they once rented out.</p>
<p>“We’re still seeing people making a sea change permanently, not just from the inner city but from the outer suburbs,” Ms Winch said.</p>
<p>“Owners are either moving in to their investments or they are putting homes on the market, so there are locals now looking [for a rental] and feeling quite desperate.”</p>

<div>A landlords’ market: Perth tops nation for rental yields as prices boom</div>
<p>Western Australia is seeing a surge in rental prices not seen since the 2013 mining boom with house rents the third-best performing in Australia, unit rents the second-best performing, and gross rental yields the country’s highest.</p>
<p>This equated to a $45 jump from a median $415 per week to $460.</p>
<p>Perth units were even better performing, behind only Darwin, rising a dramatic 11.4 per cent, or $40, from a $350 per week median to $390.</p>
<p>It was also a large quarterly price jump with both house and unit rents rising by $10 a week between September and December alone.</p>
<p>Gross rental yields in Perth – the total annual rental income received from a property before tax – are now the highest in the country for both houses and units.</p>
<p>It is now more expensive to rent a home in Perth than in Melbourne, with house and unit medians $15 higher, and vacancies are 30 per cent lower than this time last year.</p>
<p>Domain chief of research and economics Nicola Powell told Radio 6PR these were the highest rent tenants had paid in seven years, and it was only $40 lower per week for a house now than it was during the 2013 boom.</p>
<p>“I think it’s well on its way to surpassing that record high,” she said.</p>
<p>“For anyone with a lease expiring it will be a bit of a rude awakening because they will be facing an increase in rent.</p>
<p>“We’re now in our busiest rental period … you have university starting, you have graduate jobs commencing.</p>
<p>“It’s very much a landlord market.</p>
<p>“It is one of the most competitive capital cities for tenants and that is what continues to support rent increases.</p>
<p>“Those hard border controls have meant some people who perhaps would have done fly-in, fly-out work had to relocate into Perth.”</p>
<p>She also said the usual flow of people leaving Perth to migrate interstate, which would also drag down Perth rents, had slowed.</p>
<p>Dr Powell said it was the first time Perth had ever taken the top spot for gross rental yield.</p>
<p>“This is a good thing to attract investment activity,” she said.</p>
<div><p>“If we continue to see rising investment, that should help to increase supply.”</p></div>

<div>‘Not really that great’: The ripple effect of booming rents in Byron Bay</div>
<p>Rents in northern NSW have jumped over the past year, buoyed by a spillover effect from coastal hotspot Byron Bay and the shift to remote work.</p>
<p>It now costs $850 a week to rent the median house in the greater Byron shire, Domain figures show, a 13.3 per cent rise in 12 months and $250 a week more than in greater Sydney.</p>
<p>Living in the town of Byron Bay itself costs a median $925 a week, up almost a third in five years and even more for larger family homes.</p>
<p>More affordable neighbouring towns have clocked double-digit price rises as sea-changers look for less expensive options than the hippie-turned-glamour destination, while some Byron locals have had little choice but to move to a cheaper town nearby.</p>
<p>“Migration into regional NSW is still very high,” Domain chief of research and economics Nicola Powell said.</p>
<p>“COVID has put the focus on coastal areas. Australians are driven by lifestyle and, if anything shows that, it’s these areas that are showing continued growth.”</p>
<p>Ballina area rents have risen 18.2 per cent over the past year, to a median of $650 a week, Domain data shows, while inland, Lismore rents are up 20.9 per cent to $520.</p>
<p>Tweed LGA rents rose 21.4 per cent to $695 over the year, while along the coast, Coffs Harbour and Port Macquarie also rose by double digits.</p>
<p>Lennox Head-based Lois Buckett, of the eponymous real estate agency, was leasing homes for $650 or $700 a week a few years ago, whereas now she lets little for less than $750, and $900 to $1200 for family homes.</p>
<p>“It might sound great, but it’s not really that great,” she said. “We’re conscious of people leaving the area, not being able to afford to rent.”</p>
<p>Professionals Ballina Lennox Head principal Peter Carmont said there are very few rentals available, which has been the case for at least 18 months.</p>
<p>“We’ve probably had a bit of a flow from Byron’s rentals being so expensive – Lennox Head is a bit cheaper than Byron and Ballina is a bit cheaper than Lennox,” he said.</p>
<p>Aside from the Byron escapees and the sea-change influx, first-home buyers have purchased some local properties and reduced the amount of rental stock available, he said.</p>
<p>With little available for rent, business owners such as publicans have called him asking to find a property to house their staff.</p>
<p>Further north, rental properties are leasing fast, Raine Horne Pottsville Beach/Cabarita Beach principal Jamie Wilmen has found.</p>
<p>“Three, four, five people enquire straight away and one of them’s usually getting it – if anyone rests on their laurels and is a week late they’ll miss it,” he said.</p>
<p>“People are recognising it’s probably an ideal place to set up home, we’re seeing a lot more people come our way.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Bellingen rents have soared 41.5 per cent in a year. While not adjacent to Byron, Bellingen has a much more affordable median house rent of $520 a week – although that has risen from just $368 a year ago.</p>
<p>Even for higher-end properties, above $800 a week, there would often be four or five enquiries. Some potential tenants are offering $20 to $50 more a week.</p>
<p>This is usually when properties are vacated and re-advertised, not when leases are renewed.</p>
<p>“A lot of our owners don’t like to outprice locals,” she said. “They tend not to raise the rent to market value.”</p>

<div>For the pandemic bride, the ‘wedding wardrobe’ replaces The Dress</div>

<h1>For the pandemic bride, the ‘wedding wardrobe’ replaces The Dress</h1>
<div><p>Planning your Big Day was a pre-2020 luxury, but in its place comes a renewed yearning for fashion and fun, and for old conventions to be loosened up.</p><div><p>By Julia Naughton</p><time>September 2, 2021</time></div></div>
<p>Once upon a time the soon-to-be betrothed wrestled with disasters such as seating plans and the weather.</p>
<p>One designer who took notice of the shift was Helen O’Connor of Thurley, who spent much of Melbourne’s extended lockdown last year designing her inaugural bridal range.</p>
<p>Accessibility was the key driver behind <a>Vera Wang’s decision to sign a 10-year licensing deal with Barcelona-based Pronovias Group</a> to launch her affordable offshoot bridal brand Vera Wang Bride.</p>
<p>Launching in October, the Vera Wang Bride collection will offer gowns priced at 60 per cent lower than her couture styles most often seen on celebrities including Hailey Bieber, Chrissy Teigen and Kim Kardashian.</p>
<p>The New York-based designer says there are far fewer rules for today’s brides compared to 30 years ago – a change she welcomes.</p>
<p>“I’m encouraging individuality. If you want to get married on a beach, or in a yacht or in a church, you should be able to have the freedom and the personal creativity and confidence to wear something that makes you feel happy.”</p>
<p>Instead of traditional satin or lace fabrics, or the OTT meringue gown, brides are opting for something that better reflects their sense of style.</p>
<p>With the Delta strain shuttering bridal boutiques across the country, designers are tweaking their lead times and moving fittings online.</p>
<p>For a simple design by O’Connor (such as the mini tuxedo dress with an oversized bow) brides-to-be can expect to wait one month, three months for something more intricate and six months for a bespoke gown.</p>
<p>And despite the many roadblocks of the pandemic, couples are still desperate to celebrate with their loved ones in person prompting a new take on the reception tradition: the after-party.</p>
<p>Many couples are choosing a low-key ceremony and then planning a bigger celebration once the various restrictions ease, says Ziems.</p>
<p>“The after-party allows couples to celebrate one of their biggest life milestones with family and friends – without the added pressures that come with the traditional ceremony.”</p>
<p>Who needs one wedding when you can have two? And, as Ziems says, it gives brides the opportunity to expand their “wedding wardrobe”. Enter, the party dress.</p>

<div>Australian skincare brand Ultra Violette facing diversity backlash</div>
<p>When the founders of rising Australian beauty brand Ultra Violette announced 11 adaptable shades to launch their first tinted SPF formula last week, they had already exceeded the efforts of the local competition.</p>
<p>Co-founder Ava Matthews said that trolling comments were removed but what remains is vocal dissatisfaction, much of which came before the product range went on sale on Monday.</p>
<p>“If two dark shades work for ALL shades of darker skin, why are there a bunch of lighter shades? Why not two light ones for ALLLLL shades of white. This is a joke yall [sic] come on what is this?” said @skinkerith.</p>
<p>“Very uneven shade range. Those first four look almost identical same [sic] with next three and then a few dark shades at the end. Very disappointing to see. Have brands not learned anything,” said @olgreeneyesemma.</p>
<p>“I was completely distressed,” said co-founder Ava Matthews of the negative feedback. “It was pretty concerning. We don’t want to disappoint everyone. We feel like we have so far done the best by our customers.”</p>
<p>Originally, Matthews and Jefferd planned to launch the range in the Australian market with 10 shades but after testing on 100 different women expanded to 11, resulting in four light shades, four medium and three darker.</p>
<p>“We had to land on how many we wanted and what we could afford,” Jefferd said. “There is a quite a process to go through with passing the required testing for an SPF product.”</p>
<p>Back in 2018 beauty entrepreneur Zoe Foster-Blake came under fire when her Go-To Skincare brand released a tinted SPF moisturiser in one shade. The product was removed by Foster-Blake in 2020, in the interests of inclusivity.</p>
<p>“We had been warned going into tints that you are not going to win,” Jefferd said. “The alternative is to have never done it. For a moment on Friday we wished we hadn’t.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s sad that it’s 2021 and I’m having issues like this every day,” Kyle-Taylor said. “Looking at these shades, I don’t think one would suit me.”</p>
<p>In March Kyle-Taylor joined Adore Beauty’s Global Shades initiative to shine a brighter light on diversity among Australian beauty manufacturers and consumers.</p>
<p>Since the backlash, Matthews and Jefferd have reached out to online critics interested in having a constructive dialogue, inviting them to participate in future testing and are looking at expanding their shade offering before launching in the UK.</p>
<p>“We never intended this to be the final 11,” said Matthews. “I have never seen a brand that has launched a tinted brand of any sort that has not changed and evolved.”</p>
<p>“As two white women, we know that we need to check ourselves and be a part of these conversations with our audience,” Jefferd said. “Most of all, this is an opportunity to listen.”</p>

<div>‘She’d sack me if I went grey’: how the pandemic inspired a revolution</div>
<p>Those around her were clear how they felt about her struggle, too.</p>
<p>But then COVID-19 hit and Vitek’s hairdresser closed down.</p>
<p>Her friend might have to get used to it. Because across Australia, there’s a growing army of women who have decided to embrace their natural grey hair during the pandemic – or if they’re not grey, to dye it that colour.</p>
<p>Sydney hairstylist Jason Gardner isn’t surprised, saying that “fashion grey” first became a popular hair colour when Kelly Osborne dyed hers in 2012, and that the pandemic has inspired people to take the plunge.</p>
<p>It also accounts for why Victorian model Lou Kenny, 62 – whose collarbone-length hair is a beautiful mix of black and white sections – is just as busy modelling now as she was in her heyday in her 20s and 30s.</p>
<p>But for many of the women who’ve made the transition to grey in recent months, the joy that has arisen from the growing-out process has led to rich and complicated identity shifts.</p>
<p>For Claire Brandenburger, finally ditching the dye two years ago has meant liberation.</p>
<p>“Like waxing our legs and wearing make-up,” she says, adding that seeing other women go grey during the pandemic made it easier for her.</p>
<p>This isn’t to say it’s been an easy transition for many women.</p>
<p>Lauren Metz, a Sydney health care provider, was insulted by patients at work.</p>
<p>For the number of times she’s been attacked for her choice, though, it’s been more than worth it.</p>
<p>For Vitek, going grey has changed her view not just of herself but of the wider culture.</p>

<div>Why I’ve resolved not to make a New Year’s resolution this year</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>The last thing I need is to spend the next three months in a doomed enterprise of self-improvement; the sort of failed mission that merely adds a little self-loathing to whatever problem you were vainly trying to solve.</p>
<p>Better to find what Ian Dury called some Reasons to be Cheerful. That’s my resolution for today. It may be the best way to farewell the two years we’ve just endured, and to hope that a better year lies ahead.</p>
<p>I’ll then stumble outside, where the temperature will, most likely, be perfect. Sydney in summer is the Goldilocks city – neither too hot, nor too cold, but just right.</p>
<p>Then, late in the afternoon, you head home and if home has heated up in your absence, a southerly buster should cool things down, just in time for evening drinks.</p>
<p>How lucky is that? I feel like Professor Pangloss in Candide. This must be the best of all possible worlds.</p>
<p>Then Omicron came along and, what a surprise, the experts were proved spectacularly and lamentably correct.</p>
<p>Then there were politicians and pundits, in every country, who realised they could advance their own interests by encouraging vaccine hesitancy. People would die because of their actions, but they did it anyway.</p>
<p>When you think of these things, you find yourself falling into a deep well of despair. That’s why, today at least, I plan to climb towards the sunlight.</p>
<p>And so I count my blessings. Will you join me?</p>
<p>Next, the nurses, doctors, teachers who took on their extra burdens. </p>
<p>Then the supermarket and hospitality staff who wore masks for each eight-hour shift and still managed to be upbeat.</p>
<p>Plus the work colleagues who got tested and self-isolated at the merest sniffle, protecting the rest of us.</p>
<p>Then the truck drivers, police officers, the thoughtful friends, the kids who wrote cards for isolated neighbours.</p>
<p>The sunshine, once you look for it, has been more widespread than the clouds – even in this time of the pandemic. And, of course, once you start counting your blessings it’s hard to stop.</p>
<p>It reminds me of the way snow falls on mountains, which just happen to be perfectly shaped for skiing. Or the way, just when you develop age spots and wrinkles – I have some now – you become too blind to see yourself in the mirror.</p>
<p>Or the way your child or grandchild just happens to be the most beautiful child ever born. Now there’s a bit of luck.</p>
<p>A prawn sandwich on white bread. A cold beer on a hot day. Finding common purpose with your follow citizens in staring down a pandemic.</p>
<p>The year ahead will bring more troubles, of course it will, but even in tough times there are pleasures for the taking. It just helps if you look for them.</p>
<p>Here’s to a happier new year.</p>

<div>How to get your career back on track in 2022</div>
<p>As we crawled towards the end of last year, a career rev-up was the last thing on many of our minds. (Much bigger priorities: sleep, beach, fun, family, friends and relaxation).</p>
<p>But now that many of us have recharged a little, it’s almost time to direct some of that new-found energy into giving our careers some TLC.</p>
<p>We asked two career coaches how to start resuscitating your professional relationships, reassess priorities – and shake off any career paralysis.</p>
<p>Career coach Leah Lambart, of Relaunch Me, says many employees are feeling quite disconnected from their work, managers and colleagues.</p>
<p>It’s heightened for those who started a new job during the pandemic. “In many cases, these employees have spent only a handful of days in the office, if at all,” she says.</p>
<p>So, how to turn this ship around?</p>
<h3><b>Relationship reboot</b></h3>
<p>Lambart suggests being strategic about two to three people you’d like to build a relationship with in your team or company in the next six months.</p>
<p>Lambart says you should (without becoming a “serial pest”):</p>
<li>Ask lots of questions to get to know these people, the role they play and the challenges they face</li>
<li>Think about ways you can help them overcome those problems</li>
<li>Share helpful information, such as templates, industry or competitor insights, or interesting articles and podcasts</li>
<li>Introduce them to others who may be able to add value to their business</li>
<h3><b>Don’t rush it</b></h3>
<p>Lambart says many workers will find the return to the office – when Omicron permits – overwhelming, so it’s important to avoid coming on too strong.</p>
<p>“Whilst it will be really important for employees to work on building relationships again, it is important not to rush it,” she says.</p>
<p>“Don’t be too pushy when it comes to setting up face-to-face meetings or client visits if you sense that the other person may be resisting.”</p>
<h3><b>Reluctant networkers, take note</b></h3>
<p>Heidi Winney, executive coach at Strategic Career Development, says the pandemic may not have had much impact on “reluctant networkers” because they wouldn’t have been deliberately building relationships anyway.</p>
<p>However if you fall into this category, there are some fairly painless ways of building your professional relationships in 2022, says Winney.</p>
<p>“Don’t start a relationship with somebody you don’t know – build on the ones that you already have and get more comfortable,” Winney says.</p>
<p>Likewise, being active on LinkedIn – even if it’s just updating your profile, or commenting on posts – keeps your name out there.</p>
<h3><b>Reassessing your priorities</b></h3>
<p>If you’re feeling like a change, the great news is that Australia is currently a candidate’s market, say career coaches.</p>
<p>If you’re stuck for career ideas, Winney says online tools such as Strengths Profile or CliftonStrengths can help.</p>
<p>Still feeling tired? Then there’s no harm in chilling out for a bit, says Lambart.</p>
<p>And even once you’re ready to start career planning, you don’t have to do everything at once.</p>
<h3><b>Leah Lambart’s other tips</b></h3>
<li><b>Feeling dissatisfied in your current role? Pinpoint the problem.</b> For example, is it the actual content of the role, the people or the work environment?</li>
<li><b>Figure out what makes you happy.</b> Think about what energises you, and what drains you.</li>
<li><b>Assess your values. </b>Consider what’s most important to you in your career and life right now. Do you prefer the slower pace of working from home, for example?</li>
<li><b>Identify your transferable skills. </b>If you’re considering a career change, think about your skills that will cross over, and articulate these to prospective employers.</li>

<div>How to nail your summer recharge</div>
<p>We can all agree that 2021 was a doozy. The second year of the COVID-19 pandemic brought us more lockdowns and border closures, resulting in family separations, cancelled plans and heartache for business owners trying to stay afloat.</p>
<h3><b>Create a mental haven</b></h3>
<p>Swap your smartphone screen for a page-turning paperback, go swimming in the ocean or tackle a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. “It sounds clichéd, but smell the roses,” says Blashki.</p>
<p>Spending time in nature “restores your energy and capacity to refocus,” says Dr Suzy Green, founder of The Positivity Institute. Go for a bushwalk, book in a surfing lesson or simply lie back and watch the clouds glide past.</p>
<h3><b>Embrace mindfulness </b></h3>
<h3><b>Zoom out and log off</b></h3>
<h3><b>Eat, sleep and exercise </b></h3>
<h3><b>Prioritise positivity</b></h3>

<div>I’m learning to say sorry less, but why don’t some men say it more?</div>
<p>“You need to say sorry less.”</p>
<p>I’ve been told this at every job I’ve ever worked, by every partner I’ve ever had and by all my friends and family.</p>
<p>I’m working on saying sorry less – or at least only when it’s necessary. But when does sorry really mean sorry? And why don’t other men say sorry more?</p>
<p>Pope Francis is an advocate for apologising. In a letter released on December 26, he said “sorry” was among the three most important words for a happy marriage, along with “please” and “thanks.”</p>
<p>It’s a common belief that men usually don’t say sorry as often as women. According to a study from Canada’s University of Waterloo, men typically apologise less overall, and believe they cause offence less often.</p>
<p>Professor Brock Bastian, from the School of Psychological Sciences at the University of Melbourne, says there’s discomfort when apologising, and vulnerability.</p>
<p>“Men tend to not be as good at being vulnerable as women,” he says.</p>
<p>Could that be why many men don’t say sorry as often? University of Queensland clinical psychology senior lecturer Dr James Kirby says there might be several reasons.</p>
<p>“Saying sorry can be perceived as a weakness, which would chip away at their masculine status,” he says.</p>
<p>“Also, men high in ‘traditional masculinity’ value not showing emotions, and when saying sorry we often show sadness, regret, remorse.</p>
<p>“Others can avoid saying sorry because they don’t want to be perceived as making a mistake or having done something wrong. In these instances, some people can see themselves as a ‘bad person’ if they have to say sorry.”</p>
<p>In Canada, for example, sorry doesn’t necessarily mean someone is guilty. The Apology Act even states that just because someone says they’re sorry doesn’t mean they’re legally guilty.</p>
<p>Professor Bastian says “over-apologising” can be because of societal expectations or a sign of a lack of confidence. But the more you use the word, the less impact it may have.</p>
<a> <i>Top of Mind</i></a>, says saying sorry too much and for things we have little control over can make some people think less of us. In
<a><i>The Power of an Apology</i></a>, author Beverly Engel warns excessively apologising can be interpreted as an invitation to treat us poorly.
<p>Still, Professor Bastian stresses that saying sorry a lot isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Research shows it’s a sign of inner strength, intelligence, empathy – and is a desirable leadership trait.</p>
<p>“It’s actually not a very psychologically or reputationally expensive thing to apologise, but people think it is,” Bastian says.</p>
<p>Not saying sorry can even impede our happiness, Bastian says. He adds that apologising can help remove feelings of guilt or shame we might otherwise bottle up inside.</p>
<p>Dr Kirby agrees. “Saying sorry can be very therapeutic. But people can be very afraid of saying sorry.”</p>
<i>Why Won’t You Apologize: Healing Big Betrayals and Everyday Hurts</i> – told NPR, a good apology needs to be sincere. It’s also important to be vulnerable, she says, and listen to the other person.
<p>With stories about people not apologising for bad behaviour in the news regularly, clearly some of us need to learn to say sorry more – and better.</p>
<p>But I’d also like to think I try to put myself in other people’s shoes to better empathise with them – and take responsibility for my actions. I’m not sorry for that.</p>

<div>The Duchess of Cambridge rules of dressing at 40</div>
<p>“When you look back at other royals, they have very much dressed for the era,” says Mattie Cronan, style director at the Australian Women’s Weekly.</p>
<p>“Princess Diana and Fergie were classic ’80s. When we look back at Kate, there won’t be such a trend-led departure. She has really locked down her look, especially in the past 10 years.”</p>
<h3>Find a uniform and a theme</h3>
<p>Cronan, familiar with royalty having worked with Crown Princess Mary of Denmark, describes Kate’s approach as uniform dressing, enlivened by the theme of the event that she’s attending.</p>
<p>“It’s about being respectful of the occasion and not outshining it,” Cronan says.</p>
<p>Stylist Chloe Buttenshaw, who worked on covers with Miranda Kerr and Jennifer Hawkins at Marie Claire, points to Kate’s mix of high end and high street labels as easy to emulate for those without access to a family vault stacked with tiaras.</p>
<p>“A Zara dress paired with an Alexander McQueen coat or the Zimmermann dress she wore on her Australian tour in 2014, which sold out quickly. Everyone has a chance to dress like Kate,” Buttenshaw says.</p>
<p>While everyone may have the opportunity to dress like Kate, stylist Mikey Ayoubi who has worked with singer Jessica Mauboy and actor Bojana Novakovic (from the Binge series Love Me) is more selective about which looks to emulate.</p>
<p>Instead, Ayoubi pinpoints Kate’s strong blazer game, a sartorial choice her mother-in-law Princess Diana scored style points with.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s open or closed, I think this blend of the feminine and tailoring, rather than just pretty dresses, is more relevant to the modern woman,” Ayoubi says.</p>
<p>“The royal blue Zara blazer she wore in Scotland with a pleated skirt is an absolute favourite, and it’s very Princess Diana.”</p>
<h3>Simple with a smoky eye</h3>
<p>When it comes to beauty looks, Kate has flirted with a fringe, side part and the occasional up-do, but she generally sticks to a signature style where flawless skin and long hair takes centre stage.</p>
<p>Strong lipstick colours are also avoided. Too trendy and too great a risk of getting lipstick on the teeth.</p>
<p>“It’s all designed to be very approachable and relatable.”</p>

<div>What Emily In Paris teaches you about high-end fashion</div>
<i> Vogue</i> for the articles. This is a live action comic strip starring the latest from Dior, Isabel Marant, Fendi and Versace, with support from Lily Collins as Emily.
<p>The life lessons from Emily in Paris may be few and far between, but there are solid takeaways about trends and how to wear luxury labels that rise above the beret, baguette and Balmain clichés.</p>
<p>Lesson 1: Everyone in midriffsIf you’re not flashing flesh, are you even in Paris? The erogenous zone of this series is clearly the midriff, with every female character taking turns revealing a slice of skin beneath their bust.</p>
<p>As the 50-something executive Sylvie, actress Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu models an elevated approach in a short-cut, knitted jacket with a fringed hem from French luxury brand Alaia. The raffia fringe offers a tantalising glimpse of skin.</p>
<p>Once you have picked the right shapes and details, relax and let the clothes do the work, which means that you shouldn’t wait to exhale.</p>
<p>The look is brilliant standing, but it’s worth throwing your jacket on the back of a chair when seated, as Camille demonstrates in the first episode of the second season when the seriously structured shoulders almost rise to ear level.</p>
<p>In Emily in Paris it is the oversized sunglasses and knee-high boots that succeed in stealing the spotlight. If knee-high was not enough of a statement on its own, in Emily in Paris the boots come in animal print, lilac and pink tulle.</p>
<p>The answer is much simpler. Patricia Fields has collaborated with Seymoure Gloves on a collection of colourful styles, starting at $US298 ($AU413). This is one for the fans, or committed electric scooter riders.</p>

<p>“Clothes deliberately designed for tiny boobs. Those of us packing heat understand why.”</p>
<h3>Nakkiah Lui, actor and writer</h3>
<p>“With the rise of TikTok I am noticing a shift away from fast fashion towards a more personal expression of style. Micro identities such as Goth and Regency-core are filtering through. It’s almost a reaction to Instagram.</p>
<p>“As for shoes, something ugly with a pretty dress is now classic. It’s the statement I’m sticking to, whether it’s something chunky from Margiela or the Gucci loafers that are everywhere.”</p>
<p>Say goodbye to...”After two years of not wearing Spanx, I’m not ready to go back. It’s about style and comfort today. A short kaftan in a party print from Pucci or metallic from Oséree ticks both boxes.”</p>
<h3>Paris Bishop, model-to-watch</h3>
<p>I might even be tempted to rock one of those bodysuits Kim Kardashian has been wearing. I’d love to pull it off. I could get some digitals [photos] done at my agency in a full black bodysuit.</p>
<p>The seventies colour-blocking trends is also big for me. I’m from Melbourne, so I wear a lot of black but green and orange have me excited.</p>
<h3><b>Shannon Thomas, Desordre Boutique, founder</b></h3>
<p>“The current mood is very much a mix of The Fifth Element with The Sweetest Thing, which sounds as crazy as it is. Labels like Ottolinger, with high-impact cut-outs in bold oranges, along with flirty Magda Butrym florals get it right.</p>
<p>“I’m really feeling strong, angular and fierce lines. It could be a blazer and T-shirt combination from The Mannei or mini-skirts with boots.</p>
<p>“A surprising trend is gloves. Not the fingerless kind. These go all the way past the elbow for an evening look.”</p>
<p><b>Say goodbye to…</b>”I’m not wearing anything floaty. It’s all about strength.”</p>
<h3>David Flack, interior designer</h3>
<p>“When it comes to movie inspiration it’s hard to go past the summer vibes of Call Me By Your Name. Those eighties looks are key. At the moment the closest I’m getting is some Birkenstocks with socks.”</p>
<p>Say goodbye to...”Don’t you feel as though the whole activewear look has been completely overdone?”</p>
<h3>Olivia Suleimon, actor, model, director and DJ</h3>
<p>“In the same way that we are beginning to invest in local film and television content again I’m feeling enthusiastic about fashion and spending on Australian labels Matteau, Christopher Esber and Sir.</p>
<p>“This is the time to go all out, whether it’s changing your hair, getting a new piercing or switching your nails style. Don’t hold back. We shouldn’t be censoring ourselves anymore and that applies to fashion.”</p>
<p>“Cheap jewellery should be left behind as we focus on investment pieces.”</p>
