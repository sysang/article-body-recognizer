<h1> Bangladesh deliver win for the ages against New Zealand - it is high time they toured England </h1>
<p> Skipper Mominul Haque and his team appear to have a better grasp of the basic disciplines of Test cricket than England do </p>
<div> <div> <span> <span> <span> Scyld Berry <div>Chief Cricket Writer</div> <time> 5 January 2022 • 10:11am </time> </span> </span> </span> </div> </div>
<p>Thus a four-wicket win in Colombo in 2017 had effectively been Bangladesh’s only proper Test victory abroad - to go with 10 wins at home, in all of 127 Tests and 20 years of trying and being walloped.</p>
<p><a>So no need for Zak Crawley</a> or Joe Root to feel they have to launch a cavalry charge to turn this Ashes series around and score a glorious century. Grinding the opposition down for a couple of days can do the job even more thoroughly.</p>
<h1> Darren Stevens interview: Don't blame me for the Ashes - I'm Australia's bogeyman! </h1>
<p> Stevens is still taking wickets with his ‘dibbly-dobbly’ bowling, but says an erosion of batting skills is hurting England </p>
<div> <div> By Ben Bloom <time> 5 January 2022 • 12:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Stationed on the opposite side of the world to home, the Australian contingent operating in county cricket soon developed their own form of support network via WhatsApp. The chosen name of the group was “Stevo’s gonna get ya”.</p>
<p>Now, with Stevens’s Kent due at Hove in a few days, Head – <a>who would go on to be man of the match in the first Ashes Test after scoring 152</a> – was adamant the same fate would not befall him.</p>
<p>“He said he’d been getting a lot of stick on the group, but that I definitely wasn’t going to get him,” Stevens says now, with a laugh. What happened next was inevitable.</p>
<p>“I nicked him off and he was dropped at slip,” Stevens recalls. “Then two balls later he chopped one on and was bowled. We went out for dinner that night and there was quite a bit of banter.”</p>
<p>To many, Stevens, who turns 46 in April and has no plans to retire, is the ultimate cult hero. Over the past three seasons, he has taken 120 first-class wickets at an average of 17.43 and scored 1,324 runs at 33.95.</p>
<p>He is on a run of three successive Kent player-of-the-year awards, and last May became the oldest Wisden cricketer of the year for 88 years.</p>
<p>Destined never to be picked for his country, he is realising a dream held by middle-aged amateur cricketers up and down the land.</p>
<p>“So it’s frustrating when people say I only get wickets on green seamers in early or late season. But anyway… it’s a load of bulls---. My job is to win games for Kent.”</p>
<p>For Stevens, the issues behind England’s quickfire Ashes defeat are twofold: a lack of preparation and an over-emphasis on short-form cricket domestically that has prompted an erosion of batting techniques.</p>
<p>“I feel like Twenty20 has decreased batsmen’s defences. They are all thinking about scoring a run a ball. Actually, four-day cricket is about batting time and wearing the opposition down.”</p>
<p>“Play to your strengths,” he says. “If we use a Kookaburra ball, it plays to Australia’s strengths and they have the bowlers for it. If they thump us in England, then what happens?”</p>

<p>Edinson Cavani will not be allowed to leave Manchester United in the transfer window this month.</p>
<p>Ralf Rangnick, United’s interim manager, also hopes to keep Donny van de Beek until the end of the season despite the midfielder’s desire for regular football and fears of missing out on Holland’s World Cup squad.</p>
<p>“He knows that I will definitely not let him go,” said Rangnick. “For me, he is a highly important player for the rest of the season, still playing in three competitions, so we will definitely need Edi.</p>
<p>“I would rather have another Edi on top of that but for me it’s clear that Edi has to stay.”</p>
<p>Injuries have limited Cavani to just three Premier League starts for United this season but the 34-year-old underlined his value during an impressive showing in attack alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in Thursday’s 3-1 win over Burnley.</p>
<p>“We had quite a few conversations in the last couple of weeks — probably the player with whom I have spoken most,” Rangnick said before Wolves’ visit to Old Trafford on Monday.</p>
<p>“I told him from the very first day that, for me, he is a highly important player. He is probably the only one who can play as a striker back to goal and face to goal.</p>
<p>“His professionalism, his work ethic is just amazing and I told him that I desperately want him to stay until the end of the season.</p>
<p>“He knows that. He also knows how highly I rate him and how highly I respect him, and that was also the reason why I played him from the beginning together with Cristiano [against Burnley].</p>
<p>“If at one stage we need to rest [Ronaldo] it’s no problem but then it’s even more important to have Edinson in the squad.”</p>
<h2>Unhappy players may not be allowed out on loan</h2>
<p>Rangnick said he had held talks with Van de Beek and wants the Dutchman to stay, despite the player's fears he will not make Holland’s World Cup squad if he does not start playing.</p>
<p>“But I still believe that we should keep him, that he should stay here, definitely until the end of this season and try to get as much game-time as he possibly can.”</p>
<h2>Martial dropped while seeking move away</h2>
<p>“He is not injured currently so I decided to go for this group of players that were in the squad today, so it had nothing to do with injuries.”</p>
<h2>Ethan Laird to be called back from loan</h2>
<p>Ethan Laird is to be recalled from his loan at Swansea City, with the England Under-19 right-back expected to join Bournemouth for the second half of the season. </p>
<p>The 20-year-old has been a regular in South Wales under Russell Martin, who also coached him at MK Dons, but he is now wanted by Scott Parker in his plans to bring Premier League football back to the Vitality Stadium. </p>
<p>United have been impressed with Laird’s progress, according to sources at Old Trafford. The club see him as a first-team player of the future and his experience in EFL football will benefit them when he returns. </p>
<p>Laird has played in 20 of Swansea’s Championship games this season following his season-long loan to the Welsh club, although United had an option for him to be recalled before the end of the campaign. </p>
<p>Rangnick has competition at right-back, with Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Diogo Dalot competing for a place on that side of his defence, with Laird to be assessed as a first-team option in the future. </p>

<p>Manchester United ended 2021 with a much-needed win against a depleted Burnley.</p>
<p>Having gone top of the Premier League with victory at Turf Moor in January, talk of a title challenge had turned to the need to kickstart their Champions League qualification push by the end of a topsy-turvy year.</p>
<p>There remains plenty of work for Ralf Rangnick to do, but Thursday's 3-1 win against an under-strength Burnley continued the unbeaten start to his interim stint and sent the side up to sixth heading into the new year.</p>
<p>But where has the German's influence been evident thus far? And what issues still persist?</p>
<h2>Getting message across with authority</h2>
<a>albeit against a depleted Burnley team</a> with four players absent with Covid-19. In particular, he was upset at the body language in the recent victory over Norwich City but
<a>here chief whinger Cristiano Ronaldo</a> was encouraging his team-mates and demanding more even when two goals ahead. 
<p>“Body language is one thing and the manager has completely cut it out. He wants no more so that's final. All the players have firmly taken that on board and it is important we do,” said Scott McTominay. </p>
<p>His authority will heighten in January if he can loan out players such as Anthony Martial who want to leave and could damage morale. </p>
