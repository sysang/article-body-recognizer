<p>Friends of mine, like many, used our time in lockdown to fall in love with their beautiful garden again. But how to manage the upkeep as the world returns to normality?</p>
<h3>How to plant a roses in the middle of summer</h3>
<li> <p>Water your potted rose properly, deeply, the day before you plant it. Not at the last minute.</p> </li>
<li>Prepare the soil – digging in large amounts of organic matter laced with rose fertiliser and creating a rough planting hole. Water the hole well and let it drain.</li>
<li>Snuggle the rose, still in its pot, into the hole and make sure that the point where the stem becomes root will be at ground level (which will of course be slightly lower than the newly dug-out surrounding soil).</li>
<li>Earth up around the pot very firmly. Wet the soil around the outside of the pot. Check the soil level again (go back to (3) if it is wrong).</li>
<li>Carefully remove the rose, still in its pot, from the ground, leaving behind an absolutely perfect pot imprint in the dampened soil.</li>
<li>Sprinkle some Rootgrow in the hole.</li>
<h3>My verbascums are ruined</h3>

<p>Use <a>Bug Clear Ultra Gun</a> for flowers, fruit and veg. You could, however, grow another verbascum somewhere out of sight, leaving it unsprayed. It will then become a “sacrifice” and get eaten to bits.</p>
<h3>What are the signs of rose rust?</h3>
<p>I looked carefully yesterday at my wonderful hitherto trouble-free rose and I noticed that there appeared to be an orange powder on the branches and some of the leaves. When I looked more closely the leaves were speckled with orange spots. </p>
<p>All the prunings have been bagged separately but what should I do with my rose bush? Now that I have cut away the damaged leaves and branches do you think it will survive or should I try to dig the plant up and dispose of it? </p>

<p>And what Ben Raskin lacks in Anya Taylor-Joy celebrity, he more than makes up for in practical, good gardening sense, as his very readable book lifts the lid on the how, why, what and when of this useful (and relatively modern) by-product.</p>
<p>In his book, Raskin explores all the possibilities of using woodchip, from the less obvious, such as raising mushrooms, to boosting the foundation of soil-dwelling microlife beneath our gardens, to its value in locking in carbon.</p>
<p>Then there’s “no-dig gardening” – the till-free technique that swaps spadework for mulching. This is where easy-to-shift, long-lasting and economical composted woodchip comes in very handy.</p>
<a>other diseases</a> where the stress response promoted by ­salicylic acid in the willow bark (a component also used to make aspirin) increases plant immunity.
<a>soil health and productivity</a>. My gut feeling is that most [tree] species will offer something slightly different, and have their own niche, says Raskin.
<p>And these days, with the imperative to garden in a greener way, it’s in the “niches” that we’ll find new techniques. Niche is good.</p>
<h2>Everything you need to know about woodchips</h2>
<p>Like using a lid on a pan of peas, woodchip mulch locks in moisture and protects the soil surface from desiccating winds and sunshine. It is particularly useful for ensuring new trees establish in their early years.</p>
<p>Trees covered most of the British Isles for millennia, during which time their falling branches were recycled into the soil. Woodchips are a replacement for this lost natural process of soil-­building.</p>
<p>Composted woodchips are a viable replacement for peat in potting mixes. The homogenous open structure and low nutrient levels make chips good for seeds and potting woody plants.</p>
<h2>Nitrogen ‘lock-up’</h2>
<h2>Hügelkultur helper</h2>
<p>Under herbs, woodchip prevents rain from bouncing gritty soil up onto the leaves (saving expensive dental disasters) and similarly prevents soil-borne blackspot disease from splashing up from infected leaf litter.</p>
<p>Woodchip helps to clean polluted soils by feeding the fungi responsible for degrading oil and diesel spills, thereby speeding up the cleaning process.</p>
<p>The angular chunks mean woodchip mulches tend to lock together, making them useful for protecting bare-soil slopes and, for example, supporting strawberries on windy sites where straw blows away.</p>
<p>Conifer woodchips take longer to break down than those derived from deciduous trees. They’re also more acidic, so useful if mulching acid-lovers such as rhododendrons and blueberries.</p>
<p>By increasing soil microlife, health and plant growth, woodchip contributes to carbon capture within the soil.</p>
<h2>Hard-wearing surface </h2>
<p>Woodchips alleviate poorly drained and compacted ground by encouraging soil microlife and worms that burrow air holes through the soil profile. They also spread the weight of passers-by, particularly useful in areas of high-footfall, eg city parks.</p>
<p>Source woodchip from local tree surgeons. Those that have to pay to get rid of it may deliver a load for free. If using woodchip for compost, ask for deciduous/non-coniferous species.</p>
<p>Mulching potted trees with woodchip reduces the need for watering and prevents compost from being blasted out by the hose. </p>
<h2>Three of the best woodchippers and shredders</h2>
<p>Shredders have fast-moving, semi-sharp blades that sever the wood lengthways along the grain, like an axe. They work well with leafy material, but are noisy and can’t handle large branches.</p>
<p>Chippers have blades that mash or crush across the grain, and although they can take hefty timber, large amounts of green material will clog the blades.</p>
<h2>Einhell GC-KS 2540 electric shredder </h2>
<h2>Cobra CHIP650LE petrol shredder</h2>
<p>Suitable for large gardens, orchards and small-holdings. Relatively compact, easy-to-move design that, thanks to a 6.5hp petrol engine, takes branches of 80mm diameter. £934.99, <a>gardenmachinery direct.co.uk</a></p>

<header> <h1> The ultimate guide to mulberries: the best varieties, growing tips and recipes </h1> <p> There are plenty of reasons to go round the mulberry bush </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Mark Diacono <time> 22 December 2021 • 9:35am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Back in the days when we used to phone a building in the hope that the person we wanted to speak to was in it, I ate my first mulberry.</p>
<p>A handful of berries was offered, a glass of the previous year’s mulberry vodka poured… and so began a chain of events that directly led to me sitting here, writing about the finest fruit I’ve ever eaten.</p>
<p>Over more mulberry vodkas, a penny dropped that evening: this incredible fruit, too delicate at its peak to make it to the shops, could only be mine again if I grew them myself.</p>
<p>Soon after, my wife and I moved to two bare fields with a plan that read “Mulberries”. In researching mulberries, I uncovered medlars and quince – similarly forgotten fruit – and <a>Otter Farm</a> was born.</p>
<p>Mulberries’ flavour is only partly navigable via others, but imagine a deeper, winier, juicier blackberry, with hints of blackcurrant, raspberry and a gentle sherbertiness and you’ll be in the ballpark.</p>
<p>They really are utterly delicious. If you are one of the many yet to eat mulberries, you won’t have to plant one to try them: it is perfectly likely that a mulberry tree is close at hand.</p>
<p>Depending on the sunniness of summer and where you are in the country, mulberries can be ripe anytime in August and early September, so once you have found a tree keep an eye on the fruit and ready the Tupperware.</p>
<h2>How to grow mulberry bushes</h2>
<p>If space is an issue but it’s flavour you care about, don’t be tempted by ‘Charlotte Russe’ – a dwarf bush variety suitable for container growing: it looks grand enough, but you may as well eat your socks as the fruit.</p>
<p>However and whichever you grow, you’ll find mulberry’s lazy, irregular, slightly weeping spread quite magical. It has a characterful randomness to its shape that makes it stand out as a solo tree.</p>
<a>mulching</a> to exclude weed and grass competition for a metre around the trunk. If your
<a>garden has chalky soil</a>, grow your mulberry in a large container, as it will not thrive. Water through dry periods, especially when the tree is young or carrying fruit.
<p>Mulberries have <a>few pests or diseases</a>, but they can attract slugs in crazy numbers: a friend lost a six-year-old tree to their attentions while out of the country for a month; take whatever precautions you favour.</p>
<p>They require no ongoing pruning, but are susceptible to dieback – patches of younger growth that are killed off by cold – so snip these out once new growth gets under way.</p>
<p>A white mulberry with delicious, huge black fruit and is perhaps the best for edible leaves.</p>
<h2>‘Chelsea’ (aka King James) and ‘Wellington’ </h2>
<p>Excellent and the most widely available black mulberry varieties; ‘Repsime’ is a fine alternative, bearing very large fruit early in its life.</p>
<p>A fine Korean variety, and ideal where a smaller tree is required as it is naturally semi-dwarfing. Large and delicious sweet black berries.</p>
<h2>‘Black Tabor’</h2>
<p>Bears superb dark fruit and becomes productive earlier than most.</p>
<h2>‘Bistrica’</h2>
<p>A Bulgarian variety I haven’t tasted, but it is reputed to be very tasty, and bears fruit as early as the second year.</p>
<p>Make two lots – you’ll drink one before it’s at its best and because you don’t yet know how good it is after a year.</p>
<ul><li>Mulberries</li><li>Caster sugar</li><li>Vodka</li></ul>
<li>Pour caster sugar into your jar until it is 20 per cent full, then tip it out into a bowl.</li>
<li>Half fill the jar with mulberries, tip on the sugar, then top up with vodka.</li>
<li>Invert the jar a few times for a week to dissolve the sugar.</li>
<li>Sit on your hands for a year if you can.</li>
<p>Simple and delicious, and if you’re in a hurry bought meringues will do. Serves four.</p>
<ul><li>500g mulberries</li><li>350ml double cream</li></ul>
<ul><li>2 medium egg whites</li><li>100g caster sugar</li></ul>
<li>Preheat oven to 120C. Line a baking sheet with baking parchment.</li>
<li>To make the meringue, put the egg whites into a clean bowl and whisk until they form soft peaks. Add half the sugar and whisk it into the egg white.</li>
<li>Add the rest of the sugar and whisk until the mixture is thick, glossy and forms stiff peaks.</li>
<li>Spoon the meringue in islands over baking sheet, leaving room for expansion between each.</li>
<li>Place in centre of oven and bake for two hours. Meringues should be crisp on the outside and lift off paper easily. Leave to cool.</li>
<li>Any time up to an hour before you serve the pudding, whip the cream.</li>

<p>Since then I have heeded his excellent advice. In a perfect world, I would prefer to sow in September, but this is not always possible. <a>Turfing is an option</a>, but is far more expensive and often doesn’t give you the right seed mix.</p>
<p>A common cause of failure arises from sowing in spring. If we get a sudden dry snap after the grass has started to germinate (which is often not really visible) the vulnerable tiny plants shrivel up and die.</p>
<a>Safety Rubber Mat</a>. This not only protects the grass but also provides a safety surface. I find it invaluable.
<p>So that just leaves the moss invasion. Well, when you bring in the mower in spring, most will hopefully be out-competed by your thickly growing lawn - fingers crossed!</p>

<header> <h1> How to keep cut flowers alive: six clever gardening tips </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Sarah Raven <time> 1 July 2021 • 4:33pm </time> </div> </div>
<blockquote>The truth is cut flowers don't last forever, but garden expert Sarah Raven has some simple tricks for keeping them fresh and maximising their life span so you can enjoy them for longer.</blockquote>
<p>Any cut flower that looks floppy should have its stem ends seared in boiling water for 30 seconds. Give woody stems a bit longer – so bluebells only 10 seconds, whereas lilac needs one minute.</p>
<p>It has a miraculous effect on vase life. Even if they have flopped already, many flowers will make a total recovery after searing.</p>
<h3>2. Add flower food to water </h3>
<p>This is important. You can buy proprietary brands in sachets to sprinkle into the vase, or you can make your own.</p>
<p>It should contain some bleach or an acidifying agent, such as vinegar or lemon juice. The bleach or vinegar reduces the proliferation of bacteria.</p>
<h3>3. Make your own flower food</h3>
<p>Aspirin contains salicylic acid; lemonade contains sugar and citric acid. And bubbles are created by carbon dioxide, which forms dilute carbonic acid in water.</p>
<p>Proprietary flower food also includes sugar. The sugar feeds the flowers, but in my view, it feeds the bugs too. In our experiments at Perch Hill it seems to add to the vase life of sweet peas, but nothing else.</p>
<p>I always put a drop of bleach in water with strong-smelling plants such as alliums, cleomes and any brassicas, to prevent their characteristic pong from developing.</p>
<h3>4. The key to foolproof arrangements</h3>
<p>I like arranging stems through a noughts and crosses flower grid. This supports delicate flower heads (or those like camellias with short woody stems) and keeps them just out of the water in your favourite bowl.</p>
<p>For delicate small flowers like snowdrops, put a bunch of several stems through each square. For larger flowers, add just one to each.</p>
<p>It’s worth knowing that turquoise and acid green are both very flattering colours for flowers. Look out for vases in either of those colours. Pewter also looks wonderful – jugs, mugs, bowls and plates.</p>
<p>• <a>Five of the best vases for spring flowers</a></p>
<p>I always use florists’ scissors which have stronger blades than normal scissors and their fine tips are less cumbersome than secateurs for small-stemmed plants.</p>
<p>I use traditional metal milk pails for picking my flowers; they look good and are very durable. You can easily carry two, one slung over each arm. You need two; one filled with water for plunging cut flowers into, and the other for stripped leaves.</p>
<p>Floristry buckets are narrower (good for tulips) but they don’t have handles so you can only carry one at a time.</p>
<p>I also have pin-holders in several sizes, heavy metal discs with spikes on the upper surface to hold in place the stems that create the structure of your arrangements. I much prefer using them to Oasis (florists’ foam).</p>
<p>Waterproof glue-tack (called Florafix) is an absolute must-have. Use this to stick pin-holders to the bottom of a vase. You need to use this when both vase and pin-holder are clean and dry, or the stuff will not stick.</p>
<h3>6. Give your flowers a break</h3>
<p>All plants picked from the garden benefit from a rest before you arrange them. This means giving the flowers a few hours, or best of all, a night, in a bucket of water in a cool, dark place.</p>
<p>Fill the buckets with tepid, not ice-cold, water; the plants absorb it more easily. A rest increases vase life by a quarter or more.</p>

<div> <div> By Sarah Raven <time> 20 August 2021 • 3:51pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>At this time of year, many of us are looking to brighten up our homes with bouquets of fresh flowers that are bursting with colour. </p>
<p>But the truth is, whether purchased or picked, cut flowers don't last forever.</p>
<p>Here, gardening expert Sarah Raven has shared some of her simple tricks for keeping them fresh and healthy - meaning you can maximise their life span and enjoy them for longer.</p>

<header> <h1> The best trees for small gardens for privacy, flowers and colour </h1> <p> The time is right to take control of your garden and here is an expert guide on where to start </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Royal Horticultural Society <time> 24 August 2021 • 2:34pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Most trees reach ultimately at least 23ft (7m) tall and although most “garden trees” attain 30ft (10m) or more at maturity, there are many examples that stay smaller, in all shapes and sizes, evergreen and deciduous.</p>
<p>Here's a complete guide to the best trees for small gardens, so hopefully you can find one perfect for you.</p>
<p>Most gardens can find space for the smallest trees, under 30ft high at maturity. Here are three excellent examples that are great for proportion and decorative value.</p>
<li>Cercis canadensis 'Forest Pansy’ AGM, with large heart-shaped purple leaves, offers rich autumn colour.</li>
<li>Cornus kousa 'Miss Satomi’ AGM, with wondrous white early summer flowers followed by red dimpled fruits, reaches 18ft (6m) height and spread.</li>
<li>Sorbus vilmorinii AGM, 15ft (5m) height and spread, has delicate foliage with cream flowers followed by clusters of red berries that fade to white.</li>
<h2>Trees with a small footprint</h2>
<p>A valuable subsection of small trees are fastigiate (upright or columnar in form). They cast little shade and have a small “footprint”. Three good examples:</p>
<li>Sorbus 'Autumn Spire’ AGM, 24ft x 12ft (8m x 4m), has white flowers, yellow berries and fiery autumn foliage.</li>
<li>Prunus 'Amanogawa’ AGM is deservedly popular being reliably narrow at 26ft x 13ft (8m x 4m) and carrying masses of semi-double pale pink flowers.</li>
<li>Malus 'Adirondack’ AGM, 26ft x 13ft (8m x 4m), has white spring flowers and little red crab apples in autumn.</li>
<h2>Small trees with ornamental value</h2>
<p>For good ornamental value, trees with spring flowers and autumn colour are often the best choices:</p>
<li>Crataegus x lavalleei 'Carrierei’ AGM has white spring flowers, red autumn leaves and large long-lasting orange-red fruits.</li>
<li>Prunus 'Pandora’ AGM, 25ft (8m) height and spread, has pink spring flowers and bronzed young foliage that turns orange in autumn.</li>
<li>Arguably the finest flowering garden tree, Prunus 'Ukon’ AGM, 25ft (8m) height and spread, has yellow-white double flowers with a hint of pink. The bronzed young foliage turns red-brown in autumn.</li>
<p>In tight spots, a large shrub can fulfil many functions – shelter, privacy, wildlife benefit and some height – although it may not be possible to walk under their canopy.</p>
<li>One commonly used is Buddleja alternifolia AGM, with abundant summer flowers, which can be trained with a single stem into a 9ft (3m) “tree”.</li>
<li>Japanese maples are the best all-round performers of the large shrubs, the upright Acer palmatum 'Katsura’ AGM, for instance, can reach 13ft (4m).</li>
<h2>Three for year-round interest</h2>
<p>These trees each offer different forms and seasons of interest, so would make a useful partnership in a small space.</p>
<li>Paperbark maple (Acer griseum AGM) has rich peeling chestnut bark in winter, with a spreading habit (height and spread 30ft x 18ft, 10m x 6m), but casts light shade. Autumn leaf tints of orange and red are likely given warm days and crisp nights.</li>
<li>Amelanchier x grandiflora 'Robin Hill’ AGM is particularly upright (25ft x 12ft, 8m x 4m) with prolific pink spring flowers followed by bronze-tinted young leaves, dark purple berries in summer and fiery autumn colour.</li>
<li>Summer-flowering trees are few, but Koelreuteria paniculata 'Coral Sun’ AGM (18ft x 13ft, 6m x 4m) not only has yellow midsummer flowers, but also bright red young twigs, with yellow and orange leaves in autumn, and casts only light shade.</li>
<h2>Gardens with great trees</h2>
<a> tree lover </a>this is an inspiring collection.
<h2>Six of the best trees for small gardens</h2>
<li>Malus 'Laura’ Upright habit, red and white spring flowers, purple-tinted deciduous young leaves and dark red fruits that can be used for jelly (30ft x 12ft, 10m x 4m).</li>
<li>Acer campestre (field maple) A common deciduous native tree with delicate foliage. Yellow in autumn, with some red. Height and spread 18ft (6m)</li>
<li>Crataegus persimilis 'Prunifolia’ is a compact hawthorn with rounded deciduous leaves that turn red and orange in autumn. It bears numerous if short-lived red fruits and masses of white spring flowers (18ft x 12ft, 6m x 4m).</li>
<li>Eucalyptus pauciflora subsp. niphophila (snow gum) Evergreen with cream, grey and green flaky bark, narrow grey-green leaves and white flowers (24ft x 12ft, 8m x 4m).</li>
<li>Magnolia x loebneri 'Merrill’ Abundant white spring flowers. This deciduous tree lends itself to underplanting with spring bulbs and shade lovers (18ft x 18ft, 6m x 6m).</li>

<p>On the downside, there is a relatively narrow window of opportunity to sow and plant in spring. The limited planting time means that good planning is needed to plant at the right time. Planting is much more suitable for clay soils than sowing.</p>
<p>The self-digging aspect of clay soils makes them well suited to no-dig gardening. By avoiding digging and by mulching more, worm activity assists the drying cycles to make a very fertile soil.</p>
<p>The return of rain in autumn often creates a second <a>opportunity for planting</a> before the soil gets saturated and unworkable over winter. Clay soil is easily and seriously damaged by treading or working when wet.</p>
<p>Adding gypsum helps some but not all clays. Add on a small scale at first and watch for any clumping into crumbs – a sign of improving structure.</p>
<p>Although clay soil holds much moisture in summer, the water is so tightly bound to the tiny clay particles that plants cannot extract all the moisture present and may wilt even though the soil appears to be damp.</p>
<h2>Clay gardens to inspire</h2>
<p>RHS Garden Rosemoor has a mild climate but high rainfall. There are few opportunities to work clay in this wet climate. The raised bed and terraced vegetable garden overcomes this drawback. </p>
<p>The roses grow well and years of mulching have created a well-aerated surface zone where tree roots are always moist but never drowned.</p>
<p>Borde Hill lies in the intractable Wealden clay but roses love this soil. Magnificent trees and shrubs are also a feature. Unusually, the acid clay also supports an outstanding rhododendron collection.</p>

<p>I've also just bought a nice set of wirework shelves from antique shop <a>Branching Out</a> that I'll stock with <a>potted</a> herbs, so I don't spend the <a>cold evenings</a> playing hide and seek in the garden.</p>
<a>winter's</a> cold and bring cheer and flavour. So ring the changes and sing the praises of myrtle, hyssop and winter savoury. There's a whole world of hearty flavours in the herb garden. We just need the time and confidence to try them.
<p>If this sounds like something you'd like to get cracking on with during the colder months, pay attention to below and <a>grow</a> your garden full of herbs you can add to your cooking.</p>
<h2>Best herbs to grow in winter</h2>
<p><a>Hyssop </a>(Hyssopus officinalis) is a dense hardy perennial and member of the mint family, native of the sunny Mediterranean. In tiny quantities it's delicious with fish, meat and vegetables.</p>
<p>Over Christmas week, I bring small bunches of evergreen herbs into the house to dress the kitchen table and enjoy their lovely smells, and to have them close to hand for festive dishes.</p>
<a>Nordic House</a> has a wide variety of candles in stock. I love its sparkly birch bark-covered ones, and also its set of grey birch bark planters.
<a>)</a>. Woody herbs like rosemary, thyme and sage taste good in olive oil with a twist of lemon peel. Store in a fridge once opened.
<p>Bay leaves coated in chocolate make excellent decorations for cakes and puddings.</p>
