<p>It may have been bad news for the Swordfish Inn in Penzance, but it could be good news for Exeter and England as wing Jack Nowell has not just gone for Dry January, but giving up alcohol altogether.</p>
<p>His recovery from injury and regaining of form is an illustration of Exeter’s resurgence as last season’s Premiership finalists started the climb from mid-table to the fringe of the play-off places with this 19-13 win over Bristol.</p>
<p>With Nowell combining well with full-back Stuart Hogg, there were signs Exeter were regaining the cutting edge which made them – along with Harlequins – the record-making Premiership try scorers in 2021 with 113.</p>
<p>This season’s tally of 33 is well below that rate – ninth in the Premiership listings before this round of games – but that may be another area where Exeter are about to move upwards.</p>
<p>“I have stopped drinking,” explained Nowell. “I am not saying that I was a big drinker but rugby players, especially our team, we enjoy going out for a few beers after each game.</p>
<p>“Sometimes that leads onto going into town and early mornings, but I have completely cut that out. It was slowing me down a little bit with recovery on a Monday and Tuesday, it was taking me longer.</p>
<p>“I am getting a bit older as well. It is not just down to that but I think it has been a big thing, dropping weight has been big for me and the way the team have been managing me has been pretty good as well.”</p>
<p>“I stopped at the start of the season, Leicester away was obviously the first game of the season for us, we had a few on the bus coming home, we got a bit carried away, I tore my hammy that week and I was out for another three or four weeks.</p>
<p>“I thought enough is enough, I want to get on the field and I want to play. My body is probably the best I have felt in a long, long time. The fact I have been able to play back-to-back games now is really positive for me.</p>
<p>“I have lost about 10kg from the final last year. I am back down to about 90 kg now and I am feeling good, feeling light and that is definitely my playing weight.”</p>
<p>Nowell has had a few niggly injuries, hamstrings, toes – too many for him to remember them all – but England coach Jones has not forgotten the all-action contribution the wing can make on the international stage.</p>
<p>“Eddie has always been in touch with me,” said Nowell. “He has spoken to me before each camp and he is awesome.</p>
<p>Exeter, too, will be pleased to be showing signs of getting back to where they are used to be at the top of the table, making up for an out-of-character start to the season.</p>
<p>“We obviously stuttered with a lot of guys out so it was disjointed and a couple of steps forward and then a step back,” admitted Exeter assistant coach Ali Hepher, whose team are now fifth in the table and one point from the top four.</p>
<p>“We have started to put together some performances, especially winning at home, so it is pleasing to get that in the bank as we prepare to go to Harlequins and hopefully produce a performance to get us back up the league.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bristol remain in the unfamiliar position of 12th in the table despite the losing bonus-point on Saturday and against table-topping Leicester.</p>
<p>“When you are where we are it is about getting the simple things done really well, putting bodies on the line and repeating it, so everyone knows what we need and they just have to step up to it.”</p>
<h2>Report: Exeter beginning to rediscover form of old with win over below-par Bristol</h2>
<h2>Exeter 19-13 Bristol </h2>
<p>After a festive period when it was announced Exeter had lost two international players for next season, it was the one who didn’t get away who won this as Stuart Hogg sealed victory.</p>
<p>After Bristol had pulled the scoreline back to just two points, it was Scotland captain who scored the match-winning try in a man-of-the match performance after confirming he will see out his contract at Exeter when a return north was rumoured.</p>
<p>His side’s third try also gave a record home crowd the chance to celebrate, providing signs Exeter are beginning to rediscover the pattern which took them to the top of England and Europe.</p>
<p>“It was pleasing the character we showed when we did concede the try and you could really go in freefall from then. We were strong and got straight back on the attack,” said assistant coach Ali Hepher.</p>
<p>“We scored the all-important try which saw us home. We would like to do it a bit cleaner but it was a massive movement forward, especially in terms of our attack with the intent first half.</p>
<p>“We simplified things, ran hard in the first half, created numerous opportunities, we have just got to now be clinical, which is all part of building confidence and level of performance right through the season.”</p>
<p>Bristol could take consolation from the losing bonus point in another game where they battled all the way, but with confidence low they were unable to take the chances which could have changed the complexion of the game.</p>
<p>“I think in the context we will take that point, most teams would have taken it and there was a chance of losing it as well.</p>
<p>“If we were not showing up in the areas we need to show up then it would be lack of confidence, but it showed we have not lost confidence.”</p>
<p>The fans in that East Stand were brought into the action early as Exeter attacked towards their side, wing Jack Nowell putting a kick through for Hogg to regather and put wing Tom O’Flaherty into the corner for those fans to enjoy.</p>
<p>Exeter’s commitment to the salary cap was tested over Christmas with the news that second rows Jonny Hill and Sam Skinner are both off to pastures new next season.</p>
<p>Bristol had suffered a blow midway through the first half as star full back Charles Piutau limped off injured before he had been able to make an impression on the game.</p>
<p>That applied to most of his team-mates too in the first half and they would have been relieved to get to the break just 12-3 down after Exeter failed to apply the finishing touches on a few occasions.</p>
<p>A change of forward personnel shortly into the second half brought a change of fortune for the visitors, but crucially the Exeter forwards were able to defend their line and then win the ball to clear the pressure.</p>
<p>When Bristol did get back on the scoresheet it came from further out and thanks to slack Exeter play as replacement full back Harry Purdie snatched a Joe Simmons pass and went fifty yards unopposed for the try.</p>
<p>After Hogg had put Exeter back in control the visitors chose to take a Sheedy penalty to get the losing bonus point. Regaining confidence can be a long process, but maybe that point was a small part of the process.</p>
<p>Exeter’s loyal and increased band of fans could consolation in a powerful performance which promised more than it delivered and for the fact the cutting edge of Hogg will be in view at Sandy Park for a while longer.</p>
<p>Scoring sequence; 13 min O’Flaherty try 5-0, 14 min J Simmons con 7-0, 19 min Sheedy pen 7-3, 31 min Hill try 12-3, 70 min Purdie try 12-8, 71 min Sheedy con 12-10, 75 Hogg try 17-10, 74 J Simmons con 19-10, 79 Sheedy pen 19-13.</p>

<p>Joe Root called for a reaction from his players to their defeat in Adelaide and they responded by serving up an even worse performance on a desperate first day of the third Test.</p>
<p>Root was as much to blame as anyone else. He thumped his bat angrily moments after edging behind for 50; gifting his wicket and failing for the ninth time to convert a half century into the full monty in Australia. </p>
<p>The players wore black armbands in memory of Raymond Illingworth and it is not hard to imagine what he would have thought - and said to the players - about some of the shots played. </p>

<h2>Australia vs England, third Ashes Test as it happened:</h2>
<h3>That's all from me but...</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Read Nick Hoult's above report from Melbourne for a full recap of another disastrous day for England. Join us tomorrow for more live coverage of the third Ashes Test.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>That was the perfect day for Australia</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>England fail to reach 200 and Australia score 60 quick runs before close for just one wicket down. The Ashes are getting further and further away from Joe Root's grasp.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>STUMPS! OVER 16: AUS 61/1 (Harris 20* Lyon 0*)</h3>
<p>Stokes goes short at Harris, striking him on the glove. He uses that to waste some time, getting the physio out onto the field as close approaches. There is some blood coming from his fingers, in fairness. His fingers were trapped on the handle.</p>
<p>The over resumes. Short leg in place. Harris survives the next three balls as Stokes angle the ball into Harris from around the wicket. A play and miss from a full ball outside off stump follows.</p>
<p>The last ball of the day is edged, landing short of gully and running away for four.</p>
<h3>OVER 15: AUS 57/1 (Harris 16* Lyon 0*)</h3>
<p>Australia have sent out Lyon to be night watchman with 10 minutes left in the day. Play and miss from his first ball. He is then hit on the pads but Lyon was outside the line. The next three balls are blocked solidly. </p>
<div> <h3>WICKET! Warner c Crawley b Anderson 38</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Anderson draws Warner forward, who edges the ball to gully. Crawley takes a good low catch. England needed that badly!</p> <p>FOW: 57/1</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>7:18AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 15: AUS 57/0 (Harris 16* Warner 38*)</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Anderson returns to the attack after an underwhelming first spell.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 14: AUS 57/0 (Harris 16* Warner 38*)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Stokes is into the attack. He starts around the wicket to Harris who blocks his first ball. The next ball is short and Harris cuts it away. Good comeback, full ball drawing a play and miss.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 13: AUS 53/0 (Harris 12* Warner 38*)</h3>
<div> <div> <p>Robinson serves up a leg stump half-volley which Warner clips for three, bringing up Australia's 50 in quick time. Harris works a single. Robinson is now over the wicket to Warner, delivering a no-ball. Five from the over.</p> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 12: AUS 48/0 (Harris 11* Warner 35*)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Wood is all over Warner, hitting him in the stomach again. He backs away from the next ball, blocking it into the off side. Warner cuts fine for three after making room. Harris plays out the over.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 11: AUS 45/0 (Harris 11* Warner 32*)</h3>
<p>England have not bowled well so far besides Wood. Can Robinson get it right this over with 30 minutes left in the day?</p>
<p>He is around the wicket to Warner, hitting him on the pad and a half-appeal is turned down. Robinson drops short and is punished for four. Warner is struck on the pad, but a thin inside edge saves him. A single ends the over.</p>
<h3>OVER 10: AUS 40/0 (Harris 11* Warner 27*)</h3>
<div> <div> <p>Wood beats Warner once more. Too quick. He rides the bounce to get off strike next ball. He looks pleased to be down the other end. Harris flashes at one outside off stump. Play and miss. A ducked bouncer ends the over.</p> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 9: AUS 39/0 (Harris 11* Warner 26*)</h3>
<p>Warner is flying, here. 26 off 24 balls.</p>
<p>Robinson goes around the wicket to Harris who clips two to finish the over.</p>
<h3>OVER 8: AUS 33/0 (Harris 8* Warner 23*)</h3>
<h3>OVER 7: AUS 25/0 (Harris 8* Warner 15*)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Anderson continues. He is just a fraction short and Warner pushes a single into the off side. Harris latches onto a short ball, pulling it just short of the man at mid-wicket. No run.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 6: AUS 24/0 (Harris 8* Warner 14*)</h3>
<p>Wood is into the attack. He is around the wicket to Warner who blocks the first two balls of the over. An absolute snorter at over 90mph beats Warner all ends up. It was angled in and nipped away.</p>
<p>Warner rocks onto the back foot and pulls three through mid-wicket. Harris turns one around the corner and it lands just short of Leach at leg gully. </p>
<h3>OVER 5: AUS 21/0 (Harris 8* Warner 11*)</h3>
<p>Anderson starts his third over with a good delivery just outside off stump that Warner leaves well. Warner rocks back, cutting through cover-point for four. It was just a tad short and wide. Runs are flowing as Warner flicks a single off his hips.</p>
<h3>OVER 4: AUS 16/0 (Harris 8* Warner 6*)</h3>
<p>Robinson is full to Warner from over the wicket who pushes the ball for no run. He drops a touch short and Warner carves it over the slip cordon for four. A leg bye gets Warner off strike.</p>
<p>Harris inside edges it onto his pad, the ball landing safely with no short leg in place.</p>
<h3>OVER 3: AUS 11/0 (Harris 8* Warner 2*)</h3>
<p>Warner takes a very sharp single from his first ball. He dropped and ran, Harris just getting home. Harris returns the favour, this time a more comfortable quick single. Another single follows.</p>
<p>Anderson shapes one back into Harris who leaves it well. England have not got it right so far.</p>
<h3>OVER 2: AUS 8/0 (Harris 7* Warner 0*)</h3>
<p>Robinson will open from the other end. He starts with a gentle half-volley on leg stump which is flicked for two. A better line is found, Harris leaving the ball outside off stump. Robinson bowls a no-ball. </p>
<h3>OVER 1: AUS 5/0 (Harris 5* Warner 0*)</h3>
<p>England need early wickets to stay in this Test and the series. It is still decent conditions for bowling with plenty of cloud cover and grass on the pitch. Anderson will start to Harris, who is in need of some runs.</p>
<p>The first ball is full, swinging away from the left-handed Harris from over the wicket. And repeat. Harris blocks the ball into the offside for no run, playing another defensive shot from the following delivery. </p>
<p>Harris times a clip through mid-wicket for four. That raced away! He plays the same shot but only collects one, pinching the strike.</p>
<h3>England bowled out for under 200 once again</h3>
<div><div> <div> <blockquote><p>England all out for under 200 for the 13th time in Test cricket in 2021, in 28 innings</p>— Tim Wigmore (@timwig) December 26, 2021</blockquote> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>England all out for 185</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>That was a disappointing effort given a number of bad dismissals. Some lower order resistance from Leach and Robinson saved England from a truly embarrassing total.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>WICKET! Robinson c Boland b Lyon 22</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Robinson tries to take on the deep fielders, but picks out Boland after coming down the track.</p> <p>FOW: 185/10</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>

<h3>OVER 65: 185/9 (Anderson 0* Robinson 22*)</h3>
<p>Robinson is on strike and may as well have a go with only one wicket left and Anderson down the other end.</p>
<p>A bouncer is sent down but Robinson leaves it well alone. Starc then goes full and Robinson takes one, leaving Anderson one ball to negotiate. A tentative leave sees England's innings extend to another over.</p>
<h3>OVER 64: 176/9 (Anderson 0* Robinson 13*)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>James Anderson comes to the crease with three ball remaining in Lyon's over. He blocks the first, punches the second for no run and blocks the third.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>WICKET! Leach c Smith b Lyon 13</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Lyon tosses it up, getting some turn and bounce which takes the edge of Leach's bat. Smith takes a simple catch at slip. A fun innings ends.</p> <p>FOW: 176/9</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a><time>5:56AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 64: 176/8 (Leach 13* Robinson 13*)</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Robinson is now down the track to Lyon, pushing him for one. Leach blocks Lyon. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Here is Leach hitting Lyon for six!</h3>
<div> <div> <blockquote><p>Spinner vs SpinnerJack Leach on the attack against his opposite number 💪💪#Ashes pic.twitter.com/04gcDaPYGT</p>— Cricket on BT Sport (@btsportcricket) <a>December 26, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 63: 175/8 (Leach 13* Robinson 12*)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Starc goes full to Leach who flicks a well ran two. He continues full and Leach plays it out sensibly. Surely a short ball is coming? Here it is, but Leach ducks it well. A play and miss concludes the over.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 62: 173/8 (Leach 11* Robinson 12*)</h3>
<p>Leach fancies a bit of Lyon here! 11 off the over. </p>
<h3>OVER 61: 162/8 (Leach 0* Robinson 12*)</h3>
<p>Starc goes at the body of Robinson who chips it in the air. It would have gone straight to silly point but none was in place. Robinson collects two leg byes. Starc goes short at Robinson who gets out the way of successive deliveries.</p>
<p>England survive the over.</p>
<h3>OVER 60: 160/8 (Leach 0* Robinson 12*)</h3>
<p>Robinson has batted really nicely today, fulfilling some of the talent he clearly has. His first-class record is good for a bowler but he has looked all at sea with the bat for a while with England.</p>
<p>Lyon is on. Robinson blocks him twice before lofting a single out to long-on who is 20 yards off the boundary.</p>
<p>Lyon is around the wicket to the left-handed Leach. He comes down the track, flicking for no run.</p>
<h3>OVER 59: 159/8 (Leach 0* Robinson 11*)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Out strides the recalled Jack Leach, with two balls left in Starc's over. A nasty in-swinging yorker is just deflected over the stumps. He leaves the next ball.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>WICKET! Bairstow c Green b Starc 35</h3>
<div> <p>Starc goes short, cramping up Bairstow who deflects the ball to Green at gully. It was a good diving catch by the all-rounder. Bairstow has to get up from the floor and drag himself off. He was looking dangerous!</p> <p>FOW: 159/8</p> </div>
<h3>OVER 59: 159/7 (Bairstow 35* Robinson 11*)</h3>
<div> <div> <p>Starc is into the attack, replacing Cummins. He is full and Robinson drives the ball back past him for three. He is looking in fine touch today!</p> <p>Bairstow creams a drive through the covers for four. Top shot.</p> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 58: 152/7 (Bairstow 31* Robinson 8*)</h3>
<p>Bairstow takes a single from the first ball of Boland's over. Robinson plays a lovely drive through mid-off for four. Beautiful timing. He then clips the ball through square leg for three with a flamboyant flamingo whip. 150 up!</p>
<p>Bairstow hands him back the strike. Robinson pinches the strike with a flick to fine leg. 10 from the over!</p>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>5:28AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Scott Boland celebrates his first Test wicket</h3> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 57: 142/7 (Bairstow 29* Robinson 0*)</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Boland gets a huge round of applause as he heads down to fine leg. Bairstow plays out two dots before pulling Cummins for one. Robinson plays out the remainder of the over.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>5:22AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 56: 141/7 (Bairstow 28* Robinson 0*)</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Robinson has one ball to negotiate from Boland's over. And he does.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>WICKET! Wood lbw Boland 6</h3>
<p>Boland has his first Test wicket! He is full to Wood, shaping the ball into the right-hander and hitting him on the knee roll. After a long pause, the finger is raised by Paul Reiffel. That looked out but Wood reviews!</p>
<p>Was there bat involved? Wood hits it, but it is just pad before bat. On to ball tracking and the ball is indeed hitting the stumps!</p>
<div> <h3>OVER 56: 141/6 (Bairstow 28* Wood 6*)</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Boland continues. Bairstow looks to pull a short-ish delivery but it the ball loops over his bat. He then works a single into the leg side.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 55: 140/6 (Bairstow 27* Wood 6*)</h3>
<p>Wood connects with a pull shot for two runs - not sure he was looking at the ball when he hit it, mind...</p>
<h3>OVER 54: 138/6 (Bairstow 27* Wood 4*)</h3>
<div> <p>WinViz currently have England at 17 per cent chance of winning - seems generous. Very generous.</p> <p>The debutant Boland is back. A nip-backer takes the inside edge of Bairstow, just missing leg stump and racing away for four.</p> </div>
<h3>OVER 53: 134/6 (Bairstow 23* Wood 4*)</h3>
<p>Cummins will start the session from the other end. Short leg in place to Wood who inside edges the ball past that fielder to get off strike. Bairstow hands it back to him.</p>
<h3>OVER 52: 132/6 (Bairstow 22* Wood 3*)</h3>
<p>Lyon will complete the over he started before tea. Four balls to come. He is around the wicket to Bairstow who takes a single... but it is not Robinson who will face, Wood has been promoted to No 8! Interesting move.</p>
<p>Wood will play with aggression. He drives his first ball nicely through the overs for three.</p>
<h3>Bairstow may look to counter after tea</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>He has not got much left to support him with Robinson at No 8. Robinson has looked poor with the bat this series although he does have some talent. It would be handy if he showed it now.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Here is Buttler's poor dismissal</h3>
<div> <blockquote><p>Jos Buttler goes looking to counter-attack ❌Tea is taken and England are 128-6 ☕️#Ashes pic.twitter.com/rBXlZhXM6T</p>— Cricket on BT Sport (@btsportcricket) <a>December 26, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>
<h3>TEA! ENG 128/6 (Bairstow 21* Robinson 0*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Well, that session has not gone well for England. Root, Stokes and Buttler all falling to questionable dismissals. England desperately need Robinson to hang around with Bairstow after tea.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>WICKET! Buttler c Boland b Lyon 3</h3>
<div> <div> <p>Oh dear. What are you doing, Jos. The last over before tea, Buttler comes down the track and hits it down Boland's throat at deep mid-wicket. Poor batting. England in serious trouble once again.</p> <p>FOW: 128/6</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>OVER 52: ENG 128/5 (Bairstow 21* Buttler 3*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Change before tea, Lyon will have a crack. He starts outside off stump, not much turn from that delivery.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 51: ENG 128/5 (Bairstow 21* Buttler 3*) </h3>
<p>We have reached the time in the day when the Barmy Army becomes more vocal, unperturbed by the position of England on the pitch.</p>
<p>Cummins probes at off stump, Bairstow is up to the task. There is a slight hold up as a pitch invader makes their way onto the pitch. Not long until tea now.</p>
<h3>OVER 50: ENG 128/5 (Bairstow 21* Buttler 3*) </h3>
<p>Starc continues. A full length cannot draw any swing. Bairstow attempts a cut shot but it is too straight. No run.</p>
<p>Bairstow cuts again, this time lofting it over the slips for three. </p>
<p>This is a crucial partnership for England, especially with no Chris Woakes to come in next. Both players look in decent touch at this stage.</p>
<h3>OVER 49: ENG 125/5 (Bairstow 18* Buttler 3*) </h3>
<p>It is a double change as Australia sense there is blood in the water following the Stokes wicket. Cummins brings himself into the attack, Buttler playing him cautiously. </p>
<p>Buttler gets off the mark with a clip through mid-wicket for a well ran three. Cummins goes short to Bairstow who wisely ducks out the way. He then works a single. </p>
<h3>OVER 48: ENG 121/5 (Bairstow 17* Buttler 0*) </h3>
<p>Morning everyone. Starc is back into the attack and the first ball of his spell is inside edged away for a quick two by Bairstow. The left-armer hurries Bairstow with a short ball that is gloved for a welcome boundary. Plenty of life in this pitch.</p>
<p>Bairstow plays out the rest of the over.</p>
<h3>OVER 47: ENG 115/5 (Bairstow 11* Buttler 0*) </h3>
<div> <div> <p>Jos Buttler is beaten all ends up first cherry, by a ball that nips back and whistles over the top of his middle stump.</p> <p>Excellent over, England really up against it. I am handing you over to Jake. Cheers.</p> </div> </div>
<h3>WICKET! Stokes c Lyon b Green 25</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>4:10AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 46: ENG 115/4 (Stokes 25* Bairstow 11*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Another tidy maiden from Lyon.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 45: ENG 115/4 (Stokes 25* Bairstow 11*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Decent stuff from Green. He's drawn a false shot from Stokes, a risky drive. The Aussies have got England becalmed, hardly a run since that mini-attack on Lyon a few overs ago.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 44: ENG 115/4 (Stokes 25* Bairstow 11*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Lyon-o continues, Bairstow looking to work/sweep/nudge to leg. Gets hold of a full-bodied sweep and it hits short leg on the boot! Luckily it doesn't look anywhere catchable.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <a><time>4:00AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 43: ENG 114/4 (Stokes 24* Bairstow 11*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Green tries each of England's ginger heroes out with a bouncer, neither seems too rattled.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>3:57AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 42: ENG 113/4 (Stokes 23* Bairstow 11*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Both Stokes and Bairstow looking to be proactive against Lyon.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 41: ENG 111/4 (Stokes 22* Bairstow 10*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>David Gower: "once the new ball went, and the sun came out, this looks a flat pitch."</p> <p>Cameron Green is coming back for another spell. Begins it with a maiden.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 40: ENG 110/4 (Stokes 22* Bairstow 10*) </h3>
<p>Both Bairstow and Stokes look to get after Lyon! YJB slog sweeps him for a hard-run three. And now Ben clatters him into the stands at long-on! Ha! Most fun moment of the day. Not a strong field, for England fans.</p>
<p>Anyway, perhaps drinks will cheer us all up a little bit more.</p>
<h3>OVER 39: ENG 101/4 (Stokes 16* Bairstow 7*) </h3>
<div> <div> <p>Bairstow inside-edges Starc, a whisker away from chopping it onto his own stumps. Stokes tucks the ball off his pads for four. Now Stokes bludgeons the ball at a fielder in the covers. First signs of aggression from Ben?</p> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>OVER 38: ENG 95/4 (Stokes 12* Bairstow 5*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Nathan Lyon returns. Bairstow plays him well, assertive and positive in his defence. Just one off the over.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>3:33AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 37: ENG 95/4 (Stokes 12* Bairstow 5*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Bairsow smears a wide ball over the slips for a chancey two. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>I was wondering what this noise was!</h3>

<h3>OVER 36: ENG 89/4 (Stokes 9* Bairstow 2*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Unusual technique from YJB as well. He's turned front on and kind of walked down the pitch to play Boland, like a man playing French cricket on the move. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>OVER 35: ENG 87/4 (Stokes 8* Bairstow 1*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Starc continues. Bairstow is off the mark with one off the hip. Stokes has doubled his score with a swivel pull four.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 34: ENG 82/4 (Stokes 4* Bairstow 0*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Stokes is using his feet to a huge degree v Boland. Almost bizarrely so. Hit on the pads again about 30 feet outside the crease.</p> <p>Bairstow, the new man, watches all this from the other end.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>OVER 33: ENG 82/4 (Stokes 4*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>So yet another 50 for Joe, and yet another not hundred. Extra pace of Starc? Who knows. Joe had looked in control all day.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>WICKET! Root c Carey b Starc 50</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Oh that's a shocker. Dear me. Starc has barely got one on target all day, and this one is wide and nondescript. Root slashes at it, edges behind. Nothing ball nothing shot. FOW 82/4</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 32: ENG 82/3 (Root 50* Stokes 4*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Root clips Boland for a single that brings up yet another fifty but it hardly needs saying that he wants a lot more than that today. Stokes strides down the pitch to Boland and is hit in front but miles down.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 31: ENG 81/3 (Root 49* Stokes 4*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Starc to Stokes. Some sort of noise as this goes past him - some Aussies appeal. Think it was the pad strap? Not a big appeal, and soon quashed.</p> <p>Also in this over, Stokes nudges to cover for three.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 30: ENG 77/3 (Root 48* Stokes 1*) </h3>
<h3>OVER 29: ENG 67/3 (Root 38* Stokes 1*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Mitchell Starc. Seems to be moving okay. Driven down the ground for three by Joe Root. Digs a ball in at Stokes who seems to struggle in his bid to evade it. Wears that.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>OVER 28: ENG 64/3 (Root 35* Stokes 1*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Boland's over is interrupted by a plastic bag floating in the breeze. Sun is definitely coming out there, looks most pleasant now.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 27: ENG 61/3 (Root 33* Stokes 0*) </h3>
<div> <p>(Completing the over that he was bowling before lunch...) Cummins to Stokes. Uses the feet well first ball. Cummins now says howdy to Stokes with a horror ball! Climbs spitefully and Ben has to jerk his head back out of the way.</p> </div>
<div> <p>looked to have twinged his back in that morning session. Will he bowl? We will know soon enough.</p> <p>The players are out, and the sun has come out as well. Ben Stokes will face the remaining three balls of the Cummins over.</p> </div>
<p>Nick Hoult's lunch analysis:</p>
<p>New faces, same old story. England changed their opener Rory Burns for Zak Crawley but it made little difference as Australia grabbed three wickets in the first session of the Boxing Day Test.</p>
<p>Haseeb Hameed recorded the 50th duck of the year by an England player, Crawley made 12 and Dawid Malan edged to slip in the last over before lunch as a refreshed Pat Cummins took all three wickets.</p>

<h3>Lunch: England 61/3 (Root 33*) off 26.3 </h3>
<p>They walk off. Malan gutted, he had fought hard this morning to help his skipper steady the ship. But he could not make it to the interval and Root is, once again, the man on whom it all rests. Cummins superb, taking all three.</p>
<p>Australia won't mind the scoreboard at all. I guess the idea that this pitch was a green top seamer's dream was a little bit over-sold. But anyway, three wickets in the first session represents a very satisfactory return.</p>
<h3>WICKET! Malan c Warner b Cummins 14</h3>
<div> <h3>OVER 26: ENG 60/2 (Malan 14* Root 32*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Lyon into his fifth over, Root with an attractive back-cut for a single. Probably deserved a bit more. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 25: ENG 59/2 (Malan 14* Root 31*) </h3>
<div> <div> <p>Ooh a near squeak there. Lovely ball from Cummins, edge from Malan. Dies a yard short of Warner at first slip. Thought that kept a tiny bit low myself.</p> <p>The ball after it carries through at chest height...</p> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 24: ENG 58/2 (Malan 14* Root 30*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>This ball from Lyon juuuust holds up in the pitch, creating a suggestion of a leading edge from Root. Three singles in the over. England must must must get through to lunch, at the top of the hour.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 23: ENG 55/2 (Malan 13* Root 28*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Cummins with an excellent bouncer, snaky and accurate. Played pretty well by Dawid.</p> <p>Dunno where Starc is. He was pony in his opening spell, not sure if he will have another dart before lunch. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>1:45AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 22: ENG 53/2 (Malan 11* Root 28*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Lyon to Root, he has got a slip and a short leg. Couple of singles off the over.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 21: ENG 51/2 (Malan 10* Root 27*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>These guys are getting in now. Root and Malan each drive Cummins straight for a handy three. Huge outfield here of course. Trio of singles to go with it.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>OVER 20: ENG 42/2 (Malan 6* Root 22*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Lyon settling to his work, which is not a great sign. Malan cuts him to a fielder.</p> <p>Pat Cummins brings himself back on for the next over...</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 19: ENG 42/2 (Malan 6* Root 22*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Root is really using his feet nicely against Green, he's not allowing him to dictate. Malan crunched a drive square in this over but that man Lyon-o was there with a good stop. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>1:30AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 18: ENG 38/2 (Malan 5* Root 20*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Some turn for Lyon, and a threatening arm-ball in there. Malan sees out a maiden.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>OVER 17: ENG 38/2 (Malan 5* Root 20*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Root is moving his feet well, looking to keep Green where he wants him. Playing this well.</p> <p>Nathan Lyon is coming on for a spell...</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 16: ENG 36/2 (Malan 5* Root 18*) </h3>
<div> <h3>OVER 15: ENG 36/2 (Malan 5* Root 18*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Green now. Tidy stuff from this bulky man, bowling the channels well and he certainly puts the ball there with some feeling.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>1:14AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 14: ENG 35/2 (Malan 4* Root 18*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Root guides a ball from Boland through gully for four. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>OVER 13: ENG 31/2 (Malan 4* Root 14*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Big Cameron Green is coming on for a bowl. Malan treats him watchfully. It's time for drinks. Double hemlocks all round for England.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 12: ENG 31/2 (Malan 4* Root 14*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Cummins into his sixth over. Good duel between him and Root. Goes without saying that the Aussie skipper knows that if he can shift the English captain, the rest should follow pretty tamely.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 11: ENG 29/2 (Malan 4* Root 12*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Malan is off the mark after a long sojourn on 0, edging the ball through the gully for a boundary. Bit streaky, although he did play with soft hands.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 10: ENG 22/2 (Malan 0* Root 9*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Cummins with the ball of the day. Swings in, straightens away, from a perfect length at high pace. Root beaten, smiles and says fair play. Clips the next delivery away for three off the toes.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 9: ENG 19/2 (Malan 0* Root 6*) </h3>
<p>15 of those 50 ducks this year have been from openers.</p>
<p>Boland is getting the ball to nip back. He's caught root on the inner thigh, and now again on the front of the thigh. And another one. They really do seem to be keen on hitting poor Joe in the knackers.</p>
<p>Root flicks the ball off his pads for four. Looking busy and bright as always.</p>
<h3>OVER 8: ENG 14/2 (Malan 0* Root 1*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Double frustrating for England to be two down for spit, in that the Aussies haven't even bowled that well.</p> <p>Joe Root knocks the ball into the infield and scurries one. Over to you, Joe. Once again.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>WICKET! Crawley c Green b Cummins 12</h3>
<p>Oh dear. That's the second opener back in the hutch. Crawley squared up, the bat coming down across the line, the edge goes to the gully. Decent catch. Technique just all over the show. FOW 13/2</p>
<p>Ramprakash: "The bat is coming from fourth slip, not a huge surprise to see a dismissal in that fashion."</p>
<h3>OVER 7: ENG 12/1 (Crawley 11* Malan 0*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Scott Boland comes on for his first over in Tests. Keeps the ball fairly full. I thought one ball did a tiny bit through the air, perhaps. Crawley pushes the ball into the covers for a single.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <a><time>12:31AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 6: ENG 12/1 (Crawley 11* Malan 0*) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>A two and a three for Zak Crawley, Malan leaves the rest. The England pair handling Cummins fairly well.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 5: ENG 7/1 (Crawley 6* Malan 0*) </h3>
<h3>OVER 4: ENG 4/1 (Crawley 3* Malan 0*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Cummins nibbles the ball back in and hits Malan high, too high, on the pad. A maiden over.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>A thin edge behind and Haseeb Hameed goes in the second over.The Australian captain doesn't take long to get back in the groove 💪#Ashes pic.twitter.com/lpstZ4W7Gf</p>— Cricket on BT Sport (@btsportcricket)
<h3>OVER 3: ENG 4/1 (Crawley 3* Malan 0*) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Starc too wide, and also short enough that it can be left without too much worry. Crawley though with a huge mow at the ball outside off. Misses it, happily for him.</p> </div> </div> </div>

<p>The Ashes Boxing Day Test starts soon. So hello, good evening and welcome to our live blog of Australia versus England in the third match of the series; the action comes to you from the Melbourne Cricket Ground.</p>
<p>I’m Alan Tyers, and I am looking forward to talking you through the first few hours of play. Things should brighten up for y’all at around tea time, when my splendid colleague Mr Jake Goodwill joins us.</p>
<p>England also toss Jack Leach back into the fray. Well, good luck son.</p>
<p>Their fourth and final change and, hopefully, the one that will shake things up a bit, is to bring back quickie Mark Wood. Stuart Broad and Chris Woakes are the fellows who will be putting their trotters up.</p>
<a> a lovely tribute</a> to the Yorkshire offie.

<header> <h1> Stuart Broad given two Tests to prove he has an England future </h1> <p> Broad is back in England's XI for Sydney Test while Ben Stokes has been frustrated by his performances so far in series </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Isabelle Westbury in Sydney <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:04am </time> </div> </div>
<p>England are to give Stuart Broad the rest of this Ashes series to prove he has a long-term future in Test cricket. </p>
<p>Broad, 35, has been restored to England’s starting XI for the fourth Test in Sydney, which starts tonight, as replacement for Ollie Robinson, who is rested following three back-to-back matches leading into the new year.</p>
<p>The veteran seam bowler indicated in his newspaper column last weekend that he would weigh up his future at the end of the current, and expressed disappointment with his treatment in Australia.</p>
<p>Broad's frustrations at his fortunes in Australia are matched by Stokes. The talismanic all-rounder has scored just 101 runs in six innings to-date, and only taken four wickets at an average of 62.</p>
<p>“We’ve let guys do their normal thing,” continued Thorpe. “Just talking to them, making sure that they’re in that right frame of mind. Tried to encourage them to go to the beach, go for a swim.”</p>
<h2>Listen: Sir Geoffrey Boycott's latest Ashes briefing</h2>
<header> <div> <div> <h1> England take two late Australian wickets on rain-interrupted first day of fourth Ashes Test </h1> </div> </div> </header>
<ul> <li>Australia vs England, fourth Test: full scoreboard from Sydney</li> <li><b>Australia end day one on 126/3 after winning toss</b></li> <li><b>Day interrupted by rain but England take two wickets in final session</b></li> </ul>
<p>Mark Wood will admit himself he does not take as many wickets as a bowler with his pace should but he has developed a happy knack of knocking over the world’s no 1 ranked batsman.</p>
<p>Marnus Labuschagne elbowed Joe Root off the top of the ICC rankings after the Adelaide Test. It was not the lowest blow Root suffered in that game but it was a punch in the guts nevertheless given his run scoring feats in 2021. </p>
<p>He bowled at an average pace of 91.8mph, the second quickest of his career, and his reward was knocking over Labuschagne shortly before the final rain showercut short play after 46.5 overs with Australia 126 for three.</p>
<p>A lovely little Aussie dig at England’s selection there. Broad was back here and knows he has a point to prove, in fact, one that could extend his career if it goes well.</p>
<p>Warner drove well on a ground where he averages over fifty but the fact he was playing off the front foot showed England had pushed their lengths up a bit and were willing to take the risk of runs in the hunt for a wicket on a good batting pitch.</p>
<p>He and Marcus Harris had put on 51 when Warner drove at a ball angling towards the slips, Zak Crawley grabbing the edge just after lunch and a curtailed first session.</p>
<p>Now England were in the game. The final 40 minutes could crack open the innings and set up the Test for them. </p>
<p>At least they were playing cricket. They needed it after ten days of angst following the Melbourne drubbing. It was a tight, closely fought first day but at least they stayed in the game. It is a start.</p>
<h2>Fourth Test, day one as it happened</h2>
<h3>Thanks for joining us today</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>We will be back later this evening for the start of day two of the fourth Ashes Test. England in a half-decent position after bowling reasonably well. The bowling hasn't been the main problem, though. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>STUMPS, DAY ONE: AUS 126/3</h3>
<p>England will be moderately happy with that, I think. </p>
<h3>OVER 46.5: AUS 126/3 (Smith 6 Khawaja 4) </h3>
<p>Aaaand they go off for rain.</p>
<p>Might that be it? It is heavy but might not last. It is now a lot greyer than it was two minutes ago. </p>
<h3>OVER 46: AUS 125/3 (Smith 6 Khawaja 4) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Smith chases a bouncer by Stokes... he's not fully in control but he gets four four it. How far away was it from the man out there? It wasn't close but was in the air a long time. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>OVER 45: AUS 121/3 (Smith 2 Khawaja 4) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Khawaja finally gets off the mark with a sweet swivel pull off Wood through deep backward square leg. Four runs. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a><time>7:10AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 44: AUS 117/3 (Smith 2 Khawaja 0) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Ben Stokes returns for his ninth over. 0-26 off his eight so far. It's another maiden. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 43: AUS 117/3 (Smith 2 Khawaja 0) </h3>
<h3>OVER 42: AUS 117/3 (Smith 2 Khawaja 0) </h3>
<div> <div> <p>Anderson squares up Smith, beating the outside edge with a lovely ball. The type we have seen so many times before. Got caught on the crease, too. Anderson's 13th over is a very good one. 1-24 he has now. </p> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 41: AUS 117/3 (Smith 2 Khawaja 0) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>England right in this now. One wicket brings two. Add two wickets to the score. All the old cliches are the best, aren't they? Two new batsmen at the crease. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>WICKET! Labuschagne b Wood c Buttler 28</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Yes they can! Mark Wood back into the attack. His first ball is punched down the ground for four but his next one is fuller and quicker. Labuschagne outside edges behind to Buttler!</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>FOW 117/3</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 40: AUS 113/2 (Labuschagne 24 Smith 2) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Steve Smith the next man in, gets off the mark first ball with a decent drive down the ground for two runs. Can England manage another wicket before close? Big players these two. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>WICKET! Harris b Anderson c Root 38</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>FOW 111/2</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>6:44AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 39: AUS 111/1 (Harris 38 Labuschagne 24) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Leach races through his second over with just a run coming from it. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 38: AUS 108/1 (Harris 37 Labuschagne 24) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>We resume after a drinks break. The sun has come out. Fully. Shadows on the ground and everything. Five dots before a check pull by Labuschagne gets him two. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 37: AUS 108/1 (Harris 37 Labuschagne 22) </h3>
<p>Indeed it is Jack Leach that comes on. He comes round the wicket to left-hander Harris first up. Leach gets one to skid on outside off to Labuschagne, who gets a single from it. A single to each batsman from the Somerset man's first over. </p>
<h3>OVER 36: AUS 106/1 (Harris 36 Labuschagne 21) </h3>
<div> <p>Anderson gets a bit of bounce off a length which surprises Labuschagne. Has ramped it up to around 86mph by the end of the over, which ends as a maiden. Jack Leach getting warmed up on the boundary and looks likely to come on. </p> </div>
<h3>OVER 35: AUS 106/1 (Harris 36 Labuschagne 21) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Stokes bowls four dots but then goes short and wide and Harris gives it what it deserves, standing up and forward cutting of the back foot for four. Next ball beats the bat on the outside edge!</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 34: AUS 102/1 (Harris 32 Labuschagne 21) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Labuschagne drives for two through the covers to bring up the 50 partnership for these two. Those the only runs from Anderson's latest. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Travis Head to rejoin squad... if he tests negative</h3>
<h3>OVER 33: AUS 100/1 (Harris 32 Labuschagne 19) </h3>
<h3>OVER 32: AUS 96/1 (Harris 32 Labuschagne 16) </h3>
<p>Ping! Harris picks up for with an extra cover drove off Anderson. Just a shuffle and then into place and a controlled drive through the covers. </p>
<div> <h3>OVER 31: AUS 92/1 (Harris 28 Labuschagne 16) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Labuschagne attempts a booming off-drive but misses. Broad looks bemused. It ends with a maiden. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 30: AUS 92/1 (Harris 28 Labuschagne 16) </h3>
<p>Just two off the over, to Harris. </p>
<h3>OVER 29: AUS 90/1 (Harris 26 Labuschagne 16) </h3>
<div> <p>Australia have worked the gaps quite well so far and do so again here with another quick single. Was close for Labuschagne at the striker's end but think he would have been safe. By six inches or so. Three off the over. </p> </div>
<h3>OVER 28: AUS 87/1 (Harris 25 Labuschagne 14) </h3>
<p>Harris pushes a quick single on the off side, fielded by Stokes close in but he seems to have jarred his left knee in doing so. A wet outfield and his foot just slid, locking his knee. Nothing too serious. </p>
<h3>OVER 27: AUS 80/1 (Harris 24 Labuschagne 13) </h3>
<h3>OVER 26: AUS 76/1 (Harris 21 Labuschagne 12) </h3>
<h3>OVER 25: AUS 75/1 (Harris 20 Labuschagne 12) </h3>
<p>Decent ball by Broad gets Labuschagne's outside edge, but it evades any man in the slips. Four. Broad then strays onto the pads and is clipped for four, a yard or so wide of Buttler. </p>
<p>Next ball then raps Labuschagne right in front. Not an enormous appeal but England consider reviewing but says no. Think he hit it. Indeed he did. Inside edge onto the front pad. Eight runs from the over but it's a good one from Broad. </p>
<h3>OVER 24: AUS 67/1 (Harris 20 Labuschagne 4) </h3>
<h3>OVER 23: AUS 56/1 (Harris 14 Labuschagne 4) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Labuschagne off the mark with a firm, solid and controlled drive down the ground on the off side through Broad. Those the only runs from the over. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>5:22AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 22: AUS 56/1 (Harris 14 Labuschagne 0) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Just the two balls from Ben Stokes and no runs scored from them. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>5:20AM</time></a> <div> <h3>It will be Ben Stokes to resume the bowling</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Labuschagne the new man in but he's bowling to Harris. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>PLAY TO RESUME AT 5.20AM GMT</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Nice. </p> <p>Play can continue until 8am GMT and we have about 35 overs remaining in the day (which has been reduced, sensibly). </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <a><time>5:09AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Good news!</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>The covers are off and there is the slightest peep of blue sky between the white clouds above the Don Bradman stand. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>The only wicket to fall so far today</h3>
