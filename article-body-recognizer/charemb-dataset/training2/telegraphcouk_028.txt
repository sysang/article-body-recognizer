<div> <div> <div> <p> 24.1 overs bowled so far today. Should have been around 60 by now. </p> <p>The rain appears to have stopped and the covers are coming off, however. For how long?</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a><time>5:05AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Play was due to resume about now if there was no further rain</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>But there was further rain. One of those days, I'm afraid. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>4:54AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Tea has been taken, by the way</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Sensible. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <a><time>4:32AM</time></a> <div> <h3>The covers are still on, by the way</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Hopefully we will be able to get some more play before close. Can't guarantee it though. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Good morning</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Luke Slater taking over the reins now until close. Whenever that is. And whenever/if we get any play. The rain has intensified at the SCG now...</p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>While the rain continues to fall at the SCG</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Here's a great pic of said, fabled cricket ground from the infamous Bodyline series to look and marvel at. If you're like me, you'll love ye olde photos such as this. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>If you're an England fan </h3>
<div> <p>And have forgotten what the sight of a victorious dressing room looks like, then here's a glorious reminder...</p> <p>Bangladesh celebrate after their remarkable, shock win over Test world champions, New Zealand, earlier today. </p> </div>
<h3>I really shouldn't have given you hope - apols...</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>3:45AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Apparently it's stopped raining at the SCG</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>If that remains the case then play will resume in five minutes. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>It's still raining in Sydney</h3>
<p>Anyone want to guess how many overs will be bowled today with this stop-start rain set to continue? </p>
<p>Good job Broad got that wicket just before the latest interruption, at least England can get back out there with a slight spring in their step (not been able to write that much this series) once the deluge allows them. </p>
<h3>Here's how Broad did it</h3>
<h3>Did someone say bunny? </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Here's the 13th time Broad has taken Warner's wicket in Tests. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 21.4: AUS 56/1 (Harris 14 Labuschagne 0) </h3>
<p>Stokes bowls a bouncer that is so wide and high that it gives Buttler no chance behind the stumps.</p>
<p>Then, quite possibly in disgust, the heavens open once again and the players rush off into the pavilion. </p>
<p>It will be the third rain delay of the first day. </p>
<h3>OVER 21: AUS 51/1 (Harris 14 Labuschagne 0) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>That’s the over and the breakthrough the tourists so needed. </p> <p>That was the 13th time Broad has taken the wicket of Warner. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Wicket! Warner c Crawley b Broad 30 </h3>
<p>Then Broad pushes one up there outside off stumop, Warner cannot help himself, has a dart at it and it’s caught by Crawley at second slip. Just what England needed. </p>
<h3>OVER 20: AUS 50/0 (Warner 30 Harris 13) </h3>
<p>Stokes continues to Warner - first over the wicket, then after three balls around. Bar that edge past second slip two overs ago Warner has looked solid and since lunch has looked to up the run rate. </p>
<p>It’s a maiden. Time for Leach? </p>
<h3>OVER 19: AUS 50/0 (Warner 30 Harris 13) </h3>
<h3>OVER 18: AUS 48/0 (Warner 29 Harris 12) </h3>
<p>Stokes finds the outside of Warner’s bat, as the opener pushes at a wide one, it flies past a diving Zac Crawley at second slip - the beanpole batsman just unable to get his mitts on it as it goes to the boundary. </p>
<p>Two balls later Warner drives for four to take the pressure off after three testing deliveries. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>2:51AM</time></a> <div> <h3>OVER 17: AUS 40/0 (Warner 21 Harris 12) </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>It’s Wood to Harris and it’s a Wood maiden. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 16: AUS 40/0 (Warner 21 Harris 12) </h3>
<p>Harris is yet to get going, he’s looked solid enough, however, as he clips Stokes of his pads for a very elegant single to deep square leg. </p>
<p>Then there’s another no-ball, the second of the over - aggghhhh…</p>
<h3>OVER 15: AUS 36/0 (Warner 21 Harris 11) </h3>
<p>Wood bowls a beauty to Warner that beats him all ends up, the Australia opener did well not to nick that. </p>
<h3>OVER 14: AUS 36/0 (Warner 21 Harris 11) </h3>
<h3>OVER 13: AUS 36/0 (Warner 21 Harris 11) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>2:27AM</time></a> <div> <h3>It's stopped raining in Sydney</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>AND play will resume in five minutes - HURRAH! </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>1:57AM</time></a> <div> <h3>Lunch has been taken</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>So hopefully play can resume in 40 minutes...</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>That's one way to get through a rain delay...</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>(BTW - the Maltesers Teaser easily wins hands down...) </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div><div> <div> <blockquote><p>Well, this is all a bit frustrating. I might have to work my way through a box of Celebrations and rank them individually.</p>— daniel norcross (@norcrosscricket) January 5, 2022</blockquote> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <a><time>1:37AM</time></a> <div> <h3>So it's the second rain delay of the session</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>And the forecast suggests this on-off, truncated play will continue for most off the day. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 12.3: AUS 30/0 (Warner 15 Harris 11) </h3>
<p>Wood now comes into the attack - can his increased pace get the first wicket of the day? </p>
<h3>OVER 12: AUS 30/0 (Warner 15 Harris 11) </h3>
<h3>OVER 11: AUS 29/0 (Warner 14 Harris 11) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>It’s still Anderson and he’s bowling to Harris. He’s beating the bat but I suspect it’s still a tad too short to take the edge. Two from the over. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 10: AUS 27/0 (Warner 14 Harris 9) </h3>
<h3>OVER 9: AUS 22/0 (Warner 14 Harris 4) </h3>
<p>Anderson decides to go around the wicket, he has three slips in place - can he work his magic and at least make Warner at least play and miss (something he's failed to do so far...)? </p>
<p>Time for Mark Wood soon? </p>
<h3>OVER 8: AUS 18/0 (Warner 10 Harris 4) </h3>
<h3>OVER 7: AUS 16/0 (Warner 10 Harris 2) </h3>
<p>The bowling has been too short and wide so far. Neither Anderson and Broad have made the openers play at the ball enough, tut tut...</p>
<h3>OVER 6: AUS 8/0 (Warner 6 Harris 2) </h3>
<h3>OVER 5: AUS 8/0 (Warner 6 Harris 2) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>12:57AM</time></a> <div> <h3>The players are back out in the middle</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Can England catch the Australian batters out cold? </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>If England need inspiration...</h3>
<p>Then they need look no further than Bangladesh and Ebadot Hossain,</p>
<p>A brilliant performance and result. </p>
<div> <div> <a><time>12:50AM</time></a> <div> <h3>And now the covers are</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Back off - hurrah..! </p> <p>Play to resume in about 10 minutes - an even bigger hurrah! </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>12:47AM</time></a> <div> <h3>The covers are now</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Back on...</p> <p>Sorry, once again, to be the bearer of bad news...</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>A bit more on that Bangladesh win</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Hard to disagree with this view. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>12:40AM</time></a> <div> <h3>The covers are coming off</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>So hopefully play can recommence soon. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Are, that bar that first ball, there isn't much movement off the pitch and it looks a decent track to bat on. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Apparently it's just a shower</h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Fingers crossed it passes over the ground quickly and we can get on with play soon. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>12:23AM</time></a> <div> <h3>While the rain comes down</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>Here's a pic of that Warner drive.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <h3>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news...</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>But it's raining in Sydney and the players are off...</p> <p>It was forecast so it's no shock, but still slightly annoying. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 4: AUS 8/0 (Warner 6 Harris 2) </h3>
<p>England have to offer the drive in this first session .. Bowl for protection later in the day .. they cant waste the movement on offer by bowling too safe .. #Ashes</p>— Michael Vaughan (@MichaelVaughan)
<h3>OVER 3: AUS 2/0 (Warner 1 Harris 1) </h3>
<div> <p>Warner leaves the first three balls well - the first he does on length. Anderson then gets one to swing in, the Australian opener meeting the ball with the full face of the bat. Two more leaves follow and it’s a maiden. </p> </div>
<h3>OVER 2: AUS 2/0 (Warner 1 Harris 1) </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>Broad starts, predictably, around the wicket. Less predictably he doesn’t really make Harris play at the ball. Six dots balls come in a fairly nondescript over. </p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>OVER 1: AUS 2/0 (Warner 1 Harris 1) </h3>
<p>That’s a disappointing single from Harris - we wanted to see Broad to Warner sooner rather than later. </p>
<div> <div> <div> <a><time>12:01AM</time></a> <div> <h3>James Anderson will take the first over </h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>And he's bowling to a David Warner...</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>The teams are out on the pitch </h3>
<div> <div> <div> <p>And the national anthems are being sung. </p> <p>While that's happening here's a picture (from yesterday) of the glorious pavilion at the fabled SCG...</p> </div> </div> </div>
<h3>Another thing to galvanise Broad </h3>
<h3>It's possibly (hopefully) not a bad toss to lose</h3>
<div> <p>It's a greener pitch than usual at Sydney, rain is expected throughout the day, AND Stuart Broad will be bowling with something to prove (something he relishes) and around the wicket to his favourite Aussie batsman, David Warner. </p> </div>
<h3>Here are the teams again, this time in black and white</h3>
<p>Australia: Pat Cummins (c), David Warner, Marcus Harris, Marnus Labuschagne, Steve Smith, Usman Khawaja, Cameron Green, Alex Carey, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Scott Boland</p>
<p>England: Joe Root (c), Haseeb Hameed, Zak Crawley, Dawid Malan, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler, Mark Wood, Jack Leach, Stuart Broad, James Anderson</p>
<h3>Australia win the toss</h3>
<p>Pat Cummins says he expects to pitch to be a good one to bat on...</p>
<blockquote> <p>"The SCG is always a bat first wicket and don't see a lot here to change that...there's a bit more grass than we'd normally expect but it still looks like a good pitch to bat on."</p> </blockquote>
<p>Joe Root confirms he too would have batted had he won the toss...</p>
<h3>So to bat or bowl? </h3>
<div> <div> <p>There's is rain around Sydney and there will be the temptation to put the opposition into bat. The last captain to win the toss and bowl first at the SCG? Alastair Cook in 2014, England went on to lose by 281 runs...</p> </div> </div>
<h3>In good news for England </h3>
<p>An understrength Bangladesh beating New Zealand - world Test champions, unbeaten in 17 Tests at home, winning 8 of those by an innings - in New Zealand will be one of the great Test match upsets</p>— Tim Wigmore (@timwig) January 4, 2022
<h3>So while we wait for the toss</h3>
<p>Let's take a look into the current state and possible future of English cricket. In the aftermath of the Melbourne massacre there was, understandably a lot of soul searching and many questions directed at those in charge. </p>
<p>Here are two things he said that stood out...</p>
<blockquote> <p>"You can change me, we can change the head coach and change the captain, but we're only setting up future leaders for failure. That's all we do. It's only pushing it down the road."</p> </blockquote>
<p>So going on the past 12 months we can expect things to get worse before they get better...</p>

<div> <h3>It may have stopped raining but...</h3> <div> <div> <div> <p>The coin toss has been delayed.</p> <p>It will now be held at 23.30 (UK time) with the match commencing at midnight. </p> </div> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p>It was raining at the SCG...</p> </div> </div> </div>
<div> <div> <div> <p> But the good news is that...</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Covid continues to play havoc with the series. We've been lucky that no Test has been cancelled due to the virus but the uncertainty must be hard for the players on both sides.</p>
<h3>You know England are doing badly when</h3>
<div> <div> <p>Mr 5-0 himself, Glenn McGrath, feels some pity for the tourists. </p> <blockquote> <p>“It’s a good batting track - I’m hoping England can fight back and make a contest of it.”</p> </blockquote> </div> </div>
<h3>Here are the teams in Twitter form</h3>
<p>To Telegraph Sport's live blog for the fourth Ashes Test in Sydney. </p>
<p>“I need to make sure my full focus is on these two games,” he said. “First and foremost, I need to try to get the best out of the group, make sure we put in those performances we keep on banging on about out there on the field.</p>
<p>“We’ll worry about the captaincy at the end of the series.” </p>
<p>England named their side last night with the batters from the MCG all given another chance to prove they know what end of a bat to hold. In the attack Stuart Broad comes in for Ollie Robinson. </p>
<p>For Australia Usman Khawaja is in for Travis Head, who is in isolation with Covid, and Scott Boland, the home hero of the last Test, keeps his place in the attack that has done so much damage this series. </p>

<h1> How a fibre-rich diet improves gut health and can add years to your life </h1>
<p> Far from being a boring, ‘brown’ nutrient used to bulk out our meals, fibre is essential for gut health and has other surprising benefits </p>
<div> <div> By Xanthe Clay <time> 14 October 2021 • 6:09pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Fibre is the Ugly Duckling of our diet. Unlike protein (muscle!), carbs (delicious!), vitamins (glowing skin!), fibre is associated with brown-coloured breakfast cereals and regular bowels. It’s just not sexy.</p>
<p>But, he stresses, keep in mind that “you and I will have different bacteria. So we might react slightly differently to the same thing. My sister, for example, can’t eat chickpeas. She will just bloat.”</p>
<p>Insoluble fibre (for example wheat bran) is made mostly of cellulose, and is not broken down in the body at all, passing straight through the gut. It speeds up the gut processing time, which is protective against bowel cancer and diverticulitis.</p>
<h2>The best sources of fibre, according to Dr Nikpay</h2>
<li>Berries: Strawberries may have just 1.8g fibre in a 100g serving, but raspberries have 6.5g and blackberries have 5.3g. Wild blackberries may be even higher, so head for the hedgerows</li>
<li>Cooked lentils: Fibre content varies from brand to brand, but a teacupful of home-cooked green lentils (ie 200g, or about 100g uncooked weight) may provide you with half your daily fibre needs or even more. Tinned lentils tend to have less fibre</li>
<li>Herbs: Many contain around 10g fibre per 100g, so add them to everything</li>
<li>Nuts: Walnuts have 6.7g fibre per 100g; almonds and hazelnuts 9.7g per 100g. Roasted peanuts – technically a legume – pack 10g fibre per 100g</li>
<li>Legumes: Half a tin (120g) of haricot beans has 9g fibre, while half a tin of chickpeas has 5g. A generous serving of peas delivers 6g per 100g</li>

<header> <h1> The Great British Diet: how to lose weight and eat local </h1> <p> In the first of a 4-part series nutritionist Amelia Freer joins us to champion the power of home-grown produce to help you get healthy </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Eleanor Steafel <time> 25 January 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<h3>The basics of eating well</h3>
<p>While few would advocate a return to the wartime larder, to know the best diet for a healthy mind and body we can look to the past.</p>
<p>“In our quest for the new, it seems we may have rather forgotten about the fundamentals,” says Freer. “We have forgotten the moderation and common sense that many of our grandparents lived by (often from necessity).”</p>
<p>“It’s about eating a wide variety of ingredients so that we can get the diversity we need for feeding our microbiome, improving our gut health and getting all the different nutrients that we need to prosper,” says Freer.</p>
<p>And today more than ever, it’s vital that we narrow the divide between farm and plate by enjoying food when it’s in season, and grown in this country. Do this, and you are ensuring freshness – and with freshness comes nutrition.</p>
<h3>Rise of the ‘climatarian’</h3>
<p>Diet fads, from keto to paleo to plant-based, continue to come and go. You might find the pounds drop off at first, but it’s unlikely to be sustainable, either for you or for the planet.</p>
<p>Freer advises eating less meat – she has red meat twice a month – and buying the best quality you can afford. Grass-fed meat contains significantly more nutrients and less saturated fats than grain-fed.</p>
<p>“Stretch meat out with additional vegetables and pulses,” she suggests. “Add lentils to mince mix, pack curries and stews with plenty of veg and stretch out a single chicken for at least three meals.</p>

<p>Over the next four weeks, we will be guiding you through the Great British Diet, with tips on how to make balanced, delicious meals that will support your health in a way that feels joyful and sustainable.</p>
<p>Swap olive oil with rapeseed oil</p>
<p>Almond milk with real British milk</p>
<p>If you need to avoid dairy, try buying oat milk made in the UK, like M*lkman.</p>
<p>Avocado on toast with mushrooms on toast</p>
<p>They provide B vitamins, vitamin D, and selenium, which helps to support the immune system and prevent damage to cells and tissues. To add some protein and a little healthy fat, top the mushrooms with a handful of toasted British nuts or seeds.</p>

<a>Liberal Democrats</a>, fresh from two

<a>a stream of surveys</a> that gave opposition to separatism the lead and the latest poll may well turn out to be an outlier.
<a>Boris Johnson’s</a> premiership, with Britain now outside both the single market and the customs union, why is independence stuck, more or less, at the same levels it enjoyed on the day of the 2014 vote?
<a>The biggest threat </a>to her comes from her own party members, who are not prepared to wait for a whole generation before achieving their dream of separation from the UK.

<p>The New Year media narrative is being hotly pursued, and it does not provide comfortable reading for the prime minister.</p>

<a>Keir Starmer</a>, who would become prime minister, though would fall short of an overall majority himself.
<p>Not the kind of report that Number 10 advisers would want to place in front of the PM while he’s having breakfast.</p>
<p>But before going on to examine the peculiar fetishisation of the Red Wall in the last two years, we need to take a closer look at this latest poll and others of a similar nature.</p>

<header> <h1> Germany pulls the plug on half its nuclear power plants </h1> <p> Three reactors will be turned off on Friday after more than three decades as Germany continues its renewable energy push </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Telegraph Reporters <time> 31 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Germany will turn off three of its remaining six nuclear power stations on Friday as part of its switch to renewable energy.</p>
<p>Berlin decided to speed up its phasing out of nuclear power following Japan's Fukushima reactor meltdown in 2011 when an earthquake and tsunami destroyed the coastal plant in the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl 25 years earlier.</p>
<p>The reactors of Brokdorf, Grohnde and Gundremmingen C, run by E.ON and RWE, will be shut down on Friday after three and half decades in operation.</p>
<p>The last three nuclear power plants, Isar 2, Emsland and Neckarwestheim II, will be turned off by the end of 2022.</p>
<p>The phase-out of an energy deemed clean and cheap by some is an irreversible step for Europe's biggest economy, facing ambitious climate targets and rising power prices.</p>
<p>"For the energy industry in Germany, the nuclear phase-out is final," said Kerstin Andreae, the head of energy industry association BDEW.</p>
<p>The six nuclear power plants contributed about 12pc of electricity production in Germany this year, the association said. The share of renewable energy was almost 41pc, with coal generating just under 28pc and gas about 15pc.</p>
<p>Germany aims to make renewables meet 80pc of power demand by 2030 through expanding wind and solar power infrastructure.</p>
<p>The new government, which plans to step up climate protection efforts, stood by the nuclear power phase-out in its coalition agreement.</p>
<p>The economy and climate protection minister, Robert Habeck, said this week he did not see the anti-nuclear consensus weakening in Germany.</p>
<p>Environmental groups welcomed the move but warned that 2022 was not the real end of the nuclear era in Germany.</p>
<p>Asked about possible job losses, Gundremmingen mayor Tobias Buehler said the plant's employees would be busy with dismantling the reactor after the shutdown.</p>
<p>"And this period of dismantling will certainly take another one or two decades," he added.</p>

<h1> Exclusive: Ukrainian president warns Russian build-up 'threatens entire democratic order' </h1>
<p> Volodymyr Zelenskiy backed Joe Biden's summit and reiterated the call for his country to join Nato in an interview with the Telegraph </p>
<div> <div> By Roland Oliphant eastern Ukraine ; Justin Huggler Berlin and Nataliya Vasilyeva, Russia Correspondent, Moscow <time> 16 April 2021 • 8:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Ukraine must be allowed to join Nato, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the Telegraph on Friday as he warned that Russia’s military build-up on his country’s borders “threatens the entire democratic order”.</p>
<p>Mr Zelenskiy reiterated his country's longstanding call for Nato membership in an exclusive interview with the Telegraph hours before travelling to Paris for talks with Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel.</p>
<p>He backed Joe Biden’s call for a bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin to defuse the crisis, warning that it was a test of “Europe and the West as a whole”.</p>
<a>growing international concern at Russian troop concentrations</a> near the Ukrainian border. According to Mr Zelenskiy, there are now at least 40,000 Russian troops deployed in Crimea and another 40,000 in regions of Russia bordering Ukraine.
<p>Together with around 30,000 Russian and separatist troops already stationed in the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, they amount to the largest Russian force in the region since the height of the war. </p>
<p>“There are more Russian troops concentrated on our border and in the occupied territory of Ukraine than in the period from 2014 to 2015, when the fiercest fighting in Donbas took place,” he said.</p>
<p>“This is pressure on Europe and the West as a whole. It is a test of the strength of our ties and the weight of the words and decisions of Western nations.”</p>
<p>He backed Mr Biden’s offer to meet Mr Putin face-to-face at a summit in a neutral European venue this summer. “President Biden has a good understanding of the situation in our part of Europe and of the Ukrainian context,” he said.</p>
<p>“So, I am sure he will formulate to the Russian leader our common position with the West: that there is no alternative to peace and we need to return to meaningful negotiations to end the war in Donbas.”</p>
<p>But he warned: “We already have a crisis situation. That is why it is important that our joint efforts bear fruit and that it is clear to everyone that aggressive actions or threats will never benefit anyone.</p>
<p>“This position is already very strongly expressed by Britain. In a conversation with me, Boris Johnson expressed solidarity with Ukraine and full support.”</p>
<p>The threat to Ukraine is not limited to the Russian troops massing on its borders, Mr Zelensky said.</p>
<p>“That is why we must jointly fight disinformation, protect our political institutions and ensure the transparency of economic processes.”</p>
<p>Mr Zelenksiy met with Mr Macron in Paris and they were joined by Mrs Merkel in a video conference.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia welcomed the talks and hoped they could “help to normalise the situation”.</p>
<p>The Kremlin responded cautiously to Mr Biden’s offer of a summit, condemning US sanctions but praising his call for de-escalation.</p>

<header> <h1> Clément Beaune: France's Europe minister is Macron's attack dog for all things Brexit </h1> <p> Minister at heart of French fishing row has said the UK made a 'mess of Brexit' and is 'obsessed with Europe' </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Crisp, Europe Editor <time> 28 October 2021 • 8:17pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Clément Beaune has never been afraid to mock Brexit, once describing the UK's choice to leave the EU as "intellectual fraud".</p>
<p>It is one of the many barbs aimed at Downing Street from a man who has become Emmanuel Macron's attack dog on all matters Brexit.</p>
<p>Mr Beaune, who comes from a middle class Parisian background, speaks fluent English and is a product of France’s elite training programme for high-flying civil servants.</p>
<p>He is also a graduate of the College of Europe in Bruges, which is widely regarded as a finishing school for future eurocrats and was attended by Nick Clegg.</p>
<p>Mr Beaune, 40, was Mr Macron’s advisor on Europe for two years when he was a minister for the economy in Francois Hollande’s administration.</p>
<p>When Mr Macron jumped ship to form his own party and win a shock victory in the French presidential election, he brought Mr Beaune back to his side.</p>
<p>The two men worked together on Mr Macron’s Sorbonne speech that set out his vision for the future of the EU in the early days of his presidency.</p>
<p>Later they strategised how to build French influence in Brussels and wargamed the French position on the Brexit negotiations.</p>
<p>During those years of tough talks, Paris was often the “bad cop” among the EU member states; urging the hardest line possible.</p>
<p>Mr Beaune has kept the pressure up on Britain since he was given the post of Europe minister in July 2020.</p>
<p>He was soon getting stuck into his new role and getting stuck into Britain. He has been unrelenting in his criticism of the UK’s decision to leave the EU.</p>
<p>And on Thursday morning he warned that French retaliation over a shortage of Brexit fishing licences was necessary because the only language Boris Johnson understood was “the language of force”.</p>
<p>Many of his lacerating social media barbs, which regularly spark headlines and frequently annoy Brexiteers, have found their mark.</p>
<p>According to reports in France, Boris Johnson personally asked Emmanuel Macron to rein in Mr Beaune’s Twitter game.</p>
<p>Mr Macron refused, despite reports that some more senior ministers were getting jealous of Mr Beaune’s burgeoning profile.</p>
<p>Despite his aggressive style in public, Mr Beaune is polite, cautious and softly spoken in person.</p>
<p>But he is clearly not scared of a fight; even if it is with his own EU allies. </p>
<p>After coming out as gay in a French magazine, he attacked the Poland for the LGBT free zones springing up in the country.</p>
<p>As the UK can attest, he will prove a formidable and unsparing opponent to the government in Warsaw.</p>
<header> <h1> Valerie Pecresse: France's 'Iron Lady' chosen to take on Macron </h1> <p> Fifty-four year-old will lead the Republicains into the French presidential election as the party's first female candidate </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Julia Webster Ayuso Paris <time> 4 December 2021 • 3:47pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Valérie Pécresse, who has likened herself to Margaret Thatcher and Angela Merkel, won the primary race to become the French Republicain party’s candidate, making her the first woman to represent the party at a presidential election.</p>
<p>Ms Pécresse, 54, won 61 per cent of the vote in the second round of the primary race on Saturday, beating the hard-right candidate Éric Ciotti, who said he “shares” most of the polemicist Eric Zemmour’s views.</p>
<p>Mr Ciotti accepted defeat and immediately pledged to support Ms Pécresse.</p>
<p>“The party of General de Gaulle... our political family, will have a female candidate in the presidential election,” Ms Pécresse said in her victory speech.</p>
<p>“I am thinking of all the women in France today. I will give everything to triumph,” she said.</p>
<p>She has also insisted on bureaucratic reforms: one of her priorities is to cut 200,000 state sector jobs while raising the wage of the remainder.</p>
<p>Ms Pécresse will compete in the field of candidates looking to take on the incumbent centrist Mr Macron, who is still to announce his re-election bid but is expected to do so soon.</p>
<p>Polls show Mr Macron is currently the favourite to win, but analysts said this could change now that the Républicains have chosen their candidate, a crucial moment in the campaign.</p>
<p>The stakes are high for France’s traditional right-wing party, which failed to make the run-off in 2017 after its candidate François Fillon was felled by a graft scandal for which he was later convicted.</p>
<p>“The Republican right-wing is back. It will fight with implacable will. France cannot wait any longer,” said Ms Pécresse, promising to make France “respected around the world.”</p>
<p>The Republican primary race was marked by all candidates, including Pécresse, hardening their stance to the right, with the debate centering on issues of immigration and identity.</p>
<p>“In understand the anger of a people who feel powerless against violence, Islamist separatism and uncontrolled immigration,” she said.</p>
<p>“I will not have a wavering hand against the enemies of the Republic,” she added.</p>
<p>Mr Ciotti, who came out with the most votes in the first round of the primary vote on Wednesday, reflected a section of the party that has shifted toward the Right.</p>
<p>Ms Pécresse therefore faces an uphill struggle beating the Right-wing rivals Mr Zemmour and Marine Le Pen. Polls currently predict a repeat of the 2017 election with Marine Le Pen in the second round against Macron.</p>
