<div> <div> <div> <h3>Day One</h3> <p><b>MORNING</b></p> </div> </div> </div>
<b>Jewish Quarter</b>, aka Josefov. To see the main sights here, grab a combined entry ticket from the Jewish Museum, then saunter between the 16th-century neo-Gothic
<b><a>Maisel Synagogue</a></b> (Maiselova 10, 110 00 Praha 1; 00 420 222 749 464), whose fixed exhibition focuses on Jewish history in Bohemia and Moravia between the 10th-12th centuries; the atmospheric
<b> <a>Old Jewish Cemetery</a></b> (Široká, 110 00; 00 420 222 749 211), whose oldest grave dates from 1439 and is the resting place of Golem creator rabbi Loew; get a seperate ticket to visit the
<b> <a>Old-New Synagogue</a></b> (Maiselova 18, 110 01; 00 420 224 800 812), one of the largest extant Gothic buildings in Prague. Despite floods, fires, and the Nazis, it’s still the main synagogue of the local Jewish community.
<b>Old Town Square</b>. As touristy as it is, its medley of eye-catching architecture always manages to impress. The landmark here, of course, is the
<b><a>Astronomical Clock</a></b>. Rather than joining the throng for the hourly procession of the 12 Apostles, climb to the top of the adjacent
<b>Old Town Hall Tower</b> (Staroměstské náměstí 1/3; 00 420 775 400 052) for fabulous views of the square and beyond.
<b> House of the Black Madonna</b> (Ovocný trh 19; 00 420 778 543 902) and to the 11th-century
<b><a>Powder Tower</a></b> (Na Příkopě / náměstí Republiky 5; 00 420 725 847 875). Next door is the flamboyantly Art Nouveau
<b>Francouzska</b>, for a convenient lunch-time stop; choose from hearty soups, traditional Czech meat dishes, or vegetarian and seafood options.
<b><a>Communism Museum</a></b> (V Celnici 1031/4; 00 420 224 212 966) en route to the

<div> <div> <div> <p>• <a>The best restaurants in Prague</a></p> </div> </div> </div>
<b>Malá Strana</b>, aka 'Lesser Town'. Reach it from the Old Town by crossing over the historic, statue-lined Charles Bridge and enjoy a slow walk up to
<b><a>Prague Castle</a></b> (00 420 224 373 368). Its sprawling grounds will need at least a couple of hours to explore properly; don’t miss the Gothic
<b><a>St. Vitus Cathedral</a></b> (and its stained glass windows), the 16th-century
<b>Vladislav Hall</b> (which is occasionally used for jousting contests), and the impossibly cute
<b>Golden Lane</b>, where Kafka lived for a while.
<a><b>Kampa Park</b></a> (Na Kampě 8b; 420 296 826 112), whose collection of international contemporary art and sculpture are worth inspecting. Afterwards, bag a table on the river-facing terrace of
<b>Hergetova Cihelna</b> (420 296 826 103), the museum restaurant, which has a menu of Czech classics and lighter international fare - think roast duck to pizza.
<b><a>Cihelna Concept Store</a></b> (Cihelná 2b; 00 420 257 317 318) to find a fantastic range of Czech design goods — glass; porcelain; jewellery — that can also make wonderful, unique gifts. Then it’s time for
<b><a>Petřín Hill</a></b>, most famous for its
<b><a>Observation Tower</a></b> (Petřínské sady 633; 00 420 257 320 112), affectionately regarded as Prague’s own, albeit smaller, version of the Eiffel Tower. On the way are a slew of interesting stops, including the
<b>Petřín Rose Garden</b>, which has plenty of welcoming benches to rest on, and a mirror maze that dates from the Victorian era, plus a couple of attractive churches. At the top,
<b><a>Strahov Monastery</a></b> (Strahovské nádvoří 1/132) awaits, complete with its modern beer hall serving home-brewed IPAs and wheat beers, and a courtyard garden.
<b>St Nicholas Church</b> (Malostranské náměstí; 00 420 257 534 215), where you might be lucky enough to find a classical concert. Grab a drink at the cosy
<b>Blue Light</b> (Josefská 42/1; 00 420 257 533 126), whose walls are covered with tattered posters, graffiti from some of its more famous guests (such as Bruce Willis) and jazz album covers.
<p>Then head to riverside venue <b><a>Jazz Dock</a></b> (Janáčkovo nábř. 3249/2; 420 774 058 838), which has food (burgers; pasta; fish dishes), a great selection of drinks, and a solid programne of live jazz and soul music.</p>

<p>Explore our interactive map below for all the local highlights, and scroll down for our suggested day-by-day summary of the best things to see and do...</p>
<a>Dubrovnik Port Authority</a>, and then pick what looks like the quietest date.
<a>our separate guide</a>. 
<a>Proto</a>, to feast on lobster risotto and grilled sea bream – King Edward VIII and Wallace Simpson dined here in 1936. Round off the evening with a nightcap at the
<a>Bar by Azur</a> – order a mojito, deliciously refreshing on a hot summer night.
<a>Fort Lovrijenac</a>. Lying outside the Old Town, it affords superb views of the City Walls, making it a favourite photo spot. Climb up 175 steps, to reach the upper level, complete with canons and a small chapel.
<a>Dubrovačka Kuća</a> stocks paintings and ceramics by recognised Croatian artists, including raku-glazed ceramic fish by Ljiljana Barbarić, and ceramic candle-holders decorated with floral motifs by Andrea Bassi. Have lunch at 
<a>Barba</a>, serving street food based on fresh local seafood – try the octopus burger, in a bread bun with salad and mayonnaise.
<a>Gianni's</a>, then spend the afternoon sunbathing and swimming in the deep blue Adriatic.
<a>D'Vino</a> wine bar in the Old Town – it's mellow and cosy, with several outdoor tables in the narrow side street.
<p>The Dubrovnik Card affords free entry to major attractions, including the City Walls and Cultural Historical Museum, plus various restaurant discounts.</p>
<div> <div> <div> <h3>What to bring home</h3> <p>Natural Rose face cream (<i>krema od ruža</i>) is made to a secret medieval recipe at <a>Ljekarna Male Braće</a>, set inside the 14th-century Franciscan Monastery.</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p><a>Uje</a> specialises in Dalmatian olive oil. Their best-seller, Brachia virgin, comes in a stylish olive-shaped white ceramic flask.</p>
<i>bura </i>(northeast) wind can be bitterly cold, so wrap up well.
<a>Maritime Museum</a>, each within a two-minute walk of each other, in the Old Town. Note that most good hotels have umbrellas available for guests.
<h4>Where to eat and drink</h4>
<p>Taj Mahal is one of the very few eateries to stay open all year in the old town, and offers a break from ubiquitous Dalmatian seafood. The kitchen turns out Bosnian specialities, with an emphasis on meat.</p>
<p><a>Bar by Azur</a> or <a>D'Vino</a> are both good options for drinking - they stay open most of the year (but sometimes shut in January).</p>
<p>The <a>Hotel Excelsior</a> is a fine winter choice. The vast Wellness Spa includes a big freeform pool and whirlpools, Roman bath, Finnish sauna and theme showers. Doubles from €137 (£123). </p>
<a>British Airways</a>, which operate sporadic direct flights from London in winter, though this might involve a change in Zagreb.
<p><b>Croatian Emergency services:</b>Dial 112</p>
<p><b>Currency:</b> Kuna (Kn). Croatia joined the EU on July 1, 2013 but will not adopt the Euro in the foreseeable future.</p>

<p><b>Flight time: </b>London to Dubrovnik is around two hours and 40 minutes</p>

<b>Marcel </b>(15 Rue de Babylone, 75007; 00 33 1 42 22 62 62) and continue the gourmand theme across the road in
<b>Luxembourg Gardens </b>and take in the lines of plane trees and ornate parterres, with the top of the
<b>Eiffel Tower </b>visible in the distance. Come out the north side of the park being sure to clock the stunning
<b>Medici Fountain</b> on your right. 
<b>Rue de Seine</b>, via 
<b>Place de l'Odéon</b>, stopping to browse in the second-hand bookshops and independent galleries that punctuate this historically bohemian district. Make a literary pilgrimage to (and coffee stop at) the now-luxurious
<a><b>L'Hôtel</b></a> (13 Rue des Beaux Arts) formerly L'Hôtel d’Alsace, where a penniless Oscar Wilde was staying when he died.
<b>Breizh Café</b> (1 Rue de l'Odéon, 75006; 00 33 1 42 49 34 73; ) or
<b><a>Ippudo</a> </b>for some of the best ramen in Paris (14 rue Grégoire de Tours; 00 33 1 42 38 21 99).
<p>• <a>The best free things to do in Paris</a></p>
<p><span><b>AFTERNOON</b></span></p>
<b>Rue de Seine</b> down to the river, emerging in front of the 
<b>French Institute</b> building, taking in the view across
<b>Pont des Arts</b> to the Louvre across the river. Book ahead to visit
<b>Sainte Chapelle</b>, (8 Boulevard du Palais; 00 33 1 53 40 60 80) the resplendent 12th-century chapel built by Louis IX (you’ll feel like you’re inside a giant jewellery box).
<b>Les Deux Palais</b> (3 Boulevard du Palais; 00 33 1 43 54 20 86). Cross
<b>Île de la Cité</b> arriving in front of
<b>Notre-Dame</b>; steal a moment of calm in the gardens that run along the right of the church, before crossing on to the Left Bank to visit
<b>Shakespeare Company</b> (37 Rue de la Bûcherie), the notable English-language bookshop frequented by the Beat poets and still a hub for literary types.
<div> <div> <div> <p>Wander up Quai de Montebello, cross back onto the charming Ile Saint-Louis and stop for a proper hot chocolate at <b>Café Saint-Régis</b> (6 Rue Jean du Bellay; 00 33 1 43 54 59 41).</p> </div> </div> </div>
<p>Head back on to the Left Bank and wander the <b>Jardin des Plantes</b> botanical gardens; if you’re travelling <i>en famille</i>, consider a visit to the <b>zoo </b>(Ménagerie du Jardin des plantes, 57 Rue Cuvier). </p>
<a><b>Prescription Cocktail Club</b></a> (23 Rue Mazarine; 00 33 9 50 35 72 87) for an inventive tipple from the much-lauded Experimental Group.
<b>Filmothèque </b>(9 Rue Champollion; 00 33 1 43 26 70 38) in the Latin Quarter. If you still want to go on, end the night with live jazz in the atmospheric cellars at
<b>Caveau de la Huchette </b>(5 Rue de la Huchette; 00 33 1 43 26 65 05).

<div> <div> <div> <h3>Day Two</h3> <p><b>MORNING</b></p> </div> </div> </div>
<b>Marché des Enfants Rouges</b> in the hip Upper Marais and pick up a pastry or breakfast crêpe at legendary food vendor
<b>Chez Alain Miam Miam</b> (Rue des Oiseaux, 75003) – get there at opening (9am) to avoid queues.
<b>Boulevard Beaumarchais</b> (the 29 bus runs through the Marais, as an alternative to going by foot) stopping at chic concept store
<b>Merci </b>(111 Boulevard Beaumarchais; 00 33 1 42 77 00 33)
<b>Place des Vosges</b>. Warm up with a café crème at the elegant
<b>Café Hugo</b> (22 Place des Vosges; 00 33 1 42 72 64 04) on the north-east corner, or visit the
<b>house </b>of its novelist's namesake on the south-east corner (Maison de Victor Hugo; 6 Place des Vosges).
<p>Exit to <b>Rue Saint-Antoine</b> via the south-west edge of the square through the secluded courtyards of 17th-century mansion <b>Hôtel de Sully</b>. Head into the heart of the Marais along <b>Rue Vielle du Temple</b>.</p>
<b>Le Pick-Clops</b> (16 Rue Vieille du Temple; 00 33 1 40 29 02) or if you’re in a street-food mood, opt for falafel in the historical heart of Paris’s Ashkenazi Jewish community;
<b>L'As du Fallafel</b> (32-34 Rue des Rosiers; 00 33 1 48 87 63 60) is the most famous and undeniably delicious, but be prepared for long queues. Walk it off in the
<b>Jardin des Rosiers – Joseph-Migneret</b> (Rue des Rosiers), a quiet park hidden (like many good things in Paris) in plain sight.
<div> <div> <div> <p>• The best restaurants in Paris</p> </div> </div> </div>
<a><b>Centre Pompidou</b></a> (Place Georges-Pompidou; 00 33 1 44 78 12 33) from
<b>Rue Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie</b>, a hub for gay bars and businesses. Stop, on the way, for ice cream at award-winning
<b>Une Glace à Paris</b> (15 Rue Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie; 00 33 1 49 96 98 33), known for its inventive flavour combinations, such as blackberry and jasmine.
<b>Pompidou</b>. Make sure that you make a pitstop at the top of the remarkable post-modern building for an (admittedly, eye-wateringly expensive) drink at
<b>Le Georges</b> restaurant (00 33 1 44 78 47 99) and take in the wraparound views.
<b>Les Halles</b>. Turn right up
<b>Rue Montorgueil </b>and soak in the sights and smells of this traditional market street – be sure to stop by the picture-perfect
<b>Anaïs florist</b> (52 Rue Montorgueil) and drool over beautiful pastry at historical
<b>Patisserie Stohrer </b>(51 Rue Montorgueil).
<b>Rue Bachaumont</b> for vintage finds and local designers. Rest your weary feet with a drink in the Instagram-ready courtyard restaurant at
<b>Hoxton Paris</b> (30-32 Rue du Sentier; 00 33 1 85 65 75 00).
<b>Harry’s Bar</b> (5 Rue Daunou; 00 33 1 42 61 71 14), credited as being the birthplace of the Bloody Mary – served with aplomb by waiters in white coats. Next, head for dinner at
<b>La Régalade Conservatoire </b>which serves 'bistronomie' par excellence (9 Rue du Conservatoire, 00 33 1 44 83 83 60).

<h1> Andrew Cotter: 'I had this quasi-transcendental experience climbing Mt Fuji' </h1>
<p> The sports broadcaster and viral sensation on his love for the outdoors – and the days when you could still bring a golf club into the cabin </p>
<div> <div> <time> 12 December 2021 • 3:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<h2>I haven’t flown since January 2020</h2>
<h2>My dream holiday involves outdoor activities and escaping crowds</h2>
<h2>You can't beat a grand tour of European cities for the history and the architecture</h2>
<p>Prague has unfortunately lost some of its shine with the penchant for stag and hen dos there. More recently I have loved visiting Stockholm. It’s so much easier to slot a weekend break to Europe into an unpredictable work schedule.</p>
<h2>Childhood holidays involved taking the CalMac ferry over to Arran </h2>
<p>It's a magical rugged island off the west coast of Scotland. We’d stay in a wee holiday cottage in Lochranza on the north end and I’d be climbing Goat Fell pretty much every day.</p>
<h2>We'd also do a driving holiday to Europe every few years</h2>
<a>Germany</a>, so one of my earliest memories is of going to Bavaria aged four in 1977. We stopped off in France and Aosta in the Italian Alps. I slept a lot of the way, but awoke to these schlosses of mad King Ludwig.
<h2>I loved Japan when I was there for the Rugby World Cup in 2019</h2>
<h2>Much of my childhood was spent on a golf course in Troon</h2>
<h2>I first experienced the Med in 1980, in Italy</h2>
<h2>One of my favourite hotels is Andy Murray’s Cromlix Hotel in Perthshire</h2>
<p>I’ve paid the full whack every time I’ve been, so there’s no mate’s rates (yet!). They are very dog friendly and even though it had been renovated, it has an authentic history and charm to it.</p>
<h2>My two Labradors, Olive and Mabel, love coming hill-walking with me </h2>
<p>In April I made a video with them in the Cairngorms. That was over two days and 26 miles. We saw one person the whole time, which suited me just fine. The dogs are so adaptable; they just settle in wherever they are.</p>
<h2>I haven't been to Morocco but I'd love to go climbing in the Atlas Mountains</h2>
<p>Doing the Himalayas is another of my dreams, but you are never going to see it the way Mallory did – I’d want to see it in as quiet and untainted a way as possible.</p>

<header> <h1> The perfect holiday in the world's happiest country – our expert's ultimate itinerary </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Chris Moss, Destination expert <time> 5 November 2019 • 9:30am </time> </div> </div>
<a>has no standing army</a>. It routinely makes headlines for green power initiatives and recently announced plans to become the
<a>world’s first zero-carbon country by 2050</a>. Formerly a banana republic famous for fine coffee, it’s now a regional hub for technology and communications. 
<p>Fly non-stop to San José with British Airways. </p>
<p>Check in to <a>Grano de Oro</a>, a boutique hotel named after the “golden bean” – coffee.</p>
<p>San José is a small, leafy, low-slung capital, and is friendly to walkers and cyclists. You can go it alone or go with a guide; if you opt for the latter, book with Local company <a>ChepeCletas</a>.</p>
<a>Beer Factory</a>. Afterwards, have dinner at
<a>Alma de Amon</a>, which serves Latin Soul food. 
<p>Take the 30-minute <a>SANSA Airlines</a> flight to Tortuguero on the Caribbean coast. It’s a short boat ride to <a>Tortuga Lodge</a>, a 27-room jungle retreat. </p>
<p>After breakfast, take off on a guided river excursion, arranged by the hotel. Look out for monkeys and three-toed sloths; caiman, iguanas and turtles are routinely seen swimming from shore to shore.</p>
<p>For dinner, stay put at the lodge or take a boat to the local village where there are half a dozen options. </p>
<p>A further night excursion, available between July and September, is to see leatherback turtles nesting – <a>Tortuguero Tours</a> can arrange a trip.</p>
<p>Get up with the birds and head out for a dawn stroll around the gardens, spotting birds, including keel-billed toucans, ringed kingfishers and tiger herons. </p>
<p>Depart on an early flight to San José, hire a car, and then make a journey of about an hour and a quarter to the Poás Volcano National Park to see the impressive crater.</p>
<a>El Silencio</a>, a luxury lodge and spa in a remote, densely forested reserve. Dine at El Silencio’s Las Ventanas upscale modern Costa Rican cuisine restaurant. You can even request to dine on a table set up in the forest. 
<h3>Getting active under the volcano</h3>
<p>After breakfast, your drive north skirts the Juan Castro Blanco National Park, site of three more volcanoes, before heading west towards the Arenal volcano and the national park of the same name. The journey takes at most two hours. </p>
<p>For the next two nights I recommend a stay at the <a>Arenal Nayara Spa and Gardens</a>, a romantic hotel surrounded by lush rainforest. </p>
<p>The hotel has a tapas bar as well as four restaurants. </p>
<p>Steep mountains, narrow canyons and a tropical climate – most rain falls between May to October – means inland Costa Rica is ideal for white-water rafting. </p>
<div><div> <blockquote><div> <p>A photo posted by Visit Costa Rica (@visit_costarica) on <time>Sep 28, 2015 at 8:57am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> </div> </div>
<h3>Land of the Costa Rican cowboy</h3>
<p>It’s about three hours by road, using the Panamerican Highway for part of the journey, to the Rincón de la Vieja National Park and its namesake volcano. </p>
<p>After lunch at the lodge’s own “farm-to-table” restaurant, set off on one of the estate’s three mountain bike trails – the only such trails in Costa Rica to be found on an active volcano. </p>
<p>Return for lunch, with the afternoon free to explore. In the evening enjoy a barbecue at the lodge.</p>
<p>Drive south for three hours to the tiny corridor of civilisation that sits between the villages of Monteverde and Santa Elena.</p>
<p>Around dusk, set off on a wildlife walk, looking out for olingos, kinkajous, two-toed sloths and possums. </p>
<p>Fly from Tambor, the local airport, to San José and back to the UK. </p>
<p>The dry season (roughly mid-November to April) is the best time to visit. Choose November (just after the rains) and early December and April) to avoid the boom months when Americans arrive in large numbers.</p>
<p>It is possible to book this itinerary independently, but you may find it easier to employ the help of a specialist tour operator. Telegraph Travel recommends <a>Journey Latin America</a>, <a>Audley</a> and <a>Exodus</a>. </p>

<header> <h1> The perfect holiday in Mexico – our expert's ultimate itinerary </h1> </header>
<div> <div> <time> 3 December 2019 • 12:47pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>There are timeless places across the country, home to indigenous cultures and farming communities, where life appears unchanged for centuries, and certainly the ruins of ancient civilisations are a step back in time and a big reason to visit.</p>
<p>A vast country, around eight times larger than the UK, Mexico has big distances to cover. Some regions, like the Yucatán, are ripe for road trips, but exploring the country generally requires internal flights.</p>
<p>Trying to fit everything Mexico has to offer into two weeks isn’t possible. For now, Baja California’s whales, Chiapas’ jungles, and the tequila heartland of Jalisco will have to wait for second or third visits.</p>
<p>But for anyone wanting a real flavour of Mexico, this is my ultimate itinerary.</p>
<p>Fly out from London Heathrow on British Airways’ daily 12.50pm flight, arriving into Mexico City at 6.45pm. <a>Stay at smart boutique hotel Las Alcobas</a> in Mexico City’s cool, upmarket Polanco district.</p>
<h3>A sense of Frida in Mexico City</h3>
<a>Palacio Nacional</a>, especially for Diego Rivera’s massive mural Mexico a Través de los Sigloes. Stop by
<a>Templo Mayor</a>, an Aztec pyramid in the downtown area, then check out more big, bold murals from Rivera, Orozco and Siqueiros at
<a>Museo de Arte Modern</a>o, home toone of Frida Kahlo’s most famous paintings, Las Dos Fridas. Spend a few hours at nearby
<a>Museo Nacional de Antropología</a>, with fascinating objects from Mayan, Aztec and other pre-Hispanic cultures. In the evening, get a taste of Bajasea food at
<a>Campobaja</a> in Roma, then stroll down to cool
<p>Catch a flight from Mexico City to Los Mochis with low-cost airline Volaris, and transfer to El Fuerte in the northern state of Sinaloa. Enjoy an afternoon in the small Mexican town and kick back at <a>Hotel Hacienda Santa Cruz</a>.</p>
<h3>Riding high on El Chepe</h3>
<a>Copper Canyon Adventure Park</a>. Take the cable car out into the heart of the canyon to enjoy stillness and silence. At
<a>Hotel Divisadero Barrancas</a>, spend the evening drinking margaritas with a view over the canyon’s rugged glory.
<p>Whizz around the canyon from point to perilous point on Copper Canyon Adventure Park’s zip line tour, which includes seven lengthy ziplines and vertigo-inducing hanging bridges.</p>
<p>Test your mettle on the challenging Via Ferrata (rock face assault course), then catch the 1215pm train to the town of Creel and spend the night at Cusarare River Sierra Lodge (+52 614 334 8139), outside town.</p>
<p>Catch the 1.45pm train from Creel to complete the rail road journey, leaving behind the sunset glow of the Sierra Madre mountains to arrive into Chihuahua after dark. Stay at <a>Fiesta Inn Chihuahua</a>.</p>
<a>Hotel Quinta Real Puebla</a>, set in a former convent, and seek out Puebla’s famous Mole Poblano, a dish with a rich choc-chilli sauce.
<p>Arrive in Oaxaca City, a Unesco World Heritage Site, by the evening and settle in at central <a>Hotel Quinta Real Oaxaca</a>.</p>
<h3>Mezcal, Mole and Monte Alban in Oaxaca</h3>
<p>Catch an evening show on the main plaza, including demos of the ancient Maya’s ballgame. For a lively night, head to La Negrita cantina for mezcal, cocktails, bar food, live Cuban music and dancing.</p>
<h3>Mayan Magic in the Yutacan Peninsula</h3>
<a>Casa Malca, former home of Pablo Escobar, now an art-filled boutique hotel</a>. Ask for a beach front room.
<a>Hartwood</a> restaurant is the place to eat. 
<p>Make the most of your final day with a stroll and a swim, maybe a few tacos and cold beers at <a>Taqueria La Eufemia</a>, before transferring two hours to Cancun airport and catching BA’s 6.35pm flight to Gatwick.</p>
<p>Arrive back into London Gatwick (8.45am), your head undoubtedly still spinning with colour, mezcal and memories.</p>
<a>Abercrombie Kent</a> can all arrange tailor-made trips to Mexico.

<header> <h1> The perfect holiday in California – our expert's ultimate itinerary </h1> </header>
<div> <div> By Aaron Millar <time> 11 November 2019 • 12:21pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Northern California is a land of giants. Jagged peaks rise up from the Sierra Nevada Mountains like enormous stone totems. Waterfalls cascade for thousands of feet and cast rainbows in their mist. There are whales and dolphins.</p>
<h3>A taste of San Francisco </h3>
<a>Liholiho Yacht Club</a>, just a five-minute stroll from the door.
<a>Bistro Boudin</a> does one of the best.
<h3>Pacific Coast road trip</h3>
<a>Big Basin Redwoods State Park</a>, to gawp upwards at some of the oldest and largest trees on Earth. Then check in at the 
<a>Inn at Depot Hill,</a> right on the beach, and spend the afternoon 
<a>catching waves</a> and strolling the 100-year-old beach boardwalk with its old-school, free-admission amusement park, summer concerts and 
<a>Monterey Bay Whale Watch</a> are one of the few with resident Marine Biologists on board ($49 per adult) and keep your eyes peeled for humpbacks, orcas, grays, blues and more.
<a>Post Ranch Inn</a>. This contemporary design hotel, perched on the edge of a cliff, oozes style: floor-to-ceiling windows, salvaged redwood panels and an infinity pool dropping 1,200-feet to the sea below. Their award-winning 
<a>Sierra Mar restaurant</a> has some of the best views, and food, on the coast. 
<a>Julie Pfeiffer Burns State Park</a>, where the stunning McWay Waterfall drops 80 feet from the cliff top directly to the sandy cove below. Stop at the 
<a>Big Sur Deli</a> on the way back to grab a picnic and a bottle of wine, then head up to Pfeiffer Beach, a few miles north of the hotel. In a region where every sunset is spectacular, locals say this one’s the best.
<h3>The wonders of Yosemite</h3>
<h3>Relax at Lake Tahoe </h3>
<a>Basecamp Hotel</a> in Tahoe City, a rustic inn with trendy touches of contemporary colour and a good craft beer bar. Then spend the afternoon
<a>$95 per person</a>). Then make your way back to Tahoe City for a long, leisurely wine-filled lunch at the 
<a>Sunnyside Resort’s</a> huge open-air deck on the water. Keep the celebrations going with a happy-hour cruise on board the 
<a>Tahoe Gal</a> ($35 per person), an authentic-looking Mississippi River style paddle wheeler.
<h3>A tour of wine country</h3>
<a>Bardessono Hotel Spa</a>, a high end but eco-friendly wellbeing boutique, and then spend the afternoon exploring some of the region’s best wineries.
<a>Del Dotto Vineyards</a> is utterly opulent and has an excellent candlelit tour of their wine cave. Finish with dinner at

<p>My trip described here is just a starter – once you have experience, you can plan another visit to the farthest highland interior, the venerable north and east, or the rainbow-scored Westfjords.</p>
<h3>Bright lights in Reykjavik</h3>
<a>Ion Adventure hotel</a> or opt for Hotel Litli Geysir (
<h3>Geysers and the Golden Circle</h3>
<p>Drives in this area are breathtaking. In summer take a road trip up the coast to the adsurdly gorgeous Jokulsarlon glacier lagoon, the rewards are certainly worth the 5 hour round trip.</p>
<h3>Ice caps and hot springs</h3>
<a>Hotel Husafell</a> - an oasis in rough terrain. Their restaurant is spectacular, but there’s also a café on-site for simpler meals, geothermal pools and a small slide for children. Book ahead with Into the Glacier (

<h3>Ancient history and celebrity villages </h3>
<h3>Cezanne, Lorgues and the unspoilt coast</h3>
<a>Château de Berne</a>. It’s not so much a wine estate as a wine realm, with a five-star auberge, acclaimed eating and more than a thousand acres to roam.
<a>Château de Léoube</a>, which makes some of Provence’s finest wines. As does the
<a>St André-de-Figuière</a> domain at nearby La Londe-les-Maures. These are the ones to bring home.
<p>Beyond here, the Maures corniche road renders ridiculous claims that the French Mediterranean is all concrete. It’s a grand weave back to base via Cavalaire, Grimaud and La Garde-Freinet.</p>
<h3>Heights and highlights</h3>
<a>castellane-verdontourisme.com</a>). Or you may account a drive along the Corniche Sublime quite hair-raising enough.
<p>Drive on, via Riez, to the Valensole plateau where, in July, lavender and wheat in alternating waves of blue and gold create a spectacle of mesmerising purity.</p>
<a>Alexandra David Neel</a> retired, now a museum of Himalayan matters. Or the
<a>Musée-Promenade</a>, a geology-meets-art introduction to the grandeur of the southern Alps. Its garden has 139 varieties of butterfly.
<h3>Vineyards and sunny uplands</h3>
<a>Henri Bardouin</a>) and Limans (best cheese at La Pourcine farm). You’re edging the great Lure mountain as you make for Banon. On to Sault, where July lavender makes the valley sing.
<p>South to Mazan, a village the colour of old piano keys. Rising above it, the <a>Château-de-Mazan</a> offers a terrific welcome, idiosyncratic décor (African through London clubland), gardens, a pool, good food and a sense of privilege.</p>
<p>It’s an hour’s drive back to Avignon for the Eurostar to London.</p>

<h3>Views and volcanoes: Etna Taormina </h3>
<a>three-hour Etna Masterclass, which wraps with a five-wine tasting session</a>.
<a>Belmond Grand Hotel Timeo</a> (gents, wear that linen suit for the full effect).
<h3>Amazing mosaics: Cefalu </h3>
<a>Kalura</a> for the next two nights, a classic Italian seaside hotel that punches above its three-star rating, perched on a low cliff above a private beach.
<a>Museo Mandralisca</a> with Antonello da Messina’s deliciously enigmatic Portrait of an Unknown Man.
<h3>Splendid isolation: Monreale Segesta </h3>
<h3>Spectacular ruins: Selinunte, Agrigento Piazza Armerina </h3>
<a>Da Vittorio</a> is one of Giorgio Locatelli’s favourite places to eat in Sicily.
<h3>Baroque brilliance: Modica Ragusa </h3>
<h3>Sicilian charm: Noto Siracusa </h3>
<a>Caffè Sicilia</a> in Corso Vittorio Emanuele.
<a>Caseificio Borderi</a> in Via Emmanuele de Benedictis.
<p>Depart from Catania. </p>
<p>Sicily has a long, warm spring and autumn, but summer is roasting hot. March-June and September-November are the best times to travel.</p>

<p>Most tourists visit Franschhoek as a day trip from Cape Town but it’s well worth spending the night there to enjoy the wraparound mountain views, quaint streetscapes and polyglot sophistication of the prettiest valley in the Winelands.</p>
<p>Start your road trip here, heading east to the semi-arid plains of Klein Karoo: this is big-sky country, largely uninhabited and a stark contrast to the more developed and fertile landscape of the Garden Route.</p>
<p>Depart from the UK on an overnight direct flight from Heathrow to Cape Town with British Airways.</p>
<a><b>Robben Island</b></a> (3pm in summer) to see the cell where Nelson Mandela was imprisoned for 18 years. Online pre-booking is essential.
<p>Afterwards, stroll the bustling Waterfront area; Willoughby’s (0027 21 418 6115) serves the best sushi in the city. </p>
<a><b>wine tour</b></a> of Stellenbosch and Franschhoek. Itineraries are personalised but all strike a great balance between iconic and off-the-beaten-track vineyards, and the lunch venue is always spot on.
<p>At the end of the day Stephen will drop you off at Leeu House in Franschhoek, a relatively new boutique property located right in the heart of the village.</p>
<a><b>pre-booking</b></a> is advised. There’s no need to taste at every stop, but you’ll get a real sense of the 18th-century farmhouse architecture and see some gorgeous landscapes. 
<p>If you’re interested in vintage cars, set aside time to visit the Franschhoek Motor Museum. Have your hire car delivered to you in the afternoon.</p>
