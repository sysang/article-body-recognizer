<p>On 14 October 1066, he was killed at the Battle of Hastings by William the Conqueror’s army with, legend has it, an arrow to the eye. </p>
<p>Either way, William the Conqueror became King of England. Harold’s predecessor, childless Edward the Confessor, was William’s first cousin once removed, and William understood himself to be the country’s natural heir.</p>
<p>He was a man who spent a lot of time fighting the cause for his legitimacy. Invading England must have been a relief for the monarch as it gave him a new moniker to replace his former sobriquet: William the Bastard. </p>
<p>In addition to being born out of wedlock, William was only seven or eight years old when he became Duke of Normandy. He had a long struggle to consolidate his power.</p>
<p>But with his conquest of England he achieved long-lasting fame and influence. His legacy includes the central keep of the Tower of London, and the Domesday Book.</p>
<p>Homebuyers who like associations with power may be drawn to this five-bedroom house overlooking the 600-acre Holmwood Common, which William inherited from King Harold following the Norman Conquest and which is now owned by the National Trust.</p>

<h1> The best places to downsize to, with doctors, green spaces and amenities in walking distance </h1>
<p> Our four-part series finds the best places to buy a home in England at every stage of life, from first-time buyers to downsizers </p>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:47pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The downsizer market has emerged as a distinct anomaly during the post-pandemic house price boom.</p>
<p>The shift to home working and home schooling brought a rush of families desperate to move to larger properties in the wake of lockdown. But it also meant that older homeowners became much less keen to move to smaller properties.</p>
<p>These are the best places to buy in every region in England.</p>
<p>The London Borough of Merton and the City of Westminster ranked first and fifth in the country respectively. </p>
<p>Buyers here are more likely to be attracted to the wealth of theatres and restaurants in London’s West End. They are paying sky high prices for it – the average home costs £1,459,616. </p>
<p>But in <a>relative terms, this is a bargain</a>. Downsizers buying in central London are moving at the perfect time to take advantage of pandemic price trends.</p>
<p>Claire Reynolds, of Savills’ Mayfair office, said: “We see downsizers primarily from north west London, selling big houses in Hampstead, Highgate and St John’s Wood and moving to Mayfair.”</p>
<p>They are trading houses for lateral, portered flats. The move is the ultimate price play. The value of family homes in fringe London locations has surged just as the value of central London flats has declined. </p>
<p>Prices across the town have climbed 10pc in a year. “We have just sold a house on Old Bath Road with a guide price of £600,000. It had 45 viewings and is under offer at £751,000,” said Mr Day.</p>
<p>Supply is low. “We have 12 available homes right now, normally we would have 28 or 30,” said Mr Day. The numbers are likely to stay down as Covid cases rise. </p>
<p>Cambridge was the top performer in the East of England, while Epsom and Ewell in Surrey was top in the South East. House prices in each were £535,649 and £558,476 respectively.</p>
<p>Newcastle upon Tyne in the North East was the top performer across the North. Homes here cost £218,957. </p>
<p>Demand for bungalows – many of which can be found in the popular NE13 postcode on the edge of Gosforth – however, is strong. </p>
<p>In the North West, the top spot was Wirral in Merseyside, where the average home cost £231,538. Leeds was number one in Yorkshire and the Humber, with average values at £254,165.</p>
<p>Worcester in the West Midlands was the third best place to move in England. It sits just north of the Malvern Hills AONB, but has 6.1 healthcare facilities for every 10,000 residents, the highest ratio in the top 10.</p>
<p>In the East Midlands, Broxtowe, on the western edge of Nottingham, ranked highest. All residents are within a 17-minute <a>journey time of a local town centre</a>. Homes cost £242,287.</p>
<h1> The best places to live with good secondary schools – and where teenagers won’t get bored </h1>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 4 January 2022 • 7:49pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Moving for better value, green space, larger homes and a more relaxed lifestyle is a booming pandemic era trend. But one group of people may hate you for it: your teenagers.</p>
<p>Parents planning moves with older children need <a>good schools</a> and easy access to local amenities, such as sports facilities, cinemas and shops – places where their kids can meet friends without needing a begrudging chauffeur.</p>
<p>So where can you find these areas? Savills estate agents has devised a metric for house hunters with teenage children.</p>
<p>It analysed English local authorities in the top half of the deprivation index, which ranks areas by factors such as life expectancy.</p>
<p>The hotspots in the North West and North East were Wirral in Merseyside, where homes cost £231,538, and Northumberland, where homes cost £233,301.</p>
<p>The East of England is home to the second and third top spots for buyers with teenagers: the commuter district of East Hertfordshire, which covers the market town of Bishop’s Stortford, and Brentwood in Essex.</p>
<p>Education is key. There are 14 secondary schools rated good or outstanding across East Hertfordshire. On average, everyone in the district can walk or get public transport to a town centre within 21 minutes. Homes here cost £498,896.</p>
<p>“There are also bowling alleys, a cinema, a youth centre, the Southmill Arts Centre for plays and shows, and direct trains to London and Cambridge,” said Mr Phillips.</p>
<p>Prices have climbed by 5pc to 8pc per year for the last two years, he added. Supply is down 30pc on normal levels, and offers 10pc over guide price are common.</p>
<p>In the South West, East Devon, which sits on the coast just east of Exeter, was top. Homes here cost £372,809.</p>
<p>“We have had a lot of people moving in from nearby towns such as Redditch, just because of the schooling,” said Mr Bennett. Four-bedroom properties here start from £400,000 – a £100,000 premium on the local average.</p>
<p>Competition for property is fierce. Mr Bennett noted a house that sold five months ago for £250,000; the owners have just resold the property for £285,000. “They did nothing to the property except decorate one room.”</p>
<p>The London Borough of Kingston upon Thames, which sits across the Thames just south of Richmond Park, was the top-performing urban location for buyers moving with teenage children. </p>
<p>There are 0.6 good or outstanding secondary schools for every 10,000 people, including The Kingston Academy. Across the borough, the nearest town centre was always within a 13-minute walk or public transport journey. Homes cost £634,214.</p>
<p>It was followed by the London Borough of Sutton, on the border with Surrey, where<a> homes cost £480,434</a>.</p>

<header> <h1> Five ways you can unwittingly damage your house price </h1> <p> Bold colours and overly-ambitious asking prices can knock thousands from a property’s value </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Rachel Mortimer <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:14pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Property prices have soared at a record pace as desperate buyers have jostled for the limited number of new homes on the market.</p>
<p>Telegraph Money spoke to property experts about the most common ways you could <a>accidentally damage your house price</a>.</p>
<p>Robin Gould, of buying agency Prime Purchase, warned an over-personalised property was a big deterrent for potential buyers. </p>
<p>"I viewed a property on behalf of a client which had an outdoor swimming pool with a tiled mural of the owner on the bottom. Why any buyer would want a lasting reminder of the previous owner is beyond me," he said. </p>
<p>"Unsurprisingly, the client didn’t buy it. But if the vendor did eventually find a buyer, one of the first jobs would have been to retile the pool, which could easily have cost hundreds, if not thousands of pounds."</p>
<p>A survey of more than 2,000 adults by GoCompare Home Insurance found one in ten would be <a>put off buying a home</a> with over-the-top décor or carpets. An untidy house was a red flag for 18pc of respondents. </p>
<p>Sarah Cull of Strutt Parker, an estate agency, said being too bold with colour and styles in rooms which were expensive to change, such as kitchens and bathrooms, was especially off putting. </p>
<h2>2. Overdeveloping your home </h2>
<p>As the saying goes, less is more. Overdeveloping a house and making it too big for its plot can knock tens of thousands of pounds from its price tag, according to Ms Cull. </p>
<p>"Owners have the best intentions when extending or adding to their house, but if it doesn't balance with the garden space then it can really devalue a home," Ms Cull said.</p>
<p>"It really does depend on the price of the property, but say a house was on the market for between £700,000 and £800,000 then overdevelopment is capable of reducing the price by £50,000." </p>
<a>consent rules can be complex</a> and it is not always clear what changes need permission. This, warned Ms Cull, has often led to issues when selling.
<p>In some lucky cases retrospective permission, awarded after works are completed, can be granted, but anyone buying the property risks instead being ordered by the council to revert the property back to its original state. </p>
<h2>4. Getting the garden wrong </h2>
<p>Since the pandemic began outdoor space has become the most valuable property feature. The so-called "race for space" amongst buyers has caused double-digit price rises for homes with large gardens and other green space.</p>
<p>The survey of house hunters by GoCompare found more than half of buyers would now be deterred from buying a home without a garden. </p>
<p>But over-complicated and poorly designed gardens can also reduce a property's value, rather than add to it, Mr Gould warned. </p>
<p>"Everyone loves a garden but if you make it too fiddly and all-consuming, it can be very off putting," he said. </p>
<h2>5. Over-ambitious pricing </h2>
<p>The average house price <a>rose by 10pc in the year to November 2021</a>, according to mortgage lender Nationwide, and an acute shortage of homes on the market means a record number of sellers are achieving above asking price. </p>
<p>"The strongest market response is always in the first two weeks of exposure. Lots of people waste this optimal sales period by being too optimistic on price and dampening their response," Mr Peel said. </p>
<p>"If you reduce the price at a later date in order to agree a sale, you won’t get what you might have done if you’d been realistic from the start and had competing buyers.</p>
<p>He added: "It happened to a flat in St Margarets, in Richmond, last autumn, which started with an asking price of £500,000 and ended up selling for £460,000, when it should have achieved £480,000 with a £475,000 starting price."</p>

<header> <h1> Government’s landmark fix to free homeowners from cladding scandal proved pointless </h1> <p> Checks still required for cladded buildings under 18m as ministers accused of ‘hiding from the crisis’ </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 14 December 2021 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Government’s landmark cladding policy has turned out to be pointless and potentially dangerous after it was overruled by a property industry consensus.</p>
<p>The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, a professional body, has defied the Government guidance, announced in July, that external wall safety (EWS1) forms should no longer be required for buildings less than 18m high.</p>
<p>Rics’ Independent Standards and Regulation Board has confirmed that it will not <a>change its guidance for valuers</a> to request the forms.</p>
<p>This means that people living in an estimated 77,500 blocks between 11m and 18m high will still need to pass an EWS1 to make their properties mortgageable. In some cases the cost of remedial works are <a>£100,000 per leaseholder</a>.</p>
<p>Dame Janet Paraskeva, of Rics, said: “Rics must not let this critical issue be swept under the carpet because the correct inspections have not taken place.” </p>
<p>She added: “This is so that purchasers do not risk finding themselves trapped in flats of any height because potentially crippling costs are ignored and passed unwittingly onto them.”</p>
<p>A Government spokesman said: “We’re disappointed by this decision as it lacks ambition to solve the problems that countless people, families and households are experiencing.</p>
<p>“We expect Rics to work harder with lenders to protect leaseholders in flats that are safe from unnecessary anxiety and mortgage delays, which their EWS1 process is causing.</p>
<p>“Our view is supported by independent specialists, who say excessive industry caution is leaving many leaseholders in lower risk buildings <a>unable to sell</a>, or facing bills for work which is often unnecessary.”</p>
<header> <h1> Why your new-build flat could be worth 40pc less than you think </h1> <p> Buyers pay a premium for new-build flats but their value trails rising property prices </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 20 October 2021 • 9:54am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Hidden new-build premiums are trapping first-time buyers caught out by flats whose values dramatically trail rising local property prices, new research has found.</p>
<p>Findings from housing analysts BuiltPlace have shown the large gap that opens up between the price growth of new-build flats and other local properties.</p>
<p>In areas worst affected by the trend such as Leeds, where the cladding crisis has depressed the resale value of new-build flats, properties bought in 2000 have lagged the rising local prices by 40 percentage points.</p>
<p>Lenders have been spooked and are now largely unwilling to offer mortgages to buyers with small deposits on new-build flats. </p>
<a>when the scheme ends in 2023</a>, experts have warned of a new-build mortgage black hole for
<p>In Leeds, flats bought new in 2000 lagged rising local property prices by 25 percentage points when sold 10 years later. After 20 years, the gap had widened to 40 percentage points.</p>
<p>In Northumberland, over the same 20-year period, new-build flat prices trailed the local market by 30 percentage points.</p>
<p>In addition to lost premiums, the second-hand new-build home market has been hit hard by the building safety crisis in the wake of the 2017 Grenfell fire.</p>
<p>Scott Bacon, of William H Brown estate agents in Leeds, said the cladding scandal had depressed local <a>new-build resale values</a>. </p>
<a>half their asking price</a>,” he said.
<p>Leeds had been particularly badly affected because it was a compact city centre with a high density of recent construction, said Mr Bacon.</p>
<h2>First-time buyers bear brunt</h2>
<p>Government schemes such as Help to Buy and <a>shared ownership</a>, which allows buyers to get a mortgage on only a portion of a property and pay rent on the rest, mean that first-time buyers are hit hardest by disappearing new-build premiums.</p>
<p>When Steve Lewis, 49, bought his first home, a two-bedroom, shared-ownership flat in north London in July 2018, the property’s total sale price was £473,000.</p>
<p>Last summer, when Mr Lewis wanted to increase the 30pc share that he owned, he got an independent valuation. This found that the property’s value was £400,000 – a drop of nearly a fifth in just two years. </p>
<p>“It pushed me close to negative equity. Despite two years of repayments, I was effectively on a 100pc mortgage. I was absolutely on the edge,” said Mr Lewis. </p>
<p>“I was expecting a fall because of the pandemic, but I was very surprised the drop was that big. It was a real shock,” he added.</p>
<p>Over longer periods, while the prices of new-build properties has risen, they have done so at a much slower rate than the wider market.</p>
<p>Separate analysis by Hamptons estate agents found that in 2021, people who sold new-build flats after 11 to 15 years of ownership made average gains of just 6pc.</p>
<p>They made an average cash profit of £15,888, but this was just one fifth of the £78,376 cash gains made by people who sold second-hand flats over the same period. These properties made average gains of 35pc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people who sold second-hand houses across the same period made £99,543 in cash – a price jump of 42pc. The new-build house price rise, by contrast, was roughly half this, at just 25pc.</p>
<h2>The Help to Buy black hole</h2>
<p>The end of the scheme will leave a gaping hole in new-build lending, with few lenders willing to offer mortgages on new-build homes to buyers with small deposits. </p>
<p>Nick Whitten, of property advisers JLL, said: “Help to Buy has underpinned 30pc of new build sales since it began – there is going to be a big gap to fill.”</p>
<p>Mr Hudson warned that if buyers were suddenly <a>unable to get mortgages</a> to <a>buy new-build properties</a>, demand would fall sharply. That could lead to levels of house building falling by a third, he added.</p>
<header> <h1> Demand for prime-value homes spikes as coronavirus deepens wealth divide </h1> <p> Sales are booming at the top of the English housing market but those at the lower end will be hard hit </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 10 June 2020 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>Pent-up demand has led to a dramatic resurgence in property sales in England but this is led by prime properties – leading to fears the trend could polarise the market and deepen the country's wealth divide.</p>
<p>The housing market is <a>recovering from a seven-week freeze</a> that suspended an <a>estimated 373,000 transactions</a> and saw <a>agreed sales plummet</a> to just 10pc of the pre-lockdown level.</p>
<p>In the first week of June, the number of agreed sales in England jumped 54pc compared with the previous week, according to estate agents Savills. This was also 6pc higher than the average weekly sales rate in June 2019.</p>
<p>In the same week, buyer demand (measured by the number of enquiries) was up 54pc compared with the beginning of March, according to property portal Zoopla. The number of properties listed for sale was also up by 5pc.</p>
<a>New sales in London are lagging behind</a> as buyers look at commuting and moving into the regions.”
<p>The number of sales agreed by Savills was up 108pc last week compared with the previous week. But in the Home Counties, the number rose 148pc, driven by activity in locations including Henley, Harpenden, Marlow, Farnham and Guildford.</p>
<p>Andrew Perratt, of Savills, added that buyers in the Cotswolds, Devon and Cornwall were looking to replace their second homes with larger primary residences.</p>
<p>Lucian Cook of Savills said: "Coronavirus has widened the gap between the haves and the have nots.”</p>
<p>Lenders have also largely withdrawn mortgages for buyers with small savings with only a handful of options for those with a 5pc-10pc deposit.</p>
<p>For those who have kept their job during lockdown will likely have been able to save more.</p>
<p>“That will act as a cap on who is able to take advantage of the record low interest rates,” said Mr Cook.</p>
<a>been cut out of the market</a>. If a buyer cannot get a mortgage, low interest rates only serve to widen the gap between homeowners trading up and those priced out of the market.
<p>There remains debate on whether the shift in the market is a knee-jerk response to the lockdown or a sustainable trend as the surge in sales has not translated into higher prices.</p>
<p>Before coronavirus, properties were being sold at 98pc of asking price, Mr Cook said, but now offers were averaging 95pc.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she had to reduce the rent by £200 per month because of falling city rental demand during the pandemic. In a painful mirror image, Ms Holland’s monthly income on the property has fallen from £1,300 to £1,100.</p>
<p>Including management costs, ground rent and insurance, Ms Holland is now losing £500 per month on the flat. “I can’t sell because it is valued at £0, I can’t do anything,” she said.</p>
<p>The initial jump is small, but it is just the beginning. Homeowners trapped by cladding have already had to grapple with high unexpected remedial costs.</p>
<p>Homeowners trying to move house have also been caught out – they cannot commit to a new fixed-term if they want to sell. But this has been complicated due to external wall safety form requirements dragging out transactions.</p>
<header> <h1> What the increase in interest rates means for house prices and mortgages </h1> <p> UK housing market forecast: mortgages will become unaffordable if interest rates rise to 1.5pc </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 16 December 2021 • 3:06pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The Bank Rate rise from its record low of 0.1pc to 0.25pc will be a blow to the housing market.</p>
<p>Further rises are on the near horizon, posing a looming threat to housing market affordability and home prices.</p>
<p>Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research firm, has forecast that when interest rates rise, house price growth will fall from 9pc in 2021 to flatline at the start of 2022, rising to only 2.5pc by the end of next year.</p>
<p>“House prices will be very responsive to a higher Bank Rates because they depend on new mortgage rates, not on the effective rate,” it said.</p>
<h2>More rate rises are coming</h2>
<p>Earlier in the autumn, in anticipation of rate rises, lenders have already increased mortgage rates by a third and are quickly <a>pulling sub-1pc deals</a> from the market.</p>
<p>Any rate rise will hit hard in the wake of rapid house price growth that has dramatically reduced affordability. In short, it would trigger the <a>end of the house price boom</a>.</p>
<h2>Hikes will hammer affordability</h2>
<p>When the Bank Rate was at 0.1pc, a homeowner spent 38pc of the median income to service an 80pc mortgage on an average priced home – or £827 per month, according to Capital Economics consultants.</p>
<p>A hike to 3pc would mean a £200 jump in monthly payments, even if it was partially absorbed by the banks. This would take the cost to 47.5pc of earnings.</p>
<h2>The role of growing house prices</h2>
<p>The last time mortgages were so expensive, homes were cheaper in relation to earnings. In the last three months of 2008, the average house cost 6.3 times average earnings. Today, it is 7.4 times.</p>
<p>Yet if rates rise significantly, buyers will no longer be shielded from reality, and buying power would evaporate.</p>
<p>This would come at a bad time for the housing market. The artificial incentive of the stamp duty holiday is long over. Record house price growth has started to hit affordability and the Help to Buy scheme is winding down.</p>
<h2>The spectre of forced sellers</h2>
<p>A Bank Rate hike to 2pc would bring mortgage rates of around 4pc and trigger a jump in households struggling to repay their mortgages, said Mr Wishart.</p>
<h2>British homeowners would be hit harder</h2>
<p>Rate rises pose a bigger risk to the British housing market than in other countries such as the United States because a larger share of homeowners here are on variable rate mortgages, said Vicky Redwood, of Capital Economics. </p>
<p>The British market has been moving towards fixed-rate mortgages. Between April and June this year, 6pc of new mortgages issued in the UK were on variable rates – down from 21pc in the same period in 2015. In the US, the share was 3.6pc. </p>
<p>Problems of affordability will show up much faster in Britain than in America, Mr Wishart said.</p>
<header> <h1> What will happen to house prices in 2022? </h1> <p> Analysts predict the boom will end next year </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Melissa Lawford <time> 25 December 2021 • 10:00pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>The madness of the housing market boom will end in 2022 as analysts have forecast a major slowdown in price growth.</p>
<p><a>Rising mortgage costs</a>, a <a>squeeze on affordability</a> and the end of the <a>stamp duty holiday</a> will <a>cool the red-hot market</a>, experts have warned.</p>
<a>significantly cooler market</a>.
<p>The Centre for Economics Business Research, a consultancy, predicted 2pc, while estate agents Savills, Connells and Hamptons all said 3.5pc. Strutt Parker estate agents said prices would rise by 7pc.</p>
<a>has cooled</a>. In June it was 50pc above the five-year average but by mid-December that figure had fallen to just 4pc.
<a>not beholden to mortgage lenders</a> and willing to pay over the odds – is no longer an important factor, said Richard Donnell of Zoopla. He said: “All of those moves by wealthy older homeowners have moderated now.”
<p>Next year the market will depend more on buyers who take on substantial mortgages, meaning all eyes will be on interest rates. Markets expect another rise in Bank Rate, to 0.5pc, in February. </p>
<p>In addition, the Help to Buy “equity loan” scheme, which lets first-timers buy new-builds with a 5pc deposit, ends in 2023 and there is likely to be a spike in sales beforehand, fuelling demand and prices.</p>
<p>Mr Cook said <a>another lockdown</a> would also delay the flow of homes for sale in the new year, despite early spring being known as selling season.</p>
<p>Neal Hudson of Residential Analysts, a research company, said: “The first half of 2022 could see stronger prices than people predict.”</p>
<p>The market for recently built flats, however, will continue to struggle, Mr Hudson said. Many leaseholders are stuck in properties that are unmortgageable without expensive remediation work in the wake of the Grenfell fire.</p>

<header> <h1> John Deere's autonomous tractor lets farmers put their feet up </h1> <p> Driverless machine can be operated from a smartphone </p> </header>
<div> <div> By James Titcomb <time> 5 January 2022 • 6:16pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Early mornings, cold weather and isolation tilling the fields before planting their crops could be a thing of the past for farmers after John Deere unveiled an autonomous tractor that can be operated from a smartphone.</p>
<p>The US farm equipment maker said it planned to sell the self-driving system later this year after announcing it at the CES technology show in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>It features three pairs of cameras at the front and another three at the rear that survey the tractor’s surroundings. </p>
<p>They are processed by the onboard artificial intelligence system every 100 milliseconds, allowing the vehicle it to remain on course within less than an inch of its directions, or avoid collisions.</p>
<p>The tractor still contains a steering wheel and seat allowing farmers to drive it.</p>
<p>It is hoped that autonomous tractors could allow farmers to take advantage of the often-slim window in the spring months during which weather conditions are suitable for tilling fields before crops are planted. </p>
<p>John Deere, America’s biggest seller of farming equipment, did not announce a price for the autonomous system, which can be added to existing tractors. </p>
<p>It said it was considering whether to lease or sell the system, which will be sold as an add-on to its 8-series tractors, or charge a subscription fee. </p>
<p>The company said the technology was ready for widespread production but was planning a slow launch this year of up to 20 tractors this year, before expanding it more widely.</p>
<p>Driverless vehicle technology is seen as likely to be in use on farms before public roads since a lack of traffic and junctions makes it less likely to put lives at risk or cause accidents.</p>
<p>The company said automation was vital to helping agriculture meet soaring global food demand, which is expected to increase by 50pc in the next 30 years due to a growing and more wealthy population.</p>
