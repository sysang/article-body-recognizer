<h1>Who is Ghislaine Maxwell and what has she been found guilty of?</h1>
<div><h2>What do we know about Ghislaine Maxwell? What were the charges brought against her? What happened in the trial?</h2><div><h5>By Samantha Selinger-Morris and Luc Cohen</h5><time>December 30, 2021</time></div></div>
<p>One-time British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell stood with her hands folded as the jury filed out. She glanced at her siblings as she herself was led from the courtroom back to one of New York’s most squalid and dangerous jails.</p>
<p>She did not hug her lawyers on the way out after being found guilty of luring underage girls to be sexually abused the <a>late American financier Jeffrey Epstein</a>, her once companion, boyfriend, boss.</p>
<p>It was as far from her privileged origins as one can imagine.</p>
<p>Maxwell was found guilty of five of six counts related to sex trafficking nearly 18 months after her arrest and arrival at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn on July 6, 2020.</p>
<p>Epstein, a disgraced billionaire hedge-fund manager and convicted sex offender, had pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking charges and was awaiting trial when he died in prison on August 10, 2019. His death was ruled a suicide.</p>
<p>She was acquitted of enticing a minor to travel to engage in criminal sex acts.</p>
<p>She will face court on separate perjury charges at a later date.</p>
<p>The charges stemmed from testimony from four women who said Maxwell enabled and sometimes participated in their sexual abuse more than a decade ago when they were under 18.</p>
<p>But her defence lawyers argued at the start of the trial that Maxwell was a scapegoat for prosecutors denied an Epstein conviction.</p>
<p>“Ever since Eve was accused of tempting Adam with the apple, women have been blamed for the bad behaviour of men,” lawyer Bobbi Sternheim said in her opening remarks.</p>
<h3><b>Who is Ghislaine Maxwell?</b></h3>
<p>Ghislaine, left with a reported trust fund that paid $US100,000 ($137,000) a year, moved to New York City in 1991 to start anew.</p>
<a>Jeffrey Epstein</a>, who, according to
<p>She introduced Epstein to powerful friends, including former US president Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York. Together, the pair socialised with Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Maxwell was arrested by the FBI on July 2 in a mansion in New Hampshire.</p>
<h3><b>What were the legal proceedings relating to Maxwell?</b></h3>
<p>Maxwell’s separate perjury charges stem from statements she made in connection with a now-settled defamation suit against her, in which she denied knowledge of Epstein’s abuse of girls.</p>
<p>Maxwell was charged with two counts of violating the Mann Act, which bars transporting people across state lines for illegal sexual activity.</p>
<p>Those charges relate mainly to the testimony of a <a>woman known by the pseudonym Jane</a>, who testified that Epstein first abused her when she was 14 in 1994, and that Maxwell participated in some of their sexual encounters.</p>
<p>Maxwell also faced two charges of conspiring to violate the Mann Act.</p>
<h3>The sex trafficking charges</h3>
<p>Maxwell also faced one charge of sex trafficking of a minor and one charge of sex trafficking conspiracy. Federal law bars recruiting or transporting anyone under 18 to participate in a “commercial sex act”.</p>
<a>the testimony of Carolyn</a>, the first name of a woman who said she was 14 in 2002 when she first had sexual contact with Epstein. She testified that Maxwell sometimes paid her hundreds of dollars after she gave Epstein erotic massages.
<p>She also said Maxwell would call her to schedule massage appointments for Epstein and would sometimes send a cab or a town car to pick her up at home and bring her to Epstein’s estate.</p>
<h3>What is Maxwell’s defence</h3>
<p>Maxwell, 59, pleaded not guilty to all of the charges. Her lawyers argued that prosecutors were treating her as a scapegoat for Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.</p>
<a>were corrupted over the decades</a> and that the women only implicated Maxwell because they thought cooperating with prosecutors would help claims they made to a victims’ compensation fund run by Epstein’s estate.
<h3>Did prosecutors have to prove Maxwell knew what Epstein was doing?</h3>
<p>In her closing argument, Maxwell defence lawyer Laura Menninger said Epstein kept many secrets, arguing that prosecutors had not proven that Maxwell knew that Epstein was having sexual encounters with teenage girls.</p>
<p>In her rebuttal, prosecutor Maurene Comey countered, “Of course she knew”.</p>
<a> if they showed that she deliberately took steps to avoid confirming key facts</a>, according to an instruction US District Judge Alison Nathan gave jurors before they began deliberations.
<h3>What happened during the trial?</h3>
<p>“They were exploiting kids,” Pomerantz said. “They were trafficking kids for sex.”</p>
<p>“Epstein’s death left a gaping hole in the pursuit of justice for many of these women,” Sternheim said. “She’s filling that hole, and filling that empty chair.”</p>
<p>The key witness: A woman known by the pseudonym Jane testified that Epstein first abused her in 1994, when Jane was just 14.</p>
<p>Maxwell sometimes took part in sexual encounters with Jane and Epstein, and acted as if it were normal, Jane testified.</p>
<p>“It made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me,” she said. “I’d never seen anything like this or felt anything like this.”</p>
<p>“I was sitting in a room full of strangers and telling them the most shameful, deepest secrets that I’d been carrying around with me my whole life,” she said.</p>
<p>The massage table: Prosecutors displayed for the jury <a>a green massage table</a> that was seized from Epstein’s Palm Beach estate in 2005. Three of the four accusers said they gave Epstein massages that escalated into sexual activity.</p>
<p>Pomerantz called the word massage a “ruse designed to get young girls to touch Epstein”.</p>
<a>Maxwell’s and Epstein’s intimate relationship during the 1990s</a>. The never-before-seen digital photographs showed Maxwell kissing Epstein on the cheek or rubbing his bare foot.
<p>The testimony: A woman known by her first name, Carolyn, testified that Maxwell once touched Carolyn’s breasts and buttocks while Carolyn was nude and told her she had a “great body for Mr Epstein and his friends”.</p>
<p>“Money will not ever fix what that woman has done to me,” Carolyn said, sobbing on the stand.</p>
<p>“You know that if any information you submitted is false, you can be in criminal trouble?” Pagliuca said, referring to the fund.</p>
<p>“When you have post-event suggestion or intervention, people get very confident about their wrong answers,” Loftus testified.</p>
<p>Maxwell’s only statement: Minutes before the defence rested its case, Maxwell stood up, and with Sternheim’s arm around her lower back, told US District Judge Alison Nathan that she was declining to testify in her own defence.</p>
<p>“Your honour, the government has not proven the case beyond a reasonable doubt, and so there is no need for me to testify,” Maxwell said.</p>
<h3>Why do we keep hearing from Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who is not among the alleged victims of Maxwell’s criminal trial?</h3>
<p>Andrew vehemently denies all allegations against him.</p>
<h3>What are some of Giuffre’s allegations against Maxwell?</h3>
<p>Giuffre has also alleged that Maxwell and Epstein directed her to have sex with Prince Andrew, Duke of York, on three occasions, when she was 17 and 18. Prince Andrew has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Giuffre has now launched separate civil proceedings against the duke, which will be heard in California early in 2022. </p>
<h3>What happens to Maxwell now?</h3>
<p>Maxwell faces up to 65 years in prison for the five convictions. The most serious charge, sex trafficking, has a maximum prison term of 40 years.</p>
<p>US District Judge Alison Nathan did not say when Maxwell would be sentenced.</p>
<p>Sternheim told reporters the defence was disappointed with the verdict and would appeal.</p>
<p>“We have already started working on the appeal, and we are confident that she will be vindicated,” Sternheim said outside court.</p>
<p>To succeed, her lawyers would have to show that the judge violated federal rules of evidence or abused her discretion, and that the error impacted the verdict.</p>
<p>Maxwell returns to Brooklyn’s notorious Metropolitan Detention Centre, where she has been held in isolation since July 2020. She has said she has been served mouldy food at the jail and that the smell of raw sewage has permeated her cell.</p>

<div>‘How did we get here?’ After years of silence, Sharon fixed her relationship with her sister</div>
<h1>‘How did we get here?’ After years of silence, Sharon fixed her relationship with her sister</h1>
<h2>Life is full of fraught encounters. In the “How Do You Do It?” series, Samantha Selinger-Morris examines the prickly scenarios we sometimes find ourselves in and asks experts how best to deal with them.</h2>
<p>Growing up in a “good Catholic family”, Sharon remembers being a huge support for her older sister who gave birth out of wedlock when she was in her early 20s.</p>
<p>Sharon (who wishes to remain anonymous for privacy reasons) was 14 at the time, and she remembers her religious father’s dreadful reaction.</p>
<p>“He just kind of shut her out, he was horrific,” she says. (Though he later “fell in love” with the baby, Matthew.)</p>
<p>“We’d see each other at a funeral, and go, ‘God, seriously, we can’t even talk at a funeral’,” says Sharon, an aged care provider in Sydney.</p>
<p>The estrangement began when Sharon’s sister turned 60. Though she knew it was her sister’s birthday the next day, she had been working around the clock on a big project.</p>
<p>“All the night before, I’m like, ‘I’ve got to be up early, it’s her birthday. I’ve got to remember to call her.’ I didn’t call her.” In the chaos, she forgot.</p>
<p>Two days later, her sister sent her a text: “How dare you.”</p>
<p>“It just went really nasty,” says Sharon, who then called her sister. “It just blew up. She was like, ‘Everything I’ve done for you’.”</p>
<p>Sharon’s sister had supported her financially when she separated from her husband, and taken her on a trip overseas. “She just threw every single thing back at me in a text.’”</p>
<p>She thought they might never speak again.</p>
<p>At times, she would be hit, anew, with the shock that they hadn’t spoken in years, that they were estranged – something neither she nor her sister had decided to do.</p>
<p>It is a common experience with estrangement, says Bruce Smythe, a professor of family studies at the Australian National University.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think it’d be different if you were dwelling on it daily, but the fact is, you don’t. You get on with life, and you just do stuff.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Estrangement, he says, is more likely with family members who were once very close.</p>
<p>“They say hatred is love with its back turned,” says Smythe. “The closer you are to someone and the more you know about them, and all those little hooks you can put into love, the more pronounced the opposite can be.</p>
<p>The impact – from family members no longer being there for one another – can be devastating.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s even harder because you’ve got that constant reminder of this sort of individual who should be part of your life, but who isn’t.”</p>
<p>Estrangement can lead to positive personal growth, however, if it’s taken as an opportunity to do some self-reflection, Hunt says.</p>
<p>So how can others end an estrangement?</p>
<p>“It’s also that notion of empathy, putting yourself in the shoes of another person as well,” she says. “To think about how they’re feeling as well, sometimes that can actually take the heat out of a situation.”</p>
<p>Sharon, whose prognosis is good, is relieved the estrangement is over.</p>

<div>‘People don’t like being lied to’: How do you tell your child they’re the product of IVF?</div>
<h1>‘People don’t like being lied to’: How do you tell your child they’re the product of IVF?</h1>
<p>Whenever Dr Melissa Cameron hears that a patient plans on not telling their child that they’re the result of IVF, she bristles.</p>
<p>Unlike 30 years ago, when IVF was surrounded with stigma, fertility treatment is now common. More than 8 million people have been born worldwide from the treatment, and an estimated one in 20 Australian babies now result from the process.</p>
<p>So why do people struggle over the decision to tell their children how they came into the world? What are the emotional and psychological ramifications if parents keep their children in the dark about it?</p>
<p>Then there’s the trauma that comes with the treatment.</p>
<p>“It’s really hard and can be quite associated with a lot of anxiety, depression and mental health challenges,” says Cameron. “And for some people, you might not want to kind of go back there to tell that story.”</p>
<p>But for children who aren’t told, the fall-out can be serious and long-lasting.</p>
<p>He recalls a “very angry” teenager who found out in a school playground that he was conceived with donor sperm, through a cousin whose parents had deduced what had happened.</p>
<p>This is reflected in research on the topic, with one study showing that families who disclosed their children’s origins to them early on in their life experienced lower levels of anxiety, stress and depression.</p>
<p>When is the best time to tell children about how they came into the world? And how?</p>
<p>“It becomes part of your story, and part of your kids’ story, so that it doesn’t become as awkward as it might otherwise be. Keeping secrets is hard.”</p>
<blockquote><p>‘Children deserve to feel proud of who they are.’</p></blockquote>
<p>Parents can be reassured that telling their children they’re the product of fertility treatment can be something of a bonus.</p>
<p>“They appreciate the fact that their parents are being honest with them, and have told them what’s happened,” says Dr Frank Quinn, a fertility specialist at IVF Australia in Sydney.</p>
<p>“Children deserve to feel proud of who they are.”</p>
<p>“We can personalise a lot of medicine now if we have that data,” she says.</p>
<p>Is there perhaps a silver lining to having to have the IVF conversation with a child, such as not having to speak to your kids about your sex life?</p>
<p>It’s not quite that simple.</p>
<div>Mastering those hard, unavoidable COVID conversations</div>
<div><p>For our free coronavirus pandemic coverage, learn more here.</p></div>
<p>You feel your stomach drop and your temples ache. No, it’s not COVID, but rather one of the trickiest social landmines many of us have ever had to navigate, brought on by the pandemic.</p>
<p>So, how can people with different comfort levels best communicate their needs and concerns with each other without alienating each other?</p>
<blockquote><p>“Often times, the question itself won’t be a bad question to ask, it’s more about the way that we communicate it in an open, respectful and empathetic way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If we don’t? “We risk losing that connection with our friends and our family members,” she says, noting that this could result in losing the relationship entirely.</p>
<p>The key to maintaining our “likeability” while also asserting our needs, is to make your communication as “frictionless” as possible, says Elkins.</p>
<p>The first step is to remove emotion from the conversation, she says.</p>
<p>And know, at the end of the day, that it’s normal to feel anxiety over these conversations.</p>
<p>And remember, adds Elkins, that having a difficult conversation is better than the alternative.</p>
<p>“I think we always feel better once we’ve had the conversations, rather than not having the conversations. It’s the avoidance of the conversation that’s causing the tension.”</p>
<div>A fairytale wedding in a Scottish castle... or mum and dad’s place</div>
<p>If COVID-19 put life on hold, it was the brides and grooms who were among those feeling the pause most keenly. Many were forced to scrap their original plans, and completely re-envision their big day.</p>
<i>My Best Friend’s Wedding</i> and
<i>The Usual Suspects.</i> Alas, she ended up choosing an at-home wedding on Zoom, wearing a dress from an op shop.
<p>When COVID-19 landed, they shelved their wedding plans and decided to start from scratch.</p>
<p>But not all pandemic wedding changes stick.</p>
<p>Publicist Stephanie Taylor from East Melbourne had one idea – a big country wedding – which switched to a small wedding at a Melbourne beachside location. But when restrictions lifted? She went back to the country wedding idea.</p>
<p>Still, with so many cancellations over the past two years venues have a huge backlog. Many of them only have weekdays on offer for newly engaged couples wishing to wed in 2022.</p>

<div>‘Mental load’ solution is men stepping up, not women stepping down</div>
<div><h3>Opinion</h3><h1>‘Mental load’ solution is men stepping up, not women stepping down</h1></div>
<div><div><div><h5>Megan Blandford</h5>Writer</div><div> <span><time>December 10, 2021 — 5.30am</time></span></div></div></div>
<p>Another day, another article about the mental load that’s carried by the females in heterosexual couples with kids.</p>
<p>The statistic, according to the latest HILDA (Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia) report, looks like this: women are doing about 21 hours a week more than men in these unpaid tasks.</p>
<p>This is an important conversation: it’s a heavy burden – it’s called the mental load – and it’s well and truly time to discuss how it affects us, and how it can be eased.</p>
<p>But in reading more pieces around this study that acknowledge the mental load, analyse it, and pose possible solutions, I feel the same dismay that I always feel at the conclusion of these conversations.</p>
<p>The solution, they always say, is for women to step down. Stop doing all the things, they tell us, and it’ll sort itself out. Your partner, they say, will eventually get the hint and take on more.</p>
<p>And women everywhere cry-laugh.</p>
<p>It simply doesn’t work. We cannot just let these things go, and wait for someone to pick them up, as is suggested to us time after time.</p>
<p>Women talk all the time about how this problem can be solved, and we grow frustrated because it feels impossible. Here’s why: we’re not the ones to solve this. The wrong people are discussing the issue.</p>
<p>It’s time that these articles start talking to the men in these so-called partnerships.</p>
<p>Let’s start here. Men: step up. The load can’t drop to the ground, so you need to hold your arms out ready to catch the excess that we need to let go.</p>
<p>First, remember that you most likely chose to start a family with your partner because you love and respect her. Letting her carry the majority of the load shows neither love nor respect.</p>
<p>And for goodness sake, don’t expect a medal for any of it. Things just need to be done.</p>
<div><div><div>Megan Blandford is a Melbourne-based writer.</div></div></div>
<div>Hugo Weaving’s ‘profound relationship’ began as childhood playmates</div>
<p>During the war my mother, Anne, was sent to Canada because Bristol had been bombed a lot and my grandparents feared a German invasion. She didn’t see her parents for five years, and when she returned to England she didn’t recognise them.</p>
<p>Our family travelled the world throughout my childhood, including Australia, and we returned here when I was 16. My mother held it all together; she was maternal, loving and playful.</p>
<p>I first met my partner, Katrina Greenwood, when I was four as we lived across the street from her in Sydney’s Wahroonga. My brother and I used to play with her and her sister.</p>
<p>I didn’t get to know her properly until my second year at NIDA, when Katrina and her partner moved into the Darlinghurst share house I was living in with my girlfriend, Anna. The four of us were good mates.</p>
<p>Katrina has a minimalist aesthetic I really love. She is rarely dramatic or verbose and is the most extraordinary cook – we both love growing and cooking food. She taught me about food as an art form.</p>
<p>We’ve been together since our mid-20s. We never married but decided after six years that our commitment was to have our kids, Harry and Holly.</p>
<p>When I played Tick in Priscilla, I learnt that a lot of drag queens are pretty mixed up and lost. At the same time, they are fantastically buoyant and wildly entertaining. I also learnt a lot about sexuality because I feel very relaxed about my own.</p>
<p>I am forever grateful to my first love, Anna, because we had a very powerful, mutual and liberating relationship.</p>

<h1>‘She sure gave me a present’: How to deal with unwanted sexual innuendo</h1>
<h2>Life is full of fraught encounters. In the “How Do You Do It?” series, Samantha Selinger-Morris examines the prickly scenarios we sometimes find ourselves in and asks experts how best to deal with them.</h2>
<p>It’s the conversational equivalent of a drive-by shooting. One minute, you’re minding your own business chatting with a friend in a bar to celebrate your birthday and the next – bam! – you get hit by unwanted sexual innuendo.</p>
<p>Other people whose synapses haven’t been entirely cauterised by the pandemic have offered a more direct coping skill.</p>
<p>But, according to Dr Andrea Waling, a senior research fellow at La Trobe University’s Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health Society, the roots of the problem go deep.</p>
<p>It makes sense that there would be an increasing amount of social friction – and irritation – now when men continue to throw sexual innuendos into conversation.</p>
<p>But, of course, change is slow.</p>
<p>While many men have faced consequences for sexual harassment since Harvey Weinstein’s abuse came to a head four years ago, many others have struggled to accept that their sexualised talk is inappropriate, when it’s not mutually desired.</p>
<p>So, what to do the next time someone you know makes a ham-fisted attempt at a joke (or a deliberate attempt to make you squirm) in which they mention their wife’s genitals – or yours?</p>
<p>Richters admits she’s surprised that men now in their 30s and 40s are still making unwanted sexual innuendos in groups of men and women.</p>
<p>“It seems terribly old-fashioned to me,” she says. </p>
<p>But the reason middle-aged men, in particular, might be throwing out innuendos now, says Worling, might stem from a timeless anxiety.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Why don’t you, the next time you have a dinner party, say, ‘John, that’s kind of funny, do you want us to talk about that seriously?’”</p><cite>Professor Juliet Richters</cite></blockquote>
<p>It’s something you can throw out the next time someone you know makes you uncomfortable with an inappropriate comment.</p>
<p>And, should the person you inform of this call you a kill-joy, know that you’re not alone in your discomfort. An ill-timed innuendo has been scientifically proven to erode connections to other people.</p>
<p>Miller knows of what she speaks.</p>
<p>The caveat: they had to find it funny.</p>
<p>“If you get it wrong, it can destroy relationships, socially and therapeutically,” she says.</p>
<p>Miller knows this only too well. She recalls the time she once made an ill-timed joke in front of a patient.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘There’s the place to put your pants (the Scottish term for underwear), just, you know, tuck them away because I’m not paid enough to look at your pants’,” Miller says.</p>
<p>“The patient was horrified, she was absolutely horrified.</p>
<blockquote><p>“There’s nothing more boring than the person who thinks they’re a hilarious wit, and in fact they’re not.”</p><cite>Eileen Miller</cite></blockquote>
<p>“She was bright red and just mortified. She didn’t even want me to know that she wore pants let alone me ask about them, let alone have her bare bum in front of somebody she didn’t know.”</p>
<p>But Miller says the lesson can be passed on to those who might benefit from her hard-won wisdom: “There’s nothing more boring than the person who thinks they’re a hilarious wit, and in fact they’re not.” </p>

<div>How to get your relationship back on track</div>
<p>The pandemic has taken a toll on many couples, but not all have been equally affected.</p>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, it doesn’t have to mean your relationship is doomed. Far from it. Here are some easy ways to reset it for the new year and get things back on track.</p>
<h3>Your partner isn’t a mind-reader</h3>
<p>We mustn’t expect our partners to be mind-readers. We need to be better at expressing what we feel and, if possible, why.</p>
<h3>Don’t live in denial</h3>
<p>Try breathing in tandem or simply acknowledging that things are difficult and we’re all going to experience tough moments. If we create a strong enough bond, we can get through stormy times.</p>
<p>Don’t be tempted to distract yourself from your relationship problems, by drinking, for instance. This means you’re not addressing them and they will have no way of resolving.</p>
<h3>Rekindle the physical spark</h3>
<p>See yourself through your partner’s eyes: are you giving them a reason to want to sleep with you? Have you started neglecting yourself at home and assuming they’ll want you anyway, just because you’re there?</p>
<p>It’s worth both partners making the effort and seeing if anything changes. Often if you rekindle your sex life, other improvements follow.</p>
<h3>Find a sense of adventure</h3>
<p>As told to Rosa Silverman</p>
<p>Jean-Claude Chalmet is a psychotherapist who founded of The Place Retreats in Bali and runs a practice in London.</p>
<div>Couple goals for 2022 is ... dressing identically</div>
<p>More than 20 years ago, the look was considered a punchline rather than a power move. David and Victoria Beckham wore matching leather Gucci outfits to a Versace party in 1999, becoming the butt of jokes still revived by late night television hosts.</p>
<i>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</i>, in October. “I think it was a naivety then. We didn’t know about fashion. We were just having fun with it, which, to be honest with you, is kind of the way it should be.”
<p>At the turn of the millennium the trend failed to stretch beyond the red carpet, but now social media allows more people to experience the dopamine rush of celebrating a successful romantic partnership with pairing prints instead of #couplegoals.</p>
<p>Luscombe differentiates between the mirroring technique utilised by Jonah Hill and Sarah Brady and merging, which is commonplace with LGBTQI+ couples.</p>
<p>“Matching is when you are consciously putting matching clothes on. It’s typically more straight people,” Luscombe says. “For the moment.”</p>

<div>What is ‘love bombing’?</div>
<p>If you keep ordering two slices of cake for dessert every night for months, however, your health may suffer.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Here are some signs and patterns to keep in mind in order to avoid getting love bombed — and advice for what to do if you think it may be happening to you.</p>
<h3>Excessive attention and flattery</h3>
<p>One of the complicated things about dating, Raghavan said, is that everything that happens in healthy relationships can also happen in unhealthy relationships. Showing excessive attention is one example.</p>
<p>“It’s very exaggerated, histrionic, but could also be seen as deeply seductive and romantic, depending on what happens in between, what happens after,” Raghavan said.</p>
<h3>Isolation from friends and family</h3>
<p>It may seem sweet that your new mate wants to spend all of their time with you. But more often, it’s a red flag: The person may be a narcissist trying to isolate you from the other connections in your life as a way of exerting control.</p>
<p>“It does plant the seeds for intimate partner violence because typically a person will finally have enough and want to get out of it, and then it’s really hard,” Brunell said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>Raghavan said that showering new partners with presents is a common way for love bombers to exert influence, and even if they don’t have money, they may act as if they do.</p>
<p>Narcissists tend to be materialistic themselves, Brunell said, so they may also give gifts to boost their value and self-esteem.</p>
<p>Paul Eastwick, a psychology professor at the University of California, Davis, whose research examines how people initiate and commit to romantic relationships, noted that not all grand gestures should be red flags.</p>
<p>In healthy adult romantic relationships, support, desire and affection tend to be reciprocal, Eastwick said. But in cases of love bombing, attention flows in a single direction: One person tries to become the other’s whole world.</p>
<p>Raghavan said that people who have been love bombed often feel as though they’ve lost their sense of self, which can take a long time to rebuild.</p>
<p>“That needs to happen, the acceptance of the tragic events and embracing the positiveness of the future,” Raghavan said.</p>

<div>Lockdown messing with your hair? Here’s what the experts want you to know</div>
<p>So, how do we wait out these weeks with our hair and dignity intact? Ahead, three hair stylists answer some of the most pressing lockdown hair questions.</p>
<h3>Help! How can I get out of my hair rut?</h3>
<p>She adds: “At-home conditioning treatments are great to help with split ends. I love Kerastase Nutritive 8H Magic Night Serum and Kerastase Genesis Reconstructing mask.”</p>
<p>She suggests putting a shower cap on and a steamed towel over the top to elevate the treatment to a salon experience.</p>
<h3>Should I try to colour my hair at home?</h3>
<p>Croker agrees. “Covering the greys at home with a gloss is OK, and of course, the colour kits are fine, but anything else should be left to the professionals.”</p>
<p>For instant results to root colour problems, Beckett suggests using a spray-on colour, such as Colour Wow Root Cover Up. “It will cover greys, stay on all day and washes out with shampoo,” he says.</p>
<h3>Should I attempt to cut my own hair?</h3>
<p>Both Xydis and Croker do not recommend a DIY haircut.</p>
<div>Evangelista says CoolSculpting ‘disfigured’ her. So, what is it?</div>
<p>Supermodel Linda Evangelista revealed on Friday that she was left “brutally disfigured” and “unrecognisable” after undergoing a non-surgical cosmetic treatment known as CoolSculpting in 2015.</p>
<p>The experience has plunged her into depression, she says, leaving her a “recluse”. On Sunday she announced she was suing the proprietors for $US50 million ($68.6 million), alleging that the risks were not properly explained to her.</p>
<h3>Who is best suited to the treatment?</h3>
<h3>What went wrong for Linda Evangelista?</h3>
<p>According to the CoolSculpting website, side effects include bruising and swelling, tenderness, cramping and aching, skin sensitivity, tingling and numbness. In fact, numbness can persist up to several weeks after a treatment.</p>
<p>“It should not be offered to anyone with a BMI of over 30 because it won’t work the way it’s supposed to. It’s only if you have a small amount of stubborn fat or a minor bulge you can’t get rid of.”</p>
<p>Wilson adds that a patient also needs to have really good skin elasticity “because if you’re removing fat, you need the skin to be able to recover around where the fat used to be.”</p>
<p>Dr Dan Kennedy, president of the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons recommends consulting a specialist plastic surgeon for an expert assessment to discuss the full range of treatment options before considering cryolipolysis.</p>
<p>Kennedy says patients should also be well aware of their expectations and motivations before any treatment. “And ensure your medical practitioner details the risks and benefits to you even for non-invasive treatment.” </p>
<div><p>A previous version of this article stated Dr Jeremy Wilson treated a patient who developed PAH (paradoxical adipose hyperplasia) with liposuction. This is incorrect. He treated the patient with lipectomy and a neck lift.</p></div>
<div>Squashed or cheating? Inside our fascination with ‘Couch Guy’</div>
<p>To be alive today is to understand that tiny corners of the internet can, at any given moment, explode with very little warning to become a volcano of red, hot, highly contentious content.</p>
<p>A gold and white dress that might also be blue and black, for example. And more recently, Bad Art Friend, the New York Times article about one woman’s kidney donation, a Facebook post and the subpoenaed gossipy group texts.</p>
<p>And then of course, Couch Guy, the TikTok clip that’s become the subject of viral cheating speculation since it was posted to the platform on September 22.</p>
<p>We’re also actively encouraged to air our opinions. Comment sections, social media and Gogglebox can attest to that. Everyone is a psychologist now, says Symes. Even in the case of one woman’s private moment with her boyfriend?</p>
<p>“I do think when you open yourself and your world to the public, you open yourself to judgment, even if that judgment is misinformed.”</p>
<p>Still, Symes says: “Controversy and opinions, will always have a platform.”</p>
<p>In a strange turn of events, the wisest words may have come from Couch Guy himself, posting on TikTok: “Not everything is true crime ... Go get some fresh air.”</p>

<p>Every time Ben Affleck acquires any type of goodwill from the public, he somehow manages to put his foot in it and blow it all away.</p>
<p>When asked by Stern about the demise of his marriage in 2016, Affleck responded: “Part of why I started drinking was because I was trapped.”</p>
<p>“I was like, ‘I can’t leave because of my kids, but I’m not happy, what do I do?’ And what I did was [I] drank a bottle of scotch and fell asleep on the couch, which turned out not to be the solution.”</p>
<p>It was, to borrow a term, cringe. And people quickly pounced, with headlines everywhere breathlessly announcing that Affleck blamed his wife for his drinking.</p>

<p>Porcelain veneers have, traditionally speaking, been a signifier of wealth and wellness. Clean teeth and gums, after all, can have a major effect on our health, even impacting our heart.</p>
<p>And, since the pandemic, the desire for a straight, white smile has only grown, says Sydney cosmetic dentist, Dr Gamer Verdian. “There has definitely been a rise in smile makeovers and veneers since COVID.”</p>
<p>It’s a trend he believes is a consequence of increased use of social media and Zoom. “Staring at ourselves talking and smiling for hours on end is not really normal and has only been accelerated by working from home.”</p>
<p>But straight, white teeth are one thing. Oversized veneers that render you unrecognisable are quite another. What’s going on?</p>

<p>The result can be reminiscent of piano keys.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting fact of our times that, despite the meteoric rise in cosmetic procedures and filtered imagery, we often conflate inauthenticity with maleficence.</p>
<p>It appears the message in modern cinema is more subtle; and, in the end, probably more reflective of the surreptitious age we live in: that sometimes the shiniest of objects are filled with decay.</p>

<p>She’s not too old to stand for Parliament nor to shape laws that could affect the welfare of 26 million Australians, but Pauline Hanson is apparently too old to “sexually harass anyone”.</p>
<p>In the same interview with Sky News, Hanson criticised Higgins for not reporting her alleged rape earlier, even though Higgins had spoken about it to police but asked that they pause any investigation.</p>
<p>And that’s simply not the case.</p>
<p>It’s worth pondering what sort of response Hanson might have garnered if she were male. It’s true that, statistically, men are more likely to commit sexual assault, so the outcry might have been louder.</p>

<div>Why we’re still talking about Emma Watson and Tom Felton</div>
<p>Of all the fascinating permutations within the Harry Potter universe, there is one intricate mystery of such depth, it became the audience’s focus out of the recent Harry Potter reunion: the chemistry between actors Emma Watson and Tom Felton.</p>
<p>Watson, 31, who played whip-smart Hermione Granger in the franchise, described the moment she fell in love with older “bad boy” Felton, after the child actors were asked to draw what they thought God looked like.</p>
<p>“Tom had drawn a girl with a backward cap on a skateboard. And, I just don’t know how to say it, I just fell in love with him,” Watson said, adding that she looked forward to days when they were working together on set.</p>
<p>Though both revelations are soaked in nostalgia, the need we seem to have for people to fall for each other, transcends time. What is so exciting about learning of hopeless crushes in the past tense?</p>
