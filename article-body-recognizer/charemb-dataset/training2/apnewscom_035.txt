<p>SYDNEY (AP) — Australia and Japan will sign a treaty on Thursday to increase defense and security cooperation in a move that has been hailed as “historic” but which might anger China.</p>
<p>In September, Australia signed the so-called Aukus trilateral security pact with the United States and Britain under which those two countries pledged to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines. </p>
<p>The deal upset China, which said that Aukus “seriously undermined regional peace and stability, intensified the arms race and undermined international non-proliferation efforts.”</p>
<p>In a statement on Wednesday, Morrison described the latest treaty with Japan as historic and said “it will, for the first time, provide a clear framework for enhanced interoperability and cooperation between our two forces.”</p>
<p>“This treaty will be a statement of our two nations’ commitment to work together in meeting the shared strategic security challenges we face and to contribute to a secure and stable Indo-Pacific,” Morrison said.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Australia, along with India and Japan, are also members of a strategic dialogue known as “the Quad,” and Morrison said Wednesday that Australia would contribute “an expanding agenda” for that as well.</p>
<div><div><h1>Australia sees another jump in virus cases, hospitalizations</h1></div><div>January 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>SYDNEY (AP) — Australia on Wednesday saw another jump in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations and long queues at testing centers as it continued to battle the rapid spread of the virus in most states.</p>
<p>Among other measures to alleviate pressure on PCR testing centers, Morrison said those who return a positive rapid antigen test no longer need to have a PCR test to confirm the result.</p>
<p>New South Wales, the country’s most populous state, saw a record 35,054 new cases on Wednesday as it awaits the arrival of 50 million rapid antigen tests ordered by the state government.</p>
<p>State Premier Dominic Perrottet urged residents not to seek PCR tests unless necessary, adding that the arrival of the rapid testing kits expected next week would “significantly assist.”</p>

<p>Victoria reported 17,636 cases, a state record, and Queensland saw 6,871 cases.</p>
<p>The case numbers do not necessarily reflect the true spread of the virus as they only count the number of recorded cases.</p>
<p>Hospitalizations nationwide stood at 2,990 on Wednesday, with 196 patients in intensive care. Both numbers were higher than the previous day, when 2,684 hospitalizations were recorded, with 183 people in intensive care.</p>
<p>“We are not on our own in dealing with this. Other countries, most countries around the world, are dealing with exactly the same problems,” Morrison said.</p>
<div><div><h1>Shrill protests in France as Macron targets unvaccinated </h1></div><div>By JOHN LEICESTER and SYLVIE CORBETJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>PARIS (AP) — French President Emmanuel Macron has provoked outcries in parliament and protests from election rivals by using a vulgarity to describe his strategy for pressuring vaccine refusers to get coronavirus jabs.</p>
<p>The vaccine pass will exclude unvaccinated individuals from places such as restaurants, cinemas, theaters, museums and sports arenas. The pass will also be required on inter-regional trains and buses, and on domestic flights.</p>
<li><div><a><h4>Israel sets COVID-19 record amid zigzag policy and 4th jab</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>Virus surge tests limits of primary health care in Europe</h4></a></div></li>
<li><div><a><h4>CDC posts rationale for shorter isolation, quarantine</h4></a></div></li>
<p>Opposition lawmakers protested vociferously in the National Assembly chamber as Macron’s health minister, Olivier Veran, sought to defend the president’s choice of words. </p>
<p>Veran said Macron’s interview demonstrated his “intention, above all, to protect the population.” </p>
<p>Macron is facing reelection in April. He hasn’t yet declared his candidacy, but his intentions of doing so are becoming ever clearer. In the Le Parisien interview, he said: “There is no false suspense. I want to.” </p>
<p>Far-right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who opposes the vaccine pass proposal, said the president wants “to wage war against a portion of the French.” </p>
<p>Another far-right candidate, Eric Zemmour, accused Macron of “cruelty.” On the far left, presidential candidate Jean-Luc Melenchon asked: “Is the president in control of what he says?” </p>
<p>Macron’s supporters suggested the president simply expressed out loud what some vaccinated people already think about the non-vaccinated, in a country with bitter divides over the issue.</p>
<p>France reported a record-smashing 271,686 daily virus cases Tuesday as omicron infections race across the country, burdening hospital staff and threatening to disrupt transportation, schools and other services.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 in France, a number that has been rising steadily for weeks but not as sharply as the country’s infection rates.</p>

<p>Despite the government’s reisgnation, all ministers will remain in their posts until a new Cabinet is formed — and it remained unclear if the move would result in policy changes or have any effect of the growing protests. </p>

<p>The sentencing demand was initially scheduled for Nov. 24 but was postponed several times. </p>
<p>State prosecutor Agus Tri told the court that Zulkarnaen’s acts had resulted in deaths and injuries and that there was no reason for leniency.</p>
<p>“The defendant was involved in the Bali bombings plan,” he told the court. “He also instructed his group’s special forces led by him to save Jemaah Islamiyah’s assets, including weapons and explosives.”</p>
<p>Zulkarnaen, a biologist who was among the first Indonesian militants to go to Afghanistan in the 1980s for training, was an instructor at a military academy there for seven years, Indonesian police said.</p>
<p>Since May 2005, Zulkarnaen has been listed on an al-Qaida sanctions list by the U.N. Security Council for being associated with Osama bin Laden or the Taliban.</p>
<p>The Security Council said that Zulkarnaen, who became an expert in sabotage, was one of al-Qaida’s representatives in Southeast Asia and one of the few people in Indonesia who had had direct contact with bin Laden’s network.</p>
<p>It said that Zulkarnaen led a squad of fighters known as the Laskar Khos, or Special Force, whose members were recruited from among some 300 Indonesians who trained in Afghanistan and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Zulkarnaen was appointed the head of Camp Saddah, a military academy in the southern Philippines established for fighters from Southeast Asia, the Security Council said. He spent a decade at the camp training other Jemaah Islamiyah members.</p>
<p>He became operations chief for Jemaah Islamiyah after the arrest of his predecessor, Encep Nurjaman, also known as Hambali, in Thailand in 2003.</p>
<p>The United States’ “Rewards for Justice” program had offered a bounty of up to $5 million for his capture. He was the only Indonesian on the list.</p>
<p>Zulkarnaen’s next hearing is set for Jan. 12, when he and his lawyers will respond to the prosecution.</p>
<div><div><h1>S. Korea military apologizes for defector’s border crossing </h1></div><div>By HYUNG-JIN KIMJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff said South Korean surveillance cameras detected the person scaling a barbed-wire fence at the border on Saturday, triggering alarms and prompting a team of six soldiers to move to the area.</p>
<p>Jeon said the military will boost the readiness of front-line troops and upgrade surveillance systems along the border.</p>
<p>After arriving in South Korea, the defector identified himself as a former gymnast and said he crawled over border fences before being found by South Korean troops, ministry officials said.</p>
<p>The fate of the person who crossed into North Korea on Saturday is unknown. The Defense Ministry said North Korea hasn’t responded to its request that the person’s safety be assured.</p>
<p>While in South Korea, the defector struggled to adjust to his new life, complained to people around him and told them about his desire to return to North Korea, said Ahn Chan-il, a defector-turned-scholar in Seoul.</p>
<p>About 34,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea in search of better lives since the late 1990s, and about 30 have returned home in the past 10 years, according to South Korean government records. </p>
<p>Observers say the returnees likely suffered cultural shock and discrimination, had large debts or were blackmailed by North Korean agents who threatened to harm their loved ones if they didn’t return.</p>

<p>JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has received the first part of a report on corruption from a judicial investigation into President Jacob Zuma’s tenure from 2009 to 2018.</p>
<p>The result of three years of investigations, the report is expected to detail the extent of corruption in government and state-owned companies.</p>
<p>Chaired by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, the commission is expected to make recommendations to Ramaphosa, including possible prosecution of those implicated in wrong-doing.</p>
<p>He thanked whistleblowers and journalists for providing evidence to the investigation “often at great risk and cost to themselves.” </p>
<p>The report has been made public but Ramaphosa said his government will have to study all three parts and will only be able to comment on it at the end of June.</p>
<p>The second part of the report will deal with state contracts and sponsorships from government departments and state-owned enterprises to the now-defunct New Age newspaper.</p>
<p>The last part will focus on allegations of corruption at the South African Revenue Services, the country’s tax revenue service.</p>
<p>The judicial inquiry has uncovered evidence of what South Africans call “state capture,” how Zuma and his associates including the Gupta family of businessmen allegedly influenced the awarding of lucrative state contracts.</p>
<p>Testimony including from Cabinet ministers and top officials have directly implicated Zuma in corrupt schemes, including allowing the Gupta family to influence his cabinet appointments.</p>

<p>The sheikh was born in 1931 in the landlocked province of Qassim, known as the kingdom’s most conservative region. </p>

<p>BEIRUT (AP) — Unknown perpetrators attacked a group of U.N. peacekeepers in southern Lebanon, vandalizing their vehicles and stealing official items from them, a U.N. official said Wednesday. </p>
<p>Such scuffles with U.N. peacekeepers are not uncommon in southern Lebanon since the peacekeeping force was expanded following the 2006 war between Israel and the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group. </p>
<p>Local media reported that residents of the southern town of Bint Jbeil scuffled with Irish peacekeepers who they said were taking photographs of residential homes. The reports added that the U.N. force was not accompanied by Lebanese troops.</p>
<p>Bint Jbeil is a Hezbollah stronghold and large parts of its were destroyed during the 2006 war.</p>
<p>Ardiel said that contrary to the disinformation being spread, the peacekeepers were not taking photos and were not on private property. She added that the peacekeepers were on their way to meet members of the Lebanese army for a routine patrol.</p>
<p>UNIFIL was originally created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops after a 1978 invasion. The mission was expanded in Lebanon under a U.N.-brokered truce after the monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah militants in 2006.</p>

<p>BAGHDAD (AP) — A Katyusha rocket struck an Iraqi military base hosting U.S. troops at Baghdad’s international airport on Wednesday, an Iraqi military statement said. </p>
<p>No damage or casualties were reported from the attack, the third in as many days since Monday’s anniversary of a U.S. airstrike that killed top Iranian general Qassim Soleimani in Baghdad two years ago.</p>
<p>The Iraqi military statement said a rocket launcher with one rocket was located in a residential district in western Baghdad. The area has been used in the past by Iran-backed militias to fire rockets at the airport.</p>
<p>Pro-Iran Shiite factions in Iraq have vowed revenge for the killing and have conditioned the end of attacks against the U.S. presence in Iraq on the full exit of American troops from the country.</p>
<a> Gen. Frank McKenzie warned in an interview</a> with the Associated Press last month that he expects increasing attacks on U.S. and Iraqi personnel by Iranian-backed militias determined to get American forces out.
<div><div><h1>Israel issues first sentence in mob attack on Arab driver</h1></div><div>By TIA GOLDENBERGJanuary 5, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — An Israeli court on Wednesday sentenced a man to one year in prison for his involvement in a mob attack on an Arab motorist during a spasm of communal violence last year.</p>
<p>Lahav Nagauker, who was 20 at the time, was convicted of incitement to violence and racism as part of a plea deal that resulted in lighter charges. </p>
<p>The court said Nagauker was not involved in the actual attack, but threw a bottle at Moussa’s car, damaging the rear windshield.</p>
<p>The beating, which took place in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam, occurred while Israel was at war with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. The 11-day war ignited an unprecedented wave of internecine Jewish-Arab violence in cities around the country.</p>
<p>According to the plea deal, Nagauker confessed to the charges against him. His one-year prison term is retroactive to the day he was arrested in May. He was also ordered to pay 2,000 shekels ($645) to a restaurant damaged in the unrest.</p>
<p>Also Wednesday, an official Palestinian prisoners’ group said an Israeli military court sentenced a Palestinian-American man to two life sentences for carrying out a deadly attack on Israelis in the occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>Israel says Muntasser Shalaby carried out a drive-by shooting last May that killed Israeli student Yehuda Guetta and wounded two others. He was arrested days after the attack and Israeli forces demolished his house weeks later.</p>
<a>he was estranged from his family </a> and stayed there only for short periods when visiting from the United States.
<p>The Commission for Detainees and Ex-Prisoner Affairs, an official Palestinian body, said the court also required Shalaby to pay 2.5 million shekels ($800,000) in damages. </p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has said his chamber will focus early this month on voting rights legislation, another Democratic priority. He said he plans to hold votes on that issue by Jan. 17. </p>
<p>No. 2 Senate Democratic leader Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said lawmakers “clearly will return” to the $2 trillion package when their work on voting legislation is finished.</p>
<p>The sidetracked measure includes more than $500 billion in spending and tax credits aimed at promoting clean energy and working toward Biden’s goal to cut the country’s planet-warming emissions in half by 2030. </p>
<p>The plan includes tax credits for businesses that install wind, solar, geothermal and other clean energy technologies and also gives buyers of electric vehicles up to $12,500 in tax credits. </p>

<div><div><h1>Biden says deal with telecoms avoids flight disruptions </h1></div><div>By DAVID KOENIG and TALI ARBELJanuary 4, 2022 GMT</div></div>
<p>ATT and Verizon have agreed to delay the launch of a new slice of 5G service by two weeks after airlines and the nation’s aviation regulator complained about potential interference with systems on board planes.</p>
<p>President Joe Biden said the agreement reached Monday will help avoid further disrupting flights that bad weather and the surging coronavirus have already delayed and canceled by the thousands over the past several days.</p>
<p>The companies already postponed the C-Band rollout by a month when, over the weekend, they rejected a request by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and the head of the Federal Aviation Administration to delay the launch again.</p>
<p>Under Monday’s agreement, the companies also agreed to reduce the power of their new networks near major airports for six months. That will give the FAA more time to study potential interference with aviation.</p>

<p>Here’s a look at what happened and what comes next for wireless customers and air travelers.</p>
<p>HOW IMPORTANT IS THE NEW SERVICE FOR TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES? </p>
<p>Over the past few years, wireless carriers have spent tens of billions of dollars to license spectrum from the government and roll out 5G service. However, their plan to use C-Band ran into fierce opposition from airlines and aviation groups.</p>
<p>WHAT DID THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY SAY ABOUT THE NEW 5G SERVICE? </p>
<p>WHOSE SIDE IS THE GOVERNMENT ON? </p>
<p>HOW DID ATT AND VERIZON RESPOND?</p>
<p>They dismissed the concerns. The wireless industry trade group CTIA notes that about 40 countries have deployed the C-Band strand of 5G without reports of harmful interference with aviation equipment.</p>
<p>But ATT CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg did offer to reduce the power of their 5G networks near airports, as France has done. </p>
<p>Although they took steps to soothe the federal officials, the telecoms are still bickering with airlines, which have canceled more than 10,000 U.S. flights since Christmas Eve because of bad weather and labor shortages caused by COVID-19.</p>
<p>“While the airline industry faces many challenges, 5G is not one of them,” Vestberg said in a company memo Tuesday. </p>
<p>HOW MANY PLANES DOES THIS AFFECT?</p>
<p>WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE NEXT TWO WEEKS?</p>
<p>The two-week postponement will give the FAA and the companies time to implement the agreement.</p>
<p>Nicholas Calio, president of the airline trade group, was more muted in his comments about the agreement, although he thanked federal officials for reaching the deal with ATT and Verizon.</p>
<p>“Safety is and always will be the top priority of U.S. airlines. We will continue to work with all stakeholders to help ensure that new 5G service can coexist with aviation safely,” Calio said.</p>
