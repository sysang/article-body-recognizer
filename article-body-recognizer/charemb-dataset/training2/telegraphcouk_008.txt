<header> <h1> Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes guilty on four counts of fraud </h1> <p> Once feted as the female Steve Jobs, the disgraced tech star could now face decades in prison after creating a sham of a start-up </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Roland Oliphant and James Titcomb <time> 4 January 2022 • 3:49pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Fallen tech star Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud and conspiracy on Monday for turning her blood-testing start-up Theranos into a sophisticated sham, ending a lengthy trial that has captivated Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>US district judge Edward Davila had encouraged them to deliberate further, but the jury returned a final decision later in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Among the charges they cleared her of were one conspiracy to defraud patients and two charges related to patients who received inaccurate test results. </p>
<p>Holmes could now face up to 20 years in prison for each guilty count, but is likely to get a much lighter sentence. </p>
<p>Mr Evans later emerged in the hallway outside the courtroom, looking visibly shaken and emotional.</p>
<p>The verdict marked the culmination of a trial that charted one of the most dramatic careers in the history of Silicon Valley and could have major implications for a "fake it till you make it" culture that critics say dominates the US tech industry.</p>
<p>When she was nine years old, Holmes told family members she wanted to be a billionaire. By 31, she had appeared to reach her goal.</p>
<p><a>Feted as the female Steve Jobs</a>, down to the black turtleneck and elite security, Holmes had promised to redefine healthcare by testing for dozens of potential diseases with just a drop of blood.</p>
<p>But then it all unravelled.</p>
<p>Holmes, born in Washington DC to a Congressional staffer and Enron executive, started Theranos in 2003 and soon dropped out of a chemical engineering degree at Stanford University, in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>She aimed to upend an industry dominated by giant testing companies such as Quest Diagnostics and Labcorp, starting with setting up "mini-labs" in Walgreens and Safeway stores across the US that would use the small Theranos device.</p>
<p>There was also - so Holmes told investors - a deal with the US army. In late 2014, the company claimed to be valued at $9 billion, making it one of Silicon Valley’s most valuable start-ups.</p>
<p>Throughout proceedings, prosecutors sought to present Holmes as a trickster obsessed with fame and fortune who chose to deceive patients and investors instead of accepting the limitations of her company’s technology.</p>
<p>Jeff Schenk, the prosecutor, said in his closing arguments that “she chose fraud over business failure.” </p>
<p>“She chose to be dishonest with investors and patients. That choice was not only callous, it was criminal,” he said.</p>
<p>Her lawyers, meanwhile, said she had believed in Theranos’ abilities, and painted her as a victim of manipulation and abuse from Mr Balwani, who was also her former boyfriend.</p>
<p>During her seven days of testimony, Holmes occasionally expressed contrition for her handling of a variety of issues, but often contended that she'd forgotten the circumstance surrounding some of the key events spotlighted by the prosecution.</p>
<p>Mr Balwani has denied the abuse allegations and all charges that he defrauded patients and investors.</p>
<p>Holmes and Mr Balwani met in China while she was in high school, and became romantically involved after he joined the company in its early days.</p>
<p>Mr Balwani was made the company’s chief operating officer and effective number two despite a lack of clear medical expertise, and the couple maintained a secret relationship for 12 years until Holmes forced him out of the company in 2016.</p>
<h2>Five key moments in the trial </h2>
<h2>1. The high-profile witness</h2>
<p>Among the other former investors on the witness list were Rupert Murdoch and Henry Kissinger.Neither were called in the end.</p>
<p>Theranos employees described realising that the Edison devices the company was built on did not work. One said the devices were simply "unsuitable for clinical use." </p>
<p>Former staffer Erika Cheung said she eventually became so concerned she began to refuse to run blood samples on them. “It was starting to get very, very uncomfortable and very stressful for me working at the company,” she said.</p>
<p>The prosecution accused Holmes of fraudulently adding the logos of other blue-chip firms such as Pfizer, Schering-Plough and GlaxoSmithKline to Theranos documents sent to investors in a bid to suggest its technology had been vetted by them.</p>
<p>Holmes admitted the manipulation, the first time she acknowledged any personal involvement in the documents, which were arguably one of the biggest smoking guns in the case. </p>
<h2>4. Holmes takes the stand</h2>
<p>In a shock decision, the defense called only one significant witness, Holmes herself. It was a risky move that she presumably hoped would garner the jury's sympathy.</p>
<p>Over seven days on the stand, she was grilled for several days about inconsistencies in her story. In response, she claimed to have always believed in her company and blamed Balwani for letting her down. </p>
<p>The prosecution presented a picture of a strict, power-hungry manipulator. The defence said it showed she was a driven entrepreneur abused by her lover.</p>
<p>But the most dramatic moment came when she accused Balwani of raping, abusing and controlling her in an effort to "kill the old Elizabeth" and create the perfect CEO. He denies the allegations.</p>

<header> <h1> ‘Unconscious bias training is a fad that doesn’t work’ </h1> <p> Meet the Old Etonian helping companies navigate the chaos of post-Covid life </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matt Oliver <time> 4 January 2022 • 6:00am </time> </div> </div>
<p>When he’s trying to explain how our brains can play tricks on us, Octavius Black likes to talk about hurricanes and Rasputin. </p>
<p>“Isn’t that extraordinary?”, he says. “Our minds are doing this all the time. It can send you off in the wrong direction.”</p>
<p>These kinds of insights have fascinated psychologists for years, but Black argues they can also help solve some of the trickiest conundrums in the workplace.</p>
<p>Is the office dead? Should businesses take positions on popular causes? And how should they tackle bias that makes white, male managers less likely to promote their female or ethnic minority colleagues?</p>
<p>Black’s management consultancy, which he co-founded in 2000 with psychologist Dr Sebastian Bailey, aims to answer these questions with behavioural science.</p>
<p>Its customers include blue chip companies GlaxoSmithKline, Microsoft and Unilever, with MindGym using focus groups, seminars and “mind workouts” to tease out solutions to the problems they face.</p>
<p>At the moment one of the things people ask about is the pandemic shift to remote working, which has returned again this Christmas.</p>
<p>Even MindGym’s trendy office in Kensington, which has the feel of a tech startup, is now deathly quiet on Friday mornings. </p>
<p>But while bosses who favour offices have been dismissed as dinosaurs, Black, 53, believes they are actually right - up to a point.</p>
<p>“You think at the beginning, ‘I can work at home, avoid my commute, and I don't have to buy expensive sandwiches from the shop’,” he says.</p>
<p>“But actually, you’re not having those connections with people. And you start to remove yourself and become distant. Your decisions are less good, because you haven't got the context anymore.”</p>
<p>It was the isolation people felt while working remotely during the lockdowns that led to <a>the so-called “great resignation” this summer</a>, he believes, as people forgot what they actually liked about their jobs. </p>
<p>“So if companies can bring people physically together - though not all the time - we strongly advise them to do so.”</p>
<h2>'No evidence unconscious bias training works'</h2>
<p>Interestingly, Black is also scathing about unconscious bias training that has been rolled out by HR departments across the globe, which he says will not work. </p>
<p>“It is one of those fads that companies have spent billions on. But there is no evidence it actually helps. In fact, there’s some evidence it does more harm than good.”</p>
<p>Why? “Because people don't like being told what to do. If I say you're a sexist or misogynist, you'll go ‘Who are you to tell me, what do you know?’.”</p>
<p>Black says we should think about our “headwinds” - things that have been difficult - and “tailwinds” - our advantages - if we want to tackle bias.</p>
<p>We still tend to overestimate our own headwinds and underestimate other people’s, however.</p>
<p>“You think, life’s really easy for that person. But they’re thinking, ‘Well you have no idea how tough it was because of a, b, and c, and vice versa.’</p>
<p>“It's not as simple as being black or Asian, or gay or transgender. It's a whole range of factors, including social classes.”</p>
<p>He says encouraging people to use their tailwinds to help others overcome adversity makes us feel empowered.</p>
<p>“It's not a battle. We're all in this together,” he adds.</p>
<p>It’s a fine sentiment. Though some would argue Black, an impeccably well-connected Old Etonian, has enjoyed more tailwinds than most.</p>
<p>Born to the late advertising executive and socialite Brinsley Black and Lady Moorea Hastings, a former magistrate and daughter of a Labour peer, he attended Colet Court prep school and later Queen’s College at the University of Oxford.</p>
<p>Peers at Eton included David Cameron and Boris Johnson - although he insists they were not friends at the time - and he and his family have gone on holiday with the Camerons, as well as Michael Gove and his family, with whom they remain close.</p>
<p>After studying, he went into management consultancy and briefly worked at ABG Research, owned by Robert Maxwell, before it went bust.</p>
<p>Black rose to director. But he found himself irked when a client said a project had been interesting but not long-lasting.</p>
<p>“I thought, what am I doing if it doesn’t have a lasting impact? I needed psychology and behavioural science to match the communication.”</p>
<p>He linked up with Dr Bailey, from a rival outfit, and the pair started MindGym together.</p>
<p>The original idea was to give people “mind workouts” while they were exercising in an actual gym. This flopped, so they changed tack and pitched their 90-minute sessions to businesses - and the rest is history.</p>
<p>They chose 90 minutes because it is the longest most people can stay focused in one burst. All the firm’s techniques, Black claims, are evidence-based and overseen by a scientific panel. </p>
<p>He has written books and the company publishes papers with titles such as “The Inclusion Solution” and “The Only Way is Ethics”.</p>
<p>Black also funds Parent Gym, a philanthropic programme which helps aspiring mothers and fathers improve their parenting. </p>
<p>Like managing, he believes parenting is something most people can learn to do well with a bit of practice. </p>
<p>He and wife Joanne Cash, a libel barrister and former Tory election candidate, live in Notting Hill with their daughter.</p>
<p>What approach does he take to parenting? “I try to think about, in what environment, in what way, is my daughter at her best, and how can I create that environment.”</p>
<p>Given the recent turmoil in Downing Street, I finally ask whether he has any sorely needed advice for his former schoolmate Boris Johnson. </p>
<p>Black laughs loudly, but for the first time is not forthcoming. “None at all.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the best option, though, is for the Prime Minister to start telling people he shares a birthday with them.</p>

<header> <h1> Tesco and Sainsbury's drawn into activist battle over River Wye pollution </h1> <p> Supermarkets join environmentalists and rock stars in raising concerns about algal blooms </p> </header>
<div> <div> By Matt Oliver <time> 4 January 2022 • 8:04pm </time> </div> </div>
<p>Martin Morgan’s family has fished in the Severn Estuary and its rivers for generations. Now, as he gazes out over the tides, the 61-year-old says pollution has decimated the once-bountiful salmon stocks enjoyed by his grandfather.</p>
<p>Their campaigning has now pressured some of the companies inadvertently behind the problem to come to the table, including poultry producers whose farms are thought to be a major cause of pollution.</p>
<p>For activists, it cannot come soon enough.</p>
<a>Environment Agency </a>admitted last year, with just 14pc reaching a “good ecological standard”. The decline in water quality has been blamed on both agricultural fertilisers and raw sewage discharged by water companies.
<p>Besides risks to humans, this pollution causes algal blooms that suck up the oxygen from rivers, suffocating fish and depriving species such as otters and kingfishers of their food.</p>
<p>But the damage is not only ecological. During the summer - when the blooms are at their worst - tourists are put off from activities such as canoeing.</p>
<a>picturesque village</a> along the Wye in Gloucestershire, says: “The water sometimes smells powerfully of sewage. You can see waste floating in it sometimes, things like sanitary products, so no one wants to swim in it anymore.”
<p>In the Wye, a study by Lancaster University recently concluded that chicken manure was the main source of pollution.</p>
<p>This byproduct has long been used by farmers to fertilise crops, but indiscriminate use over long periods has left the soil overly saturated with certain nutrients such as phosphates which are leaching into the river.</p>
<p>Now a <a>growing concern about algal blooms</a>, as well as a crackdown by regulators, has prompted a major rethink of methods and practices.</p>
<p>Farms are now required to have nutrient management plans in place, while many are also using cutting-edge soil sampling tools and GPS to ensure phosphates are only spread on land where there is not already a surplus. </p>
<p>Avara Foods, one of the poultry producers in the area, is looking at novel ways to recycle chicken manure for energy or strip out the phosphates.</p>
<p>The firm says it acknowledges it has “a part to play in tackling the issues of the River Wye”, adding that “inappropriate use of chicken litter on land does have an impact”.</p>
<p>It is hoped that some of the techniques being trialled in the Wye can eventually be used across the country.</p>
<p>Supermarkets, along with other retailers, have been a key driver of these efforts too, because of <a>environmental commitments</a> made to source half of all fresh food from areas that use “sustainable water management” by 2030.</p>
<p>According to Tesco, it now inspects supplier sites to ensure standards are being met. “We require all of our suppliers to adhere to stringent environmental standards,” a spokesman adds.</p>
<p>“We appreciate that we are part of the problem,” he says, “but we are part of the solution as well. We take the protection of our local environment very seriously.”</p>
<p><a>Water companies </a>are separately facing a crackdown from the Environment Agency, which is investigating suspected unpermitted discharges of sewage at hundreds of plants.</p>
<p>For Simon Evans, chief executive of the Wye Usk Foundation, the efforts being taken at last to tackle pollution in the Wye are a ray of hope.</p>
<p>“We have been campaigning on this for years but for a long time we have not been able to do anything effective,” he explains.</p>
<p>“While we have not solved the problem yet - we are now at least at the point where we can solve it.”</p>

<p>We have again reached that point when supposed seers like me are expected to divine the shape of things to come. This is always a big ask, but I am finding it even more difficult than usual at the dawn of 2022.</p>
<p>Of course, we have no idea what unknown unknowns are lurking in the months ahead. That is always the case. But this year there are a good few significant known unknowns to unsettle us.</p>
<p>Clearly, what happens to the economy is going to be heavily influenced by Covid factors - the progress of the virus, the success or otherwise of vaccines and the severity of government restrictions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the UK’s economic recovery <a>looks likely to outpace other leading advanced countries</a>.</p>
<p>Over and above Covid, however, a strong recovery also depends upon something straightforwardly economic, namely inflation.</p>
<p>The Bank of England has already conceded that the Consumer Prices Index rate <a>will probably reach 6pc</a> in the spring, before falling back smartly later.</p>
<p>Combined with the coming tax rises, higher inflation means that, whatever the GDP figures say, most people are going to feel a good deal worse off.</p>
<p>But if inflation does fall back a long way after its spring peak, this would be another factor making for a strong second half of the year as the squeeze on real incomes is attenuated and the tightening of monetary policy is limited.</p>
<p>However, I am fearful that inflation may go higher and subside more slowly - especially given the Bank’s recent record of under-estimating price pressures.</p>
<p>Many of the factors immediately responsible for surging prices are supply-related and seem to be one-off. But that is often the case at the beginning of an inflationary upsurge.</p>
<p>To get on top of inflation, central banks have traditionally had to push real interest rates into positive territory. If anything like that happened this year, it would have a major impact on asset markets.</p>
<p>That should not deter the Bank. We have been living through <a>a substantial asset price boom</a>, closely related to the laxity of monetary policy. Things cannot carry on like this.</p>
<p>The Bank will not want to spook the markets, but inflation may not co-operate with its desired softly, softly approach.</p>
<p>If it moves higher than the Bank expects and/or threatens to become stubbornly entrenched, then the Bank would have to jack rates up to levels that few in the markets have begun to contemplate. That would have a jarring effect on investors.</p>
<p>Actually, something similar may happen even if inflation does not misbehave.</p>
<p>In international affairs, there is a dangerous situation as Russia masses troops on the border with Ukraine. Meanwhile, China continues its sabre-rattling over Taiwan and Iran makes further progress towards developing a nuclear weapon.</p>
<a>he will be unseated as Prime Minister</a>. Most Conservative backbenchers are yearning to rescind planned tax rises and, indeed, to introduce some tax cuts.

<p>The World Bank’s chief economist Carmen Reinhart says countries are now running out of economic ammunition as they fight to tackle the twin threats of omicron and rising living costs.</p>
<p>This means debt is going to define 2022, and the next 12 months will test the lofty promises of buy now, pay later firms.</p>
<p>These companies have ballooned by successfully promoting themselves as a healthier alternative to credit cards, transforming what was once a niche form of credit for fast fashion into a part of everyday life for millions.</p>
<p>Not having the money is no longer a reason not to have whatever you want, goes the cry: advice those trapped in a debt cycle will wish they never heard.</p>
<p>If millions more families are going to be squeezed financially this year, then the messaging must change.</p>
<p>Buy now, pay later companies and the retailers which use them must show that they too can resist temptation.</p>
<p>Now is not the time to urge vulnerable people to spend as much as they want with easy, short-term credit. The industry has become far too large not to be held accountable for some of the behaviour it encourages.</p>
<p>Klarna’s reach is now so huge – it is Europe’s most valuable financial technology start-up with around 90m customers and a valuation of $46bn (£34bn) – that it cannot shirk the responsibilities of big business.</p>
<p>This year will be pivotal for the industry. A Treasury review on how best to police this form of finance is due to close this week, after a study by the City watchdog last year concluded that buy now, pay later businesses must be regulated.</p>
<p>Campaigners have argued that policymakers are not moving fast enough to bring in new rules, especially as this type of credit has boomed during the pandemic.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this industry has been a huge success in which millions benefit.</p>
<p>If it really is the cuddly alternative to traditional lenders that it says it is, now is the time to show it. </p>

<p>Last spring, for the first time in many of our lives, the British state actually did something well.</p>
<p>Millions of smart meters in the UK - including the shiny new ones currently being installed - will need to be upgraded. Again.</p>
<p>The upcoming wave of replacements is happening because Whitehall has decided that the UK needs to turn off its 2G and 3G mobile networks.</p>
<p>The Government can’t compel the four national mobile operators to do so, but all four have agreed a sunset date with the Ministry of Fun, the Department for Digital, Media, Culture and Sport.</p>
<p>On its own, this decision makes some sense. Physics decrees that some parts of the airwaves are much more useful than others.</p>
<p>Radio waves go through walls, trees and fog much better at lower frequencies, and these frequencies were the first to be used by terrestrial TV broadcasters and the 2G digital mobile networks.</p>
<p>Spectrum that many people no longer use can then be “re-farmed” for use by modern devices. One bonus of this may be a more competitive broadband market, as you’ll be able to use a beefy 5G signal indoors.</p>
<p>The United States completed its 2G switch-off two years ago, and 3G will close by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Smart meter advantages for us seem <a>ever more elusive</a>: in a 2019 cost-benefit analysis, the Business Department included CO2 emissions reductions and “air quality” as wins.</p>
<p>But in reality our behaviour is dictated by need - when we need electricity, we use it. Attempting to tinker with demand when <a>our energy crisis has been caused by a failure to supply enough</a> seems like a diversion.</p>
<p>The first smart meter specification was intended for a small scale trial and was never supposed to be widely adopted. But the UK then seized upon an EU energy directive (2009/72/EC) and gold-plated it. </p>
<p>Hence the need for a proper, UK-appropriate specification, called SMETS2. Much of this is well thought out, but the consortium behind it, the DCC, has acknowledged that obsolescence is built in.</p>
<p>“SMETS1 and SMETS2 assets have a 15-year life,” it notes. For those of us who rely on them, that’s a big ask, as well as being a continuous rolling expense for consumers.</p>
<p>Perhaps technology may come to the rescue. Just as it’s possible to emulate an old 1980s 8-bit micro computer game in a modern computer, it’s technically feasible to emulate a 2G network inside a more modern 5G network.</p>
<p>Most galling of all is that Whitehall was warned, and key administrators were in the room when those warnings were made.</p>
<p>Representatives of both Ofcom and DCMS sit on the UK’s Spectrum Policy Forum, the expert body which in 2019 reported that 2G was far more widely used than many people realised, and should be considered national critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>One answer might be to create a Department of Critical National Infrastructure – but Departments like Business, Transport and MiniFun itself would only yield up the favourite part of their fiefdoms very reluctantly.</p>

<header> <h1> Seven tasty homemade gifts to make this Christmas </h1> <p> Whether it’s cranberries, pears or even sprouts, give friends and family something to relish this festive season </p> </header>

<p>Fed up of gaudy Christmas tat? Giving friends and family a homemade present of something delicious to eat is a brilliant way to give the whole commercial marketing bonanza the bird without turning into Ebenezer Scrooge.</p>
<h2><a>Preserved pears in mulled wine</a> </h2>
<p>I love these spiced pears, a pudding that is ready to go as boiling the jar – or hot-water processing – creates a vacuum seal that preserves the contents for up to a year at room temperature. Eat with yogurt. </p>
<h2><a>Pickled sprouts</a></h2>
<p>Sprouts are the comedy Christmas heroes, the Alan Partridge of festive veg. No-one would banish them from the Christmas table. Transformed into a jar of sprightly pickles like this, they might even win some converts.</p>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Poached clementines in whisky</a> </h2> <p>An alternative to pears, clementines poached in a boozy syrup (brandy works well instead of whisky) develop a beguiling melting texture that is lovely with ice cream.</p> </div> </div>
<h2><a>Whipped Marmite butter</a></h2>
<p>Marmite butter is brilliant slathered over sprouts or beaten into gravy for an instant umami hit. Using goat’s butter is my secret to make it super savoury, but you can use regular unsalted butter, too.</p>
<div> <h2><a>Christmas granola</a> </h2> <p>This is a barely sweet granola, fragrant with spice, and with chunky apple purée. Do splash out on a new jar of mixed spice – last year’s will have lost its joy by now.</p> </div>
<div> <div> <h2><a>Homemade cranberry sauce</a></h2> <p>One less thing for the Christmas Day cook to do. Plus, it looks beautiful, glowing ruby red in the jar.</p> </div> </div>
